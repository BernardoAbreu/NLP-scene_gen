<L>__{exterior master epps's plantation back porch day}
<A>__{ end of january, 1842 from the back porch, we come into the scene on edwin epps; a repulsive and coarse man. his language gives speedy and unequivocal evidence that he has never enjoyed the advantages of an education. epps reads the bible to his slaves, eight of them altogether. abram; a tall, older slave of about sixty years. wiley, who is forty eight. phebe, who is married to wiley. bob and henry who are phebe's children, edward and patsey. patsey is young, just 23 years old...though in the era, 23 not as young as in the present day. she is the offspring of a "guinea nigger," brought over to cuba in a slave ship. she nearly brims with unconversant sexuality. mistress epps, epps's wife, is also present. she sits with, holds quite lovingly, some slave children. with them she is very "motherly." we also see epps's overseer treach. treach constantly sports a loaded pistol. though epps reads the word of the lord, he lacks the tone of compassion with which ford read.}

<D>__{"and that servant which knew his lord's will...which knew his lord's will and prepared not himself...prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes..." d'ye hear that? "stripes." that nigger that don't take care, that don't obey his lord that's his master d'ye see? that 'ere nigger shall be beaten with many stripes. now, "many" signifies a great many. forty, a hundred, a hundred and fifty lashes... that's scripter!}
