<A>__{bucky's car screeches into the parking lot just as linda martin bursts through the doors and takes off running. bucky jumps from the car and sprints after her, the girl clutching an oversized purse to her chest as she dashes in and out of busy traffic. the girl runs like a fucking antelope as bucky barely misses being hit by a large beer truck and gets to the other side of the street just as linda stumbles over a curb sending her sprawling on the sidewalk. bucky jumps on her, grabbing her tiny fists as she kicks and screams like a hell cat. he cuffs her and pulls her up, dragging her to where she spilled her purse.}
