<L>__{interior rental car day (driving)}
<A>__{crawford steers, following a highway patrol car along a winding mountain road. clarice has the file open on her lap. he glances at her, inscrutable behind his sunglasses.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{talk about him, starling. tell me what you see.}
<C>__{clarice}
<P>__{(choosing her words carefully)}
<D>__{he's a white male... serial killers tend to hunt within their own ethnic group. and he's not a drifter he's got his own house, somewhere. not an apartment.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{what he does with them takes privacy... time, tools... he's in his 30's or 40's he's got real physical strength, but combined with an older man's self control. he's cautious, precise, never impulsive... this won't end in suicide, like they often do.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{he's got a real taste for it now. and he's getting better at his work.}
<C>__{crawford}
<P>__{(a beat; impressed)}
<D>__{maybe you've got a knack for this... i guess we're about to find out.}
<C>__{clarice}
<P>__{(quietly, evenly)}
<D>__{like i have a "knack" for dr. lecter?}
<A>__{he studies her a few moments, measuring her anger.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{okay, starling. let's have it.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{you haven't said a word today about that garage. or what i found there.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{what should i say? you did fine work. we'll wait on the lab.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{you knew. you knew from the start that lecter held the key to this... but you weren't up front with me. you sent me in to him naked.}
<C>__{crawford}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{are you finished?}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{he starts this buzzing in me, in my head. he makes me feel violated... you used me, mr. crawford.}
<A>__{a shadow of regret passes over his face, but he answers sternly.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{number one. maybe there's a connection, maybe not. lying and breathing are the same thing to lecter. number two. if i'd sent you in there with something to hide from him, he'd have known it, instantly. he'd never have trusted you.}
<A>__{she starts to answer, then is silent. he is right. by now the two cars are entering a tidy little town tree lined streets, wooden houses, one story shops, mountains in the background. they slow, turn.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{number three, i didn't bring you along today just because you can do first rate forensics. if lecter is becoming part of this case, you've got the most current read on him. and number four you don't have to like me, or the way i do things. but you do have to keep a cool head. especially now... because from here on out, you'll know everything i do. are we straight on that?}
<A>__{clarice nods, silently; it's as close to an apology as she's likely to get. she stares out the windshield.}
<B>__{just ahead of them}
<A>__{the highway patrol cruiser noses into a curb, next to other police cars, facing a big white frame house. its sign reads "potter funeral home." two troopers climb from the car. crawford parks too, then kills the engine. he turns to her, removing his sunglasses, gestures to the case file.}
<C>__{crawford}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{you think about him long enough, you get a feel for him... then, if you're lucky, out of all the stuff you know, one little part of it tugs at you, tries to get your attention... you let me know when that happens, starling. live right behind your eyes, today. don't try to impose any patterns on this guy. just stay open and let him show you...}
<A>__{one of the troopers, impassive in his sunglasses and hat, peers in through crawford's window. crawford nods to him, then turns back to clarice.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{school's out, starling.}
