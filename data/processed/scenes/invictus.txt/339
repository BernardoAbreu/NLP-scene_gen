<A>__{as in cape town, the springboks jog through the streets. as in cape town, cars toot their horns, people cheer. but the crowd running with them is twice as large as it was in cape town and twice as black. this crowd shows that the springboks really do have the support of the whole country now. as the `boks rumble past, newspaper vendors, gardeners, pharmacy delivery men on small motorbikes abandon their tasks and run alongside the team. pienaar turns to look at one of his teammates, grins, gets a grin in return.}
