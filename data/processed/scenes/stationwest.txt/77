<C>__{bristow}
<D>__{if you're trying to imply that you frightened me, coming here like this, you're right. i'm neither a hero nor a fool.}

<C>__{bristow}
<P>__{(himself again)}
<D>__{and what do you want from me?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i'm going to make a statement, which you will write and notarize.}
<C>__{bristow}
<D>__{is that all?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{yes except that you put it away where it can't be stolen or tampered with.}
