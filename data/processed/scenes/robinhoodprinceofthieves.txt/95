<L>__{exterior nottingham day}
<A>__{the gallows. swathed in a pink glow. a brilliant, wintry morning. breath billows from the mouths of the sentries.}
<L>__{interior nottingham castle corridor day}
<A>__{boots clack confidently down a stone corridor. the sheriff decked in wedding finery. he enters...}
<L>__{interior castle chamber day}
<A>__{... mortianna's apothecary. dark, smoke filled. foul things in jars. animals in cages, waiting to meet unspeakable ends. marian is strapped in a chair, flanked by two armed guards.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{how is my bride?}
<A>__{marian smiles as he leans toward her... and spits in his face.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{ah... you are overwhelmed with happiness.}
<A>__{he slowly wipes off the spittle... and slaps her hard.}
<C>__{marian}
<P>__{(calm, uncowed)}
<D>__{i will never marry you.}
<A>__{mortianna emerges from a dark corner, bearing the goblet she used at the druid ceremony.}
<C>__{mortianna}
<D>__{hold her!}
<A>__{marian struggles against her bonds.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{get away from me, you disgusting hag. i will not... augh!}
<A>__{the guards viciously restrain her, forcing her mouth open. mortianna pours the blood red liquid down her throat. marian fights, gagging and choking... until the drug takes its effect. she slumps forward. nottingham watches with amusement.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<P>__{(to mortianna)}
<D>__{when we are married, thirty of the northern barons will pledge me their support as king. as you predicted.}
<A>__{mortianna squats on the floor besides a platter of blood. clasps the dice like runes.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{what do you see in the portents?}
<A>__{mortianna rocks on her heels, clutching her taloned hands to her sides. she chants, fingering the bloody stones.}
<C>__{mortianna}
<D>__{the union. the blood of the lion and the house of nottingham. new faith. new power. new souls.}
<A>__{she stares at nottingham, her red eyes demented.}
<C>__{mortianna}
<D>__{if there is no union, there will be darkness, despair, death. ours!}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{di not give me riddles, woman. we are to be married within hours. how can we be in danger?}
<C>__{mortianna}
<D>__{the blood does not lie.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{tell me how it will result.}
<C>__{mortianna}
<D>__{i have told you what i know.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{confound you, crone. without my protection, the people would hunt you down, rip out your black heart and burn it.}
<A>__{mortianna runs at him. points her bony finger at his heart.}
<C>__{mortianna}
<D>__{without me, you are nothing. you are straw, a fleabite, a speck.}
<P>__{(as nottingham laughs)}
<D>__{laugh, fool. i birthed you from this body. i stole a babe in this very castle, and killed it so that you might rise in its place. you are my son.}
<P>__{(nottingham is}
<D>__{too shocked to}
<P>__{react)}
<D>__{together we are strong. now is not the time to doubt. now is the time to believe, to be bold. the bold will prevail.}
