<A>__{close on scoreboard ninth inning. durham is leading by a score of 1 to 0. two outs. jimmy is pitching he delivers. the batter rockets a line drive up the alley. a peninsula runner races from first, rounding third, trying to score. a relay. crash waits at the plate here comes the runner. here comes the throw. a close play. a terrible collision. crash goes rolling. the umpire waits and in a cloud of dust, crash holds up the ball. the crowd roars jimmy jumps victoriously in the air.}
