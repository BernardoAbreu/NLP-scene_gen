<C>__{margaret }
<D>__{i swear, it'd be fucking great for someone to have the testicles to make that book into a movie, man. instead of this bullshit all the time. something not about sex and violence and car chases and love stories, people learning profound lessons. jesus, isn't nature enough?}

<D>__{and it's wonderful, by the way.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{thanks. that's nice to hear. but i need to challenge myself as a writer. i've arrived at an age where i want to think about the world in a different way.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{adapting someone else's work is certainly an opportunity to think differently.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{yes. and i welcome the challenge of taking a small subject, like orchids, something that would never draw people into a theater and making that fascinating. i want to show people heaven in a wildflower. as blake wrote.}

<C>__{mckee}
<D>__{long speechs are antithetical to the nature of cinema. the greeks called it stykomythia the rapid exchange of ideas. a long speech in a script, say a page long, requires that the camera hold on the actor's face for a minute. look at the second hand on your watch as it makes one complete rotation around the clock face and you'll get an idea of how intolerable that would be for an audience. the ontology of the screen is that it's always now and it's always action and it's always vivid. life is rarely vivid. and that's an important pointerior we are not recreating life on the screen. writers are not tape recorders. have you ever eavesdropped on people talking in a coffee shop? then you know how dull and tedious real conversation is. real people are not interesting. there's not a person in this world and i include myself in this who would be interesting enough to take as is and put in a movie as a character.}

<C>__{mckee}
<D>__{the real world? the real fucking world? first of all, if you write a screenplay without conflict or crisis, you'll bore your audience to tears. secondly: nothing happens in the real world? are you out of your fucking mind? people are murdered every day! there's genocide and war and corruption! every fucking day somewhere in the world somebody sacrifices his life to save someone else! every fucking day someone somewhere makes a conscious decision to destroy someone else! people find love! people lose it, for christ's sake! a child watches her mother beaten to death on the steps of a church! someone goes hungry! somebody else betrays his best friend for a woman! if you can't find that stuff in life, then you, my friend, don't know much about life! and why the fuck are you taking up my precious two hours with your movie? i don't have any use for it! i don't have any bloody use for it!}

<C>__{laroche}
<D>__{should we drown him, then hit him on the head? uh uh. a body bleeds different if the heart's stopped. these new forensic guys are very smart. we really have to know our corpses to stand a chance: rigor mortis, lividity, putrefecation, ocular changes.}
<C>__{laroche }
<D>__{maybe you think we hit him on the head and force water into his lungs after he's dead? no, darlin'. they'll know he didn't drown. see, contrary to popular belief, the lungs do not do not fill with water in a drowning. what happens is, choking causes an irritation of the mucous membranes. this creates a shitload of mucus in the windpipe. efforts to breathe turn the mucus into a sticky foam which may or may not mix with vomit. it's the presence of this white foam that indicates drowning. there's a lot to be aware of, susie. shoeprints, hair, microscopic fibers. tire tracks. they all tell a tale to today's forensic scientists.}

<D>__{what do you think? you're a writer. how would you do it? what's a good way to kill somebody?}

<C>__{laroche}
<D>__{don't get all huffy, i was simply }
<A>__{suddenly laroche gets whacked in the back, flies forward into the water. orlean looks up, spaced. she's confused by a second kaufman standing there with a bag of potting soil. donald grabs kaufman and they run back toward the road. laroche pulls himself from the water.}

<D>__{fuck!}
<C>__{orlean}
<P>__{(receptively)}
<D>__{yeah, let's, baby.}
<A>__{she staggers moonily toward laroche. he pushes her away.}
<C>__{laroche}

<A>__{laroche's van pulls close to them and rams them from behind.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{it rams them again, this time sending them down into the swamp. the van stops. donald tries to back the car onto the road; the wheels just spin. laroche steps out of the van.}

<D>__{it's a rental! it's a rental!}
<C>__{donald}
<D>__{now!}
<A>__{kaufman and donald climb from the car, make their way deep into the swamp. laroche follows them in on foot, dragging orlean, who is admiring all the plant life.}

<C>__{laroche}

<D>__{um, y'know... charlie or something.}
<C>__{laroche}
<D>__{charlie! listen, let's talk! this pie is big enough for four people!}

<A>__{kaufman and donald are stopped by a large body of water. nowhere to go. laroche and orlean close in. the brothers run along the periphery of the lake. donald stops.}
<C>__{donald}
<D>__{wait. do you hear something?}
<A>__{kaufman stops, hears a distant galloping and squealing.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{donald, that sounds bad.}
<A>__{the brothers run in the opposite direction. the galloping gets louder. it's wild pigs. donald spots an airboat on the shore. they jump onto it, search hysterically in the dark for bow to start it. the pigs get closer. laroche and orlean get closer. donald finds a button, presses it, the engine starts. they pull away from the shore just as the pigs catch up. one pig leaps on board, squealing. kaufman kicks at it as donald attempts to steer the boat. a kick connects and the pig flies into the water. laroche stands at the shoreline and fires his rifle. it nicks the boat. donald looks back and the boat heads for a cypress stand.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{watch out, watch out, watch out!}
<A>__{donald gets the boat back on course. laroche and orlean have been left far behind. donald slows the boat.}
<C>__{donald}
<D>__{i think we're okay.}
<A>__{suddenly laroche's van comes tearing around a corner and speeds along the road at the water's edge. orlean shoots at the boat from the van window.}
<C>__{donald }
<D>__{hold on!}
<A>__{donald speeds up. the van keeps up, the shooting continues. bullets whiz. kaufman puts his head in his hands. a bullet hits the airboat's gas tank. it explodes in a ball of flame, illuminating the whole swamp. kaufman and donald are thrown, along with flaming pieces of debris. donald treads water, looks all around for kaufman.}
<C>__{donald }
<D>__{charles?! charles?! where are you?}
<A>__{underwater. a dazed kaufman tries to get his bearings. the murky lake bottom is lit a dim orange by the fire on the surface. an alligator appears. kaufman panics, surfaces. on the surface, donald spots kaufman pop out of the water, then get jerked back down. donald dives. underwater. the alligator violently shakes kaufman by the leg. donald surfaces, comes back down with a broken propeller blade. he hacks the alligator's head off, grabs kaufman, and brings him to the surface. donald swims to shore with kaufman in tow. another shot is fired. it skims the water near kaufman.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{fuck! fuck, donald, we're dead.}
<C>__{donald}
<D>__{we're okay. how's your leg?}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{i don't know. how's your back.}
<C>__{donald}
<D>__{it's fine. my back is fine.}
<A>__{laroche and orlean circle the lake in the van, shooting. mike owen, in pajamas, leaves his house, jumps in his truck and agitatedly drives toward the noise and flames. donald makes it to shore. he climbs out and is helping kaufman, when he gets hit by a bullet and falls.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{donald!}
<A>__{kaufman sloshes to shore. his right leg is bloody and mangled. he lifts his brother's head onto his lap.}

<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{see, it's just i thought i knew you already. i thought you were me. and i hated me.}

<D>__{well, don't do that anymore. okay?}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{donald dies. kaufman screams heavenward. the van appears out of the bush, barreling for them. kaufman rolls his brother out of the way, and limps off into a slough. the van follows, smashes into a tree, and comes to a halt. smoke pours from the grill and is lit by the headlights. out of the smoke, laroche and orlean appear with guns. they follow kaufman into the swamp. mike owen pulls next to the disabled van. he gets out, surveys the mess, sees bloody donald on the ground.}
<C>__{mike owen}
<D>__{jesus, that writer guy.}
<A>__{owen grabs his c.b., tries to radio for help. it's broken. he lifts donald into the back of the truck and speeds off. kaufman limps through the dark water. laroche and orlean follow the sound of his sloshing.}

<D>__{can we fuck now, baby? fuck like lemons?}
<A>__{owen tears along the dirt road. up ahead, kaufman limps out of the swamp, into the truck's headlights. owen is confused. he checks the back to see if donald's body is still there and skids off the road into the swamp. kaufman hurriedly limps over to the disabled truck. owen climbs out.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{you gotta help me. you gotta help me.}
<C>__{mike owen}
<D>__{what the hell is going on here?}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{they're after me. they've got guns. they killed my brother.}

<D>__{who's got guns? what are you }
<A>__{before owen finishes, his truck is flipped over. donald's body flies into the water. there, staring kaufman and owen down, is a giant man like beast. it's repulsive, covered in algae matted fur.}

<A>__{the two men turn and run.}
<C>__{mike owen }
<D>__{it's real! i can't believe it, i never }
<A>__{the creature grabs owen and snaps his neck like a toothpick. kaufman screams as he runs, watches over his shoulder. he runs right into the arms of orlean.}

<D>__{hey, it's the screenwriter!}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{there's a thing back there! you don't want to be here.}

<D>__{stand back, sweetness.}

<D>__{where'd johnny go?}
<C>__{laroche }
<D>__{susie!}
<A>__{orlean, agitated and disoriented, fires repeatedly into the darkness. something slumps forward in the water. orlean steps cautiously over, keeping her gun on kaufman. the creature is dead, so is laroche.}

<D>__{oh, johnny.}
<A>__{she sits next to laroche and pets his head. kaufman watches her. the sun is coming up.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{i'd just stare at your picture, and you looked so sweet. i read your words and i thought you were smart and maybe lost and lonely like me. and the way you wrote about laroche. you said he was handsome even though he had no front teeth }

<D>__{oh, johnny. johnny's teeth. oh...}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{i figured you could look at me and see something, even with all my flaws you could look at me and find something, you could maybe someday write a description of me that would be nicer than the one i write day in and day out in my head.}
