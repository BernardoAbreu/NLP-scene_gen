<A>__{wall e plastered against the back of the pod. it suddenly reduces speed.}

<D>__{cruising speed.}
<A>__{he drops to the floor.}
<C>__{ship's computer }
<D>__{you are now free to move around the cabin.}
<A>__{wall e fumbles to get his bearings. peers out the rear hatch window. sees the axiom receding from view.}
<D>__{wall e}
<P>__{(beeps)}
<D>__{[yikes!]}
<A>__{he clambers up into the pilot's seat. pulls back hard on the throttle. nothing happens. looks down at the console. a self destruct dial is counting down:}
<C>__{ship's computer }
<D>__{twenty seconds till self destruct...}
<A>__{uh oh. wall e frantically hits the self destruct button. no change. pushes every button on the console. everything activates: ...lights flash... ...oxygen masks drop...}
<B>__{outside the pod}
<A>__{...windshield wipers activate... ...flares fire off... ...parachutes deploy...}
<B>__{back inside the pod}
<C>__{ship's computer }
<D>__{ten seconds till self destruct...}
<A>__{wall e panics. looks for a means of escape. spots the hatch. grabs the pod's fire extinguisher. shoots himself to the door.}
<C>__{ship's computer}
<D>__{ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two...}
<A>__{pulls on the emergency exit lever. the hatch won't open!}
<B>__{on eve}
<A>__{she races through space after him. suddenly, in the distance, the pod explodes. eve is gut punched.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{no, no, no...}
<A>__{she flies towards the debris field, when wall e whizzes right past her.}
<D>__{wall e ee vaaaaaah!}
<A>__{he holds the fire extinguisher. uses it as a form of propulsion. eve is consumed with relief. chases after him. on wall e he points the extinguisher the other way. attempts to fly back over to her. it's hard to steer... ...they rocket right past each other again...}
<D>__{wall e}
<P>__{(beeps)}
<D>__{[stay there! i will come to you!]}
<A>__{eve waits. wall e finally has the hang of steering. fires short bursts. very slowly...makes his way...to eve. gets extinguisher foam in her face. she giggles.}
<D>__{wall e}
<P>__{("look what i've got")}
<D>__{ee vah...}
<A>__{he opens his compactor door. pulls out the plant, still in the boot.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(gasp!)}
<A>__{on eve's display pov ...sensors zero in on the plant... ...confirm its authenticity... ...a map of the axiom appears... ...draws directions to the bridge... ...a command flashes: "deliver to axiom superior"... eve is ecstatic. she snaps the plant up with her tractor beam. seals it safely in her chest. then scoops up wall e in her arms. spins him around.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{wall e! (laughs)}
<A>__{wall e can't believe his luck. rests his head on her shoulder. bliss. eve stops spinning. leans her head against his. a tiny arc of electricity passes between them. a "thank you" kiss. wall e's meter spikes. he floats circles in space.}

<P>__{(swoons)}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(hums)}
<D>__{[come on. time's a wastin'.]}
<A>__{she reaches for his hand. wall e shakes his head. holds up his extinguisher instead.}
<D>__{wall e}
<P>__{(beeps)}
<D>__{[i can fly myself.]}
<A>__{kicks on the extinguisher. spins in a pirouette... ...and flies away. eve giggles. chases after him. bing crosby's "stardust" plays the two fly around the stern of the ship. wall e does a few barrel rolls.}
<D>__{wall e}
<P>__{(beeps)}
<D>__{[try that.]}
<A>__{eve giggles. matches him move for move. the pair fly between the booster engines of the ship. weave in and out of the rocket flames. bank up along the ship's port side. execute a double helix in perfect unison...}
