<L>__{exterior carnival day.}
<A>__{paul and sethe and denver walk among the hundreds of black townspeople gathered for the carnival. a sign reads colored thursday...two pennies entrance fee. paul is in high spirits. saying hello to anyone whose eye he catches. willing, eager to get anything for denver she wants. feeling a little more like a normal van in a normal life. denver is excited but worried. she doesn't want to like paul but can't help the thrill she's feeling. and when one or two passersby shout out;}
<D>__{various passers }
<C>__{by}
<D>__{hey denver!...hi there denver!}
<A>__{denver heart almost weeps with joy. sethe walks cautiously. overdressed for the occasion, it is her first outing among neighborhood folk in many years. she catches the eyes of some of the women she knows...ella and lady jones..good christian women who nod in their acknowledgement yet are holding back something. a judgement? a repulsion? paul doesn't notice them and for this sethe is glad. montage of scenes...the various carnival acts, all performed by a white troupe; magic, clowning, fire swallowing, spitting ribbons, acrobats forming pyramids... our trio take it all in like water to the thirsty. at one point, a white carnival barker shouts to the children;}
<C>__{carnival barker}
<D>__{all pickaninnies free!!}
<A>__{the phrase stabs sethe and paul a bit. but paul whispers;}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{two pennies and an insult well spent in my opinion to see the spectacle of whitefolks making a spectacle of themselves.}
<A>__{sethe can't help but let out a small laugh and with that laugh, a sudden sensation of relief... paul buys denver some licorice, peppermint and lemonade. holding the lemonade for her, paul asks;}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{mind if i take a sip?}
<A>__{denver agrees. paul takes some lemonade then wipes the rim where he sipped with a small napkin and gently hands it back to her. denver, in spite of herself, is starting to like him.}
