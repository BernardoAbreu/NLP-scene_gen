<D>__{jen!}
<A>__{jen greets yu with the green destiny.}
<C>__{yu}
<D>__{everyone out. shut the doors.}
<A>__{the men leave.}
<C>__{yu}
<D>__{fine... the friendship is over.}
<A>__{yu scoops up a weapon from one of many lying around and begins her battle with jen. yu uses every weapon that's available against jen but none are any match for the green destiny. after slicing through another set of yu's weapons, jen looks admiringly at the green destiny in her hands.}
<C>__{yu}
<D>__{don't touch it! that's li mu bai's sword.}
<C>__{jen}
<D>__{come and get it if you can.}
<C>__{yu}
<D>__{without the green destiny, you are nothing.}
<C>__{jen}
<D>__{don't be a sore loser. go ahead. take your pick. i will wait. go ahead.}
<A>__{yu picks up a huge broad sword and attacks. just as the green destiny slices it in half, yu holds the broken blade at jen's neck. she pauses before hurting jen, then pulls back.}
<C>__{yu}
<D>__{give me the sword.}
<A>__{jen, taking advantage of yu's trust, slices her arm.}
<C>__{jen}
<D>__{take it!}
<A>__{yu, her shoulder bleeding, falls back as li mu bai jumps in.}
<C>__{li}
<P>__{(enraged)}

<C>__{jen}
<D>__{not another lecture! on guard!}
<C>__{li}
<D>__{let's end this here.}
<C>__{jen}
<D>__{only the sword will settle this.}
