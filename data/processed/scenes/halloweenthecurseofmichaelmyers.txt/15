<A>__{as he leaps out of bed and pads across polished wooden floors into the hallway. lightning flashes. with the next thunder crash comes a startling, barely intelligible voice.}

<D>__{danny ...}
<A>__{danny freezes. slowly turns. danny's pov an ominous shadow at the end of the hall, illuminated by lightning. long duster and brimmed hat. the stranger! in his outstretched hand, the gleaming butcher knife!}

<D>__{it's all right, mom. go back to bed.}
