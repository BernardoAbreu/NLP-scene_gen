<A>__{"come, ye children, listen to me. i will teach you the fear of the lord."}
<D>__{psalm 34:11}
<A>__{the mojave desert dusk vast. barren. no signs of life. a blood red sun is sinking behind the distant mountains. the unbearable heat will soon become an unbearable cold. a young woman's voice. solemn. weary. determined.}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{when i was a little girl, my mother would remind me each night before bed to be sure to open my heart to god, for he was kind, merciful and just. things changed after my father left a few years later, leaving her to raise me and my brothers alone in a little place out on the edge of the mojave desert. she never talked about a kind and merciful god again. instead she spoke of a prophecy. of a time when all the world would be covered in darkness and the fate of mankind would be decided. one night i finally got up the courage to ask my mother why god had changed, why was he mad at his children. "i don't know," she said, tucking the covers around me, "i guess he just got tired of all the bullshit."}

<B>__{a blood red moon}
<A>__{reflected in a greasy puddle of water. might just be the smog that's making it that ominous color. then we notice something moving in the reflection. a dark shape, growing, coming down at us fast. beat...then wham!}
