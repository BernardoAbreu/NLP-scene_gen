<A>__{and wearing a homemade placard reading "hands off cuba"; "viva fidel!", is hawking leaflets to pedestrians with two young helpers. a large white haired businessman in a white suit, very distinguished, walks with a friend on canal street. oswald glances at him and meets his eyes. the businessman enters an office building. this man is clay bertrand, later known as clay shaw. some cubans, led by carols bringuier, now appear. one of them, "the bull", is heavy set with dark glasses. more of him will also be seen.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{he was arrested that day for fighting with some anti castro cubans... but actually he had contacted them a few days earlier as an ex marine trying to join the anti castro crusade. when they heard he was now pro castro, they paid him a visit.}

<P>__{(haranguing passerby)}
<D>__{he's a traitor, this man! don't believe a word he tells you!}
<P>__{(to oswald)}
<D>__{you sonofabitch, you liar, you're a communist, go back to moscow.}
<A>__{carlos throws oswald's leaflets in the air and pulls off his glasses, prepared to fight. oswald only smiles, and puts his arms down in an x of passivity.}
<C>__{oswald}
<D>__{okay, carlos, if you want to hit me, hit me.}
<A>__{there is no real fight, but the police, as if pre alerted, arrive. arrests are made. we see oswald in a room in the police station, talking with fbi agent john quigley. a calendar on the wall shows that it's august, 1963.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{there was no real fight and the arresting lieutenant later said he felt it was a staged incident. in jail, oswald asked to talk to special agent john quigley of the fbi who showed up immediately. they have a private session. oswald is released and quigley destroys his notes from the interview.}
<A>__{in a television studio in 1963, oswald debates carlos bringuier with two moderators.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{but the arrest gets him a lot of publicity and as a result oswald appears on a local tv debate that established his credentials as a communist.}
<C>__{bringuier}
<D>__{but you're a communist, are you not, and you defected to russia.}
<C>__{oswald}
<D>__{no, i am not a communist. but i am a marxist leninist.}
<C>__{bringuier}
<D>__{what did you do when you were in russia?}
<C>__{oswald}
<P>__{(defensive)}
<D>__{i worked while i was there. i was always under the protection of... that is to say, i was not under the protection of the u.s. government.}

<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what the hell's a communist like lee oswald doing working out of banister's?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{y'ever heard of a double agent, bill? i'm beginning to doubt oswald was ever a communist... after the arrest, 544 camp street never appeared on the pamphlets again. now here's another one for you: what would you say if i told you lee oswald had been trained in the russian language when he was a marine?}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{i'd say he was probably getting intelligence training.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{lou, you were in the marines. who would be running that training?}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{the office of naval intelligence.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{take a look across the street.}
<A>__{we see the post office building across the street.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{post office.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{upstairs. in 1963 that was the office of naval intelligence and just by coincidence, banister, before he was fbi, was oni. what do they say?}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{"once oni, always oni"?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well, he likes to work near his old pals.}
<A>__{jim makes a gesture encompassing the whole square.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{bill, lou, we're standing in the heart of the united states government's intelligence community in new orleans. that's the fbi there, the cia, secret service, oni. doesn't this seem to you a rather strange place for a communist to spend his spare time?}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{what are you driving at, boss?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{we're going back into the case, lou the murder of the president. i want you to take some money from the fees and fines account and go to dallas talk to some people. bill, i want you to get oser on the medical, the autopsy, susan on oswald and ruby histories, tax records...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{lord, wake me, please. i must be dreaming.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{no, you're awake, bill, and i'm dead serious. and we're going to start by tracking down your anonymous source from three years ago. how did you find out dave ferrie drove to texas that day?}
<A>__{racetrack day(1966) a straggly group of people watch from the grandstands eating hotdogs and talking in small clusters. the horses are running early morning laps. three men sit apart in the bleachers. a scared jack martin, three years older than when last seen, still wearing the dick tracy hat, sucks up coffee like a worm does moisture. he has the red puffy cheeks of an alcoholic and deeply circled, worried eyes. bill and jim wait.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you're not under cross examination here, jack.}
<A>__{what i need is a little clarification about the night guy banister beat you over the head with his magnum. you called our office hopping mad from your hospital bed. don't tell me you don't remember that? jack looks away and doesn't respond.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{here's my problem, jack. you told me you and guy were good friends for a long time?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{more than ten years.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{and he never hit you before?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{never touched me.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{yet on november 22, 1963 the day of the president's murder our police report says he pistol whipped you with a .357 magnum.}
<P>__{(martin's eyes are fixed on jim)}
<D>__{but the police report says you had an argument over the phone bill. here, take a look at it.}
<P>__{(martin looks at the report)}
<D>__{now, does a simple argument over phone bills sound like a believable explanation to you?}
<A>__{sudden flashback to the night of the pistol whipping. the camera shows banister laying martin's head open the beating the humiliation.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(shaking his head slowly, dreamily)}
<D>__{no, it involved more than that.}
<A>__{bill looks at jim.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{how much more?}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(waits)}
<D>__{i don't know if i should talk about this.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{well, i'd ask guy we were friendly, you know heart attack, wasn't it?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{if you buy what you read in the paper.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you have other information?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i didn't say that. all i know is he died suddenly just before the warren report came out.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{why did guy beat you, jack?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{well, i guess now that guy's dead, it don't really matter... it was about the people hanging around the office that summer. i wasn't really part of the operation, you know. i was handling the private eye work for guy when that came in not much did but that's why i was there... it was a nuthouse. there were all these cubans coming and going. they all looked alike to me.}
<A>__{flashback to banister's office in 1963. there are cubans in battle fatigues and combat boots; duffle bags are lying around. david ferrie, in fatigues, directs the cubans as they carry crates of ammunition and weapons into a back room. martin observes from another desk.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{dave ferrie you know about him?}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{was he there often?}
<C>__{martin }
<D>__{often? he practically lived there. it was real cloak and dagger stuff. they called it operation mongoose. the idea was to train all these cuban exiles for another invasion of cuba. banister's office was part of a supply line that ran from dallas, through new orleans to miami, stockpiling arms and explosives.}
<A>__{still in 1963, we see the exterior of banister's office. a dozen cubans follow ferrie downstairs into the street, and pile into several cars, duffels thrown in with them. ferrie drives the lead car.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{all this right under the noses of the intelligence community in lafayette square?}
<A>__{we see the cars cross the long lake pontchartrain bridge and enter a remote guerrilla training camp. bayou and jungle are all around.}
<C>__{martin }
<D>__{sure. everybody knew everybody. it was a network. they were working for the cia pilots, black operations guys, civilians, military everybody in those days was running guns somewhere... fort jefferson, bayou bluff, morgan city... mcallen, texas was a big gun running operation.}
<A>__{at the guerrilla training camp at lake pontchartrain in 1963, we see scenes of basic training shooting, obstacle courses, callisthenics led by ferrie and other trainers. scattered among the cubans are several white american mercenaries. we catch a glimpse of oswald and glimpses of several other men we will see again, in sprinklings.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{where is banister in all this?}
<C>__{martin }
<D>__{banister was running his camp north of lake pontchartrain. ferrie handled a lot of the training. there was a shooting range and a lot of tropical terrain like in cuba. a few americans got trained, too. nazi types. mercenaries. but ferrie was the craziest.}
<A>__{it's night at the training camp. fbi agents race up in cars in the middle of the night, swarming over the camp, rounding up the trainees.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{anyway, late summer the party ended. kennedy didn't want another bay of pigs mess, so he ordered the fbi to shut down the camps and confiscate the napalm and the c 4. there were a buncha cubans and a couple americans arrested, only you didn't read about it in the papers. just the weapons got mentioned... 'cause the first ones behind bars would've been banister and ferrie, but i think the g men were just going through the motions for washington. their hearts were with their old fbi buddy banister.}
<A>__{we see fbi agents loading dynamite, bomb casings, arms 155mm artillery shells, etc. back at the racetrack in 1966, jim listens.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{like i said, a fuckin' nuthouse.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{and oswald?}
<A>__{martin hesitates. we hear the rhythmic beating of the horse hooves and martin sucking on the steaming cup of coffee.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{yeah, he was there, too... sometimes he'd be meeting with banister with the door shut. other times he'd be shooting the bull with ferrie. but he was there all right.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{anything more specific, jack? it's important.}
<A>__{flashback to banister's office in 1963. banister and martin shooting the breeze as the straight laced middle aged secretary, delphine roberts, hurries in.}
<C>__{martin }
<D>__{yeah, one time the secretary got upset, i remember...}
<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{i can't believe it, mr. banister. lee oswald is down on canal street giving out communist leaflets supporting castro!}
<A>__{banister just looks at her and laughs.}
<C>__{banister}
<D>__{it's okay, delphine, he's with us.}
<A>__{back at the racetrack...}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{anyone else involved at banister's level?}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{there was one guy, i don't know, big guy, business guy, white hair i saw him come into the office once. he looked out of place, y'know like a society guy. can't remember his name.}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{oswald was with him.}
<A>__{flashback to banisters office on a day in 1963. martin is snooping in banister's files. cut to martin leaving the office as a big businessman with white hair briefly talks to oswald and then goes into banister's private office.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{he had something to do with money. i remember him cause guy, who didn't kiss anybody's ass, sure kissed his.}
<A>__{banister lets the man into his private office.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{clay something, that was his name clay.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{bertrand. clay bertrand?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{yeah! that's it.}
<P>__{(pause, paranoid)}
<D>__{i don't know. maybe it wasn't. i gotta go.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(to bill)}
<D>__{clay bertrand. he's in the warren report. he tried to get oswald a lawyer.}
<P>__{(to martin)}
<D>__{was kennedy ever discussed, jack?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{sure. 'course they hated the sonofabitch, but...}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{the assassination, jack?}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(tightens)}
<D>__{never. not with me sir, never... listen, i think i'd better go. i said enough. i said all i'm going to say.}
<P>__{(rises suddenly)}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{hold on, jack. what's the problem?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{what's the problem? what's the problem? do i need to spell it out for you, mr. garrison? i better go.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{nobody knows what we're talking about, jack.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{you're so naive, mister.}
<A>__{martin picks his way nervously down the bleacher benches. car french quarter day(1966) jim drives, with numa in the front and bill in the back.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well, it's a terrific yard, chief, but the man's an obvious alcoholic with a reputation lower than crocodile piss.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{does that bother you, bill? i always wondered in court why it is because a woman is a prostitute, she has to have bad eyesight.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{he'll never sign a statement, boss, let alone get on a witness stand.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{when something's rotten in the land, bill, it generally isn't just one fish, we'll get corroboration... find this clay bertrand. if i were a betting man, i'd give you 10 to 1 it's an alias. start checking around the quarter.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{and the six of us, with almost no budget and in secret, are going to solve the case that the warren commission with dozens of support staff and millions of dollars couldn't solve. we can't keep up with the crimes in the parish as it is, chief.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{the murder of a president, bill, is a crime in orleans parish too. i didn't pick you because of your legal skill, you know.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{gee, thanks boss.}
<A>__{jim pulls the car over to park.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{but because you're a fighter. i like a man who isn't scared of bad odds.}
<A>__{french quarter sidewalk day(1966) jim and the others get out of the car and head towards antoine's restaurant. a black woman greets him.}
<C>__{black woman}
<D>__{how ya doing, mr. garrison? remember me from the piano bar at the royal orleans?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i sure do. we sang "you're the cream in my coffee."}
<A>__{she laughs. others move in on him.}
<C>__{jim}

<D>__{make sure we come back here, now.}
<A>__{antoine's restaurant day(1966) they enter a busy lunchtime crowd in an elegant eatery. lou ivon and al oser are waiting for them as they're shown to their table by the maitre d'.}
<C>__{maitre d'}
<D>__{mr. garrison, we have not seen enough of you lately.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{been too busy, paul an elected man can't have as much fun as he used to.}
<P>__{(seeing lou and al)}
<D>__{welcome back, lou. find out anything on those hobos?}
<A>__{lou's been waiting, excited. he gives jim blowups of the five hobo photographs.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{they took 'em to the sheriff's office, not the police station, and they let 'em go. no record of them ever being questioned.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i can't say that comes as a surprise anymore.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{a photographer from the dallas times herald got some great shots of them never published...}
<A>__{the camera moves in on the photographs. flashback to the "hoboes" being escorted to the sheriff's office as per sgt. harkness' earlier description.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{...take a good look, chief, do any of 'em look like the hoboes you remember?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{hoboes i knew of old used to sleep in their clothes these two look pretty young.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{...not a single frayed collar or cuff, new haircuts, fresh shaves, clean hands new shoe leather. look at the ear of the cop... that's a wire. what's a cop wearing a headset for? i think they're actors, chief; they're not cops.}
<A>__{susie cox arrives.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{who the hell are they, then! hi, susie, sit down.}
<P>__{(to lou)}
<D>__{this could be it. let's start looking for 'em.}
<A>__{how 'bout that railroad man, lee bowers? saw those men at the picket fence?}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{graveyard dead. august this year.}
<P>__{(jim curses quietly)}
<D>__{a single car accident on an empty road in midlothian, texas. the doctor said he was in some kind of strange shock when he died.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(shares the look)}
<D>__{we need to find more witnesses, lou.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{there was rose cheramie. a whore. two cubans threw her out of a car on the way to dallas.}
<A>__{she talked to a cop from a hospital bed two days before the assassination, said kennedy would be hit that friday. she said she was a dope runner for jack ruby and that ruby knew oswald for years...}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{can we find her?}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{graveyard dead near big sandy, texas in '65. two in the morning on some highway. a hit and run.}
<A>__{flashback to rose lying dead on an empty highway.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{why not go right to the horse's mouth, chief?}
<A>__{jack ruby's been rotting in a dallas jail cell for three years. maybe he's ready to crack?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{if we go to him our investigation'll hit the front pages by sunrise. blow up right in our face. ruby was just given a new trial. if he has something to say, it'll be there. susie, what did you find out on oswald?}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{negative on his tax records. classified. first time i know a d.a. can't get a tax record. i put together a list of all the cia files on oswald that were part of the warren report and asked for them. there are about 1200 documents...}
<P>__{(gives it to jim who reads)}
<D>__{oswald in the ussr, in mexico city, oswald and the u2, a cia 201 personnel file, a memo from the director on oswald, travel and activities can't get one of them. all classified as secret on the grounds of national security. it's real strange.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{maybe there's more to this, susie. the cia's keeping something from our enemies.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{yes, but we're talking about a dead warehouse employee of no political significance. three years later and he's still classified? they gave us his grammar school records, a study of his pubic hairs... put it in context, bill, of what we know about oswald. lonely kid, no father, unstable childhood, high school dropout wants to grow up and be a spy, joins the marines at 17. he learns russian, he acts overtly marxist with two other marines, but he's stationed at a top secret base in japan where u2 spy flights over russia originate. he's discharged from the marines supposedly because his mother's sick. he stays home 3 days, then with a $1500 ticket from a $203 bank account, he goes to moscow...}
<A>__{flashback to moscow in 1959. we see shots of the city strange and eerie black and white stills. inside the u.s. embassy oswald slaps his passport on the table with a formal letter. two consuls attend him.}
<C>__{oswald}
<P>__{(voice stilted)}
<D>__{i want to renounce my citizenship and become a soviet citizen. i'm going to make known to them all information i have concerning the marine corps and my specialty therein, radar operation...}
<C>__{susie }
<D>__{one of the consuls, john mcvickar, says oswald's performance was not spontaneous it seemed coached. oswald gives an interview to a journalist.}
<A>__{continuing the moscow flashback, we see oswald talking with a female journalist in his small room in the hotel metropole. again he sounds robotic.}
<C>__{oswald}
<D>__{i will never return to the united states for any reason. it is a capitalist country, an exploitive, racist country. i am a marxist since i was 15. i've seen poor niggers and that was a real lesson. people hate because they're told to hate, like school kids. it's the fashion to hate people in the u.s.}
<C>__{susie }
<D>__{the russians are skeptical want to send him back. maybe they suspect he's a spy. he supposedly slashes his wrists in a suicide attempt so that they're forced to keep him, and he disappears for six weeks, presumably with the kgb.}
<A>__{we see photos of the city of minks, in russia, oswald with various friends and tourists, shots of lee and marina with a new baby.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{finally they shuttle him to a radio factory in minks where he lives as high on the hog as he ever has he's given 5,000 rubles, a roomy apartment with a balcony, has affairs with local girls.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{makes sense he's a spokesman.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{but he never writes, speaks, or does any propaganda for the russians. he meets marina, whose uncle is a colonel in soviet intelligence, at a trade union dance; she thinks he's russian the way he speaks, six weeks later they marry, have a daughter.}
<C>__{numa}
<D>__{didn't someone say he didn't speak good russian?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{it's a contradiction, numa, get used to them. the only explanation for the royal treatment is he did give them radar secrets. or fake secrets.}
<A>__{we see documentary shots of the u2 on russian soil... francis gary powers... the summit conference canceled... eisenhower and khrushchev.}
<C>__{susie }
<D>__{i don't know if it's coincidence, but oswald had a top security clearance and knew about the u2 program from his days at atsugi air base in japan. six months after he arrives in russia, francis gary powers' u2 spy flight goes down in russia. that plane was untouchable. powers hinted that oswald could've given the russians enough data to hit it. as a direct result, the peace summit between khrushchev and eisenhower failed. i can't help thinking of that book seven days in may, maybe someone in our military didn't want the peace conference to happen, maybe oswald was part of that. it gets weirder.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{susie, you're an assistant d.a., remember. stick to what you can prove in court.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{you want facts, bill? okay. from 1945 to '59 only two u.s. soldiers defect to russia. from '59 to '60, seven defect, six return, one of them another marine a month before oswald. all of them young men made to seem poor, disenchanted.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{don't get sidetracked! how does he get back to the states? that's the pointerior does he have any problems?}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{none! the state department issues him a new passport in 48 hours and loans him the money to travel. he's never investigated or charged by the navy for revealing classified information or, as far as we know, debriefed by the cia.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{this is a man whose secrets cause us to change our radar patterns in the pacific! he should've been prosecuted as a traitor!}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{the fbi finally gets around to talking to him in dallas and runs a file on him as a miscreant communist type.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{but who meets him when he gets off the boat in new york in june '62?}
<A>__{the screen shows photos of new york: empty docks... a ship coming in... wall street on a sunday morning graphic weegee type black and white stills, then a photo of spas t. raikin.}
<C>__{susie }
<D>__{spas t. raikin, a leading member of an anti communist group.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{and marina? does she have a problem getting out?}
<C>__{susie }
<D>__{none either. it's bizarre. it's next to impossible to get russian sweethearts out. nor does lee have any problem getting a new passport when he wants to go to cuba and russia in '63. a man who has defected once already. it's crazy.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{dammit, it doesn't add up! ordinary people get blacklisted for leftist affiliations! the state department did everything short of dispatching a destroyer to minks to insure oswald's return. only intelligence people can come and go like that.}
<A>__{flashback to a forth worth map factory. we see oswald at work on photo mattes with a minox spy camera. the camera shows close ups of maps and then flashes to a hand in the photographic section. we see a close up of oswald's head in a photograph the same headshot that will be superimposed on the oswald photo and a razor blade cutting mattes.}
<C>__{susie }
<D>__{the next thing we know he's living in dallas ft. worth in october '62 working 6 months at jaggars chiles stovall, a photographic firm that contracts to make maps for the u.s. army... he starts work only days before the government reveals russian missiles in cuba and the crisis explodes. oswald may have had access to missile site footage obtained by the u2 planes and works alongside a young man who'd been in the army security agency.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{sort of like benedict arnold coming back to george washington's cabinet.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{equally incongruous is oswald becoming chummy with the white russian community of dallas all rabid anti communists.}
<A>__{flashback to fort worth in 1963. in oswald's cheap apartment, seven white russians, including george de mohrenschildt, a distinguished grey haired man in his late fifties, are visiting marina and oswald, bringing old dresses, groceries, and toys and milk for the crying baby, whose cradle is two suitcases.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{his closest friend is an oilman named george de mohrenschildt who's about 35 years older than oswald, who's only 23 and supposedly broke. de mohrenschildt is a member of the dallas petroleum club, speaks five languages and was in french vichy intelligence during the war. also rumoured to have been a nazi sympathizer and member of the "solidarists", an international anti communist organization with many eastern europeans and ex nazis, many of them brought here by the cia after the war, many of them involved in oil and munitions interests in dallas and the southwest. you figure it.}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{where'd you get all this nazi stuff?}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(hands him a file)}
<D>__{read it. they called it "project paperclip."}
