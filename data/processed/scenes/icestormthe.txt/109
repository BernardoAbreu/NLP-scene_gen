<D>__{you know, i think elena might suspect something.}
<A>__{janey gives him a rather contemptuous look.}
<C>__{ben }
<P>__{(thinking aloud)}
<D>__{maybe it's all for the better, you know? yesterday, at dinner, well, she hasn't said anything... has she acted funny to you, i mean, have you noticed anything?}
<C>__{janey}
<P>__{(almost ironic)}
<D>__{have i noticed anything? i'm not married to her benjamin, you are. i think you've probably a better vantage point from which to observe her.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{yeah, but, i i've been working a lot lately, and no, that's not it. i guess we've just been on the verge of saying something, whatever it is, just saying something to each other. on the verge.}

<A>__{she leaves the room. he leans back onto the bed. sits back up. takes a sip of vodka. puts the glass down. takes his socks off. he's now in just his jockey shorts and shirt. faintly, he hears a door close. the front door? he takes another sip. he hears another sound.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{janey?}
<A>__{nothing. he goes to the door and carefully opens it.}
<C>__{ben }
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{janey?}
<A>__{he hears, quite audibly, a car door open, close, janey's car start and pull out. he runs to a front window just in time to catch a glimpse of her driving off.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{shit.}
