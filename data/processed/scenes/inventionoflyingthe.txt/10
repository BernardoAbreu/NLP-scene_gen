<C>__{mark}
<D>__{how do you spend your days?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i get up at eight in the morning because the noise from my alarm clock interrupts my sleep, so i lean over and...}

<C>__{mark}
<D>__{do you enjoy it?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{no. but i enjoy the end result of the job which is money. and the hours are pretty good for the amount of money i make, which i spend on things i like, such as clothes, hiking, drinking even though i know it's bad for me.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{but i'd rather just get all the money and not work for the results.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{sure. tell me more. i'm trying to get a little insight into you.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{well you already know a lot about me. you know i'm good looking because... well... here i am. you know i'm successful because you've seen my apartment and the clothes i'm wearing. and you know i'm happy because i'm smiling.}
<A>__{jennifer smiles brightly.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{are you always happy?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{usually. some days i stay in bed eating and crying.}

<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm ready.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i will have a caesar salad with chicken because i think i'm fat but i also think i deserve something that tastes good.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i will have the fish taco's because i had them once here and it's all i know.}

<D>__{sorry, one second.}
<A>__{she pulls out her cell phone and checks it.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{it's my mother, this won't take long. probably checking in on our date.}
<A>__{jennifer answers the phone. she talks openly and in plain view of mark.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{hello? yes, i'm with him right now. no, not very attractive. no, doesn't make much money. he's all right though. seems nice. kind of funny. a bit fat. funny little snub nose. no, i won't be sleeping with him tonight. nope, probably not even a kiss. okay, you too. bye.}

<C>__{mark}
<D>__{fantastic.}
<A>__{time cut: later that night both of their plates are now empty. three empty margarita glasses sit in front of jennifer. the waiter approaches with the bill and places it down in the middle of the table.}
