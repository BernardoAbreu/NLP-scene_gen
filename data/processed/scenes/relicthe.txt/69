<L>__{interior osteological preparation area day}
<A>__{it looks more like a bizarre industrial kitchen than anything else. deep stainless steel tanks line one wall. on the ceiling near the tanks hang massive pulleys and grappling hooks for the larger carcasses. in a far corner of the workshop is a stainless steel gurney bearing a dead gorilla. a pink faced eighty year old man is working on the carcass with sharp tools. this is don osterbaan.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{did you ever wonder where we get all our skeletons? this is the laboratory where animal carcasses are reduced to bones.}
<P>__{(to osterbaan)}
<D>__{what's cooking today, don?}
<C>__{don}
<D>__{zebra.}
<A>__{frock looks into a large maceration tank with pendergast and d'agosta. a zebra carcass can be seen under the muddy surface, its flesh and soft tissues falling off.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{man, that's ripe.}
<A>__{frock now opens the door on a humid closet adjacent to the main room. inside on a stainless steel table lies the corpse of a fox. it's crawling with black beetles which are devouring it. d'agosta and pendergast watch the grizzly scene, properly impressed.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{dermestid beetles. the second method of preparing a skeleton, used in natural history museums world wide. bugs are clean and highly efficient. they'll polish that fox off in no time.}
<A>__{as don casually peels back the gorilla's whole face exposing the skull...}
<C>__{osterbaan}
<D>__{want to have a look at a gorilla brain? got one right here.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{thanks don. we're in a hurry. some other time.}
