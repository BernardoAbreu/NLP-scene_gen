<L>__{exterior lawns, country estate night}
<A>__{the guests have formed themselves into a huge audience, the orchestra strikes up "happy birthday" as parrish appears with allison. an enormous cake is unveiled with one great, lit candle, parrish beams then laughs. he pauses over the cake, now blows the candle out. applause, cries of "speech! speech!", parrish tries to demur but the request becomes loud and rhythmic, he holds up his hand, nods, quiets the crowd. joe observes from the fringe.}
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(to the guests)}
<D>__{i thought i was going to sneak away tonight...}
<A>__{yells of "no!" "never!"}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{...what a glorious night, every face i see is a memory. it may not be a perfectly perfect memory sometimes we had our ups and downs but we're all together, and you're mine for a night.}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{ and i'm going to break precedent, and tell you my one candle wish that you would have a life as lucky as mine, where you can wake up one morning and say "i don't want anything more."}
<P>__{(another moment)}
<D>__{sixty five years don't they go by in a blink?}
<A>__{parrish hesitates, waves and steps away, applause that grows into cheers, the music resumes, another dance tune. quince grabs him, pumps his hand and claps him on the back. now parrish spots allison, he wraps her in a tight embrace, they hold each other close for a moment, but then are separated by a surge of guests. parrish sees susan, she smiles but there is a tinge of sadness about her. he heads towards her, they are somehow situated as if they were alone in this crowd.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{what a night.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i'm having a helluva time.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you were right about joe, he is going somewhere }
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{susan is examining parrish very closely.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{are you relieved?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{yes, but }
<A>__{parrish hesitates.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{but what?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i want you to know how much i love you. that you've given a meaning to my life that i had no right to expect, and that no one can ever take from me.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{daddy }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{no i love you so much and i want you to promise me something. i don't want you to ever worry about me. if anything should happen, i'm going to be fine and everything's going to be all right.}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{ and i have no regrets.}
<A>__{susan is in pain now, she can't summon an answer.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{and i want you to feel that way, too.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i love you, daddy }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{that's why it's okay.}
<A>__{they drift into silence.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{no regrets?}
<A>__{after a moment.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{'no regrets'.}
<A>__{a long silence, susan smiles.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{it's a good feeling, isn't it?}
<A>__{silence again.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{everybody's saying goodbye...}
<A>__{they regard each other, a long pause, they have reached an understanding.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i'm still here.}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{would you like to dance with me, susan?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{oh, yes }
<A>__{he starts to lead her to the floor, immediately stops.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{if you don't mind dancing with an old fogey like me.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{oh, dad, you're not old. you'll never be old.}
<A>__{he takes her in his arms and they dance away.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{on a distant fringe of the party, a grass terrace that still commands a view of the dance floor, is joe. his eyes are on parrish and susan, he watches them admiringly yet ruefully. a waiter passes, catches sight of joe, stops.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{can i get you anything, sir?}
<A>__{joe regards the waiter for a moment.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{do you have any peanut butter?}
<A>__{the waiter hesitates.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{i don't think so, sir.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{thank you, anyway.}
<A>__{the waiter moves off. joe's attention returns to parrish and susan, the dance number ends, a boom.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{on the dance floor.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{the fireworks are about to start.}
<A>__{parrish looks up, sees joe up on the terrace, waiting.}
<C>__{susan }
<P>__{(to parrish)}
<D>__{shall we?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{you go ahead, honey, i'm going to catch my breath.}
<A>__{suddenly he hugs her, holds her very close. she looks at him, he smiles, nods, but doesn't release her until she smiles back. now she heads out with the crowd for the fireworks. when parrish senses she is on her way, he turns and heads up towards joe. joe rises to meet parrish as he approaches.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{happy birthday, bill.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{they watch the guests gathering to view the fireworks. joe's gaze lingers.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{did you say goodbye?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{not exactly.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i guess you have your reasons.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{now that we have a moment, would you mind if i expressed my gratitude for what you did for susan?}
<A>__{joe waits.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{i never heard her speak of any man as she spoke of you it was always what i wanted for her but what happens to her now?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i wouldn't worry about it, bill. these things have a way of working out.}
<A>__{joe regards parrish, waits until he has a sense that parrish has accepted what joe has said, then joe continues:}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{and would you mind if i expressed my gratitude...?}
<A>__{parrish waits.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{for you. for the time you've given me. for the person you are.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{don't blow smoke up my ass, you'll ruin my autopsy.}
<A>__{joe barely manages a smile, now looks back longingly at the crowd below, searching.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{it's hard to let go, isn't it?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{that's life. what can i tell you?}
<A>__{a silence, an understanding there is another more to say. joe looks inquiringly at parrish as if to say "shall we?", parrish nods and joe turns with him. they set off now away from the party, up a meadow that leads to a hill overlooking the river.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{down below, the party guests' faces are lit by the initial fireworks display. among them is susan, but her interest isn't there. not something pulls her attention, an over powering feeling that compels her to turn and see, at a distance, parrish and joe walking away up the meadow. some thing about the sight saddens and at the same time frightens her, she turns back to the party, dazed, tracing on the fireworks.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{up the hill parrish's step slows, joe slowing with him.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i'm getting a little dizzy, i can feel my heart pumping }
<A>__{but parrish doesn't wait for a response, just continues on up the meadow, towards the rise of the hill, joe in step with him.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{should i be afraid?}
<A>__{joe stops, parrish stops with him.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{not a man like you.}
<A>__{parrish smiles faintly, takes a deep breath, he strides out again, joe right with him. in tandem they continue on and disappear over the crest of the hill. a barrage of fireworks lights up the sky.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{down below, susan, in a pained reflex, again turns and looks up towards the hill. there is nobody there. she hesitates, now glides away from the party, her step quickens as she walks up towards the hill. susan halts, in the distance a figure is approaching from over the crest of the hill where joe and parrish disappeared. he is heading straight for her, she tries to make him out, seems to recognize him, starts to walk towards him as if pulled by a magnet. now she stops again. it is a man, he keeps coming, and now that he is close and recognizes him.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{joe...?}
<A>__{he smiles quizzically, hasn't quite heard her, stands right in front of her, loose, smiling, disoriented and yet so appealing. they are riveted on each other, uneasy and yet close.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{you're here...}
<A>__{he is trying to get his bearings.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{ you bet.}
<A>__{something about him makes susan slightly tentative.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{where did you go?}
<A>__{joe shrugs, scratches his head endearingly, uncertain of time and place.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i don't know y'know, i don't know it's all blurred up and hazy. and would y'know what i mean if i said i don't think it's worth figuring out?}
<A>__{some realization is dawning on susan, it renders her lightheaded.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{...but now i'm back.}
<A>__{susan regards joe intently, searching his face for an answer.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{that's it?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well, i don't know what else to say. it's a helluva party }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you think so?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yeah...and you're the prettier thing here.}
<A>__{susan blinks, a long silence, she touches the sleeve of his jacket, now her hand traces the outline of his face, she regards him intently and the dilemma she has been struggling with the last moments fades away. susan slowly realizes this is the young man. she is shaken, a sudden intake of breath.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{hey, you all right?}
<A>__{his hand politely touches her elbow, courteously lending her support.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{the coffee shop }
<A>__{the young man nods, pleased with her recognition.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{i asked you if i said something wrong and you said it was so right it scared you.}
<A>__{susan holds herself very still.}
<C>__{young man }
<D>__{and forgive me for saying this but then you said and it's been with me ever since }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{what has ?}
<A>__{he hesitates.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{you said you liked me.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{no }
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{y'didn't?}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i said i liked you so much.}
<A>__{she falls silent now, overcome by the last moments' revelations. the young man senses her discomfort which is on the edge of pain.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{hey, everything's going great don't y'think?}
<A>__{she doesn't answer for a moment.}
<C>__{young man }
<D>__{don't you feel that way?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{...we know so little about each other.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{but we've got time.}
<A>__{she searches the young man's eyes, his face is open, completely vulnerable, waiting for her response. a long silence, the words come out haltingly:}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i wish you could've known my father...}
<A>__{another moment.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{me, too.}
<A>__{susan signs, the young man smiles gently, they are completely intent on each other.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{...what do we do now?}
<A>__{a long silence.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{it will come to us.}
<A>__{susan smiles, the fireworks finale goes off, the music comes up from below, the night fills with light. the young man searches susan's face, now takes her hand and together they start back towards the party.}
<B>__{the end}
