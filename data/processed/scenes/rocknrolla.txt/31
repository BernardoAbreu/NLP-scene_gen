<A>__{two guys are here counting money. meet roman and mickey, two black americans. (mid 30s dressed very classy, with a bit of an urban twist) they are in the managing game, exploiting the talents of the english. the sound of distant bass thudding through the walls can be heard while mickey is on the phone trying to do some kind of business. a real rocker with long hair and good looks comes walking in distressed.}
<C>__{rocker}
<D>__{i need the dry ice mickey, i need the dry ice. my show just doesn't work without it.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(hand over the receiver)}
<D>__{if you told me yesterday you needed dry ice, i would have gotten you the driest ice the world could offer, but you didn't ask for no dry ice. you asked for two cases of johnny walker black label and four ladies of the pole and i got them for you didn't i?}
<A>__{there's a pause from the rocker.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{didn't i?}
<C>__{rocker}
<D>__{yes you did i do confess, but mickey, you're the manager and i am the rocker. you've got on the managers hat, now pluck something out of it.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{my hat is deep and full of magic. i got rabbits, handkerchiefs, and ladies of the pole drinking black label. i got smoke machines, bubble machines, i even got love marines and still the hat goes deeper, but....there ain't no mother fuckin dry ice.}
<C>__{rock n roller}

<P>__{(he turns on his way out)}
<D>__{but tomorrow, i need dry ice.}
<A>__{roman looks up from his paper, having not got involved in the slightest. roman taps the paper he has been reading.}
<C>__{roman}
<D>__{have you read this?}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{he reads out the headlines.}
<C>__{roman}
<D>__{johnny story singer extraordinaire, fell off a boat, they say. missing, assumed dead, they say.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{what,..our johnny?}
<C>__{roman}
<D>__{how many rock stars by the name of johnny story do you think there are in this universe mickey?}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{the only thing he's fallen off is his junkies spoon, he's no deader than the suit you're wearing now. he'll be gearing himself up somewhere happy as clam in a fisherman's net. rockers like that never die, they just wither and give me pain.}
