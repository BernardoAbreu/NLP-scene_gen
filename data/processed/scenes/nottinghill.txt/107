<A>__{tony's brave face breaks. the dream is over.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{i just want to say to tony don't take it personally. the more i think about things, the more i see no rhyme or reason in life no one knows why some things work out, and some things don't why some of us get lucky and some of us...}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{... get fired.}

<C>__{max}
<D>__{there's an understatement. there are dead people on better form.}
