<T>__{cut to: later:}
<A>__{the crowd is breaking up. first cop walks helen to the ladies' room. people reach to shake helen's hand; she copes as well as she can with her fear. they leave the stage}
<B>__{through a door opening to a corridor leading back to}
<A>__{dressing rooms and a ladies' room...}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior ladies' room day}
<A>__{the cop, clearly embarrassed, pokes his head in and looks around. under one stall he sees a woman's high heels. he hastily ducks back into hall and signals an okay to helen. before the door behind her closes, we see the cop prepare to stand guard outside. helen walks past the stall with the high heels to a stall several doors down.}
<T>__{close up high heels:}
<A>__{and a tattoo that the cop missed seeing on one of the ankles. the shoes are kicked off. the feet disappear from view as helen, a few stalls away, methodically places toilet paper around the seat before raising her skirt. a faint noise makes her freeze. her hand reaches for the door. she is just able to unlock it, but no more, before a noise comes}
<B>__{down from the next stall.}
<A>__{like a lariat it falls over helen's head and is violently yanked tight. she kicks at the stall door. corridor: cop, leaning against outside door smoking, hears the clang of metal as the stall door bangs open. he reacts... the red headed man is struggling to secure the rope around a hook inside his own stall. knocking (o.s.)}
<C>__{cop }
<D>__{doctor hudson? are you okay in there?}
<A>__{the man lets slip a little slack. helen's fingers, thrusting between the rope and her neck, get just enough air for helen to let out a strangled little scream. corridor: cop, not certain what to do about the ambiguous sounds from inside. women stands nearby, inhibiting him for a split second from going in the ladies' room door. now there is more sound from inside...}
