<L>__{108 109 omit 108 109 exterior beach day}
<A>__{the foursome sit back on the wide beach, one facing each direction, keeping watch. a light rain is falling, but they don't seem to notice. trying to keep his boy's spirit up...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you remember when we went fishing last summer? and i was trying to put the boat in and the trailer sank? and then the tow truck came and tried to pull it out, but it got dragged in? and the truck driver threatened to knock your dad's lights out? so i said i was the governor and he believed me?}
<A>__{eric really smiles, remembering the day.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{amanda is smiling too. she had completely forgotten the incident.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{that was a fun day.}
<A>__{to paul, after some consideration....}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{we should try fishing again.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you mean it?}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{i do. it's worth another shot. and who knows? things might turn out differently.}
<A>__{her hand takes his, gently brushing off the wet sand, fingertips touching. it's a small thing, but it's a start. sensing his cue to leave, grant gets up and starts walking down the beach. eric hurries to follow him. he speaks conspiratorially, not wanting to alarm his parents.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{the lady you called, how do you know she can help us?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{she's the one person i could always count on. and she's saved me more times than she realizes. i owe her everything.}
<A>__{a long beat as they walk.}
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{it's strikes me now i never told her that.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{you should.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{you're right.}
<A>__{as they keep walking, grant notices something rammed against the rocks ahead. it's a speedboat, its hull ripped open from the impact. and it's not just any boat either it's the same dino soar boat that was pulling the parasail. eric hasnt seen it yet, so grant stops him.}
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{eric, do you know what happened to the boat? that brought you here? why did it crash?}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{no. i couldn't see.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{do me a favor. go back to your parents for a minute, would you?}
<P>__{(pre empting objections)}
<D>__{they look worried.}
<A>__{eric nods and heads back to paul and amanda. grant forges on, approaching the speedboat wreckage. he doesn't know what he'll find, but he needs to look. almost reaching his parents, eric stops. looks out over the ocean, where he sees}
<B>__{two lights.}
<A>__{he doesn't say anything for a moment, trying to make sure they're real. they are. and they're coming closer.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{mom! dad!}
<A>__{they look up to see the distant lights, just now making out full forms...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{helicopters. helicopters!}
<A>__{he shouts with joy. paul, amanda and eric wave their arms, making as much motion as possible. the helicopters big military choppers change direction, heading straight for them. paul and amanda embrace, then kiss, the moment getting the best of them}
<B>__{at the speedboat}
<A>__{grant looks in, prepared to see anything in the wreckage. but the cabin is surprisingly intact, just a little blood. there are three gashes on the driver's seat back. grant measures their spacing with his fingers.}
<C>__{eric}
<P>__{(yelling over)}
<D>__{dr. grant! helicopters are coming!}
<A>__{grant looks down to the wet sand around him, finding a trail of three toed tracks.}
<C>__{eric }
<D>__{we're safe!}
<C>__{grant}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{no we're not.}
<B>__{the first chopper.}
<A>__{flies right overhead. paul and amanda are confused, until the second helicopter starts to land the first on is there to cover them. grant yells at the first chopper, trying to wave it away. but the noise of the blades is deafending.}
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{no! stay back! they're in the trees!}
<A>__{at the treeline, the upper branches are shaking. at first, it looks like it's just the wind off the chopper, but something more is happening.}
<B>__{a pteranodon}
<A>__{flies up out of the trees, the first of twenty. it's a gorgeous and terrifying sight.}
