<A>__{demidov circles cara dangerously close.}
<C>__{demidov}
<D>__{not very polite of your boyfriend to keep you waiting.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{he loses track of time easily.}
<C>__{demidov}
<D>__{i have a hard time believing that.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{perhaps he's already here somewhere... hiding... even watching us.}
<B>__{inside the church}
<D>__{demidov (v.o.) (cont'd) what do you think?}
<A>__{a long silence. the tension grows. then we hear...}
<B>__{a loud slap.}
<A>__{everyone in the room flinches.}
<D>__{demidov (v.o.) (cont'd) you know... i have a feeling he is around here somewhere. and if he cares about you... if he wants to see your lovely face again... he should show up before it's too late.}
<A>__{another slap more vicious than the first. this time cara cries out in pain. goyal turns to ackerman.}
<C>__{goyal}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{ackerman}
<D>__{demidov's right. he's here somewhere...}
<A>__{another slap. another scream. jean luc looks to his colleagues jones, quinn... then turns to ackerman. every one of them is about to burst.}
<C>__{jean luc}
<D>__{we have to do something }
<C>__{ackerman}
<D>__{we have to wait.}
<C>__{jean luc}
<D>__{yes but }
<C>__{ackerman}
<P>__{(harsh)}
<D>__{she's my agent. she's my responsibility.}
<A>__{a muffled thud. cara groans and we hear her body hit the floor. that wasn't a slap. every cop in the room is clenching his weapon. desperate for the order to move. to jump in and stop this. they are all looking to ackerman to give the order. as the silence wears on, even jones starts to waver. she speaks quietly to ackerman.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{what if he doesn't come?}
<A>__{ackerman doesn't respond. the lack of sound in the church is even more disturbing than before. suddenly goyal notices...}
<C>__{goyal}
<D>__{where's taylor?}
