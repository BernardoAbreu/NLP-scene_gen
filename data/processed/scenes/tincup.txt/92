<A>__{tin cup drags his sorry ass to the group.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{unless it's a 'swing thought,' i'm not interested...}
<C>__{doreen}
<P>__{(ignoring his attitude)}
<D>__{we're here to sponsor you in the open. me an' the boys have pooled our resources and come up with some cash so you can look and feel as spiffy as all them big name pros.}

<D>__{yeah, and you obviously still have a hard on for the doctor chick your face is all screwed up and tight like you haven't been laid in awhile }
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{is it really that obvious?}
<C>__{doreen}
<D>__{it's not a good look for you. roy, your heart is not the only organ you wear on your sleeve. there's a certain, vulgar appeal to your transparency.}
<A>__{tin cup shrugs. she always has him outflanked.}
<C>__{clint}
<D>__{c'mon, tin cup, we're trying to make you a presentation }
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{awright, awright...}
<A>__{she unwraps a tour golf bag big gold and red lettering advertises "the golden tassel." pastie tassels hang from all over the bag. doreen sets it down proudly.}
<C>__{doreen}
<D>__{i got the golden tassel to sponsor you at the open.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{you expect me to pack that around?}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{i'm carrying the bag.}
<C>__{doreen}
<D>__{it's worth four hundred dollars endorsement money to you }
<A>__{earl steps forward with a golf shirt bedecked with sewn on patches and logos.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{see, dewey got you first state banking of salome, and clint got you short haul trucking and i got you brink and brown sanitation }
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i'm being sponsored by a sewage disposal system?}

<D>__{we call it human resources management, roy, please...}
<A>__{jose steps forward with a golf cap, also emblazoned.}
<C>__{jose}
<D>__{i've got wally's smokehouse for ya kind of a nice sign...}
<C>__{dewey}
<D>__{and since i couldn't get the post office to come aboard, me and my girl friend muriel's gonna buy a fan club patch you can put anywhere you want.}

<D>__{this shit is us, man. you can't win without us.}
<C>__{doreen}
<D>__{you're the pride of salome!}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{hell, i won't even make the cut!}
<C>__{doreen}
<D>__{what happened to your confidence?}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{he's shanking his love life so he's shanking the golf ball.}
<C>__{doreen}
<D>__{must be true love.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{he's a goner.}
<A>__{tin cup surveys all the bizarre sponsorship loot, and starts loosening up. these are his people, after all, and they're behind him all the way.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{look, everybody, this is great. i'm sorry i'm acting so pathetic but my swing's never abandoned me before. i just need a little time to work it out.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{anything you want }
<C>__{clint}
<D>__{give him some room, boys }
<C>__{tin cup}
<P>__{(to anyone who'll listen)}
<D>__{maybe it's my grip... maybe i'm opening up too soon... too late... coming over the top... no, dropping underneath...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{oh, sweet jesus, why have you abandoned me?}
<C>__{doreen}
<P>__{(to the regulars)}
<D>__{he's trying to talk to god. it's time for us to go.}
<A>__{doreen and the regulars quietly slip away to leave tin cup with his newly sponsored gifts and, more importantly, his newly lost grip, swing, and confidence.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{you want me to stay, boss?}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i need to be alone.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{you got it.}
<A>__{and romeo herds the rest of them out to their cars in the lot. and as they drive away, tin cup sits down, his head in his hands.}
