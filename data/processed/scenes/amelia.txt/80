<A>__{a taxi slowly pulls up to the home we know. warmly lit, music playing from within. gene climbs from the cab, as yard lights go on. as gene starts up the path, the front door opens and amelia bursts into the night, running to gene, jumping into his arms, hugging him in her delight. we pull back to... george watching it all from the doorway. his easy smile seems comfortably in place, as... ...amelia walks gene up the path, her arm around his waist, talking excitedly, flushed as a schoolgirl. as they reach the door... george is the picture of calm and dignity. he beams and clasps gene's hand. throws an arm around his shoulder as amelia leads them inside. the door closes. we hear laughter.}
