<L>__{exterior long country lane and holding camp day}
<A>__{spring. idyllic. a column of men and women stretching along the length of the lane. a couple of horse and carts. one or two bicycles. some of the people wear concentration camp garb, others in tattered clothing. four men walk together and when they come to a narrow junction, stop, seeing something behind barbed wire, german prisoners of war, guarded by russian soldiers. desolate place. no shelters, no tents. the pows sit or lie on the ground, silent, broken, shattered. the four men gaze at them. :}
<D>__{1st man look at them bastards! 2nd man german fuckers! 3rd man i prayed for this, never thought i'd see it.}
<A>__{the fourth man, zygmunt lednicki, approaches the barbed wire.}

<D>__{murderers! assassins! look at you now! you took everything i had! me, a musician!}
<P>__{(wagging his finger fiercely)}
<D>__{you took my violin! you took my soul!}
<A>__{he stands glowering at them, then sees a pow rise from a group, wretched, shabby, unshaven. it's the german captain, uniform tattered, a wreck. he comes to the barbed wire.}
<C>__{the german captain}
<P>__{(urgent) (in german)}
<D>__{do you happen to know another musician, a mr szpilman? a pianist! polish radio?}

<D>__{i helped mr szpilman when he was in hiding. tell him i'm here. ask him to help me...}
<A>__{a russian guard, inside the compound, approaches, grabs hold of the german captain.}
<C>__{russian guard}
<P>__{(to lednicki, in russian)}
<D>__{hey! no talking to the prisoners. get away from there!}
<A>__{he drags the german captain away from the wire.}
<C>__{lednicki}
<P>__{(as he backs away, calling)}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<A>__{the german captain is being bundled away by the guard, who aims a kick at him. the german captain shouts out his name but it's unintelligible.}
<C>__{lednicki}
<D>__{what?}
