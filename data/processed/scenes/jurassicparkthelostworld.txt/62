<A>__{now really upset, the animal panics and lashes out in all directions, blasting through tents, demolishing and or setting ablaze anything that gets in its way. its considerable hindquarters slam into a parked jeep, sending it rolling across the camp. the jeep flattens the largest tent and slams down on its side. its broken gas line sprays gas over the ground, the gas hits one of the dozens of small blazes the triceratops has left in its wake, and the flame shoots up the ribbon of gas. the jeep explodes. out in the jungle clearing, roland and ajay, up in the tree, leap to their feet as a fireball rises up from the camp in the distance.}

<A>__{back in the camp, the rest of the newly freed animals now storm through the camp. the blue laser barriers bounce crazily and go out as the sending units are trampled underfoot by the fleeing animals. at the ridge of camp, nick takes advantage of the downed lasers to slip part the bordere of the camp and disappear into the jungle in one direction, while malcolm and sarah vanish in the other. the burning tent, which was the equipment tent, now detonates in a series of smaller explosions. dieter and several others are knocked to the ground by the series of concessive blasts. he drags himself up onto all fours, charred and bruised. a burning tire rolls slowly past him, spinning to a stop at roland's feet. dieter looks up at him.}

<A>__{he goes to the animal, which now bleats in pain, its broken leg hanging at an odd angle. with one strong tug, nick pulls the stake out of the ground. back in the camp, roland surveys the destruction. the fire has spread and several tents are now tongues of flame flapping in the air, the animals are gone or going, and their personnel are scattered and terrified. peter ludlow, breathless, face smeared with dirt, and smoke, staggers up to roland.}
