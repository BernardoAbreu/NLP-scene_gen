<L>__{exterior bad neighborhood night}
<A>__{darby runs like an amped up rat in a maze, hearing cop cars in the night: engines roaring, tires squealing... suddenly, the sound of a helicopter above. darby dashes for cover against a garage, lost in shadow. a massively bright searchlight sweeps from above, probing... darby crouches, heart hammering, watching the searchlight scan over rooftops. his phone rings, he answers:}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{ditch the gun. wipe the prints.}
<C>__{darby}
<D>__{kiss my ass.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{i heard six shots. revolver? bring extra ammo?}
<A>__{darby glances at the gun, realizing. he bangs his head back against the garage wall in frustration fuck!}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{you shot at cops. that's attempted murder if they find the gun on you. you're in deep enough without that.}
<A>__{darby frantically wipes the gun with his shirttail, as:}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{you'll need my help getting out.}
<C>__{darby}
<D>__{what'll it cost me?}
<C>__{voice}

<C>__{darby}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{'cause i tasered his ass. you gonna keep asking questions?}
<A>__{click line dead. darby breaks cover, heaves the gun into somebody's yard, keeps moving...}
