<A>__{to group of tables with diners. at one of them sits a wealthy looking older woman with a rather plain looking daughter in her 20s. the older woman is easily distinguished from the other clientele by a large bandage that covers a goodish part of her head. the two of them (the mother and daughter, not the mother and bandage) are perusing the menus. sam notes the daughter, unpleased.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{mother, i thought we were going to be able to talk .... oh god, she's got what's he name with her.}
<A>__{sam and his mother arrive at the table.}

<D>__{not yet.}
<P>__{(to sam and mother)}
<D>__{happy christmas, sam.}
<A>__{she hands sam a gaily wrapped package which obviously contains the same executive toy.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{sorry we're late. shall we order? get it out of the way. what are you going to have alma?}
<A>__{she starts to hunt through the huge menu the maitre d has just handed her with full colour photos of the splendid dishes available.}
<C>__{mrs terrain}
<D>__{i can't make up my mind whether to have a number one or a number two. what do you recommend, spiro?}
<C>__{spiro}
<P>__{(conspiratorially)}
<D>__{between you and me, madam, today the number two.}
<C>__{mrs terrain}
<D>__{thank you, spiro. shirley, what are you going to have?}
<C>__{shirley}
<P>__{(panics quietly)}
<C>__{spiro}
<P>__{(conspiratorially)}
<D>__{between you and me, mademoiselle, today the number one. madam lowry?}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{oh, to hell with the diet, a number eight, please.}
<C>__{spiro}
<D>__{a most perceptive choice, madam, if i may say so.}
<P>__{(to sam)}
<D>__{monsieur?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(brusquely)}
<D>__{a steak, please. rare.}
<P>__{(to his mother)}
<D>__{mother, i need to ...}
<C>__{spiro}
<P>__{(piqued)}
<D>__{monsieur. quel numero.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(handing back menu)}
<D>__{i don't know which numero.}
<C>__{spiro}
<P>__{(writing on pad)}
<D>__{numero, trois.}
<A>__{everyone is a bit embarrassed here. mother gives sam a withering look. spiro stalks away.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(trying to restart things)}
<D>__{alma, you wicked thing ...}
<P>__{(indicating bandages)}
<D>__{you've started your treatment.}
<C>__{mrs terrain}
<D>__{you noticed.}
<P>__{(enthusiastically)}
<D>__{i must tell you all about it.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(to his mother)}
<D>__{mother, will you listen to}
<A>__{at this moment the food arrives. spiro elaborately lifts off the silver covers and with a flourish distributes the plates of food. each order looks identical a big splodge of brown lumpy stuff. the only differences between the lumps are the identifying photographs on sticks stuck in each. the beautiful colour photos match the photos which were on the menus.}
<C>__{spiro}
<P>__{(showing off that he}
<D>__{remembers who's ordered}
<P>__{what)}
<D>__{numero huit, braised veal in wine sauce.}
<P>__{(he sets it in front of sam's mother)}
<C>__{mrs terrain}
<D>__{it's too exciting. i've left dr jaffe and gone to dr. chapman.}
<C>__{spiro}
<D>__{numero deux, duck a l'orange.}
<P>__{(he sets it in front of mrs terrain)}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{the acid man?}
<C>__{mrs terrain}
<D>__{really, ida, just because his techniques are revolutionary ... i don't go around calling dr jaffe the knife man.}
<C>__{spiro}
<D>__{numero une, crevettes a la mayonaaise.}
<P>__{(he sets it in front of shirley)}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{i'm sorry alma, i didn't mean to sound so ...}
<C>__{mrs terrain}
<D>__{that's all right ida ... it's just that he's such an artist. to him, cutting is so crude ... so primitive.}
<C>__{spiro}
<D>__{numero trois, steak.}
<P>__{(he sets this in front of sam)}
<D>__{monsieur, mesdames, bon appetit.}
<C>__{all but sam}
<D>__{merci.}
<C>__{mrs terrain}
<D>__{acid on the other hand, can be used for such wonderfully subtle shading, such delicate nuances just like a rembrant etching ... and it's so much quicker. why, if it weren't for a teensy weensy complication the doctor said it could have happened to anyone i would have had these bandages off yesterday.}
<C>__{shirley}
<P>__{(to sam, after attracting}
<D>__{her mother's attention and}
<P>__{receiving a nod)}
<D>__{salt?}
<A>__{they are just about to dip into their respective splodges when there is a terrific explosion a huge hole is blasted out of the wall to the kitchen. chaos erupts around the carnage as waiters try putting out the flames with extinguishers. people, bloody and dying, are moaning. the diners not actually affected by the blast look up for a moment and then, with a few raised eyebrows, go back to their meals.}
<B>__{immediately after the explosion.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{what were we saying?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(picking bomb debris out of his brown lump)}
<D>__{this isn't rare!}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{by the way, i saw a wonderful idea for christmas presents at the chemists. gift tokens. medical gift tokens.}
<C>__{mrs terrain}
<D>__{oh, that sounds marvellous.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{yes, they're good at any doctor's and at many of the major hospitals and they're accepted for gynecological complications including caesarian section.}
<A>__{sam, in the act of taking in another forkful of his unappetising meal, drops his form in disgust}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{look please i'm sorry but honestly, mother, this is }
<C>__{mother.}
<D>__{i quite agree! it's impossible!}
<A>__{mother raises her arm to gain the attention of the maitre d who is frantically trying to deal with the emergency. the activity in the background has increased throughout the conversation. the fire brigade has arrived with sirens blaring. ministry troops have charged in and are arresting waiters. stretchers have been bought in for the injured and these are being rushed past our little group's table. the maitre d comes to the table, his dj now blood spattered.}
<C>__{maitre d}
<D>__{i am sorry, madam ... i don't know what to say ... this very rarely happens to us i will do what i can straight away}
<A>__{he hurries away.}
<C>__{mrs terrain}
<D>__{really, sam when are you going to do something about these terrorists?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what? now? it's my lunch hour.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{actually, alma, that's one of the little things i was dying to tell you ... sam's been promoted to information retrieval.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(angry and surprised)}
<D>__{mother!}
<C>__{mrs terrain}
<D>__{oh that's wonderful! congratulations sam...}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{you can show those fucking murderous bastards a thing or two.}
<C>__{mrs terrain}
<P>__{(shocked and embarrassed)}
<D>__{shirley!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{stop this!}
<P>__{(leaping to his feet)}
<D>__{i'm not being promoted. i'm not going to information retrieval!}
<P>__{(he scrumples promotion}
<D>__{notification which he has been holding and throws it}
<P>__{on the floor)}
<D>__{if i want you to stick your oar in, mother, i will tell you where to stick it!}
<A>__{everybody is shocked. he recovers his composure slightly. embarrassed, he bends, and picks up the ball of paper which he starts smoothing back into its flat state.}
<C>__{shirley}
<P>__{(back to her uncertain form)}
<D>__{pepper...?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{look i've got to get back }
<A>__{as sam goes, maitre d reappears with a group of waiters those remaining unarrested whom he has organised to gut up a folding screen around the table. this cuts of the sight if not the noise of the victims of the explosion.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{sam ... you haven't had dessert.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i don' t want dessert. i don't want promotion. i don't want anything.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{don't be childish, samuel. of course you want something. you must have hopes, wishes, dreams.}
<A>__{their voices have been rising towards a shout in order to rise above the volume of the growing chaos around them.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(shouts loud)}
<D>__{no, nothing. not even dreams!}
