<A>__{before. the postman tries the station door. locked. smiling ironically, he steps in through the blown out window.}
<L>__{interior 76 station office day}
<A>__{a shambles. the postman kicks around the table. he finds a few beat up cds, flips through them. reads the label.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{'running on empty'? tell me about it.}
<A>__{tossing it, he turns, stops. there, resting on a pile of trash is a bashed in portable tv. the postman smiles.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{hey, bill! we got tv! 147 channels. everything from jesus to 'jeopardy'.}
<A>__{he steps over, switches on the set. nothing happens, but the postman pretends just the same. he mimics static, then:}

<A>__{the postman stops suddenly. click.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{we interrupt our regularly scheduled program to bring you the second civil war... well, shit.}
<A>__{the postman stares at the blank screen a moment. there's a sudden, panicked rustling from behind the service manager's desk. the postman wheels around, raises the carbine.}

<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{look out, bill!}
<A>__{the doe bolts for the window and runs right into bill. bill has a conniption fit. investigating further, the postman spots a cigarette machine. the front glass is smashed and all the slots are empty. but he looks down to the lock at the bottom. it's intact. he pulls a crowbar from the sack, crouches by the machine and digs the pry into a seam and pulls. the panel bursts open to reveal four half open cartons of cigarettes. he doesn't believe it for a second. then:}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i'm rich.}
