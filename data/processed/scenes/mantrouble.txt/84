<L>__{exterior adele's front lawn late day}
<A>__{adele stands playing a garden hose over the lawn. two pop eyed little dogs yap and mill about her legs. in the b.g., harry's van can be seen in the driveway, and presently he appears from the side of the house, carrying a suitcase and a few items of clothes. as he moves to the van and opens the door, her attention is drawn to him:}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{harry! what the hell do you think you're doing?}
<A>__{he sets the suitcase down, lays the clothes over it and crosses the lawn to her:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i just got a phone call, honey, from a prominent entertainer up in vegas, a very well known singer...}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{who is it, paul anka?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{he's a rock star, you probably wouldn't know the name. anyway, i gotta run a couple a dogs up to him...}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{you know, it's t minus zero and counting, harry, on this whole shitty deal.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{now iwo, don't blow this way out of proportion. you think i want to do this. i need the extra cash right now, believe me.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{if you leave, i'm getting top lock to come over and change the front and back doors!}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{look, i'm only talking about a short period of time here.}
<C>__{adele}
<P>__{(screaming at the dogs)}
<D>__{ming! tippy! shut up!!}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{i mean it! you get in that van, and i'm taking my building back and putting in a fingernail salon!}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{come on now, honey, don't say things like that...}
<A>__{he puts an arm around her, giving her a perfunctory hug:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{let's not make a big issue out of it...}
<P>__{(kisses her on the cheek)}
<D>__{okay?}
<A>__{without waiting for a response, he moves back across the lawn toward the van and is stopped mid stride as a strong spray from the hose hits him squarely on the back.}
