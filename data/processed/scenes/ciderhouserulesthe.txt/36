<L>__{exterior st. cloud's early morning}
<A>__{the girls, led by mary agnes, round a corner of the orphanage, towing a sled piled high with snowballs.}
<C>__{mary agnes}
<D>__{buster is mine. you two get copperfield and curly. nobody touches fuzzy.}
<A>__{they shriek as the boys suddenly surprise them. buster throws two hard snowballs that hit mary agnes and clara (eight or nine) before mary agnes overwhelms him and repeatedly sticks his head in the snow. copperfield, terrified of mary agnes, escapes. curly misses, then tips over the sled of snowballs as clara and the adorable hazel (five or six) throw him to the ground. fuzzy drops his one snowball; he runs aimlessly in circles, coughing, as nurse edna explodes from a door of the orphanage.}
<C>__{edna}
<D>__{stop it! no fighting! share the snowballs!}
<C>__{buster}
<P>__{(mouth full of snow)}
<D>__{they're our snowballs! they stole them!}
<C>__{mary agnes}
<D>__{they attacked us just like the japs!}
<A>__{fuzzy coughs and wheezes, trying to catch his breath.}
<C>__{edna}
<D>__{listen to you, fuzzy! you've been running. you get to the shower!}
<A>__{a new couple comes up the hill. the orphans stop and stare, brushing snow off themselves, struggling to make themselves look presentable. curly is desperate to look his best. mary agnes doesn't bother to pretty herself. she whispers to clara and hazel.}
<C>__{mary agnes}
<D>__{i know the type they'll take one of the babies.}
