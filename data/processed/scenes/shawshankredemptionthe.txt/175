<L>__{int prison library day (1966)}
<A>__{silence. tommy has finished his story. red is stunned...but andy looks like he's been smacked with a two by four.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{andy?}
<A>__{andy says nothing. walks stiffly away. doesn't look back.}
<L>__{int norton's office day (1966)}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{well. i have to say, that's the most amazing story i ever heard. what amazes me most is you were taken in by it.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{it's obvious this fellow williams is impressed with you. he hears your tale of woe and quite naturally wants to cheer you up. he's young, not terribly bright. not surprising he didn't know what a state he'd put you in.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{i think he's telling the truth.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{let's say for a moment blatch does exist. you think he'd just fall to his knees and cry, "yes, i did it! i confess! by all means, please add a life term to my sentence!"}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{it wouldn't matter. with tommy's testimony, i can get a new trial.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{that's assuming blatch is even still there. chances are excellent he'd be released by now. excellent.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{they'd have his last known address. names of relatives...}
<P>__{(norton shakes his head)}
<D>__{well it's a chance. isn't it? how can you be so obtuse?}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{what? what did you call me?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{obtuse! is it deliberate? the country club will have his old time cards! w 2s with his name on them!}
<C>__{norton}
<P>__{(rises)}
<D>__{dufresne, if you want to indulge this fantasy, that's your business. don't make it mine. this meeting's over.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{look, if it's the squeeze, don't worry. i'd never say what goes on in here. i'd be just as indictable as you for laundering the money!}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{don't you ever mention money to me again, you sorry son of a bitch! not in this office, not anywhere!}
<P>__{(slaps intercom)}
<D>__{get in here! now!}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{i was just trying to rest your mind at ease, that's all.}
<C>__{norton}
<P>__{(as guards enter)}
<D>__{solitary! a month!}
<A>__{andy gets dragged away, kicking and screaming:}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{what's the matter with you? it's my chance to get out, don't you see that? it's my life! don't you understand it's my life?}
