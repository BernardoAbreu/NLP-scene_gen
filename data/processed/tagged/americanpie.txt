<A>__{now we see a tv...but the picture isn't clear. or, more appropriately, the picture is scrambled it phases in and out. bars scroll across it. and we get occasional glimpses of what looks like }
<D>__{jim (o.s.)(cont'd) ...oh that was a tit, tits...}
<A>__{as most high school guys know (but few will admit), it is possible to watch the pay channels while they're scrambled. you just need a decent imagination to fill in the rest of the picture. we pull back to see jim 17, short, horny.}

<D>__{give it to me! yes!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{oh yeah, baby, i will give it to you.}
<A>__{jim is, uh, physically involved with the scrambled babe. we tilt down to see a small multimedia presentation next to jim on his bed. "cosmopolitan" is open to a sexy model...a yearbook is open to the "girl's swim team" section...and a dictionary next to jim, open to the "vagina" listing, accompanied by a big vagina diagram.}

<C>__{jim}
<D>__{man, shut up!}
<A>__{suddenly there's a knock at the door, immediately after which jim's mom enters. jim scrambles and quickly covers himself and the dictionary with a pillow. she's oblivious to his doings.}

<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{that's the spirit.}

<C>__{sherman}
<D>__{it was just my time, fellas, it was just my time. best of luck to you, boys.}
<A>__{sherman exits. silence. the guys look like they just lost the world series on errors. they slowly take seats, ruined.}

<D>__{no shit, i'm never gonna get laid. how the hell am i gonna become this mr. sensitive man?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{jesus, we're all gonna go to college as virgins. they've probably got special dorms for people like us.}

<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{alright, i got an idea. but it stays between us. agreed?}
<A>__{they do.}
<C>__{kevin }
<D>__{okay. it's really simple. we make an agreement no wait, more than an agreement.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{like a bet?}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{no, a pact . no money involved. this is more important than any bet. now here's the deal: we all get laid before we graduate.}

<C>__{oz}
<D>__{dude, it's not like i haven't been trying to get laid.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{this is different. this is better. think of when you're working out, oz. you need a partner, someone to spot you. someone to keep you motivated.}
<A>__{oz nods, getting into it. kevin smiles and continues, arms outspread.}
<C>__{kevin }
<D>__{that's what we are, we keep each other on track. prior to this day, we've postured. we've procrastinated. we've pretended. we've well i can't think of other p words, but we've probably done them too.}
