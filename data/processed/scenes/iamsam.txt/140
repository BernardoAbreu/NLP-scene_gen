<L>__{interior denny's night}
<A>__{sam, rita, ifty, robert and brad sit in a booth. with one extra person, it's a little tight. rita picks at her salisbury steak special, trying to deal with the business at hand.}
<C>__{ifty}
<D>__{isn't it illegal? it's illegal to go through stop signs. it's illegal to cross on the red.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{it's not illegal. it's very complicated. when a strong foster parent lobbies for a child it changes the equation.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{they're reaching right through sam as if he doesn't exist. as if he's a ghost.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{there's one option we've never talked about, sam.}
<P>__{(very carefully)}
<D>__{i know what you went through the last time you took the stand. we could settle out of court, ask for the most incredible visitation rights it would almost seem like joint custody.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you're saying i don't have a chance. that's what you're saying.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{i'm not saying you don't have a chance.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{that's what you said last time and look where he is now.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{stop. rita's not saying i don't have a chance. are you? tell me i have a chance.}
<A>__{too long a pause. ifty looks at the clock.}
<C>__{ifty}
<D>__{oh my god! 6:35 is video night at my house and i'm not even there!}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{if we get there before you do we'll wait for you check!}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{sam get your dessert to go.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{this is very hard to say. i'm having my dessert here. with rita. i'm not coming to video night.}
<A>__{devastated, ifty, robert and brad solemnly gather their things.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{sam if you want to go...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i said no, rita.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{i know, but if you }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what? do you want me to go?}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{i didn't say that. but do you want to go?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{nevermind.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{fine.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{fine. ifty, robert & brad fine.}
<A>__{they leave in a huff. the waitress delivers the check with dessert and coffee.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{i've got it.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i've got it.}
<A>__{long pause. rita slowly eats her pie.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{it's good to chew. you're eating more slowly.}
<A>__{rita laughs and nods.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{coconut rhubarb. sidebar, we need to talk. sidebar.}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{yes we do.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i need to get lucy back. we need, we need to be professional.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{do you know what that means?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{when dealing with starbucks' customers, be friendly but not familiar. i can be your friend.}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(oddly touched)}
<D>__{thank you, sam.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you need to leave your husband.}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(her armor up again)}
<D>__{oh, my marriage isn't so bad.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{'life is very short and there's no time for fussing and fighting, my friend.'}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(undone)}
<D>__{it's just...it's just that...i've never lost anything.}
