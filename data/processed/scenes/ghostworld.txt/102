<A>__{enid is sorting her stuff into boxes. digging through her closet, she finds a box that she doesn't recognize. inside are her old children's records (45's). she excitedly takes one out and plays it. she folds her clothes while listening to this song, which clearly is getting to her. she grabs mechanically for the next thing hanging in her closet. it's the uniform from her job at "computer station." she folds it, puts it in the box, then stops, staring at the orange fabric.}
