<L>__{interior dr. cornelius' office establishing shot day}
<A>__{the office is simple, almost spartan. there are books but no bric a brac; several painted portraits of great apes but no tape recorder or other modern office equipment. taylor sits at a desk, scribbling furiously on a sheet of paper. his leash has been removed, but not his collar. zira stands at his elbow. cornelius paces nervously up and down, reading a sheaf of notes taylor has already written.}

<P>__{(stubbornly)}
<D>__{it's a stunt. humans don't write.}
<C>__{zira}

<P>__{(to taylor)}
<D>__{where did you learn to do this?}
