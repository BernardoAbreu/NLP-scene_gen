<L>__{interior rebecca's bedroom night}
<A>__{the room is dimly lit. dulaney is in bed. he appears to be deep in thought. rebecca enters wearing a sheer, silk bathrobe and carrying a tea service on a tray. he places it on the bed and sits beside him.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{something wrong?}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{paley could be a problem tomorrow.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i'm sure you'll be able to handle him.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{i'm glad you have such confidence in me.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{don't worry about paley. he can't touch me. no one can. i've thought it all out.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<P>__{(sits up; very concerned)}
<D>__{what does that mean? you've been thinking about the case? or you thought everything out before you killed marsh?}
<A>__{the question hurts rebecca it shows on her face. she looks away from him. a beat. dulaney thinks. he feels bad for asking such a question.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<P>__{(she doesn't look at him)}
<D>__{rebecca i'm sorry. really.}
<A>__{he takes her hand. she slowly looks at him and smiles. she points to the tea service.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{sugar or honey?}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{honey.}
<A>__{she lifts a plastic bottle of honey and starts to pour it into a cup. she stops and smiles seductively at dulaney, then parts her bathrobe and slowly draws a liquid line with it along her thigh. she reaches out grabs him by the hair and gently pulls him forward. he kisses her knee and slowly runs his tongue along her thigh, following the trail upwards. she arches her back closes her eyes breathes deeply from the pleasure of his touch.}
