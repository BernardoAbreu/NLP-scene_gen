<L>__{interior death star detention corridor}
<A>__{luke and leia crouch together in an alcove for protection as they continue to exchange fire with troops. han and chewbacca are barely able to keep the stormtroopers at bay at the far and of the hallway. the laserfire is very intense, and smoke fills the narrow cell corridor.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{there isn't any other way out.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{i can't hold them off forever! now what?}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{this is some rescue. when you came in here, didn't you have a plan for getting out?}
<C>__{han}
<P>__{(pointing to luke)}
<D>__{he's the brains, sweetheart.}
<A>__{luke manages a sheepish grin and shrugs his shoulders.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{well, i didn't...}
<A>__{the princess grabs luke's gun and fires at a small grate in the wall next to han, almost frying him.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing?}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{somebody has to save our skins. into the garbage chute, wise guy.}
<A>__{she jumps through the narrow opening as han and chewbacca look on in amazement. chewbacca sniffs the garbage chute and says something.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{get in there you big furry oaf! i don't care what you smell! get in there and don't worry about it.}
<A>__{han gives him a kick and the wookiee disappears into the tiny opening. luke and han continue firing as they work their way toward the opening.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{wonderful girl! either i'm going to kill her or i'm beginning to like her. get in there!}
<A>__{luke ducks laserfire as he jumps into the darkness. han fires off a couple of quick blasts creating a smokey cover, then slides into the chute himself and is gone.}
