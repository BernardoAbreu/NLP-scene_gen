<L>__{exterior interior sidewalk cafe day}
<A>__{it's a hot sunday afternoon and the complex of shops and a cafe in st. germain des pres is bustling with young clientele. inside the cafe, there is a second floor with a balustrade overlooking the tables inside. outside, there are tables set up on the sidewalk. jack shaw, a tall, husky american in his late thirties, sits at one of the front tables outside. he reads the international herald tribune. the headline is, "terrorists seize embassy, issue demands and threaten attacks." jack sips his espresso.}
<B>__{angle on carlos}
<A>__{dressed as in preceding scene. he enters. just then jack looks up and sees him. for an instant, carlos looks at jack, tenses just slightly. jack looks back at his paper paying no attention. carlos pulls out a cigarette, pats his pockets for a light. then he crosses to jack.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{pardon monsieur...}
<A>__{he mimes flicking a match and jack looks for a match. he's out. he offers the lit end of his cigarette. carlos cups jack's hand.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{merci.}
<A>__{he crosses away from jack, smiling and goes inside the cafe. jack follows him absentmindedly, tracking his progress through the windows, though his view is obscured somewhat by reflections of the street. carlos steps casually to the railing overlooking the tables inside as jack sees the double image of carlos and the reflected street scene. carlos leans over, pulls the pin from an m26 grenade, and lets the "spoon" come off in his hand. we hear the timing fuse hiss as carlos nonchalantly counts to himself.}
<C>__{carlos}
<P>__{(counting)}
<D>__{one thousand one... one thousand two... one thousand three...}
<A>__{angle on jack he looks up just in time to see carlos drop the grenade casually into the crowd below. their eyes lock for a beat; then carlos smiles, turns and bounds away. jack's eyes widen in horror. he gets up, about to cry out a warning.}
