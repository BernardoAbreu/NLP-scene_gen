<D>__{the brainwaves of mutants are quite different than those of the average human being.}
<A>__{at xavier's eye level is a black screen with a chin rest like you see at the eye doctor. xavier rests his head in it and the screen lights up.}
<C>__{xavier }
<D>__{cerebro amplifies my power. it allows me to browse the worldis consciousness and find the genetically enhanced.}
<A>__{a vertical beam scans across his eye and a picture of xavier's retina appears on the screen next to a computerized image of the same. the two images overlap and match perfectly.}
