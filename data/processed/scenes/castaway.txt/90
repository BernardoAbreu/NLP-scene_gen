<L>__{exterior beach night}
<A>__{the full moon shines a ghostly light on the beach. trees cast moon shadows on the sand. chuck seems very, very alone. we hear from the dark thickets a strange noise. rustling in the leaves. something crashing in the trees, or is it a wave? a jolt of adrenaline courses through chuck's body. he lurches to his feet. we hear the noises again. chuck edges toward the rocks at the barb of the hook. keeping his eye on the thicket, he bends down and picks up a stone. his first weapon. in the rocks he finds a piece of driftwood. he picks it up in his other hand. he backs between two rocks and stands facing the thicket, every sense alert. a cloud passes over the moon. the shadow streaks across chuck's anxious face.}
