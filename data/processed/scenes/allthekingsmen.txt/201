<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior state capitol, night}
<A>__{newsmen, photographers stand about, bored. the crowd, every bit as large, is quiet but expectant. everyone holds still as the announcer's voice is heard again.}
<C>__{announcer}
<D>__{attention, please. attention, please. the balloting on the impeachment proceedings against governor stark has just ended. this is the result: willie stark has won.}
<A>__{the crowd explodes. people break through the police barriers. mounted policemen ride in quickly to prevent a riot. camera picks up anne in the crowd, trying to push through. jack stands on the steps of the capitol, watching it all. suddenly willie appears at the top of the steps, followed by sugar boy. sadie, duffy, pillsbury follow close behind. willie grabs hold of the mike and addresses the suddenly hushed crowd.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{they tried to ruin me. but they are ruined. they tried to ruin me because they did not like what i have done. do you like what i have done?}
<A>__{loud applause, and cries of "yes."}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{remember, it's not i who have won, but you. your will is my strength, and your need is my justice, and i shall live in your right and your will. and if any man tries to stop me from fulfilling that right and that will, i will break him. i will break him with my bare hands. for i have the strength of many.}
<A>__{having finished, he waves at them all. then he notices jack and comes down the steps to greet him.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{hello, jack boy, i'm glad you're here. i knew you'd come back.}
<A>__{he walks back up the steps, his arm around jack's shoulders. they start to go into the building that way when willie sees someone. he smiles and puts out his hand.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{oh, doctor, i'm very glad to see you.}
<A>__{adam is seen, waiting at the entrance of the building. before willie has taken a step adam fires several shots into him. willie falls to the ground and sugar boy whips out his pistol and fires at adam. three policemen with tommy guns open fire, shooting into adam's already fallen body. then they turn and point their guns at the mob of people rushing toward willie, forcing them back.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{stand back, everybody. stand back.}
<A>__{sugar boy kneels beside willie. sadie stands against a pillar, looking down on him.}
<C>__{sugar boy}
<P>__{(nearly crying)}
<D>__{d does it hurt m much, boss? d d does it hurt much?}
<A>__{jack looks up to see anne struggling through the screaming mob to get to adam. she looks at adam for a moment, then turns away.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{anne, anne... where are you going?}
<A>__{she doesn't answer, only walks away. he runs after her and catches hold of her arm.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i don't know. leave me alone.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{to do what?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i don't care.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no, that's too easy.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i don't know, i don't know, i don't know.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{leave me alone, please.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no, no more.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{he's dead.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{we're alive.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{my brother's dead.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{we've got to go on living.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{so that adam's death has meaning, so that it wasn't wasted. anne, our life has to give his death meaning. don't you see that? look at those people...}
<A>__{he turns her around so that she can see the crowds still struggling to get a look at willie.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{look at them! they still believe in him. and we've got to make them see willie the way adam saw him, or there's no meaning in anything... anything.}
<A>__{a policeman approaches.}
<C>__{policeman}
<D>__{mr. burden... the governor's asking for you. you better hurry. he's going fast.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to anne)}
<D>__{will you wait here?}
<A>__{no reply.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{will you wait here?}
<A>__{she nods her head slowly. jack walks through the building to the pillar against which willie has been propped. sugar boy is still beside him. he stands behind sadie and duffy, looking down at willie.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{it could have been the whole world, willie stark. the whole world... willie stark. why did he do it to me... willie stark? why?}
<A>__{his head droops to the side and he dies.}
