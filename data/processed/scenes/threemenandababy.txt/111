<L>__{interior jack's room night}
<A>__{although it is dark, we can distinguish in jack's bed a rather bulky shape, which is moving around under the comforter and doesn't exactly seem to be sleeping... suddenly, from the direction of the living room, we can hear mary crying. jack emerges from under the comforter and switches on the light: he has a female guest in his bed, a pretty brunette this time.}

<D>__{shit, she's crying...}
<C>__{brunette}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{nothing, nothing. i will be right back.}
<A>__{he gets up, slips on a bathrobe and goes out of the bedroom, carefully closing the door behind him. he goes into the living room, picks mary up, and showers her with kisses. mary stops crying immediately and lays her head on jack's shoulder, sucking her thumb. jack rocks her for a moment then puts her back to bed. mary instantly starts crying again. jack very quickly picks her up again and kisses her. mary is delighted by his tenderness. jack puts her back to bed again. mary cries again.}

<D>__{try and put her back to bed; we'll sing.}
<A>__{jack puts mary back to bed. michael, as a routine, sings a major chord, giving each of them their notes. they start singing a lullabye in three part harmony, as they lean over the crib. mary is in seventh heaven. she looks up at them, she stops crying, she sucks her thumb.}
