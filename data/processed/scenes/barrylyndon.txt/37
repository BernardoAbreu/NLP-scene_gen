<A>__{captain o'reilly, a stout red faced man, without a periwig, and in a rather tattered nightgown and cap. roderick and mrs. o'reilly.}
<C>__{captain o'reilly}
<D>__{mr. o'higgins, i cannot say how grateful i am for your timely assistance to my wife.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{i am only sorry that i was unable to prevent the villain from carrying off all her ladyship's money and pearls.}
<C>__{captain o'reilly}
<D>__{mr. o'higgins, we are in your debt, and rest assured, sir, you have friends in this house whenever you are in dublin.}
<P>__{(pours a glass)}
<D>__{mister o'higgins, i wonder if i know your good father?}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{which o'higgins do you know? for i have never heard your name mentioned in my family.}
<C>__{captain o'reilly}
<D>__{oh, i am thinking of the o'higgins of redmondstown. general o'higgins was a close friend of my wife's dear father, colonel granby somerset.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{ah i see. no, i'm afraid mine are the o'higgins of watertown.}
<C>__{captain o'reilly}
<D>__{i have heard of them.}
<A>__{there are relics of some mutton chops and onions on a cracked dish before them.}
<C>__{captain o'reilly}
<D>__{my love, i wish i had known of your coming, for bob moriaty and i just finished the most delicious venison pasty, which his grace the lord lieutenant, sent us, with a flash of sillery from his own cellar. you know the wine, my dear? but as bygones are bygones, and no help for them, what say ye to a fine lobster and a bottle of as good claret as any in ireland? betty, clear these things from the table, and make the mistress and our young friend welcome to our home.}
<A>__{captain o'reilly searches his pockets for some money to give to betty.}
<C>__{captain o'reilly}
<D>__{i'm sorry, mr. o'higgins, but i don't seem to have any small change. may i borrow a ten penny piece to give to the girl?}
<C>__{mrs. o'reilly}
<D>__{i have some money, my dear. here, betty, go to the fishmonger and bring back our supper, and mind you get the right change.}
<A>__{she takes out one of the golden guineas roderick gave to her.}
