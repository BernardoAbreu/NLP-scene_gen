<A>__{ava pulls the robe to her, follows yuri to the window.}

<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{ it's not about the money.}
<C>__{ava}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{he doesn't answer perhaps he doesn't have one. ava looks out of the window at their expensive view.}
<C>__{ava }
<D>__{i feel like all i've done my whole life is be pretty. all i've done is be born. i'm not just a failed actress. i'm also a failed writer, failed artist, failed businesswoman. i'm not much good as a mother. come to think of it, i'm not even that pretty any more. i've failed at everything, yuri.}
<P>__{(turning back to him)}
<D>__{but i won't fail as a human being. i'm leaving.}
<A>__{the words finally register with yuri.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{you can't leave. i will stop.}
<P>__{(as if trying to convince himself)}
<D>__{i will stop.}
<A>__{ava is skeptical. he holds her, reassures her.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{i've been thinking about it for a while. a lot, lately.}
<P>__{(as if trying to convince himself)}
<D>__{i'm making more from the oil and timber anyhow.}
<P>__{(further reassurance)}
<D>__{i will stop.}
<A>__{she interrogates his eyes for the truth.}
<C>__{ava}
<P>__{(pleading eyes)}
<D>__{you will? you promise?}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(deadly serious)}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(changing the subject a millisecond too fast)}
<D>__{now get dressed. we'll go out.}
<A>__{ava picks up the dress off the bed. yuri gazes at her.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{by the way, you're wrong about not being pretty any more.}
<A>__{she turns back and smiles.}
