<A>__{santa paces as a drill sargent would in front of the line of harnessed reindeer. they're shivering in their hooves.}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{who's the leader of this operation?}
<A>__{more scared reindeer faces. comet furtively motions towards rudolph with his antlers. santa sees this, marches quickly up to rudolph, and gets in his face.}
<C>__{santa }
<D>__{what's your major malfunction, dumbfuck!?}
<A>__{rudolph's scared shitless.}
<C>__{santa }
<D>__{step forward son!}
<A>__{rudolph attempts to move forward, but the harness attachments prevent him from doing so.}
<C>__{tiny tim}
<D>__{uh, he can't sir. the harnesses.}
<A>__{you can feel the robert deniro esque intensity boiling inside of santa.}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{you gonna learn to guide this sled right? you gonna make sure your men follow suit? because if i'm puking down chimneys come christmas eve, i'm gonna have your hide. we clear?}
<A>__{rudolph shakes his head. the bells on his harness tinkle. santa continues to stare down the reindeer as he walks away. rudolph is clearly broken, but continues staring back at santa as he makes his way out of frame. the expression on rudolph's face changes from fear to insolence as he angrily follows the o.s. santa. suddenly, santa charges right back into frame, and places his drawn gun to rudolph's temple.}
<C>__{santa }
<D>__{you eyeballin' me son!?}
<A>__{rudolph quickly looks away. santa puts his gun back into his belt, and then adjusts his suit and hat as if to regain his composure. without warning, santa throws a fake punch at rudolph's face, forcing the reindeer to flinch.}
<C>__{santa }
<D>__{i didn't think so.}
