<A>__{a very drunken kat jumps up onto the kitchen island and starts dancing by herself. she lets loose, hair flying. she's almost burlesque. others form a crowd, clapping and cheering her on she swings her head around banging it on a copper pot hanging from the rack above the center island. she starts to sway, then goes down as patrick rushes over to catch her. the others clap, thinking this is a wonderful finale. patrick sets her down on her feet, holding her up}
