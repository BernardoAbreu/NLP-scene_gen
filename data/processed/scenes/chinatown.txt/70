<D>__{what's that... down there?}
<A>__{the gardener peers into the pond.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{...there.}
<A>__{the gardener spots it. he rolls up his trousers, gets in the pond, and reaches into the bottom, his chin actually touching the water. he misses the object, which seems to scoot away like an animal. then he grasps it. he lifts it out of the water and holds a pair of eye glasses, rimless, bent, his finger poking through the frame where one lens is shattered. the gardener seems surprised. gittes looks at the glasses. they are heavily bifocal and reflect the sun.}
