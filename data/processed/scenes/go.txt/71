<A>__{it's a dive, and nearly empty. the guys work their way down both sides of a self service food bar. simon is mostly recovered.}

<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{she's a nutritionist. she also teaches a class at this college.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{what class?}

<C>__{singh}
<D>__{she teaches people how to fuck?}
<C>__{tiny}

<C>__{marcus}
<P>__{(to simon)}
<D>__{you shouldn't eat shrimp. it's loaded with iodine.}
<C>__{tiny}
<D>__{this shit is expensive. you're paying five bucks for lettuce and seeds and shit.}
<A>__{tiny up ends the rest of the shrimp cocktail onto his plate. pissed, singh scoops away a handful for himself.}
<B>__{at the table}
<A>__{the guys eat. tiny tries to make a sandwich out of the various foods on his plate, but the bread keeps crumbling.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{thing is, most people really don't know how to make love. they just put it in and move it around until they get off. what tantra teaches you is how to prolong and deepen the experience, bring it to a higher level. if one man in ten were having the sex i'm having, there would be no war.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{what's the longest you and her ever did it?}
<C>__{marcus}

<C>__{simon}
<D>__{fourteen hours, you didn't go once. not even at the end?}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{you redirect the orgasm inside.}
<A>__{he's greeted with skeptical looks.}
<C>__{marcus }
<D>__{how long does your orgasm last? a couple seconds? i've had orgasms that lasted an hour and a half.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{bullshit.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{swear to god. and i do mean allah.}
<C>__{singh}
<D>__{when was the last time you got off? i mean like, wet.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i haven't ejaculated in six months.}
<C>__{tiny}
<D>__{six months!}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{anyone can do it. all it takes is discipline.}
<C>__{tiny}
<D>__{you are some kind of obi wan kenobi motherfucker.}
<C>__{tiny }
<D>__{call me old school, but i am still down with coming and going. am i right?}
