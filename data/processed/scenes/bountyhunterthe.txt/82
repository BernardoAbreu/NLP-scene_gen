<L>__{int bally's blackjack table late afternoon}
<A>__{milo sits at a blackjack table, pulling cass into a seat next to him.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{prepare to observe the master.}
<A>__{he bets while cass sits next to him, scheming:}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{ok, how about this:}
<A>__{she uses her free hand to pull out her wallet:}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{if i give you all the cash in my wallet, will you let me go?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{hmm. lemme see...}
<A>__{he takes the cash from her and thinks for a moment.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{nope. guess not.}
<A>__{milo adds her cash to his bet on the table.}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(to the dealer)}
<D>__{hit me.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{i'd really like to.}
<A>__{the dealer deals the cards.}
<C>__{dealer}
<D>__{dealer wins.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{nice going, master.}
<A>__{milo quickly lays out some more money. a waitress (smells like an ashtray) appears:}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{and for the couple over here?}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{we're not a couple.}
<C>__{cass}
<P>__{(just as quick)}
<D>__{why would you think we were a couple?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{we used to be together. back when i was young and foolish.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{and i was confused.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{and i was slumming.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{and i was drunk.}
<A>__{the waitress looks back and forth between them.}
<C>__{waitress}
<P>__{(bored)}
<D>__{great story. i have to get back to work now.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{wait. champagne! i'm celebrating.}
<A>__{the waitress rolls her eyes and leaves. milo turns to see he has lost more money.}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{son of a bitch.}
<A>__{ok. cass has had enough of this. she leans closer:}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{look, milo, the truth is...my mom is in the hospital.}
<A>__{milo perks up.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{oh? old lois not feeling up to par?}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{she might be really sick. that's why i had to jump bail.}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(overly sincere)}
<D>__{taking care of her, huh? putting aside your career for a loved one? golly, that's so you.}
<A>__{"golly"? cass stares at him, realizing:}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{you've already been to see her.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{impressive. no wonder you got all those awards. so lemme guess: the real reason you jumped bail is cause you're on a story.}
<A>__{cass narrows her eyes:}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{stewart. stewart told you.}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(caught)}
<D>__{i would have figured it out on my own, trust me.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{i wouldn't trust you if you were the last man alive.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{you think about that much? me being the last man alive? am i naked in this fantasy?}
<A>__{cass takes a deep breath. this is getting her nowhere. but she is clearly hesitant to give him the real story.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{ok, you're right. i'm on a story. a very important story. it just so happens that i'm possibly about to uncover a whole ring of dirty cops.}
<A>__{milo snorts.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{please. isn't the whole "dirty cop" thing kind of old? maybe you should do a story about something people are interested in. like internet porn. or lesbians.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{i'm serious, milo. this is gonna be big. and here's what i'm willing to do (magnanimous): i'm willing to credit you in the article.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{oh, sure, like you credited me in the 13th street article?}
<A>__{cass stares at him.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{why on earth would i have credited you? i worked my ass off for that story.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{that's one way of putting it.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{forget it. i don't want to be in your article. in fact, i would rather eat a bowl of broken glass than have my name in any way associated with one of your lousy articles...}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{fine. forget i mentioned it.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i already have.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{i mean, you're not a cop anymore, right? what do you care if people were murdered?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{please. nobody was murdered.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{just my source.}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(suspicious)}
<D>__{oh yeah? how? bullet to the back of the head?}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{dumped in a reservoir?}
<C>__{cass}
<P>__{(flustered)}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{car accident?}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{ok, ok, maybe he wasn't murdered yet. but i wouldn't be surprised if...}
<A>__{milo breaks out into loud guffaws. cass is furious.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{maybe this whole thing sounds like no big deal to you...}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{you know what it sounds like? it sounds like you're going to jail.}
<A>__{cass can't believe this.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{milo, listen, you have to believe me, come on, you know me...}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(getting red)}
<D>__{exactly! i do know you. which means i know you are a deceptive, cold hearted bitch who is going to jail where she belongs.}
<A>__{wow. that was pretty harsh. cass looks at him, stunned. they stare at each other in silence. the waitress arrives with the drinks:}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{champagne. so. what are we celebrating?}
<C>__{cass}
<P>__{(grimly)}
<D>__{i have to use the bathroom.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{alrightee, then. cheers.}
