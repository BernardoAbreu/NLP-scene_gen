<L>__{interior rec room}
<A>__{sam strides in swipes a knife from beside the wooden model strides out again.}
<L>__{interior corridor}
<A>__{sam glances left and right making sure there's no sign of gerty then begins to pry open a vent with the knife. once the vent is removed he reaches deep inside and yanks out a bundle of interwoven wires sam bends the wires around the blade of the knife and cuts. gas issues from the cut wires. an alarm sounds. sam hides the knife away, shouts down the corridor:}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{gerty! get over here! quickly!}
<A>__{gerty comes out of the monitoring station and shuttles down the corridor.}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{don't know micro meteorites, maybe? either way there might be damage to the exterior shell. i'd better go outside and take a look.}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{there is no damage to the exterior shell.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it's not that i don't believe you, gerty, but the inner skin is springing leaks like an acme fire hose. maybe you better let me take a look, just in case, huh?}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{sam, i'm not supposed to let you go outside.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{then let's keep it between you and me then. ok?}
<A>__{the robot takes an inordinate amount of time to think this through. the syrupy gas distorts the light as it collects at sam's ankles. gerty's arms work away as they speedily repair the damage sam has done. finally:}
<C>__{gerty}
<D>__{okay, sam.}
<A>__{the "exit doors" light turns from red to green. for sam this is like the blast of a starting pistol he immediately takes off down the corridor }
