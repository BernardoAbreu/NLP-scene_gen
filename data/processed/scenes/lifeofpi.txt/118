<D>__{i spent the next day preparing the boat. i filled my stores with fresh water, ate seaweed until my stomach could take no more, and brought as many meerkats as i could fit into the storage locker for richard parker. i couldn't leave without him, of course it would mean killing him. and so i waited for his return. i knew he wouldn't be late.}
