<C>__{this boy's life}
<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{exterior highway day}
<A>__{it is 1957, and we are in the deserts of utah. tony bennett sings "rags to riches" on the soundtrack. breath taking scenery stretches out on either side of a highway. the camera moves to reveal a nash ambassador as it labors up a hill. twelve cars are caught behind the thirty mile per hour pace. two cars decide to ignore safety and cross the solid yellow line to pass the pokey car.}
<L>__{interior nash ambassador parallel time}
<A>__{two people are in the straining car a woman and her son. the woman is caroline wolff. somewhere in her 30s, she is a pretty woman who can look beautiful if she works at it. (just now, though, her prettiness is marred by a fading bruise on her right cheekbone.) she is bright and energetic and lively. even more important than these qualities, though, is her humor. and most important of all is a sensual quality she exudes. her sensuality is effortless as natural to her as the color of her eyes and hair. men turn on the street to stare at her. the boy is toby wolff. a pleasant faced boy with won derful eyes, he is 13 teetering on the brink of adolescence, so that one moment he seems like a self assured teenager, and the very next like a ten year old kid. just now the ten year old kid has the upper hand: bored and weary with the long trip, toby has been arguing with caroline, who is ignoring him.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{... well, i mean it. i'm serious i do. you promise and promise, and then you change your mind, just like that.}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(totally oblivious)}
<D>__{... uh huh.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{you wait 'til you ask me for something. just wait. see if you get it.}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(as above)}
<D>__{toby, hush. let me just...}
<A>__{so concentrated on her driving she doesn't even finish her sentence, she nurses the car upward. finally the car crests the hill and starts down. caroline sighs with relief. she turns to toby with a smile.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{what'd you say?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i said for the twentieth time if a person promises somebody something, they can't just turn around and take it back.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{oh, honey, jesus. don't start with that again.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{because i'm the mother, and i get to tell you what to do every minute of your life 'til you're eighteen. seriously, we've got no money. i can't buy you the moccasins.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i bet if you'd promised roy some moccasins he'd of got 'em.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{no talk about roy, okay? and ditto the moccasins. we, can't, afford, them.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{yeah, but you did promise...}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{sue me. take me to court. oh, toby, i know you're disappointed, but...}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{jack. call me jack.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{you're going to drive me to an early grave: i'm never going to make salt lake city.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{seriously. if a person can't get a stinking miserable pair of moccasins, at least he ought to be able to choose his own name...}
<P>__{(loud)}
<D>__{... and i wanna be called jack!}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{fine. and you can call me...}
<P>__{(she thinks)}
<D>__{... jeanette. jeanette marie.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{oh, you're so stupid sometimes, i...}
<A>__{the bawling of an airhorn interrupts him. both of them look through the back window and see a huge tractor trailer truck, out of control, bearing down on them. caroline brakes and steers a hard right, skidding the nash safely onto the side of the road. the truck, its horn blasting steadily, shimmies and slides past them, and then, hideously, fails to make the next curve: it smashes through the guard rails and into empty space, its horn still blaring. caroline and toby look at each other, then scramble out of the car.}
<L>__{exterior broken guard rail day}
<A>__{other drivers have stopped to look: hundreds of feet below, the truck lies on its back among boulders. caroline glances, then turns away. she pulls toby away, one arm around his shoulder.}
<L>__{exterior nash ambassador minutes later}
<A>__{caroline fills the nash's steaming radiator with a can of water.}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(not much heat)}
<D>__{goddamn thing.}
<A>__{she glances back to where a larger crowd of people stare avidly down at the truck. she bites her lip.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{oh, that poor man.}
<A>__{there is a pause. then toby speaks:}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i hope to hell this isn't some kind of omen.}
<A>__{caroline turns to toby, her face worried. then she sees the look in toby's eyes he's ragging her. she grins and gives his shoulder a light, affectionate shove.}
<L>__{interior nash ambassador night}
<A>__{toby (feet up on the dashboard wearing a brand new pair of indian moccasins) and caroline sing "mood indigo" together. toby holds a complicated looking, black con traption which looks something like an antique flashlight.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{how's this thing work, anyway?}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(not confident)}
<D>__{it makes a black light that, uh, causes uranium traces to glow.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{and we just walk along the street and find this glowing uranium?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{well, it was everywhere in moab, they say just like gold in the gold rush days.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{but we were too late in moab, and that guy at the office said nobody'd found any uranium in salt lake city.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{well, that means we'll have the place pretty much to ourselves, huh? honey, this could be a big break for us. if this works out, oh, just think: we'll get us a house, get rid of this damn nash ambassador no money worries... it'll be like heaven on a june day.}
<L>__{interior car dawn}
<A>__{we hear "mood indigo" on the car radio and see that a weary caroline has driven through the night and toby is slumped against the passenger door. toby stirs, then opens his eyes.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{ask me how far we are from salt lake city.}
<A>__{toby is instantly awake, excited. caroline points to a small highway sign and both she and toby yell out.}
<D>__{caroline toby forty seven miles to go!}
<A>__{both of them are laughing with excitement. toby claps his hands together once, very hard, and caroline yells }
<L>__{exterior highway morning}
<A>__{well, hell. the nash ambassador sits by the side of the road, its hood up, its radiator steaming. caroline and toby sit in a patch of shade by the car.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{if i could have one wish right now only one wish you know what i'd like? i'd like to burn this damn nash ambassador to a crisp.}
<P>__{(as toby laughs)}
<D>__{i'm serious. i hate it. i hate the factory that produced it, and i hate the man who invented it.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{it almost makes me want to see roy he was the only one could make the thing stop overheating.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{my god, he was boring. boring and mean: you sure got crappy taste in boyfriends.}
<A>__{at the mention of roy's name, caroline lightly touches the bruise on her right cheekbone. not enjoying the talk about roy, she pours the water into the radiator, and speaks directly to the car.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i'd like to burn you to the ground.}
<P>__{(to toby; big smile)}
<D>__{let's go get rich in salt lake city!}
<L>__{exterior salt lake city (downtown) day}
<A>__{toby waits beside the nash ambassador, looking toward a three story concrete building. he holds a portable radio, which plays dean martin singing "volare."}
<L>__{interior building parallel time}
<A>__{caroline, holding the imitation geiger counter, stands across the counter from a man who is looking at her very strangely.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{you're pulling my leg, right?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{no, i came here to look for uranium.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{my god, lady. if you're looking for uranium, why didn't you go to moab?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{we went there, but everybody'd beaten us there. we were too late.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{so you came here just on the chance you'd find uranium? listen, you mind me saying something to you might sound rude? lady, you got more courage than you got common sense.}
<L>__{exterior nash ambassador day}
<A>__{caroline exits the building, dumps the geiger counter in a trash can and strides to the car. she gets in, and says two words:}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{don't ask.}
<L>__{interior nash ambassador day}
<A>__{caroline turns the key in the ignition and gets only a maddening rer rer rer rer noise from the engine: wearily, she rests her forehead on the steering wheel.}
<L>__{exterior nash ambassador twenty minutes later}
<A>__{caroline and toby have the hood up and are peering into the engine.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{that mechanic in colorado said it needed points.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i know. don't tell me what i already know. this thing's a bottomless pit. i don't know what to do. no matter how much money i pour into it...}
<A>__{suddenly a woman in pedal pushers and a thin, inexpensive sweater stops. she's vaguely low class, but friendly and sympathetic.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{i'd rather be whipped with a belt than have car trouble. 'course these days i don't have to worry about that. my husband got laid off at the mill, and they repossessed the car, so wherever i wanna go, i just have to hoof it, you know?}
<A>__{caroline smiles, then her face changes.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{you don't have a car?}
<P>__{(as the woman shakes her head)}
<D>__{you want this one?}
<A>__{shocked, the woman says }
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{i... uh... i...}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{you're gonna give our car away?}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(to the woman)}
<D>__{seriously. it needs points, and it overheats constantly, but you can have it if you want it, because my hand to god, i can't look at it one more minute.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{well, sure...}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{get the bags out. get the owner's slip out of the glove compartment. we're rid of this son of a bitch pink and white albatross. you don't mind taking a car with a big dent in the passenger door?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{hell, no.}
<P>__{(she looks)}
<D>__{there's no dent there...}
<A>__{caroline draws back her leg and delivers a terrific, flat footed kick to the door, leaving a dent the size of a dish pan.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{oh, yes there is!}
<A>__{toby hands the woman the owner's slip, caroline gives her the keys.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{... you really just giving me this car?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{it's done. it's yours. you got yourself a nash ambassador!}
<P>__{(to toby)}
<D>__{let's go!}
<A>__{both of them pick up two bags apiece all they have in the world and off they go, feeling good.}
<L>__{exterior city street day (few minutes later) 1957 is all around us: gas is 29.9 cents a gallon; bread}
<A>__{is 19 cents a loaf; cars are curved and heavily chromed; people occasionally nod and smile at strangers; children carry hula hoops. in all, a gentler time. caroline and toby stride along briskly, as if they knew where they were going.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{... find ourselves a cheap room someplace, we'll get you into school, i will brush up on my typing and get a job, and things'll start looking up. i feel it: the good times are coming. and at least we're rid of that damn nash ambassador!}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{yeah, and like dad used to say, 'we may be broke, but we're never poor.' and later, if we get a house with a big yard, i could get a collie, you know? one like lad or grey dawn. and someday maybe a palomino. and i'm going to try harder in school, too...}
<A>__{the two of them walk on a bit foolish, but, in an odd way, brave as hell.}
<L>__{interior vice principal's office day}
<A>__{a subdued toby sits in front of the vice principal.}
<C>__{vice principal}
<D>__{... like to give new boys the benefit of the doubt, but this is the second time in two weeks that you've been in front of me, and i don't like that.}
<P>__{(picks up a telephone)}
<D>__{now i think you better just call your mother and tell her to come down here.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{she works. she's working.}
<A>__{silent, the man continues to hold out the telephone to toby. finally he takes it and dials.}
<L>__{exterior school afternoon}
<A>__{caroline and toby exit. toby sullen; caroline angry.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{it wasn't me broke their stupid windows.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{liar.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{gee, thanks a lot, mom believe them instead of me.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{if you care anything about me at all, you'll shut up.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{yeah, well if you'd stayed married to dad none of this would've ever happened.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{look, don't you put that on my back: i can't make your father call you. i can't make your brother write you. they dumped you. yes. but it's not my fault.}
<L>__{interior caroline and toby's room afternoon}
<A>__{the place is pretty bleak: a room and a half, murphy beds, linoleum floors, and a bath down the hall. caroline and toby enter. she pulls down the murphy bed and falls onto it fully dressed, saying:}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{my head is killing me.}
<A>__{toby heads for his room. same scene dusk caroline wakes up with a start, then sees toby sitting in a chair, watching her.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{what time is it?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{seven. almost.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{why didn't you wake me?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i started dinner. the potatoes are frying, and i'm heating up the hot dogs.}
<A>__{caroline sees that he's trying to make it up to her, and pats the bed for him to sit down next to her. he moves to sit beside her.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{hold your mother's hand.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i know you are, honey. ah, well it wasn't fire, and nobody bled, so i guess we're okay.}
<A>__{the telephone rings and she answers it. when she hears the voice on the other end she once again touches her right cheekbone with a finger the spot where the bruise had been. she sags back against a wall.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{yes...}
<P>__{(listens)}
<D>__{yes...}
<P>__{(listens)}
<D>__{yes, i know...}
<P>__{(listens)}
<D>__{you're right...}
<P>__{(listens)}
<D>__{all right, yes... in an hour, then.}
<A>__{caroline hangs up.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{who was that?}
<A>__{she closes her eyes.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{who was that?}
<A>__{caroline laughs aloud, then slides down the wall until she's on the floor still laughing.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{we've got a guest for dinner: it's roy. he tracked us down.}
<A>__{toby groans and falls full length onto the sofa.}
<L>__{interior caroline and toby's kitchen one hour later}
<A>__{caroline, toby and roy are eating at the tiny table. roy is good looking in a meaty, hairy chested sort of way. though he is on his very best behavior just now, there is a mean streak in him. toby, delighted, holds a winchester .22 rifle across his lap a peace making gift from roy.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{... i found me a room, but it's clear the hell and gone 'cross town. and i think i got a job lined up doin' tune ups in a texaco station. how you like it at winstead's?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{how do you know where i work?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i been here almost a week.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{you followed me around? for a week? watching?}
<A>__{roy doesn't answer. he just wiggles his eyebrows like groucho marx.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{and how did you ever find me?}
<A>__{again, roy does the groucho marx. he turns to toby.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{you like the rifle, toby? 'jack,' i mean.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{it's the best present i ever got. i just love it.}
<P>__{(to caroline)}
<D>__{i'm going to pretend i'm shooting.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{don't point that thing at anybody or i won't teach you to shoot.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{it's not loaded!}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{you heard me: anybody or any thing.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{it's got no bullets, for god's sake.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{don't make me speak to you again.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i will point it at the sky, then.}
<A>__{caroline sighs. toby opens a screenless window and points the gun up into the night sky, pretending to fire it over and over. caroline starts to clear the table. roy jumps up to help her.}
<L>__{interior living room two hours later}
<A>__{caroline and roy are kissing on the sofa, and he is all over her: his hands are on her breasts, her thighs, everywhere. aroused in spite of herself, caroline pulls away, indicating the light in the other room.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{don't. toby's still up.}
<A>__{roy leans back, smiling, and eyes caroline.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{you are one sweet thing, baby: just the sight of you makes my dick hard.}
<A>__{he pulls her to him, starting to kiss her. she fends him off, looking worriedly toward the room where toby's light burns.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{aw, he won't hear anything.}
<A>__{again he pulls her toward him; again she turns her head from the kiss. then it happens. a spasm of anger passes across his face and he shoves caroline away from him. it's a hard shove, but nothing that could really hurt her. violence has happened before between these two, and they recognize it. caroline is immediately on guard, and roy is apologetic.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{shit, baby, i'm sorry. i didn't mean that. i'm just so glad to see you.}
<A>__{he slides toward caroline, kisses her. this time she accepts the kiss feels she has no choice.}
<L>__{interior kitchen parallel time}
<A>__{dressed for bed, toby stands by an open window. he can hear every word of roy's, who continues to apologize between kisses. the room is illuminated by a nearby streetlamp. the frosty air from the open window causes his breath to steam. he raises two fingers to his lips, pretends to take a drag on a cigarette and blows out the steam from his breath. the voices in the other room grow a bit louder, almost to an argument, and then subside again. toby takes another drag from his pretend cig arette. he looks very young.}
<L>__{exterior residential street afternoon}
<A>__{toby wanders toward the rooming house. he stops to watch two fiftyish women who are working in a garden. one woman looks up.}
<D>__{woman #1 hi.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{the woman stops to take a breather, lights a cigarette, pokes her companion.}
<D>__{woman #1 my lord, look at the eyes on him won't he be a heartbreaker in three, four years? woman #2 bedroom eyes.}
<A>__{toby smiles.}
<D>__{woman #1 you live in the neighborhood, sweetie?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{over there.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i won't be here long, though, 'cause my dad's coming to get me. woman #1 oh, yes?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{yeah. i'm gonna live on his ranch in phoenix. the "lazy b," it's called. woman #2 that sounds like fun.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{it is. i've got a palomino horse and a collie, and dad lets us go on hunts all by ourselves. he gave me this winchester .22, and last year i shot a mountain lion with it. and lad that's my dog found a nest of rattlesnakes one time, and killed all twelve of them...}
<A>__{the two women exchange a glance. it's obvious the boy is lying.}
<L>__{interior caroline and toby's rooms afternoon (same day)21}
<A>__{toby enters. four packed suitcases lie on the bed behind caroline.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{what're you doing home so }
<P>__{(as he sees suitcases)}
<D>__{we going someplace?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{we sure are.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i don't know. got any suggestions?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{phoenix.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{good. i was thinking of phoenix or seattle lots of opportunities in both those places.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{what about your fabulous boyfriends? what about the fabulous, boring roy? is he coming, too?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{not if i can help it. i looked out the window at work today, and he was parked across the street, watching.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{roy's so uncool. so boring.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{you liked him well enough last night.}
<P>__{(imitating toby)}
<D>__{'oh, roy, i just love my rifle so much! it's the bestest present ever!'}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{oh, shut up.}
<A>__{but he's smiling, completely unbothered. suddenly caroline laughs, stands up, and begins to close the suitcases. toby laughs, too.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{now? we're going now? what about all the food?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{leave it.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{even the canned stuff?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{leave it!}
<A>__{they grab the four heavy suitcases and head out the door. both of them are laughing.}
<L>__{interior bus station afternoon}
<A>__{caroline and toby stand at a ticket counter, disappointed.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{well, ask him when the next one to phoenix is.}
<C>__{ticket seller}
<D>__{tomorrow morning, eleven forty five.}
<A>__{toby and caroline groan, then caroline brightens.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{what about seattle?}
<C>__{ticket seller}
<P>__{(consults a list)}
<D>__{leaves in nine minutes.}
<A>__{they look at each other.}
<L>__{exterior boarding area}
<A>__{toby and caroline hurry onboard a greyhound bus with seattle as its destination.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{... i've always had a good head for figures, and if i could get my c.p.a. license, i believe we could make a real go of it in seattle. i will advertise for roommates, and i bet we find us a real cute house to rent.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{if there's a big yard, can i get a collie?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{sure. oh, honey, i feel a wind at my back: i think this is going to work out good.}
<C>__{toby}
<P>__{(as they board bus)}
<D>__{yeah like heaven on a june day.}
<A>__{the doors of the bus close. whoosh! the bus begins to move. caroline and toby's faces are at the window: seattle or bust.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior tract house (seattle, washington) afternoon}
<A>__{the house is a nasty little thing with peeling painterior from inside we hear:}
<C>__{caroline }
<D>__{... and if you cut school again i will just wear you out do you hear me? i'm tired of it!}
<C>__{toby }
<D>__{yeah, yeah...}
<A>__{toby exits the house. but, jesus, what a new toby: he's turned cool. a few months have passed. he now wears t shirts and jeans which ride way low on his hips. as he walks along, he combs his hair into a duck's ass in back, and forward into a curl at the center of his forehead. he's 1957 hip or thinks he is. he strolls on, feeling cool.}
<L>__{exterior tract house further down street afternoon}
<A>__{from one of the houses terry taylor emerges, falling into step with toby. he's toby's age, and is almost an exact replica of him.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{hey, terry.}
<C>__{terry taylor}
<D>__{hey, jack. what'd your mom say about skipping school today?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{who listens?}
<C>__{terry taylor}
<D>__{you go over to wanda's house last night?}
<P>__{(as toby nods)}

<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i told dwight i'd marry him. in two weeks. i don't know what else to do. i mean, he's been helping me with the rent since kathy left. and you need a father. i think it's the best thing all the way around what d'you think?}

<D>__{i think it's the best thing, too.}
<A>__{caroline smiles, smooths his hair, then goes into the house. toby continues to walk. suddenly, he spins around and tears out toward the house. by god, he'll tell her just what's been going on. he bangs through the front door and up the stairs.}

<A>__{same scene later the walls and ceiling are almost finished, but the paint has not darkened. as he paints, he absentmindedly sings "blue suede shoes." then he stops painting, as he notices toby looking at the walls.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{what? i like it. it looks clean.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{yeah, but it makes everything else look so dark.}

<D>__{sort of stands out, doesn't it?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{yeah, you could say that.}
<A>__{g) same scene later they paint the baldwin white. dwight hesitates, then starts to paint the foot pedals. h) same scene later dwight's face tells us that something still doesn't suit him. he glances at toby, toby nods, and they converge on the piano. j) same scene later very carefully, dwight and toby finish painting the dark ivory keys to match the rest of the room. elvis screams out the last line, "you can do anything, but stay off of my blue suede shoes!" they stand up, look around arctic white is every where. dwight likes it. toby is less sure. the montage ends.}
<L>__{exterior dwight's house day}

<A>__{dwight and caroline are being married. caroline wears a pale blue suit, and dwight looks good in a navy single breasted. aside from toby and dwight's children, the only guests are marian, kathy, and three people we haven't seen before friends of dwight's.}
<L>__{interior dwight and caroline's bedroom late night}
<A>__{the bed is a rat's nest of twisted sheets as dwight and caroline make love. he takes his lips away from caroline's breast and moves so that his head is at the bottom of the bed. holding her foot up, he kisses the instep, then runs his tongue over the same spot and then down under the arch of her foot. a sexy scene.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{m m m. there's not a straight line on you everything's curved.}
<A>__{caroline draws him up to her, and they kiss. then dwight turns caroline on her side, away from him, pre paring to enter her. caroline makes a small sound of protest, turning back toward him.}

<D>__{oh, dwight, not like that. not this time not tonight.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{it's good this way.}

<D>__{but i want to see your face while we make love.}
<C>__{dwight}
<P>__{(uncomfortable laugh)}
<D>__{oh, no i just don't... uh... like that way.}
<A>__{dwight continues to stroke caroline, his hands everywhere, but now she is unresponsive.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{you mean you don't like to make love face to face?}
<C>__{dwight}
<P>__{(same laugh)}
<D>__{no, i don't like it. i can't handle it i don't like to see the face.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{you mean ever?}
<A>__{dwight murmurs an assent. caroline is appalled.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{but that's grotesque...}
<C>__{dwight}
<P>__{(stung; flares up)}
<D>__{look, you can get it doggie style or you can get it laying on your side those are your only choices. this is my house, and i get to say. wherever mcginty sits is the head of the table, you know?}
<A>__{disgusted, caroline turns back away from dwight. he shifts down on the bed a few inches, again preparing to enter her.}

<A>__{toby is eating toast at the kitchen table. norma has made a big breakfast, and she hurriedly pours the coffee when she hears dwight and caroline's bedroom door open.}
<C>__{norma}
<D>__{happy wedding breakfast!}
<A>__{caroline's eyes are red and swollen. dwight turns on a radio, sips his coffee, and chats with norma. toby gives norma's rear end an appreciative glance, then comes up behind caroline, speaking sotto voce:}

<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{don't.}

<D>__{the bride doesn't want to chat?}

<L>__{exterior residential neighborhood afternoon}
<A>__{toby, his news bag slung over his shoulder, stands talking idly with two boys from school, oscar booker and jimmy voorhees. one of them says, "uh oh," and jerks his head to indicate where toby and the other boy should look. they look in the direction indicated, and see arthur gayle coming down the road toward them, followed by a small black dog called pepper. as the boys watch arthur's approach:}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{what's his name again?}
<C>__{oscar}
<D>__{arthur gayle.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{what a homo.}

<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{yeah, do it.}
<A>__{by this time arthur is next to them. smiling a superior smile, he stops and glances at all three of them as if they were just the oddest things he's ever seen. then his eye falls on toby's yellow hands.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{oh, my, my look at all that yellow: didn't your mama teach you to wash your hands after you pee?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{oh, shut up.}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(rolls his eyes; heavily sarcastic)}
<D>__{now that's what i like an insult with some originality. did you just make that up? just now? so clever.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{why don't you take a long walk off a short pier?}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(though he's not}
<D>__{nearly close enough to smell toby's}

<D>__{excuse me, but has anyone ever told you your breath would gag a maggot?}
<A>__{both of toby's friends laugh.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{well, at least i'm not a great big sissy!}
<A>__{two things happen instantly: the superior smile vanishes from arthur's face, and toby's friends exchange a single expectant look: "here it comes." without warning, arthur swings a fist at toby, catching him on the ear. arthur's second blow hits him in the back of the head. the fight is on. arthur throws punches sidearm, with lots of wrist action, but there are so many of them. before toby can react, arthur has hit him four times, including one wild haymaker that puts toby on his knees. while toby's still on his knees, arthur tries to kick him in the stomach. the kick is deadened by the papers in toby's bag, arthur bends over toby, screaming as if he has lost his mind:}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{get up! get up, you son of a bitching maggot gagger! i will stomp your guts out! i will kill you!}
<A>__{toby gets up, and again arthur sails in with those wild roundhouse swings. then toby gets in a solid punch to arthur's face that rocks the bigger boy back on his heels. arthur grabs his head and roars like a wounded buffalo. almost immediately arthur's eye puffs and begins to swell shut. snot streaming from both nostrils, still roaring, arthur flies at toby again. toby closes with him, to hold those flailing arms still, and the two stagger around the street like drunken dancers. they separate, exchange a few blows, then grapple with each other again. then arthur hooks toby's leg, trips him, and the two roll off the shoulder of the road and down an embankment. they hit the muddy bottom of the gully still hitting, flailing, kicking first toby is on top, then arthur, then toby, then arthur. by now they are panting, each breath is a heave, a gasp. then, suddenly, arthur gives out completely he falls on top of toby, pressing him deeper into the mud. with his last bit of strength toby throws the bigger boy off him and sits up, while pepper barks furiously at him and threatens to nip his leg. toby staggers to his feet and starts to climb the gully. he looks relieved at least it's over. no, it's not. from behind him he hears three words.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{take it back.}
<A>__{toby turns to see a bloody faced, swollen eyed arthur clambering up the hill after him, like some monster that won't die. both boys reach the top and stand facing one another.}

<D>__{take it back.}

<C>__{toby}
<D>__{oh, the bride is calm. who the hell cares?}

<A>__{dwight slumps his shoulders, drops his chin, and looks up through his eyebrows, a simpering expression on his face.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{so i say, 'excuse me, but what's the problem?' and he starts in on me again, blah, blah, blah, and i jam a horse turd right into that big mouth. then i give him a sucker punch in the breadbasket, and he goes down like a...}

<A>__{(later) "the lawrence welk show" is on the television. dwight, caroline, skipper, norma and pearl and toby watch an irish tenor sing a lugubrious ballad. dwight stands in a corner of the room, his saxophone to his lips. he's playing along with the music, but silently. occasionally he gets overcome and accidentally causes the saxophone to squawk. the irish ballad ends, and lawrence welk's champagne orchestra strikes up a lively polka. dwight takes a sip of his drink and grabs caroline, pulls her to her feet, and begins to dance with her. a polka can be a decorous, contained dance. he dances caroline vigorously around the living room, out into the kitchen, around the table, and then back again. dwight is really good, and caroline matches him every step of the way. skipper turns the volume up and dwight kicks the dance into an even higher, wilder gear: the kids clap on the beat, the two whirl and stamp and spin. faster and faster caroline's heel catches an end table and sends it spinning and faster they go. caroline's head is thrown back; she's laughing with pleasure. as the music reaches its climax, dwight spins caroline back to the sofa, lets her go, and wham! she lands back where she was seated exactly on the last note of the song. amid the general laughter and applause, caroline smiles at toby.}

<D>__{is that right? where?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{deerfield and choate.}
<A>__{mr. howard is impressed.}
<C>__{mr. howard}
<D>__{i see. well, maybe you'd like it. hill was difficult for me, though classes were hard, and the boys seemed cold interested in money and social position.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{and i hated those snowy pennsylvania winters! but then in my last year, something changed. the guys in my class grew close, so close that i still think of them as a second family.}
<C>__{toby}
<P>__{(honest)}
<D>__{i want that. i do, and }
<A>__{he stops talking as we hear, o.s., "ag h h h!" psycho and arch have entered the drugstore. toby's back is to the door, and he slouches deeper into the booth, praying that he won't be seen. arch and psycho buy cigarettes.}
<C>__{arch}
<D>__{... so she said, 'no, i don't want you to do that,' and i said 'oh, baby, let me get down and grovel on it.' i mean, i ate her pussy 'til my tongue was calloused, and then...}
<A>__{arch moves toward the back of the store toward the area where toby sits. toby inches down a bit farther into the booth. arch stops at a sunglass rack five feet from toby and tries on a couple of pairs.}
<C>__{arch}
<D>__{... so anyway, she went off like a roman candle i mean that woman can scream. i said, 'you liked that, didn't you, baby?' i said, 'you liked the old arch cook special, didn't you?'}
<A>__{arch decides to let the sunglasses go. he and psycho move toward the front of the store, he talks about pussy. toby exhales.}
<C>__{mr. howard}
<D>__{toby, boys at hill talk roughly sometimes too you'd have to be ready for that. i can see you've had sort of a sheltered life.}
<A>__{toby nods his head.}
<L>__{exterior drugstore afternoon}
<A>__{mr. howard shakes toby's hand.}
<C>__{mr. howard}
<D>__{you seem like a fine boy, and i will give you a good report tomorrow. but there are lots of boys applying, and we'll just have to wait and see whether }
<A>__{from o.s., we hear dwight's voice, and toby goes rigid.}
<C>__{dwight }
<D>__{ohh, it's the hotshot boy.}
<A>__{both mr. howard and toby turn to see dwight, wearing his coveralls, ten feet away.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{yeah, it's the guy who thinks he knows everything. thinks he's so smart, but fella, what you don't know would fill a book.}
<P>__{(glances at mr.}
<D>__{howard's new}
<P>__{chevrolet; offhand)}
<D>__{general motors makes shit cars.}
<A>__{dwight turns and enters the drugstore.}
<C>__{toby}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{that's, uh, that's this guy... he's a mechanic... did some bad work on our car...}
<A>__{it's not much of an explanation, but mr. howard seems to buy it. he says goodbye to toby, gets into his car, drives away. toby stares after him.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior a & p grocery store night}
<A>__{a few weeks have passed. toby (his elvis hairdo further modified) again prices and stacks food. his face is serious, his manner industrious.}
<L>__{interior dwight and caroline's kitchen afternoon}
<A>__{toby walks in; his elvis hair disappearing. pearl, who is boiling hot dogs, turns:}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{i know something'll make you feel good: that man called you got the scholarship.}
<A>__{toby grits his teeth and clenches both fists victoriously. he's won.}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{he said they're gonna give you two thousand three hundred dollars a year and it costs two thousand five hundred dollars... so you gotta come up with the other two hundred. great, huh?}
<P>__{(sympathetic)}
<D>__{i'm making hot dogs i will make one for you. can you put mustard on some bread for us?}
<A>__{toby gets a jar of mustard from a cupboard, but it's empty, so he tosses it on top of the trash can, gets a new jar and starts to open it. dwight enters.}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{what're you doing home so earl... oh! toby he got that scholarship two thousand and three hundred dollars!}
<A>__{dwight makes himself a drink, takes two large swallows, then turns to toby.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{hey, leopard. i say, 'hey, leopard.' i know you, leopard i can see those spots you can't change.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{thinks he can go to some fancy prep school and fool everybody. not a chance. i know a thing or two about a thing or two.}
<A>__{toby won't rise to the bait, and dwight falls silent, he, looks around and sees the jar of mustard on top of the trash.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{who threw that away?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i did.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{because it was empty.}
<A>__{dwight retrieves the bottle. there are a few streaks of mustard under the neck of the bottle. he holds it close to toby's face.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{empty? that look empty to you?}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{it looks empty to me.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{it looks empty to me, too.}
<A>__{dwight pushes the jar against toby's eye, leaving mustard stains on the boy's face.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{look again, hotshot. is it empty?}
<A>__{toby jerks his head away, not answering. dwight slams down the jar of mustard, grabs toby by the back of the hair and forces his face down against the mustard jar.}
<C>__{pearl}
<D>__{dad!}
<C>__{dwight}
<P>__{(to toby)}
<D>__{now. now, mr. big time prep school fucker, is it empty?}
<A>__{toby struggles, but dwight has the strength of anger: trying always to protect his throbbing finger, toby pulls free and jumps up from the table. dwight is too quick for toby, though: he grabs an even bigger handful of hair and forces toby's face down onto the mustard jar again and again. and again. each time he asks if the jar is empty. finally, toby gives up.}
<C>__{toby}
<P>__{(muffled)}
<D>__{no, it wasn't empty.}
<C>__{dwight}
<P>__{(lets him go)}
<D>__{all right clean it out.}
<A>__{his face smeared with mustard, toby's expression is murderous. he picks up a knife and scrapes at the mus tard, trying to get up under the neck. he manages to get a few brown and yellow smudges on the knife, which he transfers to the edge of a plate. dwight watches.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{now. was it empty?}
<A>__{slowly he stands up and faces dwight.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{yes!}
<A>__{dwight slaps toby across the mouth and the battle is on. as pearl stands frozen, toby lunges at dwight, they grapple and stagger around the room. glass shatters, the kitchen table crashes over, and their feet stamp and shuffle but toby is a wild man. even though he has only one good hand. he lands a blow between dwight's eyes that bangs the man back against the wall. dwight grabs the pan with the hot water from the hotdogs, flings it at toby. most of it misses. again they grapple. toby manages to throw dwight down, then grabs a broom that has fallen to the floor, presses it against dwight's throat, using his good hand and one knee. dwight's mouth gapes wide, his eyes bulge, and he jerks himself frantically trying to dislodge toby, but toby hangs on like grim death. desperate, dwight grabs toby's bandaged hand, bringing it close to his own face, and bites the stump of toby's injured finger as hard as he can. toby and pearl scream simultaneously. pearl in horror, toby in pain. pearl runs into her bedroom. toby reels back in pain, holding his freshly bleeding hand. dwight takes his chance, grabs toby by the throat, forces him down onto the floor and begins to choke the boy. toby's eyelids begin to flutter. he's losing consciousness. wham! from out of nowhere a baseball bat hits dwight flat across the shoulder blades, knocking the breath out of him, stunning him momentarily. as he looks up, we see caroline, one of the baseball bats from the utility porch drawn back, aimed at dwight's head, ready to strike again.}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(level)}
<D>__{get away from him or i will kill you.}
<A>__{toby manages to stand up, caroline speaks to both of them.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i got the scholarship and he went nuts. he's crazy, and i'm leaving.}
<P>__{(screams it)}
<D>__{i'm leaving!}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{great. go!}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{give me my paper route money, and you'll never have to see my face again.}
<C>__{dwight}
<P>__{(manages a smile)}
<D>__{that money is gone with the wind.}
<P>__{(as toby stares)}
<D>__{that's right. i spent it as you made it. it's gone. poof.}
<A>__{toby starts for dwight again. caroline grabs him, saying, "no. no. no," over and over, literally dragging toby away from dwight. caroline looks at dwight.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{it's not so much that you're disappointing it's that you're consistently disappointing.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{oh, fancy, fancy talk fancy talk for a whore. i know a thing or two about a thing or two. i got friends in this town that tell me things, and i found out some man down at that campaign headquarters found you a job in washington, d.c. gonna run off with him, aren't you, miss whore?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{he's just a friend.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{miss liar. miss whore liar.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i'm leaving, mom. you can leave, too. you don't have to stay here.}
<A>__{caroline takes three full beats and then her face changes. she speaks wonderingly:}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i don't, do i?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{no, you don't.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i could leave with you, couldn't i?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{yes, you could!}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{what about me?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i could just walk right out that door, couldn't i?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{yes, you could!}
<A>__{caroline takes a deep breath, a weight has been lifted.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{my god... the lightness.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{what about me?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i'm leaving, too.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{oh, dwight, why do you want me to stay? you don't even like me, not really.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{you're not leaving!}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(gentle)}
<D>__{look again, dwight i'm already gone.}
<A>__{dwight makes a terrible noise of frustration and rage, doubles his fists, and starts toward caroline. immediately toby grabs the baseball bat and holds it out, ready to strike, as the two begin to back toward the door.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{... you two've always sided in against me, always thought you were better than me. i tried. i did the best i could. what about me? am i supposed to just crawl off in a ditch someplace and die? i've always been the nigger. everybody's nigger. ever since i was little.}
<A>__{caroline and toby are at the door, run across the yard and down the street. dwight stands in the doorway, yelling:}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{what about me? when is it ever dwight's turn for some consideration? what about me? i will tell you one thing you'll remember me!}
<L>__{exterior field minutes later}
<A>__{caroline and toby slow to a walk after running, laughing, and catch their breaths.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{man, oh man.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{man, oh man, oh man.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{well, we're out.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{great, isn't it?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{yes. it's great. and you got the scholarship! congratulations, honey.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{yeah, i'm out! i'm outta here! maybe i will crash and burn, but it's a chance, so i'm gone! i'm history, histoire. nobody's gonna tell me what to do now, nobody. i'm free as a bird. sayonara nest.}
<P>__{(yells it; really bawls it out)}
<D>__{heaven on a june day!}
<A>__{caroline's smile becomes fixed during toby's speech and she begins to regard him oddly.}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{yeah, heaven on a june day...}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{what'd he say about you having a job in d.c.?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{oh, helen found me something in a real estate office, but...}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{so now you can go! oh. oh! i am so damn glad to get out of this place! i will be in 'fourth form.' doesn't that sound great? and if you get a two bedroom place in d.c., i can come for vacations and summers. i'm out. i'm out!}
<A>__{caroline's eyes well up, and she lights a cigarette.}
<C>__{toby}
<P>__{(notices she's upset)}
<D>__{what? oh, don't cry he's not worth it.}
<A>__{as sad as she is, caroline smiles...}
<B>__{toby}
<A>__{she holds toby at arm's length and studies him.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{my you've grown, haven't you.}
<A>__{then clutches him to her fiercely. smiling, the two walk on through the sunny afternoon, singing softly to each other.}
<L>__{exterior bus station day}
<A>__{caroline and toby stand next to a bus as the driver starts the engine. she is close to tears.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{are you sure you'll be all right?}
<C>__{toby}
<P>__{(nice)}
<D>__{get on the bus.}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(stuffing bills into his pocket)}
<D>__{i borrowed money from everybody i know it's the two hundred you need for the tuition, and an extra fifty. buy yourself a blazer. oh, god. i will miss you. i will write you. you sure your hand's okay?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{get on the bus, mom.}
<A>__{caroline puts her arms around toby, kisses his cheek hard, then whispers something into his ear. when toby speaks, his words are full of love:}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i know that, mom. i've always known that.}
<A>__{caroline gets onto the bus, the doors close, whoosh and the bus pulls away. we see caroline's face at a window. as the bus recedes, toby turns and walks in another direction. his face is shining, incandescent with happiness. he breaks into a wide grin.}
