<L>__{exterior a clearing day}
<A>__{elliot is climbing a rope dangling high from a tree as franklin and eleanor look up at him. franklin is standing on crutches. elliot descends with a flourish as helena approaches franklin with a single cane.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{franklin, let go of your crutches. you're not going to need them.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{we're going to make your arms function as your legs.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{how is that possible?}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{elliot, go to your father and stand on his left side.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{think this may work, pop.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{eleanor, take the crutch.}
<A>__{eleanor takes one crutch as helena takes the other, replacing it in franklin's hand with a cane. then, with elliot on franklin's left side she bends elliot's arm at a right angle, like a parallel bar, and hooks franklin's left arm around his. going over to franklin's right side she puts a cane in his hand.}
<C>__{helena}
<P>__{(to franklin)}
<D>__{now use your right shoulder and pull your left leg forward.}
<A>__{he does so.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{good! now with the muscles in your left shoulder, pull your right leg.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{one small bump and i will land right on my keister!}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{that's what elliot is for. he's going to hold you up. hitch your leg! come on!}
<A>__{franklin and elliot attempt to walk. it requires immense strength and effort on both their parts.}
<C>__{helena}
<P>__{(ever the taskmaster)}
<D>__{elliot, don't lean in stand up straight. pull against him. he needs you!}
<A>__{after one or two steps the enormity of it overwhelms franklin.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{i can't.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{i'm strong, pop. you can't hurt me.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{you can do this, franklin! keep going!}
<A>__{they start the walk again. it's awkward... difficult... but it's working.}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{i will be damned.}
<A>__{franklin stops, exhausted.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{franklin, are you all right?}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{i'm fine. i'm just...}
<A>__{roy runs in with a chair and helps franklin into it as helena, eleanor, louis, elliot and roy all look at him, concerned.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{this isn't a replacement for the real work we're doing to get you on your feet again, understand? no one is throwing in the towel or even agreeing with that doctor's report...}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{i know, i know.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{i know it's not practical }
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{no, it's not.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{it's political.}
<A>__{franklin looks at louis, then to eleanor, and realizes that this could be it.}
