<D>__{maybe the shock of his first homer was just too much for him.}
<B>__{at the green fiberglass fence}
<A>__{scotty runs right up to it clutches desperately. panting. trembling. the guys arrive. scotty turns back to them... he has aged 25 years.}

<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{no! you don't understand! that wasn't my ball!}
<A>__{the gang's pov of something moving in the backyard. just a rippling shadow and trailing dust accompanying it over the fence top.}
<C>__{the gang's}
<A>__{eyes go to scotty.}
<C>__{squints}
<D>__{whadda you mean it wasn't your ball?}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{it's my stepdad's. i stole it from his trophy room. it was a present or soemthing somebody gave it to him. we have to get it back. he's gonna kill me!}
<C>__{squints}
<D>__{smalls... listen to me. this is a matter of life and death.}
<P>__{(thinks)}

<C>__{squints}
<D>__{some lady?...}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{yeah, she even signed her name on it.}

<C>__{gang}
<D>__{baaayyybe ruuuuuth?!}
<C>__{the gang}
<A>__{sprints for the fence. scramble up it. just their eyes peer over the top.}
<B>__{what they see}
<A>__{a baseball in a little impact crater. a ball that has most clearly been autographed by... babe ruth. a long, hideous forelimb thrusts from 'neath the lean to. a massive paw thing comes down on the ball. drags it slowly away... leaving a baseball deep furrow in the dirt. the canine "laughter" comes again...}
<C>__{the gang}
<A>__{drops from the fence turn to face scotty.}
<C>__{denunez}
<D>__{the beast got it.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{you're dead as a doornail, smalls.}
<C>__{repeat}
<D>__{you're dead as a doornail, smalls.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{nice knowing you.}
<C>__{repeat}
<D>__{nice knowing }
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{ shut up, tommy.}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{smalls, you mean to tell me you went home and swiped a ball that was signed by babe ruth, and brought it out here and actually played with it?}
<C>__{repeat}
<D>__{and actually played with it?!}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{yeah, but i was gonna put it back.}
<C>__{squints}
<D>__{but it was signed by babe ruth!}

<D>__{oh, my god! that's the same guy?!}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{yeah. smalls, babe ruth is the greatest baseball player that ever lived. people say he was less than a god, but more than a man. ya know... like hercules or somethin'.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the ball that you just aced to the beast is worth... well, more than your whole life.}
<A>__{scotty falls to his knees. grabs his stomach.}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{i don't feel so good.}
<A>__{they all step back, expecting the worst. then, they fan him with their baseball caps.}
<C>__{scotty }
<P>__{(heartfelt)}
<D>__{we gotta get that ball back.}
