<D>__{listen, i need to ask you something.}
<C>__{pat }
<D>__{tomorrow can i spend half the day with you and half the day at the eagles game?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{i'm gonna pretend that you didn't just ask me that.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{these are the two days that you have promised me and that we have prepared to nail the big move. it's not ready yet. and we don't have a move yet.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{i know, but my dad opened up to me and it was really beautiful and i wanna be of service to him, okay? and he's worried that the juju from the eagles is being fucked up and he's concerned that it's because i'm spending time with you.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{oh, i messed up the eagles' juju?}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{no, you're not messing up the juju, but the juju is messed up because i'm not with him during the games.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{guess what?}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{nikki replied to your letter.}
<A>__{tiffany steps to the staircase, lifting an envelope.}
<C>__{tiffany }
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{but you can't read it until after you nail the big move. go.}
<A>__{pat sighs as she turns sharply, places the envelope on the staircase again. cut to: pat braces himself at far side of studio to catch tiffany's big leap tiffany braces herself to run she runs leaps the fall. they do it again, same results.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{tiff, i'm sorry. i can't do anything else without reading nikki's letter, okay? it's just , it's in the back of my head. we don't almost have it, all right?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{i just hope you can handle it.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{thank you.}
<B>__{tiffany picks up the envelope and turns.}
<C>__{pat }
<D>__{what was her energy when she gave it to you?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{she was intrigued, excited, and a little scared.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{she was scared? about what? did she tell you?}
<B>__{pat takes the envelope.}
<A>__{camera tilts down onto his hands, opening the envelope.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{try to stay positive.}
<A>__{pat's hands unfold the typed letter.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{i'm just gonna read it out loud, okay? because if she says anything that's, you know, is that too much to ask?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{pat looks down at the letter, reading silently.}
<C>__{tiffany }
<D>__{i thought you were gonna read it out loud.}
<C>__{pat}
<D>__{okay. sorry.}
<P>__{(reading)}
<C>__{pat }
<D>__{"dear pat, it was very emotional for me to get your letter, as i'm sure you can imagine, but i'm glad you took the risk of discreetly getting it to me through tiffany. this gives us a chance to communicate while i keep the restraining order until i feel safe. i must admit you sound terrific and i'm happy that you are feeling so positive and becoming a more loving and caring man, which i always knew you were. i was moved to read about `excelsior' and your belief in happy endings. i am also moved by your act of love to read the books i have taught at the high school. i'm sorry you find them so negative, but i disagree. i think they are great works of art that reflect how hard life can be and they can also help kids prepare themselves for the hardness of life. in spite of all these positive developments, pat, i have to say if it's me reading the signs, i need to see something to prove you are ready to resume our marriage. otherwise i find myself thinking that we might both be better off moving on with our lives separately. please don't react quickly to this, but take time to think about it. i'm glad you're doing so well. love, nikki."}
<A>__{pat folds up the letter again. he is kind of crying.}
<C>__{pat }
<D>__{i think i'm done for today, okay?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<P>__{(follows him to door)}
<D>__{she said to show her something, pat. this dance can be that something. you would have never done something like this in a million years. it shows all kinds of skills on so many different levels: focus, collaboration, discipline. it's romantic, like i said it would be. it's for her.}
<C>__{pat}
<P>__{(over his shoulder)}
<D>__{thanks for the letter. i will see you tomorrow, okay?}
<B>__{pat walks out.}
