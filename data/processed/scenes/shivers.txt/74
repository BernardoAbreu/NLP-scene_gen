<L>__{interior garage night}
<A>__{st. luc races through the garage, trying to find forsythe. he finally sees her car in the middle of the exit ramp and runs over to it. the doorman is still on top of forsythe in the front seat of the car. st. luc pulls the doorman's gun out of its holster and begins smashing away at the doorman with it. the doorman pounds st. luc in the temple with his fist and lifts himself partially off forsythe, half turning toward st. luc, who is staggered by the blow. the doorman's face is covered with blood and drool. repulsed and terrified, st. luc fires the gun into the doorman's upper body three times, heedless of the possibility that he might hit forsythe. the doorman slumps over forsythe. st. luc grips the gun and staggers over to the car. he pulls the doorman off forsythe, who is completely soaked with blood. she has obviously had an externally rough time, but there is nothing to suggest that she has been infected by the doorman. st. luc shoves her over into the passenger's seat, where she slumps, dazed. he doesn't have to start the car it's never been turned off. he slams the shift lever into reverse and backs up, peeling rubber, to the base of the ramp. he puts it into first and begins to accelerate, foot to the floor, toward the garage door. another car full of residents suddenly careens in front of the door and screeches to a halt, blocking st. luc, who in swerving to avoid them smashes his fender into a concrete post. he picks up the gun from the console between the seats and, opening the car door, empties the gun at the residents, who are emerging from their car. one of the residents falls back into the car, blocking the other two. st. luc drags forsythe out of the car, throws her over his shoulder, and carries her down the ramp toward the door leading to the incinerator.}
