<L>__{interior the control room}
<A>__{close on doc he stares at the monitor screen. did he see something or were his eyes playing tricks? he looks across the console and sees the videotape is recording.}
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{on willie she moves to the end of the hall. it ends with two doors.}
<C>__{beck's voice}
<D>__{one minute.}
<A>__{willie hesitates at the junction and pushes open the door on her left, something huge behind it moves it's sixpack. his mechanical arms suddenly rise and in their grasp we see the ship's huge safe.}
<C>__{sixpack}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{i'm rich, honey. rich!}
<A>__{the swamp later the door to the russian ship's safe stands open. bang! bang! jones and dejesus hammer safety deposit boxes with a chisel. while the others watch, sixpack pleads his case with beck.}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{it's all mine if i'm on report. otherwise you gotta take me off report before you look at any more... ain't that right, cobbie?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{you're on your own, sixpack, you fucked up everybody's day off...}
<A>__{dejesus pries off the top from the first safety deposit box and dumps the contents on the workbench...several wallets, wristwatches, a pocket watch, a wedding ring...bowman who stands with a clipboard begins taking inventory.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{personal effects...}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(considering a watch)}
<D>__{timex...}
<A>__{she picks up something else, a pack of soggy chewing gum and tosses it to cobb.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{here's something for you, cobbie.}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(checking a wallet)}
<D>__{russian money...don't look like much.}
<A>__{jones opens the next box and dumps it out onto the table...life savers candy, a postcard of a fat russian woman in a bathing suit. bowman looks at it.}
<C>__{bowman}
<P>__{(grinning to sixpack)}
<D>__{yeah, i'd say you can retire with all this loot.}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{shut up.}
<A>__{everyone chuckles. more papers and a small, book shaped object wrapped in plastic. jones unwraps it. it's a video tape. he looks at the label.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"debbie does dallas"...}
<P>__{(looks up and grins)}
<D>__{hell, it's in russian. i can't read it...}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{may i see it?}
<A>__{jones hands it to doc who looks at it.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{it's a log of some sort.}
<A>__{jones pries the lid off another box and dumps it out papers, more cheap watches. on sixpack he notices something silver, the size of a paperback book, under a stack of papers. discreetly he covers the object with a piece of paper and slides it off the table out of sight. jones opens the last box, and something rolls across the table toward the edge and starts to drop when it is caught by dejesus. he holds it up and we see a clear liquor bottle.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{vodka.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{what assholes, they lock booze in the safe.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{probably confiscated. no booze on board, same as us.}
<A>__{doc turns the bottle around in dejesus' hand so he can read the label.}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(eyeing the bottle)}
<D>__{stolichnaya.}
<A>__{everyone looks at doc.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{you read russian?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{russian, french, italian, spanish, greek, german, a little hindu, some serbo croat and a smattering of swahili...standard pre med background...}
<A>__{cobb stares at him a second then:}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{bullshit.}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{...and a russian grandmother...}
<A>__{beck ignores them and addresses bowman.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{i want all this stuff impounded in the supply safe.}
<A>__{he lifts the bottle of stolie out of dejesus' hands.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{...except this...it goes in my safe.}
<A>__{a disappointed crew watches beck leave with the bottle. doc stops him.}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(to beck, holding up the videotape)}
<D>__{you mind if i take a look at this?}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(leaving)}
<D>__{be my guest.}
<A>__{ring corridor later the gloomy corridor outside the infirmary. it is empty, silent. suddenly the door to the infirmary opens slightly and bowman peeks out. seeing the corridor is empty she slips out with a a manila folder. dormitory same bowman hands the envelope to dejesus, who's grinning delightedly.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{you got 'em!}
<A>__{sixpack and jones are there too. sixpack scowls.}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{what good's the kid's med records anyway!}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{watch and learn, amigo...}
<A>__{control room later}
<B>__{close on monitor screen}
<A>__{we see a thin, bearded man in his late fifties, a russian ship's captain talking to the camera in russian. the tape is of poor quality and water spotted.}
<C>__{doc's voice}
<P>__{(translating)}
<D>__{another party last night. more vodka. the infirmary is filled as it is. i confiscate what i can, but i know the government observers have more...}
<A>__{suddenly, the captain hears a noise off screen and goes to the camera and turns it off. the tape goes blank.}
<B>__{on doc}
<A>__{he stops the tape and presses another button on the console. willie's video of the huge hole in the hull of the ship appears on another screen.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{see that gash? the way the edges protrude inward is like from a torpedo explosion. it couldn't have come from within. like an accident.}
<A>__{he looks back at beck who we see is sitting behind him, and has also been watching the tape. beck looks at doc and shrugs.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{what do you want me to say? that it all sounds mysterious?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{these observers were doing something. a test...i think they sank that ship on purpose to cover up their mistakes.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{what mistakes?}
<P>__{(he shakes his head wearily)}
<D>__{look, i think it's no big deal but if you want to find out why this ship sank have maritime run a check.}
<A>__{he gets up and goes to the door. doc watches him.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i did. they have no record of the wreck.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the marshal goloviev is now on a tour in the baltic sea.}
<A>__{beck stops. this is a mystery. close on combination lock beck's quarters same fingers fiddle with the combination. he pulls on the handle. the safe doesn't budge.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<P>__{(whisper)}
<D>__{it's not the phone number...}
<A>__{we pull back to see that dejesus is alone in beck's darkened quarters, he talks to the p.a. suddenly we hear bowman's voice over the intercom.}
<C>__{bowman's voice}
<P>__{(on intercom)}
<D>__{okay, try the social security number...}
<A>__{dejesus puts his fingers back, on the safe dial.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{okay, give it to me...}
