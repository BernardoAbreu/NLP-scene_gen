<L>__{interior mompos jail cell night}
<A>__{the jail might be old, but the cells are secure enough. they're also unsanitary and thoroughly unpleasant. gordy and armstrong are led in by the federales. the fat federale has armstrong's hat. he looks it over, wondering why gordy wanted it. then decides he could give a fuck and tosses it to armstrong. clangs the cell door shut and locks it. leaves shaking his head.}

<D>__{you shouldn't have helped me.}
<C>__{armstrong}
<D>__{yeah, well, i guess all these assholes down here are just starting on my nerves.}
<A>__{gordy's silent. it's over. he's come up short. he's going home.}
<C>__{armstrong}
<D>__{so what the hell did you do to land us in here? and don't jerk me around, eh?}
<A>__{beat. gordy sits.}

<A>__{gordy just looks at him.}
<C>__{armstrong}
<D>__{did you even have a plan?}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{yeah. go to caguan, find the wolf and kill him.}
<A>__{armstrong just shakes his head. beat.}
<B>__{door to cell area}
<A>__{bangs open. federales lead in two men the two guerrillas surprised earlier by the heavy camouflaged infiltrators. the federales are armed with batons and stun guns, taking no chances. it's clear the rebels weren't brought here without a struggle, either both are cut and bruised. the tougher looking of the two has taken a real beating. this beaten man is jammed face first against the bars of gordy's cell. he makes eye contact with gordy while the other rebel is unbound and put into a cell. then the beaten man is shoved into the cell. a solid, brick wall separates them from gordy and armstrong. armstrong's seen the patches on their uniforms. to gordy, sotto }
