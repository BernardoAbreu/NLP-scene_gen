<B>__{outside car}
<A>__{the subway car sits at the end of the platform, windows dimly glowing in the dark. the door opens, and manny and peter snatch the lower half and wing pieces back into the car. inside car a little later the lower half of the insect has been moved into the car. susan is reassembling it.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{so, you're saying this is like those bugs that that look like twigs or leaves or...}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(shakes her head)}
<D>__{that's camouflage...}
<A>__{susan displays the partly charred head.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{this is mimicry. they evolve to mimic their predators. a butterfly can look like the eyes of an owl. a catterpillar can copy a snake...}
<A>__{susan closes the multiple mouth parts into a self contained bud shape, then pushes back the "face" mandibles.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{this has evolved to mimic the most dangerous predator it's ever had...}
<A>__{she holds it in her hand, like yorick's skull. the mimic's head obscenely mirrors her own. she inserts it into the shoulder cavity. she stands back.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{us.}
<A>__{camera cranes up and reveals that the thing now looks like}
<B>__{the overcoat man.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{mantids can mimic. we gave the judas that code...}
<C>__{manny}
<P>__{(quotes)}
<D>__{"...and behold he will come that walks as a man, yet is not a man ..."}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{this, is our baby peter. yours and mine. aren't you proud?}
<A>__{outside of the car in the tunnels we see four shadows move fast, scuttling on the walls and ceiling... ...heading towards the car...}
<B>__{inside the car}
<A>__{a subway map on the wall. red, blue, and orange lines branching through the boroughs like veins.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{all these...they're like tunnels of an insect colony. once these things hit a certain population density, they'll have to move out, form new colonies.}
<A>__{the realization hits the others.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{we have to get help down here. burn the tunnels before...}
<A>__{she's interrupted by a clicking from the tunnel ahead. it's answered by clicking from the tunnel behind.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{get the doors!}
<A>__{a brief glimpse down the car shows too many other doors to close in time.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{is there a switch?}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{third rail is dead.}
<P>__{(to manny and susan.)}
<D>__{get me up. there must be a manual override in the booth.}
<A>__{manny and susan help leonard up.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(whispering to peter)}
<D>__{the lights!}
<A>__{peter turns off the flashlights. susan and manny help leonard to the car's control booth. peter looks}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{where the silhouette of a mimic moves to the rear of the car.}
<B>__{control booth}
<A>__{leonard opens a box on the side wall marked manual override. inside, there is a large, hexagonal shaped hole.}
<C>__{leonard}
<P>__{(starts looking around)}
<D>__{where's the damn crank?!}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{the mimic is only yards away. other shadows emerge from the distant dark.}
<B>__{inside}
<A>__{manny leaves leonard and susan to look for the lever crank. he runs to help peter try and shut the doors manually. but it's useless. many of the doors won't budge.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(hissing a whisper)}
<D>__{they're coming!}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{the shadows get nearer, their clicking louder...}
<B>__{control booth}
<A>__{susan looks under the dashboard, finds a hexagonal shaped rod. the lever crank.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i got it!}
<A>__{susan gives it to leonard. he jams the rod into the hexagonal shaped hole. perfect fit. leonard begins cranking the thing. but it's rusty and slow...}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{hurry! please!}
<B>__{throughout subway car}
<A>__{the doors begin to swing shut very slowly. outside a mimic's pov sees the moving doors, starts heading for them.}
<B>__{control booth}
<A>__{leonard can't crank fast enough. susan joins in, putting her hands over leonard's. both spin the thing as fast as possible.}
<B>__{subway car}
<A>__{peter and manny each pulling on a door, trying to speed up the closing process. shadows are seen approaching, now very close.}
<B>__{control booth}
<A>__{leonard and susan put all their effort into turning the crank one more time...}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{come on, you son of a...}
<B>__{subway car}
<A>__{a soft click as the doors shut in unison. silence. all four are stock still, like a submarine crew awaiting the blast of depth charges. their eyes dart to the}
<B>__{windows}
<A>__{caked with soot, irradiated by the distant glow of one of the red flares. thuck! something bumps against the door. a machine gun patter of footsteps on the roof. the car shakes.}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{the dark platform is alive with phantom shapes.}
<B>__{inside}
<A>__{screeech!! something sharp is drawn along the car roof like a nail over a chalkboard. thump! thump! impacts on the sides... an obscene symphony of sounds as mimics lay siege to the car.}
<B>__{peter}
<A>__{a buzz of wings catches his attention. he turns. his face is reflected in a security window. crack! the window splinters, destroying peter's reflection.}
<B>__{above manny}
<A>__{claws scratch the ceiling. it begins to dent.}
<B>__{below susan and leonard}
<A>__{large forms clicking underneath, looking for a way in. susan stares at the floor, her eyes following the course of the clicking... ...which leads to leonard's wounded, bloodstained leg.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{oh, god.}
<P>__{(looks at leonard.)}
<D>__{the blood...}
<A>__{klanggg! a mimic leg pierces the ceiling above them! susan pulls leonard out of the way just in time as}
<B>__{in the subway car}
<A>__{klang! klang! more legs break through the ceiling!}
<B>__{susan and leonard}
<A>__{emerge from the control booth, leonard's arm over susan's shoulder.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{his blood! it's driving them crazy! we have to mask the odor!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{how?!}
<A>__{but there's not time enough to discuss possible solutions. leonard pulls off his jacket. susan begins wrapping it around his wound to mask it. manny helps. peter has upended one shelf, jamming it against a broken window as a barricade. despite their efforts, the mimics are not thrown off the scent.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{it's no use! they know we're in here!}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{they don't know anything peter, they just sense. they're hardwired!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{right. hardwired to eat anything that's not like them!}
<A>__{the whole car is now shaking and buckling.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{exac...}
<A>__{she looks over at the severed mimic corpse nearby. a realization...}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(to manny)}
<D>__{give me your razor.}
<A>__{manny looks at her blankly. susan just takes the blade. the whole car is now shaking and buckling. she runs to the mimic's carcass. for a moment, she hesitates. but the pandemonium leaves her little choice. she slices into the mimic's corpse with the razor...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{...sticks her arm in all the way to the elbow... ...and pulls out two fat amber sacs the size of softballs. she slices them open. orange goo leaks out, its stench overpowering.}
<C>__{leonard}
<P>__{(covers his nose)}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{peter looks up as susan slides one of the sacs over to him.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{rub it on the windows!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{what }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{just do it!!}
<A>__{holding his breath, against the stench, he smears the crap on the windows, the doorframe...}
<B>__{manny}
<A>__{looks to the roof, listening. and remarkably, the sounds of the mimics start}
<B>__{subsiding.}
<A>__{susan comes over to leonard, begins dabbing the goop on leonard's wound. leonard makes a face at the stink.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{what are you putting that crap on me for?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{scent glands. insects use 'em to identify themselves to each other.}
<A>__{she smears the floor area behind leonard. the activity winds down gradually, and finally comes almost to a halt.}
