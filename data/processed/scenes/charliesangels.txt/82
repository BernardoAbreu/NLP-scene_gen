<L>__{interior knox living room night}
<A>__{we pan off a half played scrabble game to find dylan and knox at the windows. dylan picks up a family photo, knox as a little boy with a father in a military uniform.}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{that's you, hunh? cute kid. cute family.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{thanks.}
<P>__{(taking the photo)}
<D>__{it's the only picture i have of me with my parents. they died a week later.}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{oh. oh, i'm sorry. i had no idea...}
<A>__{charlie's angels 8 18 99}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{please, don't apologize. i was too young to understand.}
<P>__{(looking at the photo)}
<D>__{i never knew how they died. when i was a kid, when i got shuffled from one foster home to another, i always thought they just disappeared.}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{but...?}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{i only found out later, my father was in the military. he and my mother were killed while he was on assignment, somewhere in eastern europe.}
<P>__{(mostly to himself)}
<D>__{the files were classified, but i read enough to know that he was a good man. apparently, he was betrayed by one of his own team.}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{wow. that's a lot for a kid to live with.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{yeah, but it motivated me, losing my family. it still does. i don't take anything for granted.}
<A>__{dylan nods.}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{boy did i have you pegged wrong.}
<C>__{knox}
<P>__{(intrigued)}
<D>__{how do you mean?}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{well, to be honest, i thought you were a rich kid who inherited everything. but that's pretty typical. i've got instincts for the job, but when it comes to men? well...}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{i'm glad you don't see me as just a client.}
<A>__{he brushes his hand against hers. she brushes back, fingers against fingers. a long beat. charlie's angels 8 18 99}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{oh. well, you are, so...}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{is there someone you need to be going home to?}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but i...}
<A>__{he kisses her. after a moment, she breaks off. it's not that it was a bad kiss. it was a damn good kiss. it's just...}
<C>__{dylan }
<D>__{i shouldn't.}
<A>__{knox moves towards her.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{shouldn't you?}
<A>__{dylan holds him back.}
<C>__{dylan}
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{no. i shouldn't.}
<A>__{she stands up.}
<C>__{dylan }
<D>__{thank you for dinner, mr. knox. and lock the door behind me.}
<A>__{she gets up and leaves.}
