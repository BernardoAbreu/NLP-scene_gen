<A>__{we see a hill and on top of it is a pastor marrying maggie and ike, in beautiful wedding attire. we see maggie walk down a leaf lined aisle to a waiting ike. they kiss as we hear the vows and hear them each say "i do". they kiss a twirling, whirling kiss, a circular kiss. we hear the applause of about twenty people. slowly, we see the twenty people come over the crest of the hill. they are all maggie's family and friends, plus the old grooms. they are all paired in twos, like a love noah's ark. we see others get the news.}
