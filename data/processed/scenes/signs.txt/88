<A>__{graham stands frozen looking across his yard. isabelle, the dog turns in desperate circles behind him. graham's eyes stay focused on the same point in the darkness. he talks to no one.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{you know something? even entertaining the possibility of this for a minute has been exciting.}
<A>__{beat. graham starts to move.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i can see how people can get carried away with this type of thing.}
<A>__{graham reaches the barbecue area. there's a flashlight on the picnic table. graham turns the flashlight on. a narrow}
<B>__{beam falls on the grass five feet ahead of him.}
<A>__{graham starts toward the crops.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{it's a kind of faith. it's an intoxicating thing to believe in something you can't see.}
<B>__{the beam of light falls on the wall of corn crops lining the}
<A>__{backyard. graham steps right up to them. he hesitates and then steps into the field of}
<B>__{corn crops.}
<A>__{we can't see two feet in any direction. six foot stalks of corn line graham on all sides. the flashlight throws a}
<B>__{wavering beam on the crops ahead of him.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{you were always good at that...}
<A>__{the beam of his flashlight finds a narrow path. graham starts following it. his shoulders brush crops on either side.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{believing in things you couldn't see.}

<D>__{you would have been the first person on that station wagon wouldn't you? you and morgan would have been wrestling for that baby monitor.}
<B>__{something moves up ahead.}
<A>__{graham stops. he shines his light down the path. nothing but crops disappearing into darkness.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{it'll be secretly kind of sad for everybody, when this turns out to be all just make believe.}
<A>__{there's movement right next to him. graham spins and aims the flashlight at the crops to his right. the light only}
<B>__{penetrates a few feet into the crops.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{you're wasting your time here! i'm not going to report this or anything you do to me crops, to the news or tv or anybody! you're not going to get famous!}
<A>__{beat. there is no response. graham can hear his own breathing... it sounds heavy, echoish... like there's two of}
<B>__{him.}
<A>__{beat. graham holds his breath. the sound of someone else}
<B>__{breathing continues behind him.}
<A>__{graham turns and drops the flashlight at the same time. the}
<B>__{beam of light turns off when the flashlight hits the ground. graham is in darkness now. he looks in the direction of the}
<A>__{breathing. but can't see anything. his own breathing is}
<B>__{fast and loud now.}
<A>__{graham kneels down and gropes in the darkness. his hands search over the ground in all directions. they finally touch the flashlight. graham quickly fumbles with it to find the "on" button. he does.}
<B>__{a beam of light shoots across the ground. something powdery white stands five feet away.}
<A>__{it instantly moves into the darkness. graham tries to get up. he stumbles backwards into the crops. he's tangled in crops as he struggles to rise. he gets up and starts running. leaves and stalks slap him from all directions. he panics. he doesn't know where he is. there is something coming}
<B>__{behind him.}
<A>__{graham makes a sudden right turn. he puts his hands in front of him to protect his face and eyes. he's running as fast as he can. he hears stalks of corn breaking behind him. another sudden turn, this time left. graham emerges into his}
<B>__{backyard.}
<A>__{graham keeps running across the yard. isabelle barks}
<B>__{frantically.}
<A>__{when graham reaches the porch stairs, he stops and turns. there is no one behind him. the wall of crops fifty feet away sway in the gentle night breeze. graham gains control of his breathing. he turns and walks to the screen door, slowing his breathing down with each step.}
