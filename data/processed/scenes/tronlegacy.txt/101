<A>__{rush and krod plummet into surging hot data, out of control. flynn and fighters expertly surf huge waves.}
<L>__{exterior data buffer shore}
<A>__{flynn, boole and quantz drag rush and krod from data shallows. everyone's circuits are hot and overloaded.}

<D>__{i'm cool. not a problem.}
<A>__{they let him go him go. krod glitches, collapses. rush gets to his feet, head spinning.}

<D>__{do you know hard it is? opposing the power of plexor?}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{it's like the forty sixth level of conquerdome 6.1, while winning a side game of tetras ultra, doing six instant messages and debugging a demo.}

<C>__{krod}
<D>__{say what?}
<A>__{flynn accepts a handshake from rush.}
<C>__{flynn}

<C>__{boole}
<D>__{there is one possible route.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{we'll meet up with the code monkeys and combine forces.}
