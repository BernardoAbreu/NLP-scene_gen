<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior orderly room day}
<B>__{medium shot peen warden mazzioli}
<A>__{warden is pinning some notices on a bulletin board. prew sits on the bench against the wall, miserable, elbows on knees, chin in hand. there is a quiet tenseness in the room. warden looks over at prew, turns back to the bulletin board. mazzioli gets up from his desk, wanders aimlessly to a window. the screen door slams and leva enters, eating a candy bar.}
<C>__{leva}
<D>__{any word on maggio's court martial?}
<C>__{mazzioli}
<D>__{it's on right now. at headquarters.}
<A>__{lava sits on the bench beside prew, shakes his head.}
<C>__{leva}
<D>__{he'll get the stockade sure.}
<A>__{the others tense at the word "stockade," glare at leva as if he had no right to mention it. their fear of the place, now that it is imminent even for another soldier, is shown on their faces. there is a long pause.}
<C>__{mazzioli}
<D>__{maybe he won't get it. all he did was get drunk and run wild. that's a soldier's nature. it's almost his sacred duty once in a while.}
<A>__{there is another pause. warden barks suddenly, fiercely, at leva.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{what you hangin around here for?}
<C>__{leva}
<D>__{can't a man rest himself for a min }
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{what man? i can't stand to see people restin themselves. i'm eccentric. if you ain't got no work maybe i can scare you up some.}
<A>__{mumbling, leva rises and goes out. warden goes over to prew.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{whyn't you go on over to the day room, shoot a little pool?}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{i will let you know when the word comes through.}
<A>__{prew looks up, nods, rises. he is half way to the door when the phone at the clerk's desk rings. prew turns. mazzioli stares at the phone as if afraid to touch it. warden goes over, answers.}
<C>__{warden}
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{compny g, first sergeant warden speaking... yes, sir... yes, sir, i will... i will have his things in order... yes, sir.}
<A>__{warden puts down phone. he looks at the waiting men.}
