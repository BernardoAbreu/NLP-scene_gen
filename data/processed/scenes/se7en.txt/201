<L>__{exterior city street later day}
<A>__{sidewalks jammed with people, hurrying. somerset walks in a fog, hands in his pockets. he stops at a corner, but does not cross. he stands there, looks up. at the city around him. the buildings towering over him. at the cars, buses and taxies racing in the streets, blowing their horns and spouting soot. somerset reaches into his jacket pocket, takes out the envelope from john doe. he studies it in his hand.}

<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{oh... man...}
<A>__{he opens it. he takes out a small note, handwritten. it reads:}
<C>__{plow them under.}
<A>__{somerset looks up again, mortified, fighting to keep control of his emotions. he looks around: at the miserable people, walking past him. at a man at the top of the subway station stairs, sitting in a cardboard box, holding out a cup, rattling the change inside. a father passes by, holding his young son's hand. somerset turns to watch them as they pass. the gather reaches to pick the boy up and carry him. the boy holds tight. for some reason, this makes somerset ache with sorrow. the father hugs his son to him, kisses him on the cheek. the boy returns the kiss, with great affection. somerset watches them disappear in the mass of humanity. he looks back at the note in his hand. he tears the note up, into little pieces.}
