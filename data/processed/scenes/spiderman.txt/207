<L>__{exterior the center night}
<A>__{it rotates and drops. the helicopters come in like the cavalry.}
<L>__{interior control room night}
<A>__{trying to leave it, liz and spidey are confronted with a nightmare. the room is tilted at a 45% angle. pipes are bursting. spidey helps liz through the obstacles. debris rains down. they come face to face with a diagonal maze of pipes.}
<D>__{spider man maybe there's another way...}
<A>__{a huge crack opens above them.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{it's breaking apart! spider man alright, keep moving, a step at a time!}
<A>__{they scale the maze, but as they emerge on the other side, half the floor falls away! central park awaits, 8,000 feet below.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{we have to go back. spider man we can't go back.}
<A>__{he looks across at the door. it is midway up a diagonal wall. he shoots a web up at the ceiling between themselves and the door. then he extends a hand to liz.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{forget it... spider man okay, have it your way.}
<A>__{he swings across and lands on the ledge of the door. then he swings the web back to her like a trapeze. liz catches the web and looks across at spider man, furious.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(shouting across)}
<D>__{what am i supposed to do with this! spider man}
<P>__{(shouting back)}
<D>__{go ahead. it's easier than it looks! we've got to try the fire escape.}
<A>__{liz swings across like tarzan and spidey gathers her in on the ledge. she does a comic "phew" and the ledge buckles beneath them but holds. spider man tries to open the door, but it's stuck.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{the door is stuck.}
<A>__{spider man bends his back to the task. it take all his strength, but with a comic aaaaargghh! he bends the door open.}
