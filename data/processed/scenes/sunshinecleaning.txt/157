<L>__{interior datzman mead house great room afternoon}
<A>__{the room titters with wannabe country clubbers. they nibble appetizers around a pastel tower of gifts. rose lifts a cheese puff to her mouth. she's flanked by paula and a mousey woman in a pink dress and matching pink pumps.}
<C>__{mousey}
<D>__{so rose, what are you doing? are you still cleaning houses?}
<C>__{paula}
<D>__{rose has gone into real estate.}
<C>__{mousey}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{actually, i own my own business.}
<C>__{mousey}
<D>__{a real estate business?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{no. it's a biohazard removal and crime scene clean up service. it's a growth niche industry right now highly technical and competitive.}
<C>__{mousey}
<D>__{what does that mean biohazard removal whatever?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{a lot of times, when somebody dies, it can be kind of, you know, messy. so, we go in and clean up all that left over mess. make sure that the area is clean and sanitary.}
<A>__{paula and mousy exchange a glance infused with disgust.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{people just don't understand the health and safety risks involved in disposing of biological material like blood and body fluids.}
<C>__{paula}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{course, we have a whole arsenal of disinfectants and um... professional techniques. like i said, it's a highly technical and professional operation with a whole complicated, you know... methodology behind it.}
<A>__{pleased with herself, rose grabs another cheese puff.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{real growth industry.}
<C>__{mousey}
<D>__{i can't imagine. you like doing it?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{rose stops. she hadn't thought about whether she liked it.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i do. we come into the lives of people who have just experienced something so sad and profound. they've lost somebody. the circumstances are different but that's the same.}
<A>__{as rose talks, her whole demeanor changes. relaxes. that brittle, self conscious edge dissipates.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{and we help them. in this one small way... we help.}
<A>__{rose is lost in her thoughts. something profound is shifting.}
<C>__{mousey}
<D>__{sounds horrible to me.}
<C>__{paula}
<D>__{i believe i'd vomit.}
