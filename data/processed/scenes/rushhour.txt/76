<A>__{javal hits a remote garage door opener. ahead, rickety doors on one of a line of detached garages facing the alley open up. across from the garage, parked parallel against the back of an empty building, we notice a duplicate van. it's facing the same direction as javal is driving. javal slams on the brakes, stopping just past the garage, and then quickly backs up into the garage.}
