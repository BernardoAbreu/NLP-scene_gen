<L>__{exterior road by dead sea aerial shot day}
<A>__{we super the following: israel april, 1987 we have an aerial shot over a date plantation which sits incongruously in the middle of the desert beside the dead sea, as we move to reveal a car driving along this barren road. the camera pivots around the car as we see the landscape scroll behind it; the tortured rock formations, the mountains reflected in the water, a desert scape that looks like something out of dante, as peugeot cuts its way along the road.}
