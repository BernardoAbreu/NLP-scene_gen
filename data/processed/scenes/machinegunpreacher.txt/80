<A>__{sam, deng, and a few other spla soldiers jammed into the flatbed of this truck, carrying heavy weapons, bouncing fast over this open dirt road... featureless savanna fading into sporadic mud huts... the outskirts of a village in the distance... and thin columns of black smoke twisting into the air... ... and as the truck gets closer to the village we begin to pass children walking along the side of the road... night commuters returning to their village... some of them huddled together, weeping... ... and we notice sam notices the little boy in the green shorts, walking hand in hand with his sister, their faces quiet masks of fear as they move closer to their home.}
