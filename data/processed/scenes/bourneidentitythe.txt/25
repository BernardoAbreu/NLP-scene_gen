<C>__{abbott}
<D>__{storm clouds are gathering, ted. it looks like rain and i don't have a thing to wear.}
<C>__{conklin}
<D>__{i don't know what we're talking about.}
<C>__{abbott}
<D>__{we're talking about marseille. we're talking about nykwana wombosi. and i'm asking you if this abortion in marseille has anything to do with treadstone.}
<P>__{(silence)}
<D>__{was this treadstone?}
<C>__{conklin}
<D>__{you're asking me a direct question?}
<C>__{abbott}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{conklin}

<A>__{silence. pressure drop.}
<C>__{abbott}
<D>__{they're putting together an agency oversight committee. they're going to look through everyone's budgets. treadstone is a rather sizable line item in my ledger.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what am i going to do about that?}
<C>__{conklin}
<D>__{you'd want to make that go away. you'd want to remind them that treadstone is a training organization. that it's all theoretical. you'd want to sign off on that.}
<C>__{abbott}
<D>__{and what if i couldn't do that?}
<C>__{conklin}
<D>__{then i'd have to explain treadstone. and you'd have to explain how you let me get this far.}
<P>__{(silence)}

<P>__{(abbott staring)}
<D>__{we'll clean up the field. you clean up your budgets.}
