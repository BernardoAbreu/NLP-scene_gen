<L>__{exterior ray's bungalow}
<A>__{the neighborhood is deserted and still. the streetlamps are still on. marty and abby stumble down the front stoop onto the lawn. his hand is still clamped over her mouth. she reaches up, grabs a finger, and bends it back. we hear the bone snap. marty screams. his hand drops. his other hand cuffs her on the side of the head, spinning her around. marty is now clutching his broken finger with his good hand. abby kicks him in the groin. he sinks to his knees, drops forward on one hand, and vomits.}
<B>__{front stoop}
<A>__{ray is coming out the door, hitching up his pants. in his right hand he hold abby's pearl handled revolver.}
<B>__{marty}
<A>__{slowly gets to his feet, looking at ray.}
<B>__{abby}
<A>__{she has backed away from marty and now stands on the lawn, breathing heavily. she looks from ray to marty.}
<B>__{back to marty}
<A>__{backing toward his car, a cadillac parked at curbside, still looking at ray. he turns to get into the car. the german shepherd lopes across the lawn and takes a clean leap into the car through the open window on the passenger side. marty turns the ignition. the engine coughs and dies. he tries again; it starts. the car roars up the street.}
<B>__{ray}
<A>__{watching the car. he looks at abby.}
<B>__{abby}
<A>__{still panting. up the street we can hear marty's car alternately racing and stopping, shifting in and out of gear. his engine rumble starts to grow louder again.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{like to have seen his face when he found the dead end.}
<A>__{in the background we see marty's car roar by in the opposite direction.}
<B>__{mount bonnel evening lateral track}
<A>__{moving past a row of cars parked on an overlook near the top of the mountain. below we can see the lights of the city of austin. the lot is littered with beer cans. we hear the sound of rock music coming from various car radios. several teenagers lean against cars drinking beer; inside the cars we can see the vague forms of others.}
<C>__{teenager}
<D>__{hey mister, how'd you break your pussyfinger?}
<A>__{his friends laugh.}
<B>__{track pulling marty}
<A>__{ignoring the laughter as he walks past the cars, apparently looking for someone. his right index finger is taped up in an aluminum splinterior marty's pov at the end of a row of cars we see a green volkswagon bug. leaning against the hood is visser, still dressed in his rumpled yellow suit. he is smoking a cigarette, talking to a sixteen year old girl in shorts and a tube top. when he notices marty:}
<C>__{visser}
<P>__{(to the girl)}
<D>__{sorry sweetheart, my date is here...}
<A>__{the girl drifts off. marty enters frame and visser turns to him.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{...she saw me rolling a cigarette and thought it was marijuana.}
<P>__{(he laughs)}
<D>__{i guess she thought i was a swinger.}
<A>__{visser open the back door of the car. marty ignores the invitation, walks around to the front on the passenger side and gets in.}
