<L>__{exterior tarmac airport japan}
<A>__{finn pulls mater down hard onto the tarmac, towing him away from the terminal.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{this is first class service. you don't even have to go through the terminal.}
<A>__{acer and grem appear, chasing them. mater, who is facing backward as he is being pulled along, faces them. they're about a hundred yards back.}
<C>__{mater}
<P>__{(to finn)}
<D>__{your karate partners are back here. they kinda look like they're trying to catch up!}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{drive forward. whatever you do, don't stop.}
<A>__{finn skids around, whipping mater in a 180 so that mater is now towing finn. grem produces a rocket, lines up finn as his target. finn, without hesitation, fires a mini rolling jack. the jack drives itself toward grem, anchors itself under his frame and flips him like a turtle but not before grem gets the rocket off the rocket it flies toward mater and finn. finn aims and launches a missile back. the rocket and missile collide in mid air, explode.}
<C>__{mater}
<P>__{(only hearing this)}
<D>__{is everything okay back there?}
<C>__{siddeley }
<D>__{finn, it's sid. i'm on approach.}
<A>__{a gulfstream jet wings into view overhead. this is siddeley.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{roger that.}
<A>__{mater looks up: acer screeches into view up ahead, dragging a long row of luggage carts in mater's path, attempting to create an accident.}
<C>__{mater}
<P>__{(to finn)}
<D>__{you remember that whole thing about me not stopping no matter what?}
<A>__{just as it looks dire ratatatatatatat!!! siddeley descends, hawklike, fires bullets and blows the luggage carts sky high. mater and finn burst through them, luggage now raining down from above.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{i knew i should've done carry on!}
<C>__{finn}
<P>__{(to siddeley)}
<D>__{thanks, old boy!}
<A>__{siddeley lands hard on the tarmac ahead of them. no time to stop, he drops his back open, revealing holley.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{hey, doggone it. it's my imaginary girlfriend!}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{come on! get in here!}
<A>__{mater speeds up toward siddeley's ramp, holley.}
<C>__{mater}
<P>__{(to holley)}
<D>__{boy i tell you what, you really do want this first date, don't ya? that's a no quit attitude right there.}
<A>__{just as mater's wheels touch the ramp, bullets ping around him in a spray. siddeley is hit, a tire blown. he yells in pain.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{hold on, sid!}
<A>__{siddeley peels off the runway onto the grass. a gunfight ensues between finn and acer. finn shoots acer's tire, blowing it and throwing him off course. acer careens out of control, drives up and through a jet out the other side where he lands in an oil tanker. on siddeley he's headed toward the edge of the tarmac, where the grass and runway meet water. he hits the gas, his only hope.}
<C>__{siddeley}
<D>__{finn, it's now or never!}
<A>__{finn brakes, 180s and grabs the ramp just as siddeley gets air.}
<C>__{siddeley}
<D>__{hold on!}
<A>__{mater, the only thing not in the jet, dangles and recedes from our view as siddeley climbs toward the clouds. as he's pulled in through the back hatch:}
<C>__{mater }
<D>__{by the time you read this, i will be safely on an airplane, flying home.}
