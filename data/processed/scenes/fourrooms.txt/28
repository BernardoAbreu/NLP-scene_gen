<L>__{exterior bathroom window night}
<A>__{outside the window, ted's in another world. he's almost safe. it's a strange feeling, kind of like bathing in warm water in paradise, knowing a huge shark is ready to rip his ass off. he can see the flickering red glowing light from the witches' room from the floor below.}
<L>__{exterior bathroom window and below night}
<A>__{ted sees eva bopping naked past the window. he shouts her name out, to no avail. the music drowns out his voice and they ignore his calls for help. the blood rushes to his head. he lets himself hang there for a moment. he wonders how many other people have found themselves in situations like this before him. probably everyone. right next to his face, ted recognizes a bloody hand printerior it's not his blood.}
