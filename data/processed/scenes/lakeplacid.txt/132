<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior beach dusk}
<A>__{the tents are down, everything's packed. a couple trucks remain. the croc is gone. things are quiet. kelly stands down by the water, staring out.}
<B>__{her p.o.v.}
<A>__{hypnotic beauty. the lake doesn't even ripple. she soaks it in as if she knows it may be a while before she ever gets close to this again. she hears every bird. including a distant loon. serenity has returned. then suddenly... a stone goes skipping out, four, five, six skips. kelly turns around. jack stands there. they hold a look.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i thought i should say goodbye to the lake too.}
<A>__{he approaches. takes her hand.}
<C>__{kelly}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{different worlds, jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah, i thought about that as i was driving... and... i haven't found somebody in my world. you found anyone in yours?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{so i was thinking... maybe if i met anybody in my world who was good for you and if you know somebody in new york good for me, we could fix each other up.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you think?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{worth a try. we don't wanna be alone forever, do we?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{probably not.}
<A>__{they hold a look. he kisses her softly.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{that was... y'know if the guy asks me can she kiss, now i will be able to tell him if you can.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{good thinking.}
<A>__{and they kiss again, this one escalates a little. they break. and then he holds her. tightly as the camera pulls up to an aerial view of them, embracing at the water's edge.}
