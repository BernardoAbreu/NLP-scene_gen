<A>__{the street is still alive. a couple of late night juke joints are coughing up the last drunken bits of the party onto the sidewalk to straggle home. easy's car screams around the corner, and then skids in, sending a heavy hipped young sister, about to cross the street, scrambling for cover. he jumps out just as mouse scorches the tires on dupree's '38 packard in behind him.}
