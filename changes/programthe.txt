<ACTION_ALT>__{CLOSE ON JOE KANE}
<ACTION>__{E.S.U. quarterback, barking signals. The ball is snapped, and we go to SLOW MOTION as the lines crash together in the slop. Joe rolls to the right, looking downfield. A huge DEFENSIVE END bears down on him. Joe jukes. The end whips on by, grabbing for jersey, slipping off. But big NUMBER 75 is closing the gap. On the run, Joe releases a desperation pass toward the end zone, just as 75 catches him and buries him face-down in the swamp. We FOLLOW THE BALL, spiraling through the slanting rain. RAY GRIFFEN, black running back, glances back for it, two DEFENSIVE BACKS with him. All three leap in unison, climbing as high as they can, clutching, clawing for the ball. The ball floats down, kisses off the tangle of fingers, splashes to the ground, and rolls to a stop in the mud. Incomplete. The BANG of the final gun snaps us back to LIVE ACTION. Joe on his knees in the muck, stares at the goal line, then drops his head in defeat.}

The Black Tackle comes back, slamming a forearm up under Bud's chin, snapping his neck back. Joe, meanwhile, fades to pass, pump fakes, steps up. Bud Lite, chicken fighting the Black Tackle, sticks his fingers in the Tackle's eyes, then cut-blocks him to the ground. The Tackle falls on Bud, and smashes a fist into his ribs. Bud rolls him over. Joe spots his flanker back, MAURICE WARD, on a flag pattern. Lofts a perfect spiral to him in the corner of the endzone. Touchdown. The crowd goes wild, as Bud Lite pushes off the Black Tackle's throat getting up from the pile. Joe pumps a fist in the air, hugs Ward, as the team celebrates. MUSIC BEGINS.}

It's wartime as tackles and blockers collide, hand-fight, go down, scramble up, collide again, all in pursuit of Joe. Darnell, realizing Joe's in trouble, breaks off his pattern and heads to the center of the end zone. Joe dodges one tackler, shakes free of another's ankle tackle, heads back for the center of the field. He spots Darnell breaking between defensive backs. Just as he's buried by two massive linemen, Joe fires a rocket down the middle toward the sliver of open space that Darnell is heading for. The ball barely clears the hands of a lunging linebacker. Darnell and two defensive backs, one from each side, close on the ball as it cuts through the air, a perfect spiral. Darnell dives. The two defensive backs dive.
