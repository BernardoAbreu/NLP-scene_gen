<L>__{exterior old barn night}
<A>__{the infected posse wally, jack, the older cop, and the redneck recruit are all coming in towards trevor and margaret.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{now, what'd i say?! y'all just sit down! you need to get some goddamn rest! you're sick!}
<A>__{starla watches this, by herself, next to the creek. she eyes a rifle in the dirt. jack grabs a fistful of trevor's hair and restrains his arms. wally pulls his pistols from their holsters and tosses them into the dirt.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{let go!!}
<A>__{margaret goes to grab her pistol, when the redneck opens his mouth wide and gleeks; that is, he sends a yellowish globby stream shooting out of the back of his throat. the glob splashes on margaret's hand. margaret screams, drops the pistol.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{it burns!!}
<A>__{margaret looks at her hand as the gleek liquid sinks into her skin. the hand is swelling monstrously. it's soft. parts of it are nearly dripping off the bone.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{what'd you do to my fuckin' hand?!}
<A>__{jack opens his mouth and gleeks too shooting the stream glob forward and onto her neck. margaret screams again, grabbing onto her neck. margaret tries to speak, but she struggles just to breathe, as her neck puffs up, impeding her thorax.}
<C>__{older cop}
<D>__{meat.}
<A>__{the older cop buries his fingers into her neck. the puffy flesh comes off easily; it's soft, almost creamy. he stuffs the flesh into his mouth, eating it. as margaret topples over, dying, the other posse members turn to look at a very freaked out trevor. the redneck opens his mouth at him, when }
<C>__{starla }
<D>__{let him go!}
<A>__{the posse turn and see starla, who has made her way over to where the rifle was on the ground, and is now pointing the rifle at the posse, trembling.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{trevor, come on.}
<A>__{surprised, they release trevor.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{what'd you do to her?!}
<A>__{jack stares at starla. he too speaks with grant's cadence.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{there you go, sugarplum! why you choosing camps 'fore you hear }
<C>__{jack redneck}
<A>__{both sides of the story!? both sides of the story!?}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{why are you talking like grant?!}
<A>__{the posse moves toward her. starla is crying. the posse makes a collective screeching sound, then speaks again:}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{'cause i am grant!}
<C>__{wally redneck}
<A>__{i'm you husband i'm you husband, goddammit }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you swore to honor and obey }
<C>__{older cop redneck}
<A>__{obey me obey me, so put that goddamn}
<D>__{gun down.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{don't come any closer. i will... shoot.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{you ain't gonna shoot me! you always needed me to protect you! you for damn sure ain't got the balls to }
<A>__{starla blasts wally, blowing open a big crater into his face. wally falls to his knees. starla and trevor look on in shock, as they see... a slithering parasite squirming out of the crater on his face out of the wally's brain. the little thing squirms down wally's body and slithers off quickly into the woods. wally falls over, dead. the sick posse look at starla, surprised, infuriated. and then they leap at her. starla tries to shoot them. but she's out of ammo. she and trevor turn and dash away as quickly as their legs can take them.}
