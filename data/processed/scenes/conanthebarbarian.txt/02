<L>__{exterior cimmeria muddy field day}
<A>__{a blonde haired, armored aesir raider withdraws the bloody sword from the stomach of islene, a wild maned cimmerian beauty, many months pregnant, now clutching her bloody stomach. across a muddy battlefield, the air a maelstrom of falling snowflakes and embers from trees aflame, the powerfully built corin rallies his fellow cimmerians, until he spots islene.}
<C>__{corin}
<D>__{islene!!!}
<A>__{wielding a broadsword, runes etched into its surface, corin cuts a bloody path through his enemies, his eyes never leaving islene. the aesir standing over islene laughs as she claws at the earth behind her, trying to pull herself away.}
<C>__{aesir}
<D>__{now, now little whore. did i get you or your little one?}
<A>__{islene's hand reaches back once again and it finds a fallen warrior's sword. in one fluid motion she swings the sword around her body and drives it into the gap in the aesir's armor at his groin.}
<C>__{islene}
<D>__{i'd ask you the same.}
<A>__{the aesir howls in agony, raising his sword to deliver the killing blow when another sword pierces his chest. the aesir falls, revealing corin standing behind him. corin throws aside his horned helmet, and falls to his knees beside islene, checking her wound. when he pulls his hands back they are coated in blood. their eyes meet. torment. loss. they both know. she pulls a knife from the folds of her pelts, puts it in his hand.}
<C>__{islene }
<D>__{take your child.}
<C>__{corin}
<D>__{i cannot.}
<A>__{islene looks to her naked belly. the baby inside presses against its womb, a visible impression on her flesh.}
<C>__{islene}
<D>__{there is no time, husband. i would see my child's face.}
<A>__{islene's eyes flutter as she struggles. corin lowers the knife. islene's eyes lock with corin's as he puts the knife to use. never once does she scream. a moment later, corin lifts the crying, blood covered boy up through the falling snowflakes to islene's lap.}
<C>__{islene }
<D>__{a boy. he will be strong. a warrior with no equal.}
<C>__{corin}
<D>__{do not speak, love.}
<C>__{islene}
<D>__{you have never been able to still my tongue, and you will not this day. he will be wild, corin. you must temper him.}
<A>__{she shares one kiss with her child, its first taste not of mother's milk, but of her blood.}
<C>__{islene }
<P>__{(fading)}
<D>__{conan. his name is conan.}
<B>__{conan}
<A>__{the boy's eyes are as deep and blue as the eastern sea. title card: conan}
