<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior walter's office later night}
<A>__{walter and brandon alone in the room. sound of the announcers as atlanta get trounced by denver. not even close. well over}
<L>__{42 total points scored. the game ends. all four bets lost.}
<A>__{a commercial comes on. horrible stillness.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{...i'm finished. i'm done.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{that's great.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{i can't do this anymore, walter. i can't sleep at night. i can't eat.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{you're not gonna sit there and tell me you're ending this because you have a little indigestion or some insomnia.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{it's a lot more than that.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{i made it very clear before we started what the stakes were.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{walter, it's over. what use could john anthony be to you now? only an idiot would follow him after the streak i've been on.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{wrong! hot streaks go cold, cold streaks go hot. bettors will climb back aboard.}
<C>__{walter con'd}
<A>__{they know you! and when your luck turns they'll remember you went 80 percent for half the season! we'll make it all back on the last game and by next year they'll forget everything.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{who said anything about next year?}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{sports betting's year round.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{i'm not doing this next year.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{you made a career choice! i bankrolled it!}
<C>__{toni vo}
<A>__{let him go, walter. walter and brandon turn, see toni at the door.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{of course you stick up for him!}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{meaning what?}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{who's side are you on?}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{i didn't realize i had to choose.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{(to brandon) look, you got a magnificent gift. own that. so you strike out sometimes, big deal, you're swinging for the fences. you're a champion, brandon. a champion goes down 186 times but gets up 187. i'm not letting you stay down. this isn't about you or me or toni, this transcends that this is metaphysical, this is cosmic, this is eternal this is god... besides, we have a contract.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{bullshit!}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{you can't own someone, walter.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{i created the hottest sports tout this country's ever seen! i plugged him, took out full page ads, built a show around him, hooked him up with every major client i have and i will be goddamned if he's going to walk out the door and take all that with him! why the hell am i even explaining this to you! this is between me and him! get out!}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{don't talk to her like that.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{i need you to tell me how to talk to my wife? when i'm talking you'll shut your fucking toilet!}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{(to brandon) leave.}
