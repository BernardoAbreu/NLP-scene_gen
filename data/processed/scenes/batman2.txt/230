<A>__{the plexiglass case finally shatters and the penguin falls through, landing atop gotham city. he snatches at the strongbox and gets to his feet, bestriding the city like a colossus. he's climbing down off the tabletop when the catwoman, on her rope, touches down behind him. he hunkers down on the floor and knocks the rusted padlock off the box. he opens it and stares greedily at the contents a map and a bunch of old, crumbling photos. the catwoman creeps over to his side:}
