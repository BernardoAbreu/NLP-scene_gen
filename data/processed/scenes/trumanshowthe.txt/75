<L>__{exterior streetside cafe, little italy. day.}
<A>__{truman sits alone at the table, still looking for a false move. a delivery man unloads boxes from the back of his truck and carries them into a restaurant supply store. further down the street construction workers take their time tending to an electrical repair in an exposed manhole. a postal worker does his rounds. an old woman struggles with two heavy shopping bags. everybody appears natural, places to go. truman turns his attention to a group of italian looking men at the only other occupied table at the cafe. we see extreme close ups as truman scans the men's faces for any sign of phoniness. they are talking loudly, making suggestive comments to the waitress and generally showing off like schoolboys. their behavior passes the test, all seems genuine. truman idly regards his three stone wedding ring with which he has been fidgeting.}
