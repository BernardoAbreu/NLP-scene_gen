<L>__{interior medical research vault moments later}
<A>__{the lights slowly turn on, illuminated the vault. okun leads the group to a sealed partition.}
<C>__{okun}
<D>__{this is vault, or as some of us have come to call it, the "freak show."}
<A>__{okun hits a switch and the sealed partition lifts revealing... formaldehyde tanks aliens three dead aliens float in the milky formaldehyde tanks. the murky fluid and condensation obstructs our view. what we do see is not pretty.}
<C>__{okun}
<D>__{when we found them they were wearing bio mechanical suits. once we got them off, we were able to learn a great deal about their anatomy; eyes, ears, bipolar digestive system... no vocal cords though. we're assuming they communicate with each other through other means.}
<A>__{david cannot contain his fascination. he steps forward.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what kind of other means? hand signals, body language?}
<C>__{okun}
<D>__{some kind of extra sensory perception. telepathy.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{can they be killed?}
<C>__{okun}
<D>__{these three died in the crash. their bodies are as frail as our own. you just have to get past their technology, which is, i'm sorry to say, far more advanced.}
<A>__{the president turns to david.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{you unlocked a part of that technology. you cracked their code.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{all i did was stumble onto their signal. i don't know how helpful i can be...}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{show them what you've discovered. work together. we've got to find a way to beat them.}
