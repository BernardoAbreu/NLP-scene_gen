<A>__{builds ground speed. gordon is nervous at the wheel. west gives him an encouraging pat.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{avant...! avant!!!}
<A>__{but their speed is not enough to get them airborne.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{we're not getting enough lift! we need more speed!}
<A>__{then in an uncharacteristic move by gordon, he turns the machine around and heads for the cliff.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{hey, uh... that's the cliff over there, you know?}
<A>__{he guns the accelerator.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{yes, i do know.}
<A>__{and with that, the nitro cycle goes off the cliff! it disappears for the count of five. then suddenly it swoops up and past camera. they're flying!}
