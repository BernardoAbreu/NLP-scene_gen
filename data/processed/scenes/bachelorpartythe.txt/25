<L>__{exterior. greenwich avenue and tenth street night}
<A>__{group shot of our five carousers paused on the curb, waiting for the lights to change in their favor. greenwich avenue traffic is pretty heavy, going in both directions. the five men are kind of strung out along the curb with charlie being the last in line. standing beside him, also waiting for the light to change, is a good looking, well dressed, chic young woman of twenty four or five.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{where we going? eddie's place to see movies?}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{what movies?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{boy, just wait till you see these movies! hey, charlie, hey charlie ...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(indicating the young woman)}
<D>__{who's your beautiful friend, charlie?}
<A>__{charlie turns and regards the pretty young woman.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(to the girl)}
<D>__{excuse me. my friend down there wants to know who you are.}
<A>__{the young woman, who for our own mysterious purposes we shall refer to as the existentialist, regards the five reasonably tight young men all staring at her. kenneth has already begun to giggle.}
<C>__{the existentialist}
<P>__{(with a mona lisa smile)}
<D>__{where are you all from, out of town?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{indiana.}
<P>__{(turning to the others)}
<D>__{isn't that right, fellers? we're from indiana, right?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{indiana! indiana, man!}
<A>__{kenneth and arnold, to whom this incident is already unbearably funny, have turned away and are clutching their sides, trying to suppress a fit of giggles.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(to the existentialist)}
<D>__{we're from the hoosier state, ma'am...}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{terre haute! we're from terre haute!}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(to the existentialist)}
<D>__{we're from terre haute, and we've come to the big city looking for a good time, and we just don't know what to do with ourselves, ma'am.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(to walter)}
<D>__{look at that charlie operate.}
<C>__{the existentialist}
<D>__{must be a convention in town.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{we've just come off the ranch there, honey, and we're just raring. is that right, men? are we raring?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{we're raring, boy, we're raring!}
<C>__{kenneth}
<P>__{(beside himself with laughter)}
<D>__{hey, charlie, cut it out, will you?}
<A>__{the lights change and the existentialist starts off across greenwich avenue to the west side of the street. the five carousers follow right along after her. that is, charlie dogs along behind the existentialist as they cross the street. walter and eddie are close behind him, listening to charlie's pitch. kenneth and arnold, embarrassed and giggling, stagger along behind.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(chugging along behind the existentialist)}
<D>__{we're down here in greenwich village looking for some wild bohemians. do you happen to know any wild bohemians?}
<C>__{the existentialist}
<D>__{all right, fellows, enough's enough, huh?}
<A>__{she steps up to the sidewalk on the west side of greenwich avenue and hurries along down tenth street to a little house about four doors down, the five carousers on her heels like a pack of puppies.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(hurrying along after the existentialist)}
<D>__{i'm something of a poet myself, ma'am. many's the long night in the bunkhouse where i sat by myself and wrote by the flickering light of a kerosene lamp. could i read you some of my poems, ma'am? i know they ain't much, but they're from the heart, ma'am.}
<A>__{the existentialist pauses in her hurried walk down tenth street to examine charlie with some interest.}
<C>__{the existentialist}
<D>__{you have a sense of humor, don't you?}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(to charlie)}
<D>__{you're going great, man, don't stop now.}
<A>__{the existentialist goes up the two little steps to the front door of the house and rings the bell.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(to the existentialist)}
<D>__{where are you going, honey?}
<A>__{the existentialist waits composed and patient for someone to answer her ring. charlie has wandered back to arnold and kenneth, and the three of them are now suffused with laughter. kenneth has been laughing so much, tears are coming out of his eyes. he walks around in little circles clutching his sides. several passersby hurry by, noting the strange little group on the sidewalk.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(to the existentialist)}
<D>__{what's going on in there, honey?}
<C>__{the existentialist}
<P>__{(patiently bored)}
<D>__{there's a party going on. i'm not sure i'm invited myself, so i can't really invite you.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{sure you can.}
<A>__{the door opens and a woman in a tea gown stands there looking at the existentialist and then at the five men on the sidewalk. behind her, there is evidence of a party going on.}
<C>__{the hostess}
<D>__{how nice to see you, darling. who are your friends?}
<C>__{the existentialist}
<D>__{i haven't the vaguest idea. i was ambushed crossing greenwich avenue by a tribe of the terre haute kiwanis.}
<C>__{the hostess}
<P>__{(she waves a vague}
<D>__{hand in a sort of shooing motion at the five men on}
<P>__{the sidewalk)}
<D>__{go away, you men. go back to the biltmore hotel and put on your red caps.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i always thought you city people were more hospitable to us poor farm boys.}
<A>__{the other four carousers are laughing too much to even talk. charlie has ambled up to the existentialist, who is peering over her hostess into the room behind her.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(to the existentialist, smiling amiably)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, miss. a friend of ours is getting married here, and we're just horsing around.}
<A>__{the existentialist looks into the young man's smiling, rather winning face.}
<C>__{the existentialist}
<D>__{why don't you come back after you get rid of your friends.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{he'll be back!}
<A>__{she turns abruptly and disappears past the hostess into the room.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(to charlie)}
<D>__{man, she likes you, man!}
<C>__{the hostess}
<D>__{now, you boys go away.}
<A>__{she backs into her house and closes the door. eddie starts up the steps to the door. the other four just roar with laughter, clutch their sides, and giggle and snort.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{well, what do you say, men, are we going to this party, or aren't we?}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{come on, eddie. i thought you had some movies you want to show us.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{what do you want to see movies for? you got the real thing right here.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{eddie, we're married men here.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{come on, let's crash this party. i've been to these greenwich village parties. man, they're wild.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{come on, eddie, let's go up to your place, see these movies.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(coming reluctantly}
<D>__{back to the others,}
<P>__{says to charlie)}
<D>__{man, you were going strong with that girl. you could have scored. she's just waiting for you. go in after her.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{come on, eddie. let's go see the movies.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{all right, i live about three blocks down. you guys want to see movies, all right, let's go see movies.}
