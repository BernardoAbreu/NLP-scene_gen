<A>__{a pair of airline representatives sit with the seven survivors, each numb with shock. everyone is too raw with residual fear to show any emotion. they sit on folding metal chairs in an empty room, too bright from the fluorescent lights. beneath their obvious trauma resulting from the catastrophe... each feels uneasy by alex's presance. the others sit away from alex and tod. alex appears wrought with guilt. he checks the others out of the corner of his eye. alex's pov the room ms. lewton, carter and billy glare at alex. terry averts her eyes from alex to bury her face in carter's shoulder.}
<B>__{alex}
<A>__{frightened as anyone over what has happened, tenses, defensive and scared. with softspoken strength...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you're lookin' at me as if i caused it. i did not cause this.}
<A>__{lewton, carter, terry, and billy maintain their uncertain expressions. with strained apprehansion, as if not wanting to "dabble in the occult," but needing an immediate answer.}
<C>__{ms. lewton}
<D>__{is everyone dead? are there any survivors?}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{alex is taken aback by the question, yet even his best friend looks at him for an answer.}

<D>__{he's not a witch.}
<A>__{camera pushes in on alex, relieved and thankful, as he turns to her... clear rivers alex's pov camera matches the move into her as she looks up at alex, not with fear or repulsion... but with knowledge of an unwanted but irrefutable connection.}

<A>__{causing a startle, the door opens. everyone's head whips reflexively toward the entrance. the strange event of the flickering lights is quickly forgotten. a half dozen men and women enter the room, displaying official badges and passes. all but two are dressed in casual clothing, having been called in from home; the pair being f.b.i. special agents weine and schreck. howard seigel and don hawks are representatives of the national transportation safety board. eileen whale and jack arnold are members of the euro air "trauma team." the officials are sympathetic and calm, exuding the confidence and security trauma victims look for at this time.}
<C>__{seigel}
<D>__{hello. i'm howard seigel, national transportation safety board vice chairmen. we've notified your families and they are on their way. does anyone feel they need medical attention or spiritual counseling at this time?}
<A>__{although the words are comforting, being in the position of having to hear them macabre. ms. lewton reacts, snapping...}
<C>__{ms. lewton}
<D>__{have they found any survivors? what's going on?}
<A>__{seigel is calm, yet honest... carefully honest.}
<C>__{seigel}
<D>__{the cause of the explosion is undetermined. nassau county authorities are on the scene. naval search and rescue are en route.}
<A>__{he gestures... "and that's all we know." the group slips deeper into despair.}
<C>__{weine}
<D>__{we understand how you must be feeling at this hour... and although we know it may be difficult, we must ask you some questions... regarding today's events, while it's still fresh in your minds.}
<A>__{the survivors dread the thought of recounting the horrible experience, yet collectively are ready to co operate.}
<C>__{weine}
<D>__{it may be valuable to our rescue attempts, or any potential... criminal investigation.}
<A>__{the agents, f.b.i. badges displayed in their pockets, turn their eyes, suspicioulsy, toward alex.}
<B>__{alex}
<A>__{reacts, puzzled, as he realizes the agents are focused on him...}
