<A>__{...onto the desk. he boots one of the zombies away and tries to leap over the others. one of them catches his foot in mid air. chris isn't hurt, but he topples to the floor, sprawling, losing his winchester. the zombies have him cornered. he crawls toward his rifle. reaches it. pumps a shell into the firing chamber. aims at the closest of the walking dead... ...which was once a young man, a simple laborer, wearing overalls, with a name tag...}

<A>__{chris has come late to the realization that these things were once human. now he comes late to the realization... that they are human no longer. the zombie grabs the barrel of the winchester, pushing it aside. chris can't bring it back to bear on the monster's head. he blasts a round through the thing's belly. it has no effect. the zombie reaches for chris' throat. starts to lean in to bite him. blam! the thing's skull explodes. jill has jumped down onto the desk. she fires another accurate pistol round. the second zombie falls. jill leaps to the floor and starts to push the desk. chris gets to his feet, rushing in to help her. together, they shove the desk out from under the open ceiling grate.}

<D>__{any time. how do we get back up?}

<D>__{shit, if you didn't have a plan, you shouldn't have jumped down here.}

<C>__{chris}
<D>__{how big is this place? how many people were down here? how...}

<D>__{how do we get up?}
<A>__{with a startling sound, a dark shape swing down from above and grabs jill! is it the thing we saw on the video? no. it's barry! his mighty arms lift jill. she's caught by aiken and sullivan and pulled up to safety. barry grabs chris and lifts him as well.}
