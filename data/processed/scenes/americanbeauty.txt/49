<L>__{interior hotel ballroom night}
<A>__{we hear music under a room full of people all talking at once, as lester and carolyn enter a hotel ballroom. we follow them as they pass a sign that reads:}
<B>__{greater rockwell realtor resources group}
<C>__{carolyn}
<D>__{ everyone here is with their spouse or their significant other. how would it look if i showed up with no one?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{well, you always end up ignoring me and going off }
<A>__{inside the ballroom, well dressed real estate professionals stand in clumps, chatting. catering waiters serve hors d'eouvres.}
<C>__{carolyn}
<D>__{now listen to me. this is an important business function. as you know, my business is selling an image. and part of my job is to live that image }
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{just say whatever you want to say and spare me the propaganda.}
<C>__{carolyn}
<P>__{(spots someone)}

<P>__{(to lester)}
<D>__{listen, just do me a favor. act happy tonight?}
<C>__{lester}
<P>__{(grins stupidly)}
<D>__{i am happy, honey.}
<A>__{carolyn's jaw tightens, then:}
<C>__{carolyn}
<P>__{(spots someone)}

<C>__{carolyn}
<P>__{(forced gaiety)}
<D>__{honey. don't be weird.}
<A>__{she smiles her most winning smile at him. he knows this persona well, only it's never pissed him off as much as it does right now.}

<D>__{all right, honey. i won't be weird.}
<P>__{(his face close to hers)}
<D>__{i will be whatever you want me to be.}
<A>__{and he kisses her a soft, warm kiss that speaks unmistakably of sex then turns to the others and grins.}
<C>__{lester }
<D>__{we have a very healthy relationship.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{i see.}
<A>__{carolyn's smile is frozen on her face.}
<C>__{lester}
