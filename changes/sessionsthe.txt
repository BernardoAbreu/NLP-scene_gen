<ACTION>__{A busy intersection near the UC Berkeley campus. A strange, self-propelled motorized gurney whirrs into view and makes its way over a pedestrian crosswalk. The passenger, MARK O'BRIEN, in his early 30s, is visible only from the neck up. The rest of him is covered by a blanket. He operates the gurney with a mouth control and a set of mirrors positioned around his head.}

<ACTION>__{THE SCENE CHANGES to the interior of a large auditorium. A graduation ceremony is in progress.  Suddenly, everyone in the hall, GRADUATES, their FAMILIES, ACADEMICS and OTHERS, rise to their feet as Mark, in his gurney, buzzes across the stage, a mortar board hung on one of the handles.}

<DIAL>__{And so, Mark O'Brien graduates from Cal, one of 250 English majors to receive degrees today.}

<LOC>__{EXT.   STREET OUTSIDE MARK'S.    NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{It is about 4.00 a.m. All is quiet. We follow a mean-looking alley cat to the front of a modest, ground-floor apartment. It pauses, then slinks round the side, onto a ledge and in through a partially-opened window.}
<LOC>__{INT.    MARK'S PLACE.    NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The cat comes through the window, hops onto the floor and quickly finds a nice little plate of food scraps that has been set out specially. As it settles down to its meal, we become aware of a heavy and regular sound, like a ship's pump, coming from somewhere close-by. In the center of the room is an object that looks like a prop from a `50s sci-fi movie. A human head protrudes from one end. The object is an iron lung, and its purpose is to keep its occupant, Mark O'Brien, breathing. Every 4.5 seconds, the pump mechanism creates a vacuum inside, forcing Mark's chest to expand and suck in air. He is fast asleep.}
<CHAR>__{MARK } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{Breathing Look you This most excellent canopy, the air, Presses down upon me At 15 pounds per square inch A dense, heavy, blue-glowing ocean. Teasing me with its nearness and immensity. And all I get is a thin stream of it. A finger's width of the rope that ties me to life.}
<ACTION>__{Having now eaten its fill, the cat has a good scratch, then wanders over to the iron lung. It hops up onto the small platform that supports Mark's head and slides itself along his face, once this way, once the other way, then jumps on top of the iron lung and walks its length. Through the portholes, we just make out the shape of Mark's bent, undersize body.  Suddenly, Mark's nose twitches. He opens his eyes and grimaces.}
<CHAR>__{MARK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Shit!}
<ACTION>__{His face continues to contort as he tries to cope with the terrible itching.  He shakes his head violently, then stops suddenly and closes his eyes. We hear his thoughts.}
<DIAL>__{MARK (V.O.) (CONT'D) Okay, just focus. Now, scratch with your mind, okay, your mind, scratch with your mind...}
<ACTION>__{After a couple more nose twitches, he settles down. It seems to have worked. In his peripheral vision, Mark can see the cat making itself comfortable in a corner chair, one of the only other pieces of furniture in the room. The first hints of dawn start to appear through the curtains. They illuminate a large framed portrait of the Virgin Mary hanging on the wall.   Mark acknowledges it.}

<ACTION_ALT>__{A LITTLE LATER}
<ACTION>__{The center of the iron lung, basically a thin mattress, has been slid out, and Joan is in the process of giving Mark a bed bath. He is frail and helpless. There is a look of resentment in his eyes as this apparently unfeeling woman exercises total control over him, at least temporarily.}
<CHAR>__{MARK } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{Joan I swear this was one crazy bitch Who'd swing me about enough to scare me, But careful enough so she could say: "Now what was all the yelling about? You polios are screamers. Always were." I didn't say a word, but typed my skinny novel in my head, And thought about revenge.}
<ACTION>__{In the course of washing his private parts, Mark has an involuntary erection. Joan gives him a shriveling look. He feels belittled and humiliated.}

There are no mirrors and no motor, just an oxygen tank, a tube and a mouthpiece just next to Mark's mouth. Most of him is covered with a colorful blanket. The whole thing is a sports-coupe version of his iron lung.}

So Mary's fear and apprehension slowly gave way to pride and purpose. Elizabeth saw the greatness in Mary. "Blessed art thou among women". Elizabeth, pregnant herself with St. John, felt the power of this wondrous woman. It was Elizabeth, and her absolute faith, that gave Mary the courage she was lacking, and she gave thanks saying: "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour". May the spirit of the Lord be amongst you and remain with you always.}

<CHAR>__{MARK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
