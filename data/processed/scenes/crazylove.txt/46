<L>__{interior letty's room night}
<A>__{letty, unable to sleep, tosses and turns. she gets out of bed and paces the room nervously, trying to hold herself together. she slumps to the floor and starts to cry.}
<L>__{interior group therapy room hillview psychiatric hospital day}
<B>__{d}
<A>__{r. emlee and seven patients sit in a circle of metal folding chairs. michael, who sits next to emlee, practices rolling a quarter back and forth across his fingers. letty sits across from michael and emlee, her legs and arms crossed tightly. the group concentrates on mrs. hallstrom.}
<C>__{mrs. hallstrom}
<D>__{i can't stop thinking about the things i did wrong when my daughter was little.}
<C>__{dr. emlee}
<D>__{and how's that make you feel?}
<C>__{mrs. hallstrom}
<D>__{i just feel like sleeping. all the time.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{hell's bells, you can count me in on that. i haven't had enough z's since i ran those sleep disorder experiments at stanford back in the 70s.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{we really miss doing things with you, mrs. hallstrom.}
<A>__{michael, sitting next to mrs. hallstrom, squeezes her arm.}
<C>__{mrs. hallstrom}
<D>__{maybe when i hit my manic phase again.}
<A>__{group members smile.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i've noticed letty doesn't much like to do things with us.}
<A>__{the group looks expectantly at letty.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{oh, no. of course i do.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{then why are you so defensive?}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(to john)}
<D>__{i don't think we need to sacrifice letty to pep up a slow session.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(to michael)}
<D>__{you're the one who told everyone about her panties.}
<A>__{michael grimaces at john. letty's head is bent down.}
<C>__{dr. emlee}
<D>__{maybe you'd like to share some of your feelings about ocd or depression with us, letty.}
<A>__{letty eyes the doctor. she's dangerously close to tears.}
<C>__{letty}
<D>__{do we have to talk about this?}
<C>__{dr. emlee}
<D>__{i think in the spirit of group therapy, it's beneficial for each of us to open ourselves up to the others.}
<A>__{michael reaches his hand behind dr. emlee's head, catching letty's eye in the process. michael pulls a silver dollar out of emlee's ear. letty looks but doesn't respond. the other patients ignore michael. emlee is oblivious.}
<C>__{dr. emlee}
<D>__{you never know, letty, how the person sitting next to you may be able to shed light on one of your problems...}
<A>__{michael goes for a bigger trick. reaching again behind the doctor's head, he produces a small bouquet of paper flowers. letty, almost against her will, smiles.}
<C>__{dr. emlee}
<D>__{...by revealing something that's going on in his or her own life.}
<A>__{michael waves the flowers back and forth behind the doctor's head. letty's smile broadens.}
<C>__{dr. emlee}
<P>__{(responding to her smile)}
<D>__{there, now, i knew you'd feel better once we discussed group process. let's talk a little about your ocd.}
