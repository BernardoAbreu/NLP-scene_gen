<L>__{interior john and ann millaney's house day}
<A>__{ann, dressed in some of john's work clothes (old cotton shirt, khaki pants) is cleaning the house. not cleaning like a normal person, but like an obsessive compulsive person. scrubbing spots that are already clean, vacuuming the same area of rug over and over, etc. suddenly, an object lodges itself in the snout of the vacuum cleaner, making a loud noise. shutting the machine off, ann turns it over and sees that cynthia's diamond stud earring has gotten hooked in the take up roller. ann stares at cynthia's earring for a long moment.}
