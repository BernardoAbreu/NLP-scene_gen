<A>__{leonard is at the kitchen sink, arranging a fruit salad. suddenly, he hears the sound of water boiling over from the stove. leonard quickly turns the gas low, extinguishing the flame. he removes the pot from the burner, grabs a strainer and removes poached egg whites from the water. leonard grabs a dish towel and begins wiping the water off the stove. preoccupied, he doesn't realize that when he wipes the oven knob dry, he turns the gas on high. (since the overflowing water, extinguished the pilot light, he is unaware that gas is now being emitted from the burner.) in his condition, he won't be able to smell it. leonard grabs the plates of food and exits the kitchen. sfx: gas leaking}
