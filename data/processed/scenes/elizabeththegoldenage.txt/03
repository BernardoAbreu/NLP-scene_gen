<L>__{interior hallway salon, escorial palace day}
<A>__{philip walks rapidly down a long corridor that opens out into a broader hallway, moving from the darkness of the chapel into ever brighter light and more visible glory. on his face the far shining gaze of a man who now knows his mission. silent servants press themselves to the walls as he goes by. through the hallway to a grand salon. courtiers fall silent and bow as he passes. so into the grandest salon of all, where his magnificent court is gathered; among them his 12 year old daughter, the infanta. as he enters, all kneel. his eyes scan his ministers and courtiers, all kneeling, heads bowed before him. his gaze falls on one who wears the plain black robes of a jesuit priest: robert reston, the face we glimpsed in the opening montage. he speaks to all.}
