<L>__{interior cedars sinai, radiation room day}
<A>__{andy lies under the machine. it bombards his body with powerful radiation.}
<L>__{interior cedars sinai, doctor's office day}
<A>__{the whole kaufman family is gathered. stanley, janice, michael and carol listen to a bland doctor in a white coat.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{the cancer started in andy's left arm and spread to his lungs. we've initiated an aggressive radiation program... see if we can eradicate the affected cells.}
<P>__{(his beeper goes off)}
<D>__{excuse me. i will be right back.}
<A>__{the doctor leaves. a somber silence and then janice bursts into tears. stanley hugs her tightly. carol watches the doctor with great hostility. his old tennis shoes are grabbing her attention. he leaves, and she frowns.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{what a crock.}
<C>__{stanley}
<P>__{(angered)}
<D>__{how dare you make light of this!}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{dad, i cried when he broke his neck. he's not gettin' me again }
<C>__{stanley}
<P>__{(impassioned)}
<D>__{jesus! he's got lung cancer!}
<A>__{a standoff moment. carol loses it.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{see, that's exactly it! he picked lung cancer, because he doesn't smoke. that makes it weird! if he'd picked leukemia, it'd be totally believable, and we'd all be going, "poor andy, he's really sick." so he chose lung cancer, because he wants us to be scratching our heads, saying, "is this real?"}
<C>__{janice}
<P>__{(trying to convince herself)}
<D>__{of course it's real. we're in a hospital...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{mom, it's cedars sinai! it's a showbiz hospital! andy's studio friends probably run this place!}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{he plans these things out. he takes over, hires actors...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{personally, i didn't think that "doctor" was very convincing.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{did you notice his costume had the wrong shoes?}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{yeah! he didn't have doctor shoes!}
<A>__{a moment of total silence. all four of them look at each other. is there... a glimmer of hope?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{we all know he's talked about faking his own death...}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{sure but what if he isn't?}
<P>__{(sad; poignant)}
<D>__{my son could be dying... and we're actin' like we're on candid camera.}
