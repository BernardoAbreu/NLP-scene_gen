<A>__{in a quiet street off camden town we see ben, alight and pay off a london taxi. the taxi does a u turn and disappears around a corner. ben starts to walk toward the camera. he glances at the piece of paper from, his pocket bearing ambrose chappell's address. he is completely alone in a deserted street so much so that his footsteps click on the pavement and create the feeling of an echo. as he walks he listens to the echo ind for a moment wonders if it is an echo. he slows up and comes to a stop close to the camera. there is complete silence only the faint distant london traffic noises.}
