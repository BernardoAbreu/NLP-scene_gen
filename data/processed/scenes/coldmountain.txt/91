<L>__{exterior another part of the cape fear. night}
<A>__{in the moonlight, the canoe drifts into the muddy bank and veasey drags a half drowned inman to land, both of them retching with the vile river water. an alligator eases into the river not ten feet from where they lie, lungs heaving. they get up. veasey to his feet, inman to his knees.}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{inman nods, coughs. and veasey aims a kick at inman's head, knocking him back into the mud.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{jesus, god!}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{i figure that righteous, given our history. otherwise i'd bear a grudge on our journey.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{there's nowhere i'm going with you except to hellfire!}
