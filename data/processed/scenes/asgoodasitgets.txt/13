<L>__{interior spencer's room night}
<A>__{the room is a monument to horrible, sleepless nights... two drugstore de humidifying filters, a nebulizer (breathing contraption) a waste basket... a night stand filled with medicine, a blood pressure kit... along with some stacks of seven year old toys and a small tv wedged into the tiny space.}
<C>__{spencer}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{don't be silly. how bad?}
<C>__{spencer}
<D>__{not bad.}
<A>__{carol feels his head... that's okay. then he coughs trying to suppress it... then a bigger cough... they each know what that signals... she brings up a waste basket as he throws up... she comforts him. he apologizes. she loves him.}
