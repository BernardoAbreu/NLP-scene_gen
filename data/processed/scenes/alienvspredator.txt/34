<L>__{interior tunnel 700 feet below the surface}
<A>__{suddenly the rope that weyland is on jerks tight and catches the side of the tunnel, smashing weyland into the ice. for a millisecond weyland thinks he's saved but then the rope snaps and he begins to hurtle down the steep shaft. max and sebastian desperately try and grab him but they both just miss.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{man down! lex watch out!}
<A>__{lex sees weyland coming, as we see just how fast her reflexes are. she pins weyland against the tunnel wall, holding him in place by driving an ice axe into the ice, preventing him from falling further down into the tunnel. a moment's hesitation from lex, and weyland might have died. lex reworks weyland's rope to secure him in place. the two are face to face.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{you okay?}
<P>__{(off his nod)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{you saved my life... remember?}
<A>__{she shakes her head not for this.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{for what you said.}
<A>__{weyland nods.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{what the hell is going on up there, quinn?}
