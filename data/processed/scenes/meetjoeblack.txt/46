<L>__{interior dining room, parrish townhouse night}
<A>__{everyone eating silently but looks are exchanged, glances averted, allison notices susan and joe looking at each other, drew observes parrish watching joe, quince, on the other hand, just eats. breaking the silence, parrish chinks his glass, stands.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{ i uh want to thank you all for coming uh my family }

<P>__{(a laugh)}
<D>__{yeah, speak for yourself.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{anyway i remember when you were little girls }
<A>__{an awkward pause. quince chooses to fill the silence.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{i love little girls }
<A>__{allison elbows him.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{and now you're all grown up and i'm uh um }
<A>__{parrish struggles to keep his emotions in check, drew clocking his behavior very carefully.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{i had some words all prepared but now i've forgotten them uh um wait a minute.}
<A>__{silence, everyone waiting for parrish to proceed.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{uh, it's gone...um it was on the tip of my tongue.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{it'll come back, daddy.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{will it?...}
<A>__{parrish looking around, searching for words he will not find.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{anyway, i'd like to go on but...}
<A>__{he hesitates, drifts into silence.}
<C>__{allison}
<P>__{(tentatively)}
<D>__{daddy, you could sit down if you wanted to.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{there is so much i would like to say but i can't }
<P>__{(another moment)}
<D>__{so i better sit down. carry on, everybody.}
<A>__{he sits, then immediately stands up again.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{one other thing why don't we all have dinner again tomorrow night?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{dinner? again?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{haven't you had enough of us, dad?}
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(with great sincerity)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{the word lands with effect, susan and allison have heard it well.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{we'll be here.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{you bet.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{with bells on.}
<A>__{the guests try to return to their food, susan is the most concerned about parrish's lapse, she does not say anything but drew next to her senses her empathy and, in something of a display, gives her a pro forma hug. joe has observed every instant of drew's performance, his anxiety is palpable when coyle leans over to serve him, offering a tray of a roast that has been carved.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(to coyle)}
<D>__{i would prefer some peanut butter.}
<C>__{coyle}
<D>__{how would you like that, sir? on some kind of toast?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{toast? no...just the butter.}
<C>__{coyle}
<D>__{right away.}
<A>__{coyle heads for the kitchen.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{why do you love peanut butter so much?}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(intimately)}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i adore things like that....food i can't do without. don't you?}
<A>__{joe is locked on susan, it is as if there is nobody else in the room.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yes...}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{it comforts you, doesn't it?}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(captivated)}
<D>__{yes...i've found that it does.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{mind if i throw up?}
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(admonishing gently)}
<D>__{please, drew.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(to susan)}
<D>__{i'm very concerned about the woman you attended to today.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i am, too.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{has her pain abated?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{we're doing what we can for her. but it doesn't look good.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i'm sorry to hear that.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{who are we talking about?}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(to susan)}
<D>__{but i know she's grateful for the care you're giving her.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{is this a state secret or are we being excluded just for the fun of it?}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(to drew)}
<D>__{susan's patient is whom we are talking about.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{joe visited the hospital today.}
<A>__{parrish's head swivels to joe.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{did he? that's more than we get to do.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{well, maybe next time joe goes, he'll take us along.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{perhaps you could remind me.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i will make a note of it. anything else?}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{i'd like to come, too. see susan strut her stuff.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{you're on, quin cee. destination hospital. joe, you'll be the tour guide. okay? how's that sound to you?}
<A>__{silence. parrish regards joe, then susan, his face reflects a sudden concern with their relationship.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{susan is a wonderful doctor.}
