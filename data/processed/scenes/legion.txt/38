<L>__{exterior paradise falls gas 'n' grub roof night}
<A>__{a hatch opens and out comes michael followed by bob, percy and kyle. they quickly take their places behind the "paradise" sign. pitch black surrounds them. the rumble of engines is gone, leaving only the rush of the wind coming up off the desert.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{where the hell did they go?}
<A>__{bob turns to michael sharply.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{alright, rambo. you got us up here. now you mind explaining what the fuck we're fighting?}
<A>__{michael is about to answer, when:}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{listen!}
<A>__{over the wind, another sound becomes audible. the delicate chime of a calliope.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{you hear what i'm hearing?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{yeah...the hell is that?}
<A>__{the calliope music grows louder, the melody more distinct. now we recognize the song: santa claus is coming to town. but instead of filling them with cheer, it fills them with dread.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{it sounds almost like...}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{ice cream.}
<A>__{two headlights appear in the darkness. and sure enough, an ice cream truck rolls slowly toward the diner. the eerie calliope music emanates from a speaker on its roof. it's too dark to see who's behind the wheel.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{you've got to be fuckin' kidding me.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{alright. there's a safety switch on the side of your gun. push it all the way down. two clicks.}
<A>__{the men quickly do as they're told.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{now when this starts, you hold on tight, you hear me? if you don't, you're going to blow your hand off. understand?}
<A>__{kyle, bob shoot quick anxious looks at percy.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{the fuck y'all lookin' at me for?}
