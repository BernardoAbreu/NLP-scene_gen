<A>__{and jacob finally looks away... in pity.}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{see jacob the hustle we all fall for is actually thinking we can fight what's inherent, what's inevitable... that we can somehow undo what genetics, or god, or whatever name you wanna tag it, has placed deep inside of us. because whether it's greed or revenge or the compulsion to chase... it all amounts to the same thing... loss of control. and it's always going to be there and it's always going to be stronger than you, pal.}
