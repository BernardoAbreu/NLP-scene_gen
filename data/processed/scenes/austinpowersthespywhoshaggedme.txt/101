<L>__{interior dr. evil's volcano lair main room}
<A>__{austin and felicity run into the main room. it is strangely dark and quiet.}
<C>__{felicity}
<D>__{where's your mojo, austin?}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{i'm not sure.}
<A>__{music: it's raining men by the weathergirls suddenly, the lights dim. the three he bots descend from the ceiling on trapezes and acrobatic rings, their muscles rippling.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{watch out, baby, he bots!}
<A>__{the he bots flip off their trapezes and land in unison, like a perfect olympic dismount. their crotch nozzles flip up one by one.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{i can't fight them without my mojo.}
<C>__{felicity}
<D>__{who said anything about fighting?}
<A>__{music: seductive music felicity does a very seductive dance, with hip thrusts and bumps and grinds. the he bots explode, succumbing to her mojo.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{smashing, felicity, you were making me very horny, man! extremely randy, indeed!}
<C>__{fat bastard }
<D>__{c'mon, give the lads a show. take of your top. put 'em on the glass! make 'em bounce. let's have a look at your tits.}
<A>__{austin and felicity turn to see fat bastard lurking in the background.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{fat bastard!}
<C>__{fat bastard}
<D>__{looking for this, mr. powers?}
<A>__{fat bastard, holds the beaker and is flanked by a dozen private army men.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{give me back my mojo, fat bastard!}
<C>__{fat bastard}
<D>__{i give the orders, (bleep) for brains. guards, take them back to their cells.}
<A>__{guards approach.}
<C>__{felicity}
<D>__{hold on, let me ask you one question.}
<C>__{fat bastard}
<D>__{alright, i guess i owe you that much for a night of carnal ecstasy.}
<A>__{austin is grossed out.}
<C>__{felicity}
<D>__{are you happy?}
<C>__{fat bastard}
<D>__{what kind of stupid ass question is that? i'm (bleep)in' rich and i'm up to my tits in clean stinky.}
<C>__{felicity}
<D>__{you didn't answer my question, are you happy?}
<C>__{fat bastard}
<D>__{it's about my girth isn't it? sure i could lose a few pounds, but i could shiva git!}
<C>__{felicity}
<D>__{are you happy?}
<C>__{fat bastard}
<D>__{of course i'm not happy. look at me, i'm a big fat slob. i've got bigger titties than you do! i've got more}
<P>__{(bleep)in' chins than a chinese phone}
<D>__{book. i've got more crack cheese than a (bleep)in' dairy. i've nay seen ma willie in two years. that's enough time to declare it legally deed! i can't stop eating. i eat because i'm unhappy and i'm unhappy because i eat.}
<P>__{(starts to cry)}
<D>__{i'm caught in a cycle and there's no escape!}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{maybe inside that fat bastard there's a thin bastard, trying to get out}
<C>__{fat bastard}
<D>__{maybe there's big crap inside me trying to get out, jack ass! enough of your (bleep)in' new age aphorisms. listen, i've run the gamut of self help books. "food isn't love", right, but how do you get it from the page to the (bleep)in' fork? i'm so weak, i hate myself. i'm for shite. here, take the mojo.}
<A>__{fat bastard hands over the mojo.}
<C>__{fat bastard}
<D>__{i appreciate you trying to reach me, no one can do it for me, i know this now. there's a hole in my soul that food won't fill. this is the beginning of a new me. i'm gonna go to the gym everyday. if you'll excuse me, there's someone i have to get in touch with and forgive... myself.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{sorry. i farted.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{it's a long road ahead.}
