<L>__{exterior porch early evening.}
<A>__{everyone is sitting on the porch after dinner. beloved, looking strong and fit, eats a cane stick gnawing at it to the flax, keeping the strings in her mouth long after the syrup had been sucked off. it makes denver laugh, as she licks her cane stick. it makes sethe smile, to see them both happy. it makes paul disgusted.}
<L>__{interior keeping room night.}
<A>__{paul confronts sethe as she sews.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you gonna just feed her, from now on?}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{denver likes her. she's no real trouble.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{but don't she have a home? some place to go?}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{didn't mention one. i thought we'd wait until her breathing got better. she still sounds a little lumbar.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{she breathe like she can eat, she could blow this whole house down. and all those sweets.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{sometimes the body needs that sugar for strength when it's trying to recover after an illness.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{but that's just it. she don't seem sick. something funny about her.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{funny? how?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{acts sick, sounds sick but she don't look sick. good skin, bright hands and strong as a bull.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{she can hardly walk without holding onto something.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{that's what i mean. can't walk but i passed by baby sugg's room this morning and saw her lifting the rocker with one hand.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{you didn't?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{don't tell me. ask denver. she was right there.}
<A>__{at that moment, denver passes by on her way to the kitchen.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{denver. come in here a minute.}
<A>__{denver enters the keeping room.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{paul says you saw beloved pick up the rocking chair in baby suggs room with one hand. that so?}
<A>__{denver looks at paul with a hard gaze;}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{i didn't see no such thing.}
<A>__{from paul's expression we can tell denver is lying...and whatever fragile connection they were building, is swiftly destroyed.}
