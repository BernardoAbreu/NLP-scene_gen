<A>__{picard turns to see that they are being pursued! the aliens are racing after them in crude desert terrain vehicles }
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(to data)}
<D>__{shall we try some "unsafe velocities?"}
<A>__{he floors it racing across the desert landscape. worf fires the mounted phaser canon blasting away at the aliens, not killing them, just stopping them a few dramatic crashes as the alien vehicles overturn meanwhile:}

<C>__{picard}
<D>__{mister data. let's make like the wind.}
<A>__{data punches some buttons on a dashboard console and the argo lifts off by remote control data uses the console to swing the argo around and lower the rear cargo doors it hovers over the surface picard floors the jeep using a natural rise in the terrain as a ramp the jeep flies through the air over the aliens and into the cargo bay }
