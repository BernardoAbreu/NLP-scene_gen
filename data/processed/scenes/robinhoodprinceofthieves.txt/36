<L>__{interior nottingham cathedral day}
<A>__{jesus hangs from the cross. a magnificent stained glass window. in the ornate pulpit, the bishop of hereford, bedecked in ermine.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{we beseech thy blessing, lord, on all your people, but most especially on our noble lord nottingham. grant him the wisdom to guide and protect our glorious city.}
<A>__{nottingham and gisborne sit piously among the congrega tion of nobles and wealthy merchants.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{grant him also the strength to bring to justice the lawless men who threaten its safety. help him to stamp out the curse of the dread druids who would seize from us our children, even as wolves steal the lambs from their mothers.}
<A>__{the rear of the church. standing crushed together, the poor and afflicted. old and young. starving children. among them, robin. the sermon ends. as the nobles file out, the poor are galvanized. begging hands reach out.}
<C>__{various}
<A>__{alms! have mercy, milady. pity, fine sir. for my baby. etc. the rich drop a few mites, sparking a mad scramble. church officials roughly keep order. marian passes some coins to the mother of a small child. a hand grabs her wrist.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{alms for a blind man. for one who cannot see your beauty.}
<C>__{marian}
<P>__{(recognizing him)}
<D>__{this is dangerous.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{so you care for my safety?}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{no, for mine. i do not wish to be seen with an outlaw.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{under the sheriff's law, that's a badge of pride.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{he's put a price on your head.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{how much?}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{a hundred gold pieces.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{is that all? i have not annoyed him enough. soon he will offer ten thousand.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{for ten thousand i would turn you in myself.}
<P>__{(glances back at the sheriff)}
<D>__{nottingham is mounting an army.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{he has rounded up every blacksmith in the county. he has them holed up in the castle making swords and armor.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{what is he planning?}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{i don't know, but there's no limit to the man's ambitions.}
<P>__{(as sheriff heads towards them)}
<D>__{go!}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{if you need me, i will be with the woodsmen. send for me as 'robin hood.'}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{robin! do something for me.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{take a bath.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{care to join me?}
<A>__{with a grin, he slips into the crowd as nottingham arrives.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{you shine like the sun, my lady.}
<A>__{he raises her hand, as he did the girl's in the castle. kisses it.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{you have been meeting with young robin of locksley.}
<P>__{(as she tries to hide her shock)}
<D>__{my cousin tells me the knave deprived you of some horses.}
<C>__{marian}
<P>__{(recovering)}
<D>__{yes. a most disagreeable experience.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{i deeply regret it, and i promise you he will be brought to justice. for subjecting you to such treatment, i will hang him from the walls with his own entrails.}
<A>__{that gleam of insanity. robin watches from a distance.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{i would like to see that, my lord.}
<A>__{the sheriff places his hand possessively on her shoulder.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{my dear, a woman of your refinement is not safe living alone. if you would consent to bring your household within the city walls, i could give your needs my most personal attention.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{i thank you, lord nottingham, from the heart, but for now i prefer to stay in my family's ancestral home. my cousin, king richard, will be deeply moved to hear of your concern for my welfare.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{alas, the king has many enemies both abroad and at home. i fear for his safe return.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{fear not, my dear sheriff. he will return. when he does, he will wish to reward his faithful subjects.}
<A>__{the sheriff smiles sourly and takes his leave. marian deflates with relief. the sheriff walks alone towards a side door.}
<C>__{beggar}
<P>__{(robin)}
<D>__{alms, my lord.}
<A>__{nottingham makes to shove the man aside. with a swift move, the beggar grabs the sheriff in a headlock. slides nottingham's own dagger to his throat and drags him out of sight.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{a hundred crowns, sheriff? you insult me.}
<A>__{nottingham starts to struggle. robin draws blood.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{remember young robin of locksley, sheriff? meet robin hood. your nemesis. your avenging angel.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{if you kill me, you will hang.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{if i kill you, i will hang happy.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i want to give you a chance. a chance you do not deserve. a chance to right your wrongs.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{i'm listening.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{from this day forward you will cease to tax my people. you will renounce the charges against my father, and you will return his lands to me.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{why should i?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{because for every harm you do, i swear by god i shall visit on you threefold in return.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{empty words.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i am here with a blade at your throat. as long as i live, you will always know that i could be here again.}
<A>__{a yell from across the church. gisborne has spotted them. robin digs the knife a little deeper.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{your answer?}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{never, fool.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{then it will begin..}
<A>__{gisborne yells orders. robin hurls nottingham against the wall.}
