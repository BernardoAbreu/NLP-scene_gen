<L>__{interior talbot's chamber same time}
<A>__{a wood lined room walls covered with books, artifacts, paintings. jesse stands before talbot. he fixes his eyes on her, pours her some coffee.}
<C>__{talbot}
<D>__{how's everything? you alright? you sleeping okay?}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{yeah, i'm great. i just found a vampire.}
<C>__{talbot}
<P>__{(considers her)}
<D>__{jesse... you're taking this lestat stuff pretty seriously... why?}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{cause i think i'm on to something pretty big. the most important sighting talamasca's had in years...}
<P>__{(beat, sighs)}
<D>__{jesus, i don't know, david... i thought i was onto something... maybe i didn't see anything...}
<A>__{talbot takes in the dark circles around her eyes, how quickly she's emptied her coffee cup. he pours her more, smiles gently.}
<C>__{talbot}
<D>__{you know we work in a really strange field? the supernatural is beguiling at times. it doesn't like to just be observed, it is only satisfied when it has drawn us in completely. i know cause i've felt these things myself.}
<C>__{talbot }
<D>__{that's what we have to resist, as talamascans...}
<P>__{(as a shadow crosses his face)}
<D>__{it's not always easy.}
<C>__{jesse}
<P>__{(leaning forward)}
<D>__{talbot. c'mon. you know me. i'm not freaking out on you. i'm just onto what looks alright looked like a good lead. you're the one who taught me how to do all this. you're the one who taught me to keep pushing and pushing...}
<A>__{he still looks at her with a penetrating glance. she looks back at him.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{david. there's nothing else. nothing is 'beguiling' me, alright? nothing. c'mon.}
<A>__{he gazes at her as she downs her whole coffee, registering her strong denial. he smiles at her, forcefully changes the mood.}
<C>__{talbot}
<D>__{alright. just checking...}
<A>__{jesse starts out. looking down at papers on his desk, talbot calls out, almost casually...}
<C>__{talbot}
<D>__{well, all i can say is you're really lucky you're not lying dead in a gutter with two holes on your neck.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{i'd be even luckier if that damn picture came out...}
<P>__{(stops in her tracks,}
<D>__{turns back, gazes at}
<P>__{him, amazed)}
<D>__{wait a second. so you do believe me? you do think it's a vampire coven.}
<C>__{talbot}
<P>__{(looks up, eyes sparkling)}
<D>__{yes. but not exactly for the reasons you think. though your research is top notch of course...}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{come back here. i'm gonna show you something.}
<A>__{he goes to the paintings hanging on a wall in the back of his office, covered with black velvet. jesse follows. he unveils them. they stand before an eighteenth century painting. the interior of an enormous italian villa. there's a man in his forties with long white hair, back to us, but his face is reflected in a standing mirror.}
<C>__{talbot}
<D>__{what do you see?}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{they're all nightscapes. the detail is amazing. mid 1500s. florence.}
<C>__{talbot}
<D>__{right. and what do you see in this one?}
<A>__{jesse moves to the next painting. another nightscape, a giant medieval tableaux, circa bruegel.}
<C>__{talbot}
<D>__{and i know it's a dutch pastoral.}
<A>__{jesse runs her finger across the faces, then stops on the face of a gentleman with long white hair watching the bloodshed of gory battles and the sacrifices of saints burned at the stake.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{this man is in both.}
<C>__{talbot}
<D>__{right. he's in all of them.}
<A>__{jesse moves to the next painting, then the next and the next, all nightscapes set and painted in the style of different eras, all featuring a portrait of the same white maned man.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{have you }
<C>__{talbot}
<D>__{carbon tested? yes. the different paint samples are all authentic. all painted at the time of that particular style.}
<A>__{jesse stops at a contemporary self portrait.}
<C>__{talbot}
<D>__{it's marius, jesse.}
<C>__{jesse}
<P>__{(whirling around)}
<D>__{marius?! from lestat's lyrics. i knew i was right.}
<C>__{talbot}
<D>__{yes, you were. good work.}
<A>__{she smiles at him, victorious.}
<C>__{talbot}
<D>__{i've been personally tracing him for decades. my little obsession. the oldest vampire ever documented. the closest we've come to the original vampire.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{what do you mean the original vampire?}
<A>__{pointing to a larger depiction of a beautiful woman in egyptian garb }
<C>__{talbot}
<D>__{there's a mesopotamian legend that there once was a queen of egypt, akasha, long before tutankhamen or nefertiti. she was believed to be the original vampire... marius himself dates back to 400 b.c...}
<A>__{jesse gazes at all the paintings, shaking her head in wonder, then speaks softly.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{david, you've been tracking marius your whole life. maybe he's out there waiting for you right now.}
<P>__{(without looking at him)}
<D>__{don't you ever want to just go and find him and }
<A>__{talbot crosses to her.}
<C>__{talbot}
<D>__{no. jesus, we are not talking about having a drink at the dorchester, jesse. you know that. especially with the ancient vampires the older they are, the more powerful, the more dangerous...}
<A>__{he takes her by the arm, smiles down at her.}
<C>__{talbot}
<D>__{anyway, you don't need to go and stake out some club. your time is too valuable. i have something far better for you...}
<C>__{jesse}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{you do?}
<A>__{he steers her over to a locked cabinet.}
<C>__{talbot}
<D>__{yes. and i will tell you something. i've never shown this to anyone. no one else has proved themself in the way you have.}
<C>__{jesse}
<P>__{(touched)}
<D>__{thanks. what is it?}
<A>__{as he unlocks the cabinet...}
<C>__{talbot}
<D>__{oh you're gonna love this.}
<P>__{(glancing at her)}
<D>__{although i'm sure it will keep you up nights to come with nightmares...}
<A>__{he takes out an old leather bound journal. turns to jesse.}
<C>__{talbot}
<D>__{lestat's diary. i found it some years ago. this is where you'll find the answers you need.}
<A>__{jesse stares up at him in absolute awe, taking it in. talbot gestures in the direction of the talamascans in the library.}
<C>__{talbot}
<D>__{they don't need to know everything, right?}
<A>__{she smiles at him. he gives her the diary.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{thank you for this.}
<C>__{talbot}
<D>__{my pleasure. when i took you on as an apprentice, i knew it was the smartest thing i'd ever done. now you and i will meet when you're done... this will be our project...}
<A>__{as jesse goes out, holding the journal, talbot smiles after her. but after the door closes, his gaze turns again to concern. he crosses back to the paintings, pauses a moment, staring up into marius's eyes. then talbot covers each with the black velvet.}
