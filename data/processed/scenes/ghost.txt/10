<L>__{interior loft day}
<A>__{as the angel pulls away from camera, we see the newly decorated loft for the first time. it is painted now in lovely pastels. the floor, a huge gymnasium like expanse, is lacquered with polyurethane. furniture and boxes are piling up along the walls. dominating the space, with a kind of surreal presence, are a large number of molly's sculptures and ceramics. there is also a vintage jukebox. carl is impressed.}

<D>__{wow! the place looks great. really great.}
