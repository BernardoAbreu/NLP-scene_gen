<L>__{exterior gallows courtyard day}
<A>__{hundreds of filthy prisoners stare down onto the gallows as the hangman's noose is draped over o'connell's head and cinched tight around his neck. evelyn follows the warden onto a balcony above the gallows. the prisoners all go dead quiet at the sight of her; like jackals staring at fresh meat.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{no women allowed.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i am an english woman.}
<A>__{this seems to confuse the warden, he shrugs and sits down. o'connell looks up as evelyn plops down beside the warden.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i will give you one hundred pounds to spare his life.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{i would pay one hundred pounds just to see him hang.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{two hundred pounds.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{proceed!}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{three hundred pounds!}
<A>__{o'connell can hear every word, he looks hopeful. other than evelyn, you could hear a pin drop. the hangman turns to him.}
<C>__{hangman}
<D>__{any last requests, pig?}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{yeah, i'd like ya to let me go.}
<A>__{the hangman grabs the lever to the trapdoor.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{five hundred pounds!}
<A>__{the warden sets his greasy, lecherous hand on evelyn's leg.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{and what else?}
<A>__{evelyn is revolted, she quickly shoves his hand away. insulted, the warden angrily turns and gestures to the hangman, who pulls the lever. the trapdoor drops away.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{nooo!}
<A>__{o'connell drops through the hole. the rope pays out. then jerks taught. o'connell's body snaps at the end of the rope. but he's still alive, because }
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{his neck did not break! good! now we watch him strangle to death.}
<A>__{the prisoners go ape shit, screaming and shouting in anger. the guards look around, nervous. o'connell struggles at the end of the rope, gagging. evelyn is horrified, she quickly turns to the warden, leans forward and whispers in his ear.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{he knows the location to hamunaptra.}
<A>__{the warden spins around and faces her.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{you lie.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i would never!}
<A>__{at the end of the rope, o'connell is choking and gagging and turning several shades of red. the warden stares at evelyn.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find the city of the dead? truly?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{fifty percent.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{twenty.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{forty.}
<A>__{evelyn hesitates, bites her lip. o'connell's eyes bulge as he looks up at her, he can't believe this girl.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{give... give him... give him glaaaa !}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{twenty five percent, and not one single farthing more.}
<A>__{the warden flashes a big green smile, then yells in arabic. a scimitar slashes the air. the rope is cut. o'connell crashes to the ground. half dead. rolls over. gagging. all of the prisoners burst into cheers. o'connell looks up at evelyn. she smiles broadly and waves down at him. curator's office night candle light flickers across the curator's face.}
<C>__{curator}
<D>__{she must die.}
<A>__{standing in the shadows across from his desk are three mumia: blue tinted skin, hideous facial tattoos, the works. one of the mumia has a rusty metal hook for a hand. he shrugs.}
<C>__{hook}
<D>__{she is like all the others. she will die in the desert.}
<C>__{curator}
<D>__{no! she has seen too much. she knows too much.}
<A>__{the curator leans across his desk, fear in his eyes.}
<C>__{curator}
<D>__{not only does she have a map, but she has the key.}
<A>__{spooks the hell out of the mumia guys.}
<C>__{hook}
<D>__{the key!? she has the lost key!?}
<C>__{curator}
<D>__{yes. no one has ever had so much, been so close. we must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.}
<C>__{hook}
<D>__{then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.}
<C>__{curator}
<D>__{and burn the map and retrieve the key.}
<C>__{hook}
<D>__{it will be done. but what of the american expedition? they leave tomorrow as well.}
<C>__{curator}
<D>__{forget the bumbling americans, they will be like all the others. without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find hamunaptra?}
