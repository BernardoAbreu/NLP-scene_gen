<C>__{madison}
<P>__{(to parker)}
<D>__{whatever he was doing here was only the start.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{start of what?}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{i don't know, yet. what we do know is his performances are increasing in scale, not decreasing.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{whatever it is, he isn't finished...}
<A>__{she moves closer to the screen as the tape is played back. madison studies sid 6.7 intently.}
<C>__{sid 6.7 }
<P>__{(recorded)}
<D>__{but rest assured...}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{a star is born.}
<C>__{madison}
<P>__{(to another cop)}
<D>__{you mind playing that part again?}
<A>__{her request is obliged.}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{freeze it there}
<A>__{she stares at sid 6.7, who is looking directly at her.}
<C>__{madison }
<P>__{(as if to sid 6.7) you've}
<D>__{discovered media, haven't you? you like the attention...the power...you like being a star. what are you going to do next, star? what are you going to...}
<A>__{her attention turns to the upper right corner of the screen, where onlookers are visible watching sid 6.7. their faces blurry. but even out of focus, it isn't hard to recognize lindenmeyer.}
<C>__{madison }
<P>__{(as if to lindenmeyer)}
<D>__{you do like to watch, don't you?}
<P>__{(to the surrounding cops)}
<D>__{if any of you are looking for daryl lindenmeyer, that's him...}
<A>__{she points to lindenmeyer, then makes her way over to parker, who's standing exactly where sid 6.7 was when he killed the skinhead. parker does not look at madison. his eyes are fixed on the tv in front of him.}
<C>__{madison }
<D>__{it's not just sid 6.7's performances that are increasing. stars need bigger and bigger audiences.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{whatever sid is going to do next, it's going to involve media.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you like baseball?}
<B>__{on the tv}
<A>__{the baseball game continues. players take the field at the start of a new inning. the outfielders can't help but glance at the beautiful woman being shown in close up on the massive screen over left field.}
<C>__{announcer }
<D>__{i will tell you, whoever's operating the stadium's closedcircuit cameras must have fallen in love because that beauty in j section has been on the stadium's big screen for over a minute now...}
<B>__{inside the electronics store}
<A>__{he grabs a police radio from a nearby officer.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(urgently into radio) this is}

<B>__{inside dodger stadium}
<A>__{on the massive screen over left field, the woman in close up looks embarrassed, trying to forget her face is now 40 feet high for all the other fans to see.}
<C>__{announcer }
<D>__{that's enough with the close up already, mr. demille. even the players are starting to get distracted...}
<A>__{the players on the field are all looking up at the massive screen.}
<B>__{inside the stadium control booth}
<A>__{the woman's face appears on various monitors. the phone rings. no one answers it. the room appears to be empty. the stadium's closed circuit tv director is not in his chair. he's lying dead on the floor.}
<B>__{on the j section camera platform}
<A>__{the closedcircuit camera remains focused on the woman. the camera is locked off. it's operator lies dead beside it.}
<B>__{through its viewfinder}
<A>__{sid 6.7 can be seen arriving next to the woman. he gently caresses her hair.}

<C>__{boyfriend}
<D>__{you make a better door than a window, buddy. keep it moving.}
<A>__{sid 6.7 picks him up out of his seat and throws him three rows ahead. sid 6.7 then puts hands around the woman's throat.}
<B>__{on the massive screen}
<A>__{over left field, the woman attempts to scream as sid 6.7 chokes her. no sound comes out.}
<B>__{fans}
<A>__{react with horror. but nobody turns away.}
<C>__{announcer }
<D>__{jesus christ! somebody stop him!}
<B>__{security personnel}
<A>__{rush from all parts of the stadium toward j section. sid 6.7 enjoys the reactions of the terrified fans around him as he chokes the life out of the woman.}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<P>__{(to the camera)}
<D>__{hey, parker, this one's for you...}
<A>__{his words echo around the stadium as he snaps the woman's neck. he then hurls her limp body toward several men as they charge him.}
<C>__{sid 6.7 }
<D>__{that's all, folks.}
<A>__{he leaps over a railing, rushing into a tunnel which leads out of the seating area.}
<B>__{a security guard}
<A>__{climbs up the stairs to the mouth of the tunnel. weapon in hand. he draws a bead on sid 6.7's back. boom!}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{a bullet rips through sid 6.7's side. blood begins to seep from the wound. but then immediately begins to retract. once his blood has returned, his skin heals over the wound. leaving a scar. which also then disappears. other than the hole in his shirt, sid 6.7 is as good as new. he never even misses a step as he disappears around the corner.}
<B>__{the security guard}
<A>__{stares in disbelief as he is joined by several comrades.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{i nailed the sonof abitch. i put a hole right through him...}
<A>__{panic stricken fans in j section start moving away from the area as fast as they can. parents clutching their children. climbing over seats. shoving anyone in their way.}
<C>__{announcer }
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, please try to stay calm. everyone just keep your seats...}
<A>__{fans all over the stadium start charging toward the exits.}
<B>__{outside dodger stadium}
<A>__{people bolt through the turnstiles, running away from the stadium as l. a. p. d. squad cars approach in the distance. the car in the lead is parker's. inside parker's vehicle parker speeds dangerously fast toward the fans streaming onto the street. madison braces herself.}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{slow down!}
<A>__{parker jams on the brakes with both feet. screeeeeeech!}
<B>__{outside dodger stadium}
<A>__{parker comes within inches of mowing down several people, who keep right on running. parker jumps out of the vehicle, scanning faces. in predator mode. madison gets out, clearly shaken. parker locks his gaze on somebody in the distance.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{a guy in dodger baseball cap and jacket. walking calmly away from the stadium. he descends down an escalator into a recently built subway station. it is sid 6.7.}
<B>__{parker}
<A>__{charges after him. a heatseeking missile locked on target.}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{parker.. .parker!}
<A>__{she does the best she can to follow after him. people knock into parker as hard as he does them. a human version of bumper cars. reaching the entrance to the subway, parker leaps down the escalator three steps at a time. madison remains in his wake.}
<B>__{inside the subway station}
<A>__{parker and madison hop the turnstiles. only to be stopped by a remotecontrolled, boxshaped robotic sentry, which is identical to one you have seen before. this sentry was one of reilly's creations at letac.}
<C>__{security robot}
<P>__{(male, authoritarian)}
<D>__{stop. you are in violation of...}
<A>__{parker spits in the robot's electronic eye. temporarily blinding it, as well as the guy operating it via remote control. parker and madison make their getaway as the robotic sentry struggles to clean off his eye.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{real effective security...}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{you could have just flashed him your badge, you know?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{authority still makes me nervous.}
<A>__{they come to a fork: one tunnel goes to east west trains, the other to north south.}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{which way?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{both.}
<A>__{he races down the tunnel to the north south trains. madison heads down the other. her determination beginning to win out over her inexperience.}
<B>__{parker}
<A>__{hesitates at the escalator leading to the south bound side of the tracks. further down the tunnel is the escalator to the northbound trains. parker chooses the escalator closest to him. on the south bound platform passengers pass the time by watching a television mounted above them. except for parker, who scans the crowd. then across the tracks. on the north bound platform in the entire crowd, there is only one person not watching the tv screen. he is watching parker. through his gun sight. sid 6.7 pulls the trigger. boom! on the south bound platform parker dives to the ground, just avoiding the bullet. he scrambles behind a pillar for protection. only to see the guy standing behind him wasn't as lucky. on the east bound platform madison hears the gunshot echo through the station. which scares the already terrified fans trying to get away from dodger stadium. chaos is rapidly becoming pandemonium.}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{she races up the escalator, taking out her weapon.}
