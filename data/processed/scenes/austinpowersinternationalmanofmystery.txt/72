<A>__{music: "what the world needs now" by burt bacharach austin looks at his address book. angle on the page: we see a list of names crossed out, with comments written in beside them. beside jimi hendrix we see "deceased, drugs"; janis joplin, "deceased, alcohol"; mama cass, "deceased, ham sandwich"; jerry garcia. "deceased, gratefully"; jane fonda, "square". austin looks at his old pair of sixties era canvas sneakers. he picks up his new pair reebok shaq cross trainer pumps. he pumps them too much and they explode. austin looks out his window at the lonely city below. we see the cds he's just purchased, including sergeant pepper's and burt bacharach's greatest hits. austin goes over to the kitchenette and puts a can of unopened campbell's tomato soup in the microwave and turns it on. it explodes in a shower of sparks and soup. he puts the cd on a record player and drops the needle. the noise is awful. austin plays mortal combat iii. his fighter gets his head ripped off, and blood spews out. austin is genuinely frightened by this.}
