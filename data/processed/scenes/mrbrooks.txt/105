<L>__{exterior car n day}
<A>__{atwood steps back as mr. smith gets out. behind her, detective snyder is standing next to the driver's door of an un marked police car which has blocked mr. smith in.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{so mr. baffert, what is that you have to tell me?}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{what do you mean? i don't have anything to tell you.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{really? because i was driving around and i got this sudden feeling that you had something to tell me about the murders.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{no. nothing.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{that's disappointing. because when i left you the last time we talked, i felt i had missed a clue that was right in front of me that would solve this whole case.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{i don't know why you would feel that.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{didn't you tell me you were an amateur potter, that you made bowls and vases?}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{no, i said i was an amateur photographer.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{are you positive? because we found potter's clay on the carpet of the murder house and i was sure you said to me that you worked with clay, that you made pots.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{no. i said my hobby was photography, not pottery.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{maybe that was it. the stewardess upstairs said the victims kept their curtains open when they made love. could i see some of the pictures you took of that couple?}
<A>__{mr. smith can only stare at detective atwood. his adam's apple moves up and down though he makes no sound. should he or shouldn't he? finally he throws his arms up in a shrug but in his half turn of indecision he happens to spy the newspaper he tossed at the passenger seat of his car. part of it is draped over the console. the red circles around the words on that page jump out at him.}
<C>__{mr. brooks }
<D>__{don't be stupid .}
<A>__{mr. smith returns his attention to detective atwood.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{you are harassing me, detective atwood. you know very well i'm not a potter and i don't have any pictures! so my feeling is that your feeling is wrong and that you should move your car and let me go home.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{what is your job here? what do you do?}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{i'm a mechanical engineer.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{you have to be pretty smart for that, don't you?}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{i guess.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{then be smart, mr. baffert. you lied to me right there at the end. i will be watching you. and when you want to tell me the truth, you know how to get in touch with me.}
<A>__{she gives him a dazzling smile.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{see you later, alligator.}
<A>__{atwood walks back to her car and gets in.}
