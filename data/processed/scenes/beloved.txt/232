<A>__{the house is filled with books and pearl white lamps and glass cases filled with glistening things. denver pushes her feet into the soft blue carpet as she sits with janey.}
<C>__{janey}
<D>__{you know what? i've been here since i was fourteen and i remember like yesterday when baby suggs, holy, came here and sat right where you are. whiteman name of garner brought her. he and mr. bodwin were good friends. that's how she got that house you all live in. other things too.}

<D>__{ya think?}
<C>__{janey}
<D>__{they getting older now and i can't take care of 'em like i used to. more and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. now, i don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. i got my own family needs me. it'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?}

<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{don't ask me what whitefolks need at night.}
<A>__{during janey's lines, denver looks about the house imagining herself here at night...her eyes happen upon a statue of a black boy on his knees, his head thrown back farther than a head could go, his mouth wide open like a cup and filled with money for delivery tips. on the pedestal are the words' at yo service;}
<C>__{denver}
<D>__{they good whitefolks?}
<C>__{janey}
<D>__{oh yeah. they good. can't say they ain't good. i wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. but you come back in a few days give me a chance to lead'em to it. all right?}
<A>__{denver nods, beaming gratefully so gratefully that no words come, only tears... janey reaches for denver's hand and holds it warmly;}
<C>__{janey}
<D>__{what is it, child? what's the trouble with sethe?}
<A>__{denver looks at her and we know she needs to tell someone.}
