<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior boat deck}
<A>__{on the boat deck, the action has moved to the aft group of boats, numbers}
<L>__{9, 11, 13 and 15 on the starboard side, and 10, 12, 14 and 16 on the port}
<A>__{side. the pace of work is more frantic. you see crew and officers running now to work the davits, their previous complacency gone. cal pushes through the crowd, scanning for rose. around him is chaos and confusion. a woman is calling for a child who has become seperated from the crowd. a man is shouting over people's heads. a woman takes hold of second officer lightoller's arm as he is about to launch boat 10.}
<C>__{woman}
<A>__{will you hold the boat a moment? i have to run back to my room for something lightoller grabs her and shoves her bodily into the boat. thomas andrews rushes up to him just then.}
<C>__{andrews}
<A>__{why are the boats being launched half full?! lightoller steps past him, helping a seaman clear a snarled fall.}
<C>__{lightoller}
<A>__{not now, mr. andrews.}
<C>__{andrews}
<P>__{(pointing down at the water)}
<A>__{there, look... twenty or so in a boat built for sixty five. and i saw one boat with only twelve. twelve!}
<C>__{lightoller}
<A>__{well... we were not sure of the weight }
<C>__{andrews}
<A>__{rubbish! they were tested in belfast with the weight of 70 men. now fill these boats, mr. lightoller. for god's sake, man! the shot hands off to cal, who sees lovejoy hurrying toward him through the aisle connecting the port and starboard sides of the boat deck.}
<C>__{lovejoy}
<A>__{she's not on the starboard side either.}
<C>__{cal}
<A>__{we're running out of time. and this strutting martinet...}
<P>__{(indicating lightoller)}
<A>__{...isn't letting any men in at all.}
<C>__{lovejoy}
<A>__{the one on the other side is letting men in.}
<C>__{cal}
<A>__{then that's our play. but we're still going to need some insurance.}
<P>__{(he starts off forward)}
<A>__{come on. cal charges off, heading forward, followed by lovejoy. the shot hands off to a finely dressed elderly couple, ida and isador strauss.}
<C>__{isador}
<A>__{please, ida, get into the boat.}
<C>__{ida}
<A>__{no. we've been together for forty years, and where}
<C>__{ida }
<A>__{you go, i go. don't argue with me, isador, you know it does no good. he looks at her with sadness and great love. they embrace gently.}
<C>__{lightoller}
<A>__{lower away!!}
