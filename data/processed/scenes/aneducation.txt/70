<A>__{david and jenny in bed, in a dimly lit bedroom. they are kissing david more passionately than jenny. he is making little whimpers of excitement, and jenny is clearly trying hard to hide her nerves. we're acutely aware of her age, and of her virginity. suddenly david breaks off.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{hold on a second. i've got something.}
<A>__{rather absurdly, he half disappears over the side of the bed, reaching for something on the floor. he comes back with a banana. jenny stares at him.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{what on earth is that for?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i thought....i thought we might want to practice.}
