<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm on point, vincent.}
<A>__{a wide angle the back lawn of the chateau pure kurosawa. the japanese drum we've heard before starts to play again as the long shadows of sam and vincent come out of the woods and into the brilliant light of the back lawn. for one minute they stand still, and among the many weapons that sam carries is a long automatic rifle, strung over his back, and in the silhouette for one minute it looks like a samurai sword. now the two men start to move across the lawn, hugging the shadows of the various statues and hedges, trying to keep from being discovered for as long as possible. back in the dining room }
<C>__{gregor}
<P>__{(to seamus)}
<D>__{so, you've got it all figured, do you?}
<C>__{seamus}
<D>__{figured enough to know there's an odd man out and i'm looking at him.}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{i think not.}
<P>__{(holds up the briefcase)}
<D>__{i have, of course, taken the precaution of wiring the briefcase to explode five seconds after it opens. unless, of course, i deactivate it before it goes off.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<P>__{(under her breath)}
<D>__{that fucking figures...}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{should any of you decide to rush me, i will kill myself and whoever happens to be near me at the time.}
<C>__{mikhi}
<D>__{and more importantly }
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{i will destroy whatever's in the case.}
<A>__{beat. nobody moves. nobody speaks. until finally }
<C>__{seamus}
<D>__{it looks, gentlemen, as if we're gonna have to sit down to table and work out an agreement.}
<A>__{before this entirely too weird scenario can play itself we go back to the back lawn of the chateau sam and vincent are closer to the chateau, moving in stealth, avoiding any entanglements and then sam turns a corner and comes face to face with a guard, and his gun is aimed at sam's head: sam's a dead man as we go }
<B>__{back to the dining room}
<A>__{automatic weapons fire splits the night, and everyone in the room looks at one another, before mikhi speaks.}
<C>__{mikhi}
<D>__{what was that?}
<A>__{back outside the chateau the guard who had sam in his sights falls down, dead, shot by vincent, whose smoking weapon is cradled in his arms. vincent smiles at sam.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{that's one less i owe you...}
<A>__{sam smiles, but it's no time to get satisfied. their presence revealed, there's no point in moving quietly. sam draws his weapons and as he and vincent charge across the lawn towards the chateau while back in the dining room more gunshots from outside not a war, but enough to cause serious alarm. deirdre, ever the soldier, draws her two automatic pistols.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<P>__{(to seamus and mikhi)}
<D>__{you two stay here and watch our mutual interest.}
<A>__{she nods at gregor and his briefcase, indicating what this mutual interest is. then she turns and bolts the room, and as she does we're back outside the chateau sam and vincent are running along, hugging the ground and whatever darkness they can find, while blind weapons fire rips into the ground around them, russian thugs not even sure what they're shooting at, but shooting all the same as sam and vincent hurtle towards a back entrance to the chateau some kind of kitchen storage area, and as sam and vincent burst in from outside five russian hoods come flying in from an interior entrance, and this is it, sam and vincent are outnumbered, outgunned, they're going to die and then they take out the entire room sam holds an automatic pistol in his left hand, and a submachine gun in his right, and when he fires, he does so in short controlled bursts, firing only when he has the target in his sights, while vincent fights with a kind of sheer force, a shotgun in one hand, an uzi in the other, he fires at anything and everything that moves, and he hits almost all of it and suddenly the room is quiet. everybody's dead except for sam and vincent. they drop their spent weapons and take out fresh ones even as they move towards the door it leads to two passages, each one leading to a separate wing of the chateau.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{let's work our way through the building. i will take one wing, you take the other.}
<A>__{vincent and sam split up, moving into separate wings of the chateau, and as they move off sam speaks a word of warning.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{watch your back, vincent.}
<A>__{and then they're gone, and we're with deirdre, who's running through the house, going from room to room, and we're with her for a minute, the japanese drum starts to play again, and now it's joined by more and more drums, and they continue for the test of this sequence and suddenly a huge burst of gunfire is heard, dragging deirdre's attention towards the ballroom and sam's in the middle of a pitched battle with three gunmen. he kills the first, and then the second, and then no third. the third gunman rolls out of the way as sam fires, the third gunman fires back and their shots go wide, ripping into mirrors and chandeliers, littering the floor with glass. and now we're on deirdre running through the halls as we hear one last burst of gunfire: somebody in the ballroom is dead. deirdre has almost reached the ballroom when sam comes flying out, and the two of them crash together, sending the two of them sprawling into the shot up mess that used to be the ballroom and as they crash to the ground, sam loses his weapon in the fall, but deirdre manages to hold onto one of her two guns. now the two of them roll to their feet, and as they do we're back in the dining room seamus the madman is pacing the floor, his face even worse than before: with each minute the mask of flesh that is now his face is becoming more grotesque. little pustules have started to form all over its surface, oozing a whitish viscous liquid. a new burst of fighting sounds can be heard, and seamus, who is no longer capable of thinking straight, loses it.}
<C>__{seamus}
<D>__{i can't take it anymore.}
<P>__{(to mikhi)}
<D>__{watch him, man, i'm going out and finish what needs finishing!}
<A>__{and seamus is gone, and so are we back to the ballroom where deirdre has her two guns pointed at sam and does nothing.}
<B>__{beat.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{go on, them...}
<A>__{but deirdre can't do it. there's something between these two, and now sam looks around and sees deirdre's other pistol lying on a broken chair, and now he kicks out with his foot and hits the chair leg, causing it to function as a lever, sending the gun through the air in a graceful slow mo arc until it thwacks into sam's hand. now he's armed and he looks back at deirdre. her finger tightens on the trigger, she's almost ready to shoot if sam raises his piece, he's a dead man.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{let it go, sam, walk away.}
<A>__{in response sam stares at deirdre for a beat and then he smiles an enigmatic smile and he steps sideways, into a nearby corridor, vanishing.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{god damn it!}
<A>__{she runs after him but she's too late the corridor outside is empty. now we're back in the dining room with gregor and mikhi, and the tension is unbearable, because they can hear the sounds of the fighting as it starts and then stops, but they don't have the least idea of what's going on. still, mikhi won't let gregor leave without giving up the briefcase. mikhi has a gun on gregor, who in turn holds the briefcase close, ready to open it and set off the 5 second timer that will blow it up.}
<C>__{gregor}
<P>__{(a feral hiss)}
<D>__{we'll die if we stay here!}
<C>__{mikhi}
<P>__{(threatening with the gun)}
<D>__{you'll die if you leave here.}
<A>__{gregor sits back down, fairly close to mikhi. then, in a manner so deft that mikhi never even notices, gregor extracts a wickedly thin stiletto blade from the leather lining of the briefcase. before mikhi can even react, gregor stabs his arm forward in a savage arc jamming the blade into mikhi's throat. mikhi drops his gun and reaches for the blade, already gagging on the blood spray which shoots from the slashed artery. within seconds mikhi falls to the ground, jerking viciously in his death throes as gregor picks up the pistol and runs to leave the room, and as he does we move to the gallery filled with paintings and sculptures, nothing less than 200 years old. this place is a maze, what with it's walls of paintings that jut out here and there, the various corridors which lead from room to room, and the sculptures which block sight lines. now we find vincent, pressed against a wall, a gun in each hand, while five russian mafia guys are hunting him down. we do a series of quick cuts as the five guys split up and look for vincent, all the while speaking in low russian voices. suddenly one of the guys turns a corner and sees nothing. no vincent. now he turns back and a fist crashes through a painting which hangs on a makeshift wall. it's vincent. his hand wraps around mafia guy's neck, pinning him in place. seconds later two quick shots rip through the painting, hitting mafia guy in the head. now the other men are alerted by the shots, they come running and vincent steps out firing and now it's a bullet fest, as he gets the drop on them, using the maze of the gallery to his fullest advantage, gunning them down first one then two three, and then no four. vincent turns, surprised that his man wasn't where he expected him to be when a shot rings out, hitting vincent, a flesh wound that disarms him. the last guy has the drop on vincent. now the last guy smiles a nasty little smile at vincent and a pistol spits fire and a bullet bursts out of the last guy's chest. it's sam. now sam and vincent exchange a look: sam has, once again, saved vincent's life.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{you have to stop doing that!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i will work on it...}
<A>__{the two men don't have time for any more words, they move from the gallery and find themselves in the dining room where they find nothing but the bloody remains of mikhi the gangster. sam and vincent are surveying the room when a voice comes from behind them }
<C>__{seamus }
<D>__{turn around real slow, and try hard not to breathe when you do it.}
<A>__{another angle seamus reilly has come in behind them, and he's got his gun pointed straight at sam's heart. if seamus is enraged at discovering gregor's absence, he's overjoyed to find sam in his place.}
<C>__{seamus}
<D>__{it's you...}
<P>__{(touches his face)}
<D>__{you're the one did this to my face, are you?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{that's me.}
<C>__{seamus}
<D>__{have a nice afterlife.}
<A>__{seamus pulls the trigger and his bullet spins out towards sam, ready to blow a hole through him except that vincent leaps forward and takes the bullet it rips into his side, a huge splash of red against his white shirt. he falls to the ground, horribly wounded, but he's given sam enough time, and now sam and seamus open fire on one another bullets ripping into the table, chewing up the china and crystal, taking glass shattering bites out of the chandelier above the table, turning the dining room from a primo louis xiv showpiece into shit as the two men move about and then suddenly they're face to face, each with a gun to the other mexican standoff. suddenly, from off screen }
<C>__{deirdre }
<D>__{seamus!}
<A>__{another angle deirdre has appeared, her gun leveled at the two men.}
<C>__{seamus}
<D>__{deirdre, do for him, woman, put a fucking bullet in his head!}
<A>__{deirdre hesitates, uncertain.}
<C>__{seamus}
<D>__{do it, for christ's sake, do it so we can find that stinking gregor, he's got the bloody package! for god's sake, you're a soldier...}
<A>__{these last words sink into deirdre: she is a soldier. her gun swivels towards sam.}
<C>__{seamus}
<P>__{(sensing he's getting to her)}
<D>__{you're one of us...you been born and bred with your own people, you can't go against your nature. c'mon, girl, i'm you're people.}
<A>__{deirdre makes up her mind.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{i'm no girl, seamus...}
<A>__{she fires a shot blowing seamus off his feet and through a huge plate glass window.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{and you ain't nobody's people.}
<A>__{she moves with sam to vincent, who is seriously wounded perhaps life threateningly so.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(to deirdre)}
<D>__{let's get him out of here...}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{finish the job...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{and now...}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(a commanding whisper)}
<D>__{finish it!}
<A>__{sam considers, but before he can make up his mind, deirdre sees something through the wreck of the dining room window out on the back lawn we've already seen that it's bordered on one side by the woods, for the first time we notice a lake, which laps against a private dock, where a row boat is tethered. now beneath a very full moon, the stark figure of gregor makes its way toward the dock.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{sam...}
<A>__{sam turns at the sound of her voice and sees gregor making his escape. sam looks back at vincent, who is almost passed out from blood loss.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i'm really sick of you saving my life. go out and get the bastard.}
<A>__{same makes up his mind, and as vincent passes out, sam runs out after deirdre and towards the private dock and as the two of them run we move with them.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{he's got the briefcase rigged to explode five seconds after anybody other than himself tries to open it.}
<A>__{and now they reach the dock and they find nothing no gregor. and the boat is still there. before sam can restrain her deirdre stps out towards the boat.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{deirdre, wait up }
<A>__{but it's too late: gregor steps out from behind a boathouse, and before deirdre can even figure out what happened, gregor has her in an arm lock, a gun to her head. his free hand sticks out and we see the briefcase, which is still handcuffed to his wrist.}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{you might have made a good field agent you arrogant american prick, but you're not smart enough to go up against me.}
<A>__{gregor and deirdre are poised at the edge of the lake. this private dock is made completely of stone, and the drop to the water is nearly five feet. sam has reached a position where there is no right answer. still, he points his gun at gregor, who in turn shields himself with deirdre's body.}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{go ahead, shoot... shoot and kill the bitch, i don't care.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and yet you don't shoot. interesting. put down your weapon and walk away.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{don't do it, sam!}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{shut up!}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{he'll kill me anway, sam, shoot though me and kill this fucker.}
<C>__{seamus }
<P>__{(a horrible croak)}
<D>__{if you don't, i will...}
<A>__{another angle seamus is somehow still barely alive he's not long for this world, but the will for revenge has driven him this far.}
<C>__{seamus}
<P>__{(to sam, in a cold pale rage)}
<D>__{shoot that traitorous bitch and i will let you live.}
<A>__{the top of seamus's head explodes, finishing him off once and for all, killed by vincent, who has staggered out to make this one necessary shot. but he can go no further, and he collapses in his own blood, near death, just as gregor takes a step towards the boat and sam makes up his mind and shoots the bullet flies across the screen impact the briefcase bursts, shot open by sam and now we're in slow motion as gregor relaxes his grip on deirdre as he struggles to close the case and deirdre takes the opportunity to dive the other, into the lake, while baboom! the case explodes, a flash of phosphorescent white light that incinerates gregor and the case and whatever was inside it with an explosion that knocks sam to the ground and when the light clears gregor and the case are gone, while the explosion echoes out over the lake, booming again and again until finally there is silence. sam looks out over the lake for any sign of deirdre but there is none. and then, after we've held for a beat longer than it should be possible for her to have survived her head splits the surface and she emerges, coughing. sam reaches down to help her out.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{are you alright?}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{alright? it's bloody fucking freezing in here!}
<A>__{sam pulls deirdre out of the water and then the two of them immediately turn and move towards vincent, and as they do we start to pull back on them, and now the sounds of sirens can be heard, one, then two more, and then a symphony of noise. and we're still pulling back on the chateau or what's left of it, because it's started to burn, and quickly the flames start to rise into the night, like something out of medieval times as we }
