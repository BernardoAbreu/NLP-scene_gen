<L>__{int morning the next day aokee's surf & snack shack}
<A>__{everyone is hurrying around, getting ready for opening day. robbie, wearing his new blue hawaiian shirt, is cutting pineapple. aokee is busy hovering over everyone, and cooking chicken on the grill. alex walks in.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(to robbie)}
<D>__{hey, hey lookin' good. blue is your color. beats that stupid t shirt, huh?}
<C>__{aokee}
<P>__{(unhappy, stressed)}
<D>__{alex! you are late. come on, is opening day!}
<A>__{robbie finishes the pineapple and hands the tray to aokee, almost spilling it.}
<C>__{aokee }
<P>__{(to robbie and alex)}
<D>__{you two start setting tables.}
<A>__{alex takes a pile of silverware wrapped in napkins, and points to robbie to grab a box of sugar packets to refill the dispensers. robbie grabs it quickly, enthusiastically, but loses his grip and spills the packets on the floor. at that moment, audrey a girl in her teens who works at aokee's and is stacking plastic cups on the counter, accidentally knocks a stack of cups to the ground. ramon, a teenage boy who works there is behind the counter. he bends over, disappearing, and we hear a crash of pots and pans. his head peers up from below the counter sheepishly. aokee turns from the grill looking at all this, and has a worried look, but smiles and shrugs weakly.}
<C>__{aokee }
<P>__{(to alex, gesturing)}
<D>__{alex. come here a minute.}
<A>__{alex comes up close next to him at the grill so they can talk.}
<C>__{aokee }
<P>__{(with intensity)}
<D>__{alex, look. we falling apart. i made you assistant manager this year. go assistant manage.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(agreeing)}
<D>__{no problem.}
<A>__{alex pops a cd out of the rack above the sound system, and puts it in the cd player, stopping the standard pastoral hawaiian music that has been playing. he turns up the volume some on the amp, and goes over to sarah, a teenage girl working there, and grabs her grass skirt by the velcro, removing it with a velcro rip.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{sorry, sarah, but i need to borrow this.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{hey! how did you know i wear shorts under that?}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(mock surprise, rolling his eyes)}
<D>__{oh, puh leeaase.}
<A>__{alex walks back out to the dining area, everyone is still working.}
<C>__{alex }
<P>__{(to all)}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, may i have your attention, please?}
<A>__{everyone stops and looks at alex.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{in exactly 30 minutes, hundreds of dripping wet customers with fistfuls of money smelling of chlorine and suntan lotion will be walking in here. and what will they be looking for?}
<P>__{(as if directing a choir)}
<C>__{everyone together}
<P>__{(except robbie, who doesn't know any better)}
<D>__{the best teriyaki east of the pacific!!!}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{annnnnnd?}
<C>__{everyone together}
<P>__{(again except robbie, who doesn't know any better)}
<D>__{the finest smoothies in the state!!!}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{now, everyone's a little tense, except me, of course. so to help you get in the proper frame of mind and relax, we need the right soundtrack.}
<P>__{(to aokee)}
<D>__{maestro?}
<A>__{aokee hits the play button on the cd player.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{this is little tune i like to call the paradise slide.}
<P>__{(mouthing with the song as it starts)}
<D>__{one, two, a one two three.}
<A>__{the music starts and alex, now wearing sarah's grass skirt, launches into his version of the electric slide, hawaiian style. everyone else gets the beat and begins working to the music. aokee is using his spatulas as drum sticks on the overhanging kitchen tools. ramon has inverted an empty pot and is beating it conga drum style. robbie has picked up the sugar packets and alex is dancing and quickly (almost casually) tossing silverware napkin rolls to robbie as robbie catches them (at first with some difficulty) and puts them on the tables. sarah has re stacked the cups, and is juggling salt & pepper shakers, placing them on the tables. audrey chops onions to the beat.}
<C>__{everyone together}
<P>__{(on the chorus)}
<D>__{don ho, don ho, don ho. don ho, don ho, don ho.}
<A>__{aokee has now taken all the chicken off the grill and comes out from behind the counter, dancing. the others form a conga line behind him.}
<C>__{everyone together }
<P>__{(on the chorus)}
<D>__{don ho, don ho, don ho. don ho, don ho, don ho.}
<A>__{as they go by the tables they put on any missing items. they get into it more and more, aokee especially, swinging his huge, 375 pound guy hips.}
<C>__{everyone together }
<P>__{(on the chorus)}
<D>__{don ho, don ho, don ho. don ho, don ho, don ho.}
<A>__{as the song ends (abruptly), aokee bumps a surfboard (part of the restaurant's decoration) with his hip, knocking it and another one to the ground. there is a loud crash and everyone pauses and looks at aokee, waiting to see if he gets mad. aokee looks down at his hip, and makes a puppy dog face like "i didn't know my hips were that big...." everyone claps, laughing. aokee takes a bow.}
