<A>__{renai shuffles down the corridor. she passes a bedroom door, then stops and doubles back, pushing it open and going into }
<L>__{interior cali's nursery continuous}
<A>__{ the babies room. she stares into the crib...at her other sleeping baby. she sets the baby monitor and walks out softly.}
<L>__{interior living room day}
<A>__{renai slumps in front of her piano. taps one of the keys. she plays a discordant melody of low notes with one hand, not present enough to hear it. she stops and buries her face in her hands. then she hears it. whispering. it's so low you would miss it if the house wasn't absolutely silent. renai looks up, scanning for the source of the murmur. it is coming from the baby monitor. confused, renai picks up the monitor, turning up the volume all the way up. the hissssssss of static fills the room. she presses her ear to the device, then hears it again a hushed whisper, almost indistinct from the static save for the whistle of sibilants.}

<D>__{they see us...all of us...we have to be quick...this life begs us to come back.}
<A>__{the whisper trails off....more static...}
<C>__{voice }
<P>__{(from monitor)}
<D>__{noooooooooooo!!!!!!}
<A>__{renai drops the baby monitor, leaping out of her skin at the sound of the scream. nerves fried. the monitor smashes on the floor. all is quiet. renai moves to the door, staring down the corridor at the door to cali's nursery. it is open only a crack. she hears crying. cali is crying. we follow her as she bolts towards the nursery, smashing through the door, eyes filled with terror, seeing nothing.}
