<L>__{interior bathroom night}
<A>__{and into the bathroom.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{wasn't until the shower that i realized you actually believed it. nearly froze to death waiting for you. thought the circuit breaker would kick back over and i'd be toast.}
<A>__{...then she's lowered into the tub.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{the crazy thing is...i have never for one moment stopped loving you.}
<A>__{he actually wipes a tear from his eye. he kisses her lips. we can feel her revulsion. his face over her.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{don't worry about caitlin. i'm sure in some tragic way this'll bring us closer together.}
<A>__{he turns on the faucets, then moves out of her line of vision. sound of a number being dialed.}
<C>__{norman }
<D>__{hey, it's norman. listen, we had a huge blowout, so i'm going down to sleep at the lab. i guess you're out, but... maybe...if you wouldn't mind stopping by to check on her in the morning?}
<A>__{she glances down and sees on the edge of the tub...a prescription bottle of valium with her name on the label. her eyes go wide.}
<C>__{norman }
<D>__{it's just...jody, it's bad. i've never seen her like this...}
<P>__{(he trails off, choking up)}
<D>__{i don't really know what to do anymore.}
<A>__{norman, lit periodically by the sweep of the light house beacon, squats with the phone and gazes down at her.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{if anything ever happened to her, i'd...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{anyway, thanks.}
<A>__{claire, mute, glances frantically around. one of her fingers begins to flutter.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(tearfully)}
<D>__{i'm so sorry.}
<A>__{the tub is rapidly filling. he checks his watch, then reaches for the valium. as much from will as the drug beginning to fade, claire lets out a garbled cry.}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(sloppy, guttural)}
<D>__{mmmuh...}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{shhhh.}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(slurry)}
<D>__{mauduh...}
<A>__{norman stops.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{madison!}
<A>__{norman seems unnerved that she's still clinging to her belief in the ghost.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{that's a little much, don't you think?}
<A>__{he sees the necklace on her neck.}
<C>__{norman}
<D>__{oops. can't have that.}
<A>__{he puts down the bottle of valium, then reaches around claire's neck to remove the necklace. when his hands close on the clasp, his face suddenly goes slack. norman's pov his arms around madison's beautiful corpse. norman explodes backwards, slamming his head into the brass shower nozzle. he staggers out of the bathroom before collapsing with a thud. the water finally rises above claire's nostrils. claire somehow manages to work a toe into the plug chain and yank it free. the water slowly descends. when it seems that her lungs must burst, her mouth finally clears the descending water. she chokes in great gulps of air. the drug is finally wearing off. claire sits up. norman's unconscious feet can be seen outside of the doorway. she turns off the water and stands unsteadily. she looks around for the phone and finally spots the little antenna protruding from under norman. she delicately pulls the phone out of his back pocket, only to discover that it's been broken by his fall. she drops it and walks quietly out of the room.}
