<A>__{the old man dives under his truck to hide. the shooting starts. we see the chicken truck. two men in the front seat. they see ahead of them an incredible shooting match and, in terror, they jam on the brakes and leap out of the truck. they run as fast as they can into the meadow, away from the trouble. the gun fight takes just seconds during which law fires eight seven shots at bonnie and clyde, giving them absolutely no chance. the sound is rapid, deafening. at no point in the gun fight do we see bonnie and clyde in motion. we see, instead, two still photographs cut into the sequence: one of clyde, half out of the car, taking careful dead aim with his gun, just as he did in the teaching scene: one of bonnie, in terror, a pack of cigarettes in her hand clutched tight, looking as fragile and beautiful as she can be. the noise stops at once. utter silence. it has been a massacre. bonnie and clyde never had a chance to return the gunfire. we see the car, a complete shambles. we never see bonnie and clyde dead, though for a moment we discern their bodies slumped in the car. the camera pulls above the car until it is on a level with the opposite side of the road. then, slowly, the six lawmen stand up in the trench. on the faces of the five deputies, horror and shock at what they have just done. hamer, however, registers no emotion. his face is a blank. he lights a cigarette. slowly, slowly, the five men begin to edge closer to the car to see the result. music, the wild country breakdown music, begins on the sound track. before they reach the car, the camera swings away from them, past them, and zooms out and above into the meadow where the two truck drivers are standing tiny, distant figures. the truck drivers begin to walk toward the camera, coming back to the road to see what happened. they get closer and closer to the camera until they have reached a middle distance and, as they continue to walk at us, it is }
