<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(muttering to himself)}
<D>__{all right all right, mrs. dreyfuss.}
<A>__{he glances at the sleeping fran, picks up the tray, carries it into the living room, pulling the bedroom door closed behind him. but it doesn't shut completely, because of fran's dress hooked over the top. bud crosses to the hall door, opens it. outside are kirkeby, with the champagne bucket, and sylvia.}
