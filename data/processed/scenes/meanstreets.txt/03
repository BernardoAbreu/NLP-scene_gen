<L>__{interior party home movies day}
<A>__{opening titles appear over 8mm. home movies in which charlie is shown along with his friends and family in a celebration...a sense of "one big unending party." during this opening segment we see some of the characters that will later appear in the story: johnny boy, michael, tony, teresa, charlie's uncle giovanni, and others. they are all sicilian and are members of the same italian american neighborhood in new york city. (we sense, from these home movies, that the neighborhood forces its people to be strongly tied together in a way of life family, church, friendship.) these home movies were taken during some formal and casual gatherings in which charlie participated.}
