<A>__{john, ted, lori and ted's dolled up and sort of trashy date tami lynn (the bag girl from the grocery store) eat dinner.}
<D>__{tami lynn see, i was all pissed off `cause me and my friend danielle were supposed to go skydiving last year, but then she got pregnant from this asshole guy, and so we couldn't go and i was all upset, but then she had a miscarriage, and so we ended up getting to go skydiving, and it was so scary but it was so much fun.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hey, well... it sounds like everything worked out then. tami lynn i guess god wanted me to go skydiving, y'know?}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{jesus. tami lynn or jesus, yeah, but whatever.}

<D>__{company's turnin' 20, eh? so you can bang it but you can't get it drunk.}
<A>__{tami lynn laughs heartily at this, as does john. lori isn't quite as delighted.}
<C>__{lori}
<P>__{(visibly annoyed)}
<D>__{i'm surprised john didn't tell you already. seems like you guys have seen each other every day since you moved out.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{well, it's funny, usually the first item on our agenda is "what's goin' on with lori?" so i'm surprised that one slipped through the cracks.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{we do, we talk about you all the time.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{right?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oh my god, remember, ted, last week we were talking about... how... neat all of lori's shoes are?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{that was a lengthy conversation.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{and we were saying like, a lot of women look like unsteady horses when they wear high heels, but lori has a sort of... regal... trot.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{a canter.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oh my god yes. you canter.}
<A>__{lori stares at him for a beat, then:}

<C>__{lori}
<D>__{no, right, i was all i was doing was asking. ted's very... attractive, i'm just always interested in the... type of girl that can snatch him up. tami lynn did you just call me a whore?}

<C>__{john}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i... i made you out to be a hero.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{john, ted moved out so we could give ourselves a chance without him. you're not really giving anything a chance if you're blowing off work to get high with your teddy bear.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it won't happen again, i promise.}
<C>__{lori}
<P>__{(with a bit of anger)}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{hey, ted moved out, didn't he? i did that for you for us! and it wasn't easy.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{jesus, he might as well still be living with us, john. you spend more time with him than you do with me.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{okay, look. i've been getting stoned too much. i know that. i've been bumming around with ted too much, i know that, too. give me one more chance, i promise i can fix it. lori, i love you too much, please give me one more chance.}

<D>__{oh. wonder where it'll hit first.}
<A>__{wider angle on the restaurant. for a moment, nothing happens. then, a guy at a table on the right (sitting with a couple other men and women) screams into his napkin, followed by his dining companions.}
