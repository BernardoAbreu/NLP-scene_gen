Kirsty Still belted to her seat. Her eyes are wide with desperation, breath quickening, sinking fast... Kristy pounds the window with her hands, trying to get out. She's trapped.

CLOSE ON TREVOR'S FACE as he struggles to see what's happening back there but it's useless. He cannot move a muscle. He hears a sickening SAWING noise and his eyes bulge in horror. WIDE as the doctors calmly lift Trevor's freshly sawed cranium from his head exposing his brain. The CHIEF SURGEON- a large unshaven man with magnifying lens alreaday in place make his eyes enormous and his face grotesquely distorted. He walks up, presented with a tray full of evenly arranged pins. He cranks up the magnification of his lenes which make his eyes appear even larger. Though no one speaks his name his name tag reads Dr. Barker.}

A CHURCH BELL RINGING causes Trevor to wake again up, wincing at the sound. As the church passes the BELL becomes louder and louder. Trevor hears LAUGHTER and looks up at the children.

Dirty dishes sit in the sink. A cockroach skitters across the kitchenette. Trevor sits at his TV playing an extremely violent videogame. We're talking heads getting blown off, bodies exploding, limbs being severed. As the end ends a DEMONIC VOICE chuckles from the TV.}

It's so quiet in here we can almost hear his head pounding in pain. He shuts his eyes. A couple of the fluorescent bulbs over his head wink out and the rest flicker weakly. When Trevor opens his eyes again he notices the room has gotten considerably darker. He looks up at the weakening lights and grunts in disgust. The light is just dim enough now so that he can't see what's in the vending machine. He goes right up to the glass and peers into the machine, using his hand as a visor. This strain on his eyes intensifies his headache. It's still pretty murky inside the glass case. Trevor squints and just when he thinks he can read a wrapper on... what is it? A candy bar?- A PALE HAND suddenly presses against the glass from inside the machine. Trevor jolts backwards. The hand is gone. But in the reflection of the glass Trevor notices someone has been standing behind him. He whirls around- -and is face to face with our worst nightmare: PINHEAD.}
