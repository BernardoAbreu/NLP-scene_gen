<L>__{exterior godfather's courtyard hand and pencil day}
<A>__{a hand tap, tap, taps against a ledger.}
<B>__{courtyard}
<A>__{ashoka sits behind a little table, picking absently at his face. the goonda is slouched near the table, smoking a cigarette and fiddling with a thin switch. (it's dif ficult for him to show ashoka the respect his inherited position gives him.) the goonda has a bruise under one eye from his altercation in the city of joy yesterday. the air is filled with the muffled sounds of the street. from here, we can see the evermore enfeebled godfather in his "throne room," wrapped in a cashmere, listening to the radio. ashoka looks up, stares impassively at someone.}
<C>__{ashoka}
<D>__{well. what have you got to say?}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{for the first time, we see who ashoka's speaking to.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{i told them that your father provides us with a great deal and that }
<A>__{ashoka slams his hand on the register.}
<C>__{ashoka}
<D>__{from this minute, you are off the list! you will leave your rickshaw here... where it will be reserved for a man who deserves our trust.}
<A>__{he stands up. hasari is near tears.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{please, babu, this is as if the ground has opened up. i have to speak to mr. ghatak!}
<A>__{hasari starts for the house. the goonda stops him and, quickly, has hasari on his knees, his arm twisted pain fully behind his back. ashoka jumps at hasari, grabs his ear.}
<C>__{ashoka}
<D>__{my father's ill! you are speaking to me!}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{i have a family!}
<C>__{ashoka}
<D>__{the decision is made. i have made it. now get out before i have mr. bhose break your legs.}
<A>__{he gives hasari's ear a vicious twist and slams his head against the table.}
