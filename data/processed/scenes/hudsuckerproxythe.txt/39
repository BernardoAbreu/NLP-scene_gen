<B>__{double oak doors}
<A>__{labeled "executive conference room." a secretary is hanging up a sign that reads: "quiet please! board meeting in session."}
<L>__{interior boardroom close on norville}
<A>__{chest and up. his upper torso is swaying, his shoulders rhythmically rolling as he talks. we hear a whoosh whoosh sound from o.s.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{ so we have economy, simplicity, low production cost and the potential for mass appeal, and all that spells out great profitability...}
<B>__{close on mussburger}
<A>__{staring. holding a just lighted but forgotten cigar in one hand, and a still burning match in the other.}
<C>__{norville }
<D>__{...i had the boys down at r & d throw together this prototype so that our discussion here could have some focus...}
<B>__{board}
<A>__{staring, mouths hanging open, in arrested motion much like when waring hudsucker jumped out the window at the previous board meeting.}
<C>__{norville }
<D>__{...and to give you gentlemen of the board a first hand look at just how exciting this gizmo is...}
<B>__{wider on norville}
<A>__{still gyrating. we now see that he has accelerated the hula hoop around his waist to quite a good speed.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{...it's fun, it's healthy, it's good exercise; kids'll just love it, and we put a little sand inside to make the whole experience more pleasant. and the great part is we won't have to charge an arm and a leg!}
<A>__{mussburger's forgotten match has burned down to his fingertips. with a wince, he shakes it out. the board is staring.}
<C>__{elderly executive}
<D>__{yeah but... what is it? executive #2 does it have rules? executive #3 can more than one play? executive #4}
<P>__{(to #3)}
<D>__{what makes you think it's a game? executive #3 is it a game? executive #5 will it break? executive #6 it better break eventually! executive #2 is there an object? executive #3 are you supposed to make it fly off? executive #5 does it come with batteries? executive #4 could we charge extra for them? executive #7 is it safe for toddlers? executive #3 how can you tell when you're done? executive #2 how do you make it stop? executive #1 is that a girl's model or a boy's? executive #3 can a parent assemble it?? executive #7 what if you get tired before it's done? executive #6 is there a larger model for the obese? executive #4 can you do it around your neck?}
<C>__{elderly executive}
<D>__{and finally... what is it?}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{you know, for kids! it's... it's ... well, it's...}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{it's brilliant.}
<A>__{the board looks at mussburger.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{...it's genius. it's just exactly what hudsucker needs at this juncture. sure, sure, a blind man could tell you that there's an enormous demand for this, uh...}
<A>__{he smiles weakly at norville.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{...congratulations, kid, you've really outdone yourself. reinvented the wheel. i'm going to recommend to the board that we proceed immediately with this, uh... with the, uh... that the dingus be mass produced with all deliberate speed. of course, as president of the company the ultimate decision is yours.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{well... i'm for it...}
