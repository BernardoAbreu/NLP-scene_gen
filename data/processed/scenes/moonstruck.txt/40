<L>__{interior ronny's apartment day}
<A>__{it's a two bedroom apartment. the decor reflects ronny's love of the opera. the furniture is overstuffed, fringed in the colors of italian passion. but it is all a bit faded, the remains of an old flamboyance. the walls are decorated with opera posters; and over the fireplace there is a painting depicting a scene from "la boheme": mimi is standing in the snow. ronny stares at the picture of mimi in the la boheme poster. loretta comes in from the kitchen and sets down a cup of coffee.}
