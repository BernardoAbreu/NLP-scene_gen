<A>__{john moves down the hall with the fifty or so other visitors. he eases toward the elevator, keeping his eye on the guard ahead. by the time the group stops for the door ahead to open, john's managed to be right beside the elevator. he folds his coat over his arm to block others from seeing and feels for the slot. finding it, he slips in the bump key. it fits. the guard at the lead opens the door to the first visiting room and the crowd starts moving again. john quickly bumps the key and turns it but it won't turn. he bumps it again. visitors keep moving past him. he looks over his shoulder, sees the guard following them is preoccupied at the door. he turns it harder. nothing. he tries to pull it out. it's stuck. john panics. the rear guard closes the entry door and follows the crowd. john tugs at it one last time, and then turns it hard and snaps it off in the lock. a black woman among the visitors sees what he is doing but averts her eyes. john drops the rest of the broken key and kicks it into the slot between the elevator and the shaft. he slips back into the crowd and moves on. near the rear of the crowd now, john approaches the door to the visiting room. he throws a look back, sees another guard step up and try to insert his key in the elevator. john rounds the corner into the visiting room. the camera stays on his face until we finally hear a deafening alarm.}
