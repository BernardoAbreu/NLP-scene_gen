<D>__{rubin i can help you!}
<A>__{he shakes his head. she tugs harder on the doors. stuck. looks through the window to see he's tied them together with some climbing rope. in that same instant a shaft of brilliant daylight floods half the room as the outside door is whipped open. a man in full ecw stands in the doorway. he's wearing a face mask and goggles. holds an ice axe poised, ready to strike it's the same guy who attacked her. rubin bolts back toward the door separating he and carrie, but swooosh! the ice axe is buried into his shoulder, gaffing him like a fish. the pain's excruciating for rubin, who spins on his attacker like a wild man. bulldozes into him, driving him back out the door. both tumble down a steep set of stairs the exposed end of the ice axe gets stuck in a step's steel meshing on the way down rips out of rubin's shoulder.}
