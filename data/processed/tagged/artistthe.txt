<D>__{we see peppy on a shoot, sitting in a chair with her name on it, smoking a cigarette. everyone about her is busy preparing a shot. suddenly an assistant brings her a telephone. she takes the receiver with a smile and listens. her expression tightens a little. she hangs up, pensive for a moment. on set,the director gestures to his assistant that the shot is ready and they are good to go. the assistant goes towards peppy to let her know but, as he gets to where she should be, her seat is empty. he looks everywhere for her, but she has disappeared.}

<D>__{peppy bursts into the lobby, talks to a woman at the desk who directs her with a raised hand that peppy immediately follows. she bounds up the stairs four at a time and comes into a corridor,}
<L>__{interior hospital corridor and george's room day}
<D>__{and then to a door through the window of which she sees george lying down. his dog is at the foot of the bed, asleep. george is on a drip, unconscious and covered in bandages. a doctor is in the room with a nurse. peppy enters. she's anxious but the doctor seems reassuring. title card: he's not in any danger now. he just needs to rest. peppy goes up to george. she notices that his burnt hands seem to still be clutching something. she's intrigued. in response, the doctor shows her the reel of film that sits in a corner of the room. title card: he was holding that. it was real hard to pry it away from him. peppy picks up the can. the label is too damaged to be able to read the title of the film. she opens it and unrolls some of the film in front of the window. we see random photograms run by. it's the only sequence they ever shot together, years before. peppy is moved. without turning round, she asks the doctor: title card: do you think he could come rest up at my place? the doctor nods with a kindly glint in his eye. title card: it's probably the very best he could have hoped for.}
<L>__{exterior peppy's house day}
<D>__{an ambulance takes george, still unconscious, to peppy's house. jack is with him. it's a large, beautiful house, very expensive and very hollywood. but it's also very inviting.}
<L>__{interior peppy's house george's bedroom & corridor night}
<D>__{it's night time. george is in bed. he opens one eye. then he wakes up and looks around, not understanding where he is. jack wakes up and barks, wags his tail. a nurse who had been dozing in an armchair facing the bed awakes with a start, then goes over to george. she reassures him, motions to him not to get upset, then slowly leaves the room before running off down the corridor. she knocks at a door then goes back to george's room. peppy is close on her heels. she comes into the room in her nightgown. when he sees her, george smiles and she rushes over to the bed and puts her arms tight around him. she is terribly moved but, when she releases him from her arms to talk to him, she realizes that he has lost consciousness again and so was not sharing the same special moment as she. she pulls a face, afraid she might have done something wrong, glances over at the nurse, then lays george's head back on his pillow.}
<L>__{interior peppy's house george's bedroom day}
<D>__{the next morning, peppy brings breakfast into george's room and they eat it together. she laughs, talks, eats, drinks and is as vivacious as he had dreamed she would be all those years before. he looks at her with a smile on his face. then she looks at her watch and realizes she needs to hurry. title card: i've got to go. i have to be on set for nine o'clock. george smiles kindly at her. she returns the smile but we can tell that maybe reality has just reminded them that she is working, and he is not. they exchange a last glance before she leaves the room. george, now alone, gets up with some difficulty. he picks up a pile of folded clothes from an armchair. it's his jacket and pants, both half burned. on the floor, his shoes are in exactly the same state of disrepair.}
<L>__{interior peppy's house day}
<D>__{a little later, and alone, he's exploring the house. it's richly and tastefully decorated, highly personal. he goes along a corridor and down a wide stairway. jack begins sniffing outside of one door, as though he wants to go inside.}
<L>__{interior peppy's house storeroom day}
<D>__{george opens the door and goes into the room, it's a kind of storeroom in which everything is covered up with sheets. he closes the door behind him. the room has a ghostly quality to it. jack sniffs about everywhere. george too seems troubled by the strange pervading atmosphere. his curiosity is spurred by a convoluted object that is covered in a thin cloth. a ray of light surges into the room. the door has opened and, standing against the daylight, is a maid. title card: you should go back to your room, sir. george nods with a smile. the maid leaves pretty swiftly, we haven't seen her face, the whole moment seems rather strange. george is intrigued but leaves the room. he has to call jack to him. jack is reluctant to go but finally obeys his master.}
<L>__{interior kinograph studios peppy set 1931 day}
<D>__{a screenplay lies on a table. peppy and zimmer are seated either side of the table and are talking animatedly. we're on the set we saw the previous day, and peppy seems to be trying to convince zimmer of something. she seems to be describing a film poster or the facade of a movie theater she'd love to see. he doesn't seem too enthusiastic from the looks of the negative shakes of his head and his apologetic air as he listens to peppy. she finally stops talking and gives him a determined look. zimmer, uncomfortable and sorry, calmly replies. title card: george is a silent movie actor. he belongs to the past. today he's a nobody. as zimmer's speaking, she removes her accessories and hat. zimmer is so intrigued he stops talking. title card: what are you doing? she looks him straight in the eyes, and answers: title card: i'm stopping work. it's him or me. she looks determined. he's looking unsure of himself. he visibly isn't sure he's understood properly. she drives her point home. title card: what i mean is it's either him and me! or neither of us! zimmer still isn't sure he's understood. he just looks at her. title card: i'm blackmailing you, get it?! even when she's blackmailing, she's still pretty, and zimmer looks at her totally at a loss but at the same time it's obvious that he's going to back down. the people around them are listening in on their conversation and seem to be waiting for his decision. there's an element of deja vu to the situation, and zimmer, who already backed down a few years before, gives in. title card: and why not... she smiles at him, picks up the screenplay with delight, and leaves. as he moves away she whistles at him. he turns round and she vigorously blows him a kiss.}
<L>__{interior peppy's car (driving) day}
<D>__{the screenplay lies on the front seat of a car. the camera pulls back, it's clifton who is in the driving seat.}
<L>__{interior peppy's house george's bedroom day}
<D>__{george is lying in bed when his former chauffeur comes in. at first, he's delighted to see him, but this turns into astonishment and he seems to ask the man a question. the chauffeur answers: title card: i work for miss miller now. george visibly doesn't know what to think and, although he remains pleasant, becomes somewhat reserved. it's as though something has come between them. the chauffeur places the screenplay on the bedside table. george seems to greet it with mistrust, certainly not with enthusiasm. the chauffeur also has a box of cakes with him that he puts on a plate for george. george doesn't want any, it's all too much... before he leaves, the chauffeur overcomes his habitual reserve for the first time and says to george: title card: she's been good to you. she's always looked out for you. the chauffeur leaves without trying to convince george further, as the other looks on full of pride and doubt.}
<L>__{exterior peppy's house day}
<D>__{from the window, we see the chauffeur get into the car and drive off. we recognize the car as being the one that belonged to george.}
<P>__{(109) at the window, george watches him leave. then he seems}
<D>__{to have an idea or, more exactly, an intuition.}
<L>__{interior peppy's house storeroom day}
<D>__{george goes into the room that's full of sheets. he goes straight over to the object with the bizarre shape and lifts up the sheet. underneath he finds his former objet d'art, the three monkeys "hear no evil", "speak no evil" and "see no evil". he thinks for a moment, then pulls of another sheet to reveal a piece of furniture. once again it's a piece that used to belong to him and we recognize it from having seen it at the auction room. after taking off several other sheets, george realizes that she bought everything he had put up for sale: furniture, paintings, objets d'art, souvenirs, etc. he rips off sheets one after the other and the objects appear, even down to his suits and tuxedos. he continues and discovers the painting depicting him in a tux, waving and smiling. george looks stunned at the sight of himself looking so full of life. he's interrupted by the same ray of light which surges into the room once more. this time, at the door, are the butler and the maid. george walks towards them when he sees them. the closer he gets to them, however, the more his expression tightens. we realize that the butler is none other than the distinguished looking man who purchased everything at the auction, and that the maid is the woman who was bidding against him to raise the sale prices. george is looking at them as he leaves the room. he has recognized them, but doesn't say anything to them. he walks off, still shocked by what he's just realized.}

<D>__{he finishes putting on his burnt suit in his room, and leaves.}
<L>__{interior peppy's house day}

<L>__{exterior beggar street day}
<D>__{george is in the street wearing his burnt suit and damaged shoes. he is shirtless. with jack by his side, he walks along the sidewalk. there are a few other people walking along. about twenty yards ahead of him a man is begging. he holds out his hand to passers by. george approaches and, when there are no other passers by between him and george, the beggar glances at him and lowers his hand. he doesn't raise it as george approaches. george stops in front of him and looks at him, but the beggar motions to him to scram. george continues on his way. for that moment at least, he has become one of them. he buttons up the collar of his suit in an attempt to hide the fact that he doesn't have a shirt then, heads off and loses himself in the crowd. some distance later, he stops to check his reflection in a shop window. the image he sees is that of a bum. it's even more striking because the in the window there is a young male mannequin wearing a tux, top hat and white scarf. the image of the mannequin and that of george are superimposed. a cop comes up to george and begins talking to him in a friendly manner. he speaks but we don't know what about. there is not title card. george visibly has no idea what the cop is talking about. the cop seems to be talking about nothing important, just chatting... he talks and talks... george doesn't understand what he's saying, and doesn't understand why he's talking to him. he's lost. title card: what did you say? the cop smiles, carries on talking, then stops. he thinks he's talking to a madman. he doesn't persist, merely sizes george up and, once he's decided that he's harmless, the cop walks off. george, totally bewildered by the incident, seems to lose his grip on himself a little more.}

<D>__{peppy gets home in the evening, arms laden with flowers. she's happy. she quickly goes up the stairs and into george's bedroom. he's not there. she looks for him but can't find him. the maid says that he has left. she drops the flowers.}
<L>__{interior george's burnt house day}
<D>__{george goes into his house that has been disfigured by the fire. the flames have changed everything and the atmosphere, here again, seems ghostly and sad. george sits down in an armchair in the darkness. jack sits down facing him. he wags his tail and it thumps on the ground.}
<L>__{interior peppy's house storeroom day}
<D>__{in the room with all the sheets, peppy is with the maid. the maid seems to be telling her what happened with george, how he removed all the sheets, etc. peppy listens with an inscrutable expression on her face. then, suddenly overcome by a terrible thought, she rushes outside.}
<L>__{exterior peppy's house day}
<D>__{she runs out of the house and over to the car, but the chauffeur isn't there. she honks the horn to call him but there's no response. she honks the horn again, then, not wanting to wait any longer, and seeing the keys on the dashboard, she gets behind the wheel, starts the engine and pulls off in a series of kangaroo hops. it's obvious that she doesn't know how to drive all that well, but still goes at full speed more or less successfully. just as she passes through the gate, the chauffeur turns up. too late. he sees her drive away.}

<L>__{interior george's burnt house day}
<D>__{outside george's house, the wind is slamming one of the shutters with the regularity of a metronome. george takes a gulp of liquor, then puts down the glass, opens a cardboard box and takes out a pistol that he places on the table in front of him. he picks up the glass for another gulp. jack doesn't like what he sees. he barks.}
<P>__{(119) as for peppy, she's speeding along, totally ignoring}

<D>__{like mad. george, still in the same position, closes his eyes. title card: "bang!" george is in the same position. he still has the pistol in his mouth. visibly, he's heard a bang from outside, because he takes the pistol out of his mouth and looks out the window.}
<L>__{exterior george's burnt house day}
<D>__{outside, we see peppy's car has rammed into the gate and is still shuddering. peppy didn't brake in time, but she doesn't care. she jumps out the car and runs into the house.}
<L>__{interior george's burnt house day}
<D>__{she rushes into the living room and stops for a moment to look at george. george awkwardly tries to hide the pistol behind him. she bursts into tears. title card: i feel so awful. i only wanted to help you. to take care of you... he seems to reply that no, it's not her fault, she's got nothing to feel bad about. he opens his arms towards her, still holding the pistol and the gun fires itself. fortunately no one is hurt, but the incident makes peppy laugh and, between sobs and gasps of laughter she throws herself into george's arms. they hug for a long time. peppy says into his ear, title card: you've got so much that no one else has... and into her ear, george replies: title card: no, i'm nothing but a shadow. no good for anything but silence. peppy doesn't reply. she just holds him tighter still and closes her eyes. jack is sitting close by, watching them and wagging his tail. outside, the shutter is still slamming and the car is still shuddering. peppy opens her eyes. visibly, she's had an idea. jack wags his tail and thumps it on the ground. the shutter slams. the car shudders. peppy smiles at george. title card: i know what you have that no one else does. peppy moves away from george and motions to him to listen. the shutter slams. jacks tail thumps. the car shudders... peppy does a few tap steps. george doesn't understand. peppy starts again, with a beaming smile, waiting for his response. george does a few tap steps himself, basic ones, without any great enthusiasm. she smiles at him and does a few more complex steps that are a lot livelier. he smiles back finally understanding the golden gift that he has in his feet. he looks at peppy lovingly with a beaming smile on his face.}
<L>__{interior kinograph studios (1931) zimmer's office day}
<D>__{music suddenly begins to play and we see feet dancing in another decor. except that from now on we actually hear the sound of the tap steps. we pull back to find peppy and george in zimmer's office. they're dancing for him. little by little, zimmer is convinced by them, and, when they finish their demonstration, he has a broad smile on his face.}
<L>__{interior studio peppy & george day}
<D>__{we find peppy and george on a film set, still dancing. the piece of jazz they are dancing to has gone so crazy that now everyone wants to get up and dance! they are dancing a tap number facing the camera, in a decor representing a stylized new york. the choreography is incredible, in the grand style of the old hollywood musicals and they finish with a knee slide that brings them right up to us with big smiles on their faces. the music stops on a powerful blast from the brass instruments that leaves everyone bursting with energy. in the ensuing silence, peppy and george stay exactly where they were, facing the camera, with the smile stuck on their faces. it goes on for a little too long, they are out of breath. then they look at someone off shot. they are facing a film crew (from their era of course). the director smiles. zimmer, sitting next to him, seems ecstatic. the director speaks and we hear what he says.}

<A>__{the credits run while peppy and george go back to their positions. the camera (ours) pulls back and into frame come all the technicians who are setting up the shot, the hair, make up and costume people for continuity, the camera coming into position, the director coming over to say a few words to the star couple, in short: the shot being prepared for another take. and, when everyone is in position, the director speaks into his megaphone and we hear "ok, camera! sound! rolling... and... action!" fade to black and the music picks up again for the end of the credit sequence.}
