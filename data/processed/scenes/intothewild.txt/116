<D>__{well, there's no choice about it. i'm gonna get you some dinner.}
<A>__{wayne lights his cigarette, puts the truck in gear and they head down the road. as the sun dips behind the horizon we tilt up off the departing truck to the sky. ominously mounting clouds stunningly reflect the red rays of the hidden sun:}
