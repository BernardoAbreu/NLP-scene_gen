<A>__{camera is across the road from chris as one by one cars pass him by. he turns to move north by foot and we track with him, his back to oncoming traffic, he continues to hitchhike with an extended thumb. something catches his eye in the treeline beside the road. reverse: chris, moving to the mysterious object. as he lifts it, we see that it is a goofy looking straw hat. he dusts it off, and snugs it onto his head, when a police car comes into frame and stops beside chris. with a quick blast of the siren, chris turns to regard the police car. the policeman gets out of the car and moves to chris.}

<C>__{policeman}
<D>__{do you see a safe area for a vehicle to stop? we got a tree lined highway without a substantial shoulder here. and we've had a lot of accidents on this road from people stopping in the traffic lane for hitchhikers.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{alright, but...i mean, you stopped your car. you're in the traffic lane. and you can see, there's hardly any cars out here. plus, it's a straight road; you can see for a long ways.}
