<A>__{vaughan hands the microphone to a stills cameraman who also functions as an assistant, and then sinks down into the silver car. seagrave starts the porsche, which settles quickly into a husky idle. a few blips of the throttle, and then the porsche is reversed down to the edge of the lighted strip of road. when the porsche stops, the excited crowd goes quiet. an assistant with a walkie talkie kneels beside the silver car on the driver's side, co ordinating the start with his opposite number standing next to the ford over the hill. there is a calculated pause before anything happens, and then the porsche spins its wheels and accelerates up the hill. from their vantage point in the stand, james and helen can clearly see that the ford has also started and that the two cars are headed toward each other, each in its respective lane. the porsche accelerates hard, the ford lumbers along at a moderate pace, swaying clumsily on its soft springs. as the cars approach each other, james notices a fresh clearing at the side of the road at just about the point where they seem likely to pass. sure enough, when the cars are about thirty yards apart, the ford wanders over the center line. as the porsche approaches it, it seems to move back into its own lane, but then suddenly swerves again as though making a left turn. the porsche, in its turn, swerves to avoid the big american car but they collide, the immense chrome grill punching into the side of the fragile race car, crumpling it like a wad of tin foil and shunting it unceremoniously off the road into the clearing that has been prepared for it. as the porsche hobbles to a stop, vaughan seems to stand up on his seat and then throw himself out of the car, rolling over what's left of the front hood on to the ground. seagrave remains slumped in the driver's seat. vaughan lies still where he lands, a few feet ahead of the crumpled nose of the race car. the door of the ford opens and trask stumbles out. he begins to walk around in a dazed and agitated manner, and the crowd, which has been buzzing, goes silent again. trask walks away from the crash site and disappears into the shadows at the edge of the road.}
