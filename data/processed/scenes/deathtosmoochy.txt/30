<A>__{randolph sneaks into the prop room and shuts the door. he scurries over to the prop shelf and locates smoochy's multicolored "magic cookie bag." he opens it and tosses the cookies into the trash can. reaching into his pockets, he pulls out his special homemade cookies. he chuckles as he dumps them into the magic cookie bag.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{bon soir, la smoochy. welcome to fatty arbuckle land.}
<A>__{he cackles to himself. he then notices a box in the corner of the room. scribbled in magic marker on the side are the words: "rainbow randolph crap." he walks over and pulls the box out. he slowly opens the flaps. inside is his old costume. he pulls it out and clutches it lovingly. he smells it. the echoey sound of his theme song comes flooding back to him for a moment, along with the sound of children laughing.}
