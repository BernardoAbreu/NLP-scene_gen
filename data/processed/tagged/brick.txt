<A>__{brendan scans the rest of the cars. his eyes catch on laura dannon sitting in another convertible, off to the side. her bright eyes cut through the crowd, straight into brendan. he wags his eyebrows at her. she looks away. brendan walks into brad's direct line of view and obviously leans against one of the cars.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{hey! what are you doing here?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{listening.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{alright, you got me. i'm a scout for the gophers.}
<C>__{brad}
<P>__{(not amused)}
<D>__{oh yeah?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{of all things, yeah. been watching your game for a month, but that story just now clenched it. you've got heart, kid. how soon can you move to minneapolis?}
<A>__{a few snickers around the crowd, but nowhere near brad.}
<C>__{brad}
<P>__{(flat with anger)}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{cold winters, but they've got a great public transit system.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{oh yeah?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{there's a thesaurus in the library. 'yeah's under 'y'. go ahead, i will wait.}

<D>__{who invited you?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{to the parking lot? well gee i kind of invited myself.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{i think you'd better leave then.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{no, i'm having too good a time.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{just the same.}
<A>__{brendan smiles slightly, and very deliberately crosses his legs. brad's face tenses.}
<C>__{brad }
<D>__{maybe you want to go someplace more private.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{with you?}
<A>__{brad says 'who else?' by lifting his arms.}
<C>__{brendan }
<P>__{(as if he's been asked to the movies)}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{brendan stands and walks off. brad follows and the rest of the crowd trails after him. he leads them behind a parked vw van and turns to face brad. people gather around in a wide circle. brendan pulls his jacket off as brad hangs back, mumbling.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{you know what's good for you you'll just beat it. beating a small frye won't win me anything and it's not going to do you any good }
<A>__{laura pulls up in her convertible, behind brad, watching. in the next moment brendan cuts brad off by putting his fist in his face. brad grunts but doesn't lose ground. brendan throws his short stocky frame into brad's larger one and tenderizes his midsection with jabs. brad tags brendan in the ribs, then smacks the palm of his hand into brendan's face, shoving him back onto the pavement. he comes at brendan with his big fists clenched. brendan kicks brad full force in the shins. brad tumbles, and brendan comes up fast, connecting hard with the point of brad's chin. brad gets his balance fast, and before brendan can throw another he throws one himself, then another, both into brendan's stomach. brendan pulls back and kicks brad's shin where he had kicked it before. brad roars and hits brendan very hard in the face. brendan bounces back like a rubber ball and throws his weight into a square punch right into brad's nose. the sound of eggs breaking, and brad falls backwards like a board. he stays down, holding his face. brendan staggers back, breathing hard, and looks up at the small crowd. some stare at brendan, some at brad, but nobody seems about to do anything. brendan runs his sleeve over his face and walks unsteadily off, pushing past the last few people rushing over.}
<C>__{straggler}

<D>__{yeah.}

<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i want to help you.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{go away.}
<A>__{silence behind him. he stops, turns wearily. she looks genuinely hurt.}
<D>__{brendan (cont'd) (cont'd) look, i can't trust you. you ought to be smart enough to know that. i didn't shake the party up to get your attention, and i'm not heeling you to hook you. your connections could help me, but the bad baggage they bring could make it zero sum game or even hurt me, so i'm better off coming at it clean.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i wouldn't have to lead you in by the hand }
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i can't trust you. brad was a sap, you weren't, you were with him and so you were playing him, so you're a player. with you behind me i'd have to tie one eye up watching both your hands, and i can't spare it.}

<D>__{no, i'm not.}

<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{why? is brad the pin?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{brad's a sap. i downed him on his field and his crew didn't bite. so now i know he's a sap and anyone who acts like he isn't is profiting by it. that's not why i roughed him, though.}
<C>__{brain}
<D>__{for kicks?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{economics. brad's the school's biggest jake buyer, so if this pin is behind all the selling, i just got his attention. anyway, now's just shaking things out. look, you know a kid around the burgh, lanky, short, shaved head, turns a black tang?}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{i told you before i don't know the car. those types are a nickel a pound, but nobody i know that you don't. and trueman again }
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{keep him off. and keep your specs on i need to find that kid.}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{brendan hangs up and turns sluggishly. a lanky kid with a short shaved head and engineer boots punches him in the face. brendan hits the pavement. the lanky kid is over him in a split second, beating his face and body with short, heavy blows. flashes of the lanky kid a shiny scar shaped like a thin triangle runs down the side of his face. after a brief silent thrashing the kid walks off with several other blurry figures. a car peels out and roars off}

<C>__{trueman}
<D>__{what are you in?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{no. and no more of these informal chats if you've got a discipline issue with me write me up or suspend me and i will see you at the parent conference.}
<C>__{trueman}
<D>__{hold it, i could hold it could write you up for talking back to a vp. for looking at me in a threatening way. i'd exercise a little more tact, mr. frye. you can't pull a play like that unless i need you for something. so do i?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{trueman}
<D>__{so maybe you're gonna need me too.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{maybe. alright, i need you off my back completely for a few weeks. there might be some heat soon.}
<C>__{trueman}
<P>__{(interested)}

<A>__{trueman bites a thumbnail.}
<C>__{trueman}
<D>__{okay, here's what i can do. i won't pin you for anything you aren't caught at. i will ride it a little while, as long as it doesn't get too rough. but if anything comes up with your fingerprints on it, i can't help you. also, if i get to the end of whatever this is and it gets hot and you don't deliver, the veep will need someone to hand over, police wise. and i will have you. there better be some meat at the end of this like you say, or at least a fall guy, or you're it.}

<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{fourth period, nearly shook me upside down. can't say i didn't enjoy it, but why'd she come to me?}

<L>__{exterior parking lot late afternoon}
<A>__{the sun hangs low. brendan approaches the car and walks around it slowly. he peers inside. a tuft of paper pokes out from under the seat. he pulls the door handle, locked. brendan picks up a broken chunk of concrete from the ground, waddles over to the car and holds the chunk above his head, ready to drop it through the window. he stops. his eyes catch something in the distance. the lanky shaved head kid, whose name is tugger. coming towards him fast. brendan stands there for a moment, then lets the chunk fall to the ground. he casually leans against the car, removes his glasses, puts them in a hard case and puts the hard case in his pocket. tugger hits him like a train and throws him across the pavement. tug turns back to the car and takes out his keys. brendan gets up and comes towards tug, his face stiff. tug turns and pops him once squarely in the mouth. brendan falls to his knees. while tug unlocks the door brendan stands up woozily. grunting, tug spins and grabs brendan's jacket, pushing him back while he slaps him hard in the face, back and forth, three times. when tug lets go brendan drops like a stone, catching himself on his hands and knees. the car door slams. the mustang drives about a hundred yards out into the parking lot, spins around and stops, facing brendan. its motor purrs deeply. brendan begins to limp towards it doggedly, head up, eyes fixed. a crackling roar and short squeal of tires spit the mustang forward. it comes straight at brendan, rumbling like a tank. brendan stops walking and stands very still, eyes steady. the gap between him and the car closes in no time at all. it speeds past him not six inches to his left, brushing the edge of his jacket. brakes squeal behind him. brendan turns and lopes towards the mustang, idling about fifty feet away. he stops at the window. tugger eyes him curiously, with some respect.}
<C>__{brendan}

<L>__{interior trunk of moving mustang}
<A>__{brendan holds the trunk about three inches open, just enough to see which street signs pass by. loud music plays from the car "sweet baby james" by james taylor.1 the car zooms on. brendan's pov through the ajar trunk. the mustang slides to a stop beside an elaborate wooden mailbox carved as an eagle's head. brendan closes the trunk.}
<L>__{exterior front of house late afternoon}

<A>__{tug points, amused. brendan heaves himself up, and tug shoves him back down. brendan winks at him, stands and lurches towards the door again. tugger grabs his shirt and slams him into the wall, but freezes when he hears a door latch click. sneering, he drops brendan back onto the mattress and sits against the opposite wall. sounds of a door opening and closing come from the darkness. light footsteps clack on the cement floor. suddenly tug vanishes the room's darkness just seems to swallow him. the thin whispery voice of the pin speaks softly.}

<D>__{laura (cont'd) (cont'd) i'm on the in, top level of the tower and i know everyone, but i don't know all what goes on. i knew em when she tried to get with me and brad, and i liked her. she was smart. but she wasn't us, and it didn't work. when she left she took some souvenirs, dirty habits she wasn't strong enough to control and a connection to the pin to keep them going. with me?}

<D>__{this all helps but it's not what i asked. what's your angle in all this?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i don't know. i'm usually pretty sharp, but... maybe i see what you're doing for emily, trying to help her. and i don't know anyone who would do that for me.}

"twelve thirty pico & alexander". he fishes the old note out and compares them different handwriting. the locker cage is now empty and silent, except for the steady sound of heavy footfalls. brendan looks up from the notes. a lug with a lumpish face is coming towards him. he wears a black trenchcoat over bulbous shoulders, and his black hair comes down over his eyes like a sheepdog's.}

<C>__{brendan }
<D>__{so what's his answer?}
<A>__{closer, not slowing. brendan tightens his hand into a fist. then click! and a long slender switchblade gleams in the lug's right paw. brendan jumps back as the lug swipes the blade at his torso. before the lug winds up for another slash brendan is running.}

<A>__{he pulls the gun. brendan shouts and throws himself on tug's arm, wrenching it sideways. the gun clunks onto the carpet. the pin flips tug over and for a moment brendan is caught between them, hit and torn, rolling over the gun. tug grabs it, brendan grabs his wrist and the gun goes off, firing into the ceiling. plaster sprays. brendan screams, thrashing wildly, and manages to slip out of his bloodied jacket and out from between the two. the pin is on top, pinning tug's gun hand to the carpet, straining to keep it there. brendan leaps to his feet, staggers, then winds up and kicks tug in the wrist with all his strength. a terrible crunching popping sound. tug roars. brendan takes the gun from his limp hand.}

<A>__{brendan's face is frozen in an ambiguous frown.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{tug tried to shoot his way out when the police got there. they tied him to dode, too. same gun. and the girl.}

<D>__{well good thing you weren't there.}

<D>__{yeah.}

<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you think the girl was emily?}

<D>__{probably.}

<D>__{you loved her.}

<D>__{you did all this cause you loved her. and now it's finished.}

<D>__{no.}
<A>__{laura pulls back, looks at his face. it is a mask.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{no, it's not finished. tug pulled the trigger on em and he got the fall, but the bulls coulda found that out without me.}
<A>__{laura pulls back more.}
<C>__{brendan }
<D>__{i set out to know who put her in the spot, who put her in front of the gun. that was you, angel.}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(drifting back further)}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{it was you. what, you want the whole tale? you want me to tell it to you?}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(bewildered)}
<D>__{tell it to me.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{alright, from the top. you had your fingers in brad bramish for appearances and to keep him buying from the pin, who you were hooked with. emily came to you and brad, you saw her for what she was, an insecure little girl trying to get in. she goes on the backburner. meanwhile maybe you're getting bored, maybe just greedy, so when the pin scores big with the bricks you take your shot. you hook one, take half, and cut it back to size, but you cut it bad. maybe accidentally, maybe to down the pin's operation, doesn't matter. you put it back, but poor frisco doses off it and lands in a coma.}
<P>__{(voice strengthening)}
<D>__{so now the pin's fuming, maybe he's jealous of brad, so he comes to brad's crowd looking for blood, or at least a scape. you know trouble. there's going to be a war over this. and there's emily. she trusts you. she wants in. it's duck soup.}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(murmurs)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{you frame her for the bad brick, then you cut her loose. you turn on your heel and bite her in the throat. last week on the payphone, pico and alexander, she saw something she was scared of. tug's car driving by, the pin driving, but she wouldn't have seen the pin. no, she was across the street, angel. she saw the passenger side. she saw you. she saw you and ran like she saw some devil.}
<A>__{laura's face is very still, quivering.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{brendan, why are you }
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{and she took the hit. dode hid her away, but the pin was on to her, tracked her down, told her to meet him, that they would make good. gave her a time, and a place. and sent tug. just to get the straight. but maybe you had talked tug up, or maybe he just blew a fuse, but em sprung it on him that she had her kid, and he did what anyone could count on tug doing he hit her. she took the hit for you. you let her take it.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{stop it!}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{that's the tale.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{stop it!}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{you're going to tell me it's not?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{it's not!}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{look at me.}
<A>__{she crumples against him, looking him straight in the eye.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you know me. i've only helped you. how can you it isn't true!}
<A>__{she sobs through a tensed, straight face. brendan holds her stare, but his eyes are distant.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i hope it isn't. i want you to have been on my side all along, not just trying to get me under your thumb like brad and the pin and tug.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{no }
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{but i think you knew that meeting was going to blow up. i think that was your final play. but i hope i'm wrong. i hope everything i wrote in the note i dropped at gary trueman's office this morning is wrong. about your and brad's involvement in the pin's runnings. i hope you didn't steal the brick last night. in your purse.}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(breathes)}
<D>__{i didn't.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{that's good. that means you didn't let me walk into a slaughterhouse. you didn't lead tug and the pin and their crews to the slaughter. and when trueman reads the note, takes my cue and searches your locker, he won't find a damn thing.}
<A>__{something changes in laura's eyes.}
<L>__{exterior locker cage insert}

<D>__{brendan... don't...}
<C>__{brendan}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{it's done.}
<A>__{her face does strange things, subtle contortions. she watches his eyes. he doesn't look at her. her voice shakes.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{done. well. that's most of it. 9 out of 10. i told em to tell tug it was his. told her it would soften him up. she said she wished she could keep it, but she didn't love the father. i was going to drive her down the next day, we'd found a doctor. most wouldn't. she was starting to show. 3 months. you know whose kid that makes it, or have you known all along?}
<A>__{slowly, steadily, she straightens up. her figure takes back some dignity. she steps towards him deliberately. closer. right up against him. she brings her head to his, puts her lips to his ear, breathes warm breath, and says two words. the first is}

<D>__{mother }
<A>__{the second is low, guttural and lost to the whistling wind. she turns and walks briskly away. brendan watches her go across the dark, barren field of asphalt. metal jangles. brendan turns to see the brain hopping a chain link fence. brendan turns his eyes back on laura.}

<D>__{you get your straight?}

<D>__{yeah. i wouldn't have }
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{s'alright.}

<D>__{yeah, well. chuck burns came to. the knife guy. spilled it all to the bulls, guess brad bramish hired him. on his own, just a grudge thing.}
