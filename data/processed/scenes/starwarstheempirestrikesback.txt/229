<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{i thought that hairy beast would be the end of me. of course, i've looked better.}
<A>__{artoo beeps understandingly.}

<A>__{the millennium falcon lifts gracefully into the twilight sky and roars away from the city. troops fire after it and tie fighters take off in pursuit.}
<L>__{interior gantry outside control room reactor shaft}
<A>__{luke moves along the railing and up to the control room. vader lunges at him and luke immediately raises his lit sword to meet vader's. sparks fly as they duel, vader gradually forcing luke backward toward the gantry.}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{you are beaten. it is useless to resist. don't let yourself be destroyed as obi wan did.}
<A>__{luke answers by rolling sideways and thrusting his sword at vader so viciously that he nicks vader on the shoulder. the black armor sparks and smokes and vader seems to be hurt, but immediately recovers. luke backs off along the narrow end of the gantry as vader comes at him, slashing at the young jedi with his sword. luke makes a quick move around the instrument complex attached to the end of the gantry. vader's sword comes slashing down, cutting the complex loose; it begins to fall, then is caught by the rising wind and blown upward. luke glances at the instrument complex floating away. at that instant, vader's sword comes down across luke's right forearm, cutting off his hand and sending his sword flying. in great pain, luke squeezes his forearm under his left armpit and moves back along the gantry to its extreme end. vader follows. the wind subsides. luke holds on. there is nowhere else to go.}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{there is no escape. don't make me destroy you. you do not yet realize your importance. you have only begun to discover your power. join me and i will complete your training. with our combined strength, we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i will never join you!}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{if you only knew the power of the dark side. obi wan never told you what happened to your father.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{he told me enough! it was you who killed him.}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{no. i am your father.}
<A>__{shocked, luke looks at vader in utter disbelief.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no. no. that's not true! that's impossible!}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{search your feelings. you know it to be true.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no! no! no!}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{luke. you can destroy the emperor. he has foreseen this. it is your destiny. join me, and together we can rule the galaxy as father and son. come with me. it is the only way.}
<A>__{vader puts away his sword and holds his hand out to luke. a calm comes over luke, and he makes a decision. in the next instant he steps off the gantry platform into space. the dark lord looks over the platform and sees luke falling far below. the wind begins to blow at vader's cape and the torrent finally forces him back, away from the edge. the wind soon fades and the wounded jedi begins to drop fast, unable to grab onto anything to break his fall.}
