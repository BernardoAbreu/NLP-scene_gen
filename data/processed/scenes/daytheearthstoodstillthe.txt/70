<A>__{bobby watches as klaatu walks to the blackboard and picks up a piece of chalk. as though correcting a schoolboy's work, he makes large check marks at several points in each equation.}
<L>__{exterior porch barnhardt's house}
<A>__{an efficient looking middle aged woman is mounting the steps to the entrance, getting her front door key out of her purse, when her eye falls on the french doors, which are standing ajar. puzzled, she starts down the porch toward the doors. this woman is barnhardt's secretary and her name is hilda. bobby is watching as klaatu writes across the blackboard in a bold hand: differentiate the equation ( ). klaatu underlines this comment with a sharp stroke, when a stern voice is heard off screen.}
<C>__{hilda's voice}
<D>__{what are you doing in here?}
<B>__{full shot}
<A>__{as klaatu and bobby turn in surprise. standing in the open french doors is hilda, eyeing them with stern suspicion.}
<C>__{hilda}
<P>__{(outraged by klaatu's}
<D>__{desecration of the}
<P>__{sacred blackboard)}
<D>__{how dare you write on that blackboard!}
<P>__{(klaatu eyes her mildly)}
<D>__{do you realize the professor has been working on that problem for weeks?}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(pleasantly)}
<D>__{he'll catch on to it in no time now.}
<C>__{hilda}
<P>__{(controlling herself with an effort)}
<D>__{how did you get in here? and what do you want?}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{we came to see professor barnhardt.}
<C>__{hilda}
<D>__{well, he's not here. and he won't be back till this evening.}
<P>__{(sternly)}
<D>__{i think you'd better leave now. unruffled, klaatu turns to the desk and scribbles something on a scratch pad. he tears off the piece of paper and hands it to hilda.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{you might keep this.}
<P>__{(with easy assurance)}
<D>__{i think the professor will want to get in touch with me.}
<A>__{with a polite nod he goes out the french doors, followed by bobby. hilda eyes the door for a moment, then glances down at the paper in her hand, disturbed and puzzled by this stranger. her glance wanders to the blackboard and she picks up an eraser, debating whether to erase klaatu's corrections. at that moment the french door opens and klaatu sticks his head in. startled, hilda drops the eraser.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(pointing to the blackboard)}
<D>__{i wouldn't erase that. the professor needs it very badly.}
<A>__{and he disappears, leaving hilda to glare after him in impotent rage. deciding that this man is either a crackpot or a menace, she goes to the telephone on the desk and starts dialing a number.}
