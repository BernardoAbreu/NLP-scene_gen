<D>__{in the past, i have permitted myself to be used to make sweeping indictments of all white people, and these generalizations have caused injuries to some white folks who did not deserve them. because of the spiritual rebirth which i was blessed to undergo as a result of my pilgrimage to the holy city of mecca, i no longer subscribe to sweeping indictments of one race. i intend to be careful not to sentence anyone who has not been proven guilty. i'm not a racist and do not subscribe to any of the tenets of racism. in all honesty and sincerity it can be stated that i wish nothing but freedom, justice and equality: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness for all people.}
