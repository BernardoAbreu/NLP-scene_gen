<L>__{exterior haymaking (kashin) night}
<A>__{night under the stars. some of the men have gone, some have settled in for the night. the cooking fire is burning out. levin remains where he was, watching, thinking: drawn to "the simple life."}
<L>__{exterior haymaking (kashin) dawn}
<A>__{levin wakes . . . woken by hoofbeats and the jingle of harness. levin sees a coach coming towards him. the coach comes nearer, leather boxes strapped to the roof. levin sees that a young woman is looking out of the side window, holding on to the white ribbons of her bonnet. he sees that it is kitty, on her way to ergoshovo. (princess shcherbatsky is also inside, dozing.) the coach passes on, leaving levin lovelorn, the dawn light on him. the sight of kitty has turned him round again.}
