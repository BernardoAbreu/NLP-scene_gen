<L>__{interior ozim's barber shop. kitchen night}
<D>__{we cut close to an ancient looking hair dryer from the shop downstairs being trained onto a human hand with a large eagle tattoo. we pull wide to reveal the full, gruesome scene. nikolai has the body of soyka laid out on a surface, his head still bound up in a bin bag, his lower portions bound up similarly. nikolai is de frosting soyka's left hand with the hair dryer, concentrating on his ring finger which has a gold ring on it. the parts of soyka's shirt and jacket which are visible are crusted with frozen blood. nikolai is wearing rubber gloves. as he dries, nikolai takes a sip of coffee. ozim is watching this scene with horror. kirill has his arms folded, mightily impressed. finally the hand is thawed enough for nikolai to remove the gold ring. he studies an inscription and then offers it to ozim. ozim shakes his head as if the thing were a contagion. nikolai shrugs and pockets it. he then turns the hair dryer back on and blows some hot air onto the crisply bloody chest of soyka. he tugs at the frozen lapel of the jacket and blows air into the inside pocket. within a few moments he is able to remove soyka's glistening, thawing wallet which is caked in frozen blood. he opens it (we glimpse a photo of a wife and children) and blows hot air onto the money inside. he tugs a wad of frozen bank notes from the wallet, all stuck together by drops of frozen blood. he offers this money to ozim as well but ozim shakes his head vigorously. kirill hoots with laughter. ozim is now staring at nikolai as if he were a devil from hell. nikolai grabs a plastic bag and puts the money inside it, then pockets the frozen wad. he tosses the rest of the frozen wallet to ozim, who instinctively catches it.}

<D>__{you'd better burn that. ozim, reacting to the cold of the wallet and to the horror of it, drops the thing on the floor. nikolai looks at ozim as if he were a complete amateur.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{did you finish cutting his hair? ozim can't answer.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{i just thought you might want six fifty out of his pockets. kirill laughs. nikolai takes a deep breath to prepare himself.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{ok, now i'm going to do his teeth and cut off his fingers.}
<P>__{(to ozim)}
<D>__{you might want to leave the room. ozim thinks, decides, leaves fast. a pause.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{you too, kirill. kirill smiles and pats nikolai on the cheek. kirill leaves. nikolai is left alone. his hand shakes a little as he picks up his cup of coffee.}
