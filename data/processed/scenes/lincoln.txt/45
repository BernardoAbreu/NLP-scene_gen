<L>__{interior the white house kitchen evening}
<A>__{the kitchen's piled with unwashed cookware, eggshells, flour bins, muffin and pastry molds, spoons and knives, the detritus of the preparations for the finger food served at the reception, which has now transitioned into a dance and is still underway upstairs. music, the tramp of dancing feet and rhythmic clapping is audible. a black footman carrying a huge tray laden with dishes and cups comes down the stairs. he hastily beats a retreat when he sees lincoln and thaddeus stevens quietly talking amid the mess.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<A>__{since we have the floor next in the debate, i thought i'd suggest you might...temper your contributions so as not to frighten our conservative friends?}
<C>__{thaddeus stevens}
<A>__{ashley insists you're ensuring approval by dispensing patronage to otherwise undeserving democrats.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<A>__{i can't ensure a single damn thing if you scare the whole house with talk of land appropriations and revolutionary tribunals and punitive thisses and thats }
<C>__{thaddeus stevens}
<A>__{when the war ends, i intend to push for full equality, the negro vote and much more. congress shall mandate the seizure of every foot of rebel land and every dollar of their property. we'll use their confiscated wealth to establish hundreds of thousands of free negro farmers, and at their side soldiers armed to occupy and transform the heritage of traitors. we'll build up a land down there of free men and free women and free children and freedom. the nation needs to know that we have such plans.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<A>__{that's the untempered version of reconstruction. it's not... it's not exactly what i intend, but we shall oppose one another in the course of time. now we're working together, and i'm asking you }
<C>__{thaddeus stevens}
<A>__{for patience, i expect.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<A>__{when the people disagree, bringing them together requires going slow till they're ready to make up }
<C>__{thaddeus stevens}
<D>__{ah, shit on the people and what they want and what they're ready for! i don't give a goddamn about the people and what they want! this is the face of someone who has fought long and hard for the good of the people without caring much for any of `em. and i look a lot worse without the wig. the people elected me! to represent them! to lead them! and i lead! you ought to try it!}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i admire your zeal, mr. stevens, and i have tried to profit from the example of it. but if i'd listened to you, i'd've declared every slave free the minute the first shell struck fort sumter; then the border states would've gone over to the confederacy, the war would've been lost and the union along with it, and instead of abolishing slavery, as we hope to do, in two weeks, we'd be watching helpless as infants as it spread from the american south into south america.}
<A>__{stevens glares at him, then smiles.}
<C>__{thaddeus stevens}
<D>__{oh, how you have longed to say that to me. you claim you trust them but you know what the people are. you know that the inner compass that should direct the soul toward justice has ossified in white men and women, north and south, unto utter uselessness through tolerating the evil of slavery. white people cannot bear the thought of sharing this country's infinite abundance with negroes.}
<A>__{lincoln reaches over to stevens and gives his shoulder a vigorous shake. stevens endures this.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{a compass, i learnt when i was surveying, it'll it'll point you true north from where you're standing, but it's got no advice about the swamps and deserts and chasms that you'll encounter along the way. if in pursuit of your destination you plunge ahead, heedless of obstacles, and achieve nothing more than to sink in a swamp, what's the use of knowing true north?}
