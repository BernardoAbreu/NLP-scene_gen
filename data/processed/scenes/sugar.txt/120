<L>__{exterior bridgetown swing ball park day}
<A>__{a batter swings and misses for strike three. the catcher throws the ball around the horn. miguel steps off the mound, grabs the rosin bag for traction, gets the ball back. his next pitch is hit on the ground toward the first base line, where the first baseman makes a nice back handed play... miguel sprints over to cover the bag, receives the toss, but... ouch! ...the runner storms into miguel before he has time to pull his foot off the bag, knocking them both hard to the ground. the runner is called out, but miguel is slow getting to his feet. stu and the trainer run out to check on him. jorge rushes over from third, and orlando also comes to help translate.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{nice play, kid. how's your foot?}
<C>__{jorge}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{miguel nods, but he's limping back to the mound.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{take it easy. don't force it. how's it feel?}
<C>__{orlando}
<P>__{(translating)}
<D>__{don't push it. does it hurt?}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{i'm okay.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{let him toss a few warm ups.}
<A>__{the umpire grants miguel a few "test" pitches. visibly shaken, miguel sets up for a warm up pitch, breathes deeply, and delivers. he lands gingerly on his right ankle, makes a face. stu and the trainer exchange glances. miguel notices this, as he sets up for another pitch. the trainer shakes his head, no.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{all right, kid. give it a rest.}
<A>__{as stu reaches for the ball, miguel pulls it away.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{i am okay. please.}
<A>__{stu and the trainer sense miguel's anxiety. stu puts his arm on miguel's shoulder for comfort.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{you're okay, i know, but let's just be sure... give me the ball, son.}
<A>__{miguel sizes them up, reluctantly hands the ball over, and limps off the field with stu and the other players looking after.}
