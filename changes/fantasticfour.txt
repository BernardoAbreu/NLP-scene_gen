Empty cars BLOW in a chain-reaction.  The flames are mushrooming! Reed SWIPES his ARMS OUT, holding people back.  His arms FLATTEN to form a barricade -- FACES INDENT his skin. FLAMES lash out.  A pack of attractive YOUNG WOMEN scream. Johnny LEAPS toward them.  His feet LEAVE THE GROUND, giving him extra lift.  He SPINS, lands, and embraces the women, SHIELDING them from flames which burn up his back.  He looks the ladies up and down, and gives a cheesy smile. Sue SCREAMS.  She puts her hands up (a normal reflex).  The air seems to RIPPLE around her hands, like FORCE-FIELDS. She looks at them, surprised, confused.  Her invisible fields SPIRAL OUT, partially CONTAINING the blast.  But the flames hurtle closer.  She fights the pressure.  Blood trickles from her nose.  Just as the white hot blast is about to hit her... Sue is dressed again.  Visible.  She SCREAMS, and PUSHES THE FORCE DOWN INTO THE ROAD!  She collapses, as the blast deflects off the street and into... An oncoming FIRETRUCK!  BOOOOM!  The firetruck is KNOCKED OFF THE GROUND, SLEWING SIDEWAYS.  Brakes scream.  Its tail slashes out, PUNCHING through the guard-rail. THE BACK OF THE TRUCK DANGLES OUT, HUNDREDS OF FEET ABOVE THE WATER!  FIREMEN hang off the back and sides.  The truck TEETERS, falling!  Ben wastes no time.  He GRABS onto the front of the truck, just as it goes off the side! He DIGS his heels into the ground, but his feet DRAG across the concrete, digging grooves into the street. ON THE DANGLING FIRETRUCK: FIREMEN climb out, clawing toward the bridge.  Their truck SWINGS.  Bits and pieces tumble down at them -- a hose, an axe, a helmet.  All deadly now.  The HANGING LADDER swoops down, with men RIDING ON IT! Ben SCREAMS!  STRAINING with all his might.  Ben SCREAMS! His muscles ripple, and...he takes his first step...back. Another scream.  Another step.  Another.  Another.  Epic, painful. He is pulling the truck back onto the bridge, inch by inch. His footsteps THUD.  With monumental effort, he levels the truck.  Firemen scurry over hoses and ladders, some climbing over Ben. Reed tends to Sue who has fainted from her effort.  Ben steps back from the truck and slumps to the street exhausted.  Wary cops close in to cover him with weapons, but... The FIREMEN slowly begin to APPLAUD.  The crowd of onlookers joins in as well.  Sue, Reed, and Johnny seem surprised, touched by the reaction.  But Ben seems uncomfortable. Firemen step forward to offer Reed a couple of their coats; he hands one to Johnny and uses the other to cover Sue.}

<ACTION>__{She turns VISIBLE, holding back the pole with a FORCEFIELD. Using her power, she FLINGS the pole from Doom's grip.  It skids along the street.  Reed helps Ben to his feet. Doom turns to these three wounded soldiers.}

<DIAL>__{This is going to be fun.}
<ACTION>__{Electricity starts to course through his body.  He stands at the foot of the crater Ben made.  He THRUSTS down, grabbing a thick POWER CABLE, RIPPING it out of the street! He SNAPS the cable into two snaking, lashing strips.  He holds tight, ABSORBING the power.  Lights FLICKER and DIM in buildings around him.  Windows BLOW!  Doom GLOWS, amped up. He LETS GO of the cables!  The two deadly wires SNAKE out of control!  PEDESTRIANS scatter, panic.  Reed sees the wires SLASHING through the air.  He makes a move: Reed STREEETCHES HIS ARMS, reaching for the deadly cables. Doom FIRES superpowered ENERGY BOLTS.  The electric charges surge through the air toward the Fantastic Four, but -- Sue TOSSES her FORCE-FIELDS, exploding Doom's blasts in mid- flight.  She keeps her hands up, BLOCKING blows like a prize fighter.  One of Doom's BOLTS glances off her force-field and -- SMASHES into a concrete stanchion of a BUILDING!  The pillar starts to crumble, with PEOPLE huddled under the overhang! They're about to be CRUSHED by the falling concrete!  But -- Suddenly, the concrete roof HOLDS STEADY...because...BEN is holding it up!  He stands beside the stanchion, like Atlas holding the world.  People run out, safe. ON THE STREET: Reed finally grabs both ends of the wire.}

<DIAL>__{JOHNNY!  SPOT-WELD!}
<ACTION>__{Johnny FLIES toward him, and uses his flames to WELD the wires back together.  Sparks fly.  The cables start to FUSE. Doom keeps FIRING.  Sue struggles with her force-fields.  The impact is too much.  Her nose starts to bleed.}

<DIAL>__{Can't...hold...on...}
<ACTION>__{Doom smiles.  Reed sees her.  She is about to drop her hands, vulnerable, but..............REED STRETCHES HIS WHOLE BODY! He EXPANDS himself across the street, and GRABS a TREE, so he forms a WALL between Sue and Doom. Doom keeps FIRING his bolts.  They SLAM into Reed's body, RUBBERBAND his skin, and DISTEND OUT his back without breaking.  He strains, agonizing.}

<DIAL>__{I'm sure I can come up with something.}
<ACTION>__{She concentrates.  She sees Johnny holding onto Doom -- and the GROWING HEAT and LIGHT. Sue shuts her eyes.  A GIANT FORCE FIELD EXPLODES FROM HER BODY.  A massive WAVE OF ENERGY.  It SWOOPS past a car, which WARPS, MELTS (half the car is not inside the force-field). Thing turns to the crowd, extending his arm, blocking them. Sue's force-field ENVELOPS JOHNNY'S SUPERNOVA, containing it in a BRIGHT SPHERE OF ENERGY.  The light increases, to the point that it's blinding.  People look away. Finally, Johnny's supernova fades.  He collapses to the ground, exhausted, smoking.  Sue exhales and falls to her knees.  Her force field fades.  The light flickers out.  As everyone's eyes adjust, we hear...THUD.  THUD.  And -- DOOM steps through the smoke.  Unharmed.  His metallic body GLOWS WHITE, TRAILING MOLTEN METAL.  Sue, Ben, Johnny look devastated.  They can't beat him.  He looks at Reed.}

<CHAR>__{DOOM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No.}
<ACTION>__{Doom RUSHES TOWARD Reed, but the WATER FLIES OUT, DOUSING DOOM.  GIANT CLOUDS OF STEAM fill the air from the cooling metal.  DOOM screams.  His shrieks finally fade to SILENCE. The water stops, thick steam clouds roll, completely obscuring Doom from view.  A beat.  The steam clears to reveal: DOOM.  A true statue now -- a hard, cold solid piece of METAL.  Frozen forever.  Reed, Sue, Ben, and Johnny -- The Fantastic Four -- exhale.  They stand as one, in roiling smoke.  A beat.}
