<D>__{in 1883 i suffered such a spell and decided to cease feeding on blood. just lie in the earth and let time return to its natural state...}
<A>__{as the wind picks up, the leaves of a fledgling vine growing up the side of the tomb begin to rattle faster and faster, until curiously, time seems to speed up. night passes to day and back to night. shadows from the sun and moon drift across the tomb. as days and months fly by, the vine winds and grows in circuitous patterns all around the tomb.}

<D>__{i had hoped the sounds of the passing eras would fade out, and a kind of death might happen. a kind of forgetting where i would be healed from my wounds.}
