<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah, i'm going to skip down the hill, take care of a few things, pick up some clothes...}

<D>__{could you be back for dinner, around 7:00?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah. sure.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{she waves to him and pulls the rest of the way out of the garage, revealing the ax handle still embedded in the front of the car, its handle sharply angled up from the hood like a soup ladle. (note: harry steps toward the car. h: "let me pull that thing out of the hood for you." j: "later, i don't have time right now.") she blows him a kiss. then moves down the driveway toward the gates. he stands watching until her car disappears. then he moves to front door of the house and finds it locked.}
