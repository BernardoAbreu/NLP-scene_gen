<L>__{exterior farmer house day}
<A>__{total disrepair: peeling paint, broken steps, fallen shingles... this house is easing slowly back to nature...}
<L>__{interior farmer house living room day}
<A>__{neglect is just as evident inside. dust, faded rugs, torn yellow curtains. lillian sits on the couch staring out a window. she has aged and looks tiny, frail, with no trace of her old formidability. the scrapbook is open on her lap.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{what was i saying? oh yes, it was the communists that did it to frances.}
<A>__{ernest is hunched in a chair by the stone fireplace. four reporters crouch on the floor, totally bored. yesterday's headlines are now old news.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{they capture the mind by first seducing the heart. i suppose i never taught frances to close her heart...}
<A>__{two reporters rise and edge toward the door.}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{uh... excuse us, mrs. farmer. we're going to have to... uh...}
<C>__{third reporter}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{yeah, i better pack it in too.}
<C>__{lillian}
<P>__{(distractedly)}
<D>__{pardon? oh, would you like more lemonade?}
<A>__{the last reporter gets to his feet.}
<C>__{fourth reporter}
<P>__{(kindly)}
<D>__{i think we've had enough. thank you, mrs. farmer. goodbye.}
<A>__{he follows the others out. lillian climbs wearily to her feet and goes to the window, looks out. ernest stares into the fire.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{you know, ernie, i think we should have frances' room repainted for when she comes home. that'll brighten her day.}
<A>__{ernest looks at her wearily, as if she is stark raving mad. he knows damn well frances isn't coming home...}
