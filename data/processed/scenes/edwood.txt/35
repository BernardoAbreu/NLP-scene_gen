<L>__{exterior bela's rouse night}
<A>__{it's halloween night. children in trick or treating costumes parade up and down the streets. through bela's window, we see him and ed watching television a small fuzzy screen in a huge console.}
<L>__{interior bela's house same time}
<A>__{on the tv, one of bela's old '30s horror films plays. bela's evil character is hypnotizing somebody: his eyes stare the famous stare, then his hand does the famous hypnotic gesture.}
<B>__{on ed and bela}
<A>__{they are entranced. the men drink beers in silence. bela's two dogs lie at his feet.}
<B>__{on the tv}
<A>__{the old movie suddenly stops, and vampira appears on the tv screen. vampira, 25, is the sexy "creature feature" hostess, a pale ghoul slipped into a tight black dress. she leers in front of a corny fog shrouded set. there is a pumpkin, a broomstick, and a sign reading "happy halloween."}
<C>__{vampira }
<D>__{ooo! those eyes! he gives me the willies! the only thing scarier than him is this guy i dated last week: charlie from pittsburgh. boy, talk about the living dead...}
<B>__{on the men}
<A>__{ed is disgruntled.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{ugh! i hate the way she interrupts the pictures. she doesn't show 'em the proper respect.}
<C>__{bela}
<P>__{(glued to the tv)}
<D>__{i think she's a honey. look at those jugs.}
<A>__{ed laughs. bela waves his arm and starts doing his hypnotic hand gesture at the tv.}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{vampira! you will come under my spell! you will be my slave of love.}
<C>__{ed}
<P>__{(fascinated by bela's hand)}
<D>__{hey bela, how do you do that?}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{you must be double jointed, and you must be hungarian.}
<P>__{(back at the tv)}
<D>__{vampira, look at me! stare into my eyes.}
<A>__{ed joins bela in this activity. the two of them wave their arms spookily at the tv. bela becomes fatigued.}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{i am getting tired. i need to take my medicine.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{do you want me to get it for you?}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{no thank you, eddie. i will be alright.}
<A>__{bela smiles. he gets up, shuffles across the room, and steps behind a curtain . ed is puzzled. bela's thin arm appears and draws the curtain tight. we hear mysterious clanging, drawers opening and closing, and then silence. ed sits, waiting. behind the curtain, something drops. we hear a muffled "shit!" ed is getting worried. but then the curtain whips open, and bela bounds out, grinning. he's a bundle of energy.}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{i feel better now.}
<B>__{at the door}
<A>__{the doorbell rings. kids shout "trick or treat!" bela jumps up gleefully.}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{children! i love children.}
<A>__{bela puts on his famous cape, then gets a pair of fangs and sticks them in his mouth.}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{little kids in lone ranger and howdy doody costumes giggle expectantly. suddenly the door flies open, and standing there is count dracula! the real count dracula. yeowwww!!! the kids scream and run. bela chuckles. every kid is gone... except one tough boy.}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{aren't you scared, little boy? i'm going to drink your blood!}
<C>__{tough boy}
<D>__{ehh, you're not a real vampire. you can't turn into a bat, and those teeth don't frighten me.}
<A>__{suddenly ed lurches out, menacingly.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{well how about these teeth ?!!}
<A>__{ed rips his teeth out of his head and thrusts them at the kid. the boy screams in terror and races away. bela is wowed.}
<C>__{bela}
<D>__{hey, how'd you do that?}
<A>__{ed smiles impishly, then sticks the teeth back in his mouth.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{dentures. i lost my pearlies in the war.}
