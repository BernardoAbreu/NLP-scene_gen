<L>__{interior ranch cottage morning}
<A>__{sissy stirs in a nicely appointed guest cottage. a maid knocks on the door and serves sissy breakfast in bed.}
<C>__{maid}
<D>__{excuse me, miss. do you care for your breakfast now?}
<A>__{sissy sits up and rubs her eyes.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{yeah. i feel a bit hungry.}
<A>__{the maid puts the tray down, and the cloth that covers the food is lifted away to reveal a shocking display of grease and calories. a vase of prairie asters stands over a double meat cheeseburger, a package of hostess twinkies, a cold can of dr. pepper and a three musketeers bar. sissy is delighted.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{road food. how did you know?}
<C>__{maid}
<D>__{well it is a change of our usual grapefruit and melba toast, i'm sure.}
<A>__{sissy notices a card. it reads:}
<D>__{compliments of bonanza jellybean}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{bonanza jellybean....}
<C>__{maid}
<D>__{she will be up to see you directly.}
<A>__{sissy devours her meal. out her window she can see women on exercycles, women doing jumping jacks and women in beauty parlors. a fist pounds on sissy's door. in sails jelly, a cowgirl so cute she makes sissy blush just to look at her. she wears a tan stetson with an aster pinned to it, a green satin shirt embroidered with rearing stallions snorting orange fire from their nostrils. her breasts bounce like dinner rolls that have gotten loaded on helium and, between red tinged cheeks, where more baby fat is taking its time maturing, she has a little smile that can cause minerals and plastics to remember their ancient animate connections. jelly grasps sissy's elbow and sits on the side of the bed.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{welcome, podner. by god, it's great to have you here. it's an honor. sorry i took so long getting to you, but we've had a mess of hard work these past few days and a heap of planning to do.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{er, you seem to know who i am, and maybe even what i am. thanks for the breakfast.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{oh, i know about sissy hankshaw, all right. i've done a little hitchhiking myself. ah shucks, that's like telling annie oakley you're a sharpshooter because you once knocked a tomato can off a stump with a fieldstone. i'd heard tales about you from people i'd meet in jail cells and truckstops. i heard about your, uh, your, ah, your wonderful thumbs, and i heard how you were jack kerouac's girl friend...}
<A>__{sissy sets her tray on the bedside table.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{no, i'm afraid that part isn't true. jack was in awe of me and tracked me down. we spent a night talking and hugging in a corn field, but he was hardly my lover. besides, i always travel alone.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{well, that doesn't matter; that part never interested me anyway. the beatnicks were before my time, and i never got anything outta the hippies but bad dope, cliches and the clap. but the example of your life helped me in my struggle to be a cowgirl.}
<A>__{the guests are huffing and puffing in between the pauses in conversation, in the background through the window in sissy's room.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{tell me about it.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{about...}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{about being a cowgirl. what's it all about? when you say the word you make it sound like it was painted in radium on the side of a pearl.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{cowgirls exist as an image. a fairly common image. the idea of cowgirls especially for little girls prevails in our culture. therefore, it seems to me, the existence of cowgirls should prevail. otherwise, they're being fooled. in the rodeo hall of fame in oklahoma city there are just two cowgirls. two. and both of 'em are trick riders. trick riding is what cowgirls have almost always done in rodeos. our society sure likes to see its unconventional women do tricks. that's what prostitutes call it, you know: 'tricking.'}
<A>__{jelly lays her hand atop the oval mound sissy's thumb makes under the covers.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{you're political, then?}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{no, ma'am. no way. there's girls on the rubber rose who are political, but i don't share their views. i got no cowgirl ideology to expound. "politics is for people who have a passion for changing life but lack a passion for living it."}
<A>__{there is a moment when the two girls feel something between each other.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{did that last comment sound too profound to be coming outta my mouth? it's not original. it's something i picked up from the chink.}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{really? the chink, huh? i've gathered that you sometimes speak with him. what else have you learned from the chink?}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{learned from the chink? oh my. ha ha. that's hard to say. we mostly.... uh, a lot of his talk is pretty goofy.}
<A>__{jelly pauses.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{oh yeah, now that i think of it, the chink taught me something about cowgirls. did you realize that cowgirls have been around for many centuries? long before america. in ancient india the care of the cattle was always left up to young women they called gopis. being alone with the cows all the time, the gopis got awfully horny, just like we do here. every gopi was in love with krishna, a good looking young god who played the flute like it was going out of style when the moon was full, this krishna would play his flute by a river and call the gopis to him. then he would multiply himself sixteen thousand times one for each gopi and make love to each one the way she most desired. there they were, sixteen thousand gopis balling krishna on the river bank, and the energy of their merging was so great that it created a huge oneness, a total union of love, and it was god. wow! quite a picture, huh?}
<A>__{sissy's thumb twitches. jelly swallows hard. they gaze into each other's eyes. a whistle pierces the sunlight outside the window.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{that couldn't be krishna, could it? a bit shrill for a flute. just our rotten luck.}
<A>__{jelly walks to the window and exchanges hand signals with someone outside.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{gotta run now. delores says i'm needed. somebody's here. maybe it's the countess.}
<A>__{jelly spins her six shooter in her kewpie fingers.}
<C>__{jelly}
<D>__{sissy, cowgirl history is about to be made. i'm damn glad you're here to witness it.}
<A>__{she holsters her gun and blows sissy a kiss, then is gone out the door. sissy hops out of bed and from the window she can see cowgirls gathering in a circle. someone or something is in the center of the circle. sissy zips herself into a red jumpsuit and hurries outside.}
