<L>__{interior cottage evening}
<A>__{small. filled with cheap furniture. a small kitchenette is off to the side of the room. zero lays on the bed. daniel uses his belt as tourniquet to slow the bleeding. raymond sits at the table staring at the black canvas bag containing the cash and tapes. marcel is in the kitchenette.}

<P>__{(to zero)}

<A>__{zero smiles. sami enters carrying a shopping bag. he places it on the counter.}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{bring me the scissors.}
<C>__{zero}
<D>__{and the vodka.}
<A>__{sami removes the items from the bag. he opens the bottle and hands it to zero who quickly gulps down a few mouthfuls.}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{cut his pants up the leg to the groin.}
<C>__{zero}
<D>__{and be careful when you get near the top. zero has a very long one.}

<C>__{sami}
<D>__{what's he joking around for? he's been shot.}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{he's been shot a lot. he's used to it.}
<A>__{raymond cuts the pant leg away. daniel walks over to marcel who is standing over the gas range. over the flame is a tire wrench, the metal tip glowing red hot. sami opens the bag and removes some white bread.}

<D>__{anybody hungry?}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{what'd you get?}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{some bread and...}

<D>__{hey, you know you can't this in france.}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{thank god.}
<A>__{daniel uses a towel to pick up the tire wrench and walks over to the bed. sami and raymond grimace as they think about what's about to happen.}
<C>__{daniel}
<P>__{(to zero)}
<D>__{ready?}
<A>__{zero nods. daniel takes the bottle of vodka and pours some over the wound. zero flinches. daniel looks at marcel, then releases the belt. blood flows from the wound. marcel presses the hot poker against the wound. zero grunts, but does not scream. his face contorts violently from the pain.}
