<B>__{a hammam}
<A>__{an arab bath house. rays of sunlight play off the steaming waters. their footsteps echo off the tiled mosaic walls. sequence from original script.}
<B>__{in the bathouse}
<A>__{samir kneels to touch the steaming water.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{how soon are they coming?}
<C>__{samir}
<D>__{they'll be here.}
<A>__{he starts taking off his clothes.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{what are you doing ?}
<A>__{he finishes disrobing.}
<B>__{naked}
<A>__{he steps into the bath. with a sponge he washes his body.}
<C>__{samir}
<D>__{what message do you have for them, sharon?}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{i will tell them when they're here.}
<A>__{the distant sound of the approaching march echoes off the tiled walls as samir steps out of the purifying waters and takes a towel from a hamper.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{nobody else is coming, is there?}
<C>__{samir}
<D>__{that's right.}
<A>__{from the hamper he takes a sig sauer .9 automatic.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{you're the last cell.}
<C>__{samir}
<D>__{there will never be a last cell.}
<P>__{(racks the slide of the .9)}
<D>__{you should listen to the young men in that stadium. it is just beginning.}
<A>__{sharon watches, in dread fascination, as he takes a white egyptian cotton funeral shroud and drops it over his head.}
<B>__{the marchers}
<A>__{are streaming down the street. hub and frank desperately fight their way through a wild, almost "carnival" feel. back to the baths reflected in the purifying waters, samir is putting civilian clothes on over the shroud still holding the .9 on sharon.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{how could i have missed the play }
<C>__{samir}
<P>__{(a forgiving gesture)}
<D>__{it was the money. you believe money is power. belief is power.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{ just tell me we didn't finance your operation...}
<C>__{samir}
<P>__{(a sad smile)}
<D>__{the world is a wheel. so... what message do you have for me, sharon?}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{they're going to release him.}
<C>__{samir}
<D>__{praise god. when will he be free ?}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{a few months at most. first, they have to bring him to trial, but }

<C>__{samir}
<P>__{(not looking at her)}
<D>__{ no.}
<C>__{elise}

<C>__{elise}
<D>__{samir, the koran preaches }
<C>__{samir}
<D>__{do not speak to me of the koran, woman.}
<P>__{(fighting his emotion)}
<D>__{you take our leader. a holy man. you put him in prison for preaching the word of god. you must learn the consequences of trying to tell the world how to live.}
<C>__{elise}
<P>__{(with rising terror)}
<D>__{but it's over, your point's been made, why spill any more blood? those poor people out there in the street, they're fucking marching for your cause...}
<C>__{samir}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(fastens the last}
<D>__{strap on his semtex}
<P>__{harness)}
<D>__{and they, too, will become its martyrs.}
<A>__{a voice from the top of the stairs:}
<C>__{hub }
<D>__{let her go and you'll live.}
<A>__{samir looks up, sees hub aiming his .45. but sharon is between them, blocking his shot. from outside, we hear the sound of the marchers' chanting, "no fear...! no fear...!" samir hears it, too.}
<C>__{samir}
<D>__{move away from the door.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{no !!!}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{let her go and you'll live }

<C>__{hub}
<D>__{samir !}
<C>__{samir}
<D>__{you want to die !!}
<A>__{they're all screaming at once. still samir keeps inching toward the stairs. hub blocks the way.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{no way you're going out there.}
<A>__{samir jams the gun into sharon's ribs.}
<C>__{samir}
<D>__{move away !}
<A>__{sharon's eyes meet hubs'.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{shoot.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{shut up.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{shoot.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{shut up...}
<A>__{samir is edging ever closer. starting up the stairs. sharon's eyes plead with hub, begging for a kind of unholy redemption.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{shoot me !!!}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{i... can't !}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{you have to.}
<P>__{(weeping now)}
<D>__{you... promised...}
<A>__{hub's finger tightens on the trigger. but then slowly, almost imperceptibly at first, he lowers his gun.}
<C>__{elise}
<P>__{(sobbing)}
<D>__{no !!!}
<C>__{samir}
<D>__{it is god's will.}
<A>__{his left hand moves imperceptibly toward the ripcord of the explosive device.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{if there is a god, he weeps at the crimes we commit in his name.}
<B>__{his first shot}
<A>__{rips through sharon into samir, blowing them both backwards.}
<B>__{his second shot}
<A>__{is to samir's hand as it reaches for the ripcord.}
<B>__{the third shot}
<A>__{is a killing headshot. rolling him into the baths.}
<B>__{cloud of blood}
<A>__{blooms in the cleansing water. the funeral shroud billows.}
<B>__{the echo of the shots}
<A>__{still rings in the tiled room as hub kneels beside sharon.}
<C>__{hub}
<P>__{(on radio)}
<D>__{officer down. officer down !}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{is... he... dead?}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{...shhhhhhh...}
<C>__{elise}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{...no... regrets...}
<A>__{hub cradles her head.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{you... knew.}
<C>__{elise}
<P>__{(the saddest smile)}
<D>__{i... wondered.}
<B>__{frank haddad}
<A>__{appears at the top of the steps. behind him, two paramedics race down to kneel beside sharon. hub is pushed aside as they begin triage but it doesn't look good as suddenly, she begins to convulse.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{sharon... sharon }
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{... emma... my name... is emma.}
<A>__{and then she begins to mumble, at first incoherently, and then more clearly. we realize she's speaking arabic.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{ what are you? i don't...}
<A>__{and then frank is standing above them. tears in his eyes.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(translating)}
<D>__{"i... seek refuge... king of kings..."}
<A>__{and hub suddenly understands: she is preparing for her own death. he holds her as she continues to pray in and out of her two native tongues. until, at last:}
<D>__{sharon emma}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{allah ahkbar. god is great }
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{allah ahkbar }
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{amen.}
<A>__{and she's gone. outside in the streets moments later a block away, we can see the marchers pass by. the chant of "no fear..." fades into the distance. but hub has already turned his back and is hurrying away.}
