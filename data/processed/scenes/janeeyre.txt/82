<L>__{interior night. thornfield the second floor.}
<A>__{jane comes up the back stairs and on to the gallery, just as the ladies start to issue from their rooms. she stands back in a dark corner. there is an approach of chatter; a subdued vivacity. a flurry of multicoloured silks, lace and velvets go by. they descend the staircase as noiselessly as a bright mist. jane steps out. she walks right into the path of blanche ingram, who is dressed in white. they both startle.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{excuse me, miss.}
<A>__{blanche gives her a look of ice. rochester is at the top of the stairs.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{good evening.}
<A>__{they both turn. rochester has seen blanche, not jane. he offers her his arm, his gaze full of admiration. jane sinks back into the shadows.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{may i?}
<A>__{blanche lays her gloved hand on rochester's arm, barely touching him. they glide away.}
