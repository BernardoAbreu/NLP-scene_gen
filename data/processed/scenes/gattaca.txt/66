<L>__{interior gattaca simulator room. day.}
<A>__{in a large, bare room a simulator does a slow dance back and forth on its hydralic legs, miming the path of the space craft jerome will soon be aboard. the simulation ends and jerome exits the simulator through a small door. irene hesitantly approaches, carrying a slim electronic tablet.}

<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{why would we do that?}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{i have better things to do this week than answer the foolish questions of some flatfoot. don't you?}
<A>__{irene contemplates the question.}
<C>__{jerome}
<P>__{(gently pressing)}
<D>__{well, shall we say we spent the evening together?}
<A>__{irene is still unsure whether or not jerome is serious.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{to be convincing, jerome, i would have to know what that was like.}
<A>__{irene turns and departs. jerome watches her go.}
