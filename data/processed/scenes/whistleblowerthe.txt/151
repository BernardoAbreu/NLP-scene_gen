<A>__{ivan follows tanjo down rickety steps. cries and whimpers grow louder as they descend into a}
<B>__{basement}
<A>__{two men stand guard. tanjo walks past them. opens a door. ushering ivan inside where... girls are huddled together. luba, and three others. they look up... petrified... offscreen, the cries swell. we realize the sound is not coming from this room. tanjo waves his fingers, methodically...}
<C>__{tanjo }
<D>__{c'mon, let's go.}
<A>__{the girls stand, helping one another. tentative but submissive, they move toward him. he holds open the door.}
<C>__{tanjo }
<D>__{i want to show you what happens when you decide to talk to cops!!!!}
<A>__{they jump back. his scream echoes. they move}
<B>__{through the hall}
<A>__{to a door on the other side. tanjo nods. a guard opens the door onto a horrific site... luba closes her eyes. but tanjo pushes the girls in, one by one they go through into a}
<B>__{barren room}
<A>__{and see... raya... naked. held down by four men. spread eagle on her front. wailing. her face shows unimaginable pain. and we see that... two of the men holding her down are extinguishing lit}
<B>__{cigarettes into the balls of her foot.}
<C>__{raya}
<D>__{ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!}
<A>__{but we realize... this is not the greatest cause of her pain. luba's face whitens. eyeing one man at raya's backside. a flash of shame in his eyes as he steps away from raya, and drops... a pipe onto the ground. the men step away. leaving raya. collapsed into a ball. now the girls all understand... there is no hope at all.}
