<L>__{exterior underwater night}
<A>__{we see now that connor's on board a nuclear attack sub, with two more subs moving in tandem behind it. hold on the lead sub and move in on the stencilled name as it passes camera: "los angeles ssn 688."}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior repair lab day}
<A>__{start on marcus' damaged leg. it has been detached from his body, halfway down the thigh. elaborate circuits are exposed, as surgical machines perform repairs with lasers, mechanical arms replacing damaged parts. nearby, marcus opens his eyes, coming to. he's clamped onto an elaborate, mobile surgical table, the stump exposed. his body and head are secured within its framework. more machines swiftly repair the damage to his chest and shoulder. marcus twitches, freaking out, struggling in his bonds the detached leg twitches as well.}
<C>__{serena}
<D>__{calm down, marcus. it's all right.}
<A>__{serena is on the other side of a glass panel, operating computer controls. this is an automated surgical environment, the work on marcus carried out by various machines and microtools busy hydraulic arms, lasers, etc.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{like fuck it is. i'm sick of being your guinea pig, what are you doing to me now?!}
<C>__{serena}
<D>__{repairing you.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{you all work for skynet!}
<C>__{serena}
<D>__{please. skynet works for us. it's only a program a tool, a means to an end.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{the end of the world.}
<C>__{serena}
<D>__{its sole purpose is to protect humanity.}
<A>__{marcus lets out a horrified, bitter laugh.}
<C>__{serena }
<D>__{listen to me. skynet was designed to detect threats, make projections and implement solutions. as soon as it came on line, it factored in war, disease, environmental destruction and calculated a high probability of total human extinction within two hundred years. the human race was doomed... unless we were transformed.}
<A>__{the surgical table swivels, bringing marcus into alignment with the repaired leg. in moments it's reattached, the plastic skin thermosealed at the jointerior}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{into this? a brain in a box?}
<C>__{serena}
<D>__{skynet had access to the entire defense web including project angel. it determined hybrids were the only path to salvation.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{destroying the human race in order to save it.}
<A>__{the laser tools and hydraulic arms now move on their ceiling racks, coming close to marcus' face. the table inverts, exposing the back of his head.}
<C>__{marcus }
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{serena}
<D>__{when the resistance attacked our installation, we were forced to self destruct. we would have taken you with us, but we thought you were in a permanent coma...}
<A>__{the lasers start cutting into the back of marcus' head, burning through the plastic skin. marcus lets out a cry of rage, strains at his bonds.}
<C>__{serena }
<D>__{your interface was never installed.}
<A>__{close as the hydraulic arm attaches to the back of marcus' head and removes a section of steel skull... revealing the surface of a human brain, gray matter enmeshed in wires and circuitry beneath a clear plastic casing, in a bath of pale reddish liquid. tiny neural sparks fire.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{no, stop... i don't want it! you're dead inside, all of you!}
<C>__{serena}
<D>__{we're immortal. no sane person would choose to live in pain, forever. soon you'll understand.}
<A>__{close as an elaborate electronic interface module is fixed at the base of marcus' exposed brain. on marcus' face his expression of agony vanishes, his features become peaceful.}
