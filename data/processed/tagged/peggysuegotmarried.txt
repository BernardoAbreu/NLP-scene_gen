<A>__{thirty old men are congregating around the cloak room. most are already dressed in long, purple robes with the sunrise logo over their hearts. they either wear or carry tricorner hats. peggy and barney enter. several men approach them. peggy nervously clings to barney' s arm.}

<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{henry}

<L>__{interior lodge main room}
<A>__{a large meeting hall. the room is draped, and brightly lit with fluorescent lights. at one end sits a large, gold painted wood throne. on either side are large candle holders, with lit candles. a small table serves as an altar in front of the platform. on a footstool is a potted plane with an artificial bird perched on its top. the throne and altar look like a set left over from a summer stock "macbeth". peggy and barney enter. several men lead peggy away from barney to the throne. one man places a go1den cape around her shoulders. they lead her up the platform to the throne.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{hey, george. get the lights.}
<A>__{the lights are dimmed. the room is lit by the candles. the men form a semicircle around peggy. old men at the end of their lives, they are serious and passionate about the possibilities of life beyond this world. one by one, four men from either end of the line approach the altar with offerings: a cup of wine; an egg; a gold coin; and a rose. the men rejoin the line. leo cooper, a tall, whitehaired man, takes two steps forward. the other men begin to sing a gregorian chant.}

<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{this is never going to work.}
<A>__{the old men form a circle in front of peggy. they begin to circumambulate east to west, intoning together, their heads bowed. as barney passes in front of peggy, he winks at her. she smiles back.}

<D>__{fount of life, chariot of the spirit, womb of the mother, reclaim thy child of light.}
<A>__{we hear a clap of distant thunder. peggy trembles. the artificial bird falls off the plant. peggy is struck with amazement. she begins to glow, poised to take off. the men continue to chant while:}
<C>__{leo }
<D>__{the name of your love is sacrifice. we offer up this girl, that her soul may find its home.}
<A>__{suddenly a door is opened, a gust of wind pours in and extinguishes the candles, plunging the hall into darkness.}
<C>__{leo }
<D>__{nothing to worry about. somebody get the lights.}

<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i was trying to save you. they were going to vaporize you.}

<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{you betrayed me, charlie. you were never there for me or the children. and now you come and tell me, "peggy, you're scared." of course i'm scared. if you knew what i knew you'd be scared shitless.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you're crazy! you're really out of your mind!}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{i might be crazy, but i'm not crazy enough to marry you twice. there's a lot of things i can't change. i can't even think about them. i tried. but i couldn't even help rosalie.}
<P>__{(tears start)}
<D>__{i don't want to be bitter. i'm a naturally optimistic person. but you took advantage of that.}
