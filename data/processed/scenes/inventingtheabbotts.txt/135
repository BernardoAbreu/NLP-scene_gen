<L>__{exterior theater sidewalk (university of pennsylvania,}
<A>__{philadelphia) night doug and pam hurry along the rain swept sidewalk towards the theater.}
<L>__{interior theater night (moments later)}
<A>__{the large theater is dark except for a single work light standing on the bare stage. doug leads pam by the hand down the aisle from the lobby.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{what are we doing here?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{i want to show you something.}
<A>__{he escorts her up a short flight of steps and positions her center stage near the footlights.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{just stand right there.}
<A>__{he takes the work light with him as he walks off stage. then with a metallic clank everything goes dark.}
<C>__{pamela}
<P>__{(alarmed)}
<D>__{doug!}
<C>__{doug }
<D>__{it's all right don't move! stay put.}
<A>__{there's the rumble and squeak of a piece of scenery being rolled onto stage then the swoosh of a backdrop being lowered from the fly loft.}
<C>__{doug }
<D>__{almost, almost... hold on.}
<A>__{we hear doug running somewhere backstage then a beautiful sunset slowly illuminates the stage creating the perfect mood for the modestly scaled stylized set that doug has put into place: it is the roof of a weathered farmhouse with a dormer window and a tall brick chimney. doug steps on stage, he's a bit winded from his quick change routine.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{oh, doug, it's beautiful.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{the senior acting class does scenes from different plays, they invite everybody, it's a real big deal. so, there's this competition among all the theater design students to do the sets. and anyway i'm the one whose design got picked.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{what scene is it for? what play?}
<C>__{doug}
<P>__{(a tad embarrassed)}
<D>__{umm... romeo and juliet. it's something different, i think that's why they picked it. everybody else was doing castles and stuff. rooftop romeo and juliet by douglas l. holt.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{you're really good at this.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{it's like building models when i was a kid. it's fun. it's... make believe.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{you know, they tore that old farmhouse down?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{oh, no. did they?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{they always tear down the wrong stuff.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{oh, jesus, i missed you so much.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{missed you, too.}
<A>__{they kiss then pamela pulls away. doug studies her, then:}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{you have a boyfriend, right?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{well, what? you worried what your old man would think?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{he doesn't care what i do, as long as i don't do it in haley.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{then what's the problem?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{i can't... do this.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{why not? i mean... okay. we don't have to go so fast. shit, i'm sorry. i blew it again, huh?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{no, i did.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{how?}
<A>__{pam climbs down off the stage and starts up the aisle.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{i'm on probation. they pulled a bed check the night i was here. i have to be back in the dorm by ten. gotta go.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{what about tomorrow? i could come up in the afternoon and...}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{no! it's just too late. it's all messed up. i can't seem to make things all right. the more i try the worse everything gets. i'm sorry.}
<A>__{pam walks up the aisle and disappears through a door to the lobby.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{pam! it's not too late!}
