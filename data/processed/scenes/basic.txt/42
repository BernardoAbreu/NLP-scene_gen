<A>__{hardy and osborne sit across from kendall's bed.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{sergeant west is dead isn't he?}
<A>__{kendall nods.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{and the other three cadets?}
<A>__{kendall hesitates, then nods again.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{feel free to elaborate .}
<A>__{kendall takes a breath and begins, all trace of bravado gone.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{my father is a powerful man. over the years he's used that power to protect me, in one form or another, from certain... unpleasantries.}
<P>__{(deep breath)}
<D>__{i am a homosexual.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{senator daddy must be thrilled.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{he is not, shall we say, wild about the idea. he has asked me on numerous occasions to be more discreet about my proclivities, and i have done my best to oblige him. however, in the last four weeks, i began a relationship with another cadet. what do you think of that?}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{i think you just blew "don't ask, don't tell" out of the fucking water.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{the sergeant discovered this relationship and wanted me expelled. my father interceded, so instead, west sectioned me and made sure every other cadet knew that i was gay.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{he couldn't kick you out so he wanted you to quit on your own.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{he wanted more than that.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{more intrigue, levi?}
<A>__{kendall stares at them, dead serious.}
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{yes.}
