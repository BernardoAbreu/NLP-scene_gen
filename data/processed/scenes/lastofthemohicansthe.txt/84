<A>__{moving through the corridor past wounded. two french mortar bombs explode above one of the casements. we hear shrill screams in the distance and ...}
<C>__{hawkeye }
<D>__{... it was no raidin' party out for pillage. the cabin was attacked by a war party. they are sweeping south down the frontier spreading terror among farms and mohawk villages 'cos all the men are here.}
<C>__{ian }
<D>__{and my cabin's not thirteen miles south of cameron's!}
<A>__{cora, passing the open door to munro's crowded office, now hesitates. cora's pov: the room hawkeye, captain jack winthrop, ian, seven or eight other militia spokesmen, munro, heyward, two adjutants, one lieutenant of rangers.}
<C>__{munro}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{i must receive proof more conclusive than mr. poe's opinion before i weaken our defenses by allowing militia to withdraw.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{chingachgook's of the same opinion. taken together, that's gospel. your fort will stand or fall depending on webb and reinforcements, not these colonials' presence.}
<C>__{munro}
<D>__{i judge military matters, captain winthrop, not you.}
<C>__{hawkeye}
<D>__{that judgment is not more important than their right under agreement with webb to defend their farms & families ... major heyward was at john cameron's. he saw what it was.}
<C>__{munro}
<P>__{(looking to heyward for confirmation of his point of view)}
<D>__{what did you see, major?}
<A>__{heyward looks around the room. and he catches the doorway ...}

<A>__{beyond the periphery of men, staring at him.}
<B>__{heyward}
<A>__{munro is expecting him to be the good soldier in defense of british military interests. at the same time ...}
<B>__{cora}
<A>__{examines him with a cool, level stare.}
<B>__{heyward}
<A>__{looks at munro. more french rounds detonate o.s. what if webb gets here and they need to launch a counter attack? they need every man they have. it's his moment of decision ...}
<C>__{heyward}
<P>__{(to munro)}
<D>__{i saw nothing that would lead me to the conclusion it was other than a raid by savages bent on thievery.}
<A>__{jack winthrop grabs nathaniel.}
<C>__{hawkeye}
<D>__{you're a liar!}
<A>__{cora's saddened. heyward's stature has fallen irrevocably in her eyes.}
<B>__{heyward}
<A>__{can't help it. he turns to look at cora ... heyward's pov: doorway she's gone.}
<B>__{heyward}
<A>__{suffused with an inner sadness, turns to hawkeye.}
<C>__{hawkeye}
<D>__{and the blood is on your hands!}
<A>__{heyward reaches for his sword.}
<C>__{munro}
<P>__{(to heyward)}
<D>__{i will have none of that!}
<P>__{(to colonials)}
<D>__{montcalm is a soldier and a gentleman. not a butcher.}
<C>__{hawkeye}
<D>__{easy for you to suppose. while it is their women and children, not yours, alone in their farms!}
<C>__{munro}
<P>__{(exploding)}
<D>__{you forget yourself!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{we are not forgettin' webb's promise!}
<C>__{munro}
<D>__{british promises are honored. and the militia will not be released. because i need more definite proof than this man's word!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{nathaniel's word been good on the frontier a long time before you got here!}
<C>__{munro}
<D>__{this interview's over! the militia stays!}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to munro)}
<D>__{does the rule of english law no longer govern? has it been replaced by absolutism?}
<A>__{this is very dangerous talk.}
<C>__{hawkeye}
<D>__{and if english law cannot be trusted, maybe these people would do better makin' a peace with the french!}
<C>__{heyward}
<D>__{that is sedition! treason!}
<C>__{hawkeye}
<D>__{that is the truth!}
<C>__{heyward}
<P>__{(restaining himself)}
<D>__{i ought to have you whipped from this fort!}
<C>__{hawkeye}
<D>__{major!}
<P>__{(changes down)}
<D>__{some day i think you and i are gonna have a serious disagreement.}
<C>__{munro}
<P>__{(steel)}
<D>__{anyone fomenting or advocating leaving fort william henry will be hung for sedition. anyone leaving will be shot for desertion.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{my decision is final. get out.}
<A>__{hawkeye and the others are not intimidated. their rage smolders. the look on hawkeye's face says this is not over.}
