<L>__{interior choir rehearsal room that day}
<A>__{there are twelve nuns in the room, going over sheet music. mary lazarus is the group's leader; mary patrick and mary robert are also in the choir. christy appears at the door, grimacing.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{is this... choir practice?}
<C>__{mary patrick}
<D>__{sure is! come on in, and sing a spell.}
<A>__{christy spots mary robert.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{mary robert, i am so sorry about last night...}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{now stop that. you didn't shoot at me. you were only trying to help, to give me experience. i tried to explain that to reverend mother, but i don't know if she understood.}
<A>__{mary lazarus cuts off this chitchat, thrusting a hymnal at christy.}
<C>__{mary lazarus}
<D>__{soprano or alto?}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(very gloomy)}
<D>__{whatever.}
<A>__{mary lazarus hands christy a hymnal, and raps her baton. the choir begins to sing; christy doesn't even bother trying. she is horrified; the choir is the worst sounding group in history. they seem to be singing in several random keys, and they even have trouble with the words. no one looks up from their hymnals. sister alma, the organist with the hearing aid, is plodding along.}
