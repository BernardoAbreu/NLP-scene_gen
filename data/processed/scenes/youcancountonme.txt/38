<D>__{thanks, darryl.}
<A>__{darryl walks away. terry stands outside the restaurant looking for sammy. behind him in the restaurant sammy is sitting at a table, talking to the waitress. she sees terry and gets up immediately, smiling like crazy as she threads her way through the tables toward the door. terry turns and sees her. he breaks into a big smile, tosses his cigarette and goes into the restaurant. through the window we see them make their way toward each other. sammy throws her arms around him. he hugs her back with a big involuntary smile as the glass door slowly closes.}
