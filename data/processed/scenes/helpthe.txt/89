<L>__{interior holbrook house parlor later that night}
<A>__{hilly, her husband, william, and skeeter's date, stuart whitworth, drink high balls and eat cheese in the holbrook parlor. gold swag curtains hang on the windows. balding and pudgy, only william's family money once made him a desirable bachelor. stuart, on the other hand, is very handsome, the "marlboro man" in a well tailored suit. yule may (who we met earlier at church with aibileen) now works for hilly. she clears empty glasses.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{with your daddy's endorsement, i can win that senate seat.}
<A>__{stuart feigns interest.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{i will talk to him.}
<A>__{ice slams against stuart's teeth as he downs his drink. hilly pats william's leg then turns with concern to a grandfather clock announcing half past the hour. the front door flies open. skeeter enters completely out of breath and sweaty. her hair has tripled in size. she waves.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{as hilly races toward skeeter, william and stuart stand. stuart is as tall as he is handsome.}
<C>__{hilly}
<D>__{boys, we'll be right back. y'all talk about quarterbacks or something. yule may, get miss skeeter a coca cola.}
<A>__{yule may runs off. hilly pulls skeeter down the hall.}
