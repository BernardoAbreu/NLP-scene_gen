<L>__{exterior roadside cafe day (1968)}
<A>__{clough and taylor emerge from a roadside cafe and walk towards their car. they've missed sunday lunch. so it's crisps. sweets. fizzy drinks. almost childlike. happier in one another's company than with their own families.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{where would we play him?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{in the middle of the park. somewhere he can see everything, use his loaf, and tell the kids what to do.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{we'll play him as a sweeper, then.}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(eating crisps)}
<D>__{aye.}
<A>__{they climb into the waiting car...}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{won't have to run about too much. and what's all this i hear about a tie shop?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{he's got a tie shop, hasn't he? in london. which he spends two days a week at.}
<A>__{clough starts the engine...}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{fucking tie shop?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{it's his "nest egg". for the future.}
<C>__{clough}
