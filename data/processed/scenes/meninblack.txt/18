<A>__{ka boom! kay blows jeebs' head off and jeebs' body collapses to the floor. edwards is shocked. edwards pulls his own weapon and points it at kay's head.}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{put down the gun and put your hands on the counter!}
<C>__{kay}

<C>__{kay}
<D>__{will you relax?}
<C>__{jeebs }
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{don't do that.}
<A>__{edwards whirls around to see jeebs' body, growing another head. only takes four or five seconds. kay calmly shoves his gun up against jeebs' baby soft new cheek.}
<C>__{jeebs }
<D>__{do you know how much that hurts?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{show us what you got, jeebs. or i will use up another one.}
<A>__{jeebs, panicked, hits a button on the underside of the counter, which promptly flips over, revealing yet another dusty shelf, piled high with junk but this is all alien junk. weapons, mostly, bizarre, otherworldly weapons of all shapes and sizes.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{edwards?}
<A>__{edwards, still dazed by jeebs' regrown head, glances down at all the weapons.}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{uh, this. this is what i saw.}
<A>__{kay looks at jeebs, pissed off.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{you sold a carbonizer with implosion capacity to an unlicensed cephlapoid.}
<C>__{jeebs}
<D>__{he looked all right to me.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{a carbonizer is an assassin's weapon, jeebs. who was the target?}
<C>__{jeebs}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{kay raises the weapon again, threatening.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{jeebs!}
<C>__{jeebs}
<D>__{i don't know!}
<A>__{kay lowers his gun, gestures to the shelf full of weapons.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{this is all confiscated. all of it. i want you on the next transport off this rock. or i will shoot you where it doesn't grow back.}
<A>__{jeebs nods, point taken. kay leaves.}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{yeah. i will be by tomorrow for those rolexes.}
<A>__{shaken, edwards follows.}
