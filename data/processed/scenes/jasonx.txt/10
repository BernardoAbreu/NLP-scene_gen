<L>__{interior ancient corridor}
<A>__{yllo and the others climb down a rusted ladder. metallic walls, graffiti, cluttered floors. no stoney or adrienne. a sign from the ceiling states }
<B>__{crystal lake research facility.}
<A>__{they all take off the goggles and masks. the rest of the group consists of delongpre(18) good looking, smart ass; janessa(17) sexual, scheming azrael(17) small, cocky; kkinsa(16), insecure, problematic; thorgan(17), a nerd but doesn't know it.}
<C>__{yllo}
<D>__{amazing! but, how . . i've been coming here for ten years. we never picked this up on our . . . kay em?}
<A>__{kay em 14, a cybernetics science droid, removes her veil. she's gorgeous, but there's something off about her look. something synthetic.}
<D>__{kay em 14 the air's laced with type two ozone, it reads as a solid.}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{somebody wanted the place to stay hidden. kay em 14 in twenty eighty two many of the survivors moved their facilities underground to escape . . .}
<C>__{kicker}
<D>__{all right, all right, enough with the history lesson. lets find these two quick . . so i can kick some little punk ass.}
<A>__{kkinsa shines a flashlight around the dark tunnel.}
<C>__{kkinsa}
<D>__{i have an idea, why don't you go find them and we'll get the hell out of here!}
<A>__{kkinsa turns and finds herself face to face with a corpse! easily two hundred years old it hangs from the wall, impaled through the forehead by an iron spike. kkinsa screams! kicker yanks a weapon from his back, locks and loads as janessa falls back and lands in the lap of another corpse. she screams! kay em 14 screams at the top of her lungs. everyone looks at the droid.}
<D>__{kay em 14 was that out loud?}
<C>__{delongpree}
<D>__{thorgan, have you been screwing with . . .}
<A>__{thorgan grabs the head off the corpse, with the spike through it's head.}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{cool! this is an automatic "a".}
<A>__{azrael dumps the contents of his bag on the ground, an old boot, some cds, and an ancient box of playtex . . . starts shoving the corpse into his pack.}
<C>__{azrael}
<D>__{i've got my project. what are you losers gonna do?}
<C>__{kicker}
<D>__{back to the shuttle! all of you! i will find them.}
<C>__{yllo}
<D>__{relax, soldier boy, this is amazing. these remains are two hundred years old.}
<A>__{yllo's light hits a sign hanging from the ceiling. danger. stay out.}
<C>__{boeman}
<D>__{creepy.}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{cool.}
<C>__{kkinsa}
<D>__{okay, i'm outta here.}
<C>__{yylo}
<D>__{kay em, any thoughts? kay em 14 girth is better than length and women prefer a shaved scrotum during oral sex.}
<A>__{yllo glares a thorgan.}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{i'm trying to give her some personality.}
<C>__{yllo}
<D>__{well stop messing with her. i don't want a science droid with a personality. now let's find them and get back. i want to get clearance to stay back and study this . . .}
<C>__{kkinsa}
<D>__{no way! i'm not staying here any longer . . . i have a life you know.}
<A>__{a radio crackles.}
<C>__{fat lou}
<D>__{hey teach! this rock's starting to freeze! get your ass back hre!}
<C>__{yllo}
<P>__{(into radio)}
<D>__{keep your shirt on! i'm working on it. you won't believe what we found.}
<P>__{(calls out)}
<D>__{adrienne! stoney!}
<A>__{yllo rushes past the corpse. the others reluctantly follow. they pass another hanging sign danger they pass another corpse lying on the floor, it's torso separated from it's legs. and this is just the beginning. as they move down the corridor there are bodies everywhere.}
<C>__{boeman}
<D>__{there was a hall of a battle down here.}
<A>__{s they move further they break a laser beam . . . sparks fly. a warning voice sounds.}
<C>__{computer voice}
<D>__{dan danger. do not enter er.}
<A>__{but the group keeps moving.}
<C>__{kkinsa}
<D>__{i feel compelled to ask why we are ignoring that.}
<A>__{a corpse lies on the floor before them, it's skeletal hand beneath a warning written in ancient blood . . .}
<B>__{help me . . .}
<A>__{suddenly another corpse leaps at them, screaming like a banshee! everyone screams it lands on kkinsa, who totally freaks trying to get the corpse off her. delongpree and yllo help kkinsa fight the rotting corpse. they hear hysterical laughter and look up to see adrienne and stoney . . . emerge from the shadows laughing uncontrollably.}
<C>__{delongpree}
<D>__{damnit!}
<C>__{yllo}
<D>__{what the hell are you two doing?!}
<A>__{kkinsa eyes adrienne, then glares at stoney.}
<C>__{kkinsa}
<D>__{you're toast, mister.}
<C>__{yllo}
<D>__{you're both toast!}
<C>__{adrienne}
<D>__{you gotta see this!}
<A>__{they turn down the right corridor, passing beneath ceiling consisting of a jumbled mess of jagged metal.}
<C>__{thorgan}
<P>__{(re: ceiling)}
<D>__{that's a strange design, don't you think?}
<C>__{kicker}
<D>__{we don't have time for this shit.}
<A>__{as they pass we see a section of the jagged metal ceiling twitch and squeeze together. that can't be a good thing . . . stoney and adrienne stop at a huge metal door. above the door . . .}
<B>__{cryogenics lab.}
<A>__{adrienne points to a small window in the door.}
<C>__{delongpree}
<D>__{yeah, so? i had cryo 101 last year.}
<C>__{adrienne}
<D>__{check it out.}
<A>__{with a smirk, adrienne wipes the condensation from the small window in the door. drawn from the inside, in blood, is a final warning }
<B>__{a skull and crossbones}
<C>__{kkinsa}
<D>__{so don't open the door.}
<C>__{adrienne}
<D>__{look beyond it, yesterday's news.}
<A>__{yllo pushes his way to the window. shocked faces. inside the blue tinted room we see a huge domed cryo cylinder. it's massive, but our attention is pulled to the corner of the room. curled up into a ball, is a body female, young.}
<C>__{yllo}
<D>__{is that? kay em 14 the room's still operational. she's perfectly preserved.}
<A>__{yllo's face lights up, grabs his radio.}
<C>__{yllo}
<P>__{(into radio)}
<D>__{fat lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. call grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century!}
<C>__{kicker}
<D>__{now wait a minute! i don't think you should open that door.}
<C>__{yllo}
<D>__{this is a science excursion corporal. just stay out of the way.}
<A>__{yllo turns to the kids. he's very excited.}
<C>__{yllo}
<D>__{okay, no screwing around. this is the real thing. do exactly what i say. okay thorgan, open it up.}
<A>__{thorgan pops the cover from a control panel and hooks up a small gadget.}
<C>__{kkinsa}
<D>__{you're opening the door? what about the . . . ?}
<A>__{she points to the skull and crossbones.}
<C>__{delongpree}
<D>__{i'm thinking we should call in some experts.}
<C>__{yllo}
<D>__{this is your find people. you want to give your credit away?}
<C>__{delongpree}
<D>__{i was just saying . . .}
<C>__{thorgan}
<D>__{the cryo unit leaked. the computers sealed the room. no airborne viruses no hazardous materials. i've shut down the until. alright, stand back. kay em 14 hold your breath. initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious.}
<C>__{delongpree}
<D>__{knock you on your ass pal.}
<A>__{they don their face masks as . . . fshhhhhshshsh. the metallic door cracks open causing a powerful backdraft. the freezing cold air mixes with the air outside the chamber creating a strange gray gas. ice crystals crack and fall to the floor.}
