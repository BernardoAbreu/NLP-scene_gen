<A>__{a few hours later. the house seems threateningly still. too still.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior cole's house night}
<A>__{an unnatural silence fills each room of the house. the thermostat on the wall now reads, fifty two degrees. a light turns on from under cole's door. the door opens a crack. cole's tiny face peeks out. eyes scan the darkness. the door opens a little bit more. cole's knees are pressed together. his body dances a little. cole has to pee. he moves cautiously into the hall. cole moves briskly to a door halfway down the corridor. opens it. cole turns on the light in the bathroom. he checks behind the shower curtain, before he turns his back and pees into the toilet.}
<B>__{a large figure moves past the doorway.}
<A>__{cole instantly stops peeing. his body becomes very still. he slowly reaches for the toilet handle and flushes. he closes his pants and turns. he doesn't come out of the bathroom at first. he just stands there and stares into the darkness of the hall.}
<B>__{his breath forms tiny clouds in the cold air.}
<A>__{beat. cole finally steps out into the hallway. his eyes catch a slant of light now coming from the kitchen. cole hesitates before being drawn to the kitchen. he moves down the hall and turns the corner coming to a stop in the doorway of the kitchen.}
