<L>__{interior funeral home. prep room day}
<A>__{anna lies rigidly on the slab. her head turned to one side. staring blankly at the wall. her eyes glazed. suddenly classical music fills the room. anna frowns. disoriented. she moves her head with difficulty. nervously looks around. for a moment she doesn't know where she is. then she sees eliot by a cd player. she watches with trepidation as he approaches her.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{please don't hurt me.}
<C>__{eliot}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{how can i hurt you? you're already dead.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{but i'm not dead.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{then why are you here?}
<A>__{anna doesn't know what to say. she turns her head away. a tear falls down her cheek.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{please. just let me go. i won't go to the police. i won't tell anyone.}
<A>__{eliot moves her head back. gently wipes away her tear.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{you're still in denial. you have to trust me. i'm only here to help you.}
<A>__{eliot slides a wooden head rest under her neck and studies her wounds, touching them delicately. thinking about how to conceal them. he turns to a tray of instruments. picks up a needle. leans over anna. the needle pierces her brow. sliding cleanly through her skin. she doesn't feel any pain as eliot carefully sews the wound. he's meticulous. clearly very good at his job. eliot glances at his watch. picks up a syringe and an ampoule of amber liquid. draws up the amber liquid. anna's alarmed. she tries to pull back.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{don't be scared.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{this will relax your muscles. stop the rigor mortis setting in so i can work on your body.}
<A>__{he injects anna in the neck. just then we hear a car pull up on the gravel driveway outside.}
<C>__{eliot}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{your mother's early.}
<A>__{anna's eyelids feel very heavy. slowly her eyes close. eliot pulls the white sheet over her body.}
