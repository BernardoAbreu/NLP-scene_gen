<T>__{shock cut to:}
<L>__{interior kuato's inner sanctum night}
<A>__{quail awakens with a jolt. white as a sheet... sweating like he's just run ten miles. then: a transformation seems to come over him. he looks and sees: kuato slumped across the cushions melina beside kuato bennie standing holding a smoking gun trained on kuato.}
<C>__{melina}
<P>__{(rushes to quail)}
<D>__{charles! are you all right?}
<A>__{quail stares at her, as if an entire bank of lost memories were suddenly clicking back into place }
<C>__{melina}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{he kept dragging you deeper and deeper into the trance! we couldn't wake either of you!}
<C>__{bennie}
<D>__{you stopped breathing!}
<A>__{quail gives bennie that same eerie look, then turns to kuato, who is sprawled motionless across the pillows, a curl of smoke rising from two entry wounds in his spine.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{why did you kill him? it was the next bit i really...}
<C>__{bennie}
<D>__{no choice, boss. it was him or you.}
<A>__{quail lunges across the pillows to kuato's unbreathing form. quail shakes the ancient mystic, trying to find a last flicker of life. kuato's body is dead white. quail releases his grip; he about to give up when a muffled chocked sound comes from behind kuato's neck. it's the oracle head! quail instantly rolls kuato's body over. the head is still alive! quail bends closer, kneeling.}
<C>__{oracle head}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{ the vengence you seek... and the salvation of mars... are waiting for you in the crown of the sphinx.}
<P>__{(sags, gasping)}
<A>__{the oracle head lets out a long sigh and goes limp, a small trickle of blood oozing from the corner of its mouth.}
<C>__{bennie}
<D>__{phobos and demos! what was that all about?}
<A>__{quail ignores him, still kneeling deep in thought over the oracle head.}
<C>__{melina}
<D>__{are you okay?... charles? doug? whoever?}
<A>__{quail reaches out and closes the oracle head's tiny eyelids. melina and bennie exchange a glance. then:}
<B>__{quail}
<A>__{stands. for a moment his back is to melina and bennie. then he turns. he has become a different man. his eyes gleam. he is forceful, purposeful, contained. once again the ace e.i.o. agent. melina senses immediately that this is the man she knew before}
<C>__{quail}
<P>__{(even his voice has changed)}
<D>__{i'm fine... only i'm not doug i'm charles hauser... and i know everything hauser knew.}
<A>__{he turns to bennie}
<C>__{quail}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{bennie, where's your depot?}
<C>__{bennie}
<P>__{(working it out)}
<D>__{well... you go outta here... take a left, then down past the first... no second... water bureau you...}
<C>__{quail}
<P>__{(briskly)}
<D>__{can you get us there?}
<C>__{bennie}
<D>__{no problem.}
<C>__{melina}
<D>__{but why?}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{we're going to the sphinx.}
<A>__{he strides off. the others follow, still full of questions.}
<C>__{bennie}
<D>__{impossible, man. guards everywhere.}
<C>__{melina}
<D>__{the oracle... what did you learn?}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{only everything. i've got total recall.}
<A>__{they are now heading down the stairs toward the street.}
