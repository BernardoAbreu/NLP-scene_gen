<L>__{exterior terrace night}
<A>__{hunsecker turns from the window. camera is close on his brooding face. camera tracks with him as he crosses towards the parapet. at this height there is a wind which blows his hair and the movement of the camera emphasizes a remarkable vista of the new york skyline. the buildings are now dark, only a few of the electric signs are left on all night. camera comes to rest looking over hunsecker's shoulder; it tilts downward to a view of broadway below, duffy square in the distance. hunsecker night a close up; hunsecker is looking down on his "kingdom". but there is little love in the man's face, only authoritarian power.}
