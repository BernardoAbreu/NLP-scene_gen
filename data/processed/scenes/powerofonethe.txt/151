<D>__{when you say to me, onoshobishobi ingelosi means nothing, you are right. and you are wrong. the legend gives the people hope for a good tomorrow. but hope alone will not make a good tomorrow for the people. you cannot write our letters, get us clothes, food, work. these things we must do ourselves, so we can be part of this country's good tomorrow. if we are not, the hope will disappear. the people will grow tired. the tired will grow angry and there will be no good tomorrow for anybody black or white.}
