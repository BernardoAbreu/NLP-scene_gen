<L>__{interior airplane 737 evening}
<A>__{kirk is somber as he finds his seat near the middle of the plane. from two rows back, eric reaches over some other passengers to tap kirk on the shoulder.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{tom fuckin' wopat, bro!}
<A>__{eric hangs up a high five and kirk leaves it hanging. kirk takes a seat on the aisle next to marnie. he gives marnie a forced smile. she puts her head on his shoulder. pan over to the window seat where ron sits watching them, wearing his new travel pillow. suddenly, there is a commotion at the front of the plane.}
<C>__{flight attendant}
<D>__{what!? you don't have authority on board this aircraft!}
<A>__{stainer barges past the flight attendant, holding up his tsa badge.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{it's okay folks! tsa! this guy's drunk as fuck and he shit himself. we gotta get him off the plane.}
<A>__{stainer grabs kirk by the shoulder, pulls him out of his seat and about two rows down the aisle before kirk overpowers him and stops.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{stainer! what are you nuts!?}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{you were right! i messed you up. we gotta fix this thing! let's go.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{stainer! no! believe it or not, this isn't about you! in fact it's none of your business!}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{kirky! in junior high i peed my pants in class and eric started calling me stainer, remember?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{okay, yeah?}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{pretty soon everyone else started calling me stainer because they knew it would make me cry. then you told me to own that name, to call myself stainer so nobody could hurt me with it anymore.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{what's your point?}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{my point is... um... oh, shit. i was just in the crapper and i had this thing all worked out. damn it.}
<A>__{the pilot is now behind stainer and towering over him.}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{sir, i'm going to have to ask you to exit the aircraft immediately.}
<A>__{stainer turns into his face.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{i'm going to have to ask you to fuck off immediately before i feed you your own fuckin' teeth!}
<A>__{the pilot backs up and goes for help.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{jesus stains! you're going to get arrested! and i won't be here to bail you out this time.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{ooohh! that was my point! you saved me! that time and a bunch of other times too.}
<C>__{stainer }
<D>__{you gotta let me save you this time. it's my turn! your grandma didn't leave you three million bucks so you could take these a holes to branson.}
<A>__{eric gets up and steps into stainer's face. in mid sentence and without pausing stainer zaps eric with a stun gun. eric sails back into his seat as stainer continues.}
<C>__{stainer }
<D>__{these people hardly know you.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{stainer, i appreciate that you think you're helping me but i'm with marnie now.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{kirk, marnie's a fuckin' bitch.}
<P>__{(to marnie) all due respect.}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{hit him kirk! or else i will!}
<A>__{fuller and two other security people enter the plane. the pilot briefs them on what's happening.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{kirk! you said marnie makes you feel secure but security is bullshit! look at our jobs! it's all for show! for all we know, there's a bomb on this plane right now!}
<A>__{the other passengers gasp and most of them look at habib, who sits a few seats behind kirk.}
<C>__{habib}
<D>__{what!?}
<A>__{fuller grabs stainer by the collar.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{you want to see what i think of security!?}
<A>__{stainer turns and punches fuller in the face, knocking him backwards onto the other agents.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh, stainer, what did you do?}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{kirk! when i added all this up for you i made one big mistake. you are a ten. you're a ten, man!}
<A>__{kirk just stares back. fuller and the agents grab stainer but he clutches a seat and stays put.}
<C>__{stainer }
<D>__{you're not buying any of this bullshit are you?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{stainer loses his grip and the agents drag him off the plane. kirk sits down and marnie comforts him.}
