<L>__{interior hotel enzo's room night}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{tell me, why don't you go and get your medal?}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{because pasta should be eaten "al dente". so the trinket will just have to wait a bit.}
<A>__{enzo takes jacques by the shoulder. inside his room is absolute chaos: dancing, singing, eating. wet suits hung out to dry everywhere. mamma molinari is whipping up mountains of spaghetti on an improvised stove in the middle of the room. a lot of smoke... steam... color... noise... all of italy crammed into a few square feet. johana taken in by the warm atmosphere, sits in a corner of the room. jacques walks over and sits down at her side.}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(to mamma)}
<D>__{mamma! la pasta?!}
<C>__{mamma molinari}
<D>__{arrivo! arrivo!}
<A>__{she points at roberto who is taking forever to grate the cheese. enzo grabs the guitar from his other brother's hands and starts playing.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{... it's easy. you go down. you come up.}
<P>__{(to johana)}
<D>__{... right, johana?}
<C>__{johana}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{congratulations, enzo.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{don't you agree, jacques?}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{... you always were the best.}
<A>__{enzo laughs then sees his mother.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{ah! la pasta!}
<A>__{enzo starts singing in italian. mamma molinari serves the pasta, roberto follows her around, sprinkling his cheese on the plates. she serves johana a huge plate of pasta, enough for three giants.}
<C>__{mamma molinari}
<P>__{(with a smile)}
<D>__{buon appetito, signorina!}
<A>__{johana who isn't even hungry, grins uncertainly. jacques has walked up to enzo. he doesn't dare ask his question.}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{what's the matter? you still have a bunch of things to ask me? you want to know the price of tea in china of how we landed on the moon? is that it?}
<A>__{enzo laughs. jacques is serious.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{no, i have to ask you a favor...}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{you're the only one who'll understand.}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(seriously)}
<D>__{... i'm listening.}
