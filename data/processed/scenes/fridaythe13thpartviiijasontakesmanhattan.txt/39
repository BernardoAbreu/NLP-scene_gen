<L>__{interior j.j.'s stateroom day}
<A>__{as j.j., a female rocker in the vein of band "vixen," continues to wail on her guitar. she's wearing a black leather corset, with wildly teased deep red hair. holding the camcorder is wayne webber, mtv acclimated, wearing the latest hip prescription glasses.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{too cool, j.j. your parents came through.}
<A>__{she pops out the guitar cable from her practice amp.}
<C>__{j.j.}
<D>__{no lie. i hear there's a big power room down below where i can get supreme concert hall echo. come down and shoot a basement tape on me, okay?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{sure...but i gotta shoot some shockumentary footage first.}
<A>__{he avoids eye contact when he says it. she gives him a look.}
<C>__{j.j.}
<D>__{man, don't tell me you're still trying to scam on tamara...}
<A>__{his non answer means yes. j.j. walks over to him, grabbing his cheeks, shaking them like jello.}
<C>__{j.j.}
<D>__{how long have we known each other? don't be a dweeb, wayne. she's not interested in you, only what you can do for her. she's a user.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{she's sexy.}
<C>__{j.j.}
<D>__{so's this guitar. so what?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{i will catch you later.}
<A>__{he exits. she mumbles something under her breath, coiling up her amp cord.}
