<L>__{interior bathroom tight on larry}
<A>__{there is a pained, tragic and extremely stoned out look on his face as he sighs deeply and then summons up his courage. widen as he looks down at his right wrist. he heaves another deep sigh and brings an electric razor}
<L>__{into frame. he turns it on and runs it over his wrist. of}
<A>__{course, nothing happens. just then rick enters.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i'm trying to slash my wrists.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{you're trying to kill yourself with an electric razor?}

<D>__{i couldn't find any razor blades.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{well, this is terrific. now you're gonna have wrists that are smooth and kissable. just go out there. forget about everything and laugh it up.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(suddenly laughs like a crazy man)}
<D>__{ha, ha, ha.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{no, have fun first. then laugh. now, forget about marriage for a while. go party.}
<A>__{as he shoves larry out, gary enters the bathroom. his expression tells us he's had the best sex of his life.}
<C>__{rick}

<A>__{rick exits as gary dreamily crosses to the mirror.}
<C>__{gary}
<P>__{(into mirror)}
<D>__{this time it's real. she's wonderful.}
<A>__{gary's "woman" enters and closes the door. their eyes meet. gary takes her hand and kisses it gently. she turns away, then lifts up the toilet seat, lifts up her dress and proceeds to pee. she is a man. gary is stunned. his jaw drops open. gary's dream girl guy finishes his business. he drops his dress and turns to gary.}
<C>__{she}
<D>__{the name's tim. i'm always available.}
<A>__{he blows a kiss and starts to leave, but turns back.}
<D>__{she tim by the way... i also do engine work on bmw's. 'bye.}
<A>__{tim exits. gary feels filthy. he rips open the cabinet, takes out tooth paste and toothbrush and vigorously brushes his teeth. he rips off his clothes and jumps in the shower and scrubs as if he's scraping barnacles off a hull of a tugboat.}
