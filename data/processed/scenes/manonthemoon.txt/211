<A>__{a 16mm projector runs a scratchy 1930's movie short on the wall. smiling fake cowboys and cowgirls dance, the cowgirls straddling hobby horses. they all sing.}
<C>__{cowboys and cowgirls}
<D>__{"i've got spurs that jingle jangle jingle..."}
<B>__{we widen}
<A>__{andy, george and zmuda watch. andy's face is enthralled like a kid.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{this is great. the crowd's gonna love this!}
<P>__{(giddy; thinking)}
<D>__{hey... do you still think any of those cowgirls are still alive?}
<C>__{zmuda}
<D>__{i dunno. if they were, they'd be pushin' 80.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{well, call sag. it'd be cool to get one on the show.}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{i want the evening to build and build. it's gonna have the most incredible ending: singers, dancers, the "hallelujah chorus" then the sky opens, and santa claus comes flying down!}
<C>__{zmuda}
<D>__{and you say, "santa, what am i gettin' for christmas?" and he says, "cancer!"}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{no! no no no! none of that! i want this show to be positive!}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{that's great... but this show's gonna cost a fortune. even if it sells out, you'll still lose eighty grand.}
<A>__{andy smiles.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{i don't care about the money. i just want the show to deliver.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{so who's gonna pay for it?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{tony clifton.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you know tony doesn't have that kind of money.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{then he'll borrow it. i know tony better than you do. even if he has to work another ten years to pay it off, he'll do it!}
<A>__{pause. george considers this then slowly nods.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{okay, andy. will do.}
