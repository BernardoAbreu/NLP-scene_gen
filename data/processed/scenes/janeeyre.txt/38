<A>__{miss scatcherd's bitter life is in her face and voice.}
<C>__{miss scatcherd}
<D>__{burns, helen burns!}
<A>__{jane, aged ten, looks up. she is wearing a brown stuff frock with a puritanical cap like all the other girls. silence reigns in the school hall. a red haired girl of about thirteen stands up; helen burns. miss scatcherd holds up an apron in which a hole has been mistakenly cut.}
<C>__{miss scatcherd }
<D>__{you're a slattern and a disgrace!}
<A>__{helen burns undoes the back of her dress. the punishment is given; a dozen sharp, stinging whacks with the birch twigs. jane is appalled. but to her astonishment and awe, helen burns doesn't cry; she barely changes her expression. as the strokes go on seven, eight, nine helen seems like one in a trance. jane is deeply affected. on the eleventh stroke, the door bursts open and a visiting party walks in: the brocklehurst family. miss temple escorts two young girls dressed in peacock finery and two smart, bombastic ladies. mr brocklehurst follows. helen's punishment is forgotten as the students rush to their feet. jane, in a panic, drops her slate and breaks it. brocklehurst's eyes sweep the room. they land on her.}

<A>__{we see the look of frustration on miss temple's face.}
<C>__{brocklehurst }
<D>__{she is a castaway and an alien in his flock and you must be on your guard against her. for this child... is a liar!}
<A>__{he points to a tall stool. jane stands on it.}
<C>__{brocklehurst }
<D>__{this is the pedestal of infamy and you'll remain upon it all day. you'll receive no sustenance and no comfort, for you must learn how barren is the life of the sinner. children, i exhort you to shun her, exclude her, shut her out from this day forth. withhold the hand of friendship and deny your love to jane eyre, the liar.}
