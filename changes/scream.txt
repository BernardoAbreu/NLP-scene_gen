A GHOST MASKED FIGURE strikes from within, with an umbrella, the sharp end hitting him in the chest as it fans out.  Billy stumbles back, stunned, as the GHOST comes at him again...the umbrella lodges in his chest, and he goes down. Sidney rips the GHOST MASK off her head.

Her other hand brings the gun up to his face...but he head bunts it out the front door...suddenly a flash of silver appears above Sidney. Billy has grasped the butcher knife...he rises it high above Sidney ready to strike...when a bullet RIPS THROUGH THE FOYER striking Billy knocking him back into the living room. Sidney looks up to see... GALE WEATHERS, holding the gun in a death grip as smoke rises above the gun's chamber. Sidney sits up as Gale moves to her, helping her.  Their eyes meet.  A life truce.}
