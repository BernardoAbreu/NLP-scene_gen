<A>__{a few items indicating film production are in the frame. at a table in the foreground, bob the director discusses the character of joyce with the actress playing her. the actress just nods as the director goes on. we can see the real joyce sitting with the real harvey in the distance.}
<C>__{director}
<D>__{okay, i think the thing with joyce is that as manic as harvey can be, she matches him with depression. in that way they complete each other. i mean, she's obviously a very smart woman, but she has a lot of trouble functioning in a world she can't control. and she's totally obsessed with all things negative; y'know, diseases, dysfuctions, etc.}
<A>__{the real joyce and real harvey listen curiously sometimes pleased, sometimes displeased as their personalities are dissected and boiled down to a few phrases.}
<B>__{closer shot of real joyce and harvey}
<A>__{the real joyce puts in her two cents about the actress playing her. she rants about what it's like to be portrayed in a movie, and having a character arc imposed on her life. she moves into talking about her relationship with harvey, and the first years of their marriage how impossible it was to live with him. the real harvey just rolls his eyes.}
