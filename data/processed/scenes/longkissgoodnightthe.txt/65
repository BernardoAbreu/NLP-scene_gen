<L>__{exterior roadside late afternoon}
<A>__{nathan has pulled over in a grove of pine trees. the car is covered with branches. he watches through a gap as two police cars go by on the distant highway.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{your father was in the british sis, assigned to the irish situation. after he was murdered in 1971, his friend perkins recruited you for chapter, a black bag operation working out of the u.s. state department.}
<A>__{charly is overloaded. trying to keep up, not wanting to:}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{fall, 1987: presidential orders come down. you're to flush out a terrorist by the name of daedalus. you never complete the mission, electing instead to die, of all things, despite clear orders to the contrary. and dead you remain until, without preamble, you re emerge, eight years later and fifteen pounds heavier.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{would you lay off the weight?}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{i think we can safely assume daedalus is aware of your resurrection and is attempting to reverse it. damn, i can't drive around in this thing.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{any idea where we can go to stash this car?}
<A>__{in samantha's lap her fingers unconsciously fiddle with something. damp, crumpled. the envelope. one address left.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{this address...? i... i recognize it now. i think it belongs to a friend.}
<A>__{henessey stares at her. as nathan reaches for the envelope, his coat falls open and samantha gasps; his left side is soaked with blood.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{perhaps you'd best drive.}
