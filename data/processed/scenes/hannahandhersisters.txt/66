<A>__{holly slams the door. mickey starts to walk along the sidewalk as the taxi drives off; he passes the hotel and several evening lit store windows. "i'm in love again" begins to play in the background as mickey's voice is heard.}

<D>__{afternoons.}
<A>__{a big band rendition of "you made me love you" begins as the film cuts to a hotel room. elliot and lee can be seen dancing cheek to cheek in the reflection of a mirror over a dresser. a tv sits in the corner. a lamp is on one side of the dresser; on the other side is a bucket with champagne. two half full glasses sit nearby. elliot and lee dance into view. without missing a beat, elliot picks up one of the glasses of champagne and hands it to lee. she sips. elliot sips, then puts it back down on the dresser. they embrace tightly, continuing to dance.}
