<A>__{franklin, on his back, his face and body drenched with sweat, is asleep in his bunk in the boat. he awakens to the sound of the pounding. voices are calling him accompanied by fists smashing at the door. he opens his eyes and is disoriented. he tries to sit up momentarily forgetting that he can't. he lifts the sheet and visibly winces in disgust at the sight of his crippled legs. bones covered by flesh with barely an ounce of muscle. finally the door bursts open. two young crewman, eugene and stanley enter.}

<D>__{mr. roosevelt, we got a storm comin'!}
<A>__{he lifts franklin over his shoulder. stanley grabs clothes and pulls a set of long iron leg braces from a hook off the wall. eugene grabs a bucket and holds franklin up to urinate.}

<D>__{leave me here. let the ocean swallow me up. burial at sea. perfect for a navy man.}
<A>__{stripped to his underwear franklin is laid across the bunk. eugene kneels and puts on franklin's socks and shoes. then he and stanley slide on his braces and pants. their hands zipper, clasp, buckle and tie. each hand works in synchronicity with the other. clumsily they lift franklin up, struggling under his weight.}
