<L>__{interior harolday's office day}
<A>__{panning shot on harolday as he sits at the desk working on a ledger. the sound of a door opening is heard. harolday looks up casually as if expecting a customer, then suddenly gapes. camera pans to include doorway in which stands rocklin.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{howdy...}
<C>__{harolday}
<P>__{(frowning)}
<D>__{i thought i sent you up to table top.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{harolday}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(taking off his hat)}
<D>__{well, this, for one thing.}
<A>__{he pokes a finger through the hole in the crown. harolday's eyes narrow.}
<C>__{harolday}
<P>__{(after a little pause)}
<D>__{i told you you'd regret letting that rat clews off so easy.}
<A>__{rocklin looks at him with a queer expression without replying.}
<C>__{harolday}
<D>__{what's the matter? don't you think it was him, then?}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{i been figgerin'. don't seem reasonable clews was in condition to take that sort of chance alone... besides how could he have known i was up there that soon. and george clews ain't the only one i've run contrariwise to in this town. there's that mexican, for instance.}
<C>__{harolday}
<D>__{juan?}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{he as good as told me yesterday that him and me was due for a run in one of those days.}
<P>__{(suddenly nodding toward window)}
<D>__{and then there's him!}
<A>__{harolday looks sharply toward the window.}
