<L>__{interior proximo's school proximo's chamber night}
<A>__{proximo sits on a terrace overlooking his compound, sipping wine. various gladiators can be seen working out below. a guard brings maximus. proximo nods for the guard to leave.}
<C>__{proximo}
<P>__{(holding up a plate)}
<D>__{butterfly?}
<A>__{the plate is filled with honeyed butterflies, their wings still moving slightly. maximus shakes his head. proximo pops one into his mouth. he chews as he looks at maximus.}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{perhaps you'd like a woman?}
<A>__{maximus shakes his head.}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{boy?}
<A>__{maximus shakes his head. a beat.}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{gold?}
<A>__{maximus shakes his head.}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{well, i have nothing left to offer you! a man who turns down a butterfly, a woman, a boy and gold confuses me. personally, i'd grab them all and then grab some more because the gods are fanciful and take us at their whim. does the spaniard have any needs?}
<A>__{maximus shakes his head. a beat. proximo studies him.}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{you fight like a soldier. you have wounds like a soldier who has been on long campaigns. you eye the world around you like an enemy. what is your name, roman soldier?}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{gladiator.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{and nothing more?}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{nothing more.}
<A>__{a beat. proximo watches maximus very closely for the following:}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{in two days we leave for rome.}
<A>__{maximus' eyes suddenly flash to proximo. he is transfixed, his eyes burning.}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{ah... so it's rome you want. well you shall have her, gladiator. the new emperor has ordered a series of matches to culminate in a grand spectacle. if you do well i shall become very, very rich. if you do well enough i shall set you free. is it freedom you want?}
<A>__{a beat. maximus shakes his head.}
<C>__{proximo}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{not even that.}
<C>__{maximus}
<P>__{(barely controlled)}
<D>__{the emperor will he be there?}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{oh yes. he's apparently quite mad about the games. spending a fortune, which is, needless to say, good for me again. but what is good for you, gladiator?}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{have you how does one meet the emperor?}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{as a gladiator?}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{one doesn't.}
<A>__{a beat. proximo sees that maximus' mind is racing.}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{except... if one has proven oneself in battle. if at the end of the games you are the final man standing the emperor will present you with a small wooden sword. the sword is your freedom.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{he give it personally?}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{he did to me...}
<P>__{(maximus is surprised at this)}
<D>__{our great father marcus aurelius looked into my eyes and touched me on the shoulder.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{you knew marcus?}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{i didn't know him. he touched me on the shoulder. just once. but that was enough.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{all right, gladiator. we shall go to rome together and have bloody adventures. the great whore will suckle us until we are fat and happy and can't suck another drop. that is rome.}
