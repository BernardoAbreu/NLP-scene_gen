<L>__{interior intelligence tent day}
<A>__{three bookish corporals hover over map tables like studious nerds the day before finals. they're breaking down and gridding field maps and covering them in plasticine. tedious, detailed work. one of them is tim upham, a thin, twenty four year old, patrician with gentle, thoughtful eyes behind his thick glasses. he nervously jumps at the sound of a very distant explosion, then he forces himself to concentrate on his work. miller strides in. miller i'm looking for corporal upham. upham raises his eyes from his map and re focuses. upham sir, i'm upham.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i understand you speak french and german.}
<A>__{upham yes, sir.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{do you have an accent?}
<A>__{upham a slight one in french. my german is clean. it has a touch of the bavarian.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{good, you've been re assigned to me, we're going to ramelle.}
<A>__{upham knows enough geography to know what that means. upham uh, sir, there are germans up at ramelle.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{that's my understanding.}
<A>__{upham lots of them.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{do you have a problem with that, corporal?}
<A>__{upham sir, i've never been in combat. i make maps. i translate.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i need a translator, all mine have been killed.}
<A>__{upham but, sir, i haven't held a gun since basic training.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{it'll come back to you. get your gear.}
<A>__{upham hesitates. upham sir, may i bring my typewriter? miller looks at him closely, not sure if he's joking. upham i'm writing a book and i... miller's expression gives him his answer. upham uh, how about a pencil?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{a small one.}
<A>__{miller shoos him off.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{go, go...}
<A>__{upham scurries away. miller sighs.}
