<L>__{exterior desert highway (night)}
<A>__{far off in the distance, the glow of motorcycle headlights racing toward us. as we zoom out and focus in, they are already too close to avoid. they rip by us, thundering explosions and men and women cheering. the pack of about ten bikers and their women dont wear helmets. they fly down the highway using both lanes, drinking and driving with total abandon. angle on the lead motorcycle, a massive, custom made harley. gregory lowfield, thomas j. anderson without a desk job, without cares, revs his bike and locks the accelerator. he hands his beer to the blonde who rides behind him, then, in one swift motion, jumps up on his seat, leaning into the slipstream.}
<D>__{the feat is impossible.}
<A>__{his girlfriend, chandra, screams at him as she grasps the seat and lowers herself to the bike.}
<C>__{chandra}
<D>__{greg, are you fucking crazy?}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{yes. but dont worry.}
<A>__{she clings to his legs as they barrel down the highway. they blast pass a darkened cruiser.}
