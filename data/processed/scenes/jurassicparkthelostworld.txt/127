<L>__{interior worker hotel night}
<A>__{nick and malcolm hurry inside and slam the door behind them. they're standing in the lobby of a hotel of some kind, probably used for overnight guests and day workers who had to spend the night. the room and staircase wind around a large, open aired central area four stories tall. they shout at each other, frantic.}

<D>__{you could }
<A>__{with a crash, the wood sprinters around the lock and the door swings open violently. malcolm is thrown aside, landing hard on the floor. a velociraptor stands hissing in the doorway. nick throws his weight against the door. slamming it hard against the raptor. malcolm rolls over and paws the gun off his back. slam! the raptor charges the door again, this time blasting it off its hinges, knocking nick to the floor beneath it. the raptor turns and snarls at malcolm. malcolm swings the gun around the raptor lunges at him malcolm's finger closes on the trigger and the raptor lands on top of him. the weight of the animal crushes him into the floor, but the gun barrel now stands between them. the raptor chomps down hard on the barrel, its teeth grinding on the metal, and snaps its head, to tear it from malcolm's hands. malcolm pulls the trigger. the raptor's eyes pop wide as the dart slams into the back of its throat. it makes a gurgling sound, then convulses violently and rolls off of malcolm, yanking the gun from his hands as it falls and dies. nick scrambles out from under the door. malcolm tries to wrench the gun from the raptor's clenched jaws, but it won't budge.}
