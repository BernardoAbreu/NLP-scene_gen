<A>__{kate approaches a small church. mr. davies waits outside.}
<L>__{interior church aa meeting room night a few moments later}
<A>__{mr. davies walks kate into a medium sized room where about ten people are getting coffee, talking, and setting}
<B>__{chairs in a circle.}
<A>__{kate looks around the room, scoping out the people, who're very different from the crowd at the previous night's meeting several blue collar men jenny: 40 ish, with dark hair and a confident, sort of tough demeanor a few older people, and a young couple. mr. davies directs kate over to a table with coffee and}
<B>__{cookies.}
<C>__{mr. davies}
<D>__{this is a little more my speed. no one here is the slightest bit hip.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{does everybody just...kinda, you know talk here?}
<C>__{mr. davies}
<D>__{pretty much. someone leads tells their story. and then everyone else shares talks.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{so since you're taking me here does that make you my sponsor?}
<C>__{mr. davies}
<D>__{no i don't think i could do that.}
<P>__{(off kate's expression)}
<D>__{`cause, um...}
<P>__{(nervously searches)}
<D>__{...well, it could get weird. but i will help you find one if you want.}
<P>__{(gestures to the seats)}
<D>__{we should sit down.}
<A>__{kate looks around the room at everyone taking their seats.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(takes a deep breath; to mr. davies)}
<D>__{i can't believe i'm really here.}
<C>__{mr. davies}
<D>__{it gets better. weirder, maybe but better.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{the meeting has begun and everyone sits in a circle of chairs. jenny is midway through her speech.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{...all i knew about taking care of myself was fucking people over and lying to get by. i had no idea how to even look for a normal job or pay my bills on time or pay my fucking bills at all.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now i pay my bills online.}
<A>__{the group chuckles.}
<C>__{jenny }
<D>__{and i found a love in cooking. i've got my own catering business now. and...maybe i just replaced alcohol with chocolate chips and cigarettes, but still...it's been years since i woke up in a park in a different state.}
<B>__{laughter.}
<A>__{kate leans in towards mr. davies and whispers }
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i kinda like her.}
<C>__{mr. davies}
<D>__{sponsor potential?}
<A>__{kate nods.}
<C>__{mr. davies }
<D>__{get her number at break.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i feel like you're my wingman.}
<A>__{kate grins at mr. davies, who smiles shyly and glances away.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{an older man arlo stands and announces.}
<C>__{arlo}
<D>__{arlo, alcoholic. there'll now be a ten minute break. smoke em' if you got em.}
<A>__{as some of the people go outside kate walks over to jenny, who's getting a cup of coffee.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{hey, i liked your speech.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{thanks. all that dumb shit happened so i'm glad that now it's at least entertaining.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{kate. this is my first meeting. or... first meeting where i'm not wasted.}
<A>__{jenny laughs.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{oh, yeah i remember doing some of that.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i don't really know how this stuff works.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{but...could i get your number? i mean, i may not need it, but...}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{yeah, of course. i can help explain it to you and also, we can just talk.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{okay. yeah.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you've been sober since you were 24?}
<A>__{jenny nods.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{that seems really young.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i didn't have much of a choice i crashed my car into a nursing home.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i think the break is just about over. this meeting is the kind where everyone can share. sharing always helps me, so...if it's not too weird try introducing yourself and telling the group what's going on.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{everyone is sitting down and sharing. the woman (tina) next to kate is finishing up.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{...anyway, that's where i'm at today. thanks for listening.}
<A>__{everyone looks at kate.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{okay, um...hello. i'm kate and...}
<P>__{(long beat)}
<D>__{...i'm an alcoholic?}
<A>__{kate nervously laughs.}
<C>__{group}
<D>__{hi, kate.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{sorry. i don't mean to laugh it's just saying those words...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{...i think i'm an alcoholic, but i don't really know. i drink a lot. i've always drank. everyone i know drinks a lot. i never really thought i had a problem lately though it seems like maybe i do. i just want to be able to drink a beer without it turning into twenty or wetting my bed.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it seems like every time i drink something awful happens. all the shit that i used to laugh off isn't really funny anymore. the dumb drunk stuff has gone from embarrassing to scary.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm kinda...scared.}
<A>__{kate stops. looks around self consciously.}
