<L>__{interior allison's office day}
<A>__{trevor jumps scaring the hell out of allison who has just gotten done taking his pulse.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{jesus i wish you would stop doing that.}
<A>__{trevor looks down at himself. he's on an examination table in his normal clothes not a hospital johnnie. that's a good sign.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{allison...}
<A>__{trevor tries to put his thoughts together.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{well trevor? what have you got to say for yourself? que pasa?}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(voice quivering)}
<D>__{allison we have got to talk about this medication you've got me on.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{i'm all over it.}
<A>__{allison shines a penlight in his eye.}
<C>__{allison }
<D>__{blink.}
<A>__{trevor blinks. satisfied, allison sits on the bed next to trevor and takes his hand.}
<C>__{allison }
<D>__{okay. what we're going to do is up the topomax to two per day instead of one, see if that takes care of these hallucinatory seizures you've been having. the extra topomax won't interfere with the painkillers either but... you're going to be thrilled to hear this part but we have been told by some patients it affects the memory somewhat...}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(weary)}
<D>__{really? does it affect the memory?}
<A>__{allison looks concerned. then her features soften.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{you're one tough cookie, trevor gooding. you keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{some call it resilience. others, stupidity.}
<A>__{allison lets a lapse in the conversation last too long. that look of concern returns as she lingers on his face. she's trying to say something.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{everything okay allison?}
<C>__{allison}
<P>__{(surprised at her own emotional outflow)}
<D>__{of course, yes.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{the way you just looked at me...}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{i know, my bedside manner's horrendous.}
<A>__{allison finishes writing a few notes, and trevors rolls down his sleves. he's intrigued.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{so, i'm done. thats it for today?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{all finished.}
<A>__{neither of them want this visit to be over.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{how bout some lunch?}
