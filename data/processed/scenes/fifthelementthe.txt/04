<A>__{omar makes his way uneasily down a pillared corridor that opens into a vast room where an old scientist stands on a small wooden ladder in front of the wall across the room. professor massimo pacoli. a young man is beside him, billy masterson, age 25, an american student. he has a large sketchpad in his hands. behind them aziz, age 10, whose job is to hold the last mirror which shines light into the expansive room.}
<C>__{professor}
<P>__{(deciphering)}
<D>__{"..when the three planets are in eclipse.."}
<A>__{his fingers trace across the wall which is covered with symbols and strange hieroglyphs as he deciphers.}
<C>__{professor}
<D>__{"..the black hole like a door is open... evil comes ... sowing terror and chaos..." see? the snake, billy. the ultimate evil ... make sure you get the snake!}
<A>__{the professor points emphatically to the snake, the symbol of evil, coming through the door between the three planets in eclipse. c.u. billy's hand sketches the snake quickly. he is a natural artist.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{and when is this door opening snake act supposed to occur?}

<C>__{professor}
<D>__{every five thousand years..}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(kidding)}
<D>__{so i have some time..}
<A>__{he reaches for the pad. angle on: omar. standing at the entrance to the chamber with the water bag, entranced by the sight. a skeletal hand falls on his shoulder. omar turns to an ancient priest in a rough milled black cannock.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{i will take it to them my son.}
<A>__{startled but obedient, omar gives the water bag to the priest.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{go with god.. be safe from evil..}
<A>__{the priest makes the sign of the cross on the boy's forehead, dismissing him. as soon as he is gone, the priest turns a worried eye to the professor. angle on: the professor is back to translating, billy to sketching.}
<C>__{professor}
<D>__{"..then arrange the elements of life against the terror just so.."}
<A>__{his fingers run on.}
<C>__{professor}
<D>__{"..water..fire..earth..air..four elements around the fifth.."}
<A>__{his fingers fall on the one element that has a human shape, surrounded by all the others. the priest opens the water skin and begins to pour a vial of powder into the skin. angle on: aziz falling asleep. the mirror falls, the light fails.}
<C>__{professor}
<D>__{aziz! light!}
<A>__{the boy struggles to stay awake. the mirror comes up.}
<C>__{priest}

<D>__{amen..}
<A>__{the professor turns to the priest who is pouring water into a tin cup from the skin.}
<C>__{professor}
<D>__{father.. it in the most extraordinary thing.. the greatest find in history..can you imagine the implications.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{only too well... here you must be parched..}
<A>__{he hands the cup to the professor. the professor takes it, has it almost to his lips when..}
<C>__{professor}
<D>__{i mean look.. it is like a battle plan..}
<A>__{in his excitement he does not drink, much to the priest's chagrin.}
<C>__{professor}
<D>__{here the good.. here the evil..}
<A>__{as the priest looks up, aziz the mirror boy, tips his mouth under the water skin, drinking the leakage.}
<C>__{professor}
<D>__{here..}
<A>__{he points to the five elements.}
<C>__{professor}
