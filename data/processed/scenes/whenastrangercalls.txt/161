<A>__{he closes his eyes and is asleep. jill stands up, turns and starts to walk out of the room. halfway across the floor, jill stops. she stands rigid as a thought penetrates her own drowsiness. she turns very slowly and moves to the closet in the children's bedroom. she stands before it a moment. then she reaches her hand forward for the knob on the closet door. she very slowly pulls the door open. she looks inside. there is nothing. jill quietly closes the closet door and leaves the room.}
