<L>__{interior paradise falls gas 'n' grub continuous}
<A>__{a jingle as the old lady enters. she surveys the scene as if feasting on paradise. maybe her eyes aren't so good.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{have a seat wherever you want, ma'am. specials are on the board.}
<C>__{old woman}
<D>__{thank you, dear.}
<A>__{the old lady settles at a table across from the andersons. she smiles at them pleasantly. charlie is about to hand her a menu, when:}
<C>__{old woman}
<D>__{oh, i already know what i want.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{okay, what'll it be?}
<C>__{old woman}
<D>__{i will have the steak, please.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{and how'd you like that cooked?}
<C>__{old woman}
<D>__{rare if you would. and water, no ice.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{coming right up.}
<C>__{old woman}
<D>__{charlie, is it?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{old woman}
<D>__{what an unusual name for a girl.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{so they say. i will be right back with your water.}
<A>__{the old lady turns to the andersons.}
<C>__{old woman}
<D>__{hello, i'm gladys. gladys foster.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{nice to meet you, gladys. i'm sandra and this is my husband howard.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{what a nice young couple you are. what brings you out to these parts?}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{we're moving out to scottsdale. but our truck broke down, and so we're stuck here while it's being fixed.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{oh, what a nuisance.}
<A>__{a fly begins to buzz around gladys's head. she doesn't seem to notice it.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{say, gladys, it seems the lines are down around here. the phone and tv, you know?}
<C>__{sandra }
<D>__{and i just was wondering if you might have heard something on your way up? you know, about what's going on?}
<A>__{gladys smiles strangely.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{oh, don't worry yourself about that, sweetheart. it'll all be over soon.}
<A>__{sandra nods at the old woman, unsure of what to make of that response. the fly that was circling her head, now lands on gladys's face. it crawls across her cheek without her reacting in the least. howard and sandra exchange looks. creepy. the door jingles and jeep walks in. he heads straight for a quiet huddle with bob. all the while though, he keeps one eye fixed on the old lady sitting at the table near the andersons. something about her...}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{the carburetor's shot. don't know why. looks brand new.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(glances over at the andersons)}
<D>__{ah, shit. they're gonna be pissed.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{i could try to rebuild it, but it'd take a while, and i don't think we have all the parts. if we call right now, we might be able to get a new one down here tomorrow morning.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{that's not gonna happen. goddamn phone's out.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{across the diner, charlie places a bloody red steak in front of gladys.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{thank you, dear. how far along are you?}
<A>__{charlie rests a hand on her belly.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{just about there.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{the father must be very proud.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i wouldn't know.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{you mean he's...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{out of sight. out of mind.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{oh, i see. so you're not married, i take it?}
<A>__{a fly lands on gladys's steak. charlie tries to wave it away. but another one lands in its place.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{nope.}
<A>__{gladys starts to dig in to the steak with a real ferociousness you wouldn't expect from an old lady. more flies begin to land on her body. on her food. charlie is still trying to wave them away.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{that's too bad.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no, i prefer it that way. i don't a need a man tellin' me what to do.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{but what about the baby?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i've got it under control.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{yeah, but it's gonna burn.}
<A>__{charlie freezes. the andersons turn to look as well. kyle glances over from the counter.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what did you just say?}
<C>__{gladys}
<P>__{(all smiles)}
<D>__{i said your fucking baby's gonna burn.}
<A>__{charlie shakes her head at the woman, not giving in.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{go to hell, lady.}
<A>__{she slaps the check down on the table and walks back toward the kitchen, passing jeep and bob.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{total fucking jesus freak.}
<A>__{gladys begins to laugh innocently as she continues to devour her meat. red juice drips down her chin. the flies are swarming now. how did so many get in here? sandra and howard are mortified at this sudden turn of events.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{all those babies. they're gonna burn.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{gladys, please. there's no reason to }
<A>__{gladys's head suddenly whips toward her.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{shut up, you stupid fucking cunt! all you do is complain! complain! complain!}
<A>__{sandra covers her mouth in shock. everybody in the diner is now focused on the old lady. howard gets up from the booth.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{howard, it's okay! don't listen to her!}
<A>__{but howard's already standing over gladys.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{who the hell do you think you are, lady?! now, i'd like you to apologize to my }
<B>__{gladys lunges at howard and takes a monstrous bite out of his}
<A>__{neck! she pulls back to reveal a mouth filled with tiny}
<B>__{razor sharp teeth.}
<A>__{everybody freaks as howard crumbles to the floor. gladys rockets to her feet, knocking her table over. blood covers her face and chest.}
<C>__{gladys}
<D>__{you're all going to fucking die!}
<A>__{percy is the first to react. from behind the counter, he whips a heavy metal frying pan at gladys that knocks her head sideways. thwack! bones break and burst from her neck. impossibly, gladys is still standing. she lets out an inhuman scream and scrambles across the diner, knocking tables and chairs over in her wake. bob pulls a shotgun from behind the counter.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{don't move!}
<A>__{but gladys not only moves, she scurries right up the fucking wall like some kind of bizarre crab! bob can't believe his eyes. but he gets over it real fast, as the crab lady rushes toward him across the ceiling upside down! bob pumps the shotgun, trying to take her down, but he can't track her fast enough. instead he blows enormous holes in the ceiling, a rain of plaster. gladys drops down right in front of bob.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(struggles to cock the gun)}
<D>__{fuck!}
<A>__{gladys smiles sweetly before slapping him clear across the room! the shotgun clatters to the floor at jeep's feet. he snatches it up and aims it at gladys who turns calmly to face him.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{shoot her, jeep!}
<A>__{jeep's about to fire, when the old lady's eyes go all white.}
<C>__{gladys}
<P>__{(a sickly sweet smile)}
<D>__{you'll never save her.}
<A>__{jeep freezes, stunned by her words, overwhelming fear paralyzing him where he stands.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{shoot the fucking bitch!}
<A>__{gladys rockets straight at him! but jeep's too afraid to move. he clamps his eyes shut, bracing himself for the end. blam! blam! blam! a rain of bullets rip into gladys, taking her down like an animal. jeep slowly opens his eyes. his gun's still cocked. gladys lies dead in a smoldering, bloody heap at his feet. he turns to see kyle with smoke rising from the barrel of his silver plated western arms 45. if everyone wasn't so shocked, they'd probably be wondering why this guy is packing such serious heat.}
<C>__{sandra }
<D>__{somebody help me!}
<A>__{sandra is on the floor with her husband. blood pours freely from his neck. kyle stares at the dying man a moment of hesitation then he rushes to help.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{press your hands over the hole!}
<A>__{sandra looks fearfully up at kyle, at the gun still in his hand.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{don't look at me like that, lady! i'm tryin' to fuckin' help you! now put your goddamn hands over the hole before your husband bleeds to death!}
<A>__{obeying, she cups her hands over the hole in his neck, desperately trying to stop the flow of blood leaking out between her fingers. percy scrambles over with a first aid kit and together he and kyle get to work on howard's neck. a few feet away, charlie helps bob, bruised and bleeding, to his feet.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{the fuck was that?! what the fuck was that!?}
<A>__{across the diner, audrey is pushed back into a booth, her knees pulled tightly to her chest, shivering. her adult facade giving way to that of a frightened child a drop of red hits audrey's cheek, causing her to look up and see gladys's trail of blood dripping from the ceiling. an ungodly horror.}
