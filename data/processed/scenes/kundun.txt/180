<A>__{we see a mandala a beautiful, intricate, sand painting. the home of kalachakra.}
<C>__{tenzin gyatso }
<D>__{"thus by the virtue collected through all that i have done, may the pain of every living creature be completely cleared away."}
<A>__{the whole screen becomes this mandala as the chanting an cymbals and deep resonating sounds of the song continue and then, a hand comes into the mandala and begins to sweep it up. pull back to see that the hand belongs to tenzin gyatso. tenzin gyatso collects the ground particles of tibetan quartz and rock. he destroys the painstakingly lovely sand painting. the chanting becomes louder and louder and it mixes with the sound of the river.}
