<A>__{mumford carries a large fed ex box down a side street and into an alley. as he passes a secluded space created by two adjacent buildings, something catches his eye. mumford's moving pov: a young couple is embracing and talking intimately. as they separate, we can see that it is nessa and martin brockett. martin sees mumford, but makes no sign. nessa twists to see what martin's looking at just as the view is interrupted by a wall. mumford walks on, mulling what he's seen.}
