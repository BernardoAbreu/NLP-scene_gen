<L>__{interior event horizon bridge}
<A>__{miller stands in the doorway. a figure sits at the helm. miller aims the nailgun.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{weir.}
<A>__{the figure doesn't move. miller slowly circles around the helm... it's starck. bound with wire in a sadomasochistic pose, unconscious.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{hold on... get you outta these...}
<A>__{miller kneels in front of her, puts down the nailgun, loosens the cords. she breathes in ragged gasps, opens his eyes... then stops. she stares over miller's shoulder like a deer caught in the headlights. miller looks behind him... weir stands there, staring with eyes sewn shut. miller reaches for the gun... weir hits him, sending miller across the bridge into a bulkhead. weir picks up the nailgun, examines it. miller slowly gets to his feet.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{your eyes...}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{i don't need them anymore. where we're going, we won't need eyes to see.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{do you know what a singularity is, miller? does your mind truly fathom what a black hole is?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it is nothing. absolute and eternal nothing. and if god is everything, then i have seen the devil.}
<P>__{(a dead man's grin)}
<D>__{it's a liberating experience.}
<A>__{with his free hand, weir reaches for the navigation console. flips a series of switches with gore caked fingers.}
