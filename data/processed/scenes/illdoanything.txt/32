<L>__{interior movie theater evening}
<A>__{nan is addressing the audience from down front.}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{the name of the picture you'll be seeing is 'ground zero'... there may be some scratches... some of the colors may be off, there are no final titles, and it has not been finally mixed for sound, and the music is temp, that means temporary...}
<A>__{as she says this:}
<B>__{angle on rear of house}
<A>__{where burke spies the studio head and leaves matt's side.}
<B>__{on studio head}
<A>__{as burke enters the frame behind him. he is right behind his boss' ear. he leans in and offers an intimacy.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{i'm glad you came yourself instead of sending your staff.}
<A>__{the boss is startled jumps. burke eyes him... there must be some way to profit from these stolen moments with a powerful man.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{i wouldn't be surprised if tonight's screening is a monster.}
<P>__{(emphatically)}
<D>__{could happen, right?}
<C>__{studio head}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{he moves back to matt and nan at the rear of the audience.}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(to matt)}
<D>__{eisner just said he thinks the screening will be a monster.}
<A>__{strangely, burke seems truly buoyed by the words of encouragement he himself manufactured. he moves down three rows and sits in an aisle seat just as the film opens with a series of violent explosions.}
<B>__{close on nan}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{please, god, let tonight give him peace.}
<A>__{incredibly, burke turns and gestures to her that the sound of her small voice is interfering with the cacophony of his movie. nan is clearly stricken by her lapse as she whispers to matt.}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{we're short two card counters, can you two help out?}
