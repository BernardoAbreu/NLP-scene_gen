<T>__{wipe to:}
<L>__{exterior far side of butte twilight}
<A>__{martin and brad, riding in a direction opposite to that in which they had taken off indicating their circle route haul up momentarily as they spot ethan, standing beside his horse, his back to them, some distance along. they turn slightly off their course and ride out toward him.}
<L>__{exterior open country near butte twilight}
<A>__{ethan turns, almost startled, as the two youths ride in. his serape is no longer behind his saddle. ethan looks at them blankly for a minute as though not really seeing them.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{oh... it's you.}
<A>__{they both stare at him.}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(a vague gesture)}
<D>__{i... uh... here's where they met up again...}
<A>__{they both can see that.}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{trail leads off there...}
<A>__{they look at him and each other for these are clearly unnecessary remarks and doubly surprising coming from ethan.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{why'd they break off?}
<P>__{(no answer)}
<D>__{was there water in that canyon?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{huh...? no... no water.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{you all right, ethan?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{huh...?}
<P>__{(more like his usual gruff self)}
<D>__{sure i'm all right...}
<A>__{he goes to his horse, mounts. martin is right beside him and he notes the missing serape.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{say!... what happened to your blanket? lose it?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{must've... anyway, i ain't goin' back to look for it...}
<A>__{he leads out. brad rides up beside martin. again the two exchange puzzled looks. martin shrugs and the three continue along the broad trace of the indian ponies into the setting sun.}
