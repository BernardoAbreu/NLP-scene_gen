<L>__{exterior paradise falls gas `n' grub continuous}
<A>__{the escalade pulls off the highway and rolls to a stop at the lonely row of old gas pumps. kyle gets out and surveys the scenery with dismay. now in the daytime we see this is truly a place time forgot. attached to the diner is a mechanic's bay. grease stains and rusty car parts litter the ground. behind the place is the silverstream trailer we saw jeep step out of earlier. the only thing here that looks fairly new is the uhaul truck parked in front of the garage with its hood up. kyle grabs a crumpled hand drawn map from the front seat and flattens it out on the roof of the car. he spins it around. which way is north?}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{darren, your fuckin' directions suck, man.}
<A>__{he checks his cell phone again. no chance of a signal way out here. so he shuffles around to the side of the diner in search of a pay phone. the good news is that he finds one. the bad news is that it's been broken for ten years. leaning next to the broken phone, however, is charlie wearing a shabby, faded waitress uniform stretched tight around her very pregnant belly. adding to her perfect mother to be look is that cigarette dangling from her lips. the plastic name tag pinned to her chest says "charlie".}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{hey...}
<A>__{she eyes him, mildly intrigued, takes a drag.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{you know that shit right there ain't good for the baby.}
<A>__{she lets out a long slow exhale.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{guess i should think `bout quittin' then.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{now hold on, girl, let me bum one before you do.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you can buy a whole pack inside.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{tell ya what. you let me have one of yours, and i will give you two from the new pack you're gonna sell me.}
<A>__{she considers him for a moment, then pulls out a cigarette. lights it off the end of hers then hands it to him. kyle takes a drag, pulls out his crumpled map.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{am i in the right place?}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(peers at the map)}
<D>__{only if nowhere's right, `cause that's where you are.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{sonuvabitch. there another phone around here? you know, one that works?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{bob'll probably let you use the diner phone if you ask him real nice...and pay `im somethin'.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{i can handle that. you got pancakes here?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yeah, we got a buttermilk stack for three seventy five. we also got french toast for four dollars if you're into that. i personally like the pancakes though.}
<C>__{jeep }
<D>__{you okay, charlie?}
<A>__{they both turn to see jeep behind the diner, wearing mechanic's coveralls and holding a dusty old crib. charlie quickly hides her cigarette behind her back. busted.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yeah, i'm okay. this guy's just lost.}
<A>__{jeep nods, uncertain, eyes kyle another moment, then he shuffles along out of sight. charlie brings the cigarette back up to her lips. an awkward beat.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{three seventy five, huh?}
