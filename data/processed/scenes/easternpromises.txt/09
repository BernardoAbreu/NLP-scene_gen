<L>__{exterior london street day}
<D>__{anna rides her big vintage ural motorcycle through deserted morning streets. as she rides, we hear tatiana in v.o.}
<C>__{tatiana }
<D>__{i am so excited this morning. yesterday a friend came back to our village and he told us all about the places on the map that i look at... paris, amsterdam, london. he's been there for real...}
<L>__{interior helen's house. anna's bedroom day}
<D>__{after the bright airiness of the bike ride, we are suddenly in anna's bedroom where the curtains are drawn. anna is lying awake on the bed, wearing a dressing gown.}
<C>__{tatiana }
<D>__{...he said the future of everything was already happening in all those places. there is a gentle knock at the door, which opens before anna can respond. it is anna's mother (helen) with a cup of tea.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{did you sleep?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{a bit.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{there's no point us tiptoeing around if you're not even sleeping. helen puts the tea on the dressing table, then turns to leave without a smile.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{mum? are you ok?}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(contrite)}
<D>__{of course not. it's christmas.}
