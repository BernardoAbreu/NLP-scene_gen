<L>__{exterior kuhio park night}
<B>__{long shot}
<A>__{in b.g. warden, in uniform, and karen are sitting on the same bench as in their first meeting in the park. we cannot hear what they are saying at first. camera moves in past a few pedestrians and holds on a medium shot. there is a defeated, tired look about them, as if they have been talking for a long time to no avail.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{... i guess i felt it that night i asked you to become an officer. when you didn't say yes right away.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i guess i knew deep down you wouldn't do it. but }
<P>__{(a hint of tears)}
<D>__{it seemed such a simple plan for us...}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{i wanted to i tried but i couldn't...}
<A>__{he runs his hand through his hair. he seems to be groping inside himself for some way to explain.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{lissen there's a kid in our outfit named prewitt... robert e. lee prewitt... he came in from the states about a year ago. i thought he was a fresh punk at first... until i got to know him a little. he's awol right now probly in some kind of real trouble he ain't the kind to go awol otherwise. anyway, i keep remembering somethin he said to me the first day he came in. he said a man has got to go his own way... if he don't, he's nothin... i'm an enlisted man. i'm a first sergeant. milt warden. once i cross that line and tried to be an officer, i'm somebody i don't know. a stranger. and a man has got to be what he is...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i guess that's the trouble with dana... he's always tried to be something he isn't. poor dana... i don't think he ever needed me until now.}
<P>__{(shaken herself out of it)}
<D>__{well, here we are saying goodbye. and talking about two other people.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{we're not saying good bye we'll figger out a way for you to stay here }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i'm going back with him, milt. there's something in being needed. it isn't love. but it's something.}
<C>__{warden}
<P>__{(desperately)}
<D>__{lissen, two people who love each other just don't stop loving each other! nothin and nobody is goin to break us up l 1111 transfer out somehow and get back to the states. maybe it'll take a little time but i will do it!}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{that sounds like milt warden, all right.}
<A>__{he bends toward her to kiss her. she presses him back.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{no, milt. i don't want to kiss you any more. i just want to remember you. and you to remember me.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{put it down. put it down that on december 6th, 1941, milton anthony warden told you he'd remember you...}
<A>__{camera pulls back, passes a few pedestrians, warden and karen remaining in b.g. of shot. they begin to talk again, quietly, undemonstratively. we are too far away now to hear what they are saying.}
