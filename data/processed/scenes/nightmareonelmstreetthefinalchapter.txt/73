<L>__{exterior nightmare springwood parnell ave. night}
<A>__{karen rounds a corner. she walks nervously down the middle of the street. there are no cars, and she wants to keep as far away as possible from the houses on either side. there is a creaking sound from one of those houses. karen turns her head to look. a craggy old woman is rocking back and forth on her front porch. she's eating something, something stringy and slimy. she munches away with a vacant look in her eyes. the something in her hands moves slightly. the old woman's meal is still alive. karen gags and walks faster. and a panting sound is heard, like two dogs. someone is walking their pet down the sidewalk. it's the mutant woman from jacob's opening nightmare: straggly hair, oozing sores, limping. the source of the multiple paintings is her single dog, all two heads of it. the mutant woman waves unpleasantly at karen. karen whimpers and starts to run. with karen running she stumbles quickly down the street. we catch fleeting glimpses of other horrors, twisted shapes, bent shadows. karen rounds a corner, and screams when she bumps into someone. it's scott, out of breath from his own sprinting.}
