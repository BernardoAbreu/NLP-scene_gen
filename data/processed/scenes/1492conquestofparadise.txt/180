<L>__{exterior columbus' manor house day}
<A>__{columbus dismounts in the courtyard. everything seems deserted. there's no one about, no sign of life...}
<L>__{interior manor house day}
<A>__{columbus walks slowly through the great rooms. there is nothing left: no furniture, rugs, pictures... nothing. he turns, sees beatrix standing in a doorway, looking back at him. they are both moved.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{god... you're so beautiful! i can't believe no other man has ever taken you away from me...}
<C>__{beatrix}
<D>__{they tried... but i didn't let them.}
<A>__{she smiles. they don't dare to touch. beatrix looks round the empty room.}
<C>__{beatrix}
<D>__{they took everything...}
<C>__{columbus}
<P>__{(looking at her)}
<D>__{not everything... do you think i care? i'm a free man again. riches don't make a man rich, they only make him busier...}
<A>__{they laugh. there's a pause.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{god, how much i've missed you!}
<A>__{and they throw themselves into each other's arms.}
