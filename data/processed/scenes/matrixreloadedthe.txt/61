<L>__{exterior lake shore}
<A>__{the desert is gone, replaced by forest, though still under the poisoned sky of the matrix. gregory laps the water up, and pulls chandra in, rubbing the water over her face. calmly, agent smith stands on the lake shore. cu: agent smith. the humans are reflected in his perfectly still glasses. chandra stirs and awakens, though she doesnt seem to see smith. gregory, revitalized, looks around at the miracle, and up at the mystery man.}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{who the fuck are you? smith grins devilishly.}
<C>__{agent smith}
<A>__{"im nobody. a smith. whats more important, is you. we need you,}
<D>__{gregory."}
<A>__{gregory stares. he pulls chandra ashore and stands to look agent smith in the eyes.}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{first you try to kill me. now you need me.}
<C>__{agent smith}
<A>__{"two years ago, gregory, your parents were killed in a terrorist}
<D>__{attack in the heart of the city." the words spark something nasty in gregory.}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{so what?}
<C>__{agent smith}
<D>__{the terrorists were led by a certain individual.}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{i know who it was.}
<C>__{agent smith}
<D>__{we need you to kill him.}
<A>__{gregory laughs he turns to chandra to check on her. shes passed out on the smooth grass.}
<C>__{gregory}
<A>__{"what a bunch of bullshit. the whole government cant kill him, so how}
<D>__{can i?"}
<C>__{agent smith}
<D>__{no one in the government can do what you can.}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<C>__{agent smith}
<D>__{i believe we have a deal. gregory stands and puts his face next to smiths}
<A>__{"you know, ive always wanted to fuck the devil on a deal. and this}
<D>__{looks like a once in a lifetime opportunity. so, fuck you!"}
<A>__{smith frowns. gregory looks him up and down. hes got a few inches and pounds on the smaller agent.}
<C>__{gregory}
<A>__{"what are you gonna do, little man? you looking for a trip to the fucking hospital? fuck with me and youll be looking for some plastic}
<D>__{surgery, you "}
<A>__{smith delivers a chest punch that sends gregory sailing back twenty feet. he tumbles to a stop, coughs, and stares in disbelief at smith, standing calmly at what seems like an impossible distance away. cu: smith. he removes his glasses calmly. cu: gregory. he was stunned, but hes not out of the fight. not by a long shot.}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{no man can beat me.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{bring it on, pussy. pull back as he charges smith}
<A>__{smith is ready to deflect the blow, but gregory dodges and bowls him over, barroom style. with smith pinned below him, he slams his palm downward. smiths head dodges the blow that pummels the ground. gregory is screaming as he smashes downward with the palms of his heels. every blow misses the mark.}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{mother fucker, what the fu ?}
<A>__{smith bucks up, throwing gregory into the air. he flips onto his back as gregory returns. the sheer force of his street forged roundhouses knock smith around as he blocks. growing irritated at the untrained attack, smith turns a block into a palm heel that hits gregory in the forehead with the force of a cannon blast. momentarily stunned, he steps back enough for smith to perform a roundhouse kick. its like a helicopter blade, smashing into gregorys head and sending him to the ground in a heap.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{ready to change your mind?}
<A>__{cu: gregory he cant respond very well. blood fills his mouth and his face is mashed. a huge welt grows under the loafer mark left by smith on the right side of his face.}
<D>__{smith crouches down by gregory}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{i can teach you to beat me, you know. this interests gregory.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{help us, and both you and her will be free afterward.}
<A>__{gregory stares at the ground, then gazes past smith at chandra. finally, he starts to rise. smith offers a hand, and gregory takes it.}
<C>__{smith}
<A>__{"you know it, dont you? that theres more to your world than what you}
<D>__{can see, what you can rationally explain?"}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{smith}
<A>__{"im going to teach you how to use the powers you cant even imagine.}
<D>__{but first, you need to learn to fight."}
<A>__{smith puts his hand to his earpiece. gregorys eyes close and his body spasms. he falls to the ground, breathless, and when his eyes open, he stares up at smith.}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{holy shit. what the }
<A>__{he stares at his hands. he sits up, and watches his hands, amazed, as he goes through a series of block punches. he stops and stares up at}
<B>__{smith.}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{i know kung fu." smith grins.}
