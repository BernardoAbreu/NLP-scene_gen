<C>__{wilhite}
<D>__{i could give a shit. i just want to this case to get a quick burial.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{i will bet. who made the call?}
<C>__{wilhite}
<D>__{some old broad heard an `argument' and buzzed wilshire station.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{where's the family?}
<C>__{wilhite}

<C>__{me}
<D>__{why wasn't hector with `em?}
<C>__{wilhite}
<D>__{what do you think they were fighting about? santa barbara wasps don't fancy dope pushing wetbacks.}
<C>__{me}

<C>__{wilhite}
<P>__{(sneering hatred)}
<D>__{tommy. make him your #1 suspect.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{why's that?}
<C>__{wilhite}
<D>__{he's got a mean streak. and he and hector had been at each others throats for months. have tommy picked up. he likes to loaf at those nigger jazz joints in watts.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{alright, you better cut out before people start asking why the head of narco is at a missing persons.}
<A>__{wilhite gets close, still sneering:}
<C>__{wilhite}
<D>__{get a conviction. grab tommy and pin this thing fast or you'll have a whole division of disgraced cops at your front door.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{what are you talking about wilhite?}
<C>__{wilhite}
<D>__{you queered the fed's fight probe by killing that boxer and they already had a hard on for the lapd bradley sent you down here as damaged goods...think about it. everybody sees what's coming.}
<P>__{(beat, closer)}
<D>__{now close this quick.}
<A>__{wilhite bolts. i pause. clarity finally dissolving the bloodshot: this is the disaster bradley was talking about:}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{the god sized problems i triggered tossing sanderline take shape: the lapd's sanctioned dope pusher vanishes that's a pretty juicy spot to stick a new probe.}
