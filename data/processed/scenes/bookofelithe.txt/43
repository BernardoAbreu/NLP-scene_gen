<A>__{redridge finally manages to clamber back up to his feet, wincing as he clutches his painful shoulder wound. he looks up just in time to see eli coming right at him. without breaking stride, he cold cocks redridge in the jaw with the shotgun, sending him back to the deck, out cold.}

<A>__{eli kicks the door wide open, finds carnegie holding solara against the wall. she sobs, terrified. eli levels the shotgun at carnegie's head.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{let her go.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{that cannon of yours casts a pretty wide net. i don't reckon you can hit me without hitting her.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i reckon you're right.}
<A>__{he holsters the shotgun. then in the same fluid motion draws a pistol from his belt that we never even knew he had.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{this, though? with this i will shave the hairs clean off your balls at a hundred paces. you believe me?}
<A>__{carnegie releases his grip on solara, steps away, hands up.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{i believe you. i have to say i'm surprised to hear that language coming from you, though. i mean, you being a holy man and all.}
<A>__{beat. eli glances at solara.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{she told me all about it. told me all about the bible, too.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{can i see it?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{carnegie takes a small step forward. suddenly, his whole demeanor changes, and he now looks at eli imploringly.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{you know, i've been searching for a book like that one for years. all i've ever wanted was to bring the word of god to these poor unfortunates here. to shine its light upon them and give them something in this wretched world that they could believe in. something to live for! it's why i built this town, did you know that? all we've been missing is the word to show us the way. and now, praise the lord, you've brought it to us.}
<A>__{carnegie takes a step closer. he appears entirely sincere but then he is very good at doing so.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{it's not right to keep that book hidden away, all to yourself. the word is meant to be shared with others. it's meant to be spread! isn't that what you want? i could help you do that. you and me, we could do it together.}
<A>__{beat. eli seems to be considering what he's heard carefully.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{the lord himself told me that if i carried this book west, one day i would find the place where it was needed. where it would be safe. where it belonged.}
<A>__{carnegie smiles broadly... and then with a sudden blur of movement eli pistol whips him to the floor.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{but this ain't it.}
<A>__{he turns to solara and offers her his hand.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{come on.}
