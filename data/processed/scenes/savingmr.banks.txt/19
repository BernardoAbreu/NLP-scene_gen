<A>__{with its pink facade and flag flying turrets the hotel resembles a candy castle simmering under a midday sun. the limo glides into the forecourt.}
<L>__{interior suite beverly hills hotel day}
<A>__{a porter opens the door to pamela's suite and places her belongings on a luggage stand in the hallway.}
<C>__{porter}
<D>__{would you like me to unpack for you ma'am?}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{unpack?}
<C>__{porter}
<D>__{to take your items from their cases and hang them in the wardrobe ma'am.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{young man, if it is your wish to handle ladies garments i suggest you take employment in a launderette.}
<A>__{the porter has no idea what to say, he hovers at the door.}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{his eyes flick to his empty palm and back to pamela. she closes the door on him.}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{odd.}
<A>__{she turns and for the first time takes in }
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{oh my.}
<A>__{ the ludicrous suite she has been assigned; it is opulent beyond imagine but it's classy decor has been rather diminished by the array of disney gifts splattered across every surface of the room.}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{oh no, no, no.}
<A>__{disney flowers, disney champagne, disney exotic fruit baskets, disney chocolates, disney posters, cuddly donald, pluto and minnie toys and taking up the entire bed the biggest stuffed mickey mouse imaginable. imagine it. nope. bigger! pamela cannot contain her horror. she stares at it in disgust for a moment, and then her eyes fall upon three pears in the fruit basket. she stops still for a second before rushing over and picking them out. she turns them over in her hands before an enormous wave of panic washes over her.}
<C>__{pamela }
<P>__{(muttering to the pears)}
<D>__{this won't do.}
<A>__{she throws open the balcony doors for fresh air and is greeted with dry arid heat, dust, dazzling sunlight }
