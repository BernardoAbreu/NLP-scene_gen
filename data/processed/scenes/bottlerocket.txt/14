<A>__{anthony, dignan, and bob are meeting with temple. temple is in his mid fifties, short, heavy, completely expressionless wide face. they listen intently as he briefs them on the intricacies of firearms.}

<D>__{a gun is a firearm. a pistol is a firearm. but anything you hold in your hand is a weapon. a knife. a wrench. a ballpoint pen.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{a ballpoiht pen?}
<C>__{temple}
<D>__{anyone who tells you a ballpoint pen is not a weapon needs intensive psychiatric treatment. you can stick them in the esophagus. you give them a ballpoint tracheotomy.}
<A>__{they nod seriously. temple laughs.}
