<L>__{interior auditorium day}
<A>__{old tim and harry carry a dilapidated row of seats up the aisle, as adele and mabel move in, tearing up the rotten carpeting and sweeping up the dust and debris. the men are having a tough time carrying the seats, and just as they're about to drop the row, someone rushes in next to harry and grabs his end. it's carl leffert. a second later, someone else grabs old tim's end.}

<A>__{has a good purchase on the seats with his good hand and his hook. he nods to old tim, who steps away, mopping his brow. luke smiles as he sees this from the front of the auditorium.}
