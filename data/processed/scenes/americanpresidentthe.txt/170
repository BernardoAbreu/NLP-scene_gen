<D>__{have you been following this situation down in atlanta? these women want parity for girls' softball, field hockey, volleyball...}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{if i'm not mistaken, gill, i think the courts ruled on title 9 about 20 years ago.}
<C>__{green blazered man }
<D>__{yes sir, but now i'm saying these women want that law enforced.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{well, it's a world gone mad, gill.}
<A>__{lewis, kodak and robin stand huddled with cups of eggnog...}
<C>__{kodak}
<D>__{the country has mood swings.}
<C>__{lewis}
<D>__{mood swings? nineteen post graduate degrees in mathematics and you explain going from a 63 to a 46 percent approval rating in 5 weeks on mood swings?}
<C>__{kodak}
<D>__{well, i could explain it better, but i'd need charts and graphs and an easel.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{fellas, we haven't slept in three years. can't we forget work for one night and take this moment to enjoy each other as friends? it's christmas.}

<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{where you been?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i got stuck on depont circle. i can never remember which lane i'm supposed to take. then i got cut off by this idiot cab driver who starts screaming at me like it's my fault.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{syd, relax. it's christmas.}
<A>__{shepherd joins them.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{hi, syd. get stuck on dupont circle again?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{it's not funny. i hate that place. can't you declare it a federal disaster area or something?}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{i will look into it.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{what were you doing up on the hill, anyway?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{ahhh...i had a terrible meeting today. totally lost my cool with mcsorley, mccluskey and shane.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{you went to see the motown three?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i pitched 'em the hill.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{on its merits?}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{the woman knows no fear. she'd lobby the carolinas to the american lung association.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{it was a disaster.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{you're in good company. i sat with 'em a week ago. they told me there was nothing on the president's domestic agenda they were more committed to defeating than the crime bill.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{well, congratulations, fellas, you're outta the cellar. mcsorley told me the only thing on the president's domestic agenda they were more committed to defeating than the crime bill was the fossil fuel package.}
<A>__{this catches shepherd and a.j. by surprise like accidentally drawing to an inside straight.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{you're kidding, right?}
<A>__{sydney isn't aware she's said anything of particular consequence.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{no, i'm not kidding. it's funny that he used the same words.}
<A>__{a.j. and shepherd are trying to study the situation without giving anything away.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{i don't think the pep boys know too many words.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i'm gonna get a drink and shake this off. when i come back, i will have christmas spirit.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{is something wrong?}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{no, i was...i was thinking about nothing.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i will be back in a minute.}
<A>__{she goes off.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{did what i think just happened, just happen? did the gdc's political director just tell the president and the white house chief of staff that there are three votes on the crime bill that can be bought by stickin' the fossil fuel package in a drawer.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{no, the gdc's political director didn't tell us anything. sydney wade told her boyfriend and her boyfriend's best friend that she had a lousy day.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{it doesn't change the facts, mr. president. if sydney gets her 24 votes and we're three short, there's some maneuvering to be done.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{i made a promise, a.j.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{you made a deal, mr. president.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{i made it with sydney.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{you made it with the gdc.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{yeah, well, this is all academic anyway. we're not going to need those votes.}
<C>__{a.j.}
<D>__{if your approval rating drops any more, things are gonna get tight.}
