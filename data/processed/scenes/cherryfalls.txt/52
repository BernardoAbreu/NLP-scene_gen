<A>__{brent is talking to tom sisler, the principal. tom is a wiry, hard featured man in his mid forties. they have known each other for a long time but are not really friends. brent knows tom too well. tom's a cynical bastard. tom is examining the photos taken at the crime scene.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you aren't planning to tell these kids that 'virgin' was tattooed into both stacy and rod, are you?}
<C>__{brent}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{good.}
<C>__{brent}
<D>__{but i am going to have to question all of their past boyfriends and girlfriends.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{fine, just don't mention the carving this is going to be a tough enough day as it is.}
<A>__{there's a knock at the door. jody enters.}
<C>__{brent}
<D>__{hi honey.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{hi daddy. hi mr. sisler.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{hi jody.}
<C>__{brent}
<D>__{i just wanted to check that you were okay?}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{i'm fine. i've just never had someone my age die before. it's so weird.}
<C>__{brent}
<D>__{how well did you know stacy and rod?}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{i've been in the same class with stacy for years but we weren't tight or anything.}
<C>__{brent}
<D>__{had either of them broken up with someone recently? hurt someone?}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{no. those two were together before kenny and i started hanging out and that's over, what, god a year now.}
<C>__{brent}
<D>__{i want you to head right home after school.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{i will. is that all?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{could you tell mr. marliston we'd like to see him.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{she leaves.}
<C>__{brent}
<D>__{why'd you send for lenny marliston?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{the kids adore him. they confide in him. his patchouli reeking rear might know if stacy and rod were really virgins. why didn't you ask jody that?}
<C>__{brent}
<D>__{she's my daughter, tom.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{brent}
<D>__{so you just don't point blank ask your teenage daughter about sex.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{why not? you worried you might find out how much she actually knows?}
<A>__{brent gives tom a 'keep your cynical shit off my daughter' look.}
<C>__{leonard}

<A>__{he shakes his hand firmly.}
<C>__{brent}
<D>__{nice to meet you too. my daughter speaks highly of you.}
<A>__{leonard examines brent's face carefully. brent is a little taken aback by his intensity.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{we have the same color eyes.}
<C>__{brent}
<D>__{i guess we do.}
