<L>__{interior hall of marine animals night}
<A>__{a huge room several stories high. a whale hangs suspended from the ceiling. dioramas of fish line all the walls. mbwun pauses next to a diorama of the gentle, vegetarian sea cow, the manatee. the two make a startling contrast. a pause and then the voices are heard again, much louder now. the source is right around the edge of the manatee display. mbwun leaps forward, claws lashing out. he turns the corner and crashes through a wall of glass as he grabs at the source of the voices... a display of small, extraordinarily life like talking holograms! they've been re activated with the emergency power system. each little talking figure is no more then five inches high. they move around a small three dimensional display of marine animals, explaining the lung systems of fish. mbwun... stands in the pile of broken glass, stares at the holograms, mesmerized. he makes a noise that sounds astonishingly like a chuckle! then he reaches out one long claw and tries unsuccessfully to touch one of the holograms. but the shadowy creatures can't be caught. the beast seems to realize this, snorts and moves off. as he goes he passes behind a large glass elevator. it stands in middle the open room. the elevator is designed to carry people upstairs and down in the two story exhibit. in the dim light, with his poor vision, the monster doesn't see d'agosta, the mayor, kawakita, and their entire group sandwiched inside. the monster exits the exhibit and quietly d'agosta slides the doors open. everyone, all thirty five people in evening clothes, quickly get out and run across the exhibit to another stairwell at the far side of the hall.}
