<L>__{interior spare room}
<A>__{with a bunch of junk in it. he frantically starts scanning the junk for the book he's looking for, repeating the words, "come on," endlessly. from off screen we hear:}
<C>__{vincent }
<D>__{hurry up man! we're losin' her!}
<C>__{lance}
<P>__{(calling back)}
<D>__{i'm looking as fast as i can!}
<A>__{lance continues his frenzied search. we hear jody in the living room now as she talks to vincent.}
<C>__{jody }
<D>__{what's he lookin' for?}
<C>__{vincent }
<D>__{i dunno, some medical book.}
<A>__{jody calls to lance.}
<C>__{jody }
<D>__{what are you lookin' for?}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{my black medical book!}
<A>__{as he continues searching, flipping and knocking over shit, jody appears in the doorway.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{whata're you looking for?}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{my black fuckin' medical book. it's like a text book they give to nurses.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{i never saw a medical book.}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{trust me, i have one.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{well if it's that important, why didn't you keep it with the shot?}
<A>__{lance spins toward her.}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{i don't know! stop bothering me!}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{while you're lookin' for it, that girl's gonna die on our carpet. you're never gonna find it in all this shit. for six months now, i've been telling you to clean this room}
<C>__{vincent }
<D>__{get your ass in here, fuck the book!}
<A>__{lance angrily knocks over a pile of shit and leaves the shot heading for the living room.}
<B>__{living room}
<A>__{vincent is bent over mia, talking softly to her, when lance reenters the room.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{quit fuckin' around man and give her the shot!}
<A>__{lance bends down by the black case brought in by jody. he opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection.}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{while i'm doing this, take her shirt off and find her heart.}
<A>__{vince rips her blouse open. jody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{does it have to be exact?}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{yeah, it has to be exact! i'm giving her an injection in the heart, so i gotta exactly hit her in the heart.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{well, i don't know exactly where her heart is, i think it's here.}
<A>__{vince points to mia's right breast. lance glances over and nods.}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{that's it.}
<A>__{as lance readies the injection, vincent looks up at jody.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i need a big fat magic marker, got one?}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i need a big fat magic marker, any felt pen'll do, but a magic marker would be great.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{hold on.}
<A>__{jody runs to the desk, opens the top drawer and, in her enthusiasm, she pulls the drawer out of the desk, the contents of which (bills, papers, pens) spill to the floor. the injection is ready. lance hands vincent the needle.}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{it's ready, i will tell you what to do.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{you're gonna give her the shot.}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{no, you're gonna give her the shot.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i've never does this before.}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{i've never done this before either, and i ain't starting now. you brought 'er here, that means you give her the shot. the day i bring an oding bitch to your place, then i gotta give her the shot.}
<A>__{jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic marker in her hand.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{got it.}
<A>__{vincent grabs the magic marker out of jody's hand and makes a big red dot on mia's body where her heart is.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{okay, what do i do?}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{well, you're giving her an injection of adrenaline straight to her heart. but she's got a breast plate in front of her heart, so you gotta pierce through that. so what you gotta do is bring the needle down in a stabbing motion.}
<A>__{lance demonstrates a stabbing motion, which looks like "the shape" killing its victims in "halloween".}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i gotta stab her?}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{if you want the needle to pierce through to her heart, you gotta stab her hard.}
<A>__{then once you do, push down on the plunger.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{what happens after that?}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{i'm curious about that myself.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{this ain't a fuckin' joke man!}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{she's supposed to come out of it like}
<P>__{(snaps his fingers)}
<D>__{that.}
<A>__{vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing motion. he looks down on mia. mia is fading fast. soon nothing will help her. vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{count to three.}
<A>__{lance, on this knees right beside vincent, does not know what to expect.}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{one...}
<A>__{red dot on mia's body. needle raised ready to strike.}
<C>__{lance }
<D>__{...two...}
<A>__{jody's face is alive with anticipation. needle in that air, poised like a rattler ready to strike.}
<C>__{lance }
<D>__{...three!}
<A>__{the needle leaves frame, thrusting down hard. vincent brings the needle down hard, stabbing mia in the chest. mia's head is jolted from the impact. the syringe plunger is pushed down, pumping the adrenaline out through the needle. mia's eyes pop wide open and she lets out a hellish cry of the banshee. she bolts up in a sitting position, needle stuck in her chest screaming. vincent, lance and jody, who were in sitting positions in front of mia, jump back, scared to death. mia's scream runs out. she slowly starts taking breaths of air. the other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken to their bones, look to see if she's alright.}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{if you're okay, say something.}
<A>__{mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a relatively normal voice.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{something.}
<A>__{vincent and lance collapse on their backs, exhausted and shaking from how close to death mia came.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{anybody want a beer?}
