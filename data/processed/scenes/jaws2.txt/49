<A>__{brody is alone in the jeep, headed for the safety of home and family. he drives past the town's billboard: it's covered with an architect's rendering of the amity holiday inn. the sign reads: "when in amity, enjoy the holiday inn." plastered across it is an added streamer: "now open." barely visible underneath are older notices: "under construction," and "opening in june." as brody passes the sign, he impulsively swings off the main road and heads down towards the beach.}
