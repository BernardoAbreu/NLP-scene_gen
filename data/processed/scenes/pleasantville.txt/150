<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior elm street. night.}
<A>__{david and margaret stand beneath the big elm tree outside margaret's house: a statue of two young lovers. they wrap their arms around each other in a classic silhouette. the meeting across town seems a million miles away. after a moment or two, david reaches behind the tree and pulls out a beautifully wrapped gift. it is three feet long with a bright red bow.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{i got you something.}
<A>__{margaret's eyes widen. she beams at him, then tears off the wrapping paper revealing a great big umbrella ... a real umbrella. she looks up at him thrilled.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{it's beautiful. where'd you get it?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it was a prop for the school play ...}
<A>__{she looks down and giggles.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{can i open it?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{sure ...}
<A>__{margaret gives him a quick kiss then opens the umbrella. she puts it back on her shoulder and turns a series of pirouettes like her own kind of rain dance. margaret points her face up to the sky as if she is being showered by a summer storm. all at once a pair of headlights round the corner.}
<B>__{wider.}
<A>__{david grabs the umbrella and closes it quickly. margaret looks to the street as the convertible slows to a crawl and two teenage boys pull up beside them. they are clean cut with black and white faces ...}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{hello bud ...}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(clipped)}
<D>__{hello whitey.}
<A>__{they smile at each other for no good reason. it's scary and arrogant.}
<C>__{whitey}
<P>__{(more pointed)}
<D>__{hello margaret.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{hello whitey ...}
<C>__{whitey}
<P>__{(loud)}
<D>__{hey bud, how come you're not at the town meeting right now?}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(curt)}
<D>__{no reason.}
<P>__{(pause firing back)}
<D>__{how come you're not?}
<C>__{whitey}
<D>__{oh. we're s'posed to go out and let everybody know about it. see.}
<A>__{he points to an armband that has some sort of chamber of commerce seal on it. whitey leans out of the car and leers ...}
<C>__{whitey }
<D>__{no reason hunh ... see i thought maybe it was cause you were too busy entertaining your colored girlfriend.}
<A>__{margaret literally flinches. the boys share a peel of laughter and snort at each other. david puts an arm around her and pulls her close.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{why don't you guys just get the hell out of here.}
<C>__{whitey}
<D>__{oh, okay, bud. we'll do that.}
<A>__{he guns the engine as if to leave, then pauses and turns toward margaret.}
<C>__{whitey }
<P>__{(leering more)}
<D>__{you know margaret, you can come over and bake those oatmeal cookies for me anytime you want to.}
<A>__{they share another chortle as whitey guns the car and peels out with a screech. margaret's lip starts to quiver and david holds her tighter ...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's fine ... it doesn't mean anything.}
<A>__{she nods, groping for reassurance ...}
