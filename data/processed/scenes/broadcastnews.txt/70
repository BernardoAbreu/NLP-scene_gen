<L>__{interior control room day}
<A>__{jane mounts some steps in the control room she moves past the director and technical crew up to the next level where the two news execs, ernie and paul stand with their backs to the wall, and then up one more step slightly above the desk and table occupied by blair. now she slips into the large well paddled throne like seat as we begin music cue. literally at her fingertips is the row of buttons which provide immediate access to the field reporters at the pentagon, state and the white house. in front of her the bank of monitors, the technical team and past them the studio where tom is seated at anchor, a floor producer and writer feeding him copy.}
<B>__{angle favoring blair}
<A>__{as she looks at jane, poised to control the complicated apparatus of minds and machines comprising the big time network news. and jane craig is at the helm. blair experiences a flash of emotion which transcends envy and verbalizes it.}
<C>__{blair}
<P>__{(sotto to jane)}
<D>__{executive producer wow.}
<A>__{jane looks at her and, in a moment of atypical merriment, does a choking gesture at her own throat as the monitors flash a graphic reading: special report... we hear an announcer's voice say, "this is a special report from..." insert: jane's control panel each of four buttons labeled so that the microphone can connect her to tom and the field reporters. she presses the button marked "tom."}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you hear me, tom? tom? tom? damn it...he can't hear me...}
<P>__{(to blair)}
<D>__{i told you if there was one thing...}
<A>__{tom's voice on speakers.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(voice over; relaxed)}
<D>__{i can hear you. i was just teasing.}
<A>__{gulping the air in relief, she slumps nonetheless impressed by the macho cool as: tom smiles towards her then poises himself just as the announcer's last words clear.}
<C>__{announcer's voice}
<P>__{(voice over)}
<D>__{...in washington, tom grunick.}
<A>__{he begins his report. he seems authoritative, compelling, even in a low key way. we trust him.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{good afternoon. a libyan fighter plane attacked a united states military installation early this morning and was, itself, shot down by american f 14 interceptors.}
<A>__{another monitor shows the graphic running. in the b.g. two men approaches paul. they look out of place, decidedly non business like.}
<C>__{man one}
<D>__{mr. moore, i'm marvin usher and this is my brother, stuart.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{not now!!!}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{look.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{the libyan missile destroyed an army warehouse which, just thirty minutes earlier, had been crowded with servicemen. no one was injured.}
