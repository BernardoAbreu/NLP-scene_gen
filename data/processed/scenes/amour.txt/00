<L>__{interior apartment day}
<A>__{the hallway is a mess. a window opening onto a light well is open. the door to the apartment is suddenly broken open. a plain clothes detective, two uniformed police officers and several firemen also in uniform enter and look around. they all wear gloves and masks that cover their mouths and noses. behind them, the superintendent and his wife also push their way in. they're both holding their noses. in his free hand, the superintendent holds a pile of mail and promotional flyers. behind him, comes a female neighbor.}
<D>__{plain clothes detective}
<P>__{(to the superintendent and the neighbor)}
<D>__{wait outside please.}
<A>__{he signals to a police officer who herds the curious onlookers back out through the door.}
<C>__{police officer}
<P>__{(to the superintendent, pointing to a pile of mail)}
<D>__{what's the date of the last letter?}
<C>__{superintendent}
<P>__{(verifying)}
<D>__{the 16th from what i can see... wait...}
<A>__{the plain clothes detective has tried in vain to open the door on the left. it has been sealed up with adhesive tape.}
<D>__{plain clothes detective}
<P>__{(to the fire officer)}
<D>__{can you try?}
<A>__{while the firemen go to work on the door, the plain clothes detective goes into the adjoining dining room. he opens the windows quickly and turns to go into the room to the left via the double doors. they are locked and the gaps are also taped up. he turns to the right and goes into the living room, where he also opens up the windows...}

<D>__{the door is open.}
<A>__{...and comes back into the hallway, passing by the waiting firemen. once again, we hear snatches of dialogue between the police officer and the janitor.}
<C>__{janitor}
<D>__{...no as far as i know. during the whole time, they had a nurse, but it's been a while since i last saw her. my wife has been...}
<A>__{the plain clothes detective enters the bedroom which is now accessible. its windows are open and the draft makes the curtains billow into the room.}
<D>__{plain clothes detective}
<P>__{(to the firemen who are now curious enough to come and stand by the door)}
<D>__{did you open the windows?}
<A>__{the firemen shake their heads. the plain clothes detective turns toward the big double bed placed against the back wall of the bedroom. on the right hand bed, there's only the bare mattress. on the left hand bed lies the partly decomposed body of an old woman. where once there were eyes, now there are only gaping holes. the corpse has been neatly dressed and is adorned with flowers that have already dried out a little. on her chest is a crucifix. white letters on a black background: the credits}
