<L>__{interior bank day}
<A>__{titan, with a happy bounce in his step, enters the bank. the last time he was here he thwarted a robbery. he looks nostalgic. a security guard shyly walks up to him like a kid meeting his tv idol.}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{morning, tighten.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{morning.}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{is there something we can do for you?}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{oh, don't bother about me. i'm just here to make a withdrawal.}
<A>__{titan walks across the lobby, drawing stares of admiration from all. a little girl waves to him sweetly. he gives her a good natured wink as he heads straight for the vault. the security guard watches him enter and come out with a sack}
<B>__{of cash.}
<A>__{sure he must be misunderstanding what's going on, the security guard just stares at titan as he passes by and out the door. the bank manager comes over to the guard.}
<C>__{bank manager}
<D>__{say, did he just rob us?}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{not sure. sort of looks it, don't it?}
<C>__{bank manager}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{should i, you know, stop him?}
<C>__{bank manager}
<D>__{umm...yeah.}
<A>__{as the security guard exits the bank, the manager stares out the window. his eyes suddenly grow wide with terror. the guard's body suddenly smashes through the window, landing at the startled bank manager's feet.}
<C>__{bank manager }
<P>__{(looking down at the guard)}
<D>__{he did rob us, didn't he?}
