<L>__{interior professor ock"s private physics laboratory, the}
<A>__{cyclotron room (credit sequence) day a mighty warning klaxon assaults our ears. a flashing red warning light stabs our eyes. several dials go into the red. a hand pushes aside a yellow thermos and pushes forward a red power throttle. we hear the whining up of a cyclotron. a digital dial climbs to "5% power." a spider crawls across a dial. begin opening credits. the cyclotron room is in an old basement full of peeling paint and plumbing wrapped with tape. leaks are here and there. cobwebs are all around. doctor otto octavius (ock) is a strong but strange featured man in his mid fifties. his assistant, weiner, hovers nearby looking on. he's open mouthed with a mindless kind of curiosity. weiner is a local, small time hood hired by ock to circumvent the school administration and to "procure" whatever ock needs for his experiments. he shades his eyes against a searing blue white beam that erupts from the window. the room is}
<B>__{divided into a control room and the experiment chambers.}
<C>__{weiner}
<D>__{whoa, whoa, whoa... what's that?}
<A>__{with a whoosh, the window explodes, showering the two with shards of glass, and throwing them to the floor.}
<C>__{ock}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{we begin again... let's kick in that new transducer. see if we can double the power output.}
<C>__{weiner}
<P>__{(rising more slowly)}
<D>__{whoa, doc... wait a minute...}
<A>__{but ock is already at the throttle. the cyclotron whirls up. the lights go on. louder, brighter than before. ock looks through the broken window into the experimental chamber. the power dial inches upward, "eight, nine..." the blue white light is blinding now. the whine pitch is shattering.}
<B>__{end opening credits.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{okey... dokey!}
<A>__{the power dial hits ten.}
<L>__{exterior empire state university day}
<A>__{as students go to class, the sound of the cyclotron spills out of the science center onto the grounds of empire state university. we see peter parker, a pleasant faced senior who's among the top in his class. sincere and serious, he has yet to develop a way with women.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(falling in step)}
<D>__{hiya peter...}
<A>__{liz allen is also a senior. she's beautiful and intelligent.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(ardent but uncomfortable)}
<D>__{hiya liz... how're you doing...?}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(teasing softly)}
<D>__{how'm i doing what?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{peter! peter! wait up!}
<A>__{harry is the school nerd. a quirky kid who, like peter, can be a little backward around girls, especially pretty ones like liz.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(to liz)}
<D>__{would you, uh... excuse us for a minute?}
<A>__{despite peter's protesting body language, harry pulls him away like a conspirator.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{what is it? what...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{did the astro physics journal really accept your paper?}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(laughs, embarrassed)}
<D>__{yeah... well... all i got's the data but they've agreed to publish it when it's finished. you know... it's my calculation on the planetary conjunction.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{and its influence on the anti force. isn't it?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yes. look, harry, i am busy with...}
<P>__{(indicates liz standing there)}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah, you and the rest of the class. every one is busy with liz.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(growing impatient)}
<D>__{peter?}
<A>__{a hand reaches in and smacks her bottom.}
<C>__{flash}
<D>__{hiya, cupcakes...}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(elbowing him affectionately)}
<D>__{flash...!}
<A>__{they kiss and walk away.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(sneering)}
<D>__{and flash is the busiest of them all...}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{come on, harry... we'll be late for octavius.}
<A>__{harry makes a gesture dismissing ock as crazy.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{ock is nuts, don't you agree?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{ock is a genius, harry. crazy, yes! but, a genius misunderstood, and unappreciated.}
<L>__{interior cyclotron area hallway day}
<A>__{it is a basement hallway full of lockers which students are banging open and shut as they put stuff in and take stuff out. in their midst, a man is banging on the door marked "cyclotron room authorized personnel only!" professor rosomorf, sixtish, respectable, a good old fashioned professor, he's the head of the physics dept. with him is alexander thorkel, a 40 ish, waspish school administrator. for a scientist as crazily focused as ock, thorkel is a natural enemy.}
<C>__{roz}
<P>__{(knocking furiously)}
<D>__{doctor octavius! you are late for your lecture. the students are waiting. doctor octavius!}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{your friend is impossible professor rosomorf, i told the board we should let him go.}
<A>__{the light above thorkel's head explodes. then all the lights behind him explode in succession. thorkel and roz look amazed...}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{what's he doing in there, not his crazy experiment again.}
<C>__{roz}
<D>__{you mean his anti force theory... one day they'll give him the nobel prize for it.}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{meanwhile he is demolishing our university. octavius!!}
<P>__{(knocks)}
<D>__{open the door.}
<L>__{interior ock's lab}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{the anti force experiment has now reached the limit of electronic overload safety. therefore, weiner, you will disconnect the overload safety device...}
<A>__{four waldos (three fingered, snake like mechanical arms) suddenly thrust themselves into the chamber and begin working, each at a different task. ock is an acknowledged master at manipulating these waldos. he flicks a switch and a searing blue white beam lances down from a focusing cone and strikes a gram weight marked, "1,000,000"), illuminating it and filling our ears with a splitting buzz tone. the knock on the door grows louder. weiner comes up behind ock.}
<C>__{weiner}
<D>__{whoa, doc... someone's at the door...}
<C>__{ock}
<P>__{(ignoring)}
<D>__{world class scientific mind and they stick me in the basement with this third rate cyclotron...}
<A>__{insert: the dial marked "relative gravity" reads "1,000,000" but suddenly it snaps to "0.999999!"}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{okey! dokey!}
<A>__{the weight begins to jiggle and, for an instant, it appears to lift ever so slightly.}
<L>__{interior college physics lab day}
<A>__{this is an enormous room, 100 lab tables. the yellowing smoke of a thousand experiments hangs in the air. a huge american flag dominates the back wall. peter, harry and liz set up their tables. flash reads the daily bugle sports section. peter can't take his eyes off liz. when she looks back he looks down at his gear.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{what is it, peter?}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{it's nothing.}
<L>__{interior ock's lab}
<A>__{weiner opens the door and sees roz and thorkel waiting impatient.}
<C>__{weiner}
<D>__{yes, gentleman can i help you?}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{tell your boss, that his class is waiting.}
<C>__{weiner}
<P>__{(looks)}
<D>__{you better tell him yourself.}
<A>__{thorkel looks at roz who waves his shoulder, then the both call.}
<D>__{roz & thorkel professor octavius!!}
<A>__{professor ock turns and looks at the bewildered men.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{gentlemen, come, you must see this.}
<C>__{roz}
<D>__{but, your students...}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{the imbeciles can wait... i have better things to do than teach introductory physics rosomorf. undergrads are kindless adolescence.}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{you see he is impossible.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{thorkel you are the dummiest administrator our university has ever had.}
<P>__{(thorkel turns to go)}
<D>__{don't go thorkel!! come! look!}
<A>__{he starts to play his machines handles and buttons.}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{the university pays you to teach something to your students.}
<L>__{interior college physics lab day}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{well, do you mean nothing... or do you mean something but you won't tell me what it is?}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(regaining)}
<D>__{i mean plain nothing.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{well, i guess that's about as nothing as you can get... plain nothing. a beat.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{liz...!}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{ahh, it is something.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{no... look.}
<A>__{the equipment on her table is starting to vibrate. they look at it, curiously. we hear the cyclotron's whine begin to build...}
<L>__{interior cyclotron room day}
<A>__{everything is shaking like in an earthquake... roz and thorkel seem to dance in their place going crazy with anger and surprise. the whine is deafening! the light is blinding! weiner has his eyes closed and his hands over his ears.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{i am going for 20 percent power!}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{no!! don't do that...}
<C>__{roz}
<D>__{ock! its dangerous...}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{ock i warn you...}
<A>__{weiner crosses himself. the console erupts in sparks.}
<L>__{interior electrical conduit montage day}
<A>__{we follow the electrical overcharge as it crackles along the wires and cables inside the walls and floors. it is making its way up to the lab!}
<L>__{interior lab day}
<A>__{all the kids are now trying to hold onto their vibrating equipment. the charge crackles up a wire and erupts at liz's table. a breaker explodes in flames. there is an outburst of ad libs: "fire!" "everybody out!" thorkel (comes running he is shabby and bewildered) seeing liz trapped behind the fire which is growing from second to second.}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{keep calm, everybody keep calm. use the front door. everybody out the front.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{liz! come on...!}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{i can't. help me!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i'm coming!}
<A>__{he wades into the fire, but is beaten back by the flames. his sleeve is on fire. he pats it out.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{peter!}
<A>__{flash appears and tries to help but thorkel stops him.}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{get back, you idiots. you can't go in there!}
<A>__{liz smashes at the window, but this is an inner city school and the windows are covered by steel gates. liz wraps her fingers in the gate.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(out at the street)}
<D>__{help! help me!}
<A>__{outside the window the air is clear and people come and go. some are stopping to look up at the girl on the second floor who screams (but they can't hear, of course) down at them as the flames close in behind her. peter comes flying in with a fire extinguisher. he fumbles with it. flash pushes thorkel, grabs the extinguisher away from him with a scowl of disdain. liz turns to face the flames. suddenly there is an eruption of co2 clouds and the roar of a fire}
<L>__{extinguisher.}
<A>__{the flames are beaten down enough for her to leap out. flash is there, holding the extinguisher. people cheer.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{thanks for your help flash.}
<C>__{flash}
<D>__{no problem wimp.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{our hero has a real way with words.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{oh, why don't you grow up.}
<A>__{peter is stung, insulted, turns away. rosomorf peeps in, worried faces thorkel.}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{this man will bring a disaster upon this university.}
<A>__{ock comes in, starts his lecture calmly as if nothing has happened.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{the universe is made up of forces... and counter forces. science is the study of the forces!}
<A>__{flash hands the extinguisher to peter. liz embraces flash, throwing a glimpse at peter who tried so bravely. he looks away and turns the last of the extinguisher on the last of the fire.}
<C>__{ock}
<P>__{(continues without a hitch)}
<D>__{but i... professor otto octavius... have devoted my life to the study of the counter forces! good job, peter.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(taking place at lab table)}
<D>__{thanks, professor.}
<A>__{thorkel has walked slowly and uncomprehendingly toward the front of the huge lab. he simply cannot believe ock's behavior.}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{i don't believe it, i simply don't...}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{can we carry on mr. thorkel.}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{i don't believe... oh, all right carry on professor.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{well! this week my dear students i have made a stunning breakthrough...}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{wait a minute, wait a minute... you've got fire forms to fill out, dr. octavius.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{i have no time for forms, or administrators who persist in interrupting me, mr. thorkel.}
<A>__{thorkel steams out and bangs shut the door.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{i now believe its possible that these counter forces can be... collected... the way the magnifying glass collects the sunlight... and focused into a hard beam i call... weiner!}
<A>__{weiner backs away from the blackboard to reveal a word that ock has scrawled in large letters. it says "anti force."}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{i call it, the anti force!}
<A>__{ock is plugging a huge cable into a small lucite box with a silver ball inside it.}
<C>__{ock}
<P>__{(continues as he works)}
<D>__{this anti force, once harnessed, is capable of undoing any natural force at which it is aimed... for instance...}
<P>__{(looks up maniacally)}
<D>__{gravity!}
<A>__{liz scribbles down a note and mouths the word "gravity." then she turns to peter.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{i'm sorry...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{it's alright.}
<A>__{ock is "playing" his computer like the phantom of the opera at the organ.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{we patch in the cyclotron... the lights flicker and go dim.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{pay no attention to the lights... i of course steal its energy, and it looses power. we patch in the cyclotron... and we gradually apply power. the power that i am stealing...}
<A>__{as the whine builds in the lab... ock peers through the lucite box at us, distorted by it. the box is a miniature version of the cyclotron's experimental chamber, and now the blue white glow begins. it crackles round the silver ball.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{and so we stand, four square against the fundamental force that orders and maintains our universe... gravity... which is holding down this goddamn ball. rise!}
<A>__{the lights go totally dark. the kids react with whoops and catcalls.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what a crock...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{shut up harry... this is very interesting.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{mr. parker! have you some... interesting observation you'd like to share with the class?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{no sir...}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{then shut up! and pay some attention to the experiment.}
<A>__{ock peers at us through the lucite box as the silver ball begins to rise. ock's face is ecstatic.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{rise! rise!!!}
<A>__{the silver ball suddenly shoots up, shattering the top of the box. it flies up to the ceiling where it shatters a}
<B>__{light fixture.}
<A>__{the shards rain down on ock who reaches out and catches the falling ball and scales it in a raised fist.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{now that's what i call an experiment!}
<A>__{the cyclotron whine cuts out and ock wheels to the computer. he hits a key and several colored projection beams lance out of the back of the room. they pierce the smoke and light a projection display in the front. two colored spheres one, yellow, one blue touch where their circumferences meet. behind them is a black depiction of "space".}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{you are looking at a representation of two universes. our blue one. our real universe... something we can touch and feel and see and draw calculations about. this is us. the yellow universe... this is something else. some other dimension... something... on the other side!}
<A>__{ock hits another computer key and a hole appears where the two spheres touch. the blue and the yellow marbleize with each other. the colors swirl until both spheres are}
<C>__{bright green.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{if it were possible to generate enough power behind it, the anti force could wipe out not just gravity... but all our universal forces at the same time. in effect... it would blast a hole between this universe and the nexterior each...}
<P>__{(indicates green spheres)}
<D>__{would flow into each other. no blue universe. no yellow. end, finished, over.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(with a student's ear)}
<D>__{that sounds like a scenario for the end of the world.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{my girl, it is! it is. it would mean wiping out everything that's known... and letting in everything that's unknown.}
<C>__{flash}
<D>__{isn't that a little dangerous?}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{don't worry yourself, true inter dimensional penetration is still purely theoretical, but one day... maybe very near... maybe in the 21st century...}
<L>__{interior basement hallway day}
<A>__{peter, liz, flash and harry all take books from their}
<B>__{lockers.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(whispers to peter)}
<D>__{look, it's just... i don't know... when you and flash go after each other like that...}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{he's not my type.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{he doesn't have to be.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{check.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{and besides, he's not all bad.}
<A>__{peter looks at flash who's a few lockers down. flash has taken a football from his locker and is spinning it on his finger with great joy and concentration.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{you don't get nicknamed flash because you're a rocket scientist, liz.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{give it up, parker. you'd die for a nickname like flash.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yeah, of embarrassment.}
<A>__{kim comes by and leans seductively by her locker. kim is a ripe one and hot hot hot!}
<C>__{kim}
<P>__{(teasing)}
<D>__{hey, flash... i'm scalping a pair of the midnight madness wrestling match tomorrow night.}
<C>__{flash}
<D>__{the slammies??? i'd kill for that!!!}
<C>__{kim}
<D>__{would you pay $125?}
<C>__{flash}
<D>__{well, uh, i... gee... if... can i tell you tomorrow?}
<C>__{kim}
<P>__{(moving on)}
<D>__{you snooze, you lose. hiya liz...}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{kim, you know peter and harry? this is my new roommate... kim nickson.}
<A>__{kim is pulling her pet, a foot long salamander, out of her locker. she wraps it around her neck and turns to the boys. they go bug eyed!}
<C>__{kim}
<P>__{(interested)}
<D>__{hellooo, peter.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{hi...}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{we're going to the student reunion meeting. you coming?}
<A>__{peter looks at kim. wow. then he looks at liz who's adjusting herself in a small mirror. harry jabs him in the ribs. yeah, yeah!}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{i can't... i gotta go over to the daily bugle. i'm trying to sell some photos.}
<C>__{kim}
<D>__{soooh, a photographer...?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{just an amateur. well... nice meeting you, kim.}
<C>__{kim}
<D>__{yeah... i bet it would be.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{can i be your date for the reunion shooshoo?}
<C>__{kim}
<D>__{no jerk!}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(she turns to go)}
<D>__{what did i say...}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{it's not what you said, it's how you say it, shooshoo!}
<A>__{everybody leaves and harry is left alone, he throws his bag down.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{damn!}
<A>__{peter turns to go and comes face to face with the hulking}
<B>__{weiner.}
<C>__{weiner}
<D>__{peter, doc ock wants to see you.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{about my data i bet.}
<C>__{weiner}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{he knows about my work on the planetary conjunction, doesn't he?}
<C>__{weiner}
<P>__{(lies)}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<L>__{interior control room day}
<A>__{peter enters wide eyed behind weiner. this place is a far cry from the experiment in the lab room. it's a fantastic netherworld to which no undergrad gains entrance. no one but peter. ock is sitting in a swivel chair with his back to peter. he has the look of captain nemo in his nautilus. this is ock's domain.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{hello, professor octavius.}
<P>__{(no response)}
<D>__{i really admired your experiment.}
<C>__{ock}
<P>__{(back to peter)}
<D>__{we have a lot of interests in common, peter. perhaps we should put our heads together, if you know what i mean...}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(flattered)}
<D>__{that would be... great.}
<C>__{ock}
<P>__{(turns with a smile)}
<D>__{now you take the planetary conjunction. this saturday night we will witness saturn, jupiter, the moon, the earth, the sun... all in a row. never seen within the memory of man, or measured for its effect. the total gravitational force must be quite exceptional. isn't that the subject of your paper...?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yes sir, i've worked out a new way to calculate the combined gravitational effect.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{i'm a busy man, mr. parker. but i think i could find the time to go over it with you. make sure it all... checks out.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well... i'm sort of working with professor rosomorf and he suggested we kind of keep it between us. he thinks that my theory is... well, i don't know...}
<C>__{ock}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{the scoundrel...}
<P>__{(turns angry)}
<D>__{i want to see that data, peter!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{but professor octavius... if i knew you were interested... sorry, i've already given it to... professor rosomorf, and he is after all the head of our physics department... and i couldn't...}
<A>__{ock turns sweet again. he smiles too broadly.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{well, i'm certain something can be worked out. run along, young man.}
<A>__{peter begins to leave.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{just a minute... how about if i show you my discoveries... something i never showed to any other student... as a matter of fact to anybody at all.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well i am really flattered, i mean i'd love to... but i...}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{very well shall we say if you come here tonight...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{but professor i don't now if i should...}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{make it eight sharp... i will be waiting for you... right here...}
<A>__{peter looks worried then leaves. ock turns to weiner who slouches against the wall smiling.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{the same academic world that's so keen to embrace that boy's undergraduate work, ridicules my anti force theory as quackery. i ask you, weiner... what is our society coming to? ha!}
<C>__{weiner}
<D>__{they are all a bunch of brainless assholes, that's what i say...}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{weiner! go get me that boy's data!}
<C>__{weiner}
<D>__{cost you fifty bucks.}
<C>__{ock}
<P>__{(weiner hissing)}
<D>__{just get it. we'll negotiate your fee when you have the data, alright weiner?}

<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{jameson is 50ish, grey at the temples, brush cut on top. he too is forties. his chewed up cigar is forties. this guy is a hard case.}

<P>__{(looks at the other photos)}
<D>__{little kids... i hate little kids. this is a daily newspaper. we need news value photographs, not artsy fartsy shit!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{jameson comes to a picture of a business suited man with a mohawk. peter smiles in anticipation.}

<P>__{(handing photos back)}
<D>__{your photos suck.}
<P>__{(cigar for emphasis)}
<D>__{parker, my readers are morons. i gotta grab them by the eyes. every time you press the button of that nikon of yours it costs you fifty five cents. so the next time you're about to take the plunge, ask yourself, am i taking dog bites man? because if you are...}
