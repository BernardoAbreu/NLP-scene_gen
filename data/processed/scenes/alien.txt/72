<L>__{interior tomb late afternoon}
<A>__{face bare, broussard approaches the center of the room, which is dominated by a large, broad pedestal. on the pedestal are rows of leathery urns or jars, exactly like the one broussard stumbled across in the alien ship except these are all sealed. he walks around the urns, studying them. they all have sealed lids. he shines his light on one of them; then he lays his gloved hand on it. he lifts his mask radio to his lips.}
<C>__{broussard}
<D>__{i don't know if you can hear me, but the place is full of large bottles or jars, just like the one we found on the other ship except these are all sealed. also they're soft to the touch.}
<A>__{he peers more closely at the leathery object.}
<C>__{broussard }
<D>__{another funny thing i just put my hand on it, and now there are these raised areas appearing where my fingertips were.}
