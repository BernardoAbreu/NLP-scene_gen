<L>__{interior charlie's carriage day}
<A>__{as charlie and haven drive in the country. the road winds between hills now and a stream tumbles along beside the winding road. the horse is moving at a snail's pace and charlie is gazing around at the scenery, relaxed and thoughtful.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you know, you remind me a little back there of a character i once read in a book.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i had an idea you'd read a book. what was the character?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{simon legree.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{mark is mixed up. he's either crooked without being smart, or honest without being lucky. and that's no good.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i don't think i'd want to owe you money even if i was honest.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{even?}
<C>__{haven}

<D>__{is that why you robbed your bank?}
<C>__{haven}
