<A>__{peter and josh enter a dingy, dungeon like cellar, illuminated only by bug zappers and emergency lights. every door and window has been nailed shut or sports a heavy duty padlock. peter and josh walk through the dismal scene. in sharp contrast with the dirt smeared walls, we see shiny metallic sewing machines and swatches of cloth appliqued with a funny bunny cartoon character. josh examines the label stitched into the collar. it reads:}
<B>__{proudly made in usa.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{jesus.}
<A>__{his light hits a group of quivering, skeletal chinese immigrants, standing in a tight group against a wall.}
<C>__{woychek}
<P>__{(from the outside)}
<D>__{they look real sick, don't they?}
