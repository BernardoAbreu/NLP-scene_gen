<A>__{underwater close up: a brightly colored fly, attached to a dangling, fishing line. a large salmon swims to the fly. the salmon examines the fly, deciding whether or not to bite. camera pans upward, tracking the line and moving out of the water. we pass the crooked boards of a small rowboat and continue to pan upward. a man reclines in the boat. napping. his hands gently grip a wooden fishing pole. he is handsomely dressed in sportsman's trousers and a blazer. his green, tweed fishing hat is lowered over his face. its brim is filled with various types of tackle and bait. it is dusk. a warm, summer evening. the boat rests on a calm lake, surrounded by moors. thick night fog has begun to settle over the entire area. title: scotland. 1937. suddenly, the man's fishing line becomes taut. the wooden pole buckles. the man stirs. he sits up, moving the hat from his face. camera dollies forward, into a close up of the man. it is indiana jones. his face anxious... hopeful... indy begins to reel in his catch. a voice interrupts. in the distance.}

<A>__{indy leans toward clare, as if he is going to kiss her. he raises an eyebrow. speaking in his smoothest...most suave...}

<A>__{leaning forward, indy closes his eyes to kiss clare. but clare moves away. bonzo the gorilla enters the frame. bonzo kisses indy on the lips. indy opens his eyes. he tries to move away. but the gorilla will not move, wrapping her arms around indy. the gorilla wrestles indy to the ground. by using gorilla hand motions and grunts, clare manages to persuade bonzo to move away from indiana. indy wipes his mouth. clare, betsy and scraggy are laughing. betsy explains to clare.}

<A>__{the ocean liner's horn sounds! it begins to drift away from the dock. indiana turns and runs up the stairs, leading to the boat. the boat is a few feet from the dock. indy leaps onto the boat. he makes it. just}
<B>__{in time.}
<A>__{indiana pauses... suddenly upset. he realizes that he's forgotten the golden hooped rod! it sits on the dock. at scraggy's feet. as the ocean liner pulls away, indy is about to scream to his friends... but clare picks up the crate. she shrugs to indy. the ocean liner pulls further...further...from the dock. indiana is helpless. he can't go}

<L>__{interior clare's room that evening}
<A>__{clare is sound asleep in bed. camera pans to a corner of the room. the wooden crate holding the golden hooped rod rests here. suddenly, the box's nails begin to twist. turn. as if they were being turned by invisible hands. they fall out of the box. dropping to the floor. one by one. the box slowly opens. the golden hooped rod shikmers in the moonlight. suddenly, the staff begins to move. twisting. shrinking. it changes shape...turning into a golden eagle! the bird slowly flaps its wings and flies out of the open window. into the night. clare continues to peacefully sleep.}

<L>__{exterior ocean night}
<A>__{the full moon illuminates the night sky. shimmering across the ocean waters. countless bright stars sparkle in the night sky. indy's ocean liner sails across the water. the image of an eagle appears in the night sky. silhouetted against the moon.}
<L>__{interior ship cabin}
<A>__{indiana jones is sound asleep in his bed. the room's porthole mysteriously swings open. the golden eagle flies inside. the eagle transforms back into the golden hooped rod. the rod leans against the wall. the moonlight reflects the rod, shining into indiana's eyes. indy wakes. he sits up and sees the golden hooped rod. at first, he is shocked. he touches the rod...then comes upon a realization. the creaky voice of sun wu kung fills the soundtrack.}
<C>__{sun wu kung }
<D>__{the golden hooped rod will be a faithful friend. it is capable of one hundred transformations...and will always remain by your side.}
<A>__{indy stands. he turns and looks out of the porthole. a dreamy... satisfied smile covers indy's face, as he stares at the stars above. sound track music soars. camera pulls back, to extremely long shot of the ship sailing across the ocean.}
