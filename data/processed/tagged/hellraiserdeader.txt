"too hip" employees sit at their desks, typing at computers, conferring at tables going about the business of turning out another issue. they point and whisper as amy walks by. amy passes another cubicle as a young reporter holds the newspaper's front page up in front of amy. a big headline reads, "how to be a crack whore" written over a photo of a crack den in which we glimpse things better left unseen. beneath the headline is written, "a special report by amy klein."}

<D>__{i'm not real. i'm not...}
<A>__{winter reaches out, hesitant, and cocks the gun in her hand. meanwhile, we see other hands, reaching in, pressing a folded up towel against the opposite side of her head. other hands come in and press a doubled over pillow against the towel.}

<A>__{the camera is now pointing at winter. there is a look of deep tenderness in his face as he circles around and kneels down, staring toward katya, who is lying, as dead as dead can be, on the mattress. blood has run from the ghastly wound down both sides of the plastic, and towels on the side of the bed catch the mess. winter reaches down and gently removes the gun from katya's lifeless hand... and then, light as a feather, lies down on top of her. the camera moves forward and down as marla, presumably, elbows her way through for a better vantage pointerior the camera moves in close as winter stretches out along katya's body. he places his lips on her forehead, kissing her lightly, then presses his lips against hers kissing her or maybe something else. it seems almost as if he's breathing into her. his body moves as his lungs expand and expel, and he seems to be struggling toward some non sexual climax. amy watches, both repelled and fascinated.}
<B>__{on the tape}
<A>__{winter continues his odd ritual, finally taking a great final breath, as if he's reached the point of exhaustion, and expels it. nothing happens. he leans in close.}

<A>__{amy leans in close as well.}
<B>__{with winter}
<A>__{he draws in another breath he seems to be in agony as he does it presses his lips to katya's dead ones, and exhales. the breath seems to go on forever longer than it should. and then, when it seems as if winter can't breathe out another teaspoon of air, katya's body abruptly twitches beneath him and then she sucks in a ragged breath. her previously open and lifeless eyes, move. her head raises up.}
<B>__{with amy}
<A>__{she simply stares, breathing again for the first time in a moment, unable to quite take in what she's seeing.}
<B>__{on the screen}
<A>__{winter, exhausted, looks down at katya, smiling. there's nervous laughter, sounds of relief from around the room. winter slides off of her. katya looks this way and that, presumably at the others, looking down at her. a hand reaches down and she takes it. the camera follows as winter pulls her unsteadily up to standing. all this despite the fact that there is still an exceedingly large and obvious hole in her head... the size of a dime on one side, the size of a half dollar on the other. the others move in, touching her, congratulating her. she's still a bit shaky, uncertain. then she lifts one of her hands to the side of her head the side with the big exit wound. she touches it gingerly, confirming that it is really there. then she slowly slides her fingers in. they penetrate her skull, unobstructed, to the second knuckle. katya takes her fingers from this ghastly wound and stares at them, bloody. yet she's alive. fine. she looks up at the others, then smiles widely. the others move in, giving her hugs, pecks on the cheek. she touches the wound again. she starts laughing.}

<A>__{amy starts to search fast, thorough, she's done this sort of thing before. she finds a journal, opens it... no writing. she tosses it aside. pulls open a drawer. she tugs out what looks like a blade less knife handle. she presses a stud. a stiletto blade springs out. she tosses it back in the drawer, tugs some other stuff into view. some bills, some shoelaces, loose change. she goes drawer to drawer, looking for anything that might mean something. socks, ragged underwear, cheap jewelry, tee shirts and short skirts and jeans. amy stops, surveying the territory. where to look next? then, deciding, she goes to the bed. she reaches under it, sliding her hand around, tugs out a dust encrusted skirt. feels around some more, hesitates, pulls something else out. she brings it out into view. it's a desiccated mouse. she grimaces and tosses it back under the bed in disgust. she stops... then slides her hand between the mattress and the box spring. she feels around, then stops, finding something. she pulls out a little red paper folder the kind that photographs come from. she opens it. it appears to be a photographic record of another "deader" party. we see some of the same participants we also see marla herself in some of the pictures. she's smiling. amy flips the next photograph. it shows marla next to winter. he's holding something in his hand. amy looks closer. the puzzle box amy turns another photograph and it shows somebody holding the box out in front of marla. the picture is framed through a length of rope with a noose on one end. marla is on the other side almost a kind of "joke" photo. she has a kind of sickly smile on her face. amy's eyes narrow. she holds the picture closer. there seems to be a figure lost in shadows, and the closer she looks the more reality merges with the grains of the photo. what is there? a man? amy hears a scratching noise coming from outside the room. she stuffs the book in her satchel. amy turns toward the door that leads to the hall and the unseen bathroom. she sits, silent, waiting. then the sound of the scratching comes again. the sound of flies rising and again, more distinct something scratching. she keeps her position, still listening. nothing. just the slow steady, untroubled buzzing. she moves toward the bathroom. and again there's the tiny scratching, and the rush of sound, as if something has disturbed the flies. the sound stops. the flies are still except for the occasional buzz. she advances, until she can glimpse the edge of one of marla's hanging, out thrust hands, the tip of one finger just touching the floor. marla's long fingernails are painted green.}
<B>__{the bathroom}
<A>__{she comes around the edge of the bathroom door. marla is motionless. she leans from the pipe by the shoelace. the shoelace is still buried in her throat. the flies buzz up again. the glazed eyes remain fixed in their sockets. one of her hands is not visible from amy's position.. we see scratches on the floor beneath her fingernails. amy steels herself and then walks closer. on the corner of the sink, there's a thick manila envelope with something bulky inside something that looks just like a cassette tape. there's a name written on it, and the marker is right next to it. it reads "amy" amy must reach past the corpse in order to reach the envelope, horribly close to the body in doing so. she enters the cramped space and reaches toward the sink. she is about six inches shy of grabbing it. she notices that her hip is almost touching marla's face as she leans. the flies stir. the stench rises. she stretches closer, and marla's body is pushed aside a few inches. closer and closer amy reaches. her outstretched fingers just manage to touch the envelope. she pitches it and pulls it toward her. it falls off the sink and onto the floor behind marla. now, amy must kneel, and reach past marla face. she holds her breath as she reaches long and far... she manages to grab the envelope, but her face is almost cheek to cheek with the rotting corpse. as she pulls the envelope up, she notices something else in marla's hidden hand.}
<B>__{the puzzle box.}
<A>__{amy reaches over and pries open marla's hand. her blackened fingers snap as they are pulled off the box. amy grabs the box and envelope, stuffs them into her bag, and stands. as she stands next to marla's body suddenly marla's hand grabs amy's leg! amy shrieks and swats the dead hand away, falling backward onto the floor as she does. she rolls over and, in a half crawl, half scramble, gets herself back up to her feet. amy backs up against a wall, kicking marla as she kicks the floor. we can't tell if marla is moving from the kicks or if she is somehow alive. either way, its to much for amy. she stops moving. marla's mouth emits a ghastly sound as a stream of liquid falls to the floor. its almost as if she is trying to speak. amy has seen enough. up she goes as she tears down the hall, through the living room and smack into the manager! which needless to say, scares the shit out of her. he's standing inside the now open door to the apartment.}

<L>__{interior the hall and stairway day}
<A>__{amy comes flying down the hall at top speed. she reaches the top of the stairs and starts down... ...and as she does, her feet slip. she slides down five or six steps, then over balances, throwing out her hands to keep her chin from hitting the polished stone steps. she keeps sliding down, finally over balancing again, flipping over and landing on her back on the landing half way between the floors.}

<A>__{amy breaks through the doors of the building. she hits two of the ten stairs down to the sidewalk. people walking by hardly notice. up ahead, a police car is turning down the street. she stops and walks calmly, diverting her eyes. the police car races by, and amy walks faster, and faster, then runs.}
<L>__{interior amy's hotel room night}
<A>__{close on a tray of ice being cracked apart. it's contents poured into a open towel. amy is sitting on the floor in front of her couch, now dressed in only panties and a bra an image unpleasantly reminiscent of marla especially with the spotting of bruises and roughly bandaged scrapes on her pale skin. she has a dripping ice pack in one hand, which she applies to this bruise and that and a bottle of gin in the other. she doesn't look happy. she takes a drink, then looks toward a tv and vcr in front of her. there's a tape half inserted into the vcr. we can see the empty envelope with "amy" written on it, lying on the floor. he tape is within reach of amy's bare foot, and she lifts a toe toward it, hesitant. she puts her toe against the tape...hanging on the edge of decision. finally, she shoves it forward with her toe. it slides into the machine. she grabs up the remote and turns on the set. the image appears. it's marla, looking like she hasn't slept in days, sitting on a chair in her apartment staring into camera. her eyes are glazed, distant. but she looks a hell of lot better than she did in the bathroom.}

<L>__{interior subway station night}
<A>__{a thunderous noise trails a subway car as it streaks out of a station. lit with cold fluorescent light, amy, now dressed, with her sunglasses in place, slides her card through the slot and shoves through the turnstile. she descends the long, non working escalator the only one on it at this time of night. she reaches the subway platform. it is virtually empty. amy has come down stairs that land her just about in the middle. she scans the far end of the platform, past a lone figure in a shiny green plastic raincoat who lies motionless on a bench. a couple middle aged guys in security uniforms, maybe heading for some night shift somewhere, stand, not moving, hands thrust in pockets. she turns back to the bench but the figure in the shiny green raincoat is gone. she takes up a position at the far end of the platform. she waits. a moment later, a bit of a breeze starts moving her hair. a few seconds later, a train comes roaring into the station. amy watches the car pass her, one by one, as the train slows. the train is virtually empty. one car after the next rolls by as the train slows. finally, as the train moves slowly to a stop, a car different from the others comes in. this one, for some odd reason, seems to have newspaper covering all the windows taped up from the inside. one of the doors of the covered car comes to a stop directly in front of the spot where amy is standing the spot marked by the stenciled puzzle box. there's a pause, then the doors slide open just one the one set in front of amy. the others stay closed. the interior of the car is dark the lights, apparently, are not working. a tall odd looking man in a conductor's uniform is standing there. he gestures toward the adjoining car.}

<L>__{interior subway car night}
<A>__{the interior of the car has been transformed into some odd ball cross between a very small nightclub and an crackhouse.. as the train passes out of the station, and the lights dim, we can see the lights from joints and crack pipes or at any rate something being smoked in some kind of pipe, glinting in the darkness. various hands reach up and tug down the newspapers, and the tunnel lights come in, providing a flickering, constantly changing illumination. in the uncertain light, amy can see the various celebrants hanging out some on the seats, some on the floor, some dressed, some partially undressed, some engaging in desultory drug use, others in desultory sex acts mostly teenagers and twenty nothings. amy looks around, not particularly effected by the oddness of the scene. the conductor touches her arm.}
<C>__{conductor}
<D>__{down that way...}
<A>__{she threads her way through the tangle of people. in the flickering lights she catches glimpses of pale human flesh, pierced faces, pierced nipples pierced things that we can't even be sure what they are. expressions flash by in the flickering light, some dull, others laughing. she pretty much ignores it all as she makes her way toward the rear of the car. a rat feeds on the contents of a young woman's purse as she and another woman are tangled in passion. there, illuminated in flashes, joey, a thin ill shaven english guy in his mid twenties is sprawled on a seat. one of his lower eyelids has a ring in it. it flicks up every time he blinks. he reads a newspaper while a woman bobs her head up and down in his lap. joey looks up and spots amy. he points an accusing finger at her, but his mood is good natured..}

<D>__{least you got to travel. what were they going to charge me with, anyway?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{charge you? they were thinking of shipping you to the government asylum for observation and believe me if you go in there, you don't come out. but through my mastery of international negotiations i managed to convince them that you were merely irresponsible. you got your stuff?}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{slowly, feeling her bruises, amy gets up.}

<C>__{amy}
<D>__{why'd you give me this story?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{who else would have taken it? either they're going to think it's bull shit, or they're going to be too afraid of it. but amy klein... tell me it's real amy.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{it's real or i'm crazy.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{well, either way, it's a good story.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i've got leads. i will know in the end.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{you know, amy dearest, for the average person, hunger for knowledge is like hunger... for food. we want to know just enough to take the edge off our appetite. then we're satisfied, and we stop. but you... you're like a glutton. you can't help over eating.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i don't see you complaining.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{but you see, that's the pointerior that's why i need you. because all that stuff i don't eat... i still want. so i send you in to do the eating for me, and so i get to experience it, without actually suffering any mental indigestion.}

<D>__{that's for me...}
<C>__{charles}

<C>__{amy}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{you see, amy, you never grew up with all this catholic god and guilt stuff. it doesn't mean anything to you. i worry about god and heaven and hell. not during the day, you understand, but around three in the morning, it keeps me up. i want to know what's coming. what's up in heaven and down in hell, or even if there's nothing. it's useful, when you're making plans. so go find out and we'll tell the world.}
<C>__{amy}

<A>__{charles hops in the cab and drives off as amy walks up the steps to the hotel lobby. amy watches him go, waves, then spins back towards the curb. she flags down a cab and hops in.}
<L>__{exterior poteilari and minvara day}
<A>__{a ragged, run down place, looking bleak and ugly in the bright light of day. we see the street sign, identifying the place poteilari and minvara. a cab pulls up and amy gets out. she crosses the street, passes one side door and then comes to a building that's been sealed up doors and windows cemented shut with cinder blocks. beyond a narrow railing is a stairway, pressed up sideways against the building, running down to a basement entrance. amy looks down the stairway to it's narrow bottom. the stairs and the bottom are littered with trash. a filthy mattress lies at the very bottom. amy heads down.}
<L>__{exterior the bottom of the stairs day}
<A>__{at the bottom of the stairs, there's a wooden door. a hole has been punched through it and a heavy padlocked chain has been threaded through it and through a heavy hasp that's been bolted to the door frame. some official government notice of some kind has been tacked to the door long rendered unreadable by the effects of time. amy inspects the padlock. it's heavy and uncompromising. she tugs on the door and it opens to the limits of the chain but that's only a few inches. amy peers into the darkness beyond, but can't see a thing. she looks down at the mattress that she's standing on, steps to the side and shoves it up. then, as if the light breaks, she reaches out, grabs the hasp and pulls. the bolts holding the hasp to the wall are loose. they slide out with it. she tugs the whole thing free and pulls the door open. there is a narrow corridor beyond, all in gloom. amy enters.}
<L>__{interior the corridor day}
<A>__{amy steps in, her way illuminated only by the indefinite light that leaks in from the street. there's an archway, presumably leading into the rest of the basement, on one side, but it's blocked by a great heap of rubble. amy ponders the chances of getting through it, and decides to check out the rest of the hallway. she works her way through a series of ominous corridors. amy senses that she is not alone, stops, and turns around. no one. she continues. there is only a single door left at the far end of the hallway. it hangs half open, but we cannot see what's inside. she approaches it, reaches out and pushes the door open. it's a bathroom. as she enters we see a figure beyond her in the hallways, buried in the shadows.}
<L>__{interior the bathroom day}
<A>__{this is one of those nasty little makeshift places built into an available corner basically a toilet and a sink so close that there's hardly room to move. a mop and some other supplies, long forgotten, are propped up in a corner. amy steps in, looks down the toilet. nothing left but some nasty stains the water long dried up. her face brushes against something hanging in the air. she pulls back. it's a pull string hanging from a naked light bulb. she tugs on it. nothing. no power here. she stands in the dark, claustrophobic place, puzzled. she looks back down the hall. it seems as if she's come to another dead end. then she stares at the bathroom door. open now, it blocks a piece of the bathroom wall the only place she hasn't looked. amy steps back, virtually straddling the toilet, and pushes the door closed. as she does, of course, what little light there is, vanishes completely. if there's something behind the door, she can't see it, or anything else. abruptly, there's a sharp click as she lights her lighter, and the wavering light illuminates the tiny bathroom and the previously unseen space behind the door. the walls do not meet there. there is a narrow gap, leading to a passage, apparently "between" the walls, perhaps ten inches wide. hesitating only a moment, amy turns sideways and slides herself into the claustrophobic slot. she holds the lighter up ahead of her, but its dim flickering light does not reach to the end of the passage. she moves forward cautiously the floor is littered with dried chunks of plaster, rotting insulation seventy five years of stuff crumbled from the insides of the walls. as she disappears into the tunnel, the door slowly opens behind her. passing across the rusty doorknob, a menacing blade appears. inside the tunnel, amy reaches a vertical pipe up against one side of the wall only a few inches thick, but it reduces the available room to under eight inches. she hesitates. meanwhile, the lighter in her hand is getting hot. she lets it click off. in some dim half light we can see her slipping a handkerchief carefully around it, for insulation. she flicks the flinterior the lighter lights. and, abruptly, around a million roaches , which had returned from their hiding places in the absence of the light, go skittering every which way. amy lets out a squeak as the roaches vanish in an instant.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{christ...}
<A>__{she looks at the pipe again, and then starts to squeeze past it. it's a tight fit. she has to squirm to get through.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{welcome to club anorexia...}
<A>__{she pops free and comes out the other side. she holds up the lighter. still the light cannot reach to the end of the passage. steeling herself, she moves on. but as she does, the space seems to get progressively narrower and narrower. from ten inches to nine, to eight, until both sides of her body are scraping against the walls. she holds the lighter out. the wall continues to narrow. at the end of her outstretched arm, the walls are only around five inches apart.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what the...}
<A>__{clearly, she's reached the end of the line. annoyed, she starts to back out then realizes that the light on the far side of her body renders the area into which she's now moving essentially black as midnight. she brings the hand holding the lighter close in to her body, but she can't bring her hands together in front of her the space is too narrow. finally, she reaches her hand up, over her head, passing the lighter from one hand to the other directly over her head. as she does, the lighter almost slips. she grabs for it, but it goes out. again she is lost in virtual darkness. she strikes the flinterior it flickers but doesn't light. as she strikes it again, it lights something in there with her! amy doesn't see it, we do...}
<B>__{and it has a knife in its hands.}
<A>__{the light returns now illuminating the other side of her body the way from which she's come. but, because the space is so narrow, she can't turn her head towards the entrance. once again, the roaches go skittering away. and amy starts heading "back" from where she entered. her head facing away from her progress backward, trying to squeeze through. she holds up the lighter, it lights the area "ahead" which she cannot see. the flickering fire exposes the figure awaiting her. the walls on this side now also seem to narrow. the space revealed by the light is barely as wide as her fist, and there is only darkness beyond. darkness, and the figure with the knife. amy senses something is wrong.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what the ...}
<A>__{she continues, but now she can barely move a few feet before the wall becomes too narrow to pass. she pushes, trying to shove through the narrow gap. but she cannot move. the walls have literally closed in, until she is now squeezed between them. panic sets in. gasping, amy pushes against the wall she's facing. trying desperately to turn her head around. she forces with all her might to turn her head, her facial features stretching almost comically. she finally gets it around. she is face to face with the knife as it comes ripping through frame, narrowly missing her arm. amy screams and drops the lighter. now in darkness, she scurries frantically away back deeper into the space. amy starts struggling, panic growing on her, trying to climb, to crouch, to tug free in some direction, but her movement is very limited. the walls seem to close in on her. she is struggling to breathe against the pressing walls. the figure keeps advancing towards her.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{stop! please stop! stop this!}
<A>__{she's flailing her arms now, frantic. the knife wielding figure struggles, having difficulty as well. one of amy's hands flies back and hits the wall behind her. now she really panics, her hands desperately scraping along the wall looking for anyway out. there isn't any. she looks back toward her attacker, who's now right on top of her and raising the knife for one final blow. amy braces for the blade's impact as she pushes against the wall when suddenly she falls backward onto the floor. her heart pounding. her breathing heavy. she checks her arms for wounds. there aren't any. she looks up. the figure is gone. she stands, confused, and finds herself in an empty room. some discarded junk, a pile of loose plaster. she leaps forward, and nearly trips on a piece of rubble to get the hell away from the entry. odd thing is...here is no entry. she whips herself around towards the sound of someone sharply exhaling. she looks this way and that, but can't see the source of the sound. the attacker? a pale light is visible, coming from around a far corner. someone steps into the light. a young black kid. he holds a finger up to his lips.}
<C>__{black kid}
<D>__{shhhh... follow me.}
<A>__{he signals her to follow him. amy moves cautiously forward.}
<B>__{an adjoining room}
<A>__{the walls have been partially torn down. the light comes from an adjoining room. amy approaches cautiously, remaining in the shadows, and leans forward, staring through a gap in the wall into the room beyond. the various participants, some of whom we recognize from the videotape movie, are standing crowded around something on the floor. amy can't see just what it is that they're staring at, at first, but she does see that one of the ones gathered there is katya, complete with the hole in her head. she nervously puts a a finger into the hole and inspects the blood. the sound of the exhalations is coming from the unseen place. then somebody in the circle moves, to get a better vantage point, and now amy can see, clearly, what is going on. winter is lying on top of the corpse of a young man, breathing into his mouth as he did with katya. an almost sexual encounter yields the same results as the tape. he takes a final deep breath. and then, as before, the young man gasps. winter pulls away. as he does, we can see the young man's face, smiling, despite the knife that is lodged into his chest. winters grabs the knife and yanks it out. the others come forward, helping him up. winter stands and somebody slips a robe over his body. he promptly looks straight at amy, still hidden in the shadows.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{i have a room of my own. kindly join me.}
<A>__{he throws the knife at the wall, where it embeds itself in way further then it should have, and walks away. amy moves away from the opening. she circles around, through a doorway, and into the space that she was previously watching. she moves forward hesitantly, trying to avoid the touch of the various occupants, who don't behave aggressively, but clearly press forward, into her personal space. she looks this way and that, trying to find where winter has gone. a hand comes down on her shoulder. she turns suddenly. it's the black kid. he gestures.}
<C>__{black kid}
<D>__{winter's through there.}
<A>__{he points toward a doorway, lost in shadow. amy notices on his pointing hand that his wrists have been deeply slashed. she looks down to the other hand, which the kid politely offers for her to examine. amy backs away through the crowd. following her is the recently revived young man, who's still completely naked. he smiles at amy. she moves away, and through the door to winter's room.}
<L>__{interior winter's room day}
<A>__{this is a small, dark space, light coming mostly from a rather conventional looking standing lamp. in the shadows beyond the little space of light is a confusion of half open doors, walls and shadows, half lit rooms with un guessable occupants. winter is there, sitting in a padded chair in front of a coffee table, reading a book. amy steps inside. winter doesn't react to her presence. abruptly, the door closes behind her. she hesitates and walks forward.}

<C>__{amy}
<D>__{marla warned me about it, about you.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{really? should i be honored or afraid that you are here, amy klein. do you really think you can just go along with us for a little ride and then get off when it suits you? like your new friends on the train? you're not going to find it so easy to get off this train.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{so i shouldn't get on?}
<C>__{winter}

<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what the hell does that mean?}
<A>__{winter leans into amy's space.}
<C>__{inter}
<D>__{listen to me. there are things that are true in the light of day. there are other things that are no less true, that live in the shadows. when you shine a light on them, they disappear. they stop being true. that's because it is the uncertainty of the dark that makes them possible. if the dark is deep enough... anything might be happening in it. anything at all. i'm one of those things.}
<C>__{amy}

<C>__{amy}
<D>__{she didn't want to become one of you, whatever the hell you are. that's why she killed herself.}

<A>__{winters studies amy face.}
<C>__{inter }
<D>__{we all die, over and over and over again. marla can't commit suicide. all she can do is stop believing that she's alive. and she can't even do that.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{the more she doubts, the deader she becomes. but she'll never really die, because she's not really alive.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{that doesn't mean anything. what i saw in that room was real. what i smelled was real. real like this table.}
<A>__{she raps on the table with her middle finger, palm up. she then lifts her hand up keeping her middle finger towards winter.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{real like, like this hand...}
<A>__{in a flash, almost supernaturally , winter passes seemingly through the chair and is front of amy, her hand held tightly by his. he reaches up with his other hand and uncurls amy's fingers.}

<A>__{she moves in, stares in the mirror sees the side of her face and her shoulder, smeared with black. she fumbles for the light, flips it on. in the sudden, shocking glare of returning light, color abruptly re enters the world... and the black of the liquid that's stained amy's face and hands, that track the floor of the white tiled bathroom, that smear the wall where she flipped on the light switch turns instantly to its true color the color of blood. amy gasps at the sight she looks like she's just crawled out of a slaughterhouse. she reaches behind her, feeling her back, trying to find the source of the blood that seems to be pouring out of her, dripping to the floor, pouring down the small of her back, staining the back of her panties a vivid, ghastly red. in a sudden impulse she turns on the water in the sink full blast, washes away the blood from her hands, scooping handfuls onto her face and the front of her body. the water drips to the floor, commingling with the blood, turning it a nasty pink. she reaches behind her back, feeling again her hand comes back as vividly red as before. again she washes them. she stops dead, seeing something in the mirror. something is glinting between her breasts. she touches her finger to it. it looks like a tiny bit of gleaming metal, poking out from inside of her, almost like a tiny steel splinter. it appears to have just barely broken through the skin from "inside" barely a drop of blood. she stands staring down at it, breathing fast. what the hell is it? then, slowly, almost against her will, she turns her back to the mirror and looks over her shoulder. she sees and we see for the first time the center of her back where her questing hands couldn't reach. there is a knife there, literally thrust through the middle of her back. the gleaming splinter between her breasts is the tip of the knife that has literally transfixed her and clearly transfixed the center of her chest her heart. she strains her hands back, trying to reach this impossible thing, but her grasping fingers can't touch it. she turns back toward the mirror, staring into her own eyes.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{it's not real... it's not real.}
<A>__{she clenches her eyes... opens them. her fingers feel desperately for the metal tip between her breasts. it's still there.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{wake up... wake up... wake up...}
<A>__{she starts slapping her hands against the side of her face not gently, hard slaps. but she isn't "waking up." she grabs her hair, pulls hard. nothing. she's still there. the knife is still stuck, impossibly in her back. she sits on the closed seat of the toilet... not knowing what to do. she reaches again for the knife, but she can't touch it. she buries her face in her bloody hands.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i'm dreaming, i'm dreaming...}
<P>__{(screams)}
<D>__{i'm dreaming!}
<A>__{she stands, turns this way and that, not knowing what to do. she looks around her bathroom, searching for something. she tugs open the medicine cabinet, searches beneath the sink, tugging the various stuff out. whatever it is that she's looking for, she can't find it. she spins back to the mirror. opens it. slips back against it wedging the knife handle between the door and the medicine cabinet. holding one hand against the mirror, she starts to push away, wincing in pain. we can see the tiny silver tip between her breasts vanish from view, drawn back inside her body . slowly, making a wet, sticky sound, the long thin knife begins to slide out. with a gasp she heaves out... and the knife goes flying. it bounces on the floor, splattering blood. with shaking hands, amy bends over and picks it up. she stands, staring at it. it's some kind of nasty stiletto. amy stands, staring at it.}

<D>__{hello, hello? hello? is there anyb...}
<A>__{then she stops dead. there is somebody there, and making a sound we've heard before. the nasty gurgling that amy heard when she tried calling marla's room.}

<D>__{only he can bring you back.}

<A>__{he steps towards her. she grabs up the phone, flings it. it hits the far wall and falls to the floor. winter's gone. she reaches a hand behind her, to her back, brings it back, red with blood.}
<B>__{a moment later}
<A>__{we see amy rolling a towel up into a tight cylinder. hands trembling, she lays it across a wide strip of duct tape that she's unwound from a roll and laid down on the table, sticky side up. she presses the towel down so that it sticks, then picks up the tape, with towel attached. she slides the towel down the center of her back until it covers the wound, and then tugs the tape tight across her chest, compressing the towel against the wound. she takes the tape and awkwardly loops it around the towel and herself a couple more times, finally biting through the tape and tossing the roll away. she yanks yesterday's clothes up, discards the skirt in favor of a pair of black jeans. she tugs them up over her bloody legs, pulls a black shirt on over her top, thrusts her bloody feet into a pair of heavy shoes and finally tugs on a black leather jacket. she goes to the mirror, turns, trying to see how her profile looks with the towel stuffed in her back. she turns, about to leave... then realizes that her hands are red with her own blood. she hurries to the sink, rinses them off, and rinses the blood off of her face and neck, then grabs her bag and heads out the door.}

<A>__{amy comes unsteadily down out of her hotel.}
<L>__{exterior dark street night}
<A>__{more shadows than light. she comes around a corner and onto a narrow street, moving fast, her feet making loud echoey clip clops on the street. there's a bum, dressed in rags, leaning up against the wall of a building. as she approaches him, he stirs slightly. then she looks more closely. the man is eating something very crunchy. he stares at her blankly as he picks crickets off the wall and devours them, one by one. he offers her one, and smiles. amy leaps back, turns and runs. some distance down the street, there seems to be a flicker of light, a trace of noise. she scrambles toward it. it's coming up from a subway grate. she throws herself down on it. down below she can hear the roar of a subway train passing below. indirect, flickering light shines up from below. she looks up. there's a subway entrance. she hurries toward it.}
<L>__{interior token booth night}
<A>__{amy comes down the stairs. no sign of life. the fluorescent lights flicker some dead. amy fumbles for her metro card. this is one of those unattended entrances with entry through the top to bottom turnstiles. she starts through the turnstile. then with a squeak, it sticks and she finds herself stuck half way through, unable to move forward or backward. she tries to back out, but the thing won't turn in that direction. she heaves forward. it finally gives way. she looks this way and that, back through the turnstile, she sees her bloody footprints leading all the way through. amy hears footsteps echoing towards her. through a large mirror at an intersection, she sees the source of the footsteps. a cop on the beat. amy looks down and sees she is standing in a pool of her own blood. the footsteps get louder. she sees a stack of newspapers next to her on a stand. she grabs one and throws it down in front of herself to cover the blood. it soaks threw in no time. the cop is nearing the corner. she grabs another, then another, and throws them down. the pool of her blood leaks from under them all. the cop rounds the corner, he has a baton he taps against his leg. amy grabs the whole stand and tips it over. with a loud smash, it spills the newspaper everywhere. as the cop walks in front of amy, the blood is hidden beneath the pile of newspapers. amy bends down to attend to the mess. she makes eyes with the cop and shrugs her shoulders at her "mistake". the cop smiles and nods, and keeps on walking. the sound of his footsteps vanish down the corridors. amy collects herself with a few deep breaths, and moves on towards the platform.}

<A>__{joey's eyes are empty, glazed. he's dead. not only is he dead, it's clear that he's been dead for awhile. then she freezes when she realizes the sound has completely dropped out around her. all she can hear is her heart beating. she slowly turns around to find that all of joey's celebrants on the train are also dead and surrounded by the familiar buzz of flies. some of the dead are hung from the hand rails by hooks and chains, their throats slashed, eyes gouged, bullet holes in the head, etc... a large female cenobite is sewing the filleted skin from one deaders throat open to reveal his vocal chords. he makes a sound at amy and his chords vibrate. but there's this one coke head guy who was snorting a line when amy got on the train. he looks normal as he snorts up the last rail off his hand held mirror. she studies him for a moment when suddenly he turns to her and we get a good look at his face. the entire left side of his face has rotted away and we can see the powdery coke lining his decaying left nostril.}

<C>__{amy}
<D>__{who?}
<B>__{s}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{winter. this is where he sends all the trouble makers. tries to show us who's boss. tries to make us believe.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{so it is real?}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{as real as you want it to be. we all have our own version of the truth, some are just more screwed up than others. but you wouldn't know that, because you still don't know the truth.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{you will. you see that's the pointerior all this, "deaders", "cenobites", whatever you want to call it, it's all about solving the puzzle. part of that puzzle is you. finding the secrets that are hidden within you.}
<A>__{marla pokes a finger at amy's heart. right on her wound.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{ in there. and as soon as you find that, as soon as you face it, you'll be free. once and for all.}

<A>__{marla looks around the room to see if anyone is watching her and then she takes amy's hand and leans in close.}

<D>__{so he's been on this quest for years, searching for that mythical person who is both willing to join us and can also solve the puzzle. and it would seem, amy klein, that that person is }

<C>__{marla}
<D>__{bingo baby. sorry.}
<A>__{she's trying to give amy a clue without tipping off anyone who might be watching her.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{he has to be there for you amy. and he will be. like he was for all of us. that's the key. without him, you can't come back. it's you he wants. its you he needs. remember that above all.}
<A>__{marla looks down at amy's chest. amy follows her stare to find blood starting to soak through her hospital gown. amy's eyes begin to glaze over.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{looks like you're running out of time.}
<A>__{amy leaps up from the table and suddenly marla is gone. in fact the whole room is empty and dead quiet. a pool of blood lies beneath her seat. she staggers a bit as she moves forward.}

<C>__{marla }
<D>__{it's all about finding the truth...}
<A>__{amy starts to slowly make her way down the long cold corridor. with each step she takes, the walls of the corridor become whiter, slowly bleaching out. she looks below her and sees the blood now draining from the wound. she stumbles back slowly and turns as the little girl's screams continue. then she hears the banging and rattling of a door. like someone's fighting to get out.}

<A>__{back to scene. amy is stumbling more than walking as she grows weaker with every step. her eyes begin to glaze over and her vision is beginning to blur. she looks down to find the trail of bright red blood trailing behind her on the otherwise pure white floor. when she looks back up she finds herself in }

<A>__{the closet door rattling at the far side of the room. the little girl (who we now realize is a young amy) is screaming on the other side. we now know this door. her father marches toward it, his rage building.}

<A>__{but it's over in a blink as she quickly buries it deep in his chest. he stumbles back from the closet in slow motion as }

<L>__{interior winter's room day}
<A>__{amy's eyes snap open as we quickly boom up to find her lying on a mattress in the middle of the floor surrounded by the deaders. she's in the middle of the ritual. the deaders are all chanting. marla and joey are there.}

<A>__{with a glance she can see that the puzzle box, in its solved configuration, sits on a make shift altar at the head of the mattress. winter is towering over her at her feet. he holds out a knife the familiar stiletto for her to take.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{you've gone through this before amy. go through it again with me.}

<A>__{amy looks at marla. she looks deader then ever. she chants with the others. winter holds the knife closer for amy. amy looks at the puzzle box. rays of light start to stretch out like hands and swirl from the puzzle box.}

<D>__{i can't.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{yes you can amy. you're one of us now, all you have to do is take this final step and let the pain go. and welcome a world of ultimate pleasures. an arm, bluish white, stretches out from the void trying to grab joey who ducks it's grasp.}
<A>__{the deaders break the circle around amy as more arms reach out from the void. the voices of tortured souls, twisted and warped, scream out for help in the wind that bursts out of the void. hooks and chains reach out and grab the outstretched arms, dragging them back into the void. back into hell. the deaders turn to winter they're all a little freaked out. from the look on their faces it's clear that this isn't at all what they expected.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{where are the naked chicks? the oil? the orgies?}
<A>__{it's not what winter expected either.}

<A>__{and with that amy slams the knife into the makeshift alter next to her. and that's when pinhead steps through the void and into this world. a few cenobites follow. all the deaders step back this is weird... even for them. amy leaps up and stumbles back as pinhead slowly approaches winter, carefully studying him as he does, until he's right in winter's face.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{i see that evil does run in the family.}
<A>__{inter is plays it tough. but it's all an act.}

<D>__{you can't hurt me.}
<A>__{pinhead smiles.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{it's not the first time i've heard that.}
<A>__{and then it's hooks and chains time. they reach out from the void all around winter and stab into him. he screams out in complete agony as they tear at him and stretch his limbs to the point of ripping them off.}
<B>__{and then they stop.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{and it won't be the last.}
<A>__{winter's screams subside as a rush of pain surges through him, numbing him. he's just able to turn his head to pinhead and crack the slightest "fuck you" smile. winter tries to talk, but the skin around his mouth is stretched too tight.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{when you attempted to challenge evil you entered into my domain. there is no way in but through me.}
<A>__{pinhead gets in close to winter's face.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{careful what you wish for.}
<A>__{now we can see the terror in winter's eyes.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{it just might come true.}

<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{this world, it obviously disappoints you all. perhaps that's why you choose to begin this journey. and as long as you so willingly accepted, allow me to finish off what he started.}
<A>__{and out of the darkness an oversized menacing chain comes flying out, harpooning straight through the midsections of all the deaders lined on the right side of amy. piercing them at all different levels. then another chain harpoons the deaders on the left side. the deaders look like fish on a stringer. they dangle there, suspended by the chains.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<P>__{(to amy)}
<D>__{and as for you. you opened the box, you brought us all together. you chose wisely. i'm pleased.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i didn't want any of this. they used me to open the box. i didn't choose to do anything.}
<A>__{amy looks to marla, she's got the fear of god in her. pinhead sees amy looking for help.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{she's one of us now amy. now a guide to the far reaches of pleasure. to a world where suffering is taken to higher level.}
<C>__{amy}

<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{you opened the box.}
<C>__{amy}

<D>__{and now you have it. but knowledge comes with a price and it's time to pay.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what about them?}
<A>__{we see the cenobites now with snake like tongues working their way up the line of deaders towards amy. they're preparing each one as they pass. poking them with large pins, piercing them, stitching them, filleting them, etc...}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{they belong to me now. they offered themselves willingly through him to me and now it's time for you to do the same.}
<A>__{amy grabs the knife from the floor and points it at pinhead.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{it won't be that easy this time. but yes, your father is with us too. and he's waiting for you.}
<A>__{these words pierce through amy. she looks at marla, now barely hanging on to any signs of liveliness. her head lifts up to amy.}
<C>__{arla}
<D>__{you're here to stop this amy. he needs your soul willingly. don't let him take you. don't go willingly.}

<C>__{marla}
<D>__{its over. winter is gone. you can't come back. you won't become a deader...or one of them.}
<A>__{marla looks to pinhead, then back to amy. they both know what she has to do.}
<C>__{marla}
<P>__{(her final words)}
<D>__{only he can bring you back.}
<A>__{amy sees the meat hanging off the chains. it used to be winter. she glares at pinhead with a sudden look of confidence, like a light bulb has gone off and she can finally see her way out. she raises the knife high in front of her. the two snake tongued cenobites move in closer to amy. they can't wait to have a little taste. for a moment, pinhead is pleased, then amy begins the deader chant, but reverses its meaning.}
