<L>__{interior the bathroom day}
<A>__{this is one of those nasty little makeshift places built into an available corner basically a toilet and a sink so close that there's hardly room to move. a mop and some other supplies, long forgotten, are propped up in a corner. amy steps in, looks down the toilet. nothing left but some nasty stains the water long dried up. her face brushes against something hanging in the air. she pulls back. it's a pull string hanging from a naked light bulb. she tugs on it. nothing. no power here. she stands in the dark, claustrophobic place, puzzled. she looks back down the hall. it seems as if she's come to another dead end. then she stares at the bathroom door. open now, it blocks a piece of the bathroom wall the only place she hasn't looked. amy steps back, virtually straddling the toilet, and pushes the door closed. as she does, of course, what little light there is, vanishes completely. if there's something behind the door, she can't see it, or anything else. abruptly, there's a sharp click as she lights her lighter, and the wavering light illuminates the tiny bathroom and the previously unseen space behind the door. the walls do not meet there. there is a narrow gap, leading to a passage, apparently "between" the walls, perhaps ten inches wide. hesitating only a moment, amy turns sideways and slides herself into the claustrophobic slot. she holds the lighter up ahead of her, but its dim flickering light does not reach to the end of the passage. she moves forward cautiously the floor is littered with dried chunks of plaster, rotting insulation seventy five years of stuff crumbled from the insides of the walls. as she disappears into the tunnel, the door slowly opens behind her. passing across the rusty doorknob, a menacing blade appears. inside the tunnel, amy reaches a vertical pipe up against one side of the wall only a few inches thick, but it reduces the available room to under eight inches. she hesitates. meanwhile, the lighter in her hand is getting hot. she lets it click off. in some dim half light we can see her slipping a handkerchief carefully around it, for insulation. she flicks the flinterior the lighter lights. and, abruptly, around a million roaches , which had returned from their hiding places in the absence of the light, go skittering every which way. amy lets out a squeak as the roaches vanish in an instant.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{christ...}
<A>__{she looks at the pipe again, and then starts to squeeze past it. it's a tight fit. she has to squirm to get through.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{welcome to club anorexia...}
<A>__{she pops free and comes out the other side. she holds up the lighter. still the light cannot reach to the end of the passage. steeling herself, she moves on. but as she does, the space seems to get progressively narrower and narrower. from ten inches to nine, to eight, until both sides of her body are scraping against the walls. she holds the lighter out. the wall continues to narrow. at the end of her outstretched arm, the walls are only around five inches apart.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what the...}
<A>__{clearly, she's reached the end of the line. annoyed, she starts to back out then realizes that the light on the far side of her body renders the area into which she's now moving essentially black as midnight. she brings the hand holding the lighter close in to her body, but she can't bring her hands together in front of her the space is too narrow. finally, she reaches her hand up, over her head, passing the lighter from one hand to the other directly over her head. as she does, the lighter almost slips. she grabs for it, but it goes out. again she is lost in virtual darkness. she strikes the flinterior it flickers but doesn't light. as she strikes it again, it lights something in there with her! amy doesn't see it, we do...}
<B>__{and it has a knife in its hands.}
<A>__{the light returns now illuminating the other side of her body the way from which she's come. but, because the space is so narrow, she can't turn her head towards the entrance. once again, the roaches go skittering away. and amy starts heading "back" from where she entered. her head facing away from her progress backward, trying to squeeze through. she holds up the lighter, it lights the area "ahead" which she cannot see. the flickering fire exposes the figure awaiting her. the walls on this side now also seem to narrow. the space revealed by the light is barely as wide as her fist, and there is only darkness beyond. darkness, and the figure with the knife. amy senses something is wrong.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what the ...}
<A>__{she continues, but now she can barely move a few feet before the wall becomes too narrow to pass. she pushes, trying to shove through the narrow gap. but she cannot move. the walls have literally closed in, until she is now squeezed between them. panic sets in. gasping, amy pushes against the wall she's facing. trying desperately to turn her head around. she forces with all her might to turn her head, her facial features stretching almost comically. she finally gets it around. she is face to face with the knife as it comes ripping through frame, narrowly missing her arm. amy screams and drops the lighter. now in darkness, she scurries frantically away back deeper into the space. amy starts struggling, panic growing on her, trying to climb, to crouch, to tug free in some direction, but her movement is very limited. the walls seem to close in on her. she is struggling to breathe against the pressing walls. the figure keeps advancing towards her.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{stop! please stop! stop this!}
<A>__{she's flailing her arms now, frantic. the knife wielding figure struggles, having difficulty as well. one of amy's hands flies back and hits the wall behind her. now she really panics, her hands desperately scraping along the wall looking for anyway out. there isn't any. she looks back toward her attacker, who's now right on top of her and raising the knife for one final blow. amy braces for the blade's impact as she pushes against the wall when suddenly she falls backward onto the floor. her heart pounding. her breathing heavy. she checks her arms for wounds. there aren't any. she looks up. the figure is gone. she stands, confused, and finds herself in an empty room. some discarded junk, a pile of loose plaster. she leaps forward, and nearly trips on a piece of rubble to get the hell away from the entry. odd thing is...here is no entry. she whips herself around towards the sound of someone sharply exhaling. she looks this way and that, but can't see the source of the sound. the attacker? a pale light is visible, coming from around a far corner. someone steps into the light. a young black kid. he holds a finger up to his lips.}
<C>__{black kid}
<D>__{shhhh... follow me.}
<A>__{he signals her to follow him. amy moves cautiously forward.}
<B>__{an adjoining room}
<A>__{the walls have been partially torn down. the light comes from an adjoining room. amy approaches cautiously, remaining in the shadows, and leans forward, staring through a gap in the wall into the room beyond. the various participants, some of whom we recognize from the videotape movie, are standing crowded around something on the floor. amy can't see just what it is that they're staring at, at first, but she does see that one of the ones gathered there is katya, complete with the hole in her head. she nervously puts a a finger into the hole and inspects the blood. the sound of the exhalations is coming from the unseen place. then somebody in the circle moves, to get a better vantage point, and now amy can see, clearly, what is going on. winter is lying on top of the corpse of a young man, breathing into his mouth as he did with katya. an almost sexual encounter yields the same results as the tape. he takes a final deep breath. and then, as before, the young man gasps. winter pulls away. as he does, we can see the young man's face, smiling, despite the knife that is lodged into his chest. winters grabs the knife and yanks it out. the others come forward, helping him up. winter stands and somebody slips a robe over his body. he promptly looks straight at amy, still hidden in the shadows.}
<C>__{winter}
<D>__{i have a room of my own. kindly join me.}
<A>__{he throws the knife at the wall, where it embeds itself in way further then it should have, and walks away. amy moves away from the opening. she circles around, through a doorway, and into the space that she was previously watching. she moves forward hesitantly, trying to avoid the touch of the various occupants, who don't behave aggressively, but clearly press forward, into her personal space. she looks this way and that, trying to find where winter has gone. a hand comes down on her shoulder. she turns suddenly. it's the black kid. he gestures.}
<C>__{black kid}
<D>__{winter's through there.}
<A>__{he points toward a doorway, lost in shadow. amy notices on his pointing hand that his wrists have been deeply slashed. she looks down to the other hand, which the kid politely offers for her to examine. amy backs away through the crowd. following her is the recently revived young man, who's still completely naked. he smiles at amy. she moves away, and through the door to winter's room.}
