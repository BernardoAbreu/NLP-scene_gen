<L>__{interior rainbow room night}
<A>__{annie and walter. there's champagne in their glasses, but neither of them has drunk a drop.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i don't know what to say about it, walter. it was a form of temporary insanity. but i had to tell you about it because }
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(matter of fact)}
<D>__{ it was a betrayal.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{yes. but it wasn't really. it was just...}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{so what happened?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i told you. nothing }
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{at the top of the empire state building }
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i'm not at the top of the empire state building. i'm here.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{not really.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{look, annie, i love you. let's leave that out of it. i don't want to be someone you're settling for. i don't want to be someone anyone settles for.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i have a life insurance policy, i'm fully invested in growth stocks, i have a paid subscription to home rox office, i have no sexual diseases, i have been steadily employed in a part of the economy that isn't soft, i have expectation in the way of inherited wealth, i dress nicely, i am a member of the private sector, an independent voter, i don't watch monday night football, the only thing wrong with me is that i am allergic to wheat, strawberries, penicillin, pollen, nuts and wool. there are plenty of women who see me as the brass ring. if you don't marriage is hard enough without bringing such low expectations into it, isn't it?}
<A>__{annie is nodding. she wipes a tear from her face.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{oh, walter. i don't deserve you.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i think that's what i'm saying.}
<A>__{slowly, gingerly, annie slips the engagement ring off her finger and hands it to walter. no bitterness here. both of them trying to be gentle with each other.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{some people will do anything to get out of going to a symphony.}
<A>__{this breaks the tension. both of them smiles.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{oh!}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{look!}
<A>__{walter turns to look over his shoulder at what annie sees:}
<B>__{the lights have just gone on on the empire state building}
