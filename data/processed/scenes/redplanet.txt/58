<D>__{johannes kepler was the first to accurately map the orbit of the planet. in 1609.}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{santen's dead.}
<A>__{they turn. but not surprised. they just figure he }
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{chewed through his air...}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{he threw himself off the cliff.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{ouch.}
<A>__{burchenal bows his head down for a moment, overcome. but it's not santen. it's the bigger picture...}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{it's not often you get to fail when 12 billion people are counting on you.}
<A>__{gallagher's got more pressing problems. checks his wrist. unnerved.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{i'm at under a minute here. you guys know what this is gonna be like?}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{hypoxia? dizzy. skin'll tingle. vision narrows. then anoxia. shock, convulsions, acidosis.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{gonna hurt?}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{a warning tone goes off on gallagher's sensor. he starts to gasp. opens his mouth wide. sucking in and out air that's worth less and less to his body. he begins to claw at the air. it's not pretty to watch. spins about seeking some release. none forthcoming. claws some more. falls to his knees. the others can barely watch. they know they're nexterior gallagher's growing more claustrophobic and crazed. falls the rest of the way to the ground. still clawing at the air. it's horrible to see. and in one last desperate, angry, trapped feeling move, reaches up and unhooks the front of his helmet and throws it back. croaks out a faint epitaph as he collapses.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{fuck this planet.}
<A>__{and he's still. still. and then in a last reflexive shudder. gasps. gasps again. takes in the worthless mars atmosphere. and right when we think it's entirely over...takes in some more. breathes again. and again. opens his eyes.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{i'm not dead.}
<A>__{the other two are watching in amazement.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{i'm not dead. it's like being at high altitude. there's not much air here. but...}
<A>__{takes him a minute to catch his breath, but...}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{we're not gonna die.}
<A>__{burchenal's suit alarm goes off. he doesn't screw with gasping in the suit. just opens the damn thing up and prays. breathes. raggedly.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{it ain't much. but it'll do.}
<A>__{he looks around, puzzled.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{what the hell's going on here??}
<A>__{pettengill's alarm goes off as well. much more tentatively he removes his helmet. breathes. he's not really rejoicing like the others.}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{i thought we'd be dead.}
<A>__{the enormity of what he's done strikes him.}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{i thought we'd be dead.}
<A>__{they all breathe the thin martian air for a moment.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{god, if santen had only waited five more minutes. what a waste...}
<A>__{off pettengill's completely unsettled face...}
