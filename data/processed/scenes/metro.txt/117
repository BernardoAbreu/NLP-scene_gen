<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{ronnie is making macaroni. roper helps to prepare a dressing to go with the salad. he is mixing oil, vinegar, sugar and spices. he lets her have a taste.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{mmm, needs a little something.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{what are you talking about? this is it. this is the stuff right here.}
<P>__{(beat; he tastes)}
<D>__{well, maybe just a pinch more sugar.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{yeah that's it.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{why don't you just stick your finger in and stir it up.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{scottie...}
<A>__{there is a long pause as he looks at her.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{what would you say if i quit gambling?}
<A>__{ronnie stirs the macaroni.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i'd say you'd be miserable... it's not the gambling. it's what the gambling got in the way of. the track is where you'd take your troubles instead of sharing them with me...}
<A>__{ronnie puts the lid on the macaroni. there is a beat before she continues.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{scottie, remember the day you lost that hostage in union square. you came over that night and we made mad, crazy love. but i didn't even know what happened... 'til i heard it on the news the next morning.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{it's because i wanted to keep you away from that world.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{it's not that world. it's your world. it's part of who you are.}
<C>__{roper}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{veronica, it's not easy for me... i don't know if i can change overnight. but what i'm telling you is that i want to share everything with you, because i don't ever want to be without you again.}
<A>__{the dog yawns. they laugh. roper moves closer to her. he kisses her and she responds.}
