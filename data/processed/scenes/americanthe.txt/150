<L>__{interior autostrada cafe day}
<A>__{empty. jack sits at a table at the back of the cafe. from here he can see both entrances: the public entrance and the service entrance and also the door to the bathrooms. through the window, he has a good view of the garage forecourt and the slip road to and from the autostrada. jack places the briefcase on a chair beside him and puts a paper bag on the table next to the sugar dispenser. he checks his watch. it is two minutes before noon. he orders an espresso. his nerve heightened senses take in everything: the sound of the cicadas, the buzz of the neon strip lights and the creak, creak, creak of the engine oil sign outside, endlessly revolving. jack's eyes flick outside to the forecourt. we hear the cafe door open. and in an instant, mathilde is at his table. she is dressed in a tight black skirt, a simple blue blouse and a dark blue jacket. her hair is neatly styled, her make up immaculate and heavier than we've seen her wear before. she looks exactly like the kind of woman who might carry a samsonite briefcase.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{hello. i see you have brought it in from the car with you.}
<A>__{she speaks quietly: her voice low and attractive.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{all there, as agreed.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{what's in the paper bag?}
<A>__{the waitress comes over with jack's coffee. mathilde orders another for herself.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{sweets. for your journey.}
<A>__{she opens the bag and takes out one of the tins. she can immediately feel that it's heavier than it should be.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i guessed you'd have a sweet tooth.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{that is most thoughtful of you.}
<A>__{the polite phrase sounds even more polite with her slight belgian accent. the waitress returns with the second espresso and mathilde pays for them both. jack watches as she stirs her coffee to cool it. she's nervous.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i suppose i will read about this in the times or the international herald tribune. or il maessagiero.}
<A>__{for a moment she is pensive.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{yes, i expect so.}
<A>__{she drinks her coffee, holding her cup in mid air and looking out the window. jack follows her eye line to check she's not signalling to an accomplice. the forecourt is still empty. creak, creak, creak, creak... mathilde looks at jack. her expression is impossible to read. perhaps it's tinged with sadness. she drinks the rest of her coffee.}
<C>__{mathilde}
<D>__{i'm just going to the ladies. wait here.}
<A>__{she picks up the case. there is nothing jack can do about this. she has taken him off guard and grasped the initiative. all he can do is wait.}
