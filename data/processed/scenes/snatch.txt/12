<L>__{7 ex.t. back alley makeshift boxing ring day}
<A>__{brick top (aka mr mclean) is a heavy looking fella. he is observing a giant of a man, bomber harris, boxing a sparring partner.}
<C>__{brick top}
<D>__{two hundred and sixty pounds, that's fucking pedigree pal.}
<A>__{he's talking to liam and gary, a couple of employees.}
<C>__{brick top }
<D>__{he doesn't look bad does he?}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{oh no mr mclean, he looks great.}
<C>__{liam}
<D>__{yeah great.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{he'll kill him, he'll do you proud governor.}
<C>__{brick top}
<D>__{do you reckon that's what people should do for me, do you gary, do me proud?}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{that's what you deserve mr mclean.}
<C>__{brick top}
<D>__{pull your tongue out of my arsehoie gary. dogs do that, and you're not a dog, are you gary?}
<A>__{taken aback by the change in tone.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{err no, i am not.}
<C>__{brick top}
<D>__{however, you do have all of the characteristics of a dog gary, all except loyalty.}
<A>__{there is a definite change in temperature.}
<C>__{brick top }
<D>__{and people like dogs gary, for the principal reason that they're loyal. so i don't quite know where that leaves you my old son, other than refuckinpugnant.}
<A>__{there is a problem}
<C>__{brick top }
<D>__{which one was it that kept the four grand from the clapham job?}
<A>__{pause}
<C>__{brick top }
<D>__{don't let me ask again. i would like answers, but i am not in the mood for asking questions, get busy lads, or it's feeding time, oink, oink, know what i mean?}
<A>__{liam takes a step to the side and moves his eyes in a sideways action implying the guilt lies with gary. gary catches this and opens his mouth to protest. one of brick tops's henchmen, errol, sticks a belt in there as quick as it opens and smashes a bar across gary's legs, he buckles. the henchman man pulls out a plastic bag and a roll of tape.}
<C>__{brick top }
<D>__{you know what to do with that don't you liam?}
