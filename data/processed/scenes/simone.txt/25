<L>__{exterior studio entrance day}
<A>__{elaine and an entourage of executives greets viktor's limousine on the studio steps. a studio photographer has a camera at the ready. a banner reads, "welcome simone". a young assistant wheels a cake. viktor steps out of the car. elaine pushes past him, into the limo.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{simone!... simone?}
<A>__{the car is empty.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(re emerging from the car)}
<D>__{where is she?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{good to see you too, elaine.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(ignoring his sarcasm)}
<D>__{why isn't she with you?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{why? because she would never show up at something like this. she's intensely private.}
<A>__{elaine sighs, exasperated.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(dismissing her colleagues)}
<D>__{back to work, everyone. she's not here.}
<A>__{the reception committee disperses, murmurs of disappointment.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{viktor... i want to thank you for convincing simone to sign with the studio.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{don't thank me. it was entirely simone's decision. do you have simone's check?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{i don't have it on me. anyway, it means a lot.}
<P>__{(quickly changing tack)}
<D>__{have you read the reviews? they're love letters.}
<P>__{(reading from a newspaper)}
<D>__{listen to this one. "simone has the voice of a young jane fonda, the body of sophia loren, the grace of, well, grace kelley, and the face of audrey hepburn combined with an angel".}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(musing to himself)}
<D>__{almost right.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{i can't wait to meet her.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{i don't know if that's going to happen.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{as i say, she's... something of a recluse. that's how she's able to stay so pure by isolating herself in her art.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(face falling)}
<D>__{don't be ridiculous. i arranged a press conference.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{out of the question. a circus like that?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{viktor, it's my studio.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{she's my actor. there are other studios, elaine. there's only one simone.}
<P>__{(leaving her on the steps)}
<D>__{leave the press conference to me.}
<A>__{viktor strides up the studio steps. elaine stares after her ex husband she finds herself smiling at his newfound arrogance.}
