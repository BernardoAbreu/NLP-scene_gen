<L>__{exterior a ditch night}
<A>__{a light rain and crickets chirping. somewhere in the night, dance music is blaring, but here it's only a whisper with a beat. water trickles out of a jagged pipe. splashing up mud, the riverlet weaves through hamburger wrappers and sunbleached beer cans, spent condoms and an old spin magazine. the tiny stream ripples past glass and trash and the body of a woman. face up, breathing. dead grass caught in her braids. her name is ronna martin. she's eighteen and bleeding. bleeding a lot. she tries to push herself up, but the dirt around her crumbles. her legs are useless. despite it all, there's a smile of perverse joy to her face, like she's just remembered the punchline to a favorite joke.}

<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{nah.}

<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{be good.}
<A>__{the woman is out the door without a word. gaines looks back over at ronna, not the least bit self conscious about the hat.}

<D>__{i take it this is not a social call.}
<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{i need a favor.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{a favor? wow. i didn't know we were such good friends, ronna. because if we were, you would know i give head before i give favors. i don't even give my best friends head, so the chance of your getting a favor right now are pretty fucking slim.}

<B>__{on gaines}
<A>__{on top of ronna, face in her ear. his hand wraps around her head, holding her tight. we can't hear what he's saying. ronna's eyes betray her fear. he backs off. she looks confused. he nods. do it. the music still blaring, she stands and slowly unbuttons her shirt. takes it off very self consciously. pulls her t shirt off over her head. just her bra underneath. he motions for her to turn around. she does, then back. her hands are shaking. she holds them together. gaines aims the remote at the stereo. the music retreats.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{you come here out of the blue asking for twenty hits. just so happens twenty is the magic number where intent to sell becomes trafficking.}

<D>__{todd, i would never fuck you like that.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{how would you fuck me? would you strap it on?}
<A>__{he climbs over the sofa to a dresser. in a drawer, he digs down through a pile of socks to find a wide mouthed bottle. and an empty tylenol bottle. blows out the dust.}

<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{there's this big christmas party thing. warehouse, you know. a bunch of us are doing sort of a pre party thing.}

<D>__{twenty at fifteen is 300.}

<D>__{it's just that i know you charge simon ten.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{inflation's a bitch.}
<A>__{he offers it to ronna, who doesn't reach out for it.}
<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{here's the deal. there's 20 of us. i need all of this. but i only have two hundred. i mean, that's all i have.}
<A>__{gaines undoes the cap of the tylenol bottle, starts pouring the pills back out.}
<C>__{ronna }
<D>__{no, hear me out. this two hundred is like a downpayment. you give me the stuff, i get the extra hundred from them, then i come right back and pay you.}
<C>__{gaines}
<D>__{see, that would be doing you a favor, and you know how i feel about favors.}
<C>__{ronna}
