<L>__{exterior courtyard day}
<A>__{hector is in the inner courtyard of the house, beside the kitchen. he is talking to gallus, who is lucinnius's ten year old son. hector has a close friendship with him. as we listen to their conversation it becomes clear that hector finds comfort in the boy, for the family that he lost. today there is an air of distraction about hector. understandable, considering his scheduled death. the kitchen slaves come and go as they talk.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{but even if it's round you can still fall off the edge.}
<A>__{hector has picked up a large metal plate to help him make his pointerior}
<C>__{gallus}
<D>__{no... it's not round like that... it's round like this.}
<A>__{gallus sees his playball. he picks it up.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{do you believe everything that greek tells you...?}
<A>__{gallus ignores this tease, intent on the ball.}
<C>__{gallus}
<D>__{rome must be right in the middle... here... and we must be out here somewhere...}
<A>__{hector becomes more interested.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{so, where is my home?}
<C>__{gallus}
<D>__{how many months did they march you here?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{seven.}
<A>__{gallus walks out the distance from rome with his fingers, as if there is serious calculation.}
<C>__{gallus}
<D>__{it must be about here.}
<A>__{his fingers stop on the other side of the ball.}
<C>__{gallus}
<D>__{but then you'd be upside down...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i wasn't upside down... and how could you see the sun round there ... i saw the sun at home... every day...}
<A>__{gallus is stumped for answers.}
<C>__{gallus}
<D>__{i will ask him tomorrow...}
<A>__{hector remembers that he and the boy's father are supposed to die that night. he looks on gallus with a new tenderness.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{yes, tell me tomorrow... i'd like to know... because my children are round there and i want to know that they're getting the sun... ask him something else, too... where are the gods if the whole thing is round?}
<C>__{gallus}
<D>__{i think i know that... they're out here, and all around... that's how they can look down and see everything...}
