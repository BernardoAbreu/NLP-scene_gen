<D>__{...i've sent her to the best hospitals, she's seen all the best doctors. it doesn't matter. two weeks later she's on the street. new york, vancouver, pittsburgh, toronto, l.a. the next time i hear from her, it's a phone call scamming for money. money for school, or money for a new kind of therapist, or money for a plane ticket home. 'oh daddy, just let me come home...please, daddy, i have to see you...' but she never comes home. i'm always at the airport, but she's never there. ten years of this, ten years of these lies, of imagining what happens if i don't send the money, of kicking down doors and dragging her out of rat infested apartments, of explaining why that couldn't be my daughter in a porn flick someone saw...well, enough rage and helplessness, and your love turns to something else.}
