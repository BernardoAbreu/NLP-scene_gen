<L>__{exterior cabin, klamath lake afternoon}
<A>__{an old wood cabin set on the shore of the lake. dulaney and rebecca get out of the car and walk towards it.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i figured if we have to talk all day we might as well do it someplace nice.}
<P>__{(looks at the cabin)}
<D>__{isn't it beautiful?}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{andrew loved this old cabin.}
<P>__{(fondly remembering)}
<D>__{he always dreamed about moving to tahiti living in a hut and becoming a beach bum.}
<P>__{(a sad smile)}
<D>__{i could never imagine myself doing that but somehow when he talked about it, he made it sound so alive so wonderful. soft ocean breezes and beautiful sunsets leaving the world and it's problems behind. i wish he'd had a chance to do it.}
<A>__{her mind drifts away for a moment, locked on some distant memory.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(snapping out of it)}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{it's okay.}
