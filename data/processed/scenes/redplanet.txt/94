<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{i came to apologize. you were uncomfortable with a situation the other day, and i made you more uncomfortable for my own amusement. i'm sorry. it's too small a ship for playground games.}

<A>__{she slithers by him before he can stop her to find burchenal tending a huge contraption of glass tubing, bunsen burners and filtration tanks.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{he's teaching me. about biology. i've developed an interest in...}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{...fermentation?}
<A>__{even when you make it out of high tech glassware, a still looks just like a still.}
<C>__{bowman}
<P>__{(stern)}
<D>__{you built a still?}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{it's a science experiment. did you know that an ounce of red wine per day actually benefits your heart?}
