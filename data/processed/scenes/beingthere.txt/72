<L>__{interior rand library morning}
<A>__{rand and chance come into the library and the president goes to rand with both hands outstretched.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{ben!}
<C>__{rand}
<P>__{(very weak)}
<D>__{... mr. president, how good to see you.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{it's so good to see you too, ben, you look terrific!}
<C>__{rand}
<P>__{(barely able to stand)}
<D>__{i'm not convinced of that, mr. president, but your visit has raised my spirits...}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{well, i'm delighted to be here, my friend. i've missed you.}
<P>__{(guides rand to chair)}
<D>__{here, sit down, get off your feet.}
<A>__{as rand sinks into the chair, chance approaches the president with both hands outstretched.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{good morning, mr. president.}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{... hello.}
<A>__{chance and the president exchange a two handed handshake. rand, still weak from standing, catches his breath and introduces chance.}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{mr. president, i'd like you to meet my dear friend, mr. chauncey gardiner.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{mr. gardiner, my pleasure.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{you look much taller on television, mr. president.}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{... oh, really...}
<C>__{rand}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{you will find that my house guest does not bandy words, mr. president.}
<A>__{the president gives chance a look, then laughs.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{well, mr. gardiner, that's just fine with me i'm a man that appreciates a frank discussion... be seated, please, mr. gardiner...}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(sitting)}
<D>__{yes, i will.}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(also sits)}
<D>__{now, ben, did you happen to get a chance to...}
<A>__{chance perks up at the mention of his name, interrupts.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{there is a beat as the president looks at chance quizzically, then he continues.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{i just wondered if you had gone over my speech, ben.}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{yes, i did.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{... well?}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{overall pretty good. but, mr. president, i think it's very dangerous to resort to temporary measures at this stage of the game.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{well, ben... i...}
<C>__{rand}
<D>__{i sympathize with your position, mr. president, i know how difficult it is to be straightforward, the reaction to such a speech could be chaos.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{that's too big a risk, i can't take the chance.}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(again perks up)}
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{once again, the president gives chance a puzzled look.}
