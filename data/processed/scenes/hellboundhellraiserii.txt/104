<L>__{interior knife room}
<A>__{this is a small square room. with the exception of the doorway to the brothers room, every inch of the walls is covered with sharp and deadly looking double bladed knives ie one blade is buried in the wall up to a central hilt handle and the other blade juts out menacingly into the room. the two brothers tumble into the room. their grips loosened by their fall through the wall, they land on the floor and rise to their feet, staring at each other but taking in the vicious nature of the room as well.}

<D>__{how convenient.}
<A>__{kirsty comes through and gasps as she sees the walls.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{stay there, baby. don't come in.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yes. stay there. i will be with you in a minute.}
<A>__{larry and frank trade blows. frank lands a powerful blow to larry's jaw. it straightens larry up and frank slams the flat of his hand against his brother's chest. larry flies backwards. he flings out his arm to balance himself but he is nearer to the wall than he thinks and the impetus of his fall drives his arm onto the knives. larry cries out. frank grins and prepares to force his wounded brother completely onto the knives. suddenly kirsty flies across the room at frank and beats at his back with her fists. frank snarls and, without turning around completely, flings her away from him. kirsty goes flying but lands just safely short of the deadly walls. larry, in the pause kirsty gave him and galvanized by her example, has found more strength. he pulls his arm painfully forward, clear of the knives, and throws himself to the side, forcing frank onto the knives. with a vicious push, larry impales his brother completely. frank howls, loud and long. without pausing, larry pulls a knife free from the wall and, with one vicious slice, separates himself from his brother. larry rushes to kirsty and helps her to her feet. they embrace. there is a cry of horror off camera. we pull out. tiffany has followed her friend. she stares in shock at larry's wounded arm and at the impaled frank.}
