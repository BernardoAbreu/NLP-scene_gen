<L>__{interior sonar shack}
<A>__{sonny wakes up with a start as the hum revs up into a loud whine and then fades away. he scrambles to track it. too late.}
<L>__{interior corridor}
<A>__{hippy emerges from the can and looks down, puzzled, at the puddle running the length of the corridor. he missed the whole thing.}
<L>__{interior mess hall}
<A>__{light on. everybody there. lindsey is really strutting, high on life, now that she's been proven right.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{okay, raise your hand if you think that was a russian water tentacle. lieutenant? no? well, a breakthrough.}
<A>__{coffey is looking out from under his eyebrows like nicholson in "the shining". bud give her a warning look. don't poke at the rattler.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{you done impressing yourself, ace?}
<C>__{one night}
<D>__{no way that could just be seawater.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{they must've learned how to control water... i mean at a molecular level. they can plasticize it, polymerize it... whatever. put it under intelligent control.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{maybe their whole technology is based on that. controlling water.}
<A>__{coffey is hunched over, elbows on his knees. his hands are out of sight. his arm is moving in a slow rhythm. we can't see what he's doing.}
<C>__{hippy}
<D>__{that thing was probably their version of big geek... like an rov.}
<C>__{catfish}
<D>__{just checking is out, huh? how come?}
<A>__{angle under the table, showing what coffey is doing. he has his k bar knife gripped white knuckle in one hand. he is drawing it slowly and repeatedly across the skin of the other forearm. neat chevrons of blood from wrist to elbow. c.u. coffey he doesn't flinch. his eyes are hard and bright as diamond drills. no one notices. he's keeping the edge.}
<C>__{lindsey}
<D>__{they're curious, maybe. we could be the first people they've seen up close.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{hope they don't judge the whole race offa us.}
<C>__{catfish}
<D>__{maybe i oughta shave.}
<A>__{coffey stands abruptly, snags schoenick with his eyes, and leaves, walking through the group as if they were smoke. this cold behavior brings the mood down a notch.}
