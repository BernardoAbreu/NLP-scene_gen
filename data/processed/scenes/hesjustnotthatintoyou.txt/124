<L>__{exterior boat day}
<A>__{out on the sparkling water, neil's boat. as we get closer, we see garlands on the rails, on the bough. even closer and we see beth on the arm of her father. he escorts her down a mini aisle. on the bough of the boat is a tiny wedding. about six guests. and neil, waiting for beth at the altar.}
