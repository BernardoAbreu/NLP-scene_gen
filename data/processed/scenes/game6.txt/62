<L>__{interior the barber shop}
<A>__{nicky sits in the barber chair. elliot pulls up a customer's chair and sits with his back to the mirror, more or less facing nicky. the barber, an elderly hawk eyed man named dodgie, begins his preparations for nicky's haircut.}

<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{that was a big mistake.}
<C>__{dodgie}
<D>__{you should never be without a gun. in this city?}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{if he carries a gun, you have to carry a gun.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{we're making too much of this.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{no, we're not.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i'm not a lonely spooky writer like you. nursing a hundred grudges. i'm a man who loves life.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{we're talking about something deeper than grudges. how do we respond to personal attack?}
<C>__{dodgie}
<D>__{in this city? and you don't carry a gun?}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{how do we maintain our dignity and self respect?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{in other words why should we suffer silently at this kind of abuse? the man is out there ruining lives.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{it's your best play, nicky.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{he'll hate it.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{he'll kill it. he'll write a review so devastating it will shatter your career and cause the most unmanageable psychic grief. what happens to your apartment on the east river? your house in connecticut, where you watch things grow.}
<A>__{dodgie goes to the cabinet on which the cash register sits. he opens the cabinet door, slides out a drawer and removes some hand towels. there is something there he wants nicky to see. an old pockmarked revolver. nicky sees the gun.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{we were thinking of putting in a pool.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(quoting)}
<D>__{`the most interesting thing about elliot litvak is that he writes the way he looks fuzzy, grubby and shifty eyed.'}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm telling you as a friend.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{there are things that speak to us from the past.}
<C>__{dodgie}
<D>__{in this city you don't walk five feet out the door and there is somebody trying to take what's yours.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{your truth is locked in your past. find it. know it for what it is.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{shoot him, nicky.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{shoot him.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{the american theater doesn't need people like that.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{shoot him, nicky. not that we really mean it. but where does he live?}

<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{had to be him.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{she was very evasive.}
<A>__{nicky gets out of the chair. dodgie removes the sheet for him and elliot smooths down his clothes and hair, like a pair of grooms attending a warrior. nicky goes to the cabinet, gets the gun. he returns to the chair.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i'm enjoying this more every minute.}
<A>__{elliot takes an after dinner candy out of his pocket the candy he pocketed in the italian restaurant after lunch. he blows the lint off and eats it.}
