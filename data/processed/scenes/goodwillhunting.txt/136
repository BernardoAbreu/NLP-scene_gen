<C>__{will}
<D>__{don't tell me about my world. you're the one that's afraid. you just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry }
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{is that what you think }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{some prick from stanford that your parents will approve of. then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too.}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{i inherited that money when i was thirteen, when my father died.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{at least you have a mother.}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{fuck you! you think i want this? that money's a burden to me. every day i wake up and i wish i could give that back. i'd give everything i have back to spend one more day with my father. but that's life. and i deal with it. so don't put that shit on me. you're the one that's afraid.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what the fuck am i afraid of?!}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{you're afraid of me. you're afraid that i won't love you back. and guess what? i'm afraid too. but at least i have the balls to it give it a shot. at least i'm honest with you.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i'm not honest?}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{what about your twelve brothers?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{oh, is that what this is about? you want to hear that i don't really have any brothers? that i'm a fuckin' orphan? is that what you want to hear?}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{yes, will. i didn't even know that?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{no, you don't want to hear that.}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{yes, i do, will.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you don't want to hear that i got cigarettes put out on me when i was a little kid. that this isn't surgery.}
<A>__{will lifts his shirt, revealing a six inch scar on his torso.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you don't want to hear that. don't tell me you want to hear that shit!!}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{yes i do. did you ever think that maybe i could help you? that maybe that's the point, that we're a team?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what, you want to come in here and save me? is that what you want to do? do i have a sign that says "save me" on my back?}
<C>__{skylar}
<D>__{i don't want to "save" you. i just want to be with you. i love you. i love you!}
<A>__{will, full of self loathing, raises his hand to strike her.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{don't bullshit me! don't fuckin' bullshit me!}
<C>__{skylar}
<P>__{(standing up to him)}
<D>__{you know what i want to hear? i want to hear that you don't love me. if you tell me that, then i will leave you alone. i won't ask any questions and i won't be in your life.}
<A>__{a beat. will looks skylar dead in the eye. lowers his hand.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i don't love you.}
<A>__{he walks out.}
