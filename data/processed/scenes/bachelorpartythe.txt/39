<L>__{interior. the men's room}
<A>__{a small, white tiled, yet somehow not too clean, men's room, two urinal size. there is one washbowl with a small mirror over it, and two water closets with doors, separated from each other by a steel partition. charlie perches on the edge of the washbowl; he apparently came in just to talk. kenneth moves off camera for more practical use of the room. camera stays on charlie who seems depressed, pensive, sad. stay on him for a long moment. then ...}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(frowning)}
<D>__{you love your wife, kennie?}
<C>__{kenneth's voice}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{well, i've been married six years. i've got two kids that keep me awake all night long. every sunday, we go out driving in long island looking for a house that's going to take one, probably two mortgages. i better love my wife.}
<A>__{kenneth appears now, edges charlie away from the wash basin, so he can wash his hands.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't feel like going home. are you going? hang around, kennie. it's only about nine thirty, ten.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{it's after ten. it's about ten after ten.}
<A>__{kenneth rips off a paper towel. the only noise for a moment is the soft crumpling of paper as kenneth dries his hands.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{the party's getting a little wild in there anyway. eddie and walter got poor arnold nailed in there, they're trying to talk him into getting a girl. this party's going to wind up in a joint, let me tell you. this is a good time to blow.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(frowning)}
<D>__{yeah.... i should have gone to class tonight. i'm paying twenty bucks a credit. the least i can do is go to class.}
<A>__{he breaks off abruptly, turning away with a sudden frown.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i take one night off, i can't even enjoy myself. did you know eddie went back to europe?}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{no, i didn't know that.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{he was telling me he lived in paris for three months. i'd like to do that!}
<A>__{he ambles around the men's room, studying himself with unseeing eyes in the little mirror, poking the trash can into which kenneth is now dropping his wadded paper towel. he suddenly turns to kenneth, stares at him. kenneth looks at him in mirror.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm going to quit. what am i killing myself for?}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{quit what?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{quit night school. tonight was the first laughs i've had in years. i can't remember the last time i had so much fun. look what i'm missing. i'm making a pretty good living. i can support a wife and baby on what i make. i'm going to quit! i mean it. i'm going to quit. boy, what a time to have a baby.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{you don't have to quit school because you're having a baby, charlie. there are lots of guys go to night school with two, three kids.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you ought to meet some of these guys. they're just grinding their lives away. it's an obsession with some of these guys. i mean, what's the point? so i will go five more years to night school. so i will get my degree. so i will get a job as a junior accountant for three years at seventy five bucks a week. i'm making better than that now. and then it just starts. the cpa exams. by the time i'm fifty, i can start living. at this point, i get a heart attack and an ulcer, and they bury me in the ground, and they say: "that was charlie samson, the man who didn't see a movie in fifty years." why go through all that? i will quit. i feel so mad right now, you better keep an eye on me, kennie, because i'm going to wind up punching somebody.}
<A>__{the door opens. man enters to clean a spot off his tie.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{come on, let's go home.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what do i want to go home for?}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{you're in a lousy mood.}
<A>__{the man, finished with his tie, exits.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{charlie, go home. i can see you're going to get fried tonight and wind up picking up a tramp and you're going to wake up in the morning feeling like two bits.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it'd be a profit.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{charlie, about five years ago, i went without a job for seven months. alice was carrying our first baby. we were living on money i borrowed from my brother. i don't know if you remember me in those days, but it was rough. i used to go out every night, put a load on, and make a pass at any girl who looked at me. and i mean any. big, tall, short, fat, anything. well, one night i picked up some tomato somewheres, and we were sitting in a bar or somewheres, and i kept calling her alice all night. so she says to me: "my name ain't alice. who's alice?" so i said: "alice is my wife," and i got up and i went home.}
<A>__{charlie waits a moment for kenneth to continue, but apparently this is all kenneth has to offer at the moment.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{i don't know. i had a point when i started telling that story.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm not looking for another woman.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{yes, you are, charlie. you may not know it, but you are. so go on home, charlie, before you get any drunker than you are. charlie, you start messing with other women, something goes. it'll kill your marriage. it'll kill your wife. it'll just kill her. what my wife went through well, i don't even want to remember it. it's never the same with your wife again, charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm not looking for any woman.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{i think what i was trying to say was you stick with your night school. some guys have to make peace with themselves that they're never going to amount to too much. a guy like me. once i made that peace with myself, i found out it doesn't really matter what you amount to. i got a nice wife and two children i complain about all the time, but if anything ever happened to either one of them, i think i'd die. but you don't have to make that kind of peace, and you'd be crazy to settle for less than what you want. you want something, charlie. i think that's wonderful.}
<P>__{(charlie's eyes go toward kenneth)}
<D>__{you're a little drunk now, and you're fed up to the teeth. everybody gets fed up, charlie. you stick with it. you're going to be all right.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(touched)}
<D>__{you're a nice guy, kennie.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{sure. you're a nice guy too.}
<A>__{the door to the men's room opens, and a young man comes in, looks around quickly at kenneth and charlie bumps into kennie.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{watch it will you, mac?}
<A>__{charlie regards this statement a moment. then advances to the young man.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{wait a minute.... what are you, a wise guy?}
<A>__{he is all set to bust the young man one in the nose, but kenneth takes him by the arm.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{come on, charlie, let's go home.}
<A>__{charlie allows himself to be led to the door.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm just about drunk enough right now to bust somebody right in the nose.}
<A>__{kenneth reaches for the knob of the door, opens it, and the two men go out. they find themselves in the crowded, noisy bar. a jagged kind of intensity to the atmosphere as if some of the men at the bar might be gangsters. booths filled with men and women and some mixed up types. kenneth and charlie make their way through the bodies down to one of the booths where eddie and arnold are sitting and walter is standing, heavily drunk. eddie is expostulating to walter:}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(to walter)}
<D>__{... come on, will you? look walter, it's just the shank of the evening! what's so special in your home? you got a floor show every night? who are you married to, jayne mansfield? come on, it's not even half past ten!}
<A>__{walter sits heavily down.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<P>__{(smiling amiably)}
<D>__{we got to get up tomorrow, go to work, eddie.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{we're just starting! we got to get arnold a girl yet!}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{eddie, please ...}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{that's the whole point to a bachelor party! you got to get the guy a girl!}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{look, fellows, it's been a nice clean party ...}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{well, arnold, since i'm not going to see you again before the wedding, congratulations and best wishes in the coming future to both you and the bride.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{thanks a lot, kennie....}
<A>__{eddie turns to charlie, who is still glowering.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you're not going, are you, charlie? we're just starting! we got to get arnold a girl yet!}
<C>__{arnold}
<P>__{(to kenneth)}
<D>__{i want to thank you for the presents, kennie....}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{...no, i will stick around another hour or so....}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{... that's my boy....}
<C>__{arnold}
<P>__{(to kenneth, who is looking at charlie)}
<D>__{... honestly, i never expected any presents....}
<C>__{kenneth}
<P>__{(to charlie)}
<D>__{... aren't you coming home? ...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{... what for? sit around talking to my sister julie? ...}
<C>__{arnold}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{... i want to thank all you fellows ...}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{all right, stop thanking them, arnold. they just gave you a party, they didn't elect you president.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{... this has been one of the nicest nights of my life....}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{let's go someplace ... let's go to a nightclub.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{that's great with me.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{come on, ken.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{thanks a lot.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{... well, listen, fellows, i'm cutting out.... good night, walter, eddie.}
<P>__{(to charlie)}
<D>__{... you coming, charlie? ...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{... no, i will kill another hour.... come on, kennie....}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{no, you go ahead. i will see you in the morning, charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{okay, i will see you.}
