<A>__{the hands belong to breather masked miners, dismounting rapidly from an overloaded transport vehicle which was taking them to the space port. quail looks from them to melina, who is walking towards the group. quail's p.o.v. miners' masked faces the miners' desert garb, shield goggles and breathers add to the surreal nightmare quality of quail's tortured perspective }
<B>__{back to quail}
<A>__{in terror, lost, disoriented totally.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{am i dying?}
<C>__{masked miner}
<D>__{i won't lie to you, pal. you are.}
<C>__{miner }
<D>__{i'd say in about forty years...}
<P>__{(he and others}
<D>__{help quail to}
<P>__{his feet)}
<D>__{...come on, we've gotta get to the space port. that intergalactic napoleon's switched off the air. 2nd miner shippin' us all out. mars is finished.}
<A>__{a miner's wife watches them. she is crying. quail looks up at the sky. melina follows his glance. so do the others. slowly, but perceptibly, the color is changing from yellow to blue.}
<C>__{melina}
<D>__{it's happening.}
<C>__{miner}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{all the miners are puzzled, apprehensive. quail reaches toward the one who spoke to him before and pulls off his breathing apparatus. at first the man is shocked, then realizes he can breathe without it. quail takes off his own, then melina's all the miners watch in amazement. they all remove their breathing masks.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{that's just the start. next there'll be rain and growth and ... life.}
<A>__{melina embraces him.}
<C>__{quail}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{rekall could never have come up with anything like this.}
<A>__{melina looks oddly at him, smiling, mysterious. as the sky becomes more and more blue, more of the miners descend from the bus. softly at first, then with more and more confidence, they begin singing the martian national anthem. the music swells. quail puts his arm around melina. they both join in the chorus. it reaches an impassioned crescendo as the frame freezes and the end credits roll up the screen.}
