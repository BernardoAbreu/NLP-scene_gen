<P>__{(crying out, close to tears) lawrence!}
<D>__{get up! i need you!

<A>__{back in the bathroom, lawrence continues to grunt and struggle with his chain. suddenly the phone rings and he turns. he quickly moves to get it, but it is out of reach. he lays flat on the floor, just a foot away from it, trying desperately to grab it. in the hallway, tapp enters, keeping his gun aimed out in front of him. he looks down the hallway, sees nothing. cut to zep climbing down a ladder into another level, grunting in pain. tapp hears him and follows the sound down the hall. in the bathroom, the phone keeps ringing. lawrence grabs the hinged box, turns it upside down and tries to catch the phone with it. he cannot reach, and starts to cry loudly again. he tosses the box away, crying screaming as he tries to reach the box with his arms. adam watches with a terrified look, not knowing what to do. zep reaches the bottom of the ladder, leaning against it, moaning from the pain of his leg. he hears tapp above him, hobbles off further down the hallway. tapp climbs down the ladder, moving in the same direction as zep. as tapp can move faster than zep, he rounds the corner and catches zep hobbling down the hallway. zep turns and sees him, firing a few shots but missing. tapp ducks behind a large stone column jutting out of the wall. he leans out and fires at zep. zep falls back slightly but remains standing. if he got hit, it isnt clear where. zep then turns and quickly hobbles further down the hall. cut back to lawrence still crying and trying to get the phone as it keeps ringing.}

<D>__{lawrence! no! oh my god! what are you doing?!}
<A>__{lawrence holds the other end of the shirt in his mouth, biting it for a brace. the look in his eyes is one of complete madness and desperation. he takes up the hacksaw in his right hand, puts it against his ankle and starts to saw into his foot while adam begins to scream in complete horror. lawrence screams through the cloth between his teeth. the blood squirts up onto lawrences shirt and neck. adam collapses to the floor in his corner, screaming and wincing. back to zep rounding another corner in the hallway. he moves into an old break room and tapp runs in after him, finally catching up. tapp tackles him, tripping him backwards and causing zep to hit his head against and old mini refrigerator. tapp grabs him and brings him up, throwing him hard against the stone wall. zep falls down to his side. tapp grabs him up and throws him forward against a cage wall. back to lawrence, still sawing away, blood on his face, neck and shirt. back to tapp pummeling zep from behind in the back. a look of twisted glee is upon tapps face as he hits zep. zep falls to the floor, gun beside him. he looks like he just wants to curl up and die. tapp goes down for the gun but zep reacts, grabbing it. tapp grabs his hand, and zep pushes himself up into a standing position, the wall in front of him, tapp pushing up behind him, trying to take the gun. back in the bathroom, adam is on his hands and knees, screaming and crying as he begs lawrence to stop. lawrence does stop, sits up and tosses the saw of to the side. adam collapses forward a bit. back to zep and tapp, who continue struggling from the gun. zep squeezes his way down, groaning as he suddenly drops down between tapp and the wall, his gun aimed up at tapp. he pulls the trigger and the shot hits tapp in the chest, a loud surprise to the former detective. back in the bathroom, lawrence crawls along the floor, moaning. he finds and picks up the single bullet from his envelope, looks at it. adam watches him in terror.}
