<D>__{they're called squirbs.}

<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{mine seems to be a little undercooked.}
<A>__{dulcea sprinkles hers with brown flakes.}
<C>__{dulcea}
<D>__{add a few dried weevils and you'll never know the difference.}

<C>__{dulcea}
<D>__{what do you know of the great power?}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{only that we need it to defeat ivan ooze.}
<A>__{dulcea's eyes move from ranger to ranger.}
<C>__{dulcea}
<D>__{it is said that to those who possess the power... all things are possible.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{where did it originate?}
<C>__{dulcea}
<D>__{in another time, another dimension. it was brought here long ago by the "nathadians", a people who are now all but extinct. they built an impenetrable stone monolith to store the power and keep it from their enemies.}
<P>__{(ominous)}
<D>__{for thousands of years, beings from all over the universe have tried to obtain it... all have perished.}
<A>__{dulcea's words hang heavily in the air.}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{so how can we get to it?}
<C>__{dulcea}
<D>__{the only way to obtain the power is to achieve the highest state of being...}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{and how do we do that?}
<C>__{dulcea}
<D>__{by learning the ancient art of ninjetti. it is the genesis of what you on earth have come to know as the ninja.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it is the perfect union of mind, body and spirit.}
<C>__{rocky}
<D>__{look, zordon doesn't have much longer to live. and for all we know, angel grove could already be under attack. we don't have time for this.}
<A>__{as rocky is talking, a flubbery looking snout works it's way over kimberly's shoulder. she hasn't noticed it yet.}
<C>__{dulcea}
<D>__{you don't understand. if you do not have the ninjetti, the power will destroy you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{to reach the monolith we must traverse the neola jungle. we will train today, and set out on foot tomorrow.}
<A>__{the snout works it's way underneath kimberly's chin she screams for all she's worth. include a terrified snoggle. this is dulcea's ant eater like assistant. he jumps up and down, yammering and gesticulating.}

<C>__{dulcea}
<D>__{he wants to know if you'd like a cube of sugar in your tea.}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{ah... sure.}
<A>__{we hear a phoot as snoggle blows a cube of sugar out his snout and it splashes into aisha's tea. aisha stares at the cube a moment.}
<C>__{aisha}
