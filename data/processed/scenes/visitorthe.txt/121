<A>__{walter is sitting behind zainab's table in the fair. it's a long way from the classroom. a few young women walk past and browse zainab's jewelry. they look at walter who just nods.}

<C>__{mouna}
<D>__{me too. how long have you been here?}
<C>__{zainab}
<D>__{two years. i was in detention when i first arrived. three months. it was horrible. i would probably still be there but they closed the facility for poor conditions. they released some of the women on parole because we were...low risk. i met tarek one year later.}
