<P>__{(reading letter aloud)}
<D>__{"this day, three years ago, my last hope and pleasure in life was taken from me, and my dear child was called to heaven. where is his neglected brother, whom i suffered to grow up unheeded by my side, and whom the tyranny of the monster to whom i am united drove to exile, and, perhaps to death? i pray the child is still alive and safe. charles brookside! come to the aide of a wretched mother, who acknowledges her crime, her coldness towards you, and now bitterly pays for her error! what sufferings, what humiliations have i had to endure! i am a prisoner in my own halls. i should fear poison, but then i know the wretch has a sordid interest in keeping me alive, and that my death would be the signal for his ruin. but i dare not stir without my odious, hideous, vulgar gaoler, the horrid irish woman, who purses my every step. i am locked into my chamber at night, like a felon, and only suffered to leave it when ordered into the presence of my lord, to be present at his orgies with his boon companions, and to hear his odious converse as he lapses into the disgusting madness of intoxication."}
