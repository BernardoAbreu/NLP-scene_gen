<L>__{exterior boulder field day}
<A>__{the remains of an old rail fence lay beside one of the boulders. val, earl, and rhonda scramble over the wood, up onto the rock and stand there tensely. in a moment, the creature gently rustles the earth at the base of the rock. the monster's slimy hook tentacles slither out, searching the rock base. shuddering, the humans move as high as they can, well out of reach. the tentacles slip back beneath the earth. everyone breathes a sigh of relief.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{well, at least the bastard can't climb. pardon my french.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{probably couldn't move too easily on the surface.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{god, the live ones smell worse tan the dead ones.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{okay, now, how far's your truck?}
<A>__{rhonda points. they can see the roof of her truck, maybe a hundred yards away through the boulders. val and earl think about it.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{i don't know. if this one's any faster than that other one...}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{i think we wait right here.}
