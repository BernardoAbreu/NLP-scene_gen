<A>__{the evening of the final great rally. these shots remind us of and are identical with and supplementary to the "news digest" scenes earlier. the vast auditorium with a huge picture of kane, cheering crowds, etc. emily and junior are to be seen in the front of a box. emily is tired and wears a forced smile on her face. junior, now aged nine and a half, is eager, bright eyed and excited. kane is just finishing his speech.}

<D>__{it is no secret that i entered upon this campaign with no thought that i could be elected governor of this state! it is now no secret that every straw vote, every independent pole, shows that i will be elected. and i repeat to you my first official act as governor will be to appoint a special district attorney to arrange for the indictment, prosecution and conviction of boss edward g. rogers!}
<A>__{terrific screaming and cheering from the audience.}
