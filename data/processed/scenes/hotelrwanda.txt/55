<A>__{paul turns onto his street. the houses are dark: windows shuttered; gates closed; not a soul about. paul stops before his gate. honks twice. the gate doesn't open. he hops out and opens it with a key. gives it a push and pauses as he heads back to the car. he hears the far off sound of gunfire. distant explosions light the night sky.}

<A>__{paul drives in. his compound is curiously dark. his headlights sweep across his pitch black house.}
