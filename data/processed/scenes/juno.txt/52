<A>__{juno and mac have put their coats on and are in the process of leaving. gerta hands juno the documents. vanessa and mark trail behind.}
<C>__{gerta}
<D>__{so, look those over and give me a call at my office if you have any questions.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{juno, we'd really appreciate it if you could keep us updated on any doctor's appointments, ultrasounds, other things of that nature.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{oh. sure. of course you'd want to know how your kid is cooking.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{so, then, you really think you're going to go ahead with this?}
<A>__{mac stares at juno gravely.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{yeah. for sure. i like you guys.}
<A>__{juno looks at mark.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{how sure? percentage wise, would you say you're 80% sure, 90% sure?}
<A>__{mark seems visibly embarrassed by vanessa's manic demeanor.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i'm going to say i'm 104% sure.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{oh really?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{look, if i could give it to you now, i would. but it probably looks like a sea monkey at this point, so i think we should leave it in there for a while until it gets cuter, you know?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i think that's a great idea.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{that's great, right? stellar news. well, you guys drive safe, and we'll hear from you soon, all right?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{all right, take care of yourselves.}
<A>__{juno and mac exit. mark shuts the door. all is silent in the foyer. mark, vanessa and gerta stand motionless. gerta pumps her fist triumphantly, trying to create a mood of celebration.}
<C>__{gerta}
<P>__{(overly aggressive)}
<D>__{all right!}
<A>__{vanessa buries her head in her hands and weeps hoarsely.}
