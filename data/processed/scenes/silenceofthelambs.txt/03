<L>__{interior hotel room day}
<A>__{clarice's pov moving as she first sees, sitting on the edge of a bed a female hostage. black, late 20's, gagged, hands behind her back. then, swivelling... she sees a startled male suspect, white, mid 20's, standing by a window with a rifle in his hands. he is turning towards her... clarice drops into a combat crouch, gun extended, and shouts.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{freeze! fbi!}
<A>__{clarice's pov slow motion all natural sound suspended as the suspect faces her with a strange, pleading expression. the rifle is rising in his hands, but oddly enough, it is held across his chest, not pointing. then another puzzling detail registers... the suspect's hands are taped to his gun, away from the trigger; he couldn't use it even if he tried. suddenly we hear a metallic click, which registers with unnatural amplification, as clarice reacts, drops to the floor, rolling sideways, and the "hostage" pulls a revolver out from behind her back, still in slow motion, raising it in her untied hands. she fires repeatedly, flames leaping from the muzzle; the sound is an echoing roar in these close quarters, but clarice has come up on one knee, beside an armchair, and is already firing back herself, two quick shots, which send the "hostage" pitching over the bed, backwards, to shudder and lie still in a haze of gunsmoke. clarice rushes to her, clamping one knee down on her gun hand, still keeping her covered in case of movement. hold for a few beats... then we hear the shrill blast of a whistle from somewhere, off screen, as normal action and sound are restored.}
<C>__{brigham }
<D>__{okay, people, good exercise...}
<A>__{clarice relaxes, lowering her gun. the lights brighten.}
<B>__{pulling back}
<A>__{we see that we're in some sort of auditorium, with the "hotel room" and its "corridor" built as a training set. john brigham walks onto this set, thumbing a stopwatch. mid 40's, ex marine. his t shirt's lettering says "firearms instructor fbi academy."}
<C>__{brigham}
<D>__{starling's reaction time was excellent. let's break. critique in five.}
<A>__{a class of about forty young fbi trainees, of both sexes, begins to rise from their seats, mingling and chatting. clarice nods amiably to the "suspect", then gives her "hostage" a hand up. it's ardelia mapp, her roommate. her broad, clever face breaks into a big smile, as they both remove ear plugs. clarice's voice has just a soft trace of southern accent.}
<C>__{ardelia}
<D>__{damn, clarice, how'd you make me?}
<C>__{clarice}
<P>__{(indicating her gun)}
<D>__{never cock. just squeeze.}
<C>__{ardelia}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{i love it when you talk dirty.}
<A>__{as brigham joins them, clarice can't resist a star pupil's little smile of pride. he frowns good naturedly.}
<C>__{brigham}
<D>__{what're you laughin' at, junior g man? she got off four rounds to your two.}
<A>__{he takes out a steel coiled grip flexer, drops it onto her palm.}
<C>__{brigham}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{one hundred reps, each hand, every day. now tidy up, the section chief wants to see you.}
<A>__{he nods a direction, then moves off. clarice, with her smile finally fading, looks out into the auditorium.}
<B>__{special agent jack crawford}
<A>__{sits on the top step of the aisle, looking down at her. he is 53, strongly built. he rises impassively, exits through the back door. he carries a think manila envelope under one arm. ardelia who is helping clarice unbuckle her bullet proof vest, follows her worried gaze.}
<C>__{clarice}
<D>__{what'd i do?}
<C>__{ardelia}
<D>__{stay cool. just remember to call him "god."}
