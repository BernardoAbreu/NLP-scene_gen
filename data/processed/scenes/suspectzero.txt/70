<A>__{starkey lies, face up. shocked. squirming. bleeding. standing over him, looming large as a grizzly... is o'ryan. a long hunting knife extends from his hand. but his tone, to our great surprise, is conversational:}

<D>__{hey, listen, i'm sorta new in town. ya know where i can find a good donkey show?}
<A>__{starkey has no idea how to respond to this maniac:}
