<A>__{mike is dressed to the nines in classic vintage threads. he's trying to look at ease as he straightens his cuff links. he approaches trent who suavely leans against his worn down ride. he's a tall, slim, good looking cat. his sharkskin suit hangs well on his lanky frame as it tapers to his ankles. sinatra's "come fly with me" on the tape deck adds an elegance to the scene. they exchange an impish grin and depart without saying a word. maybe this isn't such a bad idea.}
