<A>__{john and luke wait. the prisoners enter. lara looks terrible. john stands and embraces her.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hey. are you alright?}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{i'm fine. i'm fine.}
<A>__{lara smiles to cover and bends down and kisses her son, who is engrossed in his toys as usual.}
<C>__{lara }
<D>__{hi, sweet potato. how are you doing?}
<A>__{he doesn't respond. she kisses him on the head then takes a seat. john sits beside her. they speak in whispers.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{the doctor told me about the insulin.}
<C>__{lara}
<P>__{(watching luke)}
<D>__{yeah, i forgot. it's no big deal.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you forgot? for how many days?}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{i forgot, okay? i have things on my mind.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{ and so much to do.}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{oh, that's nice.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{why are you doing this?}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{can i please just watch him play? tell me about kindergarten.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no. i need you to }
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{fine, i won't forget again, okay?}
<P>__{(trying to fight away these thoughts:)}
<D>__{i am just never going to walk him to school or wash his clothes or make him dinner...and i don't know how i can live knowing that. okay?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{lara. look at me. something will happen. i promise.}
<C>__{lara}
<P>__{(cruelly but hushed)}
<D>__{what? what is going to happen? there are no more appeals, there are no more anything. exactly what miracle are we hoping for, john?}
<A>__{he looks down, beaten. she lets go of her anger.}
<C>__{lara }
<D>__{i need you to do something for me.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{stop bringing him.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{come on...}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{he hates coming here. look at him.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{lara....}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{please. it's not his fault. it's too hard to watch him forget me.}
<A>__{john looks at his son, playing at a distance, his back to them. it's hard to argue with her, she's right.}
<C>__{lara }
<D>__{you want to hear something funny?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{yes. anything.}
<C>__{lara}
<D>__{my mother tried to send me anti aging cream.}
<A>__{john smiles, but like hers it may be the saddest smile in the world. they sit and watch luke play.}
