<L>__{interior tv station}
<A>__{hunsecker is standing at a table, stop watch in hand, reading aloud from a script which he is rehearsing and timing. beside him sits mary busy typing more of the material from hunsecker's handwritten note. mary is calm, but he is irritable, trying to concentrate despite the bustle around him. an old movie star, mildred tam, sits waiting in one of the canvas backed chairs supplied for the guests on the show. burton, a manager, also waits, deadpan, at hunsecker's elbow. hunsecker clicks his stop watch as he reads:}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{"i was reminded of it this morning, when i noticed that the birds had gone south. we want the same kind of freedom for ourselves that's what the man said!}
<P>__{(he clicks the watch,}
<D>__{pauses to underline}
<P>__{the phrase, continues:)}
<D>__{a man has the right to face his accusers! that's the american way! who said? the man said! from..."}
<A>__{he turns in exasperation to burton.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{burton, don't stand around. if i go over i will cut some items off the tail...}
<A>__{burton departs. mary whips a second sheet out of the typewriter, hands it to hunsecker. as he accepts it, hunsecker looks off towards the auditorium.}
<B>__{sidney}
<A>__{shooting towards the auditorium, from hunsecker's viewpointerior sidney mounts the steps onto the stage. seeing that the columnist is surrounded but knowing that j.j. wants to talk to him privately, sidney loiters so that j.j. can join him as soon as he chooses to. camera pulls back to include hunsecker. only momentarily distracted by private considerations connected with sidney's arrival, hunsecker returns to the business of timing the script. he clicks the watch again...}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{"from washington through to jefferson, from lincoln and f.d.r. right up to today the democratic way of life! that's what the man said! nowadays it doesn't export to well...}
<P>__{(then, concluding)}
<D>__{but you know...and i know...that our best secret weapon is d e m o c r a c y.}
<P>__{(dropping to a modest tone)}
<D>__{let's never forget it, ladies and gentlemen."}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{sidney lingers beside the old movie star who is listening, rapt, to hunsecker's words. sidney is less impressed with j.j.'s eloquence. at the conclusion, mildred applauds lightly. she stands up and moves towards j.j. j.j. wants to talk to sidney but is frustrated by the old movie star.}
<C>__{mildred tam}
<D>__{that's grand, just grand, j.j.!}
<P>__{(then, anxiously)}
<D>__{is my makeup all right? you know, despite the scads of movies i've made, i've never appeared on tv yet...}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(cutting her short)}
<D>__{of course, mildred. of course. you look fine.}
<P>__{(swiftly summoning mary)}
<D>__{mary, help miss tam anything she wants; she's our star today.}
<A>__{under the pretense of studying the typed script, j.j. walks away across the stage. sidney strolls after him.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{a tracking shot. sidney comes up beside hunsecker, falls into step beside him. as they cross towards a water cooler at the back of the stage, they talk in rapid undertone.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{i got that boy coming over here.}
<P>__{(a glance at sidney)}
<D>__{what's so funny?}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(who is smiling faintly)}
<D>__{with a pocket fulla firecrackers good.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(narrowly)}
<D>__{i think you loused this up but good. if i can trust my eyes, and i think i can, susie knows all about your dirty work.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{can't hurt...}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<P>__{(incredulously)}
<D>__{can't hurt? i had to get him back his job.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(smugly)}
<D>__{i like that, too.}
<P>__{(closer, faster)}
<D>__{look, j.j., we can wrap this up in one neat bundle, addressed to the dumps to oblivion. we're going great, but please play it my way. i cased this kid. know his ins and outs...he's fulla juice and vinegar, just begging for some big shot like you to give him a squeeze. do little sidney a favor: squeeze! you know, j.j. the porcupine bit needles.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{but it's too late. i got him back the job...}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(impatiently)}
<D>__{no, that's the point he won't accept your favor! the manager yes, but not the boy.}
<A>__{a pause. hunsecker renumerates.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{well he's got her in a tizzy, i will tell you that!}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{sure, he steams her up wants her to stand on her own two feet and all that jazz!}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{and who's feet is she on now?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{presumably yours...}
<P>__{(a hasty addition)}
<D>__{that's according to st. dallas.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{what's this boy got that susie likes?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{integrity acute, like indigestion.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{what does that mean integrity?}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(repeating as before)}
<D>__{a pocket fulla firecrackers looking for a match!}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{it's a new wrinkle to tell the truth... i never thought i'd make a killing on some guy's "integrity".}
<A>__{hunsecker gives him certain slow begrudging admiration:}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{full of beans, ain't you? but you know that you'll stand or fall by what you're doing now...}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(grins; confidently)}
<D>__{calculated risk. only we happen to know, j.j., that you like me. i'm your star pupil i reflect back to you your own talent.}
<A>__{hunsecker permits himself a faint smile. burton is approaching with script in hand.}
<C>__{hunsecker}
<D>__{i wouldn't like to take a bite of you; you're a cookie full of arsenic.}
<A>__{sidney smirks. he turns away and goes off towards the auditorium in the background.}
