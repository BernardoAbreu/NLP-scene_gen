<L>__{interior harald's den day}
<A>__{a bony nazi pouring tea in a shadowy room with you is bad, but the rabbit print tea cozy only makes it worse. blomkvist tries to ignore him settling back in his worn leather chair with his chipped cup, and sifts through an old shoebox of unsorted photographs: a holiday at lake como, early 1950's judging from the cars; a vanger family gathering long ago; some men posing by a slain wild boar dangling from a rope. harald holds out a pack of cigarettes. blomkvist comes over, pulls one out.}

<D>__{blom ... kvist ...}
<P>__{(lights the cigarette)}
<D>__{with an `o' or a `u.'}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{`o.'}
<C>__{harald}
<D>__{an `o.' blom kvist.}
<A>__{harald doesn't say it, but his nod means, `not jewish then. good' blomkvist returns to the photos, glancing up occasionally to the smoke curling up past harald's face as he examines the journalist at work.}
<C>__{harald}
<D>__{i'm not a recluse. i don't close my door to anyone. they just don't visit.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{perhaps if you redecorated.}
<C>__{harald}
<D>__{hide the past like they do. under a thin, shiny veneer. like an ikea table.}
<P>__{(blomkvist shrugs)}
<D>__{i'm the most honest of all of them.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{the family.}
<C>__{harald}
<D>__{sweden.}
<A>__{blomkvist opens another shoebox. lying on top is a photograph of the bridge accident, and, under it, a few more. he takes them out and angles them toward a lamp.}
<C>__{harald}
<D>__{two point eight.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{pardon me?}
<C>__{harald}
<D>__{the zeiss tessar on my hasselblad. excellent lens.}
<A>__{blomkvist tries to nod appreciatively, but the bridge photos don't tell him anything he doesn't already know. he finds several more that appear to be a hunting expedition men and blood hounds but then sees morell in one, more policemen, and a stricken henrik in boots and raincoat, and realizes this is the search party. off to the side, a young man, head turned half away, wearing a dark blazer with a gold patch, which that 2.8 zeiss lens makes clear is a prep school insignia. a lion.}
<C>__{harald}
<D>__{landscape? some nice landscapes there.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{no, it's i can't tell who it is from this angle.}
<A>__{he takes the photo over to the nazi who only has to glance at it a moment to recognize his late nephew's son:}
<C>__{harald}
<D>__{that's gottfried's boy.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{martin?}
<A>__{harald nods, hands it back, smokes. it's not unusual martin would have joined the search party it would be unusual if he hadn't it's his sister that's missing but this blazer he's wearing troubles blomkvist }
<C>__{harald}
<D>__{handsome but useless young man, martin. like his father.}
