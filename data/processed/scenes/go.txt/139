<L>__{interior bathroom at falafel hut day}
<A>__{adam stands mostly naked, his shirt off his shoulders and jeans around his ankles. loop the white dreadlocked guy retapes a transmitter on his thigh. a wire runs up to a microphone on his chest. zack and burke are by the door, watching. the bathroom is really cramped.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{you work out, don't you?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{you have to. it's in the contract.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{no, you have a great body.}
<A>__{the door starts to open, someone trying to come in. burke holds it shut.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{hey! people in here!}
<A>__{whoever was trying to come in gives up. burke pulls a college sweatshirt out of a shopping bag, hands it to zack. motions that he's supposed to wear it. as he's putting it on...}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{just so we're clear. whether you get something on this guy or not, adam and i are done today. finished. charges dropped. that's how it works, right?}
<A>__{burke smiles, an amused roll of the eyes.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{seems to me, if a guy's so concerned about the legal process, how come he finds himself getting busted for possession?}
<A>__{adam and zack share a look. a beat.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{relax. i sign your form and the whole thing goes away. your lawyer got you a good deal.}
<A>__{loop sits back, his job finished.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{is it safe to have a radio against my balls like this?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{loop}
<D>__{safe enough.}
<A>__{a beep as he presses a button. his headphones register.}
