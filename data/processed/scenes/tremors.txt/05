<A>__{val and earl are restringing a dilapidated, and seemingly endless, barbed wire fence. a few bored cows watch them.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{how many cows does it take to make a stampede? is it like three or more? is there a minimum speed?}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{i was in one. a bolt of lightning blew up cottonwood tree. three hundred head going hell bent for the horizon. wasn't so damn funny, i can tell you.}
<A>__{earl's hand slips and the fence snags him right through his thick glove.}
<C>__{earl }
<D>__{ow! god damn! is this a job for intelligent men?!}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{if there was one nearby i'd probably ask him.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{i keep thinking, if we were but half serious about money, we should quit being hired hands and...}
<C>__{val}
<P>__{(mock serious)}
<D>__{handymen, earl. we're handymen.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{whatever the hell we are, we should quit and go get ourselves some real employment.}
<A>__{val gestures to the vastness around them.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{what, and give up all this personal freedom?}
