<A>__{schuyler is using the plastic bag and his jacket as a pillow, his eyes closed. suddenly there's a knife at his throat.}
<C>__{punk}
<D>__{end of the line, man.}
<A>__{schuyler starts; the punk keeps the knife on him. he's a young, glassy eyed junkie. he wears a radio earplug in one ear, a wire heading down to his waist. schuyler nods, starts studying the man's arms, heavily tattooed with crude cabalistic symbols.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{are the tattoos supposed to mean something?}
<C>__{punk}
<P>__{(momentarily thrown)}
<D>__{yeah, they mean you're dead, you don't gimme what you got.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<P>__{(touches the punk's arm)}
<D>__{ok, there's the c...}
<C>__{punk}
<D>__{give me the fucking bag!}
<C>__{schuyler}
<P>__{(cold, deadly)}
<D>__{come on, you're not going to put me through all this shit and then kill me on a fucking train, it won't look like a suicide...}
<A>__{as schuyler speaks he sits up, the punk grabs the bag schuyler grabs the guy's knife hand, they wrestle on the floor of the car, clawing at each other. the punk drops the knife, it gets knocked beneath the seat, both men reach for it...}

<D>__{freeze assholes!}
<A>__{schuyler and the punk look up to see a transit cop pointing his weapon. the punk throws his hands up, scrambles to his feet }
<C>__{punk}
<D>__{psycho pulled a knife on me!}
<A>__{the cop has grabbed the still prone schuyler, flipping him over and slapping a handcuff on him }
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{what do you think you're doing, this guy attacked me!}
<A>__{the cop has dropped his guard; the punk spins and bolts into the next car, squeezing through the door. the transit cop hastily cuffs schuyler to an armrest }
<C>__{transit cop}
<D>__{wait here }
<A>__{he dashes into the next car after the punk. schuyler looks at the floor of the car, sees the small radio and its earplug attached by a wire. the radio has a tiny loop rabbit ear antenna on it. he snatches it up, then yanks at the cuff. he spots the knife under the seat, grabs it, starts using the blade to unscrew the armrest from its post. from the next car he hears shouts, screams, a serious commotion going on, he doesn't know who's winning. schuyler's almost gotten free as the train slows, when the door at the far end of the car opens, it's the punk, bruised and bloody, ready to kill. he lunges at schuyler just as he pries the armrest off the seat and clobbers him with it. the punk reels back. the train has stopped, the doors have opened schuyler grabs his bag and squeezes out onto the platform just before they shut again.}
