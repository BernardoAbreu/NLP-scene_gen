<ACTION>__{preparing breakfast, laying the table for two. He is 51, dark- haired, saturnine. He is doing everything with deliberate quietness, taking the occasional glance towards the bedroom to check he's not making too much noise. He is boiling an egg, which he takes out of boiling water and puts on a sparkling clean plate. MICHAEL puts the yolk-stained egg-cup and plate into the sink, his breakfast eaten, then, as noiseless as he can, turns on the tap to run water. The bedroom door opens, and BRIGITTE comes out, naked. She's attractive, younger. The credits end.}

<ACTION>__{HANNA carries on ironing. He is becoming as comfortable with the silence as she is. She starts ironing a pair of knickers. He watches her bare arms moving back and forth.

She picks one up, rolls it, smooths it up over her calf and knee, then attaches it to her suspender. She reaches for the other. The flesh is bare between her legs. MICHAEL watches, riveted. HANNA seems oblivious. But as she is about to put the second stocking on, she looks at him. She drops her dress, and straightens, holding her stare. In response, he blushes, then panics and runs out of the flat. The door slams.}

<DIAL>__{It's all right, I won't look.}
<ACTION>__{On the contrary, she turns and walks straight towards him. MICHAEL is naked. HANNA takes his clothes from the chair. He gets into the bath. She goes to the balcony. In the bath, he submerges himself. HANNA goes out and shakes his clothes out in the open air. When he comes up from under the water, she is laying his clothes back on the chair. She picks up the shampoo and hands it to him.}
<CHAR>__{HANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Wash your hair, I'll get you a towel.}
<ACTION>__{MICHAEL washes his hair, then submerges again. When he comes back up, HANNA is holding out a large towel. He gets out, turning away to hide his erection. From behind, she wraps his body and rubs him dry. Then she lets the towel fall. She puts her body against his back, and he realises she's naked. He turns and faces her.}

<ACTION>__{At once she puts her arms round him and they kiss. MICHAEL goes down onto the floor, HANNA on top of him. All the time, she's staring into his eyes. He can't take it. He closes his eyes and, about to come, begins to scream. She puts her hand over his mouth to smother the noise.}
