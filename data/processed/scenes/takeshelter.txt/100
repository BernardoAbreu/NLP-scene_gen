<A>__{curtis sits at the breakfast table across from hannah. he looks over at samantha. she cooks, her back to him. hannah climbs out of her chair and goes to look out the back door. samantha turns and dishes eggs onto curtis' plate.}

<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{she touches his hand. curtis flinches. their eyes meet. he wants to take it back, and she can see that. it begins to sink in for her. hannah vocalizes something behind them. samantha looks at her husband, shakes her head in disbelief. hannah makes another sound, pounds on the back door. samantha turns and sees a man standing in their backyard. she flinches.}
