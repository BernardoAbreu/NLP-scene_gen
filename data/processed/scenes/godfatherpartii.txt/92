<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{vito climbs down from the attic, and finds fanucci's rear door open. he slips in, and makes his way past the open windows, out of which pour the music and chanting of the mass. slowly and quietly he pulls them down, shut. he moves quietly to a glass door, and peeks out.}
<T>__{what he sees:}
<A>__{three young women, fanucci's daughters, laughing and talking.}
<B>__{view on vito}
<A>__{a slip up. tessio had said they were out. he steps outside to the alley where he can look into the apartment.}
<B>__{another view}
<A>__{fanucci opens the door of his apartment, and enters.}
<B>__{close view on vito}
<A>__{he begins to wrap the gun.}
<B>__{view on the daughters}
<A>__{their father greets them with a kiss; and a little religious gift he has bought for each.}
<B>__{close on the gun}
<A>__{wrapped in this primitive method of a silencer. the view tilts to vito, caught in the dilemma of having to kill all or none of them. then something catches his eye.}
