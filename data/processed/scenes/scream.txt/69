<L>__{exterior country road night}
<A>__{dewey's jeep makes it's way down a long, winding road. headlights illuminate the thick woods that line each side. following behind them at a discreet distance is a huge white newsvan. dewey comes to the end of the road. it dead ends at... stu's house which sits alone in a clearing, big and ominous with no neighbors in sight. a huge old home just ripe for a night of fun and...terror. from the looks of things the party has already started. music is blaring. a few kids hang on the porch.}
