<L>__{exterior paradise gas `n' grub roof same}
<A>__{the tide is turning. the men seem to have gotten their game on and the dark shapes are starting to pull back.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{they're running! we got `em!}
<A>__{kyle turns happily to michael. gone. kyle looks around the roof with alarm.}
<L>__{interior paradise falls gas 'n' grub same}
<A>__{only a few more inches separate charlie and certain death through the window. jeep's losing her! a flash of steel. sching! charlie and jeep fall back into the diner, the claw like hands still grasping charlie's arm no longer attached to their owners. michael leaps over her, a butcher's knife in one hand, a machine gun in the other. he lights up everything in his path. the window blinds become a wall of fire. creatures screech and flee into the night, having successfully taken their first victim. charlie flings the severed appendages off her and she and jeep scoot away from the window. hysterical, sandra tries to push past michael. she's going after howard. he intercepts her before she can make it out.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{let me go! he's alive!}
<A>__{sandra slaps at him frantically as he carries her away from the window and thrusts her down into a back booth.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{he's alive!}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no... not anymore.}
<A>__{sandra breaks down. as charlie climbs slowly to her feet a sudden pain. she clutches her belly. winces. jeep catches her arm to steady her.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(recovering)}
<D>__{i'm okay. i'm fine.}
<A>__{she glances back at michael. he's watching her. those eyes.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{thanks...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i told you not to do anything brave.}
<A>__{charlie doesn't know how to respond. she's about to say something when kyle rushes into the room. a smile on his face.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{we got `em runnin'!}
<A>__{then kyle notices the broken window, takes in the room, his excitement falling.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{where's howard?}
<A>__{no one responds. sandra and audrey are huddled together. crying. bob and percy follow kyle in, still shaking from the adrenaline.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{someone needs to be on the roof.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{i will go.}
<A>__{bob grabs kyle's arm.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{hold on.}
<P>__{(approaches michael, determined)}
<D>__{you better start talking.}
<A>__{all eyes on michael. these people want answers. finally:}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{the first time god lost faith in man he sent a flood. the second time...he sent what you see outside.}
<A>__{everyone takes that in for a moment, then:}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{you sayin' this is the apocalypse...?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i'm saying this is an extermination.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{those things out there are vessels. the possessed. the weakest willed are the easiest to turn.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{possessed by what? demons?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no...by angels.}
<A>__{that silences the room.}
<C>__{percy}
<P>__{(pulls out his bible)}
<D>__{son, i don't know what bible you been readin', but in my version, the angels are the good guys.}
<A>__{michael looks squarely at percy.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{that's where your book is wrong.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{how come you know so much about them?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i know because until last night, i was on their side.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{you mean you're...}
<A>__{michael considers jeep, then:}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{not anymore...}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{right and yesterday i was the fuckin' easter bunny. you know, fuck this. i don't even believe in god.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{that's fine, because he doesn't believe in you either.}
<A>__{bob stares at michael, uncertain how to respond to that.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{c'mon, bob. have you looked outside recently? those aren't exactly our regular customers out there.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{how do we know he didn't bring them here himself?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{he brings them here and then he saves us from them? you're a genius, bob.}
<A>__{bob falls silent, confounded. audrey hesitantly approaches michael.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{so you're here to protect us?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{not you...}
<P>__{(looks at charlie)}
<D>__{her.}
<A>__{charlie reacts in shock, as all eyes are suddenly on her.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{me?! why me?!}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{because your child is the only hope humanity has of surviving.}
<A>__{in response to that, charlie does the only thing someone can do when told such a thing. she laughs.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no way!}
<A>__{but michael isn't joking and charlie's laughter becomes genuine fear.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{jesus christ...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{exactly.}
<A>__{jeep stares at charlie, as if suddenly his entire life is starting to make sense.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{you're sayin' she's the mother of the messiah?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{wait a minute, isn't mary supposed to be a vi }
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{go fuck yourself, bob!}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{makes you wonder about mary.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(approaches michael, panic setting in)}
<D>__{look, this is not possible! i'm just a waitress! i'm nobody! i can't give birth to the savior of mankind!}
<P>__{(and finally)}
<D>__{i don't even own a car!}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{none of that matters anymore. either your child lives or mankind dies.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{so what, we're supposed to just hold those things off until mary over there squeezes one out?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{that can't be. i'm only eight months pregnant.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{oh we're fucked. we are so fucked!}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{how are we supposed to survive here for a month?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{we won't have to...}
<A>__{at this charlie goes white, the realization hitting her.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's coming soon, isn't it?}
<A>__{michael nods. charlie sways on her feet. jeep rests a hand on her shoulder, steadying her. with a clank michael re arms his weapon, turns to the group with finality.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{if you want to live you'll do what i say. this first attack was a test of our strength. the next one will be a test of our weakness.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{something much worse is on its way.}
<A>__{everyone exchanges terrified looks. finally, kyle steps forward.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{okay, what's your plan?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{we'll keep watch on the roof in shifts of two. jeep, go get some tools. we need to close up this window before somebody else goes out.}
<A>__{jeep looks anxiously at charlie, silent, scared, and then he follows after michael, leaving charlie to stare at the shattered window, the blinds flipping wildly in the wind.}
