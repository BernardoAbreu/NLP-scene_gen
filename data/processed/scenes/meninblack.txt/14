<L>__{interior interrogation room later night}
<A>__{a woman sneaks into the room. doctor laurel weaver, thirtyish, dark haired, dark eyed, general aura of darkness around her, stands above him. laurel looks like she was just dragged out of bed (which she was) and saw a spaceman (which she did). she looks over her shoulder once, then whispers to him.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{laurel weaver. deputy medical examiner. i believe you. i opened him up. find me at the morgue. on 26th. i will tell you what i found.}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{hey...wait a minute. wait a minute.}
<C>__{laurel}
<P>__{(turning at the door)}
<D>__{you have really pretty eyes.}
<A>__{she hurries to turn the corner, but is stopped by someone who remains just offscreen.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{dr. weaver, from the coroner's office? working on the john doe?}
<A>__{edwards twists in his chair, to get a better look. all he sees is laurel, facing whoever it is in the hallway.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{yes. that's right.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{would you look right here, please.}
<A>__{the someone says something else and laurel steps forward, now also out of edwards's line of vision.}
<C>__{laurel }
<D>__{look where?}
<A>__{edwards stretches even further in his seat, when there is a blinding flash from the corridor. really curious now, he starts to get up when kay steps into the room and closes the door behind him. edwards rolls his eyes.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{some night, huh?}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{oh, yeah, some night.}
<A>__{he crosses to the door.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{they were gills.}
<A>__{edwards stops.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{not eyelids.}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{did he say anything to you?}
<C>__{edwards}
<P>__{(scoffing)}
<D>__{yeah, sure. he said the world was coming to an end.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{did he say when?}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{you're kidding, right?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{would you recognize his weapon if you saw it again?}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{let's take a ride.}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{wait a minute. i got a ton of paperwork.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{it's all done.}
<A>__{at that point, the inspector sticks his head in, smiles and gives edwards the thumbs up.}
<C>__{inspector}
<D>__{good work, edwards.}
<A>__{edwards looks at the inspector, then at kay. as they leave.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{you ran that guy down on foot? that's tough. that's double tough.}
