<L>__{interior cullen courtroom day}
<A>__{packed. judge armand poe presiding. cullen seated with kevin and pam. the jury in their box. and prosecutor frank broygo on his feet, just wrapping up his opening statement }
<C>__{broygo}
<D>__{... and when all that evidence is laid before you, when all these pieces weave together, you will conclude you will know that alexander cullen is guilty of murdering three people in cold blood with malice aforethought.}
<A>__{done. the courtroom is silent. the jury liked him.}
<C>__{judge poe}
<D>__{mr. lomax...}
<P>__{(checking his watch)}
<D>__{we can break for lunch now, or you can do a stop and start...}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{if it's a choice, i will go now. i won't be as long as mr. broygo.}
<C>__{judge poe}
<D>__{proceed.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{we just spent our morning listening to mr. broygo talk about his 'evidence'. what he neglected to tell you is what this case is really about. he left out the most important fact of all: alex cullen was somewhere else when these murders took place. now, alex cullen has done a lot of things i don't like. he's been a terrible husband to all three of his wives. he's been a destructive force in the lives of his step children. he's cheated the city. his partners. his employees. he's paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in penalties and fines over the years. i don't like those things. i don't expect you to like them. there will be other things during the course of this trial that you will hear about and like even less. but this isn't a popularity contest. it's a murder trial and alex cullen hasn't killed anybody.}
<C>__{kevin }
<D>__{the state is going all out here. they've got a whole team over there. they're throwing everything but the kitchen sink at this case. i need one thing from you. that's it. one thing. i need you to ask yourself, 'is not liking this man reason enough to convict him of murder?'}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{enjoy your lunch. we'll talk again.}
<A>__{stunned silence, and then }
