<A>__{consisting of a handful of sod roof cabins, mostly bars, chukfoktulik is a way station in the coniferous forest, sixty miles southeast of devil's cauldron.}
<L>__{interior trappers' jeep}
<A>__{with the seats pushed back, lemalle peels the town's lone whore out of her parka. he's got the motor running for warmth. her gold tooth glints in the light from the building next to them. the locating screen on the beat up radio beacon receiver bolted to the dash glows phosphorescent green.}
<C>__{whore}
<D>__{they got nice beds upstairs, honey.}
<C>__{lemalle}
<D>__{i'm standin' guard duty. besides, rather spend the room money on sloppy seconds.}
<A>__{over the sound of lemalle's exertions there begins an insistent succession of beeps. the whore looks over lemalle's shoulder at the locating device.}
<C>__{whore}
<D>__{hey, tiger }
<A>__{lemalle turns and immediately loses interest in the whore. pushing her off of him, he blows the jeep's horn three times.}
