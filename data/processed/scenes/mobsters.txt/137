<T>__{cut to black:}
<B>__{and we hear}
<A>__{the blat! blat! blat! of machine gun fire shattering glass. tires squeal. bystanders scream and stampede. a basso voice howls, then gurgles as life drains out. a man struggles against an onslaught of long knives, furniture crashing, steel tearing flesh. a room explodes. sirens wail. a dozen police radios crackle with urgent calls. a hundred keening widows screech their lamentations as a hundred shovels break the earth. a sicilian brass band bleats a funeral march.}
