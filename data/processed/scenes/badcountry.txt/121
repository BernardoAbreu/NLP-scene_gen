<A>__{off a deserted street. a dense fog resides, far as the eye can see. and jesse, in a phone booth, drops a dime and dials...}
<C>__{lynn v.o.}
<P>__{(clearly asleep)}
<D>__{hello...}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{it's me.}
<C>__{lynn v.o.}

<P>__{(off jesse's silence)}
<D>__{honey, you alright?}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{i'm okay. just need to hear your voice. how's little ray...?}
<C>__{lynn v.o.}
<D>__{i will put him on.}
<A>__{silence for a moment...then a quiet baby's voice.}
<C>__{lynn v.o.}
<D>__{it's daddy on the phone, say hello.}
<A>__{emotion rises to jesse's face. he holds it in, barely. angle: down the street a lone car is parked in the shadows, fog rolling past... ...jesse sees it, can't see who's inside it.}
<C>__{lynn v.o.}
<D>__{jesse?}
<A>__{he hangs up. a long moment... jesse stands there, watching the car... he slowly makes his way toward the back of the store, where his truck is parked. pulse pounding, he tries the door...it's locked. eyeing the car, he unlocks his truck. there's sudden movement. jesse spins. and out of the darkness steps bud ready to pounce...}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{where the hell you been?}
<P>__{(jesse's look)}
<D>__{two days missin', you broke protocol. three, and you're a flight risk. agents'll hunt your ass down.}
<C>__{jesse}
<P>__{(anger spiking, pacing)}
<D>__{i can't keep doin' this. i can't fuckin' breathe. even the shadows got eyes.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{this is the job. if i don't hear from you, i can't protect you.}
<C>__{jesse}
<P>__{(in his face)}
<D>__{protect me?! i about got my head fuckin' shot off, 'cause your guys was "protecting" me!}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{those ain't my guys!}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{i don't give a fuck i don't want your protection! i want out!}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{there is no "out." not for either of us. not till it's done...}
<P>__{(low, definitive)}
<D>__{get me that list.}
<A>__{jesse stares a malevolence in his eyes that freezes bud to the spot. then, jesse climbs in his truck and drives off.}
