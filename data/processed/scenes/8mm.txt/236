<L>__{exterior big bear motor lodge night}
<A>__{eddie and welles come around the corner of the abandoned motel, eddie leading the way, welles following with gun and flashlight, into the dense forest...}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{what are you thinking you're gonna do... ?}
<A>__{welles shoves eddie ahead.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{keep moving.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{where do you think you're taking this, huh? gonna be a big hero, avenge that little girl's death? gonna make everything right with the world? how you gonna do that... ?}
<B>__{further on}
<A>__{welles and eddie come over a hill, deeper into the forest...}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you can't go to the cops. all you can do is cut me loose and walk away, because you got nothing...}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{stop talking.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you got absolute zero.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{show me where you buried her.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i don't know...}
<P>__{(nods to forest)}
<D>__{... out there somewhere.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{where? show me where.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i fucking don't know. what do you think... we weren't burying treasure. we didn't pace it out so we could come back and get it. we dug a hole and we put her in it. your guess is as good as mine.}
<A>__{welles walks ahead of eddie, distraught, shining his flashlight ahead across the indecipherable forest floor.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you'll never find her. nobody ever will, and even if they did, it doesn't mean nothing. bring in the cops, bring in the f.b.i., fuck 'em all. without the film, it never happened. don't you get it? it's over. you can't do anything.}
<A>__{welles turns, aims his gun at eddie, furious.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i can kill you. i can leave you out here, just like you left her.}
<A>__{eddie's not backing down.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{do it.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{don't think i won't.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{do it! put me out of my misery so i don't have to listen to you whining anymore. you think it's so easy?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{easy enough for you.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i never killed anyone.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{that's right, you just stood there and watched, because you "felt like it." almost makes you worse.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{what do you want? you want me to fall to my knees and start crying like a baby... ?}
<A>__{eddie walks towards welles. welles backs away...}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{where you going? you're the one with the gun. aren't i defenseless enough? come on...}
<A>__{eddie comes ahead, defiant, the gun inches from his face.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{go ahead and kill me. kill me with that gun, your gun, right, registered in your name? dig the hole yourself, with your bare hands, bury the body with your bullets in it. fucking do it!}
<A>__{welles step forward, presses the gun against eddie's forehead, pulls back the hammer... eddie just stares back at welles with hatred in his eyes. welles is terrified, unsure... trying to muster the courage to do it... gun hand trembling... finger on the trigger...}
