<L>__{exterior construction site night (part old sc 55b)}
<A>__{ivan and goldar patrol the parents who are busy digging.}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{let's pick it up here! i've got a schedule to keep. in twenty four hours the ooze is gonna hit the fan!}
<A>__{goldar suddenly point to the sky.}
<C>__{goldar}
<D>__{hey, boss!}
<A>__{the tengu drops into the scene, squealing}
<C>__{mordant}
<D>__{what kind of landing was that?! these clowns are a menace to the sky}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{how did you fare?}
<A>__{mordant waves ivan off.}
<C>__{mordant}
<D>__{oh, it couldn't've gone better. the power rangers didn't know what hit them .}
<A>__{the tengu appear, one of them squawks and makes grand gestures.}
<C>__{mordant}
<D>__{that's right. and then we threw one of them off a mountain and another one into a raqing river!}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{so they've been destroyed?}
<A>__{the tengu squawks some more.}
<C>__{mordant}
<D>__{"basically".}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{what do you mean "basically"?}
<C>__{mordant}
<D>__{well... we were about to finish them off... when this huge monster came out of nowhere!}
<C>__{mordant}
<D>__{okay, maybe he wasn't so huge. but you should've seen the size of his sticks}
<A>__{a pensive look comes over ivan...}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{did these sticks make a whistling sound?}
<C>__{mordant}
<D>__{how'd you know?}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{dulcea!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that miserable, manipulating loathsome she devil of a witch!!}
<A>__{to help make the point mordant spits on the ground.}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{how could you let them get away?! if dulcea leads them to the great power, everything will be ruined! they must be obliterated!}
<A>__{one of the tengu screeches again.}
<C>__{mordant}
<D>__{what're you talking about?! it wasn't my fault! you're the featherbrains that let them get away!}
<A>__{ivan looks up to the sky.}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{i call upon the powers of darkness to enrich the evil of my creatures by tenfold!}
<A>__{lightning rips from the sky and zaps the tengu, causing them to}
<B>__{glow radiantly.}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{and now the coup de grace, to lead my tribe to victorious battle!}
<A>__{he shoots a bolt of energy and creates the oueen tengu! she is a different color than the rest and her eyes glow red. mordant shakes his head in wonder.}
<C>__{mordant}
<D>__{where does he come up with this stuff?}
<A>__{the queen spreads her wings and makes the most horrendous screech imaginable.}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{queen tengu, lead your warriors to phaedos, feast yourselves upon the power rangers and bring me dulcea!}
<A>__{once again, the tengu take to the sky like giant bats.}
