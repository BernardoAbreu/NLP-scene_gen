<L>__{interior bungalow "84" morning}
<A>__{trevor flicks on the lights, exposing bare, colorless walls and closed venetian blinds. his breathing's slightly labored as he sets down his briefcase. his back faces the mob of students that trickle in now as he takes a surreptitious hit off an inhaler. almost instantly his breathing returns to normal. now he shuts his eyes and prepares to conjure up the dormant enthusiasm he used to have. takes a deep cathartic breath. now he digs a file folder out of his briefcase, opens it, selects a dispatch and approaches the blackboard. bell rings as he picks up a piece of chalk... and begins. first he writes his name in the corner of the blackboard. now he moves to the center of the blackboard and begins to write per the file folder in his hand... "glis was very frapper. she had denarpen farfie's mardsen..." no one pays much attention. back still facing the class...}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{... before taking roll, i'd like to prove a pointerior}
<A>__{now one or two students begin to notice the indecipherable gibberish he is writing on the board...}
<C>__{barsek}
<P>__{(armenian; a disparaging laugh)}
<D>__{'farfie?'}
<P>__{(cholo like)}
<D>__{whad up, farfie?}
<A>__{trevor mentally blocks out the salvo of grunts, groans and expletives. with each subsequent stroke of the chalk he is exorcising his demons...}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{... it's not important what... or who... 'farfie' is.}
<A>__{turning to face the class now...}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{yuh wanna play, yuh gotta stay. have a seat, please.}
<A>__{a handful of students take their seats.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(pacing now)}
<D>__{the point i'd like to make is this... anyone here can be a scientist.}
<A>__{... a grudging buzz of confusion.}
<C>__{asian girl}
<P>__{(sotto; puzzled)}
<D>__{... what's he talking about?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{... a scientist is like a detective. he investigates data. he scratches the surface of things he doesn't understand to see what's underneath.}
<P>__{(pointing to blackboard)}
<D>__{... things like this. okay, who wants to read?}
<A>__{barsek (the class clown) breaks in...}
<C>__{barsek}
<P>__{(standing up)}
<D>__{i will do it.}
<A>__{trevor quiets a harmless barrage of, "bart," "sit down" and "armenian power sucks"...}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{come on, we don't need disrespect. let 'im do it.}
<P>__{(to barsek)}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{barsek}
<D>__{barsek.}
<A>__{a wisp of gratification flickers at the corner of trevor's mouth.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{okay, barsek. read.}
<A>__{(the following is read in fits and starts and accompanied by diminishing laughter and ridicule.)}
<C>__{barsek}
<D>__{... glis was very frapper. she had denarpen farfie's mardsen. she couldn't galp a giberter for farfie. instead she wharked to plimp a mardsen binky for him.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{okay, anyone know what barsek just said?}
<A>__{... a unanimous "no." trevor can see the light at the end of the tunnel now. he's back in the zone.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{that's alright. you don't need to understand something to answer a few simple questions about it. every one of you is capable of decoding data. watch.}
<A>__{trevor writes question #1 on the board...}
<D>__{1. why was glis frapper?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{... why was glis frapper? can anyone tell me?}
<A>__{the asian girl, into it now, tentatively raises her hand.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(pointing at asian girl)}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{asian girl's pov as she studies the first two sentences on the board.}
<C>__{asian girl}
<P>__{(slowly; cautiously)}
<D>__{... glis was frapper... because... she had denarpen farfie's mardsen?}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(understated)}
<D>__{that's right. you got it.}
<P>__{(reactions all around)}
<D>__{let's try another.}
<A>__{trevor reads and writes question #2 on the board...}
<D>__{2. what did glis plimp?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{... what did glis plimp?}
<A>__{before trevor can finish writing the question, an unidentified voice blurts out, "he plimped a ho." scattered laughter. trevor grimaces, shakes his head. now attempts to add the question mark at the end of the sentence but the chalk breaks, causing dissension.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(searching blackboard ledge)}
<D>__{... hold on, hold on. where's your teacher keep the chalk?}
<C>__{asian girl}
<D>__{... in the desk.}
<A>__{trevor hastily rifles through the teacher's drawers. a startling discovery abruptly halts his search... closer now into a brown paper bag trevor has opened. inside the bag is a .357 magnum. off trevor's narrowing gaze, an offstage voice interrupts...}
<C>__{childress }
<D>__{... can i help you?}
<A>__{trevor lifts his head to see dave childress standing in the doorway of the bungalow. trevor shuts the desk drawer. you can hear a pin drop. childress piston chews a wad of gum as he approaches trevor.}
<C>__{childress}
<D>__{sorry i'm late. had to handle something. you a sub?}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{i thought this was science. ms. eskander.}
<A>__{childress weighs a shit eating grin as he glances at trevor's name on the board.}
<C>__{childress}
<D>__{no. this is dave childress, american history.}
<A>__{some students brave a laugh at trevor's expense.}
<C>__{childress}
<D>__{... don't know how to break it to you...}
<P>__{(glancing at trevor's name again)}
<D>__{... garfield... but this is bungalow 84.}
<A>__{childress now places a patronizing hand on trevor's shoulder and steers him toward the window blinds.}
<C>__{childress}
<D>__{see, you zigged when you shoulda zagged. course it's not your fault someone jacked the number off my door. keep askin' garcia to fix it but all i get is 'nada.'}
<A>__{childress draws the blinds on one of the windows exposing another bungalow across the way.}
