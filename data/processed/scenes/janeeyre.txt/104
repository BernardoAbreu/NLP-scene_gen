<L>__{interior day. a haberdasher's shop.}
<A>__{rochester is rolling out reams of beautiful silks. jane gets more uncomfortable as she looks at them.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{this morning i wrote to my banker in london to send certain jewels. in a day or two i hope to pour them into you lap }
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{oh, no sir }
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{i will put the diamond chain around your neck myself }
<C>__{jane}

<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{i will dress you in these satins }
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{then you won't know me. i will not be jane eyre any longer but an ape in a harlequin's jacket. put them away.}
<A>__{jane pushes the silks away.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{well for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, you haven't your equal.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i'm naturally proud. and hard and flinty. you ought to know what sort of bargain you've made while you've still got time to rescind it. i want only one thing from you, mr rochester.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{and what's that?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{your regard.}
<A>__{jane puts her arm through rochester's. he smiles.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{it's your time now, little tyrant but it'll soon be mine and when i have seized you, to have and to hold, i will attach you to a chain, like this...}
<A>__{rochester flicks his watch into the air.}
