<L>__{exterior drago's ship deck moments later}
<A>__{drago bludvist, a hulking figure draped in a dragon skin cloak, crouches over the prow of the fleet's grisly flagship, adorned in massive dragon bones and skulls. his scarred face is masked by thick, grizzled dreadlocks.}
<C>__{eret }
<D>__{drago!}
<A>__{drago turns to see astrid, eret, and the gang being forcibly escorted onto the deck. eret shakes himself free.}
<C>__{eret }
<D>__{get off me!}
<A>__{in the background, a sledge, loaded with hookfang, meatlug, belch and barf all unconscious is dragged onto the deck by armored dragons.}
<C>__{eret }
<D>__{always great to see you, my friend! keeping warm up here?}
<A>__{the soldiers disarm him, pushing him forward as drago approaches.}
<C>__{eret }
<D>__{well, as you can see, i'm right on time with a new batch of dragons, just like i promised.}
<A>__{hookfang awakens, groggily shaking off the effect of the blow dart. he rears as soldiers struggle to reign him in.}
<D>__{soldier #1 watch out! he's waking up! keep him steady! soldier #2 give me some backup here!}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{drop the ropes.}
<A>__{they do so. hookfang bucks and roars, chasing off the soldiers, then focusing on drago as he closes in. the armored dragons avert their eyes and cower as drago passes. hookfang hisses a warning, but drago approaches, undaunted. hookfang blasts. in a blur, drago wraps himself in his dragon skin cloak. the sticky, napalm like fire splatters against the fireproof scales, enveloping drago in dripping flames as he persists forward without missing a step. as the blast ends, drago drops the cloak, closing in and holding a cold stare. hookfang lets out a ferocious roar. drago yells back with a fierce, savage scream, interrupting hookfang and causing him to recoil. drago whirls his bull hook overhead and stabs it into the deck planks. hookfang stirs, his aggression fading in the face of drago's unflinching show of dominance. after a moment, hookfang averts his eyes and lowers his head in submission. drago places his boot upon hookfang's snout, pressing it into the deck planks.}
<C>__{snotlout}
<D>__{hookfang!}
<C>__{ruffnut}
<D>__{hey!}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{drago}
<P>__{(quiet, to the dragon)}
<D>__{you belong to me now.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{and as an added bonus, i also caught you their riders. no extra charge.}
<A>__{drago notices the saddle on hookfang's back. his eyes wander to the saddle on meatlug. alarm flashes in drago's eyes.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{what?! are you kidding me?!}
<C>__{ruffnut}
<D>__{but you were so perfect!}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{turns out, there's a whole bunch of them out there. they }
<A>__{in a flash, drago stops toward eret and seizes him by the throat.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{how many?}
<A>__{as eret chokes, stammering, astrid whispers to the gang.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{drago doesn't have them after all.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{how many?!}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{hundreds! a whole island full!}
<A>__{his grip tightens around eret's neck as he turns to astrid.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{i wouldn't worry about it. my men are hunting them down as we speak. they won't know where you're hiding. i promise you that.}
<A>__{astrid nods a covert signal to the gang she has a plan.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{oh, yes they will!}
<A>__{drago drops eret as astrid advances, staring drago down. eret tries to signal her to stop, but it's no use.}
<C>__{astrid }
<D>__{they know we're missing and they have tracking dragons. if you so much as touch us, hiccup is gonna kick }
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{ hiccup?}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{he's not a problem. really. trust me.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{he's only the son of stoick the vast...}
<A>__{drago's eyes narrow upon hearing stoick's name.}
<C>__{astrid }
<D>__{... his heir to the throne of berk... and the greatest dragon master this world has ever seen!}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{dragon master? i alone control the dragons!}
<C>__{tuffnut}
<D>__{nope.}
<C>__{fishlegs}
<D>__{sorry!}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{and unless you let us go, right now, he will blast through here on his night fury and blow your entire fleet of ships to splinters!}
<A>__{eret slips away, trying to distance himself from the tension.}
<C>__{ruffnut}
<D>__{then they'll be crying like babies!}
<C>__{snotlout}
<D>__{funny and beautiful.}
<C>__{fishlegs}
<D>__{good one, babe!}
<A>__{ruffnut groans, exasperated by their smarmy advances.}
<C>__{tuffnut}
<D>__{yeah. like babies. they always cry. real tiny ones...}
<A>__{drago grabs eret by the face and bears down on him.}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{first there was one rider. and now all of berk.}
<P>__{(to eret)}
<D>__{and you led them to me.}
<A>__{he throws eret across the deck.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{drago!}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{cease all preparations! we must attack the dragons rider's nest at once!}
<P>__{(savoring it)}
<D>__{we will take down their alpha... and then we will take berk!}
<A>__{soldiers cheer in the thousands.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{you're overreacting!}
<C>__{drago}
<D>__{and get rid of him.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{drago, please...}
<A>__{the soldiers hurl throwing knives at eret... but stormfly lands in a blur of wings, shielding eret from the flurry of blades. she whips her tail, throwing spikes in all directions.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{stormfly!}
<A>__{stormfly roars protectively, hiding eret within her wings, until a well blown dart sinks into her neck, bringing her down...}
<C>__{astrid }
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{revealing eret, gawking in shock.}
