<L>__{interior slate's office day}
<A>__{slate and lava are examining a newer and larger model of slate city. it's even more grandiose than its predecessor. now the housing development has two huge office buildings beside it, and then a convention center beyond that.}
<C>__{lava}
<D>__{... as you can see, the fibrerock is so light we're using it for construction, for furnishings... for everything. you can't stack a two bedroom cave this high... but the sky's the limit with fibrerock!}
<C>__{slate}
<D>__{'sky's the limit'... 'sky's the limit'... why, these two buildings, they... they practically scrape the sky! we should call them... slate scrapers!}
<C>__{lava}
<D>__{that's brilliant, unc... mister slate. in fact, maybe you can help me with the centerpiece of the complex...}
<P>__{(indicating the convention center)}
<D>__{... i wanna call 'em the fibresphere and the ' ' something needle... but i just can't...}
<C>__{slate}
<P>__{(modestly)}
<D>__{how about, 'slate needle'?}
<C>__{lava}
<D>__{'slate need...'}
<P>__{(astonished)}
<D>__{... how do you keep coming up with these? it's uncanny.}
<C>__{slate}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{it's a gift...}
<C>__{lava}
<P>__{(casually)}
<D>__{oh, that reminds me, sign these, will you... just a few overruns ... minor cost problems... that's it... thank you...}
<A>__{slate's so busy admiring his moment to himself he hardly listens to what lava's saying, just runs his stylus through the wet clay of the statements, meanwhile "framing" the model city in his hands.}
<C>__{lava}
<P>__{(heading for the door)}
<D>__{... oh, mister slate, we're going to hold the bedrock junior talent show in the uh, 'slate needle.' good for public relations }
<A>__{lava breaks off. he's just looked out the window and seen lava's pov quarry below window a small figure appears behind some of the equipment, tiptoeing from console to cabinet and thus towards the assembly line. wearing sunglasses with attached nose and a hook on beard, it at first appears to be some sort of bizarre hermit or bum... and then we realize, hey, this is barney!}
<B>__{lava}
<A>__{looks around, spots piltdown and pyrite, now resplendent in security guard uniforms. lava whistles softly to get their attention, can't. then he sees one of slate's golf trophies. he shrugs, throws it. below piltdown reacts as the trophy bounces off his head, then looks up to see lava gesticulating. piltdown nods, grabs pyrite in tow.}
<B>__{barney}
<A>__{looking around carefully, barney takes out a thermos bottle, unscrews the top, and quickly dunks it into the fibrerock foam. then he tiptoes o.s., right into the massive bulk of }
<B>__{piltdown}
<A>__{ who looks down at him with a big smile, pyrite at his side.}
<C>__{piltdown}
<D>__{can we help you... sir?}
<C>__{barney}
<P>__{(fake crotchety voice)}
<D>__{ah, yup, yup, young feller... jest show me the way to the personnel office... i'm lookin' fer a job as a custodian...}
<C>__{pyrite}
<D>__{our pleasure.}
<A>__{then they grab barney with such force that the thermos drops and shatters, drag him o.s. slate quarry main gate day barney is tossed outside, landing in a heap amidst the picketing workers of neolithic 101.}
<C>__{piltdown}
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<D>__{ya can start by cleaning the street with your pants!}
<A>__{still laughing, piltdown and pyrite cross over to lava, who has come out of the office building.}
<C>__{lava}
<D>__{that takes care of the half pinterior}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{now to deal with the half wit.}
