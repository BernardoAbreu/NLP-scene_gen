<A>__{a boy, a hyena, a zebra and an orangutan silhouetted against the last fading light of day. pi has hung the paddle and lifebuoy off the end of the boat and perches on the bow. the hyena's eyes seem to glow in the last light, fixed on pi. pi stares back. pi fights fatigue as waves splash interminably against the hull. he winces at each creak of the lifeboat; his eyes glaze over as he stares out at the endless, dusky seascape. pi sees movement in the shadows. the hyena attacks the zebra; the zebra barks and squeals. o.j. reacts to the violence, crying out.}
