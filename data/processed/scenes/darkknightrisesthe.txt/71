<A>__{wayne pushes a button on a hi tech carbon fiber brace strapped to his good knee the brace tones. as wayne starts moving his knee, bending, stretching, alfred puts down a thermos.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{you've got the wrong leg, sir.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{you start with the good limb so it learns your optimum muscle patterns.}
<A>__{wayne swaps the brace to his bad knee. puts his weight on it the knee bends, kicks. he sits again. cautious.}
<D>__{now we tighten it up.}
<A>__{wayne gingerly pushes a button the brace starts to shrink tight to his leg, digging in. wayne grits his teeth.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{it is terribly painful?}
<C>__{wayne}
<P>__{(gritted teeth)}
<D>__{you're welcome to try it, alfred.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{happy watching, thank you, sir.}
<A>__{wayne shouts as the brace clicks home. he gets to his feet.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{not bad }
<A>__{wayne executes a perfect roundhouse, knocking out a brick.}
<D>__{not bad at all.}
<A>__{alfred picks up the brick. considers it. uneasy. he follows wayne across the bridge to the cube.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{master wayne, if you're considering going back out there you need to hear some rumors surrounding bane.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{i'm all ears.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{there is a prison. in a more ancient part of the world. a pit. where men are thrown to suffer and die. but sometimes, a man rises from the darkness. sometimes...the pit sends something back.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{bane.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{born and raised in a hell on earth.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{born in a prison?}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{no one knows why. or how he escaped. but they know who trained him one he did...ra's al ghul. your mentor.}
<A>__{wayne takes this in. shocked.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{he plucked bane from a dark corner of the earth and trained him in the blackest disciplines of combat, deception and endurance. just like you.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{bane was a member of the league of shadows.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{until he was excommunicated. and a man considered too extreme for ra's al ghul is not to be trifled with.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{i didn't realize i was known for trifling with criminals.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{that was then. and you can strap up your leg and put the mask back on. but it won't make you what you were.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{which was?}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{someone whose anger at death made him value all life. even his own.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{if this man is all the things you say he is, then this city needs me.}
<A>__{the batsuit emerges from the cube.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{yes, this city needs bruce wayne. your resources, your knowledge...not your body. not your life. that time has passed.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{i tried helping as bruce wayne, alfred. and i failed.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{you can fail as bruce wayne. as batman, you can't afford to.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{that's what you're afraid of that if i go back out there i will fail.}
<C>__{alfred}
<D>__{no. i'm afraid that you want to.}
<A>__{wayne looks at alfred. then turns to examine the batsuit.}
