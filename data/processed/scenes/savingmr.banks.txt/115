<A>__{he clambers onto his own horse, gestures to the ride controller and off they go! pamela gently bobs up and down, walt waves to her and she sees the unbridled thrill from the child in mister disney spilling out. the tiniest, tiniest of smiles threatens to surface on her lips as he points a finger in the air as if shooting for the stars.}
