<L>__{exterior house night}
<A>__{we are looking through the living room window at jenny watching television while she irons the clothes she plans to wear to work tomorrow. the star man stands just outside the light fall in the back yard watching her. a commercial interrupts the old movie with a jolly fat man in a jumpsuit touting his used cars. the two words 'we have...' are repeated constantly during the pitch. 'we have automatics... we have sticks... we have colors... we have financing...' ... we move in close on the star man's faceplate.}

<D>__{wehave...}
<A>__{jenny finishes the skirt, unplugs the iron, picks up the clothes, shuts off the television, the light and heads upstairs. half way up she stops.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(faint through the glass)}
<D>__{damn!}
<A>__{she turns around and looks down indecisively, then hurries upstairs. a light goes on in the bedroom. the star man backs away to look up at it. he can't see anything. he is on his way to try and get in the side door when jenny comes clumping down the stairs in an old sweatshirt and pulling on a pair of jeans. she disappears into the kitchen. without warning the door ahead of him is swung open and jenny rushes out. the star man barely has time to step into the shadows. jenny grabs the handle of one of the garbage cans lined against the house and drags it down to the street. when she comes back for the second one we see that the star man is no longer in the shadows.}
