<A>__{digging with their shovels. their training clothes are already sweated through and dirty. their shirts are off, and their arm muscles are bulging and shining in the hot sunshine.}
<B>__{angle on drew}
<A>__{as he lifts up two heavy buckets of dirt on a pole, then places the pole on his shoulders, the muscles in his arms, shoulders and back straining. he walks off to the side of the area to dump it. as he dumps the dirt, a pole appears and cracks across his back. he drops the buckets and falls to the ground. he gets up as quickly as he can, but there is no one to be seen.}

<B>__{angle on drew and disciples as they eat their lunch}
<A>__{it is again very meager: a bowl of rice, a bowl of soup and a piece of scrawny meat. drew looks at it for a moment. the d.s. is standing over his shoulder.}

<A>__{drew shakes his head and starts to eat, quickly.}
<B>__{angle on drew}
<A>__{as he loads up a two baskets of dirt onto his pole. he gets it up onto his shoulders, in pain, and starts to walk. immediately, the d.s. is there in front of him. he examines the baskets. they are not full. he moves quickly and dumps both baskets of dirt.}

<C>__{d.s.}
<D>__{sorry, all gone. get some more.}
<A>__{drew stares at all the water spilled onto the ground, then looks up at the d.s., then forces a smile. he takes the proferred buckets of water (made of wood, with pointed bottoms and large handles). the d.s. indicates that they are to be held straight out to the sides, to work on the shoulder muscles. drew turns and walks away, muttering to himself.}
