<A>__{joey enters the darkened room and then stops a few feet from the door. terri lit only by the moonlight through the blinds is lying on one side of joey's bed fast asleep. apart from her shoes, which she has kicked off, she is fully dressed. joey approaches the bed and watches her sleeping friend, her face sympathetic, affectionate, and troubled. joey reaches over, takes one of the pillows from the other side of the bed, and lays it at the bottom end. she slips off her shoes, shrugs off her jacket, and delicately, carefully climbs on to the other side of the bed, laying her head on the pillow she had moved.}
