<A>__{elena bursts up to the surface of the bloody water, gasps for breath. looking down she sees chad, holding on to her like his life depends on it. it does... he pulls her back down into the water, just as she catches a glance of the circling gators... using her as leverage, chad pulls himself out of the swamp, climbing over her writhing body to the relative safety of solid ground... elena coughs and splutters, floundering in the blood soaked water. the ravenous gators approach, sensing a feeding frenzy...}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{don't move! don't splash, they can sense you in the water, they'll rip you to pieces...}
<A>__{elena freezes, looking round at the black eyes breaking the surface of the bloody water, gliding in for the kill...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{hel..help me...}
<A>__{she reaches out a hand to chad, only a few feet away... he hesitates, then reaches out to her. but stops short of grabbing her trembling hand. just balls his fist, squeezing every last drop of blood out of the open wounds on his palm... the dark blood cascades down into the water around elena...}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{and he smiles as the gators ease open their powerful jaws... whack! chad's eyes roll back into his head as blood flows from his nose, ears and mouth. he falls forward, stiff as a board, and splashes down into the water next to an apoplectic elena. behind him stands marie, the bloody tire iron in hand... marie reaches out a hand, pulls elena out of the water. she collapses onto her back and sucks in the stagnant swamp air...}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{what are you doing? our diamonds are about to become dinner...}
<A>__{elena can't move, leaving marie to wade into the swamp...}
