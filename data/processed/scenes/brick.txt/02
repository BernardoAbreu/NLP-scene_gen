<A>__{with a sharp breath the line clicks dead just as a black mustang roars by. brendan drops the receiver and spins out of the booth. there, another pay phone up the hill empty. brendan turns to the black mustang, far down the street. a man's hand drops a cigarette butt from the driver side window.1 the mustang turns the corner, gone. brendan walks after it, finds the cigarette butt on the street. still smoking. a pale blue arrow is printed on the filter. in the distance the class bell rings.}
