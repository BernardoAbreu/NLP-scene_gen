<L>__{exterior factory alley across the street day}
<A>__{where he barfs his guts out in private. doubled over, one arm on the brick wall for support, we see the raw terror. the demons rushing out of him.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{shit...}
<A>__{someone else does too. jennifer. dressed now in a long expensive coat, she's standing at the end of the alley with a clipboard. brian, ashes smeared across an ashen face, spittle on his chin, doesn't notice her.}
<C>__{stephen}
<P>__{(appearing beside him)}
<D>__{you all right?}
<A>__{stephen isn't pale. he's flushed and buoyant. all this hasn't taken anything from him. it's made his day.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{yeah. fine. i'm a little busy right now.}
<A>__{stephen leans against the wall. folds his arms.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{y'know, you got an awful short memory for direct orders. i told you to stay beside me.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{ c'mon, stephen.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{ you split the team, man. and what was that crap with the standpipe? you'd think you and a hose were never introduced before.}
<A>__{stephen turns to leave. brian yells after him.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{goddamn it stephen!}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{ i told you to stay next to me!}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{ i was doin' it! i was up there fucking doin' it. you don't know, man, you don't know what i did!}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{what you did was drop the ball, probie. get that right.}
<C>__{pengelly}
<P>__{(from end of alley)}
<D>__{hey! stevie! they're callin' for ya.}
<A>__{stephen turns to walk away. pauses.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{bet 30,000 dollars a year and twenty two days a month off sounded pretty good twelve weeks ago, huh?}
<A>__{as stephen leaves, we see that jennifer's been standing at the end of the alley, listening to them. she's turns and walks as brian looks up. we register his surprise. he watches her head toward a dynamic looking guy in his 40s, alderman swayzak, surrounded by reporters.}
