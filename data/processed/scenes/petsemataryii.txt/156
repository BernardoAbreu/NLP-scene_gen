<L>__{interior chase's van night}
<A>__{reaching the house, chase skids to a stop across the lawn.}
<L>__{188b interior attic night}
<A>__{chase cautiously enters with the gun in his grasp. the spring coil swings the creaking door shut behind him. from chase's vantage point, he can't see them yet. he makes his way around the stripped dressmaker's model, past an upright dressing mirror. and then he sees...}
<B>__{marjorie}
<A>__{slumped against renee's bed like a ragdoll. we can only see half of her face. it looks untouched. chase reaches for her...}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{marjorie?}
<A>__{marjorie's head rolls sideways, exposing the other half of her face. the skin has been stripped from her skull and peeled back... chase turns his head away. and that's when he sees them...}
<B>__{renee and geoff}
<A>__{holding each other tightly. geoff has his head buried in renee's breast. renee looks up from her son, meeting chase's gaze. her voice is both seductive and terrifying.}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{hello, chase.}
<A>__{chase gasps. the word "horror" doesn't do the moment justice.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{oh my god...}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{we can try again, chase. we can make it work this time.}
<A>__{chase sinks back against the wall. he's lost a lot of blood and his strength is leaving him.}
<C>__{chase}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{don't you love me anymore, chase?}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{you're not renee... renee's dead...}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{geoff! get over here now!}
<A>__{but geoff just holds his mother tighter. a hint of annoyance flickers through renee's eyes. she strokes geoff's hair.}
<C>__{renee}
<P>__{(looking at chase)}
<D>__{geoff, honey, why don't you go downstairs. your father and i need a moment alone. do it for me?}
<A>__{geoff looks up at his mother, mesmerized. she releases him from the embrace. he brushes past chase without a glance and heads for the attic door.}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{geoff...}
<A>__{geoff pauses at the door, looking back. renee's words have a hauntingly familiar ring...}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{i love you.}
<A>__{geoff smiles. turning away, he opens the door and...}
<B>__{clyde}
<A>__{is standing there, an axe perched on his shoulder. his face is torn to shit, bones and brain matter exposed. he's covered from head to toe in dirt and clotted blood. he looks worse than any of the undead we've seen. a total walking nightmare.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{hey, junior. wanna play?}
<A>__{whoosh! clyde swings the axe, sinking it into the wall just in front of geoff's face... geoff tumbles back onto the floor, snapping out of his trance. clyde brings the axe down... ...and geoff rolls to the side, barely avoiding decapitation.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{geoff!}
<A>__{chase stumbles forward to rescue his son. as he does so, clyde brings the axe back up, smashing chase in the head with the blunt end... chase goes down. unconscious.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{oops! looks like daddy got a boo boo...}
<A>__{clyde turns his gaze back on geoff.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{now, where were we?}
<A>__{geoff shuffles backwards across the floor as clyde moves into the room. renee passes behind clyde. she slams the attic door shut and snaps off the knob with a jerk of the wrist, locking them all inside. scared out of his wits, geoff makes it to his feet. clyde swings again and misses... geoff grabs hold of the axe handle, struggling, and the two boys go down...}
<B>__{renee}
<A>__{moves to the vanity. she sweeps a hand across it, sending everything crashing to the ground. crystal perfume bottles shatter, spilling their contents over the floor. renee reaches for a lighter and flicks it on. she touches the flame to the perfume soaked floor... flames roar into existence, racing across the floorboards, igniting the curtains... we see the flames reflected in renee's soulless eyes.}
<B>__{on geoff and clyde}
<A>__{as they wrestle with one another across the floor. bloody spittle drips from clyde's face. he flashes a feral snarl. clyde lunges forward and tears into geoff's shoulder with his teeth... geoff screams. his hands grope blindly for a weapon and close on a mirror shard. he jabs it up and into clyde's eye... somehow, geoff manages to roll out from under clyde. he rises to his feet... clyde lets loose a demonic roar. he charges, slashing the axe wildly, knocking aside curtains and dressing models alike. nothing's going to stop him. nothing. flames are consuming the attic, licking the rafters, igniting the canopy drapings... devouring everything. smoke is rolling across the floor... geoff reaches a far wall. he's trapped in a corner. there's nowhere else to go. behind geoff is a circuit box. insulated cables run from the box down through the attic floor. geoff turns... and here comes clyde...}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{here it comes, buddy! here it fucking comes!!!}
<A>__{clyde swings. geoff ducks. the axe hits the circuit box behind him, severing the insulated cables... as clyde rips the axe out of the wall for another try, geoff reaches for one of the sparking cables. clyde raises the axe above his head...}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{eat it, ass hole...}
<C>__{geoff}
<D>__{eat this!!!}
<A>__{...and geoff shoves the live cable into clyde's mouth! sparks shoot out of clyde's eyes and ears. he jerks back and forth, writhing in a horrific replay of renee's electrocution. then clyde's face blows apart in a gout of ruined flesh and blue flame. the circuit is blown and the smoking body falls... geoff drops the cable. the blazing inferno is closing in. he runs to chase... chase is barely conscious. geoff drops to his knees and pulls his father to his feet...}
<C>__{renee }
<D>__{don't leave me again, geoff!}
<A>__{geoff turns...}
<B>__{renee}
<A>__{is standing in the midst of the flames, reaching out. the make up and mortician's wax she wears fall victim to the heat and her "face" begins to melt away...}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{don't leave me alone!}
<A>__{geoff turns away, horrified. with chase on his shoulder, he reaches the door. locked. geoff sets chase against the wall. he spots the axe, still clutched in clyde's hand. geoff drags the axe free from the dead boy's grasp and goes to work on the door... ignoring renee's cries, geoff swings the axe again and again, chopping the door apart. he coughs through the smoke. the flames are almost upon them... finally, the wood splinters apart. geoff reaches through and grasps the outside handle, pulling the door open. then he turns and lifts chase up once more... at the door, geoff pauses for one final, tearful look back. then his face hardens and he turns away, pulling chase to safety.}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{no, geoff! no!!!}
<B>__{on renee}
<A>__{alone in the fiery storm, screaming. flames devour her flowing white dress. her face doesn't even look remotely human anymore. and as the inferno slowly closes in, we...}
