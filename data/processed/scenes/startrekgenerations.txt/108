<A>__{picard continues to walk around the perimeter of the forcefield. he sees something on the ground a gnarled root from a large nearby tree. the root is poking out of the ground, leaving a small arch through which daylight can be seen. picard's mind begins racing... he glances at soran and then picks up a pebble and, while keeping his eye on the root, he tosses the pebble into the air, where it hits the forcefield. the forcefield flashes on briefly and picard can see}
<D>__{that the bottom border of the field follows the contour of the root. but it does not extend underneath the arch.}
<A>__{ soran turns at the sound of the crackling field.}

<C>__{picard}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{soran returns to working on the launcher. but picard looks back down at the root... then walks away, planning his next move.}
