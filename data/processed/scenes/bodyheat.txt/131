<T>__{wipe to:}
<A>__{the first stretch of racine's route to "the breakers" looks different in the dense fog. racine has to take it slowly. he consults his watch. a branch from one of the overhanging trees looms up abruptly in the windshield, like a grasping arm. racine flinches.}
<L>__{exterior neighborhood night}
<A>__{racine drives through the silent neighborhood. the houses are invisible in the fog, their presence indicated only by an occasional glowing light. suddenly, a police siren pierces the night, followed by the appearance of a flashing red light on the street behind the cadillac.}
<L>__{interior cadillac night}
<A>__{racine's eyes jump to the rear view mirror and the flashing red light growing in it. racine pulls over. the police car slows as it reaches the cadillac, pulls alongside, and then speeds on ahead, siren squealing. a light goes on in the house in front of which racine has stopped. he pulls away.}
