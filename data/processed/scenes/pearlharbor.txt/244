<L>__{interior hotel room night}
<A>__{rafe enters his room and finds the light on...and evelyn's there waiting.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{what?...}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{they were bringing back a ship full of wounded and needed extra nurses along. i wrote colonel doolittle, and told him i needed to see you before you go.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{it must of been a convincing letter.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{it was. i couldn't have you go away, wherever it is...to war...without knowing something. you think i made a choice, of danny over you. i didn't. i didn't have a choice. i'm pregnant.}
<A>__{the blood drains from rafe's heart. yet he finds the strength to move to her. she turns away, so she won't throw her arms around him.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{does danny know?}
<A>__{she shakes her head, refuses to cry.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i wasn't sure, until the day you turned up alive. i never had a chance to tell him. now i can't have him thinking about this when he needs to be thinking about his mission, and how to come back from it.}
<A>__{she turns and faces him again.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i want you thinking about that too. just come back.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{rafe, i see it in your face. you're thinking you don't have anything to live for. don't you dare think that way. i will never write a letter, or look at a sunset, without thinking of you. i will love you my whole life. and i want you to live.}
<A>__{she looks at him, her eyes bright with tears, but still she refuses to cry. they both know they can't touch, or they'll never let go. she walks past him, out of the room, closing the door softly behind her.}
