<A>__{deserted. the wail of police sirens in the distance. charlie has his gun out. he's drenched in sweat. where is his partner?}

<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{another street alley night nick, gun drawn, slowly rounds the corner to the alley: it's the ad hoc drugstore for the night. drugs going up and down in pails, two dozen junkies buying, shooting, slumped on the ground. everyone scatters the one's that can.}
