<A>__{dyson enters with bryant. dyson and a guard stand together before what looks like a high tech bank vault. it requires two keys to open, like the launch controls in a nuclear silo. the guard and dyson insert their keys and turn them simultaneously. dyson then enters a passcode at a console and the vault unlocks itself with a sequence of clunks. the door swings open and dyson enters. bryant stays outside with the guard, who notes dyson's name and item on a clipboard.}
