<L>__{exterior western woods day}
<A>__{heavy rain. ichabod and young masbath ride side by side.}
<C>__{young masbath}
<D>__{if the crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the hessian. someone only tried to make it look that way.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{you grow sharper by the minute, little man. it boggles my mind, but i begin to prefer your company over all others.}
<C>__{young masbath}
<D>__{well... i'm one of the few people who likes you.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{true enough.}
<C>__{young masbath}
<D>__{then, who murdered the old crone? and why?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply.}
<A>__{a sound is heard. ichabod looks back, then to masbath.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{quicken pace.}
<A>__{ichabod rides faster. young masbath keeps up. further on, they charge over a hill. ichabod halts gunpowder and climbs clumsily off.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{ride on.}
<A>__{young masbath obeys. ichabod takes out his pistol and wades into forest growth, backtracking. inside the forest, ichabod bounds through underbrush, low. a horse is heard snorting. he pushes through branches... moving behind a figure in a grey cloak on horseback.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{halt and turn. i have a pistol aimed at your head.}
<A>__{the figure stops, pushes off the cloak hood. katrina.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{it is only me.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{katrina. why do you follow?}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{i apologize if i worried you.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{a woman should not be out alone in these woods.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{but, i am not alone, am i? i only wished to see what you were up to, and...}
<P>__{(takes out white rose)}
<D>__{to thank you.}
<A>__{ichabod softens, but doesn't want to.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{come along.}
