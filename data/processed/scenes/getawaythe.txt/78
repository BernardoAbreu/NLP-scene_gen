<A>__{doc steps out of the wagon, then pulls the leather suitcase out of the back. he quietly shuts the car door and moves around the side of the house, toward the barn garage at the rear. he looks carefully around the area, his eyes searching for signs of beynon's men. nothing seemingly amiss, he moves toward the front door, tries it, moves away. doc crosses to the back screen door of the house. after another moment, doc quietly opens the screen door and enters the house.}
