<A>__{establishing shot of smoking acupuncture needle, its tip embedded in drew's forearm. kwan's hand comes into frame and flicks the needle, sending it vibrating back and forth. camera pulls back to reveal drew sitting at the table in kwan's house, the acupuncture needle in his arm and his face pensive and sad. kwan busies himself around the needle, trying to alleviate the pain of drew's bruises.}
<C>__{kwan}
<D>__{next time we get that guy...}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{no next time, master. maybe...}
<P>__{(big sigh)}
<D>__{... you should find a new student. i just can't do it i'm not getting any better!}
<C>__{kwan }
<D>__{don't talk like that. at shaolin...}
<A>__{he pauses, and decides not to tell another shaolin temple story. drew looks at him funny this is very against his character.}
<C>__{kwan }
<D>__{i saw a shaolin monk once. i was only 5 years old at the time, but i remember it like it was yesterday. i was coming back from the market with my father. soldiers stopped us and were taking the food we had just bought. it was all we had left to eat no more money. these were hard times in china, people were selling their children for food, and the soldiers had no right. who can stop soldiers with guns, though? yes?}
<A>__{he pauses, and takes a sip of tea, checking the needle, adjusting it and turning it slightly this way and that.}
<C>__{kwan }
<D>__{just as the soldiers were leaving, a monk stepped out of the crowd and told them very calmly to put the food back. well, naturally, they didn't. they pushed the monk, and the next thing i knew the soldiers were in the street, and the food was back in my father's arms. 5 soldiers, and they were in a heap on the ground, their blood mixing with the dust of the street.}
<A>__{kwan smiles with the memory it is a sweet and heroic one.}
<C>__{kwan }
<D>__{the crowd whispered "shaolin", and he bowed to us, touched my cheek and smiled, then just walked on. i watched him until he disappeared in the distance. he was larger than life, a hero to a little boy of 5. i vowed then and there to become like him, fight for right like the shaolin.}
<A>__{he pauses again, looking at drew. drew meets his gaze, wondering why he is telling him this story.}
<C>__{kwan }
<D>__{i never did, though. my family left china and ended up here in new york, a young boy's dream left behind in china.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{you mean... all the stories...?}
<C>__{kwan}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{made up. i never trained at the shaolin temple. when i realized my dream couldn't come true, i convinced myself that it had anyway. it was a small step to convince other people.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{why are you telling me this?}
<C>__{kwan}
<D>__{i've given you all i can, and it's not enough. it was never enough. you're like a son to me, drew, and you have all the potential in the world, but i can't take you where you want to go.}
<A>__{kwan takes the needle out of drew's arm, and then rubs the spot where it was with a cotton ball.}
<C>__{kwan }
<D>__{there, that should control the swelling.}
<A>__{he watches drew, who is pondering what kwan has said.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{so you're not a shaolin?}
<C>__{kwan}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{never were?}
<C>__{kwan}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{drew nods, an idea forming in his head. a slight smile forms on his face. kwan was expecting him to be angry, he never expected this.}
<C>__{kwan }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{if you are not a shaolin warrior, then i will become one.}
<C>__{kwan}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i'm going to the shaolin temple they can train me so i will never lose like that again.}
<A>__{kwan feels drew's forehead. a long beat here as kwan studies drew's eyes.}
<C>__{kwan}
<D>__{he hit you so hard, you're delirious. i will get a cold cloth.}
<A>__{he starts to get up, but drew grabs his arm and forces him back down.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(eyes intent)}
<D>__{don't you see? you said yourself i needed the right training where better than the shaolin temple? what's holding me here? i have the chance to do what you couldn't. i will go to the shaolin temple.}
<A>__{kwan looks at him, realizes he's serious. he nods his head, giving the idea serious consideration. he smiles along with drew.}
<C>__{kwan}
<D>__{i must pay for your ticket...}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{no! i will make it there myself.}
<C>__{kwan}
<D>__{i grew up on the stories of the shaolin, and you can be those stories. you can live my dream for me at least let me help you. let an old man make up for the trouble he's caused.}
<A>__{kwan touches drew's bruised cheek, fatherly love in his eyes. drew nods his head, then bows in the traditional chinese manner.}
<C>__{drew}
