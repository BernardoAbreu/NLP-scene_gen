<L>__{exterior camp 8 day}
<A>__{a low slung, single story bunkhouse surrounded by a dirt yard. two shooter shacks sit at diagonal corners of the yard. in each shack, two trusties with rifles keep vigilant watch over the camp. sgt. fred dillard paces down the line of new men as hoppin' bob, an uncommonly ugly trusty, unlocks their leg irons.}
<C>__{dillard}
<D>__{this here is camp 8. camp 8 is for incorrigibles, so whatever you've done to get here, believe me, we're not impressed. you new men are probably noticing that we have no fences here at camp 8. we don't need no fences, we have the gun line. it runs from shack to shack clear around the yard. you are now inside the gun line. if you step outside the gun line without my permission, you will be shot. if you trip and fall over the gun line, you will be shot. if you spit, if you pee, if you stick your ass out and take a dump over the gun line, you will be shot.}
<A>__{dillard plucks a hat off one of the new prisoners and tosses it over the gun line. shots ring out from the nearest shack. the hat is torn to shreds.}
<C>__{dillard}
<D>__{one of my trusties puts a bullet in you when you're trying to run, i'm liable to give him a pardon for saving me the trouble of tracking you down, so you can bet their aim is true.}
<A>__{dillard puts a cigarette in his mouth. hoppin' bob is right there with the flame.}
<C>__{dillard}
<D>__{my name is sgt. dillard. in the unlikely event that you need to address me, you call me boss. you already met this handsome fella right here. hoppin' bob's my ace boon coon. you run afoul of hoppin' bob, you run afoul of me.}
<A>__{nodding to bob, dillard saunters off.}
<C>__{hoppin' bob}
<D>__{new men, strip down!}
<A>__{ray and claude share a look. self consciously, the men begin to undress.}
