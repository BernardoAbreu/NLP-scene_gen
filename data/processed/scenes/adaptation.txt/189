<A>__{donald lies on his back on the floor intently reading the script. kaufman paces. donald finishes, is quiet.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{so, like, what would you do?}
<C>__{donald}
<D>__{script kind of makes fun of me, huh?}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{sorry. i was trying something. i }
<C>__{donald}
<D>__{hey, i don't mind. it's funny.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{okay. so, what would you do?}
<C>__{donald}
<D>__{you and me are so different, charles. we're different talents.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{i know. just for fun. how would the great donald end this script?}
<C>__{donald}
<P>__{(giggling)}
<D>__{the great donald.}
<P>__{(serious)}
<D>__{well, i mean... do you need the whole court case?}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{uh, it's what happened to laroche. it's kind of important.}
<C>__{donald}
<D>__{it's boring. no offense. a courtroom scene should be dramatic. stick the ruling in a line of dialogue, maybe.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{um. okay.}
<C>__{donald}
<D>__{too much about orchids. get rid of it. pare that stuff down to a minimum. frankly, i'd focus more on the relationship between the brothers. i think that's the gold here. no one cares about orchids.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{the book's about orchids.}
<C>__{donald}
<D>__{that's a problem. but don't let it ruin the movie. i mean, for example, use the orchids in a more dramatic way. have some kind of bang up, crazy action sequence in the swamp. use the swamp better. it's a tremendous fictional world. a setting of great dramatic possibility.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{that's true. but }
<C>__{donald}
<D>__{and put some twists in. reveal some surprising thing about laroche. god, what am i doing giving suggestions to you? i mean you're like a seasoned professional. you're an artist.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{c'mon, you're the "mill five" kid.}
<C>__{donald}
<P>__{(enjoying this)}
<D>__{shut up!}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{i love the laroche porno web site stuff. is that real? maybe make a bigger deal of that. i don't know.}
<C>__{kaufman}
<D>__{i think it's real. i haven't actually seen the site.}
<C>__{donald}
<D>__{it's sex, man! incorporate it.}
