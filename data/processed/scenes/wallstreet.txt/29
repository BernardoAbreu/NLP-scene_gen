<L>__{interior 21 club day}
<A>__{dark mahagony wood, plush banquettes, a long oak bar. bud enters the main dining room in a relatively outre suit that hangs on him embarrassingly as other businessmen in well cut suits move around him and a maitre d' sniffs, then leads him to where gekko is parked, finishing up his lunch. a half finished plate is removed to make way for bud.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{hi sport.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(still nervous)}
<D>__{nice to see you again mr. gekko.}
<A>__{he's seated.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{try the steak tartare. it's off the menu but louis'll make it for you...}
<C>__{maitre d'}
<D>__{of course sir. and to drink?}
<A>__{he looks at gekko's bottled water.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{uh...just a evian, thank you...}
<A>__{the maitre d' leaves. gekko proudly pulls a tiny 3" by 6" color television out of his pocket with a 2" diagonal screen, flips it on to the dow jones avarages.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{see this? can you believe it? two inch screen...}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{...i can't even see it...}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{...for my kid rudy 3 years old, electronics freak, got a liquid crystal display 'stead of an electronic beam. we're going into a new age pal. so how's business today.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{bluestar was at 21 and an eighth when i left the office. it might spin up to 25 by the bell...}
<C>__{gekko}
<P>__{(a tiny smile)}
<D>__{teldar's shooting up. buy any for yourself? bet you were on the phone two minutes after you got out of my office.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(flushes)}
<D>__{no sir, that would've been illegal...}
<C>__{gekko}
<P>__{(doesn't believe him)}
<D>__{sure...relax sport, no one's gonna blow a whistle. here, is this legal?...you wanna put it in my account?}
<A>__{as he fishes a check out and drops it on bud's plate. greeting two bankers who stop at the table as bud picks up the check, glances at it. his hand starts to tremble. the check is for $500,000.}
<C>__{gekko}
<P>__{(to bus boy, the bankers excited)}
<D>__{can we have the check over here for christ's sake.}
<C>__{bus boy}
<P>__{(rushing off)}
<D>__{yes sir!}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{cover the bluestar buy and put a couple hundred thou in one of those bow wow stocks you mentioned. pick the dog with the least fleas. use a stop loss so your downside is 50,000, and buy yourself a decent suit. you can't come in here looking like that.}
<P>__{(bud flushes, embarassed)}
<D>__{go to morty sills, tell 'em i sent you.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(his genuine look)}
<D>__{mr. gekko thank you for the chance. you won't regret this, you're with a winner.}
<C>__{gekko}
<P>__{(paying the check with cash)}
<D>__{...put the rest of it in a money market account for now. i want to see what you know before i invest it...and save the cheap salesman talk, it's obvious.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(stung)}
<D>__{excuse me sir.}
<A>__{gekko rising to leave, the maitre d' hovering around.}
<C>__{gekko}
<D>__{you heard me...i don't like losses sport. nothing ruins my day more than losses... you do good, you get perks, all kinds of perks. stay home tonight. louis, take care of 'im. enjoy the lunch.}
<A>__{confused, bud watches gekko walk out of the room, pumping extended hands left and right. he holds the cashiers check up to his eyes, entranced by it, like a kid with his first dollar...as the raw steak tartare with an egg on top is put in front of him.}
