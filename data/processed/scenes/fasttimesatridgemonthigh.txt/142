<L>__{interior jeff spicoli's room night}
<A>__{jeff spicoli sits in his room, and it is his castle. clothes lie in disarray on the floor. a huge half waxed surfboard is propped against the window. we see spicoli dressed in a too large white short sleeved shirt, attempting to tie his father's fat paisley tie. he stops to take a hit from his bong, all the while talking on the phone. the music of lynyrd skynyrd's "freebird" plays on the radio.}
<C>__{spicoli}
<D>__{i... am... so... wasted, mon. what is in this shit?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{doesn't that stuff cause brain damage?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{bitchin'.}
<A>__{spicoli listens for a moment. he rubs his eyes, shakes his head. he is really buzzed.}
<C>__{spicoli }
<D>__{hey, mon, i am going to mexico as soon as school is out. two more weeks, bud. week from wednesday.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i am gonna take both boards, my duck feet, many cases of beer, and just jam.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{no, mon, from school. i'm leaving as soon as school gets out. i will be at sunset cliffs by nighttime.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{totally.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{later.}
<A>__{spicoli hangs up, and concentrates on tying his tie. he almost strangles himself. then suddenly the door to his room flies open and spicoli's little brother curtis bursts in.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{jeff you have company!}
<C>__{spicoli}
<D>__{go away, curtis. if you can't knock, i can't hear you.}
<A>__{curtis slams the door and leaves. a moment later there is a knock.}
<C>__{spicoli }
<D>__{that's better. come in.}
<A>__{the door swings open and jeff spicoli sits in stoned shock at the sight before him. there, standing in the doorway of his room is mr. hand.}
<C>__{spicoli }
<D>__{mr... mr. hand.}
<C>__{mr. hand}
<D>__{that's right, jeff. mind if i come in?}
<A>__{spicoli can only nod.}
<C>__{mr. hand }
<P>__{(calling downstairs)}
<D>__{thank you, mr. and mrs. spicoli.}
<A>__{hand walks into spicoli's room, takes off his suit jacket and lays it on the chair back. he stops a moment and catches the stare of miss january penthouse on the wall, then turns to spicoli.}
<C>__{mr. hand }
<D>__{were you going somewhere tonight, jeff?}
<C>__{spicoli}
<D>__{yeah. the graduation dance mr. hand. it's the last school event of the year.}
<C>__{mr. hand}
<D>__{i'm afraid we've got some things to discuss here, jeff.}
<C>__{spicoli}
<D>__{did i do something wrong, mr. hand?}
<A>__{hand removes several copies of oui magazine from another chair and sits down. he sets his briefcase on spicoli's dresser, next to a bag of pot, and opens it up for easy access.}
<C>__{mr. hand}
<D>__{do you want to sit there, jeff?}
<C>__{spicoli}
<D>__{i don't know. i guess so.}
<C>__{mr. hand}
<D>__{fine. you sit right here on your bed. i will use the chair here.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{as i explained to your parents just a moment ago, and to you many times since the very beginning of the school year i don't like to spend my time waiting for late students, or detention cases. i'd rather be preparing the lesson.}
<A>__{mr. hand takes a sheet from his briefcase and looks at it.}
<C>__{mr. hand }
<D>__{according to my calculations, mr. spicoli, you wasted a total of eight hours of my time this year. and rest assured that is a kind estimate.}
<A>__{he returns the sheet to his case and looks into spicoli's weed ravaged eyes.}
<C>__{mr. hand }
<D>__{now, mr. spicoli, comes a rare moment for me. now i have the unique pleasure of squaring our account. tonight, you and i are going to talk in great detail about the davis agreement, all the associated treaties, and the american revolution in particular. now if you can just turn to chapter 47 of lord of truth and liberty.}
<C>__{spicoli}
<D>__{hey, it's in my locker, mr. hand.}
<C>__{mr. hand}
<D>__{well, then, i'm glad i remembered to bring an extra copy just for you.}
<A>__{hand reaches in his case and produces the book. he hands it to spicoli.}
