<L>__{exterior slate needle night}
<A>__{rescue vehicles and police cars roar up, slam to a halt, cat sirens wailing. the rescue workers jump out. firefighters carry circular trampolines of hide stitched to bamboo frames; others go to the back of their trucks and start to turn cranks on the hook and ladder trucks to raise the ladders.}
<B>__{close on a hook and ladder truck}
<A>__{it's actually a wheeled carriage carrying a firesaurus, which is a critter with a very tiny body and an incred ibly long neck. the bony plates on the creature's back make perfect stairs. however, the creature is noticeably listless and uncooperative.}
<C>__{fire chief}
<D>__{come on, come on, what's the hold up ?}
<C>__{firefighter}
<D>__{it's the kibble crisis, sir the firesauruses have been on half rations for a month!}
<A>__{above them, the building shudders again.}
<B>__{in the slate needle}
<A>__{now, the remaining light fixtures crash down. when they hit the floor, the oil lamps inside spills and fire spreads.}
<C>__{wilma}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{fred! there's a fire hose !}
<A>__{indeed, it's on the back wall in a closed box marked fire hose in case of emergency break glass. fred and barney take a step towards it, but the fire quickly spreads and cuts them off. helpless, they step back. with a thunderous roar, the two slate scrapers visible through what's left of the picture window collapse. then the big statue of slate just outside the window begins to decompose. it falls in on itself like a sand sculpture in a storm... finally, for a split second it is, well, life sized, and then the head of the statue snaps loose, crashes through the only remaining pane of glass here ... rolls up to slate's feet. pause. everyone looks at everyone else. this is it: titanic time. fred embraces wilma... barney embraces betty. their kids are pulled into the clinch. even slate takes mrs. slate's hand. talk about grace under pressure... and speaking of }
<B>__{grace}
<A>__{ the star fashion model, suddenly her fibrethread costume decomposes, leaving her in her cute little animal print undies.}
<B>__{betty}
<A>__{in the middle of going down with the ship, she turns bam bam's face away from this display.}
<D>__{bam bam d dad, are we gonna be okay?}
<C>__{barney}
<P>__{(pause; false smile)}
<D>__{sure, pal. we just gotta wait for the fire department. right, fred?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{y yeah. everything's gonna be just whoa, hoo hah, aggh }
<A>__{he's started yelping because he's realized his arm is on fire, and now he jumps up and the others begin beating at the arm with anything in their hands, and then fred suddenly pushes away from them, stands there with a small flame flickering on his forearm like a rock vegas stage magician.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{ wait a minute i don't feel anything at all }
<A>__{with his other "claw" he slaps tentatively at the flames, and then confidentially snuffs it out.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{it must be the suit, fred old bedrock high built them things to last }
<A>__{fred looks over at the wall of flame separating the guests from the fire hose. as everyone gets the same idea, dino rushes up, the costume head in his mouth. all brighten. barney helps fred with the head, twists it into place.}
<C>__{barney}
<P>__{(rapping on the head)}
<D>__{ okay?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{hist hust fine!}
<A>__{he lowers his head, runs through the fire, which licks at him harmlessly. then with his claw, he smashes the amber glass }
<B>__{in the box}
<A>__{a big pythonsaurus is curled up inside, snoring. (note to herpetologists: the pythonosaurus is not quite a snake: it has little vestigial forepaws the better to emote with. right now the snoring head is in those little paws.) the pythonsaurus stirs, looks at fred, "sniffs" the smoke. then he raises one hand and finger as if to say "one moment." then the pythonsaurus turns his head towards a nozzle like the ones in hamster cages, slurps loudly. we hear gallons and gallons of water gurgling away...}
<B>__{in the main room}
<A>__{everyone retreats from the fire. slate picks up the head of the statue, his only souvenir.}
<B>__{with fred}
<A>__{waiting impatiently until the pythonsaurus finally finishes drinking. it wipes its mouth daintily with a napkin, slaps a little fire helmet on its head, turns and runs back into the other room. (behind him, yards and yards of pythonsaurus unroll from a hidden compart ment behind the box.) water shoots out of the creature's mouth.}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{fred turns in a semi circle and puts out every lick of flame in the room. all the guests cheer, rush forward and slap fred on the back. pebbles jumps up on him and kisses him.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{hit fuzz nudding... wheely...}
<A>__{the pythonsaurus looks around at the attention.}
<C>__{pythonsaurus}
<D>__{hey, what am i, chopped liver?}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{come on, everybody we'll go out the way we came!}
<A>__{barney squirts a pathway with his flit gun, solidifying a route in the crumbling fibrerock. then barney and fred stand back nobly, wave everyone on into the adjacent fibresphere.}
<C>__{poindexter}
<P>__{(pushing and shoving)}
<D>__{outta the way outta the way women and children first ! i mean, ah, children and women first, yeah, yeah, provided that uh, there's room for the women...}
<A>__{meanwhile, the pythonsaurus gives fred (or rather his costume) a big look up and down, looks toward the camera.}
<C>__{pythonsaurus}
<D>__{hey, not bad. wonder if she lives around here.}
<A>__{just then fred tilts back the monster head. the pythonsaurus reacts.}
<C>__{pythonsaurus}
<D>__{heartbreaker!}
<A>__{depressed, the pythonsaurus follows the others. fred and barney cross over into the fibresphere. as the do, slate needle completely collapses.}
