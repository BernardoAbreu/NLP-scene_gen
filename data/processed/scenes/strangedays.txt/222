<T>__{cut to several minutes later:}
<A>__{. mace and lenny are being escorted through the crowd by strickland and a number of cops who part the rowdy mob before them. lenny and mace are both limping, bruised, cut up. lenny's arm is drenched with blood from his shoulder wound. they support each other like two soldiers after a battle. mace sees faith... faith, escorted by a couple of cops, passing near them. she is in handcuffs and her eyes are dull. mace turns back to lenny...}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{are we under arrest?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{naw. they just have to ask us a few questions... for about six hours.}
<A>__{they pass death, with the (plastic) baby still in his arms. life out of death in the endless continuum. lenny pushes the scythe out of the way so they can get past. they reach a row of police cars and an ambulance. the emt guys run to lenny, helping him painfully out of his suit jacket. strickland motions mace toward a waiting squad car. lenny sees... the clock mime, who smiles at him and puts his hands at midnight. we hear a roar passing through the crowd. a huge chanting and cheering, that becomes thunderous as everyone begins to shout the countdown to midnight.}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{ten! nine! eight!...}
<A>__{lenny and mace look around... the wonder of it sinking in.}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{seven! six! five!...}
<A>__{mace and lenny let it wash over them... the deliverance from darkness.}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{four! three! two! one! happy new year!}
<A>__{the exultation of the moment flows through them as the people lift their voices in a great cheer. balloons are released, confetti and streamers fly in a blizzard. couples grab each other and kiss passionately.}
<C>__{mace}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{hey, lenny. we made it.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{yeah. we did.}
<A>__{she hugs him. then pulls back. friends... yes. and always. but there's that line that she can't cross. only he can do that.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{well...}
<P>__{(she shrugs)}
<D>__{get going. you're still bleeding.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{see you downtown.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{yeah. see you there.}
<A>__{tracking with lenny as he walks toward the ambulance. they open the back door for him. the walk is hallucinatory... with confetti falling like snow, and the hysteria of the crowd. he looks back at mace as the paramedics help him up into the ambulance. the back doors close. on mace, watching him go. a cop gently takes her arm, opening the squad car door for her. she turns away, her face sad amid the exultation of the crowd. she gets into the back seat. the door slams. strickland gets in next to her. the driver starts the car. they start to move, and... there is pounding on the glass, startling her, and... the door is wrenched open... a hand comes in, grabbing her arm, pulling her out... lenny. his eyes are full of emotion. he grabs her in his arms, fiercely, and kisses her... like there's no tomorrow. she grabs his head and won't let him break, even if he wanted to, which he doesn't. strickland, in the car, rolls his eyes and looks at his watch. reflex. because if there's one time you don't need a watch, it's...}
