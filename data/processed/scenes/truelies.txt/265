<A>__{it looks like the aftermath of a battle... burning wreckage, black smoke, bodies. not a living soul around. the smoke swirls as two big bell 206 helicopters settle on the middle of the dock. gib jumps out of the nearest with an ar 15, scanning the wreckage. several of his men, and a couple of dea agents, spread out. gib breaks into a grin as he sees harry, materializing out of the swirling smoke. dripping wet, clothes ripped and bloody. but okay.}
