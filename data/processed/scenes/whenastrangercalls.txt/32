<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior city street late afternoon}
<A>__{not a terribly good section of town. we are looking at the nondescript exterior of a bar across the street.}
<L>__{interior bar}
<A>__{this is not a slum bar, but it's close. there are a few tables and chairs and a pool table in the back. the atmosphere is quiet, almost depressed, and the handful of regulars here are exercising their privacy without having to be alone. they include: hank, the bartender, also the owner, who absently polishes things with his cloth; tracy, an unemployed woman in her mid forties who sits at the bar with a drink and a cigarette and silently rummages through her current feelings none of them new or particularly hopeful; a couple, probably retired, sitting at the same table they come to every afternoon at this time him for his beer, her for a glass of sweet white wine; and bill, at the pool table, a young man lithe and powerful, minding his own business and playing his game of pool with a steady, aggressive concentration.}
<C>__{retired man}
<D>__{rackin' 'em up today, bill?}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(over his shoulder)}
<D>__{doin' all right.}
<A>__{the old man smiles stupidly around the room. he racked 'em up a little in his day, too. his smile fades as he looks at his wife. he takes a sip of beer and lapses into memories. then the door opens to the outside and the yellow orange light of late afternoon floods into the bar. the regulars turn to glimpse who's coming in. they see the figure of a man silhouetted in the doorway. he stands there for a long moment, not coming in. finally even bill interrupts his game to turn and look.}
<C>__{hank}
<D>__{c'mon in and shut the door.}
<A>__{the intruder enters, indecisively. the door swings shut behind him, plunging the room back into darkness. this man is "a little weird", and the regulars continue to stare at him until he makes his way to a table near the wall and sits down. then everyone returns to his own thoughts.}
<C>__{hank}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{what'll it be?}
<P>__{(pause, no answer)}
<D>__{hey! what'll it be?}
<A>__{closeup intruder a bit startled, a bit defensive toward the directness of this question. it is curt duncan. he looks understandably harried. he hasn't slept or shaved in at least a couple of days, and is wearing regular clothing. he clears his throat to answer...}
<C>__{clifford }
<D>__{what kind of clothes was he wearing... when he escaped?}
