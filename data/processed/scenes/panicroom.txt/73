<L>__{interior panic room night}
<A>__{very close on the metal door, from inside the panic room. an ear moves slowly into frame, presses against the cold steel. listens. meg pulls away from the door, shaking her head.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{can't hear a thing.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{what do they want?}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{i don't know. rob us. i don't know.}
<A>__{she sits back against a wall, looks around, at the tiny room. she's trying not to show how freaked out she is.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{what do we do?}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{wait.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{what if they get in here?}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{they can't. they can't get in here. no. they can't.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i heard you.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{feel okay?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{shaky?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{nope.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{chills?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{huh uh.}
<A>__{she checks her wristwatch, for some reason.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{don't worry about me.}
<A>__{the implications being, worry about yourself. sarah crawls over to the bank of video monitors, studies them. meg crawls over to join her. they scan the screens. on the monitors, there are a dozen different views of the house. front stoop. kitchen. dining room. entry floor. living room. master bedroom. den. top floor bedrooms, both of them. top two floor hallways. even one with a shot of the inside of the elevator. the three intruders are gathered in the living room, standing in a tight circle, having a hell of an argument. lots of gesturing, fingers jabbing in chests, but we can't hear a word. in the panic room, meg furrows her brow, noticing something interesting to the right of the video monitors. she slides over, studies a panel there with sixteen different buttons and a small grilled area.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{hey...}
<A>__{sarah joins her, looks at the buttons. each one is labeled with a different room name den, kitchen, master bedroom, etc. up in the corner there is a button that says "all page," down in the opposite corner there's a button marked "talk." meg looks at sarah.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<A>__{meg is reluctant, frightened. sarah is encouraging, for the first time.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{you can do it.}
<A>__{meg leans forward, clears her throat.}
