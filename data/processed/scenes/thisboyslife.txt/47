<L>__{exterior residential street afternoon}
<A>__{toby stands at the top of a small hill with terry silver and terry taylor. they are too casual, their faces too innocent: something's up. they wait until a middle aged man raking leaves turns and disappears around a corner. then the three of them open the door of a car, take off the emergency brake, and start it rolling down the hill. the car rolls silently down the hill. it crashes into another car at the bottom, making a loud noise. the three boys run like the wind out of sight.}
