<L>__{interior susan's room night }
<A>__{it's in moderate disorder. the mansbach gas lights are on. it's not really a classy room, but it's exactly what you're entitled to in 1910, for $5.00 a week including breakfast. there is a bed, a couple of chairs, a chiffonier, and a few personal belongings on the chiffonier. these include a photograph of a gent and lady, obviously susan's parents, and a few objets d'art. one, "at the japanese rolling ball game at coney island," and perhaps this is part of the japanese loot the glass globe with the snow scene kane was holding in his hand in the first sequence. susan comes into the room, carrying a basin, with towels over her arm. kane is waiting for her. she doesn't close the door.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(by way of explanation)}
<D>__{my landlady prefers me to keep this door open when i have a gentleman caller.}
<P>__{(starts to put the basin down)}
<D>__{she's a very decent woman.}
<P>__{(making a face)}
<D>__{ow!}
<A>__{kane rushes to take the basin from her, putting it on the chiffonier. to do this, he has to shove the photograph to one side of the basin. susan grabs the photograph as it is about to fall over.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{hey, you should be more careful. that's my ma and pa.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{i'm sorry. they live here, too?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{no. they've passed on.}
<A>__{again she puts her hand to her jaw.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{where's the soap?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{in the water.}
<A>__{kane fishes the soap out of the water. it is slippery, however, and slips out of his hand, hitting him in the chest before it falls to the floor. susan laughs as he bends over.}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(starting to wash his hands)}
<D>__{you're very easily amused.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i always like to see the funny side of things. no sense crying when you don't have to. and you're so funny. looking at you, i forget all about my toothache.}
<A>__{her face distorts in pain again.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{oh!}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{i can't stay here all night chasing your pain away.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i know... but you do look so silly.}
<A>__{kane, with soaped hands, has rubbed his face and now cannot open his eyes, for fear of getting soap in them.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{where's the towel?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{on the chiffonier. here.}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(rubs his face dry)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(on her way to closet)}
<D>__{i've got a brush in the closet. as soon as the mud on your trousers is all dry you just brush it off.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{i will get these streets fixed, if it's the last thing i do.}
<A>__{susan comes out of the closet. she holds out the brush with her left hand, her right hand to her jaw in real distress.}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(takes the brush)}
<D>__{you are in pain, aren't you, you poor kid?}
<A>__{susan can't stand it anymore and sits down in a chair, bent over, whimpering a bit.}
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(brushing himself)}
<D>__{wish there was something i could }
<A>__{he stops and thinks. susan, her face averted, is still trying hard not to cry.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{i've got an idea, young lady.}
<P>__{(there is no response)}
<D>__{turn around and look at me.}
<P>__{(there is still no response)}
<D>__{i said, turn around and look at me, young lady.}
<A>__{slowly, susan turns.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{did you ever see anybody wiggle both his ears at the same time?}
<A>__{it takes a second for susan to adapt herself to this.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{watch closely!}
<P>__{(he wiggles his ears)}
<D>__{it took me two solid years at the finest boys' school in the world to learn that trick. the fellow who taught me is president of venezuela now.}
<A>__{he's still wiggling his ears as susan starts to smile.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{that's it! smile!}
<A>__{susan smiles, very broadly.}
