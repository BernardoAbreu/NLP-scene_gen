<L>__{interior foyer early evening}
<A>__{the house is filled with exquisite flower arrangements, candles everywhere. jerry and judy adams are on the porch, just beyond the glass of the front door. their argument is inaudible. they're in their mid thirties, conservatively dressed. she's stunning, genetically nervous. jerry carries a briefcase. she's got the gift. sally opens the door. hugs and buses them, hello.}
