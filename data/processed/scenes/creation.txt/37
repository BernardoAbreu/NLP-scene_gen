<L>__{exterior the front gate. the present. day.}
<A>__{the coach pulls up and hooker alights ten years older than when we saw him catching fish, but still with the same hallmark side whiskers and wire rimmed spectacles, the same springy step and ready grin. already he is being mobbed by the younger boys lenny, franky, and horace who clearly adore him.}
<C>__{boys}
<D>__{ we're the light brigade horace is a russian.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{good choice horace. i shall be lord raglan and watch the slaughter from a safe distance.}
<C>__{boys}
<D>__{ will you give us a piggy back? lenny cut his foot on a nail. there was lots of blood!}
<A>__{emma emerges from the front door. she smiles, pleased to see hooker despite her misgivings. then her smile falters as another man emerges from the coach behind him.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{emma. forgive the short notice. you know thomas huxley.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{only by reputation}
<C>__{huxley}
<D>__{mrs darwin.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{he insisted on coming and i could not refuse him.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{tell papa his visitors are here.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{he knows already.}
<C>__{horace}
<D>__{he went that way.}
<A>__{emma smiles brightly, covering for her embarrassment at her husband's increasingly erratic behavior.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{anyway. come in please. come in.}
<A>__{hooker heads towards the house, the boy still clustered around him.}
<C>__{franky}
<D>__{sir, is it true when you were in the himalayas you were imprisoned by the king of sikkim?}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{absolutely true.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{and he thought you were a spy for stealing his rhododendrons?}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{that's approximately true.}
<C>__{franky}
<D>__{....and he wouldn't let you leave unless you agreed to marry his fattest daughter.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{yes. (conspiratorial) ....but you are never to tell my wife that!}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{children leave mr hooker alone now. i'm sure he has more important things to discuss.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{not really, but i think mr huxley does....}
<A>__{huxley has seen darwin, washing his hands by the "skeletonizing shed". huxley hangs back to introduce himself as hooker steers emma off into the house.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{i have my heart set on a cup of tea and one of mrs davies' scones.}
<A>__{emma looks anxiously after huxley but allows herself to be gently side lined.}
