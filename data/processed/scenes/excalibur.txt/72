<L>__{exterior gorge through the hills day}
<A>__{a waterfall cascades into a pool. the spray casts a rainbow. beneath it is a colorful confusion of flowers and budding trees, a place dreamlike in its beauty. arthur, with merlin behind, gallops along the edge of the pool. the trail widens into a field of grass. arthur reins beside a pile of broken lances and twisted shields. across the field, pitched upon the trail is a war tent made of diaphanous white silk, a sky blue banner above it. merlin slides off and arthur continues. from the tent, a knight with jousting lance rides forward to meet him. his armor is so shiny it is a mirror. his eyes, seen through the open visor, seem to laugh. his speech is foreign, from across the sea. he is lancelot of the lake.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{good day to you, sir.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{move aside. this is the king's road, and the knights you joined arms against were his very own.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{i await the king himself. his knights are in need of training.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i am king, and this is excalibur, sword of kings from the dawn of time. who are you, and why do you block the way?}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{i am sir lancelot of the lake, from across the sea. i am the best knight in the whole of christiandom, and i look for the king who is worthy of my sword's service.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{ that is a wild boast. you lack a knight's humility.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{not a boast, sir, but a curse.}
<P>__{(a cloud passes over his innocent face)}
<D>__{never have i met my match in joust or duel.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{move aside!}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{i will not. you must retreat or prove your kingship in the test of arms, under the eyes of god.}
<A>__{he crosses himself.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{then may he give me the strength to unhorse you and send you with one blow back across the sea.}
<A>__{arthur wheels away, trembling with anger, and gallops to his edge of the field. he sees that lancelot has already positioned himself and is waiting, lance down. merlin watches, a spectator, as the two charge at each other. they collide with great force, their spears shattering. arthur is jolted but stays in the saddle. lancelot's jousting is impeccable. arthur draws excalibur.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{hold! i offer you another lance.}
<A>__{pages come forward with new lances for arthur and lancelot.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{you joust well, sir. battle learnt, but tournament fancy. you should ride more forward in the saddle, though.}
<A>__{arthur grabs the spear from the page's hands, and circles back to work the horse up into an all out gallop. lancelot spurs forward to meet him. arthur is neatly unhorsed. he picks himself up from the ground in a rage, drawing excalibur. lancelot on his horse weaves circles around him.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{yield. i have the advantage.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i will not.}
<A>__{arthur charges lancelot, a raging bull, but cuts and slashes only at the air as lancelot stays clear of him.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{fight me from your horse or on foot, but fight me. your avoidance mocks me.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{i sought only not to harm you, sir.}
<A>__{he dismounts and draws his sword, and they clash. shield and sword and armor against shield and sword and armor. the swordplay is furious, arthur attacking, slashing, hacking, lancelot parrying effortlessly, elegantly defensive. arthur breaks the onslaught to catch his breath. lancelot lifts his visor. his eyes are calm, laughing.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{sir, your rage has unbalanced you. it seems you would fight to the death against a knight who is not your enemy, for a length of road you can ride around.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{so be it, to the death.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{it is you, sir, who knows not the virtue of humility, as a true king must.}
<A>__{arthur goes forward attacking with terrible blows upon lancelot's shield, and lancelot holds his ground, shield high. and in its mirror like metal arthur can see his own reflection, a face distorted by uncontrolled passion. arthur discards his own shield, grabs excalibur with both hands, and with a frightening shout that speaks of all his rage, he swings a terrific blow upon the shield, cutting through his own reflection and the metal. and excalibur snaps in two. a blinding blue green light explodes from the broken sword. lancelot, knocked back by the force of the blow, is stunned by the blast and falls to the ground unconscious. arthur backs away, horrified, half of excalibur in his hand.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what horror is this?}
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{merlin!}
<A>__{merlin approaches, pale, gripped by dread.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{the sword is broken. hope is broken...}
<A>__{arthur picks up the broken blade, utterly undone.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{my pride broke it, my rage broke it... humiliation and defeat lie in ambush even for a king.}
<P>__{(looking at lancelot)}
<D>__{this excellent knight who fought with fairness and grace was meant to win. with excalibur, i tried to change that verdict.}
<A>__{merlin stands there, drawn, defeated, his hopes dead.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i have lost for all time the ancient sword of my fathers whose power was meant to unite all men, to serve the vanity of a single man.}
<A>__{despairing, he flings the two parts of excalibur into the pool. he kneels at the waters edge, and he cries.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i am nothing.}
<A>__{then arthur sees something that startles him. beneath the surface, suspended in the blue green water amid the dancing weeds, he sees excalibur, intact. it is held by a maiden in flowing gown the color of water, her long hair rippling across her face, obscuring it.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{excalibur! is it true?}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{the lady of the lake. take it. take it, quickly!}
<A>__{arthur dips his hand under the water and grasps the hilt and the moment he does the vision in the blue green water fades. he rises with excalibur in hand, and merlin speaks before arthur can ask the question.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{there are infinite worlds within the infinite coils of the dragon. in one of them, which i have not traveled, the sword was forged. i only know that the king is returned to us through the instrument of his power. the game continues!}
<A>__{and he laughs. just then lancelot stirs. arthur rushes to his side. he loosens his helmet and removes it, uncovering damp curls. the young knight's eyes open, and his laughing charm once more animates his face.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{thanks to god, you are alive.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<P>__{(sitting up)}
<D>__{i, the best knight in the world, bested! this is a great day, for my search is over. i love you, my king.}
<A>__{he embraces arthur, who is overwhelmed by his childlike directness. the king helps him to his feet.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you are still the best knight in christiandom. you gained a hundred advantages over me. it is i who must love you, for through your courage and patience you taught me a bitter lesson.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{then make me your champion and i will always fight in your place.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{but your life and lands are far from here.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{i gave up my castles and my lands!}
<A>__{he thumps his breastplate.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{my domain is here, inside this metal skin. and i would pledge to you all that i still own: muscle, bone, blood and the heart that pumps it.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{and a great heart it is. sir lancelot, you will be my champion.}
<A>__{lancelot draws his sword, holding it by the blade, a crucifix.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{in the name of jesus christ and his holy blood, i swear eternal faith to arthur, king.}
<A>__{they embrace, and merlin watches.}
