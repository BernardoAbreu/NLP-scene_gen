<A>__{a gray and ugly, post revolution building with a sign above the door that identifies it: "young comrades without parents".}
<L>__{interior orphanage day}
<A>__{children of all ages clean the cold, gray dormitory. their clothes are ragged and they look underfed.}
<B>__{close on}
<A>__{anya, 18, pretty despite the boy's hand me down clothes she is forced to wear, is busy scrubbing the floor. unlike the others, she is determined not to let her surroundings get to her. she hums a tune. the door suddenly slams open and gregor, 8, and clearly terrified, comes running in followed by comrade phlegmenkof a huge woman carrying a switch.}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{anya! anya!}
<A>__{all of the other kids turn away, not wanting to get involved. anya focuses on gregor, who is shivering with fright and on the verge of tears as phlegmenkof approaches, swinging the switch menacingly.}
<C>__{phlegmenkof}
<D>__{you can't get away from me now . . .}
<A>__{phlegmenkof advances on gregor. anya takes the scrub brush and shoves it across the floor, right under phlegmenkof's unsuspecting foot. phlegmenkof's feet fly out from under her and she smashes to the floor. gregor hops over her huge body and runs to anya for safety. some of the other kids glance over. a chubby girl and a very pretty little girl, look at anya with greeat admiration . . . someof the others think she's crazy. phlegmenkof rises, covered with soap bubbles , and spins on anya who gives her a very innocent smile.}
<C>__{phlegmenkof }
<D>__{you! you did this!}
<A>__{some of the other children laugh as soap bubbles fly off the enraged woman. she spins on them, her back to anya.}
<C>__{phlegmenkof }
<D>__{brats! there'll be no supper for any of you! back to work!}
<A>__{anya, behind phlegmenkof, mimics her outraged face and angry gestures perfectly as the children laugh harder. phlegmenkof spins and almost catches anya. she advances on anya as gregor hides behind her legs.}
<C>__{anya}
<D>__{don't touch him.}
<C>__{phlegmenkof}
<P>__{(to anya)}
<D>__{you ragged, skinny, little nothing! i have had just about enough of you . . .}
<A>__{phlegmenkof raises her hand to slap anya, who hold her ground. suddenly, phlegmenkof sniffs the air.}
<B>__{on the kids}
<A>__{as the horrible smell reaches them too. they all make faces and hold their noses.}
<B>__{on phlegmenkof}
<A>__{who first sniffs under her raised arm, then realized the cause of the stench . . .}
<C>__{phlegmenkof }
<D>__{comrade serebreakov!}
<A>__{she tries to straighten herself out nervously this must be someone very important. comrade serebreakov stands in the doorway, lecherously eyeing the girls. he is a huge, fleshly man with facial features which are reminiscent of a fish.}
<C>__{phlegmenkof }
<P>__{(flirting)}
<D>__{comrade serebreakov! what a lovely surprise! what brings you here?}
<C>__{serebreakov}
<D>__{i need. . . a worker.}
<A>__{his eye catches anya. he looks her up and down, his beady eyes showing a touch of lust for her.}
<C>__{serebreakov }
<D>__{i will take her.}
<A>__{he leans close close to anya.}
<C>__{serebreakov }
<D>__{tomorrow you begin your life's work in my hearing factory. you'll start by cutting off the tails but if i'm pleased with}
<C>__{serebreakov }
<D>__{you you just may move up to cutting off the heads. how does that sound?}
<C>__{anya}
<D>__{about as bad as you smell!}
<A>__{phlegmenkof moves between them, pulling serebreakov away.}
<C>__{phlegmenkof}
<D>__{no, no, comrade you don't want her . . .}
<C>__{serebreakov}
<D>__{i want her.}
<C>__{phlegmenkof}
<D>__{that's horrible, skinny thing?! she's crazy she has no memory of anything before she came here! she didn't even know her name! that one is a rotten troublemaker, willful. . .}
<C>__{serebreakov}
<D>__{i will break her will. . .}
<P>__{(to anya)}
<D>__{i shall come for you tomorrow at dawn.}
<P>__{(he touches her face as she pulls away)}
<D>__{you will enjoy serving under me.}
<A>__{smiling in anticipation, he exit.}
<C>__{phlegmenkof}
<D>__{i couldn't break you but he can!}
<A>__{and she turns to leave in a huff. anya does one more imitation of her, making the children laugh. but as anya turns away from her audience, we see her facade fade and realize her terror of the future.}
