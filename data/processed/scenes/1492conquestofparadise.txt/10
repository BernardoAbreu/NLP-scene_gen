<L>__{interior a huge library la rabida day}
<A>__{hundreds of books lined up on the shelves, displaying the miracle of printing, a recent german discovery. several monks, perched on high stools behind lecterns, are busily "illuminating" some of these massive volumes, delicately painting around the letters in bright colors and gold leaf. rays of light fall diagonally through high openings, projecting geometric patterns on the tiled floor. as marchena and columbus move forward their conversation is punctuated by light and shadow.}
<C>__{marchena}
<P>__{(fumbles in a pocket under his robe)}
<D>__{i have something for you.}
<A>__{almost casually, he hands columbus a letter.}
<C>__{marchena}
<D>__{you will be heard at the university of salamanca...}
<A>__{columbus stops dead in his tracks. almost frantically he tears open the letter, hardly able to believe his eyes.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{god... that's in a week!}
<C>__{marchena}
<D>__{that's what it says.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{how did you manage it?}
<C>__{marchena}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{with some difficulty. i had to promise them you were not a total fool.}
<A>__{marchena pushes open a second door, hidden behind a wooden panel.}
