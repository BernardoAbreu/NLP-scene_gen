<B>__{the guest conductor}
<A>__{whose back is to the audience, leading the orchestra in a truly magnificent performance of tchaikovsky's fifth symphony inside the hollywood bowl. the guest conductor waves his baton wildly. passionately. brilliantly. getting the absolute best from the members of the orchestra. the musicians exhilarate in the challenge of being pushed to their musical limit. as the guest conductor turns to the next page of his sheet music on the podium, you notice seven small, high frequency sensors above an upcoming musical measure. the sensors are wired together. when the seven notes are played in sequence, an electrical pulse will be triggered down the wires which run down the side of the podium, beneath the stage.}
<B>__{beneath the stage}
<A>__{the wires connect to several crates of c4 positioned beneath the orchestra. these seven notes will be the last notes these musicians ever play.}
