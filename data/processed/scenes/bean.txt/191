<A>__{the door opens, and bean emerges, pushing what appears to be a trolley covered with a white cloth. although, if you look carefully, this trolley actually has no legs. it is the painting covered with the table cloth. to make it a bit more convincing, bean makes an apt squeaky noise. he proceeds along the thin corridor and then sees another exactly similar trolley coming right towards him.' a problem. as they get close, bean suddenly pretends he sees something astonishing behind the on coming man.}

<A>__{when the man turns, bean just twists his painting sideways and shoots past him. we see the face of the deeply perplexed trolley pusher when he looks back and bean is no longer there. he turns round to bean, who turns back to him with a totally blank and innocent look. bean sees an elevator and heads for it.}
