<D>__{take care, you two. may the force be with you.}
<A>__{luke looks down at his hand. a metalized type of bandage has been wrapped around his wrist. the medical droid makes some adjustments in a tiny electronic unit, then pricks each one of luke's fingers.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{ow!}
<A>__{luke wriggles his fingers, makes a fist, and relaxes it. his hand is completely functional. he gets up and walks over to leia. there is a new bond between them, a new understanding. leia is thinking about han; luke is thinking about his uncertain and newly complicated future. together they stand at the large window of the medical center looking out on the rebel star cruiser and a dense, luminous galaxy swirling in space. luke puts his arm around leia. the droids stand next to them, and threepio moves closer to artoo putting his arm on him. the group watches as the millennium falcon moves into view, makes a turn, and zooms away into space.}
