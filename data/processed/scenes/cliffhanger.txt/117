<L>__{exterior helicopter}
<A>__{travers flies the copter up and over, until he and it are five feet away from gabe's position on the spur. gabe is buffeted by the copter's wind, but stands firm. travers levels his gun at gabe through the open passenger door as gabe heaves the pack in. travers doesn't even look down he just stares at gabe with hate as he prepares to shoot.}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{don't you want to count it?}
<A>__{puzzled, travers takes his gun hand and rips open}
<B>__{the pack}
<A>__{the $5000s are there but they've been shredded by qualen's earlier blast of gunfire. few, if any, of the bills are passable.}
<B>__{travers}
<A>__{stares down, incredulous as he does }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{rips open a perforated section of parka and yanks his bolt gun from his waist travers looks up and raises his gun at gabe but gabe fires first the bolt imbeds itself high in travers' chest. gasping, travers drops his gun it falls over the pack and out the open door travers clutches at his chest }
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{don't spend it all in one place, you son of a bitch.}
<A>__{travers falls back in his seat and loses control of the helicopter it spins around, and gabe has to instantly flatten to avoid the tail when it swings at him gabe looks down as }
<B>__{the helicopter}
<A>__{quickly begins to spiral down in wide, aimless circles travers has clearly lost control }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{stares down coldly, waiting for the crash but inside the copter travers won't give up sweating, bleeding, he sits forward and grabs the stick, seizing control of the helicopter again gabe's pov the helicopter stops its uncontrolled descent and begins to rise up and up with clear purpose }
<B>__{close on gabe}
<A>__{eyes widening with realization. gabe gets up from the spur and starts running back towards the woods several hundred yards from safety before he can get very far }
<B>__{the helicopter}
<A>__{tops the precipice edge and, sweeping low over the snow, it gets between gabe and the trees, cutting him off wooded area hal and maggie watch, powerless }
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{he's going to run gabe down }
<B>__{travers in helicopter}
<A>__{ashen, hyperventilating, he's running on pure adrenalin and fury as he drives the stick forward travers pov gabe is stiff legging it toward the edge of the mountain but he's too banged up to run fast through the thick snow }
<B>__{the helicopter}
<A>__{with its skids skipping just over the snow overtakes }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{as he throws himself flat into the snow the front of the skid misses gabe by inches as it blasts over him }
<B>__{the helicopter}
<A>__{moves out over the precipice edge travers banks it wide to circle back around for another run }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{gets back up as the helicopter swings back behind him }
<B>__{in a wooded area}
<A>__{hal rips the lining out of one of his pockets and stuffs it into one of the ammo clips maggie stays back as he runs for all he's worth out into the clearing }
<B>__{the helicopter}
<A>__{has circled back around, stopping at a hover far back in the clearing travers intends to not just run gabe over, but to run him off the edge as well }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{lumbers as fast as he can towards the edge }
<B>__{travers}
<A>__{knows he has gabe nailed he shoves the stick forward }
<B>__{the helicopter}
<A>__{flies forward, skids just inches over the snow }
<B>__{hal}
<A>__{runs out to where travers is heading he lights the cloth in the ammo clip as}
<B>__{the helicopter}
<A>__{flies past}
<B>__{in the clearing}
<A>__{hal hurls the clip, with its cloth "fuse" burning down, into the doorless side of the copter }
<B>__{inside the helicopter}
<A>__{ the makeshift bomb bounces to the floor of the cockpit travers sees it and looks down, but the "fuse" sputters out nothing but glowing embers in the cloth }
<B>__{travers}
<A>__{smiles nothing to worry about he speeds ahead close on the helicopter's skids as they slice through the top of the snow towards }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{as he runs toward the mountain's edge it's just a couple of feet ahead, but the copter is a couple of feet behind as the copter overtakes gabe, dipping even lower into the snow, he dives off the edge following gabe falling gabe is at the ladder he falls the first twenty feet of the long drop, then grabs a rung on the cable ladder, very painfully stopping his fall but in the same split second }
<B>__{the helicopter}
<A>__{skid meant to impale gabe catches the top two rungs of the cable ladder wide shot the helicopter caught in the rungs of the cable ladder, the helicopter keeps flying out over the abyss, but as it pulls the cable ladder, it pops out the bolts that hold the ladder in place, rung by rung still going full tilt, the copter strains against the ladder thirty feet of it tethers the copter to the wall and gabe is dangling from the center of it. on the ladder gabe has one arm hooked around a rung, hanging on for his life as the copter thrashes the ladder up and down }
<B>__{inside the copter}
<A>__{travers is disoriented by the jolt, and tries to maintain control he doesn't see that the cloth fuse on the ammo clip has reignited it burns down to the clip, and fifty rounds explode like a string of firecrackers travers tries to shield himself as he is struck by airborne lead. shrapnel blasts into the instrument panel }
<B>__{the helicopter}
<A>__{still strains against the cable ladder but the engine goes dead the rotor blades slow }
<B>__{gabe on ladder}
<A>__{gabe stares in horror at the stalling rotor if it were possible for him to grip the ladder tighter, he'd do it now }
<B>__{on the helicopter}
<A>__{ as the rotor whops to a dead halt the copter arcs down and slams against the mountain wall the skids are still caught in the ladder, and it holds }
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{is shaken off by the massive impact he falls landing on the helicopter, half in and half out of the cockpit! as gabe scrambles for a solid hold }
