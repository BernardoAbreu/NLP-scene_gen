<A>__{erica turns, wiping tears.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{are you crying?}
<P>__{(joining her)}
<D>__{i didn't know you did that.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{yeah, it's my new thing. i've gotten abnormally great at it.}
<C>__{marin}
<P>__{(sitting on the step with her)}
<D>__{is it harry?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{seems i gotta learn how to do that love 'em and leave 'em stuff.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{fucking men. you don't care when i say fuck, do you?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{not really. sometimes. not right now.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{so now you get my theory about love? you gotta self protect. it's too dangerous.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{marin, that theory... how can i put this so your feelings won't get hurt. it's just so crazy, it makes me want to screammmmmmmmmmm!!!!}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{and how would you put it if you wanted to hurt my feelings?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{listen to me... you cannot hide from love for the rest of your life because maybe it won't work out and maybe you'll become unglued. that's not a way to live.}
<C>__{marin}
<D>__{so you're telling me you're happy right now? this is good what happened to you?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{no. this was bad. but for the three days it was good, it was electrifying.}
<A>__{marin's eyes fill up.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{i think you must consider the possibility that we are more alike than you realize. i let someone in and i had the time of my life.}
<C>__{marin}
<P>__{(tearful)}
<D>__{i've never had the time of my life.}
<C>__{erica}
