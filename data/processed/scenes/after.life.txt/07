<L>__{int exterior anna's car morning}
<A>__{anna drives past the strip malls of a small suburban town in a green toyota. on the dashboard a kitschy bobblehead doll nods its head from side to side. anna pulls up to a red light. glances across at the other cars. we see the vacant faces of commuters staring blankly into space. the light changes. anna hasn't noticed. the car behind her honks in frustration. she quickly pulls out... ... just as a suv turns in front of her. she slams on her brakes. hard. missing the suv by inches. the driver screams at her. his face contorted in ugly rage.}
