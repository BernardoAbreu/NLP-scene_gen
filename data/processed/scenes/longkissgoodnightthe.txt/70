<L>__{exterior street belfast night}
<A>__{the boy's name is gregory. sixteen, with a quick, easy grin. huddled beneath a tree with him, the girl is gelatin.}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{you've never made it with a boy, then?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{there's nothing odd about it. i'm only sixteen.}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{rubbish.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{you're fourteen and not a day more. here now, i'm right, you're blushing.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{look, what if i'm ignorant? it's my father, we never stay in one place, i never meet bloody anyone.}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{saw him on the telly. think he'd kill me? i'm a nasty one, i am.}
<A>__{he slides a hand under her sweater. she stiffens, terrified and exhilarated, as he gently strokes her nipple with a thumb.}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{you know what, i will bet you've never even kissed a boy... now, have you?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{aye, but you want to...}
<A>__{he leans in. she leans forward. a jerky, tentative duckling on the road to swan dom. their lips touch. across the road, the windows blow out in her father's flat. she spins, scream caught in her throat as armed men rush from the house. through the door, the one she left unlocked. stutter of small arms fire. she whirls on gregory, realizes only then that the guy is laughing.}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{thanks for shutting off the alarm, you bloody papist bitch.}
<A>__{he slaps her full across the face.}
<C>__{gregory}
<D>__{tell the press the ulster force claims full credit.}
<A>__{he spins and flees.}
