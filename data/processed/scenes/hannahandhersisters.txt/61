<L>__{interior hannah's bedroom night}
<A>__{hannah, wearing a plaid shirt, sits up in bed, a book propped up on her knees. a cupboard with some bric a brac is mounted behind the night table, which holds a small, white, warm glowing lamp and some photographs. she turns the page as elliot, in pajamas and silk bathrobe, enters. she continues to read her book as he sits down at the edge of the bed and muses. his voice is heard over the screen.}
<C>__{elliot }
<D>__{what passion today with lee. she's a volcano. it was a totally fulfilling experience... just as i dreamed it would be.}
<P>__{(nodding slightly as he takes off his slippers)}
<D>__{that's what it was. it was like living out a dream...a great dream.}
<P>__{(taking off his bathrobe)}
<D>__{now i feel very good and cozy being here next to hannah. there's something very lovely and real about hannah.}
<P>__{(tossing his bathrobe}
<D>__{aside and lying down on the bed next to hannah, his hands}
<P>__{crossed over his stomach)}
<D>__{she gives me a very deep feeling of being part of something. she's a wonderful woman...and i betrayed her. she came into my empty life and changed it...and i paid her back by banging her sister in a hotel room. god, i'm despicable. what a cruel and shallow thing to do.}
<P>__{(sitting up)}
<D>__{i have to call her now and tell her what we did was crazy.}
<P>__{(anxiously)}
<D>__{it can't ever happen again. i'm not that kind of man...and i value hannah too much. i love my wife. now i've betrayed her. oh, god!}
<A>__{elliot frantically stands up and leaves the room.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(reading, not looking up)}
<D>__{where're you going?}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{i've, uh...gotta find, gotta get a phone number in my desk. i forgot to phone mel kaufman.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(still reading)}
<D>__{it's so late.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{yeah, i know. i i can't believe i forgot.}
<A>__{elliot walks quickly into the darkened hallway.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(muttering)}
<D>__{what if he answers?}
<P>__{(turning into the}
<D>__{doorway leading to}
<P>__{the living room)}
<D>__{i will hang up.}
<P>__{(walking into the darkened living room)}
<D>__{i will tell her we can't communicate until i terminate my marriage.}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{it's immoral.}
<A>__{elliot switches on the light. he paces back and forth in front of the piano and an accompanying music stand. the top of the piano is filled with family photos; the lamp he turned on illuminates some framed pictures on the wall and the piece of sheet music open on the piano.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(gesturing and whispering)}
<D>__{then, time will pass. i won't call, and she'll get the idea. i gotta stop this before i get in too deep. i'd rather hurt lee a little, than destroy hannah.}
<A>__{elliot stops pacing and checks his wristwatch.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(whispering, rubbing his hands)}
<D>__{it's one thirty. she...she can't have a conversation with me...with him around. i'm getting hysterical.}
<P>__{(putting his hands on his hips)}
<D>__{i will call her first thing in the morning. i will call her at six.}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{frederick goes jogging at six, yeah, she'll be alone. and i will, i will call her and nip it in the bud.}
<A>__{the phone rings. elliot jumps.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(loudly, to the offscreen hannah, gasping)}
<D>__{i've got it! i've got it! i've got it!}
<P>__{(picking up the phone, into the telephone)}
<D>__{hello?}
<P>__{(loudly, for the offscreen hannah's benefit)}
<D>__{mel!}
<A>__{the movie cuts to lee, standing in the dark in frederick's loft. she talks softly into the telephone.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(into the telephone)}
<D>__{i would have hung up if you hadn't answered and i promise i won't ever do this again, but i just had to tell you, i feel very close to you tonight. very, very close.}
<P>__{(pausing)}
<D>__{good night.}
<A>__{lee hangs up the phone and the movie cuts back to elliot, standing in his living room. stunned, he slowly lowers the phone receiver.}
