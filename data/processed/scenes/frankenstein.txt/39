<L>__{int waldman's home workshop night}
<A>__{the gaslights come up with a soft hiss. the first thing victor and henry notice is an artist's nook situated adjacent to big windows where the light would be best during the day. easels are lined with in progress work on a variety of subjects, everything from landscapes to anatomical studies, all quite excellent. the rest of the place is a laboratory crammed floor to rafter with arcane equipment. taking off his coat and rolling up his sleeves, waldman leads victor and henry down rows of tables crammed with experiments and clutter.}
<C>__{waldman}
<D>__{you know for thousands of years the chinese have based their medical science on the belief that the human body is a chemical engine run by electricity? they say we all contain streams of energy which flow through us like currents in the ocean, or rivers in the earth.}
<A>__{they arrive at a table. waldman roots through a tray of knickknacks, holds up an acupuncture needle.}
<C>__{waldman}
<D>__{their doctors treat patients by inserting needles like these into the flesh at various key points to manipulate these electric streams.}
<A>__{he directs their attention to an ancient chinese silk on the wall. it depicts the human body from front and side angles. acupuncture points are clearly marked.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{preposterous.}
<C>__{waldman}
<D>__{i once saw it done, as a boy in canton. my parents were missionaries. the cure was nothing short of miraculous.}
<P>__{(off their looks)}
<D>__{i've never forgotten it. been fascinated ever since.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{it smacks of magic.}
<A>__{waldman slides forth a steel pan and uncovers it to reveal an enormous dead toad in dissection. copper mounting pins trail wires to a small panel of switches. the switches, in turn, are connected to a series of galvanic batteries. waldman starts throwing switches. victor and henry jump as the toad convulses with motion. they watch, stunned, as waldman puts the toad through its paces: legs kick, feet flex, mouth opens and closes, lungs breathe.}
<C>__{waldman}
<D>__{magic. seems alive, doesn't it?}
<A>__{waldman shuts the thing down, strips off his gloves, his arm at the array of wires and batteries.}
<C>__{waldman}
<D>__{electricity.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{it's utterly fantastic! this is the sort of thing i'm talking about! we should be learning this!}
<C>__{waldman}
<D>__{why? god alone knows what it means. until it has proven value, it's nothing more than a ghoulish parlor trick. hardly fit for the classroom.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{but the possibilities. combining ancient knowledge with new? something like this could change our fundamental views!}
<C>__{waldman}
<D>__{it is a thrilling direction to explore. thrilling and dangerous.}
<P>__{(off his look)}
<D>__{nature can be wonderful and terrible. science is not a realm for the reckless; it needs a conscience. we must proceed cautiously. assess as we go.}
<P>__{(drapes the toad)}
<D>__{what i do on my own time is my own business. the same holds true for you. you wish to expand your mind? fine, do so. you can even join me here, if you like. but not at the expense of your normal studies.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{i doubt that decision is still mine to make.}
<C>__{waldman}
<P>__{(waves)}
<D>__{nonsense. tonight you will draft an apology to professor krempe...}
<A>__{victor starts to object, but waldman overrides him with a stern gesture for silence. listen.}
<C>__{waldman}
<D>__{"...a sincere and heartfelt apology which you will then read aloud to him before the assembled student body and faculty.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{waldman}
<P>__{(draws close)}
<D>__{our profession needs talent like yours. destroy your career over an issue of pride? what a waste.}
<A>__{waldman hands him the acupuncture needle. a gift. victor studies it, fascinated.}
<C>__{waldman}
<D>__{go home, victor. write the letter,}
