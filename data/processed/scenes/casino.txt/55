<L>__{interior ginger's apartment day}
<A>__{ginger enters the room with $25,000 in her hands. she taps lester diamond's leg with it and he turns to her.}
<C>__{ace }
<D>__{but one thing i could never understand, was that she could have everything under control, except for her old pimp boyfriend, lester diamond.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{look, gin, you know i got other people in this. i got partners. but i want you to understand that i am lookin' out for you in this thing. okay? you're going to get yours back... and you're gonna get it back first. okay?}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{all right.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{okay?}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{where are you goin'? where are you? you're in that place. where are you?}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{i'm here.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{no, you're not. where are you? where are you?}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{i'm always here for you.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{you are.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{i am.}
<A>__{he hastily kisses ginger and slips out the door.}
<C>__{ace }
<D>__{the ginger i knew wouldn't even look at this creep.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{good luck.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{ace }
<D>__{he was a moocher, a card cheat, a country club golf hustler. a scumbag... chasing dentists for a few bucks.}
<C>__{ginger}
<D>__{careful.}
<A>__{ginger looks out of the window and sees lester get into a convertible and drive off.}
<C>__{ace }
<D>__{i mean, the guy was always broke, he always had a story. and somehow, she could never turn him down. the way ginger saw it, i guess, was that lester was just an unlucky guy. somebody had to take care of him.}
