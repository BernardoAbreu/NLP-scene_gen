<L>__{exterior rodney's wunderland dark woods night}
<A>__{we hear intense struggling and laughter. by the sounds we hear, we gather that jimmy and judy are being dragged off into the woods against their will by buddy and rodney's bigger guys, but it's too dark to tell if that is what in fact is happening. someone unidentified is running the show and operates the camera. it's impossible to see, but it's definitely buddy's voice.}
<C>__{buddy }
<D>__{here, here, here. right here.}
<A>__{judy is screaming and crying.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{jimmy!}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{judy?}
<A>__{two or three guys, it's too dark to tell, start laughing.}
<C>__{judy }
<P>__{(screams)}
<D>__{please somebody help us!}
<A>__{jimmy grunts, trying to break free.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{judy!}
<P>__{rodney's big guy #1 (o.c.)}
<D>__{shut up, asshole! you wanna fucking talk!}
<A>__{munch. somewhere in the darkness jimmy's been kicked in the gut. the camera hits the ground. it lands right in front of jimmy. we can still barely see what's going on, but we're close enough and there's enough flashes of light from flashlights to see that jimmy is face down and bloody.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<P>__{(defiant)}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<A>__{jimmy gets kicked again just once. then suddenly, a barrage of kicks come at jimmy one after the other after the other. leaves and grass and dirt and flying feet shoot at jimmy's face as he is kicked and beaten repeatedly. the process goes on for about thirty excruciating seconds. we can't tell how much damage has been sustained, but jimmy's not moving. he's either unconscious or dead. with one last kick, the camera is knocked aside and we don't see jimmy's face anymore.}
<P>__{rodney's big guy #1 (o.c.)}
<D>__{is he fucking dead?}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{jimmy! jimmy say something!}
<A>__{they mock her in a high pitched wining voice.}
<C>__{buddy }
<P>__{(mocking)}
<D>__{jimmy. jimmy say something.}
<P>__{rodney's big guy #2 (o.c.)}
<D>__{get her clothes off.}
<C>__{judy }
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{noooooo! noooooo!}
<A>__{judy screams at the top of her lungs over and over again as we hear them tearing at her clothes. then they pick her up and start pulling her away from camera. her screams get quieter and quieter... fainter and fainter.}
<C>__{judy }
<P>__{(extremely faint)}
<D>__{jimmy!}
<A>__{finally there's silence. the camera isn't moving. it's on the ground and in the dark. camera shuts down.}
