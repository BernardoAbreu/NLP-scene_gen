<A>__{a short time later, ryan cruises through a venice neighborhood. ryan drives an early 70's ford bronco; clothes are strewn across the backseat, and a box of "heal the bay" t shirts now sits on the shotgun seat. ryan reaches into the glove box and pulls out a toothbrush. he sips warm soda from a bottle and begins brushing. checking himself out in the mirror, he sniffs his pits, whoa, and grabs the cellphone.}

<A>__{the cellphone begins to crackle with static just as ryan drives under an overpass. suddenly the car ahead of him stops in the middle of the street. ryan notices too late and has to jam on the brakes. the car skids, he screams... and comes to a stop an inch before hitting the other car's bumper. he lifts the phone receiver to his ear but the call is washed}
