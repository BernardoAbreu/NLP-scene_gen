<L>__{interior men's room night}
<A>__{the urinals are twisted in bizarre shapes. pipes are exposed and spout water. the mirrors look like something out of a funhouse. peter hears the stretcher go by. peter goes to the door of ock's lab and cracks it. pan up to the spider, glowing softly, dangling from a shimmering strand above peter. as peter looks out at the stretcher, the spider drops on his neck. he reacts by swatting it away. bad move. the glowing spider now squats malevolently on the back of peter's hand. he stares at it transfixed. it bites.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{ow!!!}
<A>__{peter throws the spider to the ripply tile floor where it scuttles unsteadily out the door. sweat starts to bead on peter's face. he shakes his head to clear it. his vision becomes uncertain. he lurches against a weird sink. peter's pov is not just uncertain, not just fuzzy, not just moving in and out anamorphically. it's all of that!}

<D>__{hey! what are you doing here, kid?}
<A>__{peter turns to see a uniformed guard distorted by his crazy vision.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i feel a little funny...}
<C>__{guard}
<P>__{(heavily distorted)}
<D>__{yeah? well, i ain't laughing. get out... just get out of here...}
