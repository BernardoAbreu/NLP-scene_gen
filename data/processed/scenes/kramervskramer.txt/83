<B>__{on ted}
<A>__{he sits on one of the playground benches, the work he took from the office stacked beside him on the bench. sitting next to him is a personable looking man of about ted's age. he is nattily dressed in a suit complete with vest, tie and polished gucci loafers. we will call him the saturday father. note: the saturday father and his daughter (a pretty young girl of about ten) will appear from time to time throughout the film. he is a divorced father, putting in his time, not giving a shit about the child. the saturday father insists on treating ted as though they were members of the same secret fraternity. and he comes to represent ted's nightmare of what might happen to him.}
