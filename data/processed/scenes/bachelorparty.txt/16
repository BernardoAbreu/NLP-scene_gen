<C>__{rick}
<D>__{hey, chulo, where are you, man?}
<A>__{angle late model car we see a very large pair of shoes sticking out from under the chassis. slowly, a large, bear like body rolls out and we catch our first glimpse of chulo. a happy go lucky mechanic of mexican ancestry.}
<C>__{chulo}
<D>__{hey, you guys, what's going on?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{we're going for a little liquid refreshment.}
<C>__{chulo}
<D>__{great. i will go with you. wait a second. hey, raul! move that car, will you?}
<A>__{a small mechanic with an eye patch gets into a car behind them as we dolly with the guys through the lot.}
<C>__{chulo}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{roberto, you finished fixing that lighter yet?}
<A>__{another mechanic sticks his face out of another car and shakes his head. just then raul, the eye patched worker, whizzes by behind the guys, driving the car in a zig zag pattern right into traffic.}
<C>__{chulo}
<P>__{(continuing; to rick)}
<D>__{i'm glad you guys came by... what's the occasion?}
<C>__{o'neill}
<D>__{rick's got an important announcement to make.}
<C>__{chulo}
<D>__{yeah. what is it?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{i've decided not to run for president.}
<C>__{chulo}
<D>__{too bad, man, that blows my chance to be ambassador to france.}
<A>__{behind them we can see roberto fiddling with the lighter. suddenly flames leap out of the car, blowing roberto ten feet into the air.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{the guys all start to pile into the bus. nearby another employee is washing down the garage with a hose. chulo turns to another mechanic, who has his head under the hood of a car.}
<C>__{chulo}
<D>__{manuel, be sure and finish up the electrical system on that chevy.}
<A>__{manuel waves at chulo, who turns, hops on the bus. rick starts it up and starts to drive away. just as the bus clears frame, we see manuel connect two wires together at the same moment the guy with the hose washes down the area around his feet. manuel lights up like a christmas tree, screaming in pain. there is a beat, and then robert falls into frame, still holding the cigarette lighter, and the car raul is driving enters the lot and smashes into the side of the garage.}
