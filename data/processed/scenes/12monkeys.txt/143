<L>__{exterior bus stop downtown late afternoon}
<A>__{a city bus disgorges a stream of passengers at a stop in the toney downtown shopping district. among them, railly looks furtively left and right, cole on her heels. she's hidden her bruised eye behind sun glasses; he's holding a bloody handkerchief to his mouth. as he steps to the sidewalk, cole is overwhelmed by the bustling city, the tall downtown buildings. his eyes go up. cole's pov: a building, towering toward the sky. a building with a ledge. the same ledge the lion prowled in the future!!! angle on cole, shaken, as railly ushers him into the recessed entrance to a store.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{wait here. i'm going to try that phone number. let's hope it's nothing!}
<A>__{dazed by his experience and the flow of shoppers, cole watches her hurry to a pay phone twenty yards away, his view of her made intermittent by pedestrians streaming past him, their faces looming frighteningly close. a businessman jostles cole, forcing him back against the display window. turning, he faces the angry jaws of a bear only inches away recovering from a jolt of terror, cole realizes the bear is a life size toy in the display window. relieved, he looks back at railly. cole's pov: railly, well out of earshot, speaking earnestly into the phone. angle on cole, startled, as a businessman, mistaking him for a panhandler, shoves a dollar into his hand. confused, cole stares at the dollar, then turns to say something to the retreating businessman, but just then he sees railly rushing toward him, eyes sparkling with happiness, laughing, ebullient.}

<D>__{james! james! it's okay. we're insane! we're crazy!}
<A>__{cole doesn't know how to respond, but a passerby gives them a look.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{it's a carpet cleaning company...}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{a carpet cleaning company?}
<C>__{railly}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{no superiors! no scientists. no people from the future. it's just a carpet cleaning company. they have voice mail you leave a message telling them when you want your carpet cleaned.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{you... you left them a message?}
<C>__{railly}
<P>__{(impishly)}
<D>__{i couldn't resist. i was so relieved. wait'll they hear this nutty woman telling them...they better watch out for the army of the twelve monkeys...}
<A>__{looking at her laughing face, cole is struck with horror as he realizes the truth! he starts to recite...}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{"the army of the twelve monkeys they're the ones who are going to do it. i can't do anything more. the police are watching me."}
<A>__{now she's stunned. she glances back and sees the phone booth twenty yards away.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{you... you couldn't have heard me.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{they got your message, kathryn. they played it for me. it was a bad recording...distorted. i didn't recognize your voice.}
<A>__{railly's eyes fill with horror as she grasps the meaning. angle on a uniformed cop, staring out the window of a police cruiser as it inches along in the bumper to bumper traffic. noticing something, he reaches for his radio. angle on railly, spotting the cruiser, grabbing cole, pulling him into the crowd.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{come on.}
