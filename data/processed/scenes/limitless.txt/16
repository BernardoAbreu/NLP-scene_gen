<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{who's the husband?}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{what are you, jealous?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{it's just a question, vern.}
<A>__{vernon can sense his emotion.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{walked out on her, if you really want to know. but what do you care? you guys weren't even married six months, were you ? i mean, it was just a coke thing, right?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{is that what she said ?! "a coke thing."}
<A>__{it unexpectedly hurts eddie. maybe it's just a bummer day. or there's a deeper wound than he knew.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{but i wanna know about this book. how's it going?}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(considering the question)}
<D>__{how's it going... well... i'm behind. i'm behind on my book, and it's pretty well polluting my days and nights if you really want to know.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{how much have you written of it?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{not one fucking word, vern.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{wow. creative problem, huh?}
<A>__{vern appraises him.}
<C>__{vernon }
<D>__{i think i have something that can help you.}
<A>__{he reaches into his pocket. eddie thinks he knows what's coming.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{oh, no no, no, no }
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{you don't even know what it is.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you're still dealing.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{no yeah will you listen?! this isn't recreational. i've been doing some consulting for a pharmaceutical company }
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you mean a lab in some little yalie's basement? give me a }
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{no, this is an exclusive product coming on stream next year, they've had clinical trials, and it's fda approved.}
<A>__{a long beat. eddie bites.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{okay, what is it?}
<A>__{vern reaches into his jacket, produces a tiny plastic sachet with his right hand, tapping something out into the palm of his left. he holds this up for eddie to see... a tiny white}
<B>__{unmarked tablet.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{what's in it?}
<A>__{vern puts the little white tablet on the bar.}
<C>__{vern}
<D>__{just take it. get you over the hump.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i'm too old for this, vernon.}
<C>__{vernon}
<D>__{look, they've identified these receptors in the brain that activate specific circuits, and you know how they say you can only access like 20 percent of your brain? well, what this does }
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{vernon. look at me. do i look good? i smoke too much: my chest is sore. a fucking corpse has more energy than i do, i've got weird aches, possible lumps, rashes, maybe they're a condition, or a network of conditions. one of these days they're all going to hold hands, light up, and i will keel over dead. my life's in the crapper, and i don't think it's going to take a sudden upswing into the stratosphere if i do some brand new, shiny designer drug!}
<A>__{vern's phone rings. he holds up his index finger shh! and takes the call.}
<C>__{vern}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{gant.}
<P>__{(beat, getting agitated)}
<D>__{when. i know, but when?}
<P>__{(looking at his watch)}
<D>__{tell him we can't do that. he knows that's out of the question. we absolutely can't do that.}
<A>__{vern is edgy. very tense. he continues:}
<C>__{vern }
<D>__{no, i'm not going to tell him! you tell him no, now!}
<A>__{he turns off his phone, gets up.}
<C>__{vern }
<D>__{fucking people. i'm afraid i'm going to have to leave you here, eddie. but let's hang out again, have another beer.}
<A>__{he takes out his business card, and places it carefully next to the little white tablet on the bench.}
<C>__{vern }
<D>__{by the way, that's on the house.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i don't want it, vern.}
<A>__{vern smiles at him.}
<C>__{vern}
<D>__{don't be ungrateful, now. you know how much these things cost?}
<A>__{eddie shakes his head.}
<C>__{vern }
<D>__{eight hundred bucks a pop.}
<A>__{he pats eddie on the shoulder and goes. eddie is still looking at the pill. which seems to be looking back at him.}
