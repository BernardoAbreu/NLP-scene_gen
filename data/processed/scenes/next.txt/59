<L>__{interior cabin bathroom night}
<A>__{liz listens, dubious, as cris crouches beneath the window sill, scribbling a note on a scrap of paper.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{a few steps on, your robe will get caught on a thornbush. you won't be able to get unstuck. ferris and a tough guy will come help you. she'll say, "you've done your country a great service."}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{and then?}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{be unpredictable. surprise works to my advantage. and read this when you're safe.}
<A>__{he tucks the note into her robe pocket.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{will i see you again?}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{bet on it.}
<A>__{she gathers her courage and steps to the open window. stakeout site everyone is coiled, waiting for ferris to give the word. cavanaugh is on the radio with his men, ready to pass it on. ferris takes a last look through the nightvision binoculars. that's when liz climbs awkwardly out of the bathroom window in her bathrobe.}
<D>__{ferris she's coming now.}
<P>__{(to cavanaugh)}
<D>__{we stay put. tell them.}
<C>__{cavanaugh}
<P>__{(disappointed, via radio)}
<D>__{we stand pat till notified. don't make a sound.}
<A>__{when liz is out of the cabin, ferris activates the remote control.}
<B>__{all around the cabin}
<A>__{doors lock and bars slide into place almost inaudibly. stakeout site ferris shines a flashlight toward liz, on off. she heads in the general direction of the light, but stops behind a thick trunked oak tree, which blocks her from their view. behind the oak tree cris backs out from under liz's robe. stakeout site ferris, cavanaugh, baines, and rick shine their flashlights on the oak tree, waiting for liz to reappear.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{what's she waiting for?}
<A>__{liz steps into view from behind the oak tree. ferris shines the light towards her again. she heads straight toward them.}
<B>__{on liz}
<A>__{as predicted, the hem of her robe gets caught in the thorns. she tries to pull free, but she's stuck. stakeout site ferris and baines wade into the thicket to extricate her. among the thorns ferris and baines reach liz.}
<D>__{ferris you've done your country a great service.}
<A>__{the predicted words hit her hard.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{then why do i feel like a traitor?}
<A>__{ferris and baines free her and lead her up the hill.}
<B>__{behind the oak tree}
<A>__{cris scurries away, using the sound of their rustling to cover his escape. exterior forest night cris scurries near a trio of state troopers. he steps on a twig which snaps loudly. pan back to find a second cris approaching down the same path. cris 1 dissolves as cris 2 steps around the twig and continues undetected. a few steps on, cris 2 slips on mud and slides noisily down a slope. pan back to find cris 3, who detours onto stepping stones then rejoins the original path, undetected.}
<B>__{stakeout site}
<A>__{baines and ferris help liz back to their camp.}
<D>__{ferris rick, get her some coffee.}
<A>__{liz pulls the note from her robe pocket and reads cris' handwriting: "then why do i feel like a traitor?"}
<C>__{cavanaugh}
<P>__{(relays a message)}
<D>__{we've got movement in the canyon.}
<P>__{(to radio)}
<D>__{where are you?}
<A>__{a flashlight shines up at cavanaugh from the canyon. ferris and baines scan their infra red scopes at the area. ferris' infrared pov: a hot human shape hurries over rough terrain with stealthy urgency.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{ferris and baines looking through their scopes.}
<D>__{baines she told him.}
<C>__{cavanaugh}
<D>__{we tried it your way. ferris go for it. but i want him alive.}
<A>__{cavanaugh picks up the radio with evident satisfaction.}
<C>__{cavanaugh}
<D>__{boys, now it's our turn.}
<A>__{fifty searchlights blaze on and stab through the forest.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{i want him alive. tell them. cavanaugh}
<P>__{(afterthought, to radio)}
<D>__{and the feds want him alive.}
<A>__{ferris urgently takes baines aside.}
<D>__{ferris we need to get to him first.}
<B>__{troopers}
<A>__{spread out through the steep terrain. searchlight beams sweep over the landscape.}
<B>__{cris}
<A>__{moves erratically, presciently, in bursts, dodging the streaking spots of glare. stakeout site liz is drinking coffee next to rick's police car. ferris approaches, coldly knowing.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{you've made a very stupid mistake.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{i trust him more than i trust you. ferris i wouldn't swallow the "i love you" part.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{you've never even met him.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{but i've profiled him for months. and i can tell you this: he doesn't love anybody. how could he? to him, we're not even human.}
<C>__{ferris }
<D>__{we're the characters in a videogame, and he's the player with the joystick. we say our lines, and he practices his moves until we do what he wants.}
<B>__{in the forest}
<A>__{cris on foot, running over rough terrain. state troopers converging. searchlight beams crisscrossing. a cone of light passes over cris. comes back. finds him.}
<D>__{trooper there! i got him!}
<A>__{he finds himself face to face with two troopers, guns aimed straight at him.}
<D>__{trooper 1 stop!}
<A>__{cris tumbles, draws fire, serpentines through the woods, feinting, freezing, unhittable moving closer.}
<D>__{trooper 2 take better aim!}
<C>__{trooper 1}
<D>__{i'm trying!}
<A>__{cris is within fighting distance. chop to an arm. punch to diaphragm. cris is now holding trooper 1's six shot revolver. trooper 1 runs. cris does not fire after him. instead, he takes aim at a searchlight at a great distance. squints. then fires and scores a direct hit with the first shot. turns to a second search light. squints. squeezes off a second shot. the lamp shatters. exterior stakeout site night baines and ferris watch as, around the mountain, gunshots sound and searchlights go dark.}
<D>__{baines you might be right about this guy.}
<C>__{ferris}
<P>__{(shakes her head)}
<D>__{i underestimated him.}
<A>__{the searchlight next to her shatters.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{by a lot.}
<B>__{the hunt}
<A>__{cris gets pinned down behind a tree. a trooper keeps firing, trying to drive him from hiding. cris boldly comes out from cover and runs, giving the trooper a clear shot. but the trooper runs out of ammo at just that moment.}
<D>__{trooper shit!}
<A>__{stakeout site watching through binoculars, speaking into radio.}
<D>__{ferris be thorough, gentlemen. if you leave a way out, he'll find it.}
<B>__{elsewhere in forest}
<A>__{baines' well trained mp's have set up a triangulated trap. they operate like skilled special forces commandos. one of them signals, fingers to eyes, that he has spotted cris. cris enters a clearing and continues straight into the trap! the team leader prepares to give the signal to shoot. cris' movement flushes a stag from the hiding. it knocks over one mp and causes another to miss his shot. the leader sees the stag and scans around for cris. camera repositions to reveal that the stag now stands between cris and the leader. the leader shoots the stag, killing him, but not before cris dashes to cover in another stand of trees. two mp's fire at cris. but shoot each other.}
<D>__{team leader}
<P>__{(to radio)}
<D>__{i've got two men down. friendly fire.}
<A>__{stakeout site ferris, discouraged, comes to a tough decision.}
<C>__{ferris}
<P>__{(to radio and baines)}
<D>__{change of plans, everybody.}
<C>__{ferris }
<D>__{try to kill him. use everything you've got.}
<C>__{cavanaugh }
<D>__{is this a joke?}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{no, it's an order. baines don't get emotional here.}
<A>__{she wants baines to understand.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{there's only one way to beat this man. he's got to see his own death, and not just maybe. he's got to see himself die again and again and know it's inescapable. and then, maybe, he'll surrender. baines and if he doesn't?}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{that'll be his choice. and he was no use to us anyway.}
<B>__{in the forest}
<A>__{cris is suddenly the target of a turkey shoot. he hops around like a mountain goat while bullets ching off rocks and splinter trees. he stays alive, but only by a hair's breadth. cris finds himself pinned down by four troopers. he rushes trooper one, who fires, and hits cris solidly in the chest.}
<D>__{snapback to:}
<A>__{cris rushes the position of trooper two. before he gets there, cris gets shot in the gut.}
