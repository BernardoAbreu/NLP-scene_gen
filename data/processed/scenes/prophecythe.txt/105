<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{john the bus driver lying fully dressed on his bed asleep. the night breeze through the window, and maybe something else, tickles his nose. his eyes open, blink, turn left, right, then up, and see gabriel perched on the headboard, staring down at him.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{heavy sleeper, john.}
<A>__{john's eyes open wide in shock. gabriel's skin is blackened and blistered in parts. whole shards of his shirt are missing. john tries to sit up but gabriel forces his head back down with his palm. with the ease of a spider he slides down and beside john.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{don't don't hurt me, man. my wallet's in the dresser.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{don't be such a materialist, john.}
<P>__{(sees empty bourbon}
<D>__{bottle on dresser,}
<P>__{sighs)}
<D>__{no end to your bad habits.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{a moment of your time.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you ought to have that nose looked at, man.}
<A>__{gabriel leans said nose in very close and whispers,}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{where are they, john? katherine and mary? where would they go?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what? mary? i don't know.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{sure you do. think hard.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no, really. i don't know. the school maybe.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{now you're not even trying, john. you're katherine's best friend. she tells you everything.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i'm just the driver, y'know?}
<A>__{gabriel extends a blistered, open palm over john's face.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i can help you remember, john...}
<B>__{from the other side of the room}
<A>__{we see gabriel leaning over john as a sickly yellow glow begins to rise and reflect off the walls. beneath it comes john's worst and deepest screams...}
