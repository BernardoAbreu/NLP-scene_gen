<D>__{kirill and ozim are talking confidentially in a mix of russian and turkish whispers at a table. ozim's wife is at a table alone, well out of their earshot, smoking a cigarette and peeling glazed figs. as anna walks by, ozim and kirill stop talking. the scene has a much darker mood to the bustling scene in the kitchen, but for now anna feels no unease. as she passes, kirill surveys her with a deadly smile and a professional eye.}

<D>__{no, thanks. i'm driving. as anna smiles, ozim mumbles something in turkish and kirill shushes him.}

<D>__{ok. merry christmas. drive safely. ozim giggles. anna departs.}
