<A>__{he boogies down. the sphinx is bewitched, awed by the car's magnificent power. but then mirror man screams ! with pure terror. for, at his feet, wrapped around his legs, is a boa constrictor some 8 feet long... a mass of heavilykeeled scales shimmering on coiled muscle ... mirror man screams on and on... the sphinx swerves wildly... racing through a red light. barely missing an on coming bus ... passing a pair of cops coming out of a 7 11. they hop into their unit. give chase.}
