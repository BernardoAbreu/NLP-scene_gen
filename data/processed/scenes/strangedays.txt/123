<A>__{on zander, face lighting up, giving lenny a high five. lenny drops his bag, shakes, does a little silly hand choreography a goof on a bro grip that makes zander laugh. mace watches this ritual and smiles herself. zander can call out a part of lenny that mace would like to see more of. cecile is there, hanging out with her boyfriend curtis, and curtis' friend vej. these two guys are about 18, dressed in gangsta garb. they are listening to "the prophets of rage" on a cd player, and watch lenny with a dispassion that flirts with distaste.}

<D>__{what do you got?}

<D>__{lenny, have you lost it completely?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{easy, there, mom. easy. this is audio only.}
<P>__{(hands tape to zander)}
<D>__{john coltrane. "a love supreme." give it a listen, let me know what you think, maybe you won't go for it now, but it'll get in your head and grow like a seed into something really beautiful.}
<C>__{zander}
<D>__{let's play it now!}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{later. your mom'n i are heading right back out.}
<A>__{groans of outrage and protestations of unfairness from cecile, vej and curtis follow this bad news. cecile even musters the gumption to speak up.}
<C>__{cecile}
<D>__{hey, come on, i been baby sitting a full 24 hours, i have to get ready for the party tonight...}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{cecile.}
<A>__{mace frosts her with a look. you don't mess with mace.}
<C>__{mace}
<P>__{(to a disappointed zander)}
<D>__{you're not the only little boy i have to look out for, honey.}
<A>__{zander nods: ok. lenny gives him the grip. zander's hand outmaneuvers his, and the boy smiles in triumph.}
