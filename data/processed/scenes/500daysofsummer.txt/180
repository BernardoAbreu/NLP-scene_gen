<A>__{tom walks over and sits down on a bench. he stares off, lost in thought. and then, from out of nowhere, there's her voice.}
<C>__{summer }
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{summer sits like an apparition on a neighboring bench. she may have just sat down, she may have been there for hours. tom isn't sure if she's real. he doesn't quite know what to do.}
<C>__{summer}

<A>__{the mention of their past makes the atmosphere frosty.}
<C>__{tom}
