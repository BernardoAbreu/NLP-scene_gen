<L>__{exterior alpine track day}
<A>__{jack turns off the main road and onto an alpine track. this is the same route he took with the belgian woman. the car bumps and tilts on the rough terrain.}
<L>__{interior car continuous}
<A>__{clara is startled by such an insignificant track.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{where are we going?}
<A>__{now she's anxious. this is not what she expected.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you shall see.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{i think it is good we should stay close to the road.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{there's no need to worry. i've been here before several times. taking photographs.}
<A>__{he swings the wheel suddenly to avoid a large boulder and the citroen pitches as if struck by a wave. clara clings to the door with her right hand, her left hand dug deep into the fabric of the seat to steady herself.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you're not afraid of coming into the wild with me, are you?}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{she laughs tensely.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{of course i am not. not with you. but this...}
<A>__{she snaps her fingers.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{...sentiero!}
<A>__{she waves her hand in the air.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{you should have a jeep. a toyota. it is not good for a... berlina.}
<A>__{it's as if the increased danger of the track diminishes her english.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{this is a citroen!}
<A>__{he strikes the steering wheel hard with the palm of his hand.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{this was made by the french for taking potatoes to market. besides, i always come here in this car.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{you sure?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{of course. i don't want to walk back to town any more than you do.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{i think you are crazy. this will go to nowhere.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i assure you it does.}
<A>__{she pouts her reply. the track disappears into a wood and runs out altogether, giving way to grass.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{now there is no road!}
<A>__{jack stops the car and turns the engines off. sudden silence. clara lets go of the seat.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{is this where we go?}
<A>__{they are surrounded by trees.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no. not quite. we go another hundred metres, through the wood. but from here we just roll forward. no motor. no sound. and you'll see a wonder.}
<A>__{she grips the seat again.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you won't need to hold on. i will go slowly. just relax and look.}
<A>__{he eases his foot off the brake and the car begins to move forward, the springs squeaking slightly. after 50 metres jack twists the steering wheel slightly and applies the brakes. they roll gradually down to the outer edge of the woods and come to a stop beneath a familiarly squat but ample walnut}
<B>__{tree.}
<A>__{beyond them is the lake, the meadows and the ruined hamlet. the hidden valley is a riot of colour, the blooms and blossoms more brilliant than we've ever seen them. by the edge of the lake stands a heron, still as fence post. clara gets out of the car, dumbstruck. jack gets out too. he watches her... then swiftly checks the ruined hamlet through his miniature binoculars. deserted. by the time clara turns towards him, the binoculars are hidden.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{no one comes here?}
<A>__{she speaks so quietly jack can barely hear her.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{just you.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{clara turns away, unbuttons her blouse and drops it on the grass. she is wearing no bra. on her back dapple the shadows and patches of sun eking through the branches of the walnut. she kicks off her shoes, which curve through the air... and unzips her skirt. it falls to the grass. she bends and steps daintily from her knickers. then turns to face jack. jack cannot take his eyes off her. dizzy, he steps forward without meaning to.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{well?}
<A>__{she is coquettish and tosses her auburn hair to one side.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{i am going to swim in the lake. are you coming?}
<A>__{she doesn't wait for his reply, but turns and runs through the grass towards the water.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{there are vipers! vipera! marasso!}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{maybe! but i am lucky!}
<A>__{the heron flies off, rising from the reeds with an ungainly flapping.}
<C>__{clara}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{he is an italian bird! we disturb his siesta!}
<A>__{quickly, jack glances inside the citroen. the red purse is nowhere to be seen.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{come, signor farfalla!}
<A>__{jack undresses. as he removes his clothes, he stalls for time, using the cover of undressing to search for the red}
<B>__{purse.}
<A>__{we can see it wedged under the passenger seat. due to the design of the car, jack cannot.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{come!}
<A>__{jack turns to face the lake. he is naked. yet with the caution of years he does not remove his shoes until he reaches the water's edge. clara is standing in the middle.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{stand by me.}
<A>__{he obeys her order. he walks out to her and she takes his hand under the water, holding it out in front of them. jack spots it resting on the smooth stone of the lake bed. brassy and gleaming. a spent shell. he covers it with his foot.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{keep still. watch.}
<A>__{as the ripples of his arrival peter out in the reeds, tiny fish appear in a shoal to gather about their hands. they hover like slivers of glass just under the surface then move in to nibble at the skin on their fingers.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{if we stay here for a year, they'll devour us.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{it is said that if these fishes bite at two hands holding, then love is good for the people.}
<A>__{he looks at her and for a moment he forgets the awful plan in his head. she kisses him, pressing herself against him, her skin and body as pure and warm as the water. he tries helplessly to pull away.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{maybe we should...}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{do you make love in the water?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i haven't.}
<A>__{she places her arms around his neck and raises her feet from the smooth stones, wrapping her legs around his waist. she tries to push herself onto him but he resists.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<A>__{he doesn't know what to say. she looks at him: confused, searching.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{let's eat.}
<A>__{he walks towards the bank. she follows. the tiny fish dart around them for a few moments then flee for the reeds, travelling with the waves made by their departure.}
