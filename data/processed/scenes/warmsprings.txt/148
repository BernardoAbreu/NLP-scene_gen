<A>__{dark and deserted roy is carrying franklin down a flight of stairs. louis is hastily checking over his shoulder. if possible, eleanor appears even more nervous than louis.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{you're being superstitious, louis. there aren't any reporters here.}
<A>__{suddenly out of the darkness a flashbulb pops revealing a dozen or more reporters staring incomprehensibly at the sight of a six foot, 200 lb. man being carried like a baby in the arms of a black man. no one does or says a thing. the photographer who had the wherewithal to snap the one picture raises his camera to take another. but dan reed, a reporter for the new york herald tribune and a gentle giant at over six foot four, reaches out and places a massive hand over the lens. slowly, but firmly, he pulls the camera down.}

<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{louis and eleanor stand stock still, tense, watching the scene unfold roy is sweating; his arms growing weak. elliot brings the chair around and roy gently lowers franklin into it. it's a measure of reed's standing with this group that his authority is unquestioned. but the photographer raises his camera again. only now reed isn't as kind. he grabs the camera from him and opens the back, pulling out the film and exposing it.}
