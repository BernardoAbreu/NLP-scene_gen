<C>__{rudy}
<P>__{(still polite)}
<D>__{get rid of that nail polish, i don't like it, and when i tell you to come over here you move fast. you and i are going to get along because i've known a lot of people like you, so don't tell me about it because i got your ticket going in. now get up and get that paint of your fingers... okay?}
