<L>__{interior bug city the royal court day carmen}
<A>__{sees hundred of bugs at work, warriors, workers and dozens of small (2 meters) chariot bugs. aworker walks pas, stepping on her, but pays her no attention. she sees the source of the screaming: captain deladier is hold between two warriors, and she's screaming because of what she sees,}
<C>__{deladier}
<D>__{naaaaaaaa...! oh please...}
