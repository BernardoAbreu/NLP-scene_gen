<L>__{exterior pie shop day}
<A>__{they emerge from the pie shop. she begins to scale the exterior staircase to the darkened second floor room. he hesitates.}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{come along...}
<A>__{she continues up, he slowly follows.}
<L>__{interior barber shop day}
<A>__{a macabre shroud of dust and spider's webs. furniture covered in sheets. a broken mirror on one wall. we hear footsteps approaching and then mrs. lovett enters. the door creaks like a living thing.}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{not to worry, a touch of oil will put that right.}
<P>__{(she turns back to todd)}
<D>__{... nothing to be afraid of, love, come in.}
<A>__{she moves into the room. but todd hesitates at the door, looking into the room. for him this is a truly haunted place. meanwhile, she kneels and pries loose a floorboard. underneath there is a hidden area. within that, something covered with a velvet cloth. she removes it and carefully unwraps it. her touch is particularly gentle and respectful. we discover it is a fine leather case. she looks at it for a beat. then turns to him, dusting it off.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i don't believe it...}
<A>__{he finally steps into the room, drawn toward the case.}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{when they came for the girl, i hid 'em. i thought, who knows? maybe the silly blighter'll be back again. cracked in the head, wasn't i?}
<A>__{haunting music begins as she opens the case... and we see it contains a beautiful set of razors. he stands for a long moment, gazing down at his beloved razors.}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{those handles is chased silver, ain't they?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{silver, yes... these are my friends, see how they glisten.}
<P>__{(he picks up a small razor)}
<D>__{see this one shine, how he smiles in the light. my friend, my faithful friend.}
<P>__{(holding it to his ear,}
<D>__{feeling the edge with his thumb) ) speak to me friend, whisper, i will listen.}
<P>__{(listening)}
<D>__{i know, i know you've been locked out of sight all these years like me, my friend. well, i've come home to find you waiting. home, and we're together, and we'll do wonders, won't we?}
<A>__{mrs. lovett leans over him, in her own kind of trance as well. they now sing simultaneously:}
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(picking out a larger razor)}
<D>__{you there, my friend, come, let me hold you. now, with a sigh you grow warm in my hand, my friend, my clever friend.}
<P>__{(putting it back)}
<D>__{rest now, my friends. soon i will unfold you. soon you'll know splendors you never have dreamed all your days }
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{i'm your friend too, mr. todd. if you only knew, mr. todd ooh, mr. todd, you're warm in my hand. you've come home. always had a fondness for you, i did.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{ my lucky friends. till now your shine was merely silver. friends, you shall drip rubies, you'll soon drip precious rubies...}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{never you fear, mr. todd, you can move in here, mr. todd. splendors you never have dreamed all your days will be yours. i'm your friend. and you're mine. don't they shine beautiful? silver's good enough for me, mr. t...}
<A>__{the music continues quietly as todd stares at one of his razors.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{leave me now...}
<A>__{she goes. todd finally picks up his biggest razor and slowly opens it, looks at it.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{at last my arm is complete again.}
<A>__{and he remains standing. exalted. then in the shattered mirror on the wall he suddenly sees the distorted reflections of the gentleman, the banker, and the general, looking at him }
<C>__{ghosts}
<D>__{lift your razor high, sweeney! hear it singing, "yes!" sink it in the rosy skin of righteousness!}
<A>__{todd turns to them...}
<C>__{ghosts}
<P>__{(variously)}
<D>__{his voice was soft, his manner mild. he seldom laughed but he often smiled, he'd seen how civilized men behave. he never forgot and he never forgave, not sweeney, not sweeney todd, the demon barber of fleet street.}
<A>__{todd pulls a sheet off baby johanna's cradle. a cloud of dust rises. the ghosts disappear in the cloud of dust and todd stands alone, staring at the cradle, holding his razor.}
