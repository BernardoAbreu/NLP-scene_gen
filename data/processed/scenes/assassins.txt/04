<L>__{interior hotel suite night}
<A>__{the room is dark and still. a man is standing at a wall of windows that glow from the amber wash of urban light. snow is falling, heavy white flakes glittering in the city's electric night. the man finishes his bourbon, ice clinking in the empty glass. he is slightly drunk and he sways forward until his forehead rests against the window. in the dim light, we recognize the man as rath. outside there is a beautiful stone church decorated for christmas. he watches the snowflakes drift to the distant street below. he is wondering what it would feel like to let himself fall, when there is a knock at the door. crossing the room, he opens the door. backlit by the bright hallway light is a woman. she has already removed her coat and though she is only a silhouette we can see that her dress is very short and very tight.}
<C>__{escort }
<D>__{hi. did you call }
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{yes. please come in.}
<A>__{her high heels tap against the tile foyer as she enters and he takes her coat.}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{goodness, it's so dark...}
<A>__{she reaches for the wall switch but he stops her.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i prefer it like this.}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{how can a beautiful man like you be shy?}
<A>__{he smiles.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i prefer it, that's all.}
<A>__{she moves closer to him, the sexual confidence of her body radiating like heat.}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{it's okay, honey. we can do it anyway you want.}
<A>__{rath is obviously uncomfortable.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{would you like a drink?}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{i'd love one. whatever you're having.}
<A>__{they move into the room, from a distance, as featureless as two shadows. she stands at the windows watching the snow bubble of a city night.}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{beautiful.}
<A>__{he hands her the drink. her smile is bright and perfect.}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{good will towards men.}
<A>__{their glasses clink as he drains half his drink. if she drinks at all, we can not tell.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{why are you working today?}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{holidays are our busiest days. no one likes to be alone on holidays. i know i don't.}
<A>__{she touches his face, the caress and her expression of tenderness seemingly genuine.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{you're very good at this aren't you?}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{i think you're supposed to answer that question.}
<A>__{her hand slides down his chest, but before it goes any farther rath turns away, returning to the bar.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i know what you expect, but i don't want...}
<A>__{he pours himself another drink.}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{that's okay, hon, i always expect the unexpected.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i called because i just want... i need to talk.}
<A>__{she sits on the couch, her body language changing, as she becomes a listener.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i've been thinking about my life, about things i have done... what i do for a living is in some ways similiar to what you do.}
<A>__{he sits on the other end of the couch, his words thickened by the alcohol.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i know that everything has a price. i want you to understand that i'm willing to pay.}
<A>__{he takes out an envelope and puts it between them. she picks it up, glancing inside at a stack of hundred dollar bills.}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{honesty.}
<A>__{she puts the envelope down.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{i just want to ask you some questions.}
<A>__{uncomfortable, she waits as he searches his drink for the right words.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{do you ever regret things you've done?}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{everyone regrets something.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{but when you finlsh a job, afterwards do you think about them?}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{sometimes.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{do you think about their wives or their families?}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{no. they call me, i don't call them. if they didn't call i wouldn't exist.}
<A>__{rath nods. his next question is barely audible.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{do you ever think about starting over?}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{all the time.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{can you tell me about it?}
<A>__{for the first time we really see her take a drink. she closes her eyes.}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{sometimes i dream that i meet a man, this good, honest man and we fall in love. i imagine us living on a boat, reading books, sailing to places where no one knows who we were or cares what we did.}
<A>__{she opens her eyes and looks at him.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{and what if you never meet that man?}
<A>__{she smiles.}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{then, i will sail alone.}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{do you believe that?}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{are you asking me if i believe in another life?}
<A>__{rath nods.}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{i have to.}
<A>__{she finishes her drink.}
<C>__{escort}
<D>__{is that all you want?}
<C>__{rath}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{she picks up the money and stands.}
<C>__{rath}

<C>__{escort}
<D>__{anytime.}
