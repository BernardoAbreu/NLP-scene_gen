<L>__{int exterior toilet. night.}
<A>__{jamal peers through one of the many cracks in the shack. he sees crowds surging around the pier, charging towards a landing helicopter. salim shoves the chair under the door handle effectively locking it and runs down the pier to join the chase. jamal pulls up his shorts.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{no! wait! salim, sala! salim!}
<A>__{rattles the locked door. pulls a torn flyer from his pocket advertising an amitabh movie.}
<C>__{jamal }
<D>__{wait! amitabh....}
<A>__{he looks down the toilet hole at the sewage beneath him, the landing helicopter, the disappearing crowd. a final rattle of the door. there is only one way out. he jumps down the hole, sprawling headlong into a year's worth of human waste, managing to keep the flyer out the mire. he runs for the helicopter.}
<C>__{jamal }
<D>__{amitabh ji! amitabh ji!}
<A>__{salim is at the back of the crowd, trying to force a way through, but the adults shove him back. not so for jamal. the down draft from the helicopter flicks bits of sewage from his clothes. disgusted fans curse him and get out of his way. suddenly, the red sea parts and there is nobody between jamal and amitabh bacchan getting out of the helicopter.}
<C>__{jamal }
<D>__{please. amitabh ji.}
<A>__{jamal holds out his flyer. used to signing autographs, the movie star barely looks at jamal. he takes the flyer and scribbles his autograph on it.}
<C>__{jamal }
<D>__{a thousand thanks, amitabh ji.}
<A>__{he hands the flyer back to jamal as his bodyguards surround him and hustle him into a car. jamal chases the flyer across the tarmac, grabs it. kisses it.}
