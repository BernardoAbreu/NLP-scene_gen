<L>__{exterior paradise day}
<A>__{elena and kristen lay side by side on loungers, soaking in the sun, when a voice rouses them...}
<C>__{jay }
<D>__{poor detective morrison. it's hard to do that to a friend. especially one going through such a nasty divorce.}
<A>__{they look up to see jay, standing before them in a pair of colorful shorts, no shirt, sipping at a martini...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{told me he'd never trust another woman as long as he lived. and then along came a spider...}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{a black widow.}
<A>__{jay glances at elena, as he downs the last drops from his drink.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{more like widows... gotta say i was a little taken aback when you wanted to snuff marie, but you know what, i'm over the bitch...}
<A>__{elena suddenly gets to her feet.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{you want me to top you off?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{that'd be fine, just fine.}
<A>__{he hands elena his empty glass, then kisses kristen tenderly. when they break...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{she's got a good head on her shoulders.}
<A>__{kristen doesn't reply. just smiles, watches elena over by the outside bar, mixing jay's drink...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{you two got me out of a mountain of shit, i will tell you that. craziest goddamn scheme i've ever heard of. but hell, you played it perfectly.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{my job was easy. it was elena who had to keep it all together...}
<C>__{elena }
<D>__{we've had some practice along the way...}
<A>__{jay turns around, smiles at elena as she holds out his drink.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{here you go, mr. clifford.}
<A>__{jay takes it from her appreciatively, sips at it as he sidles off to the swimming pool.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{well, all that nasty business, it's behind us. forever. from here on out, it's the good life.}
<A>__{he starts to climb the high dive. when he gets to the top, he looks down at elena and kristen, smiles.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{you two look so good, it's difficult to tell which one's the mother and which one's the daughter...}
<A>__{kristen calls back up at him.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{that's just the roofies talking...}
<A>__{says it so sweetly, it takes a moment for jay to register the sinister implications...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<A>__{his eyes are blood shot. he starts to sway atop the high dive.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{delta chi, class of '88. hellova party. i'd never really tasted cocktails like that.}
<A>__{jay's swaying uneasily on the high dive platform...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i don't...whattya talking about?}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{it was like being awake though an operation. i could feel everything happening, but i couldn't do anything to stop it...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{oh...shit...}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{you took something from me that night. but you left something behind...}
<A>__{jay's head is spinning as he looks to kristen, to elena.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{your daughter...}
<A>__{he can't quite get his mind around it. everything's becoming blurry.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i don't remember...}
<A>__{he looks at the martini glass, thinks he sees blue residue, before it slips from his fingers, falls 20 feet to the concrete below, shattering into a million pieces like so many fake diamonds... elena and kristen stand side by side below him.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{you may not remember...}
<A>__{a broad grin stretches across elena's lips as she finishes...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{...but you'll never forget.}
<A>__{jay tries to take a step forward. he stumbles. tries in vain to regain his balance. it's too late. he falls. 20 feet to the unyielding concrete, exploding like a paper bag filled with vegetable soup...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{nice take off. gotta work on the landing.}
<A>__{they stand back, watching jay's pancaked body draining its precious blood into the ice blue pool...}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{let's go get our money.}
<A>__{they gather the diamonds, walk away as the pool turns crimson red...}
<B>__{the end}
<A>__{as the credits roll....}
