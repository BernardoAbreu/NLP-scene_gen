<L>__{interior christian house, adjoining room night}
<A>__{silence. mrs. christian sits waiting, troubled. the door to the dining room opens and welles enters from the dark, visibly shaken. mrs. christian watches him, her sorrow now shared.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{you... you need to go to the police.}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{i told you i can't, not yet.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{you don't have any other choice.}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<P>__{(stands, shakes her head)}
<D>__{no. for me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, i need know that whoever did this will be punished. if you can find them, i will take their names to the police. i will say my husband confessed on his death bed. i will say i didn't have courage to come forward at first...}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{it won't work like that.}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously. i've thought about it and there's no other way. if you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well i can't let that happen. i'm telling you i won't. if there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then i will just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.}
<A>__{welles sits, rests his head in his hands.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i deal in divorce cases. corporate investigations...}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{you've found missing persons before.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{nothing remotely like this.}
<C>__{mrs christian}
<D>__{i know what i'm asking. your compensation will be appropriate to the risk. you'll need cash to buy information, and i will provide it.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i feel responsible, mr. welles.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you saw what he did to her.}
<A>__{welles stands, torn apart and uncertain, looks back to the dining room where the projector sits idle.}
