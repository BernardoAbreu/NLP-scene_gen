<D>__{well... now we have to herd that thing up here.}
<C>__{hunter}
<P>__{(nervously)}
<D>__{whoever's doing the herding is gonna have their hands pretty full. i think somebody should stay by the lifeboat to slam the door on the thing once it's inside, and to serve as... as...}

<C>__{roby}
<D>__{isn't "bait" the word you used?}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{hey look, somebody has to have his hands free to lock the creature in the lifeboat!}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{yes, and maybe launch the boat and blow it too... if the others are injured.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{who gets the privilege?}
<A>__{insert: three crumpled pieces of paper. three hands pick them up. angle on roby. he unfolds his paper, turns it so the others can see it. it has a big x on it. another angle shortly later. hunter is showing roby a small device like a transistor radio.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{just keep your finger off the button till she's way away from the ship, that's all.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{is it armed?}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{if you press the button right now, it will blow the whole nose of the ship off.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{thanks for the thought.}

<D>__{all right, martin, we'll be in touch with you on the communicator.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{and you'll let me know when you've got it coming this way...}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{and you stand aside while we drive it in, then shut the hatch, launch the boat, and }

<D>__{kablooey.}
<A>__{hunter's face twitches nervously at this.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{come on; we haven't much time, air is a factor.}
<A>__{they leave the nose of the ship, standard carrying the flamethrower, hunter the tracker. roby settles himself at the controls, runs through them briefly to familiarize himself. using a switch, he opens and closes the lifeboat door a couple of times. it slams open and shut quite rapidly. he presses a few buttons and sets the launch button to "ready." then standard's voice comes from the communicator:}
<C>__{standard}
<P>__{(over, filtered)}
<D>__{we've got something on the tracker... got to be it, it's too big for the cat.}
<A>__{this is a very spooky scene, roby alone by the lifeboat, listening to}
<B>__{the voices on the communicator.}
<C>__{hunter}
<P>__{(over, filtered)}
<D>__{it's coming from down there.}
<A>__{roby hears various tinny sound effects, rustlings, clunkings, breathing, etc.}
