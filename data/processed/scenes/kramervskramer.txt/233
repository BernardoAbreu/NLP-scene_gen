<A>__{it is a bleak winter's day. the camera tracks with them as they walk along, ted carrying a bag of groceries, thelma with cleaning. the children run around them, playing.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{you heard anything yet?}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}

<C>__{thelma}
<P>__{(can't help grinning)}
<D>__{oh, god... ted, i am really scared.}
<A>__{they walk in silence for a beat, then ted looks off screen, spots something:}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{the saturday father, restless, bored, walking with his daughter who is also bored. it is clear that they have nothing to say to one another. he looks around, spots ted, waves and starts in his direction.}
<B>__{closeup ted}
<A>__{he reacts as though he has seen a vision of his own death.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(to thelma, urgent)}
