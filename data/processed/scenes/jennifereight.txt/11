<L>__{11: exterior working face. infill. garbage dump. day.}
<A>__{a series of terraces have been created as the canyon fills up. black smoke drifts from a distance at will of the wind. gulls and bulldozers. plus a stinking ten foot cliff of human filth. several cars parked here including the blue mercedes. several on lookers behind yellow police tape. ross negotiates it look ing pissed off. looks up and somewhere in the smoke is berlin.}
