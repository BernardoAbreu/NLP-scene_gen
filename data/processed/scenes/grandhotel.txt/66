<A>__{flash of preysing's room from her angle. preysing stretched on bed flat, his stomach a mountain and on it the magazine that he has been reading with flaemmchen's picture. he is looking at the ceiling. she knows he is awake because a thin stream of smoke comes from his cigar in his hand.}
<B>__{flash of flaemmchen}
<A>__{an idea occurs to her. she could possibly sneak into bed and he would go to sleep and there would be nothing that night. camera follows her as she tiptoes to her room. she closes the door noiselessly and listens. she throws off her hat and takes off her coat. opens her bag and takes out night dress, lingerie, etc. the lid of her bag falls suddenly. she starts at the noise. "has it awakened him." she looks off.}
<B>__{shot at bathroom door}
<A>__{the thin stream of light is filled suddenly, the door of the adjoining room opens and back lighted from the other room the huge form of preysing appears. in this odd lighting he is a little more than preysing. he comes forward. he speaks hoarsely, quietly.}
<C>__{preysing}
<D>__{flaemmchen!}
<P>__{(he seizes her to him)}
<A>__{she goes to his arms passively. he rubs his face in her hair. she is passive cold.}
<C>__{preysing}
<P>__{(breathlessly)}
<D>__{you are late. i've been waiting for you waiting.}
<C>__{flaemmchen}
<D>__{i had to arrange about the trip.}
<C>__{preysing}
<D>__{you're sweet.}
<C>__{flaemmchen}
<D>__{you think so?}
<A>__{he holds her again, trying to kiss her. she deliberately avoids his kiss.}
<C>__{preysing}
<P>__{(awkwardly)}
<D>__{come here.}
<P>__{(he sits heavily on}
<D>__{the bed, sitting on}
<P>__{her night dress.)}
<C>__{flaemmchen}
<D>__{here, hold up!}
<A>__{preysing rises while she pulls her night dress from under him. he draws her to him.}
<C>__{flaemmchen}
<D>__{oh careful, mr. preysing.}
<C>__{preysing}
<D>__{call me do you know would you would you like to call me by my first name?}
<C>__{flaemmchen}
<P>__{(pulling away, glad}
<D>__{of an excuse for}
<P>__{conversation)}
<D>__{oh, no.}
<C>__{preysing}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{flaemmchen}
<D>__{i couldn't do that, you're a stranger to me.}
<C>__{preysing}
<D>__{you're a funny little creature, flaemmchen. i can't make you out.}
<C>__{flaemmchen}
<D>__{it's not funny at all. one can't get intimate just off hand. i could go to england with you and everything like that supposing i met you next year and i said: 'how do you do, mr. preysing! and you said:}
<P>__{(she imitates him)}
<D>__{'that was the young lady who was my secretary in manchester'.}
<A>__{preysing laughs. she laughs.}
<C>__{flaemmchen}
<D>__{that's all quite proper.}
<P>__{(she is happy again.}
<D>__{she would rather}
<P>__{talk than be squeezed)}
<D>__{but supposing i met you when you were with your wife and i called out: "hello you big baby remember manchester?' and you with your wife, how would you like that?}
<A>__{there is a pause for a moment.}
<C>__{preysing}
<D>__{please, flaemmchen we'll leave my wife out of this.}
<A>__{flaemmchen yawns straight in his face.}
<C>__{flaemmchen}
<D>__{all right. i will get undressed get out.}
<A>__{he moves towards the windows which are open. she pushes his fat body out, almost playfully, through the doors and onto the balcony. preysing stands out on the balcony. he looks down in the street below, then off. he starts suddenly because he sees a shadow over the railing of his own balcony. he is puzzled. shadow crosses again. "who can be in his room?" he moves forward and peeps through the window. one side of the french window is closed. from his angle we see the baron furtively searching the room. he is now wearing an overcoat, the collar is turned up. business ad lib. he finds preysing's wallet. he stuffs this in his overcoat pocket. preysing's face watching him. as baron turns to exit, preysing surges forward, pulling the window after him. the two men face each other.}
<C>__{preysing}
<D>__{aha! the baron. what do you want here?}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{i must have made a mistake.}
<C>__{preysing}
<D>__{made a mistake remarkable. we shall soon see if you made a mistake.}
<P>__{(the baron starts to leave.) (bellowing)}
<D>__{stay here... give me that money.}
<A>__{the baron hands him the pocketbook without a word.}
<C>__{preysing}
<D>__{so that's how we stand, baron.}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{look here, sir i'm completely at your mercy i'm desperate it's a matter of life or death i had to get some money tonight.}
<C>__{preysing}
<D>__{indeed you must, baron you must. humm humm, but you must go to jail, baron, you're a thief.}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{be quiet.}
<C>__{preysing}
<D>__{i'm going to call the police. i'm going to watch you play the great baron with the police. aristocrat! aristocrat!}
<P>__{(he picks up the telephone)}
<A>__{the baron makes for the door on the other side of the room, pulls at the knob.}
<C>__{preysing}
<D>__{the door is locked, baron.}
<A>__{the baron makes one dive across the room. preysing grasps at his coat and tears it. with one hand holding the telephone, (the receiver dropping on its cord towards the ground) and one hand holding the baron.}
<C>__{preysing}
<P>__{(into telephone)}
<D>__{hello! hello! }
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{don't do that.}
<P>__{(he tries to snatch}
<D>__{the telephone from}
<P>__{preysing.)}
<A>__{preysing wrenches the telephone suddenly away from the baron. the action excites him.}
<C>__{preysing}
<D>__{strike me, would you? attack me would you? attack me }
<A>__{with a terrific lunge, preysing brings the telephone down upon the baron's head. the baron sways, stunned. (as in book). in his mad rage, preysing, hits again with the telephone.}
<C>__{preysing}
<D>__{i will strike you i will strike you i will strike you strike me!}
<A>__{by this time the baron is a heap on the floor. we see preysing come out of his blind trance. he even repeats again.}
<C>__{preysing}
<D>__{i strike you }
<P>__{(with telephone}
<D>__{foolishly in his hand, he looks down}
<P>__{at what he has done.)}
