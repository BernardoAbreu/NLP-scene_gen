<L>__{exterior bow same}
<A>__{the shredded jib and rigging whip violently in the wind. the block smashes into the gunnel rail, shattering it. no one dares go near it. for a moment, it seems to hang there seductively. john, naive of its power, leaps for the rail and grabs it.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{nooo!!!}
<A>__{suddenly, the wind cracks the sail instantly hurling john high off the deck and over the side. he holds on for dear life, screaming.}
<B>__{at the wheel}

<P>__{(to chuck)}
<D>__{hold her steady.}

<A>__{alice uncleats the jib halyard, leaving one turn on the pin and shoves it into tod's hands.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{release this when i tell you!!}
<A>__{skipper joins tod as alice scrambles along the deck and pulls herself into the bowsprit netting. when the block and jib swing inboard, she grabs for the leach of the sail yelling...}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{now!!!}
<A>__{as john is snapped inboard alice leaps up, grabbing the sail, leaning out over the open water. waves explode through the netting. as tod releases the halyard, john falls to the deck, bruised, humbled, but alive. lawford and skipper pull alice from the bowsprit. skipper looks her over. relieved. no broken bones. good work. but then this is what he expects. he respects her and now, everyone can see why. he looks at john sprawled on the deck.}

<D>__{be careful will ya?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what ever you say cap...}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{let's get that storm jib up.}
<A>__{skipper gives alice a private look, then returns to the stern where chuck holds tightly onto the wheel.}
<C>__{older chuck }
<D>__{the storm lasted sixteen hours and it set us all on equal footing. it was the first time that we shared an episode on an even plane. as we stood our watches we were equally out of control of our situation, regardless of our physical abilities or social backgrounds. and though our real feelings lay hidden beneath bravado and defiance, we were no longer strangers.}
