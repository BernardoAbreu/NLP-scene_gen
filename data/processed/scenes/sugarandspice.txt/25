<A>__{it's an early 80's dream. the squad sits on their sleeping bags, in a circle, on the floor. they're painting nails, giving henna tattoos, streaking hair, etc. hannah has a ouija board in front of her, hands resting on the "message indicator." diane has her eyes closed.}

<D>__{... ja ck b ar t le tt... is jack bartlett interested in me?}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{i i'm sorry can someone else please run the ouija board? it's creepy, it's wrong and it goes against the teachings of my lord and savior, jesus christ.}
<C>__{kansas}
<D>__{hannah, in order to get real answers from the netherworld, you've gotta have a christian virgin run the board. your kind is pure of heart the devil won't dick with you.}

<D>__{i just got a little squishy...}

<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{"down there." i swear i thought it was the second coming.}
<C>__{kansas}
<D>__{nope. sounds more like the first.}
