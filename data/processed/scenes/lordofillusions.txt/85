<A>__{dorothea sits alone, staring at the wall. harry enters.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{are they treating you okay?}
<C>__{dorothea}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{i heard what happened. it looks like somebody murdered him.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm sorry i got into this too late. but if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{i don't know where you'd start.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well... how about some of the other illusionists?}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{they won't tell you anything.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i can be very persuasive.}
<C>__{dorothea}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{yes. i think you probably can.}
<P>__{(another beat)}
<D>__{we'd need to talk about your fee.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{forget the fee. if i find butterfield, maybe we'll talk about money. if i don't...}
<P>__{(he shrugs)}
<D>__{...my gamble. either way... i get to spend some time... here.}
<A>__{the way he says this, it's plain "here" doesn't mean l.a., it means near dorothea. and by the tiny smile on her face, it's also plain she knows it.}
