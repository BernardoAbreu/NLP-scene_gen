<L>__{interior living room, new house night flashback}
<A>__{we have returned to the previous scene only now we are seeing it through elise's eyes. elise is sitting on the couch, alone. trying to recover from the nights events. she glances up when josh approaches her.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{you introduced me to a new world.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{no. you've been there before, remember? and you'll go back.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{all of us will...eventually.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{maybe i can forget again.}
<A>__{once again, we see him reach into his jacket, taking out the photos lorraine gave him.}
<C>__{josh }
<D>__{i will start by giving these back.}
<A>__{as he hands them to elise, she sees with fear that his hand is withered and wrinkled. shocked, she looks up at his face.}
<C>__{josh }
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<A>__{elise stands up, not knowing how to react.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{nothing, i...}
<A>__{she turns away, reaching for something. we see her scoop up tucker's digital camera.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{what's the matter, elise?}
<A>__{she spins around and lifts tucker's camera up to her face, aiming it at him. she depresses the trigger and takes a photo of him, bathing the whole corridor in white light. and in that split second, josh is replaced by the old woman! elise lowers the camera, horrified. for a beat, the old woman just glares at her... ...then she charges at elise, arms outstretched, wrapping her white hands around the soft flesh of elise's throat. elise chokes, eyes bulging, spittle flying from her mouth, as the pale hands of the old woman dig into her thorax, droplets of blood running down her chest where the yellowing finger nails have cut in : to the flesh. the old woman smiles a merciless harlequin grin that mocks elise's pain. she lets elise go, letting her drop to the floor. the old woman turns and glares down the corridor. something has caught her attention. a distant scream.}
