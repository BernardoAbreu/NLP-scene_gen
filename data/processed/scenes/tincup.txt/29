<D>__{if i had it all to do over, i'd still hit that shot.}
<C>__{romeo}
<P>__{(nods with neither rancor nor irony)}
<D>__{the look comes over your face, you would bury yourself alive to prove you can handle a shovel.}
<A>__{tin cup looks over at romeo for signs of an implied pejorative. but romeo's just washing and scooping balls... and looking badly in need of perspective.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{you know why i'd still hit that shot?}
<A>__{now romeo looks over... and he decides that tin cup is the one in need of perspective.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{'cuz it's the only way you can beat david simms. 'cuz you never got over that he is on tour and you are not. 'cuz you get that look on your face...}

<D>__{no...}

<D>__{i'd hit it again because that shot was a defining moment. and when a defining moment comes along you define the moment or the moment defines you. i did not shrink from the challenge. i rose to it.}

<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{i was playing to win.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{a defining moment when you tried to hit the same impossible cut three wood into the wind from a hilly lie four in a row out of bounds until you finally pulled it off and tapped in for a thirteen.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{when a twelve woulda got you on the tour! that was a defining moment and the definition was shit!}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{greatness courts failure, romeo. that's why most people, in their whole lives, never ever reach for the brass ring, never know when to dig deep and try for the impossible shot...}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{you're right about that, boss, but sometimes... sometimes... par is good enough to win.}
<A>__{tin cup tosses down another maalox cocktail.}
