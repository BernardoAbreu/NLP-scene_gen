<D>__{when i became the principal of central park east elementary, i envisioned a school where children could fulfill their highest potential, despite the challenges of poverty and racism. ten years ago, roberta guaspari walked into my office because she needed a job, and because she had a vision that any child could learn the violin. we put our dreams together and created the east harlem violin program which has helped more than a thousand students expand their vision of what's possible in their lives. when a program like this is cut, our children's future is compromised. i want to thank you for your support. enjoy the concert.}
