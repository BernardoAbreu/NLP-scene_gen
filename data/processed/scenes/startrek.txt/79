<A>__{push in on the door as it opens ayel, chained, looks up, intensely and sees that it's nero who has arrived we push in tight on him as he speaks for the first time:}
<C>__{nero}
<D>__{the wait is over.}
<A>__{off ayel, we cut to:}
<L>__{exterior starfleet academy grounds day [former sc. 82]}
<A>__{tilt down from a glimmering building to reveal a sea of red cadet uniforms: hundreds of cadets head across campus, mccoy and kirk among them. a miraculous view of san francisco beneath a blue sky, golden gate bridge piercing the air. kirk struts:}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{so you'll do it for me, right?}
<C>__{mccoy}
<D>__{i have no interest.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i didn't ask if you have interest, i asked if you'd do it.}
<C>__{mccoy}
<D>__{i'm about to ask you an obvious question: why bother?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{because i've failed the test twice.}
<C>__{mccoy}
<D>__{and you're determined to make it three. we've all failed it everyone has, and that's the point! no one goes back for seconds, let alone thirds it's not like you need to pass it to graduate.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{so bones: why do they make us take it?}
<C>__{mccoy}
<D>__{i told you to stop calling me that. you're very annoying.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{and you're the greatest thank you.}
<C>__{mccoy}
<D>__{you'd better study for it this time.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh, no bones i gotta date.}
<C>__{mccoy}
<D>__{a date? listen, as smart as you are, which ain't much, if you don't prepare }
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{you have no idea how prepared i'm gonna be no idea.}
<A>__{and with a smile, kirk heads off mccoy watches him go, calling after him:}
<C>__{mccoy}
<D>__{seriously, stop calling me bones!}
