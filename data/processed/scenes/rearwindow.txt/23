<A>__{into the next door yard we see emerging from the apartment below the ballet dancer, the elderly lady. she wear a broad sun hat, dark glasses, and a sunsuit consisting of pink shorts and halter. she carries a copy of the herald tribune, and still wears her hearing aid. she settles into a folding, canvas deck chair. her skin is dead white, and her body is thin to the point of emaciation. no sooner has she settled into her chair, than she is attracted by the sound of the salesman working in his garden. she gets up, walks to the fence, and looks over. he notices her, but doesn't speak. she begins gesturing to him how to take care of his flowers. he listens for a moment, then looks directly at her. the strong movements of his mouth show us that he objects vigorously to the annoyance of her comments. she moves away from the fence, started and a little shocked.}
