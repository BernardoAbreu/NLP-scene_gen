<L>__{interior del amo mall day}
<A>__{... jackie walks out of robinson's may hurriedly into the main mall. the calm, cool stride we're used to with jackie is completely gone. she stops, looks around, head darting from one direction to another. she looks in a panic. the camera begins to twirl around her. she seems to be looking for something she doesn't see. she looks helpless and on the verge of tears. as the twirling camera circles her, she screams;}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{ray! ray! i need you! come out! she took the money.}
<A>__{the camera stops twirling. nicolet, dargus, and two other plainclothes cops, come running out of a store towards jackie. as they reach her, a frantic jackie yells;}
<C>__{jackie }
<D>__{melanie burst in the dressing room and took the money!}
