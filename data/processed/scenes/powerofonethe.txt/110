<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior prison cactus garden}
<A>__{quite advanced after five years of planting. pk and geel piet are bent over a cactus, transplanting it. a group of prisoners on the way to a hard labor work task march by. they chant a verse to onoshobishobi ingelosi. pk is a little embarrassed by it.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{you know every time they do that i want to jump up and say i'm just a twelve year old. i'm not anything else.}
<C>__{geel piet}
<D>__{to them you are. you are the one who brings the smoke, the one who writes the letters, the one who puts clothes on their children when they are cold. you are onoshobishobi ingelosi.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{but you know that's not true.}
<C>__{geel piet}
<D>__{who is to say what is true and what is not true, kleine baas.}
<A>__{doc comes running up, excited, waving a newspaper.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{the allied armies have crossed the rhine into germany. it is almost over.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{that's great, isn't it?}
<A>__{he turns to geel piet.}
<C>__{geel piet}
<P>__{(subdued)}
<D>__{yes, kleine baas.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{you are a good faker, geel piet. but you don't think it's great at all. it means you lose your star letter writer and tobacco importer.}
<C>__{geel piet}
<D>__{no matter that, professor. we always manage here. what pains me most is i lose my boxer.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{i will come back.}
<C>__{geel piet}
<P>__{(adamant)}
<D>__{no, kleine baas. you leave this damn place you don't come back never.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{geel piet, when a painter finishes a work of art he doesn't lose it. he sends it out in the world so everyone can see the genius of his creation. this is what you are going to do. and to celebrate the launch of such a work of art as you have made our boxer here, i have composed an entire concerto 'the concerto for the southland' which it is my intention to play in concert for the prisoners before i leave.}
<C>__{geel piet}
<D>__{not possible. the kommandant never allow the people to have such a thing.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{he'll think it's a concert for him and the brass. but we'll know, ay? and the people will know.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{he'll never let black be with white here, doc.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{if the black is part of the orchestra, like the piano, he will.}
<C>__{geel piet}
<D>__{but the people have no instruments in this place, big baas.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{they have their voices. each tribe a different voice, a different language all singing together. it is brilliant, no?}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{except the tribes don't trust each other. they don't even talk to each other.}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(crestfallen)}
<D>__{oh. this is correct. this stupid hatred.}
<C>__{geel piet}
<D>__{they will do it for you, kleine baas. you are onoshobishobi ingelosi. you bring the tobacco. you write the letters. you put clothes on their children's bodies and food in their bellies. all you do is ask and they all sing for you.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{he's right. wunderbar. you are the smartest of us all.}
<A>__{geel piet smiles as he lifts the watering pot to exit. a truncheon stops him. all turn to sergeant bormann.}
<C>__{bormann}
<D>__{a kaffir smarter than all of us? you are a strange german, professor.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{that little maniac with the moustache in berlin you admire. he is the strange german. and soon kaput, i hope.}
<C>__{bormann}
<D>__{if that's true you'll not be long for this place, eh, professor?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{no, sergeant. god willing.}
<C>__{bormann}
<D>__{and you, too, little rooinek. but you, kaffir, hitler comes or goes...}
<A>__{he takes geel piet's hand.}
<C>__{bormann}
<D>__{you are going to stay with me.}
<A>__{he forces geel piet's hand closer and closer to a cactus with long thorns.}
<C>__{bormann}
<D>__{and i will find out all your secrets once your friends are gone. one slip...}
<A>__{he pushes geel piet's hands onto the cactus needle. geel piet does not cry out.}
<C>__{bormann}
<D>__{i have you.}
<A>__{he lets go of geel piet's hand. geel piet removes it from the cactus, bloodied.}
<C>__{bormann}
<D>__{get out of here.}
<A>__{geel piet takes his watering can and goes.}
<C>__{bormann}
<D>__{you see, professor, they are not like us. a white man would scream bloody murder.}
<A>__{doc and pk glare at bormann. he smirks and walks away.}
<C>__{pk }
<D>__{as the weeks went by and the date for the concert grew closer, my life was a whirlwind.}
<A>__{pk and geel piet appear before various tribal leaders, talking, agreeing, shaking hands.}
<C>__{pk }
<D>__{having obtained the cooperation of all the tribal groups, we set about instructing them. four men from each tribe were taught the intricacies of their group's parts. they were the choral leaders responsible for teaching the others.}
<A>__{pk and doc instruct. doc plays the piano. pk leads the singers. geel piet turns the pages for doc.}
<C>__{pk }
<D>__{at night the prison hummed with the men in their cells practicing.}
