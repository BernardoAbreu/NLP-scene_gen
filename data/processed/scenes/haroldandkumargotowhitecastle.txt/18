<A>__{tired and frustrated, harold enters his apartment. the place is minimally decorated, with one of the highlights being a poster of "billy madison."}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{kumar?}
<C>__{kumar }
<D>__{yeah, i'm in here!}
<A>__{harold walks over to kumar's room and looks inside. it's martha stewart's nightmare dirty laundry all over the floor, etc. on his walls we see old school gangsta rap posters. marijuana paraphernalia is everywhere. we see a giant photograph of kumar with his arm around mr. t. kumar is not in the room, however.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{kumar?}
<C>__{kumar }
<D>__{in here...}
<A>__{curious, harold walks over to his room (neat, tidy, ikea furnishings), where he sees kumar standing butt naked in front of a full length mirror. there's a "clipping sound" coming from kumar's direction. harold stares at him, shocked and appalled. harold walks inside...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{kumar, what the hell are you doing!}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{i'm trimming my pubes.}
<A>__{kumar looks at himself in the mirror as he makes a couple more snips. on the floor, we see large clumps of hair.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{why aren't you doing this in your room!}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{the mirror's in here.}
