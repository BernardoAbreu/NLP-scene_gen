<L>__{exterior barton cottage morning}
<A>__{the rain has cleared. sir john's horse munches grass contentedly by the side of the road.}
<C>__{sir john }
<D>__{mr willoughby is well worth catching, miss dashwood miss marianne must not expect to have all the men to herself!}
<L>__{interior barton cottage parlour morning}
<A>__{the dashwoods are having a frustrating time winkling information about willoughby out of sir john, who is in turn only anxious to protect brandon's interest. marianne has her bandaged foot up on the sofa and is fast losing patience.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{but what do you know of mr willoughby, sir john?}
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{decent shot and there is not a bolder rider in all england.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{but what is he like?}
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{like?}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{what are his tastes? his passions? his pursuits?}
<C>__{sir john}
<P>__{(mystified)}
<D>__{well, he has the nicest little bitch of a pointer was she out with him yesterday?}
<A>__{marianne gives up. mrs dashwood takes over.}
<C>__{mrs dashwood}
<D>__{where is allenham, sir john?}
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{nice little estate three miles east. he is to inherit it from an elderly relative lady allen is her name.}
<A>__{now they are getting somewhere. marianne is about to ask another question when they hear a horse galloping up. everyone is electrified. margaret runs to the window and turns back in disappointment.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{it is colonel brandon. i shall go outside and keep watch.}
<A>__{margaret runs out of the room.}
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{you are all on the lookout for willoughby, eh? dear me, poor brandon. you will none of you think of him now.}
<A>__{brandon is admitted by betsy. he is carrying a large bunch of hothouse flowers.}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<D>__{how is the invalid?}
<A>__{he hands marianne the flowers with a smile.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{thank you so much, colonel.}
<A>__{she rather absently hands the flowers to elinor, who goes for a vase. sir john gestures at brandon with bluff insensitivity.}
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{miss marianne, i cannot see why you should set your cap at mr willoughby when you have already made such a splendid conquest!}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{i have no intention of 'setting my cap' at anyone, sir john!}
<C>__{colonel brandon}
<D>__{mr willoughby lady allen's nephew?}
<A>__{brandon's light tone betrays no emotion. elinor comes back in with the flowers and puts them on the table next to}
<B>__{marianne.}
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{aye, he visits every year for he is to inherit allenham and he has a very pretty estate of his own, miss dashwood, combe magna in somerset. if i were you, i would not give him up to my younger sister in spite of all this tumbling down hills.}
<A>__{suddenly margaret runs in screaming 'marianne's preserver!' at the top of her voice. everyone starts to move at once. margaret is silenced. brandon looks at marianne, whose incandescent expression makes her feelings all too clear.}
<C>__{sir john}
<D>__{here is the man himself. come, brandon we know when we are not wanted. let us leave him to the ladies!}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{marianne! sir john and the colonel are leaving.}
<A>__{marianne looks up, suddenly self conscious.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{goodbye, colonel. thank you for the flowers.}
<A>__{elinor sees them out. we hear willoughby's voice outside. close on marianne's radiant anticipation.}
