<L>__{exterior football pitch. night}
<A>__{on a flood lit five a side pitch, renton and his friends are taking on another team at football. the opposition all wear an identical strip (arsenal), whereas renton and his friends wear an odd assortment of gear. three girls lizzy, gail, and allison and baby stand by the side, watching. the boys are outclassed by the team with the strip but play much dirtier. as each performs a characteristic bit of play, the play freezes and their name is visible, printed or written on some item of clothing. (t shirt, baseball cap, shorts, trainers). in begbie's case, his name appears as a tatoo on his arm. sick boy commits a sneaky foul and indignantly denies it. begbie commits an obvious foul and make no effort to deny it. spud, in goal, lets the ball in between his legs. tommy kicks the ball as hard as he can. renton's litany continues over the action:}

<D>__{choose leisure wear and matching luggage. choose a three piece suite on hire purchase in a range of fucking fabrics. choose diy and wondering who you are on a sunday morning. choose sitting on that couch watching mind numbing sprit crushing game shows, stuffing fucking junk food into your mouth. choose rotting away at the end of it all, pishing you last in a miserable home, nothing more than an embarrassment to the selfish, fucked up brats you have spawned to replace yourself. choose your future. choose life.}

<D>__{but who would i want to do a thing like that?}
