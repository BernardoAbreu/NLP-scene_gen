<L>__{exterior minas tirith, tower hall day}
<A>__{close on: gandalf stands in the tower hall . . . seemingly alone . . . he speaks quietly, doubt and fear edge his voice.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{frodo has passed beyond my sight. the darkness is deepening.}
<A>__{he turns and crosses the hall to reveal the presence of gimli, legolas, eomer and aragorn . . . aragorn, his back to gandalf . . .}
<C>__{aragorn}
<D>__{if sauron had the .ring, we would know it.}
<A>__{close on: gandalf still troubled, still worried . . .}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{it's only a matter of time. he has suffered a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of mordor our enemy is regrouping.}
<A>__{gimli sits insolently on the seat of the steward . . .}
<C>__{gimli}
<D>__{let him stay there. let him rot. why should we care?}
<A>__{gandalf looks across at the dwarf . . . his face ashen.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{because ten thousand ores now stand between frodo and mount doom.}
<C>__{gandalf }
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{i have sent him to his death.}
<A>__{angle on: aragorn turns around suddenly . . .}
<C>__{aragorn}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{gandalf looks up sharply at aragorn . . .}
<C>__{aragorn }
<D>__{there is still hope for frodo. he needs time and safe passage across the plains of gorgoroth. we can give him that.}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{aragorn}
<D>__{draw out sauron' s armies empty his lands. then we gather our full strength and march on the black gate.}
<A>__{at this, gimli chokes on his pipe . . . eomer steps forward.}
<C>__{eomer}
<D>__{we cannot achieve victory from strength of arms .}
<C>__{aragorn}
<D>__{not for ourselves . . . but we can give frodo his chance if we keep sauron' s eye fixed upon us. keep him blind to all else that moves .}
<C>__{legolas}
<D>__{a diversion . . .}
<A>__{close on: gandalf speaks in a low tone to aragorn . . .}
<C>__{gandalf}
<P>__{(doubtful)}
<D>__{sauron will suspect a trap. he will not take the bait!}
<C>__{gimli}
<D>__{certainty of death. small chance of success. what are we waiting for?}
