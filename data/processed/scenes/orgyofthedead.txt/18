<L>__{exterior woods night}
<A>__{bob and shirley are lying on their backs, unconcsious, on the ground. the ground is covered by scattered leaves. misty fog swirls over them.}

<L>__{exterior cemetery night}
<A>__{cemetery is filled with fog. we see a large stone throne framed by ornate columns, with an altar beneath it. there are tombstones in the background, and skulls and bones on the ground. camera pans right across a small clearing to the mausoleum.}
<C>__{criswell }
<D>__{it is said on clear nights, beneath the cold light of the moon, howl the dog and the wolf, and creeping things crawl out of the slime. it is then the ghouls feast in all their radiance.}
<A>__{the mausoleum doors creak open on their own, and criswell quickly stalks out across the clearing, hiding his face behind his long black cape which is held up with his bent elbow against his face, in dracula fashion.}
<P>__{criswell (vo continuing)}
<D>__{it is on nights like this most people prefer to steer clear of, uh, burial grounds . it is on nights like this, that the creatures are said to appear, and to walk !}
