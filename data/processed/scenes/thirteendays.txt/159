<L>__{interior kenny's office night}
<A>__{super: wednesday, october 24th. day 9. kenny bolts upright from his couch. he rubs his face, sits on the edge in the dark for a beat. he's not going back to sleep. he grabs his trousers.}
<L>__{interior west wing halls continuous}
<A>__{kenny makes his way through the dim, deserted halls. somewhere in the distance a phone rings. he reaches a door.}
<L>__{exterior white house night}
<A>__{kenny, bundled in an overcoat, steps outside the north entrance. the cool air invigorates him. he eyes the fence, pennsylvania avenue beyond it, seeming to isolate this world from the living city beyond. he starts for the main gate.}
<L>__{exterior main gate continuous}
<A>__{a white house police officer jumps up as kenny approaches.}
<C>__{police officer}
<D>__{would you like me to call a car, mr. o'donnell.}

<C>__{police officer}
<D>__{fifteen minutes, maybe. to your house, sir?}
<A>__{kenny considers, shakes his head. he wants to go home, but...}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{no. no, i will let her sleep. let 'em sleep.}
<A>__{kenny says it with a certain finality. the police officer nods, and kenny wanders out through the gates, shouldering the weight of the world.}
