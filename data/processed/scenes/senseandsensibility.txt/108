<L>__{interior mrs jennings's house bedroom day}
<A>__{elinor finds marianne sitting on the edge of the bed. she does not acknowledge elinor but merely lifts the letter and reads out, with deadly calm:}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{'my dear madam i am quite at a loss to discover in what point i could be so unfortunate as to offend you. my esteem for your family is very sincere but if i have given rise to a belief of more than i felt or meant to express, i shall reproach myself for not having been more guarded. my affections have long been engaged elsewhere and it is with great regret that i return your letters and the lock of hair which you so obligingly bestowed upon me. i am etc. john willoughby.'}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{oh, marianne.}
<A>__{marianne gives a great howl of pain and flings herself across the bed as though in physical agony.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{marianne, oh, marianne it is better to know at once what his intentions are. dearest, think of what you would have felt if your engagement had carried on for months and months before he chose to put an end to it.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{we are not engaged.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{but you wrote to him! i thought then that he must have left you with some kind of understanding?}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{no he is not so unworthy as you think him.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{not so unworthy! did he tell you that he loved you?}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{yes. no never absolutely. it was every day implied, but never declared. sometimes i thought it had been, but it never was. he has broken no vow.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{he has broken faith with all of us, he made us all believe he loved you.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{he did! he did he loved me as i loved him.}
<A>__{mrs jennings bursts through the door in her hat and coat, panting.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{i had to come straight up how are you, miss marianne?}
<A>__{marianne begins to sob uncontrollably.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{poor thing! she looks very bad. no wonder, miss dashwood, for it is but too true. i was told here in the street by miss morton, who is a great friend: he is to be married at the end of the month to a miss grey with fifty thousand pounds. well, said i, if 'tis true, then he is a good for nothing who has used my young friend abominably ill, and i wish with all my soul that his wife may plague his heart out!}
<A>__{she goes round the bed to comfort marianne.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{but he is not the only young man worth having, my dear, and with your pretty face you will never want for admirers.}
<A>__{marianne sobs even harder.}
<C>__{mrs jennings}
<D>__{ah, me! she had better have her cry out and have done with it. i will go and look out something to tempt her does she care for olives?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{i cannot tell you.}
<A>__{mrs jennings leaves. marianne seizes the letter again.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{i cannot believe his nature capable of such cruelty!}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{marianne, there is no excuse for him this is his hand }
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{but it cannot be his heart! oh, mamma! i want mamma! elinor, please take me home! cannot we go tomorrow?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{there is no one to take us.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{cannot we hire a carriage?}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{we have no money and indeed we owe mrs jennings more courtesy.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{all she wants is gossip and she only likes me because i supply it! oh, god! i cannot endure to stay.}
<C>__{elinor}
<D>__{i will find a way. i promise.}
