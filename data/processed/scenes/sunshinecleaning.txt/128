<L>__{exterior rose's house night}
<A>__{in pajamas and bare feet, oscar steps into the night. he flicks on the flashlight.}
<L>__{exterior woods night}
<A>__{norah leads lynn through a wooded area toward a train trestle. norah carries the two remaining beers of a six pack.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{are the bodies there?}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{no. the person is gone. it's weird `cuz we're connected to them in this strangely intimate way... but we never actually meet them. it's just kind of weird.}
<A>__{norah steps over a discarded tire.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{i have seen a dead body once though.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{my mom.}
<A>__{lynn follows norah, not knowing how to respond. it's awkward. norah tries to lighten things.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{she was in a movie of the week once, ya know.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{your mom?}
<A>__{norah nods.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{a bunch of hollywood people were filming down in old town. they thought my mom was so beautiful and so talented that they gave her a speaking part. you want to hear it?}
<A>__{lynn nods.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{`i recommend the pecan pie.'}
<A>__{norah looks back at lynn for applause.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{i recommend the pecan pie?}
<A>__{norah nods.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{that was her line. it was on tv and everything.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{that's pretty cool.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{me and rose, we didn't actually see it but rose says mom talked about it all the time. i don't remember.}
<A>__{norah shrugs.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{i don't remember her much at all. i have this box of her stuff though, little things she touched. when it seems like she never even really existed... it's proof.}
<A>__{the two reach the bottom of a train trestle.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{all right. this is where we climb.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{up to that girder.}
<A>__{norah points to a rusted girder about eight feet from the underbelly of the track.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{i'm not climbing up there.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{best place to be when it comes.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{uh uh.}
<A>__{norah slips her hand through one of the plastic rings of the six pack and starts to climb.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{you're gonna miss the best part.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{i accept that.}
<A>__{the two cans of beer dangle from norah's arm like a giant charm bracelet and clank against girders as she climbs.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{it's like... it's like this big pissed off god up in your face just screaming at you. so close you can smell the metal on his breath.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{sounds great.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{it is. i'm telling you.}
<A>__{norah wedges her butt into the belly of a beam and taps her fingers against the rusted girder. after a moment she leans out and looks down toward lynn.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{i didn't mean to bum you out with the whole mom stuff. i just thought you would... i don't know, i guess i thought...}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{the trestle starts to shake.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{he's coming.}
<A>__{the thunder gets louder. lynn covers her ears. norah pops open a beer and laughs as the train approaches.}
