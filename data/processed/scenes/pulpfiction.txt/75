<B>__{motel room morning}
<A>__{same shot as before, the next morning. we find butch still asleep in bed. fabienne brushes her teeth half in and half out of the bathroom so she can watch tv at the same time. she still wears the terry cloth robe from the night before. on tv: william smith and a bunch of hell's angels are taking on the entire vietnamese army in the film "the losers". butch wakes from his sleep, as if a scary monster was chasing him. his start startles fabienne.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{merde! you startled me. did you have a bad dream?}
<A>__{butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to focus. butch, still trying to chase the cobwebs away, sees on tv hell's angels tear assin' through a vietnamese prison camp.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{what are you watching?}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{a motorcycle movie, i'm not sure the name.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{are you watchin' it?}
<A>__{fabienne enters the room.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{in a way. why? would you like for me to switch it off?}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{would you please?}
<A>__{she reaches over and turns off the tv.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{it's a little too early in the morning for explosions and war.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{what was it about?}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{how should i know, you were the one watchin' it.}
<A>__{fabienne laughs.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{no, imbecile, what was your dream about?}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{oh, i... don't remember. it's really rare i remember a dream.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{you just woke up from it.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{fabienne, i'm not lying to you, i don't remember.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{well, let's look at the grumpy man in the morning. i didn't say you were lying, it's just odd you don't remember your dreams. i always remember mine. did you know you talk in your sleep?}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{i don't talk in my sleep, do i talk in my sleep?}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{you did last night.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{what did i say?}
<A>__{laying on top of him.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{i don't know. i couldn't understand you.}
<A>__{she kisses butch.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{why don't you get up and we'll get some breakfast at that breakfast place with the pancakes.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{one more kiss and i will get up.}
<A>__{fabienne gives butch a sweet long kiss.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{satisfied?}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{yep.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{then get up, lazy bones.}
<A>__{butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of the suitcase that fabienne brought.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{what time is it?}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{almost nine in the morning. what time does our train arrive?}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{eleven.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{i'm gonna order a big plate of blueberry pancakes with maple syrup, eggs over easy, and five sausages.}
<C>__{butch}
<P>__{(surprised at her potential appetite)}
<D>__{anything to drink with that?}
<A>__{butch is finished dressing.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<P>__{(referring to his clothes)}
<D>__{oh yes, that looks nice. to drink, a tall glass or orange juice and a black cup of coffee. after that, i'm going to have a slice of pie.}
<A>__{as he goes through the suitcase.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{pie for breakfast?}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{any time of the day is a good time for pie. blueberry pie to go with the pancakes. and on top, a thin slice of melted cheese}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{where's my watch?}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{it's there.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{no, it's not. it's not here.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{have you looked?}
<A>__{by now, butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{yes i've fuckin' looked!!}
<A>__{he's now throwing clothes.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{what the fuck do you think i'm doing?! are you sure you got it?}
<A>__{fabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen butch this way.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{uhhh... yes... beside the table drawer}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{on the little kangaroo.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{yes, it was on your little kangaroo.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{well it's not here!}
<C>__{fabienne}
<P>__{(on the verge of tears)}
<D>__{well it should be!}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{oh it most definitely should be here, but it's not. so where is it?}
<A>__{fabienne is crying and scared. butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more menacing.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{fabienne, that was my father's fuckin' watch. you know what my father went through to git me that watch?... i don't wanna get into it right now... but he went through a lot. now all this other shit, you coulda set on fire, but i specifically reminded you not to forget my father's watch. now think, did you get it?}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{i believe so...}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{you believe so? you either did, or you didn't, now which one is it?}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{then i did.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<C>__{fabienne}
<P>__{(shaking)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{butch freaks out, he punches the air. fabienne screams and backs into a corner, butch picks up the motel tv and throws it against the wall. fabienne screams in horror. butch looks toward her, suddenly calm.}
<C>__{butch}
<P>__{(to fabienne)}
<D>__{no! it's not your fault.}
<P>__{(he approached her)}
<D>__{you left it at the apartment.}
<A>__{he bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor. he touches her hand, she flinches.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{if you did leave it at the apartment, it's not your fault. i had you bring a bunch of stuff. i reminded you about it, but i didn't illustrate how personal the watch was to me. if all i gave a fuck about was my watch, i should've told you. you ain't a mind reader.}
<A>__{he kisses her hand. then rises. fabienne is still sniffling. butch goes to the closet.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{butch puts on his high school jacket.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{don't be. it just means i won't be able to eat breakfast with you.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{why does it mean that?}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{because i'm going back to my apartment to get my watch.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{won't the gangsters be looking for you there?}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{that's what i'm gonna find out. if they are, and i don't think i can handle it, i will split.}
<A>__{rising from the floor.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{i was so dreadful. i saw your watch, i thought i brought it. i'm so sorry.}
<A>__{butch brings her close and puts his hands on her face.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{don't feel bad, sugar pop. nothing you could ever do would make me permanently angry at you.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i love you, remember?}
<P>__{(he digs some money out of his wallet)}
<D>__{now here's some money, order those pancakes and have a great breakfast.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{don't go.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{i will be back before you can say, blueberry pie.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{blueberry pie.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{well maybe not that fast, but fast. okay? okay?}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{he kisses her once more and heads for the door.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{bye bye, sugar pop.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{bye.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{i'm gonna take your honda.}
<C>__{fabienne}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{and with that, he's out the door. fabienne sits on the bed and looks at the money he gave her.}
