<L>__{interior whale's house studio day}
<A>__{whale leans forward, completely disoriented. his eyes fix on clay, the white eyebrows screwed down, until he is able to recognize the face.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{don't do this to me again, mr. boone. i absolutely refuse.}
<A>__{whale stands, his legs shaky.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you will not set me on another walk down memory lane. not this lane. not today.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i didn't }
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{why do i tell you this? i never told david. i never even remembered it until you got me going.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you're the one who started it.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you're very clever, mr. boone. you just sit there and let me talk. what a sorry old man, you're thinking. what a crazy old poof.}
<P>__{(comes closer)}
<D>__{why are you here? what do you want from me?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you asked me to model. remember?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{of course i remember. do you think i'm so senile }
<A>__{whale stands over clay. his pale face turns left, right, looking at clay with one cold eye, then the other. clay returns the gaze, worried for whale.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{mr. whale? are you okay?}
<A>__{whale turns away. he yanks out a handkerchief.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{stupid. very stupid. what have i been thinking?}
<A>__{he sits on the daybed and bends over, covering both eyes with the handkerchief.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{just go. please. why don't you go?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i don't get it. first you creep me out with homo shit. then you hit me with war stories. and now you're upset because i listen? what do you want?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i want i want...}
<A>__{his pained eyes focus on clay, and soften.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i want a glass of water.}
<A>__{clay gets up and goes to the sink.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{a touch of headache.}
<A>__{clay hands him the water.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{whale sets the glass down and sits with his head lowered, his body folded like a bundle of sticks.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{my apologies. i had no business snapping at you.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{no harm done.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{it was foolishness to attempt this portrait. you cannot force what will not flow.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you don't want me to sit for you anymore?}
<A>__{whale shakes his head sadly. he gazes up at clay, sees the disappointment on his face.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{how would you like to come to a party with me? a reception for princess margaret.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i thought you weren't going.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{if you don't mind driving, i'd like to take you as my guest. there should be lots of pretty starlets to keep you amused.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i'm game. sure.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{very good, clayton. may i call you clayton? or do you prefer boone?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{clayton is fine.}
<A>__{whale smiles gently.}
