<C>__{james earl jones}
<D>__{no i will take the bottle. thank you.}
<A>__{she hands him the airplane sized bottle he waves off the glass. she shrugs, leaving... pasqual to resume what he was doing. slowly, he removes a roll of certs. he looks to jones "well? what about your end of the bargain?" from within his dashiki, jones pulls out a black velvet pouch. he hands it to pasqual, who opens it to find diamonds. a helluva lot of diamonds. pasqual smiles. he hands the roll of certs to jones. it's not breath candy at all, but a tiny roll of explosives, with a tiny, high tech triggering mechanism.}
<C>__{james earl jones}
<D>__{ah, c 5. the most dangerous explosive material ever invented. hard to believe that this little contraption could blow up ten city blocks.}
<C>__{pasqual}
<D>__{be careful with it, huh?}
<A>__{both men smile. pasqual's very relieved that the deal is done. then suddenly, the lights blink out. pasqual looks around, nervous. but it's just the in flight movie beginning. clouds, and a woman holding a torch. charlie's angels 8 18 99 columbia pictures presents... david spade and adam sandler in "bosom buddies: the movie." james earl jones shakes his head, rolls his eyes.}

<B>__{dropping with them}
<A>__{they continue to fall, gaining speed. pasqual is terrified, but jones doesn't seem worried. in fact, casually, he glances at his watch, and then looks far below them across the sky at the tiny black speck gradually grows larger in the distance... charlie's angels 8 18 99 closer on that black speck it's a jet helicopter. its door opens, and now a skydiver leaps out, helmet down, arms back, streaking across the sky in aerodynamic perfection, heading directly towards}

<D>__{you crazy bastard!}

<D>__{i think you mean crazy bitch.}

<A>__{now, men in "fbi" windbreakers haul pasqual away, two of them carefully handling the certs explosive. a harmless fellow pushes his way past them and onto the dock. it's john bosley, charlie's lieutenant. charlie's angels 8 18 99 he reaches the boat, which natalie ties off while alex and dylan neatly fold their parachutes.}

<D>__{once upon a time...}
<A>__{charlie's angels 8 18 99 three fourth grade school photos fill the frame, side by side by side. these are three very different girls. natalie, with a page boy cut and wearing a catholic schoolgirl's uniform, sports glasses and braces; a bit awkward and gangly, even shy. alex, formally dressed with perfect pig tails, is sophisticated and self possessed; a class act, even at ten. dylan, wild blond hair and faded t shirt, has a jaded, street wise smirk; even at this young age, her isolation and disillusionment are masked by seeming confidence.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{... there were three very different little girls.}
<A>__{the triptych remains on screen. now it shifts into: video tape the three girls (still in triptych) now teenagers, on home video. natalie, working the a v equipment at school, hides her face in embarrassment, uncomfortable with the camera.}

<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{who grew up into three very different women.}
<B>__{triptych continues}
<A>__{they're all women now, in their early twenties. natalie, a research fellow at mit (and beautiful, but not flaunting it) demonstrates a chess playing computer program to a room of impressed advisors. alex, valedictorian at oxford, passionately delivers her address to a crowd of rapt students, faculty and parents. dylan, in leather and a helmet, steps off a harley. she sees a punk with a mohawk slapping around his girlfriend. she decks him, then enters the back door of a seedy punk bar.}

<D>__{my name is charlie.}
<A>__{angel silhouettes appear, in flames. new music kicks in.}
<D>__{"charlie's angels"}
<A>__{...and a new title sequence takes over: various shots: montage (over music) credits continue as we watch the angels in action (from, presumably, previous adventures...) a microscope peering natalie cuts a ruby, drops it in a laser housing, shoots a red beam. dylan, wielding kendo sticks, spars with two yakzuza. alex side kicks two baddies, spins, drops a third. zoom back: she is at the parthenon. a motocross race. natalie digs in for the finish, attacking the last jump with gusto. dylan, in traditional islamic robes, finds a secret switch. she pushes back a bookcase to reveal secret stairs. at a ballroom dance competition, alex wows the crowd while keeping her eye on a nefarious couple. bosley, as "luka, the bad ass pimp," bitch slaps a couple of "ho's" actually dylan and alex then winks at them as unsuspecting drug dealers back off, scared. natalie bites into a messy hot dog, has to just laugh. the three angels elbow their way through a roller derby match. in orange prison jumpsuits, alex and dylan work in female chain gang. window washer natalie peers into a skyscraper office, surreptitiously photographing the meeting inside. charlie's angels 8 18 99 on an italian street, the three angels buy a paper, grin at the headline, "mystery women save european union." as they high five, dylan's cone of gelato drops to the sidewalk. the angels look at it, look at each other...and just have to laugh.}
