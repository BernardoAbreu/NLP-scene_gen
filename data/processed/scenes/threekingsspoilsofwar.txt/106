<L>__{interior military courtroom months later}
<A>__{jaeger is cleaned up, in dress uniform, and sitting at a table before a military tribunal. he looks very sullen, as if this whole adventure has robbed him of his soul. the members of the tribunal just look pissed.}
<C>__{chief justice}
<D>__{the members of this tribunal have reached a verdict. based on the evidence presented we find the defended guilty as charged of desertion, insurrection, insubordination, and conduct unbecoming. further the tribunal will recommend that the defendant be sentenced to life imprisonment, and that from this day forward he shall no longer walk as a free man. you should consider yourself quite fortunate, son. there was a time when lesser crimes would have found you before a firing squad. i don't know that a person like you has much to say for himself, but it is your right say something.}
<A>__{jager doesn't stand. he doesn't look at the tribunal. he just begins to talk.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i guess. not for looking for the gold, or leaving my post. you know what it's like to have gold raining out of your hands? that'll give me enough to think about the rest of my days in the brig. i'm just sorry about wes. he was all right. it was the gold that made him what he became. if i hadn't found that map, if i hadn't talked them into going searching...wes just might have made it home after all. i guess i feel responsible for him.}
<C>__{chief justice}
<D>__{the way i view things you're responsible for the lives of two men: private first class wes hanmond, and second lieutenant john epps.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{yeah, well, i've been thinking about that. see, there was an explosion and everything, but i never really aaw epps get killed. and nobody ever found the gold. i guess they both could have been burned to slag. i guess. but there were a lot of bodies out on that road. a smart man could have found some identification to use. a smart man could have made his way up to syria or turkey. a smart man could have gotten himself right out of the middle east. a smart man with enough gold. way i figure, right about now old epps is sitting in a bar in sydney, or melboure, or maybe brisbane telling stories to one of the prettiest aussies you ever saw.}
<A>__{the members of the tribunal just scoff.}
<C>__{chief justice}
<D>__{i find it highly unlikely that anyone could accomplish such a thing.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{well, sir, i guess you don't know second lieutenant john epps very well, do you?}
<A>__{jaeger allows himself a slight smile as he leaves the tribunal with this question.}
