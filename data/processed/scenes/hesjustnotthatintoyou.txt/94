<L>__{interior ben's office evening}
<A>__{ben deftly shuts and locks the door behind them.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{oh. my. god.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{this is really good news.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i cannot believe this. he liked my demo. did you hear what he said? when he said it was hauntingly beautiful? did you hear that part?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{yep. i was sitting right there.}
<A>__{ben smiles, and pulls anna to him.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{thank you. thank you so much.}
<A>__{with that, they start to kiss. it gets heated. clothes start to come off. mostly anna's. they make their way over to the leather sofa.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{how is it that every time i see your body, i'm shocked at how beautiful it is?}
<A>__{anna smiles at the compliment. she starts to work on his shirt when: someone tries to open the locked door.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{dana, i need to go over the offering statement. can i get a few minutes?}
<A>__{ben continues to remove his shirt as he talks.}
<C>__{janine }
<D>__{it's not dana.}
<A>__{ben freezes. literally freezes on top of anna.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{is }
<A>__{ben frantically puts his hands over anna's mouth. then, working with speed and precision, he gathers all of anna's things and shoves her naked into the closet. there isn't enough room to stand, so she has to sit. she looks up at ben, he closes the closet door. he goes to the door of the office.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{shit. i told dana to get this lock fixed. one sec.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{why do you even lock it?}
<A>__{ben re buttons his shirt, gives the office a once over.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'd never get anything done if i didn't.}
<A>__{finally, ben opens the door, and janine is standing there, smiling.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{can i come in?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{she makes a show of closing and locking the door.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{sit down.}
<A>__{ben goes to sit behind his desk, confused.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{janine, clearly a little nervous, goes to straddle ben at his desk chair. her skirt is way too long to do this, so she has to regroup, and hike up the skirt. ben glances over at the closet.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{janine, what are you doing?}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{i don't know. i just thought maybe we could, you know, relight the fire.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{honey, did you hear what i just said? i gotta get this offering statement out.}
<A>__{ben picks up some papers, but janine is not giving up.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{look, i am trying here. do you want to save our marriage or don't you?}
<A>__{janine looks at ben. ben is silent.}
