<L>__{116a interior peter & maria's apartment day 116a}
<A>__{the front door opens. maria (early 30s) has changed from when we first saw her she wears a revealing outfit, and her natural beauty now smolders beneath the surface. she regards karen warily.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{i'm late for work.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i just need a couple minutes.}
<A>__{maria finally steps aside, letting karen in. the apartment is small, and completely unkempt. the kitchen is a mess, clothes lie everywhere.}
<C>__{maria}
<P>__{(sarcastic:)}
<D>__{make yourself at home.}
<A>__{karen looks for a place to sit. she decides to stand. maria sizes her up. a beat. then:}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{well?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{your husband, peter. three years ago he...}
<A>__{she trails off, in delicate territory.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{he what?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{he killed himself.}
<A>__{maria eyes her blankly. then she turns to look at something o.s. karen follows her gaze to the open door of the bedroom. and the window beyond.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(almost ashamed:)}
<D>__{i'm... sorry.}
<A>__{maria turns back to her, sadness on her face. then:}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{maria reaches for a pack of cigarettes. lights one. offers them to karen. she shakes her head.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{how did you know peter?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i didn't.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{then what are you doing here?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i think there's a connection between your husband's death and something that happened to me.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{what happened to you?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{it's... hard to explain.}
<A>__{maria takes a drag from her cigarette. waiting.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{look, i know this sounds strange, but... i don't think your husband wanted to die.}
<C>__{maria}
<P>__{(even:)}
<D>__{then why would he throw himself out a window?}
<A>__{karen struggles to find the answer.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{let me guess: `hard to explain'?}
<A>__{karen nods. maria's brave face slips. she turns away.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{i put all this behind me. i don't want to open it back up again.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{if that's true, then why are you still here in japan?}
<A>__{maria turns back. she only looks defensive for a moment.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{because i can't leave. i tried. but i couldn't. not without...}
<A>__{maria speaks softly, forming words she's never spoken aloud:}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{he usually didn't wake up before me. but that morning, he did. he made coffee for us. then he sat there and waited for me to wake up. and when i did, he looked me right in the eye. and then he jumped. the night before we'd been talking about having children together...}
<A>__{she wipes away the tears in her eyes.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{did you know a woman named kayako?}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{did peter?}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{maria turns away, growing tense.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{maybe it was someone he worked with?}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{look. i've had the police up here, i talked with detectives, i even hired a p.i. }
<P>__{(composing herself:)}
<C>__{maria }
<D>__{i don't know what you're going through, or what you think you know about my husband. but i don't have any answers. i'm sorry.}
<A>__{she turns back to karen to find the young woman sitting slumped on the edge of a sofa, tears in her eyes. maria softens as karen looks up at her, pleading:}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{please. i don't know what else to do. please help me.}
