<L>__{interior museum kitchen day}
<A>__{the basement door is wide open. gladys mixes food in a bowl. a cigarette with a massive ash hangs off her lip. a male tarantula moves across the ceiling. the creature is the size of a pit bull. two quivering palps flank dart sized fangs. multiple eyes the size of quarters. hair all over. gladys is oblivious to the ominous threat above her. as she works, the spider shadows her. every time the spider is about to strike, she goes another direction to get spices, utensils, a pan. gladys places her bowl on the stove. suddenly the tarantula drops onto the stove right in front of her. gladys shrieks. the tarantula lashes out at her. gladys grabs a frying pan and smashes it across the face as she stumbles backward. the spider reels, striking the burner knobs, turning on the gas. gladys registers the sound of escaping gas. she looks back toward the fuse box and makes a run for it. as she goes, the tarantula fires a webline at her. gladys gets the fuse off the top of the fuse box, but the webline prevents her from slotting it home. gladys strains with all her might, finally slots the fuse. she turns toward the kitchen just in time to see the broken burner spark to life. the gas ignites. the tarantula is engulfed in flame. gladys is knocked down by the blast. she lies on her back when a second male tarantula nails her with a webline. gladys screams as she's dragged across the floor toward the basement door. the fire grows more intense, spreading quickly.}
