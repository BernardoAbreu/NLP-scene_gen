<A>__{philip walks rapidly down a long corridor that opens out into a broader hallway, moving from the darkness of the chapel into ever brighter light and more visible glory. on his face the far shining gaze of a man who now knows his mission. silent servants press themselves to the walls as he goes by. through the hallway to a grand salon. courtiers fall silent and bow as he passes. so into the grandest salon of all, where his magnificent court is gathered; among them his 12 year old daughter, the infanta. as he enters, all kneel. his eyes scan his ministers and courtiers, all kneeling, heads bowed before him. his gaze falls on one who wears the plain black robes of a jesuit priest: robert reston, the face we glimpsed in the opening montage. he speaks to all.}

<L>__{exterior thames day}
<A>__{a ripple of light on the water. a blur of approaching colour. the royal barge is gliding towards us, slowly taking shape: its hull gaily painted, its canopy adorned with colourful fabrics, its banks of oars rising and falling, casting bright shards of shining water in the sunlight. people passing on the river bank point and wave, smiling, cheering. they see the queen now. they call out. two young men walking arm in arm stare more intently than any; but they do not cheer or wave. there's something chilling in the way they track the distant figure of the queen. they are babington and savage. over this an insistent voice:}

<C>__{elizabeth}

<A>__{wide now we see the carriage and the royal party crest a hill, and there is revealed an awesome sight: the forest has been felled as far as the eye can see. great piles of cut timber dot the ravaged landscape. everywhere men are at work lopping branches from felled trees. wagon teams haul immense trunks away. fires burn stacks of lopped branches, and the smoke rises up into the empty sky. in the carriage on reston's face as he stares at the fires. he speaks half to himself, out of the depths of his own fanatical certainty.}

<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{the honour to be in the presence of my queen, whose radiant beauty is the boast and glory of the english people.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{yes, well, here you are.}
<C>__{aleigh}
<D>__{i'm just returned from the new world, majesty. i have claimed the fertile coast in your name, and called it virginia, in honour of our virgin queen.}
<A>__{elizabeth raises her eyebrows.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{virginia? and if i marry? will you change the name to conjugia?}
<A>__{a royal joke. her entourage laughs dutifully.}
<P>__{(}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{i ask for your gracious permission, majesty, to return to the new world with your royal warrant, to found a colony under the laws and protections of england.}
<A>__{elizabeth's eye has fallen on the native americans.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{who are they?}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{americans, majesty. they long to be your newest subjects.}
<A>__{he beckons calley to lead wanchese and manteo forward.}

<D>__{have they no ruler of their own?}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{none to match england's queen.}
<A>__{elizabeth gazes at the natives. she holds out her hand. unaware that he's meant to kiss the queen's hand, manteo, takes it and shakes it. a gasp from the watching courtiers. but elizabeth accepts the courtesy.}

<D>__{these gentlemen are welcome. see that they're treated well.}

<C>__{raleigh}

<C>__{elizabeth}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{mud and leaves?}
<A>__{aleigh throws open the first basket. don guerau peers inside suspiciously. it does indeed seem to be filled with mud. raleigh takes out a potato beneath the ambassador's nose.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{patata, majesty. you eat it. very nourishing.}
<A>__{he beckons forward the second basket, which is full of leaves. again don guerau tracks his every move. he takes out a tobacco leaf. r}
<C>__{aleigh}
<D>__{tobacco. you breathe its smoke. very stimulating.}
<A>__{now don guerau realises he's being laughed at on all sides. he draws himself up with angry pride, wrinkling his nose.}

<D>__{forgive me, majesty, i find the air has become stale. i am sensitive to the smell of open sewers.}

<C>__{elizabeth}
<P>__{(to raleigh)}
<D>__{continue.}
<A>__{with a broad smile, raleigh gestures forward the third basket. this one really is full of gold. he takes out a gold coin and presents it to elizabeth.}

<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{courtesy of a spanish ship, that found itself unable to complete its journey.}
<A>__{elizabeth drops the gold coin back into the basket.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{the fruits of piracy after all, it seems.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{philip of spain is no friend of england, majesty. the more gold i take from him, the safer you will be.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{well, well. a political pirate. a logic chopping pirate.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{and your majesty's most loyal subject.}

<D>__{i'm glad to have the opportunity to thank you. without your help, i'd still be in outer darkness.}
<C>__{bess}

<C>__{archduke charles}
<D>__{your majesty's beauty is dazzling to my eyes. your learning is famed throughout europe. i see before me perfection in human form. oh, elizabeth! how blessed am i to stand in your fabled presence, warmed by your greatness as by the rays of the sun. oh elizabeth! to speak your name is to hear celestial music. may that sweet sound guide me through my life to come elizabeth! elizabeth! i have travelled here, to this illustrious court, in the hope that our two great nations might be joined in love. but now that i am bathed in the radiance of your glory, i am overwhelmed. i am conquered. i die. only your love, great elizabeth, can restore me to life.}

<A>__{raleigh enters the great hall, trailed by calley, as the dinner gets under way. they join the much larger group who simply stand and watch. royal meals are in part a spectacle for the court. a jester moves from group to group, playing pranks on the guests. raleigh is now dressed in court fashion, and looks very well; as the glances of several court ladies show. he catches bess's eye and they share a smile.}
