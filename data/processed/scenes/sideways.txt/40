<L>__{exterior sanford tasting room day}
<A>__{miles brings the car to a stop in the parking lot. as they get out and walk }
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{so what'd you guys finally decide on for the menu?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i told you. filet and salmon.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{yeah, but how are they making the salmon? poached with a yogurt dill sauce? teriyaki? curry?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't know. salmon. don't you always have white wine with fish?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{oh, jesus. look, at some point we have to find out because it's going to make a big difference.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(taking out his phone)}
<D>__{let me call christine.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{doesn't have to be now. let's go taste.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i owe her a call anyway.}
<A>__{miles must curb his eagerness to go inside the tasting room as jack speed dials.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hey, honey. so we're up here about to taste some whites, and we need to know how the caterers are going to make the salmon.}
<A>__{jack listens, then grows suddenly impatient.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no, i know, i didn't forget, but we wound up at miles's mom's house, and it got really late, and it was hard to call, so i'm calling you now. i said i was sorry. yes, i did.}
<P>__{(to miles)}
<D>__{you heard me say i was sorry, right?}
<A>__{miles just shrugs.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{miles heard me say i was sorry.}
<A>__{as jack gets more and more involved with the phone call, he wanders off across the parking lot, progressively out of earshot.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{give me a break, will you? i just called to find out about the salmon for our wedding to be more involved, like you said and all you want to do is get into it about last night and, okay, i'm sorry. i'm sorry i didn't call. you're totally right. i know, but i'm trying to make this the best wedding i can with the best wine we can find. don't i get any credit for that? okay. look, i've got to go. i'm out here in the parking lot, and miles is waiting for me...}
<A>__{and so it goes, jack's voice rising and falling. miles decides to head inside.}
