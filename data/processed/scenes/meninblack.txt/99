<A>__{edgar rushes outside as the tow truck driver gets the van up on the hoist.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{that's my truck!}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{and make sure you tell them that at the impound.}
<A>__{edgar reaches into the front seat of the van and pulls out his twelve gauge. he points it at the tow truck driver. the tow truck driver looks at him with disdain, and pulling back his shirt reveals a mean looking gun.}
<C>__{driver }
<D>__{i got worse.}
<A>__{he keeps hitching up the van. two pedestrians walk past the dispute, very fast, ignoring the debate, headed right for the shop. we go with them, and realize that it's jay and kay. they stop at the smashed door of the jewelry shop and exchange a glance. kay pulls a very menacing looking weapon, nods, and they step inside.}
