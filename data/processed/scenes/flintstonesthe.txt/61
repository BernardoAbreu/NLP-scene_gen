<C>__{lava}
<D>__{flintstone, that... that's a slap in the face of our founder... our employer... our uncle.}
<P>__{(turning back, another tone)}
<D>__{unless, of course, you agree with rubble... that mister slate isn't capable of running this operation ... that i'm not capable of running it?}

<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{of course not, mister lava. but }
<C>__{lava}

<D>__{... the big everything.}
<A>__{lava smiles, prepares the tips on two cigars. he puts each one in turn in a gizmo on his desk. closer gizmo it's actually a frame supporting a little lizard. the lizard bites the tip off the cigar, practically chokes on it, finally manages to spit it out with difficulty.}
<C>__{lizard}

<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{lava}
<D>__{and others? wellll...}
<A>__{now lava takes out a lighter, leans across the desk. closer lighter as lava works the mechanism, two wooden twigs rub rapidly across each other and ignite.}

<C>__{lava}
<D>__{... now, i know your pal barney had a small part in the preliminary research and development of fibrerock...}
