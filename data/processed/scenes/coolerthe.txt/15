<A>__{shelly escorts bernie over to a nearby bar area. the bartender zips over with some drinks.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{how's the knee?}
<A>__{bernie shrugs. natalie steps up to the bar a few feet away. puts in a drink order. she catches bernie's eye. nods. bernie smiles.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{i was speaking to this orthopedic surgeon over at vegas memorial. he tells me they can replace a man's entire kneecap with titanium. it's the kinda thing that costs a shitload, but since the man's into us for five hundred large, i'm sure we could }
<C>__{bernie}

<D>__{i told you, i'm not gonna be around after sunday.}

<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{seven days, shelly. seven days and i'm out from under.}
<A>__{a beautiful woman in a low cut dress, sashays her way past them, heading for a high rollers craps table. shelly reaches out, napkin in hand, grabs her arm. hands her his card. she snatches it, looks it over. immediately loses all attitude. oh shit.}

<D>__{that's right. i like to know who's shopping it in my neighborhood. you wanna keep working the shangri la, you come see me tomorrow morning in my office. we'll go over the rules together. and before you come, you bring me a clean bill of health. ok?}

<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{all right, get outta here.}
<A>__{she takes off. at the same time natalie leaves with her drink order. they walk in the same direction. shelly mistakes bernie's wandering look for interest in the hooker.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{you want that, bernie? she's yours. anytime. i will keep a tab running for you.}
<P>__{(bernie shakes his head)}
<D>__{what's a matter? not your type?}
<A>__{bernie just stares after natalie, shelly finally picking up on it.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{things are getting hot on fourteen. i gotta go.}
