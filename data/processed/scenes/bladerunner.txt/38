<L>__{interior tunnel night}
<A>__{the moon is up there slicing through the trees, strobing over the hood of the car. the road is getting steeper and the corners sharper. rags of mist skim by as the dusenberg picks up speed. it is becoming a riveting ride, but the passenger's mind moves elsewhere.}
<L>__{exterior woods day}
<A>__{swift, soft clouds overhead. in the cold shine of the icy light,the viewer walks down an aisle of maples and beeches, their clean hard limbs deflecting the frosty light, and underfoot the crisp, blue white snow, melted through in spots, exposing soggy patches of rich brown earth.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{come on, stay with the machine.}
