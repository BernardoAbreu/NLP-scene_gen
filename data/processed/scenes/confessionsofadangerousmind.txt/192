<L>__{interior barris's rolls royce night}
<A>__{barris snorts some coke, pulls out of the studio parking lot. the sound of his heart beating pounds in his ears. another car pulls behind him. a wired barris notices the car in his rearview mirror. he turns. the other car turns also. barris speeds up. so does the other car. barris panics; he tries to lose the other car. a chase ensues. finally barris screeches to a halt, pulls a gun from his glove compartment. the second car screeches to a halt behind him. barris already out of his car and at the driver's side window of the second car. he looks in and sees there are two petrified teenagers, a boy and a girl, holding up their hands. barris pulls open the door.}
