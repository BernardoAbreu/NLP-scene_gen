<L>__{interior apartment few hours later night}
<A>__{the guests are leaving. commotion in the hall, people are saying goodbye to peter and michael. natalie is about to walk out.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{natalie, why don't you stay for a nightcap?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{no, i've gotta get up early...}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(to natalie)}
<D>__{do you care to share a cab?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{oh yes, thanks that's really nice of you...}

<P>__{(smiling}
<D>__{triumphantly;}
<P>__{to peter)}
<D>__{good night, peter.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(with a forced smile)}
<D>__{good night, carl... i will call you sunday, natalie.}
<A>__{she has already left. the door closes on the last of the departing guests.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{so you struck out again with natalie, huh? that carl is a real smooth operator.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{he's an asshole!}
<P>__{(mimicking carl)}
<D>__{'i heard you're not ready yet.' 'we're gonna kick your ass.' well, we may be behind schedule, but we're still going to beat that sonofabitch and maybe i haven't scored with natalie yet, but neither has he. she's not an easy lay, that's what i like about her. you know what they say: it ain't over till it's over.}
<A>__{peter and michael go into the living room. peter is picking up glasses. michael is emptying ashtrays into the wastebasket.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{well, i didn't do so well either i blew it with rosalie. i don't even know how...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{who's rosalie?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{that beauty i managed to swipe from jack. i was about to ask her to stay the night when...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{your old friend sophia appeared and got you involved in a thrilling conversation about modern art, and meanwhile rosalie...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{how could you know that?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{michael, all you want to do is steal jack's girl friends. you don't give a shit about the women themselves...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{that's not true. it's just that sophia drives me crazy. she knows all the right buttons to push to make me mad.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(going into the kitchen)}
<D>__{anyway, it was a great party, everyone had a good time...}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(still in the living}
<D>__{room, shouting to}
<P>__{peter)}
<D>__{terrific... time.}
<A>__{he, too, leaves the living room and runs into jack, who has his arm around clementine's waist as he heads toward his bedroom with her.}
