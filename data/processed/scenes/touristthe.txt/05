<L>__{exterior paris day}
<A>__{the gleaming orient express pulls out of the station and gets underway.}
<L>__{interior orient express afternoon}
<A>__{the train is moving. the thick carpet, the mellow wood of the inlaid panels, the subtlety of the lalique mirrors and the softly lit lamps all inspire a feeling of great luxury. frank looks vaguely out of place, sitting by the window in his casual jeans and pullover sweater. he's wrapped up in a dog eared paperback spy novel. so wrapped up that he barely notices cara sit down opposite him. she crosses her legs. he glances up. slowly, nonchalantly, she takes her coat off. then the headscarf tied around her neck. follow her sensual movements in tight close up. the effect is as if she's performing a tantalizing strip tease. frank is captivated to the point of being unsettled. she takes off her glasses to reveal stunning eyes. she goes to remove her mock turtleneck sweater. the zipper seems to give her trouble. without bothering to struggle she sits up in her seat and leans toward frank.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{i think i'm going to need your help.}
<A>__{frank is barely able to respond.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{hmm?}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{my zipper...}
<P>__{(off his blank look)}
<D>__{it's stuck.}
<A>__{frank finally moves into action. he sets his book down and leans closer. awkwardly he reaches towards cara's beautiful neck. he attempts to unwind the trapped thread of fabric. but the zipper resists.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i'm afraid of hurting you.}
<A>__{she slides forward on her seat, to get even closer.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{don't be afraid.}
<A>__{the train car sways slightly and throws frank off balance. he tugs sharply and the zipper suddenly gives with a tearing sound. frank freezes, looking down at the zipper still in his fingers.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i'm... sorry.}
<A>__{cara's eyes flash fury for a brief moment.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{it doesn't matter.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{maybe i should let you do this }
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{don't give up so quickly.}
<A>__{reluctantly, frank continues with the zipper. the tearing sound continues as he lowers the zipper, inch by inch. first her neck, then her throat, then her cleavage are gradually uncovered. the zipper keeps going downward. no sign of anything underneath. frank is practically sweating. finally he uncovers fabric. he finishes unzipping the sweater and sits back into his seat. cara slides it off her shoulders, sensuous as ever.}
<C>__{cara }
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{and settles back into her seat, cat like. he stares at her for several moments, at a loss for words.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{my name is frank.}
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{cara.}
<A>__{a white jacketed steward arrives.}
<C>__{steward}
<P>__{(to frank)}
<D>__{will you and your wife take dinner here or in the dining car this evening, monsieur?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{pardon me? oh, no. we're not actually }
<C>__{cara}
<D>__{the dining car would be lovely, thank you.}
<A>__{the steward nods and disappears. frank just stares.}
