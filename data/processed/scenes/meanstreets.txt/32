<L>__{interior tony's place corner table night}
<A>__{the italian song "malafemina" (a tango like rythmn) is heard coming from the juke box. it is near closing time and there are only a few customers left in the club, including michael and two gays, benton and sammy, who is getting very drunk. charlie is at the corner table with tony and johnny boy. charlie is washing johnny boy's face with cold water from a basin. some of johnny's blood has mingled with the water.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm surprised at you tone. i mean you've had the place for over a year now. nothing different...same old place...ordinary...flat...no imagination.}
<A>__{tony ignores charlie's half joking, drunken remarks.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(continues)}
<D>__{for instance, the difference between me and you is this...you take that panther back there. i'd put him right up here above the bar...nice cage, you know? nothing ordinary in my place. what good is it? you get robot customers. they come in, drink beer, go to the bathroom, and go home. no sir.}
<A>__{one of the boys more casual acquaintances is lying on the bar, drunk. he begins to sing along with the italian music but very badly.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{see what i mean?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{a question please...'is this what you call living?'}

<A>__{a well dressed young boy enters the club. george, the bouncer, approaches him.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{we're closed.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{i'm just waiting for joey.}
<A>__{the boy walks over to a bar stool and sits down. nobody acknowledges his presence. suddenly the drunk on the bar stops singing and sits up, dazed. his sudden silence causes charlie and the others to look up at him. the drunk stares ahead for a minute.}
<C>__{drunk}
<P>__{(mutters)}
<D>__{i...i gotta go to the bathroom.}
<A>__{everyone laughs.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{well, go ahead, whaddaya want? someone to hold it for you?}
<A>__{more laughter. even the boy at the bar laughs. the drunk rises, still smiling and stumbles off to the mens room. the big bopper "chantilly lace" in playing on the soundtrack. charlie is playing with a deck of cards.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(continuing previous conversation)}
<D>__{this place is dead. if i had a place...every night...lively.}
<A>__{johnny boy is sipping his drink and ignoring the conversation.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and i wouldn't call it tony's place or charlie's place...}
<P>__{(more confidentially)}
<D>__{i'd call it something like season of the witch... get it?}
<C>__{tony}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{you are with out a doubt the biggest, most pretentious bullshit thrower i know. like to see what kind of business you'd do.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{look who's talking. pretentious bullshit. who's the guy with william blake and the tigers, eh?}
<C>__{johnny boy}
<D>__{will you guys shut up with the witches and tigers. tony, you gonna close the place, we get out of here, get something to eat, or what?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{we'll close up as soon as everybody leaves.}
