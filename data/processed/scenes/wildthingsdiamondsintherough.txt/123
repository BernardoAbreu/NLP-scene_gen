<L>__{exterior team clifford buildings later}
<A>__{the new crime scene is alive with activity. cops, reporters, bystanders. morrison sips coffee as paramedics wheel marie's corpse to the ambulance. one of them hands something to morrison. a blood splattered digital video tape.}
<C>__{paramedic}
<D>__{we found this on the body.}
<A>__{morrison takes it without a word...}
<C>__{kristen }
<D>__{just got off the phone with the parole board...}
<A>__{morrison turns around, sees kristen approaching, still visibly shaken.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{they want me to bring elena back to miami in the morning.}
<A>__{she hesitates...}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{i'm... sorry for this whole mess.}
<A>__{morrison considers this, picks his words carefully.}
<C>__{morrison}
<D>__{don't be. it was my gun that fired the shots, so it must've been me who pulled the trigger. i will take the credit on this one. after all the black widow crap i had to put up with, i've earnt it...}
<A>__{kristen nods.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{you did the right thing...}
<C>__{morrison}
<D>__{we did the right thing.}
<A>__{kristen smiles, almost, moves in, and wraps her arms around the detective. he closes his eyes, savors the moment. as she pulls away, she hands him a card.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{you call me, promise?}
<A>__{morrison beams.}
<C>__{morrison}
<D>__{i will. i will.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{now that this is all over, maybe we can have that drink soon...}
<A>__{she leans in, kisses him sweetly on the lips. morrison watches her walk away. in spite of all the shit that's gone down, he's probably the happiest son of a bitch in all of blue bay.}
