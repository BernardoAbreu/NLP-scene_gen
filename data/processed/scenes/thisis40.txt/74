<C>__{realtor }
<D>__{i think this is a really good offer on the house.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{we expected more. i mean, i know it's a bad market but that's still way under what we were looking for.}
<C>__{realtor }
<D>__{i know, but based on the market, it's like you're gaining money. because it's so much more than what you deserve. but these people are from iran and they don't really know that they're offering too much. is there any chance that debbie will go for it?}
