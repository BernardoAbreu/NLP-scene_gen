<A>__{the boys stand in a huge cement access corridor of fenway park. it is empty and quiet as a church. a man walks toward them. they struggle to see. presently, we reveal rocco. he passes them.}

<D>__{come on. the game's starting.}
<A>__{the brothers follow him. red sox emblems are abundant.}
<C>__{rocco }
<D>__{funny thing about the red sox. we never gave up hope, y'know? it's what kept us going all those years. and they did it. they finally fuckin' did it. what are we all gonna do now, huh?}
<A>__{they emerge into the stands. perfect baseball field, empty park.}
<C>__{rocco }
<D>__{i lost a lot of money on 'em. but i gotta admit. always felt better...betting the underdogs.}
