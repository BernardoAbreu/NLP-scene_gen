<D>__{i could easily take your case to the board of regents. you've had no prior infractions and i could argue that you were under abnormal pressure.}

<D>__{but i won't. you embarrassed me, you embarrassed my family, you embarrassed the program. as of now, you are no longer a member of this university or it's football team. clean out your locker.}
<A>__{bobby just stands there a beat, in confusion and disbelief. there is no wavering, no sympathy in winters' eyes. finally, dazed and disoriented, bobby turns and walks out.}
