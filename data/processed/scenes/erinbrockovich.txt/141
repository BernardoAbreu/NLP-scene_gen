<A>__{the tequila's been dipped into. ed and erin are each lying on a couch, staring at documents. late night working.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{erin lemme tell you something. if i'da put three researchers on this, i wouldn't expect them to dig up all the information you got here. this is some damn good work.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{yeah? then gimme another raise.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{hey, i got a staff to pay, plus rent, plus i haven't billed a minute of my time since i started on this case, so you can quit hitting me up like i'm rich or something.}
<A>__{he gets up, grabs his trash can, and moves around the room with it, cleaning up all the chinese food cartons.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{don't give me that. you're gonna get plenty rich off of this, mr. 40 percent. we got those pg&e fuckers by the balls here.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{we've got the pg&e fuckers in hinkley by the balls. but nobody's getting rich unless we can pin this on the corporate pg&e fuckers in san francisco.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{pg&e corporate is claiming they had no way of knowing what was going on in hinkley.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{oh, they knew. they had to know.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{show me the document that proves that.}
<A>__{she doesn't have one.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{then they didn't know. and if they didn't know, we can't hit 'em for punitive damages. and punitive damages is where the money is.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{jesus christ, ed you know, the more i work on this thing, the more i realize what a crock of shit this legal system is. here we got a company that poisoned a whole aquifer that built a pool for a town, then filled it with toxic water andwe're the ones who've gotta bust our ass proving things? that's just not right.}
