<A>__{peter is flat on his back, staring at the stars. he sits up and looks wonderingly at his hands. on the back of his right hand are two puncture wounds surrounded by a faint blue white pulsing glow. the glow disappears.}

<D>__{this is weird. my god, i feel so weird...}
<A>__{he leaps to his feet. he flexes. feels weird. good weird. in fact, great weird! he tries a couple of "jumping jacks" and on the third jump he soars into the air!}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(exhilarated)}
<D>__{very weird.}
<A>__{the great, bespangled, new york city is his backdrop as peter jumps and turns and does loops in the air. with the agility and tactility of a spider, peter leaps from the railing to a wall to a flag pole to another wall where he lands sideways and sticks.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(sideways)}
<D>__{very, very weird.}
<A>__{he leaps off the wall and lands at the edge of the roof. he looks down. no one's looking back. so, he takes a step back and leaps the alley to the next roof.}
