<L>__{exterior new house night}
<A>__{josh pulls up to the house. turns off the car. an old cadillac is sitting in the driveway. josh clambers out of his car and peers in through the window of the cadillac, quizzical.}
<L>__{interior living room, new house night}
<A>__{renai is huddled on the couch in the living room, gripping her knees to her chest. a man is sitting next to her; a handsome, soft spoken anglican priest, father nathanson (40). josh enters. there are subtle changes in his coordination and speech from the booze.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{this is the first line of a joke. guy comes home to find his wife with a priest...}
<A>__{father nathanson stands, as does renai.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{josh, this is liam nathanson. a very old friend of mine.}
<C>__{father nathanson}
<D>__{nice to meet you. i've heard a lot about you.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{can't say i've heard the same, liam. at least i know you're not sleeping with her.}
<C>__{lorraine }
<D>__{don't be rude, josh.}
<A>__{josh turns to see his mother, holding a tray of tea. he frowns.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{what is going on here?}
<C>__{father nathanson}
<D>__{i should be going. thank you so much for the tea.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{thanks, liam.}
<A>__{he clears his throat and exits, quickly and quietly.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{okay, would anyone mind telling me what the hell is going on here?}
<C>__{lorraine}
<A>__{please sit down, joshua.}
<C>__{josh}
<A>__{"joshua?" oh jesus...}
<C>__{lorraine}
<A>__{sit down.}
<C>__{josh}
<A>__{the melodramatic way in which you two are conducting yourselves right now is scaring the shit out of me, so just tell me what's wrong.}
<C>__{lorraine}
<A>__{nothing is wrong. we want to talk.}
<C>__{josh}
<A>__{nobody asks you to sit down unless something is wrong. if a doctor calls you into his office and asks you to sit down, you're fucked.}
<C>__{renai}
<A>__{there's no use, lorraine. he's been drinking.}
<C>__{josh}
<A>__{i have not been drinking. not enough that we can't talk to each other, renai. and don't judge me in that bitchy tone, okay?}
<C>__{renai}
<P>__{(to lorraine)}
<A>__{he would never speak to me like that before.}
<C>__{josh}
<A>__{christ. you're acting like i'm some lush who comes home and beats you with a belt. at least i'm speaking to you. you suddenly have to speak to a priest. or my mother who, up until a couple of weeks ago, you couldn't stand.}
<C>__{renai}
<A>__{you're an asshole.}
<C>__{lorraine}
<A>__{your wife needs you. now sit down and listen to her. i won't ask you again. josh obeys. his mothers tone can still shut him up.}
<C>__{lorraine }
<D>__{go on, renai. tell him.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{this...thing that was in the other house. it followed us.}
<A>__{josh shifts in his seat. agitated.}
<C>__{lorraine}
<D>__{let her speak.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{i saw someone again today. in the house. it looked like a young boy. i followed it into dalton's room... but it wasn't a child.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{this thing is here. i know it.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{so...what? you called in a priest to get rid of it?}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{i didn't know what else to do.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{are you kidding me?}
<P>__{(to lorraine)}
<D>__{was this your idea?}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{no. it was mine.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{you've never been to a church in your life. now you're inviting a priest into our home? i feel like i don't even know you right now.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{i'm scared.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{this is a fantasy, and you need a therapist, not a member of the clergy.}
<C>__{renai}
<P>__{(to lorraine)}
<D>__{i told you...}
<C>__{lorraine}
<D>__{what's happening to renai is real. i've seen it for myself.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i came here today because last night i had a dream about this place.}
