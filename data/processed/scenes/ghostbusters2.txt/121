<C>__{janine}
<P>__{(looking around)}

<D>__{so these dwarfs had a limited partnership in a small mining operation and then one day a beautiful princess came to live with them.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{it's really not a bad place. it just needs a woman's touch.}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{so they bartered room and board in exchange for housekeeping services, which was a good deal for all of them because then they didn't have to withhold tax and social security, which i'm not saying is right but it's just a story, so i guess it's all right. i can finish this later if you're tired.}
<A>__{louis goes into the bedroom and puts the baby down.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{you're really good with children, louis. i can tell.}
<P>__{(as he returns)}
<D>__{why don't you come here and sit with me?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{he sits stiffly beside her on the sofa.}
<C>__{janine}
<P>__{(getting close)}
<D>__{motherhood is a very natural instinct for me. i'd like to have a baby myself. wouldn't you?}
<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(gulps)}
<D>__{tonight?}
