<D>__{tran and jeriko weren't getting along. he was afraid jeriko was getting ready to dump him, but he wasn't sure, so he started with the surveillance. a couple nights ago he wires up iris and sends her and the other girl, diamanda, over to jeriko's table.}

<A>__{two nights ago, iris, wearing a wig, leaves tran's table with diamanda and moves toward... a booth in the retinal fetish where jeriko one sits with replay. iris stands over jeriko for just a moment. then he nods, smiles a little, and moves over to make room for her in the booth right next to him.}
