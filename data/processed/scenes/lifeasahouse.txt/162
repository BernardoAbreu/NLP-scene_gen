<A>__{the door opens and robin, adam, ryan and peter are greeted by guster, who bounces around like a wired rabbit.}
<C>__{robin}

<A>__{adam runs to robin for a kiss, then grabs peter with a hug.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{goodnight.}

<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i guess i could teach you some things.}

<A>__{robin sneaks a quick kiss on ryan's cheek as he heads for the stairs. after he's gone, robin turns back to peter.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i hardly recognize you with a beard.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{that was my plan...to be hardly recognizable to you as me.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i feel in love with george again.}
<A>__{peter nods, something he already knows.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i will see you tomorrow.}
<A>__{robin nods. there's a moment where it's clear that peter doesn't want to leave and robin doesn't want him to leave, but after the moment passes, peter walks out and robin sits down at the base of the stairs.}
