<D>__{get back here you gutless shit ...}
<A>__{a shape suddenly out of nowhere, looms up fast behind bunny, running at him. junior, insane now with fear, runs smack into a tree, knocked senseless and reeling to the ground. bunny turning back too late. the crazy drug high shape is yelling something like:}
<C>__{nva soldier}
<D>__{diiiiikaaeeeeeee!}
<A>__{and jumps right into the hole blasting bunny point blank in the chest. bunny struggling to consciousness at the bottom of the hole. thuck! a boot in the gaping hole where his chest was. bunny, his eyes uncomprehending. a muzzle is jammed into his mouth, breaking his teeth with an ugly sound. another yell from the nva trooper. a flash of orange red light. bunny's face blown to bits. junior, dizzy from the blow to his head, looks up. a yellow flare somewhere out there and a shadow above him digging a bayonet into his belly with a grunt. a long oozing sigh of belly gas. an explosion. the shadow with the bayonet staggering blind without eyes, holding his brains with his hands. barnes throws open the empty laaw rocket casing he has just fired off and charges forward with a yell, cutting down another nva in bunny's old foxhole. jumping into the hole, the bottom of which is a liquid pit of guts, blood, ooze. another enemy running in on him. a short burst of fire. barnes hit. firing into each other. barnes draggin him down into the pit with him, grappling alongside the corpse of bunny. barnes uses an entrenching tool to finish him off.}
