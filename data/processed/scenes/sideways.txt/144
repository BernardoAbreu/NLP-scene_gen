<A>__{the room boasts not only a large tasting bar but also display after display of t shirts, golf shirts, olive oils, chocolate sauces and other gourmet tourist items emblazoned with the winery's logo. in the corner an acoustic guitarist with a small amp plays soothing windham hill ish music. the tasting bar is packed three deep with tasters attended to by harried pourers. finally the pourer gets to their glasses. miles chews a sip and swallows, then downs the rest in a single gulp.}
