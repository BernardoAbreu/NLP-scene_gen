<A>__{some creatures are crawling under the rigs, when they reach the mall doors they cannot stand, so they have no leverage. the creatures inside are pushing the doors out, so the zombies under the trucks cannot push them in. the doors swing both in and out, so it is very clear that some access could be had by the creatures if they were more organised. one creature, having crawled under a trailer, does manage to push open a mall door. the thing crawls into the building through the legs of other ghouls which are trying to exit. they behave as a swarm of insects. the revolving door offers the best access for the creatures, although its inherent complexity is baffling to their empty brains. two creatures do manage to crawl under the truck which blocks the revolving door, and one of them negotiates the rotating action and enters the concourse.}
