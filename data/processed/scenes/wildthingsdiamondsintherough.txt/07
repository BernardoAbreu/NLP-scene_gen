<L>__{interior clifford mansion hallway day}
<A>__{marie makes her way down the sleek white corridors inside the opulent clifford mansion, past framed family photos, of jay, marie and the late julie...}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{jay?}
<A>__{he's nowhere to be found. frustrated, marie finds herself alone in the kitchen. she angrily selects a bottle of champagne, pops the cork. before she can swig any alcohol she hears raised voices.}
<C>__{jay }
<D>__{it simply can't be done...}
<A>__{marie tentatively edges out of the kitchen, back into the hallway, and down towards jay's study...}
<D>__{jay (o.s.) (cont'd) in all construction there's delays.}
<A>__{marie sidles up to the door jam, peaks through the crack. what she sees makes the blood run cold in her veins... an imposing cuban businessman, mr. barajas, stands threateningly over a visibly frightened jay. another man, cicatriz, dressed in designer silks, stands menacingly in the corner, clearly the brawn of this little operation.}
<C>__{mr. barajas}
<D>__{four months is not a delay. it's a disaster.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{you have my word, mr. barajas, the building is almost finished. just give me a week, two tops.}
<A>__{barajas nods to cicatriz, who moves in on jay with lightning quickness, holds a razor sharp knife against his thumb.}
<C>__{mr. barajas}
<D>__{we are long past the negotiation stage.}
<A>__{cicatriz runs the steel blade across jay's thumb. marie has to cover her mouth from screaming as she sees a trickle of blood stain the spotless white carpet.}
<C>__{mr. barajas }
<D>__{for every day the building goes unfinished, we'll take a finger...}
<A>__{a sinister grin stretches across cicatriz's lips.}
<C>__{cicatriz}
<D>__{pray, mr. clifford, you finish before the eleventh day...}
<A>__{and with that the cuban men head to the door. marie scrambles away, her heart pounding... she's halfway down the hallway when mr. barajas and cicatriz exit jay's study. she turns, tries to look innocent as the cuban 'businessmen' stare her down. jay appears in the doorway, sweat cascading from his brow.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{marie! shouldn't you be with your friends?}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{i was just...}
<A>__{cicatriz takes a step towards her.}
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(to marie)}
<D>__{i will be right there. with your gift... just... wait outside, ok?}
<A>__{marie backs away, never taking her eyes off the intimidating cuban men...}
