<A>__{as dawn breaks over the river, find gordy sitting in a motored panga being steered by a local boatman. gordy reaches into a pocket and pulls out the photo of anne and matt. he looks at it for a few moments. then pockets it again. same scene later the panga passes a dead body floating downstream. same scene later the panga passes revolutionary banners and signs lining the riverbank.}
