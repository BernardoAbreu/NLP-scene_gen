<A>__{a huge drum sounds three times and the chanting stops. the silence is chilling as another robed figure appears out of the some on the altar. this is mola ram, the high priest of the thugge cult. mola ram's red rimmed eyes glare from the sunken sockets in his sinister face. here is a man who looks as vile and diabolic as the unholy goddess rising behind him. up in the wind tunnel, indy stares down at the high priest and realizes that is was mola ram he saw conferring with chattar lal in the palace garden. as the drum booms three times more, mola ram lifts one arm up from his emaciated body and suddenly there is a scream! all heads turn toward an unfortunate, struggling indian begin dragged out by priests. the man's face and body are wildly painted. he screams again as he's tied onto a square iron frame laying atop a large flat stone. mola ram steps forward to the stretched out victim and the indian looks up into the high priest's grotesque face suddenly mola ram's hand shoots out toward the man's chest and pierces it! the high priests hand sinks into the victim's writing body and rips out his living heart!}
