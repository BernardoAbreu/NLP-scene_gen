<L>__{interior margo's bedroom night}
<A>__{it's january. the bed is littered with fur coats. through the open door, from the floor below, the murmur of a party at a late hour. no hilarity.}
<C>__{karen's voice}
<D>__{it's always convenient at a party to know the hostess well enough to use her bedroom rather than go where all the others have to go...}
<A>__{karen is making repairs at margo's dressing table. eve enters, carrying a magnificent sable coat which she drops on the bed.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{now who's show up at this hour? it's time people went home hold that coat up...}
<P>__{(eve holds it up; karen whistles)}
<D>__{... whose is it?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{some hollywood movie star, her plane got in late.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{discouraging, isn't it? women with furs like that where it never gets cold...}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{hollywood.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{tell me, eve how are things with you? happy?}
<A>__{eve melts into warmth. she beams, sits on the bed. karen has spun around on the dressing table stool.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{there should be a new word for happiness. being here with miss channing has been i just can't say, she's been so wonderful, done so much for me }
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{lloyd says margo compensates for underplaying on the stage by overplaying reality...}
<P>__{(she gets up, gets her coat)}
<D>__{... next to that sable, my new mink seems like an old bedjacket...}
<P>__{(throws it over her shoulder)}
<D>__{... you've done your share, eve. you've worked wonders with margo...}
<A>__{she starts out.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(hesitantly)}
<D>__{mrs. richards.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(pauses, smiles)}
<D>__{karen.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{karen...}
<P>__{(she picks at the coverlet)}
<D>__{... isn't it awful, i'm about to ask you for another favor after all you've already done.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(crosses to her)}
<D>__{nobody's done so much, eve, you've got to stop thinking of yourself as one of the hundred neediest cases... what is it?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{well... miss channing's affairs are in such good shape... there isn't enough to keep me as busy as i should be, really not that i've ever considered anything that would take me away from her... but the other day when i heard mr. fabian tell miss channing that her understudy was going to have a baby, and they'd have to replace her...}
<A>__{she looks down at the coverlet once more.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{... you want to be margo's new understudy.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i don't let myself think about it, even }
<P>__{(she looks up, rises as she speaks)}
<D>__{ but i do know the part so well, and every bit of the staging, there'd be no need to break in a new girl }
<P>__{(suddenly afraid, she sits)}
<D>__{ but suppose i had to go on one night? to an audience that came to see margo channing. no, i couldn't possibly...}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{don't worry too much about that. margo just doesn't miss performances. if she can walk, crawl or roll she plays.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(nods proudly)}
<D>__{the show must go on.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{no, dear. margo must go on.}
<P>__{(she sits beside eve)}
<D>__{as a matter of fact, i see no reason why you shouldn't be margo's understudy...}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{do you think miss channing would approve?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i think she would cheer.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{but mr. richards and mr. sampson }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{they'll do as they're told.}
<A>__{eve smiles a little. a pause.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{then would you talk to mr. fabian about it?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{you won't forget it?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i won't forget.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i seem to be forever thanking you for something, don't i?}
<A>__{she hugs karen, leaves. she nearly collides with birdie on her way in.}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{the bed looks like a dead animal act. which one is sables?}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{but she just got here...}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{she's on her way. with half the men in the jointerior}
<P>__{(she hold up the coat)}
<D>__{it's only a fur coat...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what did you expect live sables?}
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{a diamond collar, gold sleeves you know, picture people...}
<A>__{they start out.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{bill says actors out there eat just as infrequently as here }
<C>__{birdie}
<D>__{they can always grab oranges off trees. this you can't do in times square...}
<A>__{through the open door, we see them go down the stairs and out of sight.}
