<L>__{exterior college campus night}
<A>__{stunningly quiet. we are on a placid campus looking at the dignified architecture of breitrose hall. moving in we focus on a large poster advertising "the alexander lectures, spring 1995". we skim the listings (jon else on the nuclear agony, dr. andrew miksztal on biological ethics, etc.) until we settle on...}

<A>__{may 17}
<L>__{interior auditorium breitrose hall night}
<A>__{a large screen dominates the auditorium stage. on the screen is a slide of an engraving from the middle ages showing a madman in apparent agony, his mouth shaped to a scream, as he is restrained by peasants. the projector zooms slowly in on the agonized face of this madman as we hear railly's voice lecturing.}
<C>__{railly's voice }
<D>__{according to the accounts of local officials at that time, this gentleman, judged to be about forty years of age, appeared suddenly in the village of wyle near stonehenge in the west of england in april of 1162. using unfamiliar words and speaking in a strange accent, the man made dire prognostications about a pestilence which he predicted would wipe out humanity in approximately 8oo years. deranged and hysterical, the man raped a young woman of the village, was taken into custody, but then mysteriously escaped and was not heard of again.}
<A>__{we discover railly, six years older now, standing at a lectern in a pool of light. she's dwarfed by the giant screen where the engraving is replaced by a series of slides of woodcuts showing scenes of pestilence in the middle ages as she lectures to an audience of mostly scholarly types.}
<C>__{railly }
<D>__{in 1841, mackay wrote, "during seasons of great pestilence, men have often believed the prophecies of crazed fanatics, that the end of the world was come." obviously, this plague doomsday scenario is considerably more compelling when reality supports it in some form, whether it's the bubonic plague, smallpox, or aids. in addition to these "natural" contagions, there are now technological horrors as well: besides radiation, consider our lurking fear of germ warfare and its close approximation, chemical warfare, which first reared its ugly head in the deadly mustard gas attacks during the first world war.}
<A>__{on the screen, a series of slides show images of world war i soldiers in gas masks, in death throes, etc..}
<C>__{railly's voice }
<D>__{during such an attack in the french trenches in october, 1917, we have an account of this soldier...}
<A>__{on the screen, a slide of an old deteriorated photograph shows jose, the puerto rican kid, strapped to a stretcher, being carried by soldiers through the trenches during an attack. jose appears to be ranting madly as the projector zooms closer on his face until the image approximates munch's famous painting.}
<C>__{railly's voice }
<D>__{ who, during an assault, was wounded by shrapnel and hospitalized behind the lines where doctors discovered he had lost all comprehension of french but spoke english fluently, albeit in a regional dialect they didn't recognize. the man, although physically unaffected by the gas, was hysterical. he claimed he had come from the future, that he was looking for a pure germ that would ultimately wipe mankind off the face of the earth in the year... 1995!}
<A>__{the audience gives a nervous chuckle. on the screen, a different old photograph of jose. this time he's in a military hospital, gaunt, haunted, very ill.}
<C>__{railly's voice }
<D>__{although seriously injured, the young soldier disappeared from the hospital before more data could be gathered. no doubt, he was trying to carry on his mission to warn others, substituting for the agony of war...a self inflicted agony we call the "cassandra complex".}
<A>__{as railly continues, we scan the audience and discover marilou martin, railly's friend, and marilou's husband, wayne chang, both listening attentively. further away, another man listens intently. a man with shoulder length carrot colored hair. his name is dr. peters.}
<C>__{railly }
<D>__{cassandra, in greek legend you will recall, was condemned to know the future but to be disbelieved when she foretold it. hence, the agony of foreknowledge combined with impotence to do anything about it.}
