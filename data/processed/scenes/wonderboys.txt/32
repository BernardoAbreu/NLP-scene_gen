<A>__{as grady arrives, crabtree withdraws his hand delicately and james' eyes flutter open .briefly, ..then close.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{is that just beer?}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{primarily. although i gather you two staged a little raid on the crabtree pharmacopoeia. you missed a few bottles, by the way.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i'm sure. where is everyone?}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{sara and walter declined. guess they wanted to go home and curl up on the couch with the dog.}
<A>__{grady cuts james a glance, trying to determine if he's copped on poe, but james is winking out. his head drifts back against the wail, settles with a gentle ...thunk.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{jesus. he's out.}
<A>__{crabtree glances over, nods.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{he has a book.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i know. he started it fall semester.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{he finished it winter break.}
<A>__{grady looks up, unable to disguise his surprise. he glances at james' slack face tilted against the wall.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{so. is he any good?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{no. not yet he isn't.}
<C>__{crabtree}

<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{he is. take my word for it.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{i think it's more complicated than that. besides, he's a little...scattered. he almost ...did something stupid tonight. at least, i think so. anyway, he doesn't need sexual confusion thrown into the stew right now.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{on the contrary, it 'could be just the ticket.}
<C>__{waitress}
<P>__{(ducking in)}
<D>__{double dickel.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{grady notices the waitress's nametag (oola) and realizes she is conspicuously pregnant. he watches her disappear beyond the blur of bodies on the dancefloor, where hannah green's slinky form seizes his attention.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{no sexual confusion there, eh, professor?}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{shut up and drink.}
<A>__{crabtree grins, brings his bottle up, then stops.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{oh my goodness. do you see what i see?}
<A>__{grady follows crabtree's glance and finds oola again, but it's not oola crabtree is eyeing, it's her customer.}
<C>__{grady}
<D>__{president of the james brown hair club for men.}
<A>__{sitting alone in the dark booth is a small black man with big hands, a face peppered with scar tissue, and most noticeably a tsunami of hair sprouting from his scalp.}

<P>__{(initiating an old game)}
<D>__{he's a boxer. a flyweight.}
<C>__{crabtree}
<D>__{huh uh. a jockey. his name's, um, curtis.. .curtis hardapple.}
