<L>__{interior leo solomon's office day}
<A>__{sydney enters.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{leo, you wanted to see me?}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{so there i was, thinking maybe i should give sydney a call. she's new in town, doesn't know many people...}
<A>__{leo produces a copy of the morning paper, which has a photo of shepherd and sydney dancing.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{leo }
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{then i picked up the times }
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{it was crazy. he called me at home.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{nothing. it was innocent. his cousin got the flu at the last minute.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{did you sleep with him?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{did you sleep }
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{that's none of your business, leo.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{yeah, it is, sydney.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{you wanna tell me how my personal life in any way }
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{because when it's the president, it's not personal. sydney, i hired your reputation. i hired a pit bull, not a prom queen.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{that's unfair.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{it's incredibly unfair. but you've spent a lot of time over the year telling me the trouble with the environmental lobby is that we don't understand the fundamental truth that politics is perception. this is a bad time to develop ignorance.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{you're making way too much of this.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{am i? this is your time, sydney. you're sitting at the grown ups' table. you have a chance to get everything you want run a national campaign, be a major player inside the party. but this relationship had better go all the way, because with the leader of the free world there is no halfway. politics is perception, and if thing don't work out, the amount of time it'll take you to go from being a hired gun to a cocktail party joke can be clocked with an egg timer.}
<A>__{there's a quick knock at the door leo's secretary steps in with a strange looking package.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{leo, there is no relationship. it was one night. it's done.}
<C>__{leo's secretary}
<D>__{mr. solomon, this was just delivered by white house messenger. it's marked "perishable."}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{the white house has sent me something perishable?}
<C>__{leo's secretary}
<D>__{it's for ms. wade.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{here we go...}
<A>__{sydney begins unwrapping the package.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{relax, leo. i'm sure it's just a formality.}
<C>__{leo's secretary}
<P>__{(exited)}
<D>__{it's from him.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{of course it's from him.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{so he had some staff flunky send me a fruit basket.}
<C>__{leo's secretary}
<D>__{he wrote the note himself.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i'm sure he didn't take the time to }
<C>__{leo's secretary}
<D>__{the messenger said he was waiting in the oval office for ten minutes while the president wrote the card.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{okay, listen, so he }
<P>__{(to leo's secretary)}
<D>__{ it took him ten minutes to write a card?!}
<C>__{leo's secretary}
<D>__{apparently he went through several drafts.}
<A>__{sydney can't stifle her laugh she sees what the gift is.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{what is it...what is it?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{a ham.}
<C>__{leo}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{a ham?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{he sent me a virginia ham.}
<C>__{leo's secretary}
<D>__{dig it, ms. wade. you're the president's girlfriend.}
<A>__{sydney's smile fades away...she looks at leo.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{there's never an egg timer around when you need one.}
