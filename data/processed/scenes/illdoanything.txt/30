<D>__{go very slow.}
<A>__{music in... burke steels himself and exits the car.}
<L>__{exterior movie theatre late day}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{we're 34 minutes late. the studio is appropriately wild... people are beginning to leave... but i knew how upset you'd be if we started without you.}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(distantly)}
<D>__{yeah. thanks.}
<A>__{but he pays her no mind as music continues and he moves towards the line. nan approaches the car.}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{how is he tonight?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i don't know him, so i have nothing to compare it to.}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{well, how would you say he is, anyway?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{not quite himself.}
<B>__{angle on burke}
<A>__{as he approaches the line, he begins to sing his love to them, "i will do anything." as he pours out his misdirected heart to individuals on the line who do not hear him.}
<B>__{angle on line}
<A>__{their impatience gives rise to a very slow tap dance, each couple or cluster doing it differently barely exaggerating the normal shifting of a line... as burke continues to sing... the song builds as does the dance... burke sings even more passionately, his d people perhaps joining in as background singers. at a key point, the disparate groups turn and form a solid unified line. they begin the rhythmic clapping of impatience having become a line, they now threaten to become a mob. burke sings one more joe cocker like passionate plea before turning to camera to shout over the mayhem:}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{let them in.}
<A>__{as they enter.}
