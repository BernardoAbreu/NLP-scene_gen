<A>__{jacob nods, yes.}
<C>__{malee }
<D>__{only him. i was gonna go and visit him at the hospital. you want to come?}
<A>__{jacob doesn't answer. he is preoccupied with watching a truck pour cement into the foundation where kenny is buried. it's a bittersweet moment. while relieved by the fact that his crime will be hidden, the guilt overwhelms him.}
<C>__{malee }
<D>__{earth to jacob. you coming?}
<C>__{jacob}

<A>__{malee eyes jacob, sensing that something is wrong.}
<C>__{malee }
<D>__{are you okay?}
