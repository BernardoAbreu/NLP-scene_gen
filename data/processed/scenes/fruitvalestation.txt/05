<A>__{oscar and tatiana walk to the downstairs entrance of a two story house. a picture of an apple tree is painted next to the door. oscar squats down to her level and brushes down a frizz in her hair. he looks back at the car. we see that sophina is adjusting her make up in the fold down mirror. oscar turns to tatiana. he then takes her hand, and places something inside of it. tatiana looks down into her hand and we see that it is a small bag of fruit snacks. she looks up at oscar with a bright eyed expression. but oscar quickly places his finger over his lips. tatiana nods in agreement, trying to hold back a huge smile. she gives him a swift kiss on the cheek. he stands up and knocks on the front door. mrs. stacy a motherly looking black woman in her 50's opens the door.}
