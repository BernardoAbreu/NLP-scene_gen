<A>__{beverly sits with picard and riker.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{the more i studied his dna the more confusing it got. finally i could only come to one conclusion... shinzon was created with temporal rna sequencing. he was designed so that at a certain point his aging process could be accelerated to reach your age more quickly, so he could replace you.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{but the romulans abandoned the plan...}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{as a result the temporal sequencing was never activated. remember, he was supposed to replace you at nearly your current age. he was engineered to skip thirty years of life. but since the rna sequencing was never activated, his cellular structure has started to break down. he's dying.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{dying?}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{he wasn't designed to live a complete, human life span. plcard can anything be done for him?}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{not without a complete myelodysplastic infusion from the only donor with compatible dna. but that would mean draining all your blood.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{that's why he went to all that trouble to capture you. plcard how long does he have?}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{i can't be sure but the rate of decay seems to be accelerating.}
<A>__{picard considers this.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{then he'll come for me as a donor.}
