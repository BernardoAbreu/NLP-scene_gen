<A>__{suddenly the window behind kara explodes. she screams, recoiling. then the window in front of her. hands reach through. tommy shoves her out of the way. another hand shoots through the stained glass window in the front door, twists open the lock. danny races across the lobby and up the stairs. robed figures fill the doorways. climbing through windows. moving inside the house. surrounding loomis.}
<C>__{loomis}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{wynn!!!}
<A>__{the robed figures descend on loomis. drops his .357. tommy lurches for it, to no avail. loomis's scream fills the darkness like a fever dream.}

<A>__{kara trips and falls. a pair of silver tipped black boots planted in bold stance. slowly she looks up the long duster, the cigarette in the gloved hand of the nefarious stranger dr. wynn! danny stands by his side, staring dispassionately.}
<C>__{kara}
<D>__{danny, no ... please ...}
<A>__{kara picks herself up, shaking her head in unmitigated fear, staggering back down the hallway. she turns to see the black figures overtaking tommy. his screams swallowed by hollow darkness. alone, kara careens through another doorway into tommy's apartment kara slams the door, turns in desperate circles. stepping out from behind the door is mrs. blankenship the baby bundled in her arms!}
<C>__{kara}
<D>__{mrs. blankenship oh, god hurry. we have to }
<A>__{as kara reaches for the baby, the old woman raises a dagger. her eyes burning. her wrist branded with the mark of thorn! kara screams. the old woman opens the door, allowing the figures to enter the room. daggers drawn. chanting a dark invocation. the coven forces kara backwards. nowhere to run. nowhere to hide. suddenly kara makes a decision and takes a running leap toward the window!}
