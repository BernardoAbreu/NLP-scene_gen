<L>__{int faro table day}
<A>__{as wyatt walks up tyler starts snarling at one of the players:}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{you back that queen again, you son of a bitch, i will blow you right out of that chair!}
<P>__{(looks up, sees wyatt)}
<D>__{somethin' on your mind?}
<C>__{wyatt}

<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{that a fact?}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{yeah. it's a fact.}
<A>__{tyler looks wyatt over, noting he is unarmed. he stands, sneering:}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{for a man that don't go heeled you run your mouth kinda reckless.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{don't need to go heeled to get the bulge on a dub like you.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{that a fact?}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{yeah. it's a fact.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{well i'm real scared.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{damn right you're scared. i can see it in your eyes.}
<A>__{wyatt steps forward suddenly, eyes cold and hard like a shark. suddenly realizing he's in way over his head. tyler shrinks back reflexively, his hand moving toward his gun. the other players scatter. wyatt nods, his voice calm and steady:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{go ahead. skin it. skin that smoke wagon and see what happens.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{listen mister, i'm getting' tired }
<A>__{wyatt abruptly slaps his face, making his teeth clack together.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{i'm getting tired of your gas. jerk that pistol and go to work.}
<A>__{tyler goes pale, all pretense of courage gone. wyatt slaps him again.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{i said throw down, boy.}
<A>__{another slap. tyler stays frozen, blood dripping down his chin.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{you gonna do something or just stand there and bleed?}
<A>__{tyler's done. wyatt plucks his gun away, handing it to joyce.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{no, i didn't think so. here, milt. keepsake, hang it over the bar. all right, youngster. out you go...}
<A>__{wyatt takes tyler by the ear, dragging him across the room like an unruly child. at the door he gives the ear a twist.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{and don't come back. ever.}
<A>__{tyler winces. wyatt shoves him out into the street then turns to joyce casually:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{see how easy that was?}
