<B>__{night}
<A>__{aaron is little more than a shadowy silhouette as he peers into the night through a partly opened shutter. suddenly the room leaps alight as lucy opens an inner door and enters, holding a lighted lamp. aaron closes the shutter, spins on her angrily.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{lucy!}
<A>__{martha crosses the room swiftly and blows out the lamp. in the brief moment the room has been lighted, we see that lucy is carrying a dark shawl in one hand; that ben is crouched at another window rifle ready; and that deborah is on her feet standing like a child who is being dressed.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i'm sorry... i couldn't find the shawl...}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{hurry, martha... moon's fixin' to rise...}
<A>__{he cautiously swings the shutters open. a pale light filters into the room. we see martha wrapping the shawl around deborah.}
<C>__{martha}
<P>__{(softly to the child)}
<D>__{we're going to play the sleep out game... remember?... where you hide out with grandma?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{where's she buried?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{and you'll go along the ditch very quietly like a...}
<P>__{(her voice breaks)}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{like a little mouse.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{now!}
<A>__{he reaches for the child, but he has to wait for martha's last embrace.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{there!... and you won't come back or make a sound... no matter what you hear? promise!... no matter what?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i promise... wait!}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{child, child!}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{can't i have topsy to keep me company?}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{there's no time...}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{here she is, baby... baby...}
<A>__{aaron takes the child, swings her out the window.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{down low go!}
<A>__{martha would come to the window to look out, but aaron bars her with an arm and draws back to the side of the window to watch her go... outside the little dog barks a welcome and presumably starts to follow the girl. aaron reacts.}
<C>__{aaron}
<P>__{(hoarse whisper)}
<D>__{here dog... here!}
<A>__{the dog whines but obeys. aaron continues watching the child's course unconsciously imitating her every run and twist... then he smiles and we may see the brightness in the corners of his eyes.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{she reached the ditch...}
<A>__{he closes the shutters and turns and his arms go around martha, weeping soundlessly.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{she'll be all right, mother... she'll be all right.}
