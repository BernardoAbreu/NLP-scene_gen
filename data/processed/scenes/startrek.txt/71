<D>__{let me guess: study of alien languages: phonology, morphology, syntax it means you've got a talented tongue.}
<C>__{uhura}
<D>__{and for a moment i thought you were just a dumb hick who only has sex with farm animals.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{well. not only.}
<C>__{uhura}
<D>__{you think you're smart.}
<C>__{kirk}

<D>__{this guy bothering you?}
<C>__{uhura}
<D>__{beyond belief, but nothing i can't handle.}
<C>__{kirk}

<A>__{the burly cadet spins kirk around:}
<C>__{burly cadet}
<D>__{hey. you mind your manners.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{at ease, cup cake, it was a joke. like your hairline.}
<A>__{uhura turns back. the other cadets, seeing trouble, approach.}
<C>__{uhura}
<D>__{hey jim: enough.}
<C>__{burly cadet}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{you heard me, moon beam.}

<D>__{you know how to count farm boy? there's five of us... and one of you.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{okay, so go get some more guys, come back and it'll be an even fight.}
<A>__{the cadet swings his fist but kirk headbutts his hand, breaking it another cadet punches kirk, then throws him into a table, which kirk flies over, landing hard another cadet grabs him, pulls him up kirk slams five fast punches that send the cadet back when another cadet punches him yet another holds kirk and that last punch is repeated three then four times }
<C>__{uhura}
<D>__{enough! stop!}
<A>__{another punch and kirk flies to the floor he's out of it, but won't give up. the cadets unleash on him and really pummel him and kirk's spirited, but losing about to lose bad when an ear splitting whistle makes everything stop they turn standing in the doorway is a tall, rugged starfleet officer }
<B>__{captain christopher pike.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{outside, all of you! now!}
<A>__{the cadets file out, in for it. pike moves to a dazed, semi conscious kirk, now upside down on a table.}
<C>__{pike }
<D>__{y'alright, son?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{you can... whistle really loud, y'know that?}
<A>__{ and kirk passes out.}
