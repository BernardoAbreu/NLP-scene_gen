<L>__{interior bunnymund's warren day moments later}
<A>__{close up on a flower, that opens to reveal an egg. the egg stands up wobbly on its spindly little legs. we pull out to reveal sophie and bunny's faces looking on, sophie amazed, bunny proud.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{you wanna paint some eggs? yeah?}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{okay!}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{come on then!}
<A>__{we pull out further to reveal a massive stone spire, covered in moss, as thousands of unpainted eggs stream down the side of it toward a green meadow. north and jack stand in the midst of it all, slack jawed, as the eggs rush towards them.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{rimsky korsakov! that's a lot of eggs.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{uh, how much time do we have?}
<B>__{a green meadow}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{weeeeee!}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{woooohoooo!}
<A>__{bunny hops into view, sophie clinging to his back smiling, leading a huge mass of eggs down a wide path. as he passes, flowers bloom on either side in his wake, blasting the passing eggs with color as they go.}
<C>__{bunnymund }
<D>__{alright troops, it's time to push back. that means eggs! everywhere! guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 82.}
<B>__{the sorting stones}
<A>__{north looks out over the eggs as they get sorted.}
<C>__{north}
<P>__{(walla)}
<D>__{single file!}
<A>__{sophie, on her back, is carried by the eggs through the sorting stones. she giggles as north waves at her while she passes by.}
<C>__{bunnymund }
<D>__{heaps of you in every high rise, farm house and trailer park!}
<A>__{baby tooth flies across the screen, diverting our attention to a multicolored stream off in the distance.}
<C>__{bunnymund }
<D>__{in tennis shoes and cereal bowls!}
<A>__{baby tooth joins an elf, who stands alongside an egg at the edge of a cliff. the elf pushes the egg over the cliff, into the stream, and celebrates with a victory dance.}
<C>__{bunnymund }
<D>__{oh, there will be bathtubs filled with my beautiful googies!}
<A>__{the elf turns just in time to see a stampede of colored eggs come barreling toward him. they knock him off the cliff as he and the eggs spill into the multi colored stream below.}
<B>__{a sparkling stream}
<A>__{colored eggs wade through the water, emerging with secondary colors and intricate patterns of all kinds. an unlucky egg veers off and gets stuck in a whirlpool. we see a hand fish it out to reveal north, who looks at the egg curiously. it's now got a spiral pattern on it and its little legs kick madly.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{okay, that's little strange.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{naw, mate }
<A>__{bunny's surrounded by butterflies and cute little eggs.}
<D>__{guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 83.}
<C>__{bunnymund }
<D>__{that's adorable.}
<A>__{as a technicolored elf climbs out of the stream, north sets the egg down and lets it rejoin the herd.}
<B>__{a green meadow}
<A>__{as sophie leads a parade of eggs, bunny jumps to an adjacent rock and sits up to address the eggs as they walk in stride. meanwhile, jack rides atop a group of sentinel egg that are marching in the back ground.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{there will be springtime! on every continent! and i'm bringing hope with me!}
<A>__{a green meadow continuous close on: a line of eggs running down curled vines as yetis sprinkle them with glitter. they continue on down various vine corkscrew like shoots, decorating the eggs with stripes. a confused elf emerges from the vines, striped with paint and walks off. a green meadow continuous the striped elf walks past a yeti, painting a mound of eggs red. bunny enters frame and hops across the screen.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{too christmas y, mate, paint `em blue.}
<A>__{the yeti throws its arms up in defeat and tosses the eggs. a green meadow moments later a beautifully painted egg hides in the grass.}
<C>__{bunnymund }
<D>__{oh, what's over there?}
<A>__{sophie appears, spots the egg, and delicately lifts it out of the grass. she holds it close to admire the intricate detail of its shell. sophie brings the egg to bunny for him to inspect.}
<D>__{guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 84.}
<C>__{bunnymund }
<D>__{that's a beauty!}
<A>__{bunny takes sophie by the hand and leads her through a stone archway.}
<C>__{bunnymund }
<D>__{now all we gotta do is get him and his little mates through the tunnels, to the top, and we'll have ourselves easter.}
<B>__{the streams of colored eggs}
<A>__{bunny looks out proudly at the eggs gathered in front of the tunnels in the distance. jack approaches from behind and makes his way alongside bunny, who holds sophie in his arms. its our first real vista of the whole warren. it's a spectacular sight.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{not bad.}
<A>__{sophie yawns and begins to fall asleep. bunny turns to jack with a smile.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{not bad yourself.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{look, i'm sorry about that whole, you know, the "kangaroo" thing.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{it's the accent, isn't it?}
<A>__{north comes up from behind with tooth at his side. they turn toward bunny, marveling at the sight of sophie, fast sleep. it's touching. bunny's face softens, as if remembering a distant memory.}
<C>__{bunnymund}
<D>__{ah, poor little ankle biter. look at her, all tuckered out.}
<C>__{tooth}
<D>__{i love her!}
<A>__{they look up from the sleeping toddler toward jack. he's taught them something today.}
<D>__{guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 85.}
<C>__{tooth}
<D>__{i think it's time to get her home.}
<A>__{bunny hands the sleeping sophie over to tooth.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how about i take her home?}
<C>__{tooth}
<D>__{jack, no! pitch is }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{ no match for this.}

<C>__{bunnymund}
