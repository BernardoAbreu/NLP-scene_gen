<D>__{... so grant here and myself are riding over lochnagar and the rain's pouring down in sheets and all we're thinking about is getting home for a drink, when through the gloom grant spots a couple of poachers. he gives me a shout and we chase them down towards the loch until grant has your men up against the stacks and he's shouting and cursing at them, "why are you poaching on royal land?!" and one of the little fellas looks up at him and says, "coz we've come up in the world."}
<A>__{for a split second, both the grants look petrified, then brown and victoria explode into laughter and the grants relax. suddenly the grants are helpless with laughter too. beginning with victoria's glass, brown pours out liberal quantities of whiskey all round.}
