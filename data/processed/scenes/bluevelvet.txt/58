<L>__{35. exterior vacant field day}
<A>__{jeffrey is walking down a dirt road on his way home. he kicks up little clouds of dust as he walks. he has some time to think about things. he sees a green bottle in the distance. he gathers up a few more rocks and pitches them one by one at the bottle. he misses. he looks for a few more good rocks to throw and while looking through some tall grass and weeds, he sees something strange. he looks closer. it is a human ear, covered with crawling ants. jeffrey immediately stands up and looks around. all he sees are houses some laundry drying a very peaceful scene. no one seems to be around no one seems to be watching him. he looks again at the ear. we are so close we can hear ants racing frantically around the ear into it. there is dried blood on part of it. jeffrey finds a brown paper bad and using a twig, he pushes the ear onto it. again, he stands up and looks around. in the distance, a man goes into the back door of a house. nothing more. jeffery hurries off, carrying the bag with the ear in it.}
