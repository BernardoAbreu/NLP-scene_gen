<L>__{interior mine}
<A>__{deep in the tunneled rock, past the rusting conveyor belts, gabriel sits in a small cave blowing miles davis on his trumpet. there's just the blanket he sits on and a single candle. jerry comes around the corner.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{get any sleep?}
<P>__{(jerry only stares)}
<D>__{ just kidding.}
<L>__{exterior the schoolhouse morning}
<A>__{as katherine climbs out of her pick up she sees several of her students standing in a circle. crouched in the center, talking to them, is a man. gabriel. jerry stands nearby. gabriel is showing a boy his trumpet. demonstrating where to put his fingers.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{...there, and there. now pucker your lips... aim it that way, and just blow a little bit, this is a special trumpet.}
<A>__{the boy puffs lightly. the trumpet emits a piercing, clear note that shatters a window high up in the abandoned part of the building. the youngsters whoop and applaud.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{very good, timmy. very good. here, have a junior mint on me. open up.}
<A>__{as timmy opens his mouth we clearly see gabriel looking down into it. looking for something...}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{who's next?}
<A>__{katherine approaches the scene warily. the children all beg for their turn. gabriel selects sandra, one of mary's second grade friends, and puts her on his knee.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{and who are you?}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{sandra.}
<A>__{she can barely get her fingers around the trumpet.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{and did you see the man upstairs, sandra?}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{a little.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{did you talk to him?}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{and who did, sandra. who talked to the man?}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{mary.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{and where is mary, sandra?}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{she isn't here. she's sick.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you've got very pretty teeth, sandra. here, let me see...}
<A>__{he gently pushes down her chin with his thumb, opens her mouth, and gazes in. katherine enters the circle.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{what the hell do you think you're doing?}
<A>__{gabriel looks up, unperturbed, and smiles.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{just talking to the kids, ma'am.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{get off his knee, sandra. everyone else, go inside. now.}
<A>__{the kids reluctantly shuffle off.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{'bye, gabriel.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{see ya, kids. be sure to study your math.}
<A>__{he has the same sunglasses as simon. the same cold, creepy air about him.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{it's a long story.}
<A>__{jerry suddenly snorts loudly, trying to retrieve a sticky red glop that starts running out of his nose.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{ignore him.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{everyone else does.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{i don't know what the hell is going on, but you both better get out of here. right now.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you're right...}
<A>__{he climbs to his feet and stands close to her.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{...you have no idea what's going on.}
<A>__{he stands there a beat. that terrible coldness that swirls about him. the shriek of ghosts under his breath. then he climbs into the rambler with jerry and pulls away. katherine watches the car drive off, then yells over to the school janitor.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{al! keep an eye on the children for me. i will be right back. and call the sheriff.}
<C>__{janitor}
<D>__{sheriff? what the hell do i tell him?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{just call.}
<A>__{katherine gets into her pickup and starts the engine.}
