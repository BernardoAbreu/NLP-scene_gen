<ACTION>__{A beautiful field of wheat glistens in the morning sun. As the camera skims overtop, titles start to roll.  Ahead of us an odd-looking service van comes into view, sputtering along a dirt road.  Getting closer, we can see the driver, a thin, bookish man with a neat mustache.  This is AUSTIN GRIMALDI. The truck pulls up to a strange Victorian house in the middle of the wheatfield.  The house has several futuristic radar devices on the roof that rotate constantly. AUSTIN gets out, opens the van's rear doors, and pulls out two large metal boxes.}

<ACTION_ALT>__{INSIDE THE HOUSE}
<ACTION>__{AUSTIN is reading a schematic diagram as he sits in front of the exposed chassis of a complicated futuristic electronic contraption, twice his size.  There are strange tools all over the floor. Putting down the diagram, he opens one of the metal cases and takes out a sophisticated-looking glass sphere with electronic receptacles mounted in the sides. He places this sphere in a space in the middle of the contraption, clamps it down, and plugs some wires into the globe's receptacles. Then he opens the second box.  Inside is a glowing green ball. Using a pair of special tongs, AUSTIN carefully lifts the ball out, and inserts it into an opening at the base of the machine, in the back. As soon as the ball is inside, the machine hums to life.  The glass sphere sparkles, and a holographic picture of a green planet in space appears inside it.}

Getting closer, we see a slimy silk-like webbing ooze out of the ball and move towards the sleeping girl, pulling the green ball behind it. The ball starts to glow and pulse as the webbing begins to surround the girl, like a cocoon.  Slowly the camera pans up the wall, and moves out through the window, and beyond the city gates, rising higher and higher.}

The camera zooms across this strange landscape toward the distant mountains where the huge planetoid fell.  Finally, from high above the foothills, we begin to come down. In the hills below us, hundreds of blue humanoid barbarians are moving along, mesmerized, toward a pulsing green glow high in the mountaintops.  Suddenly the mountains begin to rumble.}

Ahead of us, terrified Kraanians run from the onslaught. As we track up over the burning rooftops, we see the BARBARIAN LEADER riding his war-horse in the streets below.  Shouting a command, he waves his men on as they move toward an impressive doomed building in the middle of the city.}

Below her, on the ground, she sees a humanoid running in terror, chased by an ugly, four-legged mutant creature. Spurring her bird forward, TAARNA sweeps down over the ugly beast and lassoes it.  She then hoists the creature up into the air and, tossing her end of the rope over a tall jagged rock, she leaves the snarling beast hanging helplessly. Flying down to the grateful humanoid, she dismounts.  As she approaches we see that he has a barbarian medallion on a chain around his neck.}

She hears something - voices inside her, chanting her name. Quickly she grabs the chain and rips it apart.  Then she powerfully smashes both her hands together around her attacker's ears.  As he holds his ringing ears, she gets up, lifts him above her head, and hurls him mercilessly to the ground. Still hearing the chanting, she jumps on her bird, pulls out a second rope, and lassoes the barbarian's feet.  She then lifts him up and leaves him hanging from the tall, jagged rock, next to the growling creature. As TAARNA flies off, the hanging beast eyes the barbarian hungrily.}

The pan stops at the tail of the aircraft, and we see a Japanese soldier - a guard. There is a moment of tranquillity, as jungle sounds fill the air.  The soldier almost dozes ... suddenly the cacophony of sound stops, and for a brief moment there is complete silence ... then with an agonizing wail an air raid siren shatters the silence and the guard looks skyward, startled.

Carefully painted on the parchment is a circle of mountains, their tops glowing green. TAARNA looks at it, and puts it in her sack.

The rocketplane banks sharply, then stabilizes.  Slowly the hatch-doors in its belly open up, revealing the underside of an automobile suspended in the open hatch. Hydraulic metal arms emerge, lowering the automobile out from the belly of the cruising rocketplane.  We can see now that the car is a white, '59 Corvette convertible. With a "thunk", the metal arms release the car, and as the rocketplane blasts away, the Corvette begins its free-fall to Earth. As the car falls gracefully through space, the driver plays with the wheel, causing the Corvette to bank smoothly one way, then the other. Once his direction is stable, the driver clicks on the car radio and adjusts it through various channels, until he settles on one. With the music playing, the car falls closer and closer to Earth, entering and emerging from the cloud cover over the atmosphere.  In the heat of entry the vehicle's paint starts burning up. As he heads down over a deserted area, the driver begins his approach.  Touching down at breakneck speed, the smoking Corvette bounces violently, every part straining at the repeated impact. The driver's face is expressionless as he jams the car into high gear and floors it, spinning the wheels in an attempt to translate downward momentum into forward motion.

<ACTION>__{The camera pans down the stone statue to the glowing sphere, which lies abandoned on the ground.  The soldiers are gone.  As we watch, time begins to accelerate and the Neverwhere Pyramid ages and crumbles all around the green ball.  The earth heaves and shifts, and dense vegetarian grows up through the cracks in the ground. A prehistoric man walks up and sees the glowing ball under a fern. Fascinated, he picks it up and looks at it, as the foot of a Tyrannosaurus Rex comes down, crushing him. Time advances again as the dinosaur becomes a skeleton, and a Biblical tent-community grows up around the ball.  In the fire-light, the Nomadic tribesmen are watering their animals, when one of the camels paws at the ground, uncovering the glowing ball.  Scared, the camel struggles and trys to break its ropes. Out of nowhere a Roman Legion attacks, slaughtering the tribesmen. Time accelerates again, and the conquering Romans build a temple, placing the green ball in the head of a golden idol.  Then the Romans grow fat and debauched, while slave-girls feed them grapes. As the ball glows, the temple crashes down around the debauched Romans, covering them and the green ball in rubble. Over the ruins of the temple, a succession of primitive mud and clay huts evolve into the thatched-roof cottages of a Medieval village. A Medieval stone-cutter finds the ball, and mortars it in with his stones as he builds a water well in the centre of the village. Satisfied with his work, he lowers the bucket to draw himself a drink.  Behind him, an  ox-cart comes roaring around a corner. The axle breaks and a heavy wooden wheel careens along, striking the stone-cutter in the back and knocking him into the well. Time advances once more as the Medieval village grows and transforms into a Victorian-style town.  It is evening, and the stone well now sits under a gazebo at the centre of a gas- lit village green. A fancy carriage carrying a Victorian gentleman passes by and circles the green. Moving in through a window across the street, we see a seductive- looking woman dressing herself in black garters and lace.  This is intercut with the carriage circling the green, until the woman, who looks like a high-class harlot, finishes dressing and leaves her room.  Crossing the street, she walks up to the gazebo and leans provocatively up against the well. The gentleman gets out of his carriage, approaches the woman and propositions her.  She smiles, touches, and teases him. We pan down their legs to the green ball glowing in the well-wall. Suddenly red blood begins to drip over the ball, and the woman's body falls to the ground.  The camera pans up to the well-bucket, where the gentleman is washing the blood from his hands. As time begins to move forward again, the man ages and hobbles away, as the well crumbles and cheap turn-of-the-century row- housing grows up, covering the green ball.  The town becomes dirtier and blacker, and smokestacks blow soot into the morning sky.  Almost on cue, the doors of the houses open, and grim coal-miners emerge, shuffling through the filthy streets on their way to work. The camera pans down to a drain in the gutter.  A rat appears. Panning back up, the street is now empty.  A bell is heard ringing, and a horse-drawn Red Cross cart pulls around a corner and into view.  Masked workers follow the cart.  One rings the bell, while the others pull corpses from the doorways and load them into the cart.  The gutters and windowsills are now full of rats.  Time advances again and the buildings become deserted derelicts.  Their decaying timbers groan under the weight. A support snaps, and one of the buildings starts to collapse. Falling amidst the crumbling plaster and rotting wood is the glowing green ball.  As the ball hits the ground, it is covered over by rubble. The rubble becomes bleached by the hot sun and the landscape grows drier.  Sand blows all around, covering over everything. As the sandstorm clears, the entire terrain is nothing but desert.  In the distance we can see a group of people walking.}

When the sand has sifted out, we see the tarnished Loc-Nar in the machine's grip. It is not glowing.  The machine swivels, and a native foreman plucks the Loc-Nar from the shovel-sifter's teeth. As the foreman touches it, the Loc-Nar starts glowing brightly. The foreman's hands turn green.  He looks at his green hands, then he looks over to the archaeologist.  Suddenly the foreman's entire body glows green, and crumbles into dust. The archaeologist and the natives stare in horror at the glowing Loc-Nar, lying in the pile of green dust.}
