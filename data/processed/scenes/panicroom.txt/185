<L>__{interior library night}
<A>__{meg is back in the library, hurriedly unscrewing the window. she gets the last screw out, shoves the window up. the wind blasts in, it's a hell of a spooky night out there. she leans out the window. we lean with her. the sidewalk is empty (we see it only from our vantage point inside the house). she's one floor up. to her right is the house's front stoop. she tosses the sledgehammer over, onto the stoop. climbs up onto the window ledge, and slithers out herself. we lean further, watch her as she edges along the ledge, hops down onto the stoop, and freezes, staring in horror at the video camera that covers the front stoop. on the monitors, we see her staring straight up at the camera, clearly standing on the front stoop, outside the house, where she was specifically told not to go. in the panic room, sarah sees the image of her on the stoop. raoul happens to be looking away at the moment, at the safe, but he starts to turn around, to look at the monitors again and sarah kicks him, hard, in the ass.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{he turns, away from the monitors.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{sorry. can't control it sometimes.}
<A>__{raoul scowls at her. behind him on the monitors, meg darts down the front steps and disappears from view on the monitor. in the panic room, sarah sees her mother go.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(to raoul)}
<D>__{won't happen again.}
