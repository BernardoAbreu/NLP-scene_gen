<D>__{was he in love?}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{he married for love }
<P>__{(a little laugh)}
<D>__{that's why he did everything. that's why he went into politics. it seems we weren't enough. he wanted all the voters to love him, too. all he really wanted out of life was love. that's charlie's story it's the story of how he lost it. you see, he just didn't have any to give. he loved charlie kane, of course, very dearly and his mother, i guess he always loved her. as for emily well, all i can tell you is emily's story as she told it to me, which probably isn't fair there's supposed to be two sides to every story and i guess there are. i guess there's more than two sides }
