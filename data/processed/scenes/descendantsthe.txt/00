<D>__{my missionary ancestors came to the islands and told the hawaiians to put on clothes, work hard, believe in christ, and stop surfing and hula dancing. they made business deals along the way buying an island, or marrying a princess and inheriting her land. now their descendants wear bikinis and running shorts, play beach volleyball and surf, and take up hula dancing. hawai'i has always been a place of contradiction.}
