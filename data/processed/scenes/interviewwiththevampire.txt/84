<L>__{interior flat night}
<A>__{sturdy mulatto workmen lifting cases and trunks out of the apartment. all the furniture is covered in white sheets. claudia dressed in a cap and hat, is playing the piano by the light of one remaining oil lamp. louis comes from her room with the cage of canaries.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{the birds. we forgot about the birds. there's nothing for it but to let them go.}
<A>__{he opens the cage, and the canaries fly around the room. there is a knocking on the door. claudia falters.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{the workmen must have a trunk don't stop, cherie }
<A>__{he goes downstairs. claudia plays a moment, then stops, perturbed. she goes to the window. then sees something out there that makes her face go white. she screams.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{louis!!!}
<B>__{the stairway}
<A>__{louis walking to the door. the knocking gets louder.}
<B>__{the parlour}
<A>__{claudia runs for the stairs, after louis.}
<B>__{the hallway}
<A>__{louis reaches the door. the knocking gets louder. he opens the door as }
<B>__{claudia}
<A>__{reaches the stairs. she screams }
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{don't louis }
<A>__{but louis has opened the door. nothing there. he looks back at claudia, puzzled, then at the door again when, swooping into his vision comes the nightmare image of }
<B>__{lestat}
<A>__{in filthy swamp soaked rags, robust again, but his flesh shriveled, covered in scars, his eyes riddled, bloodshot. he roars.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{where is she? where is that accursed child?}
<A>__{louis throws his body against the door, slamming it on lestat's reaching hand. the hand withdraws, as lestat roars. louis bolts the door. louis runs up the stairs, sweeps claudia in his arms, watching appalled as the door shudders with the force of lestat's body.}
<B>__{in the parlour}
<A>__{louis runs through with claudia in his arms.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{it can't be }
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{it is! take the back stairwell }
<A>__{suddenly lestat crashes through the casement window, scattering blood everywhere, reefing himself on the shattered glass. he tumbles to the floor and gets unsteadily to his feet.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{give me her louis!!}
<A>__{louis throws claudia behind him and hurls himself on lestat, who fights like a ravening animal, bits of his broken body coming off in the process. then with a terrifying effort, lestat hurls louis off, goes for claudia, who grabs the poker from the fireplace, scatters burning coals over him. he falls back, then comes at her again, as the drapes catch fire. louis grabs the lamp.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{stay back for the love of god... or i will burn you alive...}
<A>__{lestat lunges again at claudia. louis hurls the lamp, which explodes him in flame. lestat screams in agony, whirls around the room, then comes on claudia again. she hurls another lamp. louis throws the flaming sheets around him, wrapping him further in fire. lestat falls to his knees, choking, hands up over his face in the smoke. the whole parlor is afire. louis gathers up claudia, smothering the burning house, carries her down the back stairs, through the carriage way and through the gathering crowds of mortals into the street.}
