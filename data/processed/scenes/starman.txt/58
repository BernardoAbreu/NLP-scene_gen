<A>__{the star man sucks himself back in terror as the van descends on him. it swings past his window and clips the rear fender of the mustang. both vehicles shudder to a stop. jenny claws at her door. it swings open. she is halfway out before the star man manages to grab the tail of her sweatshirt. jenny begins to scream at the top of her lungs and keeps it up while he tries to wrestle her down on the seat.}
