<A>__{lance grabs kelly's arm and yanks it back. kelly still seems unconcerned. suddenly he pulls away, but lance keeps hold of his backpack. lance holds the backpack up next to his head and points at it, gleeful. lance walks away towards his car. kelly runs after him. lance holds kelly off easily with one hand and throws the backpack into his suv. they struggle for a minute, until lance pushes kelly away, gets in the car. kelly runs next to the car and pounds on the window as lance drives off. finally, kelly gives up. lance turns out of the parking lot and honks the horn. kelly shakes his head.}
