<L>__{interior recovery room day}
<A>__{a head swathed in gauze. the bandages start to fall away. tito, miller and brodie wait as hoag removes the gauze. the patient looks into a mirror. jon archer has become castor troy. he touches his new face. archer stares... the cold reality chilling his blood. archer buckles unprepared emotionally for what he's done to himself. for a moment, he seems to teeter on madness.}
<C>__{tito}
<D>__{jon are you all right?}
<A>__{archer can't respond... he's somewhere the others can't comprehend. finally he emerges... shaken, but in control. tito enters. instinctively, he grabs for his holster.}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{okay... i'm okay.}
<P>__{(realizes)}
<D>__{but my voice... i still sound like me.}
<C>__{hoag}
<D>__{i implanted a micro chip onto your larynx.}
<A>__{hoag switches on an audio tape. archer repeats castor's words as hoag adjusts the chip with a wavelength box.}
<D>__{castor (v.o.) archer}
<A>__{okay, i've got a okay, i've got a confession to make, but confession to make, but you aren't gonna like you aren't gonna like it... (etc.) it... (etc.) after a few repetitions, archer's voice matches perfectly. archer yawns, squints and furrows his brow testing every muscle. he stares into the mirror into the eyes of his most hated enemy now his eyes. archer slowly turns to... castor. motionless, swathed, dead to the world but something about castor's smile that mocking smile...}
<C>__{archer}
<D>__{now what?}
<C>__{tito}
<D>__{we're down to 72 hours. let's call lazarro. castor troy just came out of his coma.}
