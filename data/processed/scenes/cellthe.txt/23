<L>__{interior coffee shop day}
<A>__{his lunch finished, ramsey is on a cell phone talking to his wife. chain drinking coffee, novak scrutinizes photos of the tire tracks.}
<C>__{ramsey}
<D>__{well, honey, what's worse? doing it yourself or asking your mother for help?}
<P>__{(gets his answer)}
<D>__{can it wait 'til i get back }
<P>__{(listens, answers)}
<D>__{i have no idea, jeannie.}
<A>__{novak checks his watch and the street. clearly waiting for someone or something.}
<C>__{ramsey }
<D>__{well all right. good luck with the monster. i love you too. bye bye.}
<A>__{ramsey snaps shut the cell phone.}
<C>__{ramsey }
<D>__{we call jeannie's mother "the monster" because, well... she just is.}
<A>__{novak is oblivious, pouring over tire related info.}
<C>__{ramsey }
<D>__{i know you could care less about my personal life, peter, but i do appreciate the occasional, "how's your wife, gordon?"}
<A>__{he waits. novak obliges:}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{how is she?}
<C>__{ramsey}
<D>__{pregnant. thanks for asking.}
<A>__{novak is distracted by teddy lee entering the diner.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{here he is.}
<C>__{ramsey}
<D>__{damn, man, i give up. your partner tells you his wife's gonna have a baby, and all you care about is a coroner's report!}
<A>__{ramsey assesses the exhausted, lonely, intense man sitting across from him.}
<C>__{ramsey }
<D>__{i feel for those girls too, pete. and their families. but it's just a job. someday it'll be over. and then what'll you have?}
<A>__{much to novak's appreciation, teddy lee's arrival provides an escape from answering the question.}
<C>__{teddy lee}
<D>__{hot off the presses.}
<A>__{he gives them copies of the autopsy report and forensic analysis of anne marie vicksey. the waitress sees teddy, approaches, and offers a menu.}
<C>__{teddy lee }
<P>__{(doesn't need it)}
<D>__{chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes, garden salad with thousand island dressing and an iced tea. thank you darlin'.}
<A>__{she nods and moves to the kitchen. novak and ramsey flip through the documents.}
<C>__{teddy lee }
<D>__{water in her lungs. same brand of bleach. match on the semen. lots of hair.}
<C>__{ramsey}
<P>__{(unenthused)}
<D>__{more hair. i could knit this guy a toupee.}
<A>__{novak finds something in the report that catches him by surprise. he double checks and shows the item to teddy.}
<C>__{teddy lee}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{anne vicksey didn't own a dog.}
<A>__{ramsey checks his copy.}
<C>__{novak }
<D>__{i need it.}
<C>__{teddy lee}
<D>__{now?}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{now.}
