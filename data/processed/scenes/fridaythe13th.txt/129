<L>__{exterior generator shed late afternoon}
<A>__{jack lands, almost unconscious. bill kneels into frame and cheeks jack's vital sign: his eyes, his carotid pulse, his breathing. jack shakes his head.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i will be okay. holy shit...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{don't get up. take a second...}
<A>__{jack lies back down. covers his eyes with his arm.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you saved my life.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i had to.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i figured if i didn't save you. i'd have to give you mouth to mouth and that would have ruined my appetite.}
<A>__{jacks looks up and smiles. bill give him a hand and the groggy athlete gets to his feet.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{whew.}
<A>__{satisfied that jack won't fall down, bill goes to the shed and looks in. we can look in over bill's shoulder and see a smoke scarred switch and a now silent generator.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{this puddle was enough to ground you all the way to china.}
<A>__{jack looks in, too.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{floor probably leaks. this area is full of springs.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{a short somewhere.}
<A>__{bill leans down and sees a smokey colored wire that touches another wire.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{there's the problem, jack. wire worked itself loose.}
<A>__{he starts to wind it round a set screw in cu.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{just in cause this bugger goes bad. i'm gonna pick up some lanterns from the equipment shack.}
<A>__{jacks walks away.}
