<LOC>__{INT. FLETCHER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{A blinding beam of light cuts across the room. One pornographic slide after another hits the screen at the opposite end of the room. They show a dowdy group in some anonymous bedroom, frozen in various stages of a sexual orgy. GERALD FLETCHER is slumped on a sofa. His young wife, ANNA, is curled up beside him. SID FLETCHER, operating the projector's remote-control, has the same flaccid appearance as his twin brother. Jack Carter, drink in hand, watches from an armchair. Clunk. Another slide hits the screen. Gerald is getting turned on. He runs his hand along his wife's stockinged leg. Anna shudders momentarily. She obviously finds his touch repulsive. Carter watches Gerald's hand.}

<ACTION>__{Again she obeys. He kneels on her, pinning her arms with his knees, then stuffs a gag in her mouth. He takes out the hypodermic, places it against her arm, and injects the heroin into her. She struggles, her eyes moving frantically about. She screams, but its muffled by the gag.  Carter holds her down and she quickly goes under. Carter removes the gag. He stands, picks her up and walks into the darkness with Margaret in his arms.}

<LOC>__{INT. THE HEIGHTS - DAWN}
<ACTION>__{The police move through the house and grounds. In the bedrooms they find groups of people in bed together. The men in particular protest and are obviously concerned about being identified. The police find evidence of drugs, pornography and so on. Outside, police are combing the grounds. In the long grass leading down to the lake they find women's clothes. They follow the trail until they discover a woman floating naked, face downwards, in the lake. A policeman with waders goes in and pulls her to the side. As others heave her out, we see that it's Margaret.}

<ACTION>__{The house is surrounded by police measuring and photographing, and outside the house are police cars and ambulances.  The lawn is crowded with the party crowd. In the early-morning light, they look like dolls. Kinnear comes out of the front door with two plain-clothes officers and gets in a police car. Sirens going, it comes down the short drive to the gate.}
<LOC>__{INT. HIRE CAR - DAWN}
<ACTION>__{Carter is driving along a coast road. The sea and a wide beach lie on his right. Long rows of houses are to his left. The sun is still low. It's very quiet. He arrives at a harbour and drives on until he reaches the end of a vast wooden jetty running out into the estuary. It's a coal loader for tankers. This jetty is very high, a complex of wooden staves and pillars, interwoven with steps and gangways. On its top tier is a complex of railway lines, signals and black coal chutes.}

<ACTION>__{Carter parks his car and picks up the shotgun and a bottle of Scotch off the back seat. He get out and walks over to the jetty and along a lower gangway. At the far end, a man is standing. It's Eric Paice. Eric turns around abruptly. He sees Carter and disappears up the nearest stairway. Carter follows. At the top he stops to listen, but can see and hear only the harbour waters lapping below. Carter looks back to the coal jetty, just in time to see Eric scamper down to the level below. Eric sprints for the roadway. Carter waits and then starts running directly above him. Eric keeps running. Carter stays always overhead. He's playing cat and mouse with Eric.}

<ACTION>__{Eric runs out on to the beach. The only sounds are his feet pounding the pebbles and his hurtful panting. In the distance, factory chimneys belch out smoke.  Carter appears.

<LOC>__{EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY}
<ACTION>__{On the other side of the headland, the scene is extraordinary. The deserted beach is like the edge of the world. The sand is black as far as the eye can see. It's littered with rubbish. Several old lorries are sunk deep in the sand. High, grass-covered cliffs flank it on the left. It's deserted. In the distance, a continuous line of giant black buckets move, like cable-cars, out to sea, before they deposit their load of coal slag and move inland again. The coal mine itself is inland, hidden away behind the cliffs. The sea, like the sand, is black as it crashes on to the shore. Eric is half-way along the beach, struggling in the mud. Carter closes on him.}
<LOC>__{EXT. BEACH - EARLY DAY}
<ACTION>__{Eric nears the line of buckets and cuts inland towards the mine.  Carter has nearly caught up. The buckets grind and crash as they move along the cable. Eric scrambles up the narrow valley down which the coal slag travels. He is panting horribly. Carter is close on his heels.  Near the top, where the buckets are practically at ground level, Eric stumbles and falls. He is too exhausted to get up. Carter stands over him.}

The bucket shudders and grinds as it moves along the cable. Eric's body moves of on its final journey. It reaches the end of the line, where an automatic catch tilts it. Eric's body drops into the sea. The coal slag follows in a cloud of black dust. The waves pass over and everything is gone. Carter stands for a moment, turns and walks back along the beach. He stops, looks at the shotgun, and decides to get rid of it.}

A finger curls around the trigger. On the middle finger of the same hand is a large gold ring with the letter 'J' engraved upon it. It is the man Kinnear contacted after sending Eric to his death. The finger tightens on the trigger and pulls it. There's a quiet, whooshing sound. Carter drops to the ground.}
