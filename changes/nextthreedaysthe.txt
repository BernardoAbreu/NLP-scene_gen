<LOC>__{INT. STEAK HOUSE -- NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Two couples sit at a table, picking at dessert, JOHN and LARA BRENNAN on one side, MICK and ERIT on the other. JOHN is attractive in a worn kind of way, but has the eyes of a kid with a discipline problem. You have to really know him to understand if he is mocking you or agreeing with you. He is a master of irony and has a true enjoyment of the absurd. LARA looks beautiful even in her wrinkled suit. She appears to have had a hard day at the office. She's been drinking at dinner; it hasn't eased her nerves. John's good-looking brother, MICK, boasts his blue collar roots and a gorgeous, if slightly trashy, girlfriend, ERIT, who isn't ashamed of her body or sharing her opinions. JOHN and MICK are laughing. Lara puts cash on the tray beside Mick's credit card.}
