<A>__{kirsty is sitting up in bed. on the bedside table, a telephone. she is now thoroughly engrossed in the problems of the box. her fingers speed over the surfaces, looking for some way in, testing its strength. suddenly, a click. her face lights up with pleasure, as she slides a part of the box open, revealing new intricacies. and to accompany the revelation, a tinkling tune. she smiles. it's a musical box. the light beside the bed flickers, but she doesn't notice. the door opens. it's the nurse.}
