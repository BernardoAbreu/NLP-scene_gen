<L>__{exterior soccer field day}
<A>__{a glorious sunny day. lucy and her team are in the middle of a fierce game. a foul is called when we hear }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{penalty! rules broken. penalty, please!}
<A>__{sam, wearing a uniform and whistle around his neck, walking his inimitable walk, races up the field, coaching the team. ifty, robert and brad sit in the bleachers. robert, in sunglasses, paranoid, looking behind him. brad follows around an attractive young woman as close as he can get to her. sam runs by the water stand, manned by randy and bill. they share a look a moment of intense parental pride. lucy and a kid named phillip go after the ball.}
<C>__{obnoxious mom}
<D>__{get her! phillip, you get her!}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{i saw that! you gave him a secret signal! didn't you?}
<C>__{ifty}
<D>__{keep both eyes on the ball, lucy balls are round on sale at kmart. the earth is a ball, too...}
<A>__{phillip steps in front of lucy and shoves her as hard as he can. sam blows his whistle repeatedly and races over.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{penalty! repeat! rules broken! penalty!}
<C>__{rita }
<D>__{penalty?! sue him! kick his ass outta the game!}
<A>__{it's rita! with danny hollering from the stands.}
<B>__{on lucy}
<A>__{looks over at her father. sam does every coaching gesture, and referee hand signal from every sport known to man. it looks like a bizarre twyla tharp dance.}
<B>__{on lucy}
<A>__{she does it right back at him. their secret code. the code that will bind them for the rest of their lives.}
<B>__{on the crowd and players}
<A>__{all watching. what the hell was that? sam blows his whistle.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{play ball! play ball!}
<A>__{the game heats up. lucy's team gets the ball and is headed toward the goal. sam is running right alongside them, so excited, until he can't hold himself back anymore and intercepts the ball! sam runs valiantly down the field with it! we hear "here comes the sun"... little darlin', it's been a long, cold lonely winter. little darlin', it feels like years since you've been here. here comes the sun...here comes the sun...and i say, "it's alright..." and the credits roll.}
