<L>__{exterior forest day}
<A>__{john follows a path through a big silent wood, the low sun flaring and catching his white work shirt.}
<B>__{p.o.v. of john}
<A>__{through binoculars, a long way off and squinting into the sun. nadia lowers the binoculars and looks past us.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{john spots some figures lying on the grass in the distance. he heads towards them, and watches them for a moment from thirty yards away. alexei, yuri and nadia sit in a small clearing. a blanket, cushions, bread and vodka are scattered around. yuri is strumming a guitar. alexei and nadia are laughing and chatting. he removes a small twig from her hair and flattens it under his big hand. john watches the gesture. it's so intimate they could be lovers.}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(calls)}
<D>__{john. we can see you hiding.}
<A>__{john steps out of his hiding place and approaches the group. alexei has nadia falling about laughing about something. he smiles at her then nods to john. pieces of cooked rabbit lie in tin foil. alexei feeds a piece to nadia with a big hunting knife. nadia smiles at john, and starts knitting.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{how is bank?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{fine. i thought you were leaving today.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{to be indoors on such a day. it's crime.}
<A>__{nadia stops knitting and takes her shirt off and stretches back to sunbathe in her black bra. alexei takes the knife he has just finished cleaning and holds the cold wide blade flat above nadia's bare stomach. just before pressing it down he looks across at john. nadia yelps and sits up. they laugh, and yuri joins in. john laughs uneasily. alexei notices marks on nadia's midriff. he asks her about them in russian. john goes white, unable to understand nadia's explanation. he has no idea what she told him.}
