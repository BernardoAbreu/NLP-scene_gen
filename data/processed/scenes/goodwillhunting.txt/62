<A>__{this is sean maguire's "dying and bereavement" class. emblazoned on the door is "room 101." while the lecture hall could hold sixty students, there are less than fifteen here today. sean maguire lectures to the class in a resigned tone. tired of teaching, tired of life, he finds himself resigned to the tedium of teaching core classes to an indifferent student body.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{establishing trust is the most important component in making breakthroughs with a patient. why?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{maureen?}
<A>__{maureen's only response is an empty stare.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{keep up the good work, maureen. vinnie?}
<A>__{vinnie looks up.}
<C>__{vinnie}
<D>__{because trust is an important thing.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{don't bullshit me, vinnie. didn't your brother give you the notes? okay. if a patient doesn't trust you then they won't feel safe enough to be honest with you then there's no point to them being in therapy. it's like saying "fine, come here and don't tell me a thing but go home feeling like you're doing something about your problems and give me my fifty bucks before you leave will ya'!"}
<A>__{he looks around the room for approval. no one is listening.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{if you don't help them trust you then there's no way you'll ever get them to sleep with you. and that should be the goal of any good therapist. insecure women, you know... nail 'em when they're vulnerable, that's always been my motto.}
<A>__{the students look up, somewhat stunned.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{see, i got vinnie's attention.}
<A>__{laughter. sean starts to resume his lecture, when he notices lambeau standing in the back of the room. there is an awkward moment.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{gerry.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{sean.}
<C>__{sean}
<P>__{(to class)}
<D>__{well, it seems we're in the presence of greatness. professor gerald lambeau is a field's medal winner. combunatorial mathematics. 1986.}
<A>__{the students stare blankly.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{the field's medal is the nobel prize for math.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but it's only given out every four years.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{okay, that's all for today. try and get through fernald by monday.}
<A>__{the class starts to pack up and file out. lambeau approaches sean who steps down from the lectern.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{good to see you.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{good to see you.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{is there someplace we can talk?}
