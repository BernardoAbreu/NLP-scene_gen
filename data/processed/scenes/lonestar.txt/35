<D>__{ but i gotta say i think there's something to this cold climate business. i mean, you go to the beach what do you do? drink a few beers, wait for a fish to flop up on the sand. can't build no civilization that way. you got a hard winter coming, though, you got to plan ahead, and that gives your cerebral cortex a workout.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{good deal you were born down here, then.}
<C>__{cody}
<D>__{you joke about it, sam, but we are in a state of crisis. the lines of demarcation has gotten fuzzy to run a sucessfull civilization you got to have lines of demarcation between right and wrong, between this one and that one your daddy understood that. he was like the whatchacallit the referee for this damn menudo we got down here. he understood how most people don't want their sugar and salt in the same jar.}
