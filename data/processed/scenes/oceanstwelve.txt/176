<A>__{yen enters frame dressed like a pretentious grunge rocker. he whispers chinese into a bullhorn. theoretically he's speaking to his crew (danny, saul, and livingston in lame disguises) telling them where to set up the camera, lights, and flags. each "crew member" carries an odd looking oversized "light meter". upon closer examination we can see that each device has a small tv screen on it which is tapped into the museum's closed circuit system. the guys are carefully placing their flags and lights so as to block the view of the egg from each of the eight cameras on the ceiling of the gallery. "studio execs," reuben and linus go to "julia."}
