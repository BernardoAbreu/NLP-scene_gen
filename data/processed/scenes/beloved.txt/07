<A>__{the voice of sethe humming a melody carries over the images of: the two boys running for their lives towards the train, holding hands all the way. howard is the first to reach it. as it passes by, he throws his bag upon it and jumps in. bulgar races beside it as howard reaches for him. c.u. howard's hand reaching for bulgar's...they connect. wide shot the boys are on the train as it leaves town. on it's route, the train passes a ramshackle graveyard. camera moves slowly into the graveyard until it reaches a headstone, made with flecked pink stone. upon the headstone is only one word:}
