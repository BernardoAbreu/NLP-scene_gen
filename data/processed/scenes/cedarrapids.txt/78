<L>__{interior olive garden, romantic booth a little while later}
<A>__{tim and joan are seated in a candlelit booth. opera muzak tinkles. if you didn't know this to be a mall based chain, you might think it a romantic italian restaurant. maybe. an acne scarred waiter, 21, approaches with a tray.}

<C>__{tim}

<C>__{tim}
<D>__{mm, it does taste a lot like communion wine. awesome. later }
<A>__{joan feeds tim a bite of her lasagna. a bit sticks to his chin. she wipes it off, semi seductively. tim laughs.}

<C>__{joan}
<D>__{c'mon, man. i mean fantasy land stuff. what do you really want?}
<A>__{a beat. he takes a sip of sherry, shrugs.}

<D>__{well. i always hoped i could take over northlands when bill retired. but that obviously isn't going to happen now.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{oh, screw him. he wants to sell, why don't you just buy northlands?}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{yeah right.}
<C>__{joan}

<C>__{tim}
<D>__{i don't... probably not.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{you know the business. you know the clients. you actually care about your job. you'd be perfect.}

<C>__{tim}
<D>__{you've got kids?}
<A>__{joan takes out her blackberry. the screensaver is a family portrait: joan, a man with a goatee, and two cute kids. all of them are dressed in denim.}

<A>__{tim doesn't hide his shock well. joan sees it.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i know it's effed up. and if i had it all to do over again, i don't know what i'd choose.}
<C>__{joan }
<D>__{but i don't have that option. so this is my fantasy land, tim. cedar rapids. asmi. this. i come here, and for a few days i'm someone else. no kids. no husband. no responsibility. wild woman.}
