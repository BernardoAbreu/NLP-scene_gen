<L>__{interior cafe. day.}
<A>__{bonnie, clyde and c.w. seated in a booth in a cafe. the waitress brings the food and serves everybody. we see c.w. with great concentration, as he does everything by relating to the immediate action he happens to be involved with, he takes the sugar shaker and begins methodically sprinkling sugar over all his food. he sugars the meat, the beans, and the beets. bonnie and clyde watch this performance with first, amazement and second, disgust. they can't believe what they see.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(incredulously)}
<D>__{c.w., what are you doing? why do you do that?}
<C>__{c.w.}
<P>__{(beginning to eat it)}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{it's just disgusting, that's why.}
<C>__{c.w.}
<P>__{(chewing)}
<D>__{not to me it ain't.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{but...but it makes everything sweet!}
<C>__{c.w.}
<D>__{yeah, i know.}
<A>__{with a resigned expression, bonnie turns away and begins to eat. suddenly a look of consternation crosses c.w.'s face.}
<C>__{c.w.}
<D>__{damn! no mayonnaise!}
<A>__{he gets up and goes down to the counter on the other end of the restaurant, out of our vision, apparently planning to put mayonnaise over the sugar. the minute he is out of earshot, bonnie gets clyde's attention.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{clyde, why does he have to stay in the same room as us?}
<A>__{clyde seems not to have heard the question. he takes up the sugar shaker and spreads a thin field of sugar on the dark table surface. he will sketch his plan in the sugar.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{lemme show you about tomorrow.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{now c.w.'ll be waitin' right outside in the car. here is the teller's cage. four of them and over here the desks and what have you...}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{why, clyde...}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{hmmm??}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{in the same room with us?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{hell, where else? ain't gonna spread out all over the state...}
<A>__{the harshness of his tone concerns him and he recovers with a smile.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{not yet, anyway. now, the door to the bank is here now. you cover me from there.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(takes his hand to her face)}
<D>__{just that i love you so much.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{you're the best damn girl in texas.}
<A>__{c.w. comes back with the mayonnaise; looks at the table.}
<C>__{c.w.}
<D>__{hey, you spilled the sugar.}
<A>__{three shot.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(eating)}
<D>__{the layout for tomorrow up in mineola.}
<C>__{c.w.}
<D>__{mineola? gosh, that's four, five hundred miles from here!}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{so what? we take u.s. 85 to willis point, don't you know, and cut over on state highway 28 at kaufman, keep on goin' till we hit the farm to market road that connects to 105 and that's right up by mineola. on a saturday afternoon...}
