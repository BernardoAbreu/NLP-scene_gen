<D>__{lisa (v.o.) (cont'd) then there's lucy...}
<A>__{she takes out a white out bottle and touches a spot on her already white keds... stands... looks... then touches a spot on the other shoe...}
<D>__{lisa (cont'd) (v.o.) (cont'd) geek extraordinaire a walking left brain. she's supposed to have this genius i.q.?}
<A>__{she then starts an obsessional frenzy of "whiting out" spots all over her keds. diane exits the final stall and takes away lucy's white out.}

<A>__{gym lights go dark. students scream. drum corp. and brass band start "rock & roll part ii" by gary glitter. the spotlight races around the gym before it hits center court. the a squad springs to their feet for an amazing cheer dance strong, sexy, acrobatic, non traditional.}
<D>__{lisa (v.o.) (cont'd) now, i know it's my duty to give you all the facts, so i have to say that their cheer blew like a bulimic after christmas dinner. their blatant disregard for national high school cheerleading association rules made me sick.
