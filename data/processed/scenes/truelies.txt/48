<A>__{gib and harry pass through the inner door of the sally port into a large austere atrium. angle from above as they cross. a huge graphic logo covers the floor. across the center is says omega sector. in smaller print, around the perimeter, is the motto: "the last line of defense". they enter a high tech office space. it is a maze of glass partitions surrounding a central floor space of cubicles. there is a hushed quality here. people do not joke. they do not hurry. there are a lot of computer screens displaying information from around the world. it looks like a combination of nasa mission control and fbi headquarters. fast faisil greets them, yawning, as they pass his partitioned cubicle.}
