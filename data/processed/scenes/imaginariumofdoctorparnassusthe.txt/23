<L>__{int monastery dining hall later}
<A>__{dr. parnassus and mr nick are sitting at the fire. behind them, in the hall, monks come and go. on the dais, a monk continues with the story. this monk is a younger percy.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{... and as the waters rose... the people's need for stories grew. stories that would feed a great hunger. a hunger for more than just understanding...}
<A>__{percy continues telling the story in the background.}
<C>__{mr nick}
<D>__{what exactly do you do here?}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{we tell the eternal story.}
<C>__{mr nick}
<D>__{oh.... what's that?}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{the story that sustains the universe. the story without which there is nothing.}
<C>__{mr nick}
<D>__{nothing? really. are you telling me that if you stop telling a story...}
<P>__{(waving in the direction of percy)}
<D>__{this story... something you made up, a fiction... that the universe ceases to exist?}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{you make it sound so simple.}
<C>__{mr nick}
<D>__{and you believe it?}
<A>__{dr. parnassus smiles.}
<C>__{mr nick }
<D>__{incredible. it's just incredible to me that you can believe something that can be so easily disproved.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<P>__{(complacently)}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{mr nick turns and throws a spell at percy who goes rigid like a statue struck dumb. the story stops.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus }
<P>__{(alarmed)}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{another monk, sitting at the table, immediately continues the story.}
<C>__{substitute monk}
<D>__{..having been brought to the limit of his endurance...}
<A>__{mr nick freezes him too, stopping him from speaking. a third monk continues.}
<C>__{third monk}
<D>__{...yet the forces of evil could not prevail, and...}
<A>__{mr.nick renders him silent.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{stop!}
<A>__{mr nick zaps dr. parnassus and all the other monks. all still. none of them can speak.}
<C>__{mr nick}
<D>__{there you are. you see. the story's stopped. no more story... and yet, we're still here, the fire's still burning...}
<A>__{he pushes open a window.}
<C>__{mr nick }
<D>__{it's still snowing. the wind's still blowing. nothing's changed.}
<A>__{dr. parnassus and the monks, still struck dumb, look appalled.}
<C>__{mr nick }
<D>__{cheer up... i've freed you from this ridiculous nonsense.}
<A>__{mr nick undoes the spell. the monks moan. dr. parnassus slumps down in despair. mr nick smiles and lights a cigarette. he's enjoying this.}
<C>__{mr nick }
<D>__{now you can use your powers to do something else. have fun, travel, learn a foreign language...}
<A>__{splat! a gob of bird shit lands on mr. nick's head. an eagle circles overhead. it swoops across the hall and exits through a window. dr. parnassus leaps up, laughing, amazed, revived.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{a sign! a message! that bird was a messenger... from distant places we know not of!}
<P>__{(triumphant)}
<D>__{other places! the point is, you're wrong! and i'm wrong! it doesn't have to be us here!}
<P>__{(indicating monks)}
<D>__{somewhere in the world, at any given time... someone is telling a story! sustaining the universe! right now, it's happening.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus }
<D>__{that's why we're still here. you can't stop stories being told somewhere! you can't be everywhere!}
<A>__{mr nick is furious.}
<C>__{mr nick}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{a weak hypothesis!}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{mr nick stubs out his cigarette.}
<C>__{mr nick}
<D>__{i tell you what... you're probably not a betting man but...}
<A>__{mr nick whispers into the dr. parnassus's ear.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus }
<D>__{and so i made a wager with the devil.}
