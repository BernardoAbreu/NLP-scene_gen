<T>__{fade in on:}
<B>__{the pit of despair}
<A>__{dank and chill, underground and windowless, lit by flickering torches. frightening. westley lies in the center of the cage, chained and helpless.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{something really frightening: a bloodless looking albino dead pale, he silently enters the pit, carrying a tray of food and medication. he puts it down.}
<C>__{westley}
<D>__{where am i?}
<C>__{albino}
<P>__{(he only whispers)}
<D>__{the pit of despair.}
<A>__{he begins tending westley's wounds. westley winces.}
<C>__{albino}
<P>__{(garbled)}
<D>__{don't even think }
<P>__{(a hack, sputter,}
<D>__{cough now his voice}
<P>__{seems normal again)}
<D>__{ don't even think about trying to escape. the chains are far too thick. and don't dream of being rescued either. the only way in is secret. and only the prince, the count, and i know how to get in and out.}
<C>__{westley}
<D>__{then i'm here till i die?}
<C>__{albino}
<P>__{(working away)}
<D>__{till they kill you. yeah.}
<C>__{westley}
<D>__{then why bother curing me?}
<C>__{albino}
<D>__{the prince and the count always insist on everyone being healthy before they're broken.}
<C>__{westley}
<D>__{so it's to be torture.}
<A>__{the albino nods.}
<C>__{westley}
<D>__{i can cope with torture.}
<A>__{the albino shakes his head.}
<C>__{westley}
<D>__{you don't believe me?}
<C>__{albino}
<D>__{you survived the fire swamp. you must be very brave...}
<P>__{(little pause)}
<D>__{... but nobody withstands the machine.}
<A>__{he studies westley, whose face is almost sad.}
