<A>__{views of vast vistas of arid grasslands, open and unmodulated, thirsty and exposed. at the western edge of the dakotas, the monotony of the landscape, now gradually tilting toward the rockies, is interrupted by the badlands sculptured canyons so deep and chaotic they can break a devil's heart. between the grasslands and the eerie badlands ruins, there lies a narrow band of humpy hills, green and pastoral. the hills are carpeted with midlength prairie grass. the rubber rose buildings are clustered at the badlands end at the base of a butte, higher, broader and longer than any in its vicinity, known as siwash ridge. a sign over the entry of the ranch reads:}

<D>__{i've traveled through the yucatan with a circus, popping false eyelashes off a trained monkey with a bullwhip. when i ate peyote one night and had a vision. niwetukame, the mother goddess, came to me on the back of a doe, hummingbirds sipping the tears she was shedding, crying 'delores, you must lead my daughters against their natural enemy. you must come to the rubber rose ranch and prepare for your mission, the details of which will be revealed to you in a third vision....' that night i whipped the shit out of my black lover and ran away. for a while i drove around, making a living selling peyote buttons to hippies, until i made my way here...}
<A>__{a snake crosses the road in front of her, and she takes her whip and whirls it around her head. the snake that is crawling across the dusty road that leads to the ranch is carrying a card under its forked tongue. delores snaps her whip at the snake and picks the card out of his mouth and lets it fly in the air. delores catches it..... the card is the queen of spades.}
