<P>__{(gurgling blood)}
<D>__{run!!!}
<A>__{heroine scoops up her child, moving away from momma beast. tuffy grabs them both, leading them back towards the store front. as adulterer's blood flows, momma beast drags him towards her main prey. a blanket of darkness leads momma beast, overtaking the survivors. at the store front, heroine pulls charlie close.}
