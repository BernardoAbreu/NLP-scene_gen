<L>__{exterior fields day}
<A>__{a clock bell chimes five o'clock. enormous flocks of birds, apparently disturbed by the noise, take to the sky.}
<L>__{interior staircase day}
<A>__{the sound of squawking birds merges into the sound of noisy boys as they descend the stairs in a long spiralling line. mr. mcallister tries to make it upstairs against the steady stream.}

<C>__{knox}
<D>__{hey spaz, spaz.}
<A>__{spaz turns around in time to be hit by a ball of crumpled up paper while cameron smacks him on the shoulder.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{brain damage.}
<A>__{the students quickly quiet down as keating emerges from the other room, whistling the 1812 overture. he walks up the length of the classroom and out the door without a word. the students look around at one another, uncertain of what to do. keating pokes his head back in the doorway.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{well come on.}
<A>__{he gestures them to follow and the students, after some hesitation, grab their books and follow keating out into the main entranceway.}
<L>__{interior entranceway day}
<A>__{keating stands before the school's trophy cabinets and waits until all the boys arrive.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{"oh captain, my captain" who knows where that comes from?}
<A>__{todd looks up as if he knows the answer, but says nothing. spaz blows his nose a little too close to meeks for his liking.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{not a clue? it's from a poem by walt whitman about mr. abraham lincoln. now in this class you can call me mr. keating. or, if you're slightly more daring, oh captain, my captain.}
<A>__{the students laugh slightly.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{now let me dispel a few rumors so they don't fester into facts. yes, i too attended hell ton and survived. and no, at that time i was not the mental giant you see before you. i was the intellectual equivalent of a ninety eight pound weakling. i would go to the beach and people would kick copies of byron in my face.}
<A>__{the boys laugh once again, while cameron, obviously trying to write all this down, looks around confusedly. keating looks down at papers in his hand.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{now, mr... pitts. that's a rather unfortunate name. mr. pitts, where are you?}
<A>__{pitts raises his hand while everyone around him snickers.}
<C>__{keating}
<A>__{mr. pitts, would you open your hymnal to page 542 and read the first stanza of the poem you find there?}
<C>__{pitts}
<D>__{"to the virgins, to make much of time"?}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{yes, that's the one. somewhat appropriate, isn't it.}
<C>__{pitts}
<D>__{"gather ye rosebuds while ye may, old time is still a flying, and this same flower that smiles today, tomorrow will be dying."}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{thank you mr. pitts. "gather ye rosebuds while ye may." the latin term for that sentiment is carpe diem. now who knows what that means?}
<A>__{meeks immediately puts his hand up.}
<C>__{meeks}
<D>__{carpe diem. that's "seize the day."}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{very good, mr. }
<C>__{meeks}
<D>__{meeks.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{meeks. another unusual name. seize the day. gather ye rosebuds while ye may. why does the writer use these lines?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{because he's in a hurry.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{no, ding!}
<A>__{keating slams his hand down on an imaginary buzzer.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{thank you for playing anyway. because we are food for worms lads. because, believe it or not, each and every one of us in this room is one day going to stop breathing, turn cold, and die.}
<A>__{keating turns towards the trophy cases, filled with trophies, footballs, and team pictures.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{now i would like you to step forward over here and peruse some of the faces from the past. you've walked past them many times. i don't think you've really looked at them.}
<A>__{the students slowly gather round the cases and keating moves behind them.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{they're not that different from you, are they? same haircuts. full of hormones, just like you. invincible, just like you feel. the world is their oyster. they believe they're destined for great things, just like many of you. their eyes are full of hope, just like you. did they wait until it was too late to make from their lives even one iota of what they were capable? because you see gentlmen, these boys are now fertilizing daffodils. but if you listen real close, you can hear them whisper their legacy to you. go on, lean in.}
<A>__{the boys lean in and keating hovers over cameron's shoulder.}
<C>__{keating}
<P>__{(whispering in a gruff voice)}
<D>__{carpe.}
<A>__{cameron looks over his shoulder with an aggravated expression on his face.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{hear it?}
<P>__{(whispering again)}
<D>__{carpe. carpe diem. seize the day boys, make your lives extraordinary.}
<A>__{the boys stare at the faces in the cabinet in silence.}

<D>__{spooky if you ask me.}

<L>__{interior keating's classroom day}
<A>__{keating sits at his desk at the front of the classroom and opens up one of his books.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{gentlemen, open your text to page twenty one of the introduction. mr. perry, will you read the opening paragraph of the preface, entitled "understanding poetry"?}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{understanding poetry, by dr. j. evans pritchard, ph.d. to fully understand poetry, we must first be fluent with its meter, rhyme, and figures of speech. then ask two questions: one, how artfully has the objective of the poem been rendered, and two, how important is that objective. question one rates the poem's perfection, question two rates its importance. and once these questions have been answered, determining a poem's greatest becomes a relatively simple matter.}
<A>__{keating gets up from his desk and prepares to draw on the chalk board.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{if the poem's score for perfection is plotted along the horizontal of a graph, and its importance is plotted on the vertical, then calculating the total area of the poem yields the measure of its greatness.}
<A>__{keating draws a corresponding graph on the board and the students dutifully copy it down.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{a sonnet by byron may score high on the vertical, but only average on the horizontal. a shakespearean sonnet, on the other hand, would score high both horizontally and vertically, yielding a massive total area, thereby revealing the poem to be truly great. as you proceed through the poetry in this book, practice this rating method. as your ability to evaluate poems in this matter grows, so will so will your enjoyment and understanding of poetry.}
<A>__{neil sets the book down and takes off his glasses. the student sitting across from him is discretely trying to eat. keating turns away from the chalkboard with a smile.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{excrement. that's what i think of mr. j. evans pritchard. we're not laying pipe, we're talking about poetry.}
<A>__{cameron looks down at the graph he copied into his notes and quickly scribbles it out.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{i mean, how can you describe poetry like american bandstand? i like byron, i give him a 42, but i can't dance to it.}
<A>__{charlie suddenly appear to become interested in the class.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{now i want you to rip out that page.}
<A>__{the students look at keating as if he has just gone mad.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{go on, rip out the entire page. you heard me, rip it out. rip it out!}
<A>__{charlie looks around at the others. he then looks down at his own notes, which consists of drawing breasts.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{go on, rip it out.}
<A>__{charlie rips the page out and holds it up.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{thank you mr. dalton. gentlemen, tell you what, don't just tear out that page, tear out the entire introduction. i want it gone, history. leave nothing of it. rip it out. rip! begone j. evans pritchard, ph.d. rip, shred, tear. rip it out. i want to hear nothing but ripping of mr. pritchard.}
<A>__{meeks looks around reluctantly and then finally begins tearing out pages.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{we'll perforate it, put it on a roll.}
<A>__{keating sees cameron still hesitating.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{it's not the bible, you're not going to go to hell for this. go on, make a clean tear, i want nothing left of it.}
<A>__{keating goes over to his room. cameron turns around to neil.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{we shouldn't be doing this.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{rip, rip, rip!}
<A>__{neil makes cameron turn back around.}
<C>__{keating }
<D>__{rip it out, rip!}
<A>__{from outside the classroom, mr. mcallister hears all the noise and sees all the students ripping out the pages. he bursts into the room.}
<C>__{mcallister}
<D>__{what the hell is going on here?}
<A>__{the boys all turn around in shock. charlie stuffs a crumpled page into his mouth. keating emerges from his room with a waste paper basket.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{i don't hear enough rips.}
<C>__{mcallister}
<D>__{mr. keating.}
<C>__{keating}

<C>__{keating}
<D>__{i am.}
<C>__{mcallister}
<D>__{ahh, so you are. excuse me.}
<A>__{mr. mcallister slowly backs out of the classroom.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{keep ripping gentlemen. this is a battle, a war. and the casualties could be your hearts and souls.}
<A>__{keating holds out the basket to charlie who spits out a wad of paper.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{thank you mr. dalton. armies of academics going forward, measuring poetry. no, we will not have that here. no more of mr. j. evans pritchard. now in my class you will learn to think for yourselves again. you will learn to savor words and language. no matter what anybody tells you, words and ideas can change the world. i see that look in mr. pitt's eye, like nineteenth century literature has nothing to do with going to business school or medical school. right? maybe. mr. hopkins, you may agree with him, thinking "yes, we should simply study our mr. pritchard and learn our rhyme and meter and go quietly about the business of achieving other ambitions." i have a little secret for ya. huddle up. huddle up!}
<A>__{the boys get up from their seats and gather around keating in the center of the class.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{we don't read and write poetry because it's cute. we read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. and the human race is filled with passion. medicine, law, business, engineering, these are all noble pursuits, and necessary to sustain life. but poetry, beauty, romance, love, these are what we stay alive for. to quote from whitman: "o me, o life of the questions of these recurring, of the endless trains of the faithless, of cities filled with the foolish. what good amid these, o me, o life? answer: that you are here. that life exists, and identity. that the powerful play goes on, and you may contribute a verse. that the powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse.}

<D>__{i'm sorry if i shocked you, mr. mcallister.}
<C>__{mcallister}
<D>__{oh, there's no need to apologize. it was very fascinating, misguided though it was.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{you think so?}
<C>__{mcallister}
<D>__{you take a big risk by encouraging them to be artists john. when they realize they're not rembrandts, shakespeares or mozarts, they'll hate you for it.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{we're not talking artists george, we're talking free thinkers.}
<C>__{mcallister}
<D>__{free thinkers at seventeen?}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{funny, i never pegged you as a cynic.}
<C>__{mcallister}
<P>__{(taken aback by the comment)}
<D>__{not a cynic, a realist. show me the heart unfettered by foolish dreams, and i will show you a happy man.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{but only in their dreams can man be truly free. 'twas always thus, and always thus will be.}

<C>__{neil}
<D>__{what was the dead poets society?}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{i doubt the present administration would look too favorably upon that.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{why? what was it?}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{gentlemen, can you keep a secret?}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{the other boys crouch down around keating.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{the dead poets were dedicated to sucking the marrow out of life. that's a phrase from thoreau that we'd invoke at the beginning of each meeting. you see we'd gather at the old indian cave and take turns reading from thoreau, whitman, shelley; the biggies. even some of our own verse. and in the enchantment of the moment we'd let poetry work its magic.}
<C>__{knox}
<D>__{you mean it was a bunch of guys sitting around reading poetry?}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{no mr. overstreet, it wasn't just "guys", we weren't a greek organization, we were romantics. we didn't just read poetry, we let it drip from our tongues like honey. spirits soared, women swooned, and gods were created, gentlemen, not a bad way to spend an evening eh? thank you mr. perry for this trip down amnesia lane. burn that, especially my picture.}

<C>__{keating}
<D>__{mr. pitts, taking his time. he knew he'll get there one day. mr. cameron, you could see him thinking, "is this right? it might be right. it might be right. i know that. maybe not. i don't know."}
<A>__{keating begins walking with his groin pushed forward.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{mr. overstreet, driven by deeper force. yes. we know that. all right. now, i didn't bring them up here to ridicule them. i brought them up here to illustrate the point of conformity: the difficulty in maintaining your own beliefs in the face of others. now, those of you i see the look in your eyes like, "i would've walked differently." well, ask yourselves why you were clapping. now, we all have a great need for acceptance. but you must trust that your beliefs are unique, your own, even though others may think them odd or unpopular, even though the herd may go, "that's baaaaad." robert frost said, "two roads diverged in a wood and i, i took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference." now, i want you to find your own walk right now. your own way of striding, pacing. any direction. anything you want. whether it's proud, whether it's silly, anything. gentlemen, the courtyard is yours.}
<A>__{the students begin walking about, some walking casually, others making up silly walks. keating notices that charlie is still leaning up against one of the pillars.}

<C>__{neil}
<D>__{todd, i think you're underestimating the value of this desk set.}
<A>__{neil picks up the desk set and begins examining it more closely.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{i mean, who would want a football or a baseball, or }
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{or a car.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{or a car if they could have a desk set as wonderful as this one? i mean, if, if i were ever going to buy a, a desk set twice, i would probably buy this one both times. in fact, its, its shape is, it's rather aerodynamic, isn't it? i can feel it. this desk set wants to fly.}
<A>__{neil tosses the desk set lightly in the air. todd stands up and neil hands him the desk set.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{todd? the world's first unmanned flying desk set.}

<D>__{english. oh, long before your time. it was hard giving it up, i can tell you. i'm hearing rumors, john, about some unorthodox teaching methods in your classroom. i'm not saying they've anything to do with the dalton boy's outburst. but i don't think i have to warn you boys his age are very impressionable.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{well, your reprimand made quite an impression, i'm sure.}

<C>__{keating}

<C>__{neil}
<D>__{i can't talk to him this way.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{then you're acting for him, too. you're playing the part of the dutiful son. i know this sounds impossible, but you have to talk to him. you have to show him who you are, what your heart is.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{i know what he'll say. he'll tell me that acting's a whim, and i should forget it. that how they're counting on me. he'll just tell me to put it out of my mind, "for my own good."}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{you are not an indentured servant. if it's not a whim for you, you prove it to him by your conviction and your passion. you show him that and if he still doesn't believe you, well, by then you'll be out of school and you can do anything you want.}
