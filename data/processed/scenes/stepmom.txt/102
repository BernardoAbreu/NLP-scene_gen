<L>__{exterior chapel night}
<A>__{family and friends are leaving the wake, exiting the softly lit chapel into a snowy night. they are saying goodbyes, kissing one another, going to their cars. and saying her last goodbye... ...rachel turns to luke. whispers, close to his ear. he looks at her for a beat, then leads annabelle and ben toward the car, as... rachel goes back into the chapel. alone.}
<L>__{interior funeral parlor}
<A>__{the room is nearly dark. one soft spot plays on a simple casket. no canned organ music, no sound at all. as rachel enters. she goes to the casket. stares down at it for a beat. and just above a whisper...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{see, i told you i'd do this.}
<A>__{only...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{only. now i don't know what to say.}
<A>__{her hand reaches out. a finger absently traces the edge of the wood. it seems a gesture of unconscious affection.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you'd have written it down, so you wouldn't blow it.}
<A>__{a slight smile. here's where the love shows.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{maybe we should change places.}
<A>__{nods slightly. maybe we should. she takes a step back now, to a waiting chair. sits. her hands folded in her lap. thinks.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{well. we were less than friends, i guess. and more.}
<A>__{more.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{we were never...girlfriends, we never dished. that wasn't. what we had.}
<A>__{no apology there. it's just the truth.}

<A>__{thinking. of how much more she'll miss.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{we've got our secrets, we have. and i will keep 'em if you will.}
<A>__{crosses her arms. lost in the moment.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{but i wish we had one more night. in that little bar, remember? remember that toast? sure, you do.}
<A>__{her voice wavers. but the eyes are dry.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{know what? i forgive me, too. see? you're the magician.}
<A>__{a murmur...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{don't worry, partner, i've got your back. we're covered.}
