<L>__{interior irv's kitchen day}
<A>__{cris makes a lamb roast, studding it with cloves of garlic.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{i've got the place all picked out. it's called palau. three hundred teeny islands in the south pacific.}
<P>__{(places roast in pan)}
<D>__{nothing ever happens there, so there's nothing to foresee.}
<C>__{irv}
<D>__{then what the hell are you waiting for?}
<A>__{cris puts the roasting pan in the oven.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{her.}
<C>__{irv}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{i haven't met her yet.}
<C>__{irv}
<D>__{then find somebody else!}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{it has to be her.}
<C>__{irv}
<D>__{what's so special about this one?}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{she's the mother of my child.}
<A>__{irv stops shuffling the cards.}
<C>__{irv}
<D>__{i thought you were shooting blanks.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{i guess the doctors were wrong.}
<C>__{irv}
<D>__{i don't mean to be indelicate, my friend, but how do you know the little bastard is yours?}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{he's got my thing.}
<C>__{irv}
<D>__{your thing?}
<A>__{cris holds up his hand, revealing that the skin between his two middle fingers is webbed a little higher than normal.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{my thing.}
<C>__{irv}
<D>__{i still don't understand why you never got that fixed.}
<A>__{cris laughs...then suddenly stops.}
<D>__{cris she's here.}
<A>__{he walks to the door and opens it to discover ferris standing there, with her finger about to press the doorbell.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{agent ferris, come in.}
<A>__{she regards cris with appreciation.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{one step ahead of the game. cris always.}
<A>__{she enters. tries not to be intimidated by his ability or appearance. sees irv, watching them.}
<D>__{ferris is there some place we can speak privately?}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{let's go in the kitchen. i've got a roast in the oven. irv no, you two stay here. i will watch the food.}
<A>__{once out of ferris' eyeline, irv queries cris with his hand in the shape of a gun. cris shakes his head, then turns to ferris and waits for her to begin.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{you're wasting your life, cris. you have the most amazing talent, and you're running from it.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{yeah, people say i could have been a chef. ferris don't be cute. there's too much at stake here.}
<A>__{her gravity anchors him.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{now if you say that man in the liquor store was going to shoot five people, i believe you. why else would you kill a stranger?}
<A>__{cris guards his reaction.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{but no good deed goes unpunished, eh?}
<C>__{ferris }
<D>__{and that's how it's going to be in this world. people will either hate you or want to exploit you.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{everyone but you, of course.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{i can fix your legal problems. more importantly, i can give you a chance to use your gift.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{trust me, it's better if i don't. it's better if i just mind my own business.}
<A>__{ferris looks at him, disapproving.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{i will be honest with you, cris. that's not an option. your country needs you. and if we don't grab you, somebody else will.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{nobody's grabbed me yet. ferris you're up against more powerful forces now.}
<A>__{she lets that sink in.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{i'd like you to come with me for some testing. would you be willing to do that?}
<A>__{cris's expression grows dark. he looks at ferris accusingly, then bolts away, toward the kitchen.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<A>__{cris covers his eyes and dives to the floor as stun grenades shatter windows and explode with a flash.}
<C>__{ferris}
<P>__{(temporarily blinded)}
<D>__{shit! cavanaugh!}
<A>__{gas grenades follow. cris scrambles to his feet as a nevada police swat team bursts through windows and doors, wearing gas masks and goggles, scanning with laser guided rifles. they find cris, dashing for the back door. open fire. cris tumbles, dodges a few bullets, then takes a hit in the shoulder, the back, the leg. staggers forward. absorbs dozens of bullets. falls. lies there. dying. cavanaugh steps up to deliver the final shot.}
