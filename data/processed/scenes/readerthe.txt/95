<A>__{there is a row of six defendants. the fifth woman is hanna, her hair tied in a knot, her gaze fixedly into the middle distance, not looking towards the spectators. she is wearing a grey dress with short sleeves. they all sit, sideways to the gallery. hanna rises to her feet. the words seem to come very quietly, across a great distance.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{your name is hanna schmitz?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{it is only when the judge repeats the name that michael looks up, hearing it for the first time.}
