<L>__{exterior city full shot}
<A>__{the dome of the city torn. lightning effects playing on the stunned people...who look up and see the starry heavens, too, as they stumble forward into the darkness. a wind begins to blow...where air had never stirred anything. there is a sense of wonder. hysteria is lessening...as the people find themselves moving through the crack...as they discover the fact that the crystals have disappeared from their palms. some are joyful...others frightened...others puzzled...as they emerge from the crack in the dome at: full angle the acres of strange stepped construction we can still see the fires in the b.g. of the shot as logan holds on to jessica...(like gable onto jeanette macdonald at the end of san francisco)...full of happiness and hope for the future. as people continue to mill all over the acres of strange stepped construction...we see the old man walking into the shot. logan and jessica run to him. he looks around. people start to gather...they have never seen a white haired old man in their lives. as people continue to gather around the old man... who couldn't be more delighted...logan and jessica are smiling...inviting people to touch him...and some do. yes, he is an old man...yes, they will all live again to be old men and old women...yes, this is the world renewing itself once again.}
