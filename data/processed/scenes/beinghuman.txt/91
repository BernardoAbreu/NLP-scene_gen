<L>__{exterior river dusk}
<A>__{hector has reached the river, but it is already growing dark and the boatman has gone for the night. hector sees the boat, dragged out of the water. he sits down against the trunk of a large tree. his eyes begin to close.}
<L>__{exterior raft morning}
<A>__{hector awakes. he looks around him. he is on a huge raft, made of ship's timbers. we have left our previous hector sitting under his tree 400 years ago. this hector is awakening into what might be a nightmare. the huge raft is many smaller rafts lashed together. there are over a hundred and fifty people perched on them, lying or squatting in sleep. it is early morning. the sea is calm around them, but the deep ocean swell is still there to remind them of their predicament, menacing, like a controlled anger. hector is fully awake now, sitting against some boxes. he speaks to andre sitting close by. andre is hector's slave, still bound to him in service through shipwreck and disaster. our hector is now a master. andre is a young asian. a quiet, capable, intelligent man, but with that same lost look in his eyes that hector had as a slave. he too is far from home.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i had a wonderful dream. i was lying under a tree, beside a river. i was dozing. i heard the water... beautiful clear water. i got up and drank some. i think i ate some raspberries too.}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{i would like some water.}
<A>__{hector looks around him at the squalid mass of distressed humanity.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{god, this is the worst, the worst.}
<A>__{some figures rise and an argument takes place, like a domestic squabble. we can hear some of their exchanges.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{let me keep him... they said we'll find land in a day or so... you're evil...}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{when they're dead they go over the side... the place stinks enough as it is...}
<A>__{there is a flurry of movement amongst the figures, then a splash, then a cry of a woman. the noise has awakened others. all over the raft figures are coming awake, sitting up, taking in the new day, and the dreadful reality of their situation. andre speaks to hector.}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{do you think i will still see europe?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i think there's more chance of me eating you, andre.}
<A>__{the more we see of the people, their costumes, weapons, mannerisms, the easier we will place them in their time. they are survivors of a foundered ship some time at the height of the great colonial empires. the year could be 1590. the place is the indian ocean. hector turns his eyes to another part of the raft, closer to him. he watches a man and woman. the woman, ursula, still has her eyes closed, sleeping on a pile of canvas. the man, francisco, stands beside her holding a cloak over her to protect her from sea spray. his eye catches hector's, and they hold each other's gaze for a long time. there is antipathy but also pain in their look. a man, dom paulo, moves among the waking wretches. he speaks with authority.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{i think today will be the day, my friends. we've been in the inshore currents since yesterday. three crowns to the first one to sight the coast. god preserve us all.}
<A>__{someone speaks from under a crude canvas shelter.}
<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{never mind the three crowns... a side of beef would do... or a drink of clean water.}
<A>__{dom paulo strides off to his station by the makeshift rudder.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{don't worry, there'll be food for all ashore. africa's full of meat and drink.}
<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{it's full of africans too.}
