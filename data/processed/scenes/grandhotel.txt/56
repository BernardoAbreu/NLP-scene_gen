<A>__{kringelein shows signs of exhaustion. flaemmchen watches him quickly.}
<C>__{flaemmchen}
<D>__{let's stop i'm tired.}
<A>__{it is obvious that she has stopped because of kringelein's distress.}
<C>__{kringelein}
<D>__{thank you, miss flaemm.}

<C>__{kringelein}
<D>__{you don't like to see me enjoying myself.}

<D>__{me?}
<C>__{preysing}
<D>__{yes you shut your mouth get out you're discharged.}
<A>__{kringelein's hat has fallen from the stool upon the floor. flaemmchen picks it up, brushes it. kringelein starts to laugh. the baron steps into the scene. the doctor slowly comes from the bar.}
<C>__{kringelein}
<D>__{you can't discharge me i'm my own master now at last. i'm ill, i'm going to die do you understand? i'm going to die very soon. nothing can happen to me now. nobody can do anything any more to me. by the time you can have discharged me i shall have been dead already.}
<P>__{(his laugh becomes a convulsive sob)}
<A>__{the baron steps between the two looking straight into preysing's face.}
