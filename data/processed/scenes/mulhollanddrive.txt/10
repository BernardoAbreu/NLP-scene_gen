<A>__{the woman slides down a hill through tangles of hostile desert plants. sirens can be heard in the distance. she crosses through some trees and is suddenly confronted by a coyote which snarls and leaps at her. she screams and strikes out with her purse in self defense. the coyote backs away snarling. the woman then loses control and runs at the coyote and it races off. she falls to the ground. we can hear the thunder of her heartbeat as the sirens grow louder. she gets up and stumbles through the trees. when she clears them she is standing overlooking all of los angeles glowing down below. she clumsily starts down toward it.}
