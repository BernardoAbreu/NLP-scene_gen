<L>__{int control room day}
<A>__{the door hisses open, revealing an elaborate technology crammed room. in dim light, clusters of computer consoles and video monitors glow. nedry sits in a corner at a keyboard with a pile of papers next to him, typing away. john arnold, 45, park supervisor, sits directing the activities of the park and chain smoking. there are large windows looking out to the park, one of which is cracked and being replaced from the outside by a team of workmen. hammond wears a big smile as he leads in his entourage. he's the ringmaster.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{and this is the right side of my brain. the entire park is safely controlled from here. john arnold, that genius over there, is the m}
<A>__{aster control operator.}
<P>__{(with genuine concern)}
<D>__{john, don't smoke so much, you're far too valuable a man to me.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{oh, you'd survive just fine without me.}
<A>__{arnold exhales smoke and waves good naturedly. nedry stares darkly at hammond, who ignores him.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{everything's controlled from here. remote everything. cars, feeding programs, medicine dispensers, fecal clean up and that can be tons in a park like this. we run this place with twenty workers. this computer does it all. and it polices each and every single animal out there.}
<C>__{ellie}
<P>__{(whispers to grant)}
<D>__{who polices the computer?}
<A>__{hammond points up. overlooking the control room and the park is a raised platform with a huge chair, like a throne in a court. a large video screen faces this chair.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{that's where i will watch the astonished watchers. okay, let's go.}
<A>__{they practically race as a group to keep up with hammond. the security door seals shit, leaving nedry and arnold alone again.}
<C>__{nedry}
<D>__{thanks for the kind word, mr. hammond.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{come on, dennis, he knows your technical contributions have made it all possible.}
<C>__{nedry}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{back on hallway hammond and his group turn off the corridor and reach a door marked: caution: teratogenic substances. timmy backs off, grabs lex's arm.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{that stuff turns you into a mutant!}
<A>__{he contorts his face into strange shapes. as hammond leads them all in lex pulls on his pocket.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{don't mind the signs. they're only legal precautions.}
<A>__{gennaro frowns. the door opens and lex peeks in.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{my laboratory, lex. it will be yours and timmy's someday.}
