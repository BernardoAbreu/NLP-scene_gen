<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{another huge rock on the other side of the path}
<A>__{again fezzik charges, slower this time, but still a charge, and again he spins and creams the man in black against the rough boulder.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{the man in black}
<A>__{and the punishment is terrible, and for a moment it seems as if he is going to let go of fezzik's windpipe and crumble, but he doesn't, he holds on.}
<C>__{man in black}
<D>__{why should that make such a difference?}
<C>__{fezzik}
<D>__{well ...}
<P>__{(and now his voice is definitely growing weaker)}
<D>__{... you see, you use different moves when you're fighting half a dozen people than when you only have to be worried about one.}
<A>__{again fezzik slams the man in black against a boulder, only this time his power has diminished and fezzik starts to slowly collapse.}
