<L>__{interior airplane day}
<A>__{on a chartered plane flying from miami to newark airport. jack is the captain. his copilot paul is seated beside him. in the passenger cabin, a female gymnastics team is celebrating a hard won, glorious victory over the miami team. they are singing, dancing in the aisles and drinking champagne. in the rear of the cabin, there are three regular pass engers: a teenager, his mother, and a man who appears to be a businessman. the plane is flying over the coastline. the partition between the cockpit and the passenger cabin is open. jack is very excited. he can't stop turning around to look at the passengers.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to paul)}
<D>__{oh my god! i can't believe my eyes! look at these women! will you look at the gorgeous calves on them?! i'm telling you, give me an athlete any day... oh god! look at that redhead over there, and look at that one! christ, i hadn't noticed her.}
<P>__{(miming a heart attack)}
<D>__{paul, i've just fallen madly in love with the most beautiful woman in the world...}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(totally uninterested)}
<D>__{oh yeah? which one?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(as though about to keel over)}
<D>__{the blonde over there, she's too gorgeous for words. just look at those eyes, look at those shoulders and the way she moves. i'm in love. here, take over, i will be right back.}
<A>__{jack gets up and paul takes his place at the controls. jack makes his way up the aisle, through the girls who are blocking the way, to the object of his affections. she is sitting in one of the aisle seats and singing her head off. jack leans over and whispers, quickly and intensely, to her.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hello. i'm the captain of this plane. may i ask your name?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{sure, my name is jane. why?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{listen, jane, i've seen many beautiful women in my life but i swear to you, i've never, ever met a woman as exquisite as you are.}
<A>__{jack kneels down before her, and the girl looks at him, amused. he takes her hand and places it over his heart.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{jane, can you feel my heart? it's pounding. this is horrible, i think i'm gonna fainterior listen: i'm madly in love with you, i'm single and here's my phone number.}
<A>__{he hands her his business card.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm putting my fate in your hands. if you don't call me, you'll make me the most miserable man on earth. this is no line and i'm not trying to get you into bed. this is something completely different. i love you jane and if you call me i will be the happiest man in the entire universe this is 'love at first sight.' out of all these beautiful women i noticed only you, and...}
<A>__{the girl laughs as jack goes on. meanwhile, the busi nessman who was seated in the rear of the plane has gotten up and walked over to jack.}

<P>__{(back to jane)}
<D>__{i'm leaving it all up to you, jane, but if you do give me your phone number, then jane, then...}
<A>__{the businessman has reached the cockpit.}

<D>__{that's some magnificent view, isn't it?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's wonderful life is wonderful!}
<A>__{the businessman goes back to his seat and jack grabs hold of the microphone.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{this is your captain speaking. in honor of your victory, in honor of your beauty, and in honor of jane, the most beautiful gymnast i have ever met. i'm going to give you a little demonstration of aviation gymnastics reserved only for the most important guest, hip, hip...}
<A>__{everyone shouts "hooray!" except for paul and the businessman, who remain grim. jack dips the plane very low over the water and skims the cliffs along the coast. it is a beautiful, impressive stunt. there are gleeful shouts in the cabin among the passengers.}
<L>__{interior newark airport passenger terminal day}
<A>__{jack is saying an emotional goodbye to jane as she leaves with her teammates. jane finds it all very funny, but jack looks totally wretched seeing her go. jack and paul walk toward the exit.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{god, what a woman!}
<A>__{paul is nervous, glancing uneasily from car to car.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{wanna share a cab? paul yeah, sure!}
<A>__{a black ford pulls up in front of them and its driver looks at paul who immediately turns his back on him.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{she's so beautiful! i've never been so in love before. can you believe she gave me her phone number... oh, christ where is it?... oh, no, don't tell me i lost it... it's a matter of life and death... oh here it is thank god!}
<A>__{all the while jack has been rambling on, a beige car on the other side of the street has slowed down. paul notices it. in the beige car, a narcotics agent, graton, is behind the wheel with one of his colleagues sitting beside him.}
<C>__{graton}
<D>__{they're slowing down. take a picture.}
<A>__{the colleague snaps a picture of everyone who happens to be standing near the black ford, including jack and paul. the black ford pulls out. the beige car follows it. paul observes all this out of the corner of his eye.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{listen, i need a favor, i got a little problem.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah, sure... hey, look, will you look at that sparkling beauty.}
<A>__{a very beautiful woman is coming down the walkway with cart overflowing with luggage. one of them falls off.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah... i mean, it's like... there's this little package...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{she'll never make it with all that luggage she's got. i gotta give her a hand. look at the colors in her hair! christ, i've never seen a woman like her before...}
<A>__{he's about to walk off when paul grabs him by the arm.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{jack, listen, can i...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{sure you can, no problem... listen, i gotta go now, i'm gonna see if she'll share a cab with me. you take the shuttle, okay?}

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{come over to my place tonight. we're having a huge party. come around 9, okay? see ya later.}
<A>__{jack races toward the woman and begins to help her with the fallen luggage. we see him talking to her and we can hear a little of what he's saying.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{as exquisite as you are... i think i'm gonna fainterior}
<A>__{he kneels, takes her hand and puts it over his heart. the young woman is flabbergasted. a lonely looking paul hails the shuttle bus.}
<L>__{interior apartment night}
<A>__{a large, stylishly decorated apartment in manhattan. a tremendous living room. a party's going on. very loud jazz is playing. the lights are dim. there are about 30 guests. lots of young pretty women. gourmet buffet. people are sitting on couches talking, others are eating, drinking or dancing. in a dimly lit corner, jack is kneeling before a girl sitting in an armchair. she is laughing as she listens to him.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(whispering passionately)}
<D>__{this is no line and i'm not trying to get you into bed. this is something completely different. this is 'love at first sight.' oh, i'm so happy... let me go get you a glass of champagne. i will be right back.}
<A>__{jack gets up and goes over to the buffet. as soon as he's out of the girl's line of sight, he starts running toward the other end of the apartment. on the way he passes michael, who's deeply engrossed in a vehement conversation about modern art with a girl called sophia. they're fighting like cats and dogs but seem to be enjoy ing it.}
<C>__{sophia}
<D>__{are you saying that's art, are you really saying that's art? well then you explain why.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{it goes back to prehistoric man. they had comic strips on their walls, for god's sake.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(whispering}

<P>__{(to sophia)}
<D>__{wait one second for me, i will be right back.}
<A>__{michael walks off in the direction of rosalie. paul is wandering among the guests, trying to find jack, he sees peter who is talking with another young woman, nicole. peter is nodding, idly looking around, com pletely uninterested in the conversation.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{you guys have a beautiful place here. but the rent must be a killer.}
<A>__{peter isn't paying attention.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{isn't it a killer?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{what?...}
<C>__{peter }
<D>__{oh, the rent... yeah, it's high but split between the three of us it isn't that bad, as long as we don't eat.}
<A>__{nicole laughs.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{hi peter, i'm looking for jack, have you seen him?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{oh hi, paul, how are you doing? yeah, sure, i will take you to jack.}
<P>__{(to nicole)}
<D>__{excuse me for a minute.}
<A>__{they move away.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{you're a lifesaver, i've been trying to get away from that woman for 20 minutes. that sonofabitch carl is moving in on my natalie. gotta go... bye.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{wait what about jack?}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(in a hurry)}
<D>__{he's around somewhere. check under all the couches.}
<A>__{paul walks off in jack's direction. we stay with peter, who reaches natalie. she is talking with a very styl ishly dressed, tall, young man, carl.}

<C>__{carl}
<D>__{all night? i just saw you deep in conversation with nicole!}
<C>__{peter}

<D>__{oh come on peter, we all know what a ladies' man you are.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{who, me? jack's the ladies' man, not me. you're the only lady i'm after.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{so tell me, how's your project coming along? i heard you're not ready yet.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{we've still got two weeks left before the semi finals. we'll be ready.}

<D>__{oh really? you've seen it?}
<C>__{natalie}

<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(in a bad mood)}
<D>__{ours is incredible too.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{if you ever get it finished.}
<A>__{paul comes up to jack, who is kneeling before clementine, whispering passionate sweet nothings in her ear. it appears he's gotten beyond the "this is love at first sight" stage. he's getting down to the nitty gritty now. clementine is thrilled. paul taps jack on the shoulder.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{jack, can i talk to you for a second?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, hi, paul, yeah sure...}
<C>__{jack }
<P>__{(to clementine)}
<D>__{... please darling, don't move... i will be right back, okay? i will bring us back some champagne...}
<A>__{he disappears with paul.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you're a lifesaver, paul. i thought i'd never get away. rosalie's waiting for me in the living room. isn't she terrific?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{who? rosalie?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{clementine.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{oh yeah, for sure, i dunno. listen, can you do me a favor?}
<A>__{with some difficulty, paul follows jack as he picks his way through the people dancing, heading in rosalie's direction.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah... what kind of favor? damn, i've got to get her a glass of champagne.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{listen, i've got a little problem. i'm having a valuable package delivered to me on sunday, but i'm not going to be home. i've got to do the hawaii tahiti australia route, so can i have the package delivered here instead?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(filling a glass with champagne)}
<D>__{yeah, sure, of course.}
<P>__{(he stops, thinking)}
<D>__{no, wait, i'm leaving for south america tomorrow. i will be gone for three weeks.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{but it's okay. peter and michael will be here. they'll take care of it.}

<C>__{paul}
<D>__{this is a very delicate matter, jack. it's very important they don't tell anybody about this package. it could be very... uh, embarrassing for me, you know what i'm saying?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{sure. you got it. i will see you later...}
<A>__{jack is about to rejoin rosalie. paul grabs his arm.}

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{uh oh. too late.}

<D>__{he's an asshole!}
<P>__{(mimicking carl)}
<D>__{'i heard you're not ready yet.' 'we're gonna kick your ass.' well, we may be behind schedule, but we're still going to beat that sonofabitch and maybe i haven't scored with natalie yet, but neither has he. she's not an easy lay, that's what i like about her. you know what they say: it ain't over till it's over.}
<A>__{peter and michael go into the living room. peter is picking up glasses. michael is emptying ashtrays into the wastebasket.}

<C>__{peter}
<D>__{michael, all you want to do is steal jack's girl friends. you don't give a shit about the women themselves...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{that's not true. it's just that sophia drives me crazy. she knows all the right buttons to push to make me mad.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(going into the kitchen)}

<C>__{michael}
<D>__{well, i don't give a damn anyway, i have 24 drawings to hand in to my editor three days from now and i gotta work all night anyway... so it was all for the best. but you better not leave that maxine's phone number lying around because when i'm done...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{don't worry, i will leave you her phone number on the hall table. if she's really terrific i will put a big 'x' next to it. 'bye, guys love ya. i won't wake you tomorrow morning. see you in three weeks...}
<L>__{interior apartment dawn}
<A>__{jack and maxine noiselessly exit the apartment. jack is wearing his pilot's uniform. maxine pushes the button for the elevator. jack sneaks back into the apartment and leaves a note on the hall table that says: "maxine}

<L>__{exterior interior newark airport plane}
<A>__{jack is in the cockpit with his copilot, ron. the engines are revving. jack is checking gauges. he looks out the window idly and sees: the crew of another plane walking across the tarmac. paul is one of the crew. paul sees jack and begins to gesture wildly, but his voice is drowned out by the noise of the engines. just seeing paul is enough to remind jack about his package.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{damn! i forgot to tell them about the package!}
<P>__{(to ron)}
<D>__{i gotta make a quick phone call. i will be right back.}

<A>__{in the architecture firm of which peter is one of three partners. the whole staff, about 15 people in all, is gathered around a large model, the project for a big amusement park. they all seem worried about something. jerry, one of peter's partners, seems particularly angry.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{the model's not finished, the blueprints are a mess and you may as well forget the specs, they're a disaster! i know we're talented. i know we're good. then why is it we can never get organized? why is it we're always behind schedule?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{look, jerry, architects since leonardo have always been behind schedule. it's a tradition, for god's sake. why break with tradition?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{because this is the chance of a lifetime for our company, and there happens to be a deadline. there are millions of dollars at stake here. and our main competition had their project in three days ago!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yeah, but word around town is their project's a piece of shit!}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{of course, it's a piece of shit, but it's a ready piece of shit.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{we're just going to have to buckle down, that's all.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{you're damn right we are. starting now, everybody works around the clock! everybody! we have two weeks to be ready for the semi final selection. and we will be ready. and we will win. you want to know why we'll win?}

<L>__{interior apartment hallway day}
<A>__{peter opens the front door, he stumbles over an object, looks down; at his feet he sees a wicker basket lined with pretty pink and white checked gingham. in the basket a tiny baby lies fast asleep, her head gently resting on a lace pillow. peter looks at this object in amazement. there is an envelope pinned to the basket with the words, "for jack" written on it. peter picks up the letter he opens it and reads.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(to himself)}

<C>__{peter}
<D>__{no, please leave the mothers out of this, okay?! it's only four days. we should be able to handle that, besides you know the rule around here: it's fine to have a woman over once in a while, but...}

<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{down there by the meat section.}
<A>__{peter heads for it purposefully. when he gets to the right aisle, he stops short, taken aback: a vast range of products extends before him. he starts examining the baby food jars and cans of formulas, going from one to the next, not knowing where to begin.}
<L>__{interior apartment day}
<A>__{michael is still in the hall holding mary very clumsily in his arms. he is anxious. he realizes she's soaked. this disgusts him. he holds her at arm's length; she squirms. he goes and gets a towel from the bathroom, spreads it out on the living room couch and lays the baby down on it. mary screams she much prefers michael's arms to the couch. a panicky michael picks her up again, grumbling.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{okay, okay, don't cry like that... i will hold you, i will hold you.}
<A>__{he tries rather unsuccessfully to wrap the towel around the child. obviously michael is very put off by the smell coming from mary.}

<L>__{50's, who is tall and heavy, somewhat gruff and masculine}
<A>__{in appearance, and wearing slacks and a smock.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{so what's the best brand?}
<C>__{store clerk}
<D>__{depends on what your pediatrician recommends.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{oh right, the pediatrician... but which one sells the most?}
<C>__{store clerk}
<P>__{(pointing to a can)}
<D>__{this kind.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{oh, so this is the best kind?}
<C>__{store clerk}
<D>__{it's the cheapest.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{then it's the worst kind?}
<C>__{store clerk}
<D>__{they're all good, sir.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(pointing to another can)}
<D>__{oh, okay, then i can take this kind.}
<C>__{store clerk}
<D>__{it's got iron in it.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{oh. is that good or bad?}
<C>__{store clerk}
<D>__{it's very good.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well, why don't they all have iron in them?}
<C>__{store clerk}
<D>__{some babies are allergic to iron.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(pointing to yet another can)}
<D>__{oh, okay, well i will take this kind then.}
<C>__{store clerk}
<D>__{that kind doesn't have any milk in it.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{oh, i see, there's milk with no milk in it?}
<C>__{store clerk}
<D>__{some babies are allergic to milk.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{so what's the stuff that no babies are allergic to?}
<C>__{store clerk}
<D>__{soy formula.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{oh, okay, i will take the soy formula.}
<A>__{he takes a can.}
<C>__{store clerk}
<D>__{that one's advance.}

<C>__{store clerk}
<D>__{how old's your baby?}

<L>__{interior apartment day}
<A>__{mary is screaming in michael's arms as he walks her up and down the whole apartment. now there are three towels wrapped around her. michael is exasperated. he angrily sings her a lullaby.}

<L>__{interior safeway day}
<A>__{now peter is surrounded by three women arguing: the store clerk standing with her arms crossed and haughtily looking down on everyone; an efficient, practical sort of young woman (woman #1); and another thin, pale woman whose baby is lying in a baby carrier in her shopping cart and who seems very nervous (woman #2).}
<D>__{woman #1 does she have any teeth yet or not? that would give us a clue as to how old she is.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i haven't looked.}

<D>__{so what about me? what should i buy? woman #2 didn't they even tell you the pediatrician's name?}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(still calm)}
<D>__{no. they didn't. woman #2 you sure have weird friends.}
<C>__{peter}

<C>__{store clerk}
<D>__{my grandson, y'know, he has so much hair you can make a ponytail with it! and i know some kids who are totally bald at a year and a half. so, y'know, how much hair they have... doesn't mean a thing... woman #1}

<L>__{interior apartment day}
<A>__{michael comes into the living room with his box of diapers and a bag of groceries. in addition to the two cops there are now three narcotic agents who are interrogating peter. he is holding mary. the basket is on an armchair.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{hello, officers... what's going on?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{don't worry, michael, it's nothing serious, just a little misunderstanding.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{did you give her the 5:30 bottle?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yeah, i just gave it to her.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{did you change her?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{no, she's soaking wet.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{okay, i will do it.}
<A>__{michael puts down his bag of groceries, takes mary from peter and disappears with the box of diapers. in his room, he lays mary down on his bed and starts undressing her.}
<L>__{interior living room day}
<D>__{agent #1 and who's he?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{he's my roommate. agent #1}
<P>__{(raising an eyebrow)}
<D>__{oh, i see, i see...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{no, you don't see. there are three of us sharing this place. agent #1 oh, three, huh? a regular 'mirage a trois'!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{it's 'menage'... and it's not. we all have lots of girlfriends, thank you. agent #1 uh huh, so what's your friend do?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{he's a cartoonist. agent #1 what about the other guy?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{he's a pilot. agent #1 ah hah... now that's interesting...}
<P>__{(to his colleague)}
<D>__{... get me those photographs, the ones taken at newark airport.}
<A>__{agent #1 looks in his attache case.}
<D>__{agent #1 so does this friend of yours ever fly to south america?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{no. never. only north america.}
<A>__{the phone rings.}
<D>__{agent #1 would you object if i answered it for you?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{not at all, go right ahead. i've got nothing to hide.}
<A>__{agent #1 picks up the phone and listens.}
<D>__{agent #1 it's a collect call from a jack collins in la paz, bolivia. that wouldn't happen to be your pilot friend, would it? the one who never goes to south america?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yes, it is him.}
<A>__{agent #1 hands him the phone.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{hello, yes, operator, i accept the charges.}
<A>__{agent #1 gestures to agent #3 to take a look around the apartment. agent #3 slips away.}
<D>__{agent #1 would you mind very much if i listened?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{please, go right ahead.}
<A>__{agent #1 picks up the other telephone.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{hello, jack? fine, yeah. how're you? yeah, he's fine, too. yeah, we left a message for you, right... no, it was nothing special, it was just, i mean... to see how you were doing and all ... no, no emergency. everything's fine.}
<C>__{peter }
<P>__{(loud)}
<D>__{i said everything's fine! the what?... i don't know what you're talking about... oh yeah, the package! yeah, yeah, it got here ... and was picked up, uh huh. hey! why didn't you call sooner? huh? 'cause what?... oh, you're onto something hot well, aren't you the lucky one!... so when are you getting married?... forget it, i was just kidding... well, everything's fine up here. so have a good time. see you in a couple of weeks. 'bye.}
<A>__{peter hangs up. so does agent #1.}
<D>__{agent #1 now that's interesting. so you wanna tell me about this package and the hot something or other your friend lucked onto... in la paz... bolivia... south america?}
<A>__{peter sits down, stunned.}
<L>__{interior michael's room day}
<A>__{mary is lying on michael's bed. he has just finished putting a regular diaper on her. then michael looks for the tampered with diaper in the box. he finds it, checks that it is well sealed, and places it under mary's bottom. just then agent #3 appears in the doorway. michael calmly finishes putting the dope filled diaper on the baby on top of the other one. mary is cooing. every thing appears normal. however, a trained eye might be very surprised by the enormous thickness of the diaper covering the young lady's backside. but a narcotics agent is not necessarily the most qualified person to notice something odd like this. agent #3 silently observes michael, who gives him a big smile as he slips on mary's pajama bottoms. michael picks mary up and for the first time talks to her in the kind of silly babytalk used by adoring parents.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{okey dokey, honeybunch, it's time to go beddy bye now... we're gonna take a nice long nappy wappy...}
<A>__{he goes back to the living room, followed by agent #3. agent #1 is in the process of showing peter a photograph.}
<D>__{agent #1 do you recognize anyone in this picture?}
<A>__{peter looks: it's the photo of jack and paul that was taken at the beginning of the movie.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{sure. this is jack collins. agent #1 oh yeah? now that's interesting.}
<A>__{michael has laid mary down for a nap in her basket, observed by the five cops. he now sits down, cheerful and bubbling over with enthusiasm.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{so! can i get you something to drink?}
<A>__{agent #1 totally ignores him.}
<D>__{agent #1 so, who's the baby belong to?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{it's jack's daughter. agent #1 and why are you two taking care of her?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{because her mother's in europe for six months, and since jack had to be away for two weeks, i took my vacation to take care of her, i love kids.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{yeah, peter and i just love kids! agent #1 now that's interesting. well, we'll be seeing each other again soon, in fact very soon. in the meantime, i'd appreciate it if you didn't leave new york in the next few days.}
<A>__{all the cops head for the door. michael accompanies them, putting on a very urbane act.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{come back anytime, gentlemen. you're always welcome here. we have no particular plans to leave new york in the near future, so don't worry about us now. 'bye now.}
<A>__{once the cops are gone, michael races back to the living room. peter has collapsed into his armchair.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(in a low tone)}
<D>__{christ, what a mess! they'll be on our tails around the clock! how the hell are we gonna get rid of the goddamn dope?! by the way, where is it?}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(also speaking in a low tone)}
<D>__{it's cool, don't worry, i got it stashed.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{where?}
<A>__{michael points to mary's bottom.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{this way it's close at hand!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{are you out of your mind??}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{relax, will you.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{i diapered the dope on her right in front of the cop and he never noticed a thing!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i told the cops we were taking care of her. you realize we're now stuck with the kid till jack comes back. there ain't nobody coming to pick her up, and i have to go back to the office today!}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{wait a minute. you're not gonna stick me with this kid! tell them you need a maternity leave, tell them anything, but we've got to go 50 50 on this!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{and that's not all we haven't heard from the punks yet either!}
<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{hidden within a parked car, three men are keeping a close watch on the entrance to peter, michael and jack's build ing. the two uniformed cops emerge, get in their car, and pull away.}
<L>__{interior apartment day}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(on the phone; things are heating up)}
<D>__{that's right, you heard right: i'm not coming in to work for two weeks... no, i can't explain why...}
<P>__{(in a louder tone)}
<D>__{... because i can't, that's all!... no, this has nothing to do with chasing ass! jerry... jerry! will you stop screaming for a minute and listen? i'm in trouble, you understand? deep trouble... i know... i know...}
<C>__{peter }
<P>__{(yells)}
<D>__{... goddammit, jerry, of course winning the competition is important to me! the firm's my whole life if you must know. no, no, please don't send anyone over here... don't you come either. no, jerry... okay, listen, i will be there in a half hour, but i can't stay long. no! don't come here! i will be right over.}
<A>__{he hangs up. michael enters the room, with his coat on.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i gotta go over to mr. oxman's he just called and he's freaking out. he says if i don't bring some cartoons over now, the deal's off.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{you're going now?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{yeah, but don't worry about it, i will be back before it's time for her next bottle. she's asleep now.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{terrific, just terrific! jerry just called: i have to go to the office right now.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{well, call him back. tell him you'll come later.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{there's no way. i can't, he's suicidal. why don't you call oxman and tell him you'll be there in a few hours.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you're crazy. oxman is leaving in an hour. if i don't meet him before then, i blow my 15,000 dollar contract.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{oh shit, i can't take this anymore!}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{look, maybe we could pawn her off on mrs. razzolini, just for a couple of hours she's crazy about her!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{good idea! let's go.}
<L>__{interior building dusk}
<A>__{peter and michael get out of the elevator on mrs. razzolini's floor. they each are holding one of the handles on the basket. they are walking quickly. suddenly michael stops peter.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{wait i hear someone... i will go see...}
<A>__{peter waits with the basket. michael tiptoes to the corner of the corridor. at the very end of the corridor, on mrs. razzolini's doorstep, he sees the three narcotics agents talking with mrs. razzolini. we can hear snippets of their conversation.}
<C>__{razzolini}
<D>__{yes, i brought a package up to them... i think it was last sunday... agent #1 what are these people like? what kind of lifestyle do they have?}
<A>__{michael hastily returns to peter, still on tiptoes. he leads him back to the elevator and pushes the elevator button.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{just as i thought the goddamn cops are grilling mrs. razzolini.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{oh shit! we sure as hell can't hand her the baby with an ass full of dope... right in front of the narcs!}
<A>__{the elevator has arrived meanwhile.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(breaking down)}
<D>__{what should we do? i really gotta go...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{listen, she's just had her bottle. she's sleeping like a log. let's just leave her in the apartment. what can possibly happen to her? she's as regular as clockwork. she won't wake up till 8:30 and we'll easily be back by then...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yeah, you're right, we won't be long.}
<A>__{they rush into the elevator.}
<L>__{exterior street dusk}
<A>__{the three men, slumped in their car, are watching the door of the apartment building. the three narcotics agents emerge from the building and walk away. a short time goes by. peter and michael emerge from the building and quickly walk away. the three men get out of their car, cross the street and enter the building.}
<L>__{interior apartment night}
<A>__{peter comes out of the elevator, key in hand. he's about to put it in the lock on the door, but stops short the door is already open.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{michael? michael, are you here?}
<A>__{no answer. peter pushes the door open. the sight that greets his eyes is very dismaying. it looks like a tornado has hit the house. everything's on the floor, it's all been smashed, it's all been ripped apart. gone is the beauti ful apartment that had been so lovingly decorated. in its place, utter devastation and shambles. peter stands there speechless for a moment, then an awful thought crosses his mind. he runs like crazy into his room the basket's not there. stepping over the debris and all the things strewn over the floor, he rushes into the living room, then into michael's room. the basket's nowhere to be seen. peter falls apart; without even realizing it, he's moan ing and muttering distractedly. he runs into jack's room, into the kitchen, into the bathroom. the basket is nowhere to be seen. peter runs all over, back and forth ten times in all the rooms. tears are flowing from his eyes. suddenly, he hears faint cries. they're coming from the back bathroom. peter rushes to it, practically ripping the door from its hinges. there on the toilet is the basket, and on it there's a note written in big messy printing which says: "next time we take her." mary looks at peter and smiles; she seems in great shape. a distraught peter picks her up, hugs her tightly and kisses her all over as he takes her into his room. just then, michael appears in the corridor, silent and overwhelmed. he comes to the door to peter's room and looks at him. peter, mortified to have been caught kissing mary, hastily distances himself from her, hold ing her at arm's length. he puts her down on his bed and exits the room.}
<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{the debris has been shoved up against the walls. peter and michael, in their pajamas and dead tired, are slumped over the table. peter is giving mary her bottle. michael is looking at mary as though he were seeing her for the first time.}
<L>__{interior peter's room night}
<A>__{peter is in bed, completely out of it. michael is changing mary very carefully. he puts one diaper on her, then the second one, full of dope. he lays mary down in her basket, then places the basket on the bed, nestled between the wall and peter's body. michael, holding the soiled diaper, silently goes out. once he's alone, peter leans over the basket. mary and he stare at each other intently and seriously. peter switches off the light.}
<L>__{interior apartment dawn}
<A>__{the doorbell rings. michael, asleep on his mattress on the floor in the middle of his wrecked bedroom, emerges from sleep and glances at his clock: it's 6:10 am. he staggers to the front door and opens it. the door is being held together with a string. agents #1, #2, and #3 are at the door, with four other cops backing them up. mrs. razzolini is standing behind them and staring, wide eyed, a look of horror on her face.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{morning, officers. can i help you? agent #1}
<P>__{(holding out a piece of paper to him)}
<D>__{search warrant.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(playing the gentleman, waving away the paper)}
<D>__{i believe you, officer. go ahead, we have nothing to hide. hello, mrs. razzolini!}
<A>__{mrs. razzolini turns her back on him and hurries away. the cops enter the apartment.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you'll have to excuse the mess... we had a few friends over last night... agent #1}
<P>__{(looking at the devastation)}
<D>__{oh, really? well, if i were you i'd get myself some new friends!}
<A>__{peter comes in, in his bathrobe, furious.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{what the hell are you guys looking for, anyway? agent #1 probably the same things your friends were looking for last night! didn't mrs. razzolini bring you a package last sunday?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{you mean the chocolate easter bunnies? we ate them already.}
<A>__{he starts to walk away.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{anyway, you have no idea how many packages we've been getting lately. it's hard to keep track of them. agent #1 maybe we can help.}
<P>__{(to his colleagues)}
<D>__{let's get to work!}
<A>__{all the cops enter the apartment.}
<L>__{interior peter's room day}
<A>__{peter is in bed, with the basket beside him. a narcotics agent is rummaging through his scattered belongings.}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{would you mind if i look in your bed?}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(big smile)}
<D>__{my pleasure. try not to make a mess.}
<A>__{peter gets up, takes the basket off the bed and keeps it in his hands. the agent searches the bed.}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{i will look in the basket, if you don't mind...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{be my guest.}
<A>__{he picks up mary with her huge diaper. the agent searches the whole basket.}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{thank you very much, sorry about this...}
<A>__{he goes out. peter, undaunted, pats mary's big behind.}
<L>__{interior apartment day}
<A>__{the cops are leaving.}
<D>__{agent #1 well, there's obviously been a mistake. as far as you're concerned this investigation is closed. we apologize again.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(big smile)}
<D>__{oh, don't mention it! it was a pleasure having you here! i hope you'll find what you're looking for very soon! agent #1}
<P>__{(looking straight at him)}
<D>__{so do we.}
<A>__{michael closes the door and races into the living room where he discovers peter putting on his jacket.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{did you hear that? he said there'd been a mistake and they weren't going to bother us anymore.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{bullshit, it's a trick.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you think so? really?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{they just said that to put us off guard. they saw the condition this apartment's in.}
<C>__{peter }
<D>__{they know the punks were here looking for the dope and that they probably didn't find it. so that means we've still got it.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{but he said the investigation was closed.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{okay, let's just see how closed it is. i will go downstairs. you watch out the window and see if i'm being tailed.}
<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{michael is peeking out at the street from the window above. peter comes out of the building and turns left, walking very quickly. suddenly, peter stops, turns around and retraces his steps. we can clearly see a man, who was walking about six yards behind peter on the opposite side of the street, also turn around and retrace his steps. it is graton.}
<L>__{interior apartment day}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(entering)}
<D>__{so? was i right?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{there's one guy for sure! a redhead, kind of young, disguised sort of like a college student.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i knew it. they're going to be watching us around the clock. how are we going to get the dope back to the punks?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i have the feeling they'll come to us.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{we'll have to be very careful.}
<L>__{exterior street nightfall}
<A>__{michael is walking on the street carrying two bags of groceries. suddenly, a guy walks up to him and elbows him sharply.}
<C>__{punk}
<D>__{hi! doin' a little shopping, huh? how's your place not too much damage, i hope.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{what do you guys want?}
<C>__{punk}
<D>__{we want the dope. tomorrow.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{and we want to give it to you. but the cops are tailing us nonstop. matter of fact, there's one right behind us now...}
<C>__{punk}
<D>__{that's your problem, man. figure out a way to shake 'em. either we safely get the dope tomorrow, or you, your friend and the kid'll get this.}
<P>__{(he quickly stabs}
<D>__{the grocery bags}
<P>__{three times)}
<D>__{we'll call you tonight.}
<A>__{he runs off, disappearing into the darkness. from the slit open grocery bag milk flows out onto the sidewalk. michael is shaking all over. standing about twenty yards away, graton hasn't missed a thing.}
<L>__{interior cop car night}
<A>__{not far from peter, michael and jack's building, graton, in his car, is talking into the microphone of his police radio.}

<A>__{peter and michael are seated in the living room, which is still an utter wreck. they can't take their eyes off the phone that's between the two of them. they are sitting silently, not moving. mary is playing in her basket. the phone rings. peter and michael both jump three feet in the air. michael picks up the phone.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{hello? who? goddamn it, where are you?...}
<P>__{(to peter)}
<D>__{... it's jack. he just landed in newark. he came back early.}

<D>__{jack? what the hell are you doing?}
<P>__{(listens to a long explanation)}
<D>__{yeah... yeah... oh yeah? well, listen very carefully, jack. that wonderful, fantastic babe you brought back from bolivia? the one you're gonna marry tomorrow? well, you're not going to bring her here!... you are going to say 'goodbye' to her very nicely and put her in a cab back to bolivia... why? because there's another wonderful, fantastic babe waiting for you right here at home ... who is she? oh, that's a surprise! you'll see when you get here. but believe me, she's out of this world. you're going to be up all night with this babe. she's crazy about you.}

<C>__{peter}
<D>__{so hurry home, jack, this little doll can't wait to see you. 'bye.}
<A>__{he hangs up.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(in a furious temper)}

<C>__{michael}
<D>__{hello? listen, tomorrow, central park at the fountain near the merry go round, five o'clock. be there, but...}
<A>__{they've hung up on the other end. michael hangs up and sits down, drained.}

<D>__{... what the hell happened here?}
<A>__{he walks into the apartment, shocked and overwhelmed.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{peter! michael! are you here?}
<A>__{he goes into the living room no one'sthere. into michael's room. no one's there. he goes into his own room, where the destruction is even moreshocking than elsewhere since nothing has been touchedin there.}

<D>__{oh, my god! my beautiful room! my beautiful, beautiful room!}
<P>__{(very angry)}
<D>__{michael!... peter where the hell are you, for chrissakes?}

<D>__{what did i tell you? ten minutes to the second!}
<L>__{interior apartment evening}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{okay, listen, you guys... i've tried everything and nothing's working: my mother's off on a cruise; mrs. razzolini won't speak to us ever since the whole business with the cops we don't want to involve any of our girlfriends; sylvia's taking it easy in europe and there's no way she's gonna come back now that michael went and told her everything's just fine and dandy. peter did a terrific job getting rid of mrs. bretsaws, and all that's left are the daycare centers, but peter's positive they're a breeding pit for a.i.d.s. so you tell me: what are we suppose to do? you want me to split with the kid? or dump her in an orphanage?}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(pretending to play the violin)}
<D>__{here we go.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{look, her mother'll be back in less than five months. let's not waste a shitload of time looking for a solution for such a short time. let's get organized.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what do you mean, organized?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well, you'll have to ask to fly the new york washington shuttle for five months, on account of serious personal problems.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what? never! i'd rather be a subway conductor.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(barking)}
<D>__{then dump her in an orphanage, 'cause there's no way we're gonna take care of her all by ourselves anymore!}

<C>__{jack}

<D>__{no! never.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(unruffled)}
<D>__{that way, you can do the 6 10 a.m. shift. that amounts to two bottles and two diaper changes. you do the shopping when you get home in the evening and that's all. peter, you'll take the 6 10 p.m. shift. that's two bottles and two diaper changes, her bath and her laundry. since i work at home i will take the longest shift from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. i will take her to the park for an hour, but that's it. no shopping, no cooking, no cleaning.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{what if she gets up at night? whose shift is that?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{well... i thought you might do it...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{not a chance! i'm not doing the night shift. i absolutely refuse. i have too much work to catch up on for the competition.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well, needless to say i refuse, too!}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{listen to me, you selfish bastards! my shift is eight hours in a row. no way i'm gonna do nights too. after 6 p.m. she can scream all she wants, i don't give a shit.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{you know, jack, you're a real slime ball! we give you the easiest shift: the morning. she's always in great shape in the morning, isn't she? we've got to work like crazy to save our jobs and you have the nerve to refuse nights. goddamit, she's your daughter. are you that horny?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(extremely pissed off)}
<D>__{hey, horny yourself! i don't give a shit. i don't need you guys. i will find some other way to do it. and i won't take the new york washington shuttle!}

<A>__{although it is dark, we can distinguish in jack's bed a rather bulky shape, which is moving around under the comforter and doesn't exactly seem to be sleeping... suddenly, from the direction of the living room, we can hear mary crying. jack emerges from under the comforter and switches on the light: he has a female guest in his bed, a pretty brunette this time.}

<P>__{(to sylvia)}
<D>__{here, could you give these to michael so he can pack them with the clothes?}
<A>__{he hands two bibs to sylvia. sylvia walks through the apartment, and stops in front of michael's room, where she looks strangely at the changing table with its mattress, its pretty sheet, and the baby's toilet articles. sylvia enters the living room. michael has spread all of mary's clothes, neatly folded and ironed on the couch. he is packing them in a big bag.}

<P>__{(her mind is elsewhere)}
<D>__{yeah, sure...}
<A>__{michael bustles about. sylvia's gaze comes to rest on the crib which stands imposingly in the middle of the living room. music boxes, little booties and stuffed animals are hanging from the bars, and a pretty white tulle frames the crib.}

<A>__{a sudden, weighty silence ensues.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{this fuckig cold! i look like i'b cryig all the tibe but i'b dot it's just this dab cold.}
<A>__{he gets up and goes out.}
<L>__{interior sylvia's studio apartment night}
<A>__{jack, holding a bouquet of flowers and graton's rabbit, rings the doorbell of an apartment. on the door a card reads "sylvia and mary." a chubby young man with thick glasses opens the door.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hi. is sylvia in?}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{no, she'll be back in a couple of hours around midnight, she said...}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{wanna come in and wait for her?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{sure... why not?}
<A>__{he follows the young man in sylvia's studio. it's very messy. on the table there's a big heap of books and papers. mary, sitting on the floor, is wearing a diaper and a sweater, but her legs are bare. she's playing with an empty pack of cigarettes. she looks at jack with a serious, unruffled expression.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{sylvia doing okay?}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{i don't know i'm a med student. i'm just babysitting. i only met her a couple hours ago.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, i see...}
<A>__{silence. the young man sits down at the table and immerses himself in his books. mary doesn't look up from her pack of cigarettes anymore.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{listen, on second thought, i don't think i will wait for her. just give her this when she gets back, okay? and this is for the baby.}
<A>__{jack hands the bouquet and the rabbit to the young man, who plops them down on a chair.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{sure, no problem.}
<A>__{he immerses himself again in his books. jack heads toward the door, then turns around.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{shouldn't the baby be in bed by now?}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{yeah... i don't know... when i put her to bed she cries so i just let her stay up...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{don't you have any tights to put on her legs?}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{tights?... well, it's pretty hot in here anyway...}
<A>__{jack gets out of there in a hurry.}
<L>__{interior living room day}
<A>__{jack, in his pilot's uniform, is sitting on the living room couch. michael is standing before him.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you want me to call them?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{but you've got to let them know!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no, i'm not going anywhere anymore, i've had it with traveling. i quit.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{c'mon, i will call you a cab, you've still got time.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{don't you call anybody.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{but the plane's s'posed to take off in half an hour they won't have time to replace you. this is serious you'll lose your job and you won't be able to pay your share of the apartment anymore... you...}
<A>__{jack takes off his pilot's jacket and throws it aside.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i will be a dishwasher, i will live in a flophouse.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{what the hell happened?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm not going, i told you; i'm not going ever again. i'm sick and tired of traveling, sick and tired of broads. they all have the same asses and i can't seem to love them anyway. i can't take another hotel room, and swimming pools and trendy restaurants! i want to know what my life's all about. do you know what your life's about, michael?}
<A>__{michael has no answer to these questions. he leaves.}
<L>__{interior apartment evening}
<A>__{michael, wearing an apron and holding a wooden spoon, goes into jack's room. the latter, lying on his bed, is smoking and staring at the ceiling.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{come on, i made us a good dinner. i bought some filet mignon and haagen dazs butter pecan. when peter comes back he'll cheer you up...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{he's been here all day.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{he has? i didn't hear him...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{he's in his room.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{michael heads towards peter's room. jack feebly gets up and follows him. michael knocks on the door. no answer.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{peter! dinner's ready!}
<A>__{still no answer. michael opens the door: peter's lying face down on his bed. he's holding the rubber giraffe and sobbing. michael and jack, dismayed, stare at him. peter hides his face in his arm. jack and michael go to the kitchen and sit down to their steaks, totally depressed.}
<L>__{interior apartment morning}
<A>__{the doorbell rings. a bare chested michael, in jeans, drags himself over to the front door and opens it. there stands sylvia with mary in her stroller. sylvia is a disheveled mess.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{is jack here? 'cause i'm a mess. i can't handle it, i'm all alone...}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(shouting towards jack's room)}
<D>__{jack! jack, c'mere for chrissake!}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{'cause my place is tiny, y'know, and my schedule's insane and i just finished four days of posing and we ended up every day at...}
<A>__{jack, bare chested, comes in pulling on his jeans. he stops short at the front door. sylvia is about to cry.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{yeah, y'see, jack, i just did four days of posing...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{and every day we finished at three in the morning and since mary always gets up around 5:30...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{well, you can imagine how much sleep i've gotten...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah, of course, 'cause after the 5:30 bottle it starts all over again around nine...}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{and by the time i change her and play with her a little, it's already eight o'clock...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{and then that's it you get only an hour of sleep.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{and the babysitters till three a.m. all my money is sucked down the tubes!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{plus they don't put the kids to bed, they let them lie around half naked...}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{oh, so the flowers and the rabbit were from you...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i could have strangled that guy...}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{i mean it, i can't cope anymore. my parents and i don't talk to each other and anyway they live in texas, and the baby needs to get out to the park...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{yeah, tell me about it! finding time to take her to the park every day is a real bitch!}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{and i have to work, i need the money to survive and anyway i love my job...}
<A>__{a distraught peter, bare chested and in jeans, comes running in from his room.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{but to work i've gotta have a babysitter, and to have a babysitter i need to work, so i run around all day...}
<P>__{(she sobs)}
<D>__{... and i'm not sure i'm taking good care of her...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{of course you're taking good care of her we know what it's like, don't cry, she looks great...}
<C>__{sylvia}
<P>__{(sobbing)}
<D>__{it's just 'cause i haven't slept in four nights she must be teething or something, i don't know but i can't manage...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{don't worry, it's nothing, she's cutting a tooth you just have to put some stuff on her gums...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{she pulled the same thing on us. we lost all our friends in one night on account of one tooth!}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{and just look at my face! nobody's going to want me to model for them with the way my face looks... and what'll happen to me if they don't want me anymore?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{but you're beautiful at your age all you need is a good night's sleep and you'll look like new.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{right, a good night's sleep but when?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well, why don't you leave the baby with us for a few days, till you recuperate... i mean, if you want.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{we're old pros it's not a big deal for us...}
<C>__{sylvia}
<P>__{(blowing her nose, wiping her eyes)}
<D>__{really? i can leave her with you for a little while?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{of course. leave her with us. come back whenever you want. get some rest.}
<A>__{sylvia, between two sobs, picks up a big bag beside her on the doorstep.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{i brought a couple of things for her, just for a few days...}
<A>__{michael eagerly takes the bag from her. it's followed by a second, and then a third.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(taking mary in his arms)}
<D>__{is she hungry?}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{yeah, it's time for her bottle it's all ready in the bag...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i will go heat up some water right away. would you like a cup of coffee?}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{oh, okay, thanks...}
<A>__{peter, carrying mary towards the kitchen, is followed by jack and michael with the bags. sylvia blows her nose and walks around aimlessly in the hall. in the kitchen the three men bustle about with the bags, the bottle, the saucepan... they've swallowed all their pride and are kissing mary all over, on her neck, her hands, her tummy. they're deliriously happy. michael takes some sheets out of the bag.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i will go make up her bed!}
<A>__{he exits, and, once in the corridor, prances around, leaping and dancing... he gets to the living room and goes over to the crib: suddenly, he recoils and freezes, a fearful expression on his face. then he turns and races back to the kitchen.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(floored)}
<D>__{hey, you guys come and see, come and see!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{come see, i said.}
<A>__{jack and peter nervously follow michael into the living room. they stop short in front of the crib: there is sylvia, curled up in a fetal position, sucking her thumb and sleeping like an angel.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{the poor thing, she's really wiped out.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{she'll need two or three months to recover, at least... maybe more!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{we could set up a room for her here...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{a room for her and a room for mary...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{then we could have four shifts instead of three!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yeah, but i don't think she'll agree. she's got her own life to live.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{yeah, she probably wouldn't want to move here. she'd think we'd jump on her any chance we could...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{but we'd make a rule, she'd just be 'one of the guys!'}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{she'll never want to...}
<C>__{sylvia}
<P>__{(very awake)}
<D>__{so, i will take the ten a.m. to three p.m. shift... and i will take every other night... plus the walk in the park in the afternoon before i go to work... and we split the rent equally... and i will just be 'one of the guys'... deal? peter, michael, and jack}
<P>__{(smiling broadly)}
<D>__{deal.}
<A>__{mary suddenly comes in from the kitchen, walking unstead ily but determinedly. she's dragging graton's rabbit by its ear. she looks at the four of them and laughs her head off.}
<B>__{freeze frame.}
<D>__{end!}
