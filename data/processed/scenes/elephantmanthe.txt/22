<A>__{we see two nurses, their backs to us, walking down the hall. they start to go in a doorway when they stop suddenly, very startled, and curtsey deeply. mothershead comes into the hall, also curtseying madly. she is followed by the elegantly dressed woman, who is followed in turn by two footmen. they walk regally down the hall.}
<T>__{cut to committee room:}
<C>__{broadneck}
<D>__{...no, my mind is made up on this, and i am resolved to stand firm. you shall not sway me. may we now vote, mr. chairman, at long last?}
<A>__{carr gomm checks his watch. the door to the room begins to open. he smiles.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{yes, i believe that time has come.}
<A>__{the two footmen enter the room.}
<D>__{1st footman gentlemen, her royal highness alexandra, princess of wales.}
<A>__{the elegantly dressed woman enters. everyone rises.}
<C>__{alix}
<D>__{good morning, gentlemen. i hope i am not interrupting?}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{indeed not, your highness. your presence is always greatly appreciated. we were just about to put the matter of mr. merrick to a vote.}
<P>__{(he turns to the other committee members)}
<D>__{the princess is very interested in mr. merrick's fate.}
<C>__{alix}
<D>__{indeed i am sir, as is the queen. i have a brief communication from her highness which she has requested i read to you: to the governing committee, london hospital. i would very much like to commend you for the charitable face you have shown mr. john merrick, the elephant man. it is laudable that you have provided one of england's most unfortunate sons with a safe and tranquil harbour, a home. for this immeasurable kindness, as well as the many other acts of mercy on behalf of the poor, of which mr. carr gomm has kept me informed, i gratefully thank you. signed victoria, empress of india, queen of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland.}
<P>__{(looking straight at broadneck)}
<D>__{i am sure you gentlemen may be counted on to do the christian thing.}
<A>__{alix seats herself.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{thank you very much, your highness, you may be sure we shall.}
<A>__{broadneck seems very unnerved.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{well then, i move that mr. john merrick be admitted to the london hospital on a permanent basis, on condition that the hospital shall receive a yearly payment equal to the cost of occupying one bed, and that the funds for his care shall be clearly separate from hospital funds. all those in favor.}
<A>__{carr gomm raises his hand. the other members, puzzled, look at broadneck. quite red in the face, broadneck looks at carr gomm, then to treves, then to the princess. he seems to almost deflate, then slowly raises his hand. the other members, now thoroughly confused, raise their hands as well. carr gomm bangs his gavel, smiling broadly. treves is almost beside himself with happiness, and the princess is obviously very pleased.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{the motion is carried.}
<A>__{broadneck, humiliated, cannot look at anyone.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{well, now we may go about our normal business.}
<A>__{merrick's room merrick is working on his cathedral. it is almost finished. he is detailing the spire, carefully painting in the stonework. there is a knock at the door.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{please, come in.}
<A>__{treves enters carrying a wrapped parcel, followed by carr gomm, and mothershead.}
<C>__{treves}
<P>__{(smiling broadly)}
<D>__{good afternoon, john, mr. carr gomm has something he would like to say to you.}
<A>__{treves defers to carr gomm.}
<C>__{carr}
<D>__{mr. merrick, it is my great pleasure to welcome you, officially to the london hospital. the governing committee this morning voted unanimously to provide you these rooms on a permanent basis. this is your home now. i'm so very, very pleased for you.}
<A>__{merrick is speechless. he just looks from treves to carr gomm to mothershead.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{so you see, john, there's no need for a lighthouse. all your friends are here.}
<C>__{mothershead}
<D>__{welcome home, john.}

<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{you did this for me?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{please... please thank the governing committee for me. i will do my utmost to merit their kindness.}
<A>__{merrick looks about him at his rooms. it's beginning to dawn on him that this is indeed his, that at last he has a real home, a place of his own.}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(trying the words on for size)}
<D>__{my home.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{there is one more thing, john. here.}
<A>__{treves hands merrick the package. merrick carefully pulls off the wrapping paper. treves smiles. it's the dressing bag. merrick is overjoyed with the gift. he lovingly handles the articles, taking them in and out of their compartments opening and closing the bag.}

<D>__{is it the one you wanted?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{oh, mr. treves. mr. treves.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{are you sure? because i can take it back.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{mr. treves. thank you my... friends.}
<B>__{night time sky}
<A>__{clouds billowing, moving swiftly. merrick's room merrick is alone, wearing his cloak and standing by the table, cradling the dressing bag. he takes each article out of the bag and lays it carefully on the table, all in very neat order. he stares at the elegant objects, then rearranges them. merrick picks up the toothbrush, examining it with a sort of reverence. he does the same with the ivory handled razors and the comb. the peacock whitechapel there's a good crowd in tonight; lots of drinking and shouting and glasses breaking. several of the neighborhood "working girls" are having a bit of a rest, looking for a laugh. the night porter is rounding up customers, his pockets ringing with coins. people have their hands raised urging the night porter to take them along to see the elephant man. the night porter goes to a table where a man sits with two of the girls.}

<D>__{here now, these lovely ladies ain't never seen it!}

<D>__{hang on, hang on, there's always tomorrow night. not to worry.}
<A>__{bytes, sitting at his usual place at the bar, sees that tonight is his chance. the night porter rounds up his "customers", all twelve of them. bytes saunters over to the night porter.}

<C>__{night porter}
<D>__{at the right price...}

<D>__{there's room.}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{well, let's be off then.}
<A>__{the whole group happily leaves the pub, several still holding their gin bottles. the ladies are rather unsteady on their feet. as they all leave, the night porter says:}
<C>__{night porter}
<D>__{quietly now! quietly! we don't want to scare him.}
<P>__{(he laughs)}
<A>__{merrick's room (merrick as before) he reaches over to the picture of mrs. kendal and picks it up. we see his face reflected in the glass. merrick sets the picture down on the table. he takes up one of the silver brushes and, using the picture as a mirror, neatly brushes his hair over his monstrous skull. he lays the brush down in its specific spot. merrick takes his ring and puts it on his left hand. he opens the cigarette case and stuffs one into his right hand. he takes up his walking stick, breathes deeply, then walks around the room in a slow circle. merrick is transforming himself. merrick comes back to the table and examines his reflection in the picture. with the ring, the stick, the cigarette and his neatly brushed hair, merrick is the very image of a dashing young man about town. he inclines his head to the picture.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{hello, my name is john merrick. i am very, very pleased to meet you!}
<A>__{at this moment the door bursts open. the night porter stands grinning.}
<C>__{night porter}
<D>__{curtain time!!!}
<A>__{merrick is frozen, caught. seeing merrick in his outfit, the night porter's jaw drops. they both stare at each other. the night porter begins to laugh hysterically. merrick frantically begins to put away his dressing bag articles. when merrick starts taking off his ring, the night porter comes over to him and grabs him by the cloak.}
<C>__{night porter}
<D>__{no, no! you look lovely. don't change a thing, darling. you look like the bleedin' prince of wales.}

<D>__{my friends... the elephant man!}

<P>__{man (w the whores) (laughing and clapping)}
<D>__{horrible... i told you it was horrible... just horrible.}
<A>__{he starts kissing each whore. the crowd is mesmerized. bytes moves in behind the man with the whores.}
<C>__{bytes}
<P>__{(to man)}
<D>__{perhaps the ladies would like a closer look?}
<A>__{the man begins to laugh. the whores laugh drunkenly and halfheartedly resist being taken in to see the elephant man. as they are pushed through the door,}
<C>__{whores}
<D>__{come on jack... no... no, don't.}
<P>__{(laughter)}
<D>__{etc.}
<A>__{the whores reluctantly enter the room. the night porter laughs at their discomfort. the man notices all of merrick's pictures of women.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{'cor, he's a real ladies' man, come on... give the ladies' man a kiss.}
<A>__{he lets one of the whores go and grabs the other one from behind at the wrists.}

<D>__{come on, jack.}
<A>__{the night porter has turned merrick and is holding him for the approaching kiss. the crowd is egging them on. the man forces the woman closer and closer and raises her arms to force her into an embrace. as merrick and the woman touch, being pressed together, the woman begins to scream. the night porter, the man and the crowd all laugh with glee. merrick and the whore now have their faces pressed together. the whore is screaming and merrick is crying out and screaming too.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{here that's enough romance. now into bed.}
<A>__{merrick and the whore are pushed onto merrick's bed. the night porter grabs the other whore now. she begins screaming wildly.}
<C>__{night porter}
<D>__{a prince needs a harem!}
<A>__{he pushes the screaming whore down onto merrick. her screaming face goes right into his. merrick tries to move away and as he does his head goes too far back and his cried turn to horrible wheezing.}
<C>__{night porter}
<D>__{mind his head... you'll kill him.}
<A>__{the crowd outside is trying to see in the window. five or six more have gone into merrick's room to see. all are laughing and screaming and trying to get a close look at the elephant man.}
<C>__{night porter}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{quiet down. quiet down. you'll have the whole place down on us.}
<C>__{bytes}
<P>__{(outside, yelling loudly)}
<D>__{bring him out then, so's we all can see him.}
<A>__{merrick recognizes his voice and looks frantically around for his former owner. the night porter pulls merrick up by the window again. he then begins pushing the crowd out the door.}
<C>__{night porter}
<D>__{everyone outside!!!}
<A>__{suddenly one of the crowd outside reaches up and grabs merrick's good hand and pulls him half out the window. others follow suit and haul him all the way through. the cathedral falls to the floor, breaking into several pieces. because of the horror of touching him, the crowd outside lets merrick fall to the ground. the night porter whirls around and sees that merrick is gone. he pushes the rest of the people outside and quickly goes to merrick, lifting him to his feet. unseen by anyone, bytes slips into merrick's room. merrick is now standing. the crowd moves in. the night porter is enjoying the festivities, but looks around nervously for trouble.}
<C>__{one man}
<D>__{give 'im a drink.}
<A>__{the man grabs merrick and pours some gin into his mouth, then pushes him away. he's caught by another man, fed liquor and pushed away. he's pushed now from person to person faster and faster. finally merrick falls to the ground, dizzy and a bottle of gin on merrick's head. he coughs and moans through the wheezing. the crowd is now strangely silent circling the elephant man like a pack of dogs closing in on a terrified rabbit. suddenly merrick starts to wail. the crowd joins in and they hoist him above their heads, screaming with laughter, around and around, joining him all the while. now we see a window reflecting the scene of terror. a curtain is pulled aside and we see through the reflection the face of the young porter, watching everything.}
<C>__{night porter }
<D>__{here now... here now... he's had enough... show's over!}
<A>__{merrick is lowered down into the crowd. it parts and the night porter emerges walking merrick toward us to his room.}

<P>__{(to the crowd behind him)}
<D>__{meet you at the peacock.}
<C>__{one of the crowd}
<D>__{bring your friend.}
<C>__{night porter}
<P>__{(laughs drunkenly)}
<D>__{he's had 'is fill for one night.}
<A>__{the crowd moves through the iron gate of bedstead square. in the background we see bytes' boy sitting on top of a wagon. the night porter takes merrick into his room and puts him on the bed. he drunkenly stumbles about trying to out the room in order. he places the smashed hulk of the cathedral back up on its table, inadvertently leaving the spire and a few columns on the floor. he picks the cloak up and replaces it on the peg.}
<C>__{night porter}
<P>__{(to merrick)}
<D>__{i did real well tonight.}
<A>__{he takes a purse full of coins out of his pocket. he removes one small coin and flips it on the floor in front of merrick.}
<C>__{night porter}
<D>__{here... buy yourself a sweet.}
<A>__{the night porter turns and leaves. merrick, alone now, hears the night porter's echoing footsteps and the distant sound of the gate being closed. there is a long silence as merrick collects himself. he then leans back into his pillows with a deep sigh. his eyes close.}
<C>__{bytes }
<D>__{my treasure...}
<A>__{merrick's eyes flash open. we see bytes coming toward him.}
<C>__{bytes}
<D>__{aren't you glad to see me?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{bytes!}
<A>__{bytes lifts merrick up off the bed. he reaches out for merrick's cloak. we slowly pan over all the smiling women's faces as we hear the following:}
<C>__{bytes }
<D>__{get into your cloak...}
<P>__{(rustling sound)}
<D>__{...now, your hood... do it!}
<C>__{merrick }
<D>__{...alright.}
<A>__{rustling sound. we now glide slowly on to merrick's mother's picture.}
<C>__{bytes }
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{merrick's good hand comes into the frame trying to reach his mother's picture. he grabs at the table cloth and pulls. now we see bytes gripping merrick's arm and pulling. we see the picture fall to the ground with a thud.}
