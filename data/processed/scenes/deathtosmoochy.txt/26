<L>__{interior patsy's short while later}
<A>__{sheldon and burke now sit at a corner table.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{look, shel, frank strokes ain't in the business to make you rich. he's in it to make frank stokes rich. that's how these network goons operate.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{that's so sad. is it just me, or is that sad?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{you know, years ago, a client of mine, dicky gimble, was having a problem...}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{wow, you represented dicky gimble?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{yeah, before the asshole found religion. anyway, stokes was trying to screw my boy out of some merchandising points. claimed he had a warehouse full of dicky dolls that weren't moving. now frank and i are old friends, so i say to him, 'okay, cock, show me the warehouse' see, i know the fucking warehouse is in the bronx, and i know it's emptier than my wife's head.}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{to make a long story short, i walk out with a check for a hundred grand and stokes is sitting there with his thumb up his ass.}
<A>__{burke laughs.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{that's very amusing, but i don't care about smoochy dolls and smoochy floor wax... i just want more creative input. this rhino came from my womb. i bore him, i nursed him, and dammit...}
<A>__{he pounds his fist on the table.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{i should be the one who raises him!}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{shel, it's all about the dough. after you get the money, you get the power. and after you get the power, you can have smoochy walk on stage with a hard on if you want.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{it's funny, that never crossed my mind.}
<A>__{burke downs the rest of his drink and stands up.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{unfortunately, until then... you're just another puppet in the prop room.}
<A>__{he hands sheldon his card.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{give me a call when you're ready, kid. i will cut the strings and open the magic door for you.}
