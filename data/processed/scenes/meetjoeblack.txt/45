<L>__{interior salon, parrish townhouse, new york city night}
<A>__{the skyline glitters through the terrace windows. the hour is before dinner, coyle and luisa weave seamlessly among the family, offering hors d'oeuvres and drinks on a tray. allison and susan together by a piano; parrish, quince and a distracted joe are gathered near the terrace. joe's eyes are on susan across the room. her eyes flicker towards him, aware of his gaze.}
<C>__{allison}
<P>__{(to susan)}
<D>__{...we're never all together two nights in a row. maybe christmas, thanksgiving, that's it. what's going on?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{nothing's going on. maybe he doesn't want to be alone. he's go ing to be sixty five in a minute }
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{...i don't know, daddy seems funny to me. ever since joe showed. it's like he dropped from the clouds...}
<A>__{drew enters. he nuzzles susan's neck, out of the corner of her eye she sees joe still observing them.}
<C>__{allison }
<D>__{...when daddy walked in with him, he couldn't even remember his name. now he's his house guest. and you know how he hates house guests. what is going on?}
<A>__{drew, whose eyes have also been on joe across the room, turns back.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(to susan and allison)}
<D>__{good question.}
<A>__{allison sees susan's eyes flicker over towards joe.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{ but he does seem very nice.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you think so?}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{over at the terrace, quince buttonholes parrish, joe stand ing by.}
<C>__{quince}
<P>__{(to parrish)}
<D>__{...i read you all the way on the bontecou thing, and i know where you're coming from. and i'm with you a hundred and one percent.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{thank you, quince.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{but i've got to tell you, if mergers are in the wild, i've got some great prospects i've developed. i want to talk to you about them next week.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{next week?}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{yeah. or the week after.}
<A>__{quince sees parrish hesitate.}
<C>__{quince }
<D>__{no good?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{no, anything is possible.}
<P>__{(lightly)}
<D>__{it's up to joe.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{joe, you don't know how glad i am you're aboard. anybody who can take some of the weight off the old man, i'm in his corner.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{that's very gracious of you, quince.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{no problem. i will leave you two alone. i can tell you guys have something on the fire }
<A>__{an excited quince drains his drink and heads for drew as allison appears.}
<C>__{allison}
<P>__{(to parrish)}
<D>__{did you know twenty six members of your rifle company are coming?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{from the korean war.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{conflict, honey. korean conflict.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{whatever it was, they'll be here. we sent out invitations to everyone, plane tickets included the rsvp's are amazing. a few of them we didn't hear from, and some of them are dead, of course }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{allison}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{you know, we're going to give this party for you whether you like it or not.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i like it. i like it. i'm sorry i don't seem more appreciative.}
<C>__{allison}
<P>__{(resignedly)}
<D>__{that's okay, daddy.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{across the room, quince has pulled drew aside:}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{...i know you're down, but you know when you're down, drew, there's no place to go but up.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{thanks, quince.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{never mind bontecou. i've got some other merger possibilities up my sleeve, and i'm putting them to see old man.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{are you?}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{we'll do it together. i will clue you in. timing's got to be right. the old man says it's up to joe.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{'it's up to joe'? those were his words?}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{'it's up to joe', huh?}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{yeah, that's what he said.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{well, that's very interesting.}
<A>__{drew gazes intently over at joe who is crossing to susan, for the moment by herself near the piano.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{i thought so, too. joe's a neat guy.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{yeah. neat.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{joe approaches susan.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i wanted to apologize, susan }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i thought you said 'be sorry for nothing'.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well, now i am sorry. for intruding on you this afternoon.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{it wasn't an intrusion. and if it was, it turned out to be welcome.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i appreciate you }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i mean i appreciate that.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{and i appreciate you, too.}
<A>__{a moment between them.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(delighted)}
<D>__{you do? well, thank you very much.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{drew crosses over to parrish.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i was a little abrupt with you this afternoon, drew. forgive me. i want you to know i value your advice.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{as much as joe's?}
<A>__{parrish doesn't answer.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{who is this man? he's giving ubiquitous a bad name.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{you're competitive soul, drew. that's what makes you a great addi tion to the money. joe is just... around.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{for how long? and why?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{please. don't worry about him. and above all, don't antagonize him.}
<A>__{drew glances over at joe.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{boss's orders, huh? i'm great at following them. and i think i will start right now.}
<A>__{allison calls out from the other side of the room:}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{dinner's ready, everybody!}
<A>__{a buzz as coyle opens the doors to the dining room and the family files in, drew lingering behind with joe.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i have a confession to make to you, joe.}
<A>__{joe just smiles in response.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{do you want to hear it?}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(pleasantly)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{well, i'm going to tell you anyway. i did cheat on that exam at groton. but so did twenty six other guys, and nobody ever mentioned it until today. and i'm expecting you won't mention it again. i don't know who you are and where you're getting your information, but i'm willing to pretend i did not hear it, and let bygones be bygones. but can i tell you something else, it'd be nice to see the big guy without you next to him. what are you, his shadow? do you hold his dick for him when he goes to take a leak? you know some times somebody would like a few min utes alone with w.p. that means without you. okay, pal? let's eat.}
