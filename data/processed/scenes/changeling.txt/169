<A>__{as thorpe looks to the other members of the council, and the area where witnesses are supposed to wait to be called upon. a number of seats are empty.}

<D>__{mr. thorpe, i don't see any other members of the police commission.}
<C>__{thorpe}
<D>__{that's odd...we specifically stipulated that we would begin our hearings with testimony from the police department. are there any representatives of the police commission in the room?}

<P>__{(no reply)}
<D>__{is captain jones here? is there anyone here representing the police?}
