<A>__{this is the office of the home improvement commission. desks, chairs and filing cabinets are all over the place (not yet organized) and boxes and cartons are stacked against a wall. angle on john masters walking with a file under his arm. he walks across the half empty warehouse where workers are renovating the space. he approaches a table where stanley is seated with his feet up, nursing a hot cup of coffee. masters throws a file down on the table.}

<D>__{this is good, stan... nice work.}
<A>__{stanley nods.}
<C>__{masters}
<D>__{fossey says it should go down very well with the city council. could help us appropriate more funds. this goes a long way to establish our credibility in what we're trying to do.}

<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{there's a lot more where this came from.}
<C>__{masters}
<D>__{you know what i think you should do now. why don't you pull some files... some files that were completed, others that went unsold, and i will have somebody run it down, talk to the customers and get some statements.}
<C>__{stanley}
<D>__{pulling files is another thing. that might not be easy.}
