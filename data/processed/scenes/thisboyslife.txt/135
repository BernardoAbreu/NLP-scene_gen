<A>__{toby opens a metal trash can, dumps the trash, puts the lid back on, and then hesitates. he lifts the lid again and peers into the trash can, almost hidden, are the tips of four white envelopes made of heavy, expensive paper. he pulls them up and, though covered with tomato seeds, are undamaged.}

<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{you've always got your nose pressed up against the bake shop window, don't you, dwight?}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{you feel like everybody else is inside, and you're stuck on the outside. it turns you mean. it turns you ugly. and one day do you hear me, dwight? one day all that ugliness is going to snap back and hit you in the face.}
<C>__{dwight}
<D>__{ooooooh, oh, i'm so scared. oooh.}
