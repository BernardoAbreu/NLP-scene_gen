<L>__{interior natchez jail night}
<A>__{in a holding cell, ray tests the window bars. solid. meanwhile, claude sits on a cot brooding darkly. through the bars, we see the rednecks laughing and passing around a bottle of bootleg rum with the deputy on duty.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{man, this is gonna delay everything. spanky's gonna be pissed.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{spanky's gonna be pissed? poor spanky. fuck spanky! what the hell kind of a name is spanky, anyway? you're responsible for this situation. i blame you for everything. if it wasn't for you, i'd be home having a hot meal right now.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{if it wasn't for me, you'd be washing up on the beach at coney island right now.}
<P>__{(mocking claude)}
<D>__{"i need all my thumbs and fingers for praying and doing good."}
<A>__{the jailhouse door opens and sheriff pike walks in. he pauses to give the prisoners the once over. there's a fresh bandage over the cut on his cheek.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{what do we have here?}
<C>__{deputy}
<D>__{billy bob and the boys found them down down under the hill with winston hancock. he was dead. looks like murder.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{you don't say.}
<C>__{deputy}
<D>__{looks like they was running rum. got thirty six cases of evidence out back. you want i should call in the federal prosecutor?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{let's not drag the feds into this. i can think of better uses for that rum than letting it collect dust in some government warehouse up in nashville.}
<A>__{pike winks at his deputy, then turns to regard the prisoners.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{besides, why bother with bootlegging when we got us a clear cut case of murder?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{excuse me, sheriff. as we explained to your associate here, there's been a mistake. we didn't kill anybody. now, as for the bootlegging, we happen to work for a very important man in new york.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{that's right. does the name spanky johnson mean anything to you?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{afraid not.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{mr. johnson is very well connected. if you were to let us go, i guarantee he would show you his appreciation, if you know what i mean.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{are you offering me a bribe?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i'm just trying to pay the toll on the road to justice.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{you may be able to buy your way out of trouble up in new york city, but down here we take murder seriously.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{look, man, how many times we gotta tell you people, we didn't kill that guy!}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{well, if that's the case, then you don't have anything to worry about, do you?}
<A>__{pike turns his back on the prisoners and checks the time on a gold pocket watch ray's pocket watch. but from his cell, ray can't hear the mechanical tune.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{time to get home to the missus. see y'all in the morning.}
<A>__{in the cell, claude turns to ray.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{the man's gotta pointerior we're innocent, after all. i just gotta get a good night's sleep on this filthy mattress. keep our heads on straight, stay cool, what's the worst thing that could happen to us?}
