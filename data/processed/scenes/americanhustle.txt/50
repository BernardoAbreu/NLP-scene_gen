<D>__{an arab sheik? why do we need an arab sheik?}
<L>__{interior art museum day}
<A>__{richie, in sharp lapeled suit, chain on his neck, walks with irv and edith and joined by a man who looks like an arab sheik who they trail.}
<C>__{irving rosenfeld}
<D>__{how do you think this works, stupid?}
<C>__{sydney prosser}
<D>__{if you could not call him stupid which he's isn't, he's smarter than you. last i checked he's in control here and we work for him now so be nice.}
<A>__{richie stares at edith elated that she just stuck up for him. he's really enjoying this position of power she's putting him in.}
<C>__{irving rosenfeld}
<P>__{(stares at her, upset)}
<D>__{ok, to set this up and bust a con artist we have to make the honey pot to attract the bees. in order to attract the bees, we need to offer them a wealthy individual who can be taken advantage of, someone special, someone new, someone amazing. then those guys will want to sell fake bank cds to that guy, take the sheik's money, see?}
<A>__{richie looks at irving uncertain.}
<C>__{sydney prosser}
<D>__{only they can't get into his money unless you they know someone, and that someone is us.}
<C>__{richie dimaso}
<D>__{oh that's good.}

<A>__{richie starts to look around.}
<C>__{richie dimaso}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{irving rosenfeld}
<D>__{don't look.}
<A>__{richie looks anyway and sees elway's acquaintance, a man balding, 45 clocking them from the balcony.}
<C>__{irving rosenfeld }
<D>__{you have a good look?}
