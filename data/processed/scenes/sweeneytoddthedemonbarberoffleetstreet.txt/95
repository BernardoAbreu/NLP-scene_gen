<A>__{she stops when he realizes he isn't even listening to her. her heart sinks seeing him at the window, wearing his obsession like a cloak. a beat as she looks at him.}

<D>__{mr. t., might i ask you a question?}
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(not turning)}

<D>__{you heard me ... (a beat) ... can't really remember can you?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{she had yellow hair.}
<A>__{he turns back to the window. mrs. lovett proceeds with great sincerity:}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{you've got to leave all this behind you now. she's gone ... you keep looking down into the grave, you're never gonna look up. and life will just pass right by ... life is for the alive, my dear.}

<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{we could have a life we two ... maybe not like i dreamed, maybe not like you remember ... but we could get by.}
<A>__{he does not answer.}
<C>__{mrs. lovett}
<D>__{come away from the window.}
<A>__{a long beat. he finally turns from the window. almost as if to leave his demons behind... she smiles quietly and holds out her hand... she begins to cross to him... suddenly revealing the gentleman! standing right behind mrs. lovett he is glaring at todd, relentless and accusatory blood pouring from his throat a shocking horror movie vision then the bell rings outside the shop ... todd turns ... the gentleman is gone ... we hear footsteps climbing the stairs... mrs. lovett remains standing, her hand out to him, as anthony enters, absolutely exhausted.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{mr. todd ... mrs. lovett, ma'am ...}
<P>__{(sinks into a chair) ... seems i've}
<D>__{not slept in a week but it's done }

<P>__{(bitter)}
<D>__{he has her locked in a madhouse.}
<A>__{todd's head snaps to anthony, riveted:}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{you've found johanna?}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{for all the good it'll do it's impossible to get to her.}
<A>__{todd begins pacing, the tiger again, his mind is racing }
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{a madhouse ... a madhouse ... where?}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{fogg's asylum. but i've circled the place a dozen times. there's no way in. it's a fortress.}
<A>__{anthony fades to a brooding silence as todd continues pacing, thinking, thinking. mrs. lovett watches him, concerned. todd suddenly stops... we see him settling into an inspired sort of calm, as if he can finally see the promised land.}
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{i've got him.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{mr. todd?}
<C>__{todd}

<D>__{mr. todd how can i ever ?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{go!}
<A>__{anthony hurries out. todd immediately hurls himself into a chair and begins writing a letter, his violent scrawl slashing across the page.}
