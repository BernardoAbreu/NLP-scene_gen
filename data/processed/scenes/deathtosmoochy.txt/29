<L>__{interior kidnet studio stage b day}
<A>__{it's thirty minutes before a smoochy taping. dozens of giddy children are led into the studio where they take seats on the bleachers.}
<B>__{backstage}
<A>__{sheldon, in the smoochy costume, sans head, lumbers up to nora. he holds a rundown for that day's show.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{excuse me, nora. why was the 'please and thank you song' cut?}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{because it's sappy and it takes away from the 'cookie song.'}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{takes away? it enhances it! the cookie song is a meaningless piece of fluff without the 'please and thank you' coda! that's the moral anchor! that's where the lesson is! you can't sell the sizzle without the steak!}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{it's cut. and i want the 'cookie song' lyrics changed back to the way they were originally scripted.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{i can't do that. i will not condone children consuming endless amounts of refined sugar. i have to look myself in the mirror every morning.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{this is network television, not a sprout farm. we're here to sell sugar and plastic. that's what keeps the lights on.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{you're treating me like a puppet. you know that? well, guess what? i am not your puppet.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{since when? now get your spongy orange ass out there and dance for the cameras.}
<A>__{an angry sheldon storms off in frustration, but then stops. he looks back at her.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{we have different eyes, nora. when i go out there i see kids. you see wallets with pigtails.}
<A>__{he moves on. nora stares at him as he walks away. he obviously got to her. as sheldon heads toward the studio, he doesn't notice the two beady eyes staring at him from under the stairwell. after a beat, randolph emerges and slinks backstage. he's clutching a duffle bag.}
