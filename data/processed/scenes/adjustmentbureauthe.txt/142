<D>__{forget it! he's already there...}
<A>__{richardson charges into the lobby to see david staring through the partially open door to the rehearsal room...}
<C>__{richardson}
<D>__{dammit!}
<A>__{mccrady's phone buzzes. he pulls it out and looks at the caller id.}
<C>__{mccrady}
<P>__{(dread)}
<D>__{it's mr. donaldson.}
<A>__{richardson pulls the fedora off his head and crushes it in his hands. david turns just in time to see this. at the same time david realizes the door is no longer "stuck."}
<C>__{richardson}
<D>__{celebrate while you can. they'll just kick it upstairs now you have no idea what you're up against.}
<A>__{david just looks at him. he'll deal with that when it comes...}
<C>__{mccrady}
<D>__{sir?}
<A>__{richardson grabs the phone and answers going outside to talk. david turns back to the dance studio. he opens the door to get an unobstructed view of elise. she spins, arches, dips. david can't take his eyes off her. when the artistic director pauses the routine to give notes, elise gives david a little wave. then they start again. david looks back out at richardson on the street, but he's gone..}
