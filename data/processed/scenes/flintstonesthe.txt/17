<A>__{clouds of dust rise from behind the fence. we see the heads of the heavy equipment dinos rising and falling. a two story office building is at one end of the site with a big "slate construction inc." sign on the roof. camera adjusts as fred's car turns into the lot, barney seated beside fred. the new green hood gleams in the morning light. closer fred's car fred digs his feet into the ground, slams to a halt. he gets out, surveys the activity. immediately, the various workers shout ad lib greetings. fred acknowledges these, beaming in the respect he gets here. he lovingly dusts off his construction helmet, puts it on, knocks an offending speck from his parking sign (f. flintstone shop steward). he leads barney towards the quarry area.}
