<A>__{several campfires burn near the edge of the city where dozens have taken temporary refuge. claire arrives to see: a body on a stretcher being carried up outside stairs to a rooftop from which glow several bare bulbs. she goes up the stairs to the rooftop.}

<L>__{exterior a rooftop hospital night}
<A>__{a makeshift mobile hospital under awnings and palm fronds, capable of moving location in minutes. a woman doctor and two temporary orderlies tend to wounded. a small black and white television sits on a table and those who are able watch the seige of managua on television while it goes on around them. claire looks for price among the dead or wounded. p.o.v. the city under attack claire watches for several moments smoke, flame, the buzzing sound of planes swooping low, fleeing crowds. she then notices the television. price's footage of alex's death comes on the tv screen, and she pushes closer to see the grim sequence. the news commentator explains in spanish what we see claire is so disturbed at the images that she turns away, sickened, hurt, guilty, outraged, but unable to break down. she closes her eyes her face is covered with tears. the doctor notices this and speaks softly to her.}

<P>__{(claire nods)}
<D>__{you knew the man who was killed?}
<P>__{(she nods again)}
<D>__{fifty thousand nicaraguans have died... and now one yankee.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{perhaps now americans will be outraged at what is happening here, eh?}
<A>__{it takes a while for claire to respond.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{yes... perhaps they will.}
<A>__{noise in the distance from mortars. the doctor speaks calmly, without bitterness in the voice, but with total conviction.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{maybe we should have killed an american journalist fifty years ago.}
<A>__{claire acknowledges the grim truth of the observation with a slight nod, and walks to the railing as: alex's death is repeated in freeze frame sequence over and over again as the orderlies, doctor, and patients gather to watch with fascination. claire stares out at the city on fire, when her eye catches something a light in the sky. she watches: p.o.v. a helicopter with searchlight passes overhead, momentarily illuminating the hospital, but it continues on, curiously uninterested in the guerrilla activity. the chopper sweeps above a nearby hill and hovers, then slowly lowers to earth. claire watches with interest then descends the stairs.}
