<L>__{interior dalton's bedroom day}
<A>__{renai pushes the door open. dalton lies in the center of the room on his gurney. the only sound is his breathing. renai surveys the room. it is empty. bump...bump...bump... she steps inside, glancing over at a cabinet. in the foot high space beneath it, a small white shoe protrudes slightly. a child's shoe. heart pounding, renai bends down, peering into the darkness under the cabinet. bump...bump...bump... the shoe does not have a foot in it. it is simply a discarded shoe. there is no one under the cabinet. bang!!!}

<A>__{the cabinet doors explode open as the child bursts out, giggling. only we see that it is not a child. it is a dwarf. a man in child's clothing. the dwarf runs past renai as she leaps back. he runs out of the room, giggling. all is quiet again. bump...bump...bump... renai gets up, unsure of what to do. numb with terror. suddenly the record pitches back to life, the volume startling. renai jolts, falling backwards.}
