<D>__{let me tell you a story, son so this was 1924, right? hearst was throwing a birthday party for thomas ince, the old movie producer. they were all on the old man's yacht taking a nice jaunt from pedro down to san diego. real foggy night it was. this was hearst, marion, ince, charlie chaplin, louella, the usual gorillas. so hearst notices marion slip off with chaplin she was screwing everyone then and the old man goes nuts. grabs his revolver and starts shooting. just like tom mix, standing there blasting away through the fog. boom boom boom and thomas ince takes a bullet through the head. so now there's this dead guy lying on the deck. you'll see how this could be quite an embarrassment. so the empire goes into action. nice and quiet and ince was cremated lickety split. no inquest and no police. it was right after this that hearst gives louella her life time contract. just to keep her all hush hush.}
