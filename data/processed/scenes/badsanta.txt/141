<L>__{interior chamberlan's toy dept. night}
<A>__{we are looking at a big, fuzzy, smiling, pink stuffed elephant. willie's hand hesitates between this elephant and the one behind, which is purple. we hear him muttering:}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{shit... which did he say?}
<A>__{the hand finally leaves with the purple elephant. we hold for a long beat. the hand reenters to put back the purple and take the pink. willie turns around holding the stuffed elephant. marcus and lois are standing there presenting a grotesque picture: lois has a shopping cart filled with shoes, scarves, jewels, a salad spinner, purses, a block of ginsu knives, an abdomen exerciser. she wears a pair of sunglasses from which a price tag dangles, and a long ermine stole. next to her marcus holds the santa bag bulging with indeed, sprouting cash.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{well, i don't think that store dick is gonna want this.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{store dick don't want shit.}
<A>__{something in this picture makes willie uneasy. he licks his lips.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{wuddya mean, fucking guy's greedier than...}
<A>__{he pauses, searching.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{...greedier than fuck.}
<A>__{marcus and lois are statues, staring at him.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{store dick dead. store dick don't want shit.}
<A>__{a long silence.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{...fuck the fuckin' store dick.}
<A>__{willie's tone is wooden:}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{dead, huh...}
<A>__{again, he licks his lips.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{...i didn't even know he was sick.}
<A>__{marcus flicks his coat front away and pulls a .45 out of his waistband.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{willie. this has been a long time comin'.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{every year you're worse. every year, less reliable. more booze. more bullshit. more butt fucking.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{sure. the three b'a.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{you gotta be able to rely, willie.}
<A>__{he primes the gun. willie murmurs, more in sadness than in fear:}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{you're monsters.}
<A>__{marcus points the gun.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{believe me, willie: there's no joy in this for me.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{oh, i don't mean layin' me out. i understand that. but just look at ya. all the shit... grabbin' all this shit do you really need all this junk? ...this is christmas?}
<A>__{marcus sneers:}

<A>__{a silence.}
<C>__{lois}
<D>__{...wuddya waitin' for, honey? plug him.}
<A>__{marcus sighs.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{good bye, willie.}
<A>__{he aims. willie squeezes his eyes shut. from nowhere:}
<C>__{megaphone voice }
<D>__{drop the gun, munchkin!}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{huh? !}
<A>__{clack clack clack clack clack the sound of many guns priming. police everywhere.}
<C>__{megaphone voice}
<D>__{and you, santa! drop the elephant!}
<A>__{willie stares. marcus looks wildly around.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{...where did you come from?}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{tipped off.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{shit!}
<B>__{camera tracks in on his face}
<A>__{willie slaps his forehead.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{...fuckin' kid!}
<C>__{chief}
<D>__{all three of you are in so much shit it's almost unbelievable.}
<C>__{lois}
<D>__{gevalt.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{oh yeah? well come'n get us, coppers! ha ha ha ha!}
<A>__{bang! bang! bang! his .45 roars. the cops return fire.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{fuck me...}
<A>__{he ducks, clutching the elephant to his chest, and scurries behind a counter.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{...fuck me fuck me fuck me...}
<A>__{gunfire fills the air. exploding merchandise chases along the counter behind willie as the cops seek to put him down. under the gunfire we hear marcus's maniacal laughter. willie reaches the end of the counter. a brief open space separates him from a stairwell; he dashes across as gunfire redoubles and plunges down the stairs.}
