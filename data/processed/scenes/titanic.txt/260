<A>__{jack and rose cross the foyer, entering the corridor. lovejoy is waiting for them in the hall as they approach the room.}
<C>__{lovejoy}
<A>__{we've been looking for you miss. lovejoy follows and, unseen, moves close behind jack and smoothly slips the diamond necklace into the pocket of his overcoat.}

<A>__{cal and ruth wait in the sitting room, along with the master at arms and two stewards (steward #1 and barnes). silence as rose and jack enter. ruth closes her robe at her throat when she sees jack.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{something serious has happened.}
<C>__{cal}
<A>__{that's right. two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. now that one is back...}
<P>__{(he looks from rose to jack)}
<A>__{... i have a pretty good idea where to fine the other.}
<P>__{(to master at arms)}
<A>__{search him. the master at arms steps up to jack.}
<C>__{master at arms}
<A>__{coat off, mate. lovejoy pulls at jack's coat and jack shakes his head in dismay, shrugging out of it. the master at arms pats him down.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{this is horseshit.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{cal, you can't be serious! we're in the middle of an emergency and you steward barnes pulls the heart of the ocean out of the pocket of jack's coat.}
<C>__{steward barnes}
<A>__{is this it? rose is stunned. needless to say, so is jack.}
<C>__{cal}
<A>__{that's it.}
<C>__{master at arms}
<A>__{right then. now don't make a fuss. he starts to handcuff jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{don't you believe it, rose. don't!}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(uncertain)}
<A>__{he couldn't have.}
<C>__{cal}
<A>__{of course he could. easy enough for a professional. he memorized the combination when you opend the safe. flashback: rose at the safe, looking in the mirror and meeting jack's eyes as he stands behind her, watching.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{but i was with him the whole time.}
<C>__{cal}
<P>__{(just to her, low and cold)}
<A>__{maybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{they put it in my pocket!}
<C>__{lovejoy}
<P>__{(holding jack's coat)}
<A>__{it's not even your pocket, son.}
<P>__{(reading)}
<A>__{"property of a. l. ryerson". lovejoy shows the coat to the master at arms. there is a label inside the collar with the owner's name.}
<C>__{master at arms}
<A>__{that was reported stolen today.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{i was going to return it! rose rose feels utterly betrayed, hurt and confused. she shrinks away from him. he starts shouting to her as lovejoy and the master at arms drag him out into the hall. she can't look him in the eye.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{rose, don't listen to them... i didn't do this! you know i didn't! you know it! she is devastated. her mother lays a comforting hand on her shoulder as te tears well up.}
<C>__{ruth}
<A>__{why do women believe men?}
