<L>__{exterior approach to black cove farm. day}
<A>__{cold mountain at its loveliest. the cabriolet with monroe and his daughter heads towards the farm. at a bend they meet a couple of riders, twins, from teague's home guard, riding furiously past them. monroe reins in the trap and lets them thunder past before continuing on their way home. monroe is intrigued by ada, as if he's never looked at her before.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{monroe}
<D>__{you're looking at this moment, i don't know why you're looking exactly like your mother.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{every time you see the doctor you get melancholy.}
<C>__{monroe}
<D>__{he listens to my heart and i get emotional.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{he gives you alcohol and you get emotional.}
<A>__{she squeezes his arm.}
<C>__{monroe}
<D>__{we commiserate about the folly of this terrible war.}
<P>__{(they ride in silence)}
<D>__{do you worry when there's no word from him?}
<P>__{(no response)}
<D>__{from mr. inman?}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{yes. but then i've tried counting the number of words which passed between mr. inman and me.}
<P>__{(looking ahead, seeing smoke)}
<D>__{is that a bonfire? so close to the barns.}
<A>__{then they see the family of slaves turn off the road as their cabriolet approaches, running away into the fields.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{monroe}
<P>__{(shouting at the disappearing slaves)}
<D>__{hey! stop there! hey!}
<A>__{monroe gets out of the cabriolet and runs into the fields after the retreating family, who are carrying bundles, chairs, personal items, all loaded up. ada has already taken the reins and has driven up to the house. the barn in which the slave family had lived is on fire. monroe catches one of the women, remonstrates with her. she's upset, distressed, one of her sons comes back, pushes monroe to the ground. they hurry away. monroe gets up, hurries to the fire. a figure swings in the heat of the flames, hanging from a beam. monroe spies it as he catches up with ada.}
<C>__{monroe}
<D>__{dear god.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{no, daddy, it's not real.}
<A>__{the figure swings round. it's an effigy, a grotesque}
<B>__{caricature of a black man.}
<C>__{monroe}
<P>__{(appalled)}
<D>__{what is wrong with us all?}
<A>__{ada turns and runs off.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{i will get help.}
<P>__{(shouting over her shoulder)}
<D>__{keep away from the flames.}
<A>__{monroe stands and considers the flames. ada turns back once more to see him a small man silhouetted against the blaze.}
