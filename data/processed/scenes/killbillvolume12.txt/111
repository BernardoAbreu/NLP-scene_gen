<L>__{exterior budd's trailer home night}
<A>__{budd pulls his pickup truck in front of his small camper home. he walks inside, shutting the door behind him. the bride rolls to a stop...observing the lonely trailer out of her windshield... texas tear ass music begins coming out of the camper....we see his figure pass the camper window, once or twice. the bride chooses her weapon hattori hanzo's samurai sword. she doesn't say anything, nor will an actress of uma thurman's caliber indicate her feelings, but the astute member of the audience will read the significance of her choice. his current status be damned, the budd who owes the bride satisfaction was a warrior. and it's that budd she intends to send to his maker. she takes a black stocking cap, and slips it on top of her skull, tucking her blonde hair underneath...}
<B>__{then...}
<A>__{...rubs black make up under both eyes, on top of both eyelids, and down the bridge of her nose...}
<B>__{then...}
<A>__{disconnects the cab lights above her, opens the truck door, and slips out unseen into the austin texas night air.}
<B>__{then...}
<A>__{on her belly, hattori hanzo sword in sheath in hand, she crawls across the desert floor towards budd's trailer.}
<B>__{then...}
<A>__{somewhere in the vast outdoors a cat jumps on a rat. their fight makes a loud racket. the bride stops and buries her face in the dirt. from inside the trailer, we hear the needle being lifted off the phonograph. from a distance we see: the shadowy figure of budd looking out the window of the camper. the bride keeps her face in the dirt. the figure of budd at the window, seems to dismiss the sound he heard for what it was a rat meeting its end at the claws of a cat. the curtain closes again. the needle is placed back on the phonograph. cu the bride face in the dirt...one mississippi...two mississippi...her eyes look up towards the trailer...all's clear...she begins crawling towards the trailer again. ...she's now right outside the trailer home...we can hear the sound of budd sitting in a chair rocking back and forth. she hears the sound of a screw top unscrewed...the sound of pouring in a glass...the sound of a glass being laid heavy on a table. crouched low on the balls of her feet, she, with great care, slowly and silently unsheathes her hanzo sword. through the bottom slit in the door, she sees the distorted image of budd's feet on the floor. she slowly rises...removes her black stocking cap...blonde hair falls around her shoulders...sword in right hand...left hand grabs the front doorknob... quick as a texas lizard on glass she brings the sword's handle down hard on the door lock ex cu cheap lock busting. she flings the front door open... the bride's pov: brother budd sitting calmly in a rocking chair, moving back and forth to the texas twang on his turntable, cradling a double barrel shotgun aimed right at the bride.}
