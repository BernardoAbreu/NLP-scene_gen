<A>__{masha carries two water buckets suspended from a pole across her shoulders. arriving at a stream, she takes each bucket and fills it. it's hot work. pausing a moment, she kneels to splash water on her face. another p.o.v. someone watches her from the trees. as masha wets a cloth, puts it around her neck. suddenly someone grabs her from behind. she screams, wrestle her way free. she turns to see valentin, flushed, smiling, excited. he steps toward her, kicks over one of the buckets.}
