<A>__{the forest engulfs jake, grace and norm in cyan gloom. the shadows are alive with the chittering sounds of unseen alien wildlife. tracking with jake as he moves through the foliage, hyper alert looking around like a tourist in hell.a monkey like prolemuris leaping from limb to limb overhead, flashing through the sunlight streaming down in shafts. a plant with swaying tendrils which reach toward jake as he passes. this forest is more alive than any on earth, with plants that react and move like animals. jake white knuckles his rifle as if every shadow conceals razor fanged death.}

<A>__{she pushes ahead of him on the trail, forcing him to lower his muzzle as he follows her. grace moves nimbly on the path, seemingly unconcerned.}
