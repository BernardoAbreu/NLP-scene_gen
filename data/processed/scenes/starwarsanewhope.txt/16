<L>__{interior rebel blockade runner hallway}
<A>__{princess leia is led down a low ceilinged hallway by a squad of armored stormtroopers. her hands are bound and she is brutally shoved when she is unable to keep up with the briskly marching troops. they stop in a smoky hallway as darth vader emerges from the shadows. the sinister dark lord stares hard at the frail young senator, but she doesn't move.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{lord vader, i should have known. only you could be so bold. the imperial senate will not sit for this, when they hear you've attacked a diplomatic...}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{don't play games with me, your highness. you weren't on any mercy mission this time. you passed directly through a restricted system. several transmissions were beamed to this ship by rebel spies. i want to know what happened to the plans they sent you.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{i don't know what you're talking about. i'm a member of the imperial senate on a diplomatic mission to alderaan...}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{you're a part of the rebel alliance... and a traitor. take her away!}
<A>__{leia is marched away down the hallway and into the smoldering hole blasted in the side of the ship. an imperial commander turns to vader.}
<C>__{commander}
<D>__{holding her is dangerous. if word of this gets out, it could generate sympathy for the rebellion in the senate.}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{i have traced the rebel spies to her. now she is my only link to find their secret base!}
<C>__{commander}
<D>__{she'll die before she tells you anything.}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{leave that to me. send a distress signal and then inform the senate that all aboard were killed!}
<A>__{another imperial officer approaches vader and the commander. they stop and snap to attention.}
<C>__{second officer}
<D>__{lord vader, the battle station plans are not aboard this ship! and no transmissions were made. an escape pod was jettisoned during the fighting, but no life forms were aboard.}
<A>__{vader turns to the commander.}
<C>__{vader}
<D>__{she must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. send a detachment down to retrieve them. see to it personally, commander. there'll be no one to stop us this time.}
<C>__{commander}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
