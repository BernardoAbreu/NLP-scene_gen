<D>__{hope ya like. what we done with the place.}
<A>__{she opens the door, enters. stares down into the deep hole. unzips the bag, and... ...tips the ashes down into the hole. watch them in slo mo, falling free. hear the rustle of agnis lifting her skirts, and... close angle on agnis' face. staring out at the sea through a small crack in the outhouse wall. hear the splatter as she voids herself.}
