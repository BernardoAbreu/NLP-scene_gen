<L>__{interior proximo's compound cell night}
<A>__{maximus silently awaits commodus' assassins with juba. they hear footsteps outside the cell. maximus stands, preparing for death.}
<C>__{juba}
<P>__{(also standing)}
<D>__{i will fight with you.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{this isn't your battle.}
<C>__{juba}
<D>__{better to die for a friend than to die for gold.}
<A>__{the door swings open and they are surprised to see proximo sweeping in with a cloaked woman. the woman gives proximo a bag of money.}
<C>__{proximo}
<D>__{enjoy yourself, madame...}
<P>__{(he glances to maximus)}
<D>__{general, perform well and there will be riches for you.}
<A>__{he beckons to juba, they go, shutting the door behind them. the woman pulls off her cloak, it is lucilla. maximus glares at her, his muscles tensing.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{rich matrons pay well to be pleasured by the bravest champions.}
<A>__{maximus backs up, fighting the urge to strangle her on the spot. he finally bumps into a wall of the cell.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{i knew your brother would send assassins. i didn't think he would send his best.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{maximus, listen to me }
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{my family were crucified and burnt while they were still alive.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{i knew nothing of that.}
<C>__{maximus}
<P>__{(low)}
<D>__{don't lie to me.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{i wept for them.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{don't.}
<A>__{a long, tense moment. she does not look at him.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{do you know what it is to be the daughter of the emperor? i learned on the night my father had my husband killed. i loved my husband very much. very... simply. he was a man who believed in the republic. he was a man who thought marcus should be tending to rome and not conquering the world. one night my father had him strangled for conspiring with the senate. my father never spoke of it. i never spoke of it. that is what it is to be the daughter of rome.}
<A>__{she finally looks up at maximus.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{my son will live. he will survive this cursed bloodline. rome will die and the jackals will pick her clean but my son will survive. empires come and go. cities crumble to dust. only family matters.}
<A>__{a beat. despite himself, maximus is moved.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{my son was innocent.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{so is mine.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{i want your brother dead.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{so do i.}
<A>__{a beat. maximus is surprised at her direct answer.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{my son will never be safe while he lives.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{how do you plan it?}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{the senate is with us, and the city guard. we have growing power in the streets. but we need a leader. someone the people can }
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{so the crown passes to your son.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{no. so that my son will be safe. so that we may leave this charnel house forever and never look back. look into my eyes, maximus, and believe what i say to you...}
<A>__{she rivets him intensely with her eyes.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{by all the gods, and in the name of my father who loved you, and in the name of the husband i loved... i swear to stand by your side in this now and always.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{what is your son's name?}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{lucius verus. like his father.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{i weep for him.}
<A>__{a long beat. maximus' cold eyes give away nothing. lucilla turns and starts to go. she stops, not looking back.}
<C>__{lucilla}
<D>__{commodus plans to kill you in your next match in the arena. he's planning something. i will pray for you. as i have always done.}
<A>__{she then pulls something from her robes and sets it down, a little bundle wrapped in cloth. she sweeps out. the sound of the door being bolted shut on the other side. maximus stands for a moment and then goes to what she has left. he opens the cloth. inside are his six "ancestor" figures. he picks up one of the figures. he looks at it deeply, gently feeling along the contours with a finger.}
