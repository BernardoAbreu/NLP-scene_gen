<L>__{interior boutique day}
<A>__{vivian is no sooner in the door than she is subject to the disapproving stare of a saleswoman standing behind the counter.}
<C>__{saleswoman}
<P>__{(cooly)}
<D>__{may i help you?}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{i'm just looking, thanks.}
<A>__{vivian tiptoes through the shop as if it was filled with delicate glass objects. she cautiously examines a dress. the saleswoman quickly comes around the counter and approaches her.}
<C>__{saleswoman}
<D>__{are you looking for something in particular?}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{yes. something... conservative.}
<C>__{saleswoman}
<D>__{yes...}
<A>__{vivian eyes the saleswoman, puzzled at her tone. she examines a dress.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{you have beautiful things.}
<P>__{(no reply)}
<D>__{how much is this?}
<C>__{saleswoman}
<D>__{i don't think it would fit you.}
<C>__{vivian}
<P>__{(beginning to get the drift)}
<D>__{i didn't ask if it would fit. i asked how much it was.}
<C>__{saleswoman}
<D>__{it's very expensive.}
<A>__{vivian's body tenses as she stares at the saleswoman.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{what is with you?}
<C>__{saleswoman}
<P>__{(unblinking)}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{i'm going to spend money.}
<C>__{saleswoman}
<D>__{i don't think we have anything for you here. you're obviously in the wrong place.}
<A>__{vivian is speechless. she turns and stomps toward the door. she stops and spins around staring at the saleswoman. vivian flips her off. she throws the door open and storms outside. the saleswoman calmly strolls back to her counter and returns to her place.}
