<L>__{exterior circle line cruise day}
<A>__{the boat pulls away front=the dock. it's misting rain so there's only a smattering of tourists on board. david stands looking back at manhattan. harry is next to him.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{a lot of people just collapse when they see what you've seen. their personal choices suddenly seem meaningless to them. life starts to feel pointless.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i was raised to believe there's something behind the curtain. i just never pictured it quite like this.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{most people don't.}
<A>__{harry looks over his shoulder, scans for any signs of his colleagues. he's far from relaxed.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{how are you feeling?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you should know. you can read my mind, right?}
<A>__{harry hesitates... as if he's not sure how much to tell david, how far to go with this. finally:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{richardson was just trying to scare you.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{he knew what color i was thinking.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{because he set it up as a choice. "choose a color. choose a number"}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{so?}
<A>__{harry looks away. he's crossing a line. he's really putting himself out there:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{we can't read your mind or hear your thoughts. but before you make a choice your brain weighs options, and we percpite that. we know if you're going to go off plan "or not because, as long as we're close enough, we can sense it when it's about to happen.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's like a sixth sense for you?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{seventh, actually.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what did they do too charlie?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{made some small change in the way he assesses risk.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what type of risk?}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(this is beside the point)}
<D>__{i don't know. something arcane. something to do with mortgage backed securities.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{that's all?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what would your colleagues do to you if they knew what you were telling me?}
<A>__{this is precisely what harry has been worried about.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{that's why we're meeting out here.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{they're not following me?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{we don't have the manpower to follow everybody all the time. they're checking in on you. just not here. not right now.}
<A>__{on david's face considering this.}
