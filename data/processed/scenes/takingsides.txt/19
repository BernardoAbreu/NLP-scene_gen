<L>__{interior steve's office night}
<A>__{the final bars of the fifth symphony. snowing. dim light. there is more furniture now: two chairs, one comfortable, the other upright. a sitting area by the window with the telephone extension. the 16 mm projector set up in another corner. steve, at his desk, wrapped up against the cold, going through files, making notes. he stops, seems to listen, then goes to the window, looks out. the music ends. the record hisses. steve just stares out at the night and the snow. the record continues to hiss.}
