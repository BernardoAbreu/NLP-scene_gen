<L>__{interior level ten, arcade's brain night}
<A>__{inside, the lobby is a cacophony of light and sound. we hear hundreds of voices at once...whispering...fading in and out... it's like channels being changed. a snippet of an opera here, maybe bugs bunny's voice there...rap music, country music, a woman in the throes of orgasm, nazis screaming "heil hitler!", anything and everything.}
<B>__{signs blink on and off...}
<A>__{catchy phrases like, "this is my brain and welcome to it", and "i think, therefore, i'm fucked" flash before us.}
<B>__{t.v. monitors}
<A>__{are everywhere, displaying an endless array of static. and now the monitors are displaying fractals. every single one of them. we hear the cellos, like an orchestra tuning up.}
<B>__{alex}
<A>__{throws her hands over her ears as the sounds become unbearable.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(top of her lungs)}
<D>__{shut up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!}
<A>__{she pulls out her gun at fires into the sounds and images. shooting the fuck out of everything. monitor screens shatter, glass flies and... ...just like that, total silence descends. one by one, the lights blink off, and it's dark once again.}
