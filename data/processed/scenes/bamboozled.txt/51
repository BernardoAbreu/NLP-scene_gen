<B>__{close on}
<A>__{delacroix he surveys the room. p.o.v. delacroix all of the writers are caucasian male and female. every single last one.}
<B>__{angle on}

<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{good morning, for those of you who don't know me, i'm pierre delacroix. i'm running things and this here is my assistant sloan hopkins.}
<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{i've never worked with any of you and you've never worked with me so we'll be starting from scratch. i'm a fair person, a straight shooter and i don't hold my tongue. everybody up in here should know i had nothing to do with you being hired.}
<C>__{delacroix }
<D>__{i would have preferred at least one other negro writer. any questions? comments?}
<A>__{mona raises her hand.}
<C>__{delacroix }
<D>__{yes, your name?}
<C>__{mona}
<D>__{he, i'm mona.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{hi, mona.}
<C>__{mona}
<D>__{i perfectly understand where you're coming from. as a minority i can relate to your struggle also. but i think you should give us all a chance. we want this pilot to be successful just as much as you. please don't be so quick to judge us based only on our whiteness.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{oh, is that what i'm doing?}
<A>__{beth jumps in.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i think because of our background we can bring a unique perspective to mantan.}
<A>__{seth pipes in also.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{a fresh pair of eyes. a new look, insight, new angle that hasn't been seen before.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{i've heard this somewhere before.}
<A>__{david raises his hand.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{my name is david. i do think it would be better to have some african american writers but for whatever reason they are not here. i don't know if they couldn't find any people with experience, they wouldn't work for the pay or refused to work for the show. i don't know and nobody in this room probably knows either. i'm looking at this as a unique opportunity. we all should. i'm a damn good writer and i'm ready to go to work.}
<A>__{everyone in the room applauds. sloan looks at delacroix.}
<B>__{freeze frame}
<C>__{delacroix }
<D>__{this thing was rigged, the deck was stacked, the fix was in. could don king be near? good thing sloan had my back. she's my rock. this was going to be a whole lot of work.}
<A>__{un freeze frame}
<C>__{delacroix }
<D>__{david, i appreciate your comments. anybody got an ideas? everybody just talk out loud.}
<C>__{mona}
<D>__{i've always liked the format of rowan and martin's "laugh in."}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{that could be cool.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{what about something like "the jeffersons?" i grew up in idaho so that's how i got my understanding of black people. through sherman helmsley, louissee!!!.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{"good times" was better. kid dy no mite!!!}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{you pole are going to far back for me. i think we have to go after a hipper feel. like the stuff eddie murphy used to do on "saturday night live."}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{or martin. you go girl.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{what about the black exploitation films? no one has ever tried making that work on tv.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{and for reason. have you ever seen "scream blacula, scream?"}
<C>__{mona}
<D>__{i think, and delacroix will agree with me, the politics of this show have to be right. we should always be laughing with our characters, not at them.}
<B>__{close on}
<A>__{delacroix, as the writers continue to ramble on, he lets them jerk off.}
<C>__{delacroix }
<D>__{the mission was accomplished. all of these people left the room thinking they would have real input. i was writing this pilot alone, myself, me.}
