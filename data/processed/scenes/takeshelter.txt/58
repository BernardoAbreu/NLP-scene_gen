<D>__{where you goin'? curtis. where you goin'?}
<A>__{by curtis' truck, curtis stops and rests his hands on the bed of the truck. another thunder strike makes him flinch. curtis vomits next to the back tire. he quickly stands, wiping his mouth. he checks over his shoulders to see if anyone has seen him. i e. curtis' truck rural highway moving day curtis studies his face in the rearview mirror as he sails down the rural highway. he rubs his eyes with the back of his hand and looks in the side mirror. the horizon is still clear. curtis begins to hyperventilate. short breaths accompanied by cold sweat. sucking air. he can't breath. he panics. the truck tires slide on the gravel shoulder as he abruptly slams on the brakes and steers off the highway. dust settles outside as curtis begins to get his breathing under control. he rests his head on the steering wheel and shuts his eyes tight. everything quiets down. his breathing. the road. no more thunder. curtis looks out his passenger window. his truck has stopped in front of a tractor trailer depot. a rusted shipping container with giant white letters painted on it reads, "containers for sale". curtis stares at this. he climbs out of the truck.}
