<D>__{this better be important, you pulled me out of session.}
<A>__{darwin kaplan, the president's aide and one of the four men in the room, definitely the most intense, smiles thinly.}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{senator, i wouldn't have asked you to come here if it wasn't.}
<A>__{the senator starts to sit down. kaplan turns toward the senator.}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{senator, we just received a communication that axl torvalds was intercepted entering the continental u.s.}
<C>__{senator reisman}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{within the last two hours. according to our source inside the f.b.i., he was nabbed coming through customs at l.a.x. alone...}
<C>__{senator reisman}
<D>__{do they know who they are dealing with?}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{it is unlikely, sir. it was a routine check and torvalds freaked out. they just got lucky.}
<C>__{senator reisman}
<D>__{this ain't good, boys. the vortex has used torvalds before. what do the feds know?}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{nothing as of yet. he's refusing to speak english and the finnish consulate has already contacted the state department...}
<C>__{senator reisman}
<D>__{so we haven't been compromised?}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{we're not sure. we're working on that right now.}
<C>__{senator reisman}
<D>__{you better get sure real quick, son, 'cause someone's cock's liable to end up on the block on this one. and i promise you it won't be mine.}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{senator, i think we'll be okay here }
<C>__{senator reisman}
<D>__{i don't fucking pay you to think, kaplan. i pay you to keep me informed. i know the vortex. that's why i voted against using him on american soil.}
<C>__{senator reisman }
<D>__{it's like using the ebola virus to cure a cancer patient. son, what do you think's going to happen if he starts tying up loose ends.}
<A>__{they look at each other.}
<C>__{kaplan}
<D>__{yessir. i understand.}
