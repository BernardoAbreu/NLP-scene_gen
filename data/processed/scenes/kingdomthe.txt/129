<L>__{interior suburban later}
<A>__{flying down a highway. haytham driving. sykes up front. the rest of the team crammed in back: fleury next to al ghazi; mayes and leavitt on the back bench. everyone spent. grant stares up at a distant jet climbing out. the police radio belching calm codes and calls every few seconds.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<P>__{(to al gahzi)}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<A>__{al ghazi looks up at fleury, slowly shakes his head.}
<D>__{al ghazi amateurs. it's a small win.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{ronald fleury }
<D>__{i'm thinking about new york february 26, 1993. the first time they tried to hit the trade towers.}
<C>__{grant sykes}
<D>__{i'm thinking about going straight to dan's, gonna order six pbrs }
<C>__{janet mayes}
<D>__{ pabst?}
<C>__{adam leavitt}
<D>__{keep it real. you ever drink pbr, haytham?}
<C>__{haytham}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{grant sykes}
<D>__{any beer?}
<C>__{haytham}
<P>__{(small smile)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{grant sykes}
<D>__{now...that's just unreasonable. good police work and problem drinking are like a chicken and egg thing: which enables the other?}
<A>__{in the back, al ghazi can't help a small smile either. fleury's not into it. all business, pissed, clearly does not want pabst.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<P>__{(to al ghazi)}
<D>__{remember how we caught that cell? al ghazi yes. car bomb. he went back to pick up his deposit on the rental car.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{four hundred dollars. for four hundred dollars, he was caught. stupidity. catching the cell was easy. just like this. the cell came back.}
<A>__{fleury looks at al ghazi. he knows the win is small. also knows that's all she wrote, for now.}
<C>__{ronald fleury }
<D>__{i will be back. colonel al ghazi yes, you will.}
<A>__{the police band suddenly squelches loud with excited arabic. everyone perks, leans up to listen to the urgency.}
<P>__{colonel al ghazi (cont'd) (translating radio chatter)}
<D>__{religious demonstration in progress. back near the city center.}
<A>__{a small collective smirk, sigh of relief. fleury turns in his seat.}
<C>__{grant sykes}
<D>__{i'm serious. beer will open up your subconscious. canned beer especially. give you instincts they can't teach }
<A>__{fleury notices the suburban bringing up the rear has dropped back.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<P>__{(looking back)}
<D>__{is he responding to the call? dropped back...}
<P>__{colonel al ghazi (o.c.) (turning)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{al ghazi and fleury both looking back to the following suburban now. dropped back, sunglasses and blank faces staring back at them. fleury looks to the overpass above he sees a young man on a cell phone. as they pass, the kid runs to watch them from the other side. al ghazi gets to the cb radio, in arabic:}
<P>__{colonel al ghazi (cont'd)}
<D>__{tighten up }
<A>__{ the trailing suburban doesn't `tighten up.' it falls further back. fleury instinctively turns, wide eyed out the window: a small brown truck swerves out of the opposing lanes, flying across the desert median, aimed at the convoy. without hesitation fleury reaches over haytham, rips the steering wheel right, nosing away from the approach...}
