<C>__{catherine}
<P>__{(in a whisper)}
<D>__{that's why she killed herself?}
<A>__{he is twisting her arm, staring at her, pulling her against him. we hear the door behind them. a beat, and he lets her go, turns away from her. roxy stands there, staring at them. her hair is up. she wears a black motorcycle jacket, a black t shirt, and black jeans and cowboy boots.}
<C>__{catherine}
<P>__{(brightly)}
<D>__{hiya, hon. you two have met, haven't you?}
<A>__{roxy looks at nick. catherine goes to her, kisses her briefly on the lips, stands there with her arm around her both of them looking at nick. he walks by them, opens the door to go, his face a mask.}
