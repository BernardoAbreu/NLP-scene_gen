<D>__{be careful you don't get any of that guck on your sweater ... let me comb your hair before your old man gets here, it's stinking up in the back.}

<D>__{soon...}
<A>__{just then, o'malley becomes aware of a bad vibe in the air. a foreign presence. nolan, and turner have followed him and sonny from mrs. o'malley's house. now they approach }
<C>__{nolan}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{hey, o'malley! long time no see.}
<P>__{(approaching)}
<D>__{taking a trip somewhere?}
<A>__{o'malley slip the tape from his pocket, placing it under sonny's jacket on the bench without missing a beat, as he calmly starts to rise.}
<C>__{o'malley}
<P>__{(to sonny, under his breath)}
<D>__{make sure your father gets this ...}
<P>__{(to nolan)}
<D>__{yeah. me and my son are visiting my mother in new mexico.}
<A>__{o'malley gets up, starts to move toward the men.}
<C>__{nolan}
<D>__{your son, huh? that's funny. he doesn't look much like you }
<P>__{(to his partner)}
<D>__{does he, turner?}
<A>__{they both laugh.}

<D>__{looks a lot like mason storm.}
<A>__{o'malley and the men come to face off point, staring at each other.}
<C>__{nolan}
<D>__{enough of this fucking around. we want the tape.}
<A>__{clunk! o.s. we hear a clattering echo. sonny has picked up his jacket. the tape has fallen onto the marble floor!}
<C>__{o'malley}
<D>__{sonny run!}
<A>__{sonny snatches up the tape and leaps over the bench, racing toward the rear doorway heading for the street. nolan and turner start to run after him. o'malley throws a fierce body block on both men, sending all three crashing into a big, loaded luggage cart. o'malley finds his feet first as all three struggle to get up. nolan starts to pull his gun. o'malley grabs a heavy metallic suitcase and smashes nolan in the face with all his strength. nolan crashes backward against turner, toppling them both into a huge 25 foot lighting installer's ladder which now starts to cave over, pulling a string of dozens of big industrial globes plummeting to the floor and exploding into thousands of tiny shards! people scream. o'malley shoves the luggage cart at the men and races for the door }
