<L>__{interior shower time unknown}
<A>__{steaming water. almost painful. i sit in the tub, let the shower rain down. drain floods diluted red. wash my wounds, my soul. so many bruises i look bubonic. my face still swelling, already purple black. my left eye more than swollen shut. on the other side of the curtain: glenda naked. beauty that catches in my chest. try to stand, turn my destroyed face. she gently pushes me back down. sits into me, holds my face in both hands so that the water hits my lips. no nerves, no unease. home. she closes the curtain.}
