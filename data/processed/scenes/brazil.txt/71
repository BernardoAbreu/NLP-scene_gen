<L>__{interior sam's flat evening}
<A>__{sam enters. the place is in a state of turmoil. servicing panels are off the walls. conduit, ducting, pipes, unknown mechanical horrors spew from the wall as if the place was disemboweled. spoor stands in the middle of it all trying to direct two other workmen who are poring over wiring plans which seem to make little sense to them. dowser is not visible but there is a great deal of clunking and banging going on somewhere behind the wall.}

<D>__{what the ? how did you ?}

<P>__{(muffled)}
<D>__{...ergency procedures.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{i haven't got an emergency. get out of here.}
<A>__{for reply spoor whips a small tape recorder out of his bag and plays back sam's original phone call to central services, claiming "an emergency". spoor shuts off his machine, puts back into his bag and comes out with what looks like a quite thin phone hook with carbon paper between each page. spoor indicates the bottom of page 1.}
<C>__{spoor}
<D>__{sign here please.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{spoor}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{it's a 27b 6, what did you think it was?}
<A>__{sam takes out kurtzman's old fashioned fountain pen from his pocket, signs where indicated. spoor registers that sam's signature has hardly penetrated through he first carbon let alone the other 43}
<C>__{spoor}
<P>__{(sourly)}
<D>__{haven't you got a ballpoint?}
<A>__{sam resignedly starts signing all the other pages one by one. spoor realises that dowser's echo has gone missing.}
<C>__{spoor}
<D>__{now where's he got to?}
<P>__{(shouts)}
<D>__{dowser!}
<A>__{dowser bursts through a panel in the wall. this is the panel which tuttle had removed and replaced. a few of the flat's intestines have come out with dowser. dowser has made a find tuttle's spare part.}
<C>__{spoor}
<D>__{what have you got there?}
<C>__{dowser}
<P>__{(highly excited)}
<D>__{got there!}
<A>__{dowser points to tuttle's spare part which is hanging out of the wall attached to rubber tube. spoor examines this closely. sam watches alarmed. the two men go into a mumbling huddle.}
<C>__{spoor}
<D>__{mumble ... mumble ... mumble ... tuttle}
<C>__{dowser}
<D>__{mumble ... tuttle ...}
<C>__{spoor}
<D>__{tuttle! ... mumble!}
<P>__{(to sam)}
<D>__{you've had that scab tuttle here, haven't you?}
<C>__{dowser}
<D>__{...aven't you?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{spoor}
<D>__{who fixed your ducts?}
<C>__{dowser}
<D>__{...your ducts?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i fixed it myself.}
<C>__{spoor}
<D>__{oh yeh? where'd you get this from eh}
<P>__{(he holds up tuttle's spare part)}
<D>__{out yer nostril?}
<C>__{dowser}
<D>__{...yer nostril?}
<C>__{spoor}
<D>__{central services don't take kindly to sabotage!}
<C>__{dowser}
<D>__{...sabotage!}
<A>__{spoor and dowser and the other workmen gather up their tools put them in the bag, grab everything else that belongs to them and are leaving. spoor grabs the form book out of sam's hands, rips out the last page, thrusts that page at sam, shoves the book into his bag. the workmen begin leaving the flat.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{hang on! wait a minute! you can't just go and leave it like this!}
<C>__{spoor}
<P>__{(mock innocent)}
<D>__{why not? all you've got to do is blow yer nose and fix it, haven't you?}
<C>__{dowser}
<D>__{...ven't you?}

<P>__{(leaving)}
<D>__{you're putting your talents to very odd use mr lowry yes, odd use to pit wits against central services }
<C>__{dowser}
<D>__{...sod you, stupid twit.}
<A>__{they go, slamming the door behind hem, leaving sam in the ruins of his flat. sam stands in the maimed sitting room. wall panels are off. tubes, ducting wires etc. spill out into the room like greasy intestines. sam more or less collapses onto a couch. he stares at the ceiling. the room is gently hiccoughing and belching around him. he stares at the print out of jill's face. slowly it dissolves into the}
