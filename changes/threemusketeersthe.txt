<LOC>__{EXT. GASCONY - DAWN}
<ACTION>__{Dawn. A verdant field in Gascony. BIRDS CALL from treetops. The WIND RUSTLES through green leaves. A fox darts into a thick hedge. And last, anti-pastoral, out of place -- the sound of CLASHING STEEL. SUPERIMPOSE:   France, 1625. Suddenly, two young men burst INTO VIEW, sword points cutting brilliant arcs through the morning air. The first is GIRARD, bearded, nearly thirty, a man in every facet. The second, D'ARTAGNAN. Younger in appearance and attitude. Exuberant, handsome. And at just this moment, bounding over a low stone wall with a boisterous cry. They battle across an expanse of turf thick with dew. Girard is the more polished combatant. But d'Artagnan is nearly a force of nature. He whips his sword through the air with wild-hearted abandon. He tumbles and somersaults. This is fun. Girard and d'Artagnan cross the field, pass over a wooden fence, struggle toward a stable and hayloft. As they fight, both men utilize a variety of props. Handfuls of hay, a wooden spar, quick kicks from heavy boots. Anything goes as the swords cut through the air. D'Artagnan, gaining increasing advantage, forces Girard up against a peaceful country manor. Girard, seemingly cornered, executes a gymnastic flip onto the roof, fights from this high angle. D'Artagnan merely smiles... and follows.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{ANGLE ON ROOFTOP}
<ACTION>__{Seen briefly in silhouette against the rising sun, Girard and d'Artagnan scramble up the v-shaped rooftop, pause to exchange swipes at the peak, then slide down the other side, attacking, defending, as they go.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{INCLUDE INTERIOR}
<ACTION>__{Inside the manor house, a HANDSOME WOMAN of forty glances up from her writing table, hears FOOTSTEPS on the roof. She reacts -- curious, not afraid -- and steps to an open window. As  if to follow the footsteps to the other side.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{BACK TO SCENE}
<ACTION>__{Girard leaps to the ground first -- landing in an enclosure filled with SQUAWKING GEESE. D'Artagnan flies after. The geese scatter, d'Artagnan -- whose wild progress frequently resembles that of a young colt -- stumbles briefly. Girard seeks advantage, thrusts his sword toward the young man's heart. But d'Artagnan parries the blow with a heavy gloved hand, rolls over the offending goose -- glances deadpan apology -- and rises to fight again. The epic battle continues. Girard's modest success devolves into desperate flight. D'Artagnan's seemingly endless reserves are wearing him down. Then, at the last possible moment, Girard spies escape: a slowmoving HAYCART RUIMBLING up the country road. He runs toward the cart, leaps upon it, turns back to d'Artagnan with a confident smirk -- an expression that vanishes when the young Gascon executes a nearly impossible leap to join him. And still they battle, the clash of swords a kind of music by now, the men, their exuberance, the bright morning all combined into a dazzlingly heroic display. Just then: The haycart crosses a wooden plank bridge. Girard backs from d'Artagnan's sword, weak from exhaustion, he stumbles. D'Artagnan has his man and he knows it. He prepares one last blow -- -- And the haycart shifts, deposits both men over the side and down to the small muddy creek below. A comical antidote to all this glorious swordplay.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{INCLUDE CREEK}
<ACTION>__{Girard lands flat on his back, stunned, his sword out of reach. D'Artagnan lands similarly, but recovers with grace, or rather, as much grace as the muddy situation will allow. He rolls toward Girard, sword in hand, and lightly places the sharp gleaming tip against his adam's apple. A long beat. Then a surprise. Girard begins to laugh, long and loud. D'Artagnan responds with a charmed smile.}

It appears the Gruards are celebrating a victory. But wait. There's something wrong with this picture. On closer inspection, we see that the Guards have been stripped to their underclothes and tied to their chairs with ropes. They are all bruised and bloody. Some are unconscious. Presiding over the "celebration" are two Musketeers. They sit at the head of the table, relaxing with their boots up. One of them casually cleans his sword with a lace handkerchief.

Aramis is a seamless and graceful technician, he handles his two opponents with balletic ease, an artist working with steel and flesh, rather than paint and canvas. And last, and perhaps the most entertaining of all, Porthos. He is a walking arsenal, carrying a variety of bizarre weapons on his body -- a crossbow, daggers, bolo, nunchucks -- all of which he uses with the polished skill of a master. Add this funhouse of armaments to his already impressive size and strength, and you have a oneman wrecking crew of epic proportions. D'Artagnan's youthful energy is by now familiar.
