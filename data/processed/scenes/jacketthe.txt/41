<B>__{later}
<A>__{becker turns around from the window and we see that his cheek is bandaged. he opens a drawer, takes out some scotch and pours himself a shot. he swallows some pills with it. after he drinks it, he looks up to see gries standing opposite him, watching.}
<C>__{dr. gries}
<D>__{you ok?}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{i'm fine.}
<C>__{dr. gries}
<D>__{[beat] listen, i hate to bother you...}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{then don't.}
<C>__{dr. gries}
<D>__{but... what about starks?}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{what about starks?}
<C>__{dr. gries}
<D>__{should we be...}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{should we be what? trying to change him any way we can? [beat] yes.}
<C>__{dr. gries}
<D>__{but the jacket? i mean...should we be leaving him in like that? becker [as if stunned by the question] leaving him in? [beat] the medication i'm given him is intended to adjust maybe even reset his violent proclivities. you know, peel away some of those layers of hate. the jacket's merely a safe place for that to happen. the grounds and the halls where i can't monitor side effects i can't predict aren't. dr. gries [still doubtful] but, but...what about... becker [mocking gries] but...but what about the gun? i mean, should he have been firing away like that? [shaking his head at gries] you can't fuck up a life that's already been fucked up. [turning away] there, there's the insurance you're looking for.}
<C>__{dr. gries}
<D>__{i'm not looking for anything.}
<A>__{becker shakes his head, laughing inside at the world's stupidity.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{[beat] it's christmas eve, justin. don't you have somewhere to be?}
<A>__{becker doesn't wait for an answer, just turns back towards the window and takes another sip of his drink.}
