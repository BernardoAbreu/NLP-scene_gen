<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{you speak like a true explorer.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i like you, mr raleigh.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{and i like you.}
<A>__{she stops and turns to meet raleigh's eyes. she's not used to such direct replies. bess is watching them.}

<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{raleigh}
<D>__{i think it must be hard for so great a queen to know the simple pleasure of being liked for herself.}
<A>__{elizabeth stares. this is a little too close to the truth.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{now you become dull.}
