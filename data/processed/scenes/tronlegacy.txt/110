<L>__{exterior x net arteries various}
<A>__{plexor's cruiser speeds through a new, as yet unused x net switching station. it's heavily secured. x takk troops defer to their supreme leader. plexor veers onto a proprietary side route, bound for:}
<L>__{exterior x net central server}
<A>__{firewall apertures cool, anticipating plexor's arrival. encryption portal opens. plexor's cruiser glides in. portal closes. firewalls reactivate, blazing red hot, sealing the fortress.}
<L>__{interior x net central server}
<A>__{towering corridors. powerful armored x takk guards stand in pairs at every portal, corner and column. plexor strides past, steps into a special gate. data beams react with his circuitry. encryption key resolves. gate opens.}
<L>__{interior programming chamber}
<A>__{plexor strides across the spare, sleek space. on a slab lies mega, radiated from above by reader beams. plexor considers her glowing body circuits. studies emerging data patterns. satisfied, he halts the process. beams go dark.}

<A>__{mega awakens, sits up. she sees the device, then plexor.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{you treat me like i've been corrupted.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{i cannot predict the random effects flynn might have caused in you.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{you programmed me to gather intelligence. that's all i've ever done.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{how long have you known flynn?}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{enough time to gain his trust.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{your behavior was highly authentic.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{to him. it had to be.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{have you allowed flynn to complete a full interface with you?}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{i am programmed to allow such access only to you, plexor.}
<A>__{her eyes lock on him. he is satisfied.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{flynn claims to be a user. as did the one called rush.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{users do not exist.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{you have seen nothing to make you doubt this?}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{they possess no powers beyond those of routine programs?}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{i have no knowledge of such powers.}
<A>__{she steps down. they walk out of the chamber.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{still, there is something about them i cannot compute. flynn plans to attack me, doesn't he?}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{yes. and rush will fight by his side.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{where will they strike?}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{flynn does not decide until the hour of his attack. but he trusts me completely. when he knows the place, i will know it as well.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{perfect. they will be met with a final thrashing. yes, let them come.}
<A>__{they pass through the gate, arrive in the corridor.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{have you further instructions for me?}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{none for now. but stay close.}
<A>__{they lock gazes. barcode data surges between them.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{you came to me full of glitches and random routines. look at you now. what an extraordinary piece of programming i have made of you. i created x net to the same standard of flawless beauty. soon, its perfection will become all that is, and all that ever will be.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{all events remain under your control.}
<A>__{with a smirk and a final jolt of data, plexor leaves her.}
