<B>__{afternoon}
<A>__{the door is opened by a guard and ethan takes a step into the room then stops in manifest shock. martin is at his heels, eager and expectant. beyond them stands keefer, grave and compassionate. there is a keening sound in the room almost an animal sound.}
<L>__{interior the chapel reverse shot full}
<A>__{it is a simple log sided room with plank benches without backs. up front is a small box like pulpit, no altar. across the front of the room, set up either on benches or on boards over saw horses are four blanket covered figures at least two being the bodies of children. squatting on the floor near them is an elderly white woman with hair hanging loosely down her back and clad in indian robes. standing, facing the newcomers, is a woman who may be no more than in her mid thirties. she is mad wild eyed, frightened, with matted, unbrushed golden hair, torn garments. it is she who has been making the keening sound, the animal moans. now she crouches at the sight of them and looks desperately for a means of escape. two girls are asleep, heads together and backs to the door. one has light hair, like debbie's; the other brown hair. the afternoon sun coming through a high window touches the light hair.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{debbie?... debbie?}
<A>__{he has seen the light hair and starts crossing the room. now the madwoman begins her screaming, running from side to side like a trapped animal. ethan follows martin into the room, keefer behind him. martin comes to a stop, realizing the woman is afraid of him. the two sleeping girls stir, but do not turn.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{don't be scared, ma'am...}
<A>__{the madwoman crouches behind one of the benches, looking at them with frightened eyes.}
<C>__{keefer}
<D>__{just don't pay any attention to her...}
<A>__{martin swallows and nods and crosses to the light haired girl. he reaches a hand gingerly to touch her shoulder.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{debbie?}
<A>__{at the touch, the girl is on her feet, crouching one hand, like a claw, drawn back to rake his face. she is unmistakably a white girl, but she is painted like a comanche woman her ears red inside, streaks of paint accenting the savagery of her face. her eyes are frightened, yet full of hate.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{pabo taibo!}
<P>__{(white man!)}
<D>__{the other girl has risen almost in the same instant but more out of fear. she is younger, but painted like the other. she moves to stand behind the savage one.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{no... she's not...}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i ain't sure... where's that doll?}
<A>__{martin stares at him, then realizes what he has in mind. he fishes the rag doll from under his coat and holds it out to the girl. she looks at it... and we may almost suspect it is rekindling a memory but then she spits at it. the other girl laughs. martin turns away and he's sick.}
<C>__{keefer}
<D>__{was your niece about their age?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{not far from it...}
<C>__{keefer}
<D>__{hard to realize they're white, isn't it...}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(grimly)}
<D>__{they're not white any more they're comanche!... let's see the bodies...}
<A>__{martin nerves himself for the ordeal, turns to follow.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i don't need you...}
<A>__{ethan and keefer move away. as they do, the madwoman eyes fixed on the rag doll in martin's hand begins creeping up behind him. martin is torturedly watching ethan and keefer as first one blanket then another is raised we will never see the dead. during this:}
<C>__{keefer}
<P>__{(the dispassionate pro)}
<D>__{i'd like you to see them all... it might help us identify them... shot in the head flash burn range... the boy got his skull cracked... here's the girl...}
<A>__{martin stiffens, waiting.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{no...}
<A>__{martin relaxes... and in that instant the madwoman has the doll in her hands. she cradles it and she croons. martin reaches to take it away. but she calmly sits, cradling the doll, and rocks to and fro, humming a lullaby. he can't take it. ethan returns.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{well, we only got the one lead scar... and where we begin to look, i don't know...}
<C>__{keefer}
<D>__{there's one thing. we recovered a bushel of trinkets in that camp... cheap stuff... trade goods... couldn't help noticing that most of it was mexican... maybe if you could talk to some of those mexican traders along the border... what do they call themselves?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{comancheros...}
<C>__{keefer}
<D>__{that's the breed... course it might take time.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{time's running out... but i'm obliged to you.}
<A>__{they leave.}
