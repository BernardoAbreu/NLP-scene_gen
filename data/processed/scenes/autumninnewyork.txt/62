<A>__{wills and charlotte lie in bed with the blinds open and the city glimmering in the distance. charlotte's head rests on his chest. eyes closed, he brushes his hand along her face as though he were a blind man committing every detail to memory. charlotte's voice, almost inaudible, drifts up through the dark }

<D>__{"counting the beats, counting the slow heart beats, the bleeding to death of time in slow heart beats, wakeful they lie."}
<A>__{wills, half asleep, murmurs deeply }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{so many words in that wonderful head of yours...}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{if i could give you anything in the whole world, that's what it would be.}

<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{poetry.}
<A>__{they lie in silence.}
