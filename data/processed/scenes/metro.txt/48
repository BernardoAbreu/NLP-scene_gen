<L>__{interior metro division headquarters day}
<A>__{roper enters the squadroom. his mood is contained. he walks to a desk where kimura and glass are huddling. a couple desks over, mccall is reclining in roper's chair, reading a book entitled, "strategies and counter measures in hostage situations". on the desk in front of him is the bottle with the pen cap still in it.}
<C>__{roper}
<P>__{(to kimura and glass)}
<D>__{what do you got on korda?}
<C>__{kimura}
<D>__{we ran a search on relatives. he has a cousin in town clarence teal. smalltime thief. last known address was on pine street. he moved out a month ago. we've got a couple leads on him to check out.}
<C>__{roper}
<P>__{(rapid fire)}
<D>__{did you check out dmv for any vehicles registration?}
<C>__{kimura}
<D>__{being faxed over now.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{how about the record room for any incident reports? he might be a victim. we can get medical records. check with burglary detail and see if anyone else knows him, knows his habits.}
<C>__{kimura}
<D>__{roper...}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{and what about bars? we can talk to neighbors to see what bars he frequents.}
<C>__{kimura}
<D>__{roper, we're into it...}
<A>__{suddenly solis appears at their side.}
<C>__{solis}
<D>__{we've had this conversation once, roper. you're not active on this case.}
<A>__{roper looks at him icily.}
<C>__{solis}
<D>__{it's in everyone's best interest.}
<A>__{mccall, kimura, glass all watch this confrontation tensely. after a beat, roper gives in. indicates his compliance. solis heads back to this office.}
<C>__{roper}
<P>__{(softened)}
<D>__{you guys are doing good work.}
<A>__{he moves toward the desk. mccall gets up when he sees him coming.}
<C>__{mccall}
<D>__{i'm sorry about your friend. i had a friend in swat killed. i know how it can be.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{i appreciate your concern. let's leave it at that.}
<A>__{mccall respectfully drops it. roper looks down at the soda bottle.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{i don't see much progress here.}
<A>__{mccall holds up a finger. not so fast. he picks up a pot from a nearby "mr. coffee" machine. it's filled with water. he takes the water and slowly pours it into the bottle.}
<B>__{close on the bottle}
<A>__{the pen cap floats to the top and mccall plucks it out without touching or moving the bottle.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{very nice... you get an "a". notice... no force required. no damage.}
<A>__{just then a sergeant calls to roper across the squadroom.}
<C>__{sergeant}
<D>__{roper, domestic disturbance at 472 6th street. possible hostage situation.}
<A>__{mccall grabs his duffel bag. roper starts away from the desk, then notices the book on "hostage strategies". he looks at the title, then makes a demonstration of dropping it in the trash can. he and mccall head out.}
