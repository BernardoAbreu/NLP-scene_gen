<L>__{exterior ben's house veranda morning}
<A>__{susan and suzette sit there. suzette's holding a news paper the ossewa susan's thoughtful, her face is red and discomposed obviously she had cried. the phone rings but they deliberately ignore it. ben appears with the newspapers under his arm, sees suzette's sports car and hurries to join them. suzette doesn't even give him a chance to kiss her.}
<C>__{suzette}
<P>__{(jumping up and showing the cover of ossewa)}
<D>__{now, papa, this is going too far! how could you?}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{how's that, suzette?}
<A>__{ben takes the newspaper and looks at the cover. a picture of himself and emily outside the courtroom. the two faces are close together with the notes:}
<D>__{"emily ngubene, wife of native who died in detention, comforted by a friend of family, mr. ben du toit."}
<A>__{and in parenthesis "see page two." he throws the ossewa on a chair and checks into the rand daily mail. inside there is a long article with emily's picture, titled "the face of grief." ben folds up the newspapers, and shakes his head. he suddenly realizes why the people reacted like that outside.}
<C>__{suzette}
<D>__{you didn't stop to think of the family. poor mother, how can she face anyone? and tomorrow is sunday!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{now listen...}
<A>__{johan steps into the veranda.}
<C>__{johan}
<D>__{what's everybody yelling about?}
<C>__{suzette}
<D>__{you listen, papa, just tell me, why?}
<A>__{recognizing his father in the photo, johan has picked up the newspaper from the chair.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{do you really think i specially arranged for the photographers to take that picture? and what's more it's distorted.}
<C>__{suzette}
<D>__{what's distorted about it? your face is practically touching that meid's face, like you were about to kiss her.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(disgruntled)}
<D>__{suzette, pull yourself together!}
<C>__{suzette}
<D>__{today the whole country has seen that photograph. we, your children, are going to suffer. at this very moment chris is negotiating with the provincial council. would you like to see them cancel it? you have no feeling, papa!}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{suzette!}
<A>__{she leaves in rage.}
<C>__{johan}
<P>__{(conciliating)}
<D>__{what's papa done, anyway? if something happened to him, wouldn't you be upset?}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(standing up)}
<D>__{not enough, johan, to throw myself into the garden boy's arms.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{that goes without saying.}
<C>__{johan}
<P>__{(trying to joke)}
<D>__{there must be easier ways of getting your name in the paper.}
<A>__{before she can stop herself, susan slaps him across the face, although not hard. johan leaves without a word. she clutches her hand, shocked at having it against him. the phone starts to ring. susan runs out sobbing. ben looks at her then walks into the living room to pick up the phone.}
