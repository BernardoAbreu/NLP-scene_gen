<L>__{interior level eight, concrete wasteland night}
<A>__{...alex and the boy are now standing on the top of a concrete incline. it extends downward into a system of tunnels and viaducts. the ringing starts immediately, followed by the flash on the horizon. time's already up. the little boy reaches for alex's hand, frightened.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{how did you get here? did you play the game?!}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{yes...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{thought so.}
<A>__{alex removes pulls her thrasher board from her back and drops it on the lip of the incline. there's a flash and the board has changes into a motorcycle. a sleek black one.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{can you hang onto my back?}
<A>__{the little boy nods. he knows that alex is his only chance of getting out of here. nevertheless, we can tell that he's terrified. alex kneels down next to him. the wind around them has picked up and the ringing increases. high pitched, stabbing into our brains.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(over noise)}
<D>__{there's a monster here. we have to kill it before we can leave. that's what we have to do. i know it's scary, but i won't let anything happen to you. okay?}
<A>__{the boy nods again.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{then we'll go home?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{then we'll go home.}
<A>__{alex's wrist display starts beeping and...boom! the ringing is replaced by the screamer's shriek. in the distance, the screamer is a fireball spiraling towards the city. alex jumps on the motorcycle and pulls the boy up. he crawls behind her and hugs her back tightly.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(pulling down her visor)}
<D>__{here goes everything.}
<A>__{she fingers the throttle and the cycle roars to life. it rockets off the incline and down into the tunnels.}
<B>__{a series of shots}
<A>__{as alex maneuvers the cycle through a forest of concrete. it's a harrowing ride, as her headlight reveals little of what's up ahead. somewhere above the tunnels, the screamer has arrived. in the course of the chase, it's shriek will become louder and louder as it draws closer, locating alex.}
<B>__{another cycle}
<A>__{appears out of side tunnels and a chase is on. the rider is dressed in black with glowing death's head masks.}
<C>__{boy}
<P>__{(to alex)}
<D>__{dark riders! if they touch us, we're dead!}
<A>__{the tunnels get narrower and narrower, as alex keeps pushing the limit off the bike. rider #1 tries to cut alex off, charging forward and ramming her bike... alex almost loses it, but finds balance once again, sweeping left and up the side of a circular tunnel... rider #1 bites it. his cycle careens into the wall and explodes in a shower of green light. the death's head tumbles away, spinning end over end. the screamer blasts over the remains of the rider, having entered the tunnels.}
<B>__{two more riders appears}
<A>__{gaining on alex. rider #2 pulls a staff from his back and thrusts it forward like a lance. chink! the staff hits alex's rear wheel, nearly throwing her. the rider pulls off a gloved and reaches a glowing, skeletal hand towards them. death touch. the boy screams in terror. up ahead, a wall is rushing to meet them. alex jams the breaks and slides skids sideways, cutting right at the last possible moment... wham!!! rider #2 slams into the end wall, not able to negotiate the turn. another explosion of green and the second death's head comes tumbling away. alex looks back. there should be one rider left, only now their are three! alex guns the bike and cuts sharply to the right... new tunnel alex screeches to a stop, having found yet another fork. the tunnel branches off into two directions. two neon signs with arrows point in opposite directions.}
<B>__{neon signs}
<A>__{they read, "this way" and "that way". alex checks her wrist display. not much time left.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{which way?}
<C>__{boy}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{that way.}
<A>__{alex backs up the cycle and heads down the tunnel marked "this way" instead.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{sorry.}
<B>__{the tunnel}
<A>__{it narrows almost immediately. alex hears a roar, glances behind her, and sees four death's head riders on her tail. she makes another turn... ahead, is a crumbling brick wall with the words "wrong way" painted in blood red.}
<C>__{boy}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{it's the wrong way!}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(over the noise)}
<D>__{in this world, wrong is right!}
<A>__{suddenly, the tunnel behind them flares with light, shaking like an earthquake. the screamer has found them.}
<B>__{a key}
<A>__{hangs out from the wall, sort of like the brass ring on a merry go round. alex snags it as she sweeps by.}
<B>__{the screamer}
<A>__{rockets around the corner, twisting down the narrow tunnel. alex grinds the motorcycle forward for all it's worth, and the screamer is literally breathing down her neck. she turns corner after corner, faster and faster, scraping the bike into the scum covered walls and shooting out showers of sparks. if she takes one second too long to negotiate a turn, pauses for even an instant, the screamer will be on them...}
<B>__{a clawed hand}
<A>__{lashes out and tears away the cycle's tail pipe. another hand takes out a chunk of the seat...}
<B>__{the boy}
<A>__{is wailing, curling low to avoid the screamer's claws... ahead, the tunnel narrows to a dead end. alex and the screamer are on a collision course. a hundred miles an hour and gaining... the screamer lashes out again, gouging a bloody gash in alex's shoulder and cutting clear through her armor. it's claws sink into her flesh, latching on. alex cries out in pain, her face contorted into a mask of agony and fear. she pulls out a knife with her left hand a stabs blindly into the monster...}
<B>__{the screamer}
<A>__{lurches forward onto the motorcycle and opens its jaws wide. black saliva and ooze flow from it's mouth splashing over alex's shoulder's and neck. it's going to bite her head off. it's going to... alex and the screamer slam into the dead end and a spectacular fireball of green light consumes the screen.
