<L>__{exterior junkyard night}
<A>__{the junkyard is filled with junked cars, metal garbage, old equipment. the camera sits awkwardly on the hood of a wrecked car as andrew fidgets to get it mounted. the area is lit by lights from the main building, not too far away, but you can tell he's not supposed to be in here.}
<T>__{cut:}
<A>__{andrew moves out in front of the camera. he telekinetically pulls an old car forward, and lifts it easily. he moves it left, moves it right, rolls it, sets it back down.}
