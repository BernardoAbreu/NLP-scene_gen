<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{dad!}
<C>__{ultra magnus}
<D>__{autobots, prepare to board the shuttles. this new menace is more dangerous than all the decepticons put together. somehow we must destroy it before it devours cybertron.}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{but what about my dad? he's on the moon between that monster and cybertron.}
<C>__{ultra magnus}
<D>__{daniel, i will do everything i can for spike.}

<C>__{ultra magnus}
<D>__{kup, hot rod. get the dinobots out of here!}
