<L>__{interior living room. night}
<A>__{david is in the middle of demonstrating his ability to mimic all of the goons. jack and marjorie are laughing so hard that they can hardly see they certainly miss jenny's entrance.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(curious)}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh. hello. david does the most brilliant bluebottle, jenny. actually, he can do all the goons.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i don't think i'm very good at eccles.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, no, you've got him...}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(impatiently)}
<D>__{but what's he doing here?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i wasn't going to disturb you. i knew you'd have your nose to the grindstone.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{you came to see mum and dad?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{is that so hard to imagine?}
<A>__{jenny spies an open bottle of wine on the coffee table.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{and you're drinking? but it's not christmas!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hark at her! makes us sound as though we've signed the pledge. you don't know everything about us, you know. we had a life before you came along.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{yes, that's true. i'm only going on what i've seen over the last sixteen years.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{i'm trying to think what you missed. nothing much comes to mind.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{they can't stand to see me enjoying myself.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{anyway. would you excuse me? i've got a huge pile of latin translation to do.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you didn't tell me david went to oxford.}
<A>__{jenny looks at david, who stares back at her straight faced.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{no. i didn't.}
<C>__{david}
<A>__{for all the good it did me.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{what did you read?}
<C>__{david}
<A>__{oh, english. just like every other semi employed layabout in london.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(marvelling at the}
<A>__{coincidence) english! which college?}
<C>__{david}
<A>__{merton.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<A>__{isn't that funny?}
<C>__{jenny}
<A>__{extraordinary.}
<C>__{david}
<A>__{i was just telling jack that i'm going back next weekend. i go and see my old professor every now and again.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{that's what you need, jenny. someone on the inside track. it's not always what you know, is it, david?}
<C>__{david}
<A>__{too true. and clive would love jenny. have you ever come across clive lewis?}
<C>__{jenny}
<A>__{dad has never come across anyone.}
<C>__{david}
<A>__{i just thought he might know some of the books.}
<C>__{jenny}
<A>__{dad has never read any books.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(stung)}
<A>__{what's he written?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{he wrote a children's book called `the lion, the witch and the wardrobe' that did very well, i believe.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{cs lewis? that's the clive you're talking about?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{well, to us he was just the old codger who taught medieval literature. but i came to know him very well. we just...got along, do you know what i mean?}
<A>__{everyone murmurs their comprehension.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{jenny used to love those books.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{gosh. that dates me. he was writing them when i was there.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i'd love to meet him.}
<A>__{there is a pause. jack and marjorie look at the floor. somehow, david has manoeuvred a situation where, effectively, he is the one being asked.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm being slow on the uptake. would jenny like to come with me at the weekend?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{well, i don't know about this weekend. but one day, yes, thank you.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{how often do you see him?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{oh, once every couple of years. but next time, eh?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{hopefully i will be there by then. so that won't be much use.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(dubiously)}
<D>__{well, i suppose...would she have to stay the night?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{well, i wouldn't want to drive back after one of those oxford dinners.}
<A>__{jack chuckles knowingly.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{clive will get her a room in college. that's easy enough.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{sounds like too good an opportunity to pass up.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{please, daddy. it would be so helpful to know something about the place.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{would it be a bother to you, david?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i'd be delighted.}
<A>__{jack, marjorie and jenny all beam.}
