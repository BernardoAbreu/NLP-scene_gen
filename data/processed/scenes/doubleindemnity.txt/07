<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i didn't feel like eating dinner when i left, and i didn't feel like a show, so i drove home, put the car away and went up to my apartment.}
<A>__{a 44 interior neff's apartment living room (dusk) it is a double apartment of conventional design, with kitchen, dinette, and bathroom, squarecut overstuffed borax furniture. gas logs are lit in the imitation fireplace. neff stands by the window with his coat off and his tie loose. raindrops strike against the glass. he turns away impatiently, paces up and down past a caddy bag with golf clubs in it, pulls one out at random, makes a couple of short swings, throws the club on the couch, paces again.}
<C>__{neff's voice}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{it had begun to rain outside and i watched it get dark and didn't even turn on the light. that didn't help me either. i was all twisted up inside, and i was still holding on to that red hot poker. and right then it came over me that i hadn't walked out on anything at all, that the hook was too strong, that this wasn't the end between her and me. it was only the beginning.}
<A>__{the doorbell rings.}
<C>__{neff's voice}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{so at eight o'clock the bell would ring and i would know who it was without even having to think, as if it was the most natural thing in the world.}
<A>__{neff goes to the door and opens it.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{neff just looks at her.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{you forgot your hat this afternoon.}
<A>__{she has nothing in her hands but her bag.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{did i?}
<A>__{he looks down at her hands.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{don't you want me to bring it in?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{sure. put it on the chair.}
<A>__{she comes in. he closes the door.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{how did you know where i live?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{it's in the phone book.}
<A>__{neff switches on the standing lamp.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{it's raining.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{so it is. peel off your coat and sit down.}
<A>__{she starts to take off her coat.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{your husband out?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{long beach. they're spudding in a new well. he phoned he'd be late. about nine thirty.}
<A>__{he takes her coat and lays it across the back of a chair.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{it's about time you said you're glad to see me.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i knew you wouldn't leave it like that.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{like it was this afternoon.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i must have said something that gave you a terribly wrong impression. you must surely see that. you must never think anything like that about me, walter.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{it's not okay. not if you don't believe me.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{what do you want me to do?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i want you to be nice to me. like the first time you came to the house.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{it can't be like the first time. something has happened.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i know it has. it's happened to us.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{that's what i mean.}
<A>__{phyllis has moved over to the window. she stares out through the wet window pane.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{what's the matter now?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i feel as if he was watching me. not that he cares about me. not any more. but he keeps me on a leash. so tight i can't breathe. i'm scared.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{what of? he's in long beach, isn't he?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i oughtn't to have come.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{maybe you oughtn't.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{you want me to go?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{if you want to.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{right now?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{sure. right now.}
<A>__{by this time, he has hold of her wrist. he draws her to him slowly and kisses her. her arms tighten around him. after a moment he pulls his head back, still holding her close.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{how were you going to do it?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{do what?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{kill him.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{walter, for the last time }
<A>__{she tries to jerk away but he holds her and kisses her again.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i'm crazy about you, baby.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i'm crazy about you, walter.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{that perfume on your hair. what's the name of it?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{something french. i bought it down at ensenada.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{we ought to have some of that pink wine to go with it. the kind that bubbles. but all i have is bourbon.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{bourbon is fine, walter.}
<A>__{he lets her go and moves toward the dinette. a 45 the dinette and kitchen it contains a small table and some chairs. a low glass and china cabinet is built between the dinette and kitchen, leaving a space like a doorway. the kitchen is the usual apartment house kitchen, with stove, ice box, sink, etc. it is quite small. neff goes to the ice box and phyllis drifts in after him.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{soda?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{plain water, please.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{get a couple of glasses, will you.}
<A>__{he points at the china closet. he has taken a tray of ice cubes from the refrigerator and is holding it under the hot water faucet.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{you know, about six months ago a guy slipped on the soap in his bathtub and knocked himself cold and drowned. only he had accident insurance. so they had an autopsy and she didn't get away with it.}
<A>__{phyllis has the glasses now. she hands them to him. he dumps some ice cubes into the glasses.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{who didn't?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{his wife.}
<A>__{he reaches for the whiskey bottle on top of the china closet.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{and there was another case where a guy was found shot and his wife said he was cleaning a gun and his stomach got in the way. all she collected was a three to ten stretch in tehachapi.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{perhaps it was worth it to her.}
<A>__{neff hands her a glass.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{see if you can carry this as far as the living room.}
<A>__{they move back toward the living room. a 46 living room phyllis and neff go toward the davenport. she is sipping her drink and looking around.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{it's nice here, walter. who takes care of it for you?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{a colored woman comes in twice a week.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{you get your own breakfast?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{once in a while i squeeze a grapefruit. the rest i get at the corner drugstore.}
<A>__{they sit on the davenport, fairly close together.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{it sounds wonderful. just strangers beside you. you don't know them. you don't hate them. you don't have to sit across the table and smile at him and that daughter of his every morning of your life.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{what daughter? oh, that little girl on the piano.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{yes. lola. she lives with us. he thinks a lot more of her than he does of me.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{ever think of a divorce?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{he wouldn't give me a divorce.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i suppose because it would cost him money.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{he hasn't got any money. not since he went into the oil business.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{but he had when you married him?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{yes, he had. and i wanted a home. why not? but that wasn't the only reason. i was his wife's nurse. she was sick for a long time. when she died, he was all broken up. i pitied him so.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{and now you hate him.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{yes, walter. he's so mean to me. every time i buy a dress or a pair of shoes he yells his head off. he won't let me go anywhere. he keeps me shut up. he's always been mean to me. even his life insurance all goes to that daughter of his. that lola.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{nothing for you at all, huh?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{no. and nothing is just what i'm worth to him.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{so you lie awake in the dark and listen to him snore and get ideas.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{walter, i don't want to kill him. i never did. not even when he gets drunk and slaps my face.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{only sometimes you wish he was dead.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{perhaps i do.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{and you wish it was an accident, and you had that policy. for fifty thousand dollars. is that it?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{perhaps that too.}
<A>__{she takes a long drink.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{the other night we drove home from a party. he was drunk again. when we got into the garage he just sat there with his head on the steering wheel and the motor still running. and i thought what it would be like if i didn't switch it off, just closed the garage door and left him there.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i will tell you what it would be like, if you had that accident policy, and tried to pull a monoxide job. we have a guy in our office named keyes. for him a set up like that would be just like a slice of rare roast beef. in three minutes he'd know it wasn't an accident. in ten minutes you'd be sitting under the hot lights. in half an hour you'd be signing your name to a confession.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{but walter, i didn't do it. i'm not going to do it.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{not if there's an insurance company in the picture, baby. so long as you're honest they'll pay you with a smile, but you just try to pull something like that and you'll find out. they know more tricks than a carload of monkeys. and if there's a death mixed up in it, you haven't got a prayer. they'll hang you as sure as ten dimes will buy a dollar, baby.}
<A>__{she begins to cry. he puts his arms around her and kisses her.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{just stop thinking about it, will you.}
<A>__{he holds her tight. their heads touch, side by side, the camera slowly starts to recede as we}
