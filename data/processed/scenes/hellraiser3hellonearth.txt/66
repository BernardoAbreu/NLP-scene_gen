<A>__{the view through the big picture window is entirely normal again; the cityscape by night. suddenly, joey seems to appear behind the glass translucent, like a reflection and comes through the window into her apartment, "solidifying" as she steps in. her hands are at her head and she staggers forward a few steps. it's as if the enormity of her trip thru realities has just hit her. she falls forward onto the floor of her room, unconscious.}
