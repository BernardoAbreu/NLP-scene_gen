<A>__{indy fires up the engine and pulls away from the dock... but not before a turkish agent jumps in with him. elsa grabs the wheel and begins to steer the boat while indy and the turk trade punches.}

<A>__{indy's speedboat bounces across the choppy waters heading in the direction of the docked steamship. kazim and his men rush to two more speedboats tied to the dock. they chase after indy. indy grapples with the turkish agent. as indy grips his arms, we see a gun in the agent's hand. it fires. as indy fights with the turk, he becomes aware of the speedboats behind him and two enormous freighters ahead of him, joined together by two giant ropes. indy, having gained the advantage, leans on top of the turkish agent.}

<A>__{indy finally delivers the punch that sends the turkish agent flying overboard. turning, indy sees that elsa has committed the speedboat to a course between the two freighters, now being pushed even closer together by a tugboat.}
