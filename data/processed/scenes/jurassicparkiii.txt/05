<L>__{interior dining room night}
<A>__{winden to a parrot in a large cage. grant is teasing the bird with a cookie, holding a it just out of reach.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{what's my name? come on, jack, say it. is my name alan? say my name. the bird doesn't respond.}
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{he used to know me.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{sorry, alan it's been six years.}
<A>__{grant shrugs, gives jack the cookie, and heads towards the table. the three adults are finishing their dessert and coffee. the the children have been out to bed. an awkward moment of silence. uncomfortable smiles. then }
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{more coffee?}
<C>__{ellie}
<P>__{(relived)}
<D>__{yes. great.}
<A>__{mark stands and collects their cups.}
<C>__{ellie }
<D>__{so, mark's working at the state department now.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{really?}
<P>__{(to mark)}
<D>__{what do you do there?}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(with mock bravado)}
<D>__{i could tell you about it, but than i'd have to kill you.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{indeed.}
<A>__{mark smiles, nodding. then he goes into the kitchen. another uncomfortable silence.}
<C>__{ellie}
<A>__{so what are you working on now?}
<C>__{grant}
<A>__{we have a new site in montana. at least until the money runs out.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{anything good?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{raptors, mostly.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{my favorite.}
<A>__{grant leans forward, realizing ellie's one of the few people he can talk to about this.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{you remember the sounds they made?}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{i try not to.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{we've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. i have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. the way they can work together as a team.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{you think they could talk to each other?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{to a degree we never imagined.}
<A>__{and from the cage in the corner of the room...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{bullshit!}
<A>__{both look back at the parrot. ellie smiles.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{you taught him that.}
