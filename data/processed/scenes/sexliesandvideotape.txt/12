<L>__{interior john and ann millaney's house night}
<A>__{everyone but ann is asleep. she gets up from her bed and sneaks quietly into the guest bedroom where graham is staying. she walks cautiously up to his bed to watch him as he sleeps. moonlight caresses his face as he breathes peacefully. exhaling, he turns over slowly, his back to ann. she picks up his jacket from beside the bed and feels the surface. she brings the jacket to her nose, inhaling his presence. she then sets the jacket down.}
