<T>__{cut :}
<A>__{to an overhead shot of asakawa being lowered into the well. cut : now to asakawa inside the well, her face and clothes covered with grime, body simultaneously limp with exhaustion and tense with fright. unable to resist the impulse, asakawa slowly looks over her shoulder and down into the well. the dankness, the claustrophobia seeps in and she draws in her breath in the first signs of panic.}
<C>__{ryuji}
<D>__{dont look down!}
<A>__{she returns her gaze, cranes her neck upward. cut : to ryuji leaning over the rim of the well, peering down at her. for an instant, everything becomes monochrome. its not ryuji looking down at her at all; its professor ikuma, checking to see if shes still alive or if the blow to the back of her head has finished her off. cut : to asakawa, her eyes wide with fright. asakawa comes to rest at the bottom of the well. a flashlight hangs from another rope, but its beam has almost no effect on the darkness. asakawa crouches forward, hands moving searchingly through the water. she calls out pleadingly.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{where are you? please, come out.}
<A>__{asakawa straightens, unties herself from the rope. a full bucket already awaits. she tugs on the rope and ryuji pulls it up. she scoops up a second bucket, but something stops her from sending it up. instead, she begins running her arms through the water again, her voice close to tears.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{please. where are you?}
<A>__{asakawa continues her blind fumbling, which sends up little splashes of stagnant water. with a start, she realizes that her fingers have caught something. seaweed? asakawa draws her hands close for a better look... and sees that is hair. a thick clump of long, black hair. suddenly a pale, thin arm shoots out from beneath the water, catching asakawa just below the wrist. asakawas ears are filled with a sound like moaning as something slowly rises from its watery slumber. it is a girl, her face completely hidden by long, black hair. cut : to a shot of asakawas face. far from being frightened, her features are oddly placid. she regards the fearsome thing before her with an almost tender look. asakawa reaches out, lightly strokes that long hair.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{its you...}
<A>__{she strokes the hair again, and abruptly it peels right off the head with a loud squelch. revealed is not a face at all but a skull. its sockets are at first menacingly empty, but then begin to ooze the green sludge it has pulled up from the bottom of the well. like a mother comforting a frightened child, asakawa pulls the skeletal remains to her breast, strokes the bony head comfortingly. her eyes begin to glaze.}
