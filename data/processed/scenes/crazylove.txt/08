<A>__{a bunch of boys play kickball in a haze of sawdust. chandra sits on a bench, clamping an ice pack to her nose. jenny, a limber 8 year old, hangs upside down from the jungle gym. letty talks on her cell phone. she glances around to monitor her wards, eyes darting like a hawk's toward the kickball game.}
