<L>__{exterior pat's car day}
<A>__{pat is sitting in the driver's seat. the car is bumping up and down.}
<D>__{"pat morita" strength is just as much in the mind as it is the muscle. remember, both need to be exercised.}
<A>__{we pull back to see hal lifting the car up over his head. he's hardly straining.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{i'm lifting a freaking car!!!}
<A>__{pat leans on the horn.}
<D>__{"pat morita" hey, corky? you listening?}
<A>__{two highly attractive female joggers run by. they're clearly impressed with hal's show of strength. he smiles and mouths a "hello."}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{yeah, work both muscles.}
