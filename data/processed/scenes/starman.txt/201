<L>__{exterior deserted railroad siding dusk}
<A>__{jenny and the star man are following the tracks to an abandoned boxcar.}
<L>__{interior boxcar dusk}
<A>__{the star man climbs in and pulls jenny after him. jenny is shivering badly.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{can you close the door?}
<A>__{the star man scrapes it forward. he activates the satel compass which lights the interior of the boxcar. while he is doing this jenny turns her back to him and takes off her jacket. her teeth chattering, she tries to wring the water out of it.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{you are cold.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you're damn right i am.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{i do not get cold.}
<A>__{clutching the windbreaker to her breasts, jenny looks at the star man over her shoulder. it doesn't take her long to make up her mind.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(crossing to him)}
<D>__{open your shirt.}
<A>__{she waits while he struggles with the buttons. after two she brushes away his hands and undoes the rest. she lets the windbreaker drop and, slipping her arms around his waist, presses her bare chest against his.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(savoring it)}
<D>__{oh, you're warm... put your arms around me.}
<A>__{the star man does and jenny jumps as the wet sleeves touch her back.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{take your shirt off.}
<A>__{it is difficult with jenny around his waist, but he manages. he drapes his arms over her. she snuggles into him. the rain pounds on the roof. gradually, jenny responds to the star man's warmth and relaxes. she lifts her head off his chest and looks at him.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{she brushes her lips against his. the star man's not sure what's happening. but he's not offended. her next kiss is full and long. he accepts it with his eyes open and when she eases back he leans in for more. jenny responds. as if on command, the satel compass comes from around behind the star man to hover in back of jenny. he takes it between his palms and extinguishes it.}
