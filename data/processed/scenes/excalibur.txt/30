<L>__{exterior stone in the forest day}
<A>__{uther has gained on his pursuers. he comes to a small clearing where the spine of a buried boulder rises through the forest floor. he stops upon it, breathing hard, dripping blood. he rages aloud, but his throat is raw and cracked and only a whisper comes out.}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{merlin, where are you? to weave a mist, to hide us...}
<A>__{he hears his pursuers closing in.}
<C>__{uther}
<D>__{no one shall have the sword. no one shall wield excalibur but me.}
<A>__{he holds it by the hilt with both hands, the blade pointing to the ground of stone. he flexes his knees. he lifts up his hands above his head. and with all the strength that rage and pain can muster, and more, he drives the blade of excalibur into the stone, nearly to the hilt. his mouth widens in an awful silent scream, and then the foam of saliva pink with blood issues from deep within him, so violent was his effort. as the sword cuts into the rock, the earth shudders.}
