<L>__{interior loki’s liar, underground lab day}
<A>__{two soldiers run down a tunnel...we hear them coming. they run into the lab where dozens of men are working, including selvig. loki sits and watches, spear in hand. it glows and he is transported to another world.}
<L>__{exterior space (continuous)}
<C>__{the other}
<D>__{the chitauri grow restless.}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{let them goad themselves. i will lead them in a glorious battle.}
<C>__{the other}
<D>__{battle? against the meager might of earth.}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{glorious not lengthy if your force is as formidable as you claim.}
<C>__{the other}
<D>__{you question us? you question him? he who out the scepter in your hand, who gave you ancient knowledge and new purpose? when you were cast out defeated!}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{i was a king! the rightful king of asgard, betrayed.}
<C>__{the other}
<D>__{your ambition is little, full of childish need. we look beyond the earth to greater worlds the tesseract will unveil.}
<C>__{loki}
<D>__{you don’t have the tesseract yet.}
<A>__{the chitauri creature lunges at loki, hissing.}
<D>__{i don’t threaten. but until i open the doors, until your force is mine to command, you are but words.}
<C>__{the other}
<D>__{you will have your war, asgardian. if you fail, if the tesseract is kept from us, there will be no realm, no barren moon, no crevice, where he cannot find you. you think you know pain? he will make you long for something as sweet as pain.}
