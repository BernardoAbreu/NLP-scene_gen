<L>__{interior kate's bedroom night}
<A>__{leopold and kate sit on her bed watching david lettering. kate clutches her pillow close to her. she looks over at leopold concentrating on the tv with furrowed brow. she smiles sadly. she takes her pillow and flings it off her bed. she snuggles up to leopold. they watch tv. together.}

<A>__{leopold and kate eat lunch. leopold scans a newspaper. on the tv over the bar, bob dole is speaking out against gun control.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{public office is apparently still the last refuge for the incompetent. show me a man who does not want his gun registered and i will show you a man who should not own a gun. what is a pee pee girl?}

<C>__{kate}
<D>__{leopold, i don't know if that's such a good idea.}

<C>__{kate}
<D>__{you have to be patient.}
