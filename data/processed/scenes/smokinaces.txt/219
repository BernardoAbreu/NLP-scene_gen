<A>__{messner, a few feet from the car containing sykes. more sniper fire rakes the hallway. another elevator arrives, opens...call girls inside. they snuck up somehow, past security... the gunplay gets them spooked, scared they scramble from the car cops and feds try to stuff them back inside the elevator as rounds continue to rain down. one of the girls catches a hard ricochet, wig leaping off her head as a bounced bullet punches through her skull she crumbles, instant casualty. messner hardly notices, moving instead toward the other elevator car.}
