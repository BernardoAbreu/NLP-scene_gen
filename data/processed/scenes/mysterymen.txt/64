<L>__{interior banquet iiall a moment later}
<A>__{as our heroes step inside and see... a big luncheon is in progress. casanova, anabel, and tony p sit at the head table. the room is lined with banquet tables, which are filled with vicious looking characters, drunk, eating, laughing, and giving the waitresses a very rough tim..}
<C>__{raja}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{oh my god... every crook in the city is here.}
<B>__{on a group of vicious looking bald biker types...}
<C>__{raja }
<D>__{the bone heads from the south side...}
<A>__{on three insipidly evil looking guys in hip suits...}
<C>__{raja }
<D>__{the bland boys from downtown...}
<A>__{on a dark haired white guy dressed as a rapper...}
<C>__{raja }
<D>__{italian ice...}
<A>__{on a guy with a frightening assortment of metal things piercing his face...}
<C>__{raja }
<D>__{the stapler...}
<B>__{on two thugs dressed as elvis...}
<C>__{raja }
<D>__{the elvis brothers.}
<A>__{a more degenerate group of criminals never sat down to lunch. furious recognizes one of the waitresses... it's monica. casanova's got his eye on her, too, and he remembers her from the night before on the street with furious. on anabel, noticing his interest. our heroes see monica walking straight toward them. they turn away, lean against a wail, trying to be totally inconspicuous... but as she passes them, not noticing them... casanova approaches her.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{she stops, turns to him, while our heroes listen in, only a few feet away...}
<C>__{casanova}
<P>__{(reading her name tag)}
<D>__{monica... beautiful name. it suits you.}
<A>__{close on furious, getting jealous.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{i hope you won't take this the wrong way, but i couldn't help but notice... that you're a dead ringer for veronica lake in "the blue dahlia".}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{furious growls. raja gives him an elbow.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{are you an actress?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{just a waitress.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{you underestimate yourself.}
<A>__{mister furious is fuming. the strands of his perfectly coiffed disco do start to stand straight up.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{you know i'm writing a play it's just a little broadway thing, but thure's a part in it that i think you'd be perfect for.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{i'd love to hear you read it. could you stick around after the luncheon?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{sure i guess.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{terrific.}
<A>__{she turns and walks into the kitchen. close on casanova, watching her; his intentions are sinister... he turns and sees... our heroes, hanging by the wall.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{what are you three doing here? this is invited guests only. out.}
<A>__{our heroes skulk out. just outside the banquet hall continuous as our heroes step out and breathe a sigh of relief.}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{that was too close.}
<C>__{shoveler}
<D>__{but we gotta find out what's going on in there.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{furious has spotted... a large covered dessert table, waiting to be wheeled into the hall. back in the banquet hall a few minutes later as the dessert table is wheeled in... and in a closer angle, under the table cloth, we see three pairs of disco shoes creeping along... a few minutes later, monica steps up to the dessert table... suddenly, she is yanked under. under the table continuous monica struggles, tries to cry out, but a hand is clamped firmly over her mouth.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{it's me.}
<A>__{she calms down, and he takes his hand off her mouth.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{what are you guys doing here? raja & shoveler shhhh!}
<A>__{the waitresses leave; the big doors to the dining room are swung closed, and the cigars are lit. the meeting has begun. casanova takes the podium.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{thank you all for coming. i hope you enjoy the cigars. i had to kill a dozen cubans to get them.}
<A>__{tony p chuckles loudly, but the joke goes over like a lead balloon with the rest of the crowd.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{twenty years ago, this town was yours! and i was your king!}
<A>__{on the hoods, listening, bored, puffing on their cigars; this is a sad old story.}
<C>__{casanova}
<P>__{(tragically)}
<D>__{but they called me a psycho, and they put me away. for twenty years i rotted in my cell, painting watercolors, writing haikus just waiting for the day i could take my revenge. well, brothers, that day has come!}
<A>__{on our heroes under the table, listening. monica begins to realize what's going on. back to casanova }
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{they thought i was crazy? well the joke's on them because tonight at precisely midnight on the twentieth anniversary of my tragic arrest every man, woman, and child in this city is going to turn into a raving psycsotic! mothers will murder their tots! old ladies will strangle their cats! children will bump off their babysitters!}
<A>__{the guests think casanova's completely lost it. italian ice speaks up.}
<C>__{italian ice}
<D>__{you're outta your mind!}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{i beg your pardon?}
<C>__{italian ice}
<D>__{nobody could drive a whole city crazy.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{tell you what, ice. i will mke you a friendly little wager. it i can't do it... you can blow my brains out. if i can, i will blow out yours.}
<A>__{now the hoods' interest has been perked.}
<C>__{italian ice}
<D>__{done.}
<C>__{casanova}
<P>__{(to anabel, with a smile)}
<D>__{honey, give the boys a taste.}
<A>__{anabel puts on a pair of heavy duty sound deadening ear protectors, then presses a button on a small remote control device. angle on a speaker, placed above the podium... as the air is suddenly filled with a weird, stridulating, horrific noise (somewhere between the sound of a fire siren and a hornet trapped in your ear) and everyone in the room (except anabel) goes completely berserk... camera pans the tables as the guests laugh dementedly, punching, gouging, strangling, and stabbing each other... under the serving table our heroes go crazy... casanova, in a state of psychotic ecstasy, whips out his pistol and empties it into italian ice... who drops to the floor, dead. anabel presses the button again; the sound winds down and stops, and everything returns to normal. the entire event lasted only a few seconds, but the guests are dazzled.}
<C>__{crooks}
<D>__{that was great!... what the hell was that?... how did you do that?}
<A>__{casanova throws anabel a kiss.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{tonight, at midnight, that sound will be amplified across this entire city. murder and mayhem will reign supreme! and champion city will be ours again! this will be our castle! and i will be our king! and there's no one to stop us!}
<A>__{suddenly, a familiar voice is heard.}
<C>__{amazing }
<D>__{not so fast, casanova!}
<A>__{a pair of curtains suddenly part... and captain amazing (looking a bit singed) is standing there in classic superhero pose. camera pans the crooks, as their criminal ecstasy turns instantly to terror. they yank out their pistols, dive for cover under the table, throw up their hands in surrender, etc... but casanova just grins.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{don't worry, fellas...}
<P>__{(moves to captain amazing, and puts his arm chummily around him)}
<D>__{i killed him... and i've had him stuffed.}
<A>__{casaova reaches behind captain amazing's back and pulls a string (like the ones they used to have on those old talking dolls).}
<C>__{amazing}
<P>__{(in a canned voice)}
<D>__{isn't my butt cute in these tights?}
<P>__{(pulls again)}
<D>__{blue is my color.}
<P>__{(pulls again)}
<D>__{oh, my abs are killing me!}
<A>__{the crooks are beside themselves with laughter. on our heroes, under the table, stunned. on the elvis brothers }
<C>__{elvis brother i}
<D>__{the king is back!}
<C>__{elvis brother 2}
<D>__{long live the king!}
<A>__{the crooks fire their pistols exuberantly into the air, as disco music fills the air and casanova dances, basking in their adoration... and our heroes slip out from under the table and make good their escape...}
