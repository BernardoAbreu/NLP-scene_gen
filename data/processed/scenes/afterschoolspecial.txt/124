<L>__{exterior deacon's house back yard night}
<A>__{deacon stands by the water skipping rocks with matt and fred.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{so, what did you want to talk to us about?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{i wanted to say i'm sorry.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{for blowing you guys off.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{that's okay, deacon.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{no, it's not. it's just sometimes i feel like the whole world is passing us by and we're just sitting still. i don't know. anyway, i'm sorry.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{you know, you can be a real dick sometimes.}
<A>__{then, fred smiles. deacon knows they're cool with each other.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{naomi and i did it the other night.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{no way!}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{you're kidding, right?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{no, it's true.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{how was it?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{good. at first. but then i kept thinking about all the pornos. trying to hit the right spots, positions. i don't know. after a while it kind of seemed like work.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i find that extremely difficult to believe.}
<A>__{deacon laughs.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{so what now? do we make this thing?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{i don't know. maybe we should just call it quits.}
<C>__{ashley }
<D>__{hey, guys.}
<A>__{ashley walks up to them. she looks hotter than ever, in a tiny midriff shirt and short shorts.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i need you.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i need you to make this movie. for my reel.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{well, actually we were }
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{ooh, look. an eyelash.}
<A>__{for the third time, time stands still as ashley gently pulls the errant eyelash from deacon's eye and offers it up to him.}
<C>__{ashley }
<D>__{make a wish.}
<A>__{deacon is too entranced to close his eyes, but he does take the opportunity to blow the eyelash off her hand. she smiles and brushes back a strand of hair from his brow. the guys are hooked. up through the window, over on deacon's computer, the a.s.s. website is running, featuring roger's smiling face with the motto, "by virgins, for virgins." the counter is on fire.}
