<L>__{exterior long island sound. day, twenty seven years earlier.}
<A>__{a younger looking christof sits in a motorboat in the calm water of long island sound. truman's father, kirk, twenty seven years younger and a dark haired boy, truman's age at the time, acting as a stand in, sit in the stern of a sailing dinghy. two scuba divers in the ocean.}

<P>__{(barking instructions to kirk)}
<D>__{...as soon as we give the cue, tack to windward...}
<A>__{kirk rehearses turning the tiller in the instructed direction.}
<C>__{young christof}
<D>__{the freak wave will strike from the starboard side. remember, you don't go to the diver. the diver goes to you.}
<A>__{to simulate the wave, one of the divers puts his full weight on the side of the dinghy to capsize it. kirk and the boy are tossed into the water. while the boy immediately bobs to the surface in his life jacket, kirk fails to surface. after a long moment, he reappears with the second diver some distance away. now wearing a spare aqualung.}
<C>__{young christof}
<D>__{...good! good!...of course, on the day you only surface once you're safely beyond the cove...try it one more time...you okay?}
<A>__{kirk is staring at truman's stand in, clinging to the upturned boat. kirk's expression suggests he is not a totally willing participant in the masquerade. the present day christof freezes the monitor on kirk's uncertain face.}
