<L>__{interior palladium auditorium day}
<A>__{this once grand theater have been largely gutted seats torn out, fixtures and fittings stripped, curtains ripped from the stage. but still, there's a sense of grandeur to this place. looking out over the stage, a royal box once the most prestigious seat in the house has been converted into an office of sorts. seats removed and replaced by an ornate mahogany desk facing inward, a chandelier suspended above it. the whole set up is gaudy and ostentatious the work of someone who wants to project an aura of power and wealth, but has no taste whatsoever. a tall man is seated in a battered leather armchair behind the desk, deeply involved in an old paperback book. the book's cover is faded and partially torn away, the title still just visible: 7 habits of highly effective people. the man is older than most we've seen. his skin weathered by the elements and by a long life's experience. one of the very few people we've seen in this world close to eli's age and unlike everyone else we've seen, he appears healthy and well groomed. a rich mane of hair, full set of teeth. he wears a tattered suit and tie. none of it matches, everything scavenged from different outfits and eras. but he looks almost civilized. respectable. his name is carnegie. he looks up from his book at the sound of a polite cough o.s. redridge stands before him. tall, powerfully built.}

<D>__{you're going to have to say something. folks were none too happy last time. gonna be worse now, you can count on it.}
