<A>__{the dust is just starting to settle as a thud is heard coming from the hole in the opposite wall. quickly followed by freddy's soaring body. krueger smashes into some tables and slides across the floor. power cop steps through the hole, his fists clenched. freddy stands up and dusts himself off.}

<D>__{lighten up, bone brain.}
<A>__{power cop has no intention to. he bolts over, grabs krueger, raises him over his head like a wrestler, slams him down on the bar, and shoves freddy, knocking glasses and ashtrays aside until he smacks into yet another poor wall. krueger barely gets back on his feet when power cop is right on him again. the big man in black swings, but this time freddy ducks. crack! a support column bursts into dust. freddy twirls around. and the two of them start to punch each other. it's a barroom brawl between non humans as power cop and freddy krueger exchange multiple blows. smack smack smack! freddy nails power cop, whose head barely seems to budge from the hits. pow pow pow! power cop lays into krueger, sending him spinning and tumbling only to pick him up and start the process all over again. this goes on for a while, and krueger is losing. the mutant bouncer finally steps up to power cop to try and put a stop to all this.}
<C>__{mutant bouncer}
<D>__{take it outside!}
<A>__{crunch! power cop puts a stop to the bouncer with a vicious elbow in the chest. all this gave freddy a few seconds to grab a chair and crack it ineffectually over the cop's head. the pummeling begins again. thwack thwack thwack! power cop is punching freddy towards the door.}
