<D>__{dead on all channels.}
<A>__{ripley watches the drop ship being loaded. a cross between a huey aircobra gunship and the space shuttle might describe it. an orbit to surface troop carrier, heavily armed for the close support of ground missions. she watches a six wheeled apc, armored personnel carrier, being raised hydraulically into the ship's belly. ripley looks around as frost wheels a rack of incomprehensible equipment toward her.}
<C>__{frost}
<D>__{clear, please.}
<A>__{ripley jumps aside, nodding apologetically. she turns. steps hastily back. hudson cruises by with a laden forklift.}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{angle on apone standing with hicks, as ripley approaches him}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i feel like a fifth wheel here. is there anything i can do?}
<C>__{apone}
<D>__{i don't know. is there anything you can do?}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{i can drive that loader. i've got a class two rating. my latest career move.}
<A>__{apone turns. a second power loader sits unused in an equipment bay. two shot apone and hicks skeptical. considering. tight on power switch as ripley's finger punches it on. a rising whine of power. tight on the hydraulics as the massive machine stirs to life. full, as the loader starts. ripley is strapped into the safety cage, her arms and legs inserted in the servo sensor assemblies. she takes a step. boom! two tons of hardened steel takes a step. ripley spins the wrist servos. the huge claws swing, open...slide smoothly into lifting brackets on a cargo module, nearby. she raises it deftly.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{where you want it?}
<A>__{hicks looks at apone, cocks an eyebrow appreciatively.}
