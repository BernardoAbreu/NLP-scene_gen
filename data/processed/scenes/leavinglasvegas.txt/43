<L>__{interior ben's house night}
<A>__{ben opens his eyes. the only light comes from the tv. the miles davis record has got caught on a scratch and is repeating the sane phrase over and over again. he looks at his gold rolex and then fingers the wedding band on his finger.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior ben's bar. la night}
<A>__{ben is sitting at the bar. he drinks a large glass of something very quickly and then immediately orders another. he drinks this a little slower but still too quick, finishes it and then orders another. he looks around the bar and sees a woman sitting by herself, thirtyish, pretty and receptive. she looks and sees ben, and he smiles at her. she smiles right back. ben talks across the bar.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(charming)}
<D>__{good evening.}
<C>__{pretty woman}
<P>__{(pleased)}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'm benjamin...ben.}
<C>__{pretty woman}
<D>__{i'm teri.}
<A>__{ben walks over to where she is. she is pleased that this good looking man has come over to make a play. she makes a noise with her straw to indicate that her glass is empty.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i will get you another one... and me too. mind if i join you?}
<A>__{she watches him walk to the bar. he gets the drink and walks back to her. he sets the drinks down on the table and sits down. as he does so, his face gets close to hers and she smells the booze on him.}
<C>__{pretty woman}
<D>__{wow... been drinking all day?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{but of course.}
<A>__{she looks at him, a disappointed expression on her face. she is no longer interested in being seduced by this man and this much is clear to ben.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{why don't we finish these and go to my apartment on the beach?}
<A>__{she doesn't respond.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{we can watch a movie and i will mix you up a gooey blender drink.}
<A>__{ben winces at his own words. he shakes his head.}
<C>__{pretty woman}
<D>__{i have to get up pretty early tomorrow. i will just finish this and go. thanks anyway.}
<A>__{they drink in silence for a while. ben takes a deep breath.0}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(pathetic)}
<D>__{i really wish that you'd come home with me. you're so cute and i'm really good in bed... believe me... you smell good too...}
<A>__{he stops and frowns as he stares into his empty glass.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no, ok.}
<A>__{ben tries to stand and has to pull himself up by holding the bar. it's a strange thing with drunks like ben... when they're up they have balance and timing, but when they're down it all falls apart. she starts to speak but then doesn't. a look of great sadness comes over her.}
<C>__{pretty woman}
<D>__{i have to go now. thanks anyway.}
<A>__{she stands to go.}
<C>__{pretty woman}
<D>__{maybe you shouldn't drink so much.}
<A>__{she walks to the door and ben turns to the bar, watched by he barman, who is a little concerned.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{maybe i shouldn't breathe so much, teri. ha... ha.}
<C>__{barman}
<P>__{(sever voice)}
<D>__{time to go, buddy... we're closing up.}
<A>__{ben gets out his wallet but his hands are shaking so much that he cannot extract any bills. he is very embarrassed and tries again, but to no avail.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{would you... ?}
<A>__{the barman shakes his head in disgust as he goes into the wallet and takes some money.}
