<L>__{exterior broadway}
<A>__{the squad car comes down broadway at speed.}
<L>__{exterior duffy's square}
<A>__{sidney is walking across the square. the squad car appears in foreground; it pauses hardly at all as kello slips out of it, and starts to move after sidney. then the car accelerates round duffy square to cut sidney off on the other side.}
<B>__{sidney}
<A>__{sidney comes up towards camera. seeing something ahead, he halts...}
<B>__{squad car}
<A>__{from sidney's viewpointerior the car breaks to a stop. it's door opens and a detective gets out slowly. it is phil.}
<B>__{resume sidney}
<A>__{sidney is framed in foreground, the squad car beyond. sidney knows what this means. he starts to speak before he turns to look over his shoulder.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{hello, harry...}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{kello, moving silently up behind sidney, slows down, amused at sidney's prescience.}
<C>__{kello}
<D>__{hi!}
<P>__{(coming to join sidney)}
<D>__{i just been on the phone to j.j.}
<A>__{kello's manner is almost affectionate. he shakes his head, admonishing sidney.}
<C>__{kello}
<P>__{(mildly)}
<D>__{you been a bad boy, sidney. j.j.'s going to write about you in his column tomorrow.}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{shooting across kello onto sidney. sidney's smile is tired.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i thought he would.}
<C>__{kello}
<D>__{yeah...}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{and another thing he's gonna say you 'resisted arrest'...}
<P>__{(as sidney nods)}
<D>__{you know j.j....!}
<A>__{sidney turns away to look back towards phil. then, taking kello totally by surprise, he wheels, striking the cop viciously across the mouth.}
<B>__{kello}
<A>__{kello's head jerks back. recovering at once, he guffaws, lurches into camera with a sudden vicious movement. there is a sharp guttural cry over scene.}
<B>__{longer angle}
<A>__{phil runs forward towards the figures of sidney and kello seen beyond him. in doing so, he blocks the view so that we do not clearly see the violence with which kello strikes sidney down. phil, in foreground, is seen to relax. when he moves aside, clearing the view, sidney is writhing on the ground at kello's feet.}
<B>__{closer angle}
<A>__{kello wipes his knuckles on his handkerchief. he signals to phil to help lift the body at his feet. phil enters shot and they raise sidney, half carrying, half dragging him out of shot.}
<B>__{long shot}
<A>__{the cops carry the figure of sidney falco across duffy square; they bundle him into the police car. the pigeons in the square, circle. hunsecker's terrace camera looks down towards duffy square in the distance. the police car can be seen moving off, circling the square and disappearing southward on broadway. camera pulls back to include hunsecker in foreground.}
<B>__{hunsecker}
<A>__{a close shot, shooting sharply upward at hunsecker. he looks down, quiet impassively, and there is a slightly insane grandeur, a paranoiac superiority in the way that he turns back, dismissing sidney from his thoughts.}
