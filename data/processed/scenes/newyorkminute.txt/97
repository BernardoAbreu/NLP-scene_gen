<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you're the one all 'i gotta get to this interview or i'm gonna have a nervous breakdown' and yet you have time to address the united nations?}
<C>__{warren}
<D>__{you know, technically, you have to have security clearance to enter the assembly.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{not now, warren.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{you have a lot of nerve, parker. it was you that got me tossed off the train! you had to give the bum that dollar! you get the suit, i get the leather bikini!}

<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i told you, i didn't know you liked him! it was no big deal!}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{it was to me!}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{how could i know? you never tell me anything!}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{there's a good reason for that!}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{you know very well what it means, ms. big mouth!}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{big mouth?! ooh, i hope you miss that stupid interview!}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{oh yeah? well, the joke's on you, because there isn't any interview!}
<A>__{oops. this just slipped out in anger. parker's brain has to adjust, then:}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{no interview. i screwed up.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you screwed up what?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{scheduling the interview. you deaf?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you're drew. drew doesn't screw anything up, let alone scheduling. you're the iron chef of scheduling.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i missed the deadline.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{after they made the first cut from the preliminary application, we were supposed to send in a form to secure our interview time and i filled it out and had everything ready to go in the mailbox and then...}
<A>__{drew is near tears.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{and then what? earthquake? tsunami? nuclear winter?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i forgot.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{forgot?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{yes. i just forgot. when i found it in my bag a week later, i'd missed the deadline.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{so today? all this? what are you doing?}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(humiliated)}
<D>__{i... i was going to try to meet professor spaulding and...}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you were just going to jump him?}
<C>__{warren}
<D>__{sort of a guerilla interview? you know, i'm a big michael moore fan...}
<A>__{a look from parker quiets warren. drew's choked up. she just nods, yes.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i called and the secretary said there were no exceptions to the deadline so i was going to try to see him when he finished the other interviews. i knew it was hopeless, but... i was so... embarrassed.}
<A>__{drew wipes her tears, then:}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{oh, to hell with it.}
<A>__{she opens the door and jumps out!}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{drew?! drew, get back in this taxi!}
<A>__{parker starts to open her door on the traffic side! honk honk! it's nearly sheared off by a passing truck and she closes it just in time.}
<C>__{warren}
<D>__{she's pretty upset.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{gee, you really are a genius.}
<A>__{as the taxi bogs down in traffic, drew disappears around the corner up ahead.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{talk about spontaneous.}
