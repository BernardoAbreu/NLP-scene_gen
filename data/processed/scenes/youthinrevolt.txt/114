<A>__{a rowdy cafeteria. lefty and nick dine in the corner. nick has an open french textbook as he tries to decipher sheeni's letter. an indian boy, vijay joshi, 16, makes his way to them.}
<C>__{vijay}
<D>__{may i sit at your table?}
<C>__{lefty}
<D>__{sure. i'm lefty and this is nick.}
<C>__{vijay}
<D>__{i am vijay joshi.}
<A>__{vijay sits and shakes their hands.}
<C>__{vijay}
<D>__{i see you both have been rejected by the socially elite of our school. ukiah is a cultural wasteland compared to india. though some of the girls are very attractive.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{do you have a girlfriend?}
<C>__{vijay}
<D>__{not at the moment. but i am optimistic. how about you?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{yes, but she transferred.}
<C>__{vijay}
<D>__{you don't mean sheeni saunders. i heard she was interested in some brilliant fellow in the bay area.}
<C>__{lefty}
<D>__{hey, that's you, nick.}
<C>__{vijay}
<D>__{i'm surprised. you are not at all what i imagined.}
<A>__{nick narrows his eyes.}
<C>__{vijay}
<D>__{so how is sheeni?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i don't know. she sent me this letter. but it's in french.}
<C>__{vijay}
<D>__{shall i translate it for you?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you speak french?}
<C>__{vijay}
<D>__{i speak french, english, hindi, marathi, and urdu.}
<C>__{lefty}
<D>__{that must come in handy.}
<A>__{nick hands over the letter and vijay starts reading it silently. he chuckles as he reads and nick squints his eyes at him in annoyance. vijay picks up on it, clears his throat and reads aloud.}
<C>__{vijay}
<D>__{dear, nick...}
