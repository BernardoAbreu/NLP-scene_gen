<L>__{exterior city street nighttime}
<A>__{charly stalks the city streets. a quartet sings, "god rest ye merry," ostensibly about joy, oddly the most depressing tune ever written. on a crowded street, she is alone. total misfit. searches her own haggard features in a shop window. swallows hard, whispers:}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{easy, baby. she ain't coming back, no way. bitch is dead.}
<A>__{she bustles down a sidestreet, hands jammed in her pockets. that's when a tall bearded man crosses the street and falls in alongside.}
<C>__{bearded man}
<D>__{good evening.}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{fuck off.}
<C>__{bearded man}
<D>__{i see me a good looking lady, all upset, i wonder if she doesn't need some male company.}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{forget it. i'm saving myself 'til i get raped.}
<A>__{his hand edges out of his windbreaker with a snubnosed .38.}
<C>__{bearded man}
<D>__{step into the alley, honey. i ain't asking, i'm telling.}
<A>__{charly stops walking. regards him the way you or i might look at a telephone cord. groans:}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{oh, don't tell me. you're early, goddammit, you're supposed to be at the pay phone. go away and come back at midnight. i'm not ready yet. got a light?}
<A>__{the guy stares, mouth working.}
<C>__{bearded man}
<D>__{lady, i have a gun!}
<A>__{which is precisely when a much larger smith and wesson cocks next to his ear:}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{this ain't no ham on rye, pal.}
<A>__{henessey holds the gun rock steady in his big fist. charly spins on him, eyes flashing:}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing here?}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{saving your life. woulda got here sooner but i was thinking up the sandwich line.}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{you think i couldn't take him? idiot, you probably scared the other guy away }
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{what other guy ?}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{headhunters, nimrod, they go in pairs, were you always this stupid or did you take lessons?}
<C>__{henessey}
<D>__{i took lessons.}
<A>__{the hitman watches, bewildered. considers waving to get their attention. finally he can't stand it. blurts out:}
<C>__{bearded man}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{charly snaps her head toward him:}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{bearded man}
<D>__{i still got this fucking gun!}
<A>__{she smiles sweetly.}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{no, you don't.}
<A>__{takes it off him. just like that. he stares dumbly at his empty hand. half of his trigger finger is missing.}
<C>__{bearded man}
<D>__{shiiiit!!}
<A>__{charly flips the gun into the air. launches a spin kick. shatters his jaw. catapults him backwards. completes her spin, catlike catches the .38 on its way down. doesn't stop there. arm out, gun cocked fires. straight at henessey, what...? he dives aside behind him, a second hitman. blown to tatters. the knife meant for henessey arcs through the air... imbeds itself in the ground an inch from the prone detective. he stares at it with shocked eyes. the killer hits, dead. twitches. charly. lowers her arm slowly. gun barrel smoking.}
<C>__{charly}
<D>__{fuck you. just fuck all of you.}
