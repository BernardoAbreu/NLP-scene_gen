<L>__{interior diner, booth graham + crawford day}
<A>__{graham is staring into the black deep recesses of his coffee. crawford is looking at him. finally:}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{...snuck in the hospital while i was sedated, flipped back the sheets and shot pictures. the only decent thing he did was run a black square over my balls...}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{i know...}
<A>__{graham looks away. then he lights another cigarette.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(back to business)}
<D>__{atlanta and birmingham can run the thumb print against known sex offenders. five will get you ten they don't come up with an identification. jimmie may in the finder program... if he's ever been printed and in his index.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{say we've arrested a good suspect. you walk in and see him. what is there about him that doesn't surprise you?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i don't know, jack. he's got no face for me.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{you can tell something about him or we wouldn't have found the finger printerior ..}
<C>__{graham.}
<D>__{don't expect too much from me, jack, all right?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{we'll get him one way or the other.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{what's one way?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{we find an event that connects both families. same vacation hotel; same hospital, different times. then we check employees and come up with a male nurse, hairdresser, whatever...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{if we find out how he found them, then we'll find him.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{we're running it through the computers now. so far there's no event or service that doubles back into both families. plus they were big consumers: snowmobiles, fishing trips, scuba, videogames, lots of routine medical and dental. it's a haystack.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what's the other?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{he makes noise going in and the husband gets to a gun in time.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{no other possibilities?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{you think i'm gonna spot him 'across a crowded room?' that's ezio pinza you're thinking about.}
<C>__{graham }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the tooth fairy will go on until we get smart or get lucky. he won't stop.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{because he has a genuine taste for it, jack.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{see? you do know something about him.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(long stare at crawford; then)}
<D>__{... i'm going to see lecter.}
<A>__{crawford's cup of coffee stops in front of his mouth:}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{for christ's sake, why?}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(matter of fact)}
<D>__{to recover the mind set.}
