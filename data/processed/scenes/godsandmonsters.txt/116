<L>__{interior whale's house living room day}
<A>__{a roar of bells blasts clay awake. the telephone is ringing. a hard pair of shoes thunder out to answer it.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{hello? oh, mr. david!}
<A>__{clay blinks at the sight of hanna in black dress and white apron, chattering on the phone by the far wall.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{no, no, he did not tell me. but no problem. i will make breakfast.}
<A>__{she scoldingly cuts her eyes at clay.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{ten? very good, then. good bye.}
<A>__{she hangs up and faces clay with a stern frown.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{it's not what you think.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{i have brought you your clothes. all i ask is that you get dressed and go. we are having a guest for breakfast.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i need to talk to you about mr. whale.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{there is nothing you can say that will surprise me.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{maybe. but i still need to talk. do i have time for a cup of coffee before i go?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{i blame my daughter for keeping me out so late. i only hope you did not get him excited. it could give him a new stroke.}
<A>__{she stomps into the kitchen. clay gets up, slips on his undershorts. he's zipping up his chinos when she comes out again with a breakfast tray. she hands him a cup of coffee.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{thanks.}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{why do you do it?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{what do i do?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{take care of mr. whale like he was your flesh and blood.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{it is my job. i did it when he was happy and it was easy. it is only fair i do it now when he is ill.}
<P>__{(picks up the tray)}
<D>__{enough talk. i must wake up the master.}
<A>__{she marches around the corner towards whale's bedroom. clay hears her knocking on a door.}
<C>__{hanna }
<D>__{mr. jimmy? morning, mr. jimmy.}
<A>__{clay pulls on his shirt. hanna comes back around the corner.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{what have you done with him?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i put him to bed. he's not there?}
<A>__{she goes to the foot of the stairs and shouts:}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{mr. jimmy! mr. jimmy!}
<A>__{hanna starts up the stairs.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{look for him!}
<A>__{clay reaches for his socks when he notices an envelope on the floor next to the chair. he picks it up. on the front is scrawled the word 'clayton'. clay opens the envelope. inside is whale's original sketch of the monster's head. he turns it over. there is a message written on the back.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{clay drops the sketch, looks out. he sees something.}
