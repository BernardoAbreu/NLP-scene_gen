<L>__{interior emily's cubicle day}
<A>__{the hurried opening and closing of files reveals photos of abused children. bruises. cuts. broken bones. emily trying to locate a single case amid the stacks and clutter on her desk. an angry mother screaming at her on the phone:}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{no one is trying to steal your child, they found bruises and cigarette burns mrs lynch, i read the medical report well, if you feel you need legal representation that's perfectly within your rights...}
<A>__{a flurry of obscenities followed by a dial tone. emily puts the phone down. sighs wearily.}
<C>__{wayne }
<D>__{one less christmas card for emily.}
<A>__{her supervisor wayne, forties, gay, leaning in the doorway.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{how many active cases you have?}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{thirty eight.}
<A>__{he drops another file on her desk.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{no, absolutely not, look at this, wayne, look, i'm buried }
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{sorry, em, we all are.}
<A>__{he walks off. emily shoves the new file onto the shelf above her desk. looks at it guiltily. takes it down again. handwritten on the front: sheridan, lucy. she opens it. a school portrait of ten year old lucy clipped to the preliminary report. the sad face draws emily in.}
