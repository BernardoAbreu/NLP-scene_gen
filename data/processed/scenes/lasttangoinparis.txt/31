<L>__{interior apt. building living room day}
<A>__{we are back at paul's new place. jeanne wanders the room topless but covering her breasts with a pillow. she continues to wax nostalgic about her father.}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{the colonel had green eyes and shiny boots. i worshipped him. he was so handsome in his uniform.}
<C>__{paul's voice}
<D>__{what a steaming pile of horseshit.}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{pissed, she throws the pillow she was covering her ample breast with at paul. we now see paul is lounging on his mattress, pant legs rolled up past his knees, toying with a harmonica and drinking from a wooden cup.}
<C>__{jeanne }
<D>__{what? don't...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{all uniforms are bullshit. everything outside this place is bullshit. besides, i don't want to hear about your stories, about your past, and all that.}
<C>__{jeanne}

<C>__{paul}
<D>__{or 68 or 28 or 98...}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{58, and don't joke about things like that.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{listen, why don't you stop talking about things that don't matter here? what the hell's the difference?}
<B>__{dialogue switches to english}

<A>__{she huffs over to the other side of the room, crossing her arms, pouting.}
<C>__{jeanne }

<C>__{jeanne's voice}
<D>__{why don't you go back in america?}
<A>__{he stops playing the tune.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i don't know. bad memories, i guess.}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{of what?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{oh... my father was a... a drunk. tough. whore fucker, bar fighter. super masculine. and he was tough. my mother was very... very poetic. and also a drunk. and... one of my memories, when i was a kid, was of her being arrested nude. we lived in this small town. farming community. we lived on a farm. and i'd come home after school and she'd be gone. in jail... or something. and... i used to... i used to have to milk a cow every morning and every night and i liked that. i remember...}
<A>__{an irish country jig plays over the monologue.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{one time i was all dressed up to go out and take this girl to a basketball game. and i started to go out and my father said, "you have to milk the cow." i said, "would you please milk it for me?" and he said, "no, get your ass out there." so i went out and i was in a hurry and didn't have time to change my shoes. and i had cow shit all over my shoes. and on the way to the basketball game, it smelled in the car. i don't know. i i can't remember very many good things.}
<C>__{jeanne's voice}
<D>__{not one?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yeah. some. there was a farmer, a very nice guy. old guy, very poor, and worked real hard. i used to work in a ditch, draining land for farming. and he wore overalls and he smoked a clay pipe. half the time he wouldn't put tobacco in it. and i hated the work. it was hot and dirty and... it broke my back. and... all day long i'd watch his spit which would run down the pipe stem and hang on the bowl of the pipe. and i used to make bets with myself on when it was going to fall off. and i always lost. i never saw it fall off. i'd just look around and it'd be gone and then the new one would be there. and then we had a beautiful... my mother... my mother taught me to love nature. and... i guess that was the most she could do. and... we had... in front of our house we had this big field... meadow. it was a mustard field in the summer and we had a big black dog named dutchy. and she used to hunt for rabbits in that field but she couldn't see them. so she'd have to leap up in this mustard field and look around very quickly to see where the rabbits were. and it was... very beautiful. and she never caught the rabbits.}
<A>__{jeanne looks up from the bed, mischievously.}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{you have been had!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{oh really?}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{i don't wanna know anything about your past, baby!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you think i was telling you the truth?}
<A>__{jeanne flaps her arms. paul twills his eyebrows in response.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{maybe... maybe...}
<A>__{jeanne climbs on the bed with the top sheet like a lioness stalking her prey.}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{i'm a red riding hood and you're the wolf.}
<A>__{she covers him up with the sheet. then she uncovers his arm.}
<C>__{jeanne }
<D>__{what strong arms you have!}
<A>__{she sniffs his arm. paul plays along.}

<A>__{he talks funny as jeanne holds on to his tounge.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{the better to... to stick in your rear, my dear.}
<A>__{she makes her way down to his crotch, uncovering the sheet as she goes. she regards his private area.}
<C>__{jeanne}

<C>__{paul}
<D>__{did you have fun as a kid?}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{it's the most beautiful thing.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it's beautiful to be made into a tattletale or forced to admire authority or sell yourself for a piece of candy.}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{i wasn't like that.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{i was writing poems. i was drawing castles,... big castles with tower. a lot of tower.}

<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{my first love was my cousin paul.}
<A>__{paul explodes.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no! i'm gonna get a hemorrhoid if you keep telling me names. no names. i don't mind if you tell the truth, but don't give me the names.}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{sorry. sorry.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{well, go on. tell the truth. what else?}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{i was ... he was dark, very thin. i can see him. big nose! a big romance. i fell in love with him when i heard him playing piano.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you mean when he first got into your knickers.}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{he was a child prodigy. he was playing with both hands.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i will bet he was... probably getting his kicks.}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{we were dying of heat.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{oh, yeah. good excuse. what else?}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{in the afternoon, when the grown ups were napping...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you started grabbing his jointerior}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{you're crazy!}

<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{no, i'm not.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{look me straight in the face and say, "he didn't touch me once." huh?}
<A>__{she smiles.}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{he touched me, but the way he did it.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{aha! the way he did it. ok, what did he do?}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{behind the house, there were two trees. a plane tree and a chestnut. i sat under the plane tree and he sat under the chestnut. and one, two, three... we each began to masturbate. the first who came... won!}
<A>__{paul is suddenly lost in his thoughts. he wanders to the wall, leans on it and studies his harmonica.}
<C>__{jeanne }
<D>__{why aren't you listening to me?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{when did you first come? how old were you?}
<C>__{jeanne}
<D>__{the first time? i was really late for school. i started running and it was downhill. all of a sudden, i felt a strong sensation here. so i ran and ran and i came as i ran. the faster i ran, the better it was and the more i came. a couple of days later, i tried to do it again, but no luck.}
<A>__{paul climbs a tripod that is leaning against the wall.}
<C>__{jeanne }
<D>__{why aren't you listening to me?}
<A>__{he takes the pin out and it comes apart. he falls back.}
<C>__{jeanne }
<D>__{why do i feel like i'm talking to a brick wall when i talk to you? your solitude weighs on me. it isn't indulgent. it isn't generous. you are selfish!}
<A>__{he finally looks at her.}
<C>__{jeanne }
<D>__{i can be by myself, too, you know!}
<B>__{drum music starts as...}
<A>__{he smiles, twirls a drum stick, puts his harmonica on her head and goes into the next room. she throws the harmonica on the floor in disgust. as he fiddle farts around the apartment, jeanne masturbates.}
<C>__{dining room}
<A>__{paul is reunited with his small lamp shade. he puts it over his face and cries into it.}
<C>__{living room}
<A>__{jeanne has cum. she rolls off the mattresses onto the floor,}
