<A>__{an explosion rocks the ship as two robots, artoo detoo (r2 d2) and see threepio (c 3po) struggle to make their way through the shaking, bouncing passageway. both robots are old and battered. artoo is a short, claw armed tripod. his face is a mass of computer lights surrounding a radar eye. threepio, on the other hand, is a tall, slender robot of human proportions. he has a gleaming bronze like metallic surface of an art deco design. another blast shakes them as they struggle along their way.}
