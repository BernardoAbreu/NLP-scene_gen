It is almost as through the reptiles of the island are reacting to the countdown as they anxiously move about. Suddenly with a brilliant FLASH OF WHITE LIGHT, a nuclear EXPLOSION mushrooms into the sky. We SEE a SERIES of REAL shots of footage of some of the over one hundred and sixty official nuclear tests the French government held in this tropical region. Explosion after explosion devastates the locale. One building after the next, accelerating in momentum, culminating in one final EXPLOSION. The clould-filled sky begins to drizzle. The ash-like fallout drifts downward onto what's left of the islands below. We FOLLOW this ash as it settles next to a dead reptile, unrecognizable now, and down onto what's left of the lizard's eggs. Suddenly the image clears from the grainy footage to clean, modern high resolution. We ZOOM IN on one of the eggs as it slowly gets buried in the falling ash.
