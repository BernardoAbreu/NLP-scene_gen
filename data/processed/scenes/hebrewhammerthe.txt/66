<L>__{exterior the golden menorah day}
<A>__{your typical blaxploitation bar. it could easily pass for the lenox lounge in harlem, with the exception of the large menorah shaped sign out front.}
<L>__{interior the golden menorah continuous}
<A>__{we see a bar packed with orthodox jews. a wall separating the men and women in the bar runs along the center of the room, stopping about ten feet from the stage. signs clearly demarcate these 'men' and 'women' sections. onstage, a klezmer band plays a rendition of a to be determined 70's funk classic. esther and the hammer enter the jointerior mid song, the bandleader notices the two walk in...}
<C>__{bandleader}
<D>__{hey! the hebrew hammer everybody!}
<A>__{the hammer raises his hand in acknowledgment. the entire bar cheers and applauds. hammer escorts esther to a table on the woman's side of the wall, and then walks around to the other side of the divider where he takes a seat opposite the wall from her. the band begins a rousing version of "hava nagila." a good majority of the men in the bar rush to the dance floor and begin dancing zealously with one another. esther shouts over the wall in an attempt to overcome the din of the bar.}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{so, do you come here often!?}
<A>__{the hammer struggles to hear. he shouts back to her.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{what was that!?}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{i said, do you come here often!?}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{oh. yeah, about once a week!}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{what!?}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{i said, yeah, about once a week!}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{oh!}
<A>__{a hasidic bar patron approaches the hammer and smiles.}
<C>__{hasidic bar patron}
<D>__{would you like to dance?}
<A>__{we get another shot of the men dancing together, arm in arm, on the dance floor.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{i'm okay right now. thanks though.}
<A>__{as the patron leaves, joshua, another hasidic man standing directly behind him takes his place at the hammer's table.}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{hey morty, wanna cut a rug?}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{nah, i'm good. i'm kind of here with somebody.}
<A>__{the hammer motions to the wall. joshua looks as if his feelings are hurt.}
<C>__{joshua}
<D>__{oh. okay. maybe next time.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{yeah. maybe next time joshua. take it easy.}
<A>__{as joshua leaves, we get a wider shot of the hammer's table. a long line of men leads up to it. chaim feygele, an effeminate slick hasidic man, chest hair spilling out of his loosely buttoned butterfly collar shirt, neck dripping with gold chains, steps up to the hammer. he's got a huge phoney smile plastered across his face.}
<C>__{chaim feygele}
<D>__{well shalom there mister!}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{do we know each other?}
<C>__{chaim feygele}
<D>__{no, but we have mutual friends.}
<A>__{chaim points to the dance floor. another shot of men dancing with one another, arm in arm.}
<C>__{chaim feygele }
<D>__{the name's feygele. chaim feygele.}
<A>__{this guy is clearly making the hammer nervous.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{mordechai. my friends call me morty.}
<C>__{chaim feygele}
<D>__{so morty, i just love a man in a black suit. care to dance.}
<A>__{mordechai is flustered.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{uhhh. you know, i...have to go to the bathroom. i will be right back.}
<A>__{the hammer gets up quickly and leaves. we cut to esther's side of the wall. the hammer walks behind her while she checks out the band on stage.}
<C>__{hammer }
<D>__{hey there.}
<A>__{she turns around, pleasantly surprised.}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{hammer}
<D>__{do you want to get out of here?}
<A>__{she looks relieved.}
<C>__{esther}
<D>__{i would love to get out of here.}
