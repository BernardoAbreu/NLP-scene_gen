<L>__{int day: don's office (1955)}
<A>__{view on don corleone, much older, much smaller in size. he wears baggy pants, and a warm plaid shirt. he sits in a chair, gazing out through the window, into the garden.}
<C>__{tessio }
<D>__{barzini's people chisel my territory and we do nothing about it. pretty soon there won't be one place in brooklyn i can hang my hat.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{just be patient.}
<C>__{tessio}
<D>__{i'm not asking you for help, mike. just take off the handcuffs.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{be patient.}
<C>__{clemenza }
<D>__{we gotta fight sometime. let us at least recruit our regimes to full strength.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{no, i don't want to give barzini an excuse to start fighting.}
<C>__{tessio }
<D>__{mike, you're wrong.}
<C>__{clemenza }
<D>__{don corleone...don corleone.}
<A>__{the old man looks up. clemenza stand before him in the den. beside him is an anxious tessio. neri stands by the door; hagen is seated; michael sits behind the big desk.}
<C>__{clemenza}
<D>__{you said there would come a day when tessio and me could form our own families. only with your benediction, of course. i ask permission...}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{my son is head of the family now. if you have his permission, you have my good will.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{in six months you can break off from the corleone family and go on your own. carlo, i'm counting on you to make the move to nevada; you'll be my right hand man out there. tom hagen is no longer the consigliere.}
<A>__{everyone is a bit surprised; look to see hagen's reaction. he remains inexpressive.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{he's going to be our lawyer in vegas. nobody goes to him with any other business as of now, this minute. no reflection on tom; that's the way i want it. besides, if i ever need any advice, who's a better consigliere than my father.}
<C>__{clemenza}
<D>__{then in a six month time we're on our own; is that it?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{maybe less...}
<C>__{tessio}
<D>__{let us fill up our regimes.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no. i want things very calm for another six months.}
<C>__{tessio}
<D>__{forgive me, godfather, let our years of friendship be my excuse. how can you hope for success there without your strength here to back you up? the two go hand in hand. and with you gone from here the barzini and the tattaglias will be too strong for us.}
<C>__{clemenza}
<D>__{and i don't like barzini. i say the corleone family has to move from strength, not weakness. we should build our regimes and take back our lost territories in staten island, at least.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{do you have faith in my judgement?}
<C>__{clemenza}
<D>__{yes, godfather...}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{then do what michael says...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{all i can say is that things are being resolved that are more effective than a thousand buttonmen on the streets. understood?}
<A>__{there are uneasy looks all around.}
<C>__{carlo}
<D>__{understood. i just wish i was doing more to help out.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i will come to you when i need you.}
<A>__{he looks at clemenza, tessio and hagen. they all nod, reluctantly.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{all right, then it's resolved.}
<A>__{neri knows the meeting is over, he opens the den's door. clemenza and tessio pay their respects to the don and leave, then carlo. neri watches carlo as he walks down the corridor, casting a nervous look back at the sinister man. then neri closes the door. michael relaxes.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{mike, why are you cutting me out of the action?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{tom, we're going to be legitimate all the way, and you're the legal man. what could be more important than that.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{i'm not talking about that. i'm talking about rocco lampone building a secret regime. why does neri report directly to you, rather than through me or a caporegime?}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{i told you that it wouldn't escape his eye.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{how did you find out?}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{bookkeepers know everything. rocco's men are all a little too good for the jobs they're supposed to be doing. they get a little more money than the job's worth.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{lampone's a good man; he's operating perfectly.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{not so perfectly if you noticed.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{mike, why am i out?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you're not a wartime consigliere. things may get tough with the move we're trying.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{ok, but then i agree with tessio. you're going about it all wrong; you're making the move out of weakness... barzini's a wolf, and if he tears you apart, the other families won't come running to help the corleones...}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{tom, i never thought you were a bad consigliere, i thought santino a bad don, rest in peace. he had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when i had my misfortune. michael has all my confidence, as you do. for reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{maybe i can help.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{you're out, tom.}
<A>__{tom pauses, thinks...and then he nods in acquiescence. tom leaves. michael looks at neri.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i'm going to talk to my father.}
<A>__{neri nods, and then leaves. the don opens the doors, breathes in the air, and steps outside.}
