<A>__{white looks at the inspector street lights pass over his features. bumstead stares at the road.}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{i didn't tell you the entire reason i helped you. it started with two little girls. twins. used to play with them when i was young. couldn't remember for the life of me what they looked like, then i understood why...}
<A>__{he looks at the dashboard, brushes away a small piece of linterior}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{they didn't have faces.}

<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{why, that's ridiculous. you just...}
<A>__{he trails off. shakes his head slowly.}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{we'll get to the bottom of this. i mean it.}
