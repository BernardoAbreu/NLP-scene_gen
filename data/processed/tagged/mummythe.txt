<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{two questions. who the hell is seti the first? and was he rich?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{he was the last pharaoh of the old kingdom, said to be the wealthiest pharaoh of them all.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{alright, good, that's good. i like this fellow, like him very much.}
<A>__{the curator picks up the map. it's actually the exact same map that we established in the opening scenes of the movie.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i've already dated it, this map is almost four thousand years old. and the hieratics over here...}
<P>__{(inhales deeply)}
<D>__{it's hamunaptra.}
<A>__{the curator freezes, suddenly very nervous, then he recovers.}
<C>__{curator}
<D>__{my dear girl, don't be ridiculous, we are scholars, not treasure hunters. hamunaptra is a myth.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{are we talking about the hamunaptra?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{yes. the city of the dead. where the early pharaohs were said to have hidden the wealth of egypt.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{right, right, in a big underground treasure chamber. everybody knows the story. the entire necropolis was rigged to sink into the sand. on pharaoh's command, a flick of the switch! and the whole place could disappear beneath the dunes.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{all we know is that the city mysteriously vanished around 2,134 b.c.}
<A>__{the curator holds the map closer to the burning candle lamp.}
<C>__{curator}
<D>__{as the americans would say: it's all fairy tales and hokum.}
<A>__{the map 'accidentally,' catches on fire. the curator throws it to the floor. jonathan drops to his knees and quickly puts it out. lifts it up. the left third of the map is now missing.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{you burned it! you burned off the part with the lost city!}
<C>__{curator}
<D>__{it's for the best, i'm sure. many men have wasted their lives in the foolish pursuit of hamunaptra, no one has ever found it, most have never returned.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<P>__{(devastated)}
<D>__{you killed my map.}
<C>__{curator}
<D>__{i'm sure it was a fake, anyway, i'm surprised at you, miss carnarvon, to be so fooled.}
<A>__{the curator reaches for the key box. evelyn quickly snatches it off the desk and gives him a very angry, suspicious look.}
<L>__{exterior cairo prison gallows courtyard day}
<A>__{cairo prison. one of the worst hell holes on earth. every low life form of scumbag can be found here. the warden, a first rate scumbag himself, escorts evelyn and jonathan across the gallows courtyard. evelyn whispers to jonathan.}

<D>__{you told me you found it on a dig down in thebes!}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{i was mistaken.}

<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i'm your sister.}

<D>__{that just makes you more gullible.}

<C>__{warden}
<D>__{he said... he was just looking for a good time.}
<A>__{the interior cell door bursts open. o'connell is in chains, dragged by four guards, they shove him up to the cell bars. from the looks of it, he's been here awhile; his face is half hidden by long hair, a scraggly beard and many new bruises. evelyn looks at him, disgusted by his appearance.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{but he's just a filthy criminal?}
<C>__{jonathan}
<P>__{(cringing)}
<D>__{way to go, evy.}

<D>__{because that's where i found it. i was there.}

<D>__{um, well, you see...}
<A>__{o'connell's fist comes flying through the bars, hits jonathan square in the jaw, decks him. he hits the floor. out cold. a guard clubs o'connell. his head bounces off the bars again. he shows no pain, but gives the guard another nasty look. evelyn looks down at her brother, then back at o'connell.}

<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{then get me the hell outta here.}
<A>__{evelyn is stunned. a guard clubs him, his face bounces off the bars again, but before he can react the guards grab him, yanks him away from the bars and drag him out of the room.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{where are they taking him?}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{to be hanged.}

<C>__{warden}
<D>__{no women allowed.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i am an english woman.}
<A>__{this seems to confuse the warden, he shrugs and sits down. o'connell looks up as evelyn plops down beside the warden.}

<D>__{yeah, i'd like ya to let me go.}

<C>__{warden}
<D>__{and what else?}
<A>__{evelyn is revolted, she quickly shoves his hand away. insulted, the warden angrily turns and gestures to the hangman, who pulls the lever. the trapdoor drops away.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{nooo!}
<A>__{o'connell drops through the hole. the rope pays out. then jerks taught. o'connell's body snaps at the end of the rope. but he's still alive, because }
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{his neck did not break! good! now we watch him strangle to death.}
<A>__{the prisoners go ape shit, screaming and shouting in anger. the guards look around, nervous. o'connell struggles at the end of the rope, gagging. evelyn is horrified, she quickly turns to the warden, leans forward and whispers in his ear.}

<D>__{you lie.}

<D>__{i would never!}
<A>__{at the end of the rope, o'connell is choking and gagging and turning several shades of red. the warden stares at evelyn.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{are you saying this filthy godless son of a pig knows where to find the city of the dead? truly?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{yes and if you cut him down, we will give you ten percent.}

<D>__{give... give him... give him glaaaa !}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{twenty five percent, and not one single farthing more.}
<A>__{the warden flashes a big green smile, then yells in arabic. a scimitar slashes the air. the rope is cut. o'connell crashes to the ground. half dead. rolls over. gagging. all of the prisoners burst into cheers. o'connell looks up at evelyn. she smiles broadly and waves down at him. curator's office night candle light flickers across the curator's face.}
<C>__{curator}
<D>__{she must die.}
<A>__{standing in the shadows across from his desk are three mumia: blue tinted skin, hideous facial tattoos, the works. one of the mumia has a rusty metal hook for a hand. he shrugs.}

<C>__{curator}
<D>__{no! she has seen too much. she knows too much.}
<A>__{the curator leans across his desk, fear in his eyes.}
<C>__{curator}
<D>__{not only does she have a map, but she has the key.}
<A>__{spooks the hell out of the mumia guys.}
<C>__{hook}
<D>__{the key!? she has the lost key!?}
<C>__{curator}
<D>__{yes. no one has ever had so much, been so close. we must stop her, or it will be the end of us all.}
<C>__{hook}
<D>__{then we will kill her, we will kill her and all those with her.}
<C>__{curator}
<D>__{and burn the map and retrieve the key.}
<C>__{hook}
<D>__{it will be done. but what of the american expedition? they leave tomorrow as well.}
<C>__{curator}
<D>__{forget the bumbling americans, they will be like all the others. without the map to guide them, how can they possibly find hamunaptra?}
<L>__{exterior giza port day}
<T>__{smash cut to:}
<A>__{our old traitorous friend beni.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{it is three days down the nile, then two days by camel, sahibs.}
<A>__{we crane back: to reveal beni standing on the bow of a passenger barge. surrounded by daniels, henderson and burns.}
<C>__{daniels}
<D>__{for all the money we're paying you, something better god damned well be under that sand.}
<A>__{we keep craning back: as henderson slaps daniels on the back.}
<C>__{henderson}
<D>__{"hamunaptra," daniels, that's all ya gotta keep sayin, to yourself, "hamunaptra."}
<A>__{now we see all of giza port: team of explorers swarm the docks. across the nile, the pyramids spike the sky. evelyn and jonathan walk along the boardwalk besieged by hawkers selling everything from toy tombs to king tut action figures.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{do you really think he'll show up?}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{undoubtedly, i know the breed, he may be a cowboy, but his word is his word.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{personally, i think he's filthy, rude and a complete scoundrel. i don't like him one bit.}
<C>__{o'connell }
<D>__{anyone i know?}
<A>__{they both turn. o'connell walks up; shaved, showered, spit and polished, with a new haircut and clothes. he looks more dashing and handsome than ever. evelyn is suitably impressed.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{oh... um,... hello.}
<A>__{jonathan grabs o'connell's arm and shakes his hand.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{smashing day for the start of an adventure, eh, o'connell?}
<A>__{o'connell quickly checks his pockets.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{yeah, sure, smashing.}
<A>__{he finds his wallet and relaxes. directly above him: on the bow of the barge, burns wipes his bifocals and turns to beni.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{you're sure hamunaptra is out there?}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{along with the scorched bones of my entire garrison, sahib.}
<A>__{and that's when beni spots o'connell. beni shakes his head, as if seeing a mirage, then starts backing away from the men.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{a thousand pardons, my good sahibs but there is much work to be done.}
<A>__{beni quickly scurries off, vanishing down into the hold. back down with: evelyn, recovering, she clears her throat.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{mister o'connell, can you look me in the eye, and guarantee me this is not some sort of flimflam? because if it is, i'm warning you }
<A>__{o'connell steps up close to evelyn, invading her space looks her straight in the eye. evelyn doesn't back away.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{all i can tell you, miss, is that my colonel found that map in an ancient fortress, and the whole damn garrison believed in it so much, that without orders, we marched halfway across libya and into egypt to find that city. like i told ya, all i saw was sand. everybody else was wiped out by tuareg warriors. i will take your bags.}
<A>__{o'connell takes her bags and heads up the gangplank and onto the same passenger barge that beni and the americans are on. evelyn's eyes follow him, a bit wistfully. jonathan sees it.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{yes, yes, you're right, filthy, rude, a complete scoundrel, nothing to like there at all.}
<A>__{evelyn gives him a look. jonathan just grins. and that's when the warden suddenly brushes past, tipping his raggedy hat.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{a bright good morning to all.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{i have come to protect my investment, thank you very much.}
<A>__{and up the plank he goes. evelyn and jonathan share a look. we go wide again: as the barge pulls out and heads down the nile. we tilt up: to the sun, which then dissolves into }
<L>__{exterior river nile night}
<A>__{the moon, shining down on the desert. the three vicious mumia quietly glide a narrow skiff out onto the river. the one with the hook sits in the middle of the skiff, the other two row, heading for the passenger barge coming their way.}
<L>__{exterior the bar at the bow night}
<A>__{jonathan and the three americans are playing poker. o'connell comes out a door carrying a gunny sack.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{sit down, o'connell, sit down, we could use another good player.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{i only gamble with my life, never my money.}
<C>__{daniels}
<D>__{never? what if i were to wager five hundred dollars says we get to hamunaptra before you?}
<A>__{o'connell returns daniel's cocky look.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{yer on.}
<A>__{burns slips on his dirty bifocals.}
<C>__{burns}
<D>__{what makes you so confident, sir?}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{what makes you?}
<A>__{henderson spits a wad of chew into a spittoon.}
<C>__{henderson}
<D>__{we got us a man who's actually been there.}
<A>__{o'connell's poker face drops, perplexed. same with jonathan.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{i say, what a coincidence, why }
<A>__{o'connell 'accidentally' hits him in the ribs with the gunnysack, shutting him up. jonathan quickly covers.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{ whose deal is it? is it my deal? i thought i just dealt?}
<L>__{exterior barge night}
<A>__{evelyn sits on a table, staring out over the passing river. the gunny sack drops onto the table, startling her.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{sorry, didn't mean to scare ya.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{the only thing that scares me, mister o'connell, are your manners.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{still angry that i kissed ya, huh?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{if you call that a kiss.}
<A>__{o'connell reaches into the gunny sack and starts pulling out revolvers, pistols, hunting knives, a massive elephant gun, and a half dozen carefully wrapped sticks of dynamite.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{did i miss something? are we going into battle?}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{the last time i was at that place everybody i was with died.}
<A>__{this takes the smile off evelyn's face. o'connell starts dismantling and cleaning the guns.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{there's something out there, you know, something under that sand.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{yes, i'm hoping to find a certain artifact, a book, actually, my brother thinks there's treasure. what do you think is out there?}
<A>__{o'connell looks into evelyn's eyes.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{evil. the tuaregs and the bedouin believe that hamunaptra is cursed, they call it, "the doorway to hell."}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{ahmar is ossirion. "passageway to the underworld", actually.}
<A>__{she gives him a know it all grin.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i don't believe in fairy tales and hokum, mister o'connell, but i do believe that one of the most famous books in history is buried out there, the book of the living. it's what first interested me in egypt as a child. it's why i came here, sort of a life's pursuit.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{and the fact that they say it's made out of pure gold, makes no nevermind to you, right?}
<A>__{evelyn is surprised by his knowledge.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{you know your history.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{i know my treasure.}
<A>__{evelyn gets up to go, then she hesitates, nervous, she turns back to o'connell, and as matter of fact as possible says:}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{by the way,... why did you kiss me?}
<A>__{o'connell, cleaning his guns, just shrugs his shoulders.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{i was about to be hanged, seemed like a good idea at the time.}
<A>__{evelyn's eyes widen, furious, she turns and storms off. o'connell looks up, watching her leave, a bit perplexed.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{what?... wha'd i say?}
<A>__{then he hears someone snickering under the table. he quickly reaches down, grabs that someone and lifts him up. it's beni.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{my very good friend! what a surprise.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{why if it ain't my little buddy, beni. i oughta kill you.}
<A>__{o'connell sticks a knife under beni's throat. beni swallows hard, then tries to weasel his way out with a big grin.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{you never were any good with the ladies, o'connell.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{so you're the one leading the americans, i shoulda figured. so what's the scam? you get 'em out in the middle of the desert then leave 'em to rot?}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{unfortunately no, these americans are smart, they pay me only half now, half when i get them back to cairo, so i must go all the way.}
<A>__{o'connell pulls the knife away. beni relaxes, rubs his neck.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{you never believed in hamunaptra, o'connell. why are you going back? the devil himself lives out there.}
<A>__{they look as they hear evelyn yelp. a single camel in the horse paddock takes another bite at her. she yelps again and backs away. o'connell grins as evelyn flees down the deck.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{the girl saved my life, figured it was the least i could do, keep her out of trouble.}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{you always did have more balls than brains.}
<A>__{o'connell's eyes narrow at the insult, he looks back at beni.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{let's make us even, shall we?}
<C>__{beni}
<D>__{even?}
<A>__{o'connell grabs him and chucks him over the side of the barge. beni splashes into the river. o'connell takes his gunny sack and starts walking off down the deck.}
<C>__{beni }
<D>__{o'connell! i am going to kill you for this!}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{sounds familiar.}
<A>__{and that's when he spots three sets of wet footprints, coming up over the railing from the river and heading down the deck. o'connell quickly looks around, immediately on the alert.}
<L>__{interior evelyn's cabin night}
<A>__{evelyn, wearing a nightgown, stands in front of a mirror. she gives her head a good shake, letting her hair fall loose over her bare shoulders. then she turns around, right there is one of the hideous mumia! it's hook. he slams his hand over her mouth and lifts up his hook, ready to strike.}
<C>__{hook}
<D>__{where is the map?}
<A>__{evelyn's terrified eyes glance down. hook looks over, sees the map lying next to a flickering candle on a nearby table.}
<C>__{hook}
<D>__{and the key? where is the key?}
<A>__{evelyn's eyes look confused. she shakes her head. hook grins.}
<C>__{hook}
<D>__{then i will find it myself.}
<A>__{he cocks his hook, about to kill her. and that's when the door is kicked open. o'connell bursts in, gun in each hand. hook spins evelyn around and holds her out in front of him. o'connell looks at her.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{friend of yours?}
<A>__{evelyn's eyes widen. and that's when the candle on the table flickers. everything happens at once, read fast: o'connell spins around just as a window bursts open. a mumia leans in. fires a gun. woodchips blast off the wall next to o'connell's head. he returns fire. kills the mumia. the mumia falls back. firing blindly. a lantern in the room is blasted. kerosene splashes across the wall. bursts into flames. evelyn grabs the candle on the table and jams it back over her shoulder, right into hook's eye. he screeches in pain and lets her go. o'connell grabs her and yanks her out of the flaming room. hallway night o'connell pulls evelyn down the hall, she tries to jerk free.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{the map! we need the map!}
<A>__{he shoves her up against a wall.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{relax! i'm the map!}

<D>__{it's all up here.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{oh that's comforting.}
<A>__{o'connell gives her a look, then pulls her forward.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{c'mon, there's still one more of those guys around here somewhere.}
<A>__{evelyn's flaming room night hot melted wax covers hook's face as he holds his sore eye and struggles to the door. then he notices the key box on the floor. he bends over to pick it up. and that's when the door is kicked open again, it hits him in the ass and knocks him into the fire. jonathan leans in. sees nothing but flames.}

<D>__{o'connell evelyn jonathan ahhhhh!!!}

<C>__{egyptologist}

<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{that bad huh?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{yes, they never used it because they feared it so. it's written, that if a victim of the hom dai should ever arise, he would bring with him the ten plagues of egypt.}

<L>__{exterior camp later that night}
<A>__{having just freshened up for bed, evelyn exits the temple and steps past the sleeping diggers. she spots the egyptologist, his jeweled canopic jar snug under one arm, the book of the dead laying loose under the other. evelyn stares at the book, nervously biting her lip, then she sneaks over, carefully steals it, and quickly tip toes away. lying on some blankets by the campfire, o'connell rolls over and sees evelyn, sitting wide eyed, staring at the book.}
