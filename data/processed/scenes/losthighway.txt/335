<A>__{fred is driving along the two lane desert "lost highway". the wind is picking up even stronger than before. a big storm is blowing in. fred sees a sign glowing just ahead that reads: lost highway hotel. the sign is swaying and blinking as the gusts hit it. fred pulls in and stops under the sign and stares at it. he gets out of the car, tucks the pistol in his belt under his shirt and enters the hotel, which is an old two story building.}
