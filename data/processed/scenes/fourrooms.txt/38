<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior hallway}
<A>__{man and wife are walking down the hall. man stops in his tracks. wife stops too and looks at man. they wait.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{room 716 juancho shuts off the television. he drops the remote to the floor. his attention is on the fireworks outside. he leaps to the window and begins unlatching it.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{juancho}
<D>__{escaping. stinks in here, anyway.}
<A>__{man bursts through the door of the hotel room and stands in the doorway, glaring at the mischievous juancho. juancho bangs his head on the window trying to get back inside. he leaps to the floor and tries to turn on the tv with the remote.}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(stern)}
<D>__{what did i say?}
<A>__{juancho turns to man as if he'd been sitting there watching television the whole time.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{behave.}
<C>__{juancho}
<D>__{yes, papa.}
<A>__{ted appears at the door with man's champagne.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{the champagne you ordered, sir.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{no time for this. leave it on ice.}
<A>__{ted proceeds to place the champagne in the room.}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{but i want some now...}
<A>__{ted is torn. man pushes him into the room.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{there'll be plenty for you and the party, baby, you can bomb yourself all you want at the party.}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{what a waste.}
<A>__{ted places the bucket near the bed. after setting up the bottle, he turns to leave, but now man closes the door, trapping ted inside with them.}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(to ted)}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{ted looks around, bewildered. now what? man is reaching into his coat pocket.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{you want five hundred bucks?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{sure!}
<A>__{man hesitates a moment, then pulls out his wallet. that was too easy.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{how about three?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{three hundred?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{three's good.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{my children are staying here tonight watching tv. i want you to check up on them every thirty minutes.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{check up on 'em?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{make sure they're all right, make sure they're fed, make sure they go to bed.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{we can call out and hire a babysitter.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{i don't trust babysitters. my children are safer alone than with some fucked up pedophile babysitter i don't know from the man in the fucking moon.}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{what about him? what makes you think you can trust him?}
<A>__{man grabs ted's face and tilts it torward wife.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{tell me that's not a face you can trust.}
<A>__{man lets go of ted's face. he feels his jaw. it's still there.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{look, sir, i'd like to help you out, but i really can't. i'm all alone here tonight.}
<A>__{man whips out his wallet and counts out money in ted's face.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{one hundred... two hundred... three hundred...}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i thought you said five hundred.}
<A>__{man glares at ted.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{i said three hundred.}
<A>__{ted doesn't back down.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{no, you distinctly said five hundred.}
<A>__{the angrier man gets, the quieter he talks.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{you calling me a liar?}
<A>__{ted, while not backing down, massages the situation.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{no, i'm not saying you're lying. i'm saying you accidentally forgot that what you first said was five hundred.}
<A>__{man has never been challenged like this by a fuckin' bellboy.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{i don't do anything accidentally, jerk. i might've first said five hundred, but what i last said was three hundred, and what you say last is what counts.}
<A>__{ted not only doesn't back down, but psychologically pokes his finger in the scary man's chest.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{well then, if you say five hundred one last time, we got a deal.}
<A>__{man's eyes narrow. he physically pokes his finger in ted's chest.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{you fuckin' with me, pendejo?}
<A>__{now ted takes a step backwards.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{no, not at all. it's new year's eve and i'm here alone. if there was somebody else here, no problem, but i'm by myself. and looking after your kids is a pain in the ass i don't need }
<C>__{man}
<D>__{you callin' my kids a pain in the ass?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{ no, they're not a pain in the ass, it's the situation that's a pain in the ass.}
<A>__{man drops the tenseness.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{no, you were right the first time. you win, tough guy, five hundred.}
<A>__{man respects ted for not backing down, but not insulting him either. a skill man never learned. wife shoots a look at the children.}
<C>__{wife}
<P>__{(disgusted)}
<D>__{you kids are getting expensive.}
<A>__{juancho turns back to the tv. sarah stares down wife.}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(looking at name tag)}
<D>__{what's your name? ted?}
<A>__{close up of name tag.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yeah. it's ted.}
<A>__{man tears off ted's name tag and throws it to children.}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(to the children)}
<D>__{his name is ted. if you need anything, dial 0 and ask for ted.}
<A>__{sarah catches the name tag and reads the name on it: "ted bellhop." sarah looks up at ted. she clips the pin to her dress and smiles shyly at him. man puts the money in ted's pocket and then grabs his ear, pulling him close.}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(deadly whisper)}
<D>__{if something happens to my children, i wouldn't want to be you.}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{make sure they're in bed before midnight.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{before midnight? then should i wake them up for the countdown to the new year?}
<A>__{wife looks disgusted.}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{no...}
<A>__{as man and wife exit, he turns to the kids and says:}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{don't misbehave.}
<A>__{man closes the door.}
