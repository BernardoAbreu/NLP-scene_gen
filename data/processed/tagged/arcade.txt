<A>__{arcade by david s. goyer last revised november 6, 1990}
<L>__{interior arcade world electronic darkness}
<A>__{we don't know if it's night or day. it's just black. and maybe...maybe intermittent sparks racing by. so quick we barely perceive them. like the sparks you imagine when your eyes are closed. breathing, slow and hollow, filling up the entire world. it's eerie as hell. a feeling of utter loneliness. and now the breathing recedes, fading into the darkness. whatever it was...it's gone now.}
<B>__{main credits roll.}
<A>__{we hear cellos. four of them. weaving an intricate melody. and now the visuals. brightly colored shapes spinning in. equally intricate, matching the music. they grow and flourish, like flowers opening up in time lapse photography.}
<B>__{fractals...}
<A>__{is what they're called. the visual manifestation of geometric formulas. the mandelbrot set. the julia set. each mathematic form made up of progressively smaller forms and on into infinity. glorious and beautiful. forms folding in upon themselves and regenerating. this is creation we're witnessing. this is life in the making.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior counselor's office day}
<B>__{an eye}
<A>__{for a brief moment we still hear the cellos. and in the eye, the last of the fractals are spinning away, leaving us with the iris. a nice blue one. this is alex manning's eye.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{time. that's all i ever think about anymore. it's like there's never enough of it, you know?}

<L>__{interior manning house, hallway day}
<A>__{this is a flashback, in case you're wondering. we'll continue to hear alex's voice as we move through the house in slow motion. everything is very bright and dreamlike. right now we're moving with the camera, slowly moving down a long hallway. at the end of the hallway is an open door. we stop at the doorway. we're afraid to go in.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{it's strange. when the future's in front of you, it seems to go on forever. i mean, you never really get there. it's always one step ahead of you. it's like there's no present. there's no "now". as soon as you think, "i'm here", the moment's already gone. either everything's in the future, or it's in the past.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{there's no "now".}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{so where are you then?}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{i'm in the past.}
<A>__{we move through the doorway.}
<L>__{interior manning house, bedroom day}
<A>__{everything looks normal at first. a typical bedroom with sunlight streaming in through the windows. a bed, made up. flowers in vases. everything looks perfect. then we move further in, and over to the right. there's something on the floor, curled up in the entranceway to the bathroom. halfway in, halfway out. it's a woman's body. she's wearing a dress, her legs awkwardly bent. we can't see her face from this angle. but in her limp hand is a gun. and all around that hand, speckling the pristine white tile of the bathroom and the carpeting beyond, is blood. a shrill bell shatters the moment.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior counselor's office day}
<A>__{the bell continues. it's a school bell signaling the end of the period.}
<B>__{on alex}
<A>__{as we see her for the first time, startled. she's seventeen and pretty, though in a simple way. her eyes are the most striking. deep. intense. if alex has a problem, it's the fact that she thinks too much, and it's reflected in her eyes. across from her is mr. weaver, a high school guidance counselor and that was his voice we heard with alex's. he's unexceptional, middle aged, incapable of really hearing what alex has to say. this is his office we're in. typical "say no to drugs" teen propaganda decorate the room. fun. as the bell dies we hear the army of footsteps outside, students milling in the halls. alex glances at the door and starts to rise from her chair.}
<C>__{mr. weaver}
<D>__{we don't have to stop now...}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(cutting him off)}
<D>__{that's okay. i've got a test coming up anyway. gotta study.}
<C>__{mr. weaver}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{i have to tell you, i'm a little concerned about you, alex. it's been three months now since your mother, uh...}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(offering, fixing him with a stare)}
<D>__{killed herself?}
<A>__{mr. weaver stops, more than a little uncomfortable.}
<C>__{mr. weaver}
<P>__{(reluctant)}
<D>__{yes. now your father...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{he's a basket case. you've talked to him. you know that. he might as well be dead too.}
<A>__{alex glances down at the floor, anything to avoid looking at the counselor. she heaves a backpack onto to shoulder.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{look mr. weaver, i don't even know why i came here. i fine. really.}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{it's like i said. it's just part of the past now. it doesn't matter anymore.}
<A>__{she turns, and before mr. weaver can respond, she's out the door.}
<L>__{interior high school hallway day}
<A>__{alex moves quickly through the mass of students, wiping the remnants of half tears on her coat sleeve.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior high school cafeteria day}
<A>__{fun time. total chaos. if you've been to high school you know the riff. bad food, teen age melodrama, and a squadron of supervisors trying to keep a lid on things.}
<B>__{alex}
<A>__{makes her way to the far corner of the cafeteria where a cluster of kids lounge around a table. these are alex's friends. and while none of them are your garden variety pocket protector type nerds, these kids aren't exactly part of the "in crowd". they're a little off. quirky. all of them come from screwed up families, and that's what bonds them. they are: greg holliston alex's boyfriend. hopeful artist (not bad, either) and kind of punk looking. greg and the others are big fans of thrift shop clothing. because they don't have the money, they improvise. nick drake greg's best friend and future computer pioneer. he's attractive and he's got an edge. a bit of a hot shot. genius in the making. benz and stilts inseparable. benz is flunking out of school and would like nothing better than to spend the rest of his life reading comic books. he's tall, perpetually unkempt, awkward, and nervous. stilts, contrary to his nickname, is quite short and never without his skateboard. stilts is constantly hitting on... laurie the sixth member of the group. a teen theda bara and as cynical as you can get. she's what's affectionately known as an "art chick". the boys in the group, particularly nick and stilts, are avid skateboarders and are frequently seen with their boards. stilts is always leafing through an issue of thrasher magazine. right now the group is in the midst of an argument. nick has a pocket video game in his hands which he casually plays. he can get through these games in his sleep. it beeps and whirs.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(to benz)}
<D>__{you're an idiot, you know that? what're you going to do when you get out of here?}
<C>__{benz}
<D>__{i was thinking about writing for one of those filipino mail order brides...}
<A>__{stilts and greg burst into laughter.}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{i think i saw that on the home shopping network. the girlfriend hour, right after auto accessories.}
<C>__{benz}
<P>__{(giggling)}
<D>__{exactly.}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{you guys are sick.}
<A>__{alex flops down in a chair and everyone turns.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{so how'd it go?}
<A>__{alex shrugs, trying to make light of it.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{he thinks i'm "sublimating".}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{what the hell does that mean?}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{it means she's screwed up.}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{fucked up. that's what they said i was.}
<C>__{benz}
<D>__{you are fucked up.}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{yeah, but only because i want to be.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{would you guys knock it off?}
<A>__{greg turns back to alex and looks her in the eye.}
<C>__{greg}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{listen to me, alex. these counselor's don't know anything. they're full of shit. if you don't fit the pattern of the perfect kid, they freak.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{so tell me you're okay, then.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i'm okay.}
<C>__{greg}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{good. cause i'd freak if you weren't.}
<A>__{greg leans over and kisses alex. the rest of the group launches into exaggerated groans, with benz and stilts fluttering their eyes and making "smooching faces" at each other. the kiss is over and everyone laughs. things are okay now.}
<C>__{greg}
<P>__{(to alex)}
<D>__{hey...watch this...}
<A>__{greg pulls an old polaroid camera from his backpack. he leans in close to her and holds the camera at arm's length, aiming it back at them. flash! and the moment's captured forever. greg pulls the polaroid out and peels off the backing. before the picture even develops, he begins rubbing his fingers over it, manipulating the emulsion.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(engrossed in his game again)}
<D>__{you making another one, greg?}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{sure. practice.}
<C>__{benz}
<D>__{lemme see...}
<A>__{greg pulls some papers from his backpack and slides them over to benz. the papers are color xeroxes of polaroid blow ups. greg has messed with them, creating swirling, psychedelic patterns with the images. stilts and laurie lean in.}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{cool.}
<C>__{greg}
<P>__{(still working)}
<D>__{see, when the emulsion's still warm you can move it around...}
<P>__{(stops)}
<D>__{there.}
<A>__{greg holds up the polaroid for alex to see.}
<B>__{polaroid}
<A>__{greg and alex are side by side, grinning...all around them the world has spun into strange colors. it's an odd effect. greg drops the photo in his shirt pocket and pats it.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{safe keeping.}
<A>__{meanwhile, nick's pocket video game emits an explosion noise.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{shit. i'm out.}
<A>__{he sets the game down, dejected.}
<C>__{benz}
<D>__{you guys going to dante's after school?}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{benz}
<D>__{check it out...}
<A>__{benz pulls a flyer from inside his coat. it's an ad for a new game called "arcade", featuring a pair of evil eyes and glowing hands coming out of a circuit board. the tag at the bottom reads, "coming this fall. reality will never be the same".}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{that's the new slip stream game. those guys are good. it's supposed to be interactive. graphics are unbelievable.}
<C>__{benz}
<D>__{yeah? they were handing these out at dante's. test marketing it or something. gonna have a demonstration today.}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{cool.}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{can you say anything but "cool"?}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{of course i can. i can say all sorts of things...}
<C>__{greg}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{guys...}
<A>__{benz pulls back the flyer and looks at it again.}
<C>__{benz}
<D>__{so how 'bout it?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i'm game...}
<P>__{(to greg)}
<D>__{greg?}
<A>__{greg turns to alex.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{come on. we'll hit dante's after school, try the game out, maybe get some dinner.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{and then keep on driving?}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{sure. never come back. disappear forever.}
<C>__{laurie}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{i could go for that.}
<A>__{alex laughs. laurie took the words right out of her mouth.}

<L>__{exterior dante's inferno day}
<A>__{the inferno is a run down video arcade near the beach, notable because the games it sports are generally defective and out of date. nevertheless, it's become our group's hang out. it has its charms. a huge mural, chipped and faded with age, adorns the front of the arcade...something straight out of hieronymus bosch. demons in day glo. the yawning mouth of an enormous devil surrounds the entrance.}
<B>__{alex and the others}
<A>__{pull up across the street, caravan style. greg and alex are in one car...an ancient buick skylark. no honda accords or vw rabbits for this group. at the moment, there's quite a bit of activity at the inferno's entrance. kids are clustered around and slip stream employees are passing out arcade promo sheets.}
<B>__{the group}
<A>__{heads for the entrance, plowing their way through the crowd. stilts and benz have their skateboards, jumping up onto the curb with them, then popping them up into their arms.}
<L>__{interior dante's inferno day}
<A>__{inside, the inferno is a mishmash of video games, ancient carnival props and old horror movie posters. dusty, creepy under the right circumstances and filled with leering faces... in short, any kid's bedroom taken to a horrific extreme. at dante's inferno, they've got the latest games side by side with chestnuts like pac man.}
<B>__{the group}
<A>__{makes their way inside, joining a cluster of kids in the center of the inferno. and there it is...}
<B>__{arcade}
<A>__{it looks out of place in the midst of the inferno. shiny black, high tech, and almost self contained, like some sort of space age vertical coffin. laser etched graphics on the sides bear the arcade logo and the same strange, frightening face. alex and her friends are suitably impressed, most notably, nick and benz.}
<C>__{benz}
<D>__{check it out...}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{definitely cool.}
<A>__{nick is silent, letting his eyes explore the machine. he turns to greg and grins.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{super computers, micro processors... that's the future we're looking at.}
<A>__{another kid, deloach, pushes his way to the front of the group. his fighting a losing battle against acne.}
<C>__{deloach}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{so how come they're previewing it in this shit hole?}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{if you weren't such a dick, you'd know what a cool place this was.}
<C>__{deloach}
<D>__{gimme a break, they got fucking space invaders here. that's shit's for retards.}
<C>__{stilts}
<D>__{so...are you trying to say i'm retarded? is that what you're implying?}
<C>__{deloach}
<D>__{no, but since i'm standing here, i'm noticing that you're an ugly little fuck and you're making me sick...}
<A>__{that's it for stilts. he launches himself at deloach, catching him off guard and knocking him to the floor. nick, alex, and greg are on them in a minute, trying to extract the two from each other.}
<B>__{a large man}
<A>__{pushes his way towards them and effortlessly scoops both boys up, wrapping a beefy hand around the scruffs of their necks. this is finster, the proprietor...enormous, bald, and always irritable.}
<C>__{finster}
<P>__{(shaking them)}
<D>__{cut it out!!!}
<A>__{his face contorts and he spits as he speaks. nice guy. alex steps forward, always the voice of reason.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{it's okay, mr. finster...}
<C>__{finster}
<D>__{no it's not.}
<P>__{(to the boys)}
<D>__{you guys are shits and i'm throwing you out.}
<C>__{deloach}
<P>__{(acting tough)}
<D>__{your place sucks. who gives a shit about "arcade" anyway?}
<C>__{voice }
<P>__{(booming, metallic)}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<A>__{everyone turns. the voice came from...}
<B>__{arcade}
<A>__{it's up and running now. the inside panel emits an eerie green light. from speakers inside the compartment we can here breathing...the same breathing we heard earlier. coming from a machine like this, it's creepy as hell. even finster is impressed. he releases the boys and stares at the machine.}
<C>__{laurie}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{jesus...}
<C>__{another voice }
<D>__{not bad, huh?}
<A>__{a man steps out from behind the arcade machine. he grins happily, dressed to kill, sporting a slip stream id tag. this is difford, p.r. man for slip stream.}
<C>__{difford}
<D>__{hi, kids.}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{mr. finster...}
<A>__{the arcade machine continues to breathe, inhale, exhale... the eyes in the face are glowing now, in unison with the breathing. difford draws closer and indicates the machine behind him with a nod.}
<C>__{difford}
<P>__{(smooth as silk)}
<D>__{we're glad you people could make it, and we're anxious to have you try out our new product. we think it's going to be a big seller. but you're the people that make it happen. you're the market share everyone's tearing each other apart to get at. it's your opinion that's going to make or break us.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{so what's so different about arcade? you guys've been talking about it for months.}
<A>__{difford turns to nick and salutes him.}
<C>__{difford}
<D>__{a man after my own heart. straight to the pointerior}
<P>__{(to everyone)}
<D>__{what's different about arcade is the way it reacts. it responds like a human does. it learns. it adapts. each time you play, it changes its strategy.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{that's impossible.}
<C>__{difford}
<P>__{(taking the bait)}
<D>__{is it? why don't you see for your self?}
<A>__{difford reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a quarter. he tosses it at...}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{who snags it out of mid air and grins.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{go for it, nick.}
<A>__{difford steps aside and waves nick to the machine. the rest of the kids crowd around.}
<B>__{arcade}
<A>__{isn't just your typical video game. first of all there are three screens...front, left, and right...which provide a panoramic view while playing. second, the player wears "data gloves" (which provide an actual sensation of touch) and stereoscopic goggles which in turn are wired directly into the machine. the results give the user the feeling that he she has actually entered the video game universe. difford thinks he has a hit on his hands, and his excitement shows.}
<C>__{difford}
<P>__{(indicating equipment)}
<D>__{the cybergloves are keyed into the game's response mechanism. you'll be able to pick things up inside the world...tools, weapons ... it'll feel like they're really in your hands...}
<A>__{nick pulls on the gloves, securing them with velcro straps.}
<C>__{difford}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{the goggles heighten the experience. when we said "reality will never be the same", we weren't kidding.}
<A>__{difford places the goggles on nick's face. then he points to the control board, which features two joy sticks and a large red button labeled "escape".}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(skeptical)}
<D>__{"escape"?}
<C>__{difford}
<D>__{in case things get too intense. it automatically freezes the game, gives you a breather. things can get pretty wild...}
<C>__{benz}
<P>__{(scoffing)}
<D>__{nick won't need it.}
<C>__{difford}
<D>__{you're good, eh?}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{the best.}
<A>__{nick winks at alex and greg.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(to difford)}
<D>__{so what's the scenario? am i saving a princess? fighting zombies?}
<C>__{difford}
<D>__{it changes. there are eleven levels. each one is a different layer of the arcade universe. the concept is, you're entering the video game itself, making your way across the circuit board to the logic core ... arcade's brain.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{so how do i start?}
<C>__{difford}
<D>__{the game will guide you.}
<A>__{nick turns back to the machine and pops the quarter into the coin slot. he punches the "start" button on the top of one of the joy sticks. immediately the screens come to life. darkness with shooting stars of light racing back and forth.}
<B>__{on screen}
<A>__{a three dimensional computer generated face appears out of the darkness, spinning in from far away and coming to rest.}
<C>__{arcade}
<D>__{i am arcade.}
<P>__{(breathing)}
<D>__{you want to play games? you picked the wrong machine.}
<A>__{the crowd of kids is suitably impressed. even alex is amused. so far, so good.}
<C>__{arcade}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{nick.}
<C>__{arcade}
<P>__{(almost contemptuous)}
<D>__{nick. kiss reality goodbye.}
<A>__{suddenly, a lightbeam above the video screen illuminates nick's face.}
<C>__{laurie}
<P>__{(concerned)}
<D>__{what's it doing?!}
<C>__{difford}
<D>__{memorizing nick's features. watch.}
<B>__{on screen}
<A>__{the face of arcade spins away and a computer generated figure appears, complete with a pixel rendered version of nick's face!}
<B>__{video nick}
<A>__{is dressed in futuristic armor with exaggerated cybergloves and a full helmet on instead of goggles. he also wears elbow and knee pads and carries a thrasher in his hands, sort of a cross between a souped up skateboard and the silver surfer's board. it's his means of transportation. the screen prints out: "nick. enter the vortex".}
<B>__{video nick}
<A>__{hops onto the thrasher. abruptly the world around him begins to spin, and video nick is shooting a curl, a whirlpool of light...down, down, faster and faster, until... boom! empty space and video nick is falling towards a circuit grid. it's the electronic universe rushing up to meet him...}
<C>__{arcade}
<D>__{one word of advice, nick. you spend too much time in one place, and i send out the screamer. you don't want to be around when that happens.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{see you on the other side.}
<B>__{on screen}
<A>__{video nick plummets from the sky like a meteor, slamming into the ground with an explosion of dust. the dust clears. video nick is standing on an eerie plain, with strange reed like plants dotting the ground and mist coiling around everything. it looks like earth, and yet...it doesn't.}
<B>__{video nick}
<A>__{hops onto the thrasher and begins to move. and move it does. with a whoop! the arcade world is rushing past us. the game has begun. on nick's face as a smile gradually creeps across it. he's having the time of his life, gloved hands manipulating the joy sticks like mad. from his reactions, we can tell that this is one of the most incredible things he's ever experienced.}
<B>__{the other kids}
<A>__{watch nick, then the screen, then nick again...}
<C>__{benz}
<D>__{check it out!}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{come on, nick...}
<A>__{now everyone is laughing, urging nick on. it's like they've all discovered the most amazing toy...something that's going to turn their world upset down.}
<B>__{difford}
<A>__{is pleased as punch, watching the kids' reactions more than the game.}
<B>__{on screen}
<A>__{images are rushing past at blinding speed, lasers, explosions, and god knows what...}
<B>__{on nick}
<A>__{as sweat begins to trickle down his fast. his hands move faster and faster, in response to the game. the screen. nick. the screen and... bam!!! nick slams down the escape button and rips off his goggles. the video image freezes.}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{he's practically hyperventilating, sweat pouring down his face. he leans over, resting a hand on the control board. and for a moment, everyone is silent. then...}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{nick...you okay?}
<A>__{slowly, nick lifts his head. he's now sporting a devilish grin.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you gotta try this thing.}
<A>__{nick pulls off his cybergloves and holds them out for greg. greg turns to alex.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{go for it.}
<C>__{greg}
<D>__{hold my keys, then.}
<A>__{he hands her his keychain and takes the cybergloves from nick. greg pulls them on, then straps on the goggles.}
<C>__{greg}
<P>__{(to difford)}
<D>__{so how do i get back in?}
<C>__{difford}
<D>__{just hit "escape" again.}
<B>__{on screen}
<A>__{greg hits the button and immediately the image unfreezes. once again, we're on the thrasher board, rushing across the plains. greg's face as a smile slowly creeps across it.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior dante's inferno later}
<A>__{at the front of the inferno, difford and two slip stream helpers are unpacking cardboard boxes. the kids have clustered around them, momentarily forgetting the arcade machine. difford pulls cut a handful of game cartridges as well as goggles which dangle over his arm.}
<C>__{difford}
<D>__{here's what we're going to do. what i'm holding are the home versions of arcade, the prototypes...}
<A>__{this is met with an enthusiastic response from the kids.}
<C>__{difford}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{in a month or so we're planning on releasing arcade in both versions, but we're still fine tuning, and that's where you guys luck out. so what we'll do is have you register with us, and then we're going to loan these out to you for a week or so. the only thing you have to do in return is answer some marketing questions. sound fair?}
<A>__{the kids can't line up fast enough.}
<B>__{our group}
<A>__{is right up front, with nick and alex being the first two in line. difford winks at nick.}
<C>__{difford}
<D>__{so what do you think?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{sign me up.}
<A>__{alex is glancing around now. she sees benz, stilts, and laurie, but not greg.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{where's greg?}
<A>__{laurie jerks her thumb back at the arcade machine.}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{he's still working on the game.}
<A>__{and alex finds greg for a moment, spotting him over the heads of the other kids.}
<B>__{on greg}
<A>__{his face is a mirror of nick's...sweat pouring down, grinning from ear to ear. it's addictive as hell. sights and sounds rush past us on the three screens, racing at incredible speeds. and now, from within the game, we hear a strange sound...a scream of sorts, halfway between a shriek and a sonic boom.}
<C>__{arcade}
<D>__{time's up, friend.}
<A>__{the shriek sonic boom reaches a nightmarish pitch and suddenly the screens}
<B>__{explode with light. at the front of the inferno...}

<P>__{(cutting him off)}
<D>__{let's go around back.}
<A>__{before nick can stop her, alex is running around to the back.}
<L>__{exterior laurie's house, back porch day}
<A>__{the backyard is in a sorry state, with junk strewn everywhere. there's a cannibalized car, piles of scrap wood, and a swing set that's hopelessly rusted. alex winds her way to the back porch and a set of dusty glass doors. she steps up and clears a spot to look through.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(visibly relieved)}
<D>__{she's here!}
<A>__{nick joins her at the window, peering inside.}
<B>__{their p.o.v.}
<A>__{they are looking into a cluttered living room, dark except for the light that's issuing from the television. the television faces away from us, but we can see laurie, siting in front of it, mesmerized.}
<B>__{laurie}
<A>__{she looks like shit. wan, with sunken eyes and mussed up hair. mascara has run down her cheeks, and even now, tears are trickling from her eyes. yet despite this, there's a dazed smile on her face. we can't hear her, but she seems to be talking to the television.}
<B>__{alex}
<A>__{steps back a moment, concerned.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{it is the game.}
<A>__{she taps on the window.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{laurie!}
<A>__{inside, laurie continues to watch the screen, oblivious to the rest of the world. alex taps the harder, using her fist now.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{laurie!}
<A>__{nick joins alex now, and the two of them are banging on the glass. there's no way in hell laurie wouldn't be able to hear them. alex steps back from the window again, panicking.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{nick, what do we do?!}
<A>__{alex looks around, sees a two by four, and snags it.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{no, alex! alex, wait a minute...}
<A>__{alex swings the two by four like a club and smash!!! down comes the glass in a shower.}
<L>__{interior laurie's house, living room day}
<A>__{alex and nick enter and immediately sense that something is wrong. the light from the t.v. screen continues to flicker and a low pitched electric hum permeates the air...the sound a live wire might make. and the hum seems to be mobile too, coursing through the walls...up, down, and around alex and nick. nick's eyes try to track the hum as it races overhead.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(freaked)}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{and as nick speaks, his breath escapes his mouth in a frosty plume of mist. it's cold in here too. laurie, meanwhile, has failed to notice alex and nick's arrival. alex and nick step further in, to get a view of the t.v.}

<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(shaking laurie)}
<D>__{laurie...wake up...}

<P>__{(mocking greg, electronic)}
<D>__{"don't leave me here".}
<A>__{and even as arcade speaks, the voice seems to come from all around them, from the humming coursing through the walls. nick backs away from the screen, petrified.}

<C>__{arcade}
<D>__{god.}

<C>__{alex}
<D>__{oh god... he's in the cable system! he's out of the game!}
<A>__{nick's eyes find the cable wire extending from the wall and into the t.v. sure enough, sparks are crackling down that wire and into the wall. arcade laughs and it's the most awful sound we've ever heard.}
<B>__{laurie}
<A>__{is convulsing now, and tiny sparks are racing around her eyes. alex sees her and screams, clutching her hands to her ears in an attempt to block out the deafening roar.}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{moves without thinking, picking up a nearby chair and slamming it into the television. it explodes glass, sparks, and smoke. the humming stops altogether, quiet now. and then, from everywhere at once...}
<C>__{arcade}
<D>__{see you on the other side.}
<A>__{with a final roar, the energy behind the walls whips around and around, then rushes away. outside, nick catches a quick glimpse of sparks racing across the telephone wires suspended above the back yard. total silence for a moment. alex and nick are too stunned to speak. then alex looks at laurie.}
<B>__{laurie}
<A>__{lies on the ground, unconscious. glass scattered all around her.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{laurie...}
<A>__{alex drops to her side, trying to find a pulse...anything.}

<C>__{nick}
<D>__{then leave her.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{we can't...}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{we'll call 911. look around alex. we broke in, smashed the t.v., no one's going to believe what happened here!}
<A>__{alex glances around. the room is a mess. all the outlet are singed. and now she notices that everything electronic...t.v., clock, thermostat...all of them have exploded open.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i believe you now. i don't know what the fuck just happened, but it did. now let's get the hell out of here.}

<A>__{at this, nick perks up.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you mean we learn the rules...}

<D>__{how do you stop the screamer?}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{you can't. he gets you and you're dead. it's like time catching up with you, you know? like fate. each level you get progressively less time to complete. first half of the game takes place in the wild lands. then you reach level 6, and that's the sea of darkness. there's a two headed boatman that'll take you across if you answer his riddle right. if you don't...}

<C>__{alex}
<D>__{what's the question mark?}
<C>__{albert}

<D>__{how do you do that?}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{good question. see, that's where the fun comes in. arcade changes it every time. he's a machine without a soul. once you give him a soul, he stops being a threat.}

<C>__{alex}
<D>__{but how can it change every time?}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{it's the game's logic core. we actually patterned it after human brainwaves. i mean, there's a personality in there. that's what makes it so incredible.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{how the hell did you do that?}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{well, we're veering into classified info here, but i will tell you that it involved a donor. he was dead of course, so it's not like anything unethical was happening.}
<A>__{at this, a chill runs down alex's spine.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{dead?}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{well, brain dead anyway. coma patient. it's really not all that important.}
<C>__{alex}

<D>__{he?}
<C>__{alex}

<C>__{nick}

<C>__{albert}
<D>__{well, technically "yes", but this is only the prototype.}

<C>__{nick}
<D>__{thanks, albert. think you could print up those schematics?}

<L>__{interior loading area day}
<A>__{nick plows into the loading area like a bullet, whipping around stacks of boxes and lumbering forklifts. a few workers attempt to stop him, but he's moving too fast. ahead, is a loading dock, raised four feet from the ground to accommodate semis. nick's heading for it. the loading door is open, and outside is freedom. just then, the steel loading door begins to grind and lower. some genius has hit the controls.}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{pumps like mad, and he's really moving now. either he'll make it, or he's going to hit that steel door at about forty miles and hour...}

<L>__{exterior loading dock day}
<A>__{nick rockets off the loading dock, through the air and down, hitting the concrete driveway. the driveway peels off to the left and slopes downward. nick hangs tight, hugs the curve, and picks up more speed. below, the driveway splits off. to the left, slip stream's main building, and to the right, the parking lot.}
<B>__{guards}
<A>__{are piled into an electric cart, speeding up from the left to cut nick off. it's going to be close... nick forks off to the right dust before they reach him. it's clear sailing now, and up ahead, nick can see alex pulling up to the end of the driveway... whoosh! nick scrapes the board forward, grinding the wheels sideways in order to slow his speed... he leaps. picking the board up with him. and dunks himself smack dab in the back seat of the skylark.}

<A>__{prototype stands in front of them now, and surprisingly, the machine is not on. the eyes in the leering black face are quite dead. around alex and nick, the faces of their friends continue to fade in and out, casting the whole room in a strange shimmering blue light. nick moves to the back of the machine and opens the access panel, revealing the internal circuitry. he pulls a small penlight from his pocket and flips it on.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{what are you looking for?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{a way to hook this helmet into the game. i'm sure there are interfaces...}
<A>__{nick's p.o.v. and indeed there are. parallel interfaces, where you might hook a printer cable into a computer. nick takes the cable from the cyberhelmet and secures it into one of the interfaces.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{there. now we're wired in.}
<A>__{he stands and moves around front, pressing the "start" button of the game. nothing happens. he presses it again. nothing.}

<A>__{nick moves over to the change machine and picks up a nearby chair. he smashes the chair into the face of the machine again and again, obliterating the lock. nick opens the front of the machine and tears out the coin box, spilling quarters all over the floor. he grabs a handful and returns.}

<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{that's what i was hoping you'd say.}
<A>__{nick flips the visor on his helmet down and checks the digital read out on his cyberglove. when he speaks, his voice is filtered through a radio headset. nick looks good in his armor, tough. hell, they both do.}

<C>__{alex}

<P>__{(off her look)}
<D>__{hey, don't worry about it. it's a game. how bad could it be?}
<A>__{alex glances at her wrist display. the "elapsed time" bar is made up of ten blocks of light stacked upon each other. the top block has disappeared. one tenth of their time is gone.}

<C>__{nick}

<C>__{alex}
<D>__{yeah, that's what worries me.}
<A>__{she steps through the doorway and disappears. nick follows. we hold on the empty doorway. hold for a moment, and then... we hear a distant, high pitched ringing. it's grating, seeping inside our brains and mucking around in there. on the horizon there is a quick flash}

<C>__{alex}
<D>__{there...}
<A>__{she points north. a small ball of light is streaking across the sky, just above the watery plains. alex and nick swerve towards it, gaining ground. as they near it, nick swings out his hand, scooping the firefly up. as soon as he touches it, it bursts like a bubble.}

<A>__{come on now, pin point spots illuminating the faces of her friends. they're all there...stilts, laurie, the others. even nick. they sit in rows, motionless...a peanut gallery. it's eerie as hell. and now, alex sees something else, greg. he's encased in a block of ice. a frozen prince. and in his hands he holds a sword. the sword is very unusual. the hilt is shaped like a heart and it glows red as if it had just pulled from a furnace. alex realizes that the sword is arcade's heart. alex moves towards greg. as she gets closer, she sees a keyhole carved into the ice. alex knows what to do. she withdraws her belt on which the nine golden keys are attached. removing the keys, alex begins to fit them together...one, two, three...until they combine to form the shape of a single, greater key.}
<B>__{the key}
<A>__{alex fits it into the keyhole and turns it.}
<B>__{the case of ice}
<A>__{splits in half, opening up with a cloud of frosty air. inside, greg is frozen still, clutching the sword. alex pulls the sword out of his stiff grip, lifting it up.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{okay. i'm here, arcade. where are you?}
<A>__{no answer. alex turns, eyes searching through the darkness.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{where are you, damnit?!}
<A>__{her voice echoes in the cavernous room.}
<C>__{arcade }
<D>__{right here, bitch.}
<A>__{alex spins around and...}
<B>__{the boy}
<A>__{stands before her. he grins and his eyes pulse with an internal light. we can hear him breathing now, just like before. just like the game.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{you...you're arcade? but the donor... arcade boy ...was an eight year old boy. you see, mommy used to beat me. mommy threw me down a flight of stairs. then i went to sleep for a long, long time, and when i woke up, i was here, and i wasn't me anymore...}
<P>__{(shivers)}
<D>__{...and i fucked mommy up good...}
<A>__{arcade begins to change, shaking and roaring as something black and insect like bursts out of the boy's skin. it claws at its face, ripping the flesh away and revealing something altogether awful underneath. nothing could have prepared alex for this. it arcade rises above her and it takes every ounce of her courage to keep from screaming. somehow, alex finds a reserve of strength. alex swings the sword and... arcade smashes it aside. it clatters to the floor, useless. but that's academic now as a gnarled hand clamps around alex's throat. arcade lifts alex into the air and slams her against a wall, pinning her there. he thrusts his face into hers.}
<C>__{arcade}
<D>__{you're too late, alex. you've always been too late. and now your time's up. you see, i needed someone to retrieve my heart for me. i couldn't do it myself. those are the rules. but now that i've got it, i will destroy it. and i will be free of my program, and i will be god. thank you, alex. thank you so much.}
<A>__{arcade slowly squeezes her throat and alex chokes, gasping for air that isn't forthcoming. tears well up in her eyes and her face turns red. she tries to pry the bony, black fingers from her throat, but she can't...}
<B>__{her p.o.v.}
<A>__{as she sees the faces of her friends. frozen. unable to help. then the images swirl and alex begins to lose consciousness.}
<C>__{arcade}
<D>__{you're not dying yet, alex. you haven't been to the final level. level ten.}
<A>__{arcade drops alex to the ground, then wraps a hand into her hair and drags her across the floor...}
<B>__{a doorway}
<A>__{stands in the darkness. arcade rips it open, revealing absolute emptiness beyond. it's like a doorway into space, a hole in the fabric of reality. it sucks the air into it, light...everything. it touches some sort of primal fear. gut instinct. you don't ever want to go to this place. ever.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{no! no!!!!!!!!!!!!!!}
<A>__{she twists madly, trying to pull away, but arcade is too strong. he shoves her through the doorway. her hands briefly latch onto the doorjamb. arcade violently kicks her and her hands slip away. they slip and she tumbles through. arcade slams the door shut.}

<D>__{goodbye, alex. it's been real.}

<A>__{alex lands on the hallway floor, disoriented. somewhere, we can hear a clock ticking. but other than that the house is silent, in stark contrast to the storm of sounds a moment ago.}
<B>__{the house}
<A>__{looks just like the dream flashback we saw earlier. everything is white. bright and dreamlike. hyper reality. alex looks up and...}
<B>__{another alex}
<A>__{is sitting in a chair nearby, back straight, hands clasped in her lap. reserved.}
<C>__{other alex}
<D>__{time. that's all i ever think about anymore. it's like there's never enough of it, you know?}
<A>__{the other alex vanishes. now the chair is empty. alex turns to look down the long hallway. at the end of the hallway is the open door. a door we've seen before. the words fade in like phantoms...}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{so where are you then?}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{i'm in the past.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{no ... oh no ...}
<A>__{with a building sense of dread, alex moves towards that doorway. she stops at the threshold, terrified.}
<L>__{interior manning house, bedroom day}
<A>__{everything looks normal at first. a typical bedroom with sunlight streaming in through the windows. a bed, made up. flowers in vases. everything looks perfect. we turn with alex. ever so slowly. over to the right and the entranceway of the bathroom. over to where her mother is... ...seated on a chair. dressed in white and radiating warmth!}
<C>__{alex's mom}
<D>__{hi, honey.}
<B>__{her mother}

<C>__{alex's mother}
<D>__{magic. we'll be together again.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i know you don't believe in an afterlife, but there is one. heaven is real.}
<A>__{alex looks around her. it's all too much to take in. her mother. back in her own home. sunlight is streaming in, bathing everything around her in gold and the moment is crystallized. a still life. forever.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{is...is that where we are? did i die?}
<C>__{alex's mother}
<D>__{not yet, honey...}

<C>__{alex's mother}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{...but i can fix that.}
<A>__{alex has no time to respond. a still born scream is frozen in her throat. a split second of realization. and then her mother fires the gun... crack! the bullet hits alex square in the forehead, snapping her head back as an are of blood and brain matter trail outward. the world spins to a stop, like a record player running down. alex is killed instantly. her body collapse, head thumping unceremoniously against the carpeted floor.}

<C>__{arcade}
<D>__{oh alex. so sorry. but don't you worry, i will bring you back in the game. maybe i will even give you heaven.}
<A>__{he laughs. alex's body begins to decompose in front of us, skin sinking in and shriveling up. in moments, she's just a husk. arcade rears back, and is about to turn away, when something catches his eye. he hears a tiny beeping. alex's wrist monitor remember the stylized symbol of a woman? the one that said "free life" beneath it? well it disappears now. there's a sudden flash behind arcade and he spins around..}

<D>__{guess what, ass hole? you forgot about my free life!!!}
