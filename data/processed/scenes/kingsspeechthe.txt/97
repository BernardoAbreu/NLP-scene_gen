<A>__{world night or day, depending on location in homes, pubs (where we see the man with the rosacea nose), clubs, hotels, boarding houses, factories, mines, prisons, a shearing shed in new zealand, cattle station in australia, sites in india, south africa, loci around the commonwealth and empire. china. japan. the kremlin. the white house. hitler's mountain top wolf den. the south of france (where david and wallis listen dolefully.) during this, the address continues, with dramatic pauses to be sure, but no real hesitations.}

<D>__{...this message spoken with the same depth of feeling for each one of you as if i were able to cross your threshold and speak to you myself. for the second time in the lives of most of us we are at war. for we are called, with our allies, to meet the challenge of a principle which, if it were to prevail, would be fatal to any civilized order in the world. it is the principle which permits a state, in the selfish pursuit of power, to disregard its treaties and its solemn pledges; which sanctions the use of force, or threat of force, against the sovereignty and independence of other states. such a principle, stripped of all disguise, is surely the mere primitive doctrine that might is right, and if this principle were established throughout the world, the freedom of our own country and of the whole british commonwealth of nations would be in danger. bertie (v.o. on radio) (cont'd) but far more than this the peoples of the world would be kept in the bondage of fear, and all hopes of settled peace and of the security of justice and liberty among nations would be ended. this is the ultimate issue which confronts us.}
<A>__{end the montage with a return to the exterior of buckingham palace. outside, stand solemn crowds, listening to the speech on loudspeakers. pan their faces, the faces of england, stalwart and resolved.}
<C>__{bertie }
<D>__{for the sake of all that we ourselves hold dear, and of the world's order and peace, it is unthinkable that we should refuse to meet the challenge. it is to this high purpose that i now call my people at home and my peoples across the seas, who will make our cause their own. i ask them to stand calm, firm, and united in this time of trial. the task will be hard. there may be dark days ahead, and war can no longer be confined to the battlefield. but we can only do the right as we see the right, and reverently commit our cause to god.}
