<L>__{interior upstairs hallway that moment}
<A>__{selina's made it back upstairs, but she's moving at quarter speed, favoring one leg and clutching her ribs as she lopes down the hallway. she's just passed the balcony overlooking the entry hall when batman appears dead ahead in her path. he's ready to rumble but instead of responding, she packs it in. she stops, slumps against a wall and begins to laugh.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{it could've been so nice you and me if only you weren't so screwed up.}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{it's over. i don't want to hurt you any more.}
<C>__{selina}
<D>__{tell me something one thing. if you don't enjoy all this...why do you do it?}
<A>__{he just looks at her. he doesn't have an especially good answer. she sighs.}
<C>__{selina }
<D>__{i will never understand men.}
<A>__{she spins suddenly, delivering a high kick to batman's throat. as he reels backward, into a wall, she leaps up onto the narrow bannister railing some thirty feet above the entry hall floor and goes into a crouch preparing to spring at the enormous crystal chandelier mounted to the ceiling but just as she launches off, batman rolls and brings up a gun from his belt. he fires a razor sharp disk which sails past her head, cleanly slicing through the chain which suspends the chandelier. the chandelier falls just as catwoman catches hold of it and she finds herself plummeting to the floor of the entry hall. on impact, the chandelier explodes into a thousand fragments; the catwoman lands hard on her back and lies sprawled in the midst of the wreckage, unmoving. batman advances slowly down the stairs. her arms and legs jut out at unnatural angles; she lets out an eerie, whimpering yowl of pain a cri du chat. he stands over her; she glares up at him.}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{nine lives.}
<C>__{catwoman}
<D>__{i can't move. i can't move.}
<A>__{her face is cut and bleeding. she tries to lift an arm and can't quite manage it. he crouches down beside her, still cautious...}
<C>__{catwoman }
<D>__{don't look at me!!}
<P>__{(pleading)}
<D>__{do me, baby...do me now...that's what i want. please?}
<A>__{batman looks up. dick is standing on the balcony overlooking them, highly curious as to what he'll do.}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{batman slowly rises to his feet. she lets out another gruesome whine.}
<C>__{catwoman}
<D>__{come on. don't stop now. finish me off.}
<P>__{(almost weeping with pain)}
<D>__{son of a bitch. you're all alike...}
<A>__{her steel claws snick into place. with an agonizing effort she lifts her forearm bends her wrist. she's trying to slit her own throat. he reaches for his belt, extracts a glassine capsule, and breaks it open with his thumb. he drops it amid the shattered glass around her face. a tiny cloud of green gas plumes out, and her hand falls limply at her side as she lapses into unconsciousness. batman stands over her for a minute as dick marches down to join him.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{you should've done it, man. you should've killed her.}
<A>__{batman gives him a long, hard look but says nothing.}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{there's a radio in the cave. we'll send for help.}
