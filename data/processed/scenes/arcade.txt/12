<L>__{exterior dante's inferno day}
<A>__{the inferno is a run down video arcade near the beach, notable because the games it sports are generally defective and out of date. nevertheless, it's become our group's hang out. it has its charms. a huge mural, chipped and faded with age, adorns the front of the arcade...something straight out of hieronymus bosch. demons in day glo. the yawning mouth of an enormous devil surrounds the entrance.}
<B>__{alex and the others}
<A>__{pull up across the street, caravan style. greg and alex are in one car...an ancient buick skylark. no honda accords or vw rabbits for this group. at the moment, there's quite a bit of activity at the inferno's entrance. kids are clustered around and slip stream employees are passing out arcade promo sheets.}
<B>__{the group}
<A>__{heads for the entrance, plowing their way through the crowd. stilts and benz have their skateboards, jumping up onto the curb with them, then popping them up into their arms.}
