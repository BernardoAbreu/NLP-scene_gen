<L>__{exterior residential street night}
<A>__{toby and arthur are eating ice cream cones and smoking cigarettes at the same time. they walk slowly, desultorily. though still effeminate, arthur has dropped much of the flounciness that he uses in public.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{... tobias? your real name is tobias? toby... tobias... i like it it's very elegant.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{my real parents would probably have given me an elegant name, too. i say 'real parents' because i suspect i'm a foundling. somebody royal or at least very, very beautiful had me and gave me to my poor but honest mother.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{tell me more about you.}
<C>__{toby}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{every day of my life feels like a mile on the bataan death march.}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i knew i'd like you.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{why'd you point at me that day?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{because you're an alien. you don't belong in concrete any more than i do. this place would like to kill us because we're different.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{oh, come on, arthur. that's a little dramatic.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{think so? you know what chickens do if one chicken's born with a little difference? with a few black feathers on its head, say? they peck at the black spot 'til the chicken's dead they can't stand the fact that it's different. now we're both different. your difference is something other than...}
<P>__{(husky voiced actress)}
<D>__{... my difference...}
<P>__{(normal tone)}
<D>__{but we're both aliens here.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i don't exactly feel like an alien. i've got friends here.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{yes, and they're fools. and you act like a fool when you're around them. a prediction: if you stay in concrete, you'll wind up working at the a&p either that or you'll go on a rampage with a hunting rifle.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{yeah, and you'll wind up a recluse that everybody says likes to dress up in his mama's old clothes.}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{maybe, maybe, but no matter how many times i have to repeat: my primary goal's to get out of concrete.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{burma shave!}
<A>__{arthur and toby laugh. as they walk on, though, toby's face is thoughtful.}
