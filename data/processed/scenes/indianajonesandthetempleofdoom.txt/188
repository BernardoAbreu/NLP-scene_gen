<A>__{the mine car hurtles past. indy sits in front, pulling back on the brake lever to control their speed and keep them from careen ing off the tracks. expecting trouble, short round peers over the back end of the car. willie ducks low, watching the heavy beams flashing danger ously close above their heads. then willie's eyes go wide and she groans in terror like a girl on a roller coaster as the mine car suddenly plunges downward, taking their stomachs with it. a gunshot rings out and short round sees the first thuggee car appear around a curve behind them. mola ram's gunmen start blasting. bullets ricochet off the mine car and indy yells back to short round.}
