<L>__{int imf briefing room}
<A>__{swanbeck stands looking out the window. noisy crowds from the festival provides a constant walla, and during the sequence, the first effigies are lit, and smoke and flame provide a vivid background thru briefing room's window.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{fetival's a pain in the ass. honoring saint by setting'em on fire.}
<P>__{(turning to ethan)}
<D>__{sit down, sit down.}
<A>__{ethan sits.}
<C>__{swanbeck }
<D>__{let's you know what they think of saints, doesn't it? damn near set me on fire on my way over here. as if i haven't been burned enough today.}
<A>__{a moment where it's impossible to tell which way the wind is going to blow between these two. then civilly:}
<C>__{swanbeck }
<D>__{sorry i barged in on your vacation.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{sorry i didn't let you know where i was.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{don't be. wouldn't be on vacation if you did.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{well. you're sorry and i'm sorry.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{why did you phrase it like that?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{'you're sorry and i'm sorry.'}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{you gotta be kidding.}
<A>__{swanbeck turns to his computer and begins play on a dvd, and projected onto a computer screen staring back at ethan is:}
<B>__{vladimir nekhorvich}
<C>__{nekhorvich}
<P>__{(with exaggerate brio)}
<D>__{well, dmitri! how are you?..}
<A>__{nekhorvich pauses as if waiting for reply. ethan smiles.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{..i'm fine..and you?}
<C>__{nekhorvich}
<D>__{i'm fine..}
<A>__{ethan laughs.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i'm fine and you're fine..}
<A>__{with ethan simultaneously whispering:}
<C>__{nekhorvich}
<D>__{i'm fine too.. i'm fine and you're fine do you remember, dear fried, how you got sergei and i to repeat those lines from dr. strangelove and we gave you the name of that silly soviet premier because we didn't know your name?..in those days, you not only saved our lives, you saved our sanity. 'now, then dmitri we have this little problem': every search for a hero must begin with something that every hero requires; a villain. therefore, in a search for our hero, bellerophon, we created a monster chimera. i beg you, dmitri, come to sydney and accompany me to atlanta immediately. however we travel, i must arrive at me destination, within 20 hours of departure. forgive this fanciful explanation, but for now prudence dictates that i communicate nothing but the gravest urgency. i fear i can entrust this to no one but you, dmitri. as we say, 'i'm sorry and you're sorry'..}
<A>__{swanbeck stops the dvd.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{let me ask you something. you have any idea what the hell he's talking about?}
<A>__{ethan smiles.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{an idea, yeah.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{like?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{like it's a good idea to pick him up in a hurry. and a bad idea to fly him on a commercial carrier. so let's get on with it. he's still in sydney?}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{dr. vladimir nekhorvich is dead. so is his colleague, gradski, but that happened earlier. we had nekhorvich on a flight from sydney that crashed in the rockies..}
<A>__{ethan sits back, heavily.}
<C>__{swanbeck }
<D>__{ hunt, are you listening?..}
<A>__{slowly looking up:}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{if he didn't want to go anywhere without me, how did you get him on the flight?}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{you were there.}
<A>__{swanbeck clears his throat. he turns back to the computer and punches in: mission double image. file open to computer scans of ambrose, sean, and hunt, ethan, the computer scanning and comparing their features, millimeter by millimeter, stat by stat, as the computer then imposes, with the help of the physiognomy scan, ethan's face on ambrose: hence, mission double image.}
<B>__{ethan}
<A>__{slowly looks up at swanbeck.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{when i couldn't find you, i had to replace you. sean ambrose was the obvious choice. he double you, what? two, three times?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{twice.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{what did you think of him?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{you know we had reservations about each other. isn't it a little late in the day to be asking me that?}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{not necessarily.}
<A>__{swanbeck shows ethan a photo of airline captain.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{airline record list captain harold macintosh as the pilot for flt 2207. as far as the media and all governmental agencies are concerned, captain macintosh died on the flight, but in fact he missed it. he did, however make the next flight in cargo, stuffed into a rather small suitcase considering his size.}
<A>__{another photo of an open suitcase, the body in it partially obscured by a ring of police and customs officers.}
<C>__{swanbeck }
<D>__{someone on that flight planned an operation designed to down the plane and make it look like an accident. someone skillful enough to bring the whole thing off without a hitch but they don't always get your luggage on the plane, even when you fly first class.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{so there's one thing we know ambrose doesn't.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{then you do think it was ambrose.}
<A>__{ethan barely nods.}
<C>__{swanbeck }
<D>__{and you're not surprised.}
<A>__{ethan gives swanbeck a look.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{whatever nekhorvich was carrying sean wanted and he wanted to conceal the fact that he took it.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{enough to kill nekhorvich and two hundred innocent passengers?}
<A>__{ethan smiles.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{sean feels he hasn't done the job unless he leaves a lot of hats on the ground.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{the question is why? what was this chimera nekhorvich was carrying?}
<A>__{ethan rises and moves to the window.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{right now only ambrose knows that.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{in any case, you've got to recover chimera and bring it to us.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{in order to do that, i've got to figure out how he plans to make money with it.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{ right. in fact since the plane went down our banking sources have confirmed a marked increase in the stock pilling of cash in terrorists accounts.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{'terrorists?'}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{well you know nekhorvich's history. you're the one who got him out of the soviet union was it still in bio weapon business.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{if that's what you're thinking ambrose would have set up a bidding situation with any number of buyers before he got on the plane. locating him in time to stop something like that }
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{ is where miss hall comes in.}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(blindsided)}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{miss hall and ambrose had a relationship which he took very seriously. she walked away and he's wanting her back ever since. we believe she's our surest and quickest way of location him.}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(acidly)}
<D>__{and then what?}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{then makes sure she continues to see him. gets him confide in her and report to you.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{you made it sound as if i was recruiting her for her skills as a thief.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{well, then i mislead you. or you made the wrong assumption. either way we're asking her to resume a prior relationship, not do anything she hasn't already done.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{she's got no training for this kind of thing.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{go to bed with a man and lie to him? she's a woman. she's got all the training she needs.}
<A>__{ethan's anger flashes but does his best to contain it.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i don't think i can get her to do it.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{you mean it'll be difficult.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{very.}
<C>__{swanbeck}
<D>__{well it's not mission difficult, hunt. it's mission impossible. difficult should be a walk in the park for you. if you can think of a quicker way to get to ambrose, you're welcome to try. oh, by the way, you might want to take a look at these..if you have any further qualms about getting her to do the job.}
<A>__{he pulls out a little minolta digital camera (identical to the one in nekhorvich's bag at airport security). swanbeck sets it on the table. ethan picks it up the tiny camera and puts it to his eye.}
