<L>__{interior sea king helicopter airborne day}
<A>__{frowning, bond peers at the sonar operator's screen.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{still nothing?}
<A>__{the operator shakes his head. the pilot calls back from the cockpit:}
<D>__{co pilot commander bond: they've found one of the crewman's bodies!}
<L>__{exterior coastal inlet marshland strait of malacca day}
<A>__{the sea king comes in above several police cars and boats. bond jumps the last ten feet, and the chopper peels off.}
<C>__{male voice }
<D>__{yo! jimbo!}
<A>__{bond turns to look: it's jack wade.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{wade, what the hell are you doing here?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{i am not here, ol' buddy. the cia has absolutely no knowledge of the missing ship, the missing gold, where it was going, or when it left hong kong.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{that's reassuring.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{hey the world is my office.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{let's take a look at the body.}
<A>__{as bond moves off, wade sniffs the air, savoring the aroma:}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{smells like... coffee plants.}
<A>__{new angle a policemen pulls a white sheet from the body. (we don't see it.) bond and wade look down at something gruesome:}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{colorful... shark attack?}
<A>__{bond shakes his head grimly.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{i don't think so. the veins are cauterized as if they were sealed by heat...}
<P>__{(beat, confounded)}
<D>__{but there are no burn marks on the flesh. it doesn't make sense.}
<P>__{(to the policeman)}
<D>__{who found the body?}
<C>__{police officer}
<P>__{(points to)}
<D>__{dato. local fisherman. says it came in with the tide early this morning.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{ask him if it could have washed in from the west side of the strait.}
<A>__{the policeman has an animated conversation with fisherman. then:}
<C>__{policeman}
<D>__{no. he says it's not possible. the current could have only brought the body in from the east.}
<C>__{bond}
<P>__{(to wade)}
<D>__{you have a boat?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{i don't know if you'd call it a boat...}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{something with an engine? not oars?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{step into my office.}
