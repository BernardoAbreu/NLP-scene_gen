"i've never seen a guy get fired into a buckle that hard!" "the ayatollah taking it to the ram outside the ring!" "ram absorbing tremendous punishment! how much more can he take?" "wait a minute... look at this... the ram is getting up!" "he's coming back! i don't believe it!" "suplex!" "powerbomb!" "randy the ram robinson giving absolutely everything he's got! this is the very definition of heart!" "just listen to this crowd! the entire garden, 20,000 people, are on their feet!" "ram climbing to the top rope... the crowd going wild... they know what's coming..." a photo of randy standing on the top rope, his bent arms pressed against the sides of his head like ram's horns. "uh oh, the horns are out... here it comes..." we freeze on a final image of randy flying high above the canvas, horns out, poised to crash down on the ayatollah.

<D>__{we are gonna find something great!}
<A>__{cassidy is less loose and playful than randy, much more in business mode. they come to the back where, against the wall, she finds what she's looking for: a bunch of cardboard boxes bursting with a wildly eclectic assortment of tops, skirts, pants, etc. she starts sifting through.}

<A>__{cassidy leads randy by the arm over to the... men's area: cassidy heads to a rack of clothes. she quickly zeroes in on a retro bowling shirt. she holds it up to randy, who makes a scrunched up face.}

<D>__{ah, maybe she's just a friend.}
