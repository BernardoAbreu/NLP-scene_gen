<A>__{jeanne goes to the telephone washroom. the telephone booth is occupied. as she waits, she watches in disgust as an old lady cleans her dentures with a toothbrush and then puts them back in her mouth. jeanne studies her own face in the mirror, puffing her cheeks up in judgement. as she does, paul exits the phone booth, still lost in anguish. after watching him leave, jeanne uses the pay phone. she speaks to her mom.}
