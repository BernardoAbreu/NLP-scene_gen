<D>__{how's it feel?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{a little better...}
<A>__{the fireworks suddenly begin, and fill the sky above the grove with bursts of bright, multi colored lights. sporadic meteors rain down at the same time. it's magnificent. after a beat, sam looks over at jeremy... the fireworks illuminate his torso, and she is appalled to see that the raw, reddish rash has spread to cover the greater part of it.}
