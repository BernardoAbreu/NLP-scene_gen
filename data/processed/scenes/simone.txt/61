<L>__{exterior studio lot day}
<A>__{"million dollar reward for photo of simone!" is the headline on the cover of the echo. viktor is reading the magazine as he makes his way through the studio lot. he looks up to see several studio carts parked outside his soundstage. a group of studio executives, led by elaine, is trying to break into the "closed set". viktor runs towards the door, throwing himself between the door and the executives.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{ you can't go in there!}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{ we have to talk to her, viktor!}
<C>__{executive 1}
<D>__{ we know she's in there!}
<A>__{viktor glares at the security guard who shrugs weakly.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(struggling to hold them back)}
<D>__{ why? what's all this about?}
<C>__{executive 2}
<P>__{(waving a spreadsheet)}
<D>__{ we've got the tracking numbers for "eternity forever".}
<C>__{executive 3}
<D>__{ they're in the toilet.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{ she has to get out there and sell the film.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{ what do you want her to do, go door to door ?}
<C>__{executive 1}
<D>__{ even garbo would be on the talk show circuit if she was alive today.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{ it's precisely because she doesn't crave the limelight that people love her. i told you, she's only about the work.}
<C>__{executive 3}
<D>__{ this is over shadowing the work!}
<C>__{executive 2}
<P>__{(waving the front page of the echo)}
<D>__{that's the problem. she's more famous for her no shows than her shows.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{ it's starting to look like she doesn't support the film or you, viktor.}
<P>__{(trying to squeeze past viktor)}
<D>__{if you can't handle her, i will.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(blocking her path)}
<D>__{not now. she's emotional. her mother dies today. scene forty two of "good for nothing". it's not a good time.}
<A>__{elaine and the executives are not convinced, they overpower viktor.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{no! please, don't go in there!}
<A>__{too late. elaine and the suits force the lock and enter.}
