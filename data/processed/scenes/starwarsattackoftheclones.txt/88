<D>__{your mother had gone out early, like she always did, to pick mushrooms that grow on the vaporatos. from the tracks, she was about halfway when they took her. those tuskens walk like men, but they're vicious, mindless monsters. thirty of us went out after her. four of us came back. three more are still out there looking. i'd be with them, only... i just couldn't ride any more... until i heal.}
