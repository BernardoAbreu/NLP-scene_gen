<L>__{interior helicopter day}
<A>__{ramirez moves cautiously, searching for trip wires, using his knife to check the edges of the seats and door frames. grimly he glances at the two bodies slumped over the controls and then exits, snapping into and rappelling down the rope to the ground. he joins schaefer standing in the f.g. they look up, watching as dillon moves through the cockpit, searching through pockets and compartments. schaefer turns his back to the helicopter.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{the pilots have each got one round in the head. and whoever hit it stripped the shit out of it.}
<A>__{schaefer studies the clearing, eyes always moving, wary. he turns back, looking at the chopper.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{took 'em out with a heat seeker.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{there's something else, major...}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{mmmnnn...?}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{i don't think that was any ordinary army taxi...}
<A>__{schaefer looks at him quizically.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{...looks more like a surveillance bird to me.}
<A>__{dillon rappells down the line and approaches.}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{have you picked up their trail yet?}
<A>__{schaefer taps ramirez on the shoulder and he moves away. schaefer turns to dillon: revised "hunter" 4 21 86}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{billy's on it.}
<P>__{(indicates chopper)}
<D>__{heat seeker. pretty sophisticated for half asses mountain boys.}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{they're getting better equipped every day.}
<A>__{bill approaches from the b.g.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{major, looks like there were ten, maybe twelve guerrillas. looks like they took some prisoners from the chopper.}
<P>__{(points)}
<D>__{then a different set of track, over there.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{six others, u.s. issue jungle boots. they came in from the north, then followed the guerrillas.}
<A>__{schaefer turns to dillon.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{mean anything to you?}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{probably another rebel patrol. they operate in here all the time.}
<A>__{schaefer is obviously concerned about this. he turns to billy.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{get ahead, see what you can find.}
<P>__{(to ramirez)}
<D>__{slow and easy.}
<A>__{revised "hunter" 1 27 86}
<C>__{schaefer }
<P>__{(to dillon)}
<D>__{we don't want any accidents.}
<A>__{billy takes up the trail, disappearing in to the jungle. ramirez signals, the team moves out.}
