<A>__{she gets a gun out of the drawer, looks at it, smiles, drops it back into the drawer, moves around the desk and faces the door, composing herself and waiting.}
<L>__{exterior charlie's door}
<A>__{as haven pauses, pushes it open. then walks slowly in.}
<L>__{interior charlie's office dawn}
<A>__{she is standing with her back to the desk, her fingers tight on the edge of the desk as haven walks in. he stops and looks around and then at her. there is a slight smile on her face.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you cause me an awful lot of trouble.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{yeh... but i finally brought you something.}
<A>__{he hands her the little derringer she had given to mark.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you didn't really think mark would use it, did you?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{maybe i just wanted to send you a gun.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(thoughtfully)}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{isn't it a little late to make any difference?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{it's pretty late.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i have to arrest you.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{murder.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i could have killed you from the window but i didn't. and i didn't kill the two men or goodard.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{who did?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{maybe mick maybe prince who knows.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you know.}
<A>__{she puts the little gun on the desk.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you'd almost as soon be killed as arrest me, wouldn't you?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{almost.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{which are you wells fargo or army?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{army.}
<A>__{he hands her the paper he showed iles. she just glances at it without touching it. smiles at him.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i guess it's my turn to wish you'd gone to china.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i wish i had too.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{if you still have that gold, and i think you do, we might make it yet. you see i believe that every man has his price.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{some men don't believe that.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{but every woman knows it.}
<A>__{her eyes pass him towards the door behind him.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{only there wouldn't be any women on my jury.}
<P>__{(taking out his pipe)}
<D>__{and that's why you're not as bad off as you might think... i could find twelve men who might think you capable of almost anything but i wouldn't bet they'd vote that way after staring at you through a trial.}
<P>__{(he notes her eyes go past him)}
<D>__{mick is dead for the murders and prince can be hung for the rest of it...}
<A>__{at the bare rustle of sound behind him (and the memory of her eyes going past him) haven whirls, stopping aside and drawing as he does so. and just as he does so, prince, in the doorway, fires. haven shoots so that the shots ring out almost simultaneously. prince topples forward on his knees and then his face. the dice roll out of his unclenched left hand. med. shot of haven and charlie as their eyes read the dice. haven puts away the gun. charlie is still leaning against the desk, but there is a strange look on her face. a thin smile for haven. now she sags a little and haven realizes she has been hit. he starts to her and she turns away towards the couch. he catches her as she sags again, and helps her down gently on the couch. angle on couch as haven kneels beside her. he starts to pull away the top of her dress, but the wound is close to the heart. she shakes her head.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's no good...}
<A>__{haven knows it. he takes her hand and squeezes it.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i will get someone }
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{stay here.}
<A>__{haven stares grimly at her face. she gives him a faint smile.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{tell me something...}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{this gets us all. this doesn't count.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{tell me something on the square.}
<A>__{she holds herself tight a moment; then looks at him again, the faint smile returning.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{did you ever love me?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{all the time.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{tell it.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{from the first night and the first time of the song. i tried to get away from it, but every time it came back. every time i tried to get it out of my brain i just pushed it deeper into my heart. it had to be either you or me.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's all right. i love you...}
<P>__{(as he looks hard at her)}
<D>__{well say it.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{i love you.}
<A>__{she starts to die. he takes her shoulders in his hands as though to kiss her or hold her back to life. her voice is almost a whisper.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{see you... in china.}
<A>__{she goes, slumping back. he sits there, pats her shoulder in a familiar absent minded way, then slowly rises. grimly, haven walks out of the room. moving shot as haven goes down the stairway. the deaf pianist is playing as always.}
