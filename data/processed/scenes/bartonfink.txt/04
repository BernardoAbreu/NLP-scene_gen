<T>__{fade in:}
<B>__{a tenement building}
<A>__{on manhattan's lower east side. early morning traffic is audible.}
<B>__{barton}
<A>__{after a beat he rolls the sheet back into place.}
<L>__{extreme close shot}
<A>__{the letter strike area. it is lined up to the last period, which is struck over by a comma. the words "as is" are typed in and we cut back to}
<B>__{barton}
<A>__{as he continues typing. he stops after several more characters and looks. silence. breaking the silence, muffled laughter from an adjacent room. a man's laughter. it is weary, solitary, mirthless. barton looks up at the wall directly in front of him.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{the picture of the girl on the beach.}
<B>__{barton}
<A>__{staring, as the end of the tether laughing continues. barton looks back down at his typewriter as if to resume work, but the sound is too insistent to ignore.}
<B>__{wide shot}
<A>__{the room, barton sitting at his desk, staring at the wall. the laughter. barton pushes his chair back, goes to the door, opens it and looks out.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{the empty hallway, a pair of shoes before each door. at the end of the hall a dim red bulb burns over the door to the staircase, punctuating the sick yellow glow of the line of wall sconces. the laughter, though still faint, is more resonant in the empty hall. perhaps its quality has changed, or perhaps simply because it is so insistent, the laughter now might be taken for weeping. barton pauses, trying to interpret the sound. he slowly withdraws into his room.}
<B>__{his room}
<A>__{barton looks down at his typewriter for a beat. the laughter weeping continues. he walks over to his bed, sits down and picks up the house phone.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{hello... chet? this is barton fink in room 605. yes, there's uh, there's someone in the room next door to mine, 604, and he's uh... he's uh... making a lot of... noise.}
<A>__{after a beat:}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{...thank you.}
<A>__{he cradles the phone. the laughter continues for a moment or two, then abruptly stops with the muffled sound of the telephone ringing next door. barton looks at the wall. the muffled sound of a man talking. the sound of the earpiece being pronged. muffled footsteps next door. the sound of the neighbor's door opening and shutting. footsteps approaching the hall. a hard, present knock at barton's door. barton hesitates for a beat, then rises to go get the door.}
<B>__{on the door}
<A>__{as barton opens it. standing in the hall is a large man a very large man in short sleeves, suspenders, and loosened tie. his face is slightly flushed, with the beginnings of sweat.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{did you... somebody just complained...}
<A>__{hastily:}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{no, i didn't i mean, i did call down, not to complain exactly, i was just concerned that you might not that it's my business, but that you might be in some kind of... distress. you see, i was trying to work, and it's, well, it was difficult}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{yeah. i'm damn sorry, if i bothered you. the damn walls here, well, i just apologize like hell...}
<A>__{he sticks his hand out.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{...my name's charlie meadows. i guess we're neighbors...}
<A>__{without reaching for the hand.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{barton fink.}
<A>__{unfazed, charlie meadows unpockets a flask.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{neighbor, i'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{that's all right, really, thank you.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{all right, hell, you trying to work and me carrying on in there. look, the liquor's good, wuddya say?}
<A>__{as he enters:}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{... you got a glass? it's the least i can do.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{okay... a quick one, sure...}
<A>__{he gets two glasses from the wash basin. charlie sits down on the edge of the bed and uncorks his flask.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yeah, just a nip. i feel like hell, all the carryings on next door.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{that's okay, i assure you. it's just that i was trying to work}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what kind of work do you do, barton, if you don't mind my asking?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{well, i'm a writer, actually.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you don't say. that's a tough racket. my hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it. damned interesting work, i'd imagine.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{can be. not easy, but}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{damned difficult, i'd imagine.}
<A>__{as he hands charlie a glass:}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{and what's your line, mr. meadows?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hell no! call me charlie. well barton, you might say i sell peace of mind. insurance is my game door to door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.}
<A>__{he fills a glass with whiskey and swaps it for the empty glass.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{...in spite of what you might think from tonight, i'm pretty good at it.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{doesn't surprise me at all.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hell yes. because i believe in it. fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people that's what i tell 'em. writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. providing for basic human need a fella could do worse.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{thanks, i will keep it in mind.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what kind of scribbler are you newspaperman did you say?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{no, i'm actually writing for the pictures now}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{pictures! jesus!}
<A>__{he guffaws.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{...i'm sorry, brother, i was just sitting here thinking i was talking to some ambitious youngster, eager to make good. hell, you've got it made! writing for pictures! beating out that competition! and me being patronizing!}
<A>__{he gestures toward his face:}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{...is the egg showing or what?!}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{that's okay; actually i am just starting out in the movies though i was pretty well established in new york, some renown there,}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{oh, it's an exciting time then. i'm not the best read mug on the planet, so i guess it's no surprise i didn't recognize your name. jesus, i feel like a heel.}
<A>__{for the first time barton smiles.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{that's okay, charlie. i'm a playwright. my shows've only played new york. last one got a hell of a write up in the herald. i guess that's why they wanted me here.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hell, why not? everyone wants quality. what kind of venue, that is to say, thematically, uh...}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{what do i write about?}
<A>__{charlie laughs.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{caught me trying to be fancy! yeah, that's it, bart.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{well, that's a good question. strange as it may seem, charlie, i guess i write about people like you. the average working stiff. the common man.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{well ain't that a kick in the head!}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{yeah, i guess it is. but in a way, that's exactly the pointerior there's a few people in new york hopefully our numbers are growing who feel we have an opportunity now to forge something real out of everyday experience, create a theater for the masses that's based on a few simple truths not on some shopworn abstractions about drama that doesn't hold true today, if they ever did...}
<A>__{he gazes at charlie.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{...i don't guess this means much to you.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hell, i could tell you some stories}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{and that's the point, that we all have stories. the hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. it's the stuff of life why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater? goddamnit, why should that be a hard pill to swallow? don't call it new theater, charlie; call it real theater. call it our theater.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i can see you feel pretty strongly about it.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{well, i don't mean to get up on my high horse, but why shouldn't we look at ourselves up there? who cares about the fifth earl of bastrop and lady higginbottom and and and who killed nigel grinch gibbons?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i can feel my butt getting sore already.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{exactly, charlie! you understand what i'm saying a lot more than some of these literary types. because you're a real man!}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{and i could tell you some stories}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{sure you could! and yet many writers do everything in their power to insulate themselves from the common man from where they live, from where they trade, from where they fight and love and converse and and and... so naturally their work suffers, and regresses into empty formalism and well, i'm spouting off again, but to put it in your language, the theater becomes as phony as a three dollar bill.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yeah, i guess that's tragedy right there.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{frequently played, seldom remarked.}
<A>__{charlie laughs.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{whatever that means.}
<A>__{barton smiles with him.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{you're all right, charlie. i'm glad you stopped by. i'm sorry if well i know i sometimes run on.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hell no! jesus, i'm the kind of guy, i will let you know if i'm bored. i find it all pretty damned interesting. i'm the kind schmoe who's generally interested in the other guy's point of view.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{well, we've got something in common then.}
<A>__{charlie is getting to his feet and walking to the door.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{well christ, if there's any way i can contribute, or help, or whatever}
<A>__{barton chuckles and extends his hand.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{sure, sure charlie, you can help by just being yourself.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{well, i can tell you some stories}
<A>__{he pumps barton's hand, then turns and pauses in the doorway.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{...and look, i'm sorry as hell about the interruption. too much revelry late at night, you forget there are other people in the world.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{see you, charlie.}
<A>__{charlie closes the door and is gone. barton goes back to his desk and sits. muffled, we can hear the door of the adjacent room opening and closing. barton looks at the wall.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{the bathing beauty. from offscreen we hear a sticky, adhesive giving way sound.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{he looks around to the opposite bed wall.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{the wallpaper is lightly sheened with moisture from the heat. one swath of wallpaper is just finishing sagging away from the wall. about three feet of the wall, where it meets the ceiling, is exposed. the strip of wallpaper, its glue apparently melted, sags and nods above the bed. it glistens yellow, like a fleshy tropical flower.}
<B>__{back to barton}
<A>__{he goes over to the bed and steps up onto it. he smooths the wallpaper back up against the wall. he looks at his hand.}
<B>__{his hand}
<A>__{sticky with tacky yellow wall sweat. he wipes it onto his shirt. we hear a faint mosquito hum. barton looks around.}
