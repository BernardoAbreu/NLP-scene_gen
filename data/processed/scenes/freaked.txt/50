<L>__{interior freak house day}
<A>__{rick walks past the cubicles. in one, the bearded lady knits a sweater... he reaches cubicle 8, and is about to speak when he hears julie giggling. there is a man's voice, but not ernie's. it's juan. rick peeks around and sees julie scratching juan's belly. he licks her face happily, and she giggles with delight. ernie is reading "the woman's room," trying not to notice all of this. rick watches, disgusted. he tears up the pamphlet, throws it to the ground, and storms off to find his own cubicle. ernie peeks at julie and juan continuing their foreplay. juan stops abruptly.}
<C>__{juan}
<D>__{hey. mind your business.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{ernie returns to his book. the camera pans up to rick's cubicle. he's sitting on his cot, distractedly whittling a log with his knife like talon. he talks to himself, making sure to be loud enough for julieernie and juan to hear.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{well that ees guy should rescue me any minute. then it's straight to the plastic surgeon and back to sunny old l.a. i wonder how many of my beautiful, anatomically correct girlfriends will be waiting for me.}
<C>__{stuey gluck }
<D>__{i will be waiting for you, rick!}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{thanks, stuey.}
<A>__{rick looks up and sees a holographic image of stuey gluck floating in the air above him.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{ahh! a phantom troll!}
<A>__{he swings the log wildly at the hologram, but it keeps darting around, dodging the blows. cowboy leans around the cubicle wall. he talks a lot like gomer pyle.}
<C>__{cowboy}
<P>__{(neighborly)}
<D>__{seeing phantom trolls, rick?}
<C>__{rick}
<P>__{(innocently)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{rick stops swinging, lamely pretends he was stretching, and ignores stuey, who hovers around him.}
<C>__{cowboy}
<D>__{sounds to me like you've developed a telepathic bond. don't mean yer nuts or nuthin'. heck, old nosey, why he can smell the future. lots of us freaks got e.s.p. and sockhead, he's got e.s.p.n.}
<A>__{he points at sockhead, who's watching pro wrestling on a portable tv.}
<C>__{sockhead}
<D>__{watch out, hulk! he's gonna try the skull cracker!}
<C>__{cowboy}
<D>__{shucks, rick, you're lucky. telepathy like yours only occurs between real soulmates. a bond like that should be cherished.}
<A>__{cowboy smiles and ducks back into his own cubicle.}
<C>__{stuey}
<D>__{wow! i'm ricky coogan's soulmate!}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{in your dreams! now get lost, troll!}
<A>__{he swings wildly at the hologram, which starts to break up and fade away.}
<C>__{stuey}
<P>__{(fading away)}
<D>__{wait'll i tell the kids at school!}
<A>__{stuey disappears. cowboy leans into rick's cubicle again.}
<C>__{cowboy}
<D>__{shucksm rick, it don't make sense to spurn your soulmate. i reckon that troll could help you if you just let him into your heart.}
<A>__{rick scoffs at him and starts whittling again.}
