<L>__{exterior monrovia. night.}
<A>__{a montage of scenes from yuri's p.o.v. in his altered state. [a mixture of formats including super 8 & video, shaky handheld footage, over exposed footage, black & white footage edited out of sequence with jump cuts and flash frames] yuri staggers towards the edge of town still swigging from his bottle.}
<B>__{a room with a curved ceiling on the outskirts of monrovia}
<A>__{yuri, eyes unable to focus, stares at a woman's face in front of him, moving back and forth. the gyrating stops. yuri realizes he is lying in the mouth of an enormous cement pipe on his back, a prostitute on top of him. she gets to her feet, adjusting her dress. yuri panics, hurriedly zipping himself.}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(a mixture of french and english)}
<D>__{i didn't fuck you, did i? did i fuck you?}
<C>__{prostitute}
<P>__{(in french, as she counts yuri's money)}
<D>__{it's not what i would call a fuck.}
<A>__{the prostitute tosses a couple of bills back to him. yuri ignores the money, staggers after her.}

<A>__{she ignores him.}
<C>__{yuri }
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{are you sick?!}
<A>__{yuri staggers to his feet wanders aimlessly across a field.}
<B>__{a dance in dust somewhere on the outskirts of monrovia}
<A>__{two dozen pairs of feet chase each other on a dirt field to cheers from a crowd. the dust clears, revealing a bundle of cloth and string doubling as a soccer ball. the game is between two indistinguishable teams of monrovian youngsters on a makeshift dirt field, goalposts constructed from tree branches lashed together. yuri wanders onto the field, joins the game without asking. the players humor him by letting him have the ball. yuri dribbles up field, takes an enormous swipe at the ball, misses completely, clattering to the ground. the crowd and players laugh. the game goes on. yuri, also laughing but in a far more desperate manner, picks himself up and wanders away. a liberian bar called "zanzi bar" yuri throws up at the back of a saloon flimsily constructed from rusted corrugated iron. rinsing out his mouth with vodka, he is distracted by the sound of two little girls arguing.}
<P>__{girl #1 (o.c.)}
<D>__{they will!}
<P>__{girl #2 (o.c.)}
<D>__{they won't!}
<P>__{girl #1 (o.c.)}

<P>__{girl #2 (o.c.)}
<D>__{they won't! girl #1 they will! girl #2 ask the foreigner. the foreigner will know.}
<A>__{the girls approach yuri no older than seven, formal white dresses, hands politely behind their backs.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{hello. girl #1 sir, will my fingers grow back?}
<A>__{one of the girls shows yuri a healed stump where her hand should be. yuri runs away.}
<B>__{a modern sculpture somewhere in monrovia}
<A>__{yuri passes in front of an abstract arrangement of holes that turns out to be a building pock marked with gunshells. suddenly a face appears in one of the holes simeon. the gunshot wound in his forehead still evident. yuri gasps.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{simeon.}
<A>__{simeon turns and walks away revealing a large exit wound in the back of his head.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{simeon!!}
<A>__{yuri pokes his head through the hole but simeon has vanished. yuri turns back to find himself trapped by two men in flip flops, shorts, gap t shirts and ak 47's. through yuri's eyes the two men look like four. the two four men go through yuri's pockets, take his watch, shoes. yuri is oddly compliant clumsily helping one of the thieves fasten the watch. one of the men, tired of yuri's antics, aims his gun at yuri's head. his colleague stops him.}
<D>__{man #1 don't. he's andre's. man #2}
<P>__{(keeping his gun raised)}
<D>__{fuck andre.}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(seemingly beyond caring)}

<A>__{the man fires at yuri. the gun jams. yuri looks almost disappointed. the man tries again. again the gun jams.}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(referring to the gun)}

<P>__{(disgusted)}
<D>__{fuck off!}
<A>__{the man whips the gun across yuri's face.}
<B>__{a path outside monrovia}
<A>__{yuri, face streaked with blood and dirt, wanders aimlessly through the brush outside monrovia. a hyena appears on the dirt path in front of him teeth bared, frenzied eyes. yuri stares at the wild dog starts to quietly cry. tears roll down his cheeks. the hyena runs away. yuri is alone.}
