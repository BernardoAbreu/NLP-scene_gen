<L>__{interior backstage corridor same night}
<A>__{the sounds of the crowd pound thru the hallway. camera following jim reading a magazine article, accompanied by patricia kennealy past the techies, turning to look they go into empty shower room.}
<L>__{interior shower room same night}
<A>__{the crowd noise still carries, echoing. jim leads patricia to a quiet, isolated stall where they can be alone. tapping the magazine, sincerely moved by what he reads.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{"lord byron"? really. you think? you like the poems?}
<C>__{patricia}
<D>__{like? i loved them! "mad bad and dangerous to know." that's what they said about him. your poems should be taken as seriously.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{these are the kindest words i've ever heard in my life. no one has ever understood. thank you.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{maybe i should always fuck my critics.}
<C>__{patricia}
<D>__{y'know i don't even like rockers. they're sleazy. i made up my fuck list the other night out of 30 guys there were maybe three of them, y'know. i'm not a groupie.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(hotter, grabs her)}
<D>__{let's do it, here, now... with the sound of the crowd. like nuremberg, wild german fucking.}
<C>__{patricia}
<D>__{you like that hunh? beg!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i'm begging! i'm begging you!}
<C>__{patricia}
<D>__{you wanna fuck me, morrison, don't ever lie to me again. ever!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{about what!}
<C>__{patricia}
<D>__{your father. why do you tell me bullshit like your father's dead?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(pissed)}
<D>__{what's your problem with fathers! they're dead, both of them, i told you.}
<C>__{patricia}
<D>__{if he's so dead, then who answered the phone when i called the house?}
<A>__{jim a look, struck.}
<C>__{patricia}
<P>__{(knowing look)}
<D>__{you didn't really think you'd get away with that, morrison. an admiral in the united states navy. who's at the gulf of tonkin when vietnam starts. your dad's a deputy chief of operations.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what'd he say? that was really stupid. why didn't you just ask me.}
<C>__{patricia}
<D>__{well naturally he wasn't too happy when i called. your mom wanted to talk but he shut her off.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you're a fuckin' cunt. you could ruin his career if...}
<C>__{patricia}
<D>__{what, i'm a "fuckin' cunt" because i called the house? like it's hard to trace your school records. university of florida, albuquerque, new mexico, arlington, virginia, washington, d.c. brother, sister, it's seven miles long baby it's all in the "the end", it's so easy.}
<A>__{fingering his pants, her hand slips inside. teasing, dominating him. her dark side radiant.}
<C>__{patricia}
<D>__{don't ever try to hide anything from me again. okay? go on... tell me. did he make you cut your hair? did he hit you, was he a bully? did he love you? how much?}
<A>__{jim describes a small space between thumb and forefinger.}
<C>__{patricia}
<D>__{and your mother?}
<A>__{jim makes a little larger space.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i don't want to talk about it. hate is a very underestimated emotion.}
<A>__{his look is right at her. silence. patricia knows he won't talk. through the pause we hear the crowd chanting, bigger and bigger "morrison morrison morrison!" she's excited, wanting to make love here, now. he's cooled out, however.}
<C>__{patricia}
<D>__{it doesn't matter anymore does it. listen to them. it's you they want now. not the doors, not your mother or your father's child... they want you jim.}
<A>__{jim shakes his head, weary. suddenly he's scared inside.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you're wrong. what they want i can't give... my death ripped to pieces do you feel their power?}
<P>__{(the noise pounding)}
<C>__{patricia}
<D>__{you have no choice, jim. i see you up there like icarus. i see you flying closer and closer to the sun. and your wings are melting...}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i want to live, patricia. i don't wanna die.}
<A>__{jim's ironic eyes, to the ceiling. laden with a power to which he has married himself yet brave, resisting as she pulls his zipper down and goes to her knees in front of him. shaking his head.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{patricia... patricia...}
<A>__{a beefy cop stands there looking at them,}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{whatcha doing there?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{uh... nuthin'}
<C>__{cop}
<P>__{(approaching, suspicious)}
<D>__{okay, outta there both of you. no one's allowed backstage. let's go.}
<C>__{patricia}
<D>__{you idiot, don't you know who...}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{hey, i'm with the band man. it's cool. take it easy.}
<A>__{the cop has no patience, grabs jim by the arm and pulls. jim shoves him off. the cop pushes back. a shoving match.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{let's go. now! you're both under arrest.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(pointing to his crotch, angry)}
<D>__{hey, eat it man!}
<A>__{the cop whips out a black can from his belt, sprays jim.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{mace! shit!}
<P>__{(in pain)}
<A>__{patricia screaming at the cop grabs jim, propelling him violently out the stall of the bathroom.}
