<L>__{ext prison yard day (1966)}
<A>__{red finds andy sitting in the shadow of the high stone wall, poking listlessly through the dust for small pebbles. red waits for some acknowledgment. andy doesn't even look up. red hunkers down and joins him. nothing is said for the longest time. and then, softly:}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{my wife used to say i'm a hard man to know. like a closed book. complained about it all the time.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{she was beautiful. i loved her. but i guess i couldn't show it enough.}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{i killed her, red.}
<A>__{andy finally glances to red, seeking a reaction. silence.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{i didn't pull the trigger. but i drove her away. that's why she died. because of me, the way i am.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{that don't make you a murderer. bad husband, maybe.}
<A>__{andy smiles faintly in spite of himself. red gives his shoulder a squeeze.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{feel bad about it if you want. but you didn't pull the trigger.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{no. i didn't. someone else did, and i wound up here. bad luck, i guess.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{bad luck? jesus.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{it floats around. has to land on somebody. say a storm comes through. some folks sit in their living rooms and enjoy the rain. the house next door gets torn out of the ground and smashed flat. it was my turn, that's all. i was in the path of the tornado.}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{i just had no idea the storm would go on as long as it has.}
<P>__{(glances to him)}
<D>__{think you'll ever get out of here?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{sure. when i got a long white beard and about three marbles left rolling around upstairs.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{tell you where i'd go. zihuatanejo.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{zihuatanejo?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{mexico. little place right on the pacific. you know what the mexicans say about the pacific? they say it has no memory. that's where i'd like to finish out my life, red. a warm place with no memory. open a little hotel right on the beach. buy some worthless old boat and fix it up like new. take my guests out charter fishing.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you know, a place like that, i'd need a man who can get things.}
<A>__{red stares at andy, laughs.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{jesus, andy. i couldn't hack it on the outside. been in here too long. i'm an institutional man now. like old brooks hatlen was.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{you underestimate yourself.}
<A>__{ }
<C>__{red}
<D>__{bullshit. in here i'm the guy who can get it for you. out there, all you need are yellow pages. i wouldn't know where to begin.}
<P>__{(derisive snort)}
<D>__{pacific ocean? hell. like to scare me to death, somethin' that big.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{not me. i didn't shoot my wife and i didn't shoot her lover, and whatever mistakes i made i've paid for and then some. that hotel and that boat...i don't think it's too much to want. to look at the stars just after sunset. touch the sand. wade in the water. feel free.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{goddamn it, andy, stop! don't do that to yourself! talking shitty pipedreams! mexico's down there, and you're in here, and that's the way it is!}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{you're right. it's down there, and i'm in here. i guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. get busy living or get busy dying.}
<A>__{red snaps a look. what the hell does that mean? andy rises and walks away. red lunges to his feet.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{andy?}
<C>__{andy}
<P>__{(turns back)}
<D>__{red, if you ever get out of here, do me a favor. there's this big hayfield up near buxton. you know where buxton is?}
<C>__{red}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{lots of hayfields there.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{one in particular. got a long rock wall with a big oak at the north end. like something out of a robert frost poem. it's where i asked my}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{wife to marry me. we'd gone for a picnic. we made love under that tree. i asked and she said yes.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{promise me, red. if you ever get out, find that spot. in the base of that wall you'll find a rock that has no earthly business in a maine hayfield. a piece of black volcanic glass. you'll find something buried under it i want you to have.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{what? what's buried there?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{you'll just have to pry up that rock and see.}
<A>__{andy turns and walks away.}
