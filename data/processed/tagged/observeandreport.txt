<L>__{exterior mall day}
<A>__{heavy metal music. a group of anarchist skaters rages through the mall parking lot tearing up everything they see. a couple of them smoke cigarettes. one skater grinds over a bench. one kid ollies onto the hood of a car. another slams into an old man and knocks him over. meanwhile, ronnie sits in his golf cart waiting. he looks eerily like mel gibson at the beginning of mad max. the skaters ride past a set of construction cones. one skater picks up the cone and tosses it across the parking lot. the skaters soar past ronnie, who flips on the silent orange siren and gives chase. as the skaters ride through the parking lot, ronnie pulls up and drives alongside of them.}

<D>__{ronnie, i hear what you're saying and i just want you to know that personally, it pains me to see you all worked up and i just want you to know that i'm really sorry because you can't do shit and you can take your little rules and stick'em up your ass, you fuckin' rent a cop.}

<A>__{the skaters start laughing.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<P>__{(into walkie)}

<C>__{ronnie}

<A>__{ronnie takes his pad out of his pocket. he begins writing.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{while i won't have you arrested today, i am going to suspend each of you for one week. for those of you who don't know how this works, here it is. this is official documentation. if you step foot on mall property, it is considered trespassing. at that point, i call the police, they come down, you go directly to jail.}
<A>__{ronnie fills out the paperwork, sets the suspension notes on the table. stevie looks down at it. he picks it up, reads it, balls it up, and throws it at ronnie. the skaters start cracking up.}

<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you know, the usual. spot crime before it happens, perform random acts of bravery, save people from certain death, yada yada yada.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{what's wrong, ronnie?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{nothing, nell.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{ronnie, i know that you really want to be a police officer, but you have to realize that things work out the way they're meant to.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i know. i'm okay, nell. thanks, but really, i mean, i'm on the front lines right now. i'm livin' it.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{your job is definitely more exciting than mine.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{of course it is, but at least you don't have to wrestle with the demons at night. i better get going.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{i will see you after work, sweetie.}
<A>__{nell leans in to kiss ronnie, but he pulls away.}
<C>__{ronnie}

<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i've been looking all over for you.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i haven't been hiding, but some things that i have to do are better to keep hidden from you and 'official' eyes. trust me, it's best all around if there are no bodies to clean up.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{so you may or may not have heard, but this morning, several women were assaulted just outside the front doors by a crazy pervert.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{for the love of god.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i know, it's horrible.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you want me to phone this one in to the police?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{not just yet. see if we call the police, they'll be a big scandal and something like that could kill what little traffic we have at this mall. what i need you to do is watch out for this pervert and if you see him, try to stop him or quietly phone it in so we can handle this discreetly.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{hold on, mark. let me make sure i understand you. you're telling me to deny my primary objective of observing and reporting crime and at the same time, you're giving me authorization to handle this case on my own.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm just saying keep an eye out and keep quiet.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{so basically, i'm in charge of this whole investigation.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{there's no investigation.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{not yet. okay, mark, i will do it, but i'm gonna need a few things first.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you can't carry a gun.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{well, i'm gonna need a new title. something to instill fear in the criminal mind. how about director of mall intelligence?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{head of mall security.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{that's perfect.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{and it doesn't come with a raise.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{got it.}

<D>__{well, i'm sure you will. it's actually pretty huge news. but the reason i stopped by is to tell you that it looks like we've got a pervert on the loose. a real live psychopath who gains sexual gratification by exposing himself to ladies such as yourself. i just want to warn you to be careful when coming and going to work.}

<D>__{you working the door here?}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{that's what they tell me. they needed to hire a little security here in case the drunks get out of line or whatever.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{kind of funny they thought they needed more security here. ha. you do realize that if anyone gets out of hand, you need to call me to handle the situation.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{i work for o'charley's, not for the mall.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{granted, but you realize that my jurisdiction supersedes any and all other forms of security when under the roof of carolina mall?}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{you know, i thought about getting a job as a mall security.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you did?}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{yeah, man. i mean, i'm kind of on extended vacation from college and it's just like, i don't want to do shit, you know what i mean? my parents said i have to work if i want to live at home, but i just don't feel like doing anything. this was the easiest job i could find, i mean, what the hell could be hard about being a bouncer in a mall restaurant? but now that i think about it, mall security could be easier than this.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{my young friend, you are sorely mistaken. do you know how much stuff i'm in charge of?}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{a shitload. that's not even counting the parking lot.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{really? i thought you just kind of chilled out and called stuff into the police.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{no way, that's about like 75, maybe 82 percent of it. there's so much other stuff.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{two words, friday night.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{what about it?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{it's crazy, let's just leave it at that.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{listen. i like you, but i don't like the fact that you're masquerading as an official in the security world. if you're serious about a career in the security world, then perhaps i could look into getting you a job on my staff?}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{oh yeah?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{part of my job is reaching out to troubled youths such as yourself. it's who i am.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{does it pay more than $6.50 an hour?}
<A>__{ronnie laughs. he leans over to the bouncer and whispers in his ear.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{seven even.}
<A>__{ronnie stands back and winks at the bouncer.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{i'd say that's more than i'm making now.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{hold on, this job involves a probationary period. you have to prove yourself worthy. we can't just hire any old tom, dick, or harry just because they want to carry a flashlight.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{what do i have to do?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you have to complete a term as deputy. you will answer directly to me. your job will be to come and find me if you see any trouble. if this works out, then i will phone the crime into the police. now, this will train your eyes to spot various criminal activity. once you have completed your training, you will be awarded an official position on my security staff where you will have the duty of actually phoning in crimes to the police yourself.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{so basically, i just do what i'm doing now and then you'll get me a job?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{for starters.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{how long does this mentorship last?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{until mark lets me hire another guy.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{can i smoke while i work?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{yes, you can.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{sign me up.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you keep that attitude up and you'll have no problem making the squad.}
<A>__{ronnie reaches into his pocket and hands the bouncer a mini flashlight.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{it's a flashlight. get to know it. it's your new best friend. until you get your giant flashlight. then, that will be your new best friend.}
<A>__{the bouncer takes it and puts it into his shirt pocket.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{okay, look alive, soldier. deputy time starts now. no more slacker attitude for you.}
<A>__{ronnie walks away, but after he takes a few steps, he stops and turns.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you know, i remember when i got my first flashlight...}
<A>__{ronnie goes into an emotional memory in his mind. ronnie walks away leaving the bouncer there alone.}
<L>__{exterior mall day}
<A>__{loud rock score fades to loud rock source. a tricked out toyota pulls up to the parking lot. the car comes to a stop and out steps brandi, the makeup counter girl. brandi walks toward the mall to start her new day. as she crosses the parking lot and heads toward the door, the pervert pops out. this time, he's upped his attack and beats off staring right at her. the horrendous sight stops brandi dead in her tracks. she screams bloody murder...}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior department store day}
<A>__{it looks like a rape scene. brandi cries in the makeup chair and is surrounded by a large group of mall employees. her makeup runs down her face as her effeminate coworker bruce consoles her. mark is working crowd control.}

<P>__{(to the crowd)}
<D>__{alright, people, she's doing good. we're just gonna get her down to my office and everything's going to be fine, so the best thing for you employees to do is just get on back to your stations and you customers can go ahead and enjoy the back to school savings here at carolina mall.}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{it was horrible! oh, my god, the thought of that disgusting i think i'm going to be sick.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{just let it out, baby. he should be ashamed!}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{i just keep playing it over and over again in my head.}

<A>__{the department store manager comes running over.}
<C>__{department store manager}

<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{a pervert attacked brandi is what's going on!}
<C>__{department store manager}
<D>__{are you okay, brandi?}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{physically, yes. but psychologically, no!}

<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{did you call the cops?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{they're on the way.}
<A>__{brandi starts crying even louder.}
<C>__{department store manager}
<D>__{yeah, we got to get her the fuck out of here. everybody's standing around and nobody's shopping. this is bad for business.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm trying, but she just keeps crying.}
<A>__{ronnie comes running up on the scene. he looks like a man who ran a mile to get here.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{brandi! i came as soon as i heard. jesus, are you alright?}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{i'm fine, ronnie.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{she's fine, ronnie.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{this is one of the most heinous things i've seen. jesus, i tried to tell you about the skirts. it's not your fault, you little fighter you. ronnie's not mad, okay?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{ronnie, can you get her down to my office so the police can talk to her in private when they arrive.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{rogers.}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{i can't walk right now. i feel like i'm in shock.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{don't worry. i will carry you.}

<C>__{mark}
<D>__{oh, fucking jesus.}
<A>__{ronnie finally manages to lift brandi. he carries her out of the department store and down through the middle of the mall.}
<L>__{exterior mall day}
<A>__{a black unmarked police car pulls up quickly and stops directly in front of the main entrance to the mall as if to say to the world, "i'm a cop and i can do this." out steps detective harrison, a young cop that has the arrogance and swagger of a man who is just beginning to feel his power.}
<L>__{interior mall manager's office day}
<A>__{mark sits at his desk, while ronnie comforts a crying brandi. dennis stands in the corner, not saying a word. detective harrison knocks as he comes in the door.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{your secretary told me to come on in. i'm detective harrison, cabarrus county police.}
<A>__{detective harrison shows his badge to mark. the two men shake.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{mark talbert, i manage the mall. this is brandi, she's the one who saw the deviant.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{hello, brandi. are you doing okay?}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{i'm really shaken up.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{yes, ma'am, i'm sure you are after all you've been through, but i'm here to tell you that we're going to work together to make sure we catch the person who did this.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{my name is ronnie barnhardt, chief inspector on the case and head of mall security here at carolina mall and this is my lieutenant, dennis. from one law enforcement officer to another, i just want to welcome you and say that we will do whatever it takes to coordinate with your department in order to bring this assailant to justice.}
<A>__{the detective pauses as if he's unsure what just happened.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{great.}
<P>__{(back to brandi)}
<D>__{okay, brandi. did you get a look at the suspect?}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{yes, i did.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{did you get a blood sample?}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{that's a shame. would have been useful.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{go ahead, detective.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{thank you. brandi, can you remember anything specifically? what color was his hair? was he tall or short?}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{he was tall and skinny and he had brown hair and it was real greasy.}
<A>__{detective harrison begins writing in his note pad as brandi speaks. ronnie notices this and picks up some paper and begins to write as well.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{was his hair long or short?}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{it was long about to his shoulders.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{did he say anything?}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{no, he just stood there and you know, touched himself.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{what was he wearing?}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{just a brown trench coat.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{this is what i got so far.}
<A>__{ronnie holds up his paper. ronnie has drawn a crude sketch of the pervert that brandi described, but it's basically a long haired stick figure with a penis.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{what's yours look like?}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{i just wrote a description.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{ronnie puts his sketch away.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{okay, brandi, i think that's good for now. i think the best thing at this point is to just follow up with the other ladies who saw the perpetrator yesterday and see if they remember anything.}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{what if he comes back?}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{that's highly unlikely. these incidents are usually random and unpredictable. i'm sure you'll be safe.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i'm afraid i'm going to have to disagree with you there, detective. by my math, it seems pretty clear that brandi's been targeted.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{targeted? what gives you that impression?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{well, how about the fact that she was the first employee to get assaulted? not to mention the fact that she is the prettiest girl who works at this mall. to me it seems obvious that this is some sort of methodical villain that plans on returning to finish what he started by murdering brandi.}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{is that going to happen?!}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{that's not going to happen.}
<A>__{ronnie looks at brandi and nods his head "yes."}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{well don't worry. i'm on the case and i'm going to do everything in my power to bring this guy down.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{that's right, brandi, you've got the best team in law enforcement working for you.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{look, i've got to get going. here's my card. i will even write my home phone number on the back, just in the event you need to get a hold of me.}
<A>__{detective harrison writes his number on the back and then hands his card to brandi.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{give me a call when you aren't working and i will have you come to the station to look through some mug shots.}
<P>__{(touches her leg)}
<D>__{don't worry okay.}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{i feel a lot better now.}
<A>__{ronnie holds out his hand.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i will take one of those cards as well.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{oh, okay.}
<A>__{detective harrison reluctantly hands ronnie a card.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{go ahead and write your home phone on there as well in case i need to get a hold of you.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{you can just leave a message at the station. i check my messages constantly.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{sorry, but i'm gonna need those digits. if we're gonna solve this crime we need to constantly be in communication with each other and have an open door policy with intelligence. brandi, let me see that card.}
<A>__{ronnie takes the car from brandi and copies the home phone number from the back.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{cool, i will call you later with an update.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{don't do that.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{it's no problem at all. we're brothers of the badge. this is what we do for each other.}
<A>__{detective harrison takes off. ronnie looks around happily.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{seems like a good guy. a little green, but still solid.}
<L>__{interior mall night}
<A>__{the mall is winding down for the day and most of the customers have gone home. ronnie walks through the mall, taping up pictures of the sketch he made of the pervert. nell comes walking up with her apron over her shoulder.}

<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{just putting these posters up.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{you've been so obsessed with catching this pervert i've barely seen you.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{that's what it's like when you date the head of mall security. the downside is we don't get to see each other as much, but the upside is you get to brag to all your friends.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{well, are you ready to go?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{sure, let's take off.}
<L>__{interior ronnie's living room night}
<A>__{the local news is on and they show an update on the mall flasher story. the sound is off. the living room is dark. ronnie and nell are on the couch making out. ronnie is starting to get frisky. his hands go to nell's boobs, but only outside of the shirt. she allows it. ronnie decides to push it. he takes his hand and tries to go up her shirt. nell immediately stops kissing and pushes ronnie away.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{what are you doing, ronnie?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{come on, let me get some of those big bazoombas.}
<A>__{ronnie goes in hard for the tits, but nell pushes him away.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{ronnie, no.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{goddamn it, are we ever gonna do it?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{you know we talked about this.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{we did, it's just, well, i'm tired of just doing what we do. i'm ready for something bigger. like sex or just maybe using a finger on you }
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{ronnie, you know i'm saving myself for marriage. i thought you were okay with that.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{well, i used to be, it's just. i don't know. what's so great about being a 27 year old virgin?}
<A>__{nell stands up and starts to put on her coat. ronnie stands up and tries to comfort her.}

<D>__{i've already checked the security tapes. they didn't catch a thing. someone must have broken in here and turned them off.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{my team just checked all the doors and there are no signs of forced entry. i've also checked out the crime scene, but we didn't see any fingerprints on the glass. the suspect was probably wearing gloves.}

<D>__{that doesn't sound good. how did they do it?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{laser technology.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{my guess it was an inside job. probably someone who has access to keys like a janitor or a security guard.}

<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{i'm almost at the end of my first year.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{just as i thought, a rookie.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{i've been a police officer for several years.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{yeah, you're a rookie, okay. it's fine, you'll learn with experience. and when you do, you'll discover that rule #1 of law enforcement is that you don't ever turn on a fellow officer. now, i know you would never actually accuse somebody on my security force of committing this act of lawlessness.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{whoever did this would have to had keys to the security room so they could shut off the camera.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{look, my record speaks for itself and as for dennis, well i can certainly vouch for him. dennis is one of the finest men i know, so just take my word, you're barking up the wrong tree. now, let's put this little squabble behind us and get back to busting the guys that robbed this mall.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{ronnie, nobody is accusing anybody, but i would like to stick around for a while and interview some of the employees.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{okay, but all i ask is that you do it quietly, so that the hoopla is kept to a minimum.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{i understand.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i understand too, sir.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{ronnie, you are to leave detective harrison alone and let him handle the investigation.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{no can do, mark. when you appointed me head of mall security, i swore an oath to protect this mall and aid in bringing crime to its knees.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you didn't swear an oath.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{to myself i did.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{ronnie, on these types of investigations, it's usually not a good idea to have too many cooks in the kitchen.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{there's only one cook. i'm a chef. a cook and chef, together, serving up justice.}
<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{i'm gonna do this alone.}

<D>__{okay, dennis. i've gotta hang with detective harrison.}
<C>__{ronnie }
<D>__{what i need for you to understand is that just because detective harrison is here, doesn't mean that you and me are no longer best friends. sure, harrison would be cool to hang out with. he carries a badge and a gun. he probably owns a boat. over time, we'll probably become really close like brothers, but for right now, you're still number one. now, i must leave you behind because duty calls, so... chin up. radio if you need anything.}

<D>__{so you're just gonna let him slip right through your fingers?}
<C>__{detective harrison}

<C>__{ronnie}

<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{look, i'm sure you and your little friend have made a real lifestyle for yourselves here. it's probably easy for you to blind most men with your beauty, but i'm not most men. i can see through the sexuality to the truth. jewelry, gold, diamonds, you don't really expect me to think that a man wants that crap. i'm putting you on my list of top suspects. i don't think you did the crime, but i do think you are an accomplice.}

<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{but i got to tell you, dennis. it was steamy and sexy, but more than anything, i should tell you that it's her soul that i fell for the most. she got pretty tanked, but i could just really tell that she's a good person. the kind of person that i could see myself with.}

<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{what color of roses do the women like anyway?}
<C>__{flower salesman}
<D>__{well, it depends on what you are trying to say. the white roses symbolize innocence and purity.}

<D>__{i've only been on one date with her, but i could see myself being with her for all of eternity.}
<C>__{flower salesman}
<D>__{well, in that case, the greatest symbol of love is just a single red rose.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{seems like a big bag of roses would be more love than just one, but i guess you're the expert. gimme one.}

<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{okay, see here's the thing. i don't know how to say this, so i'm just gonna come on out with it. ronnie, i could never date you seriously. i mean, you're a security guard.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i'm the head of mall security.}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{exactly. the point is, i don't really see myself being with that. like ever. you know what i mean?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{brandi, i know exactly what you mean. and i just want to thank you for being honest. you're telling me i'm not living up to my full potential in life. it's funny, because i've been feeling like this for quite some time. i guess i just needed that extra little push to get me over this hurdle i've been stuck on. how can you be with a man who isn't living the life he was meant to?}
<C>__{brandi}
<D>__{yeah, something like that. and just you know, you're a security guard at the mall and it's like, come on, you know?}

<D>__{don't bet on it.}

<C>__{policeman }
<D>__{if you pass these tests, you will be admitted to the police academy. now, i like to tell all new recruits that they should complete a ride along before making this decision. it's where you actually ride along with a real police officer during a routine patrol. it helps give you an idea of the kind of situations you'll be dealing with. sound good?}

<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i know. you want to know the truth. it's because i respect you. see, when we're at the mall, it's obviously my turf. sure, i break your balls about being a rookie, but out here in the streets, i'm the rookie. i'm here to learn. teach me.}

<D>__{well, just pay attention tonight and make sure you stay out of the way.}

<C>__{detective harrison}
<D>__{no, no. ronnie, policy says you have to stay in the car.}
<C>__{ronnie}

<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{yeah, i see it.}

<D>__{local boy. okay, and, ronnie, have you ever been convicted of any crimes?}

<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{do you now take any illegal drugs or have you taken any in the past?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{no, ma'am. i believe drugs are the path to self destruction and should be purged from the face of the earth with ruthless vengeance.}
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{any prescription medications?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{yes, for my nerves. a man in my line of work has a lot of stress to deal with. if you've seen the bloodshed i've seen, you'd be on the meds too. i where are you going with this?}

<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{would i? yes. would i be more useful working alone, i would say definitely. i see myself more like a rambo kind of guy. a man who rolls solo. taking care of business on his own terms. kind of like a superhero or something.}
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{why do you want to become a cop?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i want to become a cop to help people. the world is a scary place with lots of evil everywhere. see, i have this vision of evil trying to get at the world from every angle and there i stand at the top of it all with my gun, just kind of blowing it away. just me and my weapons, cleaning up this whole town. i know i could do some good if i was just given a chance and everybody would be a lot better off.}
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{uh huh. so, what do you feel is the greatest danger facing a police officer today?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{maybe russian gang activity, but you know what? i think i'm gonna have to go with evil on that one too.}

<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{nothing. that's exactly what you're supposed to do. i just blew my life. i tried to be a big shot, a hero and a stupid cop. i wanted to be recognized for being great. i should have just been happy where i was at. i didn't do my duty.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{ronnie, the other night when i soiled my pants right before i puked myself, i was thinking about how you would come home and find me and clean me up. i knew you would be there to find me and take care of me, so i was able to pass out on the floor and not worry. if there's one thing you know about, it's duty.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i do it because i love you.}
