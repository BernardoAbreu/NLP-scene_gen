<A>__{a patch of water. pull back to reveal more water. back farther to reveal an expanse of river, up the bank to massive lawn running up to a great, classic hudson river manor house; the country estate of william parrish.}
<L>__{interior parrish country estate 4:00 am}
<A>__{move through french doors that lead from a wide terrace into an expansive living room, down wide corridors lined with bierstadt and cole paintings, the hudson river school, mists and trees and small boats and distant humans.}
<L>__{interior parrish bedroom 4:00 am}
<A>__{move through the doorway to reveal a master bedroom furnish ed with exquisite simplicity, revelatory of its sleeping occupant, william parrish, 64, a warm but commanding face, a man of maturity yet who exudes a glow of enthusiasm. although asleep, there is an uncommon restlessness to him. parrish grips his upper arm as if in pain. now the severity of the pain wakes him, he squeezes his arm. the wind comes up, through the wind a voice is heard distantly, or is it the wind itself:}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{... yes.}
<A>__{parrish blinks, has he heard something, has he not, he is not sure, he releases his arm, his grimace of pain fades, the discomfort seems momentarily to have subsided. he rises now, crosses to the bathroom. as he pees, a breeze outside the window, the wind again, but then the voice comes up:}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{yes...}
<A>__{it is unmistakably a voice, it is not the wind, parrish has heard something, he looks around, but no one is there. he can't finish peeing, turns back to his bedroom. all beweild ered, parrish looks around once more, climbs back into bed, trying to trace the source of what he has heard or hasn't heard; he is not sure. he pulls the covers up now, not a sound, tries to close his eyes.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{parrish sits up again, frightened, but still there is no one there, he seems fraught with indecision, should he get up, should he not, what is happening? he looks out: absolute stillness and silence, crickets chirp down by the river, a light flickers from a shadboat, parrish closes his eyes but then they flutter open, he glances up at the ceiling and finally, exhausted, falls back asleep.}
