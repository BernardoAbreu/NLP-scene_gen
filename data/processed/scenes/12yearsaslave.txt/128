<L>__{exterior epps's plantation day}
<A>__{ may june, 1847 we come up now outside of master epps's plantation. epps stands in the drive. he's in surprisingly good spirits as solomon, uncle abram, henry and bob trudge their way wearily toward epps and his other slaves who are gathered. the cotton field is in full bloom, the crop fully returned.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{a joyous day. a joyous day. dark times is behind us. clean livin' 'n prayer done lifted the plague.}
<A>__{indicating to the cotton:}
<C>__{epps }
<D>__{as thick 'n white as new england snow. 'n now my niggers is returned to me.}
<P>__{(to solomon)}
<D>__{heard judge turner gave you favor. oh, did you beguile him, platt, with your slick nigger ways? well, yah won't stand idle, boy. not on my land. much work to do. days of old long since, eh? joyous! joyous indeed!}
<A>__{throughout epps's welcome, solomon's focus is on patsey who is lined up with the other slaves. she is now more haggard than when we last saw her. her face and arms display many new scars. it's clear that in the intervening years she has quite literally been a whipping boy for epps and the mistress.}
