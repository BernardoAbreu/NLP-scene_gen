<L>__{interior cafeteria abandoned prison evening}
<A>__{ramirez sits as before. he is eating his caviar as he looks at his arabic textbook. angle on the textbook it shows a picture of a street in an arab country, possibly libya. it is a typical street scene; a dispassionately sterile photograph in which one can almost hear the bbc announcer voice in your head saying, "and here is a typical scene in lovely tripoli..." there is a man in a business suit walking on the sidewalk in this picture. we cut : back and forth between ramirez and then as ramirez strains to look harder, unbelievingly, we push in tighter on the picture from his pov and to our amazement, the man in the picture looking back up at us is ramirez! then suddenly the man in the picture moves and his finger comes up to his lips and he looks at us and says, "shhhhh." just then, a street vendor in the same scene pulls out a gun and shoots ramirez in the picture in the head. ramirez falls and the picture goes back to a still shot of ramirez lying face down in the black and white photo, oozing black blood onto the white sidewalk of beautiful downtown tripoli. he looks out the window at the bluish sky as we shift focus between him and his background. he looks down at the bowl of porridge. angle on the caviar it is crawling with ants.}
