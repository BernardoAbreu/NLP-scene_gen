<L>__{exterior house same}
<A>__{tommy conlon (28), hard miles on a handsome face, sits on the stoop of an old row house in a wool watch cap and winter coat. a duffel bag is at his feet, a bottle of whiskey in a brown bag in his hands. he reaches into his coat pocket, pops a handful of prescription pills, and stares off into the approaching night.}

<A>__{paddy pulls up to the curb in front of the house, clicks off the tape, kills the engine, and climbs out of the car. as he approaches the stairs, paddy sees tommy. can't believe his eyes.}
