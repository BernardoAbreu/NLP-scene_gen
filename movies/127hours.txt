1   EXT. CROWD SCENES. TRIPTYCHS.                                 1

    Black. A roaring, like the sea crashing against the shore, growing
    louder.

    The screen is split into three vertical panels. A triptych.

    Sometimes the scenes on the panels will be different,
    sometimes repeated images and sometimes the panels will merge
    into one screen. But always, the theme is the crowd, people,
    humanity, us.

    The panels explode with people as a Mexican wave erupts in a
    football stadium. Tens of thousands of fans rise and fall around
    the arena.

    More crowds; thousands and thousands of baseball fans rise as one
    to their feet, roaring their approval at an unseen strike.

    An army of adoring music fans stretch their yearning hands towards
    an unseen singer on stage.

    Even more crowds fill the panels. The throng of a million pilgrims
    at the Kumbh Mela, a flash mob in Victoria Station, a crowded
    dealing floor at the stock market, a million Catholics in St
    Peter’s Square...




2   INT. ARON’S HOUSE. BEDROOM/ HALL/ LIVING ROOM. NIGHT.         2

    Mixed into the triptychs of endless humanity, a lone shadow
    crosses one of the panels. We are in a bedroom that could belong
    to a student. Then, a phone rings. Shocking in this silent world.
    The camera stops then moves through the house, the camera our POV.

    The camera stops in the doorway of the living room where the phone
    is ringing. Eventually, the answer-phone clicks in.

                        PHONE
              Hi, Aron here! Leave a message.

    Business-like. We can’t get any kind of a fix on Aron’s
    personality from this.

                        PHONE (CONT’D)
              Hey, Aron, Sonja here. Again. I
              know you’re probably gonna be away
              this weekend but listen think about
              what we’re gonna play. Please,
              because we have to decide and
              practice. It will be fun, I
              promise. Oh, and please call Mom,
              she’ll be worried. Later, A. Bye!


    The phone rings off, leaving nothing but a flashing red light in
    the dark room. The camera moves back down the hall into the
    bedroom again. We are its eyes.




3   INT. ARON’S HOUSE. NIGHT.                                  3

    Then a hand reaches high and opens a cupboard door. Picks up a
    mini cam-corder off a high shelf. Drops it in a back-pack. Reaches
    in again, gets a climbing harness. The jingle of carabiners. The
    hand clips a descender onto a loop on the harness. A Camelbak
    pouch of water, another water bottle. All drop in the rucksack.

    The hand gropes blindly around the high shelf. Looking for
    something else, something out of sight. We see a Swiss Army Knife
    at the back of the shelf. His hand skims past it a couple of
    times, millimeters away. Misses it.

    Clearly giving up on this, the hand picks up a coil of climbing
    rope, moves into another room. We move with the hand, not seeing
    the person, just his efficient intent.




4   INT. ARON’S HOUSE. KITCHEN. NIGHT.                         4

    Cluttered surfaces. The hand reaches up, grabs a burrito wrapped
    in a transparent sandwich bag, goes into a cupboard and takes
    three energy bars, a bottle of Gatorade. The hand shuts the
    cupboard, skims the messy surface, picks up a grapefruit on the
    way past and moves towards the door. We hear a door shut. A key
    turn. The sound of a truck door opening and shutting. An engine
    starts with a roar.




5   INT. ARON’S TRUCK. NIGHT.                                  5

    We are inside a 98 red Toyota Tacoma with a topper. It drives down
    the silent Aspen Main Street. From the point of view of the
    driver, we look to left and right, see the security lights from
    various shop fronts, the empty streets. Still, we do not see the
    driver.




6   EXT. ROAD. NIGHT.                                          6

    The only vehicle on the road, the Toyota turns off the Main Street
    and heads into the dark.


7    INT. ARON’S TRUCK. NIGHT.                                     7

     A hand slips a CD into the truck’s player. Music booms out.

     For the first time, we see the owner of the truck: Aron Ralston,
     27. We study his face for clues. Fit, tanned by the wind, not the
     beach. Not giving much away.

     The screen splits into two and then three, though at times there
     appears to be no division at all.

8    A title card reads:                                           8

     “Utah. The Canyonlands. The slickrock desert. The red dust and the
     burnt cliffs and the lonely sky - all that which lies beyond the
     end of the roads.”

     Edward Abbey. Desert Solitaire.


9    EXT. ROAD. NIGHT.                                             9

     Aron’s truck drives alone on the interstate road.


10   EXT. VARIOUS COMMERCIALS FOOTAGE.                            10

     Billboards, TV, cinema, www: commercial America sells everything
     to us through every means. As many brand names as we can get.


11   INT. ARON’S TRUCK. NIGHT.                                    11

     At the south-west edge of Green River, Aron drives under the
     interstate into a landscape of obscurity. He looks to his right
     and left. Not a single light perforates the absolute blackness of
     the San Rafael Desert.


12   EXT. CITY. FREEWAY. NIGHT.                                   12

     Overhead shot of a busy city freeway at night. The speeded up
     headlights blurring into a thousand strings of shimmering
     luminescence.


13   EXT. ARON’S TRUCK. NIGHT.                                    13

     Three quarters of the screen is black. All we see are truck lights
     running parallel with the darkness.


14   INT. ARON’S TRUCK. NIGHT.                                    14

     Out of the black, a sign rears up. Next Service 110 miles.


15   EXT. ARON’S TRUCK. NIGHT.                                 15

     America’s challengers for the Tour de France flash by: a pack of
     15 or so neon spirits. Night training.


     C/U: watch.

     A huge close-up of a sports watch. One of those chunky ones with
     both analogue watch hands and a digital cut-in. The minute hand
     makes a loud click as it hits the top of its arc. 10PM.


16   EXT. ROAD. NIGHT.                                         16

     A BLM sign indicates that Horseshoe Canyon Trailhead is 47 miles
     ahead through the desert darkness.


17   EXT. ARON’S TRUCK. NIGHT.                                 17

     The truck skids to a halt. Turns a sharp left down the trail and
     bumps into the darkness.


18   INT. ARON’S TRUCK. NIGHT.                                 18

     Aron’s whole upper body is pumping along to the music. Another
     bright yellow sign flashes past. DANGER: FLASH FLOODS.


19   EXT. CANYON-SIDE. NIGHT.                                  19

     We are high above the road by a canyon wall, a massive slice of
     smooth rock on the edge of frame. On this rock are painted a
     series of petroglyphs and pictographs carved and painted into the
     rock by ancient civilisations.

     The carved images materialise on different parts of the triptych:
     superhumans hovering 8 feet high over groups of indistinct
     animals, their long dark bodies and huge eyes more extra-
     terrestrial than human.


20   EXT. DESERT. NIGHT.                                       20

     Tyres rushing across the desert grooves, pulling, snatching, hard
     left and right. The rear of the truck fish-tails madly.


21   INT. ARON’S TRUCK. NIGHT.                                 21

     Everything in the truck is bouncing up and down crazily. All
     except the bike, locked down in the back of the truck, braced
     solid. Suddenly, a small brown sign flashes past.

                           ARON.
               Woah.


      He kicks down on the brakes.


22    EXT. ARON’S TRUCK. NIGHT.                                 22

      The truck skids to a halt.


23    INT. ARON’S TRUCK. NIGHT.                                 23

                            ARON.
                  Nearly missed it!

      Aron leans over to the rucksack on the passenger seat. Gets out a
      small video camera and films the sign. The sign reads “HORSESHOE
      CANYON”.

      VIDEO POV- we see the sign, shakily filmed, as with a roar the
      truck starts up again.

      Still driving, now with one hand, Aron flicks on the interior
      light. Turns down the music. Turns the camera round on himself.

      VIDEO POV

                            ARON. (CONT’D)
                  Friday night, April 25th, two thousand
                  and three. Heading for Bluejohn Canyon.
                  Just me, the music and a whole lot of
                  night ahead. Love it.

      He throws the video camera into the top of the back-pack, turns up
      the music to ear bleed level.

24    Ext. ARON’S TRUCK. NIGHT.                                 24

      From high up we see the truck take a sharp left, the headlights
      barely penetrate the dark.


25    INT/EXT. ARON’S TRUCK. NIGHT.                             25

      Jackrabbits dart onto the road, racing him, darting left and right
      as he chases them down. They dart away into the black.




25A   EXT. ARON’S TRUCK. NIGHT.                                25A

      The truck’s headlights pick out three other vehicles and two
      encampments at the Trailhead.


26    INT. ARON’S TRUCK. NIGHT.                                 26

      Aron turns off the music. Ejects the CD. Bangs open the glove-box
      and flings the CD inside. Shuts the glove box.


     The camera watches the plastic glove box for a longer moment than
     seems necessary. Then, Aron’s hand comes back in, reaches inside,
     roots around and gets out a multi-tool hidden at the back. Slams
     the glove box again.


27   EXT. ARON’S TRUCK. NIGHT.                                 27

     Aron gets out of the truck, expecting a head to pop out of a tent.
     But silence. Stillness. Ghostly. He goes round to the back of the
     truck, opens the doors.


28   INT. BACK OF ARON’S TRUCK. NIGHT.                         28

     Aron flings everything out of the way of his mat, clambers in the
     back of the truck. The doors shut on the night.

     END OF TRIPTYCH TITLE SEQUENCE.

     Above the truck, unseen by Aron, the faint, pre-history trace of a
     shooting star flashes across the dark sky. Then, black.



     C/U watch.

     The sports watch in massive close up.

     The edge of a finger presses a button on the side. The stop-watch
     hands ticks into life.




29   INT. BACK OF ARON’S TRUCK. DAY.                           29

     The doors smash open to reveal blistering sun. Aron’s bike careers
     into it. We see the spectacular desert scenery for the first time.
     Endless pink sands, painful blue sky.




30   EXT. DESERT. DAY.                                         30

     VIDEO POV

     The video camera is mounted on the handlebars, pointing up at
     Aron’s face as he rides across the desert, jolting, skidding, huge
     amounts of video drop-out and electronic chaos. But despite all
     that, there’s Aron’s face, loving every moment of it.

                            ARON
                  Blue John Canyon. Guidebook time to the
                  drop-in, two and a half hours. Aiming to
                  take 45 minutes off that. Yee-hahhhh!


     And with an adrenaline yell, he tips down a suicidal slope at
     speed. He wears a bandana across his mouth to keep out the dust,
     an old Phish t-shirt and lycra bike shorts. He is an advert for
     extreme sports, the smile on his face and the complete control
     over his bike telling us all we need to know.




31   EXT. DESERT. DAY.                                         31

     Even uphill, Aron is hammering his way up the sandstone. Gasping
     for oxygen, his legs screaming for rest, he pushes and pushes
     until he crests the ridge. His mouth sucks on the tube from his
     Camelbak rehydration system - a bladder of water in his back-pack.



     Big C/U.

     Huge in camera, we see the air bubbles and the water being sucked
     towards his parched mouth.

                          ARON
                    (utter delight.)
                Ahhh.

     God, that’s good. But no rest. He is off again, down, down the
     steep slope, controlled skids dodging the boulders, an extreme
     sports junkie at the top of his game - until....




32   EXT. DESERT. DAY.                                         32

     Suddenly, his front wheel hits a sand trap. He is hurled forwards
     over the handle bars, face first into the sand. His toe-clips and
     his momentum bring the whole bike with him. The bike has him
     trapped on the desert floor like a wrestling take-down.

     He sits up, looks around quickly to see if anyone saw - then
     bursts out laughing. Pulls out his stills camera from his bag and
     takes a a self-portrait snap of the mess.

     Aron checks the time. He is up, back on the bike and away, not in
     the least deterred by his crash. He is unstoppable.




33   EXT. DESERT. DAY.                                         33

     At what seems like the only tree for miles, he U-locks his bike in
     the shade, pockets the keys, and jogs off into the desert,
     scoffing a muffin as he goes.


34   EXT. APPROACH TO BLUE JOHN CANYON. DAY.                   34

     Aron is bum-sliding down a steep slab. Lands neatly on his feet at
     the bottom. Then stops dead. As if the film has frozen. Voices.
     Girls’ voices. A giggle. Definitely a giggle. Aron listens. Checks
     his watch.



     C/U: watch.

     The huge second hand sweeps by.




35   EXT. DESERT. DAY.                                         35

     Looks towards the canyon. Looks towards the direction of the
     giggle.

     Aron climbs up the other side of the slope.




36   EXT. APPROACH TO BLUE JOHN CANYON. DAY.                   36

     Aron looks down on two girls in their early twenties, staring at a
     map. Kristi and Megan.

                            ARON
               Hey.

     They squint up at him haloed by the sun. They both look surprised.
     You really don’t meet other people out here. They can barely see
     him, whited out by sun, just an outline of human. He scrambles
     down towards them. Lands as neatly as an acrobat right next to
     them. As far as they are concerned, he’s just landed from outer
     space. They take a step back.

                            MEGAN
               Woah...

                         ARON
               Hi. You doing Blue John Canyon, too?

                         KRISTI
               Err, no, we’re headed for The Dome.

                            ARON
               Yeah?

                         KRISTI
               But I think we’re-

                            MEGAN
               - you’re -


                    KRISTI
          Seeing as I’m today’s designated map-
          reader, I’m... lost.

                    ARON
          Okay, well, no problem. You’re... here.

He points to the map.

                    KRISTI
          We are? (pretending to be in control)
          Sure we are. I knew that.

Aron laughs.

                    ARON
          And The Dome is here.

                    KRISTI
          Oh.

                    ARON
          Easy to miss the turn off.

                    KRISTI
          No kidding. Err, hi, by the way.

                    ARON
          Hi. I’ll take you back up there if you
          like.

The girls look at each other. Don’t know how to break it to him.
Then he gets it.

                    ARON (CONT’D)
          Oh, sorry. The Friday the 13th, Child-
          Killer look.

He struggles with the bandana around his mouth.

                    ARON (CONT’D)
          I’m really only a psychopath on
          weekdays. And as it’s Saturday...

He takes the bandana off with a flourish. Shrugs as if that’s the
best he can do with the materials available.

                    ARON (CONT’D)
          I can’t take this one off. It’s my face.

Kristi and Megan laugh. Aron laughs. Ice broken. He sticks out his
hand, extremely formal.

                    ARON (CONT’D)
          Aron.

Kristi sticks hers out, equally formal.


                            KRISTI
                  Kristi. Allow me to introduce you to my
                  friend, Megan.

                            MEGAN
                  Pleasure to meet you, Mister Aron.

                              ARON
                  An honor.

     And they shake too. And all laugh.

                            ARON (CONT’D)
                  So, you’re lost. And I’m a guide.

     He looks at them, expectantly.

                              ARON (CONT’D)
                  I’m good.

     The girls look at each other.

                            MEGAN
                  Sure. Why not.

     Aron checks his watch. Puts his hand to it.



     C/U WATCH.

     Huge on the watch. With a click, the sweeping second hand comes to
     a stop.




37   EXT. DESERT. DAY.                                         37

     From high on the edge of the canyon we look down on the three
     figures hiking their way along the bottom.

                            MEGAN
                  You biked from Horseshoe? That’s twenty
                  miles or more.

                            ARON
                  Seventeen on the odometer.

                            MEGAN
                      (teasing)
                  Not seventeen and a half?

                            ARON
                  Seventeen point three, actually.

                            MEGAN
                  Okay. I got you. You’re one of those.


                         ARON
               Yes, Ma’am. One of those.

     They walk on, pleased to be together.

                         KRISTI
               Spend a lot of time out here?

                         ARON
               My second home.




38   EXT. CANYON. DAY.                                    38

     They stop at a junction.

                         ARON
               It’s this fork here.

                         KRISTI
               Oh. Okay. Totally missed that. Glad we
               bumped into you.

                         MEGAN
               Yeah. What are the chances of that? I
               mean, out here?

                         ARON
               You go to the one place in America you
               can guarantee you won’t run into some
               weirdo and.... whaddya know!

     They all laugh and head up the narrow canyon.




39   EXT. CANYON. DAY.                                    39

     Aron stops.

                         ARON
               The guidebook route’s that way. But
               there’s a better way in. The cool way.

                         MEGAN
                   (gently teasing)
               Oh, the cool way, huh?

                         ARON
               No kidding, it’s like the most fun you
               can have with your clothes on- though,
               honestly, it’s best without your clothes
               on.


                         MEGAN
               Aron Ralston...

                         ARON
               Seriously, you’ll never forget it.

     The girls look at each other.

                         ARON (CONT’D)
               It’s a bit of a climb...

                           KRISTI AND MEGAN
               We climb!

                         ARON
               And a squeeze.

                         KRISTI AND MEGAN
               We squeeze!

     They all laugh.




40   EXT. NORTH WASH SLOT. DAY.                                40

     Kristi, Megan and Aron are suspended fifty feet up a thin slot
     between two sheer walls of rock. Only the friction from their
     bodies keeps them in place. Flat to the rock, they nudge their way
     sideways like something out of an Egyptian painting. Aron is in
     the lead, chatting away, oblivious to the giggling nervousness of
     the two girls behind him.


                         MEGAN
               - wait, you get us in here and now you
               tell us you’re not a guide? You said...

     Aron plays up to her panic.

                         ARON
               No, I’m an engineer. But this is what
               I really want to do.

                         MEGAN
               And I really want to be a super model.
               Jesus, I mean, what if these two slabs
               move?

                         KRISTI
               They’ve been here for millions of years.
               They’re not gonna move.

                         ARON
               Sure they are.


                            MEGAN
               What?

                         ARON
               Everything is moving all the time. Let’s
               hope it’s not today.

                            MEGAN
               Great.

                         ARON
               Nearly there.

                            KRISTI
               Where?

                            ARON
               Here.

     The girls look puzzled.

                         ARON (CONT’D)
               You just got to remember that it’s all
               gonna be okay. See you down there!

     And he relaxes his arms, shoulders, feet- all the things that are
     wedging him tight into the crack. Instantly, he is falling
     vertically down into the unknown. Megan screams, a genuine shout
     of fear.

     We see Aron drop through a large hole in the rock and launch
     out of sight, into midair with a holler of joy.




41   INT. DOME POOL. DAY.                                      41

     He drops 60 feet through the hole in the roof of the rock dome
     into the most exquisite emerald blue pool.

                            KRISTI O/S
               Oh my God!




42   EXT. NORTH WASH SLOT. DAY.                                42

     They can’t see him, only hear the explosive crack of man on water.
     He could be dead.

                         MEGAN
               Jesus Christ! Aron! Are you okay? Aron?

     Aron fills the cathedral dome with his version of a Phish song at
     the top of his voice.


                         KRISTI
               Listen to the guy. He’s okay.

                         MEGAN
               He’s bat shit!

                         ARON O/S
               C’mon! Fly! You can do it!

     The two girls look at each other, petrified.


43   INT. DOME POOL. DAY.                                      43

     We are in the pool with Aron. Slick wet hair, buzzing with
     adrenaline. He is looking up through the hole at Kristi and Megan
     who are sitting above him at the beginning of the slide, looking
     absolutely terrified.

                         ARON
               Just let go! It’ll all be fine. Trust
               me.

                         KRISTI
               Trust you? I’ll kill you, Aron Ralston!

                         MEGAN
               You love this really...




44   EXT. NORTH WASH SLOT. DAY.                                44

     Kristi looks at Megan. Nods at the squeeze.

                         KRISTI
               Well, I’m not going back, that’s for
               sure. Shit.

     Takes two deep breaths.

                         KRISTI (CONT’D)
               Been nice knowing you, Megs.

     And with a scream, she lets go. Crashes into the pool. A pause and
     then a whoop of sheer joy.

                         KRISTI O/S
               Go for it, Megan, it’s fine!

                         MEGAN
               Oh, fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck....

     And she lets go, too, and shoots into the abyss.


45   INT. DOME POOL. DAY.                                      45

     Megan tumbles out of the sky towards them. Crashes into the blue
     water. Comes up screaming. They bob together in the centre, their
     breath coming in short excited bursts. The light seemingly coming
     from beneath them and rippling over the cavernous ceiling. They
     are laughing- at their own daring, at the craziness of where they
     are, at being alive.

                         MEGAN
               Oh my God, oh my God...

                         KRISTI
               Again. We’ve got to go again.

     They all look at each other, and simultaneously say...

                            ARON, KRISTI AND MEGAN
               Camera!




46   EXT. OUTSIDE THE CAVE. LATER.                             46

     Lying on a slab of rock, they are drying off in the sun. The
     remains of lunch surround them. Kristi is stretched out near Aron,
     taking in the sun on her near naked body. Megan has taken off most
     of her clothes to dry too.

     Camera stills.

     Aron at the top of various snowy Colorado peaks. Some have far-
     reaching views, others are beset with snow flurries, Aron only
     just visible underneath hood, helmet and balaclava.

                         ARON V/O
               That’s Longs Peak, Holy Cross,
               Capitol... the Maroon Bells.

     But always, it’s just Aron, centre of frame, taking a photo of
     himself.

                         KRISTI V/O
               Could be anywhere.

                         ARON V/O
               Big storm on Mt Princeton... I’m on
               course to be the first person to solo
               all the Fourteeners in winter.

                         MEGAN V/O
               Always on your own?

                         ARON V/O
               Umm, that’s the point of soloing. You’re
               on your own.


Then we see Aron and Kristi who is holding the camera.

                    KRISTI
          Why?

                    ARON
          Nobody likes me.

                    MEGAN
          Or that awful band you’re always
          singing. Phish. Ugh.

                    ARON
          Exactly. Nobody likes me or my music.
          Gotta go solo.

But Kristi really wants to know.

                    KRISTI
          Seriously. Nobody to share the view with
          - though if you’re doing it in winter,
          hello, what view? The experience. Nobody
          to share that with. Seems kinda lonely.

                    ARON
              (shrugs)
          It’s the way I like it.

Still a little mystified, Kristi gives the camera back to Aron.
Lies back on the slab to take in the sun. Catches Aron checking
his watch.

                    KRISTI
              (wryly)
          Behind schedule?

He looks at her. Without turning her closed eyes from the sun, she
smiles.

                    ARON
          Actually, I stopped the clock.

This gets a response. She turns.

                    KRISTI
          You “stopped the clock”?

                    ARON
          I’m timing myself. Seeing if I can beat
          the guide book time. When you guys are
          gone... click. Clock’s running again.

                    KRISTI
          Huh.

She turns back to the sun.


                         MEGAN
               No girlfriend, then, Aron?

                         ARON
               Nobody special.

                         KRISTI
               There’s always somebody special. There’s
               always the “one”.

                         ARON
               Not for me.

                         KRISTI
               They all say that.

                         MEGAN
               Sounds real certain about it.

                         ARON
               Yes, Ma’am.




47   EXT. TRAIL. DAY.                                          47

     The three are walking down the dry water-course, tiny chatting
     figures at the bottom of gigantic vertical walls.

                         ARON
               ...Blue John was Butch Cassidy’s cook.
               Hid out in the canyon when he was on the
               run.

                          MEGAN
               Cool.

                         ARON
               Come with me. Might see his ghost.

                         KRISTI
               We gotta get back.

                          MEGAN
               I guess.

                          ARON
               Okay.

     They reach a cross-roads.

                         ARON (CONT’D)
               One last photo?

     They pose with raven feathers in their hair as Aron turns the
     camera round.


VIDEO STILL POV of all three, their heads tight together.

                    MEGAN
          Listen, some friends of ours are having
          a party tomorrow night if you want to
          swing by.

                    ARON
          Yeah? Where?

But he is already delving in his back-pack, getting out his CD
player and putting on his headphones.

                    MEGAN
          Twenty miles North, on the road to Green
          River, behind the old motel. We’re
          putting up this massive inflatable
          Scooby Doo. Can’t miss it.

                    ARON
          Cool.

Re-shouldering the pack, adjusting the head-phones.

                    MEGAN
          Turn down that track and it’s about two
          miles further on. Starts late, goes all
          night. We’ll have some beers chilling
          for you.

                    ARON
          Sounds great.

He checks his watch. Puts his hand to it. Click.

                    ARON (CONT’D)
          Well, so long!

Turns. A finger hits the button on the CD player.

We see the CD begin to spin. The LED display tells us there’s
38:47 to play before 0:01 appears.

The noise of ten thousand people cheering blasts his- and our-
ears.

                    CD RECORDING
          Good evening, Las Vegas...! Are you
          having a good time? Are you ready? Are
          you....readdddyyyy?

The music crashes over us. Aron’s running feet negotiate the rough
ground.

Close up of Aron’s face, eyes already focussed on placing his
feet. The measured breathing of an athlete pacing himself. Megan
shouts after him.


                         MEGAN
               Scooby Doo, yeah?

     But he is in a different world.

                         MEGAN (CONT’D)
               Do you think he’ll come? You liked him,
               right?

     She looks at Kristi looking at Aron. Nudges her knowingly.

                         MEGAN (CONT’D)
               Yeah, you liked him.

     Kristi continues to stare at his disappearing figure.

                         KRISTI
               Know what? I don’t think we figured in
               his day at all.




48   EXT. BLUE JOHN CANYON. ENTRY SLOT. DAY.                      48

     Aron’s eyes. We see what really figures in his day. His hands grip
     small holds. His feet smear on smooth rock. He is moving down
     steep rock, hands and feet moving carefully but confidently.
     Without warning his feet suddenly slide forward from under him and
     he skates/snap-kicks trying to keep his balance on a floor of
     scattering pebbles left there by a flood. There's a flash of the
     sky and dazzling sunlight.

     Only his arms and the proximity now of the walls prevent him
     landing hard on his ass.




     A small snake slithers away from his giant feet.




49   INT. CANYON. DAY.                                            49

     We are below him, watching from underneath a water-worn, S-shaped
     log trapped across a narrow fissure. Aron’s mouth sings along to
     the music as he reaches the S-shaped log, crouches down, gives it
     two firm hits with his palm. Solid.

                         ARON
               Good enough.

     He drops all the weight onto his arms, allows his body to dead-
     hang from the log for a couple of beats:


                         ARON (CONT’D)
               Three, two, one...go.

     And he drops the six feet to the sandy ground below. His feet
     neatly hit the sand with a puff of dust. Nothing to it.


50   EXT. S-SHAPED LOG. DAY.                                    50

     He takes a photo of the S-shaped log above him. Right into the
     blinding sun.

     Title: 2:41 PM. Saturday, April 26th. 2003.

                         ARON
               Won’t be coming back this way.




51   INT. SLOT CANYON. DAY. (FROM HERE ON, CANYON SHOTS INT.)   51

     He spins and continues along the narrow alley of the slot canyon,
     seeing the first huge chockstones, half-buried in the sand, big as
     trucks. He easily scrambles over one and around another.

     Thump, thump. He gives it two firm hits with his palm again, an
     automatic instinct that accompanies every new boulder. The boulder
     doesn’t move.

     It’s a tight fit, but he’s like a contortionist and just squeezes
     through.




52   INT. DEEPER INTO THE CANYON. DAY.                          52

     The slot is now just 4 ft wide and as he stops to look at massive
     logs jammed way above his head, silhouetted against the cloudless
     blue, he drinks deeply from his water bottle.




53   INT. CANYON RIM. LOOKING DOWN. DAY.                        53

     On we go and so does the concert in Aron’s head. He pumps the air
     to the music. One set of chockstones leads to another. He rapidly
     negotiates them like an obstacle race, giving each one the
     requisite test with his palm to check for movement. Then, he is
     stopped by one the size of a big refrigerator, jammed between the
     walls of the canyon, eighteen inches above the floor.

     Over or under? He drops to his belly and squeezes underneath,
     rucking the sandy floor in front of him. He’s halfway, his chest
     rising out the far side when suddenly, he jams. The music locks up
     too, looping continuously on two notes like bad techno. He pushes
     but nothing.

     Utter stillness. Only a flicker of panic in Aron’s blinking eyes
     reassures us that the world has not frozen.

     We see from his point of view. There’s a hell of a lot of stone
     above him.

     Then Aron slowly reaches back with his hand. With the careful
     precision of a lock-picker, he releases a part of his back-pack
     strap that has snagged. The music unjams too. He jumps up, brushes
     off the sand.


55   INT. SLOT CANYON. DAY.                                      55

     Tight on Aron’s throat as he swallows water down from his
     Camelbak. Big gulps.

     We follow his gaze down the slot. It’s steeper, now. We’re already
     60 feet below ground level it’s falling further in front of us.
     This is more like caving. He gets the map out.




56   INT/EXT. SILHOUETTE PROFILE. CROSS SECTION OF THE CANYON. DAY.

     We see a section of the canyon and the tiny figure of Aron moving
     within it. We track in and elide into a graphic view of him
     chimneying his way along the canyon- now only three feet wide at
     most. We see his skill, using his legs, back friction to body-walk
     along the smooth, sheer walls. He’s going deep.


57   INT. SLOT CANYON. DAY.                                      57

     He moves towards another chockstone below him. You can see his
     thinking: this one’s about the size of a bus wheel. He can crouch
     on top, dead-hang from it and reduce the drop to the canyon floor.


58   INT. SLOT CANYON. DAY.                                      58

     He reaches it at the same time we do, jumping down on top of it.
     Crouches. Gives it the two thumps with his palm. Solid. Reaches
     his hand around the back of the boulder for a hold. Dangles.

     C/U tight on Aron.


     Just as he dangles, there’s a scraping sound. Small, but close.
     The stone judders towards him, pulled by the torque of his hand,
     weighting it from the back. It rotates.

                         ARON
               Shit.

     Instantly and instinctively, he lets go and drops - as if he’s
     trying to detach a mine dragging him to the sea floor.


59   INT. CANYON. ON CHOCKSTONE. DAY.                          59

     But it’s following him down.


60   INT. CANYON. ARON’S POV. DAY.                             60

     The backlit chockstone falls towards him. A ton of boulder,
     consuming the sky.


61   INT. SLOT CANYON. DAY.                                    61

     He lifts his arms to protect his head, but his eyes remain open.
     Through his fingers, we see the next three seconds.

     The rock grabs his left hand and flings it against the left wall.
     He pulls it away as the rock ricochets against the canyon wall and
     careers towards his right arm which he instinctively raises to
     protect his head.

     The rock smashes his right wrist and hand against the wall and
     drags it down, tearing the skin from him like a cheese-grater.

     Aron is utterly powerless to stop its force, able only to land on
     his feet as the rock crunches to a halt, trapped in the slot. With
     his hand. Everything stops.

     Title: 127 HOURS.

     The word HOURS fades to be replaced by numbers 00.00. The zeros
     turn into minutes and hours. 126.59.59. They start counting down.
     The clock is running.


62   INT. CANYON FLOOR. DAY.                                   62

     No movement. Aron’s standing behind the rock. As if he’s in a line
     for a bus, as if he’s shaking someone’s hand. A handshake with a
     canyon.

     Silence, except for waves of applause and cheering coming from the
     head-phones that have been ripped off Aron’s head. The cheering
     and clapping comes to a painfully slow end. Now, shocked, utter
     silence.


63   INT. CANYON FLOOR. DAY.                                      63

     Adrenaline, searing roaring pain and panic.

                         ARON
               Get your hand outta there!

     Pulls and pulls. Yanks, twists, screws until his shoulder is
     almost dislocated. But nothing moves.

     Sweat on his face.

                         ARON (CONT’D)
               Shit, shit, shit!

     He pushes the boulder with his left hand to reverse the movement.
     Heaves at it with every sinew in his body. Nothing. Heaves again.
     And again and again, thrusting with his knees, thighs, shoulder,
     everything. Nothing. He rests for a while, taking huge breaths.

                         ARON (CONT’D)
               This is - this is... insane.

     Even gives a brief puff of laughter. Gathers himself. Slams
     upwards with his entire body, a man running full pelt into a door.

                         ARON (CONT’D)
               Unnn...agh!

     Air explodes out of his lungs. A howl of phenomenal pain. Not a
     millimeter of movement.

                         ARON (CONT’D)
               No, no, no no no no. Fuck!

     He goes limp, whimpering in sweat. His knees are bleeding from
     smashing them into the rock. He looks at his good fingers, now
     lacerated. He would collapse to the floor. But he can’t. He’s
     stuck.

     He grabs a bit of shirt, wipes the sweat away from his eyes.
     Loosens the strap on his back-pack, pulls it over his head and
     hula-hoops it around his body until it falls at his feet. With his
     free hand, he gets out the water bottle. Drinks deep. One gulp,
     two gulps, three - stops, mid fourth and backwashes it into the
     bottle.

                         ARON (CONT’D)
               No. No more water.

     One-handed, he rescrews the lid with difficulty. Drops it back in
     his pack.

                         ARON (CONT’D)
               Stop. Relax. Come on, think.

     He breathes and breathes, taking stock for the first time.


64   INT. CANYON FLOOR. DAY.                                   64

     Aron examines the boulder at each point he can reach - stretching
     and contorting his body to see in to his crushed hand, to where
     his thumb is visible above and his little finger below. Compares
     left hand with right. The right wrist is now squeezed to the size
     of the width of his little finger. We know because he can barely
     get the little finger of his left hand in the gap. He’s still
     processing this whole event; how unlikely, how bizarre.

                            ARON
                  Jesus. Jesus. How? How did you do this?
                  You idiot, you total idiot! It’s
                  crushed, man. It’s fucking dying.

     He reaches up and touches the trail of blood, hair and skin on the
     canyon wall. Looks at it on his fingertips. Silence. Except for
     the tick, tick, of his watch.

     With his teeth, he undoes his watch.

     We see the time in big close-up.

     C/U. WATCH

     3.14. Click. The second hand of the stop-watch comes to a halt.




65   INT. CANYON. DAY.                                         65

     Aron looks up at the slit of sky. Shouts.

                            ARON
                  Hello?

     Tries again.

                            ARON (CONT’D)
                  Kristi! Megan! Anyone there? Hello?


66   INT/EXT. PULL OUT OF THE CANYON. DAY.                     66

     From the slot canyon, back, back, back, higher and higher until it
     nothing more than a hair-line crack in the millions of filaments
     that make up this endless desert.


67   INT. CANYON FLOOR. DAY.                                   67

     Aron unpacks everything with great energy. Lays it all out at his
     feet. A man taking stock.

     BIG C/U: various. Day.


     Aron examines each item in turn, looking for its potential. These
     are his only companions.

     Chocolate bar wrappers, a bakery bag with crumbs of muffin. Two
     small bean burritos. A CD player, CDs, LED head-lamp with spare AA
     batteries, mini cam-corder, stills camera, bike-lock key, climbing
     harness, rehydration pack (he checks for water - empty) money,
     credit cards, map, climbing rope in rope bag, a stick, and a small
     multi-tool.

     He stares at it all, neatly laid out around his feet. It all
     stares back.

     He picks up the multi-tool. Opens all the blades. Thinks.

68   INT. CANYON FLOOR. DAY.                                     68

     Inside the tiny gap we see Aron’s head-lamp flick on. We see the
     rock, the wall and his hand, trapped between the two. He picks a
     point and begins to chip away with the multi-tool. He’s back.
     Energy, purpose, action.

     He stops to assess his hand. Flexes it. It’s swollen and puffy. He
     doesn’t dwell on it. Gets back to chipping.

     A rhythm develops. Chip, chip, chip. Flex, flex, flex of the hand.
     And back to the chipping.

69   INT. CANYON FLOOR. DAY.                                     69

     Huge close up of Aron’s eye. In the foreground there is a pile of
     steel filings mixed with the small pile of sand-dust.

                         ARON
               That’s not rock. It’s metal. Wearing
               down the knife.

     He blows the whole pile of steel filings into our face.


70   INT. CANYON FLOOR. DAY.                                   70

     The dust clears from our eyes. Aron chips away at the boulder
     again. Stops. Changes tack and starts chipping away at the wall.
     Stops. Considers.


71   INT. CANYON FLOOR. DAY.                                   71

                         ARON
               And....

     Aron is bent forward, his face almost on his trapped arm. In his
     teeth is the knife, balanced upright with his lips, the tip of the
     blade on the rock. His good hand brings a flat rock smashing down
     on the top of the knife.

     Instead of making any inroads into chipping the boulder, the rock
     explodes in his hand, showering Aron - and us - with fragments.

     The knife bounces off the rock, hits his shorts. As he moves to
     grab it, he misses it and knocks it further round the back of his
     leg.

     He pivots to try to catch it again, but gravity is quicker and the
     tool falls into a hole between the rounded rocks near his left
     foot.

                         ARON (CONT’D)
               No, no, no......!


72   INT. CANYON FLOOR. DAY.                                   72

     The knife is visible in the crack below and behind his right leg.
     Because he can’t twist, he can’t get anywhere near it. Heaves
     against the canyon wall to get there. Pointless. Aron is furious
     with himself.

                         ARON
               Shit!

     He pulls off his right shoe and tries to squeeze his foot into the
     hole. Too big. He looks upward. Can’t believe it.

                         ARON (CONT’D)
               Shit, shit, shit!


73   INT. BENEATH CANYON FLOOR. DAY.                           73

     We’re on a level with the knife in the hole beneath Aron’s feet.
     An enormous light blasts on overhead. Aron’s head-lamp. The stick
     enters from top of screen and nudges the knife in a semi-circle.
     It’s all a bit arcade game if it wasn’t so fucking serious. No
     success. The stick is withdrawn. The knife remains.

     Pause. An ant runs over the knife.


     The stick returns. This time, its top is almost broken off to form
     a natural hook. We push in on the knife as the stick hooks through
     the little ring on the end of the knife. Slowly, slowly, it lifts.


74   INT. ARON IN CANYON. DAY.                                 74

     Looking down onto the ground, around his leg, his toes holding the
     stick like a chopstick. Tremulously, his leg lifts the knife out
     and up towards his good arm. Slowly, breathlessly, he picks it off
     the end of the stick. For the first time in a long time, a smile.

                           ARON
               Sweet.


75   INT. WIDE INT. CANYON. NIGHT.                             75

     We’re with the wind blowing dust through the canyon slot. As we
     weave through the narrow canyon, we come across a miner in the
     distance, digging at the rock.


76   INT. CANYON. NIGHT.                                       76

     Aron is using the shorter file from the multi-tool now and has
     tied a shoe-lace to his wrist through the ring of the tool.

     He pulls his cap down to keep most of the dust from blowing
     in his eyes. His lips are caked in sand, but he keeps blowing
     on his arm to keep it clear.



     C/U: DIGITAL NUMERALS.

     The luminous watch changes to 00.00.

     Title: Sunday.


77   INT. ARON IN THE CANYON. NIGHT.                           77

     Aron celebrates midnight with a tiny, careful sip of water. He
     holds it in his mouth, puffing his cheeks, circulating the
     precious fluid.

     He leans his head against the canyon wall. Closes his eyes.




78   EXT. EXTRAORDINARY LANDSCAPE. DAZZLING DAYLIGHT. DAY.     78

     Daylight, a lunar landscape almost, though with patches of
     green and giant boulders, Aron whom we sense only by being
     around his shoulder is out walking with his friend. They wander
     through this field of boulders. It's as if we're on the moon


     looking over Buzz Aldrin's shoulder at Neil Armstrong; it
     certainly sounds like that...

     They come upon one the size of a house buried nose deep in the
     field.

                         ARON’S FRIEND
               Wow, look at the size of this one.

     There's no cliffs or mountains anywhere near.

                         ARON’S FRIEND (CONT’D)
               How the fuck did this get here?

     Aron’s friend looks around, then right up at the sky, then at him.
     Shrugs. Laughs.




79   INT. CANYON. NIGHT.                                         79

     Chip, chip, chip. He stretches his left arm, flexes his legs.
     Changes blade. Prises at a section of rock with the file. Without
     warning a dime-sized shred of boulder arcs through the night. He
     catches it perfectly on his right elbow.

                           ARON
               Cool.

     Picks it off his arm and places it on top of the rock. A grain of
     sand on a sea-shore. But something. He stands up from his crouch.
     Flexes. Man, his legs are aching.


80   INT. ABOVE ARON, LOOKING INTO CANYON. NIGHT.                80

     Aron is in his harness. He is throwing 30 feet of rope up towards
     us. A tangle of knots and carabiners at the end of it looking for
     purchase close to camera. Each time, it falls back. He persists.
     Dozens of jump cuts, dozens of attempts.

     Finally it catches.

     He pulls on the rope, gently at first, then fiercely. It’s caught.
     He clips the rope into his harness and sinks gently down, allowing
     the weight off his feet.

                           ARON
               Ahhhhhhh.

     He dangles, luxuriating in the sudden weightlessness. Examines the
     knuckles of his left hand, skinned by the digging.

     He switches off his head-lamp. Eyes close. Black....


81   INT/EXT. VARIOUS. DAY.                                    81

     A re-run of the accident. He can now witness it in detail, from
     all angles - almost as if his role is to point out the salient
     details of the accident. 3 seconds becomes 30.... We fall with his
     face in high-definition slow motion, watching his future.

     We fall with the rock chasing him pitilessly to the bottom of the
     canyon.




82   INT. CANYON. PRE-DAWN.                                    82

     Aron’s eyes snap open and he stands unsteadily. Rubs at his legs
     and arms. Starts chipping at the boulder again.


83   INT. CANYON. TIME-LAPSE. PRE-DAWN.                        83

     Lit only by the head-lamp, the black shifts to grey and then
     finally, light. He watches it arrive. A rush of wind. A noise.


     He whips his head to look up. A raven flaps overhead.

                          RAVEN
               Caw-caw.




84   EXT. SKY. DAWN.                                           84

     The raven flies the length of the canyon slit above him. Blue,
     blue sky.




85   INT. CANYON. DAWN.                                        85

     He stretches his neck, desperate to follow the only other living
     thing in this universe. But it’s gone. He stares at its absence
     for a long time.

                          ARON
               Caw-caw.


86   INT. CANYON. DAWN.                                        86

     Aron is very still, staring at the rock and the open blade lying
     on top of it. Steeling himself to start work.


     Suddenly, he looks over his shoulder and sees a dagger of sunlight
     cutting across the top of the slot. Sunrise.




87   EXT. ARON’S TRUCK. PRE-DAWN                               87

     We are behind Aron as he hurtles up Aspen Main Street and
     screeches to a halt outside a house. Still behind Aron we leave
     the truck. The silhouettes of people on one rooftop.

     Fairy lights. An all-night party. As we look up from behind him a
     girl, mid-20s, red hair, beautiful, turns and leans over towards
     him, calling down. She speaks with a slight French accent.

                         RANA
               Ralston - there you are! Get up here!




88   EXT. FIRE-ESCAPE. PRE-DAWN.                               88

     We’re rushing up the steps, two, maybe three at a time, behind
     Aron. He bursts onto the roof and into the party. Much jeering and
     cheering but just in time to see the sunrise blaze over the far
     snow-capped mountains and flood over the rooftop. Amongst the
     party carnage his friends are sitting on sofas and deck-chairs.
     Rana, lit by God, brings him a Margarita and a dazzling smile.

                         RANA
               Glad you made it Aron.

     The sun ascends and the party, drunk as skunks, greet the day.

89   INT. CANYON. DAWN.                                        89

     He watches the sunbeam as if it’s a living thing. It moves towards
     him. He stretches his hand towards it. Can’t get to it. It’s going
     to miss him. He whips off his left shoe and sock and pushes his
     leg towards the beam of light. Slowly, it climbs, caressing his
     ankle and calf. He pulls the other sock off and bathes this one
     now.


     The sunlight hits the canyon beyond the boulder. Suddenly, the
     entire slot bursts with pink and gold light. Aron stares.

               It’s three oh five on Sunday, April
               27th, two thousand and three. This marks
               twenty-four hours of being stuck in Blue
               John Canyon just where it slots up above
               the Big Drop. My name is Aron Ralston.
               My parents are Donna and Larry Ralston
               of Englewood, Colorado.

     A long pause.

                           ARON (CONT’D)
               Whoever   finds this, you can keep the cam-
               corder.   But please make an attempt to
               find my   parents. Give them the tape. Be
               sure of   it. I would appreciate it.

     He takes long blinks, seems to avoid looking at himself though the
     screen is facing him. He looks alarmed and wide-eyed, though his
     speech is oddly slow and slurry.

                         ARON (CONT’D)
               So.... I was descending Blue John
               yesterday, when this happened.

     The camera swings rounds to show where his forearm and wrist
     disappear into the horrifyingly skinny gap between the chockstone
     and the wall.




91   INT/EXT. VARIOUS. CANYON. DAY.                            91

     Flashes of the accident, almost in silhouette, as if an animation
     side-view. It freezes just before the moment of entombment.


92   INT. CANYON. DAY. VIDEO MESSAGE ONE.                      92

                         ARON
               What you’re looking at there is my arm
               going into the rock... this chockstone
               was loose. Rolled onto my arm and it’s -
               stuck. It’s been without circulation for
               twenty-four hours now. It’s a kind of
               grey, blue color. No circulation.


     He pulls the camera back round to his face.

                         ARON (CONT’D)
               It’s pretty well gone. I’m low on food
               and -

     He leans, picks up the water bottle and shakes it for the benefit
     of whoever might ever watch this.

                         ARON (CONT’D)
               Yeah. That’s about three hundred, four
               hundred mill in there. That’s it for
               water.

     Another long pause. Forced smile.

                         ARON (CONT’D)
               I’m in pretty deep doo-doo here.

     The smile is replaced by something nearer sudden terror. Suddenly
     the screen turns to static.




93   INT. CANYON. DAY.                                            93

     Aron gathers himself. Clears his throat. Switches back on.



     VIDEO MESSAGE ONE.

                         ARON
               I’ve had a lot of time to think about
               this... and the way I see it is there
               are four options. One: try to move the
               boulder. I managed to get a rope around
               that other chockstone up there -

     The camera swings up to the sky, focusses on another boulder.

                         ARON (CONT’D)
               - but I’ve only got the gear to rig a
               three, four-to-one ratio. And this
               boulder must be a ton. Do the Math.
               Option two, chip away at the rock. Been
               doing that. A lot. But I’m beginning to
               think that my hand is actually
               supporting it. So every time I chip it a
               bit, the rock just settles further.


94   INT. WIDE. MOVING THROUGH THE CANYON. REAL TIME.          94

     A breeze slides through the canyon. Five seconds of involuntary
     shuddering from Aron that shakes his whole body.




95   INT. CANYON. DAY. VIDEO MESSAGE ONE.                      95

                           ARON
               Christ.

     He pulls himself together.

                         ARON (CONT’D)
               So option three: cut my arm off.

     He shrugs. As best he can in the circumstances.

                         ARON (CONT’D)
               Which is pretty much suicide. It’s 4
               hours to my vehicle down canyon and 4
               hours back to my bike but the
               climbing... I think it will be
               impossible with one hand. Between the
               blood loss and the dehydration I think I
               would die if I cut my arm.

     Pause.

                         ARON (CONT’D)
               Animals do it. In a trap. Bite off their
               own leg.

     Another long pause.

                         ARON (CONT’D)
               They die anyway. Option four is to
               survive. Hunker down. Wait for rescue.

     He turns away from camera. Suddenly a guilty man. Looks back. How
     to say this?

                         ARON (CONT’D)
               Didn’t tell anyone where I was I was
               going, did I? No note on the truck.

     Another strange smile.

                         ARON (CONT’D)
               Rule number one, First Grade, just
               before ‘don’t talk to strangers’. Dumb.
               Dumb. Dumb.

     Nothing left to say. The video whirrs on until his eyes snap into
     focus.


96   INT. CANYON. DAY. REAL TIME.                              96

     Aron suddenly alert. Footsteps. Something. He can hear something.
     Electrified, his head snaps around trying to locate the direction.


97   INT. CANYON. DAY. VIDEO MESSAGE ONE/ CANYON REAL TIME.    97

     We see variously on tape and in real time reacting. He’s forgotten
     the camera in his hand- the angles are crazy and oblique, but
     shocking nonetheless. He is screaming, screaming. We can see the
     unleashed panic, the fear, the desperation.

                         ARON
               Help! Help! Hello? Please!

     Stops, wide-eyed to listen. Definitely noise.

                         ARON (CONT’D)
               Help me! Help me! Hellllp!


98   INT. CANYON. DAY.                                         98

     He stops, heart racing, breathing hard. Still, the noise. Looks
     above and behind him. A kangaroo rat scuffling behind another
     chock-stone. The rat scuttles off.

                         ARON
               You little.... fucker.

     Aron’s entire frozen body goes limp.


99   INT. CANYON. DAY.                                         99

     He stares at the camera in his hand. Sees it is still recording.
     Stops it. Rewinds. Re-runs the footage of the tinny screams for
     help coming from the speaker.

                         ARON V/O
               Help! Help! Hello? Please! Help me! Help
               me...!

     Aron stops the tape and rewinds.

                         ARON
               No. You. Do. Not.

     Takes a deep breath.

                         ARON (CONT’D)
                   (almost to himself)
               Hold it together.


100   EXT. GOOGLE-EARTH SATELLITE SHOT OF WILDERNESS. DUSK.       100

      We’re high above the desert. In time-lapse, we see nightfall: a
      soft, grey, endless line of darkness cross the earth.




101   C/U: DIGITAL THERMOMETER.                                   101

      The temperature gauge on his watch falls ridiculously fast from 70
      degrees down to 48.




102   INT. CANYON. NIGHT.                                         102

      Jump-cut, strobe-lit as if stop-frame animation: Aron madly gets
      dressed for the night.

      He cannibalizes everything he can get his hands on, using his
      knife, his teeth, his free hand.

      He tears holes in a cloth camera bag. Thrusts his good arm into
      the newly fashioned sleeve. Pulls it around him with his teeth.

      Wraps purple webbing around his right arm.

      Shoves the empty Camelbak water bladder between the wall and his
      right arm to insulate it.

      Wraps a grocery bag around his upper right bicep.

      Curls the dirty green-and-yellow ropes around his legs. Like he’s
      being squeezed by a python.

      All done at massive speed. To generate warmth, stop him from
      thinking.

      Finally, he sticks his head inside the rope bag.


103   INT. ROPE BAG. NIGHT.                                       103

      It’s lined with plastic. Shiny. By the light of the head-lamp,
      he’s suddenly alarmingly illuminated.


104   EXT. ROPE BAG. NIGHT.                                       104

      From the outside, he looks a cross between an alien and a tramp.


105   INT. ROPE BAG. NIGHT.                                       105

      Bizarrely, Aron laughs, aware of how ridiculous he looks.


                          ARON
                The Michelin Man! Bit thinner. Lot
                thinner.

      Stops laughing. He roots in his pocket, pulls out the remains of a
      bean burrito. Takes a bite. Chews slow, heavy, masticating on a
      dry mouth.




106   INT. ARON’S TRUCK. DUSK.                                 106

      We're in his truck again but this time over his shoulder and we
      can see the Scooby Doo Figure dancing in the distance. It's now
      lit up too, as night is falling, and we're coming at it from the
      other direction. As he gets to it he swerves and follows its
      guide to the party.




107   EXT. DRIVEWAY. NIGHT                                     107

      Pulling up at the party.




108   INT. PARTY. NIGHT.                                       108

      Inside it's nice, full of ordinary decent people, though no one
      acknowledges Aron as we stay attached to his shoulder.

      There's a mini-Scooby Doo dancing in the main room and there's a
      light, early party atmosphere. Aron searches for the girls,
      approaching any cluster to see which girls they contain. The
      clusters part slightly as he approaches, give the camera polite
      smiles and then ignore us. The camera moves onto the next group,
      searching.




109   INT. ROPE BAG. NIGHT.                                    109

      Black. We can hear breathing in an enclosed space.

                           ARON
                I’ve not paid a lot of attention over
                the years. Said a few bad things about
                you, admit it. But I guess you know
                that. God.

      A long silence. Then a rustle and a sudden blast of light
      illuminates Aron. Ghostly green. The head-lamp bouncing off the
      shiny interior of the rope bag.


                          ARON (CONT’D)
                Look, God, I don’t know what to do. I
                don’t know what to do. I’ve tried
                everything I can think of. I. Don’t.
                Know. What. To do. You want me to go to
                church every Sunday, never climb again,
                never curse, whatever. It’s done. I’ll
                sign right on the line. Though I might
                have to write left-handed because- well,
                because, y’know, under the circumstances
                -

      A burst of hysterical laughter which frightens him. He wrestles
      himself back into control.

                          ARON (CONT’D)
                Seriously. I will. Just get me out of
                here. Please. Out of here.

      Pause. And then his entire body spasms with cold.

                          ARON (CONT’D)
                Ungg-ggg-ggg....!

      Five seconds of demonic shaking from the multi-coloured headless
      man. This too is scary for Aron.

                          ARON (CONT’D)
                Yeah. Funny.

      He lays his hooded face against the rock. Shuts his eyes.

      Black.

                             ARON (CONT’D)
                Oh, Jesus.




110   INT. ASPEN STORE. DAY.                                      110

      Aron is standing at one end of the store counter: at no point do
      we see Aron but we sense him in reflective surfaces, his arms,
      particularly his right one and his feet occasionally come into
      shot. As does a guide-book that Aron is flicking through. Brion
      glances up.

                          BRION
                Where you goin’?

                             ARON
                Dunno yet.

      He shuts the book, turns to go.

                          ARON (CONT’D)
                See you Tuesday.


                          BRION
                Have a good one.

                             ARON
                Always do.




111   C/U: DIGITAL NUMERALS.                                   111

      11.59 Changes to 00.00.




112   INT. CANYON. NIGHT.                                      112

      He pulls his bag off and pulls his water bottle out of the ground
      where he has half-buried it. It won't open. He can't unscrew it.
      He mutters, cursing himself for tightening the lid too much. He
      puts it between his teeth and levers with his head, but nothing.
      Is his strength vanishing so quickly?

      He looks at his puffy left hand, there's a tremble in it. He
      shakes it to get rid of the tremble and jams the bottle between
      his legs. He uses a bit of cloth to give his hand better purchase
      on the top. We're tight on the neck of the bottle as it releases,
      finally and he lifts it, slowly, almost ceremonially. Controlling
      the tilt, a half-mouthful of water slides onto his tongue. He
      tilts the bottle back towards upright but not the whole way. He
      waits. Circulating the splash of water around his mouth.




113   INT. CANYON. C/U: BOTTLE NECK                            113

      The bottle neck stares at Aron.




114   INT. CANYON. C/U: ARON                                   114

      ... his eyes staring at the bottle neck.




115   INT. CANYON. NIGHT.                                      115

      He still holds the water in his mouth as he rewinds the top onto
      the bottle and reburies it in the sand to stop any evaporation.
      He moves to pop his contact lenses into his mouth and wash them in
      the moisture. First one then the other as we...


116   INT. ARON’S APARTMENT. DAY.                                116

      The images shift with the lens change back to his apartment,
      daylight. The the phone rings once, twice... 3, 4, 5 times. The
      answer-phone clicks on.

      Aron’s cheery voice from another life.

                          ARON (ANSWER-PHONE)
                Hi Aron here! Leave a message.




117   INT. ARON’S APARTMENT. DAY.                                117

      In front of his bathroom mirror he's slipping his lenses in for
      the day. It looks like The Man Who Fell To Earth.

                          ANSWER-PHONE (MOM)
                Aron, it's Mom. Hoping to catch you.
                Nothing urgent. Dad's in New York so
                it'll be a quiet weekend.

      Aron is clearly there but can’t answer.




118   INT. C/U: VARIOUS. ARON & MIRROR. DAY.                     118

      Huge close-ups that freak people out who've never worn lenses.
      Mirror shots and lots of short soft focus.

                           ANSWER-PHONE (MOM)
                Call me.   Lots of love.

      The long tone of the disconnected line.




119   INT. CANYON FLOOR. PRE DAWN.                               119

      He is absolutely still. Almost absent.     Flies buzz around him.
      Indeterminate time passes.




120   INT. DESERT. PRE-DAWN. MASSIVE CLOSE UP.                   120

      Big as a JCB, an ant crawls across Aron’s face. His muscles twitch
      in response.


121   INT. ROPE BAG. PRE-DAWN.                                 121

      Aron’s eyes, open a slit. That’s as much rest as he gets. Targets
      some puffs of breath at the ant. Doesn’t work. Flicks the ant away
      with a finger. A couple of mosquitoes have appeared, hovering
      around.

      Caption: Monday


122   INT. CANYON. PRE-DAWN.                                   122

      Aron’s busy. He is threading the end of rope under and around the
      boulder. Ties it into a circle of rope with one hand.

      Next, he reaches as far up as he can- given the restrictions of
      his trapped arm- and ties overhand knots in the circle of rope
      already tied to the higher boulder. Each time, he falls back,
      breathing heavily before going up again. He is tireless.

      Now, he reaches up and clips a carabiner to the circle. Then back
      up to clip his rope through it. Clips the rope through another
      carabiner clipped to the rope around the lower boulder. Goes up
      again to clip another carabiner and another rope. Now it is clear
      he is making a pulley.

      Next, he takes a bight of rope and makes a hand loop.

      With a huge tug, he pulls down on the hand loop. The ropes of the
      pulley tighten. Pulls with all his might. Nothing.

      Undeterred, he ties a leg loop too. Puts one foot in and treads
      down hard as he is pulling. Nothing.

      This time, both his feet are in leg loops. He is pushing down as
      hard as he can, almost a temper tantrum of heaving, tugging and
      stamping. Nothing.

      He goes limp on the rope, open-mouthed with exhaustion and
      despair. Shuts his eyes. Tries to lick his parched lips.




123   INT/EXT. CANYON. VARIOUS. DAY.                           123

      Suddenly, we are crashing through the canyon, weaving this way and
      that, rollercoastering up and out onto flat desert. Past the
      chained-up bicycle and along the slick rock humps.


124   INT. ARON’S TRUCK. DAY.                                  124

      We crash into the back of the truck and there, lying on its side
      is an almost-full bottle of Gatorade. And a grapefruit! They’ve
      got sparkly condensation on them- like advertising spritzer mist -
      all over them. And then there’s another water bottle and an
      orange...


      The Gatorade lies on its side and the liquid seems to be slapping
      slowly, backward and forward like a Lava lamp, bulging with
      wetness and moisture.




125   INT. CANYON. DAY.                                        125

      Snap back to Aron’s face. Aron tries to lick his lips. But it’s a
      parody of lip licking. No saliva.

      He reaches down to the water bottle. Wets his lips with the
      tiniest drop. A frown crosses his face.




126   INT. CANYON. DAY.                                        126

      Aron is wrestling to unscrew the top of the Camelbak with his
      teeth. There’s panic here. Puts the cap on the top of the rock-
      nearly drops it in his haste. What’s the hurry. Unzips his flies
      in desperation, urinates into the Camelbak. Relief washes over his
      face.

      When he’s finished, he shakes the Camelbak, takes a tentative
      sniff which sends his head rearing back in disgust.


127   INT. CANYON. DAY. VIDEO MESSAGE TWO.                     127

      Aron speaking to the video. He is beginning to fray at the edges a
      bit. Thinner, hollow-eyed. Still holding it together, but there
      are hints of darkness in his occasionally wayward delivery. Aron
      is trying not to look at himself.

                          ARON
                It’s freaking me out looking at myself
                so I hope you guys are OK with this.

      Pause.




128   INT. CANYON. DAY. REAL TIME                              128

      We can see two images of him when we go behind the camera balanced
      on the rock as he has deliberately turned the screen away from
      himself.


129   INT. CANYON. DAY. VIDEO MESSAGE TWO.                     129

                          ARON
                It’s Monday. All day. Bummer. I spent
                the morning trying to rig a pulley.
                Worth a try. But there’s so much
                friction and it’s climbing rope. Too
                much stretch. What I need is twenty
                metres of static rap rope.


130   INT. ASPEN STORE. NIGHT.                                 130

      Aron is there like a night-burglar with his headlamp. The camera
      is looking at neat coils of rope, hanging from hooks on the wall
      of the store. As Aron recites his shopping list, the camera moves
      along the wall, recording the items, fetishising the smooth metal
      and bright colours of climbing gear. Occasionally, a hand appears,
      slipping off the rack the things he needs for escape. Carabiners,
      the multi-coloured slings, the ascenders, the bolts....

                          ARON V/O
                Nine point eight mill. Three or four
                pulleys, a rack of carabiners, slings, a
                power drill and a bolt kit. Oh, and
                eight guys to haul.

      And yes, there are eight burly men standing in the doorway.


131   INT. CANYON. DAY. VIDEO MESSAGE TWO.                     131

      A wry smile.

                          ARON
                That would do it.




132   INT. CANYON. DAY. REAL TIME.                             132

      We see him below us as the raven flies overhead. He flicks his
      head round to follow it as it goes.




133   INT. CANYON. DAY. VIDEO MESSAGE TWO.                     133

                           ARON
                There’s this raven. Flies overhead every
                morning. I clocked it at eight fifteen
                yesterday.

      Looks at his watch.


                          ARON (CONT’D)
                Right on time. I’ll film it for you
                tomorrow. I have about one hundred and
                fifty millilitres of water left, which
                will keep me alive until tomorrow night.
                If I’m lucky. And I peed twice already.
                It’s two days since I went last and then
                I nearly go wet myself. Bodily functions
                going weird on me. I saved the second
                lot in the Camelbak. Smells pretty rank,
                but it’ll settle, I guess. Let it
                chill...Like Sauvignon Blanc... No
                number twos. Which will disappoint my
                insect friends.   They're gonna have to
                wait. What else? I get fifteen minutes
                of sun at nine thirty.




134   INT. CANYON. DAY. REAL TIME.                             134

      Aron is deathly still as we travel towards him with a dagger of
      light. His leg is stretched out and the only movement is the
      change of leg halfway through. He stays in shot throughout getting
      bigger and then smaller as the light approaches and recedes.


135   INT. BACK OF CAR. DAY.                                   135

      Black. A car engine dies. A car door slams. Blurred vision. Aron’s
      Dad leans in.

                          ARON’S DAD
                We’re here, kiddo.

      We get out of the car, the camera our POV. Moves past the car.
      Stops to allow us to take in what we are seeing. We are standing
      on the lip of the Grand Canyon as the sun is coming up. Hundreds
      of miles of red desert stretch out in front of him.

                           YOUNG ARON V/O
                Man....!

      We burst up and away, getting the briefest view of Young Aron and
      his Dad before they are dots in the maze of canyons.


136   INT. CANYON. DAY. VIDEO MESSAGE TWO.                     136

                             ARON
                   I keep chipping at the rock, but more to
                   keep warm than anything else. I’m pretty
                   sure it’s actually making it worse. If
                   that’s possible.

      Big pause.

                              ARON (CONT’D)
                   So.

      Smiles in a slightly embarrassed way.

                             ARON (CONT’D)
                   I found this great tourniquet....




137   INT. CANYON. DAY.                                        137

      There is excitement on Aron’s face. We see him pull the elastic
      neoprene tubing insulation from the Camelbak. Stretchy and strong,
      it emerges like a long snake. Perfect. He wraps the neoprene strip
      around his right forearm, below the elbow. Tightens it with his
      teeth. Knots it again. And again. Clips a carabiner into the end
      and twists and twists it tight. Bizarrely, this is great.

                             ARON
                   Owww. Oh, yeah. That hurts. That hurts.

      Takes out the multi-tool and switches to the long blade. Then he
      presses the blade and draws it quickly across his forearm.
      Nothing. Repeats it harder. Then slashes hard, sawing viciously at
      the same point.

                             ARON (CONT’D)
                   Shit. Shit, shit.

      Releases the tourniquet, allowing blood flow to return to his arm
      and a series of angry red slash marks to reveal themselves.

                              ARON (CONT’D)
                   That it?

      He looks at the blade. Blows out a long, disgusted jet of air.

                              ARON (CONT’D)
                   Useless.


138   INT. CANYON. DAY. VIDEO MESSAGE TWO.                        138

      Smiley again, in a slightly worrying way. The camera skims over
      the slash marks. Back onto Aron’s face.

                          ARON
                Lesson: don’t buy the cheap, made-in-
                China multi-tool. Couldn’t find my Swiss
                Army Knife. This one came free with a
                flashlight. And the flashlight was shit
                too....Kept it in the truck for-
                emergencies...

      Another wry smile.

                          ARON (CONT’D)
                Not blaming you, Mom. Really. As
                stocking-stuffers go, more than okay.
                How were you to know I’d get into this
                much trouble?

      He looks directly into the lens for the first time.

                          ARON (CONT’D)
                Hey, Sonja. I can hear you saying it.

        ARON (IN VISION) (CONT’D)                 SONJA (OOV)
      Aron’s really gone and done        Aron’s really gone and done
      it this time.                      it this time.




139   INT. ARON’S FAMILY HOME DAY. REAL TIME.                     139

      We are looking through the window. There are his Mom and Dad,
      sitting on the sofa at home, his Dad with a glass of soda half-way
      to his lips. They are listening to his sister Sonja, aged 10 in
      this scene, who is sitting at the piano, playing Chopin’s Nocturne
      number 2 in E Flat. Quiet and haunting. Across the room, Young
      Aron, aged 15, is filming the scene with a video camera.

      We see the scene from the Young Aron’s point of view- a stripy
      harsh-coloured video, moving in on Young Sonja until she turns and
      mouths silently- and very politely- the words “go away” to the
      camera before turning her attention back to the music.

      We catch the Older Aron’s ghostly reflection looking through the
      window, his hand touching the window pane.




140   INT. CANYON. DAY.                                           140


      Aron smiles.


                          ARON
                Way to go Sis.


141   INT. CANYON. DAY.                                        141

      Aron shakes his water bottle to check the contents. He opens the
      top, tilts and then holds the water in his mouth as he
      ritualistically removes his contact lenses and washes them in his
      mouth.

      Suddenly a shiver tears across him like an attack dog. He coughs a
      lens out. As he tries to catch it before it disappears in the
      sand, he tips the bottle in his lap.

      The bottle falls horizontally on his shorts and a leak of sacred
      fluid darkens his tan shorts. He whips it upright.

                          ARON
                No....! Useless fucking idiot! Jesus,
                pay attention.

      He screws the lid carefully on. Shakes the bottle. Scarcely
      anything in there now. Can barely be bothered to lift the contact
      lens to his eye. But he does.

      BIG C/U: EYE.

      The contact lens slips onto Aron’s open eye. He blinks and a
      shutter comes briefly down on the screen, raising again to reveal
      we are now in...




142   INT. UNKNOWN. NIGHT.                                     142

      ... the back of a vehicle crowded with people. Subjective camera
      means that we are Aron’s POV. In front of him, at least half a
      dozen of his friends and Rana are excitedly chattering - though we
      can hear nothing.

      Gradually, it becomes clear that it’s night outside. They are
      undressing in their seats - not an easy thing to do - eliciting
      lots of laughter, more infantile than sexual.

      There’s a ferocious blizzard outside the vehicle. We’re up a
      mountain, being buffeted by massive gusts of wind, hail and snow.

      They prepare themselves for a mutual signal.

                             RANA
                Go!

      And all the windows come down. The blizzard explodes inside the
      vehicle.


143   EXT. MOUNTAIN. NIGHT.                                    143

      One shot outside. POVs of naked arms out the windows, shaking and
      saluting the storm. Their crazy, happy faces can be seen laughing
      through the windscreen as the snow invades the inside of the
      vehicle.




144   INT. VEHICLE. NIGHT.                                     144

      Through the blizzard of snow inside the vehicle, the waving arms,
      the chaos, Rana’s face turns from the front seat to face the
      camera.

                          RANA
                    (her hand placed on her heart)
                I love you.




145   INT. CANYON. SUNSET.                                     145

      Eyes, shut, Aron is dangling in his harness. He is so still, he
      might be dead.

      An ant wanders across his free arm. The arm twitches. Twitches
      again, then shakes the ant off it. No more movement.




146   INT. BACK OF TRUCK. DAY.                                 146

      The back of the truck is decked out with a mattress and sleeping
      bag. This is camping, Colorado style. Outside, lie trees and a
      lake.

      We are looking down at Rana on Aron’s chest. As ever with Aron’s
      memories, the camera is our POV, Aron’s eyes. We never see him,
      only her. There’s clearly been sex and there’s clearly going to be
      sex. The pheromones are coming off the screen. She puts a finger
      on his heart. Puts her head to it, listening.

                          RANA
                So how do I get in, huh? What is the-

       Her English deserts her momentarily. She mimes turning a safe’s
      combination lock on his chest.

                          ARON V/O
                Combination.


                          RANA
                Combination.




147   INT. CANYON. SUNSET.                                      147

      The faintest of smiles from Aron. He mumbles the words.

                          ARON
                If I told you I’d have to kill you.




148   INT. BACK OF TRUCK. DAY.                                  148

                          RANA
                Already you kill me.

      Her hand reaches down out of sight of the camera.

                          RANA (CONT’D)
                Ah. The combination. I have it.

      She slides slowly down his chest.




149   INT. CANYON. SUNSET.                                      149

      Suddenly, CRACK! A sound that makes Aron - and us - startle out of
      our seats.

      He looks around, wide-eyed with fear.

      Another crack. He looks down. Dark spots on his shorts.


150   EXT. SLOT CANYON. DAY. ARON’S POV. SUNSET                 150

      Looks up. There’s an angry-looking, black motherfucker of a cloud
      above him.


151   INT. CANYON. SUNSET.                                      151

      C./U on Aron’s eyes. We look up at the sky. A blob of rain
      spatters the lens. And then another.


152   EXT. CANYON. SUNSET.                                     152

      Suddenly, a crack of thunder like the earth has just split.

      A flash of Aron driving past the roadside sign that reads “DANGER
      FLASH FLOODS”.

      Aron reacts as if it’s come to get him. Panic.

                             ARON
                No. No...

      He wrenches at the boulder, pulls, pushes. Moans, heaves. Nothing,
      of course.




153   EXT. DESERT. SUNSET.                                     153

      Massive, thunderhead clouds rolling in, impossibly fast. The
      desert dust is hit by silent bullets. Raindrops gathering and
      multiplying, soaking the sand dark, and then flowing into a groove
      and slit, being joined by other rivulets until water is running,
      finding its way along the jagged cracks in the ground.

      Above us, the sky is furious black. Lightning arcs across the sky.




154   INT. CANYON. SUNSET.                                     154

      Aron’s sky darkens above him. He looks truly scared, has somehow
      found some energy. Gathers his possessions together. Sticks out
      his tongue to catch the drops.

                          ARON
                Please God, not this. Not this.




155   EXT. DESERT. SUNSET.                                     155

      Water is pouring into a bigger channel. We are with the water,
      being joined by other rivulets until in turn, we join a bigger
      water-course.


156   EXT. DESERT. SUNSET.                                     156

      Another channel explodes as a volume of water engulfs it. The
      camera literally slips and slides as the water picks up speed,
      looking for release, for a gulley, for a - canyon.


157   INT. CANYON. SUNSET.                                     157

      The bottom of the canyon has become a river. It is surging down
      the natural pipe-work of the desert.


158   EXT. BLUE JOHN CANYON. S-SHAPED LOG. SUNSET.             158

      From below, we are looking at the S-shaped log as unimaginable
      tons of water come pouring suddenly over the lip of the canyon.
      The canyon becomes a six foot wall of churning mud and debris,
      hurtling downwards.


159   INT. CANYON. SUNSET.                                     159

      We see Aron in the distance, tugging at his arm. Water is bubbling
      up from the ground, forcing itself up through the sand between his
      feet. Without time to register, the wall of water hits him.


160   INT. CANYON. SUNSET.                                     160

      In an instant, he is engulfed with freezing water. Gasping at the
      cold, wrenching his head to one side to get out of the main force
      of the blast. He tries to gain height, but the water is filling
      the canyon by the second.

                          ARON
                No, no, no, no.....

      His head is only just above the water level. He is going under.
      Takes a last few desperate breaths before the water closes over
      him.


161   INT. CANYON. UNDERWATER. SUNSET.                         161

      We’re with Aron underwater, in the churning, dark waters. Only
      Aron’s head-lamp flashing around desperately.

      Then in the maelstrom of mud, we see the boulder shift. A
      thrashing of body. The arm pulls, tugs. And then, he is free.

      He steps on the boulder and powers upwards.

      Aron’s face coming up, roaring for breath. Gasping, choking.
      Alive.


162   INT. CANYON. SUNSET.                                     162

      A hand appears from the slot, clutches at the canyon lip. Finds a
      hold. Pulls. Aron’s exhausted body heaves itself half onto the
      plateau, rests on his stomach, heaving. Takes his damaged arm with
      his good arm and hauls it- like a dead thing- and slaps it over
      the lip.


163   EXT. WIDE CANYON. SUNSET.                                163

      Painfully, slowly, Aron rolls onto his back. Stares at the pink,
      orange, deep blue streaks in the sky. Heaves himself upright.
      Looks down at his hand.

      Mottled white and grey, a dead surgical glove at the end of his
      arm.

      Aron gets to his knees. His feet. Steadies himself for a long
      moment. And then starts to stagger forwards, a man learning to
      walk again. Grunting with pain and exhaustion.




164   EXT. STEEP SLOPE. NIGHT.                                 164

      One-armed, Aron drags himself, painful inch by inch, from one step
      to another. He slumps upright, his head actually resting on the
      rock, eyes almost closed. On some auto-pilot.

      He almost falls over the last holds. Lies on the ground, staring
      up at the stars in the sky.

      A shooting star sparkles across the sky.

      C/U: shooting star.

      A blaze of burning rocks, white hot, tumbling impossibly through
      space.

      C/U: ARON’S FACE.

      A reflection of the star’s trail in Aron’s eye.




165   EXT. CAR PARK. NIGHT.                                    165

      Aron is kneeling by the back door of his truck. His face is flush
      with the smooth metal, actually against it. A smile of love. He
      could be kissing it. But he’s actually trying to unlock it, his
      face inches from the lock, his trembling hand wrestling with the
      keys. Eventually, he gets the key in. Turns it. Bliss.


166   EXT. CAR PARK. NIGHT.                                    166

      Aron is sitting, slumped against his truck, drinking the bottle of
      Gatorade.

      C.U of his throat as it gulps and gulps. Gatorade is running all
      over his face. He can’t get it down fast enough. It is liquid
      pornography.


      Aron pauses to groan with sheer delight. Looks down at his useless
      hand. Starts laughing and laughing. With relief, with delight.




167   INT. ARON’S TRUCK. NIGHT.                                167

      Aron driving. One-handed. The pain is coming in waves that make
      him hunch over the wheel, but he keeps going.

      Holds the steering wheel with his legs. Punches the radio. Music
      crashes in on us. A grimace of pleasure from Aron.

      The occasional sign flashes past. Seems to leave a trace on his
      retina, on the screen.




168   EXT. TOWN. NIGHT.                                        168

      Aron is driving through a large, deserted town. All the street
      signs and shop lights seem extra-bright, painful on the eye.
      These, too, are leaving a faint, hallucinogenic trace on the
      screen. Aron is clearly getting weak.

                          ARON
                C’mon, c’mon. Nearly there.




169   EXT. SUBURBAN STREET. NIGHT.                             169

      Aron gets out of his truck. Walks up the middle of the street. Lit
      from behind by streetlights, he strikes a battered but heroic
      figure as he strides towards us in silhouette. Turns into the
      drive of a house.


170   EXT. RANA’S APARTMENT. NIGHT.                            170

      Stands on the step. Gathers himself from the pain in his hand.
      Leans on the door, resting his head. Pulls back. Rings the bell.

                          ARON
                Rana.

      A light goes on. A cautious voice.

                          RANA O/S
                Who’s there?

                          ARON
                Rana, it’s Aron.


                            RANA O/S
                Aron?

      Rana opens the door. We see her standing there in all her beauty.
      Behind her the room is lit softly. A fire burns in the grate. It
      is a vision of intimacy, comfort, safety.

      In slow motion, Rana smiles at Aron. She holds out her arms to
      him.

      We see Aron’s face. He is talking, but no sound is coming out of
      his mouth.

      Rana keeps smiling. Steps to one side to invite him in.

      Aron trying to communicate, trying to form words.

      Rana’s smile drops. She looks disappointed. Slowly, slowly, closes
      the door.

      C/U: ARON’S FACE

      Aron’s lips are moving. He is desperately trying to say something.




171   INT. CANYON. NIGHT.                                       171

      Aron’s lips are still moving, desperately. But he is in the rope
      bag. He never went anywhere. Oh, Jesus.

      He rips off the rope bag. Wailing, screams, cries. Finally, after
      so much control, so much order, this is despair. Naked, terrifying
      despair. A true rending of a soul gone beyond hope for release or
      rescue, into the darkest pit of loneliness. This is a man, dying
      on his own in the universe.

                          ARON
                Oh, God, oh God, oh God....

      Gradually the sobbing subsides. He is slumped by the boulder,
      encased in his own pity. Motionless for a long, long time.




172   EXT. CANYON. SUNRISE.                                     172

      Hundreds of miles of canyon. The inner canyons change from dark
      umbers and black shadows to immense bands of pastel yellow, white,
      green and a myriad shades of red. A hallucinogenic movement
      towards light.


173   C/U: DIGITAL NUMERALS.                                   173

      The massive numbers go from 6.59 to 7.00.



      Title.

      Tuesday.


174   INT. CANYON. SUNRISE. VIDEO MESSAGE THREE.               174

                           V/O
                 Good morning, America!

      There’s a chorus of Good Mornings from a thousand American TV and
      radio shows from Texas to Oregon, Massachusetts to the Carolinas.

                           ARON
                 Good morning, everyone! It’s seven
                 o’clock in Canyonland, USA. Today, on
                 the boulder, we’ve got a special guest -
                 the self-styled American Superhero Aron
                 Ralston. Shout it out, Aron!

      Applause from the studio audience. Where the hell did they come
      from?

      Flashes of Aron’s photos. Hero poses on top of various snowy
      peaks, crags, on bikes with huge panoramas stretching away beneath
      him.

                           ARON (CONT’D)
                 Thank you! Pleasure to be here!

      Suddenly, Aron has adopted the role of chat-show host, switching
      voices and persona with frightening dexterity.

                           ARON (CONT’D)
                 Can I say a big hi to Mom and Dad in
                 Englewood, Colorado?

                           ARON THE HOST
                 Mom and Dad! Never forget Mom and Dad.
                 Right, Aron?

                           ARON
                 Umm. Yeah. Sorry I didn’t pick up the
                 other night, Mom. Would have told you
                 where I was going and - well - wouldn’t
                 be stuck here now, would I?

                           ARON THE HOST
                 Well, I always like to say, your supreme
                 selfishness is our gain, Aron. Anyone
                 else you’d like to say hi to?


                     ARON
           Sure. Hi Brion at work! I’m not gonna
           make it in today, I’m afraid.

A big laugh from the audience.

                      ARON THE HOST
           A question coming in from another Aron,
           this one in Loser Canyon, Utah. Aron
           asks: “am I right in thinking that even
           if Brion at work did notify the police,
           they’d put a 24 hour hold on it before
           filing a missing person’s report, which
           means that you’d only become officially
           missing midday Wednesday at the
           earliest?’

                     ARON
           Right on the money, Aron. So they’d get
           about four hours searching before dark,
           then they’d call it off until Thursday
           first light - by which time I’ll be
           dead!

                     ARON THE HOST
           And how do you know all of this, Aron
           from Loser Canyon, Utah?

Puts his finger to the invisible ear-piece as if talking to the
questioner down the line.

                     ARON
           Oh, well, I know all this ‘cos I’m a
           volunteer in the rescue service- I’m
           something of a big, fucking, hard, hero.
           I can do it all. On. My. Own. You see?

                     ARON THE HOST
           Yes, I do see. And is it true that
           despite, or maybe because you’re a big,
           fucking, hard hero you neglected to tell
           anyone where you were going?

                     ARON
           That is entirely correct.

A pause.

                     ARON THE HOST
           Anyone?

                     ARON
           Anyone.

                     ARON THE HOST
           Oops.


                           ARON
                Oops.

      His unnaturally cheerful face falls as the energy seeps away.
      Stares straight into camera. Devastated.

                          ARON (CONT’D)
                Mom, Dad, I really love you guys. I
                wanted to take this time to say the
                times we've spent together have been
                awesome. I haven't appreciated you in my
                own heart the way I know I could. Mom, I
                love you. I wish I'd returned all your
                calls. Ever.
                I really have lived this last year.
      Beat.

                          ARON (CONT’D)
                Sonja, your wedding. Have a good one.
                Zach’s a good guy. I know I promised I’d
                play at your wedding. We’d play. Real
                sorry about that.

      Beat

                          ARON (CONT’D)
                I wish I had learned some lessons more
                astutely, more rapidly, than I did. I
                love you guys. I'll always be with you.

      Electronic static.




175   INT. CANYON. DAY.                                        175

      Aron, slumped. A noise, a swoop of wings. He grabs the camera just
      in time to catch the very end of the raven’s flight along the line
      of the canyon.

                           ARON
                Shit. Missed it. 8.31. He’s late. Still
                missed it.

      We can hear his heart pounding. Unnaturally fast. He holds his
      hand to it, trying to calm it, slow it down.

      A flash of a woman’s finger tracing a circle on his naked chest
      where his heart lies.




176   INT. CANYON. DAY.                                        176

      A hand plunging the multi-tool blade straight into his arm. Up to
      the hilt.


      He lets go, leaving the knife embedded. He swoons, and stares at
      it, the whole picture going blurred for a moment. He tightens the
      carabiner attached to the makeshift tourniquet on his upper arm
      then grasps the tool and wriggles it slightly. The blade connects
      with something hard. He taps the knife down and feels it knocking
      on the radius bone on his upper forearm.

      He puts his ear close to his arm and wiggles the knife again. We
      hear the thocking noise.

                          ARON
                Bone.

      He pulls the knife out, opening the wound.

                          ARON (CONT’D)
                No way.

      Said with despair. Wipes the sweat away. So dry in the mouth, he
      is gagging. Pulls the lid off his water bottle. Shakes it. Drinks
      down the last precious drops.

      Holds the bottle above his mouth to catch the final drops. Licks
      the inside as far as his tongue will reach. Screws the lid back
      on. Puts the bottle back down.



      C/U: DIGITAL NUMERALS.

      8.00

      Loosens the tourniquet. Watches the blood come back into his arm.

      Picks up the video camera.


177   INT. CANYON. DAY. VIDEO MESSAGE FOUR.                    177

      Again, there’s a touch of hysteria lurking in the delivery. A
      mixture of too formal and too wild.

                           ARON
                At precisely eight AM, I finished the
                last of the water. The last of the clean
                water, anyway. Kinda gulped it down in
                response to... Tried cutting off my arm
                again... Let’s just say it didn’t go
                that well.

      He swings the camera onto the bloody hole he has made in his arm.

                          ARON (CONT’D)
                A short career in surgery as it turns
                out. Surprisingly little blood - I guess
                it’s thickening up but... These knives.
                No way. The bone. Can’t get through the
                bone. Blunt.
                          (MORE)

                             ARON (CONT’D)
                   Next Christmas a proper Leatherman,
                   yeah, Mom? Next Christmas....

      He shrugs.

                             ARON (CONT’D)
                   Well, I tried.

      Long pause.

                             ARON (CONT’D)
                   Out of water.

      An even longer pause.

                             ARON (CONT’D)
                   I’m really fucked now.




178   INT. CANYON. TWILIGHT.                                   178

      Night is falling. Aron is slumped in his harness, leaning against
      the boulder. Perhaps for the first time we get the sense that he
      has given up.




179   INT. CANYON. NIGHT. REAL TIME.                           179

      Aron tips the Camelbak very cautiously towards his mouth. Takes
      a mouthful of urine. Retches. But keeps it down. Summons all his
      strength and takes another sip.

      Retches again.




180   INT. ROPE BAG. NIGHT.                                    180

      He holds the video camera at waist height and switches it to
      playback. He rewinds through his messages. Stops, switches off
      playback and rewinds the blue LCD screen to save battery. The
      light is surreal, soft LCD hell.




181   INT. DOME POOL. DAY. VIDEO FOOTAGE.                      181

      Kristi and Megan. The Dome. They clamber out in wet clothes -
      it’s from after their first jumps. We see all three of them
      climb and fall and get out of the water and climb and fall,
      smashing into the azure water.


      Their faces are dripping wet, beaming mad, screaming and
      howling, completely natural, children really, on their first
      helter-skelter / Big Dipper.

      He rewinds this time in vision. Kristi’s bra and pants are
      soaking. Megan’s top cascades water as she rises out of the
      water.




182   INT. ROPE BAG. NIGHT.                                    182

      For Aron the volume of his and their shouting is deafening and
      the first human sounds he has heard for days. He watches,
      staring, laughing; not laughing, staring, eyes tearing in self-
      pity.


      C/U: VIDEO CAMERA

      HE STOPS IT IN VISION

      There’s water, joy, 2 beautiful girls, happiness, sensuality,
      company, freedom...




183   INT. ROPE BAG. NIGHT.                                    183

      He looks at the picture and then into the bag. His breathing is
      hard, pronounced. He carefully tells himself...

                          ARON
                No. No. Don’t.

      He sees the moisture on the inside of the bag, condensation. He
      licks it with his sticky tongue, twice, three times. He looks
      back at the LCD screen.


      The LCD looks back at him.


      He kills the image and snaps it shut.




184   INT. CANYON. NIGHT.                                      184

      Aron smashing at the rock.


185   INT. CANYON. NIGHT.                                       185

      Aron decants his urine from the Camelbak into his water
      bottle.

                                                        CUT TO:


186   INT. CANYON. NIGHT.                                       186

      The head-lamp is weak, almost dead on batteries. Aron is chipping
      at an entirely new area of rock. This is odd.

      Then we see what he is chipping. His name and the date he was
      born. And the date he is going to die. He is chipping his own
      headstone. There is something jumpy about it. Missing frames.
      Unnatural.

188   INT. CANYON. NIGHT.                                       188

      More fast-motion chipping. He stops. Utterly still. There’s
      something in the dark behind him. Coming towards him?




189   BIG C/U. NIGHT.                                           189

      Aron’s eyes snap open from his micro-sleep.


190   INT. CANYON. NIGHT.                                       190

      More crazed chipping. A noise. He turns. There’s definitely
      something there.

      He looks demented with silent fear. Fumbles for something in his
      sack. Pulls out his stills camera and charges the flash. We hear
      it humming as it charges.

      The canyon bursts with light as his camera flash goes off. For a
      split second, in front of him stands the inflatable Scooby Doo,
      its arms waving madly at him. And then, blackness again. He
      charges the flash again. He flashes again. This time, empty
      canyon. Aron whimpers in the dark.


191   INT. CANYON. DAY.                                        191

      Aron’s head, lolling at the neck as if the muscles are gone, mouth
      open, staring up at the slot of blue sky above. Slowly, a 747
      crosses the canyon; high, silver, untouchable. He watches it all
      the way. We can hear his heart racing. He holds his left hand to
      his heart, hoping to calm it down.




192   INT. STADIUM. NIGHT.                                     192

      Thousands of people enjoying the basketball. Aron and Rana are in
      their midst and in the middle of a furious row. Aron’s shoulder
      POV again.

                          RANA
                    (mad with frustration and pain)
                If I go, if I get up from this seat, I’m
                not getting a fucking coke, Aron, I’m
                gone, you understand? You and me. Gone.
                Forever. Is that what you want? Huh?

      Clearly, Aron is silent. She gets up, turns to let him stop her.

                          RANA (CONT’D)
                Nothing. Rien. Fuck! You are frozen, you
                know that? Okay. Over.

      She starts ramming her way past the spectators in the row.



193   INT. CANYON. DAY.                                        193

      Aron imagines her brushing past and above him, reliving it. His
      hand is still on his heart, like the Pledge.




194   INT. STADIUM. NIGHT.                                     194

      As Rana reaches the end of the row we see how upset she is. But
      her final comment is sad, not angry.

                          RANA
                You’re gonna be so lonely, Aron.

      And she goes. Revealing him alone in the crowd. He is present in
      his POV scenes for the first time. It’s shocking to see how
      healthy he is. And how embarrassed he is by the public row. He
      looks around the roaring stadium.

      The crowd splits the screens, as at the beginning. Their faces
      smear, dragged and distorted from one screen to the next.


      On one of the screens, Aron is alone in the canyon, looking at
      himself in the only empty seat amongst thousands.

      INT/EXT VARIOUS
      The rest of Wednesday and Wednesday night play out through the
      triptych. Repetition is used to create a trippy sense of losing
      coherence- sometimes there are three Arons doing the same thing.
      Sometimes, the past or the present are running on different
      sections of the triptych at the same time.

      At key moments, it resolves to one image and then back again.
      Things seem to loop and his close-ups almost seem to watch the
      loops happening again and again. This is particularly true inside
      the rope bag at night. When his light is switched on, it’s
      bleached and monstrously overlit, like cruel HD close-ups. Without
      water, his disintegration is terrifyingly fast.

      When the head-lamp is off, we establish a night vision of green
      and blue that allows us to witness him in hiding. The images play
      out on the interior surface of the bag. The effect is like
      wraparound Imax, multi-screen Technicolor.

          this. To this little crack in the
          earth’s surface. To this boulder.

On all three screens, he smiles.


      LEFT SCREEN          MIDDLE SCREEN          RIGHT SCREEN

      On all three panels, we see different images of Mom, Dad, Sonja
      and Rana, mixing and merging places on the screen. Aron is
      oblivious to the voices. He is chipping away at the rock.

                          RANA V/O
                There he is!

                          MOM V/O
                He’s over here!

                Found you!

      ON ALL THREE SCREENS:

      The sun spills onto Aron’s head. He lolls back, bathing in
      it.

                Sorry about the wedding.

      INT. SOFA CHAMBER.

      Sonja sits on the sofa in the canyon.

      A montage of video messages, scratchy static in between.

      RANA:
      You’re gonna be
      So lonely, Aron.


      ON ALL THREE SCREENS:

      Aron shivering in the rope bag:

      INT. ROPE BAG. NIGHT.

      Electronic static for a moment.


      The screen comes back to life again, focussed on Aron again. He is
      struggling to communicate through his slow death.

                          ARON (CONT’D)
                All of this. It all makes sense.
                Everything comes together. Me, I chose
                it. Chose to turn away from everyone.
                Chose... this. Sort of perfect, really.

      He’s fading out, like a radio station out of range. Pulls himself
      back for one last effort.

                          ARON (CONT’D)
                This is important. I need you all to
                understand. Every one of you. I need you
                to understand that it’s okay. All of
                this...

      He smiles at the camera. A brave, unmanic, genuine smile.

                          ARON (CONT’D)
                I’m- I’m cool with it. At peace. It’s
                okay. It’s alright. Really. Everything.
                Is. Alright.

      And he clicks the camera off.

      BLACK.

      Out of the darkness we are gradually aware that we are staring at
      the liquid black of Aron’s eyeball. It blinks once. You can hear
      it. Eye socket rasping against eyeball.

      A rumbling thunderous sound grows and grows as the three panels
      turn into two.

      LEFT SCREEN                          RIGHT SCREEN

      top of the canyon. It’s followed     Parts of his face seem to
      by dozens of horses stampeding       slowly implode. It’s as
      across his roof.                     though he’s decaying into
                                           dust.

      EXT. SKY. DAY. SINGLE SCREEN.

      Through a veil of dust we can just see the raven beat its
      wings across the canyon.

      LEFT SCREEN                          RIGHT SCREEN


      Aron’s body mass seems to           C/U: Inside the bag, the
      collapse in a soft explosion        dry decay has almost

198   INT. CANYON. DAY. SINGLE SCREEN.                           198

      Ants move across Aron’s lifeless face. No movement at all.


199   INT. CANYON. DAY.                                          199

      A shaft of sunlight beyond him in the open canyon turns the screen
      glowing pink, orange, golden. The sound of a giggle. Definitely a
      giggle. The laugh of a happy, small child.


200   BIG C/U.                                                   200

      Aron’s eye slowly opens.


201   INT. CANYON. DAY. SINGLE SCREEN.                           201

      Aron lifts the rope-bag off his face.




202   INT. OPEN CANYON. DAY.                                     202

      Standing right in the glare of the sunlight, stands a small boy.
      Right next to the sofa on which Aron’s friends gathered earlier.
      He can’t be more than three years old. Standing there in a red
      polo shirt. The boy smiles at him.




203   INT. CANYON. DAY.                                          203

      Aron stares back at him. A figure walks to join the boy in the
      open canyon. It’s Aron. The sunlight hitting his face like a
      train. We can’t see his damaged arm, but it is clear that he is
      free. He keeps moving towards the boy. And the boy starts towards
      him, running until Aron crouches and lifts him, laughing into the
      sun.


204   INT. CANYON. DAY.                                        204

      Aron stares at them playing, at them prancing around and on the
      sofa, pretending to walk downhill behind the sofa. A happy day.
      Like any father and his son.

      He stretches towards the image, yearning. His arm stops him, but
      he keeps stretching. When he looks back to the open canyon, only
      the boy is there now. Sitting. Smiling.

      Aron stretches further, using his feet to push him up over the
      rock.

      Aron blinks and the boy is gone.

      Suddenly, Aron is wide awake, focussed. He feels his arm with his
      good hand. Contorts himself so that he is weighting the trapped
      arm.




205   INT. BONE. DAY.                                          205

      We are watching the bleached-white bone of Aron’s radius in
      startling close up. Stripped of blood and sinew, it is pure and
      beautiful bone. And when Aron leans towards the boy, it bends.


206   INT. CANYON. DAY.                                        206

                            ARON
                Yes. Yes!

      He pulls and pulls with his left hand over the boulder, creating
      maximum upward force on his right arm. Starts bouncing. Hard,
      harder. His teeth are clamped shut. No sound.

      POW.

      Like a gunshot in the canyon, the bone breaks. The sound echoes.
      He looks at the bone pushing down against the skin. He touches the
      jagged edge. No sound.

      Amazingly, he smiles.

                          ARON (CONT’D)
                Well, you’re in it now.

      He humps his body down and under the chockstone, smearing with his
      feet against the wall. He pushes his body further and further
      round the dark side of the chockstone with a silent, furious
      intensity.

      BANG.


      A second gun shot echoes around the canyon. He’s sweating heavily
      and yet has a euphoria in his eyes. He checks the underneath of
      his arm. Yep, another broken bone. A yelp of laughter escapes.

      He can rotate his forearm as if it’s a shaft inside a housing.

      Still, he makes no sound. There is a high-pitched ringing in his
      ears. Nothing else.


207   INT. CANYON. DAY.                                        207

      Picks up the knife. Pauses, with the blade above his wrist. Here
      we go. He pushes the knife hard to the hilt in between two veins
      in his wrist.

      Sweat pouring out of him. His tongue flicks out automatically to
      catch the occasional drop.

      Sawing downwards, he makes as large a hole as he can without
      tearing any of the noodle-like veins. He puts the knife in his
      teeth and pokes his left forefinger and thumb inside his right
      arm.

      Drops of sweat falling on the knife blade.

      He pulls muscle up, nearer the surface, allowing his knife to
      slice and pare away at a fragment of muscle bit by bit. It takes
      a dozen actions, each time the knife goes back to his teeth so his
      free hand can arrange the meat.

      Sort. Pinch. Rotate. Slice.

      Blood flows, though surprisingly little. He stops briefly to twist
      up the tourniquet.

      Silence.


208   INT. CANYON. DAY.                                        208

      He can’t cut the tendon, no matter how hard he slices. But nothing
      will stop his addiction to surgery now. He fold in and swaps the
      blades for the pliers. He uses them to bite into an edge of the
      yellowy tendon. Then squeezing and twisting, he tears away a
      fragment.

      Grip. Squeeze. Twist. Tear.

      Finally, he tears the last fibre of tendon. Stares at his
      handiwork. With a sniff of satisfaction, returns to his knife
      blade.


209   INT. CANYON. DAY.                                        209

      Finally, all that remains inside is a pale white strand. Like a
      swollen length of angel-hair pasta. The nerve.


      He touches it gently with the blade of his knife.

                          ARON
                Aaaagggggghhhhhh!

      After so long in silence, the scream is shocking, long and utterly
      terrifying. He’s stunned. Stock-still with fear.


210   INT. CANYON. DAY.                                        210

      He stares at the nerve. The nerve looks back. It’s like a Mexican
      stand-off. It could go on all day.


211   INT. CANYON. DAY.                                        211

      Out of the corner of his eye, the boy is there. Smiling patiently.
      Aron whips his head around. The boy is gone. But he definitely saw
      him.

                             ARON
                Just this.

      He pulls the knife in and pulls it towards him: an inch, two
      inches. It lengthens like pulling a guitar string. Unimaginable
      pain builds in his body until finally the nerve snaps. And Aron
      snaps.

                             ARON (CONT’D)
                Aaaagghh.

      Retching, slumps in a heap, head lolling forward, his head buzzing
      and ringing with trauma.


212   C/U: DIGITAL NUMERALS.                                   212

      The numbers flick fast. There’s ten minutes gone in a flash. The
      numbers slow... and stop.


213   INT. CANYON. DAY.                                        213

      He’s back upright, cutting, sawing, stretching the skin like he’s
      a butcher, using the canyon wall as his chopping block. Huge
      energy suddenly. Sweat running in his eyes, blurred vision,
      rasping, parched breathing.

      And then he’s staggering backwards. Free. His hand, just stuck
      there, a stump in the crack. He stares at it, wild-eyed. He’s out
      here. And his hand is in there. Weird.

      His head is swarming with colours, his legs faltering like a new
      foal. He stumbles up to the canyon wall. Stares close at his own
      obituary: Aron Oct 75 - April 03 RIP.


                          ARON
                Aron, you are not dying here.


214   INT. CANYON. DAY.                                        214

      Aron is busy. Wrapping his arm in the plastic grocery sack and
      then wrapping that with the yellow webbing he wore around his neck
      to keep himself warm at night. He stuffs his arm into the empty
      Camelbak pack and throws the straps around his neck to make a
      sling.

      Packs his bag, water reservoir, video, pocket knife. Grabs his
      climbing rope and heads off down the canyon.

      Turns. Goes back. Takes the camera from the outside pouch of his
      sack and takes a photograph of the boulder - and his severed hand.

      Looks up, around, searching for somebody.

                             ARON
                Thank you.


215   INT. CANYON. DAY.                                        215

      The motion and energy of the action movie returns.

      It’s like Ray Liotta’s final day in Goodfellas; relentless,
      frustrating, pressure of life again now he’s free from his tomb.
      Deeper and deeper he goes, twisting and turning through the scoops
      of sandstone, his rope trailing behind him a hundred feet. We
      follow its progress snaking after him.

      Specks of blood on the canyon walls.


216   INT. TIGHT SLOT. DAY.                                    216

      He stops at the top of a squeeze that drops to the canyon floor.
      He takes a couple of hyper-ventilating breaths and just throws
      himself down it.

      Gets to his feet. Stumbles on. Nothing will stop him. Not even...


217   INT. SQUEEZE. DAY.                                       217

      We see him nudging his shoulders along the squeeze, each
      contraction forward sending waves of pain shuddering through him.
      His teeth are set in a grimace, almost a snarl.


218   INT. CANYON. DAY.                                        218

      The canyon becomes a chute, increasingly steep, deep and dark. But
      at the end, there is a glow of light, pink, red, soft, getting
      brighter by the step. He stumbles forward, the rope whipping
      around the corners. Faster and faster until....




219   EXT. ROCK SHELF. DAY.                                    219

      ....we burst into dazzling midday sun on a rock shelf perched
      dizzyingly high above the canyon floor. It’s a two hundred foot
      sheer drop to the bottom. Vast cliffs face him opposite.

      He drinks in the sun, the space. Stumbles over to the edge.
      Sees...

      Water. A stagnant pool of black water.

      Turns back, suddenly desperate, rabid. Is searching the rock for
      something. Doesn’t take long to find two clean, shiny, metal bolts
      drilled into the rock. Gets down on his knees and kisses them as
      he were the Pope on new soil.

      Teeth biting at the knots in the rope. Sand all over his lips,
      blood on his face from the amputation.

      Every single knot must be untied with his good hand and his teeth.
      Stops, suddenly overwhelmed with thirst and exhaustion. Reaches
      into his pack and pulls out the Camelbak. Empties urine all over
      his head. He is licking and retching all at the same time. Stops.
      Instantly.

      He can hear a noise. We can hear a noise. A shuffling, zipping
      sound. The rope is uncoiling over the edge, running faster and
      faster. There’s only a few feet left.

      He lunges across the ledge and catches it just in time. Lies there
      whimpering.


220   EXT. ROCK SHELF. DAY.                                    220

      Aron inches over the edge. Difficult rappelling with one arm. His
      feet skid sideways.

      A yell of pain and he is spinning down the rope, hurtling out of
      control towards the pool of water. This is the end.


221   EXT. CANYON. POOL. DAY.                                  221

      He hits the pool with a crash.


222   EXT. ROCK SHELF. DAY                                     222

      But he is back at the top of the rappel. Nothing happened. We see
      him control his worst, last fear. Inching slowly, his feet walk
      their way carefully down the rock. His eyes never leave the pool
      of dirty water, and that is our focus too.


223   EXT. POOL. DAY.                                          223

      His feet gently touch the sandy floor, still tied to the rope. He
      staggers to the pool and buries his head in it. Dead leaves,
      insects, just two inches of undrinkable water. But he drinks it,
      bathes his head in it. Drinks again. The sounds coming out of his
      mouth are half cave-man, half ecstasy.

      Kneeling in the water, he pulls out the map. Gets up and staggers
      off. Turns, comes back and scoops up water into his water bottle.
      Drinks another litre with huge gulps of pleasure.




224   EXT. CANYON. DAY.                                        224

      He walks, shedding any weight that might slow him down.
      Carabiners, his harness, the rope, all dropped behind him without
      a thought. Blood is seeping from the stump of his arm onto his
      shirt. Every so often, he stops and drinks deep from the water
      bottle and the Camelbak.


225   EXT. CANYON. DAY.                                        225

      Aron zig-zags the canyon from one stagnant pool to another. He
      finds a smear of dripping water on a vertical cliff and puts his
      lips to it and sucks.


226   EXT. CANYON. DAY.                                        226

      A series of jump cuts as he walks, his progress measured in blood;
      first on his shorts, then spreading and dripping down his leg and
      then dripping onto the sand. A trail of drops behind him.

      At a junction with another canyon entrance he stops, pulls the
      photocopied map out of his pocket, looks woozily around. Staggers
      on.

      We are focussed on his shoes pushing through the sand. He only has
      one sock on and the bare foot is rubbed raw by the sand. He is
      limping badly.


227   INT. HORSESHOE CANYON. DAY.                              227

      Finally, he comes to the Great Gallery. A 330 foot long wall with
      dozens of broad-shouldered figures painted and chipped into the
      rock by strangers 3000 years ago.

      The heat and his condition makes everything shimmer. He stops. He
      salutes them in his own way and then limps on.


228   EXT. HORSESHOE CANYON. DAY.                              228

      Seventy yards on, there are three more alien figures- tiny heads
      and elongated bodies. Cave paintings come alive?

      He tries to shout, but nothing comes out. Another attempt, lost in
      the vastness of the canyon. The figures are disappearing in the
      shimmer.

                          ARON
                Help!

      The figures stop. Turn.

                          ARON (CONT’D)
                Help!

      A terrible pause.

                          ARON (CONT’D)
                Help me! I need help!

      The figures begin to run towards him. We watch his face in close
      up as they come. Tears come, now as the shimmering figures shapes
      themselves into the first real people he has seen for five days.

                           ARON (CONT’D)
                My name is Aron Ralston. I was trapped
                by a boulder on Saturday and I’ve been
                without food or water for five days. I
                cut my arm off this morning. I need
                medical attention. My name is Aron
                Ralston...

      They look at this refugee from a horror movie. He is staring at
      the water bottles hanging from their waist belts. This gives them
      a way into his world. The moment is broken as they hurry to offer
      him water. He pours it down his throat, bypassing the swallow
      mechanism entirely.


229   INT. TV STUDIO. DAY. ERIC MEIJER’S TESTIMONY.            229

      Eric’s English is almost perfect, although accented. His family
      sit around him on comfy chairs in a tv studio.


                          ERIC MEIJER
                We are the Meijers from Holland. At the
                start of the trailhead, we talked to a
                ranger who told about a car that was
                parked in the area already for several
                days and the owner might be missing in
                the canyon. We joked that we would keep
                our eyes completely open. After a hike
                of five point three kilometers to the
                Great Gallery, we returned after taking
                photographs and suddenly heard a noise
                behind us. Monique and I immediately
                realised that this had to be the missing
                person. We didn’t find him, he found us!
                We gave him our water and Oreos.


230   EXT. HORSESHOE CANYON. DAY.                                230

      Back now live as Aron wolfs down the cookies and organises the
      well-meaning but freaked Meijers. Aron is brutally practical.

                          ARON
                Phone. Do you have a phone?

                          ERIC
                Yes, but no signal. You should stop and
                rest.

                          ARON
                No, need to keep moving. Need a
                helicopter. Who can run fastest? You. Go
                fast. Take him.

      Monique runs ahead with Andy, her son.

                          ARON (CONT’D)
                Got more water?

                           ERIC
                No.

      Aron makes a disgusted tutting. Gets up and starts limping forward
      again. Eric follows on behind, flapping ineffectually around him,
      trailing in the wake of this machine for living. After a while, he
      glances behind.

                           ARON
                Keep up.

      Nobody for six days and then people start turning up like London
      buses. Another couple.

                          ARON (CONT’D)
                Water. I need your water.

      Dan hands over his water bottle. Aron drinks and drinks.


                          ARON (CONT’D)
                Cell. Do you have a cell?

                          DAN
                No. I’m Dan. I have some medical
                training.

                          ARON
                Is it okay to drink so much water?

                          DAN.
                Sure, so long as you don’t vomit.

      Aron drinks more and more. He overhears....

                          DAN. (CONT’D)
                Make sure he doesn’t pass out.

                          ARON
                I gotta empty my shoes. Blister. My
                foot’s killing me.

                             DAN.
                Your foot?

      Aron is utterly oblivious to this.




231   INT. TV STUDIO. DAY. ERIC MEIJER’S TESTIMONY.            231

                          ERIC
                He cuts off his arm and his foot is
                killing him?




232   EXT. CANYON. DAY.                                        232

                          ARON
                You’ll have to re-tie the laces.

      As he sits, his head slumps forward. He’s absolutely motionless.
      Eric tries to talk to him, but there’s a pop song in his head and
      he can barely hear him.

                          ERIC
                Aron, are you okay? Stay with us, Aron.

                          DAN
                Jesus, he’s asleep. Aron! Wake up!

      Aron pulls his head up and sees in front of him a vision coming
      from the sky. Whirling and screaming, dust blasting everywhere. A
      helicopter.


233   EXT. HELICOPTER. DAY.                                    233

      Very subjective, woozy camera moves as a strange, slightly formal
      man pops out of the helicopter. He almost looks like he’s part of
      the Matrix. All of this seen from Aron’s befuddled perspective.

                          MAN
                Are you Aron?

                          ARON
                Aron Ralston. Can I get a lift?

      The man smiles at him in a strange way.

                          MAN
                I guess so.


      Aron looks at the beautiful white leather seats before he gets in
      the chopper. Surreal. He touches them with his hands.

                          ARON
                I’m gonna make a terrible mess of your
                seat.

                          PILOT
                Just get in buddy.

      The helicopter sucks upwards into the sky leaving Dan and Eric far
      below.


234   EXT. / INT. HOSPITAL. DAY.                               234

      The helicopter and gurney staff transfer him into the medic room.
      He is surrounded by vertical giants and he lies horizontal for the
      first time in six days.

                          ARON
                Thank you for bringing me back.

                          BURLY MAN
                That’s all your miracle days used up
                kid. You can buy everyone a drink later.

      The Burly Man turns away, his job done.

                             ARON
                Wait.

      The Burly Man turns.

                          ARON (CONT’D)
                Will you look after this for me?


      He puts something into his hand: a small, folded knife. Aron’s
      eyes close.




235   INT. HOSPITAL. DAY.                                      235

      Very soft light, a different place to the emergency room. Through
      diffused light we perceive a figure sitting by the curtains
      reading letters.

                             ARON
                       (dry, barely a whisper)
                Mom.

                             MOM
                Hey...

      She goes over to him.

                          MOM (CONT’D)
                Welcome back, Aron.

      He squints at her. She immediately understands, reaches to the
      table beside him, picks up a pair of glasses and puts them on his
      face.

                          MOM (CONT’D)
                Your spare pair from home. Dad’s on his
                way from New York.

                          ARON
                I’m so sorry.

                          MOM
                Aron Ralston, you ever do that to me
                again and I swear I’ll break both your
                legs.

      He looks down at the clean bandages, the place where his hand
      should be, realises for the first time that a new life starts
      here. Suddenly scared, his eyes fill with tears.

                          ARON
                Oh, Mom, what am I gonna do?

                          MOM
                You’re my son. You’re alive. That’s all
                that matters for now.

      Title:

      1000 HOURS LATER


236   INT. UNDERWATER. DAY.                                    236

      Underwater. A figure dives in, pulling strong breast strokes down
      and towards us. Its Aron, fully recovered after surgery. Eyes
      open, he pulls and pulls down through crystal clear, oxygenated
      water. He pulls again releasing a huge chunk of air into a
      metallic bubble.




237   INT. PRESS CONFERENCE. DAY.                              237

      A room crammed with journalists all baying, shooting off flash
      guns, waving microphones at him. Sandwiched between his Mom and
      Dad behind a table, Aron can’t hear any of it, just his own heart
      beating. He stares with a dazed smile on his face.




238   EXT. POOL. DAY.                                          238

      We can see him underneath us, swimming along the floor of the
      pool, like a diver building lung capacity.




239   INT. WEDDING. DAY.                                       239

      A wedding. Sonja, Aron’s sister and Zach her groom. We are at the
      reception. Hugging, laughing, drinking, toasting. Life in all its
      ordinariness and wonder.

                          ARON’S DAD
                This is a day every Father prays for.
                His beautiful daughter married to a fine
                boy - yes, you’re still a boy, Zach -

      Laughter from the crowd.

                          ARON’S DAD (CONT’D)
                - but today is particularly special for
                Donna and myself. A day we thought might
                never happen. Not only do we welcome a
                new son into our family, but we have our
                son back. Which makes us the luckiest -
                and happiest - parents in the United
                States of America.

      There is applause from the crowd. Aron raises his Margarita glass
      in acknowledgement, though it’s clear he’d rather not be the
      centre of attention.


240   EXT. POOL. DAY.                                             240

      Aron deep under water. Pull and kick. Wanting oxygen now.


241   INT. RECEPTION HALL. SIDE ROOM. DAY.                        241

      The reception is well underway. Sonja pulls Aron out of the main
      room towards a piano beneath the stairs.

                           SONJA
                 Look what I found.

                           SONJA (CONT’D)
                 You promised.

                              ARON
                 Yeah, but-

                           SONJA
                 - the only butt is sitting right here.

      And she plonks him down on the piano stool.

                              SONJA (CONT’D)
                 Move up.

      He scoots along and she sits down next to him.

                           ARON
                 Sonja, this is crazy, I-

                              SONJA
                 - you can.

      She places her hands on the keyboard. He looks at her. Puts his
      hands on the keyboard. Three human fingers and one titanium one.
      She counts them both in with her head.

                              SONJA (CONT’D)
                 And....

      They start. The note C played three times. C, C, C. Tentative.
      They’re really concentrating. C, B, A, B, C, D. The music is
      becoming clear: it’s the piano tune from the film Big- Heart and
      Soul. That simple, melody full of childlike charm.

      E, E, E. They are beginning to flow.

      E, D, C, D, E, F. They almost stumble but recover. On to the high
      notes.

      G, C....

      And onto the finish: A, G, F, E, D, C...with a flourish as Aron
      jumps the octaves with his titanium finger. And Sonja and Aron’s
      faces split into the widest of grins.


                          SONJA (CONT’D)
                Promise kept.

      She kisses his cheek and is away, leaving Aron staring at the
      keyboard.




242   INT. UNDERWATER. DAY.                                    242

      Aron is pushing for the surface, kicking hard, up, up towards the
      sunlight.




243   INT. ARON’S TRUCK. NIGHT.                                243

      Aron driving.


244   EXT. SUBURBAN STREET. NIGHT.                             244

      Aron parks up. Gets out of the truck. We might recognise the
      street.


245   EXT. SUBURBAN STREET. NIGHT.                             245

      We definitely recognise it now. It’s the same street he walked up
      in his head- to Rana’s house.


246   EXT. RANA’S APARTMENT. NIGHT.                            246

      Knocks on the door. Stands back. Everything’s the same as before,
      but different. Different colours, different sizes. The memory
      street and house have become a real street and house.

      The door opens.

                          RANA
                Aron! My God.

      Runs at him and folds him a huge hug. Keeps on hugging until
      there’s barely any breath left in him. And he hugs back. Finally,
      she disengages and wipes the tears from her eyes.

                          RANA (CONT’D)
                You total fucker, Aron Ralston.

      They laugh. She takes his hand and takes him inside.


247   INT. RANA’S APARTMENT. NIGHT.                              247

                          RANA
                My famous Margarita. Coming right up.

      Rana is mixing drinks in the kitchen. From the living room, he
      watches her. She moves beautifully.

      She comes through with the drinks.    Hands him a glass.

                          RANA (CONT’D)
                What are we toasting? Multi-tools?

                          ARON
                The future.

                            RANA
                Why not?

      They chink glasses.

                          ARON
                So, you and Tom broke up?

                          RANA
                Nearly one year ago. Still friends,
                but...


248   EXT. RANA’S APARTMENT. ROOFTOP. LATER.                     248

      They are sitting opposite each other sipping their Margaritas. The
      sofa and deck chairs are still there, and so are the snow-capped
      mountains.

                          ARON
                I’m gonna finish the fourteeners this
                winter or next.

                            RANA
                Solo?

                            ARON
                Yeah.

                            RANA
                Huh.

                          ARON
                I need to do it.

                            RANA
                Sure.

                          ARON
                Before. I couldn’t let anyone in. I know
                that.


                             RANA
                   Didn’t have to be anyone, Aron. Just me.

                             ARON
                   I know.

      Silence.

                             ARON (CONT’D)
                   Rana, there’s something that I haven’t
                   told anyone. When I was in the canyon,
                   before I did it, when I thought I was
                   dead, I was hallucinating and I saw this
                   child, a little boy -

                             RANA
                   Not Jesus please...

                             ARON
                   He looked like my cousin CJ, but way too
                   young ...not him. Somebody else. I knew
                   he was mine- my child- and that this was
                   what lay in front of me. My future.
                   Rana, this little boy, he - he saved me.
                   Do you see? I thought maybe...

      He looks at her. She doesn’t say anything.

                             ARON (CONT’D)
                   But it’s not going to be you, is it?

      She takes his hands in hers, smiles sadly.

                             RANA
                   No, Aron, it’s not.

                             ARON
                   No.

                             RANA
                   Everyone who cares for you, a little bit
                   of them dies each time you go back out
                   there.

      Rana leans over and tenderly kisses his cheek.

      TRIPTYCHS.

      The screen splits into three panels again.


249   INT. UNDERWATER. DAY.                                       249

      He surges up and out of the water, takes a huge breath of
      air. We see he is right next to the edge of the pool.


250   EXT. POOL. DAY.                                          250

      There in front of him on the grass by the pool is the same sofa as
      in the canyon. On it and around it, his friends and family.
      There’s so many of them they fill the screen, all looking at him.

      He looks right back at them and smiles.

      On the panel next to Aron is a close up of the boy he saw in
      the canyon.

      CARD 1:

      “Aron’s premonition came true.”

      “He met his wife, Jessica, three years later.”

      We see what has conjured the smile. The sofa has lost its
      crowds. Now, sitting there, is the real Aron Ralston. Next to
      him sits his wife, Jessica, holding a tiny baby in her arms.

      CARD 2:

      “Their son, Leo, was born in February, 2010.”

      The actor, Aron, smiles at the scene in front of him. The past and
      present greeting the future, fiction greeting fact.

      CARD 3:

      “Aron continues to be a climber and canyoneer”

      Mixed into the split screen, a wintry scene of Aron on a
      mountain ridge struggling through deep snow away from camera.
      The thin rope snakes from us to him.

      The screen fades to black.

      CARD 4.

      “He always leaves a note to say where he has gone”.
