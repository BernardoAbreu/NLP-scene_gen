<L>__{interior frank's penthouse day}
<A>__{a large tv shows chaotic scenes in saigon. the us is pulling out of vietnam. tosca has come to see how frank is recovering, and finds him, agitated, too long in bed even though it's only been a day, changing into a nice shirt, putting on his shoes }
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{"i can guarantee you peace of mind," you said. do i look like a man with peace of mind to you? they shot at my wife. who does that?}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{who was it, which one of your people? i will take that gun away and shove it up their ass.}
<C>__{tosca}
<D>__{i don't know that it was any of them, frank. neither do you.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{then maybe i will kill them all just to make a fuckin pointerior}
<A>__{tosca seems more philosophical about it like bumpy might have been but it wasn't him who was shot at.}
<C>__{tosca}
<D>__{you want to know who it was? i can tell you. it was a junkie. or a rival. or some dumb ass kid trying to make a name for himself. or someone you forgot to pay off. or slighted without realizing it. or someone you put out of business by being too successful.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{success has a lot of enemies. your success is who took a shot at you. how you gonna kill it? by being unsuccessful? you can be successful and have enemies, or unsuccessful and have friends. it's the choice we make.}
