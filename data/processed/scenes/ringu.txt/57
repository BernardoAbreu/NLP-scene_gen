<L>__{interior koujis house guest room night}
<A>__{the lights are all off and asakawa is asleep in her futon. her eyes suddenly fly open as a voice sounding eerily like her deceased niece tomoko calls out to her.}
<C>__{tomoko }
<D>__{auntie?}
<A>__{asakawa looks around the room, gets her bearings. her eyes fall on the futon next to hers.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{yoichi?}
<A>__{there is a body in that futon, but it is full grown, dressed all in black. it is curled into a fetal position and has its head turned away. suddenly, the image from the video of the figure with its face shrouded springs to asakawas mind. just an instant, its pointing visage materializes, and then disappears. it reappears a moment later, pointing more insistently now, and disappears again. asakawa blinks her eyes and realizes that the futon next to hers is empty. yoichi is nowhere to be seen. just then, she hears that high pitched, metallic squeaking from the video. eyes wide with horror, she flings the sliding doors apart and there, seated before the television, is yoichi. he is watching the video. it is already at the very last scene, the shot of the outdoor well. closeup on the screen now, and for just an instant we can see that something is trying to claw its way out of the well. the video cuts off, and the screen fills with static. shrieking, asakawa races over to yoichi, covers his eyes though it is already too late. she scoots over to the vcr, ejects the tape and stares at it uncomprehendingly. she is then at yoichis side again, shaking him roughly.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{yoichi! you brought this with you, didnt you? why?!?}
<C>__{yoichi}
<D>__{tomo chan...}
<A>__{asakawa freezes, her eyes wide.}
<C>__{yoichi}
<D>__{tomo chan told me to watch it.}
