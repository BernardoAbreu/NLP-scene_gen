<L>__{interior plaza hotel suite living room night}
<A>__{smecker and greenly walk into a large sunken living room with high ceilings. there is a huge white shaped pit couch in the center with seven dead bodies draped across it. all the bodies have been turned so they are either seated or on their backs and bright new pennies have been place in their eyes. there is one corpse directly in the middle of the living room, making eight. this victim (the fat man) is overweight and is lying in debris made up of sheet rock and broken wood which spreads thinly for a five foot radius around him. the victims' body positions are in a circle with the fat man as the hub. smecker is instantly engulfed. the regular homicide detectives are on hand with their i.d.s hanging out of their breast pockets. they see smecker and back off. duffy wears an especially loud tie. smecker lights up a smoke. he circles around and sees another body behind the couch, which makes nine. the victim is on his back, with pennies stuck in his eyes.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{how many bodies, greenly?}
<C>__{greenly}
<P>__{(still dejected)}
<D>__{eight.}
<A>__{smecker's eyes widen as he turns to greenly.}
<C>__{greenly}
<P>__{(catching himself)}
<D>__{no! shit! i didn't see that one. nine! nine!}
<A>__{smecker takes a beat. he addresses the detectives.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{while greenly's getting coffee, anybody else want anything?}
<C>__{greenly}
<P>__{(as he walks to the door)}
<D>__{shit! shit!}
<A>__{smecker surveys the scene.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{so duffy, got any theories to go with that... tie.}
<C>__{duffy}
<P>__{(looks down)}
<D>__{these guys were pros. i think they were coming for one target, the fag man, he was the...}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{the what man?}
<C>__{duffy}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{the fat man.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{well, freud was right. so you think they came for the fag man, huh? and what do you base this upon?}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{he was the only one done right. two in the back of the head.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{and the pennies?}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{new hitman wants to leave his mark}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{that's a possibility. y'know you boston cops are perking up. that's two sound theories in one day, neither of which deal with abnormally sized men.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{another possibility is that they were placed there with religious intent.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{yeah. some cultures still put pennies in the eyes of the dead, or silver.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{the greeks. the italians.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{the sicilians.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{what's the symbology there?}
<A>__{smecker tosses the idiot glance to dolly.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{symbology? well, now that duffy has relinquished his king bone head crown i see we have an heir to the throne. i'm sure the word you were looking for was symbolism. what's the symbolism there? let me explain it to you. in greek and roman mythology when you died you would have to pay the toll to charon, the boatman who ferried you across to the gates of judgment. this made sure the dead came to atone for what they did during their lives, detective...}
<A>__{smecker looks at his i.d.}
<C>__{smecker}
<D>__{dollapoppaskalious.}
<A>__{the detectives are impressed.}
<C>__{dolly }
<D>__{holy shit. you're the first one that's ever got that.}
<C>__{smecker}
<P>__{(aside)}
<D>__{yeah, well... i'm an expert in name ology.}
<A>__{the detectives chuckle.}
