<A>__{cabs and limousines tangle outside the west entrance. a huge rotating spotlight is now turned on. elegantly dressed men in dinner jackets and women in gowns rush to get out of the pelting rain, umbrellas jousting.}
<L>__{interior cuthbert's office evening}
<A>__{cuthbert's putting on his tux. he adjusts the cummerbund, humming happily as d'agosta looks on. d'agosta paces, highly agitated and worried.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{i'm telling you, something's wrong. i still haven't heard from pendergast. i think you should call it off.}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{it's too late now. guests are arriving. the mayor's car is pulling up.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{i will go down and speak to him.}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{you haven't got the authority. only pendergast can pull the plug.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{pendergast may be in trouble. don't you understand? he still hasn't come back. it's been over three hours }
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{he'll be back. relax. we're in good shape. your security is air tight. there've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious. there's no reason to call off the opening now.}
