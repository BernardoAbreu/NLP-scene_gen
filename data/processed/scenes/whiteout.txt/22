<L>__{exterior ice field later}
<A>__{the twin otter is in the distant background. carrie, doc and delfy, who has a gear bag slung over his shoulder, weave their way around huge ice boulders skirt small crevasses. mid conversation...}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{... it's always different when they freeze. some curl up. some stretch out. some tear their clothes off. they get delirious. what was that guy's name?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{linger.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{yeah. he's lost in a storm. we can't find him, but we hear him on the radio going on and on about the serengeti heat and his wife, janet. next day, we find him frozen solid, wearing nothing but his bunny boots.}
<A>__{delfy stops. grimaces. drops the gear bag.}
<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{jesus.}
<A>__{the corpse is just ahead a frozen display of death. they all stare at it the body in unnatural angles, the spiderweb of frozen blood. delfy looks nauseous.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{never seen a dead guy?}
<A>__{delfy slowly shakes his head, no. carrie moves up to it. takes a look down the deep crevice four feet away. can't see the bottom. she walks around to get a look at the face. blanches slightly.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{you know him }
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{so do you. think his name's weiss. we wintered over last year with him. played cards a couple of times.}

<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{yeah. geologist, i think.}
<A>__{doc takes a look.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{damn }
<A>__{carrie pulls out a digital camera from a pocket. shoots a couple of pics. doc takes a look up behind them. the ice steepens sharply to a vast plateau, scattered with jagged boulders of ice.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{looks like he fell from up there.}
<A>__{carrie pauses with her camera, looks up doesn't seem as convinced.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{then where's his crampons his gear?}
<A>__{doc looks around she's right.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{maybe down the crevasse?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{yeah, maybe }
<A>__{carrie glances to delfy.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{what's the closest camp?}
<C>__{delfy}
<D>__{brits about eighty miles west.}
<C>__{carrie}
<P>__{(looking at body soto)}
<D>__{what the hell where you doing all the way out here?}
<A>__{doc reaches down and tries to move the body doesn't budge frozen solid into the ice.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{ah christ he's a sticker.}
<A>__{carrie unzips the gear bag. digs out ice two axes.}
