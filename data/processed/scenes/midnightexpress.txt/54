<D>__{get off our tits!}
<A>__{bell turns to go. suddenly a loud crumbling noise and: a fourth stone starts to go but brakes itself. billy, max, bell all framed in a posture of fear not daring to move. second story kogus remains silent. bell looks up the stairs, tiptoes back, indicating they are clear. max and billy. all three of them look: the three a half stone space. easily big enough for them to squeeze through. billy shines a candle in the shaft,}
<B>__{off.}
<A>__{the three look at each other. the same thought. eager eyes. the train whistles by in the night, off.}
<C>__{bell}
<P>__{(sudden)}
<D>__{let's go!}
<A>__{billy looks at his watch, hates to do it. shakes his head.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{no. no time. put 'em back.}
<A>__{max groans to himself.}
