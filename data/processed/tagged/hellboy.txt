<D>__{ragnarok, anung ia anung.}
<A>__{he flexes his fingers and in response the two metal rings swing around the machine's central axis. tchink!!! whirrr!!! steam escapes from the ducts and pipes. an invisible blast of energy forces the falling rain to swerve momentarily away from grigory's body. ilsa signals two nazi scientists standing at a control panel.}
<C>__{ilsa}
<D>__{more power!! don't let the level drop!!}
<A>__{one of them inserts a 20 inch solid gold cylinder into the machine. two openings remain vacant next to it. a blade of light opens in the air! burning symbols slash the air, like living serpents of fire.}

<L>__{exterior cosmic slit from the other side night}
<A>__{the six foot work light tumbles by the massive ogdru jahad: seven egg like monoliths of unholy origin. within their translucent walls, horrible creatures lie slumbering. as the light sweeps by, one of the giants opens a filmy eye, and then another, and another, and another... fleshy tentacles move lazily within their crystalline prison.}

<L>__{exterior abbey ruins altar area night}
<A>__{grigory dangles like a marionette in a new surge of energy. even the skeptical von krupt is in thrall. the nazi scientist reaches for a second gold cylinder. but something else lands next to him: a grenade!!! the explosion blows him to pieces. in a few seconds, the squad of allies storms the area. a hail of bullets cuts down a dozen nazis. the allies overrun the machine gun nest as grenades explode everywhere. von krupt shoots wildly, hitting broom in the leg. but whitman's bullets rip into the old nazi's chest. leaving a trail of blood, broom crawls to a dead g.i. and grabs a grenade from his belt. tchkkk!!! kroenen extends two gleaming blades from twin steel bands on his wrists and takes on an entire group of soldiers, mowing through them with swords spinning like deadly rotors. the steel chops clean through their weapons. broom pulls the pin and throws the grenade at the generator. click clack!! it wedges itself between two moving tie rods. kroenen squeals and retracting his blades lunges after it. the gyrating rails slice through his leather jacket. as his fingers reach the grenade, it explodes!!! kroenen flies through the air, hitting a stone wall, where two long pieces of shrapnel pin him like an insect. another rail plunges fffft!!, like a javelin into the earth right next to matlin.}
<C>__{ilsa}
<D>__{grigory!}
<L>__{exterior abbey ruins altar area night}
<A>__{grigory's face is distorted, pulled like ectoplasmic taffy, his body contorting and breaking. the cosmic portal suddenly implodes! nothing is left but a few burnt rails and the metal glove, empty and smoking. as the allies approach, the fighting rages on. grigory and ilsa are gone. and for now, so is kroenen. embedded in the wall where he was pinned, two bloody rails, nothing more.}
