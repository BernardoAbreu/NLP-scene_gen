<B>__{night}
<A>__{o'banion looks rather amusing in his hunting gear like that priest from "the exorcist" on safari. sound: a howl, fairly loud}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{jesus, that was close. uh, pardon me, rev'runt.}
<C>__{o'banion}
<D>__{come on. be careful.}
<A>__{they move slowly ahead, o'banion still a bit in the lead. the camera follows as the reverend pushes into some knee high brush. sound: a rusty metallic clang, followed by a fleshy chomp. o'banion begins to scream and struggle.}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{rev'runt! what is it?}
<C>__{o'banion }
<D>__{my foot! my foot!}
<A>__{virgil lunges to him and looks down.}
