<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{nick, how we gonna bag this guy without any help? maybe i should work on that girl joyce, she speaks the language.}
<A>__{nick glances over at his partner, smiles. but before he can respond the dull roar of a half dozen motorcycles in the distance breaks the pre dawn stillness. twenty bosozoku (bikers) on their multi cylinder high tech street bombers, creep around the corner and slowly ride toward nick and charlie. we get a better look at them: turbo punk elvis samurai hybrids some wearing a slipper under their headbands, courtesy of their girlfriends; some in leopard skin pants. and tattoos... they head straight for nick and charlie, then, at the last moment, split and float away in slow motion, as if the cops didn't exist. suddenly, the street is empty again. silent except for the sound of the wind beating against paper lanterns, rustling the wind chimes... hold on nick and charlie standing in the middle of the street, realizing just how far away from home they are.}
