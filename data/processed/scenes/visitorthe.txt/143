<L>__{interior walter's building, stairwell later}
<A>__{walter walks quickly up the stairs to the fourth floor. he seems to be moving with a little more pep. as he approaches his door, he hears music emanating from his apartment. it's a piano sonata. the music stops him in his tracks. he listens for a couple of moments. finally he walks inside.}
