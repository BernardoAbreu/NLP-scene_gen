<A>__{christy enters the club and grins. she takes a drag on the cigarette. mary robert grabs the beer from christy's hand, and takes a swig.}

<D>__{bobs}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{experience! right?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{the club is alive with activity; the bar is crowded, couples are making out at small tables, and the dance floor is packed. the atmosphere is a combination of hazy darkness and colored lights; the club should have the feeling of a hot neighborhood party, with people of all ages and races. the music percolates, and christy starts to move to it. she and mary robert find a table in the corner, and signal a nearby waitress.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{a couple of bowls of chili.}
<P>__{(holding up the beer)}
<D>__{and another round of these.}
<A>__{the waitress looks at the two women strangely; the club has never hosted nuns before.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<P>__{(to the waitress, confidentially)}
<D>__{i have to do this. so i can become a nun.}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(to the waitress)}
<D>__{initiation. you understand. later on, we make her wear her underwear on her head.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{page 53}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(to the waitress)}
<D>__{and she wants to be a nun.}
<A>__{the waitress leaves, shaking her head. christy and mary robert watch the action at the club. across the room, mike the bartender stares at the nuns, especially christy; he tries to place her.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{who are all these people?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{this is your neighborhood. your turf. you should get to know 'em.}
<A>__{from across the room, mike the bartender continues to study christy's face. he takes out a copy of vince's fax photo and stares at it. he covers christy's hair in the photo with his hands, creating a wimple. there is no question in his mind; the two are the same. mike has a dangerous look in his eyes as he takes a gun from the drawer and slips it into his pocket beneath his apron. there is a live band on a small stage at one end of the club. they start playing a hot dance number, and the club really begins to cook, as the dance floor fills. christy and mary robert, both still seated, start to move with the music. a very good looking local dude comes over to the nuns table. he is clearly amused at their presence.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{hey, sisters how you doin'?}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(flirting)}
<D>__{better now.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{how come they let you out? out of that convent place?}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{time off. for bad behavior.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{oww! a nun havin' fun! i don't believe it! it's good to have you ladies in this fine establishment. so... anybody on the move?}
<C>__{mary robert}
<P>__{(standing up)}
<D>__{i am.}
<C>__{christy}
<D>__{bob! what're you doing?}
<A>__{mary robert leads the dude out onto the dance floor.}
<C>__{mary robert}
<D>__{i'm getting experience.}
<C>__{christy}
<P>__{(to the dude)}
<D>__{you watch yourself!}
<A>__{christy decides she'd better keep an eye on mary robert; she grabs another dude, and heads for the dance floor. as the music percolates, christy and mary robert dance; christy is very hot, and mary robert picks up on her moves. the club patrons are delighted, and cheer as the nuns start to get down.}
<D>__{club patron #1 do it, sisters! club patron #2 sway and pray!}
<A>__{as the song, and the nuns' exuberant dancing, peak, the club patrons cheer, shouting "hallelujah!" and "amen!"}
