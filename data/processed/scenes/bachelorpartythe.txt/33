<L>__{interior. living room charlie and helen's apartment}
<A>__{helen and julie. a corner lamp in the living room is lit, lending a soft but not too effective light to the room. the two young women are on the couch. helen sits curled at one end, head down listening to julie, who has been talking and probably crying a little since we last saw them forty five minutes ago. julie is seated with her legs stretched out in front of her, her head resting back on the back of the couch. she is talking more freely and easily now, the first hard outburst over with.}

<D>__{... he's a boy, my mike. till the day he dies, he'll never be more than fifteen. perpetual adolescence, that's the curse of the professional man. he spends his whole youth trying to be a doctor, a lawyer, an accountant. then he spends the rest of his life looking for the fun he should have had when he was a boy.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{oh, i know. charlie and i hardly even see each other.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{it's very hard on the wife, helen. these are the years when you should be building your marriage. instead, you grow away from each other. i've seen it happen with my friends. in the end, they have nice homes in new rochelle, and a maid, and their maids are happier than they are. but sometimes it does work. it can be done, helen. encourage charlie to stay with his school because...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{oh, i will, julie ...}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{... he's an ambitious boy ...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{... oh, it's not just he's ambitious ...}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{... and if he doesn't fulfill himself, he'll resent you and your baby the rest of his life.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{oh, i don't want him to quit. he loves accounting, julie. i see him sometimes, sitting over his homework. he's got his ledgers out, and he's adding up columns of figures as long as his arm. and he's chuckling. you'd think he was reading the comics. he has a book there, business law. how he can read it i don't know. but i will be watching television or something, and he'll come over, and he'll start telling me about some fine legal pointerior i don't know what he's talking about, but it's enough for me to see how excited it makes him. he loves it, julie. you can't take something like that away from him. it's just it's just i feel we're not really close any more. i mean, he comes home from school, lots of times i'm asleep already. and, when i do see him, he seems all involved with himself. he looks at me sometimes as if i were a stranger to him, and i feel sometimes i am. i'm afraid of that, julie.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{then get rid of the baby.}
<A>__{it is said simply, inevitably, even innocently. it brings only a frown to helen's face and a short silence.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{if i had it to do again, believe me, that's what i would do.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(slowly becoming aware}
<D>__{of the depth of what}
<P>__{they are talking about)}
<D>__{you don't mean that, julie.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{yes, i do. my children are the only things in my life now, but i would rather have a husband.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i wouldn't even think about it.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{that's what i said, too.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{let's not even think about it. if i even mentioned it, he'd he'd hit me, i think.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{all right.}
<A>__{now, the thick, tense silence falls between them. they both occupy themselves with their own troubled thoughts.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i want this baby, julie. i've wanted this baby for a long time. it's the only thing i've ever asked of charlie. if i mentioned that to him i don't know what he'd do.}
<A>__{again, they sink into silence. then in the thick silence, the telephone rings. the two young women are so deep within their thoughts that neither of them moves. it rings again, and helen slides off the couch and goes to the phone. it rings again. she picks it up.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{hello.... hello, charlie, where are you calling from? ... you sound like you're having a nice time.... oh, you're having a ball, huh? ... well, what time do you think you'll be coming home?}
