<A>__{madison's blurry pov of someone entering lindenmeyer's station in letac. you can't tell who it is, at first. but you can see the person is male. and wearing lindenmeyer's pants. you now see the person is sid 6.7. inside lindenmeyer's station madison forces herself into consciousness. or as close to it as she can get. her expression is one of complete and utter terror.}

<D>__{dr. carter i've been hoping we'd get a moment together...}
<A>__{mustering her strength, she manages to crawl behind several of the computers which make up the simulator. sid 6.7 advances calmly toward her.}
<C>__{sid 6.7 }
<D>__{you know so much about me, i was hoping to learn a little bit about you. you see, i'm doing research, too...}
<A>__{he looks behind the computers where you last saw madison. she is no longer there. sid 6.7 begins searching for her. he passes a virtual reality monitor on which parker can be seen clinging for life.}

<D>__{hang in there, parker.}
<A>__{on the monitor, parker looks all around him, trying to determine the voice's origin. madison crawls out of lindenmeyer's station. sid 6.7 just catches sight of her, and goes after her.}
<B>__{inside letac}
<A>__{madison crawls into a darkened engineer's station and hides. she is still very dizzy. and trying to keep the sound of her breathing to a minimum. sid 6.7 enters quietly. a hunter on the prowl. moving very slowly. then lunging very swiftly. he continues the hunt. if madison is discovered, she doesn't have a prayer. her heart pounds. her forehead perspires. sid 6.7 is getting closer. sid 6.7 checks inside closets. cabinets. anywhere large enough for a human being to fit. he is practically standing over her. looking. listening.}

<D>__{how does it feel to know you're going to die? what are you thinking about?}
<A>__{lights in the building suddenly come on. several engineers can be heard entering. it's 8 am the start of a new day. the facility is quickly becoming populated. after giving one last look around, sid 6.7 reluctantly gives up the hunt, and exits. madison does not move until she is certain sid 6.7 has left the building.}

<D>__{somebody help!}
<A>__{madison scrambles out of her hiding place.}
