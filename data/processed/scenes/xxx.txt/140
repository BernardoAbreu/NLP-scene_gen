<L>__{exterior the river day}
<A>__{yorgi is motoring away, smiling, when he glances back and sees xander and petra take off after ahab. he pounds on his steering wheel and turns around. his bigger boat closes on them and he reloads his weapons. xander drives while petra checks her controller.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{it's running three meters down. twenty knots.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{it has to surface to release the nerve agent, right?}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{by then it's too late! the only way to safely dispose of the nerve agent is in deep water! the chemicals will break down and dissipate!}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{use your grenades! maybe we can blow it up underwater!}
<A>__{they're heading into downtown prague now, the riverbank getting more and more populated. yorgi is closing fast. down below them petra can see the white streak of ahab beneath the water.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{there it is! hold it steady!}
<A>__{petra pulls the pin on a grenade. she tosses it out in front of ahab. whoomph! a jet of water goes up, but too far behind. she pulls another pin and is ready to throw when yorgi's boat pulls up alongside. yorgi aims and fires and the bullet grazes petra's arm.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{petra!}
<A>__{she loses her grip and the grenade bounces down into the engine compartment. xander grabs petra and jumps. together they land in yorgi's boat. the grenade explodes and their boat slams into a bridge support and shatters. they are in the heart of the old city now. we see piazza's full of tourists, markets packed with locals, children playing in front of cathedrals. and on the river yorgi and xander battle it out while petra steers the boat.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{xander! it's coming up!}
<A>__{xander glances down, sees ahab nearing the surface. yorgi clobbers him and xander falls to the edge of the boat. petra tries to help, but yorgi slugs her in her wounded arm. xander can see ahab just a few inches under as yorgi grabs him from behind in a chokehold.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{this is going to be exciting, buddy! front row seats to the apocalypse! come on, sing with me!}
<P>__{(singing madly)}
<D>__{"i am an antichrist i am an anarchist i... wan na be... anarchy!"}
<A>__{xander elbow's yorgi's gut and breaks the chokehold. he flips him and they both topple overboard. they land on ahab and both grab on. they punch and pummel each other while desperately hanging on to the speeding torpedo. it surfaces as it approaches the magnificent st. charles bridge. on the bridge is a chaos of cops, firemen and crowds of people. they are desperately trying to herd people away from the river. xander pounds yorgi's face and dunks him underwater. yorgi slips and falls back to the tail section, dragging along in the torpedo's wake. ahab starts making noise and it's payload doors swing open. inside xander can see the row of glass cannister containing silent night. the first one rises up into firing position.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{no you don't.}
<A>__{he pries the first rocket off it's launcher. the thing is beeping menacingly. in slo motion xander blinks at the liquid death in his hands. he looks over at petra. she's shouting at him, but he doesn't hear a thing but his own heartbeat. he looks the other direction, to the mass of people on the bridge above him. total strangers... the fate of the whole world is in the hands of a former nihilist. through the crowd, xander sees gibbons break through with his squad of agents. gibbons and xander make eye contact. then yorgi lunges onto his back, trying to pull him into the water. xander hits buttons on the control panel and ahab starts to dive.}
