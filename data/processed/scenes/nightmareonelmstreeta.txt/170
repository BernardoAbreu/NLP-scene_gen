<L>__{exterior elm street nancy's house. night.}
<A>__{nancy crashes suddenly out of the night and into a hedge just outside her own front door, rolling out at its bottom scratched and bloodied. if she were in any normal reality she'd be a mass of broken bones but somehow she's able to claw her way up and look at her watch once more. insert. just a few seconds from zero. she staggers for her house's front door but a moment later krueger crashes down atop her! nancy struggles to her knees just as the man lunges with that godawful handful of blades. but instead of running, she ducks inside the deadly grab and seizes him in a desperate bearhug! the surprise move sends him pitching backwards, her still on him and they fall into the jumble of torn down trellis of roses beneath her window. almost at that very second we hear the jarring, deafening ringing of nancy's alarm clock!}
