<D>__{carlos, i mean carl, started out in the family connection business: real estate in tijuana, fishing boats out of ensenada, hydroponic raspberries. he met up with the obregon brothers of the tijuana cartel who were interested in two things: entering society and using his fishing boats.}

<D>__{so you pay off our customs officials?}
<C>__{ruiz}
<D>__{in mexico law enforcement is an entrepreneurial activity, this is not so true for the usa.}
<P>__{(condescending)}
<D>__{using regression analysis we made a study of the customs lanes at the border and calculated the odds of a search. the odds are not high, and we found variables that reduce the odds. we hire drivers with nothing to lose. then we throw a lot of product at the problem. some get stopped. enough get through. it's not difficult.}
