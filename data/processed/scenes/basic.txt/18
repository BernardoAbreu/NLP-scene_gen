<L>__{interior styles' office morning}
<A>__{styles and an m.p. listening to the coffee room conversation. dunbar's voice, over the speaker:}
<C>__{dunbar }
<D>__{i don't know... i like the army.}
<C>__{hardy }
<D>__{c'mon, ray, everyone hates the army during basic. i will tell you straight, i hated it here.}
<L>__{interior coffee room morning}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{you did basic here?}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{fifteen years ago under sergeant west. piece of work, that guy. i remember, he used to have these two silver .45's with ivory handles and if you weren't quick enough, he'd}
<C>__{hardy }
<D>__{knock you on the head with one of them. he still carry those guns?}
<A>__{he dunbar nods.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{i was also his " knife dummy" .}
<P>__{(to osborne)}
<D>__{see, west used to say he could slit a man from stem to sternum in three seconds. he'd use this length of pipe to demonstrate and if you were the knife dummy, you'd spend all day getting a pipe rammed into your balls if you weren't fast enough to defend yourself. that was a loooong day.}
<A>__{hardy laughs at the memory and turns back to dunbar.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{incidentally, ray, i promised them i'd ask where west and the others are. can we get to them?}
<A>__{he looks to the floor.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{there's no need...}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{they're dead, aren't they?}
<A>__{dunbar looks back up at hardy.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{yeah.}
