<A>__{modern sculptures are spotted around its grounds, including a dramatic one of two huge old cars, head down in the ground, backs protruding into the air. thomas grierson, owner of the gallery, wearing a slick expensive suit, walks with dave leary and bernie, both in casual jackets and ties. grierson is a vain, slightly pedantic and pompous man maybe short always just trying to show he's boss. the three are strolling towards the main entrance. huge sign: 'the grierson gallery' with a silhouette of whistler's mother taken from the painting, as an incorporated logo.}

<D>__{great news.}
<A>__{bernie is smooth and smiley. david leary, vice president, is a very pleasant, but slightly worried man, knocking on 40. too nice for his own good. the three pass a lone mime artist wearing a cheap vac form president clinton face mask. david can't help being just a little nice to him and finds himself left behind. he scampers to catch up. first, catching under the handle then the couch, then four other chairs and finally the deep freeze. no one's going to get in through that door. back in the hall bean pushes the string back inside the letter box and slaps his hand in satisfaction. he locks the door's enormous padlock, looks about carefully to make sure no one's around, and then hides the key under a garden gnome on the floor, standing amongst a row of pathetic pot plants.}
