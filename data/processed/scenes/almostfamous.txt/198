<P>__{(resigned)}
<D>__{i will deal with her.}
<A>__{william whistles again. mom meets them at the door. she looks at her trashed son who has finally come home. for the first time, she hugs anita first, and it's not lost on anita. it's a clumsy neck hug, neither wanting to commit. the kid passes to his mother's left, with suitcase, intentionally nudging her into his sister. anita takes this as an aggressive act of love, and hugs her mother back. tears stream down mom's face. their cheeks touch. mom pulls away, and sees her own tears on anita's face. thinking that she's also crying, she grabs a tissue for them both.}
