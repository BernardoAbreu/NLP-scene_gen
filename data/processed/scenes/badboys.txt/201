<C>__{sanchez}
<D>__{he says he wants his lawyer.}
<C>__{ruiz}

<P>__{(prods the guy)}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{henchman}
<D>__{okay. all i know is his name. foo shay, i think. got this heavy french accent. the word was he offs drug dealers. and there was quick cash for whoever had the balls enough to hook up with him. i swear, man, watchin' your house was my first gig for the guy.}
<A>__{burnett stands over the henchman and lifts his defeated chin to face him. burnett has it in him to give the guy one more hard whack for good measure, but that bruised face proves punishment enough.}

<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{yeah, but julie told me his ship comes in on friday? you wanna tell me who can cut a hundred mil worth a dope in five days? you'd need whole lotta time cards to make that kinda date.}

<C>__{howard}
<D>__{we're in the shit, boys. and there ain't gonna be any more time cards for this unit unless somebody pulls a miracle out of their ass.}
