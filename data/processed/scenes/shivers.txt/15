<L>__{interior women's sauna afternoon}
<A>__{janine sits in the middle of a bench, towel around her head and middle. next to her sits betts, who is in her early forties, attractive in a tough kind of way, and wears her hair short for efficiency's sake. in her relationship with janine she plays the role of tough, worldly older sister. she has the poise and confidence of a woman who has created her own success and position in life, a marked contrast to the neurotic vivacity of janine, who is ten years her junior and has never known independence. they are both watched by the only other occupant of the sauna, benda sviben, now a full fledged resident of starliner towers. she is huddled in a corner, very shy and looking particularly thin, mousy, and ineffectual in the presence of the other two full bodied women. betts is in the middle of giving janine advice about tudor's disease.}
<C>__{betts}
<D>__{...probably nothing at all. it's probably just a bunch of, i don't know, fatty cysts. you can have them removed in a doctor's office. has nick seen a doctor?}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{he hates doctors. doctors and lawyers. he never goes to doctors.}
<C>__{betts}
<D>__{well, look. how's this? you go on down to the clinic and tell that nice dr. st. luc...}
<P>__{(pauses to work it out)}
<D>__{...you tell him that nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. tell him to come when you're sure nick'll be home. and don't tell nick anything. let the two of them fight it out.}
<C>__{janine}
<P>__{(not displeased with the idea)}
<D>__{he'll be really mad.}
<C>__{betts}
<P>__{(with a conspiratorial smile)}
<D>__{so? you'll find out what's wrong and then you'll be able to relax a little bit. let him be the uptight one for a change.}
<A>__{she stretches out full length on the bench, her toes bumping benda's thigh. betts notices benda for the first time.}
<C>__{betts}
<P>__{(to benda)}
<D>__{oops, sorry. hi. haven't seen you here before, have i?}
<A>__{benda draws her towel around her, wide eyed, completely intimidated by betts. she manages a nervous smile.}
