<A>__{the boys are doing their half time stand up.}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{that's the end of the first half and not surprisingly, it was all dallas. the cowboys had over two hundred yards offensively versus washington's frankly pathetic thirty eight yards. that's total offense. falco got close to scoring on the last play of the half but he appeared to have slipped. by the way, running back roland lamont was hurt on that play and word is he's on his way to the hospital.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{al, the battle is being fought and won in the trenches. you can't expect a bunch of pick up players to stand up to a professional pass rush like the cowboys.}
<C>__{boomer}
<D>__{there's still a whole half left, dan. and remember, falco is proving to be a second half quarterback.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{you got to be kidding.}
<C>__{boomer}
<D>__{those big, fat boys in the trenches get awful tired. you ought to know that, dan.}
<A>__{no laughter.}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{okay, let's join chris berman with our half time show. chris?}
<A>__{after a beat we hear:}
<C>__{director }
<D>__{clear!}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{what's wrong with you guys?!}
<C>__{boomer}
<D>__{he started it.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i did not! you called me fat!}
<C>__{boomer}
<D>__{i did not! but you are!}
<A>__{dan reaches across al and grabs boomer by the throat.}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{stop it!}
<A>__{the three of them start wrestling in the booth.}
