<L>__{interior sharon's apartment night}
<A>__{she is on the floor using an exercise rig, sliding into crunches, pushing herself, sweating, alone. we begin drifting to the rain spattered window as night sounds filter in, horns, someone shouting, a car moving by with thunderous bass music that pulses the very air and rattles the loose glass of her window.}
<L>__{exterior neighborhood streets night}
<A>__{catch lambert is walking the wet streets, head down in the rain. far away we hear that car with a bass blasting}
<B>__{radio.}
<A>__{in the glow of a street lamp, catch sees a bright colored object in the gutter. he picks it up out of the gurgling rain water. it is a small toy, a discarded superhero. he puts it in his pocket, walks on. now the car, the prowling, music blasting, bass thundering car turns a corner and begins rollling along slowly beside catch. he glances over, walking on. there are four tough looking men in the car, looking for trouble. the music is deafening. catch glances again, walks on. their eyes follow him like gun barrels. he stops and walks out on the street, moving toward the car, shouting over the music.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{hey! you want to turn that volume down? what's your point?}
<A>__{the men, incredulous, stop the car and snap off the music in order to make sure they're hearing right. they stare death at catch.}
<C>__{driver }
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{what's the point of blasting your music through the whole zip code? don't you realize there are kids trying to sleep in these apartments old people, sick people?}
<A>__{they can hardly believe this.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{you better watch your mouth, asshole.}
<A>__{catch meets the man's look with his own unflinching, haunted eyes.}
<C>__{catch}
<D>__{why? what're you gonna do? kill me?}
<A>__{catch's look is not a macho challenge. it's something else beyond that, a man somehow without limits. one of the riders in the backseat taps the driver's shoulder.}
<D>__{man #2 guy's nuts. let's go.}
<A>__{the driver, never breaking his death stare, snaps on the deafening music and then slowly rolls on, still glaring at catch. catch stands in the rain, watching them go.}
