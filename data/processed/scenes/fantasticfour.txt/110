<D>__{not too much, but i will say that it's all weather and no leather. kind of armani meets astronaut.}
<A>__{ben, sue, and reed stare at the wall sized tv. mouths agape.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{he didn't.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{oh, he did.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{what did he do to the uniform?!}
<A>__{she turns to reed, who gives a sheepish shrug, and peels back his labcoat revealing a "4" stitched onto his chest too.}

<D>__{he talked me into it.}
<P>__{x games reporter (on tv)}
