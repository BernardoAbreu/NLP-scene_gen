<A>__{as the overhead lights briefly flicker, then resume normal operation. sean stands opposite the navigational chart, ping ponging between it and the ship's computers as miss van deusen paces nervously.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{what was that??}
<C>__{sean}
<P>__{(very worried)}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<P>__{(trying not to panic)}
<D>__{what happens if we don't get control of the ship, sean? i want you to tell me the truth.}
<C>__{sean}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we could hit a reef, collide with another ship...we could be out here for weeks before anybody spotted us.}
<A>__{they are suddenly jolted with a door slam as mcculloch storms onto the bridge.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{did you find rennie?}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{she's locked safe in her room, no thanks to either of you.}
<P>__{(like sean isn't even in the room)}
<D>__{has he brought it back on course yet?}
<A>__{sean doesn't look at him, still trying to assimilate the wall of components.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{he's doing the best he can, charles.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{he's the son of the captain, for chrissakes. you'd think he'd be able to operate this thing!}
<A>__{sean closes his eyes, trying to keep from losing his mind and temper. a fierce wave slaps the windows in front of sean's face, motivating him to get his shit together. he checks the omega and loran.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{well?}
<A>__{sean doesn't answer, moving to the seat behind the helm. his father's seat. sean takes the chair, adjusting the wheel, watching the compass. he studies a series of buttons on the console. close up wall of buttons we pan across them, stopping on one labeled "fire alarm do not break except in case of emergency." camera continues around to find we are in the power room, not on the bridge. our vision suddenly lands on jason, staring at the alarm button, considering. he glances back over his shoulder. jason's point of view (efx) wayne's body is now on fire...and the blaze is spreading}
<B>__{through the room.}
