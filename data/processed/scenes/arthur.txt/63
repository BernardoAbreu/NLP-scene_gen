<L>__{interior naomi's apartment. day}
<A>__{the sun is coming up over queens. an ancient dot matrix printer spits out a final page. naomi is at a desk with a pile of finished manuscripts and envelopes to various publishers. one is to `rainbow press'.}
<L>__{exterior manhattan day}
<A>__{naomi's pointing at the chrysler building for a particularly grumpy bunch of tourists of all types and ages.}

<C>__{rude male tourist}
<D>__{hey. i got a question.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{please, interrupt. hell, who wants to come home with me and butt in with questions while i'm watching letterman? `yo. how tall is dave?'}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{sorry, sir. late night, no sleep, long day. what's your question?}
<A>__{the opening bars of a familiar song start up somewhere, filling the street. suddenly, some of the members of her tour group start lip syncing to phil collins.}
<C>__{rude male tourist}
<D>__{how can i just let you walk away, just let you leave without a trace?}
<C>__{female tourist}
<D>__{when i stand here taking every breath with you, ooh...}
<C>__{male tourist 2}
<D>__{you're the only one who really knew me at all.}
<A>__{a van with speakers on the top is parked nearby, pumping out the music.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{what is going on?}
<C>__{old female tourist}
<D>__{how can you just walk away from me, when all i can do is watch you leave?}
<C>__{teenage boy tourist}
<D>__{'cause we've shared the laughter and the pain...}
<C>__{newsstand guy}
<D>__{and even shared the tears.}
<A>__{a yellow cab goes by, the driver lip syncing out the window.}
<C>__{newsstand guy }
<D>__{you're the only one who really knew me at all.}
<A>__{the song hits a hard club mix. arthur bursts from the back of the van in a frog outfit! the `tourists' launch into a well rehearsed dance.}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(lip syncing too)}
<D>__{so take a look at me now, 'cause there's just an empty space. and there's nothing left here to remind me, just the memory of your face.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{take a look at me now, `cause there's just an empty space, and you coming back to me is against all odds and that's what i've got to face...just take a look at me now.}
<A>__{the song builds to a dance crescendo. a magical moment. the crowd watches. how can she say no?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{sorry to be a wet blanket, folks. he's getting married. but i guess he didn't choreograph that bit for you.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{but..but this took ages to rehearse. i had the frog outfit specially made. these aren't actual tourists.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{i gathered that, arthur. are you capable of doing anything without it being a grand gesture?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{it's like hobson said. you're not like other men. if you were normal, if the money and the booze didn't cloud everything, you'd deal with the fact that you're engaged, rather than just looking for ways to win me back. but it was a lovely routine, really. fantastic outfit.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i just wanted to see you.}
<A>__{he takes out his flask and has a swig.}
<C>__{naomi}
<P>__{(sympathetic)}
<D>__{you need to see someone, arthur. seriously.}
