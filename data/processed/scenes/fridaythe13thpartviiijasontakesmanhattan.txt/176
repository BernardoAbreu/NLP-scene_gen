<A>__{as rennie, sean and the dog run straight towards us, jason swiftly catching up. fast track with them over to a deserted, rain slicked subway entrance.}

<A>__{sean, rennie and toby sail down the escalators past a few scattered commuters. again, jason appears, looming tall at the top. he starts down the "up" escalator. jason's point of view (icy.) as an elderly couple rises toward us. their reactions grow more bleak the closer we get, finally registering terror as we plow right through them. angle subway turnstiles (icy.) sean and rennie hop over a metal turnstile, toby crawling under it. a ticket taker leans out his window, shouting at them.}
<C>__{ticket taker}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{the teenagers are soon forgotten as jason smashes through the turnstile like the terminator, tearing the aluminum wheel right off its base. the ticket taker reacts speechlessly, deciding not to press his luck.}
