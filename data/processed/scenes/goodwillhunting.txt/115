<A>__{will starts to clarify his question.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{no, that's okay. it's an important question. 'cause you'll have your bad times, which wake you up to the good stuff you weren't paying attention to. and you can fail, as long as you're trying hard. but there's nothing worse than regret.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you don't regret meetin' your wife?}

<C>__{sean}
<D>__{october 21, 1975. game six of the world series. biggest game in red sox history, me and my friends slept out on the sidewalk all night to get tickets. we were sitting in a bar waiting for the game to start and in walks this girl. what a game that was. tie game in the bottom of the tenth inning, in steps carlton fisk, hit a long fly ball down the left field line. thirty five thousand fans on their feet, screamin' at the ball to stay fair. fisk is runnin' up the baseline, wavin' at the ball like a madman. it hits the foul pole, home run. thirty five thousand people went crazy. and i wasn't one of them.}
<C>__{will}
