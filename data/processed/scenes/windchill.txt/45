<L>__{exterior route 606 roadside night}
<A>__{she gets out of the car, clutching the scissors in both hands like a dagger. she stands behind the protection of the open car door and calls out to the stranger moving down the middle of the snowy road a dozen yards ahead. there's a weird humming noise in the air she can't place.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{no reaction from the stranger.}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{hello? do you live around here?}
<A>__{again, nothing. maybe he's deaf? she moves out from behind the safety of the car door and starts after the stranger, keeping her distance as she calls:}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{we had an accident. my friend went for help. he'll be back any second.}
<A>__{the stranger's dapper suit is more than dishevelled. it's soaking wet, caked in motor oil or some other dark slime.}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{kinda crappy night for a walk, don't you think?}
<A>__{and there's something definitely "off about his shuffling. it's like he's crippled, or injured. in fact he seems to be crying. (or is it moaning?)}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{hey, wait!}
<A>__{but the stranger just keeps shuffling toward the shoulder of the road, headed in the direction of the dark stand of trees beyond. soon he moves beyond the reach of the headlights and disappears into the gloom.}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{what the hell !?}
<A>__{spooked, she begins to back toward the stranded oldsmobile. backs into }
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{she screams.}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{jesus! calm down. it's just me.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{stay away from me!}
<A>__{she brandishes the scissors. he puts up two hands defensively.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{whoa! take it easy. what's wrong?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{you! everything! the guy }
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{what guy?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i don't know, it was weird. i saw some guy walking down the road.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{where did he go?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i don't know. into the woods.}
<A>__{her eyes keep cutting back and forth between him and the woods where the stranger disappeared, as if not sure which is the greater threat.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{look. it's freezing out here. let's just get in the car and you can tell me what happened...}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(paranoid)}
<D>__{what are you doing back so soon? what about hiking to the gas station?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{it was closed. i was going to leave a note, but i didn't... you know. have anything to write with.}
<A>__{she clutches the scissors tighter, not believing a word.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{but those places are supposed to stay open 24 7! why wasn't it open?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{how the hell should i know?! independent operator. look, can we continue this conversation in the car, `cause i'm freezing my balls off standing out here.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(shrieks)}
<D>__{i'm not getting into the car with you, you psycho!!!}
<A>__{he closes his eyes and shakes his head, beyond frustrated.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{fine. whatever. i'm getting in. you're welcome to join me.}
<A>__{he turns and trudges back to the oldsmobile, climbs in, and pulls the door shut after him. leaving her there in the snowy road, clutching the scissors, her teeth chattering. she stands there, shivering, looking very small and alone. hold on her as she weighs her options: stay out here and freeze. or risk seeking shelter with a stalker. not much of a choice.}
