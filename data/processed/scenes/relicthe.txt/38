<L>__{interior gem room day}
<A>__{margo, dr. frock and greg kawakita enter. the room is full of spectacular displays of gemstones of every type. greg drapes himself over a grey sofa. margo leans on a giant geode.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{that cuthbert. what a piece of work. someone's dead and all he cares about is his superstition exhibit.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{cuthbert's counting on the exhibition's success. the museum is in debt. contributions and public funding have dried up. admissions no longer cover overhead. the last big infusion of cash we had was the king tut exhibit. cuthbert was hired to get us out of the red. if the superstition exhibit isn't lucrative, he'll have to start auctioning off some of these gems.}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{with all this bad publicity, it's no wonder he looks like that.}
<A>__{they glance over and see cuthbert in the corner. he appears ill, is compulsively fingering his watch chain from which hangs a rabbit's foot. frock goes over to speak to him, followed by margo and greg.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{ian. are you okay?}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{beauregard. i can't believe it. i may have been the last one to see him alive. he was with me just yesterday, when i got out the statue of mbwun.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{mbwun.}
<C>__{kawakita}
<P>__{(sensing more gossip)}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{margo frowns, suddenly uneasy. she and dr. frock exchange a look.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{warrior deity of the kothoga, an extinct south american tribe. dr. john whittlesley led an expedition that found the only known representation of mbwun. the statue is said to carry a curse.}
<P>__{(she looks away, quiet)}
<D>__{every member of whittlesley's expedition died.}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{i got the relic out yesterday to put on display. beauregard was there. the crates had been broken into and the contents were strewn about. but nothing was missing. it was downright weird. we joked that it was the curse of mbwun. i'm not laughing now.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{come, ian. we all know you're superstitious. but you're among scientists here. we deal in facts. that statue had nothing to do with what happened to beauregard.}
<C>__{cuthbert}
<D>__{all i know is, everyone who has come in contact with that relic, is dead.}
