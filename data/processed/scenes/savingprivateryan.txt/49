<L>__{exterior clearing day}
<A>__{the men are all in their private worlds, thinking of wade. no talk. miller and sarge walk back into the clearing. miller barks at the men.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{up. we're moving out.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{i thought you said we had an hour, sir?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{well now i'm saying we're moving out. get off your ass.}
<A>__{the men get up. jackson is a bit slow.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{what the hell's the matter with you, jackson?}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{sir, i ain't feeling so chipper on account of wade.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{who's wade?}
<A>__{no one responds.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i said, who the hell is wade?}
<A>__{the men exchange looks. jackson speaks for them.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{sir, i understand what you're doin', but i respectfully request permission to grieve in my own manner.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{you'll grieve the way i tell you to goddamned grieve. there is no wade, there was one, but he died a long time ago, he's been dead for so long you can hardly remember his name, you understand?}
<C>__{jackson}

<C>__{miller}
<D>__{good, now get your goddamned gear.}
<A>__{the men pick up their equipment and prepare to move out. sarge and miller exchange a silent look. miller shakes his head to himself, amazed that the men still allow this shit to work. he knows they have no choice.}
