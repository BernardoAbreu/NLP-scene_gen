<L>__{interior gymnasium night}
<B>__{a whistle fades up.}
<A>__{toby's basketball game against the van horn team is starting. alone among all the other players, toby wears his street shoes. heavy squarish brogans, they clomp, and thud as toby runs up and down the court. the leather soles slip like skates on the highly polished floor, and toby falls repeatedly. at first the crowd is silent, collectively embarrassed at the boy wearing these strange shoes. then toby takes a particularly hard fall, and somebody laughs. the crowd in general takes it up, and soon there is general laughter whenever toby's shoes squeal particularly loudly, or whenever the shoes trip him up or cause another boy to stumble. soon one woman's high pitched laugh dominates the gymnasium. the laugh is hideous, shrill and mindless, like some ringer planted in the audience of a situation comedy. toby sees norma necking with some guy and is horrified. toby slips and slides, falls and rises. all the while his expression is hard as stone: he will get through this or die. and, like a mantra, he mutters one phrase over and over: "gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out." finally he makes a basket. one voice from the audience yells out "okay, kid way to go!" and then two or three people applaud. instants later, toby catches a rebound and makes another basket. the fickle crowd decides to love an underdog and applauds heartily for the boy in the funny shoes. but toby's expression never changes.}
