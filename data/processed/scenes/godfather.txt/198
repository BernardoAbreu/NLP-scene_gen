<L>__{int day: church (1955)}
<A>__{inside the church, kay watches as mama blesses herself from the holy water.}
<C>__{mama}
<D>__{you can.}
<A>__{tentatively, kay dips her fingers into the water, and blesses herself. then she follows mama down the aisle, in awe at the high ceiling, the art, the windows, and finally the altar. mama stops by the impressive tiers of candles. there is a large coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting candles. mama fumbles in her purse for change; kay gives her some. mama drops the coins in the box, one by one; then takes the taper, and in a pattern known only to her, and with great dignity, she closes her eyes, says a prayer, and then lights twenty candles. she finishes, and bows her head.}
