<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior park norfolk, va day}
<A>__{it is little league day. adorable kids are dressed up in their uniforms ready to play the next level of baseball. they have graduated from t ball to coach pitch, in which the coach pitches the ball for the kids. there are hot dogs and lounge chairs, family dogs and... fathers. the mothers are there as well, as are brothers and sisters, but primarily it is the fathers trying to fulfill their own dreams of sports glory through their kids. angle on ramirez and joey ramirez has his arm around joey, giving him his last bit of fatherly advice.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{okay... remember, what do we do?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{keep my eye on the ball.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{and who's the guy who wins?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{whoever has fun, wins.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{right! so you go out there and have fun.}
<A>__{he gives joey "five" and joey runs out to join his team at their dugout. ramirez starts walking about toward maura and the baby. as he does, he crosses next to another father, frank, who is with his son tyler. frank is about six foot four and to say that he is competitive would be the understatement of the year. he is haranguing his kid as if this were the deciding game of the world series. he is on one knee so we don't see just how big he is.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i don't want so see you out there dickin' around today, you understand?}
<A>__{tyler looks at his shoes. he is cowed and embarrassed.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you're gonna be focused and aggressive and you're gonna play to win. got it?}
<A>__{tyler is still staring at his toes.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{hey, you think i'm talking just to hear myself talk? look at me when i'm talking to you!}
<A>__{frank suddenly smacks him in the face. annibal stops in front of the two of them.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{hey pal, lighten up, what do you say? it's just a game?}
<A>__{frank looks at ramirez and stands to his full six foot four.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{i said lighten up. it's just a game and he's just a kid.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{he's my kid.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{great. so why don't we let our kids have a good time. come on, i will buy you a beer.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i don't need you to buy me a fuckin' beer, you piece of shit. and you stick your face in my business again and i will beat the living fuck out of you. what do you say to that?}
<A>__{angle on ramirez there isn't a trace of ramirez here at all. it is pure carlos.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what are you smilin' at, asshole?}
<C>__{ramirez}
<P>__{(very quiet)}
<D>__{a dead man...}
<A>__{but before ramirez can move, we hear:}
<C>__{maura }
<D>__{annibal... please!}
<A>__{ramirez turns. maura is there beside him.}
<C>__{maura}
<D>__{annibal please. let's go sit down.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{good idea, annabelle. your ol' lady just saved your ass.}
<C>__{maura}
<D>__{annibal... please... please...}
<A>__{maura tugs at ramirez's arm and frank smirks. ramirez cages the monster inside and turns with maura. as he turns, frank turns to tyler as if he cannot believe the boy is still there.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what are you doin' standing here?! you're supposed to be over there with your team! now move!}
<A>__{the boy hesitates. frank rears back his arm to hit him.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i said...}
<A>__{but before frank can complete the sentence and strike his child, ramirez comes flying through the air with a kick planted straight to frank's head. it is sudden and violent and brutal. he comes down and with one side kick, "knee caps" frank, which is to say he hits the top of frank's kneecap and breaks it so that it is down around his shin. frank starts to drop but before he can, ramirez grabs his ears and brings his head down into his own swiftly rising knee. the result is devastating and frank's nose is now all across his face. blood is everywhere and ramirez does it again. now the object is frank's teeth, so that when his head comes off of ramirez's knee, his mouth is a mass of blood as well. in slow motion, ramirez turns and sees his son who stares in horror at what his father has just done. at the same time, maura is up and grabbing onto ramirez. ramirez however is not done. frank is completely defenseless now and ramirez leans him back across his knee, pulls him by the hair exposing his throat like that of a sacrificial lamb about to be slaughtered. this time instead of a knife, it will be a karate chop from ramirez which will crush frank's windpipe and kill him. but before he can deliver the blow, maura grabs his arm. he turns to her, almost about to hit her or throw her off and the two of them are face to face as ramirez looks from her to his son and realizes how deep into the abyss he has plunged.}
