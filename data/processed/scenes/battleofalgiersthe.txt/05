<L>__{5 ali's hiding place. inside.}
<A>__{there isn't enough air in the hiding place. the four are forced to breathe deeply. and in that small space their laborious breaths resound like splashes. ali la pointe has his eyes fixed upon the square patch of wall that seals the hiding place. his eyes are large, black, slanted, his eyelids heavy, somewhat lowered, so that the black of the irises appears even blacker in the shadows, deeper and more sullen. petit omar is with him, a boy of twelve, and mahmoud who is eighteen. there is also hassiba, a kabyle girl, blond, blue eyed, and fair skinned. the hiding place is only five feet high, and hardly holds them. they are sitting or stretched out on the ground, close to one another. the entrance to the hiding place is blocked by the small patch of wall which matches exactly the rest. it is held firm by a bar through an iron ring attached at the center. on the other side of the cell, above them, there is a hole for air. they are tense and do not move. their lips are dry, half open, and their breasts rise and fall in a difficult attempt to breathe.}

<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{ali la pointe ... the house is surrounded. you haven't got a chance. surrender. let the child and the girl come out, then you and the other one. leave your weapons inside. it's useless to try anything. our machine guns are ready to fire you wouldn't have time. do you understand?}
<A>__{ali's face is motionless and hasn't changed its expression.}
<C>__{captain}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{ali, do you hear me? listen! you are the last one. the organization is finished. all your friends are dead or in prison. come out. you'll have a fair trial. come out, surrender.}
<A>__{sound of footsteps, other voices, cheerful, incoherent:}
<C>__{voices paras}
<D>__{why are they breathing so heavily? fear ... air ... they haven't got enough air inside ...}
<A>__{and again the voice of the captain, clear and somewhat distant:}
<C>__{captain}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{make up your mind, ali? do you want us to wall you in, or do you prefer that we blow you to pieces? ... alright. so much the worse for you.}
<A>__{ali's expression is still firm; his stare is dark and sullen.}
