<L>__{interior arthur's apartment day}
<A>__{the liberated lobsters are now living happily at the bottom of the london phone box aquarium. arthur eats lunch alone at a huge table, the biggest diamond ring in the world is beside him. hobson brings a plate of vitamins.}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{ah. the ring your father gave your mother, i recall.}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(feeling its huge weight)}
<D>__{did he knock her out with it, then drive her to the church in the trunk of his bentley?}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{no. your father was a gentleman.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what's gentlemanly about dying before i knew him? that's just rude. did he ever love my mother?}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{they had their days.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{ah well. at least he doesn't have to wake up every day to a woman with a face like saran wrap stretched over a gargoyle.}
<A>__{arthur stares at the ring again.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{what about naomi?}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{arthur. i say this with love:}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{uh oh...}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{even by modern male standards you're a breathtakingly immature little shit. coupled with the kind of money you have access to, that's deadly. susan may not have a four hour stand up routine about the flatiron building, but she's a solid girl who will look after you.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i have you for that.}
<C>__{hobson}
<D>__{not forever.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{yes forever. you're hobson.}
