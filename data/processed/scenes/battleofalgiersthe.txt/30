<L>__{30 rue d'isly. outside. day. june 20, 1956. 8:05 a.m.}
<A>__{there is a french guard, no more than thirty years old. he has a blond mustache, his beard recently shaved. there are few people in the street. the guard walks slowly, glancing in the shop windows from time to time to admire his reflection. he stops, adjusts his cap, and smiles. an algerian appears beside him; he is also young. the guard pretends to be interested in the photographic equipment which is on display, then moves on. the algerian's arm springs forward and returns quickly to its place. he plunges the knife into the guard's neck. the guard opens his mouth wide to shout, but he cannot. the blood gurgles in his gashed throat. none of the few passersby has seen what happened. the guard falls flat on his face. someone sees him and screams. the algerian hurls himself on top of the soldier, opens his holster, takes his pistol, then gets up pulling the gun with him. the gun is fastened by a leather cord. the cord gets tangled in the gashed neck of the guard. the algerian pulls in vain. he panics. he looks about him with terrified eyes. people approach hurriedly. they are shouting. the algerian pulls the cord a second time, desperately. he regains his control, picks up the knife which is lying on the ground, and cuts the leather cord, thus freeing the pistol. the others have almost reached him and he is surrounded, but he manages to dodge them, and escapes.}
