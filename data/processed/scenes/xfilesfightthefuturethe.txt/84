<A>__{scully enters the space where she and mulder found the fireman's body. trying to quietly click the door shut. standing now near the door, tense, listening. when the chirping of her cell phone breaks the tense silence. she pats frantically at her coat, trying to get it answered before it rings again. unsuccessfully. finally getting a hold of it and hitting the send button. scully sits breathing heavy, nervous breaths waiting for the young naval guard to come running in.}
