<L>__{interior stage}
<A>__{an actress stands in front of what looks to be an old woman in a shawl who's back is to the "audience".}
<C>__{actress 1}
<P>__{(over the top)}
<D>__{oh, grandmama! it's me, anastasia! i've waited so long to see you!}
<A>__{the actress then lumbers over to the old woman, with a gait like john wayne.}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{to see the "old woman" is vladimir, with a shawl over his head. he looks older, of course, but with the same dapper mustache. he rolls his eyes.}
<C>__{vladimir}
<P>__{(out to audience)}
<D>__{dmitri! i can not work with her!}
<C>__{vladimir }
<P>__{(to actress)}
<D>__{may i remind you that you are supposed to be princess not a lazy lumbering lout!}
<B>__{in the seats}
<A>__{is dmitri. now 20 and darkly handsome. his hair still falling in his eyes as he flips it off his forehead.}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{vladimir, calm down!}
<A>__{vladimir walks off the stage and toward dmitri.}
<C>__{vladimir}
<D>__{this, my friend, as an exercise in futility! we shall never find a girl to play the princess anastasia out of this motley crew of commoners!}
<A>__{vladimir dramatically throws one end of his shawl over his shoulder.}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{for a ten million rubles reward we can look a little longer. this is the big one. . . and all i need is the right girl.}
<A>__{"a someone and a someplace" (reprise (dmitri's "i want") dmitri sings a reprise of anya's song, a comic version, in which he expresses the hope that he can find the right girl for his scam. anyone from a peasant to a princess will do, as long as she can fool tatiana. (note: we don't want to give dmitri a whole new song here or we'll be too song heavy in act i. by giving him a short reprise of anya's song, we can effectively align these two characters emotionally.)}
