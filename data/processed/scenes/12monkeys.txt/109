<L>__{interior trunk ford}
<A>__{total blackness! the sound of keys in the lock. then, the trunk swings open and cole stands in the moonlight, looking down railly is in the trunk, tears of rage and frustration in her eyes.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{you bastard! you total bastard!}
<L>__{exterior ford}
<A>__{cole backs away, as railly scrambles out of the trunk, swinging. he slips, falls, and she starts kicking him as she rants hysterically.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{i could have died in there. if something had happened to you i would have died.}
<A>__{cole is lying on the ground, looking up, his lip caked with blood.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i...i...i'm really sorry.}
<A>__{noticing his cuts and torn clothes, she stops kicking him.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{what have you done? did you...kill someone?}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(getting to his feet)}
<D>__{no! i...don't think so. i stole a car and they chased me. i hit a tree.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{see you can drive after all!}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{yeah, sort of, i guess. i...i'm sorry i locked you up. i thought...i thought... i think maybe i am crazy!}
<A>__{she looks at him. breakthrough? very calm now, the doctor.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{what made you think that?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{jeffrey mason said it was my idea about the virus. and suddenly, i wasn't sure. we talked when i was in the institution, and it was all...fuzzy. the drugs and stuff.}
<P>__{(horrified)}
<D>__{you think maybe i'm the one who wiped out the human race? it was my idea?}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{nobody is going to wipe out the human race. not you or jeffrey or anybody else. you've created something in your mind, james a substitute reality. in order to avoid something you don't want to face.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i'm..."mentally divergent". i would love to believe that.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{it can be dealt with, but only if you want to. i can help you.}
<A>__{cole reacts to the sound of voices in the woods, dogs barking.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i need help all right. they're coming after me.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{first, it's important that you surrender to them instead of them catching you running. okay?}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(brightening)}
<D>__{it would be great if i'm crazy. if i'm wrong about everything...the world will be okay. i will never have to live underground.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{give me the gun.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{the gun! ... i lost it}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{you're sure?}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(showing her)}
<D>__{no gun!}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{stars! air! i can live here. breathe!}
<A>__{railly starts around to the front of the car.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{i'm going to attract their attention, let them know where we are, okay?}
<A>__{railly gets in the driver's seat...and starts to honk the horn.}
<C>__{railly}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{they'll tell you to put your hands on top of your head. do what they tell you. you're going to get better, james i know it!}
<A>__{angle on cole, spotting something on the ground. an insect! he reaches down to grab it, but, instead, grins, grabs some grass, stands, and starts rubbing it happily all over his face. the horn blares as cole looks up at the sky. angle on the night sky, the moon full, the sky rich with stars. angle on cole, tears of joy running down his face.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{i love this world!}
<A>__{angle on railly, in the driver's seat, hearing near by shouts from the woods. the police are almost here. she gets out of the car, starts around toward cole.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{remember, i'm going to help you. i will stay with you. i won't let them...}
<A>__{she breaks off mid sentence...stares, stunned! cole is gone. disappeared.}
