<L>__{interior pyramid labyrinth long corridor}
<A>__{lex is back in the darkened maze of stone corridors. she only has the pocket flashlight for illumination, and the battery is giving out. it's getting very dark, and she's getting very disoriented. she looks down at her digital wrist compass, but it has been smashed in the fall. it's useless.}

<D>__{damn it!}
<A>__{she's hopelessly lost.}

<A>__{lex makes a wrong turn and finds herself in a dead end corridor. she turns around and stops in her tracks. standing at the other end of the corridor, blocking her escape, is scar. he holds a short metal tube in one hand. suddenly both ends of the tube telescope out to form the predator spear. lex refuses to show fear. it's a brave effort but an unsuccessful one. she's terrified. and he knows it. scar's predator vision: lex outlined in distinctive heat signature. zoom in on her backpack, to reveal the outline of a predator gun within. this is what scar wants.}

<A>__{she repeats sebastian's words over and over again softly, trying to convince herself or prepare herself to do the unthinkable. without ever taking her eyes off scar, lex slowly takes off her backpack. she holds it in her hand as scar watches her. lex slides the gun across the floor. scar picks it up. a beat. then something suddenly moves behind him. an alien, just about to strike. scar senses the movement just in time but he hasn't had enough time to mount his gun. he turns and brings his spear up in defense. the alien has the upper hand however, and slams scar to the ground. scar loses his grip on the spear and it slides across the floor toward lex. the alien pressing its advantage. the inner mouth snaps at scar's face. just inches away. scar rolls backwards, using the alien's own weight against it. a classic judo move. the alien flies over scar and crashes into the wall beside lex! lex gets her hands on the predator spear just as the alien rights itself. without hesitation the alien leaps at the nearest prey, lex. lex and the first alien. a frozen tableau, rendered in extreme slow motion. the alien caught mid flight, leaping through the air toward lex. lex bringing up the predator spear in defense. it's an epic moment. suddenly, the image returns to normal time, and the alien completes its flight with terrifying speed. the force and impact of the alien is its undoing however, for it impales itself on the spear. lex struggles to keep hold of the spear. she leans back, hoisting the impaled alien into the air. the alien refuses to die, however. its own body weight is causing it to slide down the spear toward lex! every second, the snapping jaws of the creature drop closer to lex's exposed face. the alien impaled on the spear finally dies. his jaws barely an inch from lex's face. close on lex's forehead as the three red dots of the laser sighting system appear on her face. she looks up to see scar pointing the gun straight at her. there is a tense moment between the human and the predator. then the three red dots slowly move off her face to the real target, behind her.}
