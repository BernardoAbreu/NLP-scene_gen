<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{what the hell is going on? my men have been standing here for an hour. i don't know what to tell them.}
<A>__{close on remer (the officer we told you to remember) standing before the ranks. he eyes hase and olbricht suspiciously, trying to hear what they are saying. after a moment, hase addresses the men.}

<D>__{at ease, gentlemen.}
<A>__{olbricht addresses the men, trying unsuccessfully to hide his nerves.}

<D>__{what did i tell you? a drill.}
<A>__{but remer is not so sure. the way he stares at olbricht makes us nervous. close on: olbricht sees remer looking at him, making note of the esteemed knight's cross pinned to remer's uniform. olbricht leans toward hase.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{that man there. who is he?}
<C>__{hase}
