<D>__{i haven't had a key lime pie in ten years.}
<C>__{mabel}
<D>__{when ya had it, did ya like it?}
<C>__{mickey}

<C>__{mabel}
<P>__{(to someone o.s.)}

<A>__{camera pulls back and we see for the first time mallory knox, mickey's wife, sitting on a counter stool next to him. her back is to the camera as well.}
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{nada, rosey.}
<C>__{mabel}

<D>__{it's mabel.}
<A>__{mabel exits frame.}
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{whatever.}
<A>__{mallory hops from the stool, walks over and grabs the jar next to the cash register, then dumping out the coins on the counter, she selects a quarter.}
<C>__{mabel}
<D>__{hey, what the hell do you think you're doin'?}
<A>__{mallory saunters past the cowboy playing pinball. as his eyes follow mallory, he loses his ball. she walks to the jukebox in the back, inserts the quarter, selects a song, punches the buttons, a needle lands on a record, and a good god almighty rockabilly tune cuts through the coffee shop. mabel brings mickey his pie and milk.}
<C>__{mabel}
<P>__{(to mickey)}
<D>__{she ought not be doing that. that's for jerry's kids, not rock 'n roll.}
<A>__{camera moves around to a cu of mickey. this is the first time we see him. as he takes a bite of green pie:}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{i can't take her anywhere.}
<A>__{mallory starts doing a slow seductive fandango around the coffee shop. she's really cooking and smoking. pinball cowboy and mabel are starting to wonder just who the hell these people are. mickey isn't paying much attention. he's too busy enjoying his pie and milk.}
