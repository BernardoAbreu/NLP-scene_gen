<D>__{one thing you need to know about us nightstalkers. when you join our club, you get this nifty little tracking node surgically implanted in your body }
<C>__{grimwood}
<D>__{bullshit.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{scout's honor. one of us gets lost, the others just dial up the satellite and presto, instant cavalry.}
<A>__{grimwood looks to asher and danica, unsure.}
<C>__{as her}
<D>__{he's bluffing.}
<C>__{danica}
<P>__{(smiling, playing along)}
<D>__{okay, king, where did they put this tracking node of yours?}
<A>__{he motions for her to draw closer, whispering.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{it's in my left ass cheek }
<A>__{whack! danica slaps king's face, making him see stars.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{alright. alright, it's in my right ass cheek }

<D>__{ pull down my tighty whities see for yourself.}
<C>__{danica}
<D>__{enough! it's not funny anymore!}
<A>__{behind danica, grimwood and asher both cough. king lifts his bruised face, staring up at danica through blood shrouded eyes. for the first time, we get a sense of his true hatred for her.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{no, it's not, you horse humping bitch }
<P>__{(wincing as he breathes)}
<D>__{ but it will be a few seconds from now.}
<C>__{danica}
<P>__{(coughing)}
<D>__{and what happens then, lover?}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{hammer time.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{see, that tickle in your throat you're feeling right now?}
<A>__{danica coughs again, blinks repeatedly, as if her eyes were irritated. she rubs them, looks to the others. they're feeling the effects too. and grimwood's face is smoking!}

<A>__{we go macro, shrinking down until we see a cloud of tiny silver particles blowing into the room. the particles are dusting the vampires, being unwittingly inhaled by them and we're back to normal as the vampires react en mass, suddenly gagging, their throats and faces on fire.}

<B>__{the skylight above them}
<A>__{shatters as blade crashes down. he lands in a cat like stance, then flips over into a cartwheel, kicking grimwood in the face. as grimwood goes down, asher and danica scatter blade tackles grimwood, sending both of them over the railing into the lower level of the penthouse.}
