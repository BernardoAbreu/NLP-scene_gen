<A>__{it is raining hard. columbus is floundering in the mud, supervising a mixed work force of spanish and indians. they are attempting to raise the huge wheel of a watermill. despite columbus' shouts of encouragement, it's clear the wheel is far too heavy and the mud too deep. close by, on horseback, moxica watches the scene. columbus, plastered with wet mud, clambers out of the pit and approaches him.}

<D>__{don moxica we need your horse.}
<A>__{moxica looks down at the sodden, dirty figure.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{we can't raise the wheel without it.}
<C>__{moxica}
<D>__{my horse doesn't work.}
<A>__{a beat. columbus wipes some mud from his eyes.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{don moxica we all have to work.}
<C>__{moxica}
<D>__{you did not hear me, don colon. not my horse.}
<A>__{he starts to turn away; columbus grabs hold of the reins.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{forgive me, don moxica. but it was your horse i was talking about.}
<A>__{a beat. moxica stares down at an equally determined columbus. then, in front of everyone, moxica has to dismount, and suffer the disgrace of it.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{thank you, don moxica.}
<A>__{columbus leads the horse away.}
