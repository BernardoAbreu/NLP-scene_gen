<A>__{dead tired players toweling off, dressing. the trainer's room is crowded with aching, cramped up, contused players. across the way, lattimer lifts weights, alone in the weight room. clayton and humes consider this from outside winters' office.}
<C>__{clayton}
<D>__{shit, lattimer's an animal all of a sudden. benchin' 450. he's gotta be on somethin'.}
<C>__{humes}
<D>__{what, steroids? why do you always think my guys are juicin'?}
<C>__{clayton}
<D>__{i don't know... he's on the punt team for three years, then gains 35 pounds of rip in one summer and an attitude to go with it.}
<A>__{winters, who's heard all this, comes by.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{we're not doctors, gentlemen. the ncaa has testing programs for this. let's let them worry about it.}
<P>__{(to clayton)}
<D>__{besides, it's not that hard to put on 35 pounds in a summer, if you really hit the gym.}
<A>__{winters walks on into his office. clayton nods, realizing this subject is now closed.}
