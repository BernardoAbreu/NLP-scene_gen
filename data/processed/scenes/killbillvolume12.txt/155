<L>__{interior the bride's car (moving) day}
<A>__{the bride behind the wheel of the convertible, her long blonde hair whipping in the wind, talks to bill for the first time in five years and six months.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{hello bill.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{kiddo, is that really you?}
<C>__{the bride}

<D>__{i hear you were driving a truck?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{my pussy wagon died on me. who's your little friend?}
<A>__{he glances down at the sleeping child.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{oh, you mean the little tow head next to me, who looks extraordinarily like you?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{yeah, that one.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{her name is b.b.}
<A>__{the bride gets choked up again, emotion betrays her voice.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{b.b.?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{yes. do you approve?}
<A>__{she wipes her eyes. her hand moves under her shirt, fingertips rest on scar.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{yes. can she hear us?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{not now, she's in dream land.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{how old is she?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what do you mean by that?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{how many years has she been alive?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{don't ask how old she is, ask, if she's five.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{is she five?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{aren't mothers like god, aren't you supposed to automatically know?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{i did and i do.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i want to meet her.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{have dinner with us at my hacienda tonight. she's expecting you.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i knew you were on your way, so i told b.b. her mommy was coming to see her.}
<C>__{the bride}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{what have you told her about me?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{that you were sick, that you were asleep, but one day you'd wake up and come back to her. and she asked me, "if mommy's been asleep since i was born, how will she know what i look like?" to which i replied, "because mommy's been dreaming of you." and she said, "then i'm gonna start dreaming of her." so i gave her a picture of you }
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{ which one?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{the one i took of you in paris, sitting on the steps with the baguette in your hand. since she was one and a half years old, she's slept with that picture of you next to her bed.}
<A>__{the exact photo dissolves over the bride's face, then}
<B>__{dissolves away.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{you know, prettier photos of me do exist.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{and she's seen them. but the one she wants looking after her while she sleeps is the one of you holding bread.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{we normally have dinner around seven, is that convenient?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{pause....the cars get closer...}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{when do we cross swords?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{well, it just so happens, my hacienda comes with its very own private beach. and my private beach, just so happens to look particularly beautiful bathed in moonlight. and there just so happens to be a full moon out tonight. so, swordfighter, if you want to sword fight, that's where i suggest. but if you wanna be old school about it then we can wait till dawn, and slice each other up at sunrise, like a couple real life honest to goodness samurais. as per usual kiddo, i will leave the big decisions up to you.}
<A>__{the cars will soon pass...}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{do me a courtesy?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{anything.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{slow down as we pass...i want another look at her.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{wear something nice tonight?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{i have a dress all picked out.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{will i like it?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{you said i looked beautiful last time you saw me in it.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i will dress up too.}
<A>__{his foot moves off the gas, slowing the car; her foot does the same. the cars in slow motion start to pass. the bride looks into the other car. we zoom past bill to the little girl in the passenger seat. we go one frame at a time till the car moves past us, to bill holding a pistol with a large silencer pointing right at our face. he fires. it emits only a tiny phoof. the bride throws herself across the passenger seat as the driver's side window explodes over her head. the two cars pass each other. the bride straightens herself in the driver's seat. she looks in the rearview as bill and her daughter drive away. grabbing the cell phone she screams in it;}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{you fucking maricone!}
<A>__{bill on his cell, eyes on rearview.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{now you just wait one second there little missy. unless i'm confused, we are trying to kill each other aren't we? now i wasn't planning on taking a shot at you in front of the squirt, but, she is asleep. and if you're gonna forget everything i ever taught you, and gawk like you ain't got good sense, i'm gonna take a shot, am i not?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{did she wake up?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{of course not. she's like you that way. i look forward to this evening. it was great speaking with you, bea.}
<A>__{he hangs up.}
