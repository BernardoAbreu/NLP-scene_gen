<L>__{interior tunnel farther down tracks a moment later}
<A>__{in this stretch of the tunnel the lanterns don't seem to be working and the mynah is completely invisible. when he comes to a fork in the tracks, he has to wait for the sound of the bird's shrill voice to guide him:}
<C>__{mynah}
<D>__{awwrrk! follow me.}
<A>__{tiptree stumbles ahead blindly in the darkness. he trips on the tracks and drops the suitcase. as he's getting to his feet, a flashlight shines directly in his face...}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{stop there.}
<A>__{the mynah bird flutters through the beam of light and perches on the shoulder of an unseen figure. tiptree cowers and squints, trying to make him out, but the figure who stands before him is shielding his face with an open umbrella.}
<C>__{tiptree}
<D>__{i've cooperated. i've done everything you said.}
<C>__{penguin}
<D>__{open the case.}
<A>__{tiptree lifts the lid, revealirig two ravens in the suitcase. a cackling laugh echoes in the darkness.}
<C>__{penguin }
<D>__{...two ravens?}
<C>__{tiptree}
<D>__{the other one is bruce wayne's.}
<P>__{(trembling)}
<D>__{he doesn't know anything about this. you've got what you want. there's no need to }
<C>__{penguin}
<D>__{thank you, mr. tiptree. you may go.}
<A>__{tiptree stands. he backs away from the suitcase warily.}
<C>__{tiptree}
<D>__{my family. you won't }
<C>__{penguin}
<D>__{we'll certainly take your unexpected generosity into consideration.}
<C>__{tiptree}
<D>__{we ?!?}
<P>__{(shielding his eyes)}
<D>__{you're not batman.}
<C>__{penguin}
<D>__{no. i'm his brother in law birdman. now move out.}
