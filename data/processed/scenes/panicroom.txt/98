<L>__{interior panic room night}
<A>__{in the panic room, meg knows this can't go on forever. she turns away from the portal, looks up at the vent, where the streamers still stream. she looks to the other side of the room, to where sarah found the waterproof matches and lighters. she thinks. takes a deep lungful of fresh air from the tube and crawls over to the lighters. she selects one, snatches up a screwdriver. sarah looks at her, has a vague idea of what she's thinking, but can't believe it. she shakes her head vehemently. in response, meg picks up two or three of the fireproof blankets and piles them over sarah, right up to her disbelieving eyes. she bends down, takes another gulp of air. but she's getting woozy. this can't go on much longer. she staggers across the room, hoists herself back up onto the shelf she stood on before, and gets right up next to the vent. holding her breath to avoid breathing the toxic gas, she unscrews the vent cover. the duct is wide enough to put your arm in. she reaches in, past a bundle of multicolored wires that run down through the wall. she reaches all the way in, lighter in hand. inside the duct, we see her hand crawl in, lighter clenched between her fingers. she raises a thumb to the flint wheel, cranks it once. too slow. not even a spark. her hand shakes. she tries again. still no spark. but with the effort and the angle, when she thumbs the lighter it makes her hand twitch, banging up against the sides of the duct with a hollow boom.}
