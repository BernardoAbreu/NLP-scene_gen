<L>__{exterior concrete ditch day}
<A>__{the shattered concrete has been pulled away to fully reveal the creature's horrendous head. start close on it: oozing blood, slavering mouth plates hanging open, hook tentacles lolling out. widen to see earl and rhonda, sweating, dusty and tired, staring in awe and cringing at the stench.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{jesus christ...think it smells like that 'cause it's dead?}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{i don't see any eyes...must be totally subterranean...and those tentacles...}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{i think they shoot right outta its mouth, hook you, and pull you right in. good thing we stopped it before it killed anybody else.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<P>__{(shudders)}
<D>__{yeah, i'm lucky it didn't find me .}
<P>__{(overwhelmed)}
<D>__{this is important, you know. this is like, well, let's say it, it's probably the biggest zoological discovery of the century. the century? forget it. history .}
<A>__{we can hear a shovel digging up above, and now val shouts:}
<C>__{val }
<D>__{i got it! here's the other end! just look at what we caught here!}
<A>__{earl and rhonda climb up. crane up with them to reveal the whole animal! val, digging excitedly with rhonda's shovel, is just scraping away the last loose dirt from the creature's tail. the whole length of the immense thirty foot beast is partially uncovered, in king sized bas relief.}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(hushed)}
<D>__{this is one big mother!}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{so this is the guy that had your seismos working overtime?}
<A>__{she nods, stepping down to study the creature. the body is stream lined, cigar shaped, maybe eight feet in diameter at its thickest. it's covered with hundreds of short, rear pointing, retractable spikes. rhonda gingerly jiggles one. it can be pushed in and out of its socket like a plunger.}
<C>__{rhonda }
<D>__{it must push itself along with these. hundreds of them pushing at once. that's how it can move so fast. i mean this thing was tripping sensors all over the valley. no wonder i couldn't...}
<A>__{a chilling thought stops her in mid sentence. she springs down into the drainage ditch to get her backpack, pulling out her seismograph printouts. she studies them frantically during:}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{hey, rhonda, you ever heard of any thing like this before?}
<C>__{val}
<P>__{(elbows earl)}
<D>__{sure, earl, everybody knows about them. we just didn't tell you . come on, nobody's ever seen one of these! we're really in on something here!}
<A>__{the guys looks at each other. one thought immediately springs to their minds.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{pham van don't get his mitts on this for no measly fifteen bucks!}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{you got that right!}
<A>__{while they bask in their fame to be, rhonda continues to study the print outs, coming to a terrifying conclusion.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{here's the plan: we'll get a...a flatbed, i guess, with a big winch, figure a five ton anyway.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{naw, don't want to winch it. that'd tear it all up. want to lift it. some kind of crane with lifting straps.}
<A>__{but rhonda interrupts now really scared.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{hey, hey, shut up! the way i figure it. there are five more of these things!}
<A>__{val and earl shut right up. earl edges up a fencepost. val sidles up onto a rock during:}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{five more?}
<A>__{rhonda paws through her unwieldy printouts, pointing out jagged ink lines on the graphs, comparing different ones.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{yeah, darn it, look. i've got seismographs all over the valley. if you compare the different readings, there have to be five. here's one at two o'clock yesterday, but here's another one three miles away at the same time. so that's two. now, here...}
<A>__{the men leap from their perches and hustle her in the direction she came from.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{we'll take your word for it.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{yeah. where's your truck?}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{the other side of that dome.}
<A>__{she indicates what to most of us would be a hill, dotted with huge boulders thrusting out of the sandy desert soil like big mushrooms. the trio jogs toward the hill.}
