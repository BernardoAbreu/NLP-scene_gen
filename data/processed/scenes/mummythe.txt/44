<L>__{interior imhotep's chamber day}
<A>__{wham! imhotep's wooden coffin is dropped to the ground next to his stone sarcophagus. evelyn is very excited.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{oh my god, i've dreamed about this ever since i was a little girl.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{you dream about dead guys?}
<A>__{evelyn just gives him a look, then starts brushing dirt and cobwebs off the top of the coffin. then she freezes.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{look, all the sacred spells have been chiseled off. the hieratics and hieroglyphs that protect the deceased on his journey into the afterlife, they've been removed. this man was cursed,... doomed.}
<A>__{o'connell and jonathan are too excited to care.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{tough break.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{yes, i'm all tears, now let's see who's inside, shall we?}
<A>__{evelyn can't believe these guys. jonathan inserts the key box into the coffin's lock. turns it. the lid cracks open with a hiss. they all react to the foul stench. then o'connell grabs the lid. it's stuck. he pulls with all his might. jonathan helps him. it starts to give way. slowly. slowly. slooooowly. and then it suddenly pops open and the most hideous, maggot infested, rotten corpse imaginable jumps up!}
<D>__{o'connell evelyn jonathan ahhhhh!!!}
<A>__{they all jump back. scared to death. imhotep is now the 'elephant man' of corpses; twisted and deformed. the years have not been kind. he slumps back into his coffin.}
