<L>__{interior day room late afternoon}
<A>__{as bromden crosses into the day room, gets a seat, and sits facing the hallway, bursting with expectation. a long beat, then the attendant appears with mcmurphy and taps at the side door to the nurses' station. the acutes break off their card game and look at mcmurphy; their faces hang open at his appearance. big nurse crosses to the side door, opens it, and steps out into the day room. to the attendant as she takes mcmurphy by the arm:}
<C>__{big nurse}
<D>__{thank you...}
<C>__{attendant}
<D>__{yes, ma'am...}
<A>__{the attendant exits.}
<C>__{big nurse}
<P>__{(to mcmurphy)}
<D>__{now, let's find you a place to sit, shall we, mister mcmurphy?}
<A>__{big nurse gently guides mcmurphy to a seat on the chronics' side of the room. bromden can hardly contain himself as he waits for mcmurphy to go into his act. the acutes have already absorbed the reality of mcmurphy's condition as they exchange looks with each other.}
<C>__{fredrickson}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{lobotomy...}
<C>__{harding}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{scanlon}
<D>__{yeah, that gary blinker is fulla shit...}
<A>__{the acutes turn back to their card game as harding shuffles and deals the cards out. bromden keeps his eyes glued to big nurse and mcmurphy.}
<C>__{big nurse}
<P>__{(sitting mcmurphy down)}
<D>__{here now, you sit here... that's it...}
<A>__{big nurse pats mcmurphy's face and crosses back to the nurses' station. mcmurphy just sits there, his head lolling to one side. bromden waits for mcmurphy to go into his routine. mcmurphy just sits there. bromden snaps his fingers and slaps his thigh, then waits for mcmurphy to follow suit. mcmurphy just sits there slobbering. bromden slaps his thigh again. no response from mcmurphy. the music plays on.}
