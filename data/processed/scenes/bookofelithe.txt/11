<A>__{eli crouches on one knee before the murdered couple. he signs a cross over their ravaged bodies as he mutters a prayer under his breath. then stands and continues on down the road.}
<L>__{exterior road fork day}
<A>__{more desolate wasteland as far as the eye can see. the road forks again here. eli arrives at the junction and stops. the road eli is on leads further into the west. the other fork heads toward a small town just visible on the horizon. a hand painted sign has been driven into the dirt nearby. no words, just a series of crude pictograms. a bed. a plate of food. a water faucet. an arrow points toward the town. eli pauses, thinking it over. retrieves the ipod from his pocket. clicks the button, but no response. he sighs. he turns and heads down the other fork, toward town.}
