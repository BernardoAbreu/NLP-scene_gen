<A>__{the church of st. peter los angeles. "whoever you see here whatever you hear here stays here." that's a notice on a wall. here's another notice "no smoking." everyone is smok ing. this is an aa meeting. there's a lot of faces to look at. i don't know when we'll get to the one that's talking, but when we do it's like this. eyes like glue. 50 years old with a face the color of a snuff users hanky. he says this:}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{.. after my third recovery my wife made me swear i'd never bring another bottle into the house. and i never did. i bur ied it under the lawn. cut out a turf & stood it upright with a piece of tin foil instead of a cork. so here we are out in the yard, and she's happy because i'm getting healthy in a pair of swim ing shorts & no way near no booze. she decides to prune the roses. meanwhile, i'm laying there with a straw stuck in to the fucken lawn doing a quart of red ..}
<A>__{curious thing about drunks. their disease often amuses them.}
<D>__{that's how crazy i was i was sick for half a life till i finally found my san ity again in these rooms. don't take that drink and for the one or two new faces i see here, i say this: just do it by the day. you gotta do it by the day don't take that drink. and keep coming to these meetings. because here is where it works ..}

<A>__{ash into an ashtray and now a face. he's around 40 years old. intense eyes & dark hair. probably good looking when the ang le's right. but this is a bad angle. his name is john berlin.}
<C>__{berlin}

<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i didn't intend to speak today. matter of fact, i wasn't gonna come to the meeting .. but i wanna say a couple of things i hope may be of use, particularly as benny says, to the new faces here. i first came into this fellowship ten months ago. i came to a meeting i was convinced was gonna be my last how could a buncha drunks help me? then someone got up, i think it was micky, and described himself as "the shit around which the universe revolved." i don't know if that was original to him it doesn't matter, it was the first time i'd heard it, and i still can't think of a better way to describe how i felt we all have our own place in the darkness, and i was in such a mess i could hardly fucken see i'd lost someone very dear to me she hadn't died i had i don't know whether she left coza the drinking, or whether i drank coz i knew she was gonna leave either way, the booze won i replaced her with alcohol & anger i was angry with her, myself, everyone and everything where i was i wanted to be someplace else any place but here any moment but now but here i am, and it is now, and there's a big change about to hap pen in my life and i'm going for it coz this time i know i'm not running away i'm actually two miles into a 600 mile journey, and i feel good about myself going there so i stopped off to share that with you and to thank everyone of you, and everyone in this fellowship for letting me walk out of here, free ..}
