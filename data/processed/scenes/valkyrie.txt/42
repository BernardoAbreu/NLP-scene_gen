<L>__{interior war ministry stauffenberg's office day}
<A>__{what first catches our eye is the enormous portrait of hitler looming over stauffenberg's desk. stauffenberg sits before a mountain of paperwork, surrounded on all sides by a flurry of secretaries and aides. he looks up to find: olbricht hovering in the doorway with that look that says, "we need to talk." stauffenberg clearly doesn't have the time. he sighs.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{leave us, please.}
<A>__{the staff instantly exits a well oiled machine. stauffenberg unplugs the phone.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{you play the part of bureaucrat beautifully.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{it's the only time i can relax.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{there's a man here to interview as your adjutant.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{adjut what for?}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{no one told you?}
<P>__{(obviously not)}
<D>__{you've been promoted chief of staff for the reserve army.}
<A>__{some men might find a promotion to be good news. not stauffenberg.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{for christ's sake. don't i have enough to do?}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{unfortunately, your nocturnal activities don't count as service to the reich.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{i will refuse the promotion.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{you'll do no such thing.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{dammit, i can't handle the work i already }
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{this is an opportunity we could never have dreamed of. you're in the inner circle now with genuine access to hitler, his advisors, his schedule... we need this.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{we're not ready. we're moving too fast.}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{not half as fast as the allies. an invasion is coming, colonel. any day now. we must act and we must act soon.}
<C>__{olbricht }
<D>__{tresckow may have left you in charge of the "central solution," but in this world i still outrank you. you will accept the appointment. is that understood?}
<A>__{stauffenberg nods, grudgingly.}
<C>__{olbricht }
<D>__{now. the new man is waiting outside. he comes highly recommended. he might even be an ideal candidate.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{olbricht}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{we still need an assassin.}
<A>__{olbricht leaves. stauffenberg lets this sink in. he takes a seat and goes back to work. after a moment: a handsome soldier (36) quietly enters. titles: lieutenant werner von haeften reservist.}
<B>__{wounded during the russian campaign.}
<A>__{haeften clicks his heels and offers the nazi salute, but before he can say the words:}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{be seated.}
<A>__{thrown, haeften sits. stauffenberg continues writing, ignoring him. haeften looks up at the portrait of hitler, startled when stauffenberg finally speaks:}
<C>__{stauffenberg }
<D>__{do you know how this war will end, haeften? the portrait will be un hung... and the man will be hung.}
<A>__{stauffenberg looks up looking for a reaction to such frank and treasonous talk. he gets none. he sighs, too tired to play games.}
<C>__{stauffenberg }
<D>__{bottom line. i'm engaged in high treason with all means available to me. can i count you in?}
<A>__{and the strangest thing a reaction no one would suspect haeften relaxes, almost sighs, like someone who has at long last found a home.}
<C>__{haeften}
<D>__{for anything, sir. anything at all.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{anything is a very dangerous word.}
