<A>__{david slugs him in the face, schuyler staggers back, clutches his bleeding nose. david runs, full tilt, into the woods near the japanese tea garden. schuyler pursues amidst the trees and vegetation, running out of breath, calling after david, who's vanished. he leans against a tree, panting, dabbing at his bleeding nose with a scrap of tissue from his pocket. he hears a phone ringing, moves toward it, emerging through bushes near the academy of science... he pauses at the ringing payphone. he decides not to pick it up, looking around at the deserted museum buildings and hurrying toward civilization. he passes other payphones en route to the park exit... each one starts ringing as he approaches it. he moves faster, freaked. at the edge of the park, he snatches one up }
