<A>__{we see that the lounge chairs have been removed and the area is clear. there are scattered squashed up pieces of white paper lying about. we look to the south and see that there are three boy girl teams with one of their legs tied together, like a three legged race. the rub here is one team member has the dustpan and the other team member has the broom. a judge triggers a starter pistol and they are off. the lifeguard team falls almost immediately, and the grounds team takes a early lead over the concessions team, who are trying to figure the dustpan broom operation out. the two grounds people work tightly together and quickly advance. the lifeguards have gotten back up and are hobbling up to their first piece of trash. concessions has figured out the dustpan, but are still well behind the grounds kids. finally, the grounds kids win, with concessions up second, and lifeguards trailing in third. the judges note the finish on their clipboards.}
