<L>__{interior v'ger at inner wall}
<A>__{the most prominent area of the vast inner wall the patterns on the wall here seem to glow with life. the spacesuited figures of kirk and spock enter scene, gliding slowly toward what seems to be the central part of theses patterns.}
<B>__{closer on kirk and spock}
<A>__{as they approach and then we see the brief reverse thrusters and then forward momentum stops; motionless. then spock sees something, indicates. long angle to include sensor swarm (o) now, we see that they are tiny, multi colored points of flashing light almost like swarms of bees. they approach the inner wall at this central point and seem to "disappear" through the orifice. kirk and spock another "swarm" approaching (o) this "sensor swarm" has been coming from a direction that will take them close past kirk and spock. then, as it passes, spock reaches out quickly, grabs. he turns to kirk, his hand closed on something. close on kirk and spock (against "tube" wall) spock opens his hand, retaining a hold on something with his fingers. he brings it up to kirk's face mask it's a tiny sensor, its multi colors flashing as it tries to escape from spock's fingers. and in this close view, we see that this is a sensor very much like the one we've seen earlier embedded in the ilia probe's throat hollow. then spock releases it and it darts to join the sensor swarm near the opening of the inner wall. kirk and spock's pov (o) from this closer distance, we see that an opening ap pears in the wall, admits the sensor swarm, then closes immediately .}
<B>__{back to shot}
<A>__{kirk and spock exchange a look. their thruster jets ignite briefly, moving them in that direction.}
