<L>__{exterior gus' house night}
<A>__{chase stumbles from the house. it's a wonder he's even conscious. he swings open the van door and throws himself inside, sinking the key into the ignition.}
<L>__{interior attic night}
<A>__{marjorie is now seated before renee's theatrical make up mirror, entranced. she's wearing the beaded peach dress. with the help of renee's vast array of cosmetics, marjorie has turned herself into a stunning beauty. the lipstick isn't quite right. turning to the countertop magnifying mirror, she carefully touches up her ruby red lips. her face fills nearly the entire mirror... ...except for one rim, which reflects the dark, shadowy attic behind her. a huge eye joins her reflection in the distorting mirror. marjorie nearly jumps out of her skin. she spins around...}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{jesus, geoff! don't sneak up on me like that!}
<A>__{...but no one is there. the make up mirror catches another glimpse. renee's red lips, magnified tenfold. the lips begin to move...}
<C>__{renee}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{did you really think you could be like me?}
<A>__{renee's fist swings in, smashing a panel of the mirror... marjorie raises her hands to protect herself against the flying glass. and as her hands come down, she finds... renee standing before her. her ghostly form silhouetted by moonlight. curtains billowing around her. we never fully see her. marjorie's face goes white with fear.}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{such a young face... but you've got potential...}
<A>__{renee grabs a fistful of marjorie's hair, viciously yanking her head back...}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{we'll do the eyes first. you always start with the eyes...}
<A>__{renee lashes out, slashing a mirror shard across the skin beneath marjorie's right eye. marjorie screams.}
