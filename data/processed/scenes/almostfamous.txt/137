<L>__{interior cleveland arena night same time}
<A>__{penny lane stands on stage facing the empty arena. the roadies have packed up and moved on. she is alone in the poetic and trash filled structure that was just hours ago filled with people. (behavior to come)}
<T>__{intercut with:}
<L>__{interior dressing room night}
<A>__{the band meeting continues.}
<C>__{russell}
<P>__{(passionate)}
<D>__{hey man, it's not about the money! it's about playing music, and turning people on!}
<A>__{the band agrees.}
<C>__{dennis hope}
<P>__{(delicately)}
<D>__{yes, of course. clearly. respectfully.}
<A>__{but on the distasteful}
<D>__{subject of money. just know. you're making it right now and it's all }
<A>__{he gestures to infinity.}
<C>__{dennis hope }
<D>__{ out there.}
<A>__{i'm just talking about}
<D>__{bringing it }
<A>__{bringing his hand together in a fist, he returns it, close to his heart.}
<C>__{dennis hope }
<D>__{ back here.}
<A>__{the band looks at dick, who manages not to be speechless.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{but why should we pay you for something we can do ourselves?}
<C>__{dennis hope}
<P>__{(immediately)}
<D>__{do you know how to keep from getting charged for the ice below the floorboards of chicago stadium? do you know how to do a headlining tour, do you claire rothman at the l.a. forum? do you know bobbi cowan, lisa robinson, jim ladd, frank barcelona?}
<P>__{(look around, amazed)}
<D>__{this is cleveland. where's kid leo??}
<P>__{(basics)}
<D>__{do you know how you get a record not pressed but played?}
<A>__{do you know? i}
<D>__{didn't invent the rainy day, man. i just own the best umbrella.}
<A>__{he laughs. it's fun. band members are now listening, curiously spellbound.}
<C>__{dennis hope }
<D>__{because as much as you may believe that it will last forever, it does not last forever... your biggest fan right now soon they're going to go to college, gonna wanna buy clothes, spend that money some other way, and you know what?}
<P>__{(the final insult) they'll tape your record from a friend's}
<D>__{copy.}
<A>__{russell stops fingering his guitar. shot moves across the faces of the band members. pain.}
<C>__{dennis hope }
<D>__{you've got to take what you can, when you can, while you can. and you've got to do it now . that's what the big boys do.}
<A>__{the band squirms, but listens.}
<C>__{dennis hope }
<D>__{because if you think mick jagger will still be out there trying to be a rock star at age fifty, you're sadly sadly mistaken.}
<A>__{now he's reaching them. their slackened roar weary faces stare back at the young dynamo.}
<C>__{dick}
<P>__{(flustered)}
<D>__{yeah, well... we'll think about what you said.}
<C>__{dennis hope}
<P>__{(casually)}
<D>__{no no. you don't understand. i will think about it. i'm not auditioning. i came here to decide whether i want to represent you.}
<A>__{so i will stand outside}
<D>__{for a moment, and think about whether i want to stay.}
<A>__{he leaves the room with a pleasant shrug. stunned silence. william watches their body language. no one wants to talk first. their faces read as who was that guy, and how can we talk him into staying?}
