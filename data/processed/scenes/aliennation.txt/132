<L>__{interior methane room night}
<A>__{jetson grabs o'neal by the collar and drags him deeper into the deserted room.}
<C>__{o'neal}
<D>__{hey, what are you, crazy?! you can't come in here like this! hey!}
<A>__{sykes reaches the doorway, stops and stares.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{so much for playing it smart...}
<A>__{o'neal's feet are barely touching the ground as jetson moves along the row of drug manufacturing equipment. finally he reaches a stainless steel tub... he runs a long finger along the inside, comes up with some residue of the drug. it glistens blue on his finger. it holds him mesmerized for several moments... his expression that of a former junkie beholding the stuff he used to covet so.}
<C>__{sykes}
<P>__{(tentatively stepping closer)}
<D>__{is that it...?}
<A>__{a beat, than jetson explodes he sweeps a rack of equipment off the worktable, savagely wipes the drug from his hand onto o'neal's shirt front as he slams and pins the bug eyed o'neal to the wall.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{uh, george...}
<C>__{jetson}
<P>__{(in o'neal's face)}
<D>__{where is the drug? where have they taken it?}
<C>__{o'neal}
<P>__{(choking)}
<D>__{what drug? this is an oil refinery, you...}
<C>__{jetson}
<P>__{(pushing harder)}
<D>__{where?!}
<C>__{o'neal}
<P>__{(unable to breathe)}
<D>__{you... can't do... this!}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{george, uh... you're gonna break his little chest bones...}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{stay out of this, matthew.}
<P>__{(to o'neal)}
<D>__{tell me where the drug has been taken or i will crush your lungs against this wall.}
<A>__{o'neal is experiencing real fear now. sykes has decided to back jetson up, for better or worse. he takes the "good cop" role.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{don't piss him off, o'neal. when he gets like this, i can't control him. i've seen this before. he got like this once i saw him jerk a guy's spine out and show it to him. nothing i could do. i hadda go throw up.}
<C>__{o'neal}
<P>__{(at length, with great effort)}
<D>__{... they took the stuff out, all of it this afternoon.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{how much?}
<C>__{o'neal}
<D>__{about fifty kilos... of concentrate... and some street grade... in tubes.}
<A>__{jetson reacts to this... then increases the pressure. o'neal is really in bad trouble now. even sykes takes a half step forward thinking jetson might actually crush this man.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{where have they taken it?}
<C>__{o'neal}
<D>__{encount... encounters club.}
<A>__{finally, jetson eases off. o'neal slumps to the floor, gasping for air.}
