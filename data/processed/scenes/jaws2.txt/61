<L>__{interior brody house bathroom and hallway night}
<A>__{ellen follows brody, watches as he washes under too hot water.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{oww!}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{careful. what's wrong?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{nothing, huh?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{that's what i said. is there any of that hand cleaner stuff?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{use the little brush there. why were you at santos'?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{found one of the missing victims from that boat deal.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{oh. want to talk about it?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{terrific.}
<A>__{mike comes up the stairs, and is starting into his room when brody spots him; sean is just behind him.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{michael.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{you want to come here a minute?}
<A>__{mike shrugs and crosses to his father; sean whizzes past on into his room.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{hi dad.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{hiya yourself.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{he expects something: this is a formal audience with the head of the house.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{i got something for you to do tomorrow.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i kind of had plans...}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{sailing?}
<P>__{(mike nods)}
<D>__{forget it. you're beached. grounded. no more boats.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{hey, come on...}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{no backtalk! i spoke to upton, at the beach, and he's got a job for you there. you can work until school starts.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{all summer?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{he wanted a job, he's got one. i want to see that boat out of the water by tomorrow night.}
<A>__{we see sean's door opening as he peeps into the hall to see what the fuss is about. angle on sean's door it opens a few inches, he looks out at the grownups and his brother, decides he wants no part of this, and quietly closes the door.}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{dad, please...}
<C>__{brody }
<D>__{tomorrow night. out of the water.}
<B>__{angle on the hallway}
<A>__{mike silently storms into his room, not so silently slamming the door as he exits. from inside the room, loud rock music muffled behind the door an expression of teen age rebellion.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{not so loud!}
<A>__{the music lowers its volume. brody turns to go into the bedroom, to take his shoes off, to go to bed...}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{i know what you're going to say.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{do you?}
<C>__{brody}
<P>__{(on the bed)}
<D>__{in the city, it happened all the time some kid o.d.'s on a rooftop, top, a drunk gets cut in pieces under the brooklyn local, old people die alone in shitty apartments and three weeks later someone calls the cops because of the smell and the flies. call the cops. what are we, immune?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{it was bad, wasn't it.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{the goddamn smell is always the same.}
<P>__{(he shudders at the recollection)}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{are you going to be able to sleep?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{yeah. i think so.}
<P>__{(he raises his voice)}
<D>__{mike! keep it down, for chrissake!}
<A>__{ellen gets up, and quietly closes the door. the upstairs hallway is empty, the doors closed. the brody household compartmented and closed for the night.}
