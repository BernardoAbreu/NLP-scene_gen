<L>__{exterior village dusk}
<A>__{jacques walks up a steep road bordering the port, almost dry now. two boys about his age run up the streets; call out, catch up with him and gesture toward the port.}
<C>__{the boys}
<D>__{jacques! come quick!}
<L>__{exterior pier dusk}
<A>__{the little boys tug jacques to the end of the pier and point to something in the water.}
<C>__{boys}
<D>__{look! right there! it's shining!}
<A>__{jacques walks over, and sure enough sees something shining a few feet down in the water.}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(squinting)}
<D>__{a coin.}
<C>__{first boy}
<D>__{i found it.}
<C>__{second boy}
<D>__{liar!}
<A>__{camera pans and we see a middle aged priest loading supplies into a small boat. he stops to watch the children's negotiations. little jacques is putting his flippers on.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{ok. i will get it, but no fighting, all right?}
<A>__{the two boys nod as they point to the coin.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{we'll split it.}
<C>__{first boy}
<D>__{you can't split a coin. that's stupid.}
<C>__{second boy}
<D>__{he's right. you're stupid.}
<A>__{the pope smiles.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{then we'll buy something and split that.}
<C>__{second boy}
<D>__{a helicopter...}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{it's a small coin.}
<C>__{first boy}
<D>__{a ferrari.}
<C>__{second boy}
<D>__{i don't want a ferrari... what is it?}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(interrupting them)}
<D>__{maybe a little radio.}
<A>__{the two boys look at each other.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{well. we'll decide later. the light is going.}
<C>__{second boy}
<D>__{i get the radio from after school, until midnight.}
<C>__{first boy}
<D>__{since when do you stay up until midnight?}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{all right, all right... can i concentrate? and you can stop pointing. i've seen it.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{i've seen it too.}
<A>__{the voice is enzo's. another young boy wearing little round glasses.}
<C>__{first boy}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{shit, it's the italian!}
<A>__{he is slightly older than jacques but he is taller. enzo is with roberto, his younger brother, the only one allowed to carry his flippers. five kids are behind him.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{well, if it isn't the little frenchman! how is the little frenchman?}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(cool)}
<D>__{fine!}
<A>__{enzo pats jacques on the shoulder and leaves his hand there a lightly intimidating gesture.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{you don't mind if i go instead, do you?}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(intimidated, and}
<D>__{pretending not to}
<P>__{be)}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{if you did mind, you'd tell me, wouldn't you?}
<A>__{enzo pats his shoulder reassuringly.}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(to his brother)}
<D>__{roberto, mio palmo!}
<A>__{roberto who has already started to moisten his big brother's gear in the water, holds a pair of dripping flippers and a glistening mask. the pope watches the scene with obvious pleasure.}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(to his brother on}
<D>__{the edge of the}
<P>__{pier)}
<D>__{count!}
<A>__{sure of himself, enzo takes a deep breath and dives in the water. roberto counts out loud.}
<C>__{roberto}
<D>__{1... 2... 3...}
<A>__{the kids all walk over to the edge of the pier. a few feet away, jacques takes off his flippers.}
<C>__{roberto}
<D>__{4... 5... 6...}
<A>__{enzo bursts out of the water, the coin in his hand. the children cheer and clap. roberto rushes to catch the equipment that comes flying at him, piece by piece. enzo walks over to jacques.}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(showing him the coin)}
<D>__{who's is it now? you saw it but i dove for it!}
<A>__{jacques doesn't answer. enzo smiles and slowly puts the coin in his pocket. he pulls it out again and waves it under jacques' nose.}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(without turning around)}
<D>__{roberto? how long?}
<C>__{roberto}
<D>__{six seconds.}
<A>__{enzo looks at jacques for a while.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{i will throw it back into the water. you dive and if you do less than six, it's yours.}
<A>__{jacques doesn't say anything, then finally shakes his head, negatively. enzo smiles, taps him on the shoulder.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{brava!}
<A>__{the first boy finally sums up his courage to speak.}
<C>__{boy}
<P>__{(timidly)}
<D>__{enzo? i saw the coin first... we split?}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{you can't split a coin, stupid.}
<A>__{enzo laughing, sticks the coin in his pocket and leaves the pier with his gang. the pope smiles and pulls a coin from his pocket. with his flippers dangling from one hand, jacques sadly stares out at the sea. the pope calls him over.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{jacques... come, look.}
<A>__{jacques goes over to him, sees where he is pointing, the faint gleam of the coin underwater.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{is it a coin shining down there?}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(overjoyed)}
<D>__{it is. it's a coin! i will get it for you, father!}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{it'll be for the poor.}
<A>__{jacques, intent on the coin's glimmer, quickly slips on his fins, prepares his mask. he swims in the water like a fish, goes directly to the coin. scoops it up, brings it to the surface. he breaks water, waves the coin, looks for the priest and sees he is no longer there.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{padre?}
<A>__{he looks at the ancient impression on the coin "boy on a dolphin".}
