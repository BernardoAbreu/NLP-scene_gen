<L>__{interior bachelor apartment day}
<A>__{one room, bathroom and kitchenette. a laptop computer and peripherals are on a table, along with some cell phones, a toolbox, and some jumbles of electronic circuitry. in the main room, there are three large lazy boy easy chairs, side by side, facing a 27 inch tv on a stand. a cloth covers two objects sitting atop the tv. the door opens. mrs. han, joy, sam, and lisa walk in, rigid with fear. javal, beretta 9mm in hand, comes in behind them and closes the door. javal strips off his sweat soaked shirt and wipes his face with it. mrs. han realizes he's wired to the moon... and it terrifies her.}
<C>__{javal}
<D>__{does anyone need to use the rest room? this will be your last opportunity for a few hours.}
<P>__{(no takers)}
<D>__{very well. mrs. han, sam, joy, please sit here.}
<P>__{(indicates the lazy boys; then turns to lisa)}
<D>__{and you... what is your name?}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{lisa...}
<A>__{still holding the beretta, he grabs a polo shirt from the closet and pulls it on. as the family sits in the chairs:}
<C>__{javal}
<D>__{no, mrs. han, this one. thank you.}
<A>__{he takes a pair of handcuffs out of his pants pocket. he tries to handcuff lisa, hands behind her back, but she resists.}
<C>__{javal}
<P>__{(continuing; sotto)}
<D>__{you afford me some additional bargaining power. but not much.}
<A>__{she wilts. javal cuffs her to the handles of the refrigerator. he puts a strip of duct tape from his tool box across her mouth. he uncovers one of the items atop the tv: an electronic box with three pairs of oversized, led vu meters on the front of it. we notice neat lines of wires running from each of the chairs up into it. javal flips one of a row of switches on it; a green light and the meters come to life.}
<C>__{javal}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{there. no taping your mouths, no restraints. please remain still while i explain. the meters on the left indicate sound pressure decibels. there are microphones on your chair backs. if you raise your voices above certain level, putting your meter in the red zone for more than one sustained second, the circuit will be closed.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the right meters indicate motion. there are pressure sensors inside the armrests and seats. the sensors don't like to get wet, so i hope you were honest about not needing to use the loo. if you make any excess movements, or try to leave your chair, the circuit will be closed.}
<C>__{mrs. han}
<D>__{i don't understand...}
<A>__{she looks at her sound meter, which jumped close to the red.}
<C>__{mrs. han}
<P>__{(continuing; softly)}
<D>__{what happens if the circuit closes?}
<C>__{javal}
<D>__{kaboom...}
<A>__{he uncovers the other item atop the tv a one pound brick of c 4 high explosive with the detonation mechanism jammed into it. mrs. han gasps and begins to panic.}

<D>__{easy... deep breath...}
<P>__{(to the kids)}
<D>__{do each of you understand?}
<A>__{they nod. tears roll down joy's face.}
<C>__{javal}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{keep your wits, and all will be fine.}
<A>__{he flips another switch and the green light turns yellow. he then turns on the tv. coverage of the summit is everywhere.}
