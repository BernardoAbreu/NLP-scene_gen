<A>__{mecklen glances back over his shoulder, lowering his voice.}
<D>__{mecklen (contd) (cont'd) baby, i've been co habitating with these people for the past thirty odd hours and in so doing, have stared into the face of hell. these are the premier prick cocksuckers of all time and i feel beaten by them, i feel bloodied }

<A>__{buddy's head teeters back, bangs on the keys, sour chords, thinking...thinking...he takes the deck, firing the cards up in a perfect column above his head, snatching one random out of the air with his right. he turns it over, looks...joker.}
