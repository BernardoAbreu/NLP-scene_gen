<B>__{on duke}
<A>__{he lies on the lawn, secured to the base of a tree by a long leash. eddy moves into view and stepping over to duke, leans down as though he intends to pet him:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{don't do that.}
<A>__{he turns to see joan approaching with a paper cup filled with water.}
<C>__{eddy}
<D>__{don't do what?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{you're not supposed to look him straight in the eye.}
<C>__{eddy}
<D>__{you have a dog you can't look in the eye, joan?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{he's not just a dog. he's a schutzhund trained attack dog.}
<C>__{eddy}
<D>__{oh...}
<A>__{he steps back from the dog as joan leans down to give duke some water from the cup.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i was told to avoid a direct gaze and always look at the base of the right or the left ear.}
<C>__{eddy}
<D>__{you don't have to go to all this trouble, i've offered to stay up at your sister's with you?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i can't tell you how mad i am at lewie, that i have to leave him out here, tied to a tree...}
<C>__{eddy}
<D>__{god, you're stubborn, joan.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i'm not stubborn, i'm so accommodating, it's sickening.}
<A>__{she pats duke on the head and stands up:}
<C>__{eddy}
<D>__{but you won't tell me what's really bothering you. why don't you confide in me anymore?}

<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i don't know. let's say maybe.}
<C>__{eddy}
<P>__{(slightly annoyed)}
<D>__{well don't go out of your way, joan.}
<A>__{he moves quickly toward the rehearsal room. immediately afraid of his displeasure, she calls after him:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{eddy? tomorrow's fine. okay?}
<A>__{before disappearing into the studio, he makes a gesture acknowledging her capitulation. & &}
