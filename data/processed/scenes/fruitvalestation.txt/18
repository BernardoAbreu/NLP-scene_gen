<L>__{interior hallmark store day}
<A>__{the store is small and brightly lit. oscar is reading a card from off the birthday for mother rack. we see that on the card is a picture of a black woman walking on the beach holding her son's hand. inscribed over it are the words to the religious poem "footsteps" by anonymous. oscar's eyes quickly scan the poem: he's read it before. oscar opens the card, and looks inside for a beat. he looks up, moved by the words. he stares off into space.}
