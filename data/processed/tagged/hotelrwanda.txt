<A>__{a rundown (sixties) airport, peeling in the heat. a mad traffic jam of cars, vans, motorbikes all stopped at a checkpoint where a rwandan policeman blows his whistle, waves some and stops others as bored rwandan soldiers look on. close on: a white van pulls out of traffic, a balls out case of line jumping. horns, obscenities. a hand: extends from the passenger side of the van, rwandan francs pressed neatly between thumb and palm. the van stops next to the policeman.}
<C>__{policeman}
<D>__{mr. rusesabagina, good morning.}
<A>__{in the passenger seat paul rusesabagina, late 30's, flashes a smile. he is dressed in a sharp blue suit (always dressed in a neat suit and tie, it is a matter of pride). a quick shake of hands. money passes from one to the other.}
<L>__{exterior kigali airport tarmac. day}
<A>__{the van parked by the runway tarmac. african music plays on the radio. paul drums his fingers, checks his watch. zozo, porter driver, early thirties, sits nervously. an airport baggage handler approaches the van.}
<C>__{handler}
<D>__{sir, the flight is delayed one more hour.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{thank you.}
<P>__{(to zozo)}

<C>__{zozo}
<D>__{what is it like to fly on a plane, sir?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it depends where you sit zozo. in coach it is like the bus to giterama.}
<C>__{zozo}
<D>__{that is why they call it coach?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{maybe. but in business class there are fine wines, linens, belgian chocolates.}
<C>__{zozo}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{you have taken business class?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{many times.}
<A>__{suddenly, zozo slows. paul looks up, sees: a gathering on the side of the road a large crowd of men dressed in exotically, yet identically colored shirts. they're members of the interahamwe the hutu militia. (interahamwe the hutu militia will de distinguished by these wildly colored shirts) they chant, drink beer, dance onto the road, obstructing cars, threatening the occupants. several of them perform a rhythmic dance the interahamwe war dance to thumping drumbeat music from a boombox.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{turn off.}
<A>__{zozo, scared, looks for a side road, studies the traffic behind.}
<C>__{zozo}
<D>__{there is nowhere to turn, sir.}

<C>__{paul}
<D>__{slow down.}
<A>__{the van pulls up beside the militia.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{boys, do you know the way to mr. rutagunda's warehouse?}
<A>__{some militia approach. they are suddenly friendly, helpful.}
<D>__{militia man #1 it is one more mile on this road.}
<A>__{paul reaches into his pocket, takes out some rwandan dollars.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{this is thirsty work, let me treat you to some beers.}

<A>__{at his desk in front of a fan. george rutagunda, late 30's, huge, gold chains, rolex watch, (like an african mafia boss) but the same interahamwe shirt. he squeezes an orange rind into a cup of espresso. behind him, through his office window, the white van is being loaded with cases of beer. george holds out his massive shirt.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you will join us at the rally today?}
<A>__{paul sits opposite, sipping coffee.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i will try my best george but these days i have no time for rallies or politics.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{politics is power, paul. and money.}
<A>__{paul studies his watch.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{time is money, george. we need extra beer today.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{business is good at the hotel?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{very good.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i am always glad to see you paul.}
<A>__{george leads paul out into the warehouse. as a forklift lifts a wooden crate, george angers.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{hell man, that is not beer, put it back!}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{but, sir, the carlsberg is behind...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{forget the carlsberg, give him grolsch.}
<P>__{(to paul)}
<D>__{i won't charge extra.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{the driver of the forklift, anxiously, spins the machine to return the crate but it slides off and crashes onto the floor: machetes, hundreds of them, spill out. an awkward moment then george picks one of the crude blades.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{a bargain buy, from china. ten cents each, i will get a dollar.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{at least.}

<L>__{interahamwe war dance, in wild hypnotic sync, many wave sticks, spears,}
<A>__{wooden imitation guns. a large banner reads, "hutu power." a flatbed truck, speakers blare drumbeat music. on it george rutagunda dances the dance and waves a machete to the crowd. zozo sinks down behind the wheel.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{sit up, smile, zozo, don't attract attention to yourself.}
<C>__{zozo}
<D>__{boss, some of those men are my neighbors, they know i'm tutsi.}
<A>__{the parade passes. as they wait paul takes out the wad of notes george gave him, peels off a few dollars.}

<D>__{here, zozo, for your trouble.}
<A>__{zozo takes it.}
<L>__{exterior hotel entrance. day}
<A>__{the van turns off the street into the milles collines hotel driveway and honks twice as it pulls down a short drive lined with tall shrubs. an armed guard rushes from his booth and lifts the gate. perfectly timed. the van doesn't even have to slow as it passes. a sign on the guard house reads "welcome to the hotel mille collines".}

<L>__{exterior paul's house. night}
<A>__{paul, tatiana, are by thomas's car. they say good night to their guests. anais and carine sleep in the car. paul nods to the old guard to go open the gate. just then roger emerges from the thicket, wide eyed, afraid.}

<D>__{there are soldiers.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{on the street.}
<A>__{paul nods to tatiana to take roger inside. thomas and fedens grab the sleeping twins from their car. paul goes to his big metal gates and peers through the two inch gap}

<L>__{exterior victor's house. night.}
<A>__{he sees: (two houses down) the group of hutu soldiers, clustered around jeeps, they whisper and pointerior it's a raid. now they move rushing out of view. the sounds of splintering wood, glass breaking, children's cries, women}

<A>__{suddenly there's a face, beside paul's. it's tatiana.}
<C>__{tatiana}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{she looks, sees the soldiers, as they drag a middle aged man onto the street. he is crying, pleading, like a whipped dog.}
<C>__{tatiana }
<D>__{oh, my god, it's victor. why do they want victor?}
<A>__{they watch as victor is beaten to the jeep. at this point victor looses it completely, stops pleading, grabs on to a soldier, clinging, screaming like a terrified child like a man who knows he is going to die. it's a horror.}
<C>__{tatiana }
<D>__{do something.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tatiana}

<D>__{i couldn't help.}
<C>__{tatiana}
<D>__{you could have asked for a favor.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no, i could not. what do you know about favors tatiana, about barter and deals? all day long i work to please this officer, that diplomat, this tourist. to store up favors so that if there is a time when my family need help i have powerful people i can call upon. now you would have me waste a precious favor on a stranger.}
<C>__{tatiana}
<D>__{victor was not a stranger, he was our neighbor.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{he was not family. family is all that matters. do you think if you or i were being dragged from here, any one of them would lift a finger to help us?}
<C>__{tatiana}
<D>__{they do not have your connections.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{connections? i have no connections, only favors. if i call to help victor, a general will think "paul rusesabagina is a fool. he thinks my favors are so numerous and so insignificant as to waste them on everybody." then my hard work is doubly squandered. i insult the general and i do not get to use my favor at all. please leave these things to my good judgment.}

<D>__{i understand general, but when i last talked to the president of sabena he promised me that anyone who helped protect belgian property would be rewarded.}
