<L>__{exterior railway track}
<A>__{one two has ended up on a railway track. he turns back, why should chechnyan 2 chase him, he hasn't got the money. but no, chechnyan 2 is over the fence, bullet proof vest flapping in the wind, and coming after him. one two finds his strength this is his world, the world of the runner he's off down the tracks. the pair of them are bleeding profusely, they're bashed to a pulp, but they have still got a running sprit. the run goes on and on. chechnyan 2 has ripped off his jacket, we can see his massive scar covered torso dripping in blood and sweat, he seems unstoppable. one two gets confident and starts to run backwards egging chechnyan 2 on, chechnyan 2 is a good runner, but not good enough. deep hate fills his eyes as one two makes a fool out of him, chechnyan 2 will remember this man. one two is taking complete liberties, he almost stops and waits until chechnyan 2 has caught up to him and then he tears off, the chechnyan keeps coming. one two see's in the distance a tiny moped approaching from a distance, its chechnyan 1 who completely out sizes the machine. however, he's moving and it's moving faster than one two. one two ducks off the tracks and over a wall, the moped gets nearer. at least when he gets over the wall, the moped won't follow right? one two's over. he can hear the moped on the other side, one two looks over his shoulder he can see the moped being lifted over the wall. "oh shit." this is where one two's "zone" comes into play. he drifts in to a place that he can not be disturbed and he runs and runs and runs. up, down, through and in.}
