<L>__{interior nancy's cellar night}
<A>__{marge drags nancy headlong down the cellar stairs and across the room with a crazy fury, twisting her down near the foundation. and she thrusts her face so close to her daughter's that nancy reels from the alcohol.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{you want to know who fred krueger was? he was a filthy child killer who got at least twenty kids, kids from our area, kids we all knew. it drove us all crazy when we didn't know who was doing it but it was even worse when they caught him.}
<A>__{marge draws herself up with a shake.}
<C>__{marge }
<D>__{oh lawyers got fat and the judge got famous, but someone forgot to sign the search warrant in the right place, and fred krueger was free, just like that.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{so he's alive?}
<A>__{marge smiles grimly.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{he wouldn've stopped. the bastard would've got more kids first chance he got they found nearly ten bodies in his boiler room as it was. but the law couldn't touch him.}
<A>__{at the mention of "boiler room", nancy gives a shake. marge misses this, too busy taking a pull on the bottle that's never left her hand.}
<C>__{marge }
<D>__{what was needed were some private citizens willing to do what had to be done .}
<A>__{she reels slowly, looking at nancy is defiance.}
<C>__{nancy}
<P>__{(hushed)}
<D>__{what did you do, mother?}
<A>__{marge cradles the bottle.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{bunch of us parents tracked him down after they let him go. found him in an old boiler room, just like before. saw him lying there in that caked red and yellow sweater he always wore, drunk an' asleep with his weird knives by his side...}
<C>__{nancy}
<P>__{(dreading it)}
<D>__{go on...}
<A>__{marge reaches over and taps a dusty two gallon jug of gasoline near the lawn mower.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{we poured gasoline all around the place, left a trail out the door, locked the door, then...}
<A>__{she mimes striking a match }
<C>__{marge }
<D>__{whoosh!!!}
<A>__{her arms shoot up and her eyes go wide with the light of that fire. there's awe in her voice. then she drops her arms.}
<C>__{marge }
<P>__{(hushed, remembering)}
<D>__{but just when it seemed not even the devil could live in there any more he crashed out like a banshee, all on fire swinging those fingerknives every which direction and screaming he... he was going to get us by killing all our kids...}
<A>__{she stops with a sudden quake and drinks for a long moment. but the intake doesn't hide the image. her face bathed in tears, she looks at her daughter and shakes her head.}
<C>__{marge }
<D>__{there were all those men, nancy, even your father, oh yes, even him. but none could do what had to be done krueger rolling and screaming so loud the whole state could hear no one could take your father's gun and kill him good and proper except me .}
<A>__{she sweeps her hand across the air in a terrific slash, then stops, her hand shaking, her voice hoarse and terrified. she looks at her daughter, begging.}
<C>__{marge }
<D>__{so he's dead nan. he can't get you. mommy killed him.}
<A>__{for someone who started this film at a very young seventeen, nancy's now the battle tempered veteran as she takes her mother in her arms and rocks her.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{who was there? were tina's parents there? were rod's?}
<A>__{marge sags back.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{sure, and glen's. all of us. but that's in the past now, baby. really. it's over.}
<P>__{(slyly)}
<D>__{we even took his knives.}
<A>__{the woman twists around and opens the door on an old furnace a furnace unused since the newer gas one nearby was put in. she fishes inside the cavity as then we hear a touch of the familiar 'scrriitch'. next moment she pulls out an object wrapped in rags, opens it and displays the long, rusted blades and their glove like apparatus.}
<C>__{marge }
<D>__{see?}
<A>__{nancy stares at the damn things, chilled.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{all these years you've kept those things buried down here? in our own house?}
<C>__{marge }
<D>__{proof he's declawed. as for him, we buried him good and deep.}
<A>__{marge shoves the knives into their hiding place, closes the little iron door.}
<C>__{marge }
<D>__{so's okay, you can sleep.}
<A>__{she lurches up and staggers upstairs. nancy shivers and looks down at her arm. the cut beneath her bandage has begun to bleed again. and from inside the furnace, as if from deep below, the pulsing of the boundless nightmare boiler room can be faintly heard.}
