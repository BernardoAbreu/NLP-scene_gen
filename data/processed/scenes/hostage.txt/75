<L>__{interior thomas' room night}
<A>__{mars shoves thomas into the room, then lifts the claw hammer. for an instant, we think he's going to hit the boy but he smashes off the door knob, instead. mars glares at thomas, then pulls the door closed. the knob on thomas's side is gone; there's no way for thomas to open the door. but that's okay by thomas. he waits until he's sure that mars is gone, and then he hurries back to his closet }
