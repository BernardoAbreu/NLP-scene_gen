<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i don't want to have to sneak around in my own house.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{well, i don't think telling her is such a hot idea.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i mean, i don't want to live under the same roof with her.}
<T>__{close on:}
<B>__{a few rain drops hitting the roof of the car.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{you can't leave, she'll get half.}
<A>__{martin exhales, knowing she's right.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{can i ask how the hell you married her without a pre nup? her?}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{she wasn't as bad an actress as you think.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{well, there is another option.}
<A>__{the rain picks up, plink, plunking on the roof.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{there is?}
<A>__{her eyes harden as she looks out at the city.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{but it will take some planning... and some resolve.}
<A>__{martin's eyes suddenly widen.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{wait, you don't mean }
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{kill her?}

<C>__{mini}
<D>__{no, of course not, she is my mother.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{good...}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{but i've been thinking, if she suddenly got ill }
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{ill?}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{unstable, unpredictable, irrational...dangerous to the safety of her husband...her child...she would have to be sent someplace where they could give her the care she needs.}
<A>__{martin searches her eyes, almost unsure he's heard her right. her gaze is unwavering and after a few seconds he realizes she's serious. he can't help but let the hint of a grin cross his lips. m}
<C>__{artin}
<D>__{it would be for her own good.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{the only truly caring action we could take.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{as painful as it would be for me to be without my loving wife.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{you did it for the well being of your daughter. the selfless act of a devoted parent.}
<A>__{the sexual tension arises between them, as he starts moving closer to her lips.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{of course, we'll have to make sure her episodes are well documented.}
<A>__{she responds in kind, tilting her head.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{and corroborated by friends and people outside the family.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{a public complaint by a neighbor wouldn't hurt.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{no, that would be useful.}
<A>__{their lips are now almost touching.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{and we'll find her a very comfortable place out in the country.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{with lots of fresh air.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{it will be a much better life for her.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{much.}
<A>__{unable to stand it, their lips meet and they start to hungrily tear at each other's clothes.}
