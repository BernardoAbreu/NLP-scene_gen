<L>__{interior darwin's study night}
<A>__{darwin comes in, empties the bag into a black box with perforations and closes the lid}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{he knew his wife wouldn't care for this creature so when he came home he locked it in a box, where it couldn't run around and do any damage.}
<L>__{interior darwin's study. day}
<A>__{darwin works at his desk. there's a plaintive cooing sound coming from the box next to his feet.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{but every so often he'd open the lid and feed it, just because he couldn't bear to let it die.}
<A>__{finally he opens the lid and offers the creature a biscuit. it has grown a bit larger and made itself a nest. it takes the biscuit and peeps gratefully.}
