<L>__{exterior hancock tower, chicago late night}
<A>__{lake shore drive. four o'clock in the morning. minimal traffic, minimal life. as main titles begin, we pan up the face of... ...hancock tower. up, up, forty floors, sixty, eighty, very dark up here, street sounds fading fast, and as credits continue we can just make out... ...a dark figure. like a spider. inching its way up the steel surface of the 98th floor, and we close to see... the thief. all in black, nearly invisible, with a sleek visored helmet that conceals the face. two long, oblong backpacks, climb ing ropes and harness across back and shoulders, tools at the belt. moving straight up the face of the skyscraper. how is it possible? closer still to see... ...the piton like bolts are electromagnetic, clanking to the steel to support weight. a button releases the magnetic charge when the bolt is pulled up by cords to a higher position. the thief is remarkably strong and agile, scaling the wall with fluid precision, until... ...our summit. a softly lit, glass walled penthouse on the}
<L>__{100th floor. subtle spots which bathe paintings, sculptures,}
<A>__{in a cavernous coldly decorated space. swiftly, deftly, the thief rigs a suction mounted harness to the steel casing above a massive window. pulleys, metal caribiner clips, yellow kevlar ropes. so superbly practiced, the rigging is placed in seconds, huge suction cups pressed to the surface of the glass. the thief reaches to a metal rectangle at the top of the rigging, touches a button, a motor whines, the ropes tighten and the window... ...pops free, hangs suspended by the kevlar ropes which amazingly sustain its awesome weight. the huge pane shudders in the wind, and the thief slips... ...into the penthouse. nearby, an alarm box softly beeps its}
<L>__{60 second warning to the pulsing of a green light, and the thief}
<A>__{attaches a small computerized device which runs a series of possible codes at dazzling speed on its display panel, until... ...the right one stops. illuminated in red. the beeping, the green light, go off. the device is removed. back to the window, air rushing in, attach a similar suction mounted harness from the inside, all exquisitely engineered to rig in seconds, press new suction cups to the inside of the dangling window pane. a small remote control clicker... ...releases the outside suction cups. the window's weight now supported by the interior rigging. the outside equipment pulled}
<L>__{into the apartment in a single tug. the whine of a motor, and the}
<A>__{pane pulls up, the thief expertly popping it into place. no trace of entry. rapidly folding the rigging into an astonishingly compact bundle, the thief scans... ...the profusion of priceless art. the paintings run to otto dix, franz marc, marcel duchamp. one statue an obvious rodin. the soft lighting makes walls seem invisible, everything with an infinity perspective in mind. an obsidian slab dining table that seems to end at the horizon. the thief has packed the rigging away, taken out a large cylin drical tube bearing a label we can't read. knows the way, quickly through the spectacular apartment, past oils by early german expressionists, russian futurists, a rothko, a kandinsky, a francis bacon. the thief has no interest in these, and as credits continue, we enter... ...a powder room. a lime green poured concrete sink, a copper plated commode, and across from these... ...a single painting. unlike the others, clearly an old master. a 17th century city on the water, churches, spires, an ancient bridge. the thief wastes no time, unceremoniously... ...cuts the painting from its frame with sure, perfect strokes. rolls it quickly in acid free paper. opens the cylindrical tube, pulling out... ...another canvas which we cannot see. deftly unrolls this, fitting it carefully into the stolen painting's now empty frame. re hangs it. stares for a beat through the opaque helmet visor. approves. slips the rolled up stolen canvas into the empty tube. leaves. before we follow, we shift angle to see the replacement canvas... a cheerful acrylic portrait. bozo the clown. with the thief now, moving fast, into a panelled library. there is a chute built into the wall, a brass lid with the words u.s. mail. the thief pops the labeled tube down the chute. gone. steps... ...onto a bookshelf, reaches up to punch out an overhead grating, and... disappears into the vent. reaching back to refit the grating seamlessly into place.}
<L>__{interior vent}
<A>__{halogen flashlight leading the way, our thief shimmies down the narrow space, arriving at... ...an open vertical air shaft, blasting air straight up the 100 floor height of the skyscraper, with frightening force. calmly, the thief clips on a different harness, unzips a nylon cover from the backpack, and simply... leaps down the air shaft, startling the shit out of us, as, for an instant... ...the force of the updraft seems to hold the thief in place, suspended above 100 stories of nothingness. then suddenly, the thief... ...drops sharply, an exhilarating moment of absolute free fall, until a cord is tugged and... ...a nylon parachute opens with a pop. we watch the thief drifting lazily down. a ride any kid would pay big money for...}
<L>__{exterior hancock tower late night}
<A>__{our original exterior view of the skyscraper's penthouse. reverse angle now to see in far distance... ...the dense forest of silhouetted office towers of downtown chicago against the night sky, and we zoom toward them, covering miles in three seconds, to close on... ...the highest floor of the sears tower, and through an unlit window to see... ...a telescope. a silhouetted figure looking through it. snap to... view through the scope's lens. an amazingly close detail of the hancock tower penthouse. the scope now pans down the length of the tower, to... the street. the thief climbing onto a battered old lambretta. calm as you please. and as the scooter glides off... we hear our unseen voyeur walk away from our telescope. a door opens somewhere, and as credits conclude, it... closes. softly.}
<L>__{interior webber assurance day}
<A>__{a basement corridor. long, bare, dimly lit. silent. we're in the bowels of somewhere. a startling clank, like a prison cell unlocking. a figure enters the corridor, coming this way, on the hurried side of brisk. hector cruz is 42, tanned, fit, graying hair swept back in a pat riley do. he wears riley's armani, too. maybe this guy coaches. heels echo until he reaches a plain door with discreet lettering... no admittance for any reason. there is a dull silver rectangle below the words. he holds his hand up to it... nothing happens. shit. dries his palm on his perfectly creased slacks. one more time. click. enters...}
<L>__{interior situation room day}
<A>__{an unexpectedly vast semi circular room, the entire inner circum ference made up of a single continuous wall screen, separated into a seamless array of images... three dimensional rotating graphics of every room in the hancock tower penthouse, schematics of electrical, plumbing, and ventila tion systems. see through rotating multicolored models of every piece of security equipment imaginable, components flashing as performance simulations are run. rapid fire sequences of indiv idual human profiles, complete with photos and bio blurbs. screens flickering with blizzards of data, hurtling past at warp speed. the pentagon and cnn would kill for this room. the largest segment of screen, twenty feet square, runs a live feed from the crime scene. the living room of the penthouse, crawling with slow moving cops and technicians, doing their slow moving thing. surrounding this image are a dozen smaller screens, showing this and other rooms from a variety of camera angles. all live. we see the library, the mail chute. the powder room. bozo. cruz skips down three steps to floor level, nine separate control stations, each outfitted with super tech panels to process the avalanche of information. but today, all stations are empty. except one.}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{baker. you got it solved?}
<A>__{and now we see her. from the rear. slouched at her station. looks like a skinny teenager in tousled tawny hair, rumpled oversized workshirt, vintage jeans.}
<P>__{gin (o.s., from the rear)}
<D>__{actually. yeh.}
<A>__{not a kid's voice. throaty. music and whiskey and sex and effortless confidence. even the voice turns us on.}
<C>__{cruz }
<D>__{what took you so long, gin? i called 4:30 this morn...}
<A>__{and stops. because she turns with a look that would freeze anyone to stone.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i was with someone, all right?}
<A>__{now we really see her. delicate bones and features, slender body, radiating the power of a natural heart stopping beauty. ginger baker is 32, ethereal and feral at once. electric green eyes crackle with an intellect and a will that are not to be fucked with.}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{so? this is work.}
<A>__{he is not kidding. stainless steel beneath the dapper. they are a matched team.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{hector, i hardly know the guy. why be impolite to strangers?}
<A>__{and he smiles. maybe she's lying. he likes her.}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{look at those assholes...}
<A>__{he means the cops on live feed.}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{if the vermeer were lying on that table, they'd toss their doughnuts on it.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{yeh, well, they didn't insure it, so they don't have to solve this. to them it's a crime. to us it's 24 mil, less re insurance, which is...}
<C>__{cruz }
<D>__{only thirty percent, gin.}
<A>__{ouch. really?}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{which is why you're on this.}
<A>__{soft and straight. you're the best. i need you.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{he came in through the window.}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{that's not possib...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{what's not possible is entry through the doors or the vents. that would have triggered instant alarm.}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{the windows are wired, too.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{only for trauma. they used smart glass, where the sensors respond to violation of the panel's integrity.}
<A>__{he's listening. he always does with her.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i think he scaled the wall, popped the frame. in one piece.}
<A>__{she sounds awfully positive. then again, she always does.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{then, he only had to deal with heat and motion sensors. they were on 60 second delay, so the owner wouldn't trigger the alarm just be walking arou...}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{the pane weighs 200 pounds, the building's 1100 feet high.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{this particular guy is the best. the best there ever was.}
<A>__{almost as if she knows who. cruz shakes his head...}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{popping the frame would trigger the alarm.}
<A>__{she smiles. first time. even at one tenth power, it is dazzling light. she touches the panel before her...}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{i wrote a program and ran it, dumbo.}
<A>__{the live feed is replaced by a red outlined rotating three dimensional diagram of the living room. the alarm box glows green. one window pane glows lavender. she touches the panel, and the window shatters, the alarm instantly emits a piercing screech. reset. as he watches. this time the window slides away into thin air. no sound. a stick figure appears, crawls through the opening, and the alarm begins the slow beep we heard last night. cruz just stares.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{here's how i figured it out...}
<A>__{live feed replaces the diagram. our camera zooms toward a vase of lilies by the window. all the flowers are tilted in one direction. over the lip of the vase, away from the window.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{no one arranges flowers like that. it was the draft from the window.}
<A>__{he turns to her.}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{you said. this particular guy.}
<A>__{now she is beaming. excited. and just above a whisper...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{andrew macdougal.}
<A>__{delighted at his stupefied reaction.}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{why not houdini? or pretty boy floyd? maybe jesus christ.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{because they couldn't do it.}
<A>__{his slow smile. this fucking kid.}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{he's been out of the business. for ten years .}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{maybe not. no one ever proved, hell, even arrested him, for stealing anything . but we all know he was numero ichiban for thirty years. why not forty?}
<A>__{she's serious.}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{why? because of the bozo switch? guys have been copying his pack rat signature for decades . maybe the thief wanted it to look like macdougal.}
<A>__{she doesn't even answer. just touches her panel, and one of the data screens blows up to huge size. it is...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{a list of his private collection. complete to three acquisitions last thursday.}
<A>__{names scrolling up endlessly, next to titles, descriptions, estimated retail and black market values. turner, corot, thomas coles, dekooning, klimt, cezannes, odilon redon, braques, mary cassatt...}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{no vermeer. nothing close.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{don't be a putz. this is his legitimate collection, which he buys . presentable for any search warrant surprise party.}
<A>__{names keep rolling, degas, paul klee. amazing.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{what he rips off, he fences. and the money feeds his portfolio of investments, which are daring, savvy, and obscenely succesf...}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{oh, i get it. he has no interest in vermeers, so that proves he stole one. by that logic, he oughta be a suspect most of the time.}
<A>__{she shakes her head, sadly.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{you love to embarrass yourself.}
<A>__{touches her panel. the big screen now shows a grainy videotape of...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{the auction. where our client bought the painting...}
<A>__{we see the great room of an english country estate. perhaps a hundred attend. genteel to the max.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{ashcroft hall, buckinghamshire, four weeks ago.}
<A>__{the tape pans five paintings on the block. we recognize our vermeer, the city of delft, the canal, the bridge. the view pulls back to include the crowd, and... freezes. one tiny section is circled. and blows up twenty feet. high, so blurry as to be unrecognizable. then, snaps to amazing resolution. the image of...}
<P>__{gin (o.s., murmur)}
<D>__{anyone we know?}
<A>__{...andrew macdougal, perhaps 60, as charismatic and shamelessly virile a face as one can recall. etched with character and worldly experience, lit by a twinkle behind the razor keen gaze. tall, wide shoulders, massive hands. this guy would be more fun to fuck than fight. by a lot.}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{so he was there.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{staking it out. why bid, when you can mark the buyer, and jack it within the month?}
<A>__{she leans way back in the molded chair. lifts her long legs up onto the console. they end in slender bare feet. the toes wriggle.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{at this moment, he is winging on jal flight 307 to narita, ostensibly to attend a prestigious auction at the hotel akura, which will include a mixed media collage oil by georges braques, on which he supposedly has his eye.}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{but you know better.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{bet your ass. at vegas odds.}
<A>__{touches the panel. the big screen now holds three faces, three names.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{research reveals three known fences, still at large, who are believed to have brokered vermeers to black market buyers. sandrine palmer is hospitalized in malta with ovarian cancer.}
<A>__{one face and name disappears. two remain. koichi naruhito.}
<B>__{hiroyuki yamaji.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{the other two. live in tokyo.}
<A>__{a tiny, dry, adorable, shrug. which says, bingo.}
<C>__{cruz}
<D>__{and you did all this since 4:30 this morning.}
<A>__{grinning small at each other. she can't help that hers is hot. she never can.}
<C>__{cruz }
<D>__{plus. you were polite to a stranger.}
<A>__{one of those moments when his attraction to her is too obvious to ignore. best to defuse by pretending it's a joke...}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{sounds like you're sorry you're already a friend.}
<A>__{said as banter between pals. which doesn't make her wrong.}
<L>__{interior hotel okura, tokyo night}
<A>__{auction in progress in the huge traditional lobby, where bonsai trees, paper lanterns and elaborate painted screens counterpoint the sleek, international, big money crowd. everyone milling, drinking, schmoozing, networking in a babble of languages, as up on the raised platform... ...the auctioneer has a new piece on the block, a 6th century temple scroll, from the asuka period. it is exquisite, and bidding seems to be big time, from the rapidly escalating numbers on the overhead digital display, which reveals bidding status in thirty currencies simultaneously. as we pan the hall, we see... ...all non asians either wearing headphones, or acompanied by personal translators at their elbow, to follow the rapid fire auctioneer. except one. andrew macdougal stands alone in black tie. tall and rugged and polished and focused, and, well, pretty gorgeous. he is bidding on the scroll, indicated only by subtle gestures with his program and the repeated finger stabs of the auctioneer in our direction.}
<P>__{woman's voice (o.s., subtitled japanese)}
<D>__{don't do it.}
<A>__{pull back slightly to reveal gin, who has stepped to his shoulder. she is barely recognizable to us in her satiny slip of a pale golden gown that drapes her frame perfectly. breathtaking would be an insult. macdougal doesn't turn, doesn't seem to even hear her. just raises his program to up the bid.}
<P>__{gin (softly, subtitled japanese)}
<D>__{you're already over value. by 15 percent.}
<A>__{and now he turns. straight to her eyes. this is not an admiring glance at seeing the loveliest woman in the northern hemisphere. it is a look that says, in the most understated terms, shut up or i will kill you. she shuts up. his glance goes to his obvious bidding rival, a rather butch middle aged chinese woman in an embroidered version of a mao suit. she indicates her bid by gesturing with a tiny yorkshire terrier, whom she holds in her stubby hands. macdougal raises back.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{will you stop being stubborn for one sec...}
<A>__{and stops. because he has turned. with the eyes of a lion. being pulled from an antelope carcass.}
<P>__{mac (quietly, subtitled japanese)}
<D>__{i have a question.}
<A>__{rich scottish voice. impeccable japanese intonation.}
<P>__{gin (brightly, subtitled japanese)}
<D>__{who the fuck am i?}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{that is of no interest.}
<A>__{oh. in spite of herself, she looks a little hurt.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{what, then?}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{why. are we speaking. japanese?}
<A>__{her eyes move across his formidable face.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{uh. i'm showing off.}
<A>__{his eyes scan the length of her gown. her body.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{something of a habit?}
<A>__{she is minus a comeback.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you know the alleged value of this piece from some fucking computer , which has no clue of the price i can turn the scroll around for in 30 minutes .}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{no, you can't.}
<A>__{he blinks. no?}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{it's sold.}
<A>__{his great head whips around to see madame mao kissing her pooch, flushed with victory. he stares for a long moment, a veneer of philosophical almost masking his rage. when he turns back...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{are you a confederate of my adversaries? or are you just stupid.}
<A>__{and walks. away. hold on her. feeling like both.}
<L>__{exterior hotel okura night}
<A>__{mac among the guests awaiting their cars, standing slightly apart. from behind him... ...a feminine throat clears. nervously. he closes his eyes for a beat. then, turns.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{how about. if i try humility.}
<A>__{and presents a business card to him with both hands, japanese style. mac looks in her eyes. takes the card with both hands. reads...}

<D>__{virginia romay...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{gin, actually, gin romay. i was named after a card game.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{or a cheap cocktail.}
<A>__{she blinks. his brows raise...}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{as in. i will have a gin romay, please. with a twist.}
<A>__{that laser, unsmiling stare. beyond sexy. she gets lost in it for a beat.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{you're supposed to be charming.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i'm supposed to be selective.}
<A>__{glances back to her card. reads...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{art and antiquities acquisition advisor, how alliterative...}
<A>__{looks up. still no smile.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{and am i the antiquity?}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{in mint condition.}
<A>__{she sighs. achingly lovely.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{look, i've studied you, i know... pretty much...everything.}
<A>__{do you.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{made your first millions selling scrap metal. then, gold mining concessions, gems, art, and lately strategic metals for new technologies platinum, zirconium, titanium...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you said. everything.}
<A>__{huh? oh.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{the cat burglar stories? why would anyone...with so much to lose...take those kinds of risks?}
<A>__{guileless smile.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{you'd have to be. stupid.}
<A>__{a held beat. his glance lifts beyond her shoulder.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{and walks off toward a sleek custom touring car just pulling up. she goes after him.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i didn't know porsche made things like this.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{well, they don't...}
<A>__{tipping the valet. sliding in...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{...as a rule.}
<A>__{shutting the door. through the open window, she hands something from her bag. a plastic rectangle which opens into a slide viewer. she presses the light on. he looks at the slide.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{recognize that?}
<A>__{no reaction.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{my seller is in shinjuku, we can go there tonight.}

<C>__{mac }
<D>__{...only it's not bloody football !}
<A>__{snap to mac's table, well across the room. drinking giant beers with a large, really fat japanese guy in a costly; if wrinkled, suit. the hulk listens with stone attention to mac's rant, as if he actually gave a shit.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{...it's just that crap americans call 'football', like you could call your ass a butterscotch scone and have it be one!}
<A>__{the guy nods seriously. maybe he's a sumo dude.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{why you'd want to bring that foolishness to japan , you're just pissing your investment down a bungee hole.}
<C>__{sumo guy }
<D>__{you got cubano this trip?}
<A>__{that he does. mac pulls out a leather cigar holder, and passes it over. flat against one side is an envelope, which sumo guy palms skillfully, slipping it seamlessly into his pocket as he withdraws a small match box. takes out one long cigar, lights up...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{seriously, put the money into pharmaceuticals or prostitution, something stable .}
<A>__{the big guy pushes the cigar holder and match box back toward mac. opening the box, mac sees one match and a small microchip fastened to the cardboard. lights up. slides the match box in his pocket.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{garbage, perhaps. or industrial plastics.}
<A>__{angle...gin still engrossed in her reading. a figure leans down next to her. she startles, slightly. so surprised to see...}

<A>__{she gives him the great smile.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i'm staying here, what's your excuse?}

<C>__{gin }
<D>__{one thirty eight.}
<A>__{in one motion, he flags the bartender...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{will you send a half bottle of chateau d'yquem '67 to room 138, please? and some berries and chocolates for the lady to enjoy it with.}
<A>__{he presses some currency into the barkeep's hand. turning back...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{actually, i was just across the room, dickering with a gentleman over the purchase of an interesting spitzweg. until i determined the painting was apparently stolen...}
<A>__{oh. she's shocked. he agrees...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{goes against my grain. the dekooning in your slide, the 4.6 million you can get for 3. can you get it for 2 and a half?}
<A>__{she looks in his eyes.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{and as if he believed her...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{my checkbook is in my safe. you wait here.}

<A>__{mac driving in silence. gin stealing glances at him. suddenly and smoothly, he reaches down, and picks up...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{that's my purse.}
<A>__{he opens it. one eye on the road, he begins to rummage...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{just want to see if i'm with the person you say you are. can't be too caref...}
<A>__{she snatches the bag away from him, he grabs it back, the car swerves left, and... ...crashes violently into a parked pure white bentley. metal buckles and tears, both alarms go off, a cacophony of horrific}
<B>__{noise.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{oh, dear.}
<A>__{people come running, but our focus is drawn to the refined elderly couple who were just returning to their precious bentley. their wails and anguish would be suitable if all their grandchildren had been crushed beneath mac's wheels. mac and gin are out of the car. as he exits, mac has palmed a small blade, and in a quick unseen motion, ripped a jagged tear in his left trouser leg. the old couple rush to mac, shrieking their rage and grief in japanese, gin is trying to calm them as bystanders gather, but mac cuts through...}

<C>__{mac }
<D>__{so. our train runs from the museum, through an underground tunnel. to a mountain.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{because the museum displays 10,000 relics at any given moment. but there are 60 times that many, stored in the mountain.}

<A>__{clicks the mouse, and the british terminal time begins flashing.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{we'll let the brits go off line 4 seconds early.}
<A>__{as the flashing clock reaches 11:58:30, and mac hits the key four times, advancing the british clock to 34 seconds, four seconds later than the others.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{and we'll give our new chinese overlords 4 extra seconds of rest before they have to go on line.}
<A>__{as the local and chinese clocks reach 40 seconds, mac hits the key four times, regressing the chinese clock back to 36 seconds. we watch all three clocks, clicking down the last moments of british rule. the british clock is 4 seconds fast, the chinese clock 4 seconds slow.}
<C>__{mac}

<C>__{gin}
<D>__{what a guy.}
<A>__{but just as she's about to bolt...he holds up one hand. slips another cd from his pocket. we see the words kenny g.}

<L>__{interior corridor}
<A>__{mac and gin running full tilt through the siren blare, turning a corner to see ahead... ...the balcony railing, the building's empty central core. mac bolts straight toward it, gin sprinting to follow, lungs pounding, they reach the railing, looking down to see... hysteria, unimaginable chaos. soldiers, black tie partygoers, scrambling in all directions, looking to his left mac sees... ...the bank of elevators, soldiers pouring in, some cars already rising, fourth floor, fifth. now he looks directly below, where... ...soldiers are pounding up the metal service staircase, the front rank almost at the third floor. in the lobby, some faces look up to see us, but no one is shooting.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{they don't know we're the bad guys.}
<A>__{he plunges his hand into her shoulder bag...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{time they find out.}
<A>__{pulls out two plasma grenades, and flings one toward the elevator cables three floors down and it... ...explodes in a horrifying fireball, causing pandemonium in the lobby below, the elevator cables blown away, cars plunging, the yellow smoke momentarily screening us from the soldiers far below, and mac hurls the second grenade... ...straight down and the fireball wipes out the staircase, a huge section of ninth floor landing raining down on the lobby.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{okay. how do we get down?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{down? i never liked down.}
<A>__{grabs her hand and they race to the staircase, as smoke billows everywhere below. up they go, two stairs at a time, the lowest glass and spiderweb steel canopy is three floors above us, the cacophany of shouts below is like an amplified insane asylum. he is dragging her now, up, up, bullets are flying blind through the smoke, chewing up metal and glass all around us, up, up, and as the smoke at last clears, they have reached... ...the canopy floor. they can see the army down below. clutching her hand, mac leads her over the railing, onto the canopy itself, and together they run... ...straight across the heavy glass toward the far side of the building, like space walking above the throng 150 feet below, bullets now tracing their path from beneath, slamming off the underside of the bulletproof canopy, gin shrieking with fright as they go. we see ahead... ...three executive elevators beginning to climb the far wall. these are glass enclosed tubes, all filled with soldiers, the car in the lead already at the tenth floor. mac keeps running straight toward them.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{we've got one more grenade!}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{save it for a rainy day!}
<A>__{they make it to the edge of the canopy, the lead elevator only two floors below them. we can see the soldiers through the glass. mac grasps her hand, and as the car nears our level...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you can do this.}
<A>__{they leap across five feet of open air to... ...land squarely on the car's metal roof, mac wrapping his free arm around the cable, and up we go. the ant colony below us receding fast. gin is hanging onto the cable, petrified. mac is looking up toward the roof.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{okay, now what?}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{shut up. you're on a 'need to know' basis.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{mac, i'm sorry.}
<A>__{he looks at her. just now, she seems more miserable than afraid.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{turns out, i'm a screw up.}
<A>__{he doesn't smile. passing the third canopy.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{well. something to be said for being self aware.}

<C>__{mac}
<D>__{may i have the last grenade, dear. it's about to rain.}
<A>__{she blinks. huh? so he reaches into her bag, pulls out the grenade, and throws it... ...straight up. the roof above them explodes in a fireball, and shields her body against the wall of their shaft, as a huge section of roof comes raining down. we watch as it... ...crashes through the upper canopy, tons of roof and glass plunging to... ...blast through the middle canopy, everyone below scrambling for shelter, as the whole shebang... ...explodes through the lowest canopy. gin can only gape at the incredible display. mouthing a silent wow. they've passed the second canopy, thirty sixth floor. still climbing. the other two elevators maybe five floors below us.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you see, banking will be more democratic under china.}
<A>__{she looks to him.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{well. no more glass ceiling.}
<A>__{the elevator car has stopped. we are at the roof. the soldiers are in the car beneath our feet, nowhere to get out. above our heads. ...the last few feet of elevator cable. and starry sky, where our patch of roof used to be.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{how refreshing. the night air.}
<A>__{he begins to shimmy up the few feet of cable. at the top, he reaches out with one hand toward the lip of the remaining roof, grabs it, lunges with his free hand, and... ...dangling 47 floors, he pulls himself up, swings onto the roof. reaches back down. she is only twelve feet below him. frozen with fear.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i can't do this.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you can. if i say so.}
<A>__{she stares up at his eyes. he smiles.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{if you stay. you'll have to pay for the damage...}
<A>__{she looks down at the mess below. and starts to climb the cable. not so easy in a ball gown, but the adrenaline is pumping. gets to the top. here's the hard part. one hand reaches out... ...grabs his. she lets go. and she is dangling in space.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{now that split. did we say 60 40?}
<A>__{and with all his strength, hauls her up onto... ...the roof. two thirds of it remain. at the far edge, a gigantic maintenance crane, itself two stories high. but between here and the crane... ...a helicopter. big and beautiful and empty. she looks like she's seen god. mac starts to jog toward it, she runs to follow but sees him go... ...straight past the chopper.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{he turns back. she points to the copter. it's over here.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{got the keys?}
<A>__{oh.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i thought you could...hot wire stuff?}
<A>__{guess not.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{they fix those things so you can't steal them...}
<A>__{and keeps walking. toward the monster crane.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{these, they're not so worried.}
<A>__{moving fast, he points off to his right. her eyes follow a long cable, leading from the arm of the crane, across the roof, attaching by a huge hook to a massive wrecking ball.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{go grab that hook.}
<A>__{he reaches the crane's cab. turns back to see she hasn't moved.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{let me rephrase that. run and grab that hook. or die ...}
<A>__{got it? she takes off running. he hops in the cab. pushes the start button. it rumbles to life. tests some levers...}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{shit! don't do that!}
<A>__{he turns to see that he's tightened the cable, pulling her ball six feet in the air. she clings to the hook with a true death grip. he lowers her ball to the roof. getting the hang of it.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{this only works if you shut your eyes.}
<A>__{which makes her eyes bug out.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{you're not gonna lower me over the side.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{of course not. now close baby eyes...}
<P>__{(she won't)}
<D>__{suit yourself.}
<A>__{he throws a lever and the crane's arm begins to swing in a circle, finally taking the ball with it, and as she screams, mac... ...pounces out of the cab, racing along the edge of the roof, not toward the ball which is sweeping the hysterical gin in a widening arc, but toward the point where he thinks the ball will clear the edge, and just as it does, he... ...leaps aboard, throwing one arm around the hook, the other around her, and they go... ...over the side, whooshing down in a gigantic, every increasing loop, as the endless steel cable unwinds from its huge drum like a fishing reel hooked onto a killer whale.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{oh noooooooooo....}
<A>__{the ride no theme park could insure, swooping out across the skyline, dropping like an anvil, as the cable unspools hundreds of feet, nothing but nothing for miles below them, gin grabbing a breath to shriek her guts out, as the monstrous pendulum reaches its max, begins to slow toward that one nauseating motionless instant...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{let go now!!}
<A>__{he yanks her loose, and they drop... ...four feet. the ball swings off lnto space to some unknown mayhem. clutching mac, gin looks way down to the street, and realizes they are standing on... ...a rooftop. quiet, safe. alone.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{planning.}
<A>__{she whips around, glaring death at his eyes.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{and dumb luck.}
<A>__{she collapses in his arms, every muscle trembling in spasm, sobbing...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{god, i hate you.}

<A>__{with gin in a soft brunette wig, walking briskly, light carry all across her shoulder. very early, even the busiest street in the world is less than that at this hour. up ahead... ...tsimshatsui station, a tall man with a tourist shopping bag, leaning casually against a pole. talking into a cellular. as she approaches, mac doesn't seem to notice, but she can now hear his conversation...}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{...if i can't have my usual suite, i will take my business to the bristol, simple as that.}
<A>__{he sees her now. smiles small.}
<C>__{mac }

<A>__{snaps the phone shut.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you ran your calls.}
<A>__{she did. she is frankly exhilarated.}
<D>__{gin all the transactions, all the transfers. it's a miracle.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{why? the cd erased the trans actions, all accounts seem in order. it looks like the thieves were stopped in time.}
<A>__{she sighs. it is a miracle.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{the colonel says police have nothing. a man in black tie, a blonde in a gown. the elevator guards saw faces, but no mug shots to id. i think it's over.}
<A>__{mac's smile. bittersweet affection.}

<D>__{except it never is, really. quite. over.}
<A>__{she smiles. it is easy, but dazzling. atypically soft.}

<D>__{well, one hopes not. the bristol, huh? in...paris?}
<A>__{ah.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you're not going back to mr. cruz, and the nine to five?}

<A>__{what the hell?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{let her keep the lot.}
<A>__{the train stops. the doors open. people come out, people go in. pouring around them. they are alone again. the subway doors stand open. two feet away. she looks at them...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{no rush. the doors won't close for 60 seconds.}
<A>__{sixty seconds. and still smiling...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{there's a pistol in the bag. reach in slowly. take it out fast. point it at my temple.}
<A>__{she freezes to stone.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you can do it. if i say you can.}
<A>__{and she...does it. a blinding move, the gun straight at his head, mac miming fear, raising his hands to chill the agents we... whip pan to see. half a dozen, everywhere, but none too close. they react, pull their weapons, but it's a stand off. back to... two people. alone in the universe.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{step onto the car, keep the pistol trained on my face.}
<A>__{she hesitates. does as he says. passengers are screaming, cringing, bolting for other cars. our world is frozen. his hands raised...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{seems i was wrong.}
<A>__{gentle smile.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{entrapment. is what robbers. do to cops, huh?}
<A>__{her eyes are flooding. the gun is trembling.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{twenty seconds. shoot me in the shoulder, it'll slow them down.}
<A>__{her pistol is shaking like she has palsy. tears are on her cheeks.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{oughta shoot you in the face.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{come on, you can do it, if i sa...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{no way. not anymore.}
<A>__{she sobs. she can't stand this.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{ten seconds, hold on.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{when do i see you?}
<A>__{there is no answer. there are no words. the doors hiss shut. she stares, training her pistol on him through the glass, his hands reaching back to hold off the agents, and the train... pulls away. an instant to pick up speed, and it roars into a tunnel. gone. mac stands motionless as all hell breaks loose around him, agents rushing to his side, mac shaking his head, calmly... still staring after the train.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{airport. changing at mongkok station, we can cut her off.}
<A>__{walkie talkies whip out. these guys are the same the world over. we begin to crane up...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{she might lose the wig, be looking brunette or blonde, navy pants suit...}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{i think yaumatei changes for the airport, and it's closer.}
<A>__{keep pulling up, an aerial view now, too high to see their faces...}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{i think you're wrong, but cover it. you got maybe four minutes.}
<A>__{higher still, the mob below an ant colony...}
<P>__{mac (o.s., calmly)}
<D>__{no problem. she's trapped.}
<A>__{but as the crowd parts. we can make out one lone man... staring after. what has gone.}
<T>__{fade to black:}
<B>__{. roll end credits.}
