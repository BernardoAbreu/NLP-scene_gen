<L>__{interior bar day}
<A>__{thin crowd of day time drinkers. earring walks in, moves to a booth where swan and beard are eating. earring pulls out a gallois (french) cigarette, lights up from a book of matches.}
<C>__{earring}
<D>__{they're holding her downtown.}
<C>__{swan}
<D>__{what about the cop?}
<A>__{earring shrugs.}
<C>__{beard}
<D>__{if you'd let me waste him.}
<C>__{earring}
<D>__{what if she talks?}
<C>__{swan}
<D>__{she won't.}
<C>__{beard}
<D>__{i say we split town. come back to this job when things cool. we've got other contracts denver, seattle...}
<A>__{swan slams his fist down, spilling food. no one in bar even looks up from their drink.}
<C>__{swan}
<D>__{i want her back and we do the job.}
<C>__{beard}
<D>__{i thought we agreed, the personal can't interfere with the professional.}
<C>__{earring}
<D>__{besides, we're on a schedule and the cops won't let her go.}
<C>__{swan}
<D>__{unless we make them.}
<C>__{earring}
<D>__{hey...}
<A>__{earring stares uneasily. swan and beard look up, freeze. a pair of patrol cops are heading directly towards them. earring reaches under his jacket... swan grabs earring's arm, calming him. the cops keep coming, then at the last moment, they veer left and slide into a booth. swan nods, they get up and casually slip outside.}
