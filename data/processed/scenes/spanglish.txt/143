<L>__{interior beach living room day}
<A>__{this is the last day of the summer rental many packed cartons on the floor. deborah, flor and cristina engaged in a momentous conversation..(note: throughout the following, and quite beside the point, we see flor periodically make the motion of throwing the ball. but we do not cut to chum, rather we just hear his claws skittering after the ball as we maintain focus on the momentous conversation.)}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{nuh uh, flor you are not pinning this one on me. i've got to finish packing up.}
<C>__{flor}
<P>__{(no longer sure of herself or anything)}
<D>__{i just don't....out of space this school wants her to go for free?}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{we ran into the school head. they want diversity...cristina knocked her out...i had nothing to do with it. by the way, the scholarship is worth twenty thousand dollars. and early registration is tomorrow.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{it is too far from our home.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{you could move in with us in town.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{never, thank you...}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{okay, then don't..by the way..the phrase is "no, thank you."}
