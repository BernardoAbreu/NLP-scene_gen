<D>__{charlie's in the fucking phone book. she has come to assume such an importance, i feel she should be living on mars. she's an extraterrestrial, a ghost, a myth, not a person with an answering machine, in the phone book... i call and hang up on her voice mail a couple of times, then i leave my name and number and throw in a "long time no see..." i don't hear anything back from her for a few days. now that's more like it, if you're talking about rejection: someone who won't even return your phone messages a decade after she rejected you.}
