<L>__{exterior beach house day}
<A>__{a savage wind sweeps in off the ocean. gulls wheel overhead.}
<B>__{forty foot yacht}
<A>__{is tethered to a wooden dock outside the beach house. milo and his crew prepare to cast off. meanwhile:}
<B>__{pablo}
<A>__{approaches along the dock, looking lean and mean in an izod shirt. he stops in front of sarah and joe hallenbeck. they are seated on the dock. each handcuffed to a metal railing. pablo kneels and unfastens joe's cuffs.}
<C>__{pablo}
<D>__{get up.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{go fuck yourself.}
<A>__{pablo delivers a savage kick to hallenbeck's ribs. hallenbeck gasps in pain.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{i meant that... in a good way...}
<A>__{pablo hauls him to his feet. props him against the railing.}
<C>__{pablo}
<D>__{time for a little payback, joe. call it a service to dear departed chet.}
<A>__{he slams a fist into hallenbeck's middle. sarah cries out in alarm.}
<C>__{pablo}
<D>__{how's that feel, fuckhead?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{i'm asshole... she's fuckhead.}
<A>__{and with that, pablo lets him have it. rains punches on his chest and gut. slams an elbow into his kidneys. drives a knee into his groin. joe hits the deck. milo calls out from the boat:}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{easy, pablo. i want him conscious.}
<A>__{pablo is kicking joe's prone form.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{goddamn you, stop it!! oh, jesus, leave him alone!}
<A>__{pablo gives joe a last swift kick. spits on him. hallenbeck vomits. lies bleeding on the dock. sarah crawls over to him. as far as the cuffs will allow. cradles his head in her lap.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{don't... look at me...}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{shhh. it's okay, joe. i'm here, it's okay.}
<P>__{(strokes his hair)}
<D>__{i love you, joe.}
<A>__{hallenbeck looks at her like she's just grown three heads.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{i get the shit beat out of me... puke all over myself... and now you love me?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i never stopped loving you, joe.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{christ, you slept with three guys.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{you knew about the others?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{i knew.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{you never said anything.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{figured... you needed them.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{joe, goddammit, why didn't you say something?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{like what? 'fuck you, sarah'?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{yes. fuck you, sarah! anything to show that you... that you had some pride left.}
<A>__{a pause. then hallenbeck heaves a sigh.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{sorry... i'm fresh out.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i'm scared, joe. get me out of this.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{must be my trick ear. sounded like you said, 'get me out of this.'}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{you can take these guys, joe.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{i've got cracked ribs and a concussion.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{save me, joe. be a hero.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{i don't believe in heroes.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{that's no excuse.}
<A>__{he stares up at her for a moment. then, through bloody lips:}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{fuck you, sarah...}
<A>__{and he smiles. just then, milo signals from the boat. seeing, this, pablo approaches the couple again.}
<C>__{pablo}
<D>__{all right, lovebirds, break it up.}
<A>__{he yanks sarah to her feet. lets his gaze roam up and down her body.}
<C>__{pablo}
<D>__{nice tits.}
<A>__{he rips open her blouse. roughly fondles her breasts. hallenbeck. on the ground. he growls with fury. starts to push himself up.}
<C>__{pablo}
<D>__{stay down, fucker. don't you move.}
<A>__{at that moment, milo comes striding down the dock. whistling cheerfully.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{careful, pablo. we don't want to get mrs. hallenbeck all excited in front of hubby.}
<A>__{he squats next to joe.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{hello, joseph, guess what? time to go, and remember: you follow orders, or the missus pays the price.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{you're gonna kill us both anyway.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{perhaps. but there are ways to die, and then there are... ways to die. capisce? you determine your wife's fate.}
<A>__{he yanks hallenbeck to his feet. propels him toward the boat. as her husband is being led away, sarah calls out:}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{joe...!}
<A>__{he stops. turns. looks at her. boys and girls, there is, within joe hallenbeck, a spark: tiny. fizzling. almost gone. but now, looking at his wife, that spark unexpectedly kindles and eight years melt away. just like that. the old joe hallenbeck looks his wife in the eye and says, with deadly calm:}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{i will be back.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that's a promise.}
<A>__{milo clubs joe in the head with his pistol.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{you're wasting my time, joseph. let's go.}
<A>__{hallenbeck turns. dirty. tired. unshaven. bloody. he looks at milo... and grins:}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{if you touch me again... i will kill you.}
<A>__{they stare into each other's eyes. hallenbeck does not give an inch. milo hits him again.}
