<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{the smell of chicken roasting reminds me of him.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you should have done beef, then. they look at each other and giggle. they both have potato peelers in their wet hands, sleeves rolled up, two practical unsentimental women being almost consumed by the same wave of emotion.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{it wouldn't be christmas without tears in the gravy, would it. we hear a gruff russian voice calling out from the living room (uncle stepan).}
<C>__{stepan }
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{anna! anna! where did you get this? anna and helen roll their eyes.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{it's your own fault for giving him something to play with.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{well, i can't read russian, can i? anna drops her peeler and hurries into the living room.}
