<L>__{exterior georgetown brownstone night}
<A>__{the house takes up most of one of the nicest blocks. people enter and party voices drift out. supertitle: georgetown, washington, d.c.}
<L>__{interior georgetown brownstone night}
<A>__{a power cocktail party in full swing. this is where most of the business in washington gets done. robert, scotch in hand, listens to a smug pharmaceutical lobbyist explain the world.}
<C>__{pharmaceutical lobbyist}
<D>__{we in the legal drug business, and i mean merck, pfizer, the rest of my very powerful clients, realize this isn't a war with a traditional winner and loser, but an organism at war with itself, whose weapons of mass destruction happen to be intoxicants. and if you want a body count look no further than alcohol which racks up 80,000 kills a year. cocaine manages a measly 2,000. same for heroin. but, the big daddy is big tobacco which kills 380,000 each year, which, by the way, is more people than have been killed by all the illegal drugs in the last century.}
<C>__{robert}
<P>__{(faking it)}
<D>__{that's very interesting.}
<A>__{the lobbyist smiles. robert sips his drink.}
<B>__{another angle on robert}
<A>__{in another room. listening to stan, overweight advocate for the united states council of chambers of commerce.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{it's time, robert, to choke some honesty out of these rural legislators; get'em to fess up that it's pretty much prisons or casinos in terms of their choices for economic growth.}
<B>__{another angle on robert}
<A>__{listening to ethan, earnest advocate of harm reduction.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{what's the difference between prozac and ecstacy, you ask? one's a mattress and the other's a trampoline. molecules don't have morality. really, think about it: some molecule changes the way a serotonin re uptake inhibitor works, it's not suddenly a bad molecule; it's just a molecule. my theory: america has a real fear of short, intense experiences.}
<A>__{robert turns away }
<C>__{robert}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{like you.}
<C>__{another room}
<D>__{robert at the bar getting another scotch. a secretive man, tim, 40's, nerdy, sidles up beside him and whispers furtively in his ear.}
<C>__{tim}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{chemicals? some say problems, others say solution. imagine a cloud that when it rains prohibits the growth of poppies or takes the thc out of marijuana. imagine a pill that eliminates any psychological craving, from dilaudid to dove bars. law enforcement hasn't let science sit on the sidelines. addiction is no more relevant than polio or the black plague.}
<A>__{tim slips away into the crowd. robert moves away from the bar.}
<B>__{another room}
<A>__{an argument is breaking out between an economist and an undersecretary of defense with robert as the audience.}
<C>__{economist}
<P>__{(to the undersecretary)}
<D>__{you're not battling traffickers or dealers, but a market, and the market contains a paradox: if you arrest traffickers, you raise prices, and you also raise profits, which brings more traffickers into the business.}
<C>__{undersecretary}
<P>__{(to the economist)}
<D>__{back in the real world, we're talking about mexico and not john maynard keynes. we will spend 18 billion dollars this year on this "war," and the question on the table every year is do we certify mexico as an ally or not?}
<A>__{another man, rush phillips, a middle aged powerbroker, overhears, then joins and robert is encircled.}
<C>__{rush phillips}
<D>__{you want to make a difference, hit the users. you don't jeopardize our financial markets by some hypocritical stance on drug consumption. we're snorting it, why penalize mexico for supplying it?}
<C>__{undersecretary}
<D>__{mexico, don't talk to me about mexico }
<C>__{economist}
<D>__{it's the stick of law enforcement that creates the carrot of huge profits... that's economic truth }
<C>__{rush phillips}
<D>__{addicts don't vote; they don't have pacs; they don't spend soft money, that's political truth }
<C>__{undersecretary}
<D>__{we're locking them up and consumption is falling }
<C>__{economist}
<D>__{the price of coke and heroin has dropped and purity has increased. all this law enforcement has achieved is kids can get better stuff, cheaper. in economic terms, you can forget it; this is not a winnable war.}
<C>__{rush phillips}
<D>__{christ, you want to decertify somebody, take pakistan or columbia. we don't need them for anything.}
<C>__{economist}
<D>__{if you manage to seize an inconceivable 50 percent of all drugs coming into this country, you'll still raise the price of coke and heroin less than 3 percent which won't affect drug use at all.}
<C>__{rush phillips}
<D>__{why are we calling this a war at all? you don't declare war on your own people. addiction is a little worm that gnaws a house apart from the inside.}
<A>__{michael adler, about robert's age, and as successful, but in a different way, approaches, catching robert's eye through the arguing demagogues.}
<C>__{undersecretary}
<D>__{we need mexico for these reasons: number one defense; two trade; three tourism; then, way on down the line, comes drugs. the president knows this. why's he holding everybody's feet to the fire?}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(solemn)}
<D>__{mr. wakefield, there's a situation that needs your attention right away.}
<A>__{robert looks at michael, squints, looks closer, then follows.}
<C>__{rush phillips}
<P>__{(oblivious)}
<D>__{one in sixteen americans is of mexican descent. mexico our third largest trading partner...}
<B>__{angle on robert and michael on the back porch.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{you're looking pretty good for an old guy.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{my work keeps me young.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{which part, getting terrorists loose on bail or freeing convicted murderers on technicalities?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{the worst serial killer in history who? gacy right? killed forty two people. our government killed fifty thousand in vietnam and lied about it every day.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{michael, you represent drug dealers, not civil libertarians.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{we kidnapped noriega out of panama. is that covered in your constitution? because it isn't in mine.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{noriega is a criminal.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{noriega was head of a sovereign nation who made the mistake of doing business with the u.s. government. so, no, i don't have a problem waking up every day and fighting our government, fighting people like you, trying to keep this system a little bit honest.}
<C>__{robert}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{last i read your clients were chopping people up with chainsaws and delivering illegal narcotics into this country.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i hope when you were on the bench, judge wakefield, you didn't handle the presumption of innocence in the same fashion.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{if i ever return to the bench, counselor adler, i hope i have the pleasure of hearing your arguments.}
