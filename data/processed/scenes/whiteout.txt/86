<A>__{murphy and rhonda are standing next to the comms tech, who is sitting in front of his computer. the screen revealing the satellite imagery of the storm it's grown and moving closer to asb.}
<C>__{tech}
<D>__{it's packing winds of a hundred thirty knots.}
<A>__{murphy looks stressed.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{shit we've got to move up the evac.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{how much?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{six hours at least.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{jesus, i got crew that's still not in.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{then get them in!}
<A>__{rhonda is thrown off by his tone }
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{you wanted to see me?}
<A>__{murphy looks over. sees carrie coming in through the door.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{where the hell have you been?}
<A>__{she doesn't like his tone }
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{buried under 2 tons of ice. you?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{do me a favor, you find any more bodies, mind not parading them down the main corridor. i've got newbies afraid to winterover, for chirstsake. they want out on seats i don't have. and next time you want to take a goddamn plane anywhere, you ask me.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{sure thing, chief.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{we don't have enough supplies for all of us to winter over if we get stuck down here.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and you wonder why it didn't work out between us.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{it didn't work, sam, because you couldn't keep your hands off every new woman who stepped foot on the ice down here. i was stupid enough to be one of them. now if you could cut through your red tape for just one second, you would realize that someone's out there with six cannisters, possibly full of uranium, and he wants to get it into the hands of some very bad people. and i'm trying to stop it so fuck asking you for shit, sam.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{this is ridic }
<A>__{the sound of a large book dropping onto the floor, sends a harsh reverb across the room.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{enough!}
<A>__{everyone's attention goes to doc standing at the door. he's really pissed. glares at murphy.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{what the hell's wrong with you, murph? i've got bodies piling up in my lab, and she's the only one doing anything about it.}
<C>__{doc }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{why don't you try helping her for a change?}
<A>__{murphy looks at doc. not giving in. carrie calms down she's had enough.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{you know what doc, it's alright.}
<A>__{carrie looks to rhonda }
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{you got my list?}
<A>__{rhonda pulls it from her clipboard. hands it to her. carrie walks out with doc.}
