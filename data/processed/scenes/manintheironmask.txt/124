<L>__{interior d'artagnan's room}
<A>__{d'artagnan returns to his bare room; he sits down upon the bed and drops his face into his hands. then he hears the sound, like a scream, but short and muffled, almost like the whelp of a kicked dog. he lifts his head sharply; where did that sound come from? he is almost too tired, too sad, to investigate. then the king, already shaken by the night's events, hurries into d'artagnan's room.}
