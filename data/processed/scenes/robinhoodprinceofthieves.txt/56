<L>__{exterior woodsmen's camp day}
<A>__{an arrow flies into a bull's eye, crudely marked on a tree. little john lowers his crossbow, delighted at his shot.}
<C>__{little john}
<P>__{(to wulf)}
<D>__{right m'lad. let's see how close you can git to that bugger.}
<A>__{wulf takes aim. his arrow slices clear through his father's arrow, splitting it in two. little john slaps wulf on the back and beckons everyone over.}
<C>__{little john}
<D>__{take a gander at this 'un, mates. never seen nuthin' like it in my bloomin' life.}
<A>__{robin leads marian through the camp... the beginnings of a village women doing laundry, kids playing, men prac ticing archery and swordplay, others working on defenses, camouflaging a giant pit. marian is impressed, but not about to admit it.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{this better be damned important.}
<A>__{robin leads her into a hut. inside is a trove of cap tured loot purses, jewelry, weaponry, fancy coats and... the treasure chest. at robin's nod, bull throws back the lid. marian is speechless.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{nottingham robs the poor. we rob nottingham and give back to the poor.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{do you think he's going to let you get away with all this? the man is without mercy. he will annihilate you.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{somebody has to take a stand.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{you're taking a stand with the lives of these people. these young ones.}
<A>__{a beat. she checks the faces. her eyes meet robin's. is there a hint of concern for him also?}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{what do you want from me?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{nottingham was sending this gold to buy reinforcements from the celtic tribesmen. we need to warn king richard.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{nottingham would not dare challenge the king.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{the king is not in england to be challenged, is he? while he is away, he may lose his country.}
<P>__{(marian masks her concern)}
<D>__{you are richard's cousin. you can get word to him. he would believe you.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{now you want me to participate in your folly?}
<A>__{a little girl approaches, holding a bouquet of wild flowers. touched, marian kneels to accept the offering.}
