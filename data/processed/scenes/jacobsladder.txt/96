<L>__{exterior vietnam night}
<A>__{gunfire explodes in the darkening sky. we are in vietnam. jacob is at the bottom of a trench fighting with frank. chaos surrounds them. men are screaming. the enemy is storming at them from the rear. rod raises his bayonet and jams it into the belly of his attacker. it is only after a series of jabs that he sees it's another american he's killed. rod's eyes go blank with confusion and terror.}

<D>__{oh my god! what's happening?}
<A>__{jacob looks up from the trench and sees a continuing wave of american soldiers bearing down on them. frank jumps up, knocking jacob to the ground and slamming his rifle into jacob's back. as he spins around jacob sees another soldier charging at him. his bayonet is aimed at jacob's stomach. for the first time jacob remembers the face of his attacker. he is a young man, about 19 years old, clean cut, wearing glasses. the two men stare at each other in terrible confusion. it seems like a moment out of time. and then the soldier lurches forward and rams his bayonet deep into jacob's abdomen.}
