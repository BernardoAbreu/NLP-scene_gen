<L>__{exterior patio outside the bar}
<A>__{low lit. empty. derek comes out, flips open his cell to call home. he puts his drink down on a table.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{hey, honey. it's me.}
<L>__{intercutting with beth in kyle's bedroom, putting him to}

<C>__{derek}
<D>__{they're all getting wasted. any minute now, joe's going to suggest the jacuzzi.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{well, if your future depends on putting on a bathing suit and hot tubbing it with a bunch of drunks... derek? you there?}
<A>__{derek freezes. across the patio, he sees a figure slowly approaching. it's a woman back lit, a silhouette. but as she passes into the light from the bar, she's revealed as lisa, transformed into an alluring femme fatale.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{i have to go.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{wait. kyle wants to say good night.}
<C>__{derek}
<P>__{(tense)}

<A>__{as lisa comes closer...}
<C>__{derek}
<P>__{(desperate)}
<D>__{beth, i will call you later.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i will be in bed derek?}
<A>__{derek clicks off and pockets his cell. on the other end, beth looks perturbed. now lisa comes face to face with derek, smiling. she boldly picks up his drink and takes a sip.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i can always tell from the pained look on your face when you're talking to beth.}
<C>__{derek}
<P>__{(demanding)}
<D>__{how did you know i'd be here?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i've got my sources.}
<P>__{slight frown)}
<D>__{what's wrong? you don't look happy to see me.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{why did you come here?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{you said you could never be with someone you work with.}
<P>__{(when he doesn't seem to "get it")}
<D>__{that's why i quit. so we could be together.}
<A>__{derek looks at her, astounded.}
<C>__{derek}
<P>__{(holding down panic)}
<D>__{lisa, you need to leave.}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(teasing smile)}
<D>__{or what? you'll make a scene?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{call security? what would joe and ben and the others think? i will tell you what they'd think. they'd think we arranged it. and in a way, we did.}
<A>__{lisa turns aside. out of derek's sight, she slips a capsule into his drink, then puts it back on the table.}
<C>__{lisa }
<D>__{this hook up was on the books from the day we met.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{one of us has to take control and i guess it's me. so you go back, say your good nights to the boys and i will be waiting in my room.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{i'm not coming to your room.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{would you rather i came to yours?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{you're crazy... sick. you need help.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i know. i need help.}
<P>__{(moves closer; seductive)}
<D>__{help me, derek.}
<A>__{she presses against him.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{stay away from me!}
<A>__{lisa emits a musical little laugh and smooths her dress. she registers derek's angry face and clenched fists. she smiles.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{all right, derek. you play your games...}
<P>__{(turning away)}
<D>__{... and i will play mine.}
<A>__{lisa disappears into the darkness, high heels echoing. derek feel his cell phone vibrate. he pulls it out.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{beth, i'm sorry }
<C>__{ben's voice}
<D>__{beth? it's ben. where the hell are you, bro?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{i'm right here. coming back in.}
<A>__{agitated, derek picks up his drink, downs it and re enters the bar.}
