<L>__{interior miles office}
<A>__{miles sits behind his desk, fingers steepled, staring at nothing, a haunted look on his face. his intercom squawks:}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{mr. massey }
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{please! no calls! i'm feeling very fragile.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{i'm sorry, mr. massey, but i felt certain you'd want to know marylin rexroth wants to see you.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{marylin rexroth? when does she }
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{she's here now.}
<L>__{interior private bathroom}
<A>__{miles runs his fingers through his hair, carefully examining himself in the mirror. suavely smiling.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{marylin! how nice.}
<A>__{he clears his throat, begins again with lower pitch, suave smile still in place}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{marylin! how lovely, uh }
<A>__{he runs a finger across his teeth, which squeak, then puts back the suave smile}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{ marylin! what a pleasure }
<B>__{doorway}
<A>__{on miles as he opens the door, suavely smiling.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{marylin, what a pleas who the fuck are you?}
<A>__{facing him in the doorway is a large roughly handsome middle aged man in a business suit. just behind him is marylin rexroth, looking as coolly beautiful as ever. she smoothly puts in:}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{miles, how nice of you to see us may i introduce howard d. doyle of doyle oil.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{i told you we know each other, baby. mr. massey represented my ex brother in law. martin reiser?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{oh. right. won't you have a seat?}
<C>__{doyle}
<P>__{(to marylin)}
<D>__{after you, doll.}
<A>__{marylin glides into the office. seats herself on the couch. doyle sits next to her, one proprietary hand on her knee.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{and how is mrs. reiser?}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{few suicide attempts, little inpatient stinterior naturally, she misses her kids. six weekends a year and alternate yom kippurs seemed harsh to us but hey all's fair. anyhoo, she lives with a "nurse," takes her meds and goes to occupational therapy at a local sheltered workshop.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{so she's uh, flourishing?}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{she makes felt wallets. got one right here.}
<A>__{doyle pulls out a deranged piece of felt stuffed with money. most of the contents slip to the floor.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{yeah. i know. leather would be more practical, but whatcha gonna do?}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{miles, i know you're busy and that you charge by the hour so i will come to the pointerior howard and i are planning to marry.}
<A>__{miles is stunned.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{muh well, uh huh?}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{yep. my divorce just came through. shoulda called you. coulda cut a better deal! my wife still has health insurance and gets to see the children. but, i don't know. guess i'm just a softie. after all amanda and me were together for what you'd know better than me, marylin. she was your best friend.}
<C>__{marylin}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{sixteen years? howard jr. is fourteen and mandy must be what twelve?}
<C>__{doyle}
<P>__{(to miles)}
<D>__{here. got pictures.}
<A>__{he removes a family photo from the felt wallet. it's of howard and two fat teenagers. apparently the former mrs. doyle was cut out, but an ear and part of a hairdo are sill visible in the shot.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i... uh guess congratulations are in order.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{well marylin and rex broke up and...}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{honey, i don't think this is really relevant to...}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{...and one day, this sweet girl calls me, asks me to lunch. just a shoulder to cry on deal. one thing leads to another and before i know it }
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{ we realized we'd always been very attracted to one another.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{i had no idea until after, but }
<A>__{he looks at her with predatory lust.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{baby. you are so hot!}
<C>__{marylin}
<P>__{(coy)}
<D>__{howard!}
<A>__{he pulls her close to him and plants a massive kiss on her.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{what a touching story.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{you know, miles, after my wife wife's mastectomy things were never the same. this might sound cold, well, maybe not to you, massey, but...}
<P>__{(man to man)}
<D>__{i like my women with two boobs.}
<A>__{miles flashes marylin a "you are kidding" look, but she assiduously avoids eye contact.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{howard and i are here, miles, because i have learned through bitter experience that when it comes to matrimonial law, you are the very best.}
<A>__{miles acknowledges this with a curt nod.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{as you are well aware, my previous marriage ended with an unjustified strain on my reputation my motives were questioned. i was slandered in court.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{you did good, massey!}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{therefore in an effort to remove any trace of suspicion from my sweet howard i wish to execute a pre nuptial agreement.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{and there's no talking her out of it. believe me, i've tried.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{they say the massey pre nup has never been penetrated.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{she said "penetrate." heh heh heh.}
<A>__{he gropes her. she giggles like a teenager.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{oh, for the love of...}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{that is true, isn't it miles? your pre nup is the best there is?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{that is correct. not to blow my own horn, but they devote an entire semester to it at harvard law.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{harvard? whoa, daddy!}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i just want to make sure that you both }
<A>__{he eyes marylin.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{ understand what you're asking for here. the massey pre nup provides that in the event of a dissolution of the marriage for any reason, both parties shall leave it with whatever they brought in, and earned during. no one can profit from the marriage. the pre nup protects the wealthier party.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{well at the moment, that'd be me.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{and without it, that party is exposed a sitting duck. no wriggle room.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{a wriggle room! maybe we should put that in the malibu house. screw the screening room!}
<C>__{miles}
<P>__{(slightly sickened)}
<D>__{ and we are sure...}
<A>__{eyes boring into marylin.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{ we are both sure that's what we want?}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{course i can't do much "wriggling" if you tie me up like that again. massey this is one bad bad little girl.}
<C>__{marylin}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{we'd better go before we get thrown out.}
<B>__{elevator bank}
<A>__{marylin and howard wait for an elevator as miles trots out to catch them.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{excuse me, mr. doyle, if i could just borrow your charming fiancee for a moment.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{what part?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i'd just like to have a word with her.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{why not? i'm going to have her for a lifetime.}
<A>__{miles drags her to the side as doyle checks his sports pager.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{she backs up as he tries to close the space between them.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{getting married.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{to him? he's a sick freak.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{he's passionate.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{passionate! he's a pervert. he should have to register when he moves.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{all girls enjoy a little rough trade from time to time.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{marylin! listen to me.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{no. you listen to me.}
<P>__{(very quiet and deliberate)}
<D>__{you busted me, miles. you left me with nothing! what did you expect me to do? get a degree in counseling? write a book about table linen? because that's what wives do when they get dumped, and frankly, i'm not quite ready for that.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{but why him?}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{we told you. we realized we've always been in love.}
<A>__{he has backed her against the wall of an alcove which shelters a flowering ficus.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{the massey pre nup has never been pene successfully challenged.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{so i hear. is that all?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{no, that's not all.}
<A>__{he moves to kiss her.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{you fascinate me.}
<A>__{she deftly slides out of the way. miles watches her as she heads down the hall. as she gets on the elevator, howard grabs her butt with one hand, while giving miles a high sign with the other.}
