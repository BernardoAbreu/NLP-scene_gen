<L>__{exterior nicaraguan countryside day}
<A>__{a rented car with white flags turns onto the road to leon. price drives, eats, and reads a map. claire takes the map from him and reads it herself. they seem to enjoy their first moment alone without alex looking over their shoulder. a small band aid is on price's clean shaven cheek.}

<A>__{again their glibness is interrupted by what they came to see. even as they joke, they watch the landscape with concern. refugees are streaming out of leon, mostly women and children, some old men, carrying their possessions. soldiers stand around.}
