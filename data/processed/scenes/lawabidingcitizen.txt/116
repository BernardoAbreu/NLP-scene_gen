<L>__{interior bedroom night}
<A>__{he comes in, opens the closet, reaches up for some overnight bags but pauses, drawn to his tie rack inside the door. he stares at the ties hanging in neat rows...starts touching them, running his hands up and down the fabric... kell stands in the doorway watching. wondering what the fuck is going on. and getting a little creeped out.}
<C>__{kell}
<D>__{honey?}
<A>__{he freezes, feeling something in the seam of a tie. runs his fingers up and down, thinking something's in there. emma appears in the doorway too, at her mother's side. both staring now. they watch as: nick grabs a pair of scissors from kell's sewing kit, carves the tie lengthwise, rips it open, feverish and faster, finds nothing inside but mangled fabric and thread and stops. looks back. realizes they're staring at him.}
<C>__{kell}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing?}
<A>__{nick pauses what the hell is he doing? he starts to regain his sense, laughs at himself in amazement.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{daddy?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{it's okay, baby i'm fine, i promise. go back to your game.}
<A>__{dubious, emma departs. as soon as she's out of earshot:}
<C>__{kell}
<D>__{seriously, nick. what the fuck.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{nothing. i got paranoid for no reason, that's all. i'm fine now. i can't believe i let that son of a bitch clyde get to me like that.}
<C>__{kell}
<D>__{are you in danger? are we?}
<A>__{the question hangs there the real question.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i'm sure we're fine.}
<A>__{he pulls his phone, speed dials.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i will make goddamn sure.}
<P>__{(beat, into phone)}
<D>__{sarah, roust the adas. tell 'em we're pulling an all nighter.}
