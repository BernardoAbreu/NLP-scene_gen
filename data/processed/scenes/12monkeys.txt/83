<L>__{interior mason mansion dining room night}
<A>__{a formal dinner for forty. desert has been served. dr. malcolm mason rises to the enthusiastic applause of the guests.}
<C>__{dr. mason}
<D>__{would that i could enjoy this opulent dinner and this excellent and stimulating company for itself, with no sense of purpose. but alas, i am "burdened" with the sense that with all this excess of public attention and this cacophony of praise, there comes great responsibility. indeed, i practically feel a soapbox growing under my feet whenever i stand for more than a few seconds.}
<A>__{while guests laugh at dr. mason's last remark, secret service agent #3 enters the room, scowling, looking for someone.}
<C>__{dr. mason }
<D>__{the dangers of science are a time worn threat, from prometheus stealing fire from the gods to the cold war era of the dr. strangelove terror.}
<A>__{agent #3 spots who he's looking for. jeffrey mason!}
<C>__{dr. mason }
<D>__{but never before, not even at los alamos when the scientists made bets on whether their first atomic bomb test would wipe out new mexico, has science given us so much reason to fear the power we have at hand.}
<A>__{angle on jeffrey, as agent #3 whispers in his ear.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{what are you talking about? what friend? i'm not expecting anyone.}
<A>__{angle on dr. mason, reacting with irritation to the disturbance.}
<C>__{dr. mason}
<D>__{current genetic engineering as well as my own work with viruses has presented us with powers as terrifying as any...}
<A>__{angle on jeffrey, following the agent out of the dining room, grumbling loudly enough to disturb his father's audience.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{this is ridiculous. my father is making a major address.}
