<B>__{the prison transport}
<A>__{comes to a stop at a traffic light. inside the prison transport rear parker sits alone in the darkness. motionless. until the sound of two gunshots piercing the transport's front windshield shatters the silence.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{what the hell's going on?!}
<A>__{he scrambles to the front of the compartment, pressing his face against the steel mesh of the fourinch portal. his pov looking through portal two bullet holes are visible in the windshield. the two prison guards lie dead in their seats. sid 6.7's eyes appear, looking directly at you. he's smiling.}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<P>__{(neighborly)}
<D>__{hey, old buddy, old pal, good to see you again.}
<B>__{inside the prison transport}
<A>__{parker goes absolutely berserk. viciously punching the steel mesh which separates them until the synthetic skin on his knuckles is shredded.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you...mother...fucker! i'm going to kill you!!!}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<D>__{now, is that any way to talk to an old buddy? i mean, just because i'm carrying around the joy of killing your family inside me doesn't mean we can't be friends.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{grimes, you're dead!}
<A>__{he savagely hurls himself against his confines. bone vs. metal. don't try this at home.}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<D>__{i'm sorry, the party you're trying to reach is not answering. is there anyone else you would like to talk to?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{dead! you hear me?}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{you really are pathetic, you know that? mathew grimes is only one letter in my alphabet. he is nothing compared to me.}
<A>__{parker is completely spent. mentally and physically. he slumps in a corner. out of breath. bleeding. sore. all he can do is stare out through the portal's mesh at sid 6.7.}
<C>__{sid 6.7 }
<D>__{you could say thankyou, you know? i'm giving you your freedom, short lived though it may be.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{a little known fact about the locater implants prison inmates now receive upon release is that they contain a pinhead capsule of neural toxin. the satellite they use to track you can also trigger release of the toxin with microwaves. after transmission, the implant's host dies within 30 seconds.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{it won't take long for them to get your termination authorized once they learn of your escape. now who would you rather go after, killer, them or me?}
<A>__{he releases the rear door lock.}
<B>__{on the street}
<A>__{parker bursts out of the back of the prison transport, charging after sid 6.7. who is nowhere to be seen. parker runs in one direction. then the other. and changes his mind again. he literally does not know which way to turn.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{shit!}
