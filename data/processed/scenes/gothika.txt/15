<A>__{miranda cautiously approaches the girl, who is now not moving. just standing there. her back to us.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{hello? are you hurt? hello?}
<A>__{nothing. as we get closer we see she is covered in bruises. clearly something horrible has happened to her.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{were you in an accident? were you attacked? it's okay, i'm a doctor.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{my name is miranda grey...}
<A>__{and now she turns. young, seventeen tops. busted lip, black eye. miranda pulls off her coat, wraps it around the girl }
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{you're in shock right now, that's perfectly natural. i'm going to get you to the hospital. okay?}

<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{don't be scared. it's going to be fine.}
<A>__{now the girl is touching miranda's face. her movements desperate, smothering. like the movements of a drowning person. miranda tries to push the girl's hands back down.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{hands off me, okay? tell me your name, do you remember your name?}
<A>__{the girl tries to speak but no words come out. instead she produces a strained, wettish sound. creepy as hell. and now she is prying miranda's mouth open and she's much stronger than expected and miranda is panicking }
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{what are you doing? i'm trying to help you ?!}
<A>__{the girl opens her own mouth wide like a snake. and as miranda muffles a scream, blood starts leaking out of the girl's eye sockets and from wounds all over her body.}
