<C>__{stamp paid}
<D>__{no use thinking these things now.}

<C>__{stamp paid}
<D>__{children ain't gonna need to know that kind of thing.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{they'll know. they'll know as soon as they born. cause it's inside us,stamp. it'll be inside them. we'll pass it down. schoolteacher didn't just change the outside, he changed the mind..and the blood..and what it carries...and what it's worth..}
<C>__{stamp paid}
<D>__{i don't believe that. i won't.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{there was a rooster named mister down at sweet home. last time i saw halle, with that butter all over his face and me with an iron bit in my mouth, i saw mister sitting on a tub. he loved that tub. like king on a throne. he was a hateful thing. bloody and evil..but he was better than me. mister was allowed to be and stay what he was. even if you cooked him you'd be cooking a rooster named mister. but wasn't no way i'd ever be paul d. again..schoolteacher changed me. was never no beating under mr. garner. schoolteacher changed that. why wouldn't a man run from that? why wouldn't a man not work, kill, starve, pull out his own heart to stop feeling 'stead of feeling that? and it strikes me, it's got to be cause we were something else. and that something was less than a chicken sitting in the sun on a tub.}
