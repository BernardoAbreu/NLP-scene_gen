<A>__{looking up at the surface, where a hull floats in silhouette against the daylight. there's a commotion, and a water ski drops into view. then another one. pale legs churn the water.}

<L>__{exterior ocean day}
<A>__{off amity beach, a bilious green lap straked boat is bobbing in the water, the engine idling. two girls are fooling around; the one in the water is terry, the one driving the boat is diane.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{did you ever see a dolphin?}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{sure. they like to play. we may see some today.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{great!}
<A>__{she fumbles with her skis.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{whoops, almost lost one. can't play with the dolphins without skis...}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{ready?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{hang on, hang on... okay, go.}
<A>__{diane goes to the controls, and puts the engine into gear, starting forward. terry waves "okay," diane opens up the throttle, the boat surges forward, pulling terry upright. a wake boils out from under her skis.}
<B>__{angle on the beach}
<A>__{ed and tina are camped on a blanket, necking in the shelter of the dunes. there's a portable radio, a cooler with some beer, and some sandwiches a perfect afternoon alone. above the dune, behind them lies the ocean, where the girls' ski boat can be seen, raising a big wake. tina disengages, and sits up, brushing sand out of her hair.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{take a break for a minute, okay?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{huh?}
<A>__{tina stands, and looks out to the sea, where the boat is towing terry on the water.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{eddie, can we do that?}
<P>__{(no reaction)}
<D>__{can we go skiing? we can use my uncle's boat. eddie?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{next week.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{with you, everything's next week. i want to go skiing soon. tomorrow?}
<A>__{ed grunts non comittally. tina takes a beer from the cooler, and goes up on the dune to watch terry and diane. she waves to them, and to someone down the beach.}
