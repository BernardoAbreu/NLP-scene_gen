<L>__{exterior trailer night}
<A>__{seen from outside, the light inside the trailers clearly illuminates sarah and malcolm as they carry the bay rex. the adult rexes tower over the trailer, twice as tall and nearly as long. they walk slowly alongside it, hunched over, watching their infant.}
<L>__{interior trailer night}
<A>__{at the door to the trailer, sarah un muzzles the frantic baby.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{ready?}
<A>__{malcolm reaches for the door handle.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{wait!}
<A>__{he dives down on the floor under them, pointing the video camera up at the door, getting the best shot. malcolm takes a breath, turns the knob, and throws open the door. outside, the enormous rex heads pause for a moment, staring, surprised. although terrified, sarah actually starts to sing.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{born free, as free as the wind blows. as free as the grass grows }
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{are you insane?!}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i swear to god, it works with lions sometimes! there we are your baby is free }
<A>__{the baby, excited, wriggles free of them and lands on the ground outside. not wasting a second, malcolm slams the door shut. the three of them freeze, not daring to breath. outside, they can hear the snuffling and cooing of the animals as they inspect their young and then the soft thud of their footsteps, growing fainter as they move away. from the wall, eddie's voice comes over the radio, relieved.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{they're going back into the jungle.}
