<A>__{adam, eve and troy examine female patrons over drinks. it's white wine for her, imported beer for troy, and a rob roy for adam.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{what have you ordered?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{it's a rob roy. a very popular drink, i'm told.}
<A>__{angle lovely brunette slinking by. angle table}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{what about her?}
<C>__{eve }
<D>__{no way.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{why?! i think she's very attractive.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{adam! she's got bitch written all over her! you do know what "bitch" means, don't you?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{yes, i have a dictionary. but i can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that! or why cliff would say that about you.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{because we're bitches! look at her! look at the expression on her face! the walk, the jewelry, the fingernails. please!}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{how 'bout this one?}
<A>__{"this one" is a killer blond.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{are you kidding?! you wouldn't even be a crumb on her table! you don't see that?!}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{eve?!}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{well, i'm trying to educate him! it's nothing personal.}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{adam, i think for you, we should go for "sweet."}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{okay. i like that.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(swigging her drink)}
<D>__{yeah, sweet. that's a nice way of putting it.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(to troy)}
<D>__{what do i say to miss sweet when i meet her?}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{um... eve?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{it's not so much what you say but how you say it. women like men who are unpredictable.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{yes, really! basically, they want what they think they can't have. same with guys. that's why everybody is walking around here sending off "you can't have me" signals!}
<B>__{angle of men and women}
<A>__{doing precisely that. then:}
<B>__{back to table}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{that's ridiculous.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{maybe. but that's how it works.}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{ah ha! there's " miss sweet." at the hors d'oeuvres table!}
