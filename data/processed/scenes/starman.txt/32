<A>__{his answer is nothing but the low buzz. he taps a series of buttons on his chest panel and speaks again.}

<D>__{mapmaker wind. do you hear me?}
<A>__{the buzz continues. he is very still for a moment. then he presses the palms of his hands together, prayer fashion, and concentrates. when he pulls them apart, a blue force field pulses between them. he stops at shoulder width. a solarized aerial view of the united states forms on the force field. a green dot appears in the area of western wisconsin, a red dot in the area of death valley, california. he drops his hands to his lap and sits very still. the solarized compass remains floating in the air in front of him. after a long moment he reaches up and squeezes it into a ball that disappears when his palms come together.}
