<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior lab day}
<A>__{we see a montage of interactions between nathan, puff, and lila.}
<L>__{1) nathan demonstrates the proper way to taste wine: sniffing}
<A>__{the cork, swishing the wine around in the glass, sipping, nodding in the affirmative to the waiter. puff, inside his case, imitates it perfectly.}
<L>__{2) nathan shows puff a flashcard which reads: "i will start}
<A>__{tonight with the foie gras."}
<L>__{3) puff is holding up a small hand mirror and trimming nose}
<A>__{hairs. lila applauds.}
<L>__{4) puff juggles three balls while riding a unicycle. 5) puff, dressed as peter pan, stands with legs spread and}
<A>__{hands on hips. he is singing "i gotta crow."}
<L>__{6) puff, dressed in an apron and chef's hat, is tossing a}
<A>__{salad. there are two types of vinegar to choose from. he hesitates, then chooses the balsamic. nathan and lila applaud.}
<L>__{7) puff, in a smoking jacket and smoking a pipe, is sitting}
<A>__{in an easy chair, next to a fake fire and a fake sleeping dog, and reading a book of poems by yeats. lila and nathan, outside the case, applaud and embrace.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{i think he's ready.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{oh boy!}
<C>__{puff}
<P>__{(jumping up)}
<D>__{oh boy!}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{now, puff, we're leaving on the electronic collar. i don't think we'll need to shock you, but just in case.}
<C>__{puff}
<D>__{okay. that's fair.}
<A>__{nathan unlocks the case. puff tentatively steps out into the world. he hugs nathan. it's a grateful, obsequious, slightly pathetic hug. nathan hugs him back, but he's keeping him at a distance. puff pulls himself out of the hug, but still rests his hands on nathan's shoulders and looks him in the eye, almost like a lover. then he parts with nathan and goes over to embrace lila. she graciously receives him. after a moment in the embrace, puff starts dry humping lila. lila can't get out of his clutches.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{no, puff! bad!}
<A>__{nathan presses a button, which shocks puff and sends him flying. puff appears disoriented, then gets up off the floor, brushes himself off, and turns to lila with a bow of his head.}
<C>__{puff}
<D>__{my apologies, madam.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{it's okay, puff.}
<C>__{puff}
<D>__{shan't happen again.}
