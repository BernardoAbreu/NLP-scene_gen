<L>__{interior submarine sickbay day}
<A>__{connor has a private medical area set aside. he's not looking good pale, weak, only semi conscious. i.v.s and monitors, other life support equipment. kyle is with connor, staring at a small polaroid photo in his hand. connor can barely speak above a whisper.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{her name was sarah... she was... amazing...}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{i don't remember my mother.}
<A>__{kyle starts to hand the photo back, connor waves it away.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{keep it.}
<A>__{kyle is a bit puzzled, but obediently keeps the snapshot. kate enters with marcus, touches the boy's shoulder.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{kyle, could you give us a minute?}
<A>__{kyle reluctantly leaves, still looking at the photo, with a nod to marcus on the way out. he joins star in the doorway, they go off together. kate, connor and marcus are alone now. throughout scene, kate fights to maintain a steely control but she's clearly not far from tears.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{marcus... you're going to need to be rebuilt. your face, your body, your voice...}
<P>__{(off his shrug)}
<D>__{we have people who can do it.}
<A>__{she pulls some medical diagrams out of a drawer, lays them before marcus. he examines a scanned image of his face, various elements highlighted.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{but you won't be the same...}
<A>__{marcus moves to the next image it shows his features transformed into another's something closer to john connor's face, with a jagged scar over part of his features.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{the scar will help hide the change.}
<A>__{marcus lowers the papers, absorbing this.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{you're asking me to become...}
<P>__{(gesturing at connor)}
<D>__{him?}
<A>__{connor can barely speak above a whisper:}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{you must.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{we can't keep him alive much longer.}
<P>__{(shakes her head, swallows)}
<D>__{very few people know what john actually looks like. only the technicians and our closest advisors need ever know the truth.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{why me?}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{who else? only you know the enemy from the inside. you liberated a skynet camp... you're a hero.}
<A>__{connor gestures for marcus to move closer, he speaks with great effort:}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{i never knew how i was supposed to win this war. but i finally understand: the idea of john connor is more important than the person.}
<P>__{(sinks back, spent)}
<D>__{i can die. he cannot.}
<A>__{kate leans toward marcus, who's lost in thought.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{please. we need you.}
<A>__{marcus bows his head for a long beat, as if seeking an answer from within. then he looks up again with resolve. he lifts his hand the skin tattered, metal exposed at finger joints and moves to take connor's trembling hand.}
