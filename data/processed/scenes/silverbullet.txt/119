<L>__{interior the stairwell of the coslaw home}
<A>__{marty is sitting in a stair chair that rises slowly to the second floor. he looks dejected and glum. sound of nan hectoring her brother al. i don't think we can make out all of what's going on, but we've all known women like nan and i think we can fill in the blanks. "christian household... you come here drunk and expect... can't even bother to call ahead..." etc., etc. a wheelchair stands on the second floor landing. this one is no silver bullet, only the more humble sort that moves by arm power. when the stair chair clicks to a stop, marty hoists himself from it into the wheelchair and rolls down the hall toward the bathroom. below, nan's rant is still going on.}
