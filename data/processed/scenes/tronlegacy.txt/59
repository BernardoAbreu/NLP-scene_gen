<L>__{interior ancient computer system labyrinth}
<A>__{eaten away by memory leaks, like swiss cheese. rush, mega, krod follow i beem along narrow paths of unaffected material. krod trips, his light wand tumbles and skates into memory leakage. it fries and de rezzes, sucked into the molten silicon swamp.}
<D>__{d rezz akakakaka agggggggg }
<A>__{sounds like a modem, but it's a battle cry. rush comes to a point above and cut off from the fight. d rezz advances along a narrow gantry, spinning his romball, ready to hurl at:}
<B>__{tron.}
<A>__{tron flips over memory leakage, gains position and throws his disk disk hits d rezz. plasma ball gash, but d rezz is tough. he takes the damage, cocks his romball }
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{guys! go around behind tron!}
<A>__{rush darts down to help d rezz. mega, rush hurry ahead. i beem zaps, zags and reforms, scared out of his mind. d rezz hurls his romball romball pings off two walls, comes at tron from behind. tron spins milliseconds to spare and flips clear. retrieves his disk on the way down. romball slams off a wall, heads back to d rezz, but tron's disk hits it, knocking it off course. d rezz dives for romball but it falls into the memory leak and fries to bits. tron plants for a clear shot at d rezz. rush jumps down from above, right in front of d rezz.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{ouch!}
<A>__{his ankle. he straightens, standing in front of d rezz. lays eyes on tron.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{hey! pick on somebody your own size!}
<A>__{d rezz is twice as big as either of them. tron's eyes are cold, lifeless, calculating. scanning his new opponent without success.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{you've got no data on me.}
<A>__{rush pulls his disk off his back, poised for a duel. tron moves with calculation, grips his hyper etched disk. circling his prey. throws again brrangg rush ducks tron's disk slams d rezz. d rezz tries to catch the disk, but he's just too slow. rush throws his disk. beginner's luck it banks off a wall and nearly smacks tron. rush snags it on the way back, before it tumbles into memory leakage. tron jumps up two levels. retrieves his disk.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{d rezz, pull me up!}
<A>__{d rezz hoists rush up. fingers grab upper deck. tron jockeys for position. throws disk disk strikes d rezz in the ribs. blast damage. d rezz loses footing. rush grabs upper level. d rezz slips toward memory leakage. rush grabs d rezz's hand he weighs a ton. mega, krod and i beem can't get here to help }
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{hang on, man! hang on!}
<A>__{but d rezz's big hand slips out of rush's. d rezz plummets into memory leakage, zapping away in a blaze of glory }
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{noooo!}
<A>__{he comes to his feet, facing tron. determined.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{i know who you are. encom security program tr856 tron!}
<A>__{tron pauses. processes.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{who is your user??}
<A>__{tron glitches at the question.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{who programmed you?? i know your encryption code. tell me your user or i shut you down.}
<A>__{tron throws his disk. rush dodges. he sends waves of data energy through floor circuits, reaching into tron's body.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{i can shut you down with a nine digit code. who is your user?? 392 }
<A>__{tron's body animates painfully, as the first three code digits click into place. tron flips away, breaking contact with floor. data transfer stops. tron steals away through a tunnel. rush pursues. krod, mega and i beem clamber for a way to follow.}
