<A>__{the nitramon is applied. half ear closes his eyes. charlie observes him a moment.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you okay? half ear ah huh. just need a moment's meditation.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{now? half ear i'm about to insert a wire into a detonator tube and if the wire touches the sides of tube, we'll be blown to kingdom come. best to be at one with yourself.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{take all the time you need.}
<A>__{another moment, then half ear sets to work. charlie holds a mini flashlight, illuminating the intricate detonator. very carefully, he inserts a wire into a tube. remember, the wire must not touch the sides. the wire is half way in when a large spider drops onto his hand. frozen, he ponders this. charlie sees the spider, doesn't know what to do. half ear studies the spider... then he closes his eyes just a moment... relaxes... breathes in, breathes out... and then he leans forward, opens his mouth and clamps his lips over the spider, comes back up. finishes inserting the wire. job done, he calmly opens his mouth. the spider puts a hairy leg out and delicately explores his cheek. half ear plucks it off just as delicately, depositing the spider on the wall. charlie just shakes his head in disbelief.}
<D>__{half ear my work here is done.}
