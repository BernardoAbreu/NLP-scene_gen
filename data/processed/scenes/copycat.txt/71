<D>__{day. i mean that.}
<A>__{he hods card out to her. helen, holding onto the door frame, doesn't move. ruben continues to extend his hand with the card in it. it is a charged moment. she is frozen in the doorway; ruben refuses to make a move towards her. helen summons all her nerve and lets go of the door frame, determined not to have any further mortification this night, she takes one shaky step out into the hallway to meet him. then a second step and a third. her hand touches the card, takes it. she turns her head to gauge the distance she must retreat. what she sees is that the door's sureclose device has quietly and efficiently closed. the door is locked. frantic, she turns back toward ruben.}
