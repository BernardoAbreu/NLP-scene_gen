<L>__{interior train compartment}
<A>__{the compartment is jammed with travelers. suitcases and packages balanced precariously. dmitri sits down and carefully touches his painful noso.}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{do you always punch people first thing in the morning?}
<C>__{anya}
<D>__{sorry it's a reflex. living in an orphanage if someone bothers you you automatically come up swinging.}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{i wasn't bothering you. i was trying to wake you up!}
<A>__{over anya's shoulder, out of the window. we see the three minions on horseback charging down a snow covered hill toward the train.}
<C>__{anya}
<D>__{by pulling my hair?!}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{i was all out of dynamite!}
<A>__{dmitri touches his nose again. anya opens the window and grabs some snow. we see the minions racing wildly to catch up with the train. as the scene continues, we see the minions, by one, getting close to the train and then disappear from view only their riderless horses ride away.}
<C>__{anya}
<P>__{(hands dmitri the snow)}
<D>__{put it on your nose. for heaven's sake, you're making such a fuss!}
<A>__{dmitri tries to act very manly as he puts the ice on his nose, but cringes with the cold. anya smiles.}
<C>__{anya}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{men are such babies...}
<A>__{an elderly woman loaded with packages cones into the compartment. anya immediately rises to help her.}
<C>__{anya}
<D>__{here, let me}
<A>__{dmitri and vlad both pull her back down.}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{you're a princess...}
<C>__{vladimir}
<D>__{royalty do not help people with their luggage.}
<A>__{anya gives them both a look and helps the woman.}
<C>__{vladimir}
<D>__{well, she certainly has a mind of her own.}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{yes. and i hate that in a woman.}
<A>__{vlad holds meotoo, who is enthralled and plays with vladimir's drooping mustache, like a kitten with a string. the compartment door swings open and an ominous looking guard strides in!}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{papers!}
<A>__{everyone rustles for their papers. dmitri confidently pulls out their papers, done in beautiful black ink. then, he glances at the person next to him and sees that his papers are done in a bright red ink. dmitri looks over at vladimir who has seen the mistake as well.}
<C>__{vladimir}
<P>__{(sheepishly)}
<D>__{it's what i hate about this government everything in red!}
<A>__{the guard hand papers back to a soulful looking man with a frozen beard.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{thank you, comrade zhivago.}
<C>__{zhivago}
<D>__{doctor zhivago.}
<A>__{guard approaches vlad and dmitri.}
<C>__{vladimir}
<D>__{what do we do now?}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{pray he's color blind...}
<A>__{dmitri flashes the guard a charming smile as he hands over his papers. vladimir is nervously playing with his mustache until it stands out straight. anya has no idea what's going on.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{wait here.}
<A>__{as the guard heads out of the compartment, vlad turns to dmitri and they exchange an "oh, no" look.}
