<C>__{uncle billy}
<D>__{isn't it wonderful?}
<A>__{the rest of the crowd all greet george with greetings and smiles. each one comes forward with money. in their pockets, in shoe boxes, in coffee pots. money pours onto the table pennies, dimes, quarters, dollar bills small money, but lots of it. mrs. bailey and mrs. hatch push toward george. more people come in. the place becomes a bedlam. shouts of "gangway gangway" as a new bunch comes in and pours out its money. mary stands next to george, watching him. george stands there overcome and speechless as he holds zuzu. as he sees the familiar faces, he gives them sick grins. tears course down his face. his lips frame their names as he greets them.}

<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{mr. martini. how about some wine?}
<A>__{as various members of the family bring out a punch bowl and glasses, janie sits down at the piano and strikes a chord. she starts playing "hark! the herald angels sing," and the entire crowd joins in the singing. we see a series of shots of the various groups singing the hymn, and some people are still coming in and dropping their money on the table. carter, the bank examiner, makes a donation; the sheriff sheepishly looks at george and tears his warrant in small pieces. in the midst of this scene, harry, in naval uniform, enters, accompanied by bert, the cop.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{hello, george, how are you?}

<A>__{george, still holding zuzu in his arms, glances down at the pile of money on the table. his eye catches something on top of the pile, and he reaches down for it. it is clarence's copy of "tom sawyer." george opens it and finds an inscription written in it: "dear george, remember no man is a failure who has friends. thanks for the wings, love clarence."}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(looking at book)}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{that's a christmas present from a very dear friend of mine.}
<A>__{at this moment, perhaps because of the jostling of some of the people on the other side of the tree, a little silver bell on the christmas tree swings to and fro with a silvery tinkle. zuzu closes the cover of the book, and points to the bell.}
