<A>__{as they walk up park avenue...}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{so did you take my advice and not tell your new fiance about our little friendship.}
<A>__{jacob doesn't say anything. and gordon doesn't press.}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{so, i'm guessing she's not going to take your last name.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{good guess.}
<C>__{gordon gekko}
<D>__{that's my winnie. i knew she was a feminist when she was five and furious that mrs. claus didn't get enough credit.}
<A>__{and this makes jacob smile... then...}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{my brother has two daughters. i had winnie and rudy.}
<P>__{(sucking in a deep breath)}
<D>__{and since rudy... you know... well, i've worried about the name. it's something you don't really think about until you hit sixty or so but it's important.}
<A>__{as they walk some more in silence, until...}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{i want you to get my daughter to accept me back into her life again, jacob.}
<A>__{jacob slowly nods... not surprised.}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{because save for the extremely precious and depreciating asset of time... she's all i have.}
<A>__{as gordon stops in front of a georgian style, pre war building and turns to jacob...}
<C>__{gordon gekko }
<D>__{c'mon, i will show you some more pictures of your fiancee that she doesn't want you to see.}
