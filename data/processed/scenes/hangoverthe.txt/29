<A>__{he slowly bow legs himself over.}
<C>__{stu}

<A>__{stu shakes his head, no. then atashir hangs up his phone.}
<C>__{atashir}
<D>__{there is no doug billings at any of the area hospitals, morgues, or police stations.}
<A>__{the guys frown, starting to grow worried.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{maybe he went for a jog?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{dude. it's 120 degrees outside.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{or shopping?}
<A>__{the guys just look at him like: you're an idiot.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{great. so we've officially lost doug. his wedding is in what, 22 hours?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{relax, it's doug, he's probably crashed out on someone's couch right now. all we have to do is retrace our steps from last night, and we'll find him.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{okay, so last night...}
<A>__{the guys wince, trying to remember. it's painful to think.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{well, we started on the roof...}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{right, that was like, 6ish...?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{then...i think...we had steaks at the palm?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{yeah. then...we played craps at the hard rock...maybe?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{that sounds right...}
<A>__{stu throws up his arms, already giving up.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{okay, honestly? i don't even remember going to dinner.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{i vaguely recall...doing body shots ....at some point? is that...maybe?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{i'm pretty much blank after the hard rock.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{i think we went to the flamingo after that...? and then, i just remember a lot of blue light...and the overpowering smell of baby oil.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{so that was what, 10ish?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{give or take.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{was doug still with us?}
<A>__{vick rubs his temples, trying to fight through the hangover.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{yes. yes. doug was with us. i tackled him...for some reason.}
<A>__{the guys nod, okay, okay.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{okay. so we only have a 13 hour window where we could've lost him.}
<A>__{they guys frown. shit. stu puts his hands into his pockets, thinking... then he feels something. a matchbook. he pulls it out. it's from the flamingo nightclub.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{hey! look, we were at the flamingo.}
<A>__{a long beat of silence... then the guys hurry to an empty blackjack table and start emptying their pockets of the detritus from the night before. they find matchbooks, receipts, room keys, a valet ticket...}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{atm receipt from the rio at 10:37 }
<P>__{(reading it)}
<D>__{for 600 dollars?!}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{the valet ticket says we returned here at 4:57am.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{we drove last night?}
<A>__{the guys wince, jesus...}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{here's a receipt from sbarro. the meal was comped for some reason }
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{why do we have a matchbook from the golden pony all male revue?}
<A>__{the guys exchange a look, alarmed.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{someone could've given that to us.}
<C>__{stu}
<P>__{(laughing, nervous)}
<D>__{yeah, totally! there's no way we went there! we're not gay! hahaha!}
<A>__{they frown, then stare at all the clues lined up on the blackjack table.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{i think we should call tracy.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{absolutely not.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{what if doug called her? she might know where he is.}
<A>__{stu shifts uncomfortably, tenderly adjusting his ass.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{yeah, i'm with alan on this one.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{of course you're with alan, you're both gutless cowards. but we're not calling tracy. you never call the bride from the bachelor party. ever. if my balls were on fire and tracy was sitting next door with a tall glass of water, i still wouldn't call her. it's a rule.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{but shouldn't we at least tell her we're gonna be getting home late?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{she has a watch, she'll figure it out.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{i think i'm beginning to see why you're always single.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{and i think i'm beginning to see why you're always a douche }
<C>__{stu}
<P>__{(clutching his ass)}
<D>__{guys, wait. i need your help oh my god like right now. come on.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{jesus, what is it?}
