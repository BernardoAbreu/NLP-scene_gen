<C>__{charade}
<D>__{music by henry mancini, words by johnny mercer}
<A>__{when we played our charade we were like children posing, playing at games, acting out names, guessing the parts we played. oh, what a hit we made. we came on next to closing best on the bill, lovers until love left the masquerade. fate seemed to pull the strings, i turned and you were gone. while from the darkened wings the music box played on. sad little serenade, song of my heart's composing, i hear it still, i always will, best on the bill charade.}
