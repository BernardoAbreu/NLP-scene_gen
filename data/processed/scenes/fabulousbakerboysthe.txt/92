<A>__{jack is sitting in the shadows near the stage, where a trio is playing. he has a drink in front of him, but it is untouched. after a moment, the trio finishes and the pianist, a huge black man named henry, nods to the applause.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{thank you. as most of you know, we like to shake things up here every so often just to keep you people on your toes. so i'm gonna take a little rest, grab myself a drink, and let an old friend sit in. he drops by about once a year just to keep his hands clean. ladies and gentlemen. jack baker.}
<A>__{jack rises to polite applause and shakes henry's hand. as he settles behind the piano, he sits for a moment, not moving, then nods to the two men behind him. as they begin to play, we recognize the music from the record. jack waits, then brings his hands to the keys. as he plays, his face is suddenly calm. peaceful.}
