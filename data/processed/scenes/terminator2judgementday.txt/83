<A>__{john looks around the corner of the "afterburner" ride. sees the cop showing a picture to some of the kids. the kids point his way. john ducks just as the cop glances over. he slinks out the other side of the ride and heads for the back of the store, instinctively retreating. sarah has taught him that cops are bad news. the cop scans the crowded arcade. glimpses john, looking back as he moves around a row of machines. starts toward him. john sees the cop homing in and starts walking fast. looks back. the cop is shoving through clots of kids. one of them is slammed to the floor. as eddy of outrage behind the cop as he gains speed. john breaks into run. so does the cop. kids scatter like ten pins as the cop charges after john. john sprints through the arcade's back officer and store rooms.}
