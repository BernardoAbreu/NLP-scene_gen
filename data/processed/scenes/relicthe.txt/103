<L>__{interior secure storage hallway basement night}
<A>__{pendergast runs into the hallway but he's already too late. the hulking shape of the quadruped is moving at incredible speed. on pendergast... as he levels his gun and shoots. the creature... stops, rears back on its haunches, looks once at pendergast, pissed. as the voices around the far corner fall silent, pendergast fires. the shot blasts off a piece of the wall. with astonishing speed and agility for its bulk, the beast turns and leaps around the corner, passing out of pendergast's sight.}

<D>__{margo! frock! it's coming! run!}
<B>__{around the corner...}
<A>__{are margo and frock... frock holds the keys to secure storage area 1012 in his hand. margo has the flashlight and the crate with the fibers. they can hear the sound of thundering movement.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{look!}
<A>__{margo points her light in the distance and illuminates the beast! it's descending like a freight train. one split second of sheer amazement, then...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{dr. frock! quick!}
<A>__{frock, immobilized in his wheel chair, stares at the monster, like a trapped rabbit looking at a descending hawk. margo grabs his keys from him, fumbles desperately to open the door. it swings wide at last. she grabs the handles of the wheelchair, tugs with all her might. the wheels bump into the door frame but somehow she wrestles the damn thing inside.}
