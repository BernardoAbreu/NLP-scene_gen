<A>__{a line of light boxes illuminate several chest x rays. a dark sinister splotch snakes through both lungs. john stands there, stares at this wall of death with disbelief.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no i've beaten things, insurmountable things, things most people have never even heard of and after all that you think i'm going to be done in by this?}
<A>__{he raises a puny little cigarette. dr. les archer (50) sighs. a delicate bedside manner is not his specialty.}
<C>__{dr. archer}
<D>__{you wouldn't be the first, john.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it can't be that simple. i mean come on, les, you saved me before. you can do it again, right.}
<C>__{dr. archer}
<D>__{this is different. this is aggressive.}
<A>__{john tries to stay cool fails. he trashes the x ray boxes. diseased lungs disappear. doc shakes his head.}
<C>__{dr. archer}
<D>__{twenty years ago you didn't want to be here. now you don't want to leave.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{that's because i know exactly where i'm going this time.}
