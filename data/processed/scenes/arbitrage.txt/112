<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{lift up your shirt.}

<C>__{ellen}
<A>__{oh, don't treat me like an idiot. you've been sneaking off to see her for months. you don't think i know that?}
<C>__{robert}
<A>__{what do you think you know?}
<C>__{ellen}
<A>__{i never cared, really, about your secretaries, your gallerists, whores, whatever you wanna call them. i cared about our home. and now you have brought this to our door.}
<C>__{robert}
<A>__{i did what was necessary.}
<C>__{ellen}
<A>__{no you did what was necessary for you, robert, for your interests.}
<C>__{robert}
<A>__{for my interests?}
<C>__{ellen}
<A>__{yes.}
<C>__{robert}
<A>__{everything i do is for us, for this family, and now you're gonna tell me how to run my business.}
<C>__{ellen}
<A>__{this isn't about your business, this is our life! where do you think we're going tonight? why do you think i've even tolerated this for so long?}
<C>__{robert}
<P>__{(he's had enough)}
<A>__{what you've tolerated? wow!}
<C>__{ellen}
<A>__{i'm glad you find that funny.}
<D>__{goldenrod 4.17.11 98.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{what about me? what about the complaints? the unhappiness? the drinking? the shopping? the trainers? everything! but yes, the charities, the wonderful sainted charities, you know, all the wonderful works that you do. how do you think i've paid for them?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{i didn't ask you because i didn't want you to lie.}
<C>__{robert}
<P>__{(walks off)}
<D>__{it's cause you didn't want to give `em up!}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{but i thought that we had an understanding. and you broke that understanding when you brought brooke into it.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{no, i kept her out.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{when you made brooke complicit when you risked her future and i'm done.}
<A>__{she opens a folder revealing some legal documents, slides them toward him.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{read it.}
<A>__{he crosses to the bed and puts on his glasses. we see the title: "separation agreement" and hold on him reading for a few brief seconds until...}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{"all ownership and voting rights transfer to the miller charitable foundation, to be administered by brooke miller?" did you really expect me to sign this thing?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{you're not following. goldenrod 4.17.11 99.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{apparently not, no. no.}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(like talking to a child)}
<D>__{okay, uhm, the police have been trying to talk me. i assume they want to know where you were that night. and you know what? i'm not gonna lie for you anymore. not unless you sign that.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{yeah, this leaves me with nothing.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{i think you'll find a way to manage. i'm sure you have all kinds of things offshore for a rainy day.}
<C>__{robert}
<P>__{(shakes head)}
<D>__{this is fuckin' crazy.}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(fast)}
<D>__{no, if you sign, then i will tell your lie. i will say you were at home with me that night, all night, together, here, and you'll be free and clear. and the people who need our money will get it. that's my price.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{you're out of your mind. i am not signing that. i will not sign that!}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{well then... i will have to tell them that you came home at four thirty bruised and bleeding...}
<C>__{robert}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{that's fucking ridiculous! what...}
<P>__{(crosses close to her)}
<D>__{are you trying to blackmail me?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{i think we call it negotiating. goldenrod 4.17.11 100.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{you're not gonna win that one. there's no fucking way.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{you know what, it'll cause just enough trouble the kind of trouble that you don't want in fact, according to my lawyer}
<C>__{robert}
<P>__{(paces)}
<D>__{fucking lawyer...}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{it's enough to give them probable cause and then they can subpoena your cell phone, gps, dna,}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{fuck the dna! i'm sick of this!}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{and whatever else they can think of. so really robert what you have is a choice: you can spend the next three years in court and in the tabloids or you can be at your business.}
<C>__{robert}
<P>__{(shakes head)}
<D>__{you won't do it. you won't do this. you won't do it to the kids.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{just try me.}
<A>__{he stares at her, trying to make it work, but he can't.}
<C>__{ellen }
<P>__{(finally cries)}
<D>__{you broke our little girl's heart.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{it's how it all works, ellen. you know that.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{i do, but she didn't.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{she'll be better for it. the world is cold. goldenrod 4.17.11 101.}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(turns and heads out)}
<D>__{then you're gonna need a warm coat.}
<A>__{we hold on robert's face. pre lap bill evans' "my foolish heart."}
