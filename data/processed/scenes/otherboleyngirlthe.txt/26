<D>__{mary! come back! interior corridor outside anne's room night mary leaves the room. tears stream down her cheeks. she runs down the corridor, rushing towards her children.. but as mary goes, we reverse angle to reveal: a figure sits in the shadows by anne's door. someone who has heard everything that has been said..}
<C>__{i}
<D>__{t's jane parker. who turns, holding her head, covering her ears, unable to listen to any more.. interior corridors night mary runs through the corridors in an agitated state. interior mary's room court night mary rushes into her room. she goes to the beds where her children are sleeping. mary gently shakes them awake..}

<D>__{come on, darling wake up.}
<C>__{young henry}
<D>__{where are we going?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{away from here. far, far away. interior anne's bedroom night anne and george stare at one another. anne pours a mug full of mulled wine.. anne takes the first step, and starts unbuttoning her brother's shirt. george quickly knocks back the glass of mulled wine.. ...then gasps as anne puts her hands into his trousers. their eyes meet for an intense moment.. exterior stables night mary and her children ride through the night. interior anne's bedroom night anne and george are making love. silent tears are streaming down george's cheeks visibly traumatised. anne tenderly wipes them away. exterior countryside night mary and her children continue to ride through the night. they gallop, silhouettes against the moon. the faster and further they get away from court, the better. interior anne's bedroom night afterwards: anne and george lie in silence. anne strokes her baby brother's hair. george rocks to and fro. staring at the fire.. interior corridor outside anne's room night jane parker gets to her feet. numb with shock. she stares ahead. momentarily loses her footing. then disappears into the darkness.}
