<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{geel piet}
<D>__{is like this. you see how hard the life is for the people here in prison. only little pleasure they take from this hard life maybe sometimes when no one watching late at night a little smoke. now with the big war in europe tobacco is plenty hard to get outside. inside it is gone. we are the forgotten in here.}

<D>__{no, no. mustn't do that, little baas.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{what geel piet means is it can be dangerous. something the guards might not want the people to have.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{what's wrong with tobacco? why wouldn't they want them to have it?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{what's wrong is people whose job it is to punish. after a little while it is all they know how to do.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{what should i do?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{this is for you to answer.}
