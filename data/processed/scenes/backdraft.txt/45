<L>__{interior burning factory day}
<A>__{inside the smoke is like liquid lead. going by feel, they hump the hose up one staircase after another, crawling on their hands and knees toward a dull red glow. turning a corner, they enter}
<L>__{interior burning factory a vast room day}
<A>__{totally ablaze. brian looks up in wonder at the buffeting waves of flame in the ceiling, at the screeching timbers crumbling to the white hot floor. at the walls howling in bestial agony. it is the most horrifying, and wonderful thing he has ever seen.}
<C>__{axe}
<D>__{wash it to the windows?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{no, we'll hit the son of a bitch head on.}
<C>__{axe}
<D>__{it's gonna flash, stevie. we gotta get behind it.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{nah, listen to it. it's a pussy. it'll just steam on us. it won't flash. go high in the ceiling.}
<A>__{adcox and grindle shrug and pull their helmets down tight, expecting the worst. adcox opens up the nozzle, turning loose a high pressure blast of water into the ceiling. the fire screams in manic anger and heaves a cloud of howling steam that whirls back and bakes them like lobsters. brian gasps for air as swirling ash batters his facemask. a window somewhere explodes. somebody shouts. christ, you can't see anything. stephen hoops in victory.}
<C>__{stephen}
<P>__{(to fire)}
<D>__{i knew you were a pussy! c'mon! steam us!}
<P>__{(to firemen)}
<D>__{let's go!}
<A>__{the chase is on! going for the throat while the fire's confused and defensive, the firemen scramble through the boiling cloud. they hit it in the ceiling, in the walls, forcing it back and back. it howls and claws in anger, furiously throwing cinders and broken timbers in their faces. the walls echo with its screams as it retreats to a corner.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{ya love it, probie?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i'm in heaven, lt.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{hook us up to a stand pipe.}
<A>__{brian runs back to the wall to hook up his hose roll to the building water system. he goes to unscrew the cap with his hydrant wrench but it keeps slipping off the nut.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{jesus, how 'bout man, huh? we're gonna loose this!}
<A>__{brian finally gets it hooked up and runs back.}
