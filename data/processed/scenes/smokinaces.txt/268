<L>__{exterior parking structure nomad hotel same}
<A>__{a gunshot in the distance followed by shrieks darwin tremor snaps his head around at the sound, moving past platoons of cops and feds now rushing that way. his i.d. is out, affording him easy egress. he hops the stairs up, top level, barracuda parked at the rear of the lot. as he approaches...}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{hey...}
<A>__{darwin glances over at...hollis elmore, standing there, skin horribly discolored, disease afflicted. he wears a hooded tourist sweatsuit; "ta hoe, ta hoe it's off to fun we go!" stitched in cursive across the front. he's holding the colt python against his hip.}
<C>__{elmore}
<P>__{(nodding to cuda)}
<D>__{that your car?}
<A>__{darwin, a beat, what to do...hillbilly acumen in overdrive.}
<C>__{darwin tremor}
<D>__{no, i'm confiscating it.}
<P>__{(holding up badge)}
<D>__{f.b.i.}
<A>__{now elmore raises the colt with his good hand, advancing on darwin, moving gingerly, his legs not quite there...}
<C>__{elmore}
<D>__{you're f.b.i.?}
<A>__{darwin tries to stay tight, composed.}
<C>__{darwin tremor}
<D>__{that's right...and i'd advise y'ta lower your weapon sir.}
<A>__{elmore keeps coming.}
<C>__{elmore}
<D>__{you investigating those murders out at the lake?}
<C>__{darwin tremor}
<P>__{(blanching a bit)}
<D>__{ww...uh...}
<C>__{elmore}
<D>__{three men were ambushed and shot, two died and had their bodies tossed into the lake, the other has severe hypothermia, possible dementia and will probably be a multiple amputee by week's end...if he even lives that long.}
<A>__{darwin, uh oh...}
<C>__{darwin tremor}
<D>__{no, i ain't even heard abou }
<A>__{ oops.}
<C>__{elmore}

<P>__{(beat, teeth clenched)}
<D>__{you have any idea how close to death i've been? you understand that i'm dying now? that i've survived bullets and frostbite and raging fever }
<P>__{(holding up hand)}
<D>__{missing fingers and every fucking imaginable horror in between?}
<A>__{darwin...speechless...he's done.}
<C>__{elmore }
<D>__{and i'm asking you now, "is that your car" and you can't even come clean and do me the decency of a straight answer, with the fucking state that i'm in!?}
<A>__{elmore, that colt looking like a cannon this close to darwin.}
<C>__{darwin tremor}
<D>__{yeah, shit hell, you're right. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{elmore}
<D>__{you shot me and murdered my friends.}
<C>__{darwin tremor}
<D>__{i did. we yeah, i know.}
<C>__{elmore}
<D>__{and threw us into the lake.}
<C>__{darwin tremor}
<D>__{pretty much, yep.}
<A>__{elmore, still nodding.}
<C>__{elmore}
<D>__{and this is your car, isn't it?}
<C>__{darwin tremor}
<D>__{mmm hmm.}
<C>__{elmore}
<D>__{but there were more of you?}
<C>__{darwin tremor}
<D>__{yeah, m'brothers...they didn't make it.}

<D>__{two of 'em?}
<C>__{darwin tremor}
<P>__{(nods, tears flow)}
<D>__{thass' right.}
<P>__{(beat, wiping eyes)}
<D>__{i got other brother's though, so it ain't so bad.}
<C>__{elmore}
<D>__{you were here huntin' a man named israel, weren't you? your name is tremor.}
<A>__{darwin gazes up at elmore, some fraternal bond forms.}
<C>__{darwin tremor}
<D>__{i was. it is...that who you was here for? israel?}
<A>__{a pause. elmore nods.}
<C>__{darwin tremor }
<D>__{well...we both got beat out then, didn't we?}
<A>__{darwin, slowly lowering the colt.}
<C>__{elmore}
<D>__{yes we did...}
<P>__{(long pause, then)}
<D>__{now, give me your car keys. and get the fuck out of here.}
<A>__{darwin, sifting through his pockets, tossing elmore the keys.}
<C>__{darwin tremor}
<D>__{s'fair...lemme just grab somethin'.}
<A>__{elmore brings the colt back up. darwin, hands up, hold on }
<C>__{darwin tremor }
<D>__{no, no, no, i'm done with all that.}
<A>__{he reaches in, pulls a joint off the dashboard, forages, finds matches, lights up, starts off.}
<C>__{darwin tremor }
<P>__{(to 'cuda)}
<D>__{probably needs to be tuned. air filter's old. plugs might be bad. heater and ac ain't worked in forever.}
<P>__{(seeing elmore waver)}
<D>__{there's some good drugs in the glove box there, homespun, keep you smiling, semi lucid at leas'...}
<P>__{(beat, puffing away)}
<D>__{well, god's speed t'ya then. sorry 'bout all that. s'way a'the world though, winners and losers y'know. s'way it's always goin' be...}
<A>__{darwin, walking away, taking huge hits off that joint, traipsing down the steps, getting stoned out of his mind. elmore, considering, re considering, looking at that colt.}
<C>__{elmore}
<D>__{...oh, fuck that...}
<A>__{ as he back shoots darwin with all six rounds from the python, blowing holes through him. darwin goes lop sided, legs failing, lit joint still smoking in his mouth as dies standing, only to fall like cut timber seconds later. elmore acts quickly, sliding into the 'cuda and starting it, that big block hemi roaring to life under the hood.}
