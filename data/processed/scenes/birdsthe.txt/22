<L>__{interior annie hayworth's living room med. shot annie}
<B>__{hayworth}
<A>__{in an easy chair, reading. she is wearing a robe and smoking, absorbed in her book. she turns when she hears the front}
<B>__{door opening.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{miss daniels? is that you?}
<C>__{melanie }
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{annie rises to greet her. as melanie enters the shot:}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{hi.}
<P>__{(seeing her face)}
<D>__{is something wrong? is that cut beginning to bother you?}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(touching her head)}
<D>__{no, it's not the cut that's bothering me.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(concerned)}
<D>__{would you like some brandy?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{if you have some, i'd...}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i will get it, sit down, miss daniels. do you want a sweater or something? a quilt?}
<A>__{as annie gets the brandy:}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{no, thank you.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{won't you call me melanie?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{all right.}
<P>__{(she smiles)}
<A>__{med. shot melanie sitting, tucking her legs up under her. she is disturbed by her conversation with mitch and, in fact, by the way this entire trip has worked out. annie brings her the glass of brandy, and she takes it gratefully.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(sitting opposite her)}
<D>__{it gets a little chilly here at night sometimes. especially if you're over near the bay.}
<A>__{melanie nods and sips at the brandy. there is a long pause.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{well, how'd your evening go?}
<A>__{melanie shrugs.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{did you meet lydia?}
<A>__{melanie nods.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{or would you rather i changed the subject?}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(with a tired smile)}
<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{how do you like our little hamlet?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i despise it.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{well, i don't suppose it offers much to the casual visitor. unless you're thrilled by a collection of shacks on a hillside. it takes a while to get used to.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{where are you from originally, annie?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{san francisco.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{how'd you happen to come here?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{oh, someone invited me up for the weekend a long time ago.}
<A>__{there is an awkward pause. annie shrugs.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{look, i see no reason for being coy about this. it was mitch brenner.}
<A>__{melanie nods.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i guess you knew that, anyway.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i suspected as much.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{you needn't worry. it's over and done with. a long time ago.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{annie there's nothing between mitch and me.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{isn't there?}
<P>__{(she shrugs)}
<D>__{maybe there isn't. maybe there's never anything between mitch and any girl.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i think i will have some of that, too.}
<P>__{(she pours brandy, drinks, sighs)}
<D>__{i was seeing quite a lot of him in san francisco, you know.}
<P>__{(she smiles weakly)}
<D>__{and then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet lydia.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{when was this?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{four years ago. of course, that was shortly after his father died. things may be different now.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{different?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{with lydia.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{did she seem a trifle distant?}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{a trifle.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{then maybe it isn't different at all. you know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. i simply couldn't understand it.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{when i got back to san francisco i spent days trying to figure out just what i'd done to displease her.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{and what had you done?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{nothing! i simply existed. so what was the answer? a jealous woman, right? a clinging possessive mother.}
<P>__{(she shakes her head)}
<D>__{wrong. with all due respect to oedipus, i don't think that was the case at all.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{then what was it?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{lydia liked me, you see. that was the strange part of it. in fact, now that i'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{then why did she object to you?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{because she was afraid.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{afraid you'd take mitch?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{afraid i'd give mitch.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{afraid of any woman who'd give mitch the only thing lydia can give him love.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{no, i don't think so. she's not afraid of losing her son, you see. she's only afraid of being abandoned.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{she already has a daughter.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{what about mitch? didn't he have anything to say about this?}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(apologetically)}
<D>__{i can understand his position. he went through a lot with lydia after his father died. he didn't want to risk going through it all over again.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{so it ended. not immediately, of course. i went back to san francisco, and i still saw mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{then what are you doing here in bodega bay?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{you get straight to the point, don't you?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i'm sorry. forgive me.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{no, that's all right, i don't mind. i came up here for two reasons. to begin with, i was bored with my job in san francisco. i was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i did.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{then you know. little girls in brown beanies. deadly. here i have a life. i will go into that classroom on monday morning, and i will look out at twenty five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'yes, please give me what you have.'}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{and i will give them what i have. i haven't got very much, but i will give them every ounce of it. to me, that's very important. it makes me want to stay alive for a long long time.}
<P>__{(she sighs)}
<D>__{that's the first reason.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{and the second?}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{i wanted to be near mitch.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{it was over, and i knew it, but i wanted to be near him, anyway.}
<P>__{(she smiles)}
<D>__{you see, i still like him a hell of a lot. that's rare, i think. i don't want to lose his friendship... ever.}
<A>__{there is a moment of silence. into the silence, the telephone shrills. annie hesitates a moment, and then goes to answer it. close shot annie at the phone.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{hello? oh, hello. no, no, i wasn't asleep. what is it?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{yes, just a little while ago. sure, hold on.}
<P>__{(she turns to melanie)}
<D>__{it's mitch. for you.}
<A>__{two shot melanie and annie as they stare at each other across the room, melanie hesitating.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{he's waiting.}
<A>__{melanie rises and goes to the phone. the camera follows annie to the wing chair in the foreground and stays on her throughout following, recording her reactions as melanie talks to mitch in the background. annie is not devastated by this call, and yet there is a wistfulness to her expression as she realizes she may finally and irrevocably be losing mitch to another girl.}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(at phone; coolly)}
<D>__{hello? yes, this is melanie. fine, thank you. no, no trouble at all. i simply followed the road. it's a very bright night.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{what? oh. well, there's no need to apologize. i can understand...}
<P>__{(pause; she listens)}
<D>__{well...}
<P>__{(she listens again)}
<D>__{that's very kind of you. no, i'm not angry.}
<P>__{(she listens)}
<D>__{i couldn't. i'm afraid i have to get back to san francisco.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{no, i wouldn't want to disappoint cathy, but...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i see.}
<P>__{(she is warming)}
<D>__{i see. well, if you really...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{all right. yes, i will be there.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{good night, mitch.}
<A>__{she hangs up and looks at annie in embarrassment.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{he wants me to go to cathy's party tomorrow afternoon.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i said i would.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i will be going, too, to help out. it should be fun, melanie.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{it seems so pointless.}
<P>__{(she sighs)}
<D>__{i think i will go to sleep. this has been a busy day.}
<P>__{(picking up her paper bag)}
<D>__{my luggage.}
<A>__{she smiles, takes out a flowered muumuu, holds it up to annie.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{pretty. did you get that at brinkmeyer's?}
<A>__{melanie nods and drapes the muumuu over her arm. she is silent for a moment, pensive. then:}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{do you think i should go?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{that's up to you.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{it's really up to lydia, isn't it?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{never mind lydia. do you want to go?}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{then go.}
<A>__{the room is silent. melanie nods, slowly, and then smiles.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{thank you, annie.}
<A>__{suddenly, into the silence, comes a thump at the door, startling them both.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{who can that be at this hour?}
<P>__{(she walks to door)}
<D>__{who is it?}
<P>__{(no answer)}
<D>__{is someone there?}
<A>__{melanie goes to stand beside annie. puzzled, annie unlocks the door, and then opens it. she looks out into the night. there is nothing but the sound of the wind.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(to the emptiness outside)}
<D>__{is anyone there?}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(pointing to the ground)}
<D>__{look.}
<A>__{close shot a dead seagull close shot annie}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(sympathetically)}
<D>__{ohhh. oh, the poor thing. he probably lost his way in the dark.}
<A>__{close shot melanie who stares at the dead bird as annie stoops to pick it up. and then, slowly:}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{but... it isn't dark, annie. there's a full moon.}
<A>__{two shot melanie and annie as annie, stooping, looks up at her. on their puzzlement and consternation:}
