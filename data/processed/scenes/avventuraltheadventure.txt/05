<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{out on the water, sandro and anna are almost at a standstill, keeping themselves afloat with only the slightest movement of their arms. sandro is laughing and joking as though all this purely physical enjoyment of sun and water has freed him of all other cares. anna tries to emulate him but is not entirely successful. every now and then, her face becomes clouded with that same worried expression.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{when do you have to go back?}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{i don't know... it depends on ettore... he's now in the process of negotiating for a contract here in sicily...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{then how come you're not with him?}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{what a question... because i want to be with you, naturally. i hope he doesn't close the deal so he'll leave me alone at least for a few days... isn't this water wonderful!}
<A>__{he is lying on his back in the water, with his eyes closed, his face to the sun, cradled in the gentle movement of the waves. anna looks at him, then after a moment of silence, she says:}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i'd like to find a place where i can get some peace and rest, maybe around here somewhere. i'd like to try...}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{what could be more restful than this?...}
<P>__{(he opens his eyes and is upright in the water)}
<D>__{excuse me, what is it that you want to try?}
<A>__{instead of answering him, anna starts swimming rapidly out to sea. sandro tries to hold her back but because she swims much faster, he gives up and finds himself alongside of giulia.}
<C>__{giulia}
<P>__{(referring to anna)}
<D>__{where is she going?}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{ask her.}
<A>__{giulia is not much of a swimmer; she bobs up and down in the water, doing a crawl, and it seems she is always on the verge of going under. still, she manages to stay afloat, enjoying herself like a little child. slightly off to one side, raimondo is exploring the depths, with his spear gun in hand, ready to shoot. he seems to be chasing a fish that is apparently trying to elude him. but the water is so clear that it would be difficult even for a fish to hide. in fact, only a moment later, raimondo takes aim with his spear gun, pulls the trigger and the little harpoon shoots out. then, with a great splash, he swims off in hasty pursuit of the fish. a rubber raft, piloted by one of the crew and bearing corrado ashore, comes passing through the swimming area. the sailor is carrying on a conversation with corrado.}
<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{i've always worked on pleasure boats... even though it's more tiring.}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{because the owners never seem to have any fixed hours. for example, last night we kept right on sailing... we didn't even have a chance to get some sleep. still, i like it better.}
<A>__{the raft passes alongside of sandro, and corrado calls out to him:}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{i'm going ashore to take a look around the island. there are some ruins up there...}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{there too...}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{well, we're still in italy, you know!}
<A>__{the raft continues on its way towards shore. a little distance away, claudia is floating on her back, basking in the sun, with her eyes closed almost motionless. her arms are outstretched and only the very slightest movement of her fingers in the water is sufficient to keep her afloat. suddenly, her hand comes in contact with something viscous... which seems to be a fish that has shot up to the surface of the water. at first, claudia merely withdraws her hand without bothering to see what it is, but since it persists in following her, she opens her eyes and notices something moving right next to her. frightened, she lets out a tiny yelp. at that very moment, directly behind the fish, raimondo's rubber fins appear above the water, and she realizes that it is raimondo himself. he removes his mask and breaks out into a hearty laugh as claudia playfully splashes some water into his face. observing them from a few yards away is anna. having returned from her swim out in the open sea, she was about to join claudia. but claudia, involved now in chasing after raimondo, doesn't notice her. meanwhile, raimondo, outdistancing claudia, finds himself alongside of sandro.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{what kind of a fish is that?}
<C>__{raimondo}
<D>__{it's a cernia.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{my god, it's enormous.}
<A>__{claudia, having given up trying to catch raimondo, swims up alongside of giulia, who is busy observing corrado disembark on a little strip of beach that stands out distinctly white against the dark rocks. claudia is in a playful mood. she dives underwater, grabs hold of giulia's leg, comes up, and then dives under once again. giulia, caught up in the spirit of all this playfulness, drops her concern with corrado and joins in with the fun and merriment. suddenly there is a loud shriek, then anna's voice is heard screaming:}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{a shark!... a shark!}
<A>__{they all turn around to look at her. anna is swimming furiously towards the boat. then, immediately, the booming voice of the sailor aboard the yacht sounds out:}
<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{don't move, lady... stay where you are... stop! everybody keep still.}
<A>__{but sandro ignores the warning and starts swimming out towards anna like a demon. raimondo, who was about to climb aboard the yacht, grasps his spear gun firmly in his hand, hurls himself back into the water, and also starts to swim in anna's direction. claudia is stricken with fear, and holds on tight to giulia. anna has stopped swimming and is cautiously looking around to see if anything comes up out of the water. then, she looks up and seeing sandro and raimondo approaching, she shouts:}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{stay away!}
<A>__{they both stop. then, raimondo hurriedly dons his mask and disappears under water while sandro again starts swimming out towards anna. sandro comes up alongside her.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{anna...}
<A>__{but anna doesn't say a word. instead, they both swim silently back to the yacht, where claudia and giulia are already climbing aboard. patrizia comes out of the cabin to see what is happening. they all lean over the side of the boat, looking down into the water, expecting the shark at any moment to come into view. but the water remains unruffled, the seaweed below is clearly visible, waving like so many fans. even the rocks at the bottom can be seen with all sorts of small gilled fish darting about. a mysterious, fascinating world and yet, because of what happened, one that arouses fear. everyone aboard is silent. until anna and sandro, followed by raimondo, finally arrive and climb aboard. sandro immediately takes anna to her cabin, and the others follow, making various comments.}
<C>__{claudia}
<P>__{(to anna)}
<D>__{but how did you become aware of it? did it touch you?}
<A>__{anna doesn't answer but continues on ahead amid the overlapping remarks.}
<C>__{giulia}
<D>__{i would have died.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{... and how ugly they are ... with all those teeth...}
<C>__{corrado}
<P>__{(shouting from the shore)}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{giulia}
<P>__{(shouting from the prow)}
<D>__{there's a shark in the area. don't move from where you are!}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{who's moving?}
