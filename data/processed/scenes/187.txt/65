<D>__{oh, you should go sometime, trevor. i think you'd like it. really. it's only an hour by air. maybe five or six by car. completely different attitude from l.a. much more like a real city... like chicago or new york...}
<A>__{as ellen continues talking we see a lowered blue nissan mini truck (with matching shell) pull up next to the bus stop. a cholo from the utility shed hangs out the passenger window and taunts rita. rita immediately stands and walks back down magnolia. the mini truck follows her in reverse. rita halts and begins ranting at the cholo, waving her arms all around. now she stomps away and the mini truck drives away with a lurch.}
