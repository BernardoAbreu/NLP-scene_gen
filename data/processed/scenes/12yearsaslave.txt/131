<D>__{not "sir." just armsby. not owed more than any other in the field. i worked plantations from virginia, down into alabama. i could manage easy a hundred slaves and have done so. but to toil in the field? never thought that would come to pass. never. but times are desperate. where once i had said "no" to epps and his merger offerings, i returned cap}
