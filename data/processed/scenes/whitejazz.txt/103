<T>__{flashback to:}
<L>__{interior 1284 south tremaine past}
<A>__{for the first and only time, we see hector magdalena, alive and well...for the moment...speaking to koenig and wilhite.}
<C>__{koenig }
<D>__{...to accept bradley's deal...}
<A>__{koenig pets hector's twin doberman guard dogs.}
<D>__{koenig (v.o.) (cont'd) ...and although the terms of that deal worked well for him. i found them less than favorable...}
<A>__{koenig draws a silenced pistol and shoots both dogs before shooting a shocked hector twice in the chest. wilhite staggers to his feet as koenig steps over and delivers the coup de grace head shot to hector.}
<C>__{koenig}
<D>__{darktown. chavez ravine. hot spots for human vice. these are slums i run & profit from. if these slums suddenly become stadiums, that profit goes elsewhere...that crime goes elsewhere.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{bradley...you two got greed in common.}
<A>__{koenig grins. junior keeps shifting. dying to shoot him dead.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{you knew about wilhite and lucille. that's how you were operating him.}
<C>__{koenig}
<D>__{i was aware of his sexual predilections.}
<C>__{me}
<P>__{(a scowl for junior)}
<D>__{...and someone else's...}
<C>__{koenig}
<P>__{(that great white grin )}
<D>__{we share an eye for human frailty and we're both born blackmailers dave.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i knew young stemmons here had a fondness for lads, stretching back to his days at the academy.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{and now you're his only ally.}
<P>__{(back at junior)}
<D>__{this sad queer who fell out with cops and flunked out with the feds.}
<P>__{(back to koenig)}
<D>__{so you get this file to battle bradley with. what's junior get in return?}
<A>__{and like he was waiting for those words: junior lunges. i twist to deflect but he's too fast feel something sink and drag in my side. i go down, gouge groping for my gun. instant trauma zaps nerves numb up the arm, fingers failing. then a pain like boiling oil moves through my blood.}
<C>__{junior stemmons}
<D>__{just you! you fuck!}
<A>__{look down, see: a mother of pearl knife hilt in my side, the business end stuck deep. junior laughing as i fall to my knees. he pulls the file from the waist and tosses my .45.}
<C>__{junior stemmons }
<P>__{(two inches from my face)}
<D>__{there's your knife klein!}
<A>__{koenig takes the file, opening it.}
<C>__{koenig}
<P>__{(turning his back)}
<D>__{i don't want to watch...i'm sorry it came to this, dave.}
<A>__{junior, his own .45 pulled, put to my head.}
<C>__{junior stemmons}
<D>__{i hope the bledsoe whore was worth it...'cuz she's still fucked. for a crooked cop, you think small.}
<A>__{koenig reads the file's first page, lifts it...a blank page behind...and behind that one...}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{whatever moves i had left...i just made.}
<A>__{koenig spins back, more blank pages spilling from the file.}
<C>__{koenig}
<D>__{this isn't it!}
<A>__{ junior looks: that's all i need. pull the pig sticker off my ankle and corkscrew it into his calf, twisting. junior bleats slaughtered lamb as i reach up a wrench his gun free. grab his tie, pull him down as i jut his gun up under his chin and fire two shots through the top of his head. haul him down dead by his tie, turn koenig's gun hand flashes to his shoulder. shoot him twice. he goes down gargling `fuck'. stand up on me sea legs, bad wobble weave as i slowly pull the knife from my side, pocket it. feel blood flow saturate my pant leg. this weird wooze overcomes me as i approach koenig. he pulls himself into a sitting position, shaking his head. this bemused, beaten, half grin as he flicks blood from his hand like his fingers had just brushed something sticky.}
<C>__{koenig}
<D>__{poorly played dave...poorly played...}
<A>__{say nothing. keep junior's .45 out. my intention crystal clear: endgame. koenig looks up, this odd squint, like a bum about to beg for change.}
<C>__{koenig}
<D>__{could i talk you into something? cut you in on something?}
<A>__{give him no hope.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{won't work for me fritz.}
<A>__{he nods, remorse, resignation...it at all looks the same now.}
<C>__{koenig}
<D>__{give me a minute then?}
<A>__{i do. watch his hands as he removes his shoes, waiting for an ankle grab, his back up piece...none comes. he sets his shoes aside, gazing up at the starless sky before issuing this short, gruff laugh...some inside joke that will die untold.}
<C>__{koenig}
<P>__{(with a nod)}
<D>__{okay...}
<A>__{...and he holds his last breath and seems completely content as i shoot him. cross to junior now, rifle his clothes, retrieve a hotel key, room 16, read it: motel commodore centinela ave. inglewood, ca}
