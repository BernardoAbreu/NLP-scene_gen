<L>__{exterior ghetto street afternoon}
<A>__{the buildings are crumbling, rusted out cars line the street. a group of black people huddle together in threadbare stuffed furniture on the sidewalk, a fire burning between them for warmth. chance rounds the corner, walks up to them. he stands by them, smiles. they stare back, no sign of friendship in their faces. chance nods politely to them, then walks away down the sidewalk.}
<L>__{exterior ghetto street washington, d.c. afternoon}
<A>__{a group of eight to ten hard core ghetto youths hang out on a corner. other passersby give them a wide berth, they are unapproachable. chance nears the group, approaches.}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(friendly)}
<D>__{... excuse me, would you please tell me where i could find a garden to work in?}
<A>__{they turn to him as one, silent, amazed that this white trespasser would intrude on their jiving.}
<C>__{chance }
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{... there is much to be done during the winter, i must start the seeds for the spring, i must work the soil...}
<A>__{one of the black youths, lolo, interrupts chance.}
<C>__{lolo}
<D>__{what you growin', man?}
<A>__{the leader of the gang, abbaz, shuts up lolo with an elbow and moves menacingly forward.}
<C>__{abbaz}
<P>__{(nose to nose with chance)}
<D>__{... what you doin' here, boy?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{i had to leave my garden. i want to find another.}
<C>__{abbaz}
<D>__{bullshit. who sent you here, boy? did that chickenshit asshole raphael send you here, boy?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{no. thomas franklin told me that i had to leave the old man's house, he's dead now, you know...}
<C>__{abbaz}
<D>__{dead, my ass! now get this, honkie you go tell raphael that i ain't takin' no jive from no western union messenger! you tell that asshole, if he got somethin' to tell me to get his ass here himself!}
<P>__{(edges closer to chance)}
<D>__{you got that, boy?}
<A>__{chance smiles at abbaz and reaches into his pocket.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes. i understand.}
<P>__{(he takes out his remote control tv changer)}
<D>__{if i see raphael i will tell him.}
<A>__{chance points the changer at abbaz and clicks it three times, tries to change the picture. abbaz immediately pulls out a switchblade, whips the blade open.}
<C>__{abbaz}
<P>__{(holds knife at chance)}
<D>__{now, move, honkie! before i cut your white ass!}
<A>__{chance, disappointed that the changer did not work, returns it to his pocket.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes. of course.}
<P>__{(as he leaves)}
<D>__{good day.}
<A>__{abbaz, lolo and the gang watch him go, then begin to buzz with excitement: "who the fuck died?" "why'd he pull that changer on us, man?" "the old man died, must be papa joe!" "he's some weird honkie, man."}
