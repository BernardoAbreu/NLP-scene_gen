<A>__{she thinks about this for a beat. tj is silent.}
<C>__{nicole }
<D>__{i can't believe he called me lady.}
<A>__{tj notices an ice cream cone sitting in a cup holder between the seats.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{i think your ice cream's melting.}

<A>__{tj looks over confused.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{well actually, i basically just didn't want to have to go home and then spend the rest of the day feeling bad about the fact that i didn't help you and then hear about you on the news being beat to death in the parking lot. so you know, really i'm just i did it for me. i'm just selfish.}
