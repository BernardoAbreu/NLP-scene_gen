<L>__{interior the barn day}
<A>__{grace is cleaning stalls, etc... she exits one of the stalls with a pail and stops looking down the barn to where she knows pilgrim is. she places the pail down and gathers her courage. she walks to pilgrim's stall. she stands motionless for some moments before she opens the doors and enters... pilgrim steps back a bit. he looks at her. he pins his ears back. stomps his feet. grace is about to turn and leave, but she stops herself and remains still. slowly, she reaches out to touch pilgrim's head... and he lets her. we see in grace a maturity of character, a willingness to face what she must face... the beginning of a compassion, not only for pilgrim, but perhaps for herself as well.}
