<L>__{exterior street. day.}
<A>__{music slips back in, subtle but tense as we track with nancy as she walks alone down a sidewalk edged with thick flowering oleander. she cocks her head, puzzled, as if sensing something. music mounts. nancy looks across the street. reverse in her pov. a man is over there in dark clothes, reading a newspaper, but really watching her. nancy shrugs and continues on, then stops and looks back again. in her pov we see the man is gone. next moment with a music sting a bloodied hand jumps out from the opposite direction, clamps over nancy's mouth and drags her into the bushes.}
