<L>__{interior suzy's bathroom. night}
<A>__{old linoleum floor. dark curtainless window. one bare light bulb. suzy sits erect in the bathtub staring blankly into space. mrs. bishop washes her with a soapy sponge. suzy's clothes and leather folder are in the corner with the kitten scratching at them.}
<C>__{mrs. bishop}
<D>__{i do know what you're feeling, suzy bean. i've had moments myself where i say: what am i doing here? who made this decision? how could i allow myself to do something so stupid }
<P>__{(with feeling)}
<D>__{ and why is it still happening? we women are more emotional. you have to remember }
<A>__{suzy turns to mrs. bishop and interrupts:}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{i hate you.}
<C>__{mrs. bishop}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{don't say "hate".}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{why not? i mean it.}
<C>__{mrs. bishop}
<D>__{you think you mean it. in this moment. you're trying to hurt me.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{exactly.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i know what you do with that sad, dumb police man. you go to bed with him.}
<A>__{mrs. bishop looks stunned. she says quietly:}
<C>__{mrs. bishop}
<D>__{he's not dumb, but i guess he is kind of sad. anyway, we shouldn't discuss that. it's not appropriate for me to even acknowledge what i already just said.}
<A>__{mrs. bishop sees something sticking out of the leather folder. she pulls it out and stares at it. it is the "coping with the very troubled child" pamphlet. she looks to suzy. suzy looks away. mrs. bishop sighs deeply and says, on the verge of tears:}
<C>__{mrs. bishop}
<D>__{poor suzy. why is everything so hard for you?}
<A>__{suzy starts to cry. she covers her face. her voice breaks as}
