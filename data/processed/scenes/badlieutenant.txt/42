<D>__{game five: lt loses $30,000}
<L>__{ext int: dawn the church convent}
<A>__{lt drives up erratically and parks his car in front of the church convent. lt stumbles into the church. alone now, he notes various aspects of the desecration, but can't see much because he's blind drunk. the enormous, graphically bloody crucifix confronts him. he collapses immediately into a pew. sleeps.}
<B>__{time passes}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{int: morning church convent}
<A>__{lt wakes up. ruckus all around him. the cops are there in force including some of the guys from the bar, the uptown murder and the hospital parking lot. they are privately checking out the scene of the crime, looking for leads that will give them an advantage. everyone wants the two nuns to talk. the nuns are in a circle of interrogators. at first, lt can't even see them. the elderly nun was attacked but not raped. they carved crosses on her. in the background, the questioning has already begun. the interrogators become increasingly frustrated. it can be heard in their voices. they want the reward, and despite a certain constipated "respect" in their attitude the cops are willing to browbeat the nuns to get it. lt silently bums a coffee off a cop and staggers into the ring. lt hangs back in the crowd, staring at the young nun as the cops interrogate both nuns.}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{can't you tell us anything? sisters? anything at all?}
<A>__{the elderly nun speaks up.}
<C>__{elderly nun}
<D>__{they broke my glasses. i didn't see anything, but i did hear them. they were young. and there were two of them. they spoke spanish. one of them was named julio.}
<A>__{lt, on the sidelines, turns to an older cop. lt mutters his commentary}
<C>__{lt}
<P>__{(to older cop)}
<D>__{julio. great. there are 20,000 spics named "julio".}
<A>__{the elderly nun lowers her head. shamed.}
<C>__{elderly nun}
<D>__{i would tell you more if i could. i am so sorry, officers.}
<A>__{now the cops are magnetized by the young nun. she does not appear to need glasses. evidently, she could give the cops what they want.}
<C>__{cop 2}
<D>__{what about you, sister? won't you tell us anything?}
<A>__{lt watches the young nun as pov lt the young nun smiles a quiet, intractable smile. cop 2 is screaming mad, but tries to hide it. lt has observed their interaction. though he would have loved to have heard some information from the young nun, her defiance gives him even more pleasure. the monsignor comes forward to "translate" the nuns' stubborn silence. he is possessed by a conventional sort of ambition this is his big chance. he would like to be cardinal some day, but never will be. he enjoys the spotlight as he pontificates.}
<C>__{monsignor}
<D>__{listen. one nun is nearly 80 years old. i'm not from this church, of course, but i assume they'll be getting her a new pair of glasses. apparently she's legally blind without them. the sister who suffered a rape is just 17. she arrived from ireland only a couple of months ago. this event is just too much for them to take!}
<A>__{the monsignor clears his throat demonstratively, takes a dicitous tone.}
<C>__{monsignor}
<D>__{listen. the church would like to know who did it just as much as the nypd. these arrant criminals broke the laws of man, and the laws of god. the church wants nothing more than to see them behind bars. that's why we're offering the $50,000 reward to whomever brings them in. i'm sure our hero will be one of new york's finest.}
<A>__{the young nun shoots the monsignor an offended look. it appears for a moment as if the young nun makes eye contact with lt. but he can't be sure. lt leaves the crowd, disappears out the door.}
