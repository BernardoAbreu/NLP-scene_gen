<A>__{half uniformed players hang out, eating sandwiches, passing around a playboy magazine, signing souvenir baseballs, and talking at full volume. hip hop blasts from a stereo, competing with an old dukes of hazard rerun on the tv. hardy, the bridgetown swing mascot, passes through with his enormous monkey head under one arm. miguel sits at his locker, psyching himself up for his first start. he touches luis' drawing, which is taped to the inside of his locker. closes his eyes, takes a deep breath.}
