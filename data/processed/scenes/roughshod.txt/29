<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{moving shot. clay, deep in thought, seems unaware of his brother at his side.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{who's lednov?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{a man i used to know.}
<A>__{they walk in silence to the general store and clay goes up the steps and across the porch. steve follows close behind.}
<B>__{full shot}
<A>__{the store is a typical general store of the period, selling everything from buggies to baby clothes. in one corner is the postoffice. the storekeeper, hayes, is unpacking a case of canned goods, stacking the cans on the shelf. clay, followed by steve, enters. hayes glances over.}
<B>__{med. shot}
<A>__{clay crosses to the shelf where the rifle and shotgun shells are kept and takes down a half dozen boxes of 30 30 cartridges.}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{forget somethin', clay?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{shells. how much for six boxes?}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{six times six bits. but wait until i finish this.}
<A>__{besides clay, steve is inspecting a rack of guns.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you might tell a fellow things, 'specially if the fellow's your brother, seems to me.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{like what?}
<A>__{steve picks up a rifle, puts it to his shoulder and squints along the barrel.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{like why you're buyin' a whole slew of 30 30 shells all of a sudden.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i don't want to run short.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you never said this lednov's name before, that i can remember.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{no call to. that jail looked pretty solid to me.}
<P>__{(pointing to rifle)}
<D>__{how's she feel?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{nice.}
<A>__{he pulls the hammer back and snaps the trigger. hayes comes across and takes the gun from him.}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{you know bettern' to do that, steve. unless you're figurin' on buyin' it.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{one he's got, more his size.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{but it's leaded up and anyway a 22's no good for real huntin'. you shoot a man with a 22 and where are you?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{the thing to do is stick to rabbits.}
<A>__{he hands hayes some money for the shells. hayes crosses to another part of the store to get change. clay and steve, who has picked up the rifle again, move over to the counter.}
<B>__{another angle}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{what was he in jail for?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you sure worry that bone. he killed a fellow.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{in a fight?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{the other fellow wasn't even lookin'.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{this is an awful nice gun.}
<P>__{(sighting it)}
<D>__{certainly come in handy when there's men around who shoot people that aren't lookin'.}
<A>__{clay grins. hayes comes up with the change. clay takes out some bills and gives them to the storekeeper.}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(points to rifle)}
<D>__{i may as well buy it for him. otherwise he'll be crying all the way over the hill.}
<A>__{steve's expression shows his gratitude and delight. he covers up with banter.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you must be plenty worried about lednov sneakin' up on us.}
<P>__{(hopefully)}
<D>__{think he will?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{at the ranch maybe?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{maybe at the ranch. maybe sooner than that.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{do you have to be so close mouthed? i'm your brother. and i'm ridin' with you. remember?}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{all right. i will tell you.}
<A>__{he puts one of the boxes of shells on the end of the counter. med. close down angle}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{let's say this is the penitentiary.}
<A>__{he reaches down into one of the barrels in front of the counter. the barrels are filled with beans, nails, dried apples, hardtack, etc. clay takes a handful of beans and makes a trail ending in a little pile.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{here's alder crick.}
<A>__{he puts another box of shells on the other side of the counter.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{and here we are in aspen.}
<A>__{he runs a trail of beans away from "aspen" toward the end of the counter. he runs another trail from "alder crick" to cross the aspen trail. he puts another box of shells on the far end of the counter.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{that's sonora.}
<A>__{he reaches down without looking and brings up a hardtack.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{motioning) lednov gets out of jail and comes along here to alder crick. then goes along here toward the sonora road.}
<A>__{clay drops the hardtack back from where the bean trails cross.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{that's lednov!}
<P>__{(tracing)}
<D>__{we come along here.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{and meet him there.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{unless the sheriff gets too close and he holes up.}
<A>__{he holds out his hand and hayes hands him his change.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{so let's go.}
<A>__{steve tucks his gun under his arm. as he passes the counter, he picks up the hardtack and starts eating it.}
