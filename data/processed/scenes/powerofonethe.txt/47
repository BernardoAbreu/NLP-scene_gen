<L>__{interior marais house}
<A>__{an ample house. pan across a gallery of oil paintings depicting great moments in boer history the great trek, an endless progression of oxcarts heading north, the battle of blood river against the zulu armies, the hang ing of boer farmers by british regulars. women and children herded into a detention camp as their farms burn in the background. boer kommandos sniping at a british column on the veldt. pan from the pictures to photographs, sepia toned, his torical, and dr. daniel marais and pk, strolling past the pictures. marais points to a photo of a young boer, turn of the century, posed stiffly with a rifle in the slouched hat of a boer kommando.}
<C>__{marais}
<D>__{jan piet marais. my uncle. at 22 he led a kommando for three years before your people caught him and hung him.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{my people?}
<C>__{marais}
<D>__{the english.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{i consider myself an african, sir.}
<C>__{marais}
<D>__{as do i. as do the zulu, the xhosa, the pongo, the ndebele. we're all africans. but all from separate tribes, ay?}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{unfortunately.}
<C>__{marais}
<D>__{why do you say that?}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{because it's the whole tribal idea that creates our problems here in south africa.}
<C>__{marais}
<D>__{the problems of south africa, my boy, do not come from tribalism. they come from counter tribalism. from people insisting that natural laws which have been in place and operating since god's creation, should be tampered with. does the gazelle sleep with the lion? does the rhino graze with the mouse? the separation of things is not coincidental. do you think a zulu wants to see his culture, his sense of identity, replaced by someone else's anymore than i do?}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{no, sir. but i don't think he wants being a zulu to mean he is denied the same rights as everyone else has.}
<C>__{marais}
<D>__{which is why civilization is defined by the ability to live under the rule of law. laws define rights.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{but do they define justice?}
<C>__{marais}
<D>__{ah. justice. the banner behind which the english marched as they gobbled up a quarter of the world? justice, my boy, is only relative to who's in charge.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{and how long they stay in charge is only relative to how well they dispense that justice...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{... with all due respect.}
<A>__{marais fixes pk with a stare. pk's eyes meet his evenly, unwavering. maria enters.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{papa, would you like coffee in the library or the parlor?}
<C>__{marais}
<P>__{(pleasant)}
<D>__{the library, mein leib.}
<A>__{maria smiles at pk and exits. he leads pk towards the library.}
<C>__{marais}
<D>__{i can't figure out if you're brave or foolish.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{why is that, sir?}
<C>__{marais}
<D>__{you come here to ask for permission to see my daughter. correct?}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{marais}
<D>__{and knowing who i am, what i stand for, do you think this sort of discussion is going to put that request in a favorable light?}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{i thought a man of your intellectual reputation wouldn't want his daughter seeing someone who didn't think.}
<C>__{marais}
<D>__{let me give you some advice then. you're right. i admire a keen mind. but intellectual reputation or not, i am first a marais, a member of the volk.}
<C>__{marais }
<D>__{and if you're trying to impress a member of the volk with your intellect, don't do it espousing liberal ideas picked up in an english private school.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{these ideas i picked up somewhere else.}
<A>__{marais opens the library door.}
<C>__{marais}
<P>__{(joking)}
<D>__{no doubt from an expert on race relations.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{actually, sir, from an expert on cactus.}
