<L>__{interior workmen's shower evening}
<A>__{a foreman's shower from the old plantation days. the chief steps out of it, refreshed, though still exhausted. lance stands there, about to step in, absolutely filthy, caked with blood. his reaction is odd; rather than just stepping into the shower, he seems almost frightened, reluctant to step in. chef is waiting behind him.}
<C>__{chef}
<D>__{a hot shower, hot damn.}
<A>__{he pushes him forward into the water. the dirt and caked mud go swirling off his face and shoulders, and he relaxes as though he suddenly remenbers what a shower is.}
