<A>__{john is sound asleep. charlotte is awake next to him. she looks at the clock it's three a.m. she slides close to him, kisses his mouth. he grumbles something in his deep sleep, and rolls over. she goes to the couch, stepping over camera equipment. she looks at the fruit basket, decides to try an apple. she has a piece but isn't really hungry. she reaches over some proof sheets and looks at a magazine, but she's already looked at it a few times before. she decides to go downstairs.}
