<A>__{xander's on the floor of a military aircraft. two other tough guys are waking up next to him. one's a greaser named virg, the other is t.j., ex navy. xander notices as they each pull out chrome darts. they sit up, looking at each other. xander chuckles.}
<C>__{virg}
<D>__{what's so damn funny?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{been to any good diners lately?}
<A>__{the three laugh, realizing they're all in the same boat.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{we must be the final "candidates".}
<A>__{they quiet down as they notice for the first time, they are}

<A>__{sitting silently on benches facing them are soldiers dressed in black. they wear black masks over their faces. they are a nasty looking black ops team.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{nobody told me this was a costume party.}
<A>__{the black ops team, just stares.}
<C>__{t.j.}

<C>__{virg}
<D>__{heads up, man. what's this thing on my back?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{a parachute. this does not argue well.}
<A>__{then the red light switches to green. one of the soldiers opens the jump door. the rest of the team advances on xander, virg and t.j.}
<C>__{virg}
<D>__{this is bullshit! hey!}
<A>__{they drag virg to the door and throw him out. t.j. goes next, kicking and fighting. then they turn on xander.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i get the picture.}
<A>__{xander jumps out on his own. we see him tumbling away from the airplane. far below his chute blossoms open.}
<L>__{exterior a field twilight}
<A>__{we see three chutes coming down. the first two hit hard. we rocket in on the last chute as xander lands like a pro. the other guys run up to him. then they hear shouting in}

<C>__{virg}
<D>__{jee zus, man! what the hell now? another damn test?}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{we should head for those trees.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{don't look at me, brother. it's every man for himself.}
<A>__{they wrestle out of their chutes and push past each other as they take off in different directions. xander runs low down a culvert. there's shouting all around. he flattens down and crawls up over the rise. what he sees stuns him.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{you gotta be kidding me.}
<A>__{we crane up to reveal a field of pot plants. there's a cocaine processing plant along the field's edge. the whole place looks exactly like a central american drug farm. narco terrorists run around with ak 47's. xander sneaks past equipment covered in camouflage netting. a squad of narcos runs by and xander makes his move. he rounds another pile of equipment and comes right into the headlights of a truck. narcos hop out and charge forward. xander raises his hands.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{you boys are too good for me. guess i failed this one, huh?}
<A>__{they grab him and haul him away.}
<L>__{interior torture room night}
<A>__{we see a rusty meat hook. a chain is wrapped around it. attached to the chain, his arms over his head, is xander. he's in the middle of a bleak looking room. there are bloodstains on the wooden walls, the floor strewn with filthy}
<B>__{hay.}
<A>__{behind him against the wall xander sees t.j. and virg both hog tied.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{so much for "every man for himself". nice to see you again, fellas.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{they really went all out on this one. this is a pretty gnarly setup.}

<A>__{there's a blood stained towel covering a table near the door.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{this oughta be good.}

<C>__{xander}
<D>__{this must be el jefe. how's it goin' jefe? some weather we're havin'.}
<A>__{narco guards bring in one of their parachutes and toss it on the floor. they exit, closing the door behind them. jefe goes to the table throws back the towel. beneath it are hideous, blood encrusted torture devices: a hack saw, a bolt cutters, knives, chisels, a blow torch.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{what's on the menu tonight? the old blowtorch to the family jewels routine, i will bet. hey, you want roasted nuts, let's break out the planters.}
<A>__{t.j. and virg both crack up. jefe gives them a withering look.}
<C>__{jefe}
<D>__{do you know what we do with people come round here? you know what we do with people come in our business?}
<A>__{jefe passes his hand over the various tools. he finally settles on a crude machete. he walks amongst them brandishing it.}
<C>__{jefe}
<D>__{we cut the achilles tendon. your feet flop around like a marionette. you ain't walkin' nowhere no more. sound good, tough guy? or maybe instead you wanna tell me something.}
<A>__{he stops in front of xander.}
<C>__{jefe}
<D>__{whatchu doing here?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{oh, i don't know. it was an accident.}
<C>__{jefe}
<D>__{that's some accident, hombre. you accidentally fall out of a plane in the middle of the night and land up in my back yard.}
<A>__{he backhands xander across the face.}
<C>__{jefe}
<D>__{we seen this kind of parachutes before, you know. u.s. army. you got some friends here, jump out with you guys?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{we're anti social. we don't have any friends.}
<A>__{jefe slaps him again.}
<C>__{jefe}
<D>__{no friends, huh? that's funny, i don't know no u.s. army that comes without no friends. that's cuz u.s. army is pussies. they always come with the five hundred guys and the helicopters and the see in the dark glasses. so don't you tell me you all alone out here, my friend. you bullshitting the wrong guy.}
<A>__{xander looks over at t.j. and virg.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{who's writing this dude's dialogue?}
<C>__{virg}
<D>__{he's a pretty good actor, though.}

<D>__{you ain't begun to see crazy yet, amigo.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{we're on to the game, ese. you got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... it's all very cute. but come on, let's quit while you're ahead. i'm only trying to save you a beatin'.}
<C>__{jefe}
<D>__{you saving me? you talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.}
<C>__{xander}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{alright. you wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.}
<C>__{jefe}
<D>__{now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. now i'm gonna take the whole foot off. whatchu think of that?}
<A>__{a low thumping is heard outside. it's the sound of approaching helicopters, lots of them. then the night erupts in gunfire. it sounds like a full scale assault outside.}
<C>__{jefe}
<D>__{what's that, eh? i thought you didn't have no friends!}
<A>__{jefe goes into a fury. he swings his machete at xander's legs. xander jumps up, grabbing on to the chain above, and kicks jefe in the chest. jefe falls back and xander climbs up to the roof beam. he grabs onto the beam with his legs and unhooks his chain from the meat hook. he drops down, six feet of chain still hanging from his cuffed wrists, and jefe comes charging at him. xander dodges a few wild swings. he grabs jefe's pant cuff and dumps him on his ass. jefe scrambles to his feet, drawing his pistol. xander swings his chain and whips the gun out of jefe's hand. with another swing he wraps the chain around jefe's neck and pulls it taught.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{keys. you got 'em?}
<A>__{jefe nods, choking, and reaches into his pocket.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{hand 'em to me.}
<A>__{instead jefe hurls them out the window.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i hope you're getting paid extra for this.}
<A>__{xander jerks the chain, slamming jefe head first into the wall. jefe drops, knocked out. outside it sounds like a full scale firefight. xander gets the machete and cuts the ropes holding t.j. and virg. then a hail of bullets sprays through the room. all three guys hit the deck but t.j. gets shot. he clutches his side, blood all over his hands.}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{i'm hit! i'm hit!}
<C>__{virg}
<D>__{they're shooting for real! this is all real.}

<D>__{it's like you said, every man for himself.}
<A>__{virg bolts for the door.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{that only works if you're a man!}
<L>__{exterior drug farm night}
<A>__{narcos are shouting, running to and fro. tracer rounds cut through the air. they are trying to repel an unseen assault force. overhead six military helicopters buzz the compound like apocalypse now, their night suns lighting up the place. xander comes out of the torture building holding t.j. in a fireman's carry. his hands are still cuffed, the length of chain dragging. xander crouches behind some equipment, putting t.j. on the ground.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{you alright?}
<C>__{t.j.}
<D>__{i used to be a seal, it's not the first time i've been shot. thanks, man.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{keep your head down, i will be right back. i'm gonna steal us some wheels.}
<A>__{xander moves on, finds cover under the camouflage netting. he can see narcos shooting into the trees at the unseen enemy. looking the other way, he spots virg running back his way. he's been corralled by one of the helicopters. he's zigzagging, trying to stay out of the beam of it's night sun. xander darts out and grabs him, pulling him under the camouflage netting.}
<C>__{virg}
<D>__{they're all over the place! what the hell's going on?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{looks like we're in the middle of the drug war.}

<C>__{xander}
<D>__{alright mr. free for all, you go that way, i'm gonna go this way. they can't follow us both.}
<A>__{they squat down in runners stances, the helicopter kicking up dust all around them.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{go!}
<A>__{they jet off in opposite directions. xander books, running for all he's worth. his cuffed hands and the dangling chain make it difficult. he's heading straight into the field of pot plants. suddenly the massive spotlight picks him out.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{the chopper swoops down after him. its big gatling guns turn, aiming right at him. braaaaaaaappp! the guns cut loose, tearing up the ground right behind him. xander sprints, the chopper after him like cary grant in "north by northwest", except instead of corn fields, xander's running through a field of huge marijuana plants. xander hits the deck and the chopper soars over him. xander cuts over a couple rows and hunkers down amongst the plants. all around him it's a chaos of helicopters and gunfire. two choppers attack the factory building, blasting it with their guns. narcos run terrified. xander notices a fat purple bud on the plant right in front of him. he snaps it off.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i'm gonna need to hit the trees after a night like this.}
<A>__{he tucks it into his shirt and takes off through the pot}
<B>__{forest.}
<A>__{xander finally spots a vehicle. it's a truck laden with bails of cocaine. he heads for it. then the spotlight finds him again and the chopper swings around. the gatling guns rip the plants to pieces all around him. xander hauls ass, heading for the truck. bullets chew up the dirt all around him. as the helicopter passes overhead, it's guns rake the truck. there is a flash as the gas tank goes up. whoooopphh! a supernova of fire and high grade coke erupts into the night air. xander dives into a drainage ditch. he tumbles down into}
<B>__{filthy water.}
<A>__{a powdery cloud washes over him, dusting the trees white. near him is a big drainpipe leeching sewage. xander crawls inside. the chopper makes another pass overhead. the big spotlight plays over the area, then moves on. xander gives a sigh of relief. he crawls out of the drainpipe. jeeps race by on the road right above him as military men flood the compound. there's no going back. xander turns and makes his way along the tree line. the chopper and gunfire are in the distance now. things are quieter here and he starts to relax. bad idea. as he goes by, one of the trees moves. he takes a few more steps and the grass he just walked on explodes upwards. arms reach out, tackling xander from behind. another team of black ops soldiers bursts from the weeds, the bushes, all perfectly camouflaged like the landscape. they fall on him like a curtain. xander's p.o.v. soldiers hold him down while a black hood is pulled over his head.}

<L>__{interior airplane hanger day}
<A>__{as the massive hanger doors close we can see choppers taking off and landing. mexican soldiers load jefe and his narcos onto a federale bus. virg resists and is beaten. t.j. can be seen being loaded into an ambulance. the hanger doors slide shut with a thud. we see xander's hands as the chains are cut away. xander sits in a chair with the black hood still over his head. he blinks when the hood is torn off. a black ops soldier smirks as he walks away. xander looks around, sees the black ops team unpacking some strange gear. two of them are dumping bottles of a clear liquid into a rusty clawfoot bathtub.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{nice of you to draw me a bath. is it saturday already?}
<A>__{the black ops guys grin knowingly. on the other side, xander sees a flight crew readying a gulfstream for travel. gibbons steps up from behind him.}

<A>__{xander gets up and gibbons leads him on a stroll around the}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{you've really got me confused, cage. on the one hand you showed leadership, courage under fire, a willingness to protect men you hardly knew... and on the other you have an arrest record that pegs you as near sociopathic. help me out here. i'm not following your evolution.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{you want the cheap backstory? the runaway mom, the suicide dad and the foster homes? gimme a break. you're not interested in my past, you're interested in my future as some kind of spy.}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{you're perceptive too. i forgot to add that to the list of surprises. i'm with the national security agency. and unlikely as it may sound, i need your help.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i'm not interested. i've already got a job.}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{you're an adrenaline junkie with one foot in the penitentiary. you risk your ass building a daredevil myth that means nothing and you're not getting any younger.}

<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{that's too bad. i thought a guy like you would appreciate the challenge.}
<A>__{as they walk by the black ops guys, xander sees they're getting busy. one spreads out a plastic dropcloth. another plugs in a bone saw.}

<D>__{what's this? you're gonna try to scare me now?}
<A>__{gibbons grabs a chicken leg from a guy eating lunch.}
<C>__{gibbons}

<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{there's nobody back home who's gonna ask questions if you just... disappear for a while.}
<A>__{in seconds the entire leg has been consumed, leaving only a oily cloud of residue. gibbons eyes him coldly, nailing the point home.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{now i'm the one who's nauseous. so what's the deal? what do you need me for?}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{there's some folks i want to keep tabs on. dirty, tattooed, uncivilized. your kind of people.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{what do i get out of it?}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{if you find out what i want to know, and if i'm able to successfully use that information, you get to go back to your degenerate little life. if not, you take a bath.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{you're one sick bastard. a sadist with a badge looking to rope me in to a suicide mission. i think no matter which way i go i'm likely to wind up face down on a sheet of plastic. so here's my answer: kiss my ass, hop along.}
<A>__{gibbons kicks the back of xander's leg and dumps him on his ass. gibbons was so quick, xander never saw it coming. the black ops guys clap and cheer, always interested in a fight.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{not bad for a gimp.}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{what's with that "x" on the back of your head? does that mean you're "extreme"? i've got some news for you, mr. x, you're a three time loser. so maybe you should tattoo another couple of x's on your head.}
<A>__{xander gets up.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i will take that under advisement. maybe i can be like you and lose a leg for the old stars and bars. i bet the flag's a great comfort every time you need help climbing stairs.}
<A>__{gibbons lunges and grabs xander's throat in the vice like grip of his thumb and middle finger.}
<C>__{gibbons}
<D>__{one twitch and my finger and thumb will meet inside your esophagus. believe me, mr. x, i've put foot to ass for my country on many occasions and i don't feel the urge to stop just yet. so think carefully before you tell me: is "kiss my ass, hop along" your final answer?}

<A>__{a guard patrols the rocky grounds outside the castle. he stops for a smoke when xander walks right up to him. whack! with two quick blows he knocks him out and keeps walking. he's a man on a mission. he runs in a low crouch to the smooth castle wall. there's no hand holds, it's, a perfectly flat climb. a canyon of rocks is below. xander reaches into his jacket and pulls out the "terminator" climbing claws. he pulls on the metal gloves and claws into the solid rock. just like that he starts scaling the vertical surface. we see him outlined against the mountains, steadily making this impossible climb. at the top is an overhang. it's a gnarly transition. as he's rounding it, his feet slip. his legs dangle over the rocky chasm below. using all his strength, he pulls himself up the rest of the way with his climbing claws. at the top a guard leans over, aiming his gun at him. xander grabs him and pulls him over the edge. the guard falls into the chasm. xander rolls onto the parapet, exhausted. then another guard rushes him, grabbing for his rifle. xander springs, the claws lashing out, and tears the gun from his hands. with the other hand he slashes, taking the guard down. he pulls off the claws and heads into the guard tower.}

<D>__{so all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{easier than that, buddy. i will get them to destroy each other. you kill an entire peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. then our friend ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. london, cairo, beijing... pretty soon everyone's involved. these guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. soon the whole world is like your wild west cowboy days. no rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.}

<C>__{petra}
<D>__{fantastic options.}
<A>__{at the riverbank yorgi and kirill pull ahab off the truck and prepare for launching. they remove it from it's box and carry it waist deep into the water. yorgi opens a panel and works feverishly on ahab's insides.}

<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i guess the surgeon general was right.}

<D>__{use your grenades! maybe we can blow it up underwater!}
<A>__{they're heading into downtown prague now, the riverbank getting more and more populated. yorgi is closing fast. down below them petra can see the white streak of ahab beneath the water.}

<D>__{there it is! hold it steady!}
<A>__{petra pulls the pin on a grenade. she tosses it out in front of ahab. whoomph! a jet of water goes up, but too far behind. she pulls another pin and is ready to throw when yorgi's boat pulls up alongside. yorgi aims and fires and the bullet grazes petra's arm.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{petra!}
<A>__{she loses her grip and the grenade bounces down into the engine compartment. xander grabs petra and jumps. together they land in yorgi's boat. the grenade explodes and their boat slams into a bridge support and shatters. they are in the heart of the old city now. we see piazza's full of tourists, markets packed with locals, children playing in front of cathedrals. and on the river yorgi and xander battle it out while petra steers the boat.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{xander! it's coming up!}
<A>__{xander glances down, sees ahab nearing the surface. yorgi clobbers him and xander falls to the edge of the boat. petra tries to help, but yorgi slugs her in her wounded arm. xander can see ahab just a few inches under as yorgi grabs him from behind in a chokehold.}

<D>__{no you don't.}
<A>__{he pries the first rocket off it's launcher. the thing is beeping menacingly. in slo motion xander blinks at the liquid death in his hands. he looks over at petra. she's shouting at him, but he doesn't hear a thing but his own heartbeat. he looks the other direction, to the mass of people on the bridge above him. total strangers... the fate of the whole world is in the hands of a former nihilist. through the crowd, xander sees gibbons break through with his squad of agents. gibbons and xander make eye contact. then yorgi lunges onto his back, trying to pull him into the water. xander hits buttons on the control panel and ahab starts to dive.}
