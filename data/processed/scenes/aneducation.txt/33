<L>__{interior danny's flat. day}
<A>__{a beautiful, large, airy sitting room in the first floor flat in bedford square. the flat is unusually and tastefully decorated, opulent and indicative of bohemian good taste. jenny is sipping a glass of white wine and walking around the room enthralled, looking at danny's existing pre raphaelite art collection; he has three or four big paintings proudly displayed on his walls. danny is talking her through them while helen and david, sitting on the sofa, watch david proudly, helen impassively.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{a couple of years ago you could pick these up for fifty quid, you know. nobody was interested.}

<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{that's not a lockey hill!}
<C>__{danny}
