<D>__{and we're back with our next guest. a year ago he was a survivor of the high hopes hospital mass murder when cleaner lisa templeton ran amok with a rifle, claiming six victims and injuring many others. doctor elliot mixter has written a new book entitled 'shattered hopes' which provides an account of that fateful night as well as some background into the mind of the murderer. doctor mixter, good morning.}

<D>__{morning katherine, how are you?}
<C>__{presenter}
<D>__{i'm good thank you. so doctor, can you tell us a little more about the book?}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{well, it features a blow by blow account of the evening. it was obviously a very harrowing experience and for me it was rather therapeutic to deal with my feelings about what happened in writing.}
<C>__{presenter}
<D>__{how has it affected the hospital doctor?}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{obviously we were all left very numb by events for a long time and i know a lot of people in the town felt we should close the institution. but that never occurred to me. i feel that people should be brought closer by tragedy and the staff and i have definitely become closer, both as colleagues and friends, since the incident. that bond makes for a better institution in my opinion, so we will continue to go from strength to strength.}
<C>__{presenter}
<D>__{you mentioned there that some people wanted the place to close. i know many were also resistant to the opening of the institution in the first place given that it was built on the site of the infamous house, where ronald defeo murdered his family in the seventies. i know a lot of people associated with that case were accused of exploiting it for their own ends. you've also faced some criticism for that, particularly as we heard last week that you have sold the movie rights to this book. how do you respond to that criticism?}
<C>__{mixter}
<D>__{well i know that some people accuse me of hurting the memory of the victims but i feel i'm helping the memories of those involved live on. granted, some victims were criminally insane but other victims were loyal staff who had families and i'm determined that they not be forgotten. each staff member gets their own chapter in the book so that the readers can get a full picture of what wonderful people they were. i always say that all forms of media, whether it be books, newspapers, tv or movies, are a preservation of life. our physical bodies may die but our images live on when we are famous. our work and our passion is preserved, therefore it's as if our souls are preserved. through all of these forms of media we are, in effect, immortal.}
