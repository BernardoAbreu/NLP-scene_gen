<A>__{the photos include a sepia tone portrait of an italian immigrant family... a b&w snapshot of roberta, a nine year old girl playing violin in front of a refrigerator (1950)... ...roberta and her dashing italian father, hand carving a wooden music stand... a b&w snapshot of roberta in a communion dress... roberta at 15, playing violin in front of the same refrigerator, eyes on the music stand... ...a color photo of two cute blonde little boys building a sandcastle on a beach... a color photo of a groom in a white naval uniform and his pretty bride, (roberta at 25), her hand over his as they cut their wedding cake with a sword... ...a color photo of roberta and her husband greek dancing with another couple at an outdoor taverna. roberta's husband and the other man's sexy wife are exchanging a slight smile... hold on this last photo as we now see the album open on the floor of a bedroom, as if it's been tossed. we are:}
<L>__{interior guaspari household, rome, n. y. bedroom day (1988)}
<C>__{woman's voice }
<D>__{wake up, roberta!}
<A>__{we hear the sound of knocking as the camera pans a small, darkened guest room. a few streaks of daylight filter through venetian blinds.}
<C>__{woman's voice }
<D>__{come on, bert get out of bed!}
<A>__{the camera finds a woman lying face down on a twin bed, thick wavy hair sprawled across her shoulders.}
<C>__{woman's voice }
<D>__{please, bert you need to get out of that bed.}
<A>__{the knocking continues, and she puts the pillow over the top of her head.}

<L>__{interior guaspari bedroom day}
<A>__{the woman roberta guaspari demetras (38) retrieves the photo album from the floor, looks at a photo and removes it. she's a beautiful woman with large, expressive eyes, but right now she looks like hell. she stares at the photo it's the two couples dancing. a quick glimpse of hurt on her face, then her jaw tightens and she rips the picture in half. there's muffled talking outside the door, and then two young boys' voices.}
<C>__{boy's voice }
<D>__{can you come out now, mommy? please?}
<A>__{she puts the half with her and her husband on the dresser, then tears the woman off the other half and rips her into pieces.}
<P>__{boy #2 (o.s.)}
<D>__{mommy, nick broke my crayon!}
<P>__{boy #1 (o.s.)}
<D>__{well, lexi hit me and he almost broke... he almost broke my ear!}
<A>__{o.s. arguing "i did not!" "yes you did!" "liar!" etc. as if that one action siphoned all her energy, roberta returns to bed, gets into fetal position, and stares at a point beyond the wall, ignoring the o.s. voices.}
<C>__{woman's voice }
<D>__{hear that? your boys need you.}
<L>__{exterior guaspari house doorway day}
<A>__{assunta guaspari (58), roberta's slender, tired italian american mother, stands in the doorway of a well tended working class home, addressing a young naval officer who holds a lengthy delivery inventory. it's a gray day with ominous storm clouds. late 70's cars are parked on the street.}
<C>__{assunta}
<D>__{but i have no room for this!}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{i'm sorry, m'am. we have orders to deliver these.}
<A>__{assunta looks beyond the man, dismayed.}
<B>__{her pov}
<A>__{large wooden crates cover her front lawn, and two movers plant down another. they hurry back to the truck, grabbing the next crate too quickly this time. it slips from their hands, crashes to the ground and splinters open. several violin cases spill out. the crate looks like it holds a whole lot more.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{instantly a second story window is flung open, and roberta sticks her head out, a hundred times more energized than we've seen her so far.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{watch it, you idiots! be careful with those!}
<A>__{the men scramble to pick them up. assunta looks at all the violins, then up at roberta.}
<C>__{assunta}
<D>__{why so many?}
<A>__{roberta disappears inside and slams the window shut.}
<L>__{interior guaspari living room day}
<A>__{the living room is filled with boxes shipped from greece, labelled by the u.s. navy. and on the floor, in the middle of the boxes, are fifty violin cases of various sizes, also with greek and u.s. navy labels. nick (7) and lexi (5) climb over the boxes as if they were giant blocks.}

<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{mommy, which box has our toys?}
<L>__{interior guaspari hallway continuous}
<A>__{roberta's on the phone, yelling at someone. she's still in the same ratty nightgown.}

<D>__{look, i know he's there, so quit lying to me!... then check under lana holden mrs. lana holden... fine. just tell lieutenant demetras that his wife called and }
<A>__{assunta grabs the phone from her hand and hangs it up.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{ma!}
<C>__{assunta}
<D>__{no. i want you to listen to me. you can't keep doing this to yourself or to the boys. they need their mother now. you're a beautiful, talented woman and you have your whole life ahead of you.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{if i'm so beautiful and talented, why did charles leave me?}
<C>__{assunta}
<D>__{because charles is a big jerk.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now get dressed.}
<A>__{she exits, leaving roberta to mull over her words.}
<L>__{interior guaspari kitchen day}
<A>__{coffee is brewing and homemade cinnamon rolls are cooling on a rack. we recognize the kitchen from the home movie footage. as assunta clears the boys' breakfast dishes from the table, roberta enters. she's dressed, but hasn't put on makeup or done much with her hair. it's a start.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{you really think charles is a jerk?}
<C>__{assunta}
<D>__{from the day you married him.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{why didn't you say something?}
<C>__{assunta}
<D>__{since when do you listen to me?}
<A>__{roberta half smiles, pours herself some coffee, then sits down at the table.}
<C>__{roberta}
<P>__{(sighs, then)}
<D>__{what am i gonna do?}
<C>__{assunta}
<D>__{first, you eat breakfast. second, you go out and get a job any job. your boys, god bless em, are good eaters but i can't afford it.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{mama, he's gonna get tired of her you'll see.}
<A>__{assunta's face shows she's doubtful about this.}
<C>__{assunta}
<D>__{well in the meantime, get a job.}
<L>__{interior department store gift wrap counter rome, n.y. day}
<A>__{roberta is behind the counter, meticulously wrapping a present with ribbons, bows and stickers. at one point she even unties a ribbon and redoes it because it's not perfect. she looks pretty, but she's dressed conservatively, like a navy housewife. there's only one other clerk wrapping gifts and a long line of impatient customers. a male supervisor appears behind roberta.}
<C>__{supervisor}
<D>__{just wrap. you're not picasso.}
<A>__{he exits, and roberta quickly tries to finish her task.}
<C>__{male voice }
<D>__{picasso would probably put the bows on the back of the box.}

<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{i thought you moved away.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i did. i'm in town for my mom's birthday.}
<A>__{he holds out his hand. roberta misunderstands the gesture and tries to shake his hand.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{no that's her gift.}
<C>__{roberta}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{oh! sorry.}

<D>__{i heard you had a book published. i didn't read it but...}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{that's o.k. my parents didn't read it either. it looks good on their coffee table, though.}
<A>__{roberta smiles.}
<C>__{brian}

<A>__{roberta sits opposite brian. her lunch is untouched.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{my college professors said it was too late i hadn't had enough training to be a concert violinist. so i got a teaching degree instead.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i will bet you're a great teacher.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{i think i am. it's just that...}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{see, every time i'd get started somewhere, charles would be transferred... then i had my kids and took time off to raise them... and then when i decided to teach again, no one would hire me 'cause you can't count on a navy wife to stick around. i finally decided i'd start my own program charles gave me the money and i bought fifty violins from this little greek shop got started at a private school and then...}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{your husband ran off with your best friend.}

<P>__{(a few beats)}
<D>__{i wake up one night it's like one in the morning and he's not in bed. i go outside and our neighbor this old greek guy is sitting out there, smoking a cigar, so i ask if he's seen my husband. "he's taking a walk with the other officer's wife," he says. "he takes a walk every night with the other officer's wife."}
<A>__{a beat as she gets lost in the memory. she takes a bite of a french fry.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{god, these are cold.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{so you're just gonna wrap presents and wait for him to come back?}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{you sound like my mother.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{that's not very sexy.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{are you trying to be sexy or be my friend?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{a little of both.}
<A>__{roberta smiles, blushing a bit. brian looks at her, getting an idea.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{you know, i know this really cool lady who runs this elementary school i wrote a piece on her. it's a public school, but it's alternative she might be able to create some kind of gig for you. let me give her a call.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{great!}
<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(takes his last bite of sandwich)}
<D>__{if she hires you, though, you have to be willing to relocate.}

<D>__{where is it?}
<L>__{exterior spanish harlem, new york city travelling shot day}
<A>__{a salsa song plays over as we see stores with spanish names and signs; black and latino elementary school children walking home from school; some burned out buildings; black and latino teens playing basketball on a cement court; spanish graffiti on walls; elderly women buying fruit at a produce stand. pull back to reveal this is the pov of roberta from the back seat of a cab. the salsa song plays on the cab's radio. roberta looks scared shitless. suddenly, two young men flash down the middle of the street, dart in front of the cab and the driver slams on the brakes, jerking roberta forward.}

<A>__{janet williams, a black woman (40's) with a kind face, sits behind her desk and looks at roberta's resume. a sign on her desk indicates that she's the director. also on the desk is a framed picture of janet, her husband, daughter (14), and son (12). roberta sits nervously in the chair opposite her.}
<C>__{janet}
<P>__{(looking at resume)}
<D>__{aside from half a term in a private school in greece and a year teaching chorus in hawaii ten years ago it doesn't look like you've had any other teaching experience.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{well, not traditional teaching experience. i've been doing private lessons...}
<A>__{janet looks for this on the resume.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{it's not on there... i taught my sons.}
<A>__{janet smiles politely.}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{i'd like to help you, mrs. demetras. brian spoke highly of you and i told him i'd consider starting a violin class... but without the proper qualifications, and without any experience in an inner city school...}

<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{as roberta opens the door, we see that nick and lexi are with her. all three have violins. inside, janet's in conversation with dennis rausch (38), an uptight man with a tie that doesn't match his suit jacket. he's showing janet a large scheduling chart.}

<D>__{i'm sorry to interrupt, but i wanted you to meet my sons nick, lexi...}
<A>__{they enter.}

<D>__{if i could just show you something it'll only take a minute.}
<A>__{before janet can answer, roberta and the kids quickly take out their violins and get into position. janet and dennis exchange a look.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{are we having a talent show? i should have brought my tap shoes.}
<A>__{roberta ignores the jab, then nods to the boys. the three of them begin an incredibly impressive violin trio, playing an etude in three part harmony. for the first measures, janet's still annoyed by the intrusion, but she's quickly won over. dennis watches impassively. roberta and the boys finish their piece; janet applauds and dennis joins in to be polite. the three take bows. a beat.}

<D>__{will you hire her now?}

<D>__{i can. any child can learn the violin.}
