<L>__{interior thaddeus stevens's office in the capitol evening}
<A>__{the room's redolent of politics, ideology (a bust of robespierre, a print of tom paine), long occupancy and hard work. on the wall opposite a massive desk hangs a faded banner: "re elect thaddeus stevens, republican ticket, 9th congressional district, lancaster pennsylvania". at the desk sits thaddeus stevens (r, pa), 73, bald under a horrible red wig, a gaunt, powerful face resembling lincoln's, though beardless and bitter. in the office are ashley, speaker of the house schuyler colfax (r, in), formidable senator bluff wade (r, ma), who's never smiled, and asa vintner litton (r, md).}

<D>__{the man's never been near a whale ship in his life!}
<P>__{(to stevens:)}
<D>__{withdraw radical support, force him to abandon this scheme, whatever he's up to he drags his feet about everything, lincoln; why this urgency? we got it through the senate without difficulty because we had the numbers. come december you'll have the same in the house. the amendment'll be the easy work of ten minutes.}
<C>__{asa vintner litton}
<D>__{he's using the threat of the amendment to frighten the rebels into an immediate surrender.}
<C>__{schuyler colfax}
<D>__{i imagine we'd rejoice to see that.}
<C>__{asa vintner litton}
<D>__{will you rejoice when the southern states have re joined the union, pell mell, as lincoln intends them to, and one by one each refuses to ratify the amendment? if we pass it, which we won't.}
<P>__{(to stevens:)}
<D>__{why are we co operating with, with him? we all know what he's doing and we all know what he'll do. we can't offer up abolition's best legal prayer to his games and tricks.}
<C>__{bluff wade}
<D>__{he's said he'd welcome the south back with all its slaves in chains.}
<C>__{james ashley}

<C>__{asa vintner litton}
<D>__{you know he isn't to be trusted.}
<C>__{thaddeus stevens}
<D>__{trust? i'm sorry, i was under the misapprehension your chosen profession was politics. i've never trusted the president. i never trust anyone. but... hasn't he surprised you?}
<C>__{asa vintner litton}
<D>__{no, mr. stevens, he hasn't.}
<C>__{thaddeus stevens}
<D>__{nothing surprises you, asa, therefore nothing about you is surprising. perhaps that is why your constituents did not re elect you to the coming term.}

<D>__{it's late, i'm old, i'm going home.}
<A>__{stevens limps to the door, opens it, and turns.}
<C>__{thaddeus stevens }
<D>__{lincoln the inveterate dawdler, lincoln the southerner, lincoln the capitulating compromiser, our adversary and leader of the godforsaken republican party, our party abraham lincoln has asked us to work with him to accomplish the death of slavery in america.}

<D>__{retain, even in opposition, your capacity for astonishment.}
<A>__{stevens leaves, shutting the door. they watch him go, ashley excited, litton unmoved, insulted, skeptical.}
