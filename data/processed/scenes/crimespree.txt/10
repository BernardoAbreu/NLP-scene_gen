<L>__{exterior street, paris day}
<A>__{a narrow street. daniel carries the cardboard tube as he walks with julien and raymond. they enter a warehouse.}
<L>__{interior bastaldi's office day}
<A>__{two large desks are lined up face to face. one is empty. the other is occupied by laurant bastaldi, 40's, all business. off to the side is marcel burot, 40's. daniel, julien and raymond enter. as they approach the desk daniel glances at marcel who is staring at him.}
<C>__{marcel}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{i heard you almost got your ass blown off last night. some thief. a regular black panther.}
<A>__{marcel glances at bastaldi to see if he appreciates his comments.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{a black panther was a member of an african american militant group in the sixties, marcel. i think you're referring to the pink panther.}
<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{pink panther, black panther. who gives a shit? and i don't remember asking you a god damn thing, you little turd.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{there's no reason to be abusive. you're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.}
<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{what the hell is he talking about?}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{i'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.}
<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{how about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?}
<C>__{bastaldi}
<D>__{shut up! both of you! you're giving me a fuckin' headache.}
<A>__{a beat. raymond and marcel stare at one another. we hear a muffled groaning sound in the b.g.}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{where's your brother?}
<C>__{bastaldi}
<D>__{vincent's in the states on business.}
<P>__{(a beat; referring to the painting)}
<D>__{that it?}
<A>__{daniel lays the cardboard tube containing the painting on the desk. bastaldi removes the painting. to him it is not a work of art, just a commodity to be sold. he opens his desk drawer, removes several large stacks of money and hands them to daniel.}
<C>__{bastaldi}
<D>__{okay. now i've got something i want to }
<A>__{we hear the groaning sound again. bastaldi looks irritated. he gets up and walks over to a closet. he opens to the doors to reveal a man in his underwear, his wrists tied behind his back, his mouth taped shut. a wire noose is around his neck forcing him to stand on his tip toes to avoid hanging himself.}
<C>__{bastaldi}
<D>__{do you mind? i'm trying to do some business here.}
<A>__{the man looks at bastaldi through pleading eyes and mumbles something.}
<C>__{bastaldi}
<D>__{one more sound out of you and i'm going to cut your fuckin' tongue out.}
<A>__{bastaldi closes the door. daniel looks at him inquisitively.}
<C>__{bastaldi}
<D>__{you take someone in. give them a steady job and how do they repay you? by claiming to misplace a shipment of your merchandise.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{maybe he did misplace it.}
<C>__{bastaldi}
<D>__{you misplace your car keys. you misplace your cell phone.}
<P>__{(more)}
<C>__{bastaldi }
<D>__{you do not misplace one hundred and forty seven wide screen tv's!}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{laurant, how long has he been in there?}
<A>__{bastaldi looks puzzled.}
<C>__{bastaldi}
<D>__{i don't know. what day is today?}
<C>__{julien}
<D>__{thursday.}
<C>__{bastaldi}
<D>__{is it thursday already? this week has just shot by.}
<A>__{bastaldi thinks about something for a moment, then...}
<C>__{bastaldi}
<D>__{you and your crew speak english, don't you?}
<A>__{daniel is still staring at the closet.}
<C>__{bastaldi}
<D>__{hey daniel! hello?}
<P>__{(snaps his fingers)}
<D>__{do you guys speak english?}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{uh, yeah.}
<C>__{bastaldi}
<D>__{good. i have a job for you in america.}
<A>__{bastaldi tosses a photo of a middle aged american couple. he points to a diamond necklace around the woman's neck.}
<C>__{bastaldi}
<D>__{the taylors from chicago. very rich. an acquaintance of mine recently quit working for mrs. taylor as an assistant. she tells me they keep all their jewelry in a safe in their bedroom.}
<C>__{julien}
<D>__{it seems like a long way to go for a necklace.}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{besides, we don't know the city and }
<C>__{marcel}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{mr. bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go.}
<P>__{(more)}
<C>__{marcel }
<D>__{he's telling you you're going! and if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!}
<C>__{bastaldi}
<D>__{thank you marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation.}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{c'mon, laurant, america?}
<C>__{bastaldi}
<D>__{the job is worth about two million euros. pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, daniel. you leave tomorrow.}
<A>__{they know they don't have a choice.}
<C>__{julien}
<D>__{we're going to need to find someone who knows the city.}
<C>__{marcel}
<D>__{i know someone.}
