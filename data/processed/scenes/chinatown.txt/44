<L>__{exterior road gittes driving day}
<A>__{amidst a hall of shimmering dust and heat, parched and drying groves, narrower roads. he passes a ramshackle home, next to a rotting orchard. there is a "sold" sign on the collapsing barn. gittes stops, checks it against the names he had taken from the hall of records.}
<B>__{old stucco buildings further on}
<A>__{and a few withered pepper trees. gittes has paused at this dried up intersection. there is a "sold" sign on a drug store. gittes looks off screen. coming into view above the arid fields is a spiraling cloud of purple smoke. gittes heads in that direction. gittes parks at the edge of the field. about twenty yards away is a man mounted on a strange machine, holding a lid off it. billowing lavender clouds are belching forth. several children are watching the man at work.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(to one of the children)}
<D>__{say, pal, what's he doing?}
<C>__{child}
<D>__{making some rain.}
<A>__{gittes nods, walks over to the man who is elaborately busying himself with the intricacies of his machine. he's aware of gittes watching him.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{well, you're just the man i'm looking for.}
<A>__{the rainmaker now glances down at gittes, who as usual is immaculately dressed.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{some associates and i are thinking of buying property out here. of course, we're worried about the rainfall.}
<A>__{the rainmaker steps down.}
<C>__{rainmaker}
<D>__{no problem with me on the job.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{yeah.}
<P>__{(glancing around at}
<D>__{the desolate, dry}
<P>__{field)}
<D>__{do you have any references?}
<A>__{rainmaker & gittes}
<C>__{rainmaker}
<D>__{city of la habra heights filled an 800,000 gallon reservoir with sixteen inches of rain in two days.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{that's swell. but how about here?}
<P>__{(pulling out names from his pocket)}
<D>__{ever worked for robert knox, emma dill, clarence speer, marian parsons, or jasper lamar crabb?}
<C>__{rainmaker}
<D>__{never heard of 'em... new owners?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{rainmaker}
<P>__{(climbing back up)}
<D>__{lot of turnover these days. better tell them to get in touch with me if they want to hang onto their land.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{yeah, i will do that.}
<B>__{gittes driving}
<A>__{is now covered with a film of dust: he reaches a fork in the dirt road. there are a couple of mailboxes. gittes takes this fork and begins a slow ascent. as he does, the tops of a line of bright green trees can be seen, coming more and more into view, row upon row of avocado and walnut groves, their foliage heavy. the few structures in the distance are white washed, and well kept, right down to the white washed stones that mark the pathway to the home. towering above it all is a huge wooden water tank. gittes drives through a gate that has "no trespassing" and "keep out private property" signs neatly printed on it. he drives down the road into the grove.}
<B>__{gittes}
<A>__{pulls to a halt in the road flanking the orchard lanes. he puts the car in neutral, stares at the trees. by contrast with what he has seen they are lush and beautiful, their heavy branches barely swaying in a light breeze. then a shotgun blast abruptly strips bare the branches of the tree he'd been staring at.}
