<D>__{we got word from chicago. they got one of the grifters last night. the nigger.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{what about the other one?}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{they're still looking for him.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{who's got the contract?}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{combs gave it to reilly and cole.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{hackers.}
<C>__{floyd}
<D>__{they staked out the other guy's place last night, but he never showed. they figure maybe he skipped town. you wanna follow 'em up?}

<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{you see the guy in the red sweater over there?}
<A>__{we cut to one of lonnegan's foursome, a short, squat little irishman in a red sweater. he was a good time, friendly manner and a winning irish smile. we like him immediately.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{name's danny mccoy. no neck mccoy we called him. runs a few protection rackets for carnello while he's waiting for something bigger to come along. me and danny been friends since we were six. take a good look at that face, floyd, cause if he ever finds out we let one lousy grifter beat us, you'll have to kill him and every other hood in chicago who'd like to do the same thing. you understand what i'm sayin'?}

<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{good lad.}
<A>__{lonnegan is called to the tee by one of his foursome. he exchanges a friendly smile with mccoy and belts the ball down the fairway.}
