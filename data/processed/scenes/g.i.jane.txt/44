<L>__{exterior c.o.'s house coronado naval base night}
<A>__{an on base bungalow. jordan bangs on the front door until the c.o.'s scowling face appears.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{pardon the hour, sir. but you told me to come to you immediately if i felt i was being mistreated in any way.}
<C>__{c.o.}
<D>__{didn't take long.}
<A>__{he waves her inside.}
<L>__{interior c.o.'s house coronado naval base night}
<C>__{c.o.}
<D>__{all right, lieutenant, give me a name and specifics, i will have the x.o. file an action first thing in the morning.}
<P>__{(waits)}
<D>__{a name?}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{it's you, sir. and it started the day i came here.}
<C>__{c.o.}
<P>__{(jolted)}
<D>__{oh, really.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{it's this double standard, the separate quarters, the deferential treatment. it's how you pulled out my chair and nearly served high tea the first time we met.}
<C>__{c.o.}
<D>__{because i was civil, now you're complaining.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{i can't afford civility, sir. how am i supposed to fit in with these guys when you've got me set up as an outsider? even if i make it under these rules, i still lose, because there'll always be a flag in my file "yeah, she made it, but..." i mean, really why didn't you just issue me a goddamn petticoat to wear around the base?}
<C>__{c.o.}
<D>__{did you just have a brain fart?}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{pardon?}
<C>__{c.o.}
<D>__{did you just barge in here and curse at your base commander? if so, i regard that as a bonafide brain fart, and i resent it when people fart inside my home.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{i think you've resented me from the start, sir.}
<A>__{now, finally, her opponent steps into the ring. and he's a bare knuckle brawler.}
<C>__{c.o.}
<P>__{(building)}
<D>__{what i resent, lieutenant, is some politician using my base as a test tube for her grand social experiment. what i resent is the sensitivity training that is now mandatory for my men... the day care center i have to build where an officer's lounge used to be... and the ob gyn i have to keep on staff just so someone can keep track of your personal pap smears.}
<P>__{(drawing close)}
<D>__{but most of all, lieutenant, i resent your perfume, however subtle it may be, competing with the aroma of my fine three dollar and fifty nine cent cigar, which i will happily put out this very instant if the phallic nature of it happens to offend your goddamn fragile sensibilities. does it?}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<C>__{c.o.}
<D>__{no, sir, what?}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{the shape doesn't bother me. it's just that goddamn rotten stench.}
<A>__{a dangerous beat before the c.o. disengages.}
<C>__{c.o.}
<D>__{well. 'least now we're talking the same language.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{so one standard. is that what you're after?}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{same rules for everyone, sir.}
<C>__{c.o.}
<D>__{straight up?}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{across the board, sir.}
<C>__{c.o.}
<D>__{and if you just happen to wash out, i won't have to contend with you bitchin' to some hairy chested female senator? and please note i did not identify any one in particular.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{wouldn't dream of it, sir.}
<A>__{a deciding beat.}
<C>__{c.o.}
<D>__{then good night.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{so i will get a fair shot?}
<C>__{c.o.}
<D>__{you'll get everything you want, o'neil. let's see if you want what you're gonna get.}
