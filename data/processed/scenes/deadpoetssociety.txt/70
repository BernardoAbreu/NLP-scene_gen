<L>__{interior study room day}
<A>__{charlie sits with his bongos as the other boys are all crowded around him. he hits the bongoes as he mimes nolan's footsteps.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{creak. he started walking around towards my left. creak. creak. "assume the position, mr. dalton."}
<A>__{the door opens and keating walks in. many of the boys get up from their seats.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{it's all right, gentlemen.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{mr. keating.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{mr. dalton. that was a pretty lame stunt you pulled today.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you're siding with mr. nolan? what about carpe diem and sucking all the marrow out of life and all that?}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{sucking the marrow out of life doesn't mean choking on the bone. sure there's a time for daring and there's a time for caution, and a wise man understands which is called for.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{but i thought you'd like that.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{no. you being expelled from school is not daring to me. it's stupid, 'cause you'll miss some golden opportunities.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yeah. like what?}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{like, if nothing else, the opportunity to attend my classes. got it, ace?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{aye, aye, captain.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{keep your head about you. that goes for the lot of you.}
<C>__{boys}
<D>__{yes, captain.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{phone call from god. if it had been collect, it wouldn't been daring.}
<A>__{keating leaves and the boys gather around charlie once again.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{all right. go on.}
