<D>__{do it!}
<A>__{his cry echoes through the silo. the children cower behind the adults. blair is genuinely moved by his plight. barnes hefts the rpg, looks toward morrison "should i?" morrison seems torn, about to give the order lisa rushes in from the communications area, breathless, amazed by her own news:}
<C>__{lisa}
