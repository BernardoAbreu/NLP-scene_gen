<L>__{interior cub room stork club night}
<A>__{margo, karen, bill and lloyd are ensconced happily at a table in the rear of the room. a bottle of fine wine is being poured. their mood is equally bubbly.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{the so called art of acting is not one for which i have a particularly high regard...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{hear, hear...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{but you may quote me as follows. quote. tonight miss margo channing gave a performance in your cockamamie play, the like of which i have never seen before and expect rarely to see again. unquote.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{he does not exaggerate. i was good.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you were great.}
<A>__{as they look at each other, they reflect the understanding that has hit them both at last.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{it's been quite a night. i understand that your understudy miss harrington has given her notice.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(eyes still on bill)}
<D>__{too bad.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(eyes still on margo)}
<D>__{i'm broken up about it...}
<A>__{the wine has been poured by now.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{for some reason you can't just pick up champagne and drink it. somebody's got to be very witty about a toast.}
<P>__{(he lifts his glass)}
<D>__{for instance...}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(abruptly)}
<D>__{i'm going to propose the toast. without wit. with all my heart.}
<A>__{lloyd lowers his glass. there's a little pause.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{to margo. to my bride to be.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{glory hallelujah.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{well of all }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{margo!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{drink.}
<A>__{they drink, then burst into a flurry of questions.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{when? when are you going to do it?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{tomorrow we meet at city hall at ten }
<P>__{(to margo)}
<D>__{ and you're going to be on time.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{city hall, that's for prize fighters, and reporters i see a cathedral, a bishop, banks of flowers...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{it's only for the license. there's a three day wait blood tests, things like that...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i will marry you if it turns out you have no blood at all.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{three days, that's for the bourgeois i see a midnight elopement, waking up a village person...}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(to margo)}
<D>__{what are you going to wear?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{something simple. a fur coat over a nightgown...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{the point is in the cathedral, a ball park or a penny arcade we want to have you two beside us our nearest and dearest friends.}
<A>__{lloyd fills all the glasses.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{there are very few moments in life as good as this. let's remember it.}
<P>__{(he lifts his glass)}
<D>__{to each of us and all of us... never have we been more close may we never be farther apart.}
<A>__{they drink. a waiter approaches with a note.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{mrs. richards?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{for you.}
<A>__{karen stares at it curiously, then opens it.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{very discreet. a note right out in the open like that. next time tell your lover to blow smoke rings or tap a glass...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{lloyd, i want you to be big about this... the world is full of love tonight, no woman is safe...}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{this beats all world's records for running, standing and jumping gall!}
<A>__{she whips the note to margo, who reads it aloud.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"please forgive me for butting into what seems such a happy occasion but it's most important that i speak with you. please" it's underlined "meet me in the ladies' room. eve."}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i understand she is now the understudy in there.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(looking about)}
<D>__{pass me the empty bottle. i may find her... why, look. there's rasputin.}
<A>__{addison sits near the entrance, at a banquette table for two. a crumpled napkin and a wine glass indicate eve's place. he nibbles daintily at some blini. margo hails a passing captain.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{encore du champagne.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{more champagne, miss channing?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{that's what i said, bub.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(to karen)}
<D>__{after all, maybe she just wants to apologize...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i have no possible interest in anything she'd have to say.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{but what could she say? that's what fascinates me...}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{go on find out...}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{karen, in all the years of our friendship, i have never let you go to the ladies' room alone. but now i must. i am busting to know what goes on in that feverish little brain waiting there...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{well... all right.}
<A>__{she gets up and goes. the camera takes her past addison's table. he rises in polite surprise.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{karen! how nice...}
<A>__{she walks past him without a word. he smiles, looks toward the group. he raises his glass in a toast. margo responds to the toast by waving an onion with a grand flourish, then eating it.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{very effective. but why take it out on me?}
<A>__{he eats one in self defense.}
