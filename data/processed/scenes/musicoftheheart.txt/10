<A>__{a salsa song plays over as we see stores with spanish names and signs; black and latino elementary school children walking home from school; some burned out buildings; black and latino teens playing basketball on a cement court; spanish graffiti on walls; elderly women buying fruit at a produce stand. pull back to reveal this is the pov of roberta from the back seat of a cab. the salsa song plays on the cab's radio. roberta looks scared shitless. suddenly, two young men flash down the middle of the street, dart in front of the cab and the driver slams on the brakes, jerking roberta forward.}
