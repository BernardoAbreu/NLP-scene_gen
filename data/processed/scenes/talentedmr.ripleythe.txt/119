<L>__{interior ripley's sitting room, venice. night.}
<A>__{marge is leaving, coat on, as ripley comes out of the bathroom.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{marge? where are you going?}
<C>__{marge}
<P>__{(like a creature caught in headlights)}
<D>__{i was looking for a needle and thread. i wasn't snooping. i was looking for a needle and thread to mend my bra.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{the scent you're wearing. i bought it for you, not dickie. the thing about dickie. so many things. the day he was late back from rome i tried to tell you this he was with another girl. i'm not talking about meredith, another girl we met in a bar. he couldn't be faithful for five minutes. so when he makes a promise it doesn't mean what it means when you make a promise. or i do. he has so many realities, dickie, and he believes them all. he lies. he lies, that's his... half the time he doesn't even realize.}
<A>__{a small red stain is appearing on the pocket of his robe. as he speaks the stain spreads. he looks at it absently.}
<C>__{ripley }
<D>__{today, for the first time, i've even wondered whether he might have killed freddie. he would get so crazy if anybody contradicted him well, you know that. marge. i loved you you might as well know i loved you, and because he knew i loved you, he let you think i loved him. didn't you see, couldn't you see? i don't know, maybe it's grotesque to say this now, so just write it on a piece of paper or something, and keep it in your purse for a rainy day. tom loves me.}
<C>__{marge}
<P>__{(as if she'd heard nothing)}
<D>__{why do you have dickie's rings?}
<A>__{his hand goes to his pocket. he's going to have to do it.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i told you. he gave them to me.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{why? when?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i feel as if you haven't heard anything i've been saying to you.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{i don't believe you.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{it's all true.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{i don't believe a single word you've said.}
<A>__{marge is shivering. ripley, ominous, advances, she retreats.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{you're shivering, marge. can i hold you? would you let me hold you?}
<A>__{marge panics, backed up against the door. she screams and turns straight into the arms of a startled peter who's come back to visit ripley, and is unlocking the door.}
<C>__{marge}
<P>__{(sobbing uncontrollably)}
<D>__{oh peter! get me out of here.}
<A>__{ripley storms off. his hand comes out of his pocket covered in blood from the razor. peter notices, appalled.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{tom, are you okay?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{you try. you try talking to her.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(calls after him)}
<D>__{tom. tom! tell me, what's going on?}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(not turning around)}
<D>__{i give up.}
