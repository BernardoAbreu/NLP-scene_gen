<L>__{exterior cemetery night (later) (rain)}
<A>__{a low angle tracking shot (as when we first met elly). eric's and elly's feet pass graves. eric's pace is slow, crippled, limping. they stop at a grave where elly bends into frame to steal the flowers there. eric is bloody and out of it. she helps him walk.}
<C>__{elly}
<D>__{now do you get to see her? shelly, i mean.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{in a better place. i hope.}
<C>__{elly}
<D>__{you're not gonna come back, are you?}
<A>__{eric's response is halting and uncertain. but he tries to give her hope. he reaches for shelly's ring around her neck, holds it up to her.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i don't know if i can. but you have this... and you know where to come.}
<C>__{elly}
<D>__{you mean you'll, like' dig your way out of the grave? euww.}
<A>__{eric is amused by this in spite of his grievous injuries. he grasps elly's face in his hands and bends, painfully,to kiss her on the forehead.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{for you, i will try. promise.}
<B>__{move with eric}
<A>__{spent, empty, he holds the rose determinedly, but he's never going to make it the few yards back to his own grave. so close. his legs finally go and he collapses onto the humus. one groping hand tries to drag him further.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{leave me now.}
<A>__{angle elly tears on her face. she can't watch this. she turns and drops the flowers on shelly's grave. eric's pov his own grave still too far away to matter.}
<B>__{resume eric on ground}
<A>__{he gives it up, his face sinking into the wet grass for a beat before shelly's hand intrudes into frame to grasp his hand. no ethereal glow, no heavenly choir... just a near dead eric's blank faced astonishment, and he moves forward. angle elly shelly's grave bg she struggles to get her hood up against the rain and roughly wipes the moisture from her face with her sleeve. she turns toward eric's grave. then, surprised, she looks close. angle eric's grave eric is gone. the white rose lies neatly on the top of the undisturbed earth there. high angle cemetery emphasizing that elly is now alone in the graveyard. low angle on elly, rose in the foreground she walks off. hold the rose.}
