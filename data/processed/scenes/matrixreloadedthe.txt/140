<L>__{interior apartment building (matrix) day}
<A>__{the building is old, crumbling, and inside painted a horrid green that no sane person could find attractive. the humble place is home to the}
<B>__{oracle.}
<A>__{neo exits an elevator. recomposed and dressed normally, he walks up and down the hall, trying to remember which apartment she lived in. a tall black woman, one of the oracles priestesses, comes out of the stairwell and recognizes neo.}
<C>__{priestess}
<D>__{neo.}
<A>__{he turns and looks at her. she smiles, but as neo looks at her, a flash of uncertainty, and maybe hate, flies across her face before the smile returns.}
<C>__{priestess}
<D>__{the oracle is anxious to see you.}
<A>__{neo follows her into the familiar apartment. the windows are covered, and neo and the priestess are the only ones there. the priestess moves into the dark kitchen. neos eyes adjust to the darkness. he hears something squish as he steps, and looks down. the tattered rug is a swamp of dark, congealing liquid. neo reaches down and touches it with his fingertips. its half dried blood. he stands, his eyes adjusted to the dark now. the walls are chipped, covered in bullet holes. in slow motion, the entry door to the apartment opens. in walks agent brown. neo turns to the kitchen. agents smith and jones appear. they all draw their .45s. neo stands still as they walk up to him and put their guns to his head.}
<D>__{agent smith scoffs.}
<C>__{neo}
<A>__{"i was on to you the whole time. i only came in here to isolate you,}
<D>__{to destroy you."}
<C>__{agent jones}
<D>__{what are you waiting for?}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{i realized, that i cant destroy you he nods at smith}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{ without destroying the matrix itself.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{you killed me too easy last time.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{and if you kill us he nods at jones}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{well only come back like him. brown nods to smith.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{smith breathes deep, and drops his gun. the others follow suit.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{so, why dont you take it all down?}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{the matrix?}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{i can. but if i destroy the matrix, everyone within it will die. smith snorts.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{i take it the great morpheus failed to mention this? neo looks up at him, but his expression doesnt change.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{how many people are in it? smith holsters his weapon. he speaks matter of factly.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{six and a half billion. for neo, the numbers are too huge to imagine. brown scoffs.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{could you destroy us?}
<A>__{its a serious question for neo. but he nods. he knows his potential.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{i could.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{what does that make you feel like? god? he is amused by the idea.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{this is getting tiresome. where do we go from here?}
<C>__{neo}
<A>__{"if you cut the power that the matrix supplies to your armies, ill}
<D>__{let you live."}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{idiot. we dont care about life, we care about victory.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{so our kind... prevails.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{you mean, lives.}
<C>__{smith}
<A>__{"who do you think started this war, boy? your kind tried to kill us}
<D>__{first."}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{but you didnt. youre not as tough as you think.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{well see.}
<A>__{the three agents, helpless to stop him, watch as he walks for the door of the apartment. neo opens it, and stops, his face meeting a flying fist. his vision flashes with the impact, and he staggers back into the room, falling on his ass and rolling back onto his feet.}
<D>__{gregor steps into the room, tall and bad. neo holds up a hand.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{stop! i dont want to fight you! youre human!}
<A>__{gregory doesnt answer. he smashes a side kick into neos gut, doubling him over. the kick carries such an impact that a pale concussion wave flashes past gregor. it sends neo crashing out the window. gregory stands upright and moves to the window, followed by the three agents. theres nothing on the street, twenty stories below. the building starts trembling. we hear rapid fire impacts, growing louder and coming faster. the floor explodes as neo crashes up through the concrete, throwing the agents away as he embraces gregory in a bear hug. they blast up through the ceiling. we follow them up through three more floors, bam, bam, bam. each concrete floor smashes gregory in the head.}
