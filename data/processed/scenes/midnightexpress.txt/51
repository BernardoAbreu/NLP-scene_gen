<A>__{billy, with max's little screwdriver and a metal spoon, digs hard at the cracks around a dark stone in the sink room, first floor kogus. with him is max working on the same stone. they are sweating, shirtless, looking back over their shoulders at: bell guarding the stairs. billy works the stucco out, jiggling with the stone (about a nine inch circumference) using his fingers and screwdriver. painful work.}
<C>__{billy's voice}
<D>__{dear susan. it's taken me a long time to find out that it's got to stop somewhere. i've learned painfully not to trust the turks, the courts, the lawyers, the consul, the united states government, and not even my loving parents. there is only one way out of here.. the midnight express.}
<A>__{billy kicks with his sneakers at the stone, as silently as possible. a loud noise crumbling dust, stucco. bell at the stairs freezes, fearful. then silence. he runs over. max, bell, billy.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(in a whisper)}
<D>__{we're undermining the other stones!}
<A>__{bell studies it, pointing to the stone above left the one that has been loosened.}
<C>__{bell}
<D>__{we gotta take a chance and do that one next }
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{then pull out this one }
<P>__{(pointing to the}
<D>__{one directly left of the loosened}
<P>__{stone, excited)}
<D>__{just jiggle it, scratch it out, loose nit up, it's soft real soft!}
<A>__{billy has his head pressed close to the loosened stone. suddenly:}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{it's there!}
<C>__{bell}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{listen!}
<A>__{another angle all three press their ears to the stone. a silence. the faintest whisper of wind and dripping 'water indicating a shaft of some nature. bell looks back at billy.}
<C>__{bell}
<D>__{i told you, i told you you cock suckers! you didn't believe me.}
<A>__{billy smiles. max reaches over and grabs bell's face between his hands, kisses him violently.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{fuck me! you beautiful mother, you!}
