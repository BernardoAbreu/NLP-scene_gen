<L>__{interior belltower that moment night}
<A>__{the joker glances casually down at the trapdoor, wondering what all the noise is about. he draws his gun, moves cautiously to the trapdoor, and lifts it a few inches... just enough to see the unconscious form on the stairs.}
<C>__{joker}
<D>__{... batman?}
<A>__{no reply. the joker stands there and lets out a little snicker. he looks out through the archway, sees no sign of his rescue copter. then a look of curious amusement on his face he steps down through the trapdoor and lugs batman up into the belltower. he props batman up against a wall. still no sign of life. the joker crouches beside him and almost tenderly pats his face.}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{batman? batman?}
<A>__{the batman's lips part. but he's too weak to speak.}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{i thought you'd be more comfortable here in the belfry.}
<P>__{(chuckling to himself)}
<D>__{before i kill you i'd like to see who you are. would that be okay?}
<A>__{batman emits a tiny low moan. the joker takes it as a yes and reaches over to undo his cowl. bruce wayne stares up with dulled, sightless eyes. the joker reaches into his pocket for a purple handkerchief, moistens it, dabs at the caked blood on bruce's face.}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{oh my, aren't we pretty.}
<P>__{(brightening suddenly)}
<D>__{i know you! you're the rich boy!!}
<A>__{the joker is enormously tickled by this discovery. he claps his hands together in sheer glee.}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{my goodness, what in the world made you do it? it must've been something pretty terrible!}
<A>__{he's practically dancing now. he's made a friend.}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{you know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart to heart. i bet we would have got on famously.}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{mad... man...}
<C>__{joker}
<D>__{well now, you're not exactly the picture of mental health, are you.}
<C>__{batman}
<D>__{... murderer...}
<C>__{joker}
<D>__{bruce, we're both murderers. think how many people you've killed by letting me live.}
<A>__{a spotlight cuts through the night sky. the joker hears his helicopter approaching in the distance. bruce reaches down furtively. finds the timer on his utility belt. flicks a switch... and the countdown begins. the joker pulls a straight razor from his pocket and opens it gingerly.}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{i have to do it now, bruce, but it won't even hurt. now relax. the bat's in his belfry, all's right with the world...}
<A>__{he has the razor almost up to bruce's throat when bruce reaches out and grabs his lapels in a death grip. the joker is momentarily amused by this seeming display of affection.}
<C>__{joker }
<D>__{why, bruce...}
<A>__{then he hears ticking. looks down at the flashing digital display on bruce's belt.}
