<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i went to get myself a salad and i started to see all these vegetables, you know how they have all those salads laid out so that when it's time to get to the main course you won't eat too much... that scam to get you filled up so you don't eat too much chicken and beef and all that other stuff.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{yeah, yeah... i get the pointerior so?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{so i see celery, i see the lettuce, tomatoes, cauliflower... and i think, all these things come out of the ground... they just grow out of the ground. they had corn out of the ground... radish out of the ground. you say to yourself, how can all these things come out of the ground? you know what i'm talking about? all these things are out of the ground.}

<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i mean, how can that be? it just happened that way? and i'm not even getting into the fruits... i'm just dealing with vegetables right now. with all those things coming out of the earth, there must be a god.}
<C>__{tilley}
<P>__{(looking at sam)}
<D>__{i'm not getting the same religious effect that came over you. i don't know why, but i don't feel like running to a church to pray right this second.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you gotta admit, it's amazing.}

<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{i'm a hard working guy... i don't go around breaking windows. i've got better things to do.}
<C>__{bb}
<D>__{you didn't break my windows?! you didn't break my windows?!}
<A>__{he pushes tilley.}
<C>__{tilley}
