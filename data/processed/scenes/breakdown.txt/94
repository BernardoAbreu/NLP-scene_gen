<L>__{exterior mesa overlook day}
<A>__{there is a creak and the trunk opens. jeff squints into the sun. earl and billy stand over the trunk.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{get out. don't try anything stupid.}
<A>__{jeff gets out, grimacing. his clothes are stained with grease and tire grime. he sets his feet unsteadily on the ground, looks around. we see that he has been confined in the trunk of a pontiac firebird. the firebird and dodge ram are parked on a bluff. red stands on the highest point, peering through binoculars at the desert below. he glances at jeff.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{you're a tough man to get a hold of, jeffrey.}
<A>__{jeff stares, a mix of emotions anger, fear, confusion.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(barely able to control himself)}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{it's not me we're talking about. question is what you want.}
<A>__{jeff looks at him with loathing.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{see, i've got something you might want to buy. can't show you the merchandise right now, but i can describe it for you. about five five, hundred and fifteen pounds. i'd say three, maybe four of that is tits. black curly hair upstairs and down. interested?}
<A>__{jeff's anger bubbles over...}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{you sonofabitch }
<A>__{he advances toward red. billy and earl grab him from behind and tackle him to the ground. billy drives a fist into his kidney. jeff gasps in pain. red nods impassively.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{bring him up here.}
<A>__{earl and billy hoist jeff to his feet and propel him up the mound closer to red. from here, jeff can see a small desert town spread out below, as well as the highway leading through it. red gestures.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{welcome to brackett, jeff. if ever there was a two bit shithole in the middle of nowhere, this is it. one gas station, a half dozen stores and a v.f.w. hall.}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{see that building?}
<A>__{jeff follows his gaze.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{that's the bank. brackett commerce bank. you with me?}
<A>__{jeff nods tightly.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{then here's the drill. you're gonna walk in there and tell the manager you want an express wire in the amount of $90,000 from your account in boston. got your wallet?}
<A>__{jeff nods.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{you ask for the money in cash. small bills.}
<C>__{red }
<D>__{today's payday at the copper mine, so don't take any horsecock about how they haven't got it. if the manager gives you a hard time, that's your problem. it's your wife who's counting on you.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{how do i know she's still alive?}
<A>__{billy slugs him in the gut again. jeff doubles over.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{shut up.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{she's tucked away someplace safe. you get her back as soon as we get the money. simple as that.}
<A>__{jeff compresses his lips.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{now a smart guy like you, you're already thinking about calling the cops, right?}
<A>__{jeff says nothing. red raises a hand held cb to his mouth. he keys the transmitter.}
<C>__{red}
<P>__{(into mike)}
<D>__{iron man to blacktop, let's open the gate.}
<C>__{al }
<P>__{(filtered)}
<D>__{copy that, iron man.}
<A>__{red turns back to jeff.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{like i said, jeff, if you want to call the cops, there's nothing i can do. hell, with the fire you've got in your eyes right now, i figure you're fixing on calling the f.b.i., c.i.a. even the 82nd airborne.}
<A>__{jeff stares back.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{problem is, you can see this town for miles around. so ask yourself: how's the law gonna get here? they gonna fly in? drive in? either way, we'll see 'em. so let me be very clear: if we see one unmarked car, one plane, one human being who even smells like a cop this deal is dead.}
<A>__{he tosses jeff the binoculars.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{now take a look at the building with the flagpole.}
<A>__{jeff hesitates, then raises the binoculars.}
<B>__{through binoculars}
<A>__{the image shifts, then steadies and focuses on a small building with a police cruiser out front and a barely legible sign: "brackett sheriff." it's the police station where jeff filed the missing persons' form earlier.}
<C>__{red }
<D>__{there's exactly two cops in this town. one of them's inside pulling ass duty; the other's on patrol in the foothills. now a minute ago one of my men called in a non injury accident on the i 40 connector.}
<A>__{deputy carver comes out of the building gulping down a sandwich. he gets in the cruiser and pulls away, lights flashing.}
<C>__{red }
<D>__{it'll take that good ol' boy 20 minutes to get to the connector, another 10 to see there's no accident, and another 20 or so to tool his way back. 50 minutes all in.}
<A>__{the cruiser pulls away down the highway.}
<B>__{jeff}
<A>__{lowers the binoculars and looks at red.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{that's your deadline. if for any reason one of those cops pulls into town before i'm looking at a bag of money, your wife is dead, you're shit out of luck and we're gone for good.}
<A>__{he smiles at jeff.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{see, that's why there's no risk to us in this thing. you do the legwork. we sit back, we watch, we listen to our scanners, we monitor you every step of the way. if at any moment we don't like something, we split. period.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{helluva lot safer than sticking up 7 11s, wouldn't you say?}
<A>__{they lock eyes. red tosses jeff a windbreaker.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{put this on. you can't go into the bank like that.}
<A>__{jeff puts on the jacket. it covers his filthy shirt. red checks his watch.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{how about it, jeff? time to get the show on the road?}
<A>__{on jeff's expression...}
