<L>__{exterior hancock tower late night}
<A>__{our original exterior view of the skyscraper's penthouse. reverse angle now to see in far distance... ...the dense forest of silhouetted office towers of downtown chicago against the night sky, and we zoom toward them, covering miles in three seconds, to close on... ...the highest floor of the sears tower, and through an unlit window to see... ...a telescope. a silhouetted figure looking through it. snap to... view through the scope's lens. an amazingly close detail of the hancock tower penthouse. the scope now pans down the length of the tower, to... the street. the thief climbing onto a battered old lambretta. calm as you please. and as the scooter glides off... we hear our unseen voyeur walk away from our telescope. a door opens somewhere, and as credits conclude, it... closes. softly.}
