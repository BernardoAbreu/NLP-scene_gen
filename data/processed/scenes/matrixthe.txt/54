<A>__{there are several gasps.}

<A>__{morpheus rubs his face.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{you are angry with me.}
<A>__{neo pants.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{i, uh... maybe.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{it's all right. it's natural.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{i feel better.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{good, good. anger is a gift, neo, but it's a heavy one.}
<A>__{morpheus smiles.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{tank, load the jump program.}
<A>__{neo straightens as the dojo dissolves away like a curtain lifting, leaving the two men now standing on a building rooftop in a city skyline.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{you have to learn to let go of that anger. you must let go of everything.}
<A>__{a wind howls, whipping morpheus' long coat to the side.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{you must empty yourself to free your mind.}
<A>__{morpheus spins, running hard at the edge of the rooftop. and jumps. he sails through the air, his coat billowing out behind him like a cape somersaults once and lands on the rooftop across the street.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{neo looks down at the street twenty floors below, then at morpheus an impossible fifty feet away.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{okie dokie.}
<A>__{he takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{yeah. free my mind. right. no problem.}
<A>__{he concentrates. runs.}
