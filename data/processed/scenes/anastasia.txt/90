<L>__{exterior sea cliff night}
<A>__{rasputin follows tornado to the cliff and watches as it disappears into the horizon of the water. lightning and thunder crash as he laughs maniacally.}
<L>__{interior cabin night}
<A>__{which is swaying with the storm. pan past vladimir, snoring, his now limp mustache flopping wildly and past dmitri, sleeping restlessly. move to anya, who seems quite content. from under the door smoky images silently slither. they float across the cabin and swirl around anya.}
