<L>__{interior pawnshop back room day}
<B>__{two shot butch and marsellus}
<A>__{they are tied up in two separate chairs. in their mouths are two s&m style ball gags (a belt goes around their heads and a little red ball sticks in their mouths). both men are unconscious. maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and sprays both guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. the two prisoners look up at their captors. maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one hand, shotgun in the other, and marsellus' .45 sticking in his belt.}
<C>__{maynard}
<D>__{nobody kills anybody in my place of business except me or zed.}
<A>__{a buzzer buzzes.}
<C>__{maynard}
<D>__{that's zed.}
<A>__{without saying another word, maynard climbs up the stairs that lead to red curtains and goes through them. we hear, on the other side of the curtains, maynard let zed inside the store. butch and marsellus look around the room. the basement of the pawnshop has been converted into a dungeon. after taking in their predicament, butch and marsellus look at each other, all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both share at what they've gotten themselves into. maynard and zed come through the curtains. zed is an even more intense version of maynard, if such a thing is possible. the two hillbillys are obviously brothers. where maynard is a vicious pitbull, zed is a deadly cobra. zed walks in and stands in front of the two captives. he inspects them for a long time, then says:}
<C>__{zed}
<P>__{(to maynard)}
<D>__{you said you waited for me?}
<C>__{maynard}
<D>__{i did.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{then how come they're all beat up?}
<C>__{maynard}
<D>__{they did that to each other. they was fightin' when they came in. this one was gonna shoot that one.}
<C>__{zed}
<P>__{(to butch)}
<D>__{you were gonna shoot him?}
<A>__{butch makes no reply.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{hey, is grace gonna be okay in front of this place?}
<C>__{maynard}
<D>__{yeah, it ain't tuesday is it?}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{no, it's thursday.}
<C>__{maynard}
<D>__{then she'll be fine.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{bring out the gimp.}
<C>__{maynard}
<D>__{i think the gimp's sleepin'.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{well, i guess you'll just wake 'em up then, won't you?}
<A>__{maynard opens a trap door in the floor.}
<C>__{maynard}
<P>__{(yelling in the hole)}
<D>__{wake up!}
<A>__{maynard reaches into the hole and comes back holding onto a leash. he gives it a rough yank and, from below the floor, rises}
<B>__{the gimp.}
<A>__{the gimp is a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black leather bondage gear. there are zippers, buckles and studs here and there on the body. on his head is a black leather mask with two eye holes and a zipper (closed) for a mouth. they keep him in a hole in the floor big enough for a large dog. zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners, then lowers into it. maynard hands the gimp's leash to zed, then backs away.}
<C>__{maynard}
<P>__{(to the gimp)}
<D>__{down!}
<A>__{the gimp gets on its knees. maynard hangs back while zed appraises the two men.}
<C>__{maynard}
<D>__{who's first?}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{i ain't fer sure yet.}
<A>__{then with his little finger, zed does a silent "eenie, meany, miney, moe... " just his mouth mouthing the words and his finger going back and forth between the two. butch are marsellus are terrified. maynard looks back and forth at the victims. the gimps's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask. zed continues his silent sing song with his finger moving left to right, then it stops.}
<B>__{two shot butch and marsellus}
<A>__{after a beat, the camera moves to the right, zeroing in on marsellus. zed stands up.}
<C>__{zed}
<D>__{wanna do it here?}
<C>__{maynard}
<D>__{naw, drag big boy to russell's old room.}
<A>__{zed grabs marsellus' chair and drags him into russell's old room. russell, no doubt, was some other poor bastard that has the misfortune of stumbling into the mason dixie pawnshop. whatever happened to russell is known only to maynard and zed because his old room, a back room in the back of the back room, is empty. as marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with butch before he disappears behind the door of russell's old room.}
<C>__{maynard}
<P>__{(to the gimp)}
<D>__{up!}
<A>__{the gimp rises. maynard ties the gimp's leash to a hook on the ceiling.}
<C>__{maynard}
<D>__{keep an eye on this one.}
<A>__{the gimp bows its head: "yes." maynard disappears into russell's old room. there must be a stereo in there because suddenly the judds, singing in harmony, fills the air. butch looks at the gimp. the gimp giggles from underneath the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history of comedy. from behind the door we hear country music, struggling, and:}
<C>__{maynard }
<D>__{whoa, this boy's got a bit of fight in 'em!}
<A>__{we the hear maynard and zed beat on marsellus.}
<C>__{zed }
<D>__{you wanna fight? you wanna fight? good, i like to fight!}
<A>__{butch pauses, listens to the voices. then, in a panic, hurriedly struggles to get free. the gimp is laughing wildly. the ropes are on too tight and butch can't break free. the gimp slaps his knee laughing in the back room, we hear:}
<C>__{maynard }
<D>__{that's it... that's it boy, you're goin' fine. oooooooh, just like that... that's good.}
<P>__{(grunting faster)}
<D>__{stay still... stay still goddamn ya! zed goddammit, git over here and hold 'em!}
<A>__{butch stops struggling and lifts up on his arms. then, quite easily, the padded chair back slides up and off as if it were never connected by a bolt. the gimp sees this and its eyes widen.}
<C>__{the gimp}
<D>__{huhng?}
<A>__{the gimp flails wildly, trying to get the leash off the hook. he tries to yell, but all that comes out are excited gurgles and grunts. butch is out of his chair, quickly dispensing three boxer's punches to its face. the punches knock the gimp out, making him fall to his knees, this hanging himself by the leash attached to the hook, butch removes the ball gag, then silently makes his way through the red curtains.}
