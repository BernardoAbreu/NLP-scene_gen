<A>__{close up: the stack of term papers the papers are slightly crumpled. still wet. a drop of water hits the papers. camera pans upward. betsy tuffet, indy's student assistant, sits at the desk, grading the papers. she is crying. her falling tears soak the papers. we are inside of indiana's apartment. later that evening. indiana stands in the background. he is hurriedly packing his bags. his familiar gun, hat and whip lie on the bed, beside the suitcase. indy notices that betsy is crying. he walks to betsy. indy puts his arm on betsy's shoulder, attempting to comfort her. betsy snaps at indy.}

<D>__{you can't do this to me!}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(shaking tears off the papers)}
<D>__{c'mon, betsy. relax. you're gettin' 'em all wet again.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{you just can't go away...i mean... africa is so far away, and...well...}
<P>__{(heartfelt)}
<D>__{i love you, indy.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{thought we agreed this was s'posed to be casual...}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{you call what happened last night "casual".}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{my dear...a momentary lapse into passion does not a love affair make.}
<C>__{betsy}
<P>__{(very upset)}
<D>__{momentary lapse! so that's all i am to you!}
<A>__{betsy shoots to her feet, walking off screen.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{betsy... wait...}
<A>__{indiana sighs. his eye catches one of the termpapers. he begins to read, making a few corrections. we see betsy's hand removes indiana's whip from the bed. indiana continues to correct the papers. suddenly, there is a creaking noise. indy turns. his face goes white. he runs off screen. one end of indiana's whip is attached to an overhead lamp. camera pans down the whip. the other end has been formed into a noose around betsy's neck. sbe stands on a wooden chair. she kicks away the chair. suddenly gagging. indiana grabs betsy in midair. he takes the noose from her neck and places betsy on the floor.}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{whatsa' matter with you!... tryin' to ruin my whip!...}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{if i can't have you... i don't want to live.}
<A>__{indiana tosses the whip into his suitcase. he pulls up the chair and forces betsy to be seated. he pours her a tall glass of bourbon.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{drink this. you'll feel better.}
<A>__{indiana walks to his suitcase, continuing to pack. his back is to betsy. she raises the glass to her lips. she pauses, reading a message on the bourbon bottle. it reads: danger! contents flammable! betsy beams. an idea. she lifts the bottle over her head and begins to douse her body with the liquid. indiana is busy folding his clothing. suddenly, we hear the flick of a matchstick! indy turns. he sees the bourbon covered betsy preparing to light her body on fire! indy dashes forward. he blows out the match, moments before it sparks betsy's clothing. indy shakes betsy by the shoulders.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{c'mon, betsy... get a hold of yourself. you're young. there are a lot of other guys...}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{not like you.}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(succumbing to his ego)}
<D>__{that's true...}
<P>__{(realizing his mistake)}
<D>__{but that's no reason to stop living! besides, i'm too old for you. by the time you're seventy five, i will be...}
<P>__{(calculates, the thought of it makes him grimace)}
<D>__{yeccchhh! i will be disgusting.}
<A>__{indiana turns and finishes his packing. betsy sighs. she notices an enormous, stone african urn. the 150 pound antique sits atop a section of bookshelves. meanwhile, indiana makes certain that his gun is packed. he places the familiar hat on his head and begins to close the suitcase. close up: the african urn. it is wobbling. shaking. moving closer and closer to the edge of the bookshelves. camera pans to the floor. betsy lies here. directly below the trembling urn. betsy shakes the bookshelves, causing the urn to tilt and shiver. the urn is nearly halfway off of the edge. if it falls...the urn will crush betsy's head. indiana struggles with closing his tightly packed suitcase. the urn falls! headed straight for betsy! indiana suddenly grabs the urn. in midair. inches before it strikes betsy. indiana rests the urn on the floor. he helps betsy to her feet. betsy wraps her arms tightly around indiana.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{don't leave me, indy!}
<A>__{indiana picks up his suitcase and tries to walk to the door. but betsy's arms are still tightly wrapped around him. finally, indy stops. his eyes burn through betsy.}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(cruel)}
<D>__{look... you're just a flighty kid. twenty minutes after i walk out this door, you'll have a date with the college romeo. two hours from now, you'll be madly in love with him. by tomorrow, you'll forget i ever existed.}
<A>__{hurt, betsy removes her arms from indiana. he gives her a quick kiss to the cheek and hurriedly exits. betsy glares at the closed door. a tough, angry expression covers her face.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{never underestimate the determination of a brooklyn girl, doctor jones. never.}
