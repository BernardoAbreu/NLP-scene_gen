<A>__{syd felder (64) sits next to robert.}
<C>__{syd}
<D>__{hypothetically, the situation you're describing would be involuntary manslaughter.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{and such a person...}
<C>__{syd}
<D>__{...would be in a lot of trouble, especially if that person was closing a merger with a large public bank where any publicity or arrest could delay or derail the transaction. goldenrod 4.17.11 35.}
<C>__{syd }
<D>__{but that's only if there was some evidence that could link him to the crime.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{fingerprints, dna?}
<C>__{syd}
<D>__{very hard to collect after an explosion. the real world's different from television.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{what about cell phone records?}
<C>__{syd}
<D>__{did this person make any calls from the area?}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{not from a cell phone, no.}
<C>__{syd}
<D>__{then they won't be able to place him there.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{what would you advise such a person to do?}
<C>__{syd}
<D>__{to confess immediately.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{failing which?}
<C>__{syd}
<D>__{to put as much distance between himself and the event as possible, if possible. but let me tell you something, and i'm speaking to you as a friend now: there are about fifty things that person wouldn't have thought of. and the more time that passes, the more lies that are told, the worse it gets for him.}
<A>__{robert stands.}
<C>__{syd }
<P>__{(french accent)}
<D>__{robert...}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{syd}
<D>__{they're going to come to you. goldenrod 4.17.11 36.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{syd}
<D>__{an accident's not the worst trouble. if we talk to them now we can probably work it out.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{you tell me what happens if the standard deal does not close, and i gotta tell my investors about our real losses?}
<C>__{syd}
<D>__{nothing good.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{and what'd you say about the justice department? depending on what they decide to arrest me on fraud conviction gets me twenty years?}
<C>__{syd}
<D>__{i did.}
<C>__{robert}
<P>__{(laughs in pain)}
<D>__{what choice do i really have?}
