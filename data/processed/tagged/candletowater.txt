<D>__{so welcome back and if you've just joined us welcome: i'm talking to chris marlow, the barrister who represented decorated afghanistan para veteran shona barnes earlier this year. if you recall, shona was sentenced to seven years in wormwood scrubs for the murder of caleb rounds the man who broke into her house, shot and held her hostage for several hours on the night of march the twelfth last year. chris so . . . in your opinion shona's post traumatic stress disorder, a condition she suffered following action. . . an incident with an ied in helmand province in afghanistan in may two thousand and ten,}
<P>__{(more)}
<L>__{77 | p a g e}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{an incident that killed a close colleague of hers and resulted in shona being pensioned, invalided out of the army. in your opinion chris, this the ptsd should have been crucial to the decision not to prosecute shona for murder, a charge you now feel should have been reduced to what: manslaughter? she didn't seem like much of an invalid in the way she dealt with rounds did she? so for you was this a travesty of justice? really?}
<C>__{marlow vo}
<D>__{my sense of it is, christie, as i've said, and the reason i feel i failed, really, is that the state must find a way to take responsibility.}
<A>__{the hoodie climbs over the back fence of a house. he then proceeds up the garden again hugging the shadows for cover.}
<C>__{female dj vo}
<D>__{but now you're considering retiring? with a future as qc certain. a law lord perhaps. you're regarded by many as a}
<P>__{(laughs) legal wunderkind!}
<C>__{marlow vo}
<D>__{well i don't know about that. but yes, i'm looking to move out of the legal profession now.}
<C>__{female dj vo}
<D>__{because of this case, specifically? as queens council you could help people like shona. lots of shonas.}
<C>__{marlow}
<D>__{i know. but look. for me it's this: we send her out to afghanistan. we tell her to kill people who resisted our invasion.}
<P>__{(as the dj starts to speak) but (more)}
<L>__{78 | p a g e}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{anyway look: we make her an expert. a killing machine. and then war breaks our machine. so then our machine needs post traumatic stress disorder drugs in order to function in normal life. to make a cup of tea, for god sake. (silence a beat, then) she's a broken child, chrissie. we broke her. so then when she kills a known psychotic child molester and murderer in her home in the middle of the night in her home in self defence we, the state, we call that murder, and we throw her to the dogs. we screw her up in the name of a cause in some country some people and lets' face it, in a part of the world not many british people know or give a damn about and then we finish the job. we prosecute her for murder and lock her up.}
<A>__{the hoodie chooses a ground floor window. he jemmies it open.}

<C>__{marlow vo}
<D>__{i understand. i understand that when you sign up, you take your chances. you become an organ of the state, and if that state tells you to kill people in its name, it chooses not to call that murder. it chooses then to call you a hero especially if you die.}

<C>__{marlow vo}
<D>__{nation states have always protected themselves from their own imperial absurdities. what would be left if there was no chance of glory? why would anyone sign up? look: in war, anywhere, people do what they can to survive. all i can say is that personally, i mean as shona's brief, i failed to make the court see sense. for me, you know, it's like you can murder in the so called defence of the state but if you kill in the defence of yourself . . .you know it's like, i mean as shakespeare said `if his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes the crime of it out of us.'}
