<L>__{interior oval office day}
<A>__{kenny enters the office from his side door in the middle of a debate. military uniforms dominate the room: general taylor, general sweeney, and a host of briefing officers.}
<C>__{general taylor}
<D>__{the situation is worse than we thought. we count 40 missiles now, longer range irbms. they can hit every city in the continental u.s.}
<A>__{the president stares out the window at the rose garden, his back to air force chief of staff general curtis lemay, 60. beetle browed, arrogant, the archetypal cold war general. yet there is something about him, his intelligence perhaps, that suggests he's playing a role he knows and believes in. the only other civilians in the room are bobby, bundy and mcnamara. the pressure from the military is almost physical.}
<C>__{lemay}
<D>__{mr. president, as of this moment my planes are ready to carry out the air strikes. all you have to do is give me the word, sir, and my boys will get those red bastards.}
<A>__{the president continues staring out the window. kenny eases over to the desk, leans on it, arms folded, interposing himself between the president and the soldiers. bobby joins him, side by side.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{how long until the army is ready?}
<C>__{general taylor}
<D>__{we've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre arranged exercise, sir. we're looking at another week and a half, mr. president.}
<C>__{lemay}
<D>__{but you can begin the strikes, now. the plans call for an eight day air campaign. it'd light a fire under the army's ass to get in place.}
<A>__{that makes the president turn around, stare at lemay.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{general lemay, do you truly believe that's our best course of action?}
<C>__{lemay}
<D>__{mr. president, i believe it is the only course of action. american is in danger. those missiles are a threat to our bomber bases and the safety of our nuclear deterrent. without our deterrent, there's nothing to keep the enemy from choosing general nuclear war. it's our duty, our responsibility to the american people to take out those missiles and return stability to the strategic situation. the big red dog is digging in our back yard, and we're justified in shooting him.}
<A>__{taylor steps in softly, smoothly: good cop to lemay's bad.}
<C>__{general taylor}
<D>__{sir, we have a rapidly closing window of opportunity where we can prevent those missiles from ever becoming operational. the other options...}
<A>__{he spares a look at mcnamara, who watches the fireworks, arms folded, serious.}
<C>__{general taylor }
<D>__{...do not guarantee the end result we can guarantee. however, the more time that goes by, the less reliable the choice we can offer you becomes.}
<A>__{the president, partially defused, looks from taylor to mcnamara. lemay steps forward, softer now, sincere.}
<C>__{lemay}
<D>__{mr. president, the motto i chose for sac is 'peace is our profession.' god forbid we find ourselves in a nuclear exchange. but if launched, those missiles in cuba would kill a lot of americans. that's why i'm being such a pain in the ass about destroying them. destroying them immediately. hell, even mac agrees.}
<A>__{bundy is uncomfortable. everyone turns to him. he nods. kenny realizes he's been co opted by the military. mcnamara does too, lets out a deep breath. the president eyes bundy, then paces out from behind his desk, walks up to lemay.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{general, what will the soviets do when we attack?}
<C>__{lemay}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{kenny, bobby and the president look at each other, unable to believe what they just heard.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{nothing?}
<C>__{lemay}
<D>__{nothing. because the only alternative open to them is one they can't choose.}
<A>__{his pronouncement hangs there in the air: ominous, dangerous.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{those aren't just missiles we'll be destroying. we kill soviet soldiers, and they will respond. how would we respond if they killed ours? no, they will do something, general, i promise you that. and i believe it'll be berlin.}
