<L>__{interior evelyn's cabin night}
<A>__{evelyn, wearing a nightgown, stands in front of a mirror. she gives her head a good shake, letting her hair fall loose over her bare shoulders. then she turns around, right there is one of the hideous mumia! it's hook. he slams his hand over her mouth and lifts up his hook, ready to strike.}
<C>__{hook}
<D>__{where is the map?}
<A>__{evelyn's terrified eyes glance down. hook looks over, sees the map lying next to a flickering candle on a nearby table.}
<C>__{hook}
<D>__{and the key? where is the key?}
<A>__{evelyn's eyes look confused. she shakes her head. hook grins.}
<C>__{hook}
<D>__{then i will find it myself.}
<A>__{he cocks his hook, about to kill her. and that's when the door is kicked open. o'connell bursts in, gun in each hand. hook spins evelyn around and holds her out in front of him. o'connell looks at her.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{friend of yours?}
<A>__{evelyn's eyes widen. and that's when the candle on the table flickers. everything happens at once, read fast: o'connell spins around just as a window bursts open. a mumia leans in. fires a gun. woodchips blast off the wall next to o'connell's head. he returns fire. kills the mumia. the mumia falls back. firing blindly. a lantern in the room is blasted. kerosene splashes across the wall. bursts into flames. evelyn grabs the candle on the table and jams it back over her shoulder, right into hook's eye. he screeches in pain and lets her go. o'connell grabs her and yanks her out of the flaming room. hallway night o'connell pulls evelyn down the hall, she tries to jerk free.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{the map! we need the map!}
<A>__{he shoves her up against a wall.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{relax! i'm the map!}
<P>__{(taps his forehead)}
<D>__{it's all up here.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{oh that's comforting.}
<A>__{o'connell gives her a look, then pulls her forward.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{c'mon, there's still one more of those guys around here somewhere.}
<A>__{evelyn's flaming room night hot melted wax covers hook's face as he holds his sore eye and struggles to the door. then he notices the key box on the floor. he bends over to pick it up. and that's when the door is kicked open again, it hits him in the ass and knocks him into the fire. jonathan leans in. sees nothing but flames.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{evy!!}
<A>__{then he sees the key box on the floor and picks it up. a hand suddenly snatches the key box away from him.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{hey that's mine }
<A>__{it's hook. his backside is now on fire. he lifts his pistol. jonathan quickly backpedals out the door as hook opens fire.}
