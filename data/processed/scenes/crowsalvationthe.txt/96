<A>__{erin works at her father's desk under the light of an antique floor lamp. using a letter opener to pry open... a desk drawer full of files. she flips through, finds a manila file marked delt. takes it out. erin lays the file open on the desktop. empty. she checks... a small paper shredder under the desk. judging from the paper spaghetti in the basket underneath, recently used. erin scoops up the shreds of paper. no way to reassemble this.}
