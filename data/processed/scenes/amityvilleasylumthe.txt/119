<A>__{lisa is walking down the hallway. she hears a scream emerge from one of the rooms. she puts her ear to the door and hears the scream again. lisa kneels down and peers through the keyhole. in a clinical white room palmer is strapped down on a table. his face is severely cut and bruised but he is conscious. four orderlies hold his arms and legs while a fifth smears conductor on palmer temples.}
<D>__{orderly #1 do we need to put the bit in his mouth? orderly #2 no. we're not giving him the methohexital either.}
<A>__{the orderly places electrodes either side of palmer' head. he then turns the dial on the ect device up to full power. palmer screams as he violently convulses, salivating heavily from his mouth. suddenly the saliva turns to blood as he bites his own tongue off. lisa is horrified as she watches the orderlies laugh as palmer experiences a severe seizure. pov shot: someone is approaching lisa as she crouches in front of the door. a hand reaches out and grabs her by the hair,yanking her to her feet. lisa screams. she turns to see hardcastle standing in front of her. he invades her personal space in an intimidating manner.}
