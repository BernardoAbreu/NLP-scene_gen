<L>__{interior william's studio apartment night}
<A>__{somerset walks through this vast artist's studio, a converted warehouse space filled with canvases. it's clear the works at the underground art gallery were william's. william climbs a ladder to a loft storage space. he moves cautiously, like he's not quite up to the task.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i always figured that's the only reason you and i used to be friends. because i was a friend of hers.}
<A>__{william yanks a painting wrapped in dusty paper, climbs down.}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{speaking of which...}
<A>__{william hands the painting to somerset, walks to a director's chair facing a paint splashed canvas on an easel. he is a used up man, bound in an apathy induced haze. he sits, picks up a squeeze bottle of orange paint from a table of supplies.}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{i painted that about five years ago. i always told myself i'd give it to you next time i saw you.}
<A>__{somerset starts unwrapping the painting. william "paints," using the squeeze bottles and by flicking saturated brushes so that the paint flies against the canvas. most times, he's not even looking at the canvas or colors he's using. he looks over his shoulder at somerset.}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{things are different these days, pal. you wouldn't believe it...}
<A>__{somerset looks at the unwrapped painting and is hit by a swell of memories. horribly sad memories. it's a portrait in oils of a pretty, red headed woman. william shoots red paint with one hand, concentrates on lighting a filterless cigarette with the other.}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{people buy my paintings now... they drive down in their bmws and rolls royces. it's the new money generation. i guess they think they're touching the avant garde...}
<A>__{william looks at his creation, then calmly kicks the easel over.}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{there's another thousand dollar william mccracken expression of anarchy.}
<A>__{william gets up, walks across the wet canvas, leaving footprints. he looks down at what he's done.}
<C>__{william }
<D>__{make that two thousand.}
<A>__{he laughs. somerset holds up the delicately rendered portrait.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{how is she? have you seen her recently?}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{huh... oh. no. she moved out of the city. last winter. she married some businessman, or something like that.}
<A>__{somerset fights the anguish this causes, puts the painting down.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{good for her.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i'm leaving soon myself. i'm finally getting out.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{yeah? what happened to the idealistic super cop i used to know?}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{he became a realist.}
<A>__{william grunts, flicks his cigarette away, takes out a bag of pills. he palms a few, notices the judgment in somerset's eyes.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{oh... sorry.}
<A>__{william turns his back to somerset, pops the pills. out of sight, out of mind. somerset is disappointed, disgusted.}
<C>__{somerset}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{not that i don't appreciate your recent artistic endeavors... but, what happened to the painter i used to know?}
<A>__{william smiles like a dolt, laughs a little.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i can't remember.}
