<L>__{interior bank underground parking garage day}
<A>__{after hours. the floor is slick with water puddles in every direction. ned cecil comes out of the elevator, heading for his car. as he goes, the structure lights start to flicker. ned looks up, watches the lights go out one by one, furthest to closest. he looks around. unnerved by the darkness.}
<C>__{ned cecil}
<D>__{hello...?}
<A>__{a hanging beat. victor steps out from shadows.}
<C>__{ned cecil }
<P>__{(relieved, almost)}
<D>__{von doom? gave me a little shock. no hard feelings, right? nothing personal.}
<A>__{victor says nothing. ned keeps going.}
<C>__{ned cecil }
<D>__{you know, you could always move back to latvura, start fresh.}
<A>__{he mispronounces latveria, dripping condescension.}
<C>__{ned cecil }
<D>__{maybe that's where you belong, back in the "old country."}
<A>__{that does it. a surge of electricity courses through victor. his eyes narrow, and the electricity crackles down his leg to the ground. the electric spark hits the water and... electric currents race across the ground, slithering lightning fast across the water (like deadly electric snakes), heading straight for ned. his eyes go wide. and... ned is electrocuted! his body spasms. thud! he slumps, dead. smoke rises from his body. victor stands, power swelling. for the first time, his scar splits open, revealing a metal glow beneath the skin. he remains scary calm.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{it's pronounced latveria.}
<P>__{(looking down at the dead body)}
<D>__{this meeting's over, ned.}
<A>__{victor walks away, the final lights going to darkness.}
