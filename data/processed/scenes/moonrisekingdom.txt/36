<L>__{interior dressing room. evening}
<A>__{sam moves down a dark corridor. voices murmur. he pokes his head around a corner. a rack of choir robes and cassocks blocks his path. he slides two of them apart and looks}
<T>__{through at:}
<A>__{five eleven year old girls in black leotards sitting on a bench in front of a mirror framed with light bulbs. they talk quietly and fix their make up. they all wear wings on their arms and beaks on their heads. suzy sits among them in black feathers. sam stares at her. he steps into the light silently. suzy sees him in the reflection. the other girls turn around quickly, covering themselves. sam removes his cap and takes another step forward. his eyes dart briefly among the other girls. he says to suzy:}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what kind of bird are you?}
<A>__{suzy hesitates. she looks to the girl next to her, who says in a bossy voice:}
<C>__{bossy girl}
<D>__{i'm a sparrow, she's a dove, and }
<A>__{sam does not look away from suzy as he interrupts, pointing:}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no, i said, "what kind of bird are you?"}
<A>__{the other girls all look to suzy. pause.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{i'm a raven.}
<A>__{suzy lifts her beak slightly higher on her forehead. the other girls look annoyed but transfixed. the bossy girl frowns.}
<C>__{bossy girl}
<D>__{boy's aren't allowed in here.}
<A>__{sam does not look away from suzy as he answers quietly:}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i will be leaving soon.}
<A>__{sam points down at suzy's lap. one of her hands is wrapped in a bandage.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what happened to your hand?}
<C>__{suzy}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i got hit in the mirror.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{really. how'd that happen?}
<C>__{suzy}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{i lost my temper at myself.}
<A>__{sam is deeply intrigued by this. the other girls look puzzled. suzy presses her hair back off her face. she watches sam nervously.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{sam. what's yours?}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{i'm suzy.}
<A>__{sam nods with his eyes still glued to suzy's. suzy bites her fingernails. the bossy girl rolls her eyes.}
<C>__{bossy girl}
<D>__{it's not polite to stare.}
<A>__{sam holds up his hand for the bossy girl to stop talking. mrs. lynn steps into the doorway.}
<C>__{mrs. lynn}
<D>__{birds! ready?}
<A>__{mrs. lynn does a double take. she snaps at sam:}
<C>__{mrs. lynn}
<D>__{who are you? where'd you come from? go back to your seat.}
<A>__{sam hesitates. he spits the mint into a trash can, ducks out through the clothing rack, and is gone. a skinny girl dressed as an owl watches suzy while the other girls hurry to their feet. she says quietly:}
<C>__{skinny girl}
<D>__{he likes you.}
