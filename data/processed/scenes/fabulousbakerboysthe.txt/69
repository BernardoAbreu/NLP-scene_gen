<D>__{you know, susie and jack and i only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the king corporation's moorish manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. and it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also. so, if during the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. stop. say hello. introduce yourself. because here, there are no strangers, only friends. and family. right, jack?}
