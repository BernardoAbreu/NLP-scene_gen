<L>__{interior outside holding cell continuous}
<A>__{bergin closes the door. to spooner:}
<C>__{lt. bergin}
<D>__{we're being blind sided.}
<L>__{interior homicide unit hearing room morning}
<A>__{spooner and bergin, head into a small courtroom off the main squad room. lanning is huddled with aronson and a half dozen other company lawyers. spooner's jaw tenses. as he watches toller emerge from the clutch. shaking hands. slapping backs. strolls over to them.}
<C>__{toller}
<D>__{we got judge drexel...}
<C>__{robot bailiff}
<D>__{this hearing is called to order!}
<A>__{as a large screen. blips on behind them. the two opposing sides, assemble before it. judge drexel, still in his pajamas and robe. an ns 2 robot. leaning in to serve him a cup of tea.}
<C>__{judge drexel}
<D>__{statements, gentlemen.}
<A>__{aronson. standing at a glass podium.}
<C>__{aronson}
<D>__{your honor, the state is treating the robot as a defendant. but in fact it is a piece of property. property belonging to u.s. robotics.}
<A>__{toller. arm resting on his podium.}
<C>__{toller}
<D>__{this robot has been implicated in the death of a human being, your honor.}
<C>__{aronson}
<D>__{which places the incident firmly within the realm of an industrial accident. or is the state going to argue this case s a homicide?}
<C>__{judge drexel}
<D>__{that's a good question.}
<C>__{toller}
<D>__{no, sir. of course not.}
<A>__{spooner. pointing a finger at the u.s. robotics group.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{their machine shot and killed a man!}
<A>__{toller. shoots him a look. just as lanning speaks up.}
<C>__{lanning}
<D>__{there's actually no concrete evidence that points to that conclusion, your honor...}
<A>__{spooner. throws up his arms...}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{what?...}
<C>__{lanning}
<D>__{but we recognise that this robot is an aberration. and in the interest of public safety, u.s. robotics proposes that it be destroyed immediately.}
<A>__{no one expected this. least of all spooner. he turns to toller.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{you can't let them destroy evidence in an ongoing investigation!}
<C>__{toller}
<D>__{i'm not sure you even have an investigation any more.}
<A>__{just then the door opens. everyone turns as calvin enters. spooner looks surprised.}
<C>__{aronson}
<D>__{your honor, i'd like to call our company robo psychologist to the stand.}
<C>__{judge drexel}
<D>__{very well.}
<A>__{calvin crosses to the podium. a speaker asking: doyousweartotellthetruththewholetruthandnothingbutthetruth?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{aronson}
<D>__{dr. calvin, please tell us what conclusions you've reached after having observed the robot in action.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{there is a design flaw in the robot. its programming is advanced, but unstable, leaving the three laws in a grave imbalance.}
<C>__{aronson}
<D>__{in your expert opinion, what measures should be taken regarding the device?}
<A>__{calvin. staring straight ahead. avoiding spooner's eye.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{the robot must be destroyed.}
<A>__{spooner can't believe what he's just heard. about to speak up when toller grabs his arm. squeezing it. hard. judge drexel has heard enough. decides.}
<C>__{judge drexel}
<D>__{the robot in question will be transferred to a u.s. robotics facility where it can be properly examined to ensure an imbalance of this sort never occurs again. no one goes near it except qualified u.s.r. personnel. when the examination is complete, the robot is to be destroyed.}
<A>__{starts getting up from his chair. already done with this.}
<C>__{robot bailiff}
<D>__{this hearing is adjourned!}
<A>__{a burst of conversation as the screen blips off. the u.s.r. camp, looking especially pleased. spooner. catching calvin's eye briefly. as lanning leads her towards the exit, his hand on her back.}
