<L>__{interior hallway same}
<A>__{mitchell leads the presidential party down the hall. they turn and enter the medical lab.}
<L>__{interior containment lab continuous}
<A>__{the group slows as they enter the room. they see the containment room through the glass is covered with white steam. nothing can be seen. it's eerily quiet. cautiously they approach. suddenly okun is slammed against the glass partition, the creature's tentacles wrapped around him. pressed firmly to the glass, his eyes are shut, his expression pained, but when he speaks the voice is angry.}
<D>__{okun alien release...me.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{open the door. get him out of there.}
<A>__{suspicious, general grey stops him.}
<C>__{general grey}
<D>__{wait.}
<P>__{(to okun)}
<D>__{can you hear me? okun alien will kill...release me. now!}
<A>__{they follow the tentacles with their eyes, up to the ceiling of the containment tank. suddenly the alien leaps down, startling them, landing before them behind the glass. we see he's holding okun against the glass, speaking through him. this is the first real good look we get at the this bizarre creature. everyone in the room is repulsed and compelled by it at the same time.}
