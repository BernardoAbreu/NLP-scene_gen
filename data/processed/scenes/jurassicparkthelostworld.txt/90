<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior island night}
<A>__{the survivors set forth, marching through the jungle in a column. two hunters strap on small shoulder mounted servo flashlights. wires run from the lights end in sensor pads which they stick to the skin of their necks. thus attached, when the hunters turn their heads, the servo lights turn with them, illuminating whatever direction they look in. malcolm screws the barrel into the lindstradt rifle and slings it over his shoulder as he marches, limping heavily. he looks down at kelly, who is marching alongside him. his face shows the deepest of regret. he shakes his head, cursing himself.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{damn it.}
<A>__{he looks away as kelly looks up at him, questioning. roland falls into step with malcolm and notices his limp.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{you all right?}
<A>__{malcolm looks at him, then looks away without answering.}
<C>__{roland }
<D>__{wrong question?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you ever heard of gambler's ruin?}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{a statistical phenomenon. says everything in the world goes in streaks. it's real, you see it everywhere in weather, in river flooding, in baseball, in blackjack, in stock markets. once things go bad, they tend to stay bad. bad things cluster. they go to hell together.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{feeling a bit blue, are we?}
<A>__{malcolm glances at kelly, who has taken a slightly faster pace and is a few steps ahead of them now.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{just flawed. very deeply flawed.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{why did you come here?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{so that others would know about this place?}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{why should they?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{because it exists.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{it'll still exit if they go on not knowing, won't it?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{yes. and people will live in the absence of truth.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{so the truth is more important to you than your life?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(lowers is voice)}
<D>__{i don't care about my life. but if i'd ever thought for a second that she would be in danger }
<A>__{roland follows his gaze forward, to kelly, who's about ten yards ahead now.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{she yours?}
<A>__{ahead of them, kelly can hear their voices, faint, but clear. they are not as far away as they think they are.}
<C>__{malcolm }
<D>__{i'm afraid so. i don't know what the hell i'm doing with kids. i never should have had her.}
<A>__{kelly's face shows she heard that part. behind her, malcolm, unaware, continues with roland.}
<C>__{malcolm }
<D>__{why are you here?}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{somewhere on this island, there exits the greatest predator that ever lived. and the second greatest predator must take him down.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{but why?}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{you remember that guy, about twenty years ago, i forget his name, but he climbed everest without any oxygen, came down almost dead. and they asked him, "why did you go up there to die?" and he said "i didn't. i went up there to live."}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{it's called self testing. but in your case, it sounds more like self destruction. a uniquely human characteristic. in fact, human beings destroy things so well that i sometimes think that's our function. maybe every few sons, some animal comes along that kills off the rest of the world, clears the decks, and lets evolution proceed to his next phase. maybe death and destruction are our job, maybe we're supposed to destroy ourselves and every other living thing that }
<A>__{every person on the trail within earshot has stopped and is staring at malcolm, shaken by his words. roland grabs malcolm by the shirt collar and pulls him close, growling in his ear.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{tell you what. you can see whatever you want to, to me, but you will not spew any more nihilist rants at anyone else in the group. i'm fighting panic, and you push the wrong buttons. understand?}
<A>__{malcolm just blinks. this guy's in charge.}
