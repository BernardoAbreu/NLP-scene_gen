<L>__{interior cali's nursery day}
<A>__{renai scoops up cali, rocking her gently. a scratching sound interrupts. rough. frantic. like a dog pawing at something.}
<L>__{interior hallway continuous}
<A>__{renai steps into the hall, curious. she can still hear it. she follows the sound to a door. grabs the door handle. the sound abruptly ceases.}
<L>__{interior basement continuous}
<A>__{the door whines open and stabs a blade of light onto a set of stairs that descend into a gloomy basement. renai stands at the top of the stairs, squinting into the inky blackness, straining to see. she reaches up and yanks a light chain, illuminating a bare bulb and throwing light across the tenebrous space. the basement is large and completely bare. cleaned out. renai takes a step down. she is still carrying cali. further down below her, we see that there is one step that is cracked and broken. she takes another step. the broken step is right below her now. one more step and she will fall. cali squeals happily. renai pauses...then turns around, heading back up the stairs. stops when she sees something. deep, violent scratch marks...running downwards on the inside of the door...as if someone were trying to claw their way out.}
