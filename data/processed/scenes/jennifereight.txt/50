<L>__{50: exterior suburban street. city of eureka. day.}
<A>__{pretty houses in a pretty little street. hills in the back and sunshine out front. berlin pulls up in his mercedes and does a bit of tie adjusting as he walks up a path and hits the chimes. this could only be mrs citrine. a budget smile and he's inside.}
<L>__{51: interior "studio" conservatory. house. day.}
<A>__{dozens of repulsive paintings. a truly repulsive painting "by numbers" of the mona lisa in progress. the color codes are com pletely fucked up. citrine wears a wooly hat and hates walking on crutches. berlin picked a bad day to come in here with this.}
<C>__{citrine}
<D>__{you're pushing this too hard. it's like you want me to say stop? you must know that's the way this is going, john? there's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.}
<C>__{citrine}
<D>__{then where's the body? .. where's the body, and why's he hidden it?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{he hasn't hidden it. he never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. she's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.}
<C>__{citrine}
<D>__{have you got a match on the bullet?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{citrine}
<D>__{have you got a print from the hand?}
<C>__{berlin}

<C>__{citrine}
<D>__{it could be anyone's hand. illeg ally disposed of hospital debris ..}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{it's her hand. her scars. her dog. her dog's shot. and she's missing.}
<C>__{citrine}
<D>__{she's not "missing." did she shout? did she scream? did he coerce her? no. she left of her own free will .. and if she gets on a plane and goes to peru with the prick, she's still not missing. you got no case, john.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{if you're not gonna hear me, chief ..}
<C>__{citrine}
<D>__{i have heard you. you just don't like hearing me. you got this whole damned thing outta proportion. i don't know what you gotten used to in los angeles, but i don't believe there's a police chief, in this country, would put a task force together for a body part ..}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{we have a multiple homicide, sir ..}
<C>__{citrine}
<D>__{we have a body part in suspicious circumstances a tailor's dummy wearing a brassiere and a bill for seventeen dollars for its wig!}
