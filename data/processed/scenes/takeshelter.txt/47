<L>__{interior doctor's office exam room day}
<A>__{curtis sits, fully clothed, on the edge of a paper covered bench in the exam room. doctor shannan, an older man with a smoker's voice, enters smiling and gives a firm handshake.}
<C>__{doctor shannan}
<D>__{curtis, how you doin' bud?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{hey doc.}
<C>__{doctor shannan}
<D>__{how's my girl?}
<A>__{the doctor turns to a small table in the corner and grabs a wooden tongue depressor and an otoscope from a drawer.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{she's good.}
<C>__{doctor shannan}
<D>__{that's good to hear. tilt your head back for me.}
<A>__{the doctor shines the otoscope into his nostrils.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{i don't have a cold.}
<A>__{the doctor pauses and turns to check a chart on the table.}
<C>__{doctor shannan}
<D>__{oh. did she get that down wrong?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{no, i just told her that.}
<C>__{doctor shannan}
<D>__{oh. so what's the problem?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{i've been havin'...i've been having some trouble sleepin'. i was hopin' you could give me somethin' for it.}
<A>__{doctor shannan takes a seat on a rolling stool and processes the request.}
<C>__{doctor shannan}
<D>__{how long's this been goin' on?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{`bout four nights now.}
<C>__{doctor shannan}
<D>__{you're not sleepin' at all?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{well some, but real restless.}
<C>__{doctor shannan}
<D>__{well, i think four nights is a little too soon to tell. my advice would be to not eat or drink anything after 8 o'clock at night. cut back on any alcoholic drinks, tobacco, caffeine...get some daily exercise.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{well, i think...}
<A>__{curtis isn't sure how much he wants to say.}
<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{i think i may need to try some medication.}
<C>__{doctor shannan}
<D>__{why do you say that?}
<C>__{curtis}
<P>__{(still reluctant)}
<D>__{the reason i've been having trouble sleeping is because of some dreams i've been havin'. i didn't think it was anything at first, but then the other day i woke up and the bed was wet.}
<C>__{doctor shannan}
<D>__{you urinated in your bed?}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{yeah. couple days before that i had a dream that my dog attacked me and it took all day for the pain in my arm to go away.}
<A>__{doctor shannan leans his back against the table and thinks about this.}
<C>__{doctor shannan}
<D>__{you been to see your mother lately?}
<A>__{he swivels the stool around and writes on a prescription pad.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{it's been about a month.}
<A>__{he tears two sheets off and holds the first out to curtis.}
<C>__{doctor shannan}
<D>__{okay. this is a prescription for a pretty mild sedative. it's non habit forming, but i'm only giving you enough for a few days anyway. take it and see if it helps. in the meantime,}
<P>__{(holds up the other slip)}
<D>__{this is the number of a good friend of mine in columbus. he's a psychiatrist. it's a drive, but he's the best i know.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{doctor shannan}
<D>__{i will give him a call and let him know you'll be down to see him.}
<C>__{curtis}
<D>__{all right.}
