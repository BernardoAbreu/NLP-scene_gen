<D>__{...my client was suffering from a major illness of schizophrenic nature wherein during times of intense stress, as a result of paranoid and psychotic delusions there was impairment of his ability to appreciate wrongfullness... this is a victory for the mentally ill!}
<A>__{jordy walks alongside the moving mass. his eyes focused on emil his hand in his pocket. we notice in the crowd max, the celebrity crazed pyromaniac. what's he doing here? max's hand is also stuck deeply in his pocket. a weird gleam in his eye. we see korfin in the group, speaking to other cops. nicolette and her camera crew are vying for their place in the mass. she watches emil with quiet rage. cutler continues:}
<C>__{cutler }
<D>__{...before emil boards the police boat and heads for rykers island where he will be checked into the psyche ward, i want to say one last word to you all... as you know, emil was coerced by oleg razgul into committing these murders, yet oleg is still out in the street, a free man, filming gruesome murders... my client and i hope he is brought to justice in the near future.}
