<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i'd forgotten what this was like... the two of us out together.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{yeah. it's been awhile.}

<C>__{beth}
<D>__{it's not that easy.}

<A>__{derek pours the last of the bottle into beth's glass and signals the waiter.}
<C>__{derek }
<D>__{could we get another bottle, please?}
<A>__{derek smiles at beth. she looks at her wine glass.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{derek, not everybody gets drunk and does things they regret.}
<A>__{derek looks like he's been punched in the face.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{i keep telling you i didn't do any thing to regret.}
<A>__{beth looks up and gives him a hard, cold look.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(slowly)}
