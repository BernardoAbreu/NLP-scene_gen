<L>__{134. in the waist night}
<A>__{killick and nagel are less than impressed with hollom and sing over him, led by orrage the cook.}
<C>__{orrage}
<D>__{come all you thoughtless young men, a warning take by me, and never leave your happy homes to sail the raging sea.}
<L>__{135. ocean night}
<A>__{the surprise sailing away from us, the chorus drifting across the darkness.}
<L>__{135a. ocean. day}
<A>__{the colours are changing, from the rich hues of the tropics to the cold muted colours of colder, more southerly climes. still the surprise sails on}
<L>__{136. the great cabin day}
<A>__{fingers trace a course down the east coast of south america. another, more detailed chart is placed on top of the first.}
<C>__{allen}
<D>__{this one's by colnett, sir. he travelled with captain cook and carried a pair of arnott's chronometers.}
<A>__{jack finds their position and marks it with pencil. a knock on the door. officers and crew are now dressed according to the change in climate}
<C>__{killick}
<D>__{couple of the men to see you, sir.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(without looking up)}
<D>__{show them in.}
<A>__{the door opens to reveal nagel and warley carrying something.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{what's this?}
<A>__{a scale model of a ship, 15 inches long, perfect in every detail. jack takes it, delighted, the name picked out in gold on the stern acheron.}
<C>__{nagel}
<D>__{it were warley's idea, sir.}
<C>__{warley}
<D>__{i thought she were familiar like, then i remembered where i'd seen her in boston, during the peace.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{in boston?}
<C>__{warley }
<D>__{yes, sir. she's yankee built. i seen them working on her, something right strange about her scantlings. then i seen them balls bounce off her an' i got to thinking.}
<C>__{nagel}
<D>__{if you look here, sir. one side opens up.}
<A>__{he pulls a side off the model, exposing its construction.}
<C>__{warley}
<D>__{mister nagel here done it just like i seen her a third layer 'tween the outer and inner ribbing diagonal bracing, see?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{just like the u.s. constitution our 12 pounders couldn't penetrate except at close range.}
<A>__{he passes the model to allen.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{killick. killick, there.}
<A>__{killick enters.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{an extra ration of rum for these men, from my private store.}
<C>__{killick}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{which i was saving for saluting day, sir.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{rouse it up, killick, and a bottle for mr. allen and me. let us live whilst we're alive!}
<A>__{killick goes to get the bottles jack hunkers down to bring his gaze level with the ship, as though studying its tiny occupants.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{he's vulnerable here.}
<A>__{he taps the stern windows.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{cross her stern, rake her with a broadside through her length. but how to get close enough? past those long eighteens. that's the devil of it.}
