<L>__{interior community blood bank examining room night}
<A>__{the nurse ushers nomak into the room, indicating he should sit in a kind of reclining dental chair with arm and headrests. nomak notices a security camera mounted above.}
<C>__{nomak}
<P>__{(anxious)}
<D>__{how unusual?}
<A>__{beat. the nurse sets aside nomak's file, looking uncomfortable.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{your blood has a very rare phenotype, one that's quite valuable to people like us.}
<C>__{nomak}
<D>__{us? what are you talking about?}
<A>__{a kind faced doctor enters, nodding to guard #1.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{it's a good news bad news scenario, jared. good news for us, bad for you.}
<A>__{the doctor and nurse smile, baring fangs. we realize now that they are both vampires. the guard, too. he grips nomak by the throat, forcing him back into the restraint chair. as the vampire guard does so, his hand brushes against nomak's jaw. the flesh on nomak's chin briefly separates along the scar almost as if it were a seam. the guard pauses and nomak laughs. definitely not the reaction the vampires were expecting from a potential victim. nomak starts to shake and twitch, like he's going into some kind of seizure. the whites of his eyes bleed red. he throws his head back, opening his mouth as a pair of razor sharp canines extrude from his gums. these are longer, much more lethal looking than the fangs of the vampires and nomak lashes out, knocking the guard backwards. the nurse screams. nomak clamps his mouth onto her throat, slamming her back against the wall. the vampire doctor rushes to the door, scrambling to unbolt it. nomak reaches for him, howling with blood drunk laughter as he lifts the doctor up. nomak flings the doctor about like a toy, using his body to smash the lights, then the security camera above.}
