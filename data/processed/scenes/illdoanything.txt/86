<L>__{interior cathy's office early evening}
<A>__{she's been sitting here for quite a while... she can postpone no longer; she dials as one of her movie sound tracks plays in the background.}
<C>__{cathy}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{hello. matt... hi... okay, sure...}
<A>__{she listens, waiting for him to quiet jeannie.}
<C>__{cathy}
<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{matt...}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{matt... matt... maybe it would be easier if i just said 'hi' to her... hi, jeannie... yes, it's exciting... no, no. he's right, honey, they get somebody to read it to you. now, put your dad on it's important. no, first put your dad on... damn it!}
<P>__{(she waits a beat)}
<D>__{...matt. uh huh, a few hours ago... they all... everyone liked your work, but i think they'll go for a name or something.}
<A>__{she listens to him. he is hurt. cathy, though, is also wrestling with her own internal struggles. she has betrayed him and is ashamed; in a strange way terrified. she is, therefore, just a little irritable.}
<C>__{cathy}
<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{it's not a matter of doing it differently... they liked what you did, a lot... they laughed and... it's not you... it's them.}
<P>__{(suddenly her breath comes weird)}
<D>__{no, please. don't thank me. if you feel like getting together later or anytime, call me, okay? you sound like you have your hands full right now... goodbye.}
