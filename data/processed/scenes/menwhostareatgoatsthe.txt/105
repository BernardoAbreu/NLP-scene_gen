<L>__{exterior street moments later}
<A>__{mahmud leads bob and lyn at a crouching run down the street, amongst the crowd of iraqis fleeing the gunfire behind them. we hear the whup whup of a helicopter as a kiowa warrior passes over head. moments later we hear an explosion as the helicopter opens fire with a missile...}
<L>__{interior mahmud's house evening}
<A>__{tracking along a wall, past a crooked wedding portrait a smiling mahmud and wife, the glass broken...}
<C>__{bob }
<D>__{muhammad led us to his home which it turned out had been robbed in his absence.}
<A>__{we track past a row of bullet holes in the wall, a section of smoke damaged wall paper.}
<D>__{bob (cont'd) (v.o.) (cont'd) and also accidentally set on fire by a us tank. neighbors told him his wife had left, they weren't sure where she had gone.}
<A>__{we reach bob, lyn and mahmud eating at a low table. the windows behind them have been partially boarded up. mahmud is sunk into a profound depression. lyn looks tired, pale. they eat in awkward silence.}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{mahmud daash}
<D>__{taameeyah.}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{they're really good.}
<A>__{bob nods politely. mahmud nods, sighs.}
<C>__{bob }
<D>__{i understood he was going through a lot, but considering we had saved him from kidnappers i still thought his welcome could have been a little warmer.}
<A>__{lyn clears his throat.}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{i'm very sorry for running you over, sir.}
<A>__{mahmud shrugs.}
<C>__{mahmud daash}
<D>__{it was an accident.}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and i apologize for that security detachment. please don't think all americans are like that.}
<A>__{mahmud nods. beat.}
<C>__{mahmud daash}
<D>__{i apologize for the kidnappers.}
<A>__{lyn demurs softly.}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{not your fault sir. i mean we get kidnappers in america too, so...you know. there's always, uh, bad apples, right?}
<A>__{the men eat in silence for a moment. mahmud stares blankly at his plate, looking crumpled and lost. bob watches him, faintly irritated. lyn tries to think of something comforting to say.}
<C>__{lyn cassady }
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{akhir il ahzan. (may this be the}
<P>__{last of your sorrows.)}
<A>__{mahmud looks at him, startled perhaps by the unexpected arabic phrase.}
<C>__{lyn cassady }
<D>__{did i say it wrong?}
<A>__{mahmud shakes his head, moved but embarrassed.}
<C>__{mahmud daash}
<D>__{no...that was right.}
<A>__{they eat in silence.}
