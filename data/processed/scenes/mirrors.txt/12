<A>__{we discover a whole different world in the sterile environment of the nyc chief medical examiner's office, forensic scientists with tape recorders in hand, describe the corpses. we are a world away from the hollywood cliches of neatly laid out, immaculate cadavers. here, some of the corpses have reached a state of advanced decomposition and others are still frozen in contorted positions, expressing their ultimate agony before dying. from the homeless man fished out of the river, to the woman killed by gun shots, each corpse tells his own story... amidst the group of doctors 35 year old amy, deeply immersed in an autopsy, is interrupted by her cell phone. amy checks the display for the incoming call ben. she hesitates for a moment and doesn't answer the call. amy goes back to the postmortem analysis on her tape recorder.}
