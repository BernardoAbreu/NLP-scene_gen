<L>__{interior salieri's apartment salon day 1780's}
<A>__{mozart is waiting for salieri, holding a portfolio. salieri approaches him nervously. mozart stands not belligerently, but humbly.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{herr mozart, what brings you here?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{your excellency, you requested some specimens of my work. here they are. i don't have to tell you how much i need your help. i truly appreciate your looking at these. i have pressures on me financial pressures. as you know, i'm a married man now.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{so you are. how is your pretty wife?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{she is well. she is well, actually, i'm about to become a father! she only told me last night. you are the first to know.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{i'm flattered. and congratulations to you, of course.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{so you see, this post is very important to me right now.}
<A>__{salieri looks at him in distress.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{why didn't you come to me yesterday, mozart? this is a most painful situation. yesterday i could have helped you. today, i can't.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{why? here is the music. it's here. i am submitting it humbly. isn't that what you wanted?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{i have just come from the palace. the post has been filled.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{filled? that's impossible! they haven't even seen my work. i need this post. please, can't you help me? please!}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{my dear mozart, there is no one in the world i would rather help, but now it is too late.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{whom did they choose?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{herr sommer.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{sommer? herr sommer? but the man's a fool! he's a total mediocrity.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{no, no, no: he has yet to achieve mediocrity.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{but i can't lose this post, i simply can't! excellency, please. let's go to the palace, and you can explain to the emperor that herr sommer is an awful choice. he could actually do musical harm to the princess!}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{an implausible idea. between you and me, no one in the world could do musical harm to the princess elizabeth.}
<A>__{mozart chuckles delightedly. salieri offers him a glass of white dessert and a spoon. mozart takes it absently and goes on talking.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{look, i must have pupils. without pupils i can't manage.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{you don't mean to tell me you are living in poverty?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{no, but i'm broke. i'm always broke. i don't know why.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{it has been said, my friend, that you are inclined to live somewhat above your means.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{how can anyone say that? we have no cook, no maid. we have no footman. nothing at all!}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{how is that possible? you give concerts, don't you? i hear they are quite successful.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{they're stupendously successful. you can't get a seat. the only problem is none will hire me. they all want to hear me play, but they won't let me teach their daughters. as if i was some kind of fiend. i'm not a fiend!}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{of course not.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{do you have a daughter?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{i'm afraid not.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{well, could you lend me some money till you have one? then i will teach her for free. that's a promise. oh, i'm sorry. i'm being silly. papa's right i should put a padlock on my mouth. seriously, is there any chance you could manage a loan? only for six months, eight at most. after that i will be the richest man in vienna. i will pay you back double. anything. name your terms. i'm not joking. i'm working on something that's going to explode like a bomb all over europe!}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{ah, how exciting! tell me more.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{i'd better not. it's a bit of a secret.}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{come, come, mozart; i'm interested. truly.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{actually, it's a big secret. oh, this is delicious! what is it?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{cream cheese mixed with granulated sugar and suffused with rum. crema al mascarpone.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{ah. italian?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{forgive me. we all have patriotic feelings of some kind.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{two thousand, two hundred florins is all i need a hundred? fifty?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{what exactly are you working on?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{i can't say. really}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{i don't think you should become known in vienna as a debtor, mozart. however, i know a very distinguished gentleman i could recommend to you. and he has a daughter. will that do?}
