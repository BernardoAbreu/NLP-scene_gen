<A>__{oscar walks out onto the shoreline, looking at the water. he looks around for a beat. he walks all the way out into the water. standing on rocks. he looks over both shoulders, to make sure no one is watching. he then goes into his waistband and pulls out the ziplock bag of weed. he squats down, opens the bag, and dumps it into the water. he watches as the green buds float off.}
