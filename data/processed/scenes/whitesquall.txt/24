<L>__{exterior albatross open water day}
<A>__{the albatross is under full power. there is a sense of excitement and anticipation. charlie, rick, robin, and lawford are on the halyard for the mainsail. skipper is at the helm with alice and bill nearby. skipper calls over to chuck who stands alone at the rail.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{come over here and take the wheel.}
<A>__{chuck's eyes light up as he walks over and takes the wheel.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{hold her steady into the wind. southwest by west.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<C>__{skipper}
<P>__{(to all)}
<D>__{gentleman, when you hear an order, sing out. i want to know that you've heard and understand.}
<P>__{(quietly to bill)}
<D>__{raise the mainsail.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{raise the main!}
<A>__{lawford and his group bellow out.}
<C>__{together}
<D>__{raise the main!!}
<A>__{lawford coaches the boys, sending two scurrying on top the chart house to loosen the stops which hold the heavy furled canvas to the main boom. he guides another to the midships pinrail where the main halyard, which raises the huge sail, is made fast to a belaying pin. he loosens the halyard and hands it to robin.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{take a turn under the pin and lead it out to the others. you guys in the rear take up the slack. heave together now...}
<A>__{in a beautiful tenor voice, bill begins to croon a sea chanty, an old whaling song with an irish lilt.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{"when the sun came up there was whisky in the cup..."}
<A>__{the more experienced boys echo the line and pull to the beat.}
<C>__{boys}
<D>__{"when the sun came up there was whisky in the cup..."}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{come on the rest of you, sing! belt it out like men!!}
<A>__{the newer guys like chuck, john, robin and terry look at each other like this is the queerest thing they have ever heard of.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{"not one of us was a sober..."}
<A>__{the boys return the verse half heartedly. lawford ties off his line and stares them down. skipper notices that the work has stopped.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{what's wrong mr. lawford.}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{it seems we're short on singers.}
<A>__{skipper walks amid ship and addresses the crew.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{everyone sings aboard a wind jammer gentlemen. it lets everyone know you're in sync. it shows unity, that all thoughts are one. a crew that sings together stays together. besides, i like it. so, pipe up and be sailors.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(in a whisper)}
<D>__{everybody swims, everybody sings... what's next? tap dancing?}
<A>__{lawford and rick leap up onto the line pulling it down with their body weight. they sing out the chorus. the crew returns the song, somewhat reluctantly as the great mainsail starts to rise.}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{tie it off!!}
<C>__{skipper}
<P>__{(to bill)}
<D>__{outer.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{outer jib!}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{outta what?}
<A>__{coached by tod, another group in the bow, awkwardly hoist the jib.}
<C>__{skipper}
<P>__{(to bill)}
<D>__{we'll bear off to port and run down wind.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{mr. lawford, stand by to ease the mainsheet. rick, get on the jib sheet. george, john, philip, tim and dick go aloft to unstop the forecourse. george will show you what to do. tod, show your men the forward pinrail and stand ready on the buntlines and clewlines. forecourse first... work upward.}
<A>__{the newcomers watch bill with new found respect. george, john and the others climb to the forecourse, and out onto the footropes. it's unsteady work and there's confusion everywhere. but through it all, they continue to sing. lawford moves to the mainsheet on the port side while the others move into their positions. when bill sees the yardarm crew is in place...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{unstop the squares!}
<C>__{yardarm crew}
<D>__{unstop the squares!!}
<C>__{skipper}
<P>__{(to chuck)}
<D>__{fall off to port. ease her around to a heading of northeast. sing out when you're there.}
<A>__{as the tops are released, the giant forecourse drapes into a scalloped pattern. as the bow falls off the wind the snapping main and jib billow. stiffening to the wind, the ship heels and surges forward. before her awakening power, everyone changes their stance and grabs for a handhold. lawford slowly pays out the mainsheet while the forecourse crew move up the ratlines releasing the stops on the other squaresails.}
<C>__{chuck}
<P>__{(in a whisper)}
<D>__{ah... northeast... sir.}
<C>__{skipper}
<P>__{(barking)}
<D>__{speak up boy!}
<A>__{chuck jumps, startled. he self consciously calls out.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{northeast sir!}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{unfurl the squares!}
<A>__{tod's group first uncleats the clewlines and buntlines and the great squaresail drops and billows to fullness sending a shudder through the rig. the bow's wake sizzles with the added surge. as each of the squares fall, alice and lawford move to their sheets, setting each sail's position. chuck looks up, amazed at the sheer magnitude and beauty of the canvas that the albatross carries.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{raise the inner jib! raise the forestaysail!}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{watch the tell tales chuck. if we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{all stop on the engine.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{all stop on the engine!}
<A>__{bill rotates the telegraph handle back and forth and moves it to the stop position.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{behold gentlemen. the power of the wind!}
<A>__{as the sails billow the albatross seems transformed. everyone stops and looks up. the vessel heels and with a powerful surge, launches into the waves. white foam splashes over the bowsprit as the hull thunders through the water. chuck's face is full of wonder. it is a magical moment. then the crew begins to cheer.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{did we lose anybody?}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{not yet.}
<B>__{long shot}
<A>__{the albatross under full sail is the handsome, powerful image of another time. and yet, here she is.}
<B>__{on deck}
<A>__{each of the boys is awed by the majesty of this moment. music builds.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{chart us a course for the windward side.}
<A>__{alice considers his request.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{that low passed through last night. may be a little bumpy out there.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{it's time these boys saw some real blue water.}
