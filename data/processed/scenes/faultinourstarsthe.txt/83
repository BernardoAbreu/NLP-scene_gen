<L>__{exterior vondelstraat row houses later}
<A>__{gus and hazel stand outside van houten's white house.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i'm so excited i can barely breathe.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{as opposed to other days...?}
<A>__{she playfully hits him. he takes her arm, picks up the oxygen tank, and up they go towards his front door. as they approach, there's a noticeable noise coming from inside the house. it's the deep thump of a bass beat. loud. like, obnoxiously loud. hazel grabs the brass ornament and knocks. they wait. there's no response.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{maybe he can't hear over the music?}
<A>__{gus tries again, this time with more force. still nothing. he tries a third time. finally, the music stops. they wait. still excited. a moment later the door swings open. it's a man in pajamas (60s), with a huge potbelly, thinning hair, and a week old beard. all he says is:}
<C>__{man in pajamas}
<D>__{what?!}
<A>__{gus and hazel look to one another. could it be?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{mr. van houten?}
<A>__{at which point, the pajama man slams the door in their faces. hazel and gus are too stunned to react. through the closed door, they hear this:}
<C>__{man in pajamas }
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{leee duh vigh!}
<C>__{woman's voice }
<D>__{are they here, peter?}
<A>__{so it is peter van houten. gus and hazel can't believe it.}
<C>__{man in pajamas }
<D>__{there are two }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{who the hell's "they?"}
<C>__{woman's voice }
<D>__{they are augustus and hazel, the young fans with whom you've been corresponding.}
<A>__{gus and hazel smile at hearing their names. perhaps this will help things take a turn for the better.}
<C>__{man in pajamas }
<D>__{the americans?}
<C>__{woman's voice }
<D>__{you invited them, remember?}
<C>__{man in pajamas }
<D>__{you know why i left america, lidewij? to never have to encounter americans. get rid of them.}
<A>__{hazel and gus can't believe it. this is terrible!}
<C>__{woman's voice }
<D>__{i will not do this peter. be nice.}
<A>__{at which point, the door opens opened by the woman whose voice they'd been hearing van houten's assistant lidewij (30s, dutch, pretty in a bookish way). she virtually shoves van houten towards a stunned gus and hazel. and they are again face to face with van houten. one beat, two beats. no one knows what to say. finally:}
<C>__{van houten}
<D>__{which of you is augustus waters?}
<A>__{gus raises his hand tentatively. van houten sizes them up. without another word, he turns and walks inside at least this time, leaving the door ajar.}
<C>__{lidewij}
<D>__{please. i am sorry. come in.}
<A>__{hazel and gus share one more awkward glance before gus takes a step. hazel follows. they walk:}
