<L>__{interior rusty's car day}
<A>__{rusty glances in his rearview as he drives through the city talking on his cell phone. he's keeping an eye on a white cadillac that seem to be following him.}

<D>__{rusty. what do you want from me?}
<A>__{rusty turns a corner, then glances in his rearview again.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{i want what i paid for.}
<C>__{felix}
<D>__{and that's what i sent.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{no, felix, no. i paid for pure. and if my workshop were on top of mount everest it would be pure. but i'm at sea level, felix, and at sea level it should liquefy at 736.95. if it's pure, that is. which this isn't.}
<A>__{rusty makes another turn. a few seconds later, the cadillac turns behind him.}
<C>__{felix }
<D>__{well, i didn't know you were going to liquefy it.}
<A>__{rusty pulls to a stop light. the cadillac pulls up three cars behind him.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{let me ask you something: when christo calls his cotton supplier and asks for 100% cotton cloth, do you think his supplier sends him 98% cotton and 2% polyester and when that doesn't work, says to christo, "well, you should have told me you were going to wrap the coast of australia"?}
<C>__{felix}
<D>__{who's christo?}
<A>__{rusty looks to the heavens.}
<C>__{rusty}
<D>__{felix, you're in a shame spiral. have your assistant lose my number.}
<A>__{rusty snaps his phone shut.}
<C>__{rusty }
<D>__{my god.}
<A>__{rusty looks into the rear view mirror and then slows the car to a stop. he gets out of his car and slams the door shut. he walks back to the cadillac and knocks on the window. it rolls down electronically to reveal benedict.}
<C>__{rusty }
<D>__{how long you gonna give us?}
