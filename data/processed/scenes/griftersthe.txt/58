<L>__{exterior balcony day}
<A>__{bobo stands looking out at the ocean. he enjoys breathing the sea air. he slowly peels the orange, dropping pieces of peel over the side. lilly appears in the doorway, wearing a too large man's raincoat. bobo doesn't seem to notice her at first, then nods to her.}
<C>__{bobo}
<D>__{almost forgot. that ten grand of yours. it's in the envelope by the door.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(tries for animation)}

<C>__{bobo}
<D>__{see your son, huh? well, that's nice. a side of you i didn't know, lilly.}
<A>__{lilly chances taking a step out onto the balcony. it's vital that she encourage this forgive and forget dialogue.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{he's a good kid. a salesman.}
<C>__{bobo}
<D>__{on the square, huh? and how are you making out these days? stealing much?}
<A>__{bobo's being jolly now. lilly's scared, but has to be jolly, too.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{from you? my folks didn't raise any stupid kids.}
<A>__{bobo's joshing now. he raises a humorous eyebrow.}
<C>__{bobo}
<D>__{not skimming a thing, lilly?}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{oh, well, you know. i just clip a buck here and a buck there. not enough to notice.}
<C>__{bobo}
<P>__{(honest approval)}
<D>__{that's right. take a little, leave a little.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{a person that don't look out for himself is too dumb to look out for anybody else. he's a liability, right, bobo?}
<C>__{bobo}
<P>__{(this is his creed)}
<D>__{you're a thousand percent right!}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{or else he's working an angle. if he doesn't steal a little, he's steeling big.}
<C>__{bobo}
<D>__{you know it, lilly.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{you know, i like that suit, bobo. i don't know what there is about it, but it somehow makes you look taller.}
