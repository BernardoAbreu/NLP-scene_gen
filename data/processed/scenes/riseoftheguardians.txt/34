<D>__{tacks of brass?}
<A>__{as north cracks his knuckles, jack stands silent. the wind suddenly slams north's office door behind them. jack looks to the door, it locks itself, and he turns back. north moves in close to jack, backing him up against the door.}

<D>__{who are you, jack frost? what is your center?}
<A>__{north pokes jack in the chest.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{my center?}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{if man in moon chose you to be a guardian, you must have something very special inside.}
<A>__{north stands up straight and begins to stroke his beard as he gives jack a curious look.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{hmmmm?}
<A>__{north is standing in front of a shelf of russian nesting dolls. one is carved to look like north himself.}
<C>__{north }
<D>__{here. this is how you see me, no? very big, intimidating. but if you get to know me a little }
<P>__{(hands the doll to jack)}
<D>__{well, go on.}
<A>__{jack gives north a curious look, then sets down his staff. he twists the doll in half, and inside is another carved north doll, this one is a more typical santa claus red cheeked and cheery.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you are downright jolly.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{ah, but not just jolly... guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 40.}
<A>__{the dolls get progressively smaller as he twists them open, all versions of north, but all slightly different.}

<D>__{and fearless.}
<P>__{(twist smaller doll)}
<D>__{and caring. and at my center...}

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{there's a tiny wooden baby?}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{look closer. what do you see?}
<A>__{jack holds it up to examine it.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you have big eyes?}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{yes! big eyes. very big. because they are full! of wonder! that is my center. it is what i was born with. eyes that have always seen the wonder in everything!}
<A>__{north raises his hands, and the toys on the shelves suddenly spring to life. jack in the boxes pop, toy trains speed around the room, soldiers march about, toy planes fly overhead. an elf gets carried aloft by a balloon. a flying toy plane glides by and we follow it as it makes its way around the room. a christmas tree is ablaze with bright lights. two double doors suddenly open as the flying car enters the factory floor.}
<C>__{north}
<D>__{eyes that see lights in the trees, and magic in the air!}
<A>__{as it crosses the frame, dozens of other toys are now flying around the massive chamber. it's a truly magical moment. north now stands outside his office, with jack at his side.}

<D>__{this wonder is what i put into the world, and what i protect in children. guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 41.}

<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{jack looks down into his open palm, the wooden baby stares back at him. north closes jack's hand. they exchange a look. then, something suddenly jets past a window outside. almost simultaneously, bunny and sandman come running down the hallway toward north and jack.}
