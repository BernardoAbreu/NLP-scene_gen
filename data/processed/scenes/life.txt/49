<D>__{i'm not gonna forget it. what does that mean? if you've got a plan, i think i have a right to know about it. i told you my plan.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{getting a map from a chubby chef named cookie? dragging our asses through the swamps in search of some worm eaten boat? that ain't a plan, that's a vacation for two in the hole. when you've got a map to new york city, you get back to me.}
