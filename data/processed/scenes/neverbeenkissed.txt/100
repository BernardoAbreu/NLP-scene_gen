<D>__{hey, write a poem about this!}
<A>__{billy and his date lob a few more eggs, and their limo roars off. josie stands on the porch, alone. she's got egg in her hair, on her face, all over her dress everywhere. she starts to cry. softly at first, moving into big, loud, wet sobs. she sits down on the porch, her head in her hands, and just keeps crying.}
