<L>__{interior max's apartment day}
<A>__{max stares intensely at the ticker on the small tv that sits next to his monitors.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{turn lead into gold. the first. right here. right here. with math. the numbers of the stock market are my lead. when i find the pattern, then i will find gold.}
<A>__{max watches the right edge of the screen where the numbers appear. he wants to see what's before that edge... max slaps the return button on his computer. the phone starts ringing. max eyes it suspiciously. just then, euclid starts printing results on an old dot matrix printer. max suspiciously answers the phone.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{maximilian cohen, please.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{mr. cohen?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{who's this?}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{hi. my name is marcy dawson. i'm a partner with the predictive strategy firm lancet percy. can i speak with mr. cohen, please?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i told you...}
<A>__{the printer finishes printing.}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{mr. cohen! how are you? it's been a long time. sorry i haven't been in touch. but i was hoping you would allow me to take you to lunch tomorrow, say one o'clock?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{sorry, i can't.}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{we're very anxious to talk with you, sir}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i can't.}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{i'm prepared to make you a generous...}
<A>__{max hurries to wrap up the conversation.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i don't take offers for my research. you know that. sorry, i couldn't help you.}
<C>__{marcy dawson}
<D>__{mr. cohen, give me a moment...}
<A>__{but before marcy finishes, max hangs up. he rips off the printout and heads to the front door. he checks the peephole, his landlady. mrs. ovadia, is sweeping the hallway stairs humming a turn of the century (the last one, not this one) tune. max waits a moment. he tousles his hair. then he checks again. she's gone. he opens his locks and releases several bolts.}
