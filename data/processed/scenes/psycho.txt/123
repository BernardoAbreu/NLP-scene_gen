<A>__{camera holds as arbogast goes up onto the porch. the house is dark within except, as we can now see, for a faint spill of light in the foyer, light which comes from the upstairs hall. arbogast goes to the living room window, looks in, sees only darkness. then he goes to the door, listens for along moment, hears nothing. very slowly, almost painfully, he turns the knob of the door and pushes gently with his arm and shoulder. the door begins to open. he allows it to open just enough for him to slip through and into the foyer.}
