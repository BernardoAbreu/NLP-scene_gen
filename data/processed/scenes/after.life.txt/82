<L>__{interior funeral home. prep room night}
<A>__{anna lies on the slab. curled in a fetal position. o.s. we hear the unnaturally loud metallic drip of a faulty faucet. slow. rhythmical. anna opens her eyes. stares at us. terrified. then she turns her head. the old woman sits on the other slab. slowly brushing her tangled gray hair with a silver backed brush. anna looks around anxiously. the room is strangely larger. the perspective not quite right. certain objects look absurdly small or abnormally large. she notices a tiny door. half hidden by a steel trolley. the door's slightly ajar. anna's surprised. the old woman shakes her head. staring blindly at anna with opaque eyes. anna ignores her. moves quickly to the tiny door. as she approaches, the door seems to grow to normal size. then we realize it's anna who has shrunk. the steel trolley now towers high above her. the massive instruments on the trolley look like menacing insects cast in surgical steel. she opens the door. revealing a solid wall of darkness.}
<B>__{from inside the darkness}
<A>__{the small shape of anna in the doorway. the huge dark space engulfs her. the only light comes from the prep room behind her.}
<B>__{prep room}
<A>__{anna reaches forward. her hand disappears into the thick blackness. she snatches her hand back. scared. then... ...a child's hand darts out of the darkness. grabs anna's wrist. pulling her in with surprising strength. anna struggles to free herself. but the hand drags her deeper into the darkness. the door slams shut behind her.}
