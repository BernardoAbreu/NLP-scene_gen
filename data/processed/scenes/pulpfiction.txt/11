<L>__{interior apartment building hallway morning}
<A>__{steadicam in front of jules and vincent as they make a beeline down the hall.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{still i hafta say, play with matches, ya get burned.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{whaddya mean?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{you don't be givin' marsellus wallace's new bride a foot massage.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{you don't think he overreacted?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{antwan probably didn't expect marsellus to react like he did, but he had to expect a reaction.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{it was a foot massage, a foot massage is nothing, i give my mother a foot massage.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{it's laying hands on marsellus wallace's new wife in a familiar way. is it as bad as eatin' her out no, but you're in the same fuckin' ballpark.}
<A>__{jules stops vincent.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{whoa... whoa... whoa... stop right there. eatin' a bitch out, and givin' a bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fuckin' thing.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{not the same thing, the same ballpark.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{it ain't no ballpark either. look maybe your method of massage differs from mine, but touchin' his lady's feet, and stickin' your tongue in her holyiest of holyies, ain't the same ballpark, ain't the same league, ain't even the same fuckin' sport. foot massages don't mean shit.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{have you ever given a foot massage?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{don't be tellin' me about foot massages i'm the foot fuckin' master.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{given a lot of 'em?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{shit yeah. i got my technique down man, i don't tickle or nothin'.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{have you ever given a guy a foot massage?}
<A>__{jules looks at him a long moment he's been set up.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<A>__{he starts walking down the hall. vincent, smiling, walks a little bit behind.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{how many?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{would you give me a foot massage i'm kinda tired.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{man, you best back off, i'm gittin' pissed this is the door.}
<A>__{the two men stand in front of the door numbered "49." they whisper.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{what time is it?}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(checking his watch)}
<D>__{seven twenty two in the morning.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{it ain't quite time, let's hang back.}
<A>__{they move a little away from the door, facing each other, still whispering.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{look, just because i wouldn't give no man a foot massage, don't make it right for marsellus to throw antwan off a building into a glass motherfuckin house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. that ain't right, man. motherfucker do that to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause i'd kill'a motherfucker.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i'm not sayin' he was right, but you're sayin' a foot massage don't mean nothing, and i'm sayin' it does. i've given a million ladies a million foot massages and they all meant somethin'. we act like they don't, but they do. that's what's so fuckin' cool about 'em. this sensual thing's goin' on that nobody's talkin about, but you know it and she knows it, fuckin' marsellus knew it, and antwan shoulda known fuckin' better. that's his fuckin' wife, man. he ain't gonna have a sense of humor about that shit.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{that's an interesting point, but let's get into character.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{what's her name again?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{mia. why you so interested in big man's wife?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{well, marsellus is leavin' for florida and when he's gone, he wants me to take care of mia.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{take care of her?}
<A>__{making a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{not that! take her out. show her a good time. don't let her get lonely.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{you're gonna be takin' mia wallace out on a date?}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{it ain't a date. it's like when you and your buddy's wife go to a movie or somethin'. it's just... you know... good company.}
<A>__{jules just looks at him.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{it's not a date.}
<A>__{jules just looks at him.}
