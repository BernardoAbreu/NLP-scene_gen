<L>__{interior stargher house basement day}
<A>__{ramsey leads novak into stargher's "workroom." it's all here, the table, the piercing supplies, the bleach. an odd, grisly collection of dolls fills cubby holes in a wooden storage shelf unit. novak's eyes are like a camera, documenting and storing as much information as possible, but it's overwhelming. he moves through the basement. careful not to touch anything. he stops and focuses on the hoist and eight hooks situated over the stainless steel table. (note: on the winch's motor is a worn plaque reading "carver industrial equipment" with a logo). ramsey switches on the video monitor and the screen fills with images of anne dying in the cell. novak is painfully, tragically drawn to this. although he's seen his share of horrific things, novak is truly disturbed by the sight of anne, desperate to escape, drowning, slowly dying, and he knows: this is what will happen to julia hickson unless he finds her.}
