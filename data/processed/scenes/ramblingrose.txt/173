<A>__{a shot of rose as she walks up to a bus stop. a fairly well dressed man with a door to door salesman kit is standing there. rose glances at him then sidles up alongside him as if she's waiting for a bus. he glances at her for a moment with interest, but doesn't want to stare, looks away. we see the model a stop in the background of the shot.}
