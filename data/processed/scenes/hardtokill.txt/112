<A>__{joe bear waits concealed at the top of the stairs, on an interior balcony overlooking the living room, atrium style. through the mouth opening of his ski mask, we see he is smiling a sick smile and sensually stroking his bowie knife. angle tracking storm storm and andy scramble up the staircase onto the atrium balcony and out steps joe bear with his knife and his smile. joe bear, for the first time in his life, is surprised when storm smiles too. joe bear screams like an animal and lunges with his knife. storm stabs out his left arm like a spear and tilts his body ever so slightly, then clamps joe bear's wrist with his right hand. allowing his tremendous momentum to culminate like a hurricane, storm manipulates him in a full circle, catapulting joe bear unbelievably into a tall t'ang dynasty cabinet filled with priceless oriental artifacts!}

<A>__{hurls joe bear's massive body down upon the attackers! jones takes the tonnage head on and is crushed beneath it! ford dodges, unleashes a burst of automatic fire straight up at the balcony. storm shoves andy to safety onto the exterior balcony and dives there himself, just as the whole interior balcony is riddled by ford's bullets! ford bolts for the staircase, coming after storm. storm, crouched around the corner on the exterior balcony, waits till ford hurtles into view at the top of the staircase. storm fires his .45 furiously ... ford springs back, storm's bullets blast the staircase wall to ribbons. his .45 clicks empty!}
