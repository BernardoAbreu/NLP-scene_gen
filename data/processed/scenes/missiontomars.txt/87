<L>__{interior eva airlock. day}
<A>__{as woody enters, stripped from the mmu, dripping with sweat, mcconnell is waiting for him. for a moment the two men just look at each other, then they surge forward into a fierce hug.}
<C>__{woody}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{know what? you've got enough left.}
<A>__{mcconnell looks at him, understands. terri sits nearby, where she has just finished stitching up phil's hand. as woody goes to her, she rises from her seat and looks at him tears of relief and pride in her eyes.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{piece of cake?}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{well. easier than the cha cha.}
<A>__{he scoops her into his arms; they kiss passionately. phil is blinking; something seems to be getting into his own eyes. his voice catches for a moment.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{i don't know what you're getting so cocky about. we scored better times in the sim at least twice.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{how's his hand?}
<A>__{terri separates from woody, looks down at phil.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{seems ok. couple of the tendons are going to be a little tight for awhile. try to close your fingers, phil, nice and slowly.}
<A>__{phil starts curling up his fingers. the middle digit remains extended in the universal gesture. they all consider this for a moment. then phil looks up cheerfully.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{well, at least i will still be able to drive.}
<A>__{after a split second they get it, and the whole crew roars with laughter, which builds and builds; they're almost giddy with the relief of the tension...}
