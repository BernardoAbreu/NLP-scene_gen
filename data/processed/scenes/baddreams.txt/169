<L>__{interior front room night}
<A>__{they walk in. the room is filled with people. there is a fire in the hearth. children play. candles illuminate the space. unity members smile and great her casually as she passes them. miriam in talking with a bearded man intently.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{cynthia, i'm so glad you're here.}
<A>__{ed and connie are by the fireplace with some others. they smile at cynthia knowingly. lana is sitting contentedly on the window seat reading with some children. ralph is crouched with victor in a corner. they are laughing warmly. gilda comes up to her. she is ebullient, happier, healthier looking than we've ever seen her.}
<C>__{gilda}
<D>__{cynthia, it's so wonderful here, but we miss you terribly.}
<A>__{cynthia nears harris. he smiles at her and kisses her. everyone in the room turns to her. harris holds up a shiny and sharp knife with ornamentation on the handle. cynthia doesn't see it yet. he puts the pointed tip against her chest.}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{it's time, cynthia. it's finally time, isn't it?}
<C>__{everyone}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(fighting the vision)}
<D>__{you don't exist.}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{i wouldn't say that.}
<P>__{(he touches her)}
<D>__{go on. take the knife.}
<A>__{she can't escape his gaze.}
<C>__{harris }
<D>__{do it. you know you want to.}
<C>__{gilda}
<D>__{you know you do, cynthia.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{you'll see how beautiful it is.}
<C>__{someone else}
<D>__{you will.}
<A>__{cynthia clasps her hand around the knife at her chest, harris lets go. she holds it there by herself, completely hypnotized by his words, by his eyes.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{cynthia, we're only telling you this because we love you.}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{beautiful lovechild. all will be in balance when you've joined us. all will be right when daughter is with father.}
<C>__{someone}
<D>__{you're special, cynthia.}
<C>__{someone else}
<D>__{scared blood... daughter of the father.}
<A>__{cynthia in mortified.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i'm...?}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{now you remember.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{yes...}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{my own beautiful lovechild. everyone has proven their love to me. now you must.}
<A>__{she is weak now. she is about to do it. her grasp tightens around the knife handle. she's trembling. she takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{she jams the knife into harris' throat and pulls it out.}
<C>__{cynthia }
<D>__{no i don't! i don't love you! i don't need you!}
<A>__{she is crazed. she flies around the room brandishing the knife at everyone. they back off.}
<C>__{cynthia }
<D>__{i never loved any of you! i hate you! i hate you all! what you did was wrong!}
<A>__{she swats the knife at them all. victor's arm gets cut. gilda has to dive away from her. cynthia is knocking over lamps and chairs in her rage. she is crying hysterically.}
<C>__{cynthia }
<D>__{it was wrong! it was stupid!}
<C>__{harris}
<P>__{(saddened)}
<D>__{oh, cynthia.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i never needed you! any of you!}
<A>__{we are tight on cynthia. she is winding down, crying with her face buried in her arms.}
<C>__{cynthia }
<D>__{i never did...}
<A>__{she is still. gradually, the silence fills with a quiet}
<B>__{breeze.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{cynthia?}
<A>__{she drops the knife. the knife is all rusty and corroded. the floor is a charred mass. cynthia turns around. alan comes in the front door. the room is again its empty, skeletal self, blackened and silent. cynthia is trembling. she walks out of the room.}
<C>__{alan }
<D>__{are you all right?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{let's go.}
