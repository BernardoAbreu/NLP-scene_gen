<L>__{interior smoky room night}
<A>__{chaos. the air is thick with cigar smoke and harsh words. a dozen men some officers, some civilians are fighting bitterly, everyone talking at once. stauffenberg enters unnoticed, escorted in by the young officer who immediately ducks out again. stauffenberg scans the faces in the room. we recognize olbricht and tresckow. with them we find... a distinguished gentleman in his early sixties: titles: erwin von witzleben former field marshal of the military district. forced out by hitler, 1938. beside him is a rough hewn, charismatic man despite his 59 years. a face millions might follow. he is: titles: dr. carl goerdeler former mayor of leipzig. resigned in protest, 1937. and finally, a grandfatherly sort with surprisingly kind eyes, sitting outside the fight tired and saddened by it. titles: ludwig beck former chief of staff for the german army. resigned in protest, 1938.}
<C>__{witzleben}
<D>__{...he is not a man, he's a lunatic. he doesn't drink, he doesn't fuck. he has no weakness to exploit, no vice to manipulate. his only passion is complete control. how can you expect to reason with him?}
<C>__{goerdeler}
<D>__{after this most recent failure i'd say we've no other choice.}
<C>__{witzleben}
<D>__{confront hitler now and you'll end up with piano wire for a neck tie. our only option is the central solution.}
<C>__{goerdeler}
<D>__{he's a man like any other. flesh and blood. take him head on and }
<C>__{tresckow}
<D>__{i will say this for you, doctor... you're certainly delusional enough to take hitler's place.}
<C>__{goerdeler}
<P>__{(eyes narrowing)}
<D>__{when that day comes, i will be sure to remember you.}
<C>__{tresckow}
<D>__{i doubt you'll remember much of anything.}
<C>__{goerdeler}
<D>__{dammit, tresckow }
<A>__{and the shouting resumes. it is beck who finally sees stauffenberg. he touches tresckow's arm. he, in turn, nudges olbricht and so on. a moment later, the room is silent, all eyes on the colonel. everyone is a little embarrassed. olbricht clears his throat:}
<C>__{olbricht}
<D>__{gentlemen, may i present colonel stauffenberg. he's been reassigned to my office at the war ministry.}
<P>__{(to stauffenberg)}
<D>__{colonel, may i introduce }
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{these men need no introduction.}
<A>__{beck stands, shaking stauffenberg's hand.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{i apologize for this unfortunate... spectacle. on behalf of everyone, welc }
<A>__{but before he can finish, beck is seized with a gravelly cough that sends an uncomfortable chill through the room. he is very ill.}
<C>__{goerdeler}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{i haven't welcomed him. not yet. where does he stand?}
<C>__{tresckow}
<D>__{for god's sake }
<C>__{goerdeler}
<P>__{(re: stauffenberg)}
<D>__{he's a field officer. he knows the army better than any of us. i want to hear his opinion.}
<C>__{tresckow}
<P>__{(to stauffenberg)}
<D>__{all right. what do you think, colonel? confront hitler, force him to resign? or the central solution?}
<A>__{but before stauffenberg can answer:}
<C>__{goerdeler}
<D>__{"central solution." you soldiers are all the same. say what you mean.}
<C>__{witzleben}
<D>__{that's a laugh coming from a politician.}
<C>__{goerdeler}
<D>__{the army will follow diplomats before they follow assassins.}
<C>__{tresckow}
<D>__{they follow a butcher now. what difference does it }
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{what makes you think the army will follow you at all?}
<A>__{the room quiets down. beck hides a slight smile. he likes stauffenberg already.}
<C>__{stauffenberg }
<D>__{oust him, kill him. that isn't what matters. how do you plan to take control of the government when hitler is gone?}
<A>__{silence. then a wave of laughter. "the balls on this guy."}
<C>__{goerdeler}
<D>__{i beg your pardon, colonel, but you are in the presence of men who would have been hitler's inner circle. instead we resigned. we put our principles above personal gain.}
<C>__{witzleben}
<D>__{we have the have the respect of the people. and the army.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{with all respect, sir, you put too much faith in your popularity.}
<P>__{(to goerdeler, pointed)}
<D>__{all of you do.}
<C>__{goerdeler}
<D>__{now see here, colonel }
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{you said yourself, i'm a field officer. you all may understand government, but i know the men. a great many of them may hate hitler, but they all fear him they fear himmler, goebbels, the whole of the reich. that kind of fear won't just die with hitler. and as for respect: the army, and the people, respect only one thing. authority. and if just one man questions that authority, you can lose them all.}
<P>__{(to beck, pointed)}
<D>__{they were fooled into following hitler... how will you fool them force them into following you?}
<A>__{pause. the conspirators look at one another again, unsure of how to answer. for stauffenberg it is a dreadful revelation.}
