<L>__{interior un suv exterior florida bar day}
<A>__{kathy's suv throws up gravel. out her windscreen, she sees the florida bar: a dilapidated two story building, painted a garish pink. crude palm trees painted on the side. kathy jumps out of her suv, and moves towards... local police smoke by police cars. a local cop leads a cluster of young women out the door. they blink in the glaring light, pale, out of place, lost... at the end of the line, is luba. her eyes darting between kathy and the local cops, helpless. kathy rushes towards the cop. he eyes her, dubious.}

<A>__{he moves past her, with the girls in tow.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{hold on. where are the iptf monitoring this raid?}
<A>__{shouting echoes from inside the bar. two cops drag out tanjo zravbic, 50s. he sees kathy's uniform and shouts at her.}
<C>__{tanjo }
<D>__{zra slobovik brvicetic revic barziny traba! motherfockers!}
<A>__{the cops shove tanjo in a car, and slam the door. kathy turns to the local cop, standing with the group of girls.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{is that the owner? are you taking him into custody?}
<C>__{local cop}
<D>__{xivy slovic drinjnislava porslivky.}

<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{is there a translator on the scene? translator?... wait.}
<A>__{he stops, impatient. kathy pulls out her walkie.}
<C>__{kathy }
<D>__{this is kathy bolkovac. i need an interpreter. at the florida bar.}

<D>__{now.}
<C>__{walkie voice }
<D>__{that's impossible. we need advance notice for field calls.}
<A>__{the local cop talks at the girls. they don't understand him, but his tone is clear: total disrespect. kathy moves toward them, protectively, then sees... two un suvs parked on the other side of the bar. two iptf monitors emerge from the bar. kathy approaches them. they seem surprised.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{hey. i'm from gender affairs. i }
<C>__{fred murray}
<D>__{hey. fred murray.}
<A>__{he shakes her hand. tanjo bangs on the window, inside the police car, apopleptic with rage. kathy glances over her shoulder.}

<D>__{oh... okay. but there's... we just had two girls come in to a human rights office, saying they escaped from this place.}
<A>__{fred seems confused. kathy pulls out a clipboard.}
<C>__{fred murray}
<D>__{yeah. local police have been watching the place for a while. this whole thing happened pretty fast. i guess those girls must've run for it.}
<A>__{kathy looks over as the girls are put into a van.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{well, the girls in our field office seemed pretty scared. i should follow up with these ones.}
<A>__{the local cops start to move, stubbing out cigarettes, getting in cars. the local cop shuts the doors of the van.}
<C>__{fred murray}
<D>__{you can see where they're taking them, but i can't intervene. you know the drill.}
<A>__{he shrugs and smiles. kathy hears the police van's engine start. turning to it...}
