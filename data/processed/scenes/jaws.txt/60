<A>__{brody picks up the radio, flicking on knobs and lights on the complex console.}
<C>__{quint }
<D>__{beg your pardon }
<A>__{angle doorway quint appears, silhouetted in the hot light of the door, raising his bat.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{duty first and pleasure after }
<A>__{close brody looking up in horror, covering his face. close quint quint brings down the bat with all the strength he can summon. crash! sparks fly, lights blink and go out, plastic and sections of metal ricochet all over the cabin as quint demolishes the ship to shore radio. quint takes a happy breath, winks at brody and hands him the bat.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{excuse me!}
<A>__{brody's adrenaline turns his fear into rage. his glasses are cracked or broken by flying pieces of radio. he seizes the bat, and pound the shattered radio for emphasis.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{some great idea! now where are we? some goddamn skipper you are. you're certifiable, y'know that? you're a real treat! certifiable! bananas!}
<A>__{his tirade is interrupted by an urgent bellow from hooper. close hooper pointing at the fin.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{coming right to us!}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{no comin' right at us! slow ahead, he'll hit us head on }
<P>__{(the engine clanks)}
<D>__{slower! throttle back }
<A>__{angle over the bow}
<C>__{quint}
<P>__{(raising harpoon)}
<D>__{hard to port!}
<A>__{hooper pulls the boat into a tight turn and quint has a shot at the upward rolling flank. he sinks it with careful precision.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{try shakin' that out!}
<A>__{brody emerges from the cabin as the rope zips overboard, and the barrel, changing over, catapults into the air before plunging into the ocean in a cloudy splash.}
<C>__{brody}
<P>__{(shouting to quint)}
<D>__{did you get him in the head?}
<C>__{quint}
<P>__{(to brody)}
<D>__{no! no! no!}
<P>__{(to hooper)}
<D>__{swing around! after him!}
<B>__{on the flybridge}
<A>__{hooper can see the fin racing ahead of the barrel. diving down. up again quint prepares another iron. brody is digging in his bag. he comes up with his 2" .357 service revolver.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{more gas... go to half! get me right alongside him }
<A>__{the engine thuds and knocks.}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(shouting down)}
<D>__{we can't rev it up this high }
<A>__{suddenly the barrel gongs into the side of the orca.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{watch it!}
<A>__{hooper skillfully avoids the speeding rope.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{atta boy!}
<A>__{quint leans to one side, harpoon over his head. the great white breaks water and...}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{take two, they're small!}
<A>__{he sinks it deep. we hear shots. as the new rope whips out, brody can be seen standing on the gunwale, in regulation police combat pistol stance, holding his .357 in both hands, firing at the shark's head. quint shakes his head in amused disbelief at this, as the barrel goes over.}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(shouting at brody)}
<D>__{don't shoot him any more! he's crazy on his own blood already!}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{i can't stand here doing nothing!}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{order in the court!}
<B>__{water level angle}
<A>__{he has seen the two barrels pop to the surface.}
<C>__{quint}
<P>__{(racing over)}
<D>__{three'll do it! he's havin' trouble with two!}
<A>__{he yells to hooper and brody as he swings behind the controls.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{grab yourselves a couple of poles!}
<A>__{quint steers "slow ahead," engine protesting, as he maneuvers toward the moving barrels. quint peers down, steering closer and closer.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{get ready! now snag 'em!}
<A>__{together brody and hooper hook a barrel rope and hold on for dear life as the shark changes course.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{pull in the ropes and tie 'em onto the transom free ride.}
<A>__{brody and hooper pull in with all they are worth as quint helps out by wheeling in a circle. he laughs to himself, enjoying the spectacle. close hooper securing the rope to a cleat but allowing the barrel to hang overboard. brody ties his now perfect bowline adjacent cleat. wide angle orca the boat is jarred violently from side to side as the underwater force of the great white jerks and heaves them to and fro, up and down, side to side... angle hooper and brody are both torn off their feet as the boat is thrust forward. flybridge quint sees the fin ahead. it is pulling the boat.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{get tired! that's the idea! here's a little reverse for you!}
<A>__{the shark leaps partially out of the water, and the sight is both horrifying and awesome. its jaws break water, snapping at the ropes that have him snarled and frustrated. quint throws the orca into neutral and shouts down:}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{haul in watch the prop!}
<A>__{with that, quint slides down to the prow, putting another shaft onto his gun, finding satisfaction in its heft and balance. the shark can be seen directly ahead, threshing closer.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{now! untie 'em! quick! he'll tear us to pieces.}
<A>__{he fires the iron, and the shark veers downward in a gushing shower of spray.}
<B>__{hooper and brody}
<A>__{they are trying to untie from the cleats, but both ropes are stretched too taut. they jump out of the way, falling flat on the deck as the ropes sweep over them, knocking over objects, skeetering across the deck. a tight jerking motion, and the orca is dragged through the water backwards. and much too fast. water is splashing up over the transom in its backward wake. the engines groan and complain.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{damn head is too far away. he's too big.}
<A>__{wrenched to one side, quint is knocked from his feet. close the two cleats a moment of slackness, and then a great surge of raw strength. the rope snaps the cleats off, screws and splintered wood spraying and the barrels fly over the water. they disappear beneath the turbulent grey surface. the three men, breathing heavily, bruised and pouring sweat, look out at the blank water. angle ocean pop pop pop. one, two, three, the barrels surface ready for more.}
<C>__{quint}
<P>__{(amazed at the shark's strength)}
<D>__{he can't go so deep. not with all those on him.}
<A>__{brody looks down at his feet. there is salt water up to their shoe tops.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{what about us?}
<C>__{quint}
<P>__{(mentally assessing the damage)}
<D>__{have to pump her steady, s'all.}
<A>__{the barrels start a wide circle, each cuts through the water, pushing a wave before it and leaving a wake behind.}
<C>__{quint}
<P>__{(to hooper)}
<D>__{follow him }
<P>__{(to brody)}
<D>__{you start pumpin' out here.}
<A>__{quint tosses brody the hand pump, then picks up his m 1, and checks the load.}
<C>__{hooper }
<P>__{(on bridge)}
<D>__{he's heading under !}
<C>__{quint}
<P>__{(incredulously)}
<D>__{no way! he can't!}
<A>__{angle ocean the barrels approaching the orca dip below the surface, one two three.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{where'd he go?}
<A>__{brody looks around. hooper on the flying bridge searching in all directions. quint is looking more appalled every second.}
<C>__{quint}
<P>__{(helplessly)}
<D>__{he can't stay down with three barrels on him! where is he?!}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{have you ever had one do this?}
<C>__{quint}
<P>__{(and he means this)}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{booming thud at the keel. brody slides on the wet deck and quint loses his footing, falling into brody's arms.}
<B>__{with hooper on the fly bridge}
<A>__{it seems the only place out of reach of the shark. quint climbs up, brody following him, reloading his pistol. just then, the barrels pop up ahead, veer left, and duck under.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{follow him!}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{he's under!}
<B>__{brody and his point of view}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{there!}
<P>__{(points wildly)}
<A>__{the barrels have surfaced and we see the monster shadow sliding under the orca, seemingly endless. violent scraping sounds.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{he's trying to sink us!}
<C>__{quint}
<P>__{(to hooper)}
<D>__{dead astern! zig zag!}
<A>__{quint is grimly silent. brody senses that quint is in the fight of (and for) his life. the orca taking evasive action. but the three barrels are closing the gap, the engines coughing and missing, destroying themselves with every rotation of the damaged shaft.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{he's chasing us! i don't believe it.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{full throttle! to port!}
<B>__{angle on the bridge}
<A>__{hooper is jamming the throttle forward, but the engine is pounding and knocking wildly. the barrels circle and move in. quint has his rifle ready.}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(suddenly giving quint the wheel)}
<D>__{hold her.}
<A>__{he leaps to his gear, trying desperately to get his dart gun. just then, the shark attacks, breaking water and rising over the boat like a rocket; snout, jaws, pectoral fins, belly, falling sideways. a vast spray drenches the men. quint fires into the belly, the bullets pocking the smooth whiteness.}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(loading)}
<D>__{keep him there! keep him!}
<A>__{the orca shudders from side to side. from hooper's point of view we can the shark gripping the transom in his jaws, shaking the boat as he saws his massive head from side to side, trying to tear a chunk out of the very hull. quint has reloaded and is firing into the fish. brody has a wicked pointed gaff, and is swinging wildly at the snout, gashing and gouging it, trying for the eyes. the killing lust is on all three men.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{throttling back!}
<A>__{the boat surges, the shark gives a final unbalances wrench, and disengages. the dorsal fin circles off, beginning a wide loop around the boat. the engine quivers and dies, the boat without power, rolling half awash, a wounded victim. the fin dips, the barrels follow, the shark disappears beneath the waves. there is complete silence.}
<B>__{the three men on deck}
<A>__{in the dead quiet, we can hear the lap of waves against the hull, the hoarse panting breathing of the men, the pings and pops of the cooling, dying engines.}
<B>__{quint and the transom}
<A>__{he eyes the stern. huge cracks and broken timber testify to the fury of the attack.}
<C>__{quint}
<P>__{(very quietly, to hooper)}
<D>__{what can that gun of yours do?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{power head with 20 ccs of strychnine nitrate. if i can hit him. i can kill him. but i gotta be close. very close.}
<C>__{brody}
<P>__{(the awful realization)}
<D>__{you gotta go in the water...}
