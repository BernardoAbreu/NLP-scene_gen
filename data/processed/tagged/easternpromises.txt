<D>__{it's 5.30pm in late december and rain is pouring. the scant christmas decorations are hanging limp in the rain. a young turk (ekrem) runs through the rain with a turkish newspaper held over his head. he ducks into a traditional barber's shop called ozim's.}
<L>__{interior ozim's barber shop evening}
<P>__{the shutters are drawn. ozim (a plump middle aged turk)}
<D>__{is cutting the hair of the last customer of the day (soyka). soyka is a chechen, well groomed, wearing a sharp suit beneath the barber's gown. during the conversation we glimpse distinctive eagle and star shaped tattoos on soyka's arms and hands. ozim and soyka are chatting as ekrem enters. soyka speaks with a russian accent.}
<C>__{ozim}
<D>__{guvenilmez... daginik... bloody kids, you know... he says `but amca it's christmas?... christmas! we're islam!}
<C>__{soyka}
<D>__{oi, how much are you taking off?}
<C>__{ozim}
<D>__{christmas! so i said to him... alisverise cimac. the kid's sixteen... ozim brushes some hair off the customer's shoulder and ozim finally acknowledges ekrem, who is shivering and wet near to the door. ekrem turns the `open' sign to `closed'.}
<C>__{ozim }
<D>__{they don't want to work do they. shicma....}
<C>__{ekrem}
<P>__{(hesitantly interrupting)}
<D>__{uncle ozim....... we see for the first time that ekrem is shaking with fear as well as cold.}
<C>__{ozim}
<D>__{this is him. the kid i'm talking about. ekrem approaches, stiffened by terror. soyka nods at ekrem in the mirror.}
<C>__{soyka}
<D>__{he looks ok to me... how you doin' ekrem? soyka offers ekrem a hand to shake and ekrem stares at it as if it were enchanted...}
<C>__{ozim}
<D>__{he looks ok, yeah, but he won't do one lousy thing for me. here, look... ekrem, take this... ozim takes an open razor from behind a line of hair tonic bottles and hands it to ekrem, who now looks mortally terrified.}

<D>__{ozim... memnum etmek.}
<C>__{ozim}
<D>__{we had a deal now he's backing out.}
<C>__{soyka}

<D>__{take it ekrem.}

<D>__{ozim, it's ok. i don't want a shave.}
<C>__{ozim}
<D>__{this is the kid who walks around like al capone. take the fucking ustura and finish this rushca.}
<C>__{soyka}
<P>__{(startled)}
<D>__{what? soyka rises up from the seat, casting off his barber's gown. ozim yells `kabuka! and ekrem snarls, flicks open the razor and drags it across soyka's throat. soyka's scream bubbles in the blood.}
<L>__{exterior kilburn high road night}
<D>__{we dissolve to a christmas decoration flashing on and off in the rain, high on a lamp post in kilburn high road. we pan down the lamp post to the high road where revelers are}
<P>__{hurrying through the rain. we see a young girl (tatiana)}

<D>__{we see tatiana unconscious on a wheeled trolley bursting through double doors into the operating ward of trafalgar hospital. the trolley is accompanied by two nurses, a junior doctor and a midwife, (anna khitrova). the two paramedics who brought her are following behind the trolley.}

<D>__{a tiny brown handbag is being shaken empty by a nurse. tatiana is being prepared for an emergency caesarean. the theater is full of people in scrubs, including an anesthetist. monitors and drips are being attached at double speed. we notice that her arms are already dotted with festering needle marks. a nurse searches through the contents of the handbag and we can hear frantic activity from the operating table....}
<C>__{nurse 1}
<D>__{her stats are very poor, very poor. baby's very distressed. anna approaches the nurse, who is rummaging through the contents of the bag. we see a business card from a restaurant called `the trans siberian', a st. christopher necklace and a tiny battered diary. anna grabs the diary.}
<C>__{junior doctor}
<D>__{shoulder distocia, i think. stuck on the pubic bone. cut to anna at tatiana's head. anna strokes her face and speaks softly.}

<C>__{junior doctor}
<D>__{anna, i'm trying to rotate the shoulder medially... shit... the junior doctor is breathing hard with a look of utter panic as he attempts to free the baby. the doors burst open and a more senior doctor in his mid thirties (doctor aziz) enters at a gallop. as he enters...}
<C>__{nurse 1}
<D>__{baby stats sixty eight and in free fall.}
<C>__{nurse 2}

<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{we need to get the baby out now. aziz knows he can take anna's word...}
<C>__{aziz}
<D>__{ok, let's go. all hell is let loose. as the caesarean process begins at frantic speed, we slowly zoom in on tatiana's unconscious face and hear her voice in v.o... a young girl's voice speaking with an russian accent. the crosstalk between nurses and doctors becomes more and more frantic.}
<C>__{tatiana }
<D>__{my name is tatiana. my father died in the mines in my village, so he was already buried when he died. we were all buried there. buried under the soil of russia. that is why i left to find a better life. we hear... a baby cry. anna's face appears in our framed shot of tatiana's face. she gently kisses tatiana's cheek.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{you had a girl. a sheet is pulled over tatiana's face. a nurse weighs the screaming baby. anna wipes her brow with the back of her bloody wrist.}

<D>__{oh, don't be ridiculous. he grins.}
<C>__{aziz}
<D>__{and you have to open it in front of me. aziz smiles as anna unwraps a pair of leather motorcycling gloves. she looks up at him, expressionless.}

<P>__{(deadpan))}
<D>__{in the whole entire history of my life, i have never felt this special.}

<L>__{interior helen's house. anna's bedroom day}
<D>__{after the bright airiness of the bike ride, we are suddenly in anna's bedroom where the curtains are drawn. anna is lying awake on the bed, wearing a dressing gown.}
<C>__{tatiana }
<D>__{...he said the future of everything was already happening in all those places. there is a gentle knock at the door, which opens before anna can respond. it is anna's mother (helen) with a cup of tea.}

<D>__{did you sleep?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{a bit.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{there's no point us tiptoeing around if you're not even sleeping. helen puts the tea on the dressing table, then turns to leave without a smile.}

<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(contrite)}
<D>__{of course not. it's christmas.}
<L>__{interior helen's house. kitchen day}
<D>__{anna is pouring two glasses of sherry. helen is peeling potatoes. anna peers at helen... and sees tears. they share a moment of stifled emotion. helen wipes her eyes with her sleeve.}

<D>__{it's the chicken.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{the smell of chicken roasting reminds me of him.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you should have done beef, then. they look at each other and giggle. they both have potato peelers in their wet hands, sleeves rolled up, two practical unsentimental women being almost consumed by the same wave of emotion.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{it wouldn't be christmas without tears in the gravy, would it. we hear a gruff russian voice calling out from the living room (uncle stepan).}
<C>__{stepan }
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{anna! anna! where did you get this? anna and helen roll their eyes.}
<C>__{helen}

<C>__{stepan}
<D>__{do you always rob the bodies of the dead?}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(suppressed, familiar anger)}
<D>__{of course, we all do it. it's one of the perks of working in a hospital. stepan grumbles, accustomed to this teasing. helen enters carrying a bowl of walnuts and brazil nuts which she places on the table. pause. stepan looks pointedly at helen.}
<C>__{stepan}
<D>__{did you know that your daughter robs the bodies of the dead?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{stepan, is there an address? stepan lays the diary aside, obstinate and prim.}
<C>__{stepan}
<D>__{you have an uncle who doesn't steal things from the dead. not even their secrets.}

<D>__{oh, don't go all momentous on us, stepan.}
<P>__{(she straightens the table cloth)}
<D>__{lift your elbows.}
<C>__{stepan}
<D>__{you should put this in her coffin, anna. bury her secrets with her bodies.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{body. singular. stepan leaves in a huff. anna picks up the diary and begins to study it. she sees the `trans siberian' business card between the pages.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{how long will dinner be? helen looks at anna, suspecting an attempt to escape.}
<L>__{exterior london streets day}
<D>__{driving music as we see anna riding her motorbike through deserted morning streets again. we should begin to sense that this is a kind of release for her. we hear tatiana in v.o.}
<C>__{tatiana }
<D>__{when i was little, london was like a place in the bible. i wasn't even sure if it was real. my friend has told me there is a place in london where they pay girls to sing. anna arrives outside the `trans siberian' restaurant. it has a russian themed frontage in blue and gold, expensively and recently finished. tatiana (v.o.) (cont'd) he said if i sang in this restaurant i would make more money in a week than my father made in a year. as anna pulls up we hear a dog begin to bark.}
<L>__{exterior trans siberian restaurant. side entrance day}
<D>__{the side door opens to reveal a hard looking, handsome russian man (nikolai), who stops to groom his hair back from his face and put on a pair of sunglasses as he emerges into daylight. he steps into a small courtyard, where a fierce doberman dog is barking and snarling on the end of a chain. nikolai is followed by kirill, who is a little younger, slim and pretty but hard looking too. kirill is dressed in a crumpled t shirt and jeans and looks like he had a heavy night. nikolai ignores the dog as he walks by but kirill yells at it and teases it with a whoop and few russian curses. nikolai unbolts the gate to the street.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{so you pick up ozim and his bitch of a wife and you bring them back here. he glances back at the restaurant and speaks softly.}
<C>__{kirill }
<D>__{then i will think of an excuse and we can get away.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i will think of an excuse. your excuses are like fucking fairy tales. kirill grins and nikolai flicks the fob of his car keys. the lights on an expensive black mercedes glow in response. kirill notices anna locking up her bike at the front of the restaurant.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{who the fuck's that? they both see anna removing her crash helmet and shaking out her hair. she walks towards the front door.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{maybe somebody sent your dad a hooker for christmas.}
<C>__{kirill}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{you're so... fucking unbelievably disrespectful. kirill sees that nikolai is studying anna and his grin fades. we sense jealousy.}
<C>__{kirill }
<D>__{hey, you've got work to do. go... kirill grabs nikolai's face to distract him, gives him a playful slap, but there is somehow more to it than playfulness. nikolai gets into his car. kirill glares at anna as she approaches the front of the restaurant.}
<L>__{exterior trans siberian restaurant day}
<D>__{as nikolai drives away, anna rings the doorbell beside the front door. there is no reply. she is about to ring again when the door opens. we see semyon, a russian man in his late sixties. he is wiping his hands on a tea towel, dressed in a spotlessly white apron. he has the sparkling piercing eyes of a falcon.}

<D>__{we are closed.}

<D>__{kirill! the berries are too low, too low. and roman, more glasses for red!}
<P>__{(he claps his hands)}
<D>__{come on! kirill follows anna's progress through the restaurant with a glare. there are three little girls in extravagant party frocks, all holding violins and giggling near to the door that leads to the kitchen. semyon stops when he reaches them and puts his hands on his hips.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{my angels. you should be practising. you must make the wood cry. like this, like this... semyon grabs a violin and plays a three second burst of sad russian violin music.}

<D>__{you see... semyon hurries on into the kitchen. anna smiles, delighted at the eccentric old man.}
<L>__{interior trans siberian restaurant. kitchen day}
<D>__{inside the kitchen there is an inferno of activity, steam, smoke. family members, some dressed in their party outfits, others in chefs' uniforms, are standing over steaming pots, laughing, arguing. children play and yell. you can almost smell christmas. anna enters, dazzled by it all, overwhelmed by the contrast to her own lifeless christmas kitchen. semyon calls out to everyone.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{come, come, hurry, hurry. they will be here any moment.}
<P>__{(to anna)}
<D>__{ok, show me this card. anna reaches into her pocket and produces the `trans siberian' business card she found in tatiana's bag. semyon angles his head to look as he stirs.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{it is the old card. from before the renovations. but even so, if she had worked here i would remember the name. perhaps she ate here once. try this. semyon offers anna a spoonful of his gravy. she sips it.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{god, that's amazing. my dad made gravy just like that. semyon shrugs and smiles, his eyes twinkling, then goes back to stirring. he speaks as if unconcerned.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{so did you get a chance to talk to this girl before she died?}
<L>__{exterior trans siberian restaurant day}
<D>__{nikolai's black mercedes pulls up outside the restaurant and parks a few inches from anna's motorbike. the rear windows are sun shaded so we only see nikolai in the driver's seat. he gets out of the car and opens the rear door of the car for an elegantly dressed turkish lady in her fifties. nikolai goes to the other rear door. the portly figure of ozim the barber emerges. as ozim gets out he gives nikolai a fifty pound note.}
<L>__{interior trans siberian restaurant. kitchen day}
<D>__{two of the little girl violinists are fighting, pulling each other's hair. the third is sobbing, sitting on the floor. a young woman in a party dress is carrying a huge silver bowl of sauce across the kitchen. anna looks delighted at the noise and energy of the place. finally semyon emerges from a cloud of steam with a scrap of paper.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{this is an agency that hires casual kitchen staff. maybe you will have more luck there. but i think they will be closed until new year. as anna takes the address, kirill puts his head around the door and yells through the noise.}

<D>__{ten minutes!!}
<P>__{(to the rest of the kitchen)}
<D>__{fish, fish, fish! ten minutes! ok, kirill, get him a drink and tell him i am coming. semyon takes a pot from the heat, suddenly flustered.}

<D>__{anna, i'm so sorry i couldn't help. it is sad.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{that's ok. i will probably find out more when i get her diary translated.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{her diary? there is the tiniest of changes in semyon's manner. he lays his heavy pot down.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i found her diary in her bag. a pause. semyon disappears into a billow of steam to put a pan onto the heat then re emerges.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{why did you not tell me you found a diary? he peers at her for a moment, his eyes hardening a little.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{ok, anna, this is how it will be. you will bring the diary here and i will translate it for you. then if we get the names of any relatives i will call them myself. i am something of a... community leader for the russians here in this unfriendly city. what do you say? semyon hoists a passing child into his arms.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i was going to ask my uncle....}
<C>__{semyon}

<C>__{semyon }

<D>__{dosvedania.}
<P>__{(goodbye)}
<C>__{anna}

<D>__{yes, always. a pause before anna leaves semyon to his clouds of steam.}

<L>__{interior ozim's barber shop. kitchen night}
<D>__{we cut close to an ancient looking hair dryer from the shop downstairs being trained onto a human hand with a large eagle tattoo. we pull wide to reveal the full, gruesome scene. nikolai has the body of soyka laid out on a surface, his head still bound up in a bin bag, his lower portions bound up similarly. nikolai is de frosting soyka's left hand with the hair dryer, concentrating on his ring finger which has a gold ring on it. the parts of soyka's shirt and jacket which are visible are crusted with frozen blood. nikolai is wearing rubber gloves. as he dries, nikolai takes a sip of coffee. ozim is watching this scene with horror. kirill has his arms folded, mightily impressed. finally the hand is thawed enough for nikolai to remove the gold ring. he studies an inscription and then offers it to ozim. ozim shakes his head as if the thing were a contagion. nikolai shrugs and pockets it. he then turns the hair dryer back on and blows some hot air onto the crisply bloody chest of soyka. he tugs at the frozen lapel of the jacket and blows air into the inside pocket. within a few moments he is able to remove soyka's glistening, thawing wallet which is caked in frozen blood. he opens it (we glimpse a photo of a wife and children) and blows hot air onto the money inside. he tugs a wad of frozen bank notes from the wallet, all stuck together by drops of frozen blood. he offers this money to ozim as well but ozim shakes his head vigorously. kirill hoots with laughter. ozim is now staring at nikolai as if he were a devil from hell. nikolai grabs a plastic bag and puts the money inside it, then pockets the frozen wad. he tosses the rest of the frozen wallet to ozim, who instinctively catches it.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{you'd better burn that. ozim, reacting to the cold of the wallet and to the horror of it, drops the thing on the floor. nikolai looks at ozim as if he were a complete amateur.}

<D>__{did you finish cutting his hair? ozim can't answer.}
<C>__{nikolai }
