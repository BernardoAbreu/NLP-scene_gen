<L>__{exterior small eatery, moroccan desert later}
<D>__{the group of tourists spread about a small eatery with open air tables on a dusty terrace. a bus is parked behind them. at a table, on one end of the terrace with views to a cluster of mountains, richard and susan look through some menus. richard seems at ease in this place. susan appears to be bothered by the dust and otherness. a waiter brings a plate and some cutlery.}
<C>__{waiter}
<P>__{(in broken english)}
<D>__{you want to order?}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{i will have a chicken cous cous and a coke, please.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{what do you have that doesn't have fat in it?}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{everything is delicious.}
<A>__{susan reads the menu again.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i will have the fried eggplant and a diet coke.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{we don't have diet coke.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{then a regular coke.}
<A>__{the waiter smiles and goes to place the order. susan takes out a small bottle with antibacterial gel, cleans her hands and then starts wiping the plate and the cutlery thoroughly. richard looks at the mountain range through a pair of binoculars. he spots a hawk flying over the plains.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{look, look: a hawk.}
<A>__{richard follows the hawk with his binoculars for a few seconds and then puts them down.}
<C>__{richard }
<D>__{this country is incredible.}
<A>__{susan remains silent and then turns to look at him.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{richard, why did we come here?}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{what d'you mean why? i thought you would like it.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{really: why are we here?}
<A>__{richard knows that susan's answer implies something else.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{to forget everything, to be alone.}
<A>__{susan, sardonically gestures toward the other tourists with her chin.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{alone?}
<A>__{richard sighs in disappointment. the waiter arrives with the cokes and the food, which does not look particularly appetizing. he leaves everything on the table and goes. richard is about to pour his drink when susan stops him.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{throw out the ice.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{the coke is warm.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{yeah, but you don't know what kind of water is in there. she grabs richard's glass and tosses out the ice. then she does the same thing with hers. they are quiet for a moment.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{why can't you ever relax. you're always stressed.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you're the one stressing me out. you're why i can't relax.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{you could if you tried.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{tried? don't you think i tried?}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{you're never going to forgive me, are you?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{do you even know what i'm talking about?}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{susan, please; we didn't come all this way just to argue. susan gets angry and faces him.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{oh, we didn't? then when are we supposed to "argue"? or are you planning on running away again? richard sighs, defeated. they stop speaking and sit looking at the mountains.}
