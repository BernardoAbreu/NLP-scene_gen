<L>__{int studio day}
<A>__{he closes the door behind him and shuffles to the kitchenette, passing by the blanket covered, slumbering forms of holden and alyssa, who are out cold in each other's arms. the place looks a mess like a couple of people were engaged in some tremendous fucking. banky is oblivious. he sets the bag down on the counter and pulls out a chocolate milk. he opens it, sticks a straw into the top, and begins sipping and sifting through the mail. he comes to mail that's holden's and tosses it onto the couch, near holden's head. he looks down at the sleeping couple, then back at the mail for a couple of beats. then he freezes. he looks down again, and drops his jaw and his carton of choco. it hits the floor with a pop. holden and alyssa shoot straight up, eyes struggling to focus. they look at one another, then at the flabbergasted banky. banky blinks. then he shuffles toward the door again and lets himself out.}
