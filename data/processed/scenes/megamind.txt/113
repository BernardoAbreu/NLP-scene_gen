<D>__{hal, i know everyone treated you like shit, but you don't have to do this.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{you're right. i don't have to do anything. isn't that cool?}
<A>__{titan lines up his shot.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{here's one for the record books!}
<A>__{titan flies a few feet and rolls the ball down the main street.}
<B>__{roxanne}
<A>__{her face is utter horror as she watches the inevitable destruction of metro city. as the ball rolls it demolishes everything in it's wake; cars, street lamps windows shatter as the giant concrete sphere brushes along side buildings.}
<B>__{titan}
<A>__{he smiles in anticipation and uses "body english" to direct the ball.}
<B>__{giant bowling ball pov}
<A>__{it's nearly halfway to its target.}
<B>__{roxanne}
<A>__{she closes her eyes. titan's smile fades. he looks around as if he hears something we don't. about two hundred feet in front of the first building a giant spider web flies across the path of the ball, creating a defensive barrier. an enormous letter "m" is etched in the web's center.}
<C>__{titan }
<D>__{what the...?}
<A>__{the ball breaks through the web, but it's speed is greatly reduced.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{look, what's that flying in the air?}
<A>__{we suddenly see master mind flying over the rolling ball in a}
<B>__{jet pack.}
<A>__{he quickly pulls out his goo gun and starts laying down a path of sticky plasm to stop the destructive sphere's path.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{c'mon, slow down}
<A>__{master mind looks down to see the meter of the gun close to empty.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{c'mon.}
<A>__{the ball slows drastically then starts rolling to the side. it heads off an embankment and rolls harmlessly into a canal.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{gutterball!}

<C>__{titan}
<D>__{you are becoming a real pain in my ass. i should have done this a long time ago.}
<A>__{titan lunges at his tormentor. master mind hits the booster on his jet pack and heads back toward the other side of the city with titan in hot pursuit.}
<C>__{master mind }
<P>__{(into walkie talkie)}
<D>__{plato, da vinci. secure roxanne, he's falling for it.}
<B>__{elsewhere}
<A>__{a flustered titan lands. he begins searching the city streets, but master mind is nowhere in sight. he turns upon hearing an eeking sound to his left. sitting on the ground is a chimpanzee wearing a strange collar. it smiles at him.}

<A>__{from behind, titan is immediately set upon by five more radio}
<B>__{controlled apes.}
<C>__{titan }
<D>__{godamnit!}
<A>__{the critters bite hop and hit titan. as soon as he throws one off two more jump him. titan breaks free and with his mighty breath blows them across the street into a fruit stand. with titan out of their sight they begin to attack the fruit.}
<B>__{master mind}
<A>__{he's a block away frantically hitting his remote.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{shit! stupid monkeys and their fruit.}
<A>__{titan flies away from the mad monkeys and lands to find master mind sitting on the ground wrapped in a long cape with only his head sticking out.}
<C>__{titan }
<D>__{no more games.}
<A>__{titan fires his laser vision at master mind's chest. master mind pulls the cloak away to reveal a fire hydrant. titan's eye lasers burn through the hydrant releasing a high pressure stream of water. master mind uses the last remote which dumps two tons of cement mix into the truck. the crowd, police and news crews move in closer when titan doesn't emerge. master mind drops his last remote and walks toward the truck cautiously.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{could it really be that easy }
<A>__{ boom the back of the truck explodes, throwing dust and concrete everywhere. when the dust clears we see and enraged titan.}
<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{didn't think so.}
<A>__{as the villain walks toward him, he pulls back his fist to give master mind the killing blow.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{if you don't mind, i'm going to punch trough your face now.}
<A>__{preparing himself for the end, master mind shuts his eyes as a sudden gust of wind begins to pick up. as titan goes to strike, a blurry figure runs in and snatches}
<B>__{master mind out of the away.}
<A>__{stunned, master mind begins to feel around his body as if to make sure everything's still in place.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{i'm alive.}
<A>__{he turns to see uberman standing next to him.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{uberman?}

<D>__{we're saved!}
<A>__{as the crowd cheers, a confused master mind turns to metro city's newly resurrected champion.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{i thought.}
<C>__{uberman}
<D>__{so did i.}
<A>__{he puts a hand on master mind's shoulder.}
<C>__{uberman}
<D>__{thank you, old enemy.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{uberman}
<D>__{showing me the error of my ways, showing me i'm meant to be this city's savior, showing me that, while we can try, there is no running away from our true destiny.}
<A>__{with that, uberman is stricken by a laser blast, instantly}
<B>__{turning him into a charred human skeleton.}

<C>__{titan}
<D>__{oh...did i interrupt something?}
<A>__{master mind turns to run, but, suddenly titan is before him.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{where you going, buddy?}
<A>__{titan grabs master mind by the collar and throws him across the street into a parked car.}
<C>__{titan }
<D>__{welcome to paintown. population: you.}
<A>__{master mind manages to stand on shaky legs. he seems in a daze, unable to move. titan flies up in the air.}
<C>__{titan }
<D>__{time to finish this.}
<A>__{with his fist front and center, titan speeds toward master mind. he's like a human torpedo, coming in for the killing blow. master mind comes to his senses and puts up his hands.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{wait!!!}
<A>__{titan screeches to a halt and stops just in front of him like an old warner bros cartoon.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{quick joke what's the capital of thailand?}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{huh i don't know.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{it's bang cock!}
<A>__{in a sudden surge of strength, master mind punches titan in}
<B>__{the groin.}
<A>__{the once mighty man instantly drops to his knees, searching, with tears in his eyes, for the proper word to express the pain suddenly surging through his member.}
<C>__{titan }
<D>__{ow.}
<A>__{baffled, he looks up at master mind's hand and sees his gauntlet is now made entirely out of copper.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{so, i guess pennies are good for something.}
<A>__{he punches titan in the face, knocking him out cold. master mind looks down on titan with more than a little pride. suddenly he hears something behind him. he spins to see the crowd making a strange noise applause. roxanne comes up to him. the crowd starts to go wild and cheers for master mind. he's not sure what to make of it.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{pretty strange, huh?}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{they're cheering for me.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{you saved them. you saved everybody. how's it feel?}
<A>__{master mind looks at the smiles all around him. he begins to well up a little.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{it's a...it's nice, you know? i usually don't get a lot of feedback.}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{but i also kind of caused all this. what happens when they find that out i was the cause of some of this?}
<A>__{roxanne looks at the cheering crowd, then back at master mind.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{what they don't know won't hurt them.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{i guess that is all in the past.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{you're the hero.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{i don't think i'd go that far...i mean i just...er...}

<A>__{cut to ceremony on capital steps. the mayor is shaking master mind's metal gauntlet when it suddenly starts to crush his}

<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{ahhh!}
<A>__{secret service men quickly start to draw their weapons and take aim at master mind. realizing what's happening, he quickly lets the mayor's hand go and puts his arms in the air.}

<D>__{sorry metal hand. force of habit.}
<A>__{he elbows the mayor.}
<C>__{master mind }
