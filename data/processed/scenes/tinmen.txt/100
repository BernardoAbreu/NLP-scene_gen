<C>__{sam}
<D>__{mr. tilley is crazy... he had a nervous breakdown.}
<A>__{widen to include man and wife from before.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{he's been under a lot of pressure recently... he snapped... he had a nervous breakdown... it's the saddest thing i've ever seen. let's be honest about it, nobody gives away forty two hundred dollars' worth of aluminum siding free.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{i thought it was very generous, but sometimes the lord moves in mysterious ways.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{let me tell you something, when i go and see his boss and show him this contract, he's out of this business... he'll lose his home ... his wife and kids will be thrown out onto the street. he'll probably spend some time in an institution, so god knows what will happen to his wife and kids. anyway, it's not your problem.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{why do they have to be thrown out onto the street?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you don't expect his boss to pick up the forty two hundred job, do ya?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{hmm.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yeah, it's a bad state of affairs.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{let me ask you something, sir.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you don't think there's some way you could work with me to try and resolve this, do you?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{how so?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{let's look at it this way, what if i can sell you this job at a wholesale price... kind of lessens the burden. the big boss won't get so angry, and maybe won't throw the guy's wife and kids out... at least they'll have a roof over their heads.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{what kind of wholesale price are we talking about?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you got a cup of coffee?}
<C>__{wife}
<D>__{i will get you a coffee... won't be a minute.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{let's just sit down and kick this around.}
<A>__{the wife goes into the kitchen.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(calling to wife)}
<D>__{no hurry, ma'am.}
<A>__{the man turns to sit down, and as he does so, sam throws a $5 bill on the ground.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what you doing throwing your money around?}
<A>__{he bends to pick up the $5 note.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i found a five dollar bill, here by the side of the chair.}
