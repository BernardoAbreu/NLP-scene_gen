<C>__{van loon}
<D>__{have you been talking to somebody ?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{carl, it's just rationalization.}

<C>__{van loon}
<D>__{the word "brazen" does not even begin to go there.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you'd have to back off libya.}

<D>__{why? he's come this far }
<A>__{eddie suddenly pulls back the bait.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i don't think you'd want to hear about it from some shmuck who needs a ride home.}
<C>__{van loon}
<D>__{you're a gusty little prick, eddie.}
<C>__{eddie}
