<A>__{dorr ducks while descending the steep, narrow stair in order to avoid an overhead beam. he is followed by mrs. munson.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{yes, yes, yes, this looks promising...}
<A>__{he pulls on a hanging string to light a bare bulb overhead.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{little dank, ain't it?}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{oh, indeed, but that only improves the acoustics...}
<A>__{he experimentally claps his hands.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...marvelous. these earthen walls are ideal for baffling the higher registers of the, uh, lute and, uh, sackbutt. that's why so much music of the cinquecento was played in crypts and catacombs. yes, this will do nicely...}
<A>__{he dry washes his hands with enthusiasm, but his tone remains mournful.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...this is perfect. this is more than perfect. i can scarcely contain my glee.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{you containing it okay.}
<A>__{he starts to peel cash out of a large, well worn billfold:}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{allow me to pay you a week in advance. allow me to pay you two weeks in advance. allow me to pay you a month in advance. i cannot countenance the thought of these charming apartments being tenanted by someone unappreciative of their special je ne sais quoi.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{that would be a shame.}
