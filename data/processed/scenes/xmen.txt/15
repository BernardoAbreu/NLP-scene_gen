<T>__{titles:}
<A>__{washington d.c. the not too distant future a woman's voice holds over the proceedings. it is the voice of jean grey whom we will soon meet. as she is speaking, we come to a large screen television at one end of the room.}
<C>__{jean }
<D>__{in every organism on earth there exists a mutator gene the x factor, as it has come to be known. it is the basic building block of evolution the reason we have evolved from homo habilus...}
<B>__{footage reflects the various stages of human evolution.}
<A>__{accompanying it is a graph with a diagonal line indicating the ascent of the "human being" as we know it. accompanying the graph are evolving images of the "evolution of man."}
<D>__{jean (o.s.) (cont'd) ... to homo erectus, to homo sapiens neanderthals, and, finally, to homo sapiens.}
<A>__{the animated demo on the screen zooms in on the lowest order of human depicted homo habilus a primitive, ape like humanoid covered in hair. as he is singled out, the terrain of his time appears, along with the harsh signs of his winter.}
<D>__{jean (o.s.) (cont'd) taking it's cues from the climate, terrain, various sources of nourishment, the mutator gene tells the body when it needs to change to adapt to a new environment. the process is subtle, normally taking thousands of years.}
<A>__{as the graphic changes and depicts warmer climate, the hair starts to disappear on the man's body gradually evolving into the human we now know as ourselves. now the terrain is modern, the weather pleasant. the image pulls back and places this man back in line at the front of evolution.}
<D>__{jean (o.s.) (cont'd) only in the last few thousand years did mankind begin to make clothes for himself, build shelters, use heat and grow food in large quantities. with this man made environment remaining relatively stable, the x factor became dormant.}
<A>__{quick shots: early huts, early clothing; then early homes, later homes, air conditioning, cars, modern high rises, etc.}
<B>__{pull back wider}
<D>__{jean (o.s.) (cont'd) until now.}
<A>__{on the room, the reactions, and on jean herself. a strong, attractive woman in her early 30's. a simple placard before her:}
<B>__{jean grey. genetically enhanced rights association.}
<A>__{the screen shows the words "present day," where the "evolution line" has resumed its rise.}
<C>__{jean }
<D>__{for reasons still not known to us, we are seeing what some are calling the beginnings of another stage of evolution }
<A>__{a microphoned voice interrupts. bearing down is the flamboyant senator scott "frank" kelly, a conservative from florida, and the hearing's chairman. just behind him sits his aide henry guyrich mid 30's, typical government cog.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you're avoiding the question i posed to you at the beginning of the hearing, ms. grey. three words: are mutants dangerous?}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{i am avoiding a question that is decidedly loaded, senator. the wrong person behind the wheel of a car can be dangerous.}
<A>__{another senator (lucinda rowee) speaks into her microphone:}
<C>__{senator rowee}
<D>__{well, we do license people to drive.}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{but not to live.}
<A>__{kelly raises a hand, continuing his tirade.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{ms. grey you work at a school for mutants in westchester, new york. can you tell the members of this committee what exactly you are teaching these mutants?}
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{math. history. science. english. athletics }
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you wouldn't happen to be teaching them how to use their powers to }
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{control, senator... we teach them control.}
<A>__{kelly raises a blown up photograph: a grainy, super zoomed, somewhat obscured image of a car on a freeway which appears to have "melted." now he's really playing to the crowd.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{this was taken by a state police officer in secaucus, new jersey. a man in a minor altercation literally melted the car in front of him. i don't know where you come from, ms. grey, but where i come from, you don't go melting people's cars when they cut you off. you do it the old fashioned way you give 'em the finger.}
<P>__{(laughs from the crowd)}
<D>__{but what you presume to tell this committee }
<C>__{jean}
<D>__{i presume nothing, i am here to tell you that in time, the mutator gene will activate in every living human being on this planet. perhaps even your children, senator.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i can assure you, there is no such creature in my genes.}
<A>__{the room laughs. kelly mistaken thinks it is for him, until the double meaning occurs to him. he is momentarily embarrassed, but he quickly recovers.}
<C>__{kelly }
<D>__{ms. grey, we are not here to weed out mutants. the registration act is designed merely to assess their potential threat if any to national security.}
<A>__{the crowd reacts loudly in support of the senator. some cheer, some roar, some yell obscenities at jean. jean stands and walks out, pushing her way through reporters now moving in for her response. all the while, kelly is delivering his last words.}
<C>__{kelly }
<D>__{mutants are very real. they are among us. we must know who they are. and above all, we must know what they can do.}
