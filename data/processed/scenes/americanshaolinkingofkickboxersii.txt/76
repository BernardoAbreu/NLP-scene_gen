<L>__{exterior shaolin temple day}
<B>__{establishing shot of training area.}
<A>__{the entire group is gathered in a sort of pit, on a hard concrete floor. d.s. stands in the middle.}
<C>__{d.s.}
<D>__{i want to go over some takedowns before we end for the day. i will need a partner...}
<A>__{he scans the group, and then points to drew. drew smiles ruefully, walks to the front and bows to d.s.}
<C>__{d.s.}
<D>__{watch carefully as i take him down, using techniques from shwai jyau, chinese wrestling.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(looking at ground)}
<D>__{excuse me, master, but there aren't any mats here.}
<C>__{d.s.}
<D>__{do they always use mats in america?}
<A>__{the group laughs a little at that, and drew's manhood is now challenged.}
<C>__{d.s. }
<D>__{if you are scared, i will get someone else. perhaps gao would assist me...}
<B>__{angle on gao}
<A>__{who is already getting up, ready and willing. this changes drew's mind right away.}
<B>__{angle on drew and d.s.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{let's do it.}
<C>__{d.s.}
<D>__{attack me straight on...}
<A>__{drew attacks, and is taken down brutally, smashed into the hard concrete floor. no attempt is made to cushion or soften the blow. drew gets up right away, and attacks again. again he is driven to the ground. this continues from all angles and all methods of attack.}
<B>__{angle on the group}
<A>__{who can barely watch the destruction.}
<B>__{angle on the fight}
<A>__{the d.s. does not let up at all, taking drew down hard each time. every time, regardless of the impact, drew gets right back up. his eyes are dazed, there is a little blood coming out of his nose, but he keeps coming back for more. finally, after a high arcing back throw, a real thumper, the worst of all of them, the d.s. calls it a day.}
<C>__{d.s.}
<D>__{any questions? good, that's all for today.}
<A>__{before anyone can move, however, drew raises his hand as high as he can, obviously in pain.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{i'm not sure i got that last throw clear in my mind.}
<A>__{the group gasps, knowing how much drew must be hurting, admiring him for his guts. even gao is impressed.}
<C>__{d.s.}
<D>__{i said that's enough.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{if you're getting too old for this kind of training, i understand.}
<C>__{d.s.}
<D>__{attack!}
<A>__{drew attacks, and the d.s. executes the manuever perfectly, crashing drew down almost on his head. luckily, drew is able to twist at the last moment and take the impact on his already bruised shoulder. he moans and groans and lies there.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{i think i've got it now. xie xie!}
<A>__{the group disburses, shaking their heads in wonder. li comes up to drew, who is still lying on the ground.}
<C>__{li}
<D>__{are you trying to kill yourself?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{he hurts more than me, he's just not bleeding, that's all.}
<A>__{he tries to get up, but moans in pain and falls back down. li helps him up and takes him to the showers.}
<B>__{angle on d.s.}
<A>__{watching them go. there is a slight smile on his face.}
