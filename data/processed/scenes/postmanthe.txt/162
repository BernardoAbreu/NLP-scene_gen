<A>__{some carriers drop their uniforms into a bonfire. the postman and abby ride up on the ridge above the rv camp. they pause to look back one last time. across the way, on the other side, ford is doing the same thing. as though he senses it, ford stops and looks back. ford raises his hand, salutes. slowly, the postman brings up his own hand. but he doesn't salute. he waves. good bye. as ford turns away, so does the postman. on chubby, ponytail and carrier named drew watching as the postman and abby disappear from sight.}
