<L>__{exterior dorothy's front porch night}
<A>__{door opens to reveal jerry maguire with brown bag, shoulder hang up bag, disheveled hair and sunglasses.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i'm jerry maguire.}
<C>__{laurel}
<P>__{(super pleasant)}
<D>__{you seem just the way i pictured you. i'm her disapproving sister laurel.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{honesty. thank you.}
<L>__{interior living room}
<A>__{jerry enters, as dorothy rounds the corner.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{hey you.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{the lights are low and his glasses are very dark.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{thanks for inviting me over. where's the little guy?}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{he's asleep. watch out for that lamp.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i'm glad you're home. that "alone" thing is... not my specialty...}
<A>__{he ducks the lamp, barely. laurel exits through his shot, miming "drinking" behind his back. jerry takes off his glasses, revealing a welt and a cut below his eye.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{yeah. that too. i broke up with avery.}
<A>__{dorothy's entire body chemistry changes in ways she doesn't quite understand.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{too bad.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{better now than later. we'll still be friends. i'm dying here.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{jesus, it's a real gash, isn't it?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{and just think if i got her the ring she really wanted.}
<A>__{dorothy laughs. he looks at her strangely. suddenly she feels very nervous, as he sets down his bags.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{sorry. uh, let me see, have a seat. i will get you some aloe vera for that cut too.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{do you have something to drink?}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{sure }
<A>__{she moves to the kitchen door. she is about to exit, when jerry begins to unburden.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{my brother works for the white house. he pretends he's an intellectual. he pretends he's from the east coast.}
<A>__{she turns, not quite sure what his point is. she waits politely for jerry to finish before exiting into the kitchen.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i was supposed to be the successful one.}
<P>__{(more)}
<C>__{jerry }
<D>__{but i don't want to talk about it. and yet! my family. i grew up with repression as a... a religion you don't bitch. no moaning! head down. do it, whatever "it" may be. my dad... he worked for the united way for 38 years! you know what he said when he retired? he said, "i wish i'd had a more comfortable chair." 38 years he sat in it! do you know what i'm saying, dorothy? repression as a religion. i'm almost as old as his chair.}
<A>__{he rubs his face. she looks at him, and the situation slightly overwhems her. here he is, wide open, ripe for the taking.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{beer okay?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{yeah, thanks.}
