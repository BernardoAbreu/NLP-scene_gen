<D>__{are you mad at me?}

<L>__{interior clasky house kitchen doorway day}
<A>__{as flor enters from outside.}
<C>__{bernice}
<D>__{morning, good to see you.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{morning. good too.}
<A>__{she notices the french toast.}
<C>__{bernice}
<D>__{try some.}
<A>__{she demurs. bernice holds out one slice on a spatula, indicating flor should just tear a piece off which she does...one taste and she marvels her mouth dropping open at this kid's ability to make something mundane special..bernice laughs.}
<C>__{bernice }
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{her mother enters on her way upstairs. she is thoughtful, tense and sweaty her run having failed to exorcise her current demon. she greets flor and then shakes her head, making a vain attempt to communicate her troubled mood to flor in some sort of sisterhood based on life being a fucker.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{tough day.}
<A>__{bernice prepares a plate for her mom while, in the b.g., a golden retriever named chum approaches flor from behind with a ball in its mouth. flor is checking out the kitchen... what's in each drawer, etc .....deborah is impressed by the self starter display and indicates same to bernice.}
<C>__{bernice}
<D>__{i had an idea for a breakthrough in french toast so i made breakfast. i don't want to be teased about it.. no sarcasm. no tough love. just try it and if by any chance you have a positive reaction...}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{right..mean ol' me. i can't play right now. i have to do something about your brother.}
<C>__{bernice}
<D>__{i had an idea for a recipe. when has that happened? i got up early to do this. at least taste it, for god's sakes!}
<A>__{she does..}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{oh, it's good...oh god, it's rich oh god, it's good.}
<C>__{deborah}
<P>__{(sudden alarm)}
<D>__{by the way, you could do without this.}
<A>__{the approval rug pulled out from under her, bernice looks at her mother. but deborah is unaware of having hurt her daughter because her attention has been diverted so that deborah and the camera lose focus on bernice as the teenager, distraught, moves from the room.}
<D>__{deborah (to flor) (cont'd) no..no! flor!....never do fetch.}
<A>__{chum is nudging flor with the ball and flor was about to accommodate him by taking it before deborah's warning shout stopped her in mid sentence.}
<C>__{deborah }
<D>__{i mean it, never!}
<A>__{on flor's stunned reaction to the outburst.}
<C>__{deborah }
<D>__{i'm not mad. i'm thinking of you. this is me being nice..}
<A>__{then using her hands to demonstrate.}
<C>__{deborah }
<D>__{just no taking ball from dog.}
<P>__{(broadly)}
<D>__{trust me on that one.}
<A>__{close up on chum going nuts with deborah's hand passing in front of his face ignoring how urgently he offers the ball.}
<C>__{deborah }
<D>__{you and me. we are fine. just a tip.}
<P>__{(she gives her waist a little squeeze)}
<D>__{girlfriends.}
<P>__{(flor is totally confused)}
<D>__{could you make some coffee? cafe?}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{deborah directs her to the most complicated cappuccino machine italian overpriced artists ever devised.}
