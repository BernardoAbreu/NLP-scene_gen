<L>__{exterior randy's house, backyard night}
<A>__{the party at randy's teems with locals, ages ranging from early teens to late 20s. on the back deck is a keg of beer and a boombox blasting music. there's a slimy looking pool, and a few people swim in the greenish water. randy and ruth make their rounds as a pair. they stop off so ruth can sell a bag of weed to some eager kids. corey and sam hang with mike and jeff, drinking beer.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{you guys gotta come visit the club when we get all set up. we'll give you the vip treatment, man...}
<A>__{mike and jeff are both excited about this proposition.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{sounds good to me.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{give us a little time, me and sam'll be runnin' that place, no doubt... right?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yeah. definitely.}
<A>__{corey is relaxed, enjoying their newfound friends, while sam appears more out of place. she drains the better part of her cup for some liquid courage. randy and ruth converge back on the group just as officer o'dell creeps into the backyard wearing plainclothes. ruth notices him first.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{fuck.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{that pig, o'dell.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{don't worry about ryan. he might be a cop, but he still likes to party.}
<A>__{randy's theory is proven when o'dell takes a flask from his pocket and has a snort before approaching a pair of teenage girls... but ruth is still not satisfied.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{i think that asshole knows i deal. you know how fucked that is?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{from what i hear he's got a little somethin' goin' on the side himself.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{fucking pig's a pig.}
<A>__{they're all distracted when somebody does a cannonball into the pool and splashes them.}
<C>__{mike jeff}
<A>__{fuck! bastard!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what the hell...}
<A>__{sam bends to wipe some of the water from her pants. ruth watches her, smirking.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{we might as well all go in now, we're already wet.}
<C>__{ruth}
<D>__{good idea...}
<A>__{without warning, ruth shoves sam backwards into the pool angle: beneath the water she sinks into the murky water in slow motion. all sounds are drowned out and everything is tranquil, completely detached. through her blurred vision, sam can see randy's porch lights glimmering beyond the surface of the water... transition to:}
