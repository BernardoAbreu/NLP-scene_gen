<A>__{in the clearing, a uc jock stands behind his asian girlfriend, kissing her neck and removing her clothes.}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{i hope you have a good reason.}
<A>__{reveal nick and his friend lefty, 16, belly down in the grass overlooking the clearing. lefty watches the copulating couple with a pair of binoculars.}
<C>__{lefty}
<D>__{my sister said she saw millie filbert holding hands with some college guy.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i dunno, lefty. i think your sister is just waging psychological warfare.}
<C>__{lefty}
<D>__{well it's working. what am i gonna do, nick? i'm obsessed. i think about millie so much my balls ache.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{maybe your just not wacking off enough.}
<A>__{as if in response, lefty passes the binoculars off to nick and then turns over onto his back and unzips his pants. as lefty jerks it, nick looks with nonchalance...}
<B>__{through the binoculars}
<A>__{the couple hump in the grass, her legs in the air.}
<C>__{lefty }
<D>__{so, i've been taping my pecker to my right leg at night.}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{in case you haven't heard, lefty's erect member takes a dramatic turn midway up the shaft.}
<C>__{lefty }
<D>__{then i look at this issue of better homes and gardens that has a girl that looks just like millie until it gets good and hard. i think it's starting to straighten out.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{why don't you just have your parents take you to the dick doctor?}
<C>__{lefty }
<D>__{are you kidding? it would kill them to know that i even get hard ons.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{still, you might want to get it fixed before asking millie out.}
<C>__{lefty }
<D>__{true. what if i shove it up the wrong hole?}
<A>__{nick gives a dubious glance in lefty's direction.}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{lefty's grasp of the female anatomy is somewhat tenuous; he imagines there are orifices galore down there.}
