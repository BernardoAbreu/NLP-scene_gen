<L>__{exterior pearl harbor day}
<A>__{the nevada swings off its course and runs aground.}
<L>__{interior the nevada's dynamo room day}
<A>__{the impact jolts the boilers, already bursting with the steam pressure; gouts of steam from rupturing pipes scalds and blinds the engine room crew.}
<L>__{exterior the nevada day}
<A>__{the nevada, run aground at the shoreline, is now like a beast cut from the herd; the predators swarm after it with torpedoes and bombs. one torpedo, missing the nevada, skims right up the beach itself and blasts a house on the shore to fragments. bombs detonate along the nevada, engulfing the entire upper deck in flames, ravaging the sailors.}
<L>__{exterior hospital day}
<A>__{the nevada is grounded near the hospital; from the doorway evelyn can see the whole ship on fire, burning sailors leaping off the decks. her hearing, her presence of mind, returns; she lets betty go, and grabs an orderly.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{go to the base hardware store and get some of those canister spray things they use for killing bugs.}
<C>__{orderly}
<D>__{insecticide?...}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{no, just the sprayers. we'll fill them with tannic acid, it'll sterilize them and cool the burns! go!}
<A>__{the orderly races away. they can still hear the bombs falling outside. a sailor staggers toward the hospital from the nevada. he is completely gray. everyone stares at him, and then realizes he is nude, burned gray, his skin ash. evelyn rushes to help him, shouting back over her shoulder to the other nurses }
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{we're gonna need every bed. if they can breathe, make 'em get up and move someplace else!}
