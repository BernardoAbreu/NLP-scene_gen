<L>__{exterior highway dawn}
<A>__{barren desert. the middle of nowhere. a lone male hitchhiker, poor, stands at a crossroads. a car coming the wrong direction raises dust along the highway. it slows, stops, and lets frances out. she is now dressed in jeans and a workshirt. she has a heavy tan. she glances across at the hitchhiker and nods casually. he responds in kind. a relaxed silence follows. two strangers passing. his voice, when he speaks, is gentle, calm:}
<C>__{hitchhiker}
<D>__{pretty morning.}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{it's always beautiful at this time. peaceful...}
<C>__{hitchhiker}
<D>__{and no people.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{hitchhiker}
<D>__{where you goin'?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{wherever they're going, i'm going.}
<C>__{hitchhiker}
<D>__{yeah, i know what that's like... where you been?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{well, i was picking fruit with some migrant workers until...}
<A>__{she stops. she sees now that the car heading toward her is a cop car. she averts her face... then tries to hide her gesture.}
<C>__{hitchhiker}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<A>__{frances sighs as the cop car speeds away.}
<C>__{hitchhiker}
<D>__{they're looking for you, huh?}
<A>__{she's uncertain whether to trust him. takes the plunge:}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{hitchhiker}
<D>__{what'd you do?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{you know, i've never been able to figure that out.}
<A>__{he laughs. she shivers slightly, pulls her clothes around her. he takes out a small flask and offers, no strings:}
<C>__{hitchhiker}
<D>__{i've got a little whiskey here, warm you up.}
<A>__{she smiles, truly grateful:}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{then she sees a ball of dust nearing... a car on his side.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{wait. maybe they'll pick you up.}
<A>__{the car stops. its lights flashing. cops jump out.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{shit!}
<C>__{hitchhiker}
<D>__{run!}
<A>__{she does. she's pursued. the hitchhiker makes an effort to impede the cops' progress, but is tossed aside. the cops are slowly, inevitably, gaining on her.}
