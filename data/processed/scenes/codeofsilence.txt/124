<A>__{distracted for an instant by a cluster of conventioneers, lou fails to notice the two comachos who have fallen in step behind them. he goes down with a gasp, almost silently, a knife sticking from his back. a comacho grabs diana's arm. she jabs him in the eyes, and runs. diana disappears into the crowd. hysterical citizens scatter in all directions. a woman stands in horror unable to keep from looking at gamiani's body lying on the sidewalk. she screams. eddie and kosalas come crashing out of the entrance of the museum. the girl isn't here. eddie spots a commotion at the end of the block, under the el station. he dashes down the steps and across the street with traffic screeching to a halt. kosalas flags down a blue and white, and barks for backup, then tears out after eddie.}
