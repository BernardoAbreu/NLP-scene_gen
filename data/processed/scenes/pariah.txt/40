<L>__{interior sports club basketball court day}
<A>__{alike and arthur cavort in a sloppy half court game in the fluorescent glare of the gym. well heeled clientele cross to and fro munching power bars and sipping gatorade. arthur has an awful shot, but alike's is worse. alike heaves a huge airball past the basket.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{oh my god!!}
<A>__{alike cracks up as arthur chases down the ball.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{that's just embarrassing!}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{you ain't got no range, either.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{yeah but at least i hit the backboard. damn.}
<A>__{alike rushes to guard arthur who dribbles clumsily around the key. he tries a crossover move and lobs an ugly shot toward the basket.}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{brick!!}
<A>__{laughing, they tussle over the rebound. arthur recovers.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what's the score?}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{one up.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{one?}
<C>__{alike}
<D>__{yup!}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{one? nah, i definitely have like three. at least three.}
<A>__{giggling, the pair rollick in another squeaky shoed play.}
