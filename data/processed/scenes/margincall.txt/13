<A>__{seth walks out and peter puts on his headphones, the music kicks in again. he picks up the portable hard drive, looks around and sees no one, then inserts it into his computer. he has four large screens in front of him and as he begins opening window upon window of mathematical models his face begins to soften and he gets into his comfort zone. the frame is filled with the extremely complex programs and numbers flying by.}
