<L>__{interior stage 5, cinecitta day}
<A>__{the fantasy ends abruptly with a violent grating noise, as the studio's truck doors are yanked open, jolting guido who is slumped in the crane seat. harsh daylight penetrates the gloom. too bright. he blinks, discombobulated, as a group of silhouetted figures approach with purpose. one of the figures is a well fed, amiable character, dante. he is guido's longtime associate and producer. a younger, more ascetic figure accompanies him, sharp and birdlike. this is fausto, an accountant. dante speaks quickly and without obvious punctuation:}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(walking)}
<D>__{guido! you're here.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{buongiorno, dante.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i've been looking for you all over the place. the set's coming along. how are you?}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{bene, grazie, bene.}
<A>__{guido stands to greet him. they kiss on both cheeks.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{bene. my god, you look terrible, better go to makeup, forget you've got a press conference?}
<C>__{fausto}
<P>__{(discreetly, to dante)}
<D>__{he has no tie.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{yes, makeup and wardrobe.}
<A>__{he takes guido's arm and they head towards daylight. guido looks back at fausto, who follows and with a look and a gesture asks dante who is he?}
<C>__{fausto}
<P>__{(overlapping dante)}
<D>__{signor contini, i'm fausto. good morning, signor contini.}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(interrupts)}
<D>__{he's counting costs, you know. the bank wants him here.}
<P>__{(to fausto)}
<D>__{don't speak to him, i speak to him.}
<C>__{fausto}
<D>__{okay, i have some questions for signor contini.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{we all have questions for signor contini.}
<A>__{they head outside.}
