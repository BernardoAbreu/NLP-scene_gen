<B>__{the two canvas trucks}
<A>__{they crookedly float along the shark infested moat waters. the battered, bruised trucks now resemble two sinking pirate ships. kezure and the pirates battle the nazis along the truck frames. the pirates fight in their element... water! with fast swinging swords, the pirates are defeating the nazis. several nazis fall into the water and are immediately attacked by countless sharks. at one point, kezure falls into the water. several sharks come for him. the pirate king disappears beneath the water surface. a few of his men pause. worried. afraid. suddenly, kezure leaps out of the water. he holds a live shark in his hands. the crazed kezure takes a bite from the shark. he tosses the fish back into the water. kezure chews ana swallows the raw shark meat. blood spills down his chin. kezure resumes his fighting with the nazis, as the two truck frames continue to sink.}
