<L>__{interior house late afternoon}
<A>__{walter vale, sixty two, is standing by the window of his modestly furnished colonial house. he is holding a glass of wine and peering out through the drapes. after a few moments an old car pulls up. a slightly overweight woman gets out of the car. she starts to walk up to the house. walter steps back from the window and waits. the doorbell rings. walter takes a last sip of wine and sets the glass down on the end table. and then he goes to the door and opens it.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{mr. vale?}
<C>__{walter}

<D>__{yes. come in.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{she steps into the house and walter shuts the door. they both stand there awkwardly. barbara is tightly wound and overcompensates with a forced pleasantness.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{can i take your coat?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{no, thank you.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{ok. would you like anything to drink?}

<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{let's try it again.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{the same thing?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{yes. remember, fingers curved. like a tunnel.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{walter starts to play the piano. it's a lesson in progress. they are sitting at a beautiful grand piano but walter is only a beginner. and not a very good beginner.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{don't flatten.}
<A>__{walter keeps playing.}
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{make room for the train.}
<A>__{walter stops.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{i said "make room for the train." it's something that i tell my kids. if you curve your fingers like this...}
<P>__{(she demonstrates)}
<D>__{then the train can pass through the tunnel.}
<A>__{she passes her pencil through her curved fingers. walter looks at her for a long moment.}
<L>__{interior walter's house day}
<A>__{walter walks barbara to the front door. he opens it and then hands barbara some money.}

<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{thank you. next tuesday at the same time?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{no. i don't think i'm going to continue with our lessons.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{oh, no. are you giving up?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{barbara gets the pointerior he is stopping with her, not the lessons.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{oh. ok. goodbye.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{goodbye.}
<A>__{barbara walks out the door and then turns before walter shuts it.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{mr. vale? if i may ask, how many teachers have you had before me?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{four.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{well, for what it's worth, it's difficult to learn an instrument at your age. especially if you don't possess a natural gift for it. i'm not saying this to be mean. but if you do decide to give up then i would really like to buy your piano. it's a beautiful instrument.}
<A>__{walter nods, not quite sure how to receive the comment.}
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{goodbye.}
<A>__{barbara turns and leaves. walter shuts the door.}

<A>__{, lecture hall day walter stands before a half empty class. he is wrapping up a lecture on economic theory. there is nothing inspiring about it.}
<C>__{walter}

<D>__{i'm sorry. i can't accept it now.}
<C>__{student}
<D>__{but...}

<C>__{student}
<D>__{you know you still haven't given us a syllabus.}

<D>__{that's ok.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{walter, shelley can't make it down to the nyu conference to present your paper. i'm going to need you to cover for her.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{why can't she go?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{she's been put on bed rest until she has the baby.}
<A>__{walter is caught off guard.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{when?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{next week. we'll cover your class and make the arrangements.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i wish i could, but now is not a very good time, charles.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{i understand but you co authored the paper and the dean wants it presented. he wants to keep shelley on track for tenure.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i just don't think i can with the start of classes and my book.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{you're only teaching one class, walter.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{so i can stay focused on my writing. i'd really rather not go right now.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{i'm sorry but there really isn't another option at this pointerior}
<A>__{walter is trapped. he comes clean.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{charles, the truth is this is really shelley's paper. i just agreed to co author it because she asked me to. i'm not really prepared to present it.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{that may be the case but you are the co author and she can't go. look walter, you can take it up with the dean if you want, but, as your friend, i wouldn't advise it. not with that argument.}
<A>__{walter just stares him.}
<C>__{charles }
<D>__{good bye.}

<C>__{walter}
<D>__{so if they didn't get the letter then does this help us?}
<C>__{mr. shah}

<D>__{so you can help him?}

<D>__{it's still a long shot. like i said, the government's approach has changed radically.}
<C>__{mr. shah }
<D>__{it's very black and white now. either you belong or you don't. which means a lot of people who have been living here for years are suddenly being swept up and thrown into detention.}
