<A>__{the tv plays offstage as chance washes up in the bathroom. he finishes, comes into the bedroom, takes a pair of house slippers from his closet, turns off the television and leaves the room.}

<L>__{interior dining room day}
<A>__{chance, wearing the slippers, enters and sits at his place. he turns on the tv, puts the napkin on his lap. he watches tv for a moment, then turns, looks for louise. she does not appear so he resumes watching tv. he changes channels, views a wildly exciting football game. at a peak in the excitement, he again switches channels. chance watches tv news coverage of the president of the united states greeting foreign dignitaries at the white house. close shots on television reveal that the president uses a two handed handshake when meeting his guests. unconsciously, chance grips one hand with the other, the scene on tv seeming to have 'sunk into' his mind.}
