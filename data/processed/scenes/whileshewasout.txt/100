<A>__{the light grows closer. she climbs up onto a ledge. a loud noise startles her. it's music. rap music. blasting. della pushes her way through to the edge of the trees. sees....}
<L>__{exterior clearing evening}
<A>__{the woodland ahead slopes down into a clearing, where a huge ghetto blaster sits on a pile of felled trees. young pines about to become christmas trees. it's blasting out a hip hop anthem for a dead homie. a construction light illuminates the clearing. a ghostly vinh, head hung low, moves to the music, bottle of beer in hand. propped up against a tree stump sits the body of huey, arms crossed over his torso, hood pulled up to cover his face. the scene is so surreal that della is drawn closer. she creeps along the edge of the trees. as she moves, she kicks back on some dirt. it tumbles downhill into the gulch. she freezes. but nobody notices. she slips invisibly between the trees and watches as tomas enters the clearing. tomas stops and watches vinh. vinh continues to get into the music in his solemn japanese punk style. the juxtaposition between the hard core rap music and the serious vibe that vinh is sending out shows us that this is really important music to him. it's a theatrical tableau della overhead, looking down on the clearing. vinh transfixed by the music. tomas stone silent, watching vinh. it plays out for a poignant moment. like they're all part of some spiritual rite about to be consummated. vinh pours some beer onto the ground at huey's feet. a small tear runs down his stoic face. then click. the blaster is abruptly turned off by chuckie who appears out of the shadows behind it. he stares a beat at vinh like he can't believe what he's been seeing. vinh keeps on moving like he's in a trance.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{what the fuck you doing?}
<A>__{vinh doesn't reply. stares down at the ground, keeps on with his weird dance. chuckie moves towards him. tomas grabs chuckie, tries to stop him from going for vinh, but chuckie shrugs him off. chuckie reaches out and shakes vinh. no response. he shakes him again.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{i asked you what your deal is, sand dancer?}
<A>__{the second shake sort of breaks vinh out of his trance. he shivers.}
<C>__{vinh}
<D>__{it's a tribute. a gesture.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{a what?}
<A>__{vinh stares down at the dirt at his feet.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{your brain even smaller than 'em slits for eyes?}
<A>__{vinh slouches defiantly over to the blaster and presses track}
