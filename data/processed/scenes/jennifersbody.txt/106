<L>__{interior "the hole" night}
<A>__{we're back in solitary confinement, where needy has been narrating the whole sordid tale. she hasn't moved a muscle since beginning her story. only a single shaft of moonlight illuminates the room. an orderly shoves dinner through a slot in the door. it's a pile of mystery meat. needy wrinkes her nose.}
<C>__{needy v.o.}
<D>__{i don't even know who needy lesnicki is anymore. i'm a different person now. a person who uses curse words and kicks orderlies and and sees things that aren't there. a very bad, very damaged person.}
<A>__{needy reaches up and distractedly pulls back the neckline of her shirt...}
<C>__{needy v.o. }
<D>__{but sometimes, change can be good. for instance, most occult scholars don't know this, but if you're bitten by a demon and you live you just might absorb some of the demon's abilities.}
<A>__{in the moonlight, we see needy still has a infected looking bitemark near her shoulder. she scratches it, wincing.}
<C>__{needy v.o. }
<D>__{you just might get lucky for once in your miserable life.}
<A>__{pull back to reveal that needy, still cross legged is hovering five feet off the floor. effortlessly. with visible concentration, she slowly flies up toward a narrow window positioned up near the ceiling. to anyone with normal abilities, it would be impossible to access. needy reaches the window, gazes at it for a moment, then smashes it with surprising strength.}
