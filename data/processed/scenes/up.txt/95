<L>__{exterior mountain, rocky landscape}
<A>__{bam!!! the house crashes into the ground. russell and carl fly off the porch and onto the ground. they land hard. carl's house is floating away! carl runs after the garden hose dragging across the ground.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{wait, wait! no don't, don't, don't!}
<A>__{carl grabs the hose and is pulled up in the air.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{whoah! hey, hey!}
<A>__{russell jumps onto carl's leg and the extra weight pulls them to the ground.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{russell, hang on!}
<A>__{carl and russell slide toward the edge of a cliff edge.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{whoah!}
<A>__{they slide toward the edge... and stop. the drop is thousands of feet. carl is terrified.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{walk back! walk back!}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{okay!}
<A>__{russell pulls carl by the leg away from the cliff edge. carl, still hanging from the hose, looks around. fog blankets the mysterious landscape, revealing only scattered rocks.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(out of breath)}
<D>__{where... where are we?}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{this doesn't look like the city or the jungle, mr. fredricksen.}
<A>__{the wind picks up and they struggle against it.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(to house)}
<D>__{don't worry, ellie. i got it.}
<A>__{the wind clears the fog, slowly revealing a crescent shaped, flat topped mountain on which they stand. across it, some ten miles away, is paradise falls. carl stares. he can't believe it.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{there it is. ellie, it's so beautiful.}
<A>__{the landscape is stunning. carl shows russell the engraving with the ellie drawing of the house atop the falls.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{we made it. we made it! russell, we could float right over there. climb up. climb up!}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{you mean assist you?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{yeah, yeah. whatever.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{okay, i will climb up!}
<A>__{russell climbs carl, stepping on his leg, arms, and face.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{watch it.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{the hose jiggles as russell climbs out of frame.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{now, when you get up there, go ahead and hoist me up! got it?!}
<A>__{russell continues to grunt and strain off screen.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{you on the porch yet?!}
<A>__{russell is just inches above carl, still struggling to climb. he slides down onto carl's head, exhausted.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{what? that's it?! i came all this way just to get stuck at the wrong end of this rock pile? aw, great!}
<A>__{carl paces.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{hey, if i could assist you over there, would you sign off on my badge?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{we could walk your house to the falls!}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{walk it?}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{yeah, after all, we weigh it down. we could walk it right over there. like a parade balloon.}
<A>__{carl considers this.}
