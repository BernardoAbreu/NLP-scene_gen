<L>__{exterior downtown office building later}
<A>__{a large office building in downtown manhattan.}
<L>__{interior elevator same}
<A>__{walter and mouna are standing in silence.}
<C>__{mouna}
<D>__{do you spend a lot of time in the city?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{no. not really. i just came down to present a paper at a conference.}
<C>__{mouna}
<D>__{you wrote it?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{yes. well i coauthored it.}
<C>__{mouna}
<D>__{congratulations.}
<A>__{walter shrugs.}
<L>__{interior mr. shah's office day}
<A>__{walter and mouna are talking to the mr. shah.}
<C>__{mr. shah}
<D>__{and what happened after the hearing?}
<C>__{mouna}
<D>__{we appealed. it took two years.}
<C>__{mr. shah}
<D>__{and your appeal was denied?}
<C>__{mouna}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{mr. shah}
<D>__{then they should have sent you a bag and baggage letter which basically tells you where to show up and be deported.}
<A>__{mouna nods.}
<C>__{mr. shah }
<D>__{but you didn't receive it?}
<C>__{mouna}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{mr. shah}
<D>__{you sure?}
<C>__{mouna}
<D>__{yes. i would remember this.}
<C>__{mr. shah}
<D>__{did you move?}
<C>__{mouna}
<D>__{yes. eventually we had to. but we had our mail advanced.}
<A>__{mr. shah is satisfied.}
<C>__{mr. shah}
<D>__{well, it wouldn't be the first time that happened. and pre 9 11 it wasn't much of a priority tracking people down.}
<A>__{mouna bristles at the implied connection.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{so if they didn't get the letter then does this help us?}
<C>__{mr. shah}
<D>__{it keeps our chances alive. if they got it and just ignored it then we couldn't push to reopen the case.}
<C>__{mouna}
<D>__{so you can help him?}
<C>__{mr. shah}
<D>__{it's still a long shot. like i said, the government's approach has changed radically.}
<C>__{mr. shah }
<D>__{it's very black and white now. either you belong or you don't. which means a lot of people who have been living here for years are suddenly being swept up and thrown into detention.}
<P>__{(he starts writing)}
<D>__{tarek's lucky. most of them don't even have lawyers.}
<A>__{mouna blanches.}
<C>__{mouna}
<D>__{lucky?}
<C>__{mr. shah}
<P>__{(without looking up)}
<D>__{relatively speaking. we just have to move quickly to get an emergency stay from the board of immigration. then, we'll stick with the motion to reopen pending his green card application.}
<A>__{mouna and walter share a look. they're lost.}
<C>__{mouna}
<D>__{can you explain what that means?}
<C>__{mr. shah}
<D>__{actually, i don't have the time right now. i have to be in court very shortly}
<C>__{mouna}
<D>__{how long will he be in detention?}
<C>__{mr. shah}
<P>__{(without looking up)}
<D>__{i can't predict that. i'm sorry but i am gonna have to wrap this up.}
<A>__{walter looks at mouna. mouna stares at the mr. shah.}
<C>__{mouna}
<D>__{do you have children, mr. shah?}
<C>__{mr. shah}
<D>__{yeah. two kids. and for what it's worth my uncle was deported after raising a family here for twenty three years. if i can get tarek out, i will.}
<A>__{mouna softens.}
<C>__{mouna}
<D>__{thank you. where are you from?}
<C>__{mr. shah}
<D>__{queens.}
