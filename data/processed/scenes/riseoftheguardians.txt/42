<A>__{a parent and her two children, huddled around a campfire, scream as a shadow, resembling pitch, washes over them. it makes its way up the side of a mountain to reveal pitch, smiling as he stares up at the moon.}

<P>__{(nostalgic)}
<D>__{everyone frightened. miserable. such happy times for me. oh, the power i wielded!}
<L>__{exterior village night flashback continuous}
<C>__{pitch }
<D>__{but then the man in the moon chose you to replace my fear with your wonder and light!}
<A>__{north's sleigh flies in front of the moon. tooth and her fairies flit by while sandy's dreamsand dances across the sky and bunny leaps across rooftops.}

<D>__{lifting their hearts! and giving them hope! guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 50.}
<A>__{pitch, thinner and weaker than he is now, slips back into the shadows after children run through him while playing in the streets, laughing as they go.}
<C>__{pitch }
<D>__{meanwhile, everyone wrote me off as just a bad dream! "oh, there's nothing to be afraid of! there's no such thing as the boogeyman!"}
<B>__{back to the tooth palace}
<A>__{pitch leans toward the guardians, showing nothing but contempt.}
<C>__{pitch }
<D>__{well that's all about to change.}
<A>__{a sound behind pitch: one of the columns of the palace begins to crack and crumble, as if decaying. tooth is stunned...}
<C>__{pitch}
<D>__{oh look, it's happening already.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what is?}
<A>__{tooth's eyes widen in shock.}
<B>__{vignettes of children around the world}
<C>__{pitch }
<D>__{children are waking up and realizing the tooth fairy never came.}
<A>__{lifting pillows and finding their baby teeth still there.}
<C>__{pitch }
<D>__{i mean such a little thing, but to a child...}
<A>__{pull out from the last vignette, all the way out of tooth's wide open eye, and back to scene. jack, mystified, moves closer to tooth as the palace continues to crumble.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{tooth}
<D>__{they, they don't believe in me anymore. guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 51.}
<C>__{pitch}
<D>__{didn't they tell you, jack? it's great being a guardian but there's a catch. if enough kids stop believing, everything your friends protect wonder, hopes and dreams it all goes away. and little by little, so do they.}
<A>__{jack's realizes now the magnitude of pitch's plan.}
<C>__{pitch}
<D>__{no christmas, or easter, or little fairies that come in the night. there will be nothing. but fear and darkness and me! it's your turn not to be believed in!}
<A>__{bunny throws his boomerangs at pitch, who quickly ducks out of the way as they fly around the chamber columns. pitch then jumps onto the back of onyx down into the depths of the palace. the guardians dive after him, followed by jack. bunny grabs a set of egg bombs and launches them at pitch, exploding seconds before pitch hits the ground.}
