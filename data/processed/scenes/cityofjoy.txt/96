<A>__{margareta, manooj, shambu, shoba, several other kids and, at the end of the line, poomina, all carrying water on their heads toward the city of joy. suddenly, someone whispers to poomina. one of ashoka's thugs. she glances after margareta and the other kids who are turning a corner and steps into:}
<B>__{alleyway}
<A>__{where ashoka waits.}
<C>__{ashoka}
<D>__{you taking that to the clinic?}
<P>__{(as she nods)}
<D>__{you like it there?}
<P>__{(as she nods)}
<D>__{and they love your smile, don't they?}
<A>__{she's fearful now and doesn't respond. he grabs her, the water pitcher crashes to the ground, he puts his knife into her mouth and lays her face open on both side with his knife.}
