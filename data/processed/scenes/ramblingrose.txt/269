<A>__{a pov shot of rose in the cell. her hair is mussed, her dress is torn. a little innocent, frightened smile is on her face. the camera pans to include daddy and the chief of police.}
<C>__{chief of police}
<D>__{that was a awful brawl down at the busy beaver, mr. hillyer. you know that fat horton, the bootlegger?}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{yes, i know the son of a bitch.}
<C>__{chief of police}
<D>__{son of a bitch is right, he dern near killed a man. and this girl was the cause of it all. what's more, she bit a police officer's thumb right to the bone.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{well, rose, what have you got to say for yourself?}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(coughs, then feebly)}
<D>__{i got an awful bad cold.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(nods slowly, then with aloof politeness)}
<D>__{that's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold?}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(coughs again)}
<D>__{well, i don't know what happened. they were arguin' about baseball, then all of 'em started fightin'. as for that policeman, i didn't bite him, i don't think i bit him.}
<A>__{in dour silence, daddy and the chief of police stare at rose. she gives them a little smile, as if to say, "see how innocent i am?" the chief turns to daddy and asks with dry irony:}
<C>__{chief of police}
<D>__{well, she's your girl, mr. hillyer. you want me to release her in your custody?}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{no, not really. but i guess we'll have to do that, john. let her out. let the crazy creature out and i will take her home.}
