<L>__{exterior building day}
<A>__{we dissolve : from the photograph to uberman standing in the exact same position. we pull back showing him atop a building overlooking the city below. a perfect view for our guardian hero. he watches the thriving metropolis, bristling with life as people happily go about their day. yet, we can't help but detect a hint of sadness in uberman's expression.}
<C>__{uberman}
<D>__{you look so peaceful from up here.}
<A>__{his serenity is suddenly interrupted by a loud beeping sound coming from his wrist. he looks down at a bracelet (a manly one) on his right arm. it's a silver band with a flashing red letter "u".}
<C>__{uberman }
<D>__{looks like roxanne's in trouble again.}
<A>__{uberman leaps off the building and into the air. his cape gracefully flows in the breeze behind him as he shoots off into the distance like a speeding bullet.}
