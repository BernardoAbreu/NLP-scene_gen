<L>__{interior low rent apartment day}
<A>__{four little kids scream and squabble while the phone chirps insistently in the tiny, cluttered apartment and a harried mother lunges for the phone, answers sharply...}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{yes?}
<P>__{(listens, frowns, then)}
<D>__{whaaaaat? "voice mail"! i don't know what you're talkin' about. ... is this a joke? i don't know any scientists. james who? never heard of you!}
<A>__{the mother slams down the phone.}
<L>__{interior railly's office county hospital day}
<A>__{a dismayed cole still has the receiver in his hand. sympathetically, railly takes it from him.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{it wasn't who you expected?}
<A>__{cole is clearly agitated, starts to pace, upset. nuts?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{it was some lady. she didn't know anything.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{perhaps it was a wrong number...}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{no. that's the reason they chose me i remember things.}
<A>__{railly frowns, studying the distracted man with intense interest. it's clear cole is becoming a special patient and railly's cool, detached demeanor is giving way ever so slightly.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{james, where did you grow up? was it around here? around baltimore?}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(lost in thought)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{i have the...strangest feeling i've met you before...a long time ago, perhaps. were you ever...?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{wait! this is only 1989! i'm supposed to be leaving messages in 1995. it's not the right number yet. that's the problem. damn! how can i contact them?}
<A>__{railly recovers her distance, her poise, as she takes a bottle, pours out some tablets, and holds them out to cole.}
<C>__{railly}
<D>__{james, take these.}
<P>__{(watching him step back)}
<D>__{please i helped you like i said i would. now i want you to trust me.}
