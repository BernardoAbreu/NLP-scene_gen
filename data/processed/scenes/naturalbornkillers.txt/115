<L>__{16mm.}
<A>__{note: everytime we're viewing through scott's camera, we are filming handheld in 16mm black and white. until otherwise specified, the shots stay in scott's camera. scott's filming the back of the newsvan. roger's sitting in the back eating donuts as is wayne. unruly julie's up front driving.}
<C>__{wayne}
<P>__{(with mouthful of donut)}
<D>__{how's it working, scotty?}
<C>__{scott }
<D>__{perfecto!}
<A>__{roger's picking through a box of donuts. scott pans over to him, then slowly zooms in on him.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{where the fuck's the chocolate cream filled? did anyone get my chocolate cream filled? if you did, it's mine.}
<A>__{cu of roger, looking into camera.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{i pointed at a chocolate cream filled. you saw me do it, didn't you?}
<A>__{wayne starts talking. we pan from roger to a cu of wayne.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{you were there. did you see him put it in a box?}
<A>__{we pan back to a cu of roger.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{at the time, i was too busy explaining to scott the finer points of film.}
<A>__{we zoom back to a wide shot.}
<C>__{scott }
<D>__{yeah, right. you know what he said? he said, indiana jones and the temple of doom is spielberg's best film.}
<A>__{wayne starts laughing. we hear scott laugh too.}
<C>__{wayne}
<P>__{(to roger)}
<D>__{you can't be serious?}
<C>__{roger}
<P>__{(preoccupied)}
<D>__{i'm as serious about that as i am about going back to the donut store, and dipping that stupid mexican's head into the batter for forgetting my chocolate cream filled. gimme that other box.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{huh uh. this dozen is for mickey.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{that dumbass probably put my chocolate cream filled in there by mistake.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{roger, no.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{what's the big deal? take out my chocolate cream filled, put one of these roasted coconut }
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{roger, do you understand what the word 'no' means? it's important we establish a rapport. something as simple as a dozen donuts can mean the world to somebody who hasn't had a donut in a year.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{so you're giving a man who butchers whole families, little babies included, my chocolate cream filled?}
<A>__{unruly julie honks the horn. wayne gets up and looks out the windshield.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{okay, guys, we're here. l.a. county jail. julie, just park in the front.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{wayne }
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{roger, i'm starting to get pissed. just drop this fuckin' donut shit, and gather your gear.}
<A>__{the van stops. wayne slides open the panel door, and steps out.}
