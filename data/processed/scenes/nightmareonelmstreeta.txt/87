<L>__{interior nancy's room. night.}
<A>__{nancy darts into her unlit bedroom, slams the door and locks it. safe at last. she listens at the door. nothing. she crosses to her bed. next second the killer dives through her window and seizes her in a shower of shattered glass ! nancy twists and manages to grab the wrist of his knife hand with both of hers, barely keeping the blades from her throat. the two fall backwards in a terrible, gasping struggle, crashing onto nancy's bed. her grip is broken the man stabs nancy twists away, backed into a corner of bed and walls. defenseless, she snatches a pillow up; the killer lashes out disemboweling the pilow and sending a great gush of feathers flying. nancy dives for escape in a virtual blizzard. the killer manages to snare her with his other hand, and the two crash across the bedside table to the floor, the table and all its contents cascading around them in a whiteout of feathers. angle at floor level close on nancy's and the killer's heads. the blades inch towards the girl's face the drool of the grizzled shadow with the horribly scarrred face spills into her eyes. feathers are everywhere; music is absolutely insane! but just when the points of steel are less than an inch from her eyes, the old fashioned alarm clock thrown to the floor next to nancy's head goes off with a jarring ringgggggg! instantly the music stops. and a moment later the room is light. wider as nancy reels up, blinded by the sudden light, screaming and fighting on her bed . angle on glen, lurching from his own sleep at the frightening noise. he discovers nancy pressed in terror against her headboard, clutching a pillow like a drowning woman would a straw. it's an intact pillow, and there isn't a feather in sight. nancy stares incredulously at glen, then around the room, untangling herself from her bedclothes. wary and furious, her voice hoarse.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{glen, you bastard...}
<A>__{the boy looks at his friend in groggy alarm. she's absolutely livid, more angry than he's ever seen her, and more strange.}
<C>__{glen}
<D>__{what i do?}
<A>__{he reaches for her she flattens against the wall, eyes hard, and terribly hurt, too.}
<C>__{nancy}
<P>__{(low)}
<D>__{i asked you to do just one thing. just stay awake and watch me just wake me if it looked like i was having a bad dream.}
<P>__{(eyes wild)}
<D>__{but you. you shit what do you do you fall asleep!}
<A>__{she stops herself, wiping a bit of spittle off her lip, alarmed at how out of control she's become. and suddenly she breaks, sinking into her torn bedclothes and rubbing her head.}
<C>__{nancy }
<P>__{(mostly to herself)}
<D>__{i must be going nuts...}
<C>__{marge }
<D>__{nancy?}

<D>__{oh, shit.}
<A>__{nancy composes her voice as best she can.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{yes, mother?}
<A>__{marge's flip flops approach outside the door. glen barrels out the window nancy dives for the bed, jams off the light and disappears under the covers. marge, bleary eyed herself, opens the door and flicks on the light.}
<C>__{marge}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{nancy}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{yeah. just had a little dream. i'm falling right back to sleep.}
<C>__{marge}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{okay... you need anything, just call.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{marge closes the door. nancy immediately sits up and looks at the window. a single bone white feather floats down in the moonlight. then it's sucked outside and is gone.}
