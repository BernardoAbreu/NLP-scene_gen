<L>__{interior the oval office day}
<A>__{...where sydney just stands uncomfortably, not knowing whether to sit or stand. waiting. trying the way a jumper on a window ledge tries not to look down trying not to notice things like the jfk desk, the seal of the president of the united states, the bust of lincoln... shepherd strides in }
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{sorry to keep you waiting.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{mr. president }
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{is it okay if i call you sydney?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{of course. mr. president }
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{have you ever been in the oval office?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i've just been on the regular tour. it didn't include...}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{i hear it's pretty good.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{mr. president, what you saw in there was nothing more than vanity run amok. i was showing off for a colleague who doesn't think very much of me. it'd be a real injustice for you to hold the gdc accountable for my behavior today. on top of which, i'm monumentally sorry for having insulted you like that.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{are you under the impression that i'm mad at you?}
<C>__{sydney}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{sydney, seldom does a day go by that i'm not burned in effigy.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{not by a professional political operative standing 30 feet from the oval office.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{no, i will give you that.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{mr. president }
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{did you know that when the city planners sat down to design washington, d.c., their intention was to build a city that would intimidate and humble foreign heads of state? it's true.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i didn't know that.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{the white house has the single greatest home court advantage in the modern world.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{learned that one the hard way.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{sydney, this bill is important to me.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{yes, sir, i will convey your message.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{but you don't believe me?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{the gdc is asking for 20 percent, sir.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{it's not gonna pass at 20 percent. it's a long shot at 10.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{how do you know that until you put the full weight of the white house behind }
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{sydney, at 20 percent, we are 34 votes shy in the house. it can't be done. but i tell you what. i will make you a deal with you. if you can get 24 votes, i will get you the last 10.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{twenty four votes?}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{if you can swing 24 votes by the state of the union, i will promise you full white house support.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{do i have your word on that, sir?}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{absolutely. listen, are you hungry? i skipped breakfast. you wanna have some coffee? a donut or something?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{sir, i'm a little intimidated by my surroundings, and yes, i've gotten off to a rocky and somewhat stilted beginning, but don't let that diminish the weight of my message: the gdc has been at every president for the last decade and a half that global warming is a calamity, the effects of which will be second only to nuclear war. the best scientists in the world have given you every reason to take the gdc seriously. but i'm gonna give you one more. if you don't live up to the deal you just made, come new hampshire, we're gonna go shopping for a new candidate.}
<A>__{sydney heads for the door }
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{you can't do that, sydney.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{with all due respect, mr. president, who's gonna stop me?}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{well, if you go through that door, the united states secret service. that's my private office.}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{you need to go out that way.}
<C>__{sydney}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{ah.}
<A>__{sydney, with as much dignity as she can muster, leaves the oval office. shepherd muses about what has just transpired.}
