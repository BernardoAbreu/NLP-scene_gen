<L>__{exterior ocean and pier night}
<A>__{selectman denherder and his buddy, charlie, a professional angler, row towards a tumble down jetty that leads fifty feet out into the black water.}
<C>__{denherder}
<D>__{you wanna call it a night after here?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's only two thirty. what, are you tired?}
<C>__{denherder}
<D>__{yeah, charlie, i got my second wind three nibbles back.}
<A>__{denherder hefts a bloodstained laundry bag from the wheelbarrow, revealing about a hundred feet of coiled dog chain and a large patched inner tube. charlie takes out a monster hook and together they push the wheelbarrow onto the rickety pier that is only about five feet across.}
<C>__{denherder}
<P>__{(reaching into the bag)}
<D>__{leg of lamb this time?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{screw lamb let's shoot the sirloin!}
<C>__{denherder}
<P>__{(a hyena laugh)}
<D>__{we're blowin' half the bounty on bait }
<A>__{the splintered pier sways to and fro as the men reach the end and start to work. charlie baits the hook with a massive chunk of sirloin while denherder secures the loose end of chain to a skinny piling. charlie then fastens the inner tube to the chain five feet from the end of the hook.}
<C>__{denherder}
<D>__{one more after this, then i'm going home.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{set?}
<A>__{denherder tugs the chain against the piling to prove that it is. charlie heaves the bait. splash! the inner tube follows and both men eagerly watch as it floats seaward, the chain playing out from the wheelbarrow.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{tide's taking it right out.}
<A>__{charlie lights his pipe and sits back against a piling. he turns on his transistor radio and loops one end around a fractured board. denherder paces, bored to death.}
<C>__{denherder}
<D>__{you do this all the time, right, charlie?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{twenty years.}
<C>__{denherder}
<D>__{i can't believe that people pay money to go fishing. this is really dumb. this isn't even relaxing... it's just boring.}
<A>__{close chain in wheelbarrow suddenly zipping out, faster and faster, as both men straighten. denherder is goggle eyed.}
<C>__{denherder}
<D>__{hey! what's this?}
<A>__{the chain is coming out so fast that it begins to drag the wheelbarrow to the end of the jetty. a section of chain tangles around the handle and flips the entire machine into the air. both men watch dumbfounded as the inner tube, racing out to sea in a wake of white water, suddenly dips under.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{look at him take it!}
<C>__{denherder}
<D>__{do i set the goddam hook?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{let him do it! go go go go go!}
<A>__{it is then that the chain whips taut against the narrow pilings. close piling a lineup of five decrepit 2 x 4 inch pilings snap with a resounding crack. angle jetty the end of the jetty is yanked loose. denherder is flipped like a chip over the side and into the cold night water, where he manages to snag hold of a splintered timber. denherder's point of view the severed section of jetty, a joined platform of footboards, is being dragged seaward with charlie sitting dazed on top of it, his lit pipe still going.}
<C>__{denherder}
<D>__{charlie! jump!}
<A>__{charlie rolls into the water, sputters, turns to watch the flotilla of wood draw away. close charlie looking seaward. charlie's point of view the end of the jetty makes a 180 degree turn and heads back in his direction.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{holy jesus christ!}
<A>__{denherder steps up on the broken off piling just to be out of the water.}
<C>__{denherder}
<D>__{get the hell out! charlie! swim!}
<A>__{charlie, inhaling terror, trying to slog to shore. the jetty is getting closer. suddenly, an enormous black fin breaks water like a periscope, making course corrections as it comes for charlie. denherder jumps from piling to piling, almost losing his balance on his way to help charlie. charlie has reached the last pylon toward open sea, and his hands clamber for a hold. but insert charlie's hands the algae is too slippery, and his fingers keep sliding back. that's when the fin behind him seems to reach up to the sky and charlie manages, with denherder's desperate help, to make it safely to shore. the remains of the pier float belly up in the inlet. close on the harbormaster of amity day he is sitting on a little canvas folding chair, eating a bowl of cheerios with milk and sugar, watching a panorama of ineptitude and greed unfold before his old seaman's eyes. the amity pier area is a minor madhouse: out of state cars elbow local vehicles for parking space at the foot of the dock, and a parade of bounty hunting townspeople, islanders, off islanders, tourist, and others shout and push their way onto the crowded pier, each carrying some bizarre or appropriate tool for the real or imagined capture of an unarmed shark of indeterminate size. rods and reels, drop lines, crossbows, slingshots, harpoons, shotguns, rifles, nets and tridents; every fishing supply store and sporting goods house within a hundred miles has been cannibalized to equip this weird array.}
<B>__{angle on brody and hendricks arriving on the scene}
<A>__{not having room to bring their police vehicle anywhere near this mess, they are proceeding on foot into the confusion.}
<C>__{hendricks}
<D>__{...so then denherder and charlie sat there trying to catch their breath, and figuring out how to explain to charlie's wife what happened to her freezer full of meat.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{that wasn't funny.}
<A>__{some of the locals greet hendricks with occasional nods of recognition, or an ad libbed "hi, lenny," or "hey, lenny."}
<C>__{hendricks}
<D>__{mrs. kintner must've put her ad in field and stream.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{looks more like the readers of the national enquirer.}
<A>__{angle on boat rental pier an argument is in progress between and out of towner and the boat rental man.}
<D>__{out of towner you're charging me double the usual rent! i didn't come up here all the way from new rochelle to be gouged by some yankee cracker!}
<C>__{boat rental man}
<D>__{prices go up june first every year. you want a nice cheap, leaky boat, you go down to the hamptons.}
<P>__{(he sees brody)}
<D>__{right, chief?}
<B>__{angle looking out to sea}
<A>__{making its way through the channel towards the dock is a sleek, expensive runabout with the name "fascinatin' rhythm" on the stern. it's professionally handled, and rumbles in as it coasts in towards the dock area. some other boats clear the way for it, zig zagging in the harbor, causing an annoying chop.}
<B>__{close on boat}
<A>__{matt hooper, a bearded, bespectacled young man with an intent look, is maneuvering the vessel peering through his windscreen at the ragtag collection of seafaring loonies all around him.}
<B>__{back to dockside}
<A>__{hendricks is mediating the argument between the two men, and we can hear a plaintive "but lenny," from the local as brody sees something that makes him move towards the other side of the dock. we see him cross to a little boat built for two or three that is settling low in the water as a seventh man climbs in with his gear.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{hey! you know how many men that's supposed to hold?}
<C>__{man in boat }
<D>__{whatever's safe, right?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{what you got ain't safe. you take some guys off or you don't go out.}
<A>__{ben gardner and his boat, flicka matt hooper is gliding into the dockside, and ben throws him a line to help make fast as he moors. it's a small island of courtesy in an otherwise discourteous mob. hooper nods politely as he ties his boat up and steps onto the dock.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{gardner}
<D>__{hello, back.}
<A>__{he's standing near where brody is finishing after his encounter with the chummers. brody approaches ben gardner.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{you going out too, ben?}
<C>__{gardner}
<D>__{might give it a try. that three thousand bounty beats working for a living.}
<P>__{(yells to his mate)}
<D>__{we ready?}
<A>__{the mate nods "yes" and starts to prepare to get under way. ben and his mate move away from the dock, headed towards the channel and the open sea leaving felix and pratt to scamper around the dock looking for another ride. another dock area, close by a particularly awkward moment between a small sailboat and a couple of powerboats. the sailboat is trying to hoist sail to make it away from the pier under sail, a real yachtsman's conceit, since hornblower himself probably couldn't navigate through this mess. brody, a landlubber for sure, is trying to direct traffic to untangle this new mess.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{just back up! no, the other way! cut it to your left! your other left! the big boat, your front end is out way too far. little boat, stay still!}
<A>__{amidst all this, we can hear the angry shouts of the entangled crews.}
<C>__{skipper 1 }
<D>__{dammit, a vessel under sail has the right of way!}
<C>__{skipper 2 }
<D>__{you schmuck, you ain't under sail, you're goddam drifting!}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(stepping in to help)}
<D>__{ahoy, sail! you got an oar? well, scull it out!}
<C>__{sailboat skipper}
<D>__{tell that stinkpotter to belay!}
<C>__{motorboat skipper}
<D>__{tell that ragsetter i'm going to poke him in the snoot!}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{just cast off in turn and make for the channel, ok?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{brody starts back towards the shore, hooper is by his side.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{excuse me, i wonder if you could tell me...}
<A>__{before he can finish, brody spots something on shore that moves him to shout to his deputy.}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(noticing something)}
<D>__{is that dynamite?}
<A>__{brody looks, and stops by a boat that's about to cast off. he holds out his hand.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{if that's dynamite, give it here, or don't leave port.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{aw, c'mon, it's just fireworks. sharks like fireworks, it attracts them.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{hand it over.}
<A>__{the man passes brody a cigar box filled with dynamite sticks. brody tucks the dynamite under his arm, and continues down the pier. hooper is still with him. all around them are two distinctly different breeds; the quiet pros, like ben gardner, in well worn, comfortable clothes, with efficient, sensible gear, and the amateur crazies, with all manner of weapons and impractical, silly tourist clothing.}
