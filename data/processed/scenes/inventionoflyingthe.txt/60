<L>__{interior hospital room day}
<A>__{mark bursts into the hospital room to find his grandmother, martha looking tired and scared, hooked up to dozens of machines, the heart monitor beeping ominously.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{grandma, they just called me. what's going on? are you okay?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i don't know, i fell on my way back to my room.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{what do the doctors say?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{they say i will probably die tonight.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{there's a knock on the door. the doctor enters.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{oh, hello. i was just coming in to check on her, you must be martha bellison's grandson.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{what are you talking about she's going to die?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{i'm sorry. it just doesn't look good. she's suffered a major heart attack and her heart is very weak, her pulse not very strong, her blood pressure is dropping rapidly and most likely she'll have a fatal heart attack during the night.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{fuck.}
<A>__{the doctor checks martha's chart.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{yup, still going to die.}
<A>__{mark sits down next to martha, in total shock.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{i'm sorry, guys. i wish i felt something for you two, but i really don't. i do this exact thing about thirty times a night and it's really hardened me to human suffering. on a side note, it's fajita night at the cafeteria downstairs. you might think about grabbing a bite to eat there after your grandma dies.}
<A>__{the doctor leaves. mark holds his grandmother's hand, her hand is shaking.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i'm so scared, mark. i don't want to die. you know, people don't talk about it much, but death is a horrible thing. one minute you're alive, there's a whole world around you, humming and jumping, people coming in and out, doors opening and closing, love and anger and the whole mess of it all, and then like that, it's all gone.}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{this is it mark, only a few hours left of this until an eternity of nothingness.}
<A>__{the wheels in mark's head are spinning again. suddenly the heart monitor starts beating rapidly and martha lurches in pain.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{grandma!}
<A>__{mark immediately slams on the big red "call nurse" button, holding his grandmother down as she lurches in pain. seconds later three nurses burst into the room.}
<D>__{nurse #1 she's seizing.}
<A>__{nurse #2 begins filling a syringe. mark sits by his grandmother's head, they're both looking right at each other.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i'm scared.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{listen closely to me, grandma. i have a surprise for you.}
<A>__{we focus on mark and his grandmother, inches from one another as the paramedics busy themselves around martha's dying body.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you're wrong about what happens when you die. it's not an eternity of nothingness.}
<A>__{martha is hanging on to every word mark is saying.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{when you die you're going to go to your favorite place in the whole world. and you're going to be with all of the people you've ever loved and who have ever loved you. and you're going to be young again, and you'll be able to run through the fields and dance and jump, and there will be no sadness, no pain, just love and laughing and happiness. there will be ponies made of gold, and everyone will live in giant mansions, and everything will smell like cookies. and it will last for an eternity, grandma. an eternity.}
<A>__{tears are rolling down martha's face as a glimmering smile overtakes her face. mark looks up to see the nurses, paramedics and doctors all staring at mark in total shock.}
<D>__{nurse #1 go on.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{what else happens?}
<A>__{the cardiogram flat lines.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{do your jobs!}
<A>__{everyone distractedly goes back to helping the grandmother.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you're going to be happy forever, grandma. i promise you. say hello to my mom for me. tell her i love her.}
<A>__{again, everyone has stopped helping martha, they're all listening intently. some of them are crying.}
<D>__{nurse #2}
<P>__{(tearfully)}
<D>__{i'm going to see my mother again when i die.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{tell us more, please.}
<A>__{martha stops breathing. the machine flatlines. and with that martha is gone.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{damn it.}
<A>__{mark turns away from his grandmother. standing outside in the hallway is jennifer, watching mark with true empathy in her eyes.}
