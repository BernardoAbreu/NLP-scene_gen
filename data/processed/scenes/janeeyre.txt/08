<L>__{exterior day. by a river.}
<A>__{jane is crouched on a rock watching the waters go by. the sky is overcast. the first big drops of rain land on the stones. jane makes no movement. a raven lands on a rock nearby. jane is suddenly filled with a wild rage. she picks up a stone and hurls it at the bird with a raw cry. the gesture exhausts her. she watches the bird wheel away, as the rain starts to pour.}
