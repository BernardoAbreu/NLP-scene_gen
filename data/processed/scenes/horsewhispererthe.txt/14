<A>__{annie, casually dressed, enters the empty offices of her magazine. she turns on the light, revealing a large row of stalls and glassed in private offices. everywhere we look, we see indications of the kind of magazine she edits. she strolls to her office the largest surrounded by windows. the office walls are covered with photos, most of which are cover stories on annie. (one photo is of annie's father martin. a british ambassador with his young daughter on his lap, her arms affectionately around his neck. her mother stands right behind them, posing like a member of the royal family.) annie sits and takes a breath. the only photo on her desk is a family portrait, taken when annie was given the crystal award robert, grace, herself and the award. she checks her watch it is almost 9:30.}
