<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior precipice edge day binocular pov}
<A>__{from the top of the bluff, someone is looking down through binoculars gabe and hal's orange jackets are plainly visible a few hundred yards below.}
<B>__{ryan}
<A>__{lowers the binoculars, and keys an ear button on the headset radio he's wearing, sending a beep.}
<B>__{inside the plane}
<A>__{travers is wearing another headset the others are just resting in the seats}
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(into mouthpiece)}
<D>__{have they arrived?}
<P>__{(two beeps in response)}
<D>__{good. return to the plane and cover your tracks.}
<C>__{qualen}
<P>__{(to others)}
<D>__{get ready.}
<B>__{on the mountain below}
<A>__{hal and gabe are tired, but get a second wind from the excitement of being almost on top. gabe stops, breathless for a second, then goes on. hal lags a little behind.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{come on the hard part's over.}
<A>__{gabe heads up and over the mountain's edge crash site and helps hal up. from here, the rest of the range looms large. even in the continuing snowstorm, it's a spectacular sight but gabe and hal don't pause to enjoy it. this isn't a trip for sport. hal looks off into the trees, and sees the torn tree stumps from the plane crash.}
<C>__{hal}
<P>__{(grim)}
<D>__{that's it.}
<A>__{hal and gabe run into the wooded area and follow the wreckage felled trees, a smashed wing and reach}
<B>__{the fuselage}
<A>__{which sits intact by the other edge of the precipice.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{i thought the fuselage was broken. that looks pretty cozy.}
<C>__{hal}
<P>__{(puzzled too)}
<D>__{the pilot was hysterical.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{something's wrong here }
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{does this look like a prank to you? come on }
<A>__{hal pulls open the passenger door and goes in gabe, wary, takes a look around the plane.}
<B>__{inside the fuselage}
<A>__{it's comparatively dark in here hal starts in, shining a light the beam finds hal's pov travers slumped down on the cabin floor, a blanket wrapped around him he's shaking and is generally giving a good impression of a shock victim. hal rushes to him.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{relax we're here to help }
<A>__{"weak", travers whispers as hal gives him some water.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{don't try to talk }
<A>__{travers won't quit hal leans down to hear.}
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(hoarse whisper)}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{ where? what are you }
<A>__{a gun barrel moves into view as it presses against hal's neck. heldon and ryan are right behind him. travers instantly drops his act.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{you said "we". where are the rest?}
<A>__{gabe outside the fuselage notes footprints in the snow fresh ones and kneels down to look at the cable wrapped around the tree. no ordinary accident. but before he can think about this, he gets an earful of gun barrel from qualen, who is behind him.}
<B>__{inside the fuselage}
<A>__{qualen hustles gabe inside the plane his hands are on his head, and his pack has been removed. qualen throws the pack to ryan and delmer, who rifle through it, removing anything that could be a weapon they quickly confiscate gabe's bolt gun and ice axe.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{what's for dinner?}
<P>__{(kynette tosses packet)}
<D>__{ugh. "dried beef slices with barbeque sauce."}
<P>__{(tosses it back)}
<D>__{try and make this edible.}
<A>__{travis looks at hal's park ranger badge.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{hal tucker.}
<P>__{(to gabe)}
<D>__{where's yours?}
<C>__{qualen}
<D>__{he doesn't have one. just a wallet.}
<A>__{qualen tosses it to travers, who glances through it.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{gabe walker...}
<P>__{(notes photo of maggie)}
<D>__{very attractive.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{my ex.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{too bad. let me tell you what's on for today. we'd like you to help settle a wager. you see, we lost some luggage }
<A>__{travers motions to ryan and qualen, who shove gabe and hal forward in the cabin. travers takes out the tracer monitor.}
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(showing them the blips)}
<D>__{see these? now i've bet the gentlemen behind you that you know enough about this mountain range to lead us to each of these, quickly, and that you'd be happy to do so. they bet me you couldn't and wouldn't.}
<P>__{(guns are clicked)}
<D>__{now tell me who wins?}
<A>__{gabe and hal eye each other no choice. gabe nods.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{good dog. now let's get this expedition started.}
