We ROTATE AROUND, revealing the tower to actually be a LAMP -- not rising up from a surface, but hanging down from a white ceiling. The bulb unlit. Directly below the lamp is the very definition of innocence - a sleeping child. Chest rising and falling with each breath. We HOVER over the young boy...watching him. A blanket emblazoned with dinosaurs is draped across his limbs. His mouth is slack, eyelids twitching to dreams unseen. The truly deep sleep that an adult can only wish for.

His heaving snores have woken her up. She is RENAI (pronounced Renee) LAMBERT (36). With a quiet determination she is holding on to her youthful good looks, but the lines of age are creeping in. She has settled into the `comfort' years of a marriage: hair pinned up messily, wearing dowdy pajamas. She beholds her husband, taking him in. Considering him. He snorts and smacks his lips.

Renai plops cross-legged onto the floor and rips open one of the boxes, marked BOOKS. She plucks out a handful of books and lines them up on the bookshelf. Then another handful. They are all self-help and self-improvement books. Titles like `Be The Better You' and `Inch By Inch, It's A Cinch: A Guide To Achieving Your Goals' pop out. She spots a sealed box labelled PHOTO ALBUMS. She strips away the tape and wrestles out a dusty album of wedding photos. Smiling faces greet her as she thumbs through the pages. The happy couple.

He looks up, his eye drawn to the picture on the wall. With total astonishment, he sees the two remaining tacks works themselves free, popping out of the wall. The drawing floats down to the ground. Josh stoops down, picking it up. It is a drawing split into two halves. The left half is a self portrait of Dalton, lying in bed, looking down from above. The right half is a depiction of outer space - squiggly stars and bloated planets. Dalton has drawn another version of himself on this side, flying above the house with another man. At the bottom of the first drawing, Dalton has written `Last night I watched myself sleep'. A tear falls down Josh's face. He begins to cry. Deep and painful tears he has long pent up. Beneath the second drawing, Dalton has written `Then I flew away.'}

Specs nods to Tucker silently, then produces an odd looking device made from GREY CLOTH. It almost resembles a gas mask from World War 1, with a cone shaped muzzle that fits over the mouth and nose. The snout of the facemask is like an elongated elephant trunk, coiling outwards and ending in an old listening device, like an early version of a microphone. Specs slips two hooks over Elise's ears and gently places the device over her nose and mouth. He then takes a seat next to her, behind Renai, who holds Elise's hand. Specs takes out his notepad and fixes a small apparatus around his neck that holds a flashlight in place. He flicks it on, then holds the microphone end of Elise's facemask up to his ear, a pencil gripped in the other hand. Dead silence descends over the group like a blanket.

<CHAR>__{RENAI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Elise, what was that noise?}
<ACTION>__{Elise simply looks up at her. The utter terror on her face is palpable. Her neck is bleeding from scratch marks.}
<CHAR>__{RENAI } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Jesus...what happened to you?}

<DIAL>__{Where's Josh?}

<DIAL>__{Josh? Josh?!}

<ACTION>__{Renai dashes from room to room in the hallway, pitching each door open. Each room is empty. Josh is nowhere to be found.}
<LOC>__{INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - SAME TIME}
<ACTION>__{Elise stares at Tucker's camera in a state of catatonic dread. Renai backs into the room, her own fear rising in her gut. She leans down and grabs Elise by the shoulders.}
<CHAR>__{RENAI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Elise, what happened? You're scaring me, tell me where Josh is?}
<ACTION>__{Elise finally looks up at her. Seeing the "expert" so afraid unnerves Renai. When the lion-tamer drops his whip and runs, you know the lion is vicious. Elise opens her mouth to speak...but nothing comes out. Instead, she simply holds up the camera, showing Renai the digital display of the photo she took. We do not see it. We simply see the look of horror on Renai's face.}

<LOC>__{INT. LIVING ROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK}
<ACTION>__{We have returned to the previous scene - only now we are seeing it through Elise's eyes. Elise is sitting on the couch, alone. Trying to recover from the nights events. She glances up when Josh approaches her.}

<DIAL>__{Maybe I can forget again.}

<CHAR>__{JOSH } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{I'll start by giving these back.}
<ACTION>__{As he hands them to Elise, she sees with fear that his hand is withered and wrinkled. Shocked, she looks up at his face.}
<CHAR>__{JOSH } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{What's wrong?}

<CHAR>__{JOSH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What's the matter, Elise?}
<ACTION>__{She spins around and lifts Tucker's camera up to her face, aiming it at him. She depresses the trigger and takes a photo of him, bathing the whole corridor in white light. --and in that split second, Josh is replaced by the Old Woman! Elise lowers the camera, horrified. For a beat, the Old Woman just glares at her... ...then she CHARGES at Elise, arms outstretched, wrapping her white hands around the soft flesh of Elise's throat. Elise CHOKES, eyes bulging, spittle flying from her mouth, as the pale hands of the Old Woman dig into her thorax, droplets of blood running down her chest where the yellowing finger- nails have CUT IN : to the flesh. The Old Woman smiles - a merciless harlequin grin that mocks Elise's pain. She lets Elise go, letting her drop to the floor. The Old Woman turns and glares down the corridor. Something has caught her attention. A distant scream.}
<LOC>__{INT. BATHROOM, NEW HOUSE - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The door groans open, a blade of light penetrating pitch black darkness. The silhouette of the Old Woman floats ethereally into the bathroom. She steps up to the mirror, then reaches into her tattered Victorian dress and produces a candle. She lights the candle with a match, holding it beneath her chin and glaring into the reflective surface of the mirror. Instead of seeing her own reflection though, she sees THROUGH the mirror as if it were a window. In it, she can see the BASEMENT of the Lambert's previous residence. Josh bursts into the basement, carrying Dalton.}

<DIAL>__{Put me down, I can run!}
<ACTION>__{Josh sets Dalton down, who scampers up the stairs. We are watching the same scene we saw earlier play out in the mirror. Josh is about to follow when he turns and spies a familiar face. He looks at the Old Woman...seeing her through the `window'.}

<ACTION>__{--the basement. Josh screams at the Old Woman as she stares at him through what he thinks is a window. THEY HAVE SWAPPED PLACES. He is now in The Further, and she is in our world.}

<DIAL>__{Get away the fuck away from me. I'm not scared of you, just leave me alone! Get away from me!}

<ACTION>__{--our world. The Old Woman smiles at Josh's rage. She finds it amusing. With an eerily unblinking gaze, she snuffs out the plume of flame with a single puff of breath...plunging the bathroom into darkness... ...and snuffing out Josh forever... ...and ever.}
