<ACTION>__{Something evil is lurking deep withing the wooded moun- tains of Tennessee, and the camera takes its point of view. Rising from a swampy bog, the mud slides from view allowing it to see early morning mist hanging about the forest. Creeping silently past trees, gliding over small shrubs, it moves onward through the woods until a mammoth oak rests directly in its path. The tree is uprooted by this unseen force, and falls with a deafening crash.}

<ACTION>__{Near by, a stretch of highway curves along the base of a mountain. The road winds off into oblivion beyond other peaks. From behind view, the rumble of an engine can be heard. It is a large logging truck headed south. Moving away, the truck becomes smaller until finally it disap- pears in the distance. From where the truck emerged, a dilapidated gold 1973 Oldsmobile comes into view.}

Both SCOTT and SHELLY wear "Michigan State" T-shirts, and are students along with the others at that univer- sity. SCOTT is driving and SHELLY sits next to him up front. ASHLY, LINDA and CHERYL are in back. They listen to an old "Baby Moses And The Thrillers" song on the radio, and SHELLY is slapping the dash board as if it were a drum.}

An old grandfather clock stands silently in one corner, partially hidden in the shadows. A door in the rear of the cabin leads to a small work shed containing a work bench and an assortment of tools upon the wall. Located centrally in the main room is a trap door leading to the cellar.

<ACTION>__{CHERYL sits alone in the living room near the window. She is drawing sketches of the old clock. As she works, the ticking stops unexpectedly. CHERYL puts down her pencil and looks up to the clock. It stands silently in the cor- ner with its hands frozen in position. There is a rust- ling from the woods. CHERYL looks out the window but can see only the trees. Something is moving outside, yet re- mains hidden within the forest. A gust of wind fills the room. CHERYL glances down at her hand. It turns a pale white and begins to shake and jerk about uncontrollably. She stares on incredulously as her hand, guided by some unseen force picks up the pencil and begins to sketch a figure upon her pad. The wind gales through the open window but dies down slowly as her hand completes the drawing. Whatever was at the edge of the woods has now retreated further into them. Her hand loses the pale cast and is now under control once more. CHERYL picks up her pad of paper. The likeness of a book with some form of ancient writing on its cover has been sketched. She looks to the woods which are now silent. A snapping of wood is heard from the cellar. CHERYL quickly turns to the trap door still nailed shut in the floor. Pos- sibly just a mouse, but she fixes her gaze upon it. Another sound, almost like faint breathing comes from the cellar.}

<DIAL>__{Well, this one of the clock's not bad.}
<ACTION>__{LINDA picks up the sketch and walks over to the clock with it a few steps away. She stands comparing it to the real thing with her back to CHERYL and ASHLY.

Since May, a group of assoc- iate professors and myself have been excavating the ruins of Ca'n Dar. I believe I have made an important find in that area, and thus the reason for this log. With it, I can keep an ac- curate record of translations from my latest find; the first of six, the others still lost, volumes of ancient Sumarian burial practices and rites. Basically, it is a book of do's and don'ts dealing with the deceased en- titled "Naturan Demanto" roughly trans- lated "Book Of The Dead." It is bound in human flesh, and inked with blood of the deceased...}

As legend has it, only the sacred high priests of the Ca'n Dar tribe could posess these books, for they alone could properly control the resurrected de- mons. It is only through the act of reciting the resurrection passage that these demons would be able to posess the living. For many years, it was thought that this legend-}

SHELLY reaches down, picks up the Sumarian dagger, and holding SCOTT by his throat with one hand, she raises the dagger with the other. ASHLY, slightly injured, crawls to his feet. SCOTT grabs her raised arm and although choking, swings his camping knife from its side sheath and slices deep into SHELLY's raised wrist, almost severing it. A murky black ooze pumps from the wound.

ASHLY watches terrified, unable to move as SHELLY raises her dangling hand (Still clutching the dagger) to her mouth and bites it off. The useless part falls to the floor with the dagger still firmly in its fist. SCOTT, now almost dead, grabs her severed hand clutching the dagger and in a last attempt, swings it around ramming the blade into her spine. SHELLY screetches along with CHERYL in the cellar, the old grandfather clock gongs and lightning strikes all at the same instant. SHELLY reaches around with her remaining arm to clutch at the severed hand and knife protruding from her own back. A thick black ooze pours from the wound as she bends backward screaming. ASHLY stands in horror, clutching the axe, unable to move. Black ooze runs from SHELLY's mouth as her body writhes about spasmatically upon the floor.

<ACTION>__{ASHLY arrives in time, but CHERYL has already started reaching in. He slams the door on her fingers and rams his gun butt down upon them. Horrible screams are heard as CHERYL withdraws her hand. ASHLY is able to slam the door and bolt it. He runs to the back entrance lead- ing to the shed and locks it also. On his way back to the main room, he pumps his rifle in preparation. It is his last shell.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(To himself) More shells. Where did}
<DIAL>__{I see that box of shells?}

<ACTION>__{From the basement, the trap door lifts open and ASHLY decends. The bottom step, now rotten, breaks under his weight, and ASHLY sprawls to the floor. Slowly, he picks himself up and walks through the dividing stone doorway beneath the water pipes to a small table. On it, he finds the box of shells and quickly loads them into the gun. He ascends the steps and enters the main room once more.}
<LOC>__{97 INT. - NIGHT - M.R.}
<ACTION>__{The sound of ticking catches ASHLY's attention. He looks up to see the old grandfather clock slowly winding back- wards. He watches and waits tensely. Turning carefully, ASHLY tries to monitor all the windows. The ticking grows louder. A shadow passes in the window before him and he fires, shattering the glass into a million pieces. Wind whips through the cabin swirling glass and leaves to the floor. ASHLY waits, leaning against the front door for something to happen. He is tense and more determined than ever to survive. He whispers to himself.}

<DIAL>__{C'mon, c'mon, get it over with, why are you torturing me like this?}
<ACTION>__{Placing his hand to his side, ASHLY discovers something in his pocket. He lifts it to his eyes. It is LINDA's necklace.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{...Linda. (He whispers)}
<ACTION>__{The ticking stops. He tilts his head for the slightest sound. All is silent. From behind, two arms rip through the door and grab him. ASHLY tears away and falls to the floor. The necklace is tossed away in the confusion. CHERYL's hands pull away and she looks through a hole in the door. From the floor, ASHLY raises his rifle and fires at her head.}

<ACTION>__{Clutching at her face and screaming horribly, CHERYL is jolted from the door.}
<LOC>__{99 INT. - NIGHT - M.R.}
<ACTION>__{ASHLY places a dresser and chair against the holes in the door. Behind ASHLY, SCOTT's corpse sits up and opens its white eyes. It stands and moves toward ASHLY. He turns with the gun, but SCOTT knocks it out of his hands. Desperately, ASHLY grabs a table lamp and shatters it across SCOTT's head, then jams the exposed socket into his face, shocking him. SCOTT staggers back several steps, then continues after ASHLY.}
<LOC>__{100 EXT. - NIGHT - CAB}
<ACTION>__{Outside, Cheryl is now pounding against the front door.}
<LOC>__{101 INT. - NIGHT - M.R.}
<ACTION>__{ASHLY picks up a small table upon which are the Book Of The Dead, and the professors journal. He throws it at SCOTT. This does not affect him, and he advances closer. The Book Of The Dead lands near the fireplace and edges of the paper darken from the heat. SCOTT picks up ASHLY and begins to throttle him as if he were a rag doll. The front door begins to give under CHERYL's pounding. ASHLY brings his hands to SCOTT's eyes. With a crash, CHERYL breaks through the front door and begins to push the dresser away. Pages from the Book Of The Dead are smolder- ing now. ASHLY jams his fingers into SCOTT's eyes and slips from the grip. SCOTT clutches his eye sockets and his back begins to smolder. ASHLY now sees the book. Its pages burn at the edge. CHERYL topples the dresser and enters the room. Her face is partially torn away from the shot gun blast. ASHLY rushes to throw the book onto the burning logs, but CHERYL, smoldering also, gives him a backhand blow across the head, and he is sent sprawling to the floor. She grabs a fireplace poker with her crushed fingers and turns back to ASHLY who is crawl- ing toward the fireplace. When almost in reach of the book, SCOTT grabs his leg and begins to pull ASHLY back- ward. CHERYL approaches with smoke pouring from her clothes and slams ASHLY across the back with her poker. ASHLY screams. A glitter catches his eye. It is LINDA's necklace. Grabbing it, he tosses the end with a clasp toward the book. It slides off the cover. SCOTT pulls him back once more as ASHLY swings the necklace in a last desperate attempt. CHERYL raises the poker for the final blow. The necklace drapes over the book and as ASHLY is dragged, the clasp hooks the cover and pulls the book with him. With a yank, he seizes the book and tosses it upon the blaze. CHERYL and SCOTT freeze. The Book Of The Dead burns in a bluish green flame. Smoke pours from SCOTT and CHERYL as distant demonical screams are heard from the woods. The fireplace poker slips from CHERYL's hand and sticks into the wood scarcely an inch from ASHLY's head. The bodies of SCOTT and CHERYL then begin to cave inward upon themselves, collapsing to the floor in smoldering heaps. Finally, nothing is left but the burnt clothing and a blackish grey ooze on the floor where their bodies once were. The old clock begins to tick again, normally. ASHLY slowly climbs to his feet to stand above the fuming debris. Open- ing his hand, he looks down at LINDA's necklace. The force retreats from him, out the door, slowly returning to the darkness from which it emerged. Gradually, the natural sounds of the forest swell and trees lose their gloom as Autumn colors return. The first rays of sunlight gleam over the woods beyond the cabin. Daybreak has finally come.}
