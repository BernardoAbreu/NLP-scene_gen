<L>__{interior jungle}
<A>__{an almost perfect path has been cleared through the thick jungle. indiana and the others run through the path. indy suddenly pauses. motioning for the others to stop. a puzzled look covers his face.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{wait... listen... they're not following us...}
<A>__{one of the pirates continues to move forward. his foot trips a thin string that stretches across the path. whoosh! a booby trapped palm tree swings forward! it slams into the pirate! like a giant baseball bat! it sends the pirate flying upward. high into the air! his body is thrown several feet into the jungle. indiana exchanges a cautious look with the others.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{be careful where you step... we've got to move slowly...very slowly...}
<A>__{indiana leads everyone. they creep through the path. indy pauses. camera pans to his waist. a section of vine stretches across the path. another booby trap. indiana crawls beneath the vine. he motions for the others to follow. one by one, they carefully crawl beneath the vine. the guitar player is last. he begins to crawl through. he nearly makes it, when...the top of his guitar hits the vine! the vine snaps. there is a creaking sound. a giant, metal trap, over four feet high, shoots up from the ground! a human trap! the guitar player dives to safety! the trap's sharp metal teeth snap shut! the guitar is snapped in two! soon, the path erupts with countless rows of traps. they eject from the ground. snapping shut. one after the other. everyone begins to run. the traps snap shut only a few feet behind them! everyone rounds a corner... they come upon... an enormous pit! over ten feet deep! filled with countless layers of scorpions! there is nowhere to turn. nowhere to run. the metal traps continue to shut behind them! indiana removes his sword. he slices at a bamboo tree. the traps continue to shut behind him. getting closer. closer. indiana gives a final whack to the tree. it falls. stretching across the pool. only a few feet above the stinging scorpions. indiana begins to climb across. moving hand over hand. everyone hurriedly follows. the bamboo tree creaks with their every movement. their feet dangle only inches above the scorpions. the last pirate grabs hold of the bamboo tree, just as the final metal trap shuts! just missing him! as the last pirate makes his way across the pit, he drops a small bag of gold coins. the coins rest a few feet below. directly on top of the scorpions. the pirate pauses. deciding whether to climb to safety or retrieve the coins. everyone else has made it across. the greedy pirate wants his money. with his left hand, he holds tightly to the bamboo tree. with the other, he reaches for the coins. his fingers are inches from the ciins. but he loses his grip. he falls. into the pit. surrounded by hundreds of scorpions. he struggles to get out. climbing. swimming. but he only manages to sink. the pirate's screams die, as his body is engulfed by the stinging scorpions. indiana and the others continue ahead. moving slowly. carefully. someone's foot steps on a wooden trigger. there is another creaking sound. behind everyone, a large bamboo door ejects from the ground. it leads to an underground cage. the door creaks open. three ferocious lions leap out! teeth bared. growling. they come for the humans. everyone dashes forward. running. the lions are in hot pursuit. fast. the humans don't stand a chance. suddenly, clare stops. she turns. facing the charging lions. indiana looks back. screaming.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{clare! what are you...?!?}
<A>__{the lions stop. inches from clare. they surround her. ready to attack. indiana watches. puzzled. clare begins to make bizarre purring and cooing sounds. the lions pause. they recognize the sounds. clare continues. the lions begin to warm up to her. clare kneels. she pets the beasts. the lions snuggle up to clare. licking her face. indiana and the others come closer. puzzled. clare explains.}
<C>__{clare}
<D>__{i imitated the sound of a lion mother calling her babies.}
<A>__{betsy is impressed. indiana smiles. relieved.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{c'mon. let's get outta' }
<A>__{indy turns...face to face with a grotesque shrunken head! he steps back. the shrunken head is worn around the neck of a tall, muscular tribal chief. leader of the warriors. countless natives stand behind the chief. a look of anger...hate...covers the chief's face. indiana gives a hopeful glance to kezure.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{is this the tribal chief you told me about?... your friend?...}
<C>__{kezure}
<P>__{(points to shrunken head)}
<D>__{no. that is him.}
<A>__{indiana rolls his eyes. the warriors surround everyone. arrows aimed. ready to kill. the warriors lead everyone out of the path.}
