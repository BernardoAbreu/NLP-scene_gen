<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior alley night}
<A>__{mini flashlight leading the way, frank steps gingerly down the refuse strewn alley. ahead: footsteps. he kicks something, thinking it's trash, looks down; a body rustles, pair of sleeping eyes look up. suddenly everything seems silent. he passes a row of glowing red doors. shadows flash in the distance. he hears a woman crying, shoots his flashlight her direction: nothing. frank hears the voice again: rose's voice :}
<C>__{rose's voice}
<D>__{why did you kill me, frank?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i didn't mean to.}
<C>__{rose's voice}
<D>__{you should have helped me.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i tried to help. i wanted to.}
<A>__{shadows like hands extend against the wall ahead.}
<C>__{rose's voice}
<D>__{don't you love me?}
<A>__{frank moves toward the reaching arms. the shadows swing like baseball bats. noel screams. suddenly, before him, a blurry mass of bloody dreadlocks noel goes flying to the ground, walls standing over him swinging the bat, hitting him, killing him.}
<C>__{walls}
<D>__{i got him, frank!}
<A>__{frank stands back, watching walls and noel like some static black and white tv screen from his childhood. noel, trying to protect himself, cries out.}
<C>__{walls }
<P>__{(swinging bat)}
<D>__{to the moon, alice! you little motherfucker!}
<A>__{frank charges forward into walls, sending tom, the baseball bat flying. walls on the ground. frank bends over noel: noel's face covered with blood, gasping for air, blowing red bubbles, convulsing.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(to walls)}
<D>__{get the kit! we're gonna tube him!}
<C>__{walls}
<D>__{frank!}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{do it!}
<C>__{walls}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{frank!}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(to noel)}
<D>__{we're gonna save you, noel. you're gonna be all right.}
<P>__{(to walls)}
<D>__{do it, tom! i will call for fucking backup, i swear!}
<C>__{walls}
<D>__{you're crazy.}
<A>__{noel unconscious: tom hurries down the alley toward the ambulance as frank opens noel's mouth.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you're going to make it! you're going to make it!}
<A>__{pressing noel's chest, frank lowers his mouth, starts cpr. his mouth to noel's. in the distance: walls' footsteps returning.}
