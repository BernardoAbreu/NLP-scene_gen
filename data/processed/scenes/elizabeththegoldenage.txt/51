<A>__{a man who looks like a shop assistant sits grabbing a quick lunch. he's the torturer. nearby on a blood stained bench lies a huddled half naked figure, trembling uncontrollably. it's francis throckmorton. he's neither manacled nor guarded. his body is so broken it's not necessary. walsingham enters. the torturer jumps to his feet. walsingham goes to throckmorton. he gazes at him, shaking his head. he's getting too old for this dirty business.}

<A>__{he signs to the torturer. the torturer goes into an adjoining cell.}
<C>__{walsingham}
<D>__{he's been questioned, as you have. i do have to know, you see.}
<A>__{the torturer and a guard enter, dragging between them the broken but living body of old throckmorton.}

<D>__{no!}
<A>__{old throckmorton looks up, eyes blank with suffering.}
<C>__{throckmorton}
<D>__{enough! you want a name, i will give you a name.}
<C>__{walsingham}
<D>__{well?}
