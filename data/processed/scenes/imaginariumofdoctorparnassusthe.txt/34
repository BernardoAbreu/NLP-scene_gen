<A>__{valentina, anton and percy manhandle the man over the parapet and onto the pavement. dr. parnassus has just stepped out onto the top of the wagon. soaked. he's drunk and is swaying.}
<C>__{dr. parnassus}
<D>__{why are you fishing dead people out of the river? he's dead. leave him. let's go. before the police turn up.}
<A>__{he goes, unsteadily, back inside. valentina and anton drag the man under the wagon, out of the rain. the man is dressed in an expensive saville row suit. his jacket pockets are full of strange weights and arcane symbols have been scrawled on his forehead. he's about 30 years old and very handsome. the man appears to be dead but valentina decides to try the kiss of life. anton is made uncomfortable seeing valentina administer the kiss of life and he pulls her away.}
<C>__{anton}
<D>__{no! that won't work. and anyway, you d don't know where he's b been. let me...}
<A>__{he brings both fists down hard on the centre of the man's chest. boing! the `dead' man coughs, sits bolt upright, spits out a little metal tube and smashes his head on the underside of the wagon, knocking himself out. the little metal tube clatters over the asphalt.}
<C>__{anton }
<D>__{he's alive!}
<C>__{valentina}
<D>__{thank god.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{well, he was.}
<A>__{anton picks up the little metal tube and examines it.}
