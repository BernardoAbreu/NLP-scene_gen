<L>__{interior queen's bedchamber night}
<A>__{the royal bed, immense and ornate. elizabeth lies here small, awake, and alone.}
<C>__{philip}
<D>__{`elizabeth! the angels weep for you, elizabeth! why do you close your ears to the voice of your loving god?'}
<L>__{exterior forest, spain day}
<A>__{foresters at work felling great trees, working rhythmically, in pairs. from all round echoes the same sound, of axe on timber.}
<C>__{philip }
<D>__{`elizabeth! you are leading the souls of your people to hell! turn back! marry me, and save england!'i spoke to her just as i speak to you now.}
<A>__{ow we see the royal carriage riding through mature forest, accompanied by a mounted entourage. in the carriage the king, philip ii, the infanta and father robert reston.}
<C>__{philip}
<D>__{but she did not listen. she made me a speech about the virtues of virginity. me! virginity! she has brought this on herself.}
<A>__{philip surveys the scene through the carriage window with a shudder.}
<C>__{philip}
<D>__{every tree that falls hurts me. i lose a part of myself. i am cursed with sensitivity. i feel too much.}
<A>__{we don't yet know what the felling of the trees portends. but reston does. to him, it's a glorious sight.}
<C>__{reston}
<D>__{your majesty has a merciful soul.}
<C>__{philip}
<D>__{i sacrifice my country's forests to save the souls of a lost nation. that is true mercy. england is lost to darkness, father. i bring light.}
<A>__{wide now we see the carriage and the royal party crest a hill, and there is revealed an awesome sight: the forest has been felled as far as the eye can see. great piles of cut timber dot the ravaged landscape. everywhere men are at work lopping branches from felled trees. wagon teams haul immense trunks away. fires burn stacks of lopped branches, and the smoke rises up into the empty sky. in the carriage on reston's face as he stares at the fires. he speaks half to himself, out of the depths of his own fanatical certainty.}
<C>__{reston}
<D>__{the light of purifying fire.}
<A>__{he turns and fixes the king with his intent gaze.}
<C>__{reston}
<D>__{my time has come, majesty.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{send me home.}
