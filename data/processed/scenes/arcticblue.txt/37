<L>__{exterior devil's cauldron afternoon}
<A>__{the town is quiet.}
<L>__{interior hot springs spa}
<A>__{corbett soaks in one of the huge wooden tubs with a pudgy inupiat hooker, dixie. he looks up as eric comes into the spa. eric holds corbett's boots, which have been repaired. eric pauses when he sees corbett. there is a flash of recognition between them.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{ben corbett?}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{yep. afraid you have me at a disadvantage.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{kenai at the general store asked me to bring these. didn't expect we'd already met.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{no big deal. we just got off on the wrong foot. what's your name?}
<A>__{eric glances down at corbett's duffel bag, which sits on the floor next to corbett's tub. corbett's magnum rests on top of it, well within reach. corbett notices eric's interest in it. he leans back and smiles.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{desmond.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{new to the country, kid?}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{six months. ecological study for northland oil.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{ecology. folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who.}
<A>__{putting his hand on dixie's shoulder, corbett stands and gets out of the tub. his sinewy body, resembling a scarecrow made of steel cable, is covered with scars. he wraps a towel around his waist and crosses to eric.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.}
<A>__{corbett grabs his boots from eric and finds himself facing a revolver, which eric has been hiding inside one of the boots.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(continuing; smiling)}
<D>__{you wouldn't shoot anyone...}
<C>__{wilder }
<D>__{but i would.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{wilder has come in the back way and stands behind corbett with a 12 gauge shotgun. he kicks corbett's magnum out of reach.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{all this for laying traps on private land?}
<C>__{wilder}
<D>__{you left a footprint at the sportsmen's camp. only pretty sight there, ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.}
<A>__{corbett shakes his head but remains implacable.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{christ if i shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth. i've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old.}
<C>__{wilder}
<P>__{(to eric)}
<D>__{i got it from here. thanks.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(to wilder)}
<D>__{sam, give dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit, will you?}
