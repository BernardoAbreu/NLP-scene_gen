<L>__{interior trans siberian restaurant. kitchen day}
<D>__{two of the little girl violinists are fighting, pulling each other's hair. the third is sobbing, sitting on the floor. a young woman in a party dress is carrying a huge silver bowl of sauce across the kitchen. anna looks delighted at the noise and energy of the place. finally semyon emerges from a cloud of steam with a scrap of paper.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{this is an agency that hires casual kitchen staff. maybe you will have more luck there. but i think they will be closed until new year. as anna takes the address, kirill puts his head around the door and yells through the noise.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{papa, ozim is here. semyon is alarmed and claps his hand in urgent fashion.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{ten minutes!!}
<P>__{(to the rest of the kitchen)}
<D>__{fish, fish, fish! ten minutes! ok, kirill, get him a drink and tell him i am coming. semyon takes a pot from the heat, suddenly flustered.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{anna, i'm so sorry i couldn't help. it is sad.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{that's ok. i will probably find out more when i get her diary translated.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{her diary? there is the tiniest of changes in semyon's manner. he lays his heavy pot down.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i found her diary in her bag. a pause. semyon disappears into a billow of steam to put a pan onto the heat then re emerges.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{why did you not tell me you found a diary? he peers at her for a moment, his eyes hardening a little.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{ok, anna, this is how it will be. you will bring the diary here and i will translate it for you. then if we get the names of any relatives i will call them myself. i am something of a... community leader for the russians here in this unfriendly city. what do you say? semyon hoists a passing child into his arms.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i was going to ask my uncle....}
<C>__{semyon}
<P>__{(apparently not hearing)}
<D>__{and when you come i will make you some more gravy like your papa used to make and you can try the}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{fish with the sauce. ok? tomorrow, yes? shall we say seven? anna is a little overwhelmed.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{then it is settled. but for now, you must forgive me. semyon shrugs then kisses anna on both cheeks.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{dosvedania.}
<P>__{(goodbye)}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{dosvedania. anna heads for the door that leads back to the restaurant. semyon goes back to stirring but as he stirs he calls out.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{oh anna, you always work at the trafalgar hospital?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{yes, always. a pause before anna leaves semyon to his clouds of steam.}
