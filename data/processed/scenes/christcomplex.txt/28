<L>__{interior ryan blood's apartment later}
<A>__{ryan is working at his pc when a knock is heard. he gets up from his messy desk and makes his way over to the door. as he swings it open we see louis on the other side. ryan blood's apartment a few moments later ryan leans back in his desk chair. louis has cleared off a spot on a messy couch. the apartment, simply put, is a "shithole"}
<C>__{ryan blood}
<D>__{you're here to learn more about his "coming and goings". to find out what i have seen.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{so far you are dead on.}
<C>__{ryan blood}
<D>__{it's more than that louis }
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{ you know who i am?}
<C>__{ryan blood}
<D>__{i know pretty much everything. i've watched you, studied you...i feel i'm expert on your little game every seventy years.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{ryan blood}
<D>__{oh yes.}
<A>__{ryan picks up a stack of documents and throws the papers one at a time at louis.}
<C>__{ryan blood }
<D>__{you battled as mortals }
<P>__{(beat)}
<C>__{ryan blood }
<D>__{ you were a lamanite then }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{ quinn was a commander of the nephites, last survivor of that nation }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{ the savoir spoke to him, showed him his future...his destiny }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{ see after the death of christ there was some debate on what was going to bring on the end and signal his return }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{ it was decided two great warriors had to fight. the winner would determine the start of the apocalypse. your boss of course needed someone to represent his interests. who better than quinn's old adversary?}
<A>__{louis brushes the pile of papers of his lap.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{where are you going with this you weird little man?}
<C>__{ryan blood}
<D>__{you had strategy in the beginning. middle ages...old west...even world war ii.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{let's take a step back for a second. the old west. lack of faith, corruption, these things make quinn weak. the chink in his armor is his faith in people. you knew that, and corrupting america...a young land...was the key.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{quinn was a step ahead of you, and looked for a human ally. that ally was joseph smith, and quinn...or i mean moroni...led joseph to the plates that later when into }
<A>__{ryan picks a book up and throws it at louis. louis looks down at the "book of mormon".}
<C>__{ryan blood }
<D>__{ his little plan didn't work, but the book is a great coffee table discussion piece. this made him weak louis. you could have destroyed him. the problem is you've allowed yourself to become fond of him. you need to embrace your destiny.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{how do i do that?}
<C>__{ryan blood}
<D>__{this girl is distracting him. get his mind focused on the matter at hand. at this point i'm afraid he isn't even going to fight you.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i'm surprised this girl even likes quinn. he comes across creepy.}
<C>__{ryan blood}
<D>__{maybe that's the key }

<P>__{(lightbulb)}
<D>__{ make her think he's crazy.}
