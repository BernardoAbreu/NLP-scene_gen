<L>__{interior lunch counter evening}
<A>__{a weary santa claus, in a rented beard and over large costume, warms his hands over the steam of his coffee cup. joe and ratso are arguing farther down the counter.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{just ain't right, cheating someone dead and can't cheat back.}
<A>__{in the background, as ratso speaks, hansel and gretel macalbertson enter the lunch counter, inspecting the customers one by one. both wear black turtlenecks and jeans, dressed as twins, both blond and pretty.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{you and my old man. same kinda mind. putting me down till the day he died...}
<P>__{(mimics)}
<D>__{... why can't you be like your brothers? sons a father could be proud of. yeah, sure. my brothers. too goddam busy making something of themselves to show up when the old man's dying!}
<A>__{conditioned reflex, ratso starts to cough. joe sees the macalbertsons in the mirror, standing behind him, studying him. gretel nods, hansel hands joe a large black card, smiling vaguely, then moves on.}
<C>__{ratso }
<D>__{what was that all about?}
<A>__{joe studies the black card, frowning at first, suddenly smiling, turning as if to call after the macalbertsons, but they are disappearing around the corner. joe hands the card to ratso.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you wanna read something, read this. i been invited somewhere.}
<A>__{shocking pink letters on the black card read you are invited to help us bury love tonight at broadway and harmony lane hansel and gretel macalbertson.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{they picked me. the only one in the whole goddam place. you see how they looked me over, up and down before they give me that?}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{so?}
<A>__{joe sees a young man washing cups behind the counter. joe shakes his head, wonderingly, turning to study himself in the mirror.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well, this thought just struck me. it wasn't too long ago i was washing dishes way the hell somewhere in texas.}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{yeah, well, so?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{now i'm here. i'm in new york city. getting picked for things. don't you see what i'm driving at?}
<C>__{ratso}
<D>__{what you're driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy ass party.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{did i say that? did i?}
<P>__{(studies card)}
<D>__{it don't say nothing about you...}
<C>__{ratso}

<C>__{joe}
<D>__{but they picked me, right? so what i will do, i will just say, now look, you want me? well, i don't go nowhere without my buddy here.}
