<L>__{exterior sidewalk n morning}
<A>__{atwood strides toward her car. the pedestrian traffic is light. it's too early for the stores to be open. up ahead a brown van is idling at the curb, the sliding side door is open. atwood can see inside. empty except for some furniture blankets. the person in the driver's seat turns to look into the back. it's the woman who was watching atwood outside the murder house. her hands are unseen in leather gloves. she looks up and their eyes meet. two strangers. the contact is instantly broken. atwood takes a deep breath and smiles. after the rain, the air is brisk and clean. it's good to be alive. slam!!! atwood is body checked by a man who springs out of the recess of a doorway. his arms wrap around her, she's lifted off her feet and the man throws himself and her into the van.}
