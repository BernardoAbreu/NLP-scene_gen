<A>__{suddenly, more blood squirts from the patient's chest. harold shouts in disgust, making the patient more nervous...}
<C>__{male nurse}
<D>__{we're losing him! you gotta do something!}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{very well. i guess we'll have to do this the old fashioned way.}
<A>__{kumar puts a nitrous oxide mask over the patient's face. harold gives kumar a look "what the fuck are you doing?"}
<C>__{kumar }
<D>__{first, we need to clear his c spine. i want stat x rays of the chest and abdomen. give me two large bore ivs and start a ringers lactate push. nurse, we need 2 units of o neg on board.}
<A>__{using the surgical equipment, kumar actually begins removing bullets from the bleeding patient!!! harold can't believe what's going on. suddenly, the patient begins having trouble breathing! he's gasping for air! the beeping sound monitoring his heart rate begins speeding up to an insane pace.}
<C>__{male nurse}
<D>__{doctor! the patient is desatting!}
<A>__{kumar quickly examines the patient's chest...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{ah, i see. the patient's got a collapsed lung. get me a 14 gage angiocath, stat!}
<A>__{after a couple seconds go by...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{what's taking so long?}
<A>__{the nurse hands kumar what is essentially a large needle! kumar directs the needle in the direction of the patient's chest. it's a tense moment. the patient is scared. so is harold. the nurse looks hopeful. kumar looks determined. with a quick thrust, kumar jabs the needle into the patient's chest, causing a rush of air! the patient breathes easier. his heart rate drops back to normal.}
<C>__{male nurse}
<D>__{great catch doctor! his sat is up to 94!}
<A>__{kumar is cool and collected. he turns to the young medical technicians who have been aiding the surgery.}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(casual)}
<D>__{will one of you guys put the chest tube in and wrap this up?}
<A>__{a chorus of "yes, doctors."}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(taking off his gloves)}
<D>__{well, it looks like my work here is done.}
<A>__{kumar pulls the gas mask from the patient's face up to his face and takes a deep breath, getting a big hit of nitrous. he then leans down to the bleeding patient, who is just barely conscious but seems in good spirits...}
<C>__{kumar }
<D>__{say, you wouldn't happen to know the quickest way to get to the white castle in cherry hill from here, do you?}
<L>__{exterior town streets 1:00 am}

<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{hey, check it out! your movie's playing.}
<A>__{outside, to kumar's left, on the marquee of a movie theater we see: "john hughes retrospective. curly sue 9:00. sixteen candles 11:00.}

<D>__{and look who went to see it...}
<A>__{harold looks at the crowd leaving the theater and sees maria standing outside, all by herself. he can't believe it.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{holy shit.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{you see? you thought you two had nothing in common. but it turns out you both have the same lame taste in movies. hey, you wanna see if she wants to come with us to white castle?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{no way. forget about it. just drive.}
<A>__{kumar puts his hands on harold's shoulders to get his undivided attention.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{harold. it's one in the morning. we're an hour from home. and who do we see, but your dream girl standing outside a theater playing your favorite movie. i mean, if we were in a cheesy romantic comedy, and i was your annoying gay friend, this would be the moment i'd tell you "this is a sign."}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{stop it.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{come on. just pretend you're a nerdy asian tom hanks and she's a hot latina meg ryan...with bigger tits. besides, you yourself said things are starting to go our way...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{let's just go!}
<A>__{kumar presses a button causing harold's window to go down.}

<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{hey maria!}
<A>__{maria looks up. harold quickly ducks in his seat. he then}

<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{hey, get your hand off the gas!}
<A>__{kumar tries kicking harold's hand off the gas. just then,}
<B>__{the car begins shaking intensely...}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{oh shit!}
<A>__{harold's infiniti has driven off the road and is speeding}
<B>__{down a dirt and rock covered hill.}
<A>__{kumar grabs control of the wheel and tries to steer the car safely. harold is bumping around on the way down the hill. finally, they reach the bottom of the hill, near a dirt road.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{you asshole! my car's probably all scratched up now!}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{don't blame me. you're the one who ran us off the road!}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{i told you i didn't want to speak to her!}
<P>__{(composing himself)}
<D>__{whatever. let's jut get back on the highway.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{kumar presses the gas. suddenly, we hear a "pop!" harold and kumar look at each other angry and frustrated.}

<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{please. only hicks and italian guys know how to change a tire.}

<C>__{harold}
<D>__{where's my spare tire?}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{shit, where the hell is it?}
<A>__{kumar suddenly remembers...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{oh yeah! don't you remember that time we got baked and started throwing shit off that bridge to see if it would float?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{what bridge? what the hell are you talking about?}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{oh shit. that's right. i was with goldstein. we borrowed your car that day. my bad.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{your bad? what are the hell are we gonna do now?!}
<A>__{suddenly, they see an old pick up truck driving in their direction. harold and kumar wave it down. the truck stops in front of them. the door opens and a shadowy figure begins walking towards them. harold and kumar are nervous. as soon as the figure reaches them, lightening strikes. it's the ugliest man of all time he's in his fifties, wearing a crappy mesh cap, but most notably, he has large bumps and boils all over his face. harold and kumar jump back in fear as they catch their first glimpse of him.}
<C>__{ugly man}
<D>__{you boys need some help?}
<A>__{the ugly man takes off his mesh cap. even his haircut is freaky. he has a skullet (a mullet but with no hair on top). harold and kumar look at each other, freaked out.}

<C>__{harold}
<D>__{thanks for helping us out.}
<C>__{freak show}
<D>__{no problem at all. saw you boys stranded there and thought to myself, "what would jesus do?"}
<A>__{harold and kumar look at each other. they then notice a jesus christ bobble head doll on the dashboard...}
<C>__{freak show}
<D>__{so, you boys worship christ?}
<A>__{the guys look at each other again, not sure how to respond.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{uh...yeah.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{sure, he's great.}
<C>__{ugly man}
<D>__{great. good to hear it. the name's randy...but everyone calls me freak show.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{i'm kumar. this is harold. good to meet you, mr...freak show.}
<C>__{freak show}
<D>__{pleasure's all mine.}
<A>__{after a while, harold starts to notice that they're driving in the middle of a dark woods. it looks very sketchy.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{so where exactly are we going?}
<C>__{freak show}
<D>__{don't worry. my place isn't too far from here. once we get there, i will have your ride fixed up in a jiffy.}
<A>__{the guys silently continue driving, until kumar notices a rash of boils on freak show's neck.}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(whispering to harold)}
<D>__{eww check out those boils on his neck!}
<A>__{harold nudges him to be quiet. kumar looks back over at freak show and sees that one of the boils is pulsating.}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{oh my god! you gotta look! one of them's actually pulsating!}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{will you shut up? he's right next to me! he can hear you!}
<A>__{kumar sees that a white puss is now oozing from the boil.}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{now there's some sort of puss! it's the most disgusting thing i've ever seen!}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{what's the matter with you? you think that just because you're whispering, he can't hear what you're saying? he's two feet away from us. he can hear this entire conversation. he can hear me talking right now.}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{don't worry, he can't hear anything. not with all that crust in his ear.}
<A>__{harold gives kumar a hard elbow to the stomach. he then looks nervously at freak show, who doesn't seem to have heard a thing. harold seems relieved.}
<C>__{freak show}
<D>__{i heard every word you said.}
<A>__{freak show doesn't say anything else. harold and kumar don't know how to react. they feel really uncomfortable. the fact that nothing happens makes it all the more awkward for them.}
<L>__{exterior freak show's house 1:30 am}
<A>__{harold (with laptop in tow) and kumar stand by their car, as freak show brings out some tools and a new tire from his house, which is run down and in the middle of nowhere.}
<C>__{freak show}
<D>__{now it's gonna take me a little while here, so if you boys like you can go inside, wash up, fuck my wife, have something to drink, watch tv anything you want. mi casa es su casa. just don't do anything jesus wouldn't do.}
<A>__{freak show gives harold a pat on the back and starts changing the tire. kumar and harold look at each other. slowly, they walk towards freak show's house...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{am i deaf or did he just say we can fuck his wife?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{he couldn't have said that.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{but he did! it may have been in mid sentence, but it was still clear as day.}
<A>__{they reach the front door and are about to enter...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{who cares? you've seen freak show. what do you think his wife is gonna look like?}
<L>__{interior freak show's house}
<A>__{harold and kumar walk inside and see the hottest chick of all time (liane) walk out of the kitchen. she is dressed daisy dukes and a tight, skimpy shirt, that accentuates her chest.}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{hi. i'm freak show's wife, liane. would you boys like some pink lemonade?}
<A>__{harold and kumar can't move. they're awestruck.}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{let me go bring in a pitcher.}
<A>__{liane leaves to go into the kitchen. along the way, she turns on a record player, which starts playing a creepy song about jesus christ. harold and kumar look around the house. there are crosses and bible verses on the walls, along with freak show and liane's wedding picture...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{okay. it's official. we've entered the twilight zone.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{dude, liane is fucking hot!}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{she's not ugly.}
<A>__{liane comes in with the pitcher of lemonade. she pours them drinks and hands them the glasses...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{thanks.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so, tell me liane how are things between you and freak show presently?}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{oh, never been better. we love each other very much.}
<A>__{kumar looks disappointed. harold, however, is intrigued...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{can i ask how does a guy...like freak show...end up with a woman like yourself?}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{well, i met him at choir practice `bout four years ago. freak show was very shy back then you know, because of all the hideous boils on his face and neck. but he had the most amazing voice like a baby canary.}
<A>__{harold and kumar look at each other in disbelief "are we talking about the same freakshow?"}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{well, one day after easter service, i told him how much i enjoyed his solo, and he just mustered up some courage and asked me out. the rest is history. and we've been in love ever since.}
<A>__{harold ponders this for a moment. he and kumar begin drinking their lemonade.}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{so you boys gonna fuck me or what?}
<A>__{harold and kumar spit the lemonade out simultaneously. they look at each other in complete shock. kumar turns to harold.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{rock, paper, scissors to see who goes first?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{wait a second what about freak show...and this whole christian thing you guys have going on?}
<C>__{liane}
<P>__{(a little offended)}
<D>__{oh, so just because we're passionate about our lord, you assume we don't know how to have a good time?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{no, i just...}
<A>__{liane starts playing with the knot in her shirt. harold and kumar stare unabashedly. harold looks outside the window, where he sees freak show changing the tire, apparently busy.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{nevermind.}
<P>__{(to kumar, swinging his hand)}
<D>__{okay, rock, paper, scissors...}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{sorry if you boys want me, you gotta do me at the same time.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{come on. give me the double stuff.}
<A>__{harold and kumar look at each other confused.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{i'm not sure we quite understand...}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{i want you both inside me simultaneously.}
<A>__{harold and kumar look at each other again, more confused and kind of disturbed. kumar turns to liane...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{um, are we talking about one hole or two?}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{however you want to do it.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{sorry, no thank you.}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(to harold)}
<D>__{shh! two holes it might not be that bad.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{shotgun anus!}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{forget it! i don't want our balls rubbing against each other. no way!}
<A>__{kumar turns to liane in desperation...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{what about blow jobs?! can we get blow jobs!?}
<C>__{liane}
<D>__{well...okay.}
<P>__{(to harold)}
<D>__{can you help me with this...?}
<A>__{liane walks over to harold, seductively. harold is nervous and doesn't know what he should do. she takes his hand and puts it on the knot in her shirt. harold looks over to kumar, who gives him a reassuring nod. harold then pulls on the cloth, causing the knot to come loose, thereby releasing her shirt. the shirt is now hanging and just barely covering her breasts.}
<C>__{liane}
<P>__{(to harold, re: breasts)}
<D>__{do you want to play with them?}
<A>__{harold looks over to kumar, then back at liane...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{okay, let's do that.}
<A>__{liane takes harold's hands and places them on her breasts. kumar looks on enviously. liane moans in pleasure as harold starts to massage her chest. at that moment, freak show enters the room, holding a particularly threatening tire iron...}

<D>__{hey boys i changed your tire...}
<A>__{freak show sees harold with liane...}
<C>__{freak show}

<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{no problem.}
<C>__{freak show}
<D>__{well, since we're all here, why not make it a foursome?}

<C>__{tarik}
<D>__{i was walking out of a barnes and noble, and a cop stops me. evidently, a black man robbed a store in newark. therefore, since i'm black, it was probably me, right?}
<A>__{harold shrugs his shoulders.}
<C>__{tarik}
<D>__{well that was the logic the cop used. i told him i haven't even been to newark in months. then he pointed a gun at me and told me to stop resisting arrest. i said, "hey, i'm not resisting anything." so he starts beating me with his gun, screaming at me, telling me to stop resisting.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{holy shit. what did you do?}
<C>__{tarik}
<D>__{i kept saying, "i understand that i'm under arrest. please stop beating me." but that didn't work. then another cop showed up. then another. when it was all said and done, it took nine cops to bring me in here.}

<A>__{on the screen, we see a horrible police sketch of "harold" and "kumar" it is basically an asian man in his seventies who looks like confucious; the kumar sketch is an old indian man with a jewel on his forehead, wearing a turban.}

<B>__{harold and kumar breathe a sigh of relief.}
<C>__{teenager}
<P>__{(to harold and kumar)}
<D>__{hey, guys...i got your orders!}
<A>__{harold and kumar run out of the booth.}
<L>__{interior white castle moments later}
<A>__{harold and kumar have put three tables together, on which we see sixty white castle hamburgers each one steaming hot. two good looking guys (jon and hayden) stare at harold and kumar's orders, amazed by their size. they then look at their own orders and realize how worthless they are. harold and kumar are sitting across from one another, looking at the smorgasbord in front of them. harold is about to dig in, but kumar stops him...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{wait...let's do it together.}
<B>__{harold nods. the guys are having a moment. harold and kumar}
<A>__{each pick up a burger. slowly, they bring the burgers to}
<B>__{their mouths...closer...closer...closer... harold and kumar take their first bite. they savor it in their mouths as they chew slowly.}
<A>__{they finish the rest of their first burgers in one bite, and}
<B>__{then quickly eat two more... we see a brief montage of harold and kumar scarfing down the}
<A>__{burgers and fries. they're crying tears of joy!}
<L>__{interior white castle 7:45 am}
<A>__{harold and kumar have finished their meals. they both look full and satisfied. harold takes one last sip of his soda.}

<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{it was the best meal of my life.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{mine too.}
<A>__{the two of them sit there, looking at all the empty containers and wrappers. after a long pause of silence, kumar speaks...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{dude, you know what? i think i may actually go to my interview today.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{seriously?}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{yeah. you know, my whole life i've been afraid being just another nerdy indian guy turned doctor. well, tonight got me thinking...}
<A>__{suddenly, harold notices a convertible parking outside the restaurant it's billy and j.d. with two women.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{there are far worse things in the world than being tagged for having a natural ability in medicine...}
<A>__{harold pretends to be listening to kumar but he is more focused on billy and j.d., who get out of the car with their women and start walking towards the front door.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{like having boils all over your face. or dealing with the shit those black guys had to go through.}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(not paying attention)}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{besides, i have to admit, it felt pretty cool saving that guy's life last night. somewhere between that, getting yelled at by my dad, and seeing neil patrick harris, i realized that i've always wanted to be a doctor i've just been too scared to admit it.}
<A>__{kumar sees that harold isn't paying attention...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{hey, rold, are you listening to me? i'm having a major epiphany here.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{i will be right back...}
<A>__{at that moment, billy and j.d. walk in the restaurant with their women, zoe and tracy, respectively. tracy looks like some bimbo slut that j.d. picked up at a strip club. zoe, on the other hand, has a sweet renee zellweger quality about her. she and billy are the perfect hollywood couple...}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{hey, billy you paying for this or what?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i will be there in a second...}
<A>__{j.d. and tracy check out the menu. billy takes zoe aside whatever their story is, it seems to have reached the "you complete me" moment...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{look, i have to admit something to you. at the start of last night, all i really cared about was getting some. but then i met you, zoe. you're so different from all the other women i've ever met. you're smart, funny, artistic. i guess what i'm trying to say is...}
<C>__{harold }
<D>__{what the fuck is going on here?}
<A>__{billy turns around and sees harold...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{harold? what are you...?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{never mind me. what are you doing here? i thought you and j.d. were busy all night with "clients." isn't that why i had to do your work?}
<A>__{j.d. hears the commotion and turns around...}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{hey! what the hell is going on here?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{back off, cock boy! what i have to say to him goes double for you!}
<A>__{kumar sees what's going on he can't believe it.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{cock boy? i'm sorry, but did you just call me "cock boy?"}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{yeah, you know i did. you're just stalling because you're not quick enough to think of a comeback.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{oh, i'm not quick enough?}
<P>__{(to billy)}
<D>__{he thinks i'm not quick enough.}
<P>__{(to harold)}
<D>__{well, i got news for you...}
<P>__{(long beat, thinking)}
<D>__{i am quick enough...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{...cock boy!}
<A>__{j.d. is embarrassed. billy tries to placate the situation.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{listen harry...}
<C>__{j.d.}
<P>__{(to billy)}
<D>__{don't even bother with him. we'll just tell berenson later...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{tell him what? that i'm your work horse! that you guys think you can just party all weekend and leave all your work to the quiet asian guy in your office! huh?}
<A>__{j.d. is stunned. now he's a little nervous.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{no, no you don't understand...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{no, you don't understand. i'm not doing your work anymore.}
<C>__{harold }
<D>__{and if either one of you douchebags ever tries to pull this shit again, i will go to berenson and tell him what's really going on.}
<A>__{harold notices traci and zoe listening...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{and i will tell everyone in the office how you both caught gonorrhea from that whore.}
<A>__{traci and zoe hear this and are freaked out. they slowly back away from billy and j.d....}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{now, if you'll excuse me, i have to get going. see you on monday.}
<A>__{harold leaves the restaurant. kumar follows. billy and j.d. are left embarrassed and in shock.}

<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{way to go, rold! where the hell did that come from?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{i don't know. eating those delicious burgers made me feel like a new man. now i'm actually looking forward to work this week.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{no shit! i guess you're worthwhile after all.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{i'm not worthless.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{so those dudes have gonorrhea?}

<C>__{luis}
<D>__{what do you want?}

<P>__{(to harold, laughing)}
<D>__{this girl is crazy, man.}
<C>__{luis }
<D>__{she seemed so sweet at first, but it turns out she's into some pretty freaky shit. she even did this thing where she took a lollipop and shoved it...}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(grossed out depressed)}
<D>__{look, i really don't need to hear it. i guess i just made a mistake. sorry for interrupting you guys...}
<A>__{harold starts to walk away, almost crying. sad, depressing music begins to play. kumar feels sorry for his friend. just then, luis leans his head out the door...}
<C>__{luis}
<D>__{hey if you're looking for maria, she left for europe this morning.}
<A>__{harold quickly turns around and runs back over.}
<C>__{harold}

<C>__{luis}
<D>__{hey, i will be there in a second, baby. do me a favor make me that omelette you were talking about. you know, with the sun dried tomatoes.}
