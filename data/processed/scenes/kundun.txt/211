<L>__{exterior border day}
<A>__{a sick and tired tenzin gyatso makes the last leg of his trip on the back of a black yak. before him, through the light rain, we see a small bamboo arch erected in the middle of nowhere. six indian ghurkas, wearing floppy, jungle hats and heavy, british boots, stand at attention. the dalai lama, on his black yak, passes under this babboo gateway as the indian soldiers raise their guns in salute. an indian soldier goes to the yak and helps the sick man from his mount. tenzin gyatso stands, barely able to hold himself on his feet. his hand rests on the yak's back. the indian soldier steps closer and, knowing he is breaking protocol, he whispers:}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{with all respect, may i ask? who are you?}
<A>__{the young man smiles at the soldier a man who looks like the lead soldier come alive.}
<C>__{tenzin gyatso}
<D>__{what you see before you is a man. a simple monk.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{are you the lord buddha?}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{tenzin gyatso}
<D>__{i think i am a reflection, like the moon, on water. when you see me, and i try to be a good man, see yourself}
