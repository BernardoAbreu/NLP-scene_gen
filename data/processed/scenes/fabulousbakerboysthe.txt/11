<D>__{make sure you lock.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{unless you count the elderly gentleman picking roses three houses down, there would not appear to be a wealth of potential car thieves in the immediate vicinity. but it's not jack's car, so he doesn't press the pointerior}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{frank}

<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{john. it's good to see you.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(uncomfortable; balancing cake box)}
<D>__{good to see you, ma.}

<D>__{keep her busy, will ya? i have to set a few things up.}
<A>__{frank disappears, leaving jack alone on the porch with the bakery box. jack shakes his head, wondering how he's going to make it through the afternoon, then enters the house.}
