<D>__{i'm sorry, i didn't mean to ...}
<C>__{cora}
<D>__{her nerves are shattered. she's trying to be brave.}
<A>__{there's a lot going on under cora's surface. we don't know what it is, but it's disconcerting.}

<P>__{(softens)}

<D>__{duncan ...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{duncan, i promised you an answer. you have complimented me with your persistence and patience ... but the decision i've come to is i'd rather make the gravest of mistakes than surrender my own judgment.}
<A>__{heyward is stunned.}
<C>__{cora}
<D>__{and it's been unfair to you, while i search myself for feelings, which, if they were there and as strong as they ought to be, would've made themselves known long ago ...}
<P>__{(pause)}

<C>__{heyward}
<D>__{i see ...}
<C>__{cora}
<D>__{i am sorry, duncan ...}
<A>__{heyward nods. he's speechless. he's errect as he leaves the room. close: cora the tension rushes out of her and she shudders and leans against the quarter timbered walls for support. then she collects the linen and starts out.}
