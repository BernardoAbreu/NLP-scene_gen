<A>__{harvey sits on a table in his t shirt and underwear. a doctor unwraps a tongue depressor. harvey's voice is hoarse, raspy and barely audible. it sounds like it hurts for him to talk. yet, he can't stop ranting.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{doc, you gotta help me. my old lady's dumping me 'cause i can't talk. she says i'm a social embarrassment. now that she's got her phd, she's some hot shit academic star an' i'm nuthin' but a file clerk with nothin' ta say an' no voice ta say it. but me bein' a file clerk was fine when i wrote the damn check for her tuition doctor #1 harvey, stop talking please, and open wide.}
<A>__{he points the tongue depressor at harvey's mouth but he just keeps on going.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{i just don't get it... we were doin' okay for a while. then we took that stupid belated honeymoon. i started losin' my voice on the plane. can you believe that... on the plane, doc? doctor #1 bad timing, i guess. now please say "ah," mr. pekar.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{"ahhh."}
<P>__{(without missing a beat)}
<D>__{"ahhh" ruined the trip. i got crazy, started to worry my voice would never come back. i mean, my wife didn't know me so long before we got hitched. what if she totally forgets what i'm like? man, it's torture doctor #1 shhh...}
<A>__{the doctor shines a penlight into harvey's mouth and looks around.}
<D>__{doctor #1 uh huh.}
<A>__{he raises an eyebrow. harvey catches this. hypochondria overtakes him.}
<C>__{harvey}
<P>__{(the penlight in his mouth)}
<D>__{what? is it bad, doc?}
<A>__{the doctor removes the penlight.}
<D>__{doctor #1 it's not good.}
<A>__{harvey jumps off the table.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{it's cancer? first i got marital problems and now yer tellin' me i got throat cancer? omigod... doctor #1 harvey, calm down. it's not cancer. you have a nodule on your vocal chords. probably from screaming and yelling too much. and if you don't stop talking and give it a rest, you're gonna lose your voice completely.}
<A>__{relieved, harvey calms down. he nods, agreeing to be good.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{whew... okay, okay. but fer how long? doctor #1 a few months.}
<C>__{harvey}
<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{months!!}
<A>__{suddenly harvey's voice cracks under his effort to raise it. he sheepishly grabs his throat.}
<D>__{doctor #1 see? more of that and you'll do permanent damage. now go home, keep your mouth shut, and hopefully we won't have to operate.}
<A>__{operate? harvey gets nervous again. the doctor throws him his clothing.}
