<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{all you have to do is have faith. ask any of my patients.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{what about your patients in birkenau...?}
<A>__{vogel looks up in shock. rachel grabs a fistful of his hair and pulls his head to one side. with her other hand she jams the needle into the side of his neck, and begins to depress the syringe. vogel gives a grunt of surprise, opens his mouth to speak but no sound comes. he grabs vaguely for rachel's throat with one hand, struggles with the needle with his other, eyes dull with fury, fighting the drug racing through him. rachel fights to hold him, bucking on the chair, pinned beneath his weight, struggling for breath... weakening, vogel manages to pull the needle free and it drops to the floor...}
<B>__{insert of syringe}
<A>__{...which we see still contains some fluid. a rope of spittle drools from vogel's contorted mouth onto her face. then his eyelids flutter and close and he collapses onto her. rachel pulls his hand from her throat, gasps for air. finally she pushes him to the ground. she leaps up and deliberately knocks the tray of medical instruments to the floor.}
