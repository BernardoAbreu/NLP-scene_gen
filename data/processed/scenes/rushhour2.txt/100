<A>__{whoosh! another terra cotta fighting stick is in half in carter's hands.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{will you stop?!?!}
<P>__{(picks up cocktail umbrella)}
<D>__{what am i supposed to fight you with?}
<A>__{no more toying. hu li charges carter, who grabs a roulette wheel as a makeshift shield. she slices it in half! he's got nowhere to hide. she jabs him with the sword. carter screams. falls back against the table, clutching his chest. hu li windmills, kicking a terra cotta soldier on top of carter, but thwack! the double bladed bamboo pole in its hand ricochets back and she is pierced through the shoulder with the blade. staring at carter in stunned disbelief, she drops to her knees. carter walks toward her, considers his options, then kicks her in the head, knocking her out.}
<C>__{carter }
<D>__{when are you people gonna learn? don't mess with the brothas!}
<A>__{weak in the knees, carter looks to the sound on his chest. he reaches through the slice in his jacket. instead of a hand covered in blood, it comes out with a thick wad of cash!}
<C>__{carter }
<D>__{thank you, benjamin!}
<A>__{carter runs for the elevator.}
<D>__{interior penthouse suite continuous}
<A>__{lee is walking toward ricky tan, the two men circling reign's body.}
<C>__{ricky tan}
<D>__{you're just like your father, lee. all these years hiding behind his badge. i wanted to help him, to share with him, but he was too afraid of change. when you think about it, i didn't really kill him. i just put him out of his misery.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{put the plates down. it's over.}
<C>__{ricky tan}
<D>__{i don't think it's over. there are casinos all over this country. let me make you a rich man, lee. don't make the same mistake he did.}
<A>__{ricky glances at the gun in reign's belt.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{if you reach for that gun, i'm going to kill you.}
<C>__{ricky tan}
<D>__{don't you remember? i'm already dead.}
<A>__{ricky makes a play for the gun, but lee is much too fast, taking the gun and pushing ricky against the wall just as carter bursts in the room.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{hey, ricky, how's it going man? what's up, lee?}
<A>__{lee has the gun pressed to tan's head. we've never seen him like this before.}
<C>__{ricky tan}
<D>__{would you like me to tell you how your father died?}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{lee, you okay?}
<A>__{lee doesn't respond. he keeps an eye on ricky.}
<C>__{ricky tan}
<D>__{he never begged for his life. or tried to make a deal. all that he asked me, just seconds before i pulled the trigger, was that i promise not to kill you.}
<A>__{lee's finger is on the trigger he wants to pull the trigger but can't.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{lee, wait a second. it's not worth it, man. he's making you do this.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{it's worth it to me.}
<C>__{ricky tan}
<D>__{do you have it in you, lee? or are you gonna spend the rest of your life hiding like your father?}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{c'mon, lee. he's going to jail. you won, now just put the gun down.}
<A>__{lee is trying to pull the trigger, but he can't.}
<C>__{ricky tan}
<D>__{that's what i thought.}
<A>__{tan takes the black bag and swings it toward lee the plates hit him across the face and knock him down.}
<B>__{the gun is loose}
<A>__{tan reaches for it and is about to pull the trigger when: lee and carter come flying at him together. both kicking him}
<B>__{square in the chest.}
<A>__{tan falls back, smashing through the window. lee tries to grab tan's hand, their fingers touch for a split second. but tan pulls his hand away and falls 20 stories to the street below.}
