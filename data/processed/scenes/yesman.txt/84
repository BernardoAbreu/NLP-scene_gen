<D>__{what's with the kitten?}
<A>__{pull back to reveal a kitten on peter's desk.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i just adopted her. if you're interested, they're giving them away in front of petco.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i don't want a kitten.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{neither did i.}
<C>__{peter's secretary}
<D>__{andy solomon on line two.}
<A>__{peter picks up the phone.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{hey, asshole, we're not talking until you sign that goddamn contract.}
<A>__{peter hangs up.}
<C>__{peter }
<P>__{(totally normal)}
<D>__{i spoke to kath. i hear you met her boyfriend, seb.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{seems like a nice guy.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{she was upset you went on her date.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{he asked me to join them.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i think you're taking this too far.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i have no choice. i'm a yes man. i must say yes. if seb asks me to join them on their date, i must. if some dude asks me for a loan i have to give it to them even if it's clearly never going to be paid back. if a guy asks me into his bedroom, i must hook up with him.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{you hooked up with a dude?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{it's like hooking up with a strong woman. i honestly don't see what the big deal is.}
<P>__{(back on his yes rant)}
<D>__{i am guided by yes. yes has become my superpower. and let me tell, yes is turning out to be a pretty sweet deal. now if you'll excuse me i'm late for korean class.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{you hate korean food.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{that's no reason to write off an entire, vibrant culture. see you later, buddy.}
<A>__{carl heads off, the kitten under his arm.}
