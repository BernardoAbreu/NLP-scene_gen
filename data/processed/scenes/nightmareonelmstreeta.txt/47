<A>__{nancy wheels and sees the bag, prone on the tiles at the far end of the hall, at the end of a long snail's trail of slime. a pale hand thrusts out of it. a moment later, as if pulled by invisible gravity, the bag slides out of sight into an intersecting corridor.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{tina!}
<A>__{nancy starts running for it. angle at the corner as nancy races blindly around the turn and smashes straight into a body lunging at her from the opposite direction! both go down. angle at the floor. a dazed freshman hallguard cranks herself up on one elbow. she wears a plastic plaque on her red and yellow sweater that reads 'hall guard'. her nose is bleeding from the impact.}
<C>__{hallguard}
<D>__{y you're not supposed to run. w where's your pass you got a pass?}
<A>__{nancy leaps up }
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{screw your stupid pass!}
<A>__{she turns sees the body bag halfway down this darker, narrower hall, upright again. but just as she sees it, it tips and pitches headlong through a doorway like some godawful rotten tree finally timbering down. she can hear the sickening crunching of it falling down a long flight of stairs. nancy runs for it again. the hallguard staggers up foreground, bleeding profusely from her eyes and ears.}
<C>__{hallguard}
<D>__{hey, no running in the halls!}
<A>__{the hallguard raises her hand and we see it's tipped with long metal spikes. reverse angle at the door as nancy runs up. nancy turns to check out the hallguard. she's vanished. nancy turns and looks down through the open door. the music sweeps through a strange, brooding movement of strings, mounting towards the nightmare}
