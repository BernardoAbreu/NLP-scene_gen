<L>__{interior scimitar brig night}
<A>__{picard stands in the reman brig. his communicator pin has been removed. beyond the security force field a ghoulish medical apparatus is being prepared. a metal chair with laser scalpels, iv tubes and hyposprays connected to it. reman doctors work over the mysterious chair. shinzon enters with the b 9 following. shinzon stands on the other side of the force field. picard notices something immediately. tiny veins are now visible on shinzon's face; the faintest sign of an intricate spider web pattern of pale blue veins.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{hello, jean luc.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{why am i here?}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{i was lonely...}
<P>__{(he realizes picard is}
<D>__{staring at the veins on}
<P>__{his face)}
<D>__{perhaps i'm not aging as well as you did.}
<A>__{he nods to a guard. the guard deactivates the force field. a reman doctor enters and raises a hypospray toward picard.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(resists)}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{i need a sample of your blood. what do your borg friends say? resistance is futile.}
<P>__{(maniacal laugh)}
<A>__{the doctor takes a quick sample of picard's blood as picard glances to the b 9.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{yes. the bait you couldn't refuse. i learned there might be an existing prototype from a cardassian historian, then went to a great deal of trouble to find it and scatter it about on kolarus iii. i knew it would pique your curiosity and conveniently make the enterprise the closest ship to romulus when i contacted starfleet.}
<A>__{the reman doctor leaves the cell. the force field is reactivated. the doctor goes to the mysterious medical apparatus and analyzes picard's blood. as:}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{all of this so you could capture me?}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{don't be so vain. after we found it, we made a few modifications. an extra memory port, a hidden transponder. perhaps your eyes will be a bit less confident when you learn i've gained access to starfleet's communications protocols. i now know the location of your entire fleet...}
<P>__{(to b 9)}
<D>__{... you may go. b 9 where?}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{out of my sight.}
<A>__{the b 9 obediently leaves the room as:}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{maybe i will train it to do little tricks for me like your robot does. or maybe i will snap its ugly head off.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{what's this all about?}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{it's about destiny, picard. about a reman outcast who }
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{you're not reman.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{and i'm not quite human. so what am i? what do you see?}
<P>__{(he peers at picard deeply)}
<D>__{do you see a life you might have led? lost youth never to be recaptured?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i see a young man trying desperately to deny who he is.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{i see an old man, set in his ways, afraid to live without a uniform to prop him up and a starfleet regulation to tell him what to do. i see the man i will never be.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i won't defend my life to you.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{my life is meaningless as long as you're alive. what am i while you exist? a shadow? an enigma?}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(stern)}
<D>__{if your issues are with me... this has nothing to do with my ship and nothing to do with the federation.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{oh, but it does. we will no longer bow like slaves before anyone. not the romulans and not your mighty federation. we're a race bred for war. for conquest.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{think about what you're doing, shinzon. are you ready to plunge the entire quadrant into war to satisfy your own personal demons?}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{it amazes me how little you know yourself.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i'm incapable of such an act, and so are you.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{i think the facts speak for themselves. the same noble picard blood runs in our veins. had you lived my life, you'd be doing exactly as i am. look in the mirror, and see yourself.}
<A>__{shinzon looks at him deeply.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{consider that, captain. i can think of no greater torment for you.}
<A>__{he turns to go.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{it's a mirror for you as well...}
<A>__{shinzon turns back to him. a beat. picard gazes at him evenly. picard's probing gaze makes shinzon a bit uneasy. he glances to the ghoulish medical preparations.}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{not for long, captain.}
<P>__{(back to picard)}
<D>__{i'm afraid you won't survive to witness the victory of the echo over the voice.}
<A>__{he goes.}
