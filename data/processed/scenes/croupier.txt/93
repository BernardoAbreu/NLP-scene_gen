<C>__{giles}
<D>__{hey. i've got an idea. why don't we...}
<C>__{fiona}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{no! no stripping.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{right. we're not having that again!}
<P>__{(glances at jack)}
<D>__{although...}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{i will stick to bluffing. that's what i'm best at.}
<A>__{jani smiles, says nothing. jack slides the pack to jani. she looks up at him and cuts the cards. jack deals the cards deftly. the five players pick up their cards. before each player calls we hear jack's voice. in the end he correctly predicts their call. is it telepathy? or something else?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{i will stick.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{two cards.}
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{one card.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{oh i don't know...er...two cards.}
<C>__{jani}
<D>__{three cards.}
<A>__{the players examine their hands. the women are pleased. the men say nothing. jani puts her cards together. the betting begins. no one drops out. the raising goes round three times.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{that's it. i haven't got any more cash.}
<A>__{the betting comes to an end. jack watches as they turn their hands over. gordon turns over a straight.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{beat that.}
<A>__{chloe turns over a flush.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{ha. ha. ha.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{fiona turns over a full house.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{not so fast, darling.}
<C>__{gordon}
<P>__{(disbelieving)}
<D>__{hang on, chaps. that's impossible!}
<A>__{giles turns over four of a kind.}
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{how's about that for impossible.}
<A>__{laughter, cries of amazement.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<A>__{jack is impassive. they all look to jani, who turns over, one card at a time, a straight flush.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{wow. what are the odds for this happening?}
<A>__{more laughter, cries of amazement.}
<C>__{fiona}
<D>__{thousands to one.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{42,300,000 to 1.}
<C>__{jani}
<D>__{approximately.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{i could've won if i'd been able to bluff.}
<A>__{jani leans forward and takes the pot. giles looks at jack, then at jani.}
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{i get it.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{get what?}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{are you accusing me of cheating?}
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{good god, no. but with skill like that, what do you want a job for? you don't need to work.}
