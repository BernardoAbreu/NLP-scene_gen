<L>__{interior pub later}
<A>__{after the show, the pub now fairly empty, solomon, hamilton and brown sit down to eat. hamilton and brown drink, but again solomon abstains. though solomon remains cool, hamilton and brown put up a great show of being disappointed as hamilton counts out what little money was collected.}
<C>__{hamilton}
<D>__{not an additional tip from a one of them. they expect to be entertained for nothing.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{and not satisfied a bit despite giving them more than what they paid for.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{it's the national mood. there's too much grief to make room for frivolity.}
<C>__{hamilton}
<D>__{my sincerest apologies, solomon. you were promised opportunity, and you were given none.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{the opportunity is with the circus. a two man show poorly promoted, what were we to expect? but the circus bills itself.}
<C>__{hamilton}
<D>__{true.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{i have told you of the circus with which we are connected. creatures from the darkest of africa. acrobats from the orient who }
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{you have described it, yes.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{yes. we need to return immediately to washington. solomon...i believe us familiar enough now, but forgive me if i am bold...would you consider making the trip with us?}
<A>__{solomon gives a bit of a laugh at the idea.}
<C>__{hamilton}
<D>__{entertaining at pubs and inns has it's place, but a man of your skills deserves better.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{hear, hear.}
<C>__{hamilton}
<D>__{and more importantly you would build your own name and following. the circus tends to attract those with the highest of reputations. an introduction here and there could amount to a lifetime of reward. now would be the time. with your family away, an opportunity presents itself.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{said as fellow artists as well as businessmen. well worth the effort at least.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{you present a flattering representation. as my family will be traveling back shortly, perhaps i might commit only to one trial engagement.}
<C>__{hamilton}
<D>__{oh, very good, sir. very good. i cannot recall being so excited.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{there is a practical concern. if you are to continue on with us you should obtain your free papers.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{not necessary.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{here in new york, no. but we will be entering slave states and as a matter of precaution... it's to all our benefit we should not have to come to account for your well being.}
<C>__{hamilton}
<D>__{six shillings worth of effort could well save much trouble later.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{we'll go to the customs house in the morning, then travel on. good business all around.}
