<A>__{motionless and monumental, six buffalo stand like stat ues in the grass. suddenly they swing their shaggy heads to watch something pass. in the dark silence batty stops to look at the curious beasts and then moves soundlessly towards the mansion.}

<D>__{oh!}
<A>__{basically an avian invention, it has wings and plumage, the head of an eagle, the body of a lion and weighs no more than eight pounds. it cranes its neck and testing its balance, stands on one leg and then hops to the edge of the table and into the air. the littlest tot claps her hands as the griffon beats its wings rapidly and rises towards the ceiling. turn ing in a forty five degree, it suddenly drops into a dive. delighted, the children shriek and scream as the griffon swoops over their crouching heads and sails the length of the hall its silhouette flickering briefly over the ancestral portraits of the tyrell clan. reaching the end of the room, it banks sharply and flies back towards the table, cups its wings, spreads its tail and comes in for an awkward landing. they're laughing and clapping as it waddles down the table and knocks over a glass and stops in front of ian.}
