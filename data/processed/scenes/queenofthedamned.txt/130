<D>__{they believed in nothing, now they are nothing. but you and i will change all that. we will give the world something to believe in again.}
<A>__{akasha smiles, raises her hand, suddenly slices her wrist with a knife. lestat stares at her dripping blood. she crosses to him, her eyes locked on his. she lifts her wrist, drips her blood into lestat's mouth. lestat's eyes glaze over again. he smiles, feeds hungrily, lost again. akasha smiles.}
