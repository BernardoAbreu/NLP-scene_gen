<L>__{interior sampan}
<A>__{rambo and brewer allow themselves to exhale.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{how you doing, brewer?}
<C>__{brewer}
<P>__{(shaken)}
<D>__{i need a vacation.}
<L>__{exterior rain forest prison camp night}
<A>__{with co leading, rambo and brewer move furtively along a tortuous trail. it has rained recently and the forest is alive with glistening reflections, dripping water. the trail winds up a steep embankment. as they reach the top of the rise, camera booms up over the shoulder of the embankment to reveal a compound beyond, dark except for moonlight.}
<B>__{rambo}
<A>__{watches from concealment in the foliage. he is invisible with his camo makeup except for darting eyes. rambo's pov looking between the leaves, scanning the prison camp. two shabby wooden guard towers stand at diagonally opposite corners of the compound. there is a simple fence of barbed wire on wooden posts enclosing the area and a main gate with a sentry box. three long wooden barracks form a u, filling most of the compound. the place seems deserted.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{check the tower with your scope.}
<A>__{brewer raises the rifle, sighting through the massive starlight scope. brewer's pov telephoto the image is bright, lurid... black and white with a greenish cast. like contrasty daylight. he pans up the tower. a russian made p.k. 7.62mm machine gun sits pointing skyward. the tower seems unoccupied.}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{nobody home. wait a minute! cigarette.}
<A>__{a brief glow of light illuminates the face of a tower guard hidden in shadows.}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{what's he here for?}
<A>__{nearby, another guard saunters out of the forest dressed in nva regular private's uniform with the sleeves rolled up casually. his ak 47 is slung over his shoulder.}
<B>__{brewer}
<A>__{slips the telescopic microphone out of his rucksack and clamps it to the side of his scope. he slips on a pair of small earphones and pans the rifle scope mike over the nearest barracks unit.}
<C>__{brewer}
<P>__{(intently)}
<D>__{snoring. five, six guys. mumbling... vietnamese. somebody talking in his sleep. a toilet flushing.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{guard barracks. take some shots.}
<A>__{brewer locks a 35mm slr camera to an adapter on the starlight scope. he starts clicking off some shots. brewer then scans the long hut across the compound.}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{breathing. moaning.}
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{he whips off the earphones in pain as a low scream echoes across the camp. it fades into a delirious moaning. stops.}
<C>__{rambo}
<P>__{(nodding grimly)}
<D>__{bad dreams. prisoner's barracks. shoot some.}
<A>__{brewer clicks away. a tiny engine whining draws their attention to the main gate where a young woman on a lambretta scooter pulls up to the sentry shack. brewer zeros on her as she greets the gate guards.}
<C>__{co}
<D>__{cyclo girl whore from village. business slow there.}
<A>__{rambo takes the earphones, listening to the girl's distant chattering.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{she's making him a pretty good deal.}
<A>__{apparently the guard agrees because he opens the gate and the girl slips inside.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{what's that? by the far tower.}
<A>__{brewer pans to the distant shape.}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{it's a guy in a cage.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{american?}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{can't tell. pretty tall. he's real scrunched up in that thing.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{let me see.}
<A>__{rambo's pov through scope the image is of an emaciated figure slumped in a bamboo cage. the man's skin is ghostly white. he seems almost a living skeleton, dressed only in ragged shorts. his wrists are clamped in a wooden stock and blood runs down his arms from the abraded sores. the image zooms closer, moves onto his face. tight. though gaunt and filthy, he is clearly caucasian.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{roundeye.}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{alright. home run.}
<C>__{rambo}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{torture cage. can't stand... can't sit... for days. sometimes weeks.}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{bastards. let's get some shots.}
<B>__{on rambo}
<A>__{moving slowly in as he hands the kluge back to brewer.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{that guy's not going to make it.}
<C>__{brewer }
<D>__{nothing we can do, man.}
<A>__{rambo decides in that moment.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{i'm getting him out.}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{what? are you crazy? we're supposed to take pictures and split. you're gonna blow the whole program.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{you never been in one of those things.}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{i suppose you have...}
<A>__{rambo holds his wrists up, right under brewer's nose... showing the chafing scars.}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{it's orders! you remember... when they tell you to do something and then you do it. john wayne is dead, man.}
<C>__{rambo}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{you take pictures and split. i'm going in.}
<A>__{brewer throws down his rifle. he's apoplectic. he can barely form words.}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{fuck it. fuck it. aw... ke rist.}
<A>__{then a slow grin spreads.}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{how we gonna do it?}
