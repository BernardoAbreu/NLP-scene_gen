<L>__{interior finch's office the nose}
<A>__{finch sits at his desk, staring into the silence of his notepad. he has doodled a little "v" with a circle around it. he looks up as dominic enters, holding up a portable cassette player.}
<C>__{dominic}
<D>__{sorry it took so long. the boys had a devil of a time trying to filter out the background noise.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{background noise?}
<C>__{dominic}
<D>__{the perpetrator apparently turned on the bishop's stereo. subsequently, a great deal of the tape is useless.}
<A>__{he hands the player to finch.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{what music did he play?}
<C>__{dominic}
<D>__{beethoven. the fifth, i believe.}
<A>__{finch smiles.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{da, da, da, dum. that's code. morse code.}
<C>__{dominic}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{for the letter "v".}
<A>__{finch punches "play". over the small speaker, we sear evey protesting to v, then run. he stops it.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{anything on the girl yet?}
<C>__{dominic}
<D>__{no. the agency said somebody claiming to be lilliman's valet canceled his sunday appointment.}
<A>__{finch starts it again and this time the tape is very fuzzy.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{dominic}
<D>__{23rd psalm.}
<A>__{we recognize some of the words though muted and crackly.}
<C>__{tape }
<D>__{though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death...}
<C>__{dominic}
<D>__{it goes on like that for a while. fairly incoherent except we could make out a few words in this part. transubstantiation.}
<A>__{finch nods, understanding.}
<C>__{dominic}
<D>__{that miracle business when the wafer transform into the body of christ.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{he made him eat a host.}
<C>__{dominic}
<D>__{yes, listen to this part.}
<A>__{the tape becomes somewhat clearer as the music rests.}
<C>__{tape }
<D>__{... and at the moment this enters your mouth it becomes the flesh of the savior? yes... please... and whatever it is made of now it will become the body of christ? yes... yes...}
<A>__{they eye each other.}
<C>__{tape }
<D>__{i want you to swallow it.}
<C>__{dominic}
<D>__{there's a couple of funny human noises...}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{and then just beethoven's fifth.}
<A>__{he shuts off the tape.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{we have got the initial path report back. the host was full of cyanide.}
<A>__{finch picks up the bag with the violet carson.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{and do you know what?}
<A>__{he rises, sliding into his jacket.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{when it reached his abdomen, it was still cyanide.}
