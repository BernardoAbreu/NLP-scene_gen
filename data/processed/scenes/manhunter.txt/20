<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior atlanta detective bureau moving with graham, crawford}
<A>__{+ springfield day down the corridor.}
<C>__{springfield}
<D>__{our people swear he wore surgeons' gloves the whole time. they dusted everything.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{the report didn't mention nails and eyes.}
<C>__{springfield}
<D>__{why do you think he took his gloves off?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{mrs. leeds was a good looking woman. i'd want to touch her skin in an intimate situation, wouldn't you?}
<C>__{springfield}
<P>__{(sudden distaste)}
<D>__{'intimate? !"}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{yes. 'intimate.' they had privacy.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{everybody else was dead.}
<A>__{springfield looks at graham. springfield needs answers, not voodoo. then they enter the squad room. twenty detectives sit at desks. graham and crawford move to the back of the class.}
<C>__{springfield}
<D>__{all right. house to house interviews will be extended four additional blocks. r & i has loaned us two clerks to help cross matching airline reservations between birmingham last month and between atlanta now.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{dr. princi.}
<A>__{dr. dominique princi, chief medical examiner for fulton county, walks to the front and stands under a drawing of teeth. he hold's up a dental cast.}
<C>__{dr. princi}
<D>__{this is what the subject's teeth look like. the smithsonian in washington reconstructed them from the impressions we took of bite marks off the leeds woman here and off the jacobi woman last month in birmingham.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{as you can see, he has pegged lateral incisors the teeth here and here.}
<A>__{the teeth look like teeth from a small bear.}
<C>__{springfield}
<D>__{investigator graham has worked this kind of thing before. can you add anything?}
<A>__{graham doesn't like talking in public. he stutters and starts to say something...}
<C>__{springfield}
<D>__{can't hear you. can you come up to the front?}
<A>__{graham walks to the front of the room.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{he may have a history of biting barroom fights or child abuse.}
<C>__{springfield}
<D>__{he only bit women so far, right?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{that's all we know about.}
<C>__{graham }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{most of the time in sex assaults the bite mark has a livid spot in the center. a suck mark. these don't. so, for him, biting may be a fighting pattern as much as sexual behavior.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you could try emergency room personnel, treatment for bite wounds. i know that's pretty thin...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he bites a lot.}
<C>__{springfield}
<D>__{what's average?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{sex murder: three. he likes to bite. six bad ones in mrs. leeds. eight in mrs. jacobi...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{... that's all i have.}
<A>__{graham sits down.}
<C>__{springfield}
<D>__{all right. vice and narcotics, take the k y cowboys and the leather bars. marcus and whitman heads up at the funeral. the rest of you, your assignments are on the sheet. let's go.}
<A>__{they start to rise. springfield remembers.}
<C>__{springfield}
<D>__{one more thing: i've heard officers referring to the killer as the 'tooth fairy.}
<P>__{(on laughter)}
<D>__{yeah, yeah, but i don't want to hear that in public or internal memoranda. that's it.}
<A>__{detectives file out. crawford and graham remain. springfield crosses to them and they wait for all the other detectives to leave.}
<C>__{springfield}
<P>__{(to crawford)}
<D>__{we don't have shit, and we know it.}
<A>__{dr. princi joins them.}
<C>__{springfield}
<P>__{(to graham)}
<D>__{the commissioner was saying you were the one that caught dr. lecter three years ago.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he killed nine people, didn't he?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{nine that we know of. two didn't die.}
<C>__{springfield}
<D>__{what happened to them?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{one's on the respirator at a hospital in baltimore. the other is in a private mental hospital in denver.}
<C>__{springfield}
<D>__{what did the psychologists say was wrong with lecter?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{psychologists call him a sociopath. they don't know what else to call him.}
<C>__{springfield}
<D>__{what would you call him?}
<A>__{graham doesn't answer.}
<C>__{springfield}
<D>__{to yourself...}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i call him a monster.}
<C>__{springfield}
<D>__{i understand he cut you pretty good...}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(cold right turn>}
<D>__{what about the dog?}
<C>__{springfield}
<D>__{it's at the vet's. the kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{was the dog wearing a collar with the leeds' name on it?}
<C>__{springfield}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{did the jacobis in birmingham have a dog?}
<C>__{crawford}
<P>__{(alert)}
<D>__{a cat. we found a litter box downstairs but not the cat. neighbors are watching for it.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{why don't you get birmingham p.d. a methane probe out of d.c. and have them cover the backyard... maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it.}
<A>__{crawford starts to move. the phone rings. springfield answers.}
<C>__{springfield}
<D>__{yeah?}
<P>__{(waits)}
<A>__{lemme put you on the speaker phone.}
<C>__{jimmie price }
<D>__{who am i talking to?}
<C>__{crawiiord}
<D>__{jimmie, it's me, jack crawford, and you got will graham here.}
<C>__{jimmie price }
<D>__{i got a partial with a tented arch that's probably a thumb print and a fragment of a palm.}
<A>__{springfield reacts.}
<C>__{jimmie price }
<D>__{came off the oldest kid's left eye. it stood out against an eight ball hemorrhage from the gunshot wound.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{can you make an identification off it?}
<C>__{jimmie price }
<D>__{don't know. the palm came off the nail of mrs. leeds' left big toe. i want to work these up in my own darkroom. i will fax the prints down to you this afternoon.}
<A>__{hangs up.}
<B>__{springfield}
<A>__{thought graham was ridiculous. now his expression is very changed.}
<B>__{graham}
<A>__{senses springfield's staring at him. graham's face is blank. he leaves. springfield shaking crawford's hand watches graham all the way to the door.}
