<A>__{camera follows noah through a maze of tight corners and stairwells into a single, massive hold converted into a drug processing lab. huge, bakery sized mixing bowls chug on one side of the room while lab workers form the doughy, cut heroin into pizza sized forms, and shovel them into tractor ovens on the other side of the room. when the pies come out, more lab assistants re form the pies into keys.}
