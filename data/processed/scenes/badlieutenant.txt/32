<L>__{ext: night a city hospital parking lot}
<A>__{lt pulls up. parks near a group of other cops, waiting by their cars. hospital fauna passes by in the background: doctors, nurses, patients in all stages of recovery or relapse. the hospital itself rises in the background. it looks like a prison. lt leaves his car, heads for the group of cops. he joins them, sits down on the hood of a nearby car. the cops are all drinking heavily. present are the bet cop, and several other familiar cops from previous scenes.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{first cop}
<D>__{they raped a nun and tore up the church they even took a crap on the altar. up in spanish harlem.}
<C>__{second cop}
<D>__{she was only seventeen...}
<A>__{a cop opens his trunk he has a bar inside. the cops, including lt, respond enthusiastically. drink up.}
<C>__{first cop}
<D>__{who the fuck could do this?!}
<C>__{old irish cop}
<D>__{the young nun's just a kid from ireland. imagine having to come here to have that happen!}
<C>__{second cop}
<D>__{jesus... what's she gonna tell her mother?}
<C>__{old irish cop}
<D>__{i'm gonna kill those motherfuckers.}
<A>__{the cops keep drinking. all of them lounging around on or beside the cars. lt watches quietly, taking it all in. as if following the motto: "he who defines himself, confines himself."}
<C>__{third cop}
<D>__{the church already put up a $50,000 reward!}
<C>__{first cop}
<D>__{well, one of us is gonna get it. i mean get them.}
<A>__{the first cop raises a toast.}
<C>__{first cop}
<D>__{here's to payback for the nuns!}
<A>__{the cops all whoop and cheer.}
<C>__{second cop}
<D>__{anyone got any leads, at all?}
<C>__{first cop}
<D>__{we got shit to go on. only that list of inventory what they stole from the church.}
<C>__{third cop}
<D>__{y'know they actually stole those wacky purple robes? and they took the chalice with the host still inside!}
<C>__{second cop}
<D>__{what did they want with the host?}
<C>__{third cop}
<D>__{they were hungry. i dunno. they didn't want to hock the host, they wanted to hock that golden chalice.}
<A>__{cops avoid each others' eyes. competition has begun. no one shares information, each after the reward for himself. lt bursts out, swings into high gear.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{leave it to the catholic church, man. girls get raped everyday, and now they're gonna pay 50 g just because these chicks wore penguin suits!}
<A>__{some of the cops laugh, others are offended.}
<C>__{old irish cop}
<P>__{(to lt)}
<D>__{what's your fucking problem?!}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{the church is a racket.}
<C>__{old irish cop}
<D>__{so what. are you a catholic?}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{sure!}
<C>__{old irish cop}
<D>__{do you believe in god?}
<A>__{lt doesn't reply. he's thinking. the bet cop and a couple of other, familiar gambler cops move in. they've got nothing on their minds but the world series.}
<C>__{bet cop}
<P>__{(to lt)}
<D>__{to hell with this god stuff. how's that strawberry? he does what ever you want him to, huh lieutenant? even strike out!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i bet you won a shitload on oakland. how much, huh?}
<A>__{lt comes down off the car hood. now he has to feign pride in his supposed big bet on oakland. lt has to convince the cops to keep betting he can't afford to pay them all off. unfortunately, the cops all think lt just scored big, himself.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{more than you did.}
<C>__{gambler cop two}
<D>__{well, let's see some green!}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{if you know what's good for you, you'll keep staying on oakland!}
<C>__{bet cop}
<D>__{oakland? is that how you're going?}
<A>__{lt nods "yes." an outright lie.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{yeah. sure. don't you get it? the series has gotta last seven games. the last two did, didn't they? it's a racket. do you have any idea how much money they make selling television time for commercials during the series? especially if it's a new york team? they won't close the gold mine after only four games. it'll last a full seven. too many people wanna milk it for what it's worth. you'll see!}
<C>__{bet cop}
<D>__{all right... i'm in. after all, you're the expert. ain't that right, lt?}
<A>__{several cops, including some of the cops who have been hanging out in front of the hospital, go double or nothing on oakland. lt takes their bet money $900. one cop doesn't go along with the deal. lt painfully pays him off.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{you'll be sorry, man. but if you wanna be a sissy, here's your bread.}
<A>__{lt sits back on top of his car, drinking heavily. he toasts strawberry. the others are uneasy. why toast strawberry?}
<C>__{cop one}
<D>__{strawberry? i thought we were going with oakland.}
<C>__{lt}
<D>__{we are, man! that's the point! if the mets win, it's thanks to strawberry. if oakland wins, it's thanks to strawberry. nothing can happen out there on the field that don't gotta do with strawberry. so here's to strawberry!}
<A>__{the others join in the toast, but are uneasy.}
