<L>__{interior bathroom kyle's apartment day}
<A>__{close up on shower jets hitting kirsty's face and naked shoulders. her eyes are closed, but she smiles in pleasure as the water refreshes her. a knocking is heard. kirsty moves her head out of the water's path and shouts.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{yeah?}
<L>__{interior kyle's apartment day}
<A>__{it is basically a studio apartment everything except the bathroom facilities is in the one room. there is a sofa with sheets and blankets on it a bed, a dining all purpose table with two chairs, shelves full of records and books, and a small working desk against one of the walls. the desk is weighed down by text books and notes and, tacked to the wall above it, are medical prints, some of the brain and central nervous system, but also two fullcoloured anatomical prints one of a man and one of a woman. they could almost be portraits of julia and frank. kyle, fully dressed, is standing by the bathroom door, his hand still in a knocking position.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{you o.k.?}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{kirsty? you 0. k.?}
<A>__{the bathroom door opens and kirsty comes into the main room, dressed in a toweling robe that is clearly a 'hers' not a 'his'. she crosses the room to a mirror, rubbing at her wet hair with a towel.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{no bad dreams.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{so you slept o.k.?}
<A>__{kirsty gestures at the sofa.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{as much as that bed of nails allowed.}
<A>__{kyle glances meaningfully at the bed as he replies.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{well, the sofa isn't often used for sleeping on...}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{oh yeah? on your own a lot, huh?}
<A>__{kyle grins.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{like the robe?}
<A>__{kirsty returns the smile via the mirror. kyle crosses the room to sit at his dining table. empty coffee cups, the remnants of a loaf and some cheese suggests their breakfast was simple and finished some time ago. kirsty gathers her clothes from by the sofa and moves back into the bathroom to dress. kyle waits a few moments and then speaks.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{i think i need to talk. about what i saw.}
<A>__{kirsty emerges, fully dressed, her hair still damp.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{you thought i was crazy, didn't you?}
<A>__{kyle spreads his hands wide.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{jesus, yes! what do you expect. i mean, god, i still do! it's just that now i'm crazy too.}
<A>__{he grins wryly. kirsty moves to the sofa and sits down.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{and you're sure it was a woman?}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{god, i wish i could say no. this is going to do terrible things to my attitude, you know.}
<A>__{kirsty grins at him.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{don't worry about it. your attitude sucks anyway.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{hey, so for it. don't let pity stop you. i'm down. nail me.}
<A>__{for a moment, they laugh together but then stop. kirsty stares downward and then suddenly bursts into tears.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{what can i do? how can i save him?}
<A>__{kyle joins her on the sofa. he offers an arm but she shakes it off.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{the box. i need the box.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{the box? like in your story? like in his house?}
<A>__{kirsty's tears suddenly stop. she looks at kyle.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{the boxes. in the house. i told you.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{the boxes! i told you.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{you didn't tell me. do you mean malahide's got...}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{yeah. the things you were talking about.}
<A>__{kirsty heads instantly for kyle's door.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{i'm going.}
<A>__{kyle runs across the room and puts a restraining hand on his door.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{wait a minute. what do you mean, 'i'm going?' to the house?}
<A>__{kirsty nods and pulls at the door handle.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{get out of the way.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{are you crazy?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{i don't know, kyle. you're the fucking expert. now get out of the way!}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{because i'm going to get my father!}
<A>__{tears start to her eyes and she stares at kyle defiantly. then she repeats, more softly;}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{i'm going to get my father.}
<A>__{there is a two second silence between them as they stare at each other. finally, kyle backs away from the door, raising a finger.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{two seconds. just two seconds. don't move.}
<A>__{he rushes across the room, grabs a jacket, and moves back to the door.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{o.k. let's go.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{kyle, you don't have...}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{i know i don't have to. it's just my time of the month to be a complete fucking idiot. o.k.?}
<A>__{kirsty stares at him, her face at first blank then suffused with emotion. she leans across and plants a chaste kiss on his lips then pulls back. there is a beat while they simply stare at each other and suddenly they are tight in each other's arms, kissing fervently. but the kiss is fuelled, not by passion, but by fear and their mutual need for human solace in the face of the unknown. as the kiss continues, the camera pulls back from them.}
