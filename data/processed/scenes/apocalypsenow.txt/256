<A>__{as they proceed closer to the fortress temple, men appear where a moment before there was only jungle. they are mostly montagnards, but far more savage looking than any we've seen before. they wear only loinclothes and bandoliers of ammunition. their bodies are painted in strange patterns. they carry army m 16's, russian ak 47's and a wide variety of knives and clubs. women emerge from the brush as well. they are armed and equally primitive looking. interspersed among them are a few taller men with paler skins, with the remnants of army insignia on them. the paint on their bodies is, if anything more bizarre. we continue to move across the entire group up to the stone gates of the fort, where thirty or so more are seen silhouetted against the sky. willard and his men look up at people more primitive and more savage than any since the time of captain cook. they encounter, in the center of the group, what once appears to have been an american. he is tall, gaunt, wears a flak jacket, but is otherwise naked, save a loincloth. his face is darkened from dirt, battle smoke, strange camouflage patterns. his hair and beard are long, matted with mud and grease. he carries an ak 47 decorated with scalps and human ears. willard approaches this beast, who seems shy and retiring.}
