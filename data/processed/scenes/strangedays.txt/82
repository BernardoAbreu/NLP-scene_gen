<A>__{as lenny comes down the stairs from the vj booth, tearing open the envelope. an unmarked squid tape falls into his hand. the house lights dim and the stage lights come up. and faith is standing there. like she beamed in. she is wearing a revealing leather outfit, showing a lot of her milk white skin. her black hair frames her eyes, giving her an intense feral look. faith starts to sing. beautiful, unearthly, clear notes. suddenly the band kicks down with a wall of thundering sound. faith explodes into motion. her body convulses like a 440 volt mainline is hooked up to her. her voice becomes a scream, an inchoate wail, a police siren. the pain and rage of an entire, hell bent tormented planet on its eve of judgment. lost in the song, faith has found herself. she wheels across the stage, slashing her head up and down so that her hair bursts in the strobe flashes like flak. a techno erotic pagan. a force of nature. lenny is mesmerized. he has seen this before, many times. but it always has the same effect on him. he is transported into another world by her, a world in which there is only the two of them. tight on mace, eyes on the stage... a big piece of the puzzle suddenly fits. she's never seen faith perform before. holy shit. faith doesn't play to the audience, or engage them in any way. she is merely taking what's in her head and letting it out. she doesn't care if they are there or not. now shrieking into the silence after a climatic downbeat, and holding the note... holding it longer than you believe she possibly could. then nothing. when it is over she just drops the microphone and walk away. fuck you.}
