<L>__{exterior texas plains night}
<A>__{the jeep moves off road, headlights off, traveling by moonlight. it swerves and bucks from time to time. music plays from the tape deck, something more melodic. angle in jeep kyle behind the wheel, having the time of his life, marcus supervising, star enjoying the breeze and the unfamiliar sensation of a moving vehicle.}
<C>__{star}
<D>__{faster!}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{no! you're doing fine.}
<A>__{the song suddenly garbles, turning to noise. marcus ejects the tape, pulls it out it's unspooled, tangled in the stereo's guts. the kids groan disappointedly. static from the radio now... but a faint voice audible beneath it.}
<C>__{marcus }
<D>__{ssh.}
<A>__{marcus fiddles with the dial. he can't get the sound clear, rolls through the dial. varying levels of static, then a relatively clear voice:}
<C>__{radio voice}
<D>__{ proper ratio of ammonium nitrate to diesel fuel. a bomb of this type can be contained in an ordinary plastic garbage bag, and will detonate on impact...}

<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{that's him!}
<C>__{radio voice}
<D>__{this recording has described booby traps and explosive devices. it will repeat every two hours on different frequencies to avoid skynet jamming...}
<A>__{star points toward the horizon. marcus looks up.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{stop the car.}
<B>__{kyle accelerates.}
<C>__{marcus }
<D>__{other pedal, other pedal!}
<A>__{they screech to a halt. in the distance a red glow of flames far away. silhouetted against this, strange flying vehicles and spindly, spider like machines are just visible.}
<C>__{radio voice}
<D>__{do not give in to despair. as bleak as things seem, i assure you, humanity will triumph.}
<A>__{high angle the jeep turns away from the conflagration, moves off in a new direction and vanishes into the darkness.}
<C>__{radio voice }
<D>__{the machines only win when we give up hope... this is john connor.}
