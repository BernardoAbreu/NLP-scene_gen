<D>__{aren't you, elise ? he's your joe, your asset. he's working for you, you're his case officer right?}
<A>__{how should she respond? how thin should she slice it?}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{...sometimes... in addition to being a nationality, being a palestinian is also a... profession. a lucrative one.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{meaning, he's your joe.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{mine. yours. the israelis. the saudis. at one time or another, everybody in the middle east has slept with everybody else.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{so you're saying... you sleep around?}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{only professionally.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{so we share him.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{hub}
<P>__{(to frank)}
<D>__{ call ins, find out his status and start deportation proceedings.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{i can't let you do that.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{oh, you can't let me do that. what precisely is your involvement with these people.}
<C>__{elise}
<P>__{(sighs, then:)}
<D>__{samir's been a very important... project of mine for some time... i'm the only one he'll deal with. he's very well connected and extremely high strung.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{...call the judge.}
<C>__{elise}
<P>__{(looks at frank)}
<D>__{how easy is it to get inside, frank? how good are your sources in the mosques? how many people you got in hamas ?}
<A>__{franks shakes his head, ruefully. she's right.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{no surveillance. i've seen your deft touch.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{daily reports. we tap his phone.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{and i get to see the transcripts.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{fair enough.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{and i run him.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{we share him.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{he can't know we're talking.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{then don't tell him.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{done.}
<C>__{hub}
<P>__{(to frank)}

<D>__{i will have somebody drive you.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{i will grab a cab.}
<A>__{and he's gone. frank turns to elise:}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{elise. i'm really high strung, too.}
<A>__{she just smiles and walks away. outside the federal building moments later not many people around. hub stands on the corner. a taxi cruises up. on duty. available. he slows long enough to see that hub is black and passes right by.}
<B>__{at a red light}
<A>__{the taxi driver stops just long enough for hub to slam his shield on the windshield.}
<B>__{in the taxi}
<A>__{hub sits in back, hurtling into the night. the driver's id identifies him as abdul hassam. hub shakes his head.}
<B>__{in the shower}
<A>__{as the hot spray hits him, he runs his hands through his hair and feels the bits of shattered glass. dried blood runs off in rivulets from his hands. not his own. he leans against the shower wall, closes his eyes.}
