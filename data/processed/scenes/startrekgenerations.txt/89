<A>__{picard is pacing. riker, data, worf, troi, n.d.s at their stations. the ship is at red alert. data's mood has improved. he's making an effort to keep a positive outlook... to stay upbeat.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{maybe they're not out there.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{they're just trying to decide whether a twenty year old klingon bird of prey is any match for the federation flagship.}
<C>__{troi}
<D>__{or perhaps they're on the surface...}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{mister data, scan the planet for life forms.}
<A>__{data smiles, delighted at the request.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{i was hoping you would ask me to do that, captain. i just love to scan for life forms.}
<A>__{as data works, he breaks into a merry little song.}
<C>__{data}
<P>__{(sings)}
<D>__{"life forms... tiny little life forms... where are the life forms "}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{commander.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{sorry, sir.}
<P>__{(works)}
<D>__{there is too much interference in the planet's ionosphere for an accurate reading.}
<A>__{worf turns to picard.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{sir, according to my calculations, a solar probe launched from either the klingon ship or the planet's surface will take eleven seconds to reach the star.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{however, since we do not know the exact point of origin, it will take us between eight and fifteen seconds to lock our weapons onto it.}
<A>__{they exchange a grim look.}
<C>__{riker}
<P>__{(quiet, to picard)}
<D>__{that's a pretty big margin of error.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{too big. how long until the ribbon arrives?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{approximately forty seven minutes, sir.}
<C>__{picard}

<A>__{angle (vfx i) on the view screen, the bird of prey decloaks.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{they are hailing.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{on screen.}
<A>__{angle (vfx p) on the view screen, lursa and b'etor appear.}
<C>__{lursa}
<D>__{captain. what an unexpected pleasure.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{lursa, i want to talk to soran.}
<C>__{lursa}
<D>__{i'm afraid the doctor is no longer aboard our ship.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{then i will beam down to his location. just give us his coordinates.}
<C>__{b'etor}
<D>__{the doctor values his privacy. he would be quite... upset if an away team interrupted him.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{very well... i will beam to your ship and you can transport me to soran...}
<C>__{riker}
<P>__{(urgent)}
<D>__{sir, you can't trust them. they'll kill you just like they killed geordi.}
<A>__{lursa and b'etor exchange a glance.}
<C>__{lursa}
<P>__{(innocent)}
<D>__{we did not kill your engineer. he's been... our guest.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{then return him.}
<C>__{b'etor}
<D>__{in exchange for what?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{me... if you let me speak to soran.}
<A>__{the two sisters appear to consider this for a moment.}
<C>__{b'etor}
<P>__{(to lursa)}
<D>__{the captain would make a much more valuable hostage.}
<C>__{lursa}
<P>__{(to picard)}
<D>__{we'll consider it a prisoner exchange.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{agreed.}
<A>__{the transmission ends. picard heads for the turbolift.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{number one, you have the bridge. have doctor crusher meet me in transporter room three.}
