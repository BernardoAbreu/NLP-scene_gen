<T>__{camera on:}
<L>__{interior dinko's trailer night}
<A>__{music is playing extremely loud in a funky ass trailer as judy dances with dinko (late 20s) a completely drunk trailer trash dude wearing a pizza delivery outfit. empty whiskey and beer bottles are scattered throughout the tiny living room as cigarette smoke hovers around them due to a ridiculously low ceiling. judy is dancing in a very sexy manner with dinko who is dancing like a complete dork. dinko has no moves, rhythm, or beat whatsoever, but dances with as much vigor as a dog on crack. jimmy is sitting on the couch filming them dancing in front of him. dinko is forced to scream over top of the music to be heard. he looks directly at jimmy noticing that jimmy's turned on the camera.}
<C>__{dinko}
<D>__{hey! the video man. i remember that shit when we was in together. said you video ed everything.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{yep.}
<C>__{dinko}
<D>__{hey man, it's cool if you guys stay here for a while, but i have a small business to run man. there's going to be some people knocking on the door and shit. i can't have you guys answering the door or the phone. that's the only rule. other than that man, we're going to getting fucked up together all the time. i got a shit load of crank dude, that shit is off the fucking hook. here, take a hit.}
<A>__{dinko tries to hand off some crank to jimmy.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{no thanks, i just want to film judy dancing.}
<A>__{jimmy pans the camera over towards judy. she's doing her best sexy dance into the camera. we can still hear dinko talking to jimmy.}
<C>__{dinko }
<D>__{right man. that's cool. hey um... if i tell you to stop taping though, man, you gotta stop. i got some hard core junkies coming over here. sometimes, if they see shit like that, they fucking flip. crank junkies are a whole different kind of breed man. they're fucking hard core mother fuckers. you don't know what they're gonna fucking do. this one guy got paranoid about something. he used to climb on his roof to take a dump. that's the only place he would shit! how fucked up is that?}
<A>__{dinko laughs at his own joke.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{you're not even paying attention to me jimmy.}
<A>__{judy takes her dancing up a notch to get jimmy's attention.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{don't i look sexy?}
<A>__{jimmy doesn't get a chance to respond.}
<C>__{dinko }
<D>__{yeah, you look real sexy baby. real nice.}
<A>__{dinko starts in with jimmy again.}
<C>__{dinko }
<D>__{hey, i may have some work for you if you're cool with that.}
<A>__{jimmy turns the camera back to dinko while he goes to the kitchen to get a beer.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{what kind of work?}
<C>__{dinko}
<D>__{you know some hustling, some good money. i will teach you how to mix the shit. your girlfriend too if she wants.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<P>__{(sarcasm)}
<D>__{yeah. that's what i've always wanted to do. learn to make and sell crystal methamphetamine. you're a fucking genius dinko.}
<A>__{dinko is too stupid to recognize sarcasm.}
<C>__{dinko}
<P>__{(big smile)}
<D>__{yeah, man! fuckin' high five.}
<A>__{dinko high five's jimmy and laughs again.}
<C>__{dinko}
<P>__{(re: judy)}
<D>__{so is she, like, your girlfriend or are you guys just fucking?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{she's my girlfriend, my best friend, and yes we fuck. and don't ever, ever fucking touch her. that's my only rule dinko.}
<A>__{judy is frustrated with jimmy's lack of attention.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{jimmy!}
<A>__{jimmy turns the camera to her. she's starting to do her best impression of a stripper dance.}
<C>__{dinko}
<D>__{it's all good man. i ain't gonna touch your old lady. shit man, she's so into you anyway.}
<A>__{dinko gets up and moves into the kitchen area, crossing the frame. jimmy focusses the camera's attention on various items in the kitchen while dinko talks. there's ripped open small electronics and appliances everywhere, as if dinko's been taking everything apart and trying to put it back together.}
<C>__{dinko}
<D>__{so there's this dude. fucker taught me everything i know about meth and shit. he'd fucking flip for your girl, man. you should go up and see him. he's in erlanger.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{uncle rodney?}
<A>__{camera drifts across several messy piles of papers and cardboard boxes with bags of drugs in them.}
<C>__{dinko }
<D>__{right, right! i forgot. yeah, uncle rodney!}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{you have an uncle rodney baby?}
<A>__{judy is too stoned to realize that jimmy has already told her about uncle rodney. jimmy pulls out to include judy in the shot. she's in the kitchen doing another line of crank off a counter top.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i want to meet your uncle.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{he's not my uncle. he's not anybody's uncle. people just call him that. he's the one i told you about from the nut house.}
<A>__{as judy bends down to snort her line, camera drifts over to dinko who's holding a huge hillbilly wad of cash in his hand and stuffs it into a box of cereal. jimmy zooms in on the cereal box. there's a whole bunch more cash in there.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{i said one day i'd take you up to erlanger one day, remember?}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{when was that?}
<A>__{dinko throws the cash on the table. jimmy zooms out catching judy in the frame.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{when we were naked.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{we're always naked, jimmy.}
<A>__{judy wipes powder from her nose, then goes foggy for a split second, losing then catching her balance.}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(re: crank)}
<D>__{fuck... woah, that's cool.}
<C>__{dinko }
<D>__{that's some good shit, huh?}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(disoriented)}
<D>__{uh huh...}
<A>__{jimmy turns the camera onto dinko.}
<C>__{dinko}
<D>__{so you guys should like, totally go see him, man. i don't fuckin' go up there no more, 'cuz like, i got all the shit i need right here man, 'cuz my place is cool and all, but there's no fucking room here, ya know? so like you should go see him and shit.}
<A>__{judy steps into frame. at this point, she's in her bra and is dancing like a stripper directly in front of the camera.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{you like this, jimmy?}
<A>__{there's a knock at the door.}
<C>__{dinko }
<P>__{(calls out to door)}
<D>__{yo!}
<P>__{(to jimmy)}
<D>__{customers call.}
<A>__{judy keeps on dancing in her own little world while dinko goes to the door. judy finishes her bottle of beer. she's pretty drunk and cranked out at this pointerior dinko is at the front door dealing with a customer. we can't see her and we can barely hear what they're talking about, but it seems dinko is engaged in a heated conversation with her. he yells back into the living room from the front door.}
<C>__{dinko }
<D>__{yo, jimmy. is your girl into chicks?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{i don't know.}
<P>__{(to judy)}
<D>__{are you into chicks?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{do you want me to be into chicks?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<P>__{(calls to her)}
<D>__{sure dinko. bring her in.}
<A>__{dinko brings in hazel,(40), a frightfully thin crank addict. she's scared, nervous, and completely strung out, and she looks like death. they stand off to the side of the room watching judy dance. judy realizes the woman is in the room and stops dancing. jimmy zooms in on the woman. looking closer we see that hazel is in the final stages of her life addiction. she's sweating and her eyes are bugging out of her skull. dinko turns the music down so they don't have to scream.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{you know what, never mind dink. i don't think judy's into chicks.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{yeah, i'm not into chicks.}
<C>__{dinko}
<D>__{well hazel here will do anything we want. ain't that right hazel?}
<A>__{hazel nods her head yes.}
<C>__{dinko}
<D>__{you're into chicks aren't you hazel?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{um, i really just want to get some stuff and get out of here.}
<A>__{hazel is trembling. the party atmosphere has come to a complete halt.}
<C>__{dinko}
<D>__{shut up you fat fucking junkie and take your clothes off or you ain't getting shit.}
<A>__{hazel's not moving. she's reluctant.}
<C>__{dinko}
<D>__{come on!}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i don't...}
<A>__{dinko smacks her square in the face.}
<C>__{dinko}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{just do it, you fucking whore!}
<A>__{hazel starts to take her clothes off reluctantly.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{jimmy.}
<A>__{jimmy doesn't do anything. he just keeps filming.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{jimmy, stop him!}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{he's a big boy, he can do what he wants.}
<A>__{this gives dinko an added boost of confidence. hazel is now in her bra and panties and is standing in front of them.}
<C>__{dinko}
<D>__{ever made a porno?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{not with you.}
<C>__{dinko}
<D>__{well all right! keep filming mother fucker, i'm gonna fuck this junkie for you. you guys are free to join in whenever you like.}
<A>__{judy is now borderline hysterical.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i swear to god jimmy if you let him go through with this i will never talk to you again!}
<A>__{jimmy ignores her.}
<C>__{dinko}
<D>__{you ready? you filming?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{i'm filming. are you going to fuck her or are you just gonna talk about it?}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{jimmy!}
<A>__{dinko unbuckles his belt as fast as he can. hazel begins to cry as dinko pushes her into position on all fours.}
<C>__{dinko}
<P>__{(to jimmy)}
<D>__{how's this? you getting good camera angles and shit?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{turn her ass towards the camera.}
<C>__{dinko}
<P>__{(laughing it up)}
<D>__{take off them panties bitch... oh yeah! come on bitch. move.}
<A>__{judy is crying profusely in the background as dinko pushes hazel to the ground. jimmy zooms in on dinko, framing out hazel as dinko gets himself ready to take her from behind.}
<C>__{dinko}
<D>__{that's it. just like that.}
<A>__{dinko looks directly at the lens of the camera.}
<C>__{dinko}
<D>__{we're going to be doing this shit all the time brother.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{you think so?}
<C>__{dinko}
<D>__{fuck yeah!}
<A>__{dinko sees something o.c. from jimmy, we can't see that surprises him.}
<C>__{dinko}
<D>__{you don't have to hold a gun to her head man. there's plenty of other chicks we can do that to. if that's what you're into, then fuck it, i will...}
<A>__{bam!!! dinko takes a shot in the throat and falls onto hazel. jimmy's shot him. judy has stopped screaming. hazel on the other hand is freaking out, trapped under a squirming dinko. jimmy sets the camera on top of something, stands up and brings the gun to judy.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{take it!}
<A>__{judy doesn't know what to do. jimmy puts the gun in her hand.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{finish him off! he deserves a bullet right in the fucking face, doesn't he?}
<A>__{judy's in a weird cranked out place.}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(nervous, cranked out)}
<D>__{yeah. yeah. he does.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{then do it.}
<A>__{judy points the gun at a still squirming dinko. she can't bring herself to pull the trigger. we can hear dinko choking on his own blood. he struggles to move towards judy. jimmy's now standing behind judy. he wraps his hand around hers, helps her point the gun and...}
<B>__{bam}
<A>__{shoots dinko right between the eyes. jimmy helps her again. bam bam two more shots into his chest, jimmy's hand still wrapped around judy's over the gun. jimmy lets go of her hand and the gun drops to the floor. she's stunned. jimmy comes towards camera and shuts it down.}
