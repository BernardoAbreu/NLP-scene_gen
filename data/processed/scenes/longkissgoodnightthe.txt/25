<A>__{samantha hurries to the door. carrying a bowl of festive m&m's. just as she gets to the door, the singing stops. footfalls running away, that's odd... she opens the door. carolers, gone. she's eye to eye with one eyed jack.}
<D>__{one eyed jack evening charly. long time.}
<A>__{he swings the big gun. slams the barrel into her. glass shatters, m&m's everywhere. she gapes at him, dumbstruck, unable to think... hurry it up, lady, we need a decision, live or die she grabs the gun barrel. wrenches the gun...! on the steps caitlin howls, eyes like saucers }

<D>__{get ouuttttt!!!!}
<A>__{sam's cry is a veritable shriek. hal launches himself from the kitchen doorway. pounces on jack, snarling brave, useless. for his trouble, gets three broken ribs and a trip to the fireplace, airborne. comes down. catches fire. rolls, over and over on broken ribs jack kicks samantha in the gut. she collapses onto the stairs. splinters the banister. that's when he sees caitlin. top of the stairs, paralyzed.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{no!!!!}
<A>__{jack is already moving forward. spin cocks the shotgun, draws a bead promptly slips on festive m&m's. goes down. gun goes off, wham ! a flat concussion. the banister explodes. a storm of wood chips, as samantha surges up the stairs, toward her daughter jack. on the ground. fires, wham ! the wall disappears three inches from caitlin's head. blown to shreds, you can see outdoors. samantha doesn't miss a beat. grabs her daughter flings her outside. through the hole in the wall. takes her by the belt and fucking hurls her out into space...!}
