<A>__{gru, sneaking through the party, spots antonio and margo dancing. gru sneaks up on antonio, using the flashing strobe lights to cover his approach. suddenly antonio is gone and gru is the one dancing with margo, who has her back to him and is oblivious to what's going on. antonio reappears and kicks gru in the crotch from behind. he dances once again with margo while gru hunches over in pain. gru then gets the upper hand and starts choking antonio and shaking him. margo turns around and sees this. gru and antonio see they are being watched by margo and start casually dancing next to each other as if nothing is wrong. as the song ends, margo takes antonio's hand and pulls him away from gru off the dance floor. gru is defeated and all alone.}
