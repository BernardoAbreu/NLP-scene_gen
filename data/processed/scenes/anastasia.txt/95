<B>__{in her dream}
<A>__{anya is walking through the wheat field to the edge of a bluff. a few yards below the bluff, anya sees a beautiful little pond where a family frolic's in the clear water; laughing, splashing, swiming happily. anya climbs over a low flowering wall to look closer.}
<B>__{pull back}
<A>__{reality: anya has climbed over the railing of the deck and is looking into the black ocean... smiling.}
