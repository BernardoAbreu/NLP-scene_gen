<L>__{exterior alley}
<A>__{back above ground, bumstead, white and schreber run from the door at the end of the alley way, tossing their masks away.}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{was that for real down there?}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{i'm afraid so.}
<A>__{the inspector stops walking suddenly, grabs white, holds him back.}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{what the hell is that?}
<A>__{at the end of the alley the puppet advances menacingly. schreber takes his chance and runs down an alley and disappears.}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{quick. my car.}
<A>__{fortunately bumstead's car stands nearby. the two men leap in, start it up. bumstead guns towards the puppet standing in the glare of the headlights. the puppet's head opens, a tiny propeller pops out, spins, lifting the puppet into the air. the car passes beneath it at speed. screeches off into a street, races along between tall buildings.}
<B>__{inside the car}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{what now?}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{this ocean business... i know where i can find a map. i need to go back to the station. where will you be?}
<A>__{white thinks for a moment, pulls the paper his wife gave him from his pocket.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{i will go see an uncle of mine.}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{five one eight three double six three...}
<A>__{bumstead scribbles on the pad mounted to the dash, battles with the wheel, driving at breakneck speed.}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{good.}
<P>__{(looks in rear mirror)}
<D>__{uh oh...}
<A>__{white turns and looks behind them. his p.o.v. headlights gaining on them. on the puppet sitting at the wheel of a stolen car, driving like crazy. back in bumstead's car white takes out his gun aims at the rapidly approaching car.}
<C>__{white }
<D>__{it's empty.}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{take mine.}
<A>__{bumstead pulls a gun out of his coat. they swap. the puppet pulls alongside, a mechanical arm extends towards bumstead's front tire. a spinning blade extends from the end of the mechanical arm.}
<C>__{puppet}
<D>__{arrrrrrrrggghhhh!... ha ha ha ha ha!!}
<A>__{tight on the blade heading for the spinning wheel. white fires. shells hit the puppet's car, shattering windows. the blade cuts into the tire it pops loudly, goes flat, metal sparks off the road. white is thrown forward, hits his head on the dash. bumstead fights to keep control, swerves into the side of the other vehicle, making it scrape a concrete wall, hits garbage cans flying. the puppet's car falls behind then swerves off into a side street and disappears.}
<C>__{bumstead }
<D>__{where did it go?}
<C>__{white }
<D>__{don't know.}
<A>__{both look forward again to see the puppet's car pull out in front of them, blocking the way. bumstead's car is going too fast. slams the brakes. tight on puppet screaming with insane joy as bumstead's car approaches like a bullet. inside inspector's car}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{jump!}
<A>__{bumstead rips the phone number from the pad. the two men leap. the car continues onwards. crash! ka boom! in the glow of the flaming wrecks, the two men pick themselves up from different sides of the street. look at each other, turn and head in opposite directions. camera moves in on mangled metal a mechanical claw starts to pull itself from the wreckage.}
