<L>__{interior apartment n night}
<A>__{moonlight seeps around the blinds to reveal mr. smith asleep in bed. beyond the open bedroom door down the hall is only darkness until the eruption of illumination from a penlight momentarily outlines the figure of a man. then we're looking at what the penlight sees. a keyring. hands in surgical gloves isolate the safety deposit key and press it into a soft wax block where it leaves its impression. the light goes off. in the bedroom at the end of the hallway, mr. smith begins to snore. the figure coasts silently toward the sound. mr. smith's face is sideways on the pillow. the snores and a little drool burbles out of the corner of his mouth. whoomp!! the impact of something landing on the bed bounces mr. smith upright and awake.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{ahhh!!! ahhh!!! ahhh!!!}
<A>__{the beam from the penlight hits him in the face. he raises his hands to shield his eyes.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{don't worry, if i were here to kill you, you would already be dead.}
<A>__{the penlight leaves mr. smith and mr. brooks places it deliberately under his own chin casting long sinister shadows up his face. he's sitting on the bed next to mr. smith.}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{after you left today, i realized our friendship was a little one sided.}
<C>__{mr. brooks }
<D>__{so when we meet tomorrow night would you be so kind as to bring all of the pictures and the memory card from your camera. that way we can like each other simply for who we are. if you don't show up, i will presume you've gone to the police and i will kill you. even if i go to jail because of you, someone will find you wherever you are and kill you.}
<A>__{the penlight goes off. there's total silence.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<P>__{(squeaks)}
<D>__{mr. brooks?...}
<A>__{he squints into the black.}
<C>__{mr. smith}
<D>__{mr. brooks?...}
<A>__{finally he gathers the courage to extend a shaky hand. the bedside lamp goes on. the room is empty. cautiously mr. smith swings his legs out of bed and stands up. he forces himself to go to the door and from there curls his arm around the jamb into the darkness. the hall light is dazzling. a peek into the bathroom shows there is nobody there. he continues on into the living room. his camera equipment is on the table. the tripod is still set up. there is no sign of mr. brooks. mr. smith eyes the front door. it's closed and the 'security chain' is in place!! another quick scan of the room. it sure seems that he's alone. he opens the front door the length of the chain and looks up and down the hallway. it's empty. slowly he closes the door. standing in the light of his living room, mr. smith is more scared and strangely more excited than he's ever been in his life.}
