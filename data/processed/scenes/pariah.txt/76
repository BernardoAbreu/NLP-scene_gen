<A>__{alike jerks awake in her bed, a pillow pulled down around her ears. the sound of a muffled argument leaks from her parents's bedroom. the shouting gets louder, and alike sits upright in her bed as her father's footsteps boom past her doorway and into the living room. audrey's voice trails him down the hallway, and alike scrambles into a t shirt and shorts.}
