<B>__{up ahead}
<A>__{nomak abruptly stops, having reached the end of the roof. the nearest neighboring rooftop is too far away and the drop from this last ledge looks unsurvivable, even for someone like nomak. as blade cautiously advances, nomak turns around and smiles a wolfish grin, unnaturally wide. the reaper's face is beginning to smoke beneath the rising sun's rays. in response, a polarized nictomembrane slides down over nomak's irises like something you'd see on a crocodile to protect its eyes from harsh light.}

<A>__{nomak laughs, then lunges, scooping up a rusty iron bar that lies nearby. he swings it at blade. blade parries and steps backward, taking a blow to the head in the process, then another to the side. the two of them exchange a flurry of blows back and forth until their weapons lock and they are face to face. nomak's back is to the rising sun, now. his whole body is beginning to lightly smoke. both men are trembling, straining against their weapons, using every ounce of strength to keep the other at bay. and just when it looks like nomak is gaining the upper hand }

<A>__{ blade pivots the flat edge of his sword upwards, catching the light of the rising sun, reflecting it directly into nomak's eyes! nomak screams and rears back, his face catching fire. then he stumbles backwards and falls right off the ledge of the roof! blade hurries to the roof's ledge and looks down but the reaper is nowhere in sight. dumbfounded, blade retreats, haunted by the conviction that nomak is still alive.}
