<D>__{of course, up to this point in our story, i was blissfully ignorant. i had no idea of the storm that was gathering. never even heard of sherman mccoy. hadn't the faintest notion that soon his name would be inexorably tied to mine. that his fate would be inextricably bound to my own destiny.}

<D>__{you know, i was at a dinner party last night. and in the middle of the pudding, this four year old child came in pulling a toy wagon around the table and on the wagon was a fresh turd. her own, i suppose. and the parents just shook their heads and smiled.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{incroyable!}
<C>__{moore}
<D>__{i've made a big investment in you, peter. time and money. and it's not working. now i could just shake my head and smile. but in my house, when a turd appears, we deal with it. we dispose of it. we flush it away. we don't put it on the table and call it caviar.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i see. yes. yes, of course. well, i am on to something right now... and i think i've got... it's just a matter of... this is something that is really going to break open!}
