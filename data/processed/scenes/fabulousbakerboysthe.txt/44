<L>__{interior corner diner}
<A>__{in the front window, room has been made among the photographs for one of susie. inside, jack, frank and susie sit at a table, surrounded by empty coffee cups and cigarettes. frank has several slips of paper before him with names and dates.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{the twenty third ... yeah, here it is. we got the carlton or the plaza. four day turns. what do you think, jack?}
<A>__{jack is staring out the window.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{jack, you with us?}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{the carlton's a dump. no cover. no minimum. and they water their drinks. it's strictly for the fuller brush crowd.}
<A>__{susie, as she says this, is pouring sugar into her coke.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(watching)}
<D>__{i guess it's,the plaza then. that brings us to the twenty seventh. we got the avedon for three or the park downtown for two.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{we take the avedon, right? simple.}
<A>__{frank rubs his chin and looks at jack. jack shakes his head.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{the park? it's only two nights. why throw away a night?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{because blackie carson books the park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{oh.}
<P>__{(lifting her glass)}
<D>__{well, for blackie then.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{by the way, i got a messsage yesterday from some guy looking for new year's action. resort, upstate.}
<C>__{susie}
<P>__{(likes "resort')}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that's what i figure. probably have us in a bed and breakfast playing to the owls.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{maybe it's legit.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{maybe. i will call him.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{make it collect.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(shuffling his slips)}
<D>__{that's it except for the first. we got the sheraton, the ambassador, or the holiday inn on sixtieth. all three day turns.}
<A>__{frank looks at jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{draw.}
<A>__{susie shrugs.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{how'd you guys used to decide what gig to take?}
<A>__{jack and frank exchange a glance.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{uh, well ... we flipped a coin.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{so find a dime. let's get out of here.}
