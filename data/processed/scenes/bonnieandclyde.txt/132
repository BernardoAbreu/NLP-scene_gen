<L>__{interior of car. night.}
<A>__{it is now night. everyone inside the car is eating. apparently they stopped somewhere along the way for food. in the crowded interior, it is like a party food is being passed back and forth, laughter and gaiety, increasing warmth between the couple and the barrows. the car has become a little society on wheels, dashing through the black night down the highway. inside there is a small world of happiness and fun. buck is unpacking the food and passing sandwiches and drinks around the car.}

<C>__{eugene}
<P>__{(as his laugh begins to fade)}
<D>__{i'm an undertaker.}
<A>__{suddenly everyone freezes. a shudder, as if the cold hand of death had suddenly touched the occupants of the car. the atmosphere changes to cold, deadly, fearful silence in exactly one second. it is a premonition of death for the barrows, and they react accordingly, bonnie especially. close up. bonnie.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(tautly, in a flat voice)}
<D>__{get them out of here.}
