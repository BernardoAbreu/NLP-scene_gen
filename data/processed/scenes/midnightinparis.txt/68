<D>__{ah now here's a superb picasso.}
<A>__{a36 gil is stunned.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{if i'm not mistaken he painted this marvelous portrait of his french mistress madeline brissou in the twenties.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{er i have to differ with you on this one.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{inez}
<D>__{gil pay attention and you'll learn something.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{if i'm not mistaken this was a failed attempt to capture a young french girl named adriana from bordeaux if my art history serves me came to paris to study costume design for the theatre. believe she had a brief affair with modigliani then braque that's where pablo met her er picasso. you'd never know it from this portrait but she's quite subtly beautiful.}
<C>__{inez}
<D>__{what have you been smoking?}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{and i'd hardly call the picture superb. it's more of a petit bourgeoise statement of how pablo er picasso sees her, saw her he's distracted by the fact she was a volcano in the sack.}
