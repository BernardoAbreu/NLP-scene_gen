<L>__{interior research plant: on ross day}
<A>__{the industrial frontier. special agent ross steps into frame, glancing (perhaps idly, a little impatiently) in this direction at some loud industrial goings on just beyond camera, then returns toward group. the group includes cable and a younger fbi agent with clipboard, to whom klute is supplying preliminary data. klute's manner is somewhat rumpled, awkward.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{klute. with a k. k l u }

<C>__{ross}
<D>__{did he ever mention specifically a girl or woman in new york?}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{examine this letter please.}
<P>__{(continues)}
<D>__{we recovered that from the shredder the plant disposal and incinerator system. grunemann apparently typed it friday, before he left, decided not to send it, tossed it away. we've already contacted the new york police; they think they know the girl in question.}
<B>__{c.u. klute}
<A>__{klute reads. we see a controlled incredulity and revulsion.}
<C>__{ross }
<D>__{he never mentioned this type thing to you? you didn't know he had these interests?}
