<T>__{slow dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior willy's apartment a couple of days later}
<A>__{the garage door is open, letting in daylight. we can see the alley especially well, because there are only empty hangers on the clothes bar, and the cinderblock shelves have been taken apart, stacked on the floor. willy is packing. he's wearing jeans, an old t shirt. he carries a heavy pile of legal textbooks out to the trash bins, throws them away. as he turns to go back in he sees lobruto coming along the alley, wearing a suit. surprised, waits.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{you're not answering your phone.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{that's kind of an answer in itself, isn't it?}
<A>__{willy heads back in, starts to pack again.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{where are you headed?}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{haven't decided yet. just someplace else.}
<A>__{lobruto nods. willy packs.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{i shouldn't have let it get so far out of control.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we all lose, willy.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{yep.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{we just have to live with that, and keep fighting the good fight.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{that's not what i was doing.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{you belong in a courtroom.}
<A>__{willy packs, thinking about that. shakes his head.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i need to get to know myself better.}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{you're a good lawyer. all this may have even made you a better lawyer. don't waste it.}
<A>__{willy turns on him angry, confused, bitter:}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i didn't just lose a case! i let a man get away with murder.}
<A>__{lobruto nods. respecting his pain. shrugs, accepts the decision, with regret. willy nods his thanks, and turns back to packing. lobruto starts to leave. but from the alley door:}
<C>__{lobruto}
<D>__{if it makes you feel any better technically, you let a man get away with attempted murder.}
<A>__{willy doesn't respond. keeps packing. lobruto goes out. after a moment, willy stops. looking up. something turning over in his mind.}
