<A>__{some quiet, informally dressed couples wait in the rear of the chapel; some talking, others sitting nervously. a single organ plays some standard wedding music. the view pans up to the altar, where connie and merle, in the same clothing they wore to the tahoe party, are being married by a justice of the peace. the justice goes through the bored, simple ceremony, and we begin to hear an echo of the waltz connie danced with her father, when she was married all those years ago in long island.}
