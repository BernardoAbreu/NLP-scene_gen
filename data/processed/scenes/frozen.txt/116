<A>__{lynch and parker sit on the frozen chair, shivering. they are now in the devastating silence that has fallen after what must have been endless screaming and crying. only the occasional sniffle lets us know that they are even awake. finally lynch breaks the silence.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{i should...try and...}
<A>__{he starts to try and sit up on the back of the chair again to continue his climbing effort.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(emotionless)}
<D>__{why did you let him jump?}
<A>__{lynch turns and looks at her in disbelief.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{you can't be fucking serious.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{it was too far.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{he said he could do it. you didn't try and stop him!}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i can't believe this?! you're blaming me?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i'm not...i'm not blaming you.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{you're his girlfriend! i didn't see you throwing yourself in front of him!}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{he wasn't going to listen to me.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{oh, but he would have listened to me? i said it was a bad idea! i}
<B>__{e}
<D>__{said it was too far a drop! but i didn't hear any better ideas out of you except for crying about it! don't you fucking blame me! you've been his girlfriend, for what? a year maybe? i've known him my whole fucking life!}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{but you... you should have...}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{what? say it.}
<A>__{parker looks at him, uncertain.}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{say it! it should have been me?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i didn't say that.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{but you want to! it's ok. i get it. it should have been me down there cause who gives a fuck about me, right?}
<A>__{parker feels terrible. she puts her hand on his shoulder.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{no, no, i }
<A>__{lynch shrugs her hand off of him.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{you know what? if we hadn't spent the whole fucking day on the bunny slope watching you fall on your ass we would have gotten some real runs in and we could have just gone home!}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{you're sorry? maybe if you hadn't fucked with our thing... maybe if you had just stayed home and not forced yourself into every aspect of his life... maybe my best friend}
<B>__{e}
<D>__{wouldn't be dead right now!}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{that's not fair!}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{and it's not fair that my best friend is dead!}
<A>__{parker begins to sob.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i'm sorry! i didn't mean it! i'm just i'm just }
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{ fuck you.}
<A>__{lynch is numb. he sits expressionless. seething. in her crying, parker slowly keeps moving towards him. like a puppy who knows they did something wrong and only wants you to love it again. finally she gets next to him and buries her head in his chest, letting it all out. eventually, lynch can't help but feel compassion for her. he puts his arm around her.}
<C>__{lynch }
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm sorry, parker.}
