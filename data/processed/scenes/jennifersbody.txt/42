<L>__{exterior mc cullum park fourteen minutes later}
<A>__{the park is dark and tree lined and appears to be a popular clandestine meeting spot for the youth of devil's kettle. the abandoned sand volleyball pits are full of couples making out. needy runs past them skittishly. as she ascends a grassy hill, chip is revealed, silhouetted against a backdrop of twirling police lights. needy squints at the lights, sees chip's house in the distance.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{why are the cops at your house?}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{they're not. they're at jonas kozelle's house. he got murdered.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{what?! like, he was shot by gangbangers?}
<C>__{chip}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{no, needy! do you see anyone rollin' on dubs around here?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{someone ripped jonas limb from limb in the woods behind the school. ate parts of him. they found teethmarks on him on the body.}
<A>__{his voice cracks. we see a brief, terrifying flash of jonas's mutilated body and pain stricken face. needy doesn't want to believe it.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{some animals must've got to him.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{human teethmarks.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{who would do that?}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{i don't know. it just happened after school. no one's supposed to know yet, but my dad went over there and talked to the cops. jonas's mom is catatonic. she's just staring out the front window like a zombie mannequin robot statue.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{this can't be a coincidence.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{what do you mean, needy?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{a fiery death trap last night, and now a cannibal eats our starting tight end? come on!}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{don't get spooky on me, babe.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{seriously chip. most small towns only have something gruesome happen like, once every decade maybe. devil's kettle gets two nightmares in 24 hours? it's freaktarded. it's not right.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{what, do you think it's, like supernatural?}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{i don't know. i'm extremely intelligent but i obviously don't know everything.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{well, the bad luck's gotta be over now, right? it can't get any worse, right? obviously it can't. it can't. i mean, you agree, right? there won't be another victim.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{you're shaking.}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{i'm cold. it's very cold out here.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{want my sweater?}
<C>__{chip}
<D>__{it's pink.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{pink is cool. rap guys wear pink.}
<A>__{she's shaking now, too. chip leans forward and kisses her. she closes her eyes. in the chaste space between chip and needy's bodies, the volleyball pit couple fuck like rabbits.}
