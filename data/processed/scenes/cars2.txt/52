<A>__{uncle topolino beckons mcqueen over.}
<C>__{uncle topolino}
<D>__{you look so down, so low. is like you have flat tires.}
<A>__{mama topolino, a hefty italian grandmother pipes up, a mile a minute then drives off, now a car on a mission.}
<C>__{uncle topolino}
<D>__{she said you look like you're starving. that she's going to make you a big meal, and fatten you up.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{no, mama topolino, please. you don't need to make a fuss!}
<A>__{too late. she's disappeared inside her kitchen.}
<C>__{uncle topolino}
<D>__{capisco. i understand. is a problem, yes? between you and a friend?}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{how'd you know that?}
<C>__{uncle topolino}

<C>__{uncle topolino}
<D>__{that, and luigi told me. while mama cooks, come and take a stroll with me.}
<A>__{they amble forward, uncle topolino setting the pace.}

<D>__{this mater. he's a close friend?}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{he's my best friend.}
<C>__{uncle topolino}

<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{what did i do? i said some things during our fight...}
<C>__{uncle topolino}
<D>__{you know, back when guido and luigi used to work for me, they would fight over everything.}
<A>__{in the square guido dances with a girl. luigi suddenly cuts in. they begin to argue.}
<C>__{uncle topolino}
<D>__{they fight over what ferrari was the best ferrari; which one of them look more like a ferrari... there were even some non ferrari fights.}
<A>__{guido now lifts luigi, cuts back in.}
<C>__{uncle topolino}
<D>__{so i tell them, va bene. it's okay to fight. everybody fights now and then, especially best friends.}
<A>__{mcqueen takes this in. seems to take some small comfort.}
<C>__{uncle topolino}
<D>__{but you gotta make up fast.}
<A>__{mcqueen's comfort quickly evaporates.}
<C>__{uncle topolino}
<D>__{no fight more important than friendship.}
<A>__{guido and luigi now dance together with the girl and her friend who has just arrived. all having a great time. they dance past us, crossing in front of mcqueen and uncle topolino. we stay with them.}

<D>__{whoever find a friend, find a treasure.}
<A>__{mama topolino drops a tray of food in front of mcqueen.}
<C>__{mama topolino}
<D>__{now, mangia! eat!}
<A>__{on mcqueen, distant, taking all of this in, lost in thought as, in the background, uncle topolino and mama topolino talk, then argue, then make up (all in italian) all while we stay on mcqueen's pensive face }
