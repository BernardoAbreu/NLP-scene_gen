<L>__{exterior premiere dusk}
<A>__{the premiere for "eternity forever" is everything viktor had hoped for "sunrise, sunset". red carpet, klieg lights searching the sky, screaming fans and paparazzi. a limousine pulls up, door opens and viktor steps out. the crowd screams with excitement. viktor waves. am expectancy in the crowd people crane their necks, waiting for someone else to step out of the open car door... but nothing. the door shuts. a disappointed murmer. the limo drives off. viktor walks down the carpet to little fanfare.}

<P>__{(talking to camera)}
<D>__{ what a night! anyone who's anyone is here at the premiere of "eternity forever," but waiting for simone to show may take even longer. we do have her director, viktor taransky.}

<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(slightly irritated by the focus on the star)}
<D>__{you know simone.}
<A>__{other reporters force their way into the interview.}

<C>__{premiere reporter 2}
<D>__{there's a rumor that you're more than just "good friends"?}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(slightly irritated by the invasion)}
<D>__{we've been seeing each other, sure, but we'd rather keep our relationship private.}
<C>__{premiere reporter 2}
<P>__{(believing she has a scoop)}
<D>__{do i hear the sound of... wedding bells?}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(suddenly losing it)}
<D>__{i can't believe you people! no wonder she never comes to these things!}
<A>__{harry angrily pushes the camera away and strides up the carpet. viktor watches him go, flabbergasted.}
