<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{punk #1 is attempting to strap the basket onto the motorcycle with a bungie cord. punk #2 watches him coolly.}
<D>__{punk #2 we'd be better off taking the subway. punk #1 you want to ride the subway with a hundred grand in uncut dope, go ahead. punk #2 well we can't ride around carrying this baby basket. we'll get stopped by the cops. punk #1 so go ahead, take the subway and stop bothering me. i'm going to hook this onto the back seat. punk #2 it'll never hold, man. punk #1}
<P>__{(desperately going}
<D>__{at the hook and}
<P>__{the basket)}
<D>__{goddamn hook! christ, what a stupid idea hiding the shit with this kid. it's ridiculous!}
<A>__{peter comes rushing out of the building.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(huffing and puffing)}
<D>__{oh, thank god, you're still here! there's been a terrible mistake. that wasn't the package you were s'posed to take. it was another one. i have it right here. punk #1 what do you mean? what other package?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i will take the basket back and give you the other package, here. no mistake.}
<A>__{peter takes the package from his pocket and is about to grab the basket. punk #1 pushes him back violently.}
<D>__{punk #1 you ain't takin' nothin' back, man.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{but i'm tellin you it was a mistake... punk #1}
<P>__{(in a low but very aggressive tone)}
<D>__{you tryin' to double cross us or something? beat it before i get pissed, man.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(panic stricken,}
<D>__{in an equally}
<P>__{low tone)}
<D>__{but i'm telling you, i've got your package right here. there's been a mistake... punk #1 a mistake my ass! now get outa here, man, or i'm gonna stick this right in your gut.}
<A>__{he discreetly reveals a switchblade knife he's carrying.}
<D>__{punk #1}
<P>__{(to punk #2)}
<D>__{start the bike.}
<A>__{punk #2 is about to get on the motorcycle. peter stops him.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{but i'm telling you, i've got the real package in my pocket. punk #2}
<P>__{(to punk #1)}
<D>__{watch it, the cops!}
<A>__{peter quickly puts back the package in his pocket. a patrol car comes up next to them, right beside the car in which graton is sitting, taking in every bit of the action.}
<C>__{graton}
<P>__{(to his partner)}
<D>__{terrific! i bet these morons screw up everything.}
<A>__{one of the cops gets out of his car and comes over to the punks and peter. peter is scared stiff.}
<D>__{punk #1}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{if you called the cops on us, pal, you're a dead man. cop #1 all right, what's that doing on the back of the bike?}
<A>__{no one answers.}
<D>__{cop #1 you wouldn't by any chance be intending to drive with a baby basket on your motorcycle, would you? punk #1 of course not, officer. we'd never do something like that. cop #1 so why did you strap it on in the first place if you had no intention of driving with it? punk #2 so it wouldn't fall off. cop #1 very funny.}
<A>__{as he speaks, peter undoes the bungie cord from around the basket and takes it off the motorcycle.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{no, really, officer, they weren't gonna drive off with it they were just watching it for me while i was doing a quick errand.}
<P>__{(to the punks)}
<D>__{thanks, guys.}
<A>__{punk #1 gives him a dirty look.}
<D>__{cop #1 all right, let's see some identification, everybody.}
<A>__{the punks exchange a glance. suddenly punk #1 shouts:}
<D>__{punk #1 go!}
<A>__{they take off running in different directions. cop #1 charges after punk #1 and yells to his partner who's still in the car:}
<D>__{cop #1 watch the guy with the basket!}
<A>__{cop #2 leaps out of the car, gun in hand. peter stiffens with fear.}
<D>__{cop #2 freeze! all right, asshole, let's see some i.d.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(urbanely)}
<D>__{listen, officer, let's stay calm now. i haven't the slightest intention of running. i am not a criminal. i'm an architect. cop #2}
<P>__{(calming down a little)}
<D>__{your i.d., let's see it.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i'm terribly sorry, officer, but i don't have any identification on me. i just came down with my baby to run a quick errand. i haven't committed any crime. cop #2 all right, let's go, in the car. i'm taking you down to the station.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{oh, c'mon, that's impossible you see i have a baby. i have to give her a bottle in fifteen minutes, i can't go anywhere. i live right in this building let me go up to my apartment and i will get you my license immediately... you can even come with me if you like... cop #2 all right, lead the way.}
<A>__{they disappear inside the building. peter is carrying the basket in his left hand; his right hand is clenched on the horrible package hidden in his pocket. just then cop #1 comes running back, empty handed. graton gets out of his car and comes up to cop #1, show ing him his badge.}
<C>__{graton}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{inspector graton, narcotics. it just so happens i was tailing those two guys and now because of you clowns i lost them, probably forever. thanks a lot! cop #1 how could we know?}
<C>__{graton}
<D>__{forget it. listen, your partner went in here with the guy and the baby. he lives up on the tenth floor. i can't go in because if he sees me, my cover is blown. so could you please try not to lose this one, okay? he's someone who's gotta be watched very closely. i've called for backup and it's on its way.}
