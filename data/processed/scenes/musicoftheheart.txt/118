<L>__{interior roberta's brownstone living room night}
<A>__{roberta is vacuuming the living room while assunta dusts. extra chairs are set up in the living room in preparation for a meeting. the doorbell rings.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{someone's early.}
<A>__{follow assunta to the door. she opens it, revealing janet, who's carrying two bags of groceries. assunta's demeanor instantly cools when she sees her. in the b.g. roberta sees janet and turns off the vacuum cleaner.}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{hello, assunta. how are you?}
<C>__{assunta}
<D>__{i'd be a lot better if my daughter had a job next year.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{ma!}
<C>__{janet}
<P>__{(to assunta)}
<D>__{i would too.}
<A>__{janet briskly walks into the living room, puts the grocery bags down on a table, and begins to take things out of them. roberta watches her, mystified.}
<C>__{janet}
<P>__{(to roberta)}
<D>__{sorry i'm early, but i figured we'd need time to set up.}
<A>__{roberta watches janet for a beat, then addresses assunta.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{mama, why don't you take allegra out for a walk?}
<A>__{assunta hesitates for a beat, then gets the dog and exits. janet continues unpacking the bags as if there's nothing unusual about her being there. cheeses, crackers, bread, salads, fruit, paper plates, napkins, etc. she sees roberta's confused expression.}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{you are having a meeting here tonight, right? parents and teachers?}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{well, yes, but ...}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{take it from me. if you want to get parents to help you with something, you have to feed them.}
<A>__{she holds up two wedges of cheese.}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{you have a cutting board for these?}
<A>__{roberta crosses into the kitchen and returns with a cutting board and a knife.}
<C>__{janet}
<P>__{(as she continues to unpack)}
<D>__{and if you think parents are bad, teachers are even worse, no offense. if you don't feed them, you never get anything extra out of them. that's why i got this.}
<A>__{she pulls out an entenmann's blackout cake.}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{entenmann's gets them every time.}
<A>__{roberta continues to stare in amazement at janet.}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{what? don't tell me you expected me to bring something homemade.}
<C>__{roberta}
<P>__{(as she takes the cake from her)}
<D>__{well, no... i }
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{good. because take it from me my own family begs me to stay out of the kitchen.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{what i didn't expect was for you to be here.}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{why not? we've gotta figure out a way to fight this.}
<P>__{(as she arranges crackers on a plate)}
<D>__{after ten years, roberta, i can't imagine walking through those hallways and not hearing that off key, screechy, scratchy, nails on the blackboard violin music.}
<A>__{roberta smiles. janet holds up a baguette.}
<C>__{janet}
<D>__{what do you think? cut it into slices now, or leave it whole?}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{let's cut it now. it'll be less messy.}
<A>__{janet hands her the bread. a beat as the two women exchange a private smile, then return to their respective tasks.}
