<L>__{exterior temple grounds day 120 (spring time)}
<B>__{tight shot of american football spinning through the air.}
<A>__{set against a deep blue sky, it could be spinning anywhere but the camera pulls back to reveal the shaolin temple "forest of stupa", where the disciples are having a pick up football game it's sunday, the disciples' afternoon off. the football spins into the hands of gao, who drops it. drew runs over, showing gao how to catch the ball, and how to make the cuts he has to make (no dialogue, music over). gao follows drew's instructions, then they run the play. this time gao is all alone and he catches the ball easily for a touchdown. drew runs up and high fives gao, then teaches him how to spike the ball. they are playing some more, having a great time. this time drew goes out for a pass, with gao playing defense. li throws the pass, and gao intercepts. drew, laughing, goes after gao.}
<B>__{angle on drew}
<A>__{who goes long for a pass, which gao lets fly. it is immediately obvious that it is way too long.}
<B>__{angle on san de}
<A>__{who is walking along through the stupa, meditating as he walks.}
<B>__{angle on drew}
<A>__{who stops running and sees san de. the ball is going towards san de.}
<B>__{angle on san de}
<A>__{the ball is heading right for his head! angle on drew, gao and others they are bracing for the impact, and the trouble it will cause.}
<B>__{angle on san de}
<A>__{who at the last moment turns and catches the ball like a professional receiver. he holds the ball and looks right at drew, a very stern look on his face.}
<B>__{angle on drew}
<A>__{expecting the worst.}
<B>__{angle on san de}
<A>__{his stern face now taking on a mischevious look. he hefts the ball and puts his fingers on the laces.}
<C>__{san de}
<D>__{go long.}
<A>__{drew pauses for a moment, not sure what san de said, until san de motions with his left hand, like a nfl quarterback, for drew to go out. he takes off sprinting, with gao covering him like a blanket. san de throws the ball to him in a perfect spiral, to a spot where gao has no play on the throw, and drew catches it in stride. san de immediately returns to his meditation, while drew and the others stand around dumbstruck.}
