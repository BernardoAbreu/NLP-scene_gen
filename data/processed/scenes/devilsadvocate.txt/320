<L>__{interior milton's apartment night}
<A>__{the room's only light coming from the huge bas relief. kevin steps off the elevator, into the room.}
<C>__{milton }
<D>__{you're right about one thing... i have been watching. couldn't help myself. watching, waiting, holding my breath. but i'm no puppeteer, kevin...}
<A>__{milton appears out of nowhere. walking past kevin.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{... i don't make things happen. doesn't work like that. free will it's like butterfly wings one touch and it never gets off the ground. i only set the stage. you pull your own strings.}
<A>__{kevin has a gun cullen's gun, in his hand }
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{what did you do to mary ann?}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{a gun? in here?}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{what did you do to my wife?}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{on a scale of one to ten, ten being the most depraved acts of sexual theater, one being an average friday night run through at the lomax household, i'd say...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{six.}
<A>__{kevin fires the gun bang! bang! bang! bullets pass right through him into the wall }
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{whoa... got me! damn!}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{that's my boy. step on up! stay angry! keep hold to that great fury! hang on tight, kevin, because it's the final fig leaf.}
<A>__{kevin lowers the gun to his side.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{never lost a case. why? why? because you're so fucking good? yes. but why?}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{because you're my father.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{well, i'm a little more than that. awful hot in that courtroom, wasn't it? 'what's the game plan, kevin?'}
<P>__{(reporter's voice)}
<D>__{'it was a nice run, kevin. had to close out someday.'}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{i have so many names.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{satan.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{call me dad.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{mary ann, barzoon, weaver...}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{come on. you're not listening. blaming me for mary ann? i hope you're kidding. you could've saved her any time you liked. she only wanted love. but you knew it wouldn't really work out, didn't you? mary ann in new york? face it, you started looking to better deal her the minute you got here.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{that's a lie.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{hey, it's not that you didn't care for her, it's just you were a little bit more involved with someone else. yourself.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{what the hell do you know about love?}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{bio chemically no different than eating large quantities of chocolate.}
<P>__{(sharply now)}
<D>__{don't be such a fucking chump. there's only one real sickness in all of creation and that is self delusion. i told you to take care of your wife that the world would understand. and you made a choice. 'you know what scares me, john? i leave the case, she gets better and i hate her for it...' remember?}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{you set me up. it's entrapment.}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{who told you to pull out the stops for mr. gettys? and moyez the direction you took snake handlers, popes and swamis all feeding at the same trough whose ideas were those? and then cullen knowing he's guilty seeing those pictures putting that lying bitch on the stand... what did i say, kevin? maybe it was time to lose, right? you didn't think so.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{that's my job. that's what i do!}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{exactly!}
<P>__{(gotcha)}
<D>__{vanity is definitely my favorite sin. self love. it's so basic. what a drug. cheap, all natural, and right at your fingertips. pride. that's where you're strongest. and believe me, i understand. work for someone else? hey, i couldn't hack it. 'better to reign in hell than serve in heaven.'}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{what do you want from me?}
<C>__{milton}
<D>__{what do i want? i want you to be yourself!}
