<L>__{interior kurtz headquarters night}
<A>__{view from inside willard approaches the stakes with the shrunken heads. chef and lance with him. willard steps in lance and the chef crouch outside, waiting.}
<L>__{241 willard's view}
<A>__{an austere stone savern in the temple: kurtz's head quarters. electric lights hanging in odd contrast to the ancient stone. we see what is left of the maps and other military charts they had been tacked up on big boards, but have now fallen into decayed disuse. there are other indications of the modern headquarters this had been. now all those things are no longer impor tant. kurtz sits alone, slumped back in a wicker chair. there is a large wooden planning table next to him, with maps, lamps and apile of debris that is practically garbage. there are native decorations to ward off evil spirits; and graffiti on the stone walls, things ranging fromm "viet nam, love it or leave it" to quotes of nietzsche "nothing is true everything is permitted." moonby, who had been crouching in a corner, moves to willard.}
<C>__{moonby}
<D>__{he's asleep don't bother him.}
<C>__{kurtz}
<D>__{i'm awake.}
<A>__{willard steps in closer. kurtz looks to moonby.}
<C>__{kurtz}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you. get out.}
<A>__{moonby hesitates not wanting to leave him alone with willard.}
<C>__{kurtz}
<P>__{(continuing; suddenly)}
<D>__{i said get the fuck out !}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{i'm going to kill the little weirdo myself tomorrow.}
<P>__{(he shows some pain}
<D>__{when moving his}
<P>__{midsection)}
<D>__{he s only stayed alive this long because he's a good orderly and medic. he knows how to use a hypodermic.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{you're gonna get hit tonight, bad a whole regiment of nva regulars.}
<C>__{kurtz}
<D>__{that's right, the little gook pricks. but they are noble little gook pricks, noble. because they fight with their guts, like animals. and for an idea ! that's rich. we fight with ingenious machines and fire, like gods, and for nothing. but i will call in a major blotto airstrike tonight. we'll have ourselves a helluva airstrike tonight, a lightshow. how do you like the doors': 'c'mon baby light my fire...'}
<A>__{willard shrugs.}
<C>__{kurtz}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{do you?}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{yeah, i like it...}
<C>__{kurtz}
<D>__{i love it.}
<A>__{he rests back, grinning.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{you've gone crazy.}
<C>__{kurtz}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{no. my thinking is clear.}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{but my soul has gone mad.}
<A>__{suddenly kurtz is seized with a terrible pain from his stomach wound. he groans horribly, clutching at it. he literally falls from his chair onto the dirt floor.}
<C>__{kurtz}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{my gut oh, christ, my gut !}
<A>__{willard leans over him; checking the seriousness of the wound.}
