<A>__{post dinner. vicki's got a sheaf of photos spread out on the table in front of bruce shots of gotham's homeless, being forcibly evicted from slum dwellings, erecting their shantytowns in gotham park.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{they're already razing the tenements and sro's downtown. these people don't have anyplace else to go.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{if the city starts selling off the park...}
<A>__{bruce takes a good long look at his opulent surroundings. huge windows open on a serene and picturesque view of the park; campfires flicker in the distance...}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{ yeah. i guess i will pass on dessert.}
<C>__{vicki}
<P>__{(taking his hand)}
<D>__{bruce, you do a lot more than most people even dream of.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{sure. comes off the top of my taxes }
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{that's not what i meant.}
<A>__{they exchange a long silent look. of course she's referring to batman. still, the argument doesn't hold much water with}
<B>__{bruce.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{ what i "do" doesn't come close to the root of the problem, vicki.}
<P>__{(long pause)}
<D>__{i'm just a band aid.}
<C>__{voice from behind}
<D>__{bruce! it's been ages!}
<A>__{vicki turns and rapidly closes her photo folder. millionaire construction magnate randall shaw is in the restaurant table hopping, and he's just glommed onto bruce.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{randall. you remember vicki. how's the construction business?}
<C>__{shaw}
<D>__{the park tower? all systems go. if we can get the junkies and winos cleared out...}
<P>__{(a big grin)}
<D>__{not too late to get in on the deal.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i will think about it.}
<C>__{shaw}
<D>__{say, walter barrett's due back from europe. we should all get together at the club.}
<P>__{(clapping him on the shoulder)}
<D>__{nice to see you again, miss veal.}
<A>__{"miss veal" maintains a big phony smile as shaw moves off to the next table. she murmurs to bruce through clenched teeth:}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{what a pig.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i've known him since he was seven years old. he was a pig then too.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{now he wants to gobble up the park...}
<P>__{(shivering)}
<D>__{bruce isn't there something you can do about people like that?}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{what, tie him up with a bat rope?}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{no, you idiot. i meant you. bruce.}
<A>__{bruce nods oh, yeah. subtle distinction.}
