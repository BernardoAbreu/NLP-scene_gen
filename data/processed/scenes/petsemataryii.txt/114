<L>__{interior bathroom morning}
<A>__{chase is bare chested at the mirror, applying a dressing to the dog bite on his shoulder. marjorie appears in the doorway with a basket of laundry. she stops short at the sight of chase standing there in his boxers. chase catches her reflection in the mirror and is startled.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{i didn't mean to... i was going to empty the hamper...}
<A>__{chase turns, shaking off the scare.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{it's okay.}
<A>__{marjorie's eyes can't help but fix on the dog bites scattered over chase's chest and arms.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{what happened to you?}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{i had a little run in with zowie.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{you sure did...}
<A>__{marjorie sets the laundry aside.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{here, let me do that...}
<A>__{marjorie looks over the antiseptics chase has laid out on the sink. saturating a wad of gauze with hydrogen peroxide, she gently cleanses the gashes on his arms. there's nothing overtly sexual in her actions, but the gentleness of her touch doesn't go unnoticed by chase.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{i hope he doesn't have rabies.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{he doesn't. i don't know what he has, but i'm hoping to god it's not infectious...}
<A>__{chase stops and looks at marjorie's reflection in the mirror.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{marjorie... what do you know about the creed murders?}
<A>__{marjorie stiffens for a moment. obviously the creeds are a sore spot for the people in this town.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{did you ever play that game where you pass a story down a row of people and see how screwed up it gets by the time it's done? people say louis creed's son came back from the dead and it drove him crazy...}
<P>__{(she rolls her eyes)}
<D>__{he killed his wife and himself, and that's the end of story. anything else belongs in the national enquirer.}
<A>__{marjorie tapes the bandage over chase's shoulder too tight. chase's groan snaps her back to the reality at hand.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{sorry. now tell me what that has to do with zowie?}
<A>__{chase closes his eyes, shutting out the pain.}
<C>__{chase}
<D>__{i wish i knew.}
