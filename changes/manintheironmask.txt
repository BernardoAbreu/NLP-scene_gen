<ACTION>__{From the BLACKNESS before the first images, we hear a young woman's tortured SCREAM, muffled by her own will.  We see her mouth, open in agony; her face, beaded with sweat.  Her name is ANNE, and she is Queen of France.  She lies in}
<ACTION_ALT>__{A ROYAL BEDCHAMBER}
<ACTION>__{The royal DOCTOR kneels at the foot of her bed; her own royal mother grips her hands... On the opposite side of the huge bedchamber, and separated from the queen's bed by an artistically painted screen, are royal ADVISORS sweating and anxious for any word to take to their king.  They wince as the Queen moans again in the pain of childbirth. Her fingers claw out for help, but her Doctor ignores her need to be touched and comforted; he is concerned only for the baby.  Only her PRIEST, FATHER BELLES, sits at her head, stroking her hair gently and rapidly whispering prayers.}

<TRANS>__{SMASH TO:}
<ACTION>__{A DARK COURTYARD - NIGHT A door groans open in a hidden corner of the palace courtyard and into the darkness steps a dashing figure.  His face is hidden in shadow, but we know from the silhouette of his cloak and plumed hat that he is a MUSKETEER. He carries an OBLONG BASKET. A carriage is just rattling onto the flagstones of the courtyard.  The Musketeer steps into its interior, with a sharp word to the driver --}

<ACTION>__{On a gash of rock thrusting upward from the sea along the southern coast of France stands an island fortress, a prison, like an Alcatraz of the Mediterranean.  Just off a coastline renowned for its beauty, the fortress is horrible and foreboding.  As we SUPERIMPOSE:}

<LOC>__{INT.  THE FORTRESS PRISON}
<ACTION>__{With the camera as our moving POV, we survey the prison.  It is a horrible place:  dungeons where prisoners lie in their own filth; corners where jailers rut with unresisting captive women; long twisting corridors lined with cells, from which prisoners whimper, or moan in madness.  Up a long winding staircase our POV moves; we push through the barred window of a cell... It is somewhat cleaner than the rest of the places we've seen, but still a prison.  We PAN the cell. And we see a man.  A MAN IN AN IRON MASK.  It is terrifying, to think of anyone imprisoned in this way.  We push in on his eyes... They are blue, childlike. A greasy jailer -- the prisoner's KEEPER -- puts his face to the barred window of the door, and speaks with bored cruelty.}

<ACTION>__{Through the narrow streets of the old city gallops a dashing figure, his cloak flying behind him and catching the moonlight, his horse's hooves clattering along the cobblestones as he dodges the beggars living in the filthy shadows.  He is a magnetic sight, riding the horse as easily as if they were racing across an open field and not through a cluttered street, and guiding the stallion as if its grace and power came not from the animal but from the rider. Sitting lightly in the saddle is D'ARTAGNAN famous Musketeer, Captain of the King's Royal Bodyguard.  He is still handsome at mid-life, still erect, unambiguous in his courage and his loyalty. He rides past a knot of angry beggars, moving through the streets breaking windows and scavenging for food.  When they see d'Artagnan, some throw rocks at him.  They sail by d'Artagnan's head; he ducks them with the fluid grace of a boxer dodging punches, and keeps on riding.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{OUTSIDE THE CATHEDRAL}
<ACTION>__{D'Artagnan rides into the courtyard of a grand old residence beside Notre Dame Cathedral.  Priests are dispensing food to beggars gathered in the courtyard.  As d'Artagnan reins his horse to a stop the wretched people stare with contempt at the royal symbols on his uniform.  But d'Artagnan is not a man anyone would be quick to confront; as he dismounts and moves toward the doorways the people part for him. He pauses as he sees, parked to one side of the old residence, a big rickety carriage.  D'Artagnan smiles.}

He and the women are drinking wine as they stagger up the stairs, the women towing Porthos like rowboats tugging a ship to dock.  Porthos is not so drunk that his hands fail to find pleasant places to grip their bodies as they walk and giggle.}

He opens a small wooden box and digs through medals of heroism; he finds what he's looking for just as his son RAOUL enters.  RAOUL is in his mid-twenties; he wears the uniform of a soldier in the French Army.  He is nervous, pacing, looking at every angle in the mirror.}

Common Jesuit priests try to act as my equals, and they refuse to reveal the names of anyone else in their order!  No one can keep secrets like the Jesuits can, and the identity of their leader is the darkest secret they hold.  Even the Pope himself does not know who leads the Jesuit Order in France!  He suspects the Governor General of Jesuits, whoever he is, is angling to become Pope himself.}

Raoul returns the ring to his jacket, to wait for another moment. Everyone watches the King, who begins guzzling wine and telling jokes to his sycophants, who howl at the King's witticisms.

THE PIG CHASE is a merry melee, as the maze becomes a tangle of confusion.  LOUIS climbs to a platform above the top of the ten foot hedge that forms the maze.  From his perch he looks down on all the action, and calls encouragement.}

<ACTION>__{Her eyes go still; she understands what is happening. FROM BEHIND THE GATE, we see d'Artagnan, watching as Louis tries to seduce the young woman.  Even as d'Artagnan watches, the pig comes rooting through the hedge; with a deft movement d'Artagnan catches the animal's leg and lifts it with the sureness of the farm boy he once was.  The pig is quiet and comfortable in d'Artagnan's hands. D'Artagnan watches as the King approaches Michelle, and she allows him to touch her cheek.  The king leans to kiss her... Michelle does not move... WHHEEEKKKK!  The pig sails over the gate and hits the ground running, right at Louis' feet; it sets him dancing. The spell of the king's royal attention is shattered; as the pig scrambles away, Michelle backs away.}

It is the servant who offered the tray to Raoul and Michelle; he has armed himself with a knife from the carving table, and is diving now to plunge the blade into the king's throat. The king is helpless, frozen.  The assassin leaps, falling toward the king... and is impaled on the sword of d'Artagnan, springing through the gate to save his king. Michelle screams, the king gasps, and the assassin drops, mortally wounded.  They stare down at him now; the would-be assassin gurgles words through his agony...}

He seems to have made it; people glance -- dancing ladies, young Musketeers, old advisors -- but no one gives him a second look.  For a moment, Phillippe feels safe. And then he sees Michelle, her eyes glassy and riveted upon him.  She wears her most beautiful gown -- the first one Louis gave her -- but one shoulder strap dangles sloppily. Her lips and cheeks are awkwardly rouged, her hair is mussed; she is drunk.  She weaves her way to him and curtsies elaborately.}

Phillippe realizes his blunder; they've caught him. The MUSIC STOPS.  But the attention is not directed at the throne; all eyes shift to the main doorway, where Anne has appeared.  She is indescribably beautiful; she wears a bright gown, her hair is brushed and bejeweled, she radiates the light of a woman who felt old at thirty and who has discovered, at forty, that she is more stunning than ever. Her arrival draws even more attention than the reappearance of the King; everyone watches transfixed as she approaches. Phillippe sees her -- his mother.  He stands on legs that seem to have no bones.  His mother. She moves to him, her eyes filling with tears.  When she is almost to the throne, Phillippe falls to his knees before her and kisses her hand. No one can believe it, not from this King.  Yet the moment strikes them as beautiful, and they applaud happily. Phillippe and the Queen Mother rise, and guide each other -- depending on each other for support, to a seat, he on the throne, she on a seat the servants place beside him. Phillippe gives a wave.}
