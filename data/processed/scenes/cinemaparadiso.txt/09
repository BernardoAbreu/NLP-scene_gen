<L>__{exterior alfredo's house afternoon}
<A>__{good friday. alfredo comes out of his house, leaning on salvatore's shoulder. they go off down the street, towards the church. salvatore has finished recounting his misadventure.}
<C>__{alfredo}
<D>__{i told you, the blue eyed ones are the most difficult.}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{but why? there must be some way to make her understand!}
<C>__{alfredo}
<D>__{don't think about it, toto. don't even try. with feelings, there's nothing to understand.}
<A>__{salvatore gives an angry gesture. this time alfredo's words do not quiet his frenzy, don't help him. he moves away from him a few steps. alfredo stands there motionless in the middle of the road.}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{stop it! i've had enough of your sermons! you act as if you created the world!}
<P>__{(a bicycle streaks by}
<D>__{alfredo, who gives a startled jump, as if it were about to run into him. he raises his voice, panic }
<P>__{stricken.)}
<C>__{alfredo}
<D>__{heeey! totooooo! don't get pissed off with me now! come here! i don't know where the fuck i have to go.}
<P>__{(a man on a bicycle almost}
<D>__{collides with alfredo. salvatore fumes, goes over to him listlessly. alfredo puts his hand back on his shoulder and they start walking again. alfredo has calmed down, but his voice}
<P>__{is determined.)}
<D>__{and the next time be careful how you talk. not to take credit away from the lord, but if i had created the world, in all modesty, certain things would have come out better. but unfortunately such was not the case.}
<C>__{salvatore}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{you see, it s like i say. you always have an answer for everything.}
<C>__{alfredo}
<D>__{i want to make you happy, toto! i'm going to tell you a story.}
<P>__{(and he squeezes}
<D>__{salvatore's shoulder. it's the signal for taking a rest. they sit in a doorway. alfredo starts telling his story, and his way of speaking is hypnotic, magical. with those eyes lost in empty space, it's as if his thoughts and his words came in from some other dimension, mysterious,}
<P>__{hidden...)}
<D>__{once upon a time a king gave a feast and there were all the most beautiful princesses of the realm. basta, one of the guards, saw the king's daughter: she was the loveliest of all! and he immediately fell in love with her. but what could a poor soldier do compared with a king's daughter?!...one day he managed to meet her and told her he couldn't live without her. the princess was so struck by the depth of his feeling that she said to the soldier 'if you will wait a hundred days and a hundred nights beneath my balcony, then in the end i will be yours.' christ, the soldier ran off there and waited! one day, two days, ten, twenty...every night she looked out of her window, but he never budged. come rain, wind, snow, never budged! the birds shat on him and the bees ate him alive! after ninety nights he was gaunt and pale and tears streamed from his eyes but he couldn't hold them back. he didn't even have the strength to sleep any more. the princess kept watch...and on the ninety ninth night, the soldier got up, picked up his chair and left!}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{no! you mean right at the end?}
<P>__{(salvatore is amazed,}
<D>__{dumbfounded; that ending has made a deep impression. they}
<P>__{start walking again.)}
<C>__{alfredo}
<D>__{that's right, toto, right at the end? and don't ask me what it means. if you figure it out, let me know...}
<C>__{salvatore}
<D>__{i will be damned'}
