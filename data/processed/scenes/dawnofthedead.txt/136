<A>__{as steve charges up the grade he sees the zombie approaching roger from behind. steve shouts and roger spins around. the stumbling creature is very close. it raises its arms and its hands clutch at the air. roger lets the fuel nozzle drop to the ground. he is trapped at the side of the machine. he doesn't have his rifle. he fumbles with the snap on his hand gun holster. suddenly, the blank face of the zombie turns red as the top of its head seems to disintegrate into a bloody pulp. the creature has walked into the spinning chopper blade. its body staggers forward another step or two, then the thing collapses in a heap.}
