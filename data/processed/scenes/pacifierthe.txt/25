<L>__{interior hospital day}
<A>__{shane lies in a hospital bed, despondent. his arm and face bandaged. shane's captain enters: bill fawcett (35) friendly, unassuming. he looks like he hasn't slept in days. shane salutes him with his bandaged arm it hurts to salute, but he does it anyway.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{captain, sir.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{as you were lieutenant.}
<A>__{bill sits down beside the bed. he takes a long look at shane. he holds a report in his hand.}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{we've been through a lot together shane. you're the best man i ever trained. and a good friend.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{... i know sir. and i except full responsibility for the mission's failure.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{why the hell did you let him use the satellite phone?}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{he had to call his family. a lapse in judgement on my part that i regret sir.}
<A>__{bill shakes his head, disappointed. he pulls up a chair, and sits opposite shane.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{... plummer was the best security expert the department of defense ever had a genius. he was working on a program that scrambles launch codes. he called it g.h.o.s.t.: guided high altitude scrambling transmitter. one pulse from the ghost satellite and a country can't launch its own nukes. that's what the serbians kidnapped him for, but they couldn't get s inside the briefcase.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{the case was empty sir, as i stated in my report.}
<A>__{bill considers this. then...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{not a surprise, really. not like the professor to hide things where someone might look for them. g.h.o.s.t. is still out there, (bill smiles:) which is why i'm going to give you another shot.}
<A>__{shane sits up. he can't believe his good fortune.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{sir. thank you. i... appreciate your confidence.}
<A>__{invigorated, he pulls off bandages, disconnects an iv, and starts to rise.}
<C>__{shane }
<D>__{i will need to put a team together. i'm gonna need the mini sub, i need access to an ep3 aries 2 spy plane...}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(interrupting:)}
<D>__{negative. it's not that kind of mission.}
<A>__{shane listens, intrigued.}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{two days ago, i got a call from the professor's wife... widow. she told me someone had broken into her home. searched the place, top to bottom.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{she's scared. the family's scared. whoever killed the professor must think g.h.o.s.t. is in that house. maybe it is, maybe it isn't. either way, i need someone to stay at that house, and protect them. and while you're there find out if the program is in there.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{that's it? why would you want me for that, sir.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{the professor's wife requested you.}
<A>__{shane is surprised... bill pulls a tiny tape recorder from his pocket, presses play, we hear professor plummer's voice.}
<C>__{charles }
<D>__{honey, i'm alive. listen: a lot can happen between here and home if anything happens to me, call lt. shane wolfe. he's a good man... anyway, i should go. i will call you in an hour. i love you.}
<A>__{shane is shocked, hearing the dead man's voice.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{... you gotta problem with this mission?}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{sirnosir. it's just that... i've never been very good with kids, sir. not even when i was a kid sir.}
