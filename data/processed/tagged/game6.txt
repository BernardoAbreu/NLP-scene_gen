<L>__{interior loft apartment manhattan morning}
<A>__{steven schwimmer, a drama critic, asleep on his bed. he wears a sleep mask.}
<L>__{2}
<A>__{the bed is a mattress on a makeshift platform. papers strewn on the floor. an exercise bike. a desk with and old manual typewriter, reference works, periodicals, styrofoam cups. a cast off sofa with pants, shirts, sweater, underwear and socks tossed haphazardly on the cushions and arms. a counter that sets apart the kitchen area. a portable tv set on the counter. the remains of dinner for one. a row of stacked cardboard boxes with mail spilling out on the floor. boxes are labeled in crayon: hate mail. a coffee table with a candle nub in a saucer and six gleaming rounds of ammunition scattered next to a llama comanche .357 magnum with a checkered walnut stock overall length, nine and a quarter inches. a port o san toilet, about seven feet high, orange, scarred and dented scavenged from a construction site. a snapshot on the bedside table. it's a blurry picture of steven holding a cat. steven wears a peaked cap, and a shadow falls across his face. next to the picture is a clock radio, which comes on with a buzz as the clock shows nine am. radio announcer begins to speak }
<C>__{lone eagle }
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{traffic flowing smoothly on the deegan right now but if you're lucky enough to have a ticket for tonight's game, be sure to leave early because it's going to be bumper to bumper.}
<A>__{steven does not stir.}
<L>__{exterior loft building}
<A>__{teven's loft is in an old squat building on 47th street near twelfth avenue. the structure looks abandoned. graffiti everywhere. entranceway filled with debris.}
<C>__{lone eagle }
<D>__{another day of traffic. traffic everywhere i look. cars stop and move and stop again. people sit at the wheel thinking their thoughts.}
<L>__{exterior united nations plaza apts morning}
<A>__{the shimmering glass facade of the united nations plaza apartments at 48th street and first avenue. a man visible at a window on one of the high floors, a cup of coffee in his hand.}
<C>__{lone eagle }
<D>__{day in, day out. red light, green light. traffic on the major arteries and traffic in the little veins.}
<A>__{from his pov we see the traffic below creeping along, nearly at a standstill.}
<C>__{lone eagle }
<D>__{cars, vans, taxis, trucks, limos, mopeds, bikes and buses. emergency vehicles screaming and wailing. birth and death, walk and don't walk.}

<C>__{driver}
<D>__{big mess every time.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i loved my taxi. went twelve hours nonstop. stopped only to pee. i peed under the manhattan bridge. peed many times in parks and playgrounds.}
<L>__{exterior street corner 47th street and third avenue. a man is dancing with a life }
<A>__{size cloth doll. his tape player is on the sidewalk, playing and instrumental version of "beautiful dreamer" and there is a cigar box for donations. a few people look on from a distance. the man wearing an old cutaway, with running shoes, and the doll has long red tresses and wears a frilly gown. nicky emerges from a taxi at the corner and walks rapidly past the dancing man. nicky crosses the courtyard to buchanan apartments.}
<L>__{interior foyer}
<A>__{joanna bourne reaching for the door. joanna is fifty ish, handsome, stylishly dressed.}
<L>__{interior buchanan apartment seconds later}
<A>__{nicky and joanna embracing with wordless abandon. they are in the hallway clutching each other, stumbling. the walls on either side are hung with expensive art. they grapple past the living room. fleeting look at the paintings by longo and fischl, a poster by the guerilla girls.}
<B>__{t}
<A>__{he edge of the bedroom. nicky is crawling into the room and joanna is hanging on to him, being dragged. they are fully dressed except for one of joanna's shoes. the bedroom. a lichtenstein, a hockney, a silk screen of joanna by andy warhol. a jeff koons piece. nicky and joanna roll on the floor until they are halfway under the bed.}
<L>__{interior hallway}
<A>__{muffled sounds from the bedroom. we track to: the maid's room. the maid is smoking a cigarette and reading new york magazine. the cover is partly obscured by her hand but we can see a blurry black and white photo of a man hurrying along a street with a newspaper over his face, shielding himself from the camera. over the photo, three words visible: the phantom who a second line of type is too small to be legible.}
<L>__{interior bedroom later}
<A>__{nicky and joanna are undressing after the fact, very slowly and distractedly. joanna stands by a chair near the window. nicky is on the other side of the bed and he alternates between standing and sitting as he takes off his clothes.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{last night. alan albright called me a handsome woman. second time he's done that. son of a bitch.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i hear alan's sick.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{alan's very sick. he has to go to new mexico and sit in a lukewarm solution.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{you know about adele.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{what about her?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{she's dying.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{she died.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i talked to her two days ago.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{apparently it didn't help. you know about peter, of course.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{our peter?}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{peter redmond. they found out why he can't remember his lines. there's something living in his brain. a parasite he picked up in borneo, doing the movie.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{can he get through it?}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{they're watching him closely. there's a special rehearsal set for this afternoon. to bolster his confidence. and that's not all.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i've got bigger problems, joanna. personal problems.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{that's not all, nicky. i've been backing your plays for fifteen years. and i've never been more depressed.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{steven schwimmer. the most powerful critic in america gets his first crack at nicky rogan.}
<C>__{nicky}
<P>__{(hiding his concern)}
<D>__{look. all i want is a haircut. i'm not worried about this guy.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{ever since he started reviewing the broadway theater, nobody in this business has been worried about anything else.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{they can send their heartless brilliant boy critic. there's a much bigger thing going on than tonight's opening.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{the red sox}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{you mean the world series? i thought the red sox were winning.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{three games to two. but if you know their history, you realize there's a tragedy in the making. i've been carrying this franchise on my back since i was six years old.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{it can't be all that personal.}
<A>__{joanna enters the walk in closet to finish undressing and get a nightdress.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{if you have a team you've followed all your life, and they raise your hopes and crush them, and lift them and crush them, do you want me to tell you what it's like? it's like feeling your childhood die over and over. j}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{i mean nicky, really, no.}
<A>__{nicky follows her into the closet, still in his shirt and boxer shorts.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{i'm proud of this play. it's so different from anything you've done.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{this is how we've managed to last.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{we're able to surprise each other.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{in and out of bed.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{because we're completely mismatched.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{we don't even like each other, do we?}
<A>__{nicky walks out of the closet, takes off his shirt, gets into bed.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{i used to tell myself. talent is more erotic when it's wasted. will i see you tonight?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{the red sox blow a chance to win their first world series since 1918. you expect me to miss that for an opening night?}
<A>__{joanna emerges from the closet in her nightdress and gets into bed.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{it makes me so mad. steven schwimmer ready to strike. the exterminating angel.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{it's all worked out. they'll lose tonight. then they'll lose tomorrow. i see it with stunning clarity.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{it's your best play, nicky.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{they'll lose because they're my team.}
<C>__{joanna}
<D>__{he will absolutely hate it.}
<L>__{interior steven schwimmer's loft}
<A>__{steven is just waking up. the radio plays soft music. he reaches over and hits the off button, then activates the cassette player. he struggles out of bed and sufi music begins to fill the room. he stands at the foot of the bed, a man in his mid twenties, hollow chested, slightly potbellied, wearing rumpled pajama bottoms and a mostly mozart t shirt. he does not remove the sleep mask. the music has a sensuous, driving beat. voices begin to chant. steven holds his arms parallel to the floor. slowly he begins to turn, clockwise. the beat picks up and he whirls more quickly, his mouth coming open. now he begins to whirl about the room. the chanting grows in intensity. although he is blindfolded, steve deftly avoids running into furniture and other objects. steven stops whirling at the precise moment the music stops playing. he is back at the foot of the bed, arms stretched wide.}
<L>__{interior taxi}
<A>__{creeping along. nicky leaning toward the driver.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i wrapped my sandwiches in tinfoil. i ate and drove. i had one of those big checkered cabs.}
<C>__{driver}

<D>__{i am sitting here five years in traffic. it is one continuous traffic since i arrive. why must it be?}
<A>__{a taxi pulls up alongside. nicky notices the young woman in the rear seat. it is his daughter laurel. he opens his window.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{laurel, stay there.}
<P>__{(to his driver)}
<D>__{keep the meter running. and try to stay abreast.}
<A>__{nicky leaves his taxi and gets into laurel's.}
<L>__{interior second taxi}
<A>__{nicky pushes in next to her. laurel is eighteen, slightly overweight, with a pleasant and expressive face. she is carrying books in a nylon haversack.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i never see you anymore. where are you all day?}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{i go to college. i thought you knew.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{do you want to get some coffee?}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{i don't drink coffee, daddy. and this is not what we should be talking about.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{what do you want to talk about? i will talk about anything. what's this?}
<A>__{nicky lifts a small radio and headset out of her bag.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{i'm seeing your play tonight, remember?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{why do you need a radio?}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{so at the intermission i can listen to the ball game. do you know that mother is seeing a prominent divorce lawyer?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{that's completely crazy.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{is it?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{don't talk like that. how prominent? what are you implying?}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{she's doing like those iranians. `i divorce thee. i divorce thee. i divorce thee'}
<C>__{nicky}
<P>__{(indicating driver)}
<D>__{and he hears it the same time i hear it? what happened to family secrets?}
<A>__{driver's nameplate }
<C>__{tabattabi}
<C>__{abulhassan}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{mother is totally, you know, upset.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{abulhassas, we'll be getting out here.}
<A>__{nicky pays the driver.}

<L>__{interior coffee shop 47th street between first and second avenue.}
<A>__{nicky and laurel enter the coffee shop they are greeted by the owner, a hefty greek named george.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{nicky, you don't come in for a while. everything's okay?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{hello george. you're so healthy and thick bodied i want to punch you in the chest. this is my daughter laurel. just to hear the sound it makes.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i saw your picture in the paper. two papers.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{that means they're getting ready to kill me.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{that's not what i hear. i have four, five actors working here. `his best play since "yessiree bob" i'm telling you, they say it.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{he doesn't want to hear it.}
<A>__{he leads them toward a booth.}
<L>__{interior coffee shop later}
<A>__{nicky is launched into a full breakfast. laurel has a tea bag in a cup no water.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{if lawyers for the mob are called controversial, why are divorce lawyers called prominent?}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{because they get outstanding settlements. and mother is determined that this time there's no turning back.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i just had breakfast with her. she didn't say a word about this.}
<A>__{a young waiter recognizes nicky and unobtrusively points him out to another waiter.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{because you refuse to believe she's serious. you've always refused.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{don't be so steely eyed. it's that course you're taking in criminology.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{oh please. not now.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{she wants you to stop seeing what's her name. finally. now and forever. do you think that's too much to ask? for a wife of nineteen years.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{you're too young to be studying criminal behavior. it's making you obsessive.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{she is kicking you out.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{your mother and i have something between us that's too strong to damage permanently. believe me, i know this. that's right, nineteen years. and what about the days and minutes? sharing small moments, sharing memories, raising a beautiful child. we're wedded in the deepest and strongest ways. lillian isn't only my wife. she's my best friend.}
<A>__{nicky shrugs.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{bullshit, daddy.}
<L>__{interior coffee shop near the cash register later}
<A>__{nicky and laurel stand on a short line at the cash register, each holding a check.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. she's embarrassed to tell me. so why don't you tell me?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{don't call her mother all the time. it makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. what happened to mom?}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{i didn't turn her into mother. you did.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{this person and i are a thing of the total past. i promise you.}
<A>__{nicky takes laurel's check away from her, intending to pay himself. laurel snatches it back.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{know what mother said to me? daddy's demons are so intense he doesn't even know he's lying.}
<L>__{exterior the street}
<A>__{bank towers. the bank of india, banco di napoli, bear stearns, the bank of new york, the chemical bank, manufacturers hanover. a sense of real institutions looming over the busy street. the bank names engraved on bronze markers, carved in granite, incised on glass. street level. a glimpse of the bronze statue called "taxi on park avenue" a man with and attache case and raincoat, hailing a cab. the real people hailing cabs, well dressed men and women striding along with briefcases purposeful, successful.}
<L>__{interior taxi}
<A>__{nicky rides again.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{it's life, it's taxis. people trying to make contacts, make deals, meet their lovers. taxis are sexy. you can't have manhattan without taxis. i was proud of my taxi. i kept my taxi clean.}
<A>__{nicky shifts his gaze. he sees elliot litvak slinking across the street, looking faintly unclean and shows a trace of a smile. he watches elliot enter the lobby of the chemical bank.}
<L>__{interior bank}
<A>__{elliot is at a cash machine, making an elaborate transaction. nicky appears, approaching the adjacent machine. elliot sees him.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{nicky. i was thinking about you. i went to the preview last night.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i don't want to hear about it.}
<A>__{nicky attends to his own transaction.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{a lovely piece of theater. small but important.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{shut up, elliot.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{quietly effective.}
<A>__{nicky takes his cash and begins to move away.}
<D>__{we don't appreciate what they've built for us. we're artists who are too dumb to see that this is the peak moment of western culture.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{you're an artist. i'm a craftsman.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{press a button and they give us money.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{ride with me. we need a haircut.}
<L>__{interior taxi}
<A>__{stalled between park and madison. the driver has opened the door and is standing just outside the cab, trying to determine the cause of delay.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{how is lillian? i haven't seen her.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{she wants a divorce.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{don't talk like that.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{it's over, finished and done with.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{that sounds so final. but are we really surprised?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i'm completely stunned. i don't want this to happen.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{but didn't we know it would happen?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{don't needle me, elliot. tell me how bad you feel. we're suppose to feel bad together. this is what friends do.}
<C>__{elliot}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{joanna bourne. so rich and crisp. this woman lets you touch her body? you put your hands on her personal parts?}
<A>__{nicky hits elliot a token blow to the arm. elliot thinks about it, then hits back. they swat each other, half kiddingly, each of them leaning away from the other to prevent being hit in the face.}

<D>__{you used to love life. you don't exude this any more.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{what do i exude?}
<C>__{nicky}

<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{tonight. what's tonight?}

<D>__{shit. they don't have any carrot soup.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{you mean because what's his name.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{you will suffer because he is in the theater. and you will suffer a thousandfold when his review appears.}

<D>__{steven schwimmer. i memorized every word of this review.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{that's awful.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{i recite it to myself with masochistic relish.}

<D>__{a year and a half later? you're still brooding?}
<A>__{a patron approaches the table and stares at nicky with a fixed grin of crazed recognition.}

<D>__{yessirree bob! yessisree bob!}
<A>__{nicky's jaw becomes set and he pours himself a glass of wine as the man backs off.}
<C>__{elliot}
<D>__{you don't know about obscure writers, nicky. how we have our anger to nurture and love. our murderous fantasies for any amount of fame, money , power and sex.}

<L>__{interior restaurant later same table}
<A>__{the food has arrived. nicky is eating compulsively in contrast to elliot, who sips his mineral water, dabs his mouth with a napkin, looks around the restaurant between bites. when nicky is finished with his food, he begins picking among the items on elliot's plate. elliot uses his fork to deflect nicky's fork and the two men have a brief duel with utensils, fencing silently but intently, using knives and spoons to vary action.}

<A>__{nicky sees one of the new york magazine ads, steven schwimmer's face mounted on the cardboard. he fires three times, wiping out schwimmer's eyes.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{will i believe you when you tell me something?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{there's nothing left for me to lie about.}
<A>__{nicky starts into the darkness only to see steven emerge from the shadows, his gun lowered. oddly, he seems distracted by something on another part of the room. he is looking at the tv set on the counter. nicky watches him approach the kitchen area. he follows, gun raised. steven sits on a stool to watch tv. nicky approaches warily, his gun aimed at steven's head, which is blue lit by the tv screen.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{you're dead. i see you on a morgue slab drained of all fluids.}
<A>__{laurel follows at a distance to see what they're so interested in. nicky puts the gun muzzle flush against steven's temple.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i see the outline of your body in chalk on this very floor.}
<C>__{laurel}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{daddy, wait.}
<A>__{steven is watching slow motion footage of bill buckner missing the slow roller.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{then they lost?}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{why does it matter?}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{if they lost tonight, they'll lose tomorrow. it's all over.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{why do you care?}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{they're my team.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{no. they're not your team. they're my team.}
<A>__{nicky cocks the hammer.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{they're my team, too. i grew up on boyleston street. right by fenway park. i went to fifty or sixty games a year. all by myself. i was one of those kids with scabby elbows. i called out to the players. `look over here. hi, i'm steven. my parents are divorced.'}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i went to college in boston so i could be near the red sox. i took summer classes and the cut them to go to the game. my wife is from boston. lillian ziegler?}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{the red sox were my world. i surrendered my existence to a team that couldn't win the big one.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{if you're such a devoted fan, why were you at the play tonight instead of the game? answer carefully. this is important. you could have gone to the theater last night. there was no game last night.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{because i can't bear to watch. when they lose, i die inside. it's like some little person named steve just crumples up and dies. i wait for the scores. i still die, hearing the scores, but it's over in a second. i can't survive the game pitch by pitch, inning by inning. i've done it too many times. and i can't do it anymore.}
<A>__{nicky lowers the gun.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i was six years old the day pesky hesitated throwing home and slaughter scored all the way from first. that's when i knew the red sox were my team. pity and terror.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{when i traveled through asia this summer, i went to tremendous trouble and expense to rent a car with a phone so i could call up sports phone in new york and get the scores. i drove through the war in afghanistan calling sports phone like every hour on the hour, for updates.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{what about my play?}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{yes. and no more evasive tactics.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{it's your best play, nicky.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{see, daddy.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{i've seen it twice. i went back tonight to be sure. it's a brave and honest piece of work.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{what else?}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{an artistry and sensitivity you've never shown before.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{and you're not saying that because of the gun in my hand?}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{you're out of bullets.}
<A>__{nicky points the gun at the palm of his own left hand and pulls the trigger. a click.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{see, daddy.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{and peter redmond helped immensely. these pauses were exquisitely timed. he made us wait and wait. he built a gorgeous tension and suspense.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{we worked very hard on the pauses.}
<A>__{nicky places it on the counter.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{i called sports phone from lhasa, tibet. freezing in my little rented fiat. sheep on a hillside. rocky debris dating back millions and millions of years, from the time the himalayas thrust up when the plates of india and asia collided. red sox 3, white sox 2. a moment in the history of the world.}
<A>__{nicky takes steven's head and moves it tenderly against his chest. when nicky releases the head, he has steven's toupee in his hand. he looks at it briefly, then hands it to laurel.}
<L>__{exterior 48th street near eleventh avenue}
<A>__{a yellow taxi comes speeding past, moving eastward on 48th street. we see it from various perspectives and elevations. it is a large checkered cab, the only thing moving in the night. steam comes billowing from funnel vents. the taxi catches every light just before it turns red.}
<L>__{interior taxi}
<A>__{nicky is driving, his face showing intense satisfaction. laurel sits next to him. driver's name plate }
<C>__{memluk}
<C>__{suleyman}
<A>__{the driver sits in the middle of the rear seat, looking somewhat nervous.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{faster, daddy.}
<L>__{exterior 48th street}
<A>__{the taxi crosses park avenue, speeding past the bronze statue of a man hailing a cab. it approaches first avenue, where a road divider bisects the thoroughfare. nicky swings into a sharp turns, barely averting contact with the divider, and stops abruptly. three doors open. on the empty street, nicky hands the driver a wad of bills. then he and laurel step over the divider. he puts his arm around her shoulders and they cross the avenue to the glass tower where they live. the sun begins to climb out of the east river.}
