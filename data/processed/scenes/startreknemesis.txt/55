<L>__{interior scimitar corridors following}
<A>__{the b 9 leads picard through the dark corridors, holding the disruptor on him steadily. all the remans they pass glare at picard with undisguised loathing. the viceroy approaches. stops before them.}
<C>__{viceroy}
<P>__{(to b 9)}
<D>__{where are you taking him? b 9 praetor shinzon wants him on the bridge.}
<A>__{the viceroy turns his malevolent gaze on picard.}
<C>__{viceroy}
<D>__{so, human... you've met your better self!}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{what are you doing to counsellor troi?}
<C>__{viceroy}
<D>__{i'm preparing her for shinzon... to sooth him as she soothes you. to stand at his side as she does at yours.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{that will never happen.}
<C>__{viceroy}
<D>__{listen to him, android. such a small and weak creature. yet he roars so valiantly...}
<P>__{(he raises one taloned}
<D>__{claw and puts a sharp fingernail on picard's}
<P>__{chest)}
<D>__{it would take me but an instant to tear that valiant heart from your chest.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{there'll be another after me. and another after that. you'll find we're a resilient species.}
<C>__{viceroy}
<D>__{i look forward to the sport.}
<P>__{(to the b 9, harshly)}
<D>__{take him.}
<A>__{the b 9 prods picard's back roughly with the disruptor. picard grimaces in pain}
<D>__{b 9 move.}
<A>__{the viceroy continues away down the corridor. the b 9 leads picard along.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{be careful of over playing your part, commander!}
<A>__{and the audience now realizes it is data pretending to be the b 9 and rejoices.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{sorry, sir. i thought it added a touch of reality to the performance.}
<A>__{they are silent as they pass a few reman guards. then:}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{my mission was a success, sir. i have discovered the source of the thalaron radiation.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{good work. the download?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{he believes he has our communications protocols. but they will give him inaccurate locations for all starfleet vessels.}
<A>__{data assumes the b 9's posture again as they pass some some reman warriors.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{move, puny human animal.}
<A>__{they pass the warriors.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{a bit less florid, data.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{aye, sir... this way.}
<A>__{he leads picard down the corridor.}
