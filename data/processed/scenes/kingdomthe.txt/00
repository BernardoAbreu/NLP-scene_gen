<A>__{we're in a kindergarten classroom of 25 six year olds. all sitting on the floor, legs crossed. sitting in front of the kids is little kevin fleury, flanked by his mom lyla fleury and his dad ronald fleury, in a dark suit. little kevin has a large cardboard square with pictures from different stages of his life taped to it. he's telling the class about the photos. we're tight on the pictures. tight on the young faces. tight on fleury.}
