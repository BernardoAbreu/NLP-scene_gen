<C>__{kader}
<P>__{(to him)}
<D>__{they are beggars and unemployed, homeless. we have organized things in such a way that during the strike they will be guests of other families who have homes and will provide shelter in the event of possible reprisals ... but i didn't know that they would be brought to this house too. it is a mistake.}
<C>__{ben m'hidi}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{because you are here too. it would be better for you to move to another house.}
<A>__{ben m'hidi moves away from the parapet.}
<C>__{ben m'hidi}
<D>__{all right ... you're the one who must decide.}
<A>__{kader follows him along the terrace.}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{no, if i were the one to decide, you wouldn't be in algiers now.}
<A>__{ben m'hidi looks at him, smiling.}
<C>__{ben m'hidi}
<D>__{why? isn't it wise?}
<A>__{kader smiles too, and repeats:}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{it isn't wise.}
<A>__{at the end of the terrace, there is a construction raised to a level with the stairs that lead to the floor below. there is a large room; through the open door, the lighted interior is visible. the walls have high brick baseboards, and at the bottom of one of the four walls there is a square opening that leads into a hiding place. the closure of the hiding place, a square of very thick wall, is placed to one side. ali la pointe is covering it with bricks. on the other side of the room next to the door, there are some cement wash basins, and a shed for rain water. kader appears at the door.}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{ali, you must accompany ben m'hidi to the maison des arbres.}
<A>__{ali doesn't answer immediately. he finishes placing the last brick then turns to kader.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{why? isn't he sleeping here?}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{no, it's better if he doesn't. the house is filled with new people.}
<A>__{ali gets up, wipes his hands on his trousers, at the same time inspecting the work that he has just completed.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{here's another one ready. what a hideout! it really looks like a wall. i will dirty it a bit, and it's perfect. want to give a look inside?}
<A>__{kader has taken a machine gun from one of the basins, and he tosses it to ali, who catches it.}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{no, go now. it's already late.}
<A>__{they go out on the terrace. ali releases the catch of his machine gun so that the bullet slips into the barrel.}
<C>__{kader}
<P>__{(to ben m'hidi)}
<D>__{they are a family of militants from way back. everything will work out well, you'll see ... c'mon, ali, hurry up.}
<C>__{ben m'hidi}
<D>__{alright. see you tomorrow.}
<A>__{they say good bye, embracing one another. ali has already climbed over the terrace wall, and has jumped to the next one. ben m'hidi follows him; he is less agile and moves with a bit of trouble. from the parapet, kader says to him:}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{passing along the terraces only takes five minutes ... and with ali la pointe, you'll be safe ...}
<A>__{while jumping, ben m'hidi loses his balance, and has to grab on to ali to prevent himself from falling.}
<C>__{ben m'hidi}
<D>__{but it's he who won't be safe with me ...}
<A>__{the two figures move away from terrace to terrace, and disappear in the dark.}
