<A>__{the nose of danny's plane is pointed right at the harbor and he sees the sudden devastation of the arizona. it is a sight so awesome it freezes him for a moment. a zero comes up behind him, firing. danny jerks his stick to maneuver but he's caught... rafe comes in behind the zero, chopping it up, even as he yells at danny over the radio }

<D>__{ain't no time for spectatin'!}
<A>__{they turn back after the line of zeros. there are some japanese planes coming after them now, but the p 40's head at their noses, firing, then duck past in a double maneuver, and turn right back into the japanese formation. rafe has a plane in his sights, but his guns fire only a short burst before stopping.}

<D>__{i'm out of fuel!}
<A>__{they head back. a single zero is on their way. rafe charges it and draws its fire; danny comes in behind the zero and rakes its cockpit; the japanese pilot backs off. the p 40's dive back toward haleiwa. a handful of zeros returning from pearl see them and follow.}
