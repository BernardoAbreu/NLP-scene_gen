<L>__{exterior godfather's house day}
<A>__{ghatak is literally carried out of the house by an orderly and placed into his car. there's a driver and there is the goonda. they start down the street. we're with the car. suddenly, the driver slams on the brakes and from:}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{we see hasari and max blocking the street with the new rickshaw. the goonda jumps out of the car, comes threateningly at hasari.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{babu, please, i beg you, hear my words!}
<A>__{as the goonda is about to land on hasari we hear a feeble...}
<C>__{ghatak}
<D>__{wait.}
<A>__{the goonda backs off. the godfather waves hasari and max close. hasari brings his gleaming rickshaw to the window of the car, max at his shoulder.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{may i say first, babu, i wish you long life and good health.}
<C>__{ghatak}
<D>__{acha! they take me now to the scientists. they stick needles in me, take pictures of my insides, study them, and then tell me what i know.}
<A>__{the godfather stares at hasari, flicks his eyes at max. waits.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{when you gave me work, i swore i would be as your youngest brother. your son thinks i have been disloyal. he took my rickshaw. with my friend, i have remade this one. i beg you to let me go again onto the streets. i have my family.}
<A>__{the old man looks at the rickshaw, at the obvious care that went into its renovation, at this unlikely team of refurbishers. he reaches a shaking hand out toward a shaft. hasari brings it close. the old man rubs the shaft.}
<C>__{ghatak}
<D>__{it is very beautiful.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{thank you, babu.}
<C>__{ghatak}
<D>__{if i may say, it has an allure.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{an allure, babu thank you.}
<A>__{the godfather stares at hasari, then at max.}
<C>__{ghatak}
<D>__{the world is chaos. we struggle to build something permanent, then our bodies betray us, our sons betray us.}
<P>__{(to hasari now)}
<D>__{yes, you may take your rickshaw out. if you can face up to my son.}
<A>__{the goonda gets back into the car and the car pulls away and we are left with hasari and max as moment.}
