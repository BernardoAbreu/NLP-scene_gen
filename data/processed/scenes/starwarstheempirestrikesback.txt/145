<L>__{exterior vader's star destroyer vader's chamber}
<A>__{admiral piett hesitates in the entryway to vader's private cubicle. after a moment, he steps into the room and pauses at the surprising sight before him. darth vader, his back turned, is silhouetted in the gloom on the far side of the chamber. a black, insectlike droid attends him. among the various apparatuses surrounding them, a respirator tube now retracts from vader's uncovered head. the head is bald with a mass of ugly scar tissue covering it. the black droid then lowers the mask and helmet onto vader's head. when it is in place, the dark lord turns to face piett.}
