<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{patty! cut it out! i just came to tell her that something happened! something really major happened!}
<A>__{patty stops punching and looks up curiously. stainer remains in the headlock also curious.}

<C>__{patty}
<D>__{you shut your hole! (to kirk) what happened?}

<D>__{look! i know i was acting like an idiot. she's just so... well, i was really having a hard time with everyone thinking i was molly's brother or her co worker or her gay friend or whatever. i mean, nobody believed that we were together.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{it's too late for this shit, kirk.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{but i've got it worked out now.}
<A>__{patty and stainer wait for it. kirk decides how to phrase it.}
<C>__{kirk }
<D>__{my grandmother left me three million dollars.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{seriously?}
<A>__{patty drops stainer on the floor.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{i thought she was a blackjack dealer.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{it turns out she bought stock in caesars palace back in the sixties. nobody knew she still had it. i don't think she even knew.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{wow. so, what does this have to do with molly?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{see? now it makes sense me with her. i'm a millionaire now.}
<C>__{patty}

<D>__{no! no! i get it! it's not a whore thing! now it works out in his own mind. right!? he can relax and stop acting like a freak because now he's bringing something to the table! right, kirky!?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{right. well, no. now that you say it out loud... i don't know.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{you know what, kirk i told molly you were different but you're just as shallow and full of shit as the rest of them, aren't you?}
