<A>__{grisly carcasses of every description hang from hooks. two bored butchers hack them up. the good bits are tossed into a wagon to fed to the colosseum animals. the waste and offal are shoveled into a large sewer opening. a butcher occasionally lifts a sluice gate and a gush of water flows into the sewer from above, washing down the blood and carcasses. maximus crouches and creeps through the nightmare of hanging carcasses and flies. when the butchers are looking elsewhere, maximus creeps to the sewer opening and climbs in he immediately slides down for a few yards in the slanting, slippery blood sluice out of sight then he thuds to a stop. he can go no further because the remains of an animal carcass blocks his way. he tries to slither past the carcass finally, one of the butchers above lifts the sluice gate and a torrent of water flows down. maximus is washed down the hideous sewer.}
