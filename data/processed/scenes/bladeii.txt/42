<L>__{interior scud's workshop dawn}
<A>__{blade, whistler and scud enter through the loading elevator. blade turns to whistler.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{sounds like a plan.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{what do you really think?}
<C>__{whistler}
<P>__{(lighting a cigarette)}
<D>__{these guys are shitting bricks cause they're no longer on the top of the food chain. they're going to fuck us the first chance they get.}
<A>__{whistler moves away. blade shrugs off his jacket, begins putting away his weapons. scud lingers, apprehensive.}
<C>__{scud}
<D>__{so you're going to do this?}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{keep your friends close and your enemies closer. isn't that how the saying goes?}
<A>__{scud follows blade's gaze, watching whistler, who has collapsed into a chair at the far end of the workshop. the grizzled hunter pulls off his leg brace, then massages his bum knee. scud nods in whistler's direction.}
<C>__{scud}
<D>__{i'm worried about him.}
<P>__{(off blade's look)}
<D>__{look, i know he's your friend, but just watch him, okay? nobody goes cold turkey from the thirst in a night.}
<B>__{back on whistler}
<A>__{surrounded by the salvaged parts and massive gears of long discarded machinery, half hidden in shadow. a shaft of morning sunlight cuts in through one of the windows, slowly moving across the floor towards his position. he shifts in his chair, moving slightly away from the light.}
