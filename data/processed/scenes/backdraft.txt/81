<L>__{exterior fire station 17 training building hose tower day}
<A>__{an expanse of concrete lying out back of the station. built in one corner is the concrete shell of a five story training building, just wide enough for a stairway and room on each level. twenty yards away, brian, tim and adcox stand ready beside a pile of coiled hose rolls.}
<C>__{stephen}
<P>__{(looking at watch)}
<D>__{alright... go!}
<A>__{tim picks up a roll of hose, 50 pounds, throws it over his shoulder and runs with adcox to the foot of the building. there's a fixed standpipe that adcox ties into as tim drags the other end inside and up a flight of stairs.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{go!}
<A>__{brian lifts another hose roll under his arm and runs for the building.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{that isn't a football, probie. get it on your shoulder.}
<A>__{brian runs up two flights to meet tim and connect his end. tim heads down for another roll as brian drags his up another two flights. it's a bitch. sweating, he barrels back down the stairs, passing tim coming up with another roll.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{having fun, fireman?}
<A>__{tim flips him off. brian laughs and sprints for another roll.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{you're not breaking any records, brian.}
<A>__{brian holds it under his arm and takes off. stephen grabs a roll himself, hoists it to his shoulder and runs alongside.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{your shoulder. like this!}
<A>__{brian lifts it to his shoulder.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{come on! pick it up!}
<A>__{they come to the doorway. instead of stopping, stephen follows brian in and runs alongside up the stairs. without a word spoken it's become a race between them. brian's face explodes in sweat. his heart pounds as they go up flight after flight. the hose rolls weigh a 100 pounds. a thousand. neck 'n neck all the way; grunting, their throats burning, only one flight from the roof stephen stumbles and scrapes his leg. brian pauses. stephen's already back on his feet.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{run, damn you!}
<A>__{brian does, stephen already gaining on him getting ready to pass him when they burst gasping out onto the roof, brian the "winner" by a nose. stephen drops his hose roll, sticks his face into brian's, and laughs. unsure, brian starts to join in. stephen stops suddenly.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{roll the hose.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{what, are you kidding? by myself?}
<A>__{adcox and tim, down below, have already disappeared back into the station.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{you heard me.}
<A>__{we see now what stephen apparently doesn't. he was scraped badly, his pant leg torn and leaking dark circles of blood.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{what, is it the stairs? christ, i will let you win next time.}
<C>__{stephen}
<P>__{(in brian's face)}
<D>__{you got a problem with drilling, probie?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{no, lt., i don't have a problem with drilling. but let's just have one drill. not one for the company and one for me.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{roll the hose.}
<A>__{stephen turns and walks away. brian stands there watching him in blind fury, finally exploding.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{goddamn you stephen, i'm not gonna quit. you hear me!}
<A>__{an awkward beat between them that's interrupted suddenly by the station alarm klaxon. stephen smiles.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{well, thank god for fires...}
