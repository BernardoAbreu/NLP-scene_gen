<A>__{louise bears down really hard and passes him. again as they get right next to him, he blows kisses down at them. he is leering at them and laughing. louise and thelma drive further down the road. louise pulls the car off to the side of the road. as the truck gets close they start waving to him to stop. he pulls his truck off the side of the road and stops. angle on louise and thelma smiling up at him. he chuckles to himself. he leans out the window.}
