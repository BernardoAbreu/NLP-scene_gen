<L>__{interior cabin day}
<A>__{music thunders, quite a contrast to the surroundings. a cosy little abode, showing signs of neglect, as though decorated with a gentler touch that passed not too long ago. a large shelf replete with books. an electric mix from sun tsuis the art of war to mark twainis the adventures of huckleberry finn. a fire burns in the fireplace. on the mantle sit a few old black and white photos of a slightly younger logan posing with a group of hard case military types in a heavily wooded area. we can not tell if they are true military or simply mercenaries. in the wall above the mantle, a sketch of a beautiful woman. and finally we come to the occupant of the house, sitting at the only table in the center of the room. his back is to us. his hair is coarse and black, sprouting wildly from his head. he is logan. we will come to know him well. as well as we can. despite the loud, pounding music, he is working with the meticulousness of a watch maker. at the same time, he smokes a thick cigar. a tall bottle of beer on the floor next to his chair. a single, silver dog tag hangs from his neck from a battered chain. as we get closer, we look over his shoulder and see what he is working on so intensely. pencil rubs against paper furiously. he is sketching, what we cannot see. but he is definitely caught up in his own minds eye. his head suddenly turns. he listens to something we cannot begin to hear. a momentary pause, and he goes back to sketching. just as he seems to be settling back into the details again.}

<A>__{he reaches over and shuts off the music coming from the box beside him. he listens. he stands, turning around slowly in a circle. he drops the sketch pad on the chair. only the crackle of logs in the fire. logan's p.o.v. we follow his gaze around the room. past the fire which sounds suddenly like a blazing inferno, past the clock which ticks as loud as clapping hands, past the simmering tea kettle which hisses like a seething cauldron. finally, he glances at the cigar which we hear crackling nearly as loud as the fire. logan's senses are amplified many times more then ours, he walks to the door.}
<B>__{e.c.u.}
<A>__{his nostrils flare. he raises his fist beside his face. for a moment, it seems as if he is just chinking. then shook three steely claws some nine inches long, emerge inexplicably from the skin just above logan's knuckles. logan barley turns his head before.}
<B>__{boom}
<A>__{the window explodes, letting in freezing wind and billowing snow. logan is hit from behind. the attack is so ferocious that we are unable to make out the attacker. whatever it is, it is huge. we can hear it snarling and see flashes of its claws as it slams logan back.}
