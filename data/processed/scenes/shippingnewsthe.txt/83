<A>__{...quoyle and wavey stroll the grounds of nolan's future retirement home. it is twilight, and the modest place looks pleasant and welcoming. quoyle listens earnestly, as the director points things out. wavey watching quoyle, her gaze not so disapproving after all. ...close on quoyle with a bowling ball, poised, glaring our way. here he comes. stumbles. lets go. reverse angle to see the ball rolling, rolling real slow. quoyle turns his back, strides away with confidence like he doesn't even have to watch, this is too easy. wavey points, look. he turns in time to see two pins fall. pumps his fist. yessss!}
