<A>__{close on handcuffs snapping into place. sheriff moran checks their snugness about kabuo's wrists, as the crowd mills through the courtroom in the wake of adjournment. grasping kabuo's arm, moran begins leading him toward a small doorway just at the rear of the witness box. but... ...someone is there. in the doorway. and moran's grip tightens as they approach...}

<D>__{there's rules.}

<D>__{you better be there.}
<A>__{he smiles. a lovely, easy, cowboy american smile.}
