<A>__{the leeds players run out onto the pitch: hunter, madely, bremner, giles, reaney, jones, in a line, waving to the crowd, turning north, south, east, west...}

<A>__{taylor rubs his hands in excitement, "here we go". but clough is miles away. still cannot let the insult go. he stares over at the visiting team dug out..}
<A>__{revie and his lieutenants. whispering among themselves. huddled in thought. huddled in strategy. huddled in malevolence. presently, the game starts. a roar from the crowd. "beeeep", the ref's whistle blows. a derby player rolls in agony, cries out, a terrible, cynical challenge. horrified, jimmy gordon and peter taylor up on thier feet in protest..}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{referee..!}
<A>__{clough looks over to revie's bench. sees revie and syd owen quietly applauding the leeds player. encouraging more of the same. as the derby player is stretchered off.. presently, rrrooooaaaarrrrr goes up. goal leeds. revie and his henchmen get to their feet. applauding. 1 0. taylor and jimmy gordon immediately start shouting out encouragement to the derby players, new instructions, as the game restarts..}
<C>__{taylor }
<D>__{c'mon, keep your shape! close him down!}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{think, alan! to feet!}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{now sent it out wide!}
<A>__{clough doesn't join in. he continues to stare at revie in his dugout. suddenly: "beeep!", whistle! penatly leeds! clough leaps off the bench in outrage. screaming, on his feel, protesting in disbelief..}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{what? he didn't fucking touch him! ref! he dived! he fucking dived!}
<A>__{revie shaking hands with his colleagues. smiling amongst themselves. congratulating themselves. celebrating. the inevitable roar as leeds convert, followed by, "beeeeeep", the sound of the final whistle. clough stares in disbelief. robbed. deflated. the referee blows the whistle for the end of the game. clough watches as revie and syd owen brush past, shaking peter taylor and jimmy gordon's hands, (assuming taylor's the manager), on their way to the dressing rooms, their minds already on their next game... clough stares as they go..}
