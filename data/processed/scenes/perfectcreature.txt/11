<L>__{int: room, flashback night}
<A>__{flashback from silus' memory; a dead girl on a bed, blood splattered across her pillow. cut to}
<L>__{int: cafe night}
<A>__{silus' face. pull out to reveal we're back in the cafe.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{it is taken care of.}
<C>__{augustus}
<D>__{this is good.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{augustus. we failed this girl. we asked her to help us catch him, and then we failed her.}
<C>__{augustus}
<D>__{yes. but her death served a greater good. every trap needs bait.}
<A>__{augustus lifts a beautifully designed glass and silver pipe from the onyx table at which they sit, then settles back into a fine hardwood chair. the chair's swirling, delicate back creeks as he takes a puff on the pipe.}
<C>__{augustus}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{are you sure you won't join me?}
<A>__{silus shakes his head, no. the opium in the pipe crackles.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{perhaps this is beyond us. perhaps we should inform the authorities. the human beings.}
<A>__{augustus places the pipe down, blows a smoke ring as a chinese woman, dressed in a sarong, brings over two finely cut crystal glasses and sets them before the men, then leaves. silus now lifts the glass and we see what it contains. blood; dark and red and viscous. silus takes a sip, then looks over to the bar. there is a young woman there, sitting at the bar, being treated with great care by several of the elegantly dressed patrons; the young woman laughs, enjoying the attention. tubes run from the young woman's arms. these tubes carry her blood into a conch shaped glass bowl. we see the chinese waitress fill another glass from the bowl. silus watches, blood slightly present on his ashen lips. and we see two perfectly pointed fangs hanging in his mouth.}
<C>__{augustus}
<D>__{for now the brothers feel we should deal with this ourselves.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{if they find out we are covering up these deaths...}
<C>__{augustus}
<D>__{which is why you must find him. silus.}
<A>__{silus now turns to augustus, still looking unconvinced.}
<C>__{augustus}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{for centuries we brothers have served mankind and them us. the great union. but remember your history. 300 years ago when our kind were first born into this world they burnt our children as monsters. they had no notion of evolution. in another world we might all have been slaughtered, only to be remembered in myth, monsters to frighten the young or a puzzle for anthropologists. we must refuse to let one aberrant individual destroy the balance between the two races. the old prejudices are still there. human beings are paranoid creatures by nature.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{perhaps they have good reason.}
<C>__{augustus}
<D>__{silus. simply concern yourself with finding edgar. find your brother so that we can help him. before he kills again.}
