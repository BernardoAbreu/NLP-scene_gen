<A>__{smecker sits on the balls of his fee on a sprawling front lawn. he looks out to the street and sees a forensics technician kneeling before a new, gray ford taurus riddled with bullet holes. the man marks a sea of different sized bullet casings that stretch for thirty five feet down the sidewalk. he circles two blood stains on the side walk with orange chalk. smecker turns and looks at the front of the house. it is peppered with bullet holes, all seemingly concentrated on the front stoop area. men try to lift blood samples off the white paint around the door. he stands and dolly, duffy and greenly are ready with pens and notebooks behind him.}
