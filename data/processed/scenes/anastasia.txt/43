<A>__{dmitri and vladimir look up from their burnt cabbage. they heard it too.}
<L>__{interior staircase (ballroom)}
<A>__{anya is relieved to see it is only meetoo, who wags his tail happily with the curtain still in his mouth.}
<C>__{anya}
<D>__{what are you do. . .}
<A>__{anya stops mid sentence, taken by what she sees. anya's pov behind the curtain was the frieze of the romanov family. the moonlight hits the portrait with a ghostly glow. "once upon a december" (the music box theme) anya is mesmerized by the frieze. she looks around the ballroom. . . almost remembering something. . .}
<C>__{anya}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{dancing bears, painted wings things i almost remember. and a song someone sings once upon a december}
<A>__{as she sings the ballroom transform into it's once spledid glory. anya takes off her coat and at once her rags are transformed into a beautiful gown. nicholas steps down from the frieze and walks her down the stairs gracefully and begins a waltz with her.}
<C>__{anya }
<D>__{someone holds me safe and warm horses prance through a silver storm figures dancing gracefully across my memory.}
<A>__{music builds. a chorus of voices sing the melody as royal ghosts appear as elegant and beautiful as in the opening scene. then}
<C>__{anya }
<D>__{someone holds me safe and warm horses prance through a silver storm figures dancing gracefully across my memory.}
<A>__{music: full! dmitri and vladimir appear at the top of the stairs. dmitri & vladimir's pov some ragged lunatic dancing with "himself".}
<C>__{anya }
<D>__{far away, long ago glowing dim as an ember, things my heart used to know things it yearns to remember}
<A>__{anya is released from nicholas' embrace. he kisses her on the forehead and slowly backs away. she follows nicholas, back up the stairs to the landing, where the sun has caused a "dust" mist. then, magically, tatiana appears through the mist, a loving beautiful vision from the past.}
<C>__{anya }
<D>__{and a song someone sings once upon a december.}
<C>__{dmitri }
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{who are you?!}
<B>__{end number}
<A>__{dmitri's voice causes the visage to disintegrate. all goes back to the way it was dark and destroyed. anya spins toward dmitri, surprised and frightened. dmitri's pov anya is caught in a ray of moonlight, directly in front of the image of anastasia in the frieze. the resemblance is striking. dmitri is taken aback, but vladimir is unaffected.}
<C>__{vladimir}
<D>__{you're trespassing, boy!}
<A>__{anya is dazed by what has just happened to her and can't quite refocus on reality.}
<C>__{anya}
<D>__{i. . . i. . . spoke to you earlier about traveling paper. .}
<A>__{dmitri pokes vladimir with his elbow but doesn't take his eyes off anya.}

<P>__{(whispering to vlad)}
<D>__{it's her.}
<C>__{vladimir}
<D>__{he's her?}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{look!}
<A>__{vladimir looks at anya again and get it.}
<C>__{anya}
<D>__{are you dmitri? i didn't mean to trespass i don't want to do anything dishonest, but if you could just help help me. . .}
<A>__{vladimir and dmitri walk down the stairs and up her stairs and begin to circle around her.}
<C>__{vladimir}
<D>__{perhaps you heard of our brilliant plan to find a girl and. . .}
<A>__{dmitri pokes him hard in the ribs and shakes his head.}
<C>__{dmitri}
<P>__{(quietly to vlad)}
<D>__{she doesn't want to do anything "dishonest". . .}
<C>__{vladimir}
<P>__{(gets it, whispers)}
<D>__{ew. . . the honest type.}
<A>__{dmitri gives vlad a "let me handle this" gestures.}
<C>__{dmitri}
<P>__{(off frieze)}
<D>__{you look like her. like the princess anastasia. has anyone ever told you that before?}
<A>__{anya is coming back to her senses, doesn't like these men circling her.}
<C>__{anya}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{oh, yeah in the orphanage they constantly told me i looked like a princess! stop that!}
<A>__{dmitri stops circling and then begins to use everything that anya says the perfect and charming con man that he is to get what he wants.}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{people say anastasia was the only member of the royal family to escape alive. that makes her an orphan too}
<C>__{dmitri }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what happened to your parents?}
<C>__{anya}
<D>__{i don't know i don't remember anything that happened before the revolution. . .}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{you know, it's strange anastasia's grandmother, the dowager empress tatiana has been looking for anastasia since the revolution. why do you think she wouldn't go to her own grandmother?}
<C>__{anya}
<D>__{i don't know. i don't see what this has to do with me.}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{perhaps it's because she has amnesia too can't remember. . .}
<C>__{vladimir}
<D>__{how much do you weigh?}
<A>__{dmitri pokes him again.}
<C>__{vladimir }
<P>__{(to dmitri)}
<D>__{i was just wondering since we already have the dress. . .}
<C>__{anya}
<D>__{look, i came here to get papers to travel to paris and. . .}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{why do you want to go to paris?}
<C>__{anya}
<P>__{(defiant)}
<D>__{i have my reasons.}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{anastasia's grandmother is in paris. we're going to bring anastasia to her in paris.}
<C>__{dmitri }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and i think you are the princess anastasia.}
<A>__{anya laughs. vlad mouths to dmitri "do you think she's really anastasia?" dmitri shakes his head no, of course not, then continues with anya. vlad smiles to himself and walks down the stairs dmitri's so good even he got confused!}
<C>__{dmitri }
<D>__{you never thought of the possibility?}
<C>__{anya}
<D>__{look there isn't an orphan in the world who doesn't dream she's a princess but, come on. . . look at me!}
<A>__{dmitri spins spins around, dramatically pointing to anastasia's image in the freeze.}
