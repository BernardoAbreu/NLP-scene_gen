<C>__{tyke}
<D>__{they pull up at a red light, next to an abandoned drive in. josie peers in, and sees a big group of kids, standing around a bonfire drinking beers, talking, a few making out. she opens her window, sticks her head out, and tries to get a better look.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{aldys}
<D>__{that's the old drive in. they call it "the court". now it's just a continuous party for guy's group.}

<C>__{aldys}
<D>__{sometimes i wonder what they talk about.}
<C>__{josie}
<D>__{yeah, i know.}
<C>__{aldys}
<D>__{i mean, what if they just stupid to hide the fact that they're actually brainiacs with super powers and they're plotting to take over the world and make my life hell until i die?}
<A>__{angle on: the cool girls.}
<C>__{gibby}
<D>__{no. it's lather, rinse, repeat.}

<A>__{josie is frozen, but not aldys.}
<C>__{aldys}
<D>__{oh, guy, you on a little break from having an original thought? ooops, i forgot, that's all the time.}
<A>__{tyke gets it, and laughs. guy doesn't get it at all.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{you guys aren't seriously trying to hang out at the court?}
<C>__{aldys}
<D>__{oooh, cheap wine coolers and a fire in a trashcan. where do i sign up?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{and stay away from prom.}
<C>__{aldys}
<D>__{last i checked this was still a free country.}
<C>__{tyke}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{there's a land that i see, where the children are free }
<A>__{guy's right in aldys' face, leaning over josie. aldys starts to drive away. guy keeps his head in the window while he runs alongside the car.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{look, geek, why don't you just go home and play with your calculator. figure out how many lifetimes it will take you to get cool.}
