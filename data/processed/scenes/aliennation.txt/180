<L>__{interior warehouse at fish nets night}
<A>__{sykes comes to rack upon rack of drying fish nets, hanging from the ceiling. he has no alternate route he begins pushing through them. sykes' pov moving through fish nets because of the dimness, he can't see much beyond each rack of nets immediately before him. he keeps wading through it's like a house of mirrors, he can't tell now much farther he has to go to get out of the nets, and the deeper in he gets, the harder it would be to go back the way he came. he pushes past one particular rack of nets and looming out of the darkness ahead of him is a terrifying face!}
<B>__{on sykes}
<A>__{he stumbles back, gets tangled in the nets, brings up the casull, is about to fire when... he sees what the face is. it's the maiden's figurehead from the bow of an old ship. the wood is worm eaten and decayed, creating a hideous visage. sykes stands there a moment, trying to jump start his heart again.}
