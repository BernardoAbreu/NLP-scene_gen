<A>__{this is torture for jacey. doug looks out the window at the striped tent in the abbott's front yard as they pass by. a party for the "class of 1959" is underway (as a banner on the tent proclaims). the street is lined with parked cars and busy with late coming guests. doug checks the rearview mirror for jacey's reaction, but his brother keeps his eyes on the road.}
