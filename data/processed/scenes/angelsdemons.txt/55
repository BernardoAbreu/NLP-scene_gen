<L>__{int pantheon day}
<A>__{ the pantheon, a massive, circular room with a 141 foot unsupported span even larger than the cupola of st. peter's. there are a dozen tourists scattered around, and a tour group on one side hearing a lecture from a museum docent. langdon looks up at the hole in the ceiling through which a bright shaft of light is shining.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{the oculus. that could be the "demon's hole" in the poem.}
<A>__{looking around, vittoria sees several sarcophagi scattered around the room, all pointing obliquely in a certain direction. as they move stealthily through the crowd, they speak in low tones:}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{why are the tombs at an angle?}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{to face east. sun worship.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{but this is a christian church.}
<C>__{langdon}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{new religions often adopt existing holidays to make conversion less shocking. december 25th was the pagan holiday of the unconquered sun. made it a handy choice for christ's birthday.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{you're saying christianity is repackaged sun worship?}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{where do you think halos came from? not just sun worship though, the catholics borrowed communion from the aztecs, canonization from euphemerus, the cruciform from the egyptians }
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{no wonder they don't like you around here.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{just trying to keep the conversation lively.}
<P>__{(points)}
<D>__{check the recesses. i will go left. see you in a hundred eighty degrees.}
<A>__{he starts to the left, she goes to the right, walking in the shadowy recesses behind the pillars at the edges of the room. langdon walks slowly, checking out faces. tourists. couples. teenagers. more tourists. around every column, there are shadows, and in those shadows nothing. he looks at his watch. five minutes to eight. and then a shriek from the other side of the room. he whirls, sees vittoria backing away from something.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{vittoria!}
<A>__{he races across the room, reaches her at the far side. her face is ashen. she's pointing at something, aghast.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{raphael's tomb! but }
<A>__{langdon rushes forward to the crypt. there doesn't seem to be anything out of the ordinary, except }
<C>__{vittoria }
<D>__{ it's the wrong one!}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{what are you talking about?!}
<A>__{he leans down, looks at the plaque on it.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{he was moved here, in 1759. a century after diagramma was published!}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{that's not possible, the poem said }
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{where was he originally buried?}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{i don't know... urbino, i think...}
<P>__{(thinking like crazy)}
<D>__{santi's earthly tomb... what else could it possibly... santi 's tomb...}
<A>__{his eyes flit around the room, from one ornate sarcophagus to another. and then it hits him:}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{damn it! "santi's tomb" must mean one of the chapels he built! he's not buried in it, he designed it! rich people commissioned burial chapels in churches all over rome in his day!}
<P>__{(looks up)}
<D>__{and the "demon's hole," it isn't the oculus, it's an undercroft, a crypt, common sixteenth century term!}
<A>__{at that very moment, the tour group is passing them, and the elderly docent asks his group the perfunctory wrap up:}
<C>__{docent}
<D>__{does anyone have any questions?}
<A>__{langdon busts in on the group.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{yes! did raphael santi ever design a chapel with an ossuary annex and angel figure commissioned by the catholic church?!}
<A>__{the docent blinks. wasn't expecting quite so esoteric a question.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{well?!}
<C>__{docent}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i... i can only think of one.}
<A>__{langdon suppresses the urge to grab him by the lapels and shake it out of him.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{one'll do.}
