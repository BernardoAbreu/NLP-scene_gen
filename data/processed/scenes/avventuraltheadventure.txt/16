<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{inside the hut it is pitch black. sandro strikes a match and finds a kerosene lamp on a nearby table. he lights it and the room is suddenly illuminated, revealing a miserable interior with a few broken chairs, several empty boxes, a shovel and a few other utensils. over to one side is a small pile of straw suggesting a makeshift bed.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{as far as i'm concerned, i think she's alive... why, even this morning... that business about the shark... it wasn't at all true.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{and why do you tell us this only now?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{i... i don't know... i didn't think it was worthwhile... she was laughing over it...}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{really! still, it remains to be seen why she invented a shark. what was her purpose in that?}
<C>__{claudia}
<P>__{(indicating sandro)}
<D>__{maybe you'd better ask him.}
<C>__{corrado}
<P>__{(to sandro)}
<D>__{what were you and anna arguing about?... excuse me for being so indiscreet, but this is serious...}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{nothing but the usual argument... the only thing was if i remember correctly that she said she had a need to be alone.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{and how do you explain that?}
<A>__{ignoring the question, sandro begins pacing back and forth across the room. the silence is broken only by the sound of the rain outside which is now coming down harder and harder. suddenly, footsteps are heard approaching the hut. sandro, claudia and corrado quickly turn around and face the door, their faces clearly revealing the expectation that it might be anna. finally the door begins to open and an old man appears, carrying a sack in his hand.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{are you the owner of this place?}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{no. the owners are in australia.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{but where did you come from?}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{from panarea. why?}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{ah, then it was you... i heard a boat leaving here at two o'clock today...}
<C>__{old man}
<P>__{(scratching his head)}
<D>__{it must have been around four or five...}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{in the afternoon?}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{no... in the morning. why? what's happened?}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{nothing... nothing at all!}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{but why don't you tell him?}
<P>__{(then turning to the old man)}
<D>__{a girl who was with us has disappeared.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{what do you mean... disappeared? was she drowned?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{no, she didn't drown... she just disappeared, and nobody knows where.}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{and i suppose it's my fault... why don't you tell him that too. that's what you believe, isn't it?}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{rather than being so occupied with my thoughts, you would have been better off trying to understand what anna was thinking.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{have you searched in back of the house to see if she might have fallen off that cliff? last month that's what happened to one of my sheep... i looked all over for it all day long and it wasn't until late at night that i heard it bleating... it had been there the whole day... and was almost dead.}
<A>__{claudia suddenly jumps up and runs out of the hut and into the dark, calling out desperately.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{anna! . . . anna!}
<A>__{but her cries are lost in the sound of the storm. drenched by the rain, her shoes full of mud, her dress soaked, she stops, as corrado, who had followed after her, grabs hold of her arm and leads her back to the hut.}
<C>__{corrado}
<D>__{come, claudia...come back inside.}
