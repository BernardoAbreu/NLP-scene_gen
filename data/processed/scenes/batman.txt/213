<D>__{happy birthday, gotham. here's a little token of my esteem. have fun... 'cause the party's on me!}
<A>__{insane laughter echoes. cargo bays open wide. the joker's helicopters begin leafleting the city... with money!}
<B>__{series of shots}
<A>__{anarchy in gotham as high denomination bills flutter to earth, blanketing the streets. hopelessly outmanned cops try to maintain order as solid citizens trample one another in a paroxysm of animal greed. buildings empty as apartment dwellers race outside. all traffic stops as drivers climb out of their cars to snatch money from the air. darkness everywhere. in the pitch black subways, terrified commuters are seized by claustrophobia. glass shatters, doors break open as they claw their way out of stalled subway cars and spill out onto the tracks. on the streets above, gotham's criminal element is having a field day. the cops are preoccupied, utterly helpless against the first waves of rioting and looting. flames erupt. punks race down the street carrying fur coats and color tv's. looters break through the display window of an electronics store, and climb in among the goodies... only to fly out, two seconds later, on the wrong end of a shotgun blast. the joker's dream is coming true.}
