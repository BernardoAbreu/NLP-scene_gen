<L>__{interior physical anthropology lab day}
<A>__{huge centrifuges, hissing autoclaves, electrophoresis apparati, glowing monitors, elaborate blown glass distillation columns and titration set ups. one of the most advanced technical facilities of its kind. and mixed in with all the modern machinery are skeletons of all kinds. complete homo sapien specimens are scattered around the room. standing midst all this is gregory kawakita, early twenties. kawakita makes sharp, jerky overhead movements with his left hand, waving something about. he's practicing casting. we hear the zing of a line and the whirring of the fly reel as margo enters. a fly whips out, passing right under her nose.}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{third from the end! right shoulder. aleut, provenance unknown.}
<A>__{the fly zooms across the room and lights on the shoulder of the third skeleton from the end, labeled "aleut, provenance unknown." margo rolls her eyes and kawakita smiles with pride.}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{if i spent half the time on my fractal evolution thesis that i spend on this fly rod, i'd have my phd.}
<C>__{margo}
<P>__{(small smile)}
<D>__{but at what a price.}
<A>__{kawakita reels in his line as margo drops her backpack on her large desk. an enormous microscope stands by the equally imposing computer topped by a tiger skull. a screen saver of an animated pterodactyl plays. margo unpacks boxes of fossil teeth, hits some keys revealing columns of seemingly indecipherable chemical equations on the computer screen.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i have the species identification on these teeth. we can extract dna and start running tests on the extrapolator program. call dr. frock. he wanted a demonstration.}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{margo, you haven't heard?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{frock's been fired.}
<A>__{margo straightens, stunned.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{that's impossible.}
<C>__{kawakita}
<P>__{(awkward)}
<D>__{i'm sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings, but you know me. telegraph. telephone. tell kawakita. i got the definitive word from cuthbert's secretary. this is dr. frock's last week.}
<A>__{margo is already out the door.}
