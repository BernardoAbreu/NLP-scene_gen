<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{well, who else do you think, dumb ass? the administration? mr. perry? mr. keating put us up to all this crap, didn't he? if he wasn't for mr. keating, neil would be cozied up in his room right now, studying his chemistry and dreaming of being called doctor.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{that is not true, cameron. you know that. he didn't put us to anything. neil loved acting.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{believe what you want, but i say let keating fry. i mean, why ruin our lives?}
<A>__{charlie lunges at cameron again and punches him in the face. cameron falls to the floor as the boys pull charlie away. cameron lifts a hand to his bloody nose.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{you just signed your expulsion papers, nuwanda.}
<A>__{cameron rises to his feet.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{and if the rest of you are smart, you'll do exactly what i did. they know everything anyway. you can't save keating, but you can save yourselves.}
