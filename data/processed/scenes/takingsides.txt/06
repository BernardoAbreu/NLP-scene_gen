<A>__{steve having a nightmare, twisting, turning, moaning. he wakes with a cry. he is sweating. he turns on the light, looks at a clock, reaches for a cigarette, lights it. he smokes. he stares at the ceiling. later: early morning. cold. steve is at the basin in his small room, shaving. a radio on a shelf.}

<D>__{remember, men, no fraternisation. in a german town, if you bow to a pretty girl or pat a blond child, you bow to all that hitler stood for. you bow to his reign of blood. you caress the ideology that meant death and destruction. you never know who was a member of the nazi party. don't be fooled. don't fraternise.}
