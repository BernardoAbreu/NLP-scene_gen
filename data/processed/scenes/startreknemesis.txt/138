<L>__{interior scimitar bridge night}
<A>__{shinzon stands, his eyes glued to the enterprise on the viewscreen. we see a monitor showing that the cascading pulse weapon is locked on the enterprise. most of the light on the shattered bridge now comes from the three steadily pulsing warp core relays which soar up through the floor.}
<C>__{computer }
<D>__{forty seven. forty six...}
<A>__{suddenly a massive blast as the doors to the bridge explode in. shinzon spins to see picard framed in the doorway, phaser rifle ready. picard instantly fires for the cascading pulse control but shinzon dives to cover it the phaser blast hits shinzon in the chest he recoils, slamming to the deck, stunned. the few remaining remans on the bridge spin to picard, firing disruptors picard dives for cover and battles them with his phaser rifle he succeeds in stunning the remans but a final disruptor blast knocks picard to the deck the phaser rifle spins away }
<C>__{computer }
<D>__{twenty nine... twenty eight...}
<A>__{shinzon pulls himself up and races to snatch up a disruptor from a fallen comrade as picard leaps up, grabbing a piece of wreckage, a long metal rod picard thrusts it forward like a spear impaling shinzon. a stunned moment of silence as shinzon gazes at picard, almost with a look of disbelief. blood spews from his mouth as he lets out a tormented cry. and then, amazingly, shinzon forces himself forward pushing picard back against a wall shinzon slowly walks toward picard, forcing himself down the length of the spear the spear point explodes through shinzon's back the weight of shinzon's body is pinning picard against the wall time is running out }
<C>__{computer }
<D>__{eighteen... seventeen...}
<A>__{shinzon forces himself down the spear:}
<C>__{shinzon}
<D>__{i'm glad we're together now our destiny is complete.}
<A>__{he finally thrusts himself down the whole spear and clasps his dying hands firmly around picard's throat }
<C>__{computer }
<D>__{ten...nine...}
<A>__{data sprints to the bridge he instantly tears open his wrist and pulls out the small, silver disc we saw earlier the emergency transport unit he slaps it on picard's shoulder. a final look between them }
<C>__{computer }
<D>__{seven.. six...}
<A>__{data activates the etu picard dematerializes. data looks at the space where picard was and says simply:}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{goodbye.}
<A>__{then he spins and pulls out his phaser and fires point blank into the scimitar's warp core relays the bridge explodes data is incinerated }
