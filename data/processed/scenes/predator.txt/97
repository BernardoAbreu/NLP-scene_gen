<L>__{exterior schaefer and ramirez day}
<A>__{dillon in the b.g., as ramirez parts the brush with his weapon. before them, covered with dirt and leaves, are hawkins' entrails. there is no body.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{what in god's name...?}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{i think it's hawkins.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{where the hell is his body?}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{there's no sign of it.}
<L>__{exterior alleyway day}
<A>__{the entire team is gathered, still holding defensive positions. anna, still stunned, is beginning to come around. she looks up at schaefer. he turns to ramirez. revised "hunter" 4 17 86}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{ramirez, ask her what happened.}
<A>__{ramirez drops to one knee and talks softly to her in spanish. she mutters incoherently in spanish, still dazed, shaking her head. dillon listens closely to her response. ramirez turns to schaefer. he seems confused.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{she says...the jungle came alive, and took him...}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{that isn't what she said... she said...}
<P>__{(pondering; to ramirez)}
<D>__{...she doesn't make sense.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<P>__{(growing angry)}
<D>__{couple of sappers been trailing us all the way from the camp, major. billy heard them. she set us up, ran for it...they were waiting. i should've wasted the bitch when i had the chance.}
<A>__{schaefer, looking at hawkins' bloodstained equipment lying at anna's feet, looks up.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{why didn't they take the radio and his weapon?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{why didn't she escape?}
<A>__{ramirez and dillon look at the equipment and then to the girl, still numb with shock.}
<C>__{dillon}
<P>__{(grimly; remembering)}
<D>__{they did the same thing to davis...}
<A>__{the two veteran commandos look at each other, finding no explanation between them.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<P>__{(urgent; to the others)}
<D>__{i want him found. sweep pattern and double back. fifty meters.}
<A>__{they move out. schaefer moves into the jungle, searching. he crouches at the base of a huge mahogany tree, covered with vines, studying the jungle. he moves away from the tree and into the forest, looking for signs on the ground. where he was sitting, a drop of blood falls. another drop falls, dripping from a leaf and above that, from another leaf. above that, high in the top of the tree, suspended from vines from his ankles, is hawkins' body, his chest a gaping wound. he hands there as if he were an animal, field dressed.}
