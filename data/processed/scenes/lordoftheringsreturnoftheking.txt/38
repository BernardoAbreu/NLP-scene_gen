<A>__{shadowfax arrives at a great citadel on the summit of the city 1000 feet above the pelennor fields. gandalf and pippin dismount, leaving the guards of the citadel to tend to shadowfax. gandalf hurries off . . . close on: pippin as he takes in his surroundings, his eye caught by a dead tree that stands in the middle of the court, four solemn citadel guards standing sentry around it.}
<D>__{pippin ; .}
<P>__{(whisper)}
<D>__{it's the tree. ,}
<P>__{(hurrying after gandalf)}
<D>__{gandalf! gandalf!}
<C>__{gandalf}
<D>__{yes, the white tree of gondor. the tree of the king.}
<A>__{gandalf leads pippin across a flat court of white stones, surrounded by green lawns . . . towards a great hall benejath the gleaming tower. '}
<D>__{ }
<C>__{gandalf }
<D>__{lord denethor, however, is not the king. he is a steward only. a caretaker of the throne.}
<A>__{gandalf lowers his voice, as they approach the tower hall.}
<C>__{gandalf }
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{now, listen carefully. lord denethor is boromir's father. to give him news of his beloved son's death would be most unwise ... and do not mention frodo . . . or the ring . . . and say nothing of aragorn either.}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{in fact, it's better if you don't speak at all, pippin took.}
<A>__{close on: pippin, suitably chastened, nods.}
