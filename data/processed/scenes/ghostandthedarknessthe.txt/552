<B>__{hold on the donkey.}
<A>__{because now something happens that hasn't happened before: suddenly there are no colors, only tones because lions can't see colors, only tones, and that's what's happening we are looking at the donkey from the point of view of the lion }

<A>__{the eyes of the ghost. watching the donkey. and from now on, when we are using patterson's point of view, everything is clouded and thick with mist, and sounds are muted. when we are using the ghost's point of view, everything is totally clear and sounds are thunderous.}
