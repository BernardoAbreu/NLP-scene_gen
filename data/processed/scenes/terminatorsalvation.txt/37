<L>__{interior fast food joint day}
<A>__{ drop down inside behind an upended table in what was once a taco place, remnants of mexican decor. through a dirty window, they see the aerostat buzz past, flying its pattern. it moves on without spotting them, then takes off in a new direction. kyle and star set to searching the place, something they've done many times. they go through trash cans, check behind the counters and in the kitchen. marcus gets up, still looking out the windows.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{that flying grapefruit, what was it?}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{aerostat one of skynet's eyes. they patrol places like this, looking for survivors.}
<C>__{star}
<D>__{yes!}
<A>__{she's come up with some unopened packets of condiments from a bag of trash. kyle trots over.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{any red ones?}
<A>__{she nods excitedly, hands him a packet. he tears it open, sucks down the contents eagerly.}
<C>__{kyle }
<D>__{mm. ketchup.}
<A>__{star discards one packet, sucks at another and immediately makes a pained face and tosses the packet aside.}
<C>__{star}
<D>__{yuk!}
<A>__{marcus picks up the packet, looks at it.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{jalapeno sauce.}
<A>__{star and kyle pause in their eating, stare at him.}
<C>__{star}
<D>__{you can read.}
<A>__{marcus shrugs modestly.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{so can i.}
<P>__{(off star's look)}
<D>__{well, sort of... a little.}
<A>__{with obvious reluctance, star holds a packet of mustard toward marcus.}
<C>__{star}
<D>__{want some?}
<A>__{marcus gallantly waves it away.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{no thanks. not hungry.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{never heard anyone say that before.}
