<L>__{interior ring corridor same}
<A>__{on willie she bursts out the door to the mess and heads toward corridor "b."}
<B>__{door to the swamp}
<A>__{beck moves through the door to the swamp and positions himself by the door. he looks back and we see jones for the first time, flamethrower poised, ready to fire.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{c'mon baby c'mon...}
<B>__{on the shadow of the creature}
<A>__{it moves steadily toward the door, moving right to the doorway. carefully it moves a dark, horrible hand like appendage inside the doorframe.}
<B>__{on beck and jones}
<A>__{poised to kill when suddenly both men hear the same thing.}
<C>__{willie's voice}
<D>__{beck? jones!?}
<B>__{on willie}
<A>__{she turns the corner and freezes. there, less than ten feet away is the creature. a tentacle whips excitedly like a tail!}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{oh god...}
<A>__{as the creature starts to turn for willie, beck suddenly closes the vault like door to the swamp on creature's hand, trapping it vise like in the door.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{run willie! run!}
<A>__{the creature throws back its head and screams in pain as the heavy door severs its appendage.}
<B>__{on beck and jones}
<A>__{as the writhing hand like appendage squirms in front of them jones blasts it with his flamethrower until the hand curls like a piece of bacon and it ceases to move.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{well done. just like momma makes 'em.}
<A>__{beck opens the door the corridor is empty. willie and the creature are gone.}
<B>__{on willie running}
<A>__{she heads back toward the ring corridor around the inner path toward corridor "a". in a full run now, every panel and instrument looks even more sinister where is cobb doc creature? on the dejesus creature's severed appendage as the creature moves after willie we see its bloody stump suddenly sprout a new appendage! like a starfish it grows another leech like tentacle to replace the one it lost.}
<B>__{on willie}
<A>__{she turns down corridor "a". a noise overhead in the water conduit causes her to look up when suddenly a black arm reaches out from the shadows, and pulls her into the dark doorway to the machine floor it is jones! he pulls her between him and beck in the shadows.}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(whispered)}
<D>__{where's cobb and doc?}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(recovering)}
<D>__{cobb's cut...it was in him! it got doc...}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{oh man, that's just great...}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{c'mon.}
<B>__{control room}
<A>__{beck is followed inside by jones and willie. it is empty.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{lock the door.}
<A>__{jones rolls the large vault like door closed and locks them. beck goes to the console and checks the instruments. suddenly he sees something that causes him to freeze in his tracks. a red light blinks ominously on the console.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{shit! he sent them all.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{the escape bubbles?}
<A>__{she and jones stop in front of doc's console.}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(gravely)}
<D>__{look at this.}
<A>__{beck looks at doc's computer screen. on screen we see doc's message: "...hope that our sacrifice will mean that the human race will never know this awful mutation..."}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{the good doctor signed our death warrant.}
<A>__{suddenly there is a tremendous banging on the door! like a}
<B>__{hundred sledgehammers pounding the heavy steel door trying}
<A>__{to break it down. jones readies his weapon but just as suddenly, the banging stops. beck, willie and jones all nervously exchange looks.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{well, at least we're safe inside here.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{for how long?}
<A>__{beck slides behind the console and quickly types in a message. we see it on the screen. "shack six reporting. please disregard previous message " suddenly martin's face appears on the video screen.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{thank goodness, you're still alive!}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(yells nervously at the screen)}
<D>__{hey, man, you better get your ass out here right now and get us. you hear me, motherfucker? right now !}
<A>__{martin smiles calmly back at the three of them.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{please relax, mr. jones. every thing is under control. naturally, when we received dr. warren's message we were concerned but would never have deserted you.}
<A>__{jones lets out a breath. willie stares straight at the screen.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{when are you coming for us?}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(smiles nervously)}
<D>__{well, that's the bad news. the typhoon did turn your way.}
<P>__{(he looks at weather printout)}
<D>__{right now it is on a course }
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{just answer the question, man! when are you coming?!}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{hopefully in the next 48 hours.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{forty eight hours!}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i realize you must have gone through hell }
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{gone? man, we're still here!}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{i can't change the weather. try to get some rest. i will keep you posted.}
<A>__{he turns off his screen and the picture in front of beck, jones and willie goes blank.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{he's right. why don't you get some rest. i will stand the first watch.}
