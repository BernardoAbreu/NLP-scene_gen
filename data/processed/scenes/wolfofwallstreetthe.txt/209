<A>__{(summer `96) off to the side, jordan watches as naomi, their friends, and the yacht's crew members dance to blaring techno music. a small group of italian sailors cheer them on.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{the nice thing about getting rescued by italians is that the first thing they do is feed you and make you drink red wine. then they make you dance.}
<A>__{jordan watches as the dancing continues, then casually glances out a porthole, where we see the distant lights of a plane making its way across the night sky. after a few beats, the plane explodes, a tiny flash of light.}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{did you see that? that was the plane i sent for to come get us. i shit you not, it exploded when a seagull flew into the engine, three people killed. you want a sign from god, well after all this i finally got the message. i had to make some fucking changes.}
