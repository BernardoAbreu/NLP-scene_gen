<A>__{ben is lying face down on his raft in the middle of the braddock pool. the sun shines down. his diving mask is on over his eyes. his face is in the water, looking down at the bottom of the pool. mr. and mrs. braddock, in their bathing suits, are in the pool, paddling around ben. during the entire conversation they continue to swim around and around the raft, trying to talk and keep their heads above the surface.}
<C>__{mrs. braddock}
<D>__{it's pretty embarrassing. i really don't know what to tell mr. robinson. it's ackward and strained for me every time he suggests that you call up elaine.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{next time he suggests it, i will tell him i have no intention of ever calling her up in my life.}
<C>__{mr. braddock}
<D>__{i guess she's not good enough for you, is that it?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{look elaine robinson and i do not get along.}
<C>__{mr. braddock}
<D>__{how do you know? you haven't seen her since high school. i guess your evenings, whatever you do with them, are just too valuable.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{that has nothing to do with it }
<C>__{mr. braddock}
<D>__{i guess i will just tell mr. robinson that you're just too busy every evening doing god knows what }
<C>__{mrs. braddock}
<D>__{don't go on like this. now if benjamin absolutely refuses to take her out }
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{mrs. braddock}
