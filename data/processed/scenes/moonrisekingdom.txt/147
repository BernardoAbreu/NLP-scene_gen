<A>__{sam, suzy, skotak, and the rest of the troop wait at the end of a narrow dock. cousin ben stands below them in a small sailboat. he reaches up to suzy and lifts her onboard. he reaches up to sam and lifts him onboard, too. he rigs the sail. sam smiles sadly. he and skotak do the secret handshake. the others quickly join in. suzy blows them a kiss. everyone looks choked up. cousin ben unloops a line. the sails quickly catch the strong wind, and the boat sails away into the harbor. skotak and the rest of troop wave and salute. they watch, bittersweet. pause.}
