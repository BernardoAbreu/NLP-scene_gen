<L>__{exterior u.s. outpost #31}
<A>__{norris, bundled in his sixty five pounds of clothing, exits the main compound. he walks the prefab wooden planks up the precipice; his destination is someone a hundred yards up the slope to a shack. he grabs onto the steadying ropes and pulls himself against the wind and blowing sleet.}
<L>__{interior macready's shack close on ice cubes}
<A>__{being dumped into a glass, followed by the pouring of whiskey. an electronic voice is heard.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{bishop to knight four.}
<A>__{macready takes a sip of his drink; makes his way over to his electronic chess game. a large mexican sombrero hangs on his back. he is tall; about thirty five. his shack is sparse but unkempt. a few centerfolds on the wall are interspersed by an occasional poster of some mediterranean or south american paradise. the chess game is of larger than normal size. the pieces move automatically with the press of a button. he sits down and chuckles over his opponent's bad move.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{poor little son of a bitch. you're starting to lose it, aren't you?}
<A>__{he confidently taps out his move. his companion's response is immediate.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{pawn takes queen at knight four.}
<A>__{macready's grin slowly fades as he examines the board. there is a pounding at his door. macready broods for a bit, heedless of his visitor and makes his next move.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{rook to knight six. check.}
<A>__{more impatient pounding. macready glares at his opponent for a beat. he bends forward, opens up a flap containing the chess game's circuitry and pours in his drink. there ensues a snapping, popping sound as smoke and sparks rise from the machine; followed by a flush of chess gibberish. macready gets up from his seat, mumbling on his way to the door.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{...cheating bastard...}
<A>__{he opens the door. norris steps in followed by a flurry of snow and wind.}
<C>__{norris}
<D>__{you jerking off or just pissed?}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{we got any more of those electronic chess things down in supply?}
<C>__{norris}
<D>__{get your gear on.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{what for?}
