<D>__{yeah, what the fuck? you said doggies.}

<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{what...}
<C>__{pettengill}

<A>__{the enormity of how badly pettengill has screwed up that in the space of one day, he's committed murder and discovered life on another planet begins to dawn on him. he doesn't handle it well. he's fucked up like few people can imagine. he tries to reset, it doesn't work. the worm twists about, starts to eat the metal right off the entrenching tool. he flicks it back to its relatives.}
<C>__{pettengill}
<D>__{right. right. motherfuck. motherfuck.}

<D>__{jesus...jesus god...}
<A>__{burchenal's joined him. there's nothing they could do. only watch in shock. it gets worse. the worms come. pulsating and undulating towards pettengill. as if some secret message the food is here has spread through the billions of them in burst of knowledge. a diaphanous, hungry wave crests onto pettengill and engulfs him. he's covered in translucence as they devour him. gallagher and burchenal stagger backwards in horror as a red aureole grows around him as he's eaten. color spreads out around him in a perfect ever growing circle. it's a feast.}
