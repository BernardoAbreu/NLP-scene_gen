<L>__{exterior house day}
<A>__{eli and solara are shoved out of the house at gunpoint and marched past the torn perimeter fence to the vehicles. eli has been stripped of his weapons and backpack. redridge faces him and points a pistol at his head.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{where's the book?}
<A>__{beat. eli doesn't answer. redridge cocks the pistol.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{i ain't playing.}
<A>__{redridge stares him down. eli just stares right back. totally unflappable. redridge motions to his men.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{check the pack.}
<A>__{the gunman carrying eli's pack opens it up and tips its contents out onto the ground. the ghillie suit, battery, some old canned goods, other odds and ends. no sign of the book.}
<D>__{carnegie gunman #4 it ain't here.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{it's gotta be.}
<A>__{redridge holsters his gun and frisks eli, going through his pockets. finds nothing. he opens eli's coat and checks the inside pockets. digs around deep inside.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{hello, what have we here?}
<A>__{and then suddenly he shrieks in pain. yanks his hand out to reveal eli's rat, teeth sunk deep into his flesh. redridge flails around violently, trying to get the rat off him, but it won't let go. his hand is bleeding badly.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{fuck! get it off! get it off me!}
<A>__{he finally manages to shake it free. it hits the floor dazed. redridge stomps on it with his boot, reducing it to a bloody smear in the dirt. eli lowers his head in sadness. redridge clutches his bloody hand, glares at eli furiously. pulls his gun again and marches right up to him, pressing the muzzle tight against his forehead.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{if you don't got the book, what fucking use are you?}
<A>__{his finger tightens on the trigger.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{wait!}
<A>__{she breaks from the gunmen holding her and rushes toward redridge. reaches inside her dress and produces the bible.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{it's here! i've got it! please don't kill him.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{solara...}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{it's just a book, eli. no book is worth giving up your life for.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you're wrong.}
<A>__{satisfied, redridge takes the book. runs his hand over the leather cover, gazes admiringly at the gold embossed cross.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{you did good, sweetheart. your daddy would be proud. he knew you'd come through for him.}
<A>__{solara looks at eli guiltily. she feels terrible.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{he said he would hurt my mom. if i didn't help him.}
<C>__{redridge}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{daddy's little girl...}
<A>__{solara stands between him and eli. deadly serious now.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{i want you to let him go.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{you've got what you came for. you don't need him. let him go.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{he's killed a dozen of my men.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{if you hurt him, i'm not coming back with you. you'll have to drag me kicking and screaming.}
<A>__{solara glares at redridge. he sighs. he can tell she means it. it's not worth the aggravation. he turns back to eli.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{take your shit and get out of here.}
<A>__{eli gathers up his stuff into his pack. shoulders it and goes to pick up his sword, but redridge puts his boot on it.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{no weapons.}
<A>__{eli still has a half dozen guns trained on him. he turns and walks away, toward the road. as he passes solara:}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i told you we'd both live. now do you have faith?}
<A>__{a tear runs down solara's cheek as she watches him walk away. redridge grabs her by the arm and pulls her toward the vehicles as his men load up and prepare to move out.}
<B>__{in the rearmost vehicle}
<A>__{solara sits in the back seat, staring out the rear window as it drives down the road at the tail end of the convoy. she watches as eli moves away down the road, getting smaller and smaller until he is just a speck on the horizon. she bursts into floods of uncontrollable tears.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{solara in the back seat, calmer now. the tears dried on her cheeks. she sits staring blankly at the driver in front. and then she lunges violently forward. clawing and biting at the driver, who struggles to fight her off. his hands come off the wheel and the car fishtails wildly. redridge's vehicle the driver sees something odd in the rear view mirror.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{what the hell...?}
<A>__{redridge turns to see the car behind veering erratically then slamming on the brakes, stopping in the middle of the road.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{stop, stop!}
<A>__{the car screeches to a halt. redridge watches through the rear window as the driver's side door opens and the driver is}
<B>__{kicked out onto the asphalt.}
<A>__{the door closes again, the engine revs and the car turns around, racing back down the road in the direction it came.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{shit. turn around!}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{we ain't got the gas for it!}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{she's getting away!}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{we got the book! and we got barely enough gas to make it back as it is! we can't go chasin' her!}
<A>__{beat. redridge knows he's right.}
<C>__{redridge}
<D>__{stupid little bitch...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{drive on.}
<A>__{the car moves on, following the rest of the convoy.}
