<L>__{interior billy moorcroft's house, dining room den day}
<A>__{inside billy moorcroft's quaint, sanitary looking home is a small gathering to celebrate his return. streamers hang over a table supporting a partially eaten cake. a banner that reads `welcome home billy!' is draped across the archway connecting the dining room to the den. billy's mother (32), with her fair complexion and dark hair, is an older female version of billy himself. as she brings a pot of coffee and a stack of cups into billy's father (35), billy's aunt and uncle, and a child psychologist who is moderating (50s; male) in the den, she looks as though she's barely keeping it together.}
