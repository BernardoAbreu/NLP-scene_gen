<L>__{exterior hollow cedar dusk}
<A>__{they lie so close. their bodies touching, not moving. their faces inches apart, so that every word is a murmur...}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{you're like me. you've learned to be devious.}
<A>__{he's never seen her this fragile, this scared. he knows he has to be strong for her.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{it's not devious, it's what we have to do. you're leaving tomorrow...}
<A>__{he unties her hair. so gently. tries to keep his smile calm, steady...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{you write to my house, and put kenny yamashita's name on the return address. it's no big deal.}
<A>__{he brings his face to her hair. kisses it.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{you smell like cedar.}
<A>__{her eyes are wide. they move over his face. a murmured...}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{so do you. it's your smell i will miss as much as anything.}
<A>__{he looks in her eyes. and words come from his heart, before he can stop them...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{let's get married, okay?}
<A>__{her eyes fill with tears. are they from happiness?}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{i want to marry you. is that okay?}
<A>__{her face so still. one tear falls, and he kisses it.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{just say yes.}
<A>__{no answer. not knowing what to say, she winds an arm behind his head, and brings him nearer. his mouth opens into hers, with more force, more of his heart, than he has ever given. deep and tender. his hands reach beneath her dress... ...peel her panties down her thighs...}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{when something that means your whole life. is the last time ever...}
<A>__{and suddenly, he is over her, drawing her legs up around him...}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{god should tell you. or it's not fair.}
<A>__{her head tilts back, her eyes squeeze closed. and as he enters her...}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{please say yes...}
<A>__{...her hands grasp his upper arms. and push away.}
<C>__{hatsue }
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{and he blinks. as if waking from a dream. everything has stopped. her face is strong and yet overflowing with regret.}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{no. no. it isn't right.}
<A>__{so he draws away. stunned, uncomprehending. watching with blank eyes, as she stares up at him. then, with dignity and tenderness, he helps her dress, his eyes awkwardly away from hers...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{it felt right to me. it felt like getting married.}
<A>__{she draws her legs up. kneeling now, putting her hands on his face... but no words come. no words. until...}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{i will write you.}
<A>__{and kisses him fiercely, and bolts up before he can grab her, running off like a deer, while he... ...kneels. his mouth open. like a silent scream.}
