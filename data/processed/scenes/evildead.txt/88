<A>__{ashly glances to the grave and sees linda's necklace on top of the dirt mound. he reaches down to pick it up when linda's hand shoots up from beneath the grave and grabs him! she pulls herself up out of the grave scream ing and clutches ashly's leg with a black and bloodied hand. he twists around, trying to free himself, but she will not let go. by now, linda is almost completely out of the grave. with her fingernails, she rips into ashly's leg, tearing his skin. screaming, he picks up a large log nearby and swings it roundhouse into her face again and again, breaking the wood into smaller bits. she grabs the log with him clinging to the other end, lifts him up and throws ashly log and all, away from her. ashly hits the ground with considerable force and for the first time begins to comprehend the power of this thing he is dealing with. thick black ooze pours from linda's nose and mouth as she turns toward ashly sprawled on the ground.}

<A>__{his fingers tighten on the wooden handle. with a scream, she lunges toward him. from the ground, ashly swings the spade upward, lopping off her head. the head falls into the mud, but the body falls upon him, grabbing and jerk ing about spasmatically. thick black ooze pumps from her neck and ashly manages to pull himself out from underneath the body. he backs away in disgust and falls. he picks himself up again and sees linda's necklace upon the ground. ashly stashes it in his pocket and staggers back to the cabin.}
