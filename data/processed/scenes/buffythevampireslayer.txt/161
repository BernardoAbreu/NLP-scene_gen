<A>__{we see a banner stretched across the central beam of the ceiling. it reads "the earth is our home". a half dozen inflatable globes dangle from the ceiling. nicole and kimberly are stetting up the drinks table, unloading and stacking hundreds of styrofoam cups. jennifer crosses by them, carrying an armful of plastic wrappings and containers.}
