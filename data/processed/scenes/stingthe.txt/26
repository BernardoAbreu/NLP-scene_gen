<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior a dimly lit street night}
<A>__{it's late at night now. hooker and eirie wander along the street together, not really ready to go home, but with no other ideas either. hooker, obviously preoccupied, idly strikes a match on a street lamp as he passes and lets it burn out. he does this several times.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{how do you like that coleman, huh? after three years.}
<C>__{eirie kid}
<D>__{aw come on, it was the only thing to do. he knew he was holdin' ya back.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{we were partners. if it weren't for luther i'd still be hustlin' pinball down at gianelli's. i don't need anything more than i got.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{you ain't gonna have nothin' if you don't lay off them games of chance. there's a depression on ya know.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{there's always a depression on.}
<C>__{eirie kid}
<D>__{if you saved a little, you wouldn't have to grift so much.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{i like griftin'.}
<C>__{eirie kid}
<D>__{you could buy yourself some things. clothes, or a nice car...}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{i don't look any good in clothes and i don't know how to drive. what else ya got to sell, eirie?}
<C>__{eirie kid}
<D>__{forget it.}
<A>__{they walk on a few more feet, when suddenly a police car pulls up alongside them and two men jump out. the first, a uniformed policeman, grabs eirie around the neck. hooker makes a break for it, but the second figure, a burly detective named snyder, tackles him in the middle of the street, drags him back into the alley and plasters him up against a brick wall. the two have met before.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{hi there, snyder. things a little slow down at the bunco department tonight, eh? somebody lose the dominoes?}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{you scored blood money today, hooker. you need a friend.}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(knocking snyder's hand away)}
<D>__{aw, find yourself a shoplifter to roll.}
<A>__{snyder gives hooker a swift knee in the thigh and follows it with an elbow across the head. hooker flies into a row of boxes and garbage cans.}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(getting up slowly)}
<D>__{you got the wrong guy, pal. i been home with the flu all day.}
<P>__{(rising to a fuller height)}
<D>__{you can stake out my toilet if you want.}
<A>__{bang. snyder, infuriated by hooker's irreverence, slams him to the ground again. the policeman is no longer holding eirie but is almost daring him to make a move. eirie wants to go to hooker's aid, but he knows the policeman will beat him to a pulp.}
<C>__{snyder}
<P>__{(pulling hooker out}
<D>__{of the heap and smashing him against}
<P>__{the wall again)}
<D>__{i will tell ya what you did, smart boy. you tied into a loaded mark on 47th across from maxies. you and coleman played the switch for him and blew him off to a cab on 49th. if he hadn't been a numbers runner for doyle lonnegan, it woulda been perfect.}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(startled by the information)}
<D>__{you're crazy. i'm not stupid enough to play for rackets money.}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{not intentionally maybe, but that don't make no difference to lonnegan. he'll swat you like any fly.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{i will square it with the fixer.}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{nobody can buy you a prayer, if i put the finger on ya.}
<A>__{snyder lets go. hooker sinks back against the wall. he says nothing; he's waiting for the price.}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{i figure your end of the score was at least 3 gees. i want 2 no matter what it was.}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(lying)}
<D>__{my end was only one.}
<C>__{snyder}
<P>__{(not taking the fake)}
<D>__{then you'll have to come up with another grand somewhere.}
<A>__{hooker is beat and he knows it.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{all right.}
<A>__{he reaches into his coat, pulls out a stack of bills and counts out $2000 to snyder. eirie looks on in amazement; he didn't think hooker had it.}
<C>__{snyder}
<P>__{(pocketing the money}
<D>__{and motioning his partner to put his}
<P>__{gun away)}
<D>__{you're a smart egg, hooker. no use dyin' for 2 grand.}
<A>__{snyder and his policeman friend get in their car and start down the street. hooker and eirie walk nonchalantly in the other direction.}
<C>__{eirie kid}
<D>__{i thought you blew all your money.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{i did. that stuff i gave him was counterfeit. they'll pinch him the first place he tries to spend it.}
<A>__{snyder and his partner disappear around a corner. hooker suddenly takes off like a shot.}
