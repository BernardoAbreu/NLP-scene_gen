<L>__{interior restaurant night}
<A>__{ethan's pov ethan walks in the glass front doors, right next to an enormous fish tank, part of the restaurant's exterior wall. he scans the clientele carefully maybe a dozen patrons are scattered around. eugene kittridge is seated at a table in the middle. he and ethan make eye contact. ethan walks to the table, a couple of quick, seemingly cursory glances around the room as he goes. kittridge has been working on a pretty good sized lobster. he rises to greet ethan and they sit.}
<C>__{kittridge}
<D>__{i can't tell you how sorry i am. i know how much jim in particular meant to you, ethan. personally as well as professionally.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{he spots a stack of documents on the table. ethan picks them up. there's a canadian picture bearing ethan photo and the name phillipe doucette, credit cards, driver's license, etc.}
<C>__{kittridge}
<D>__{passport, visas you know the drill. we'll work the exfiltration thru canada, debrief you at langley. throw the prague police a bone, you know toss them a few suspects. follow me?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{yeah. i follow you.}
<C>__{kittridge}
<D>__{we've lost enough agents for one night.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{you mean i've lost enough agents for one night.}
<A>__{kittridge seems to be at the point of saying one thing, then, carefully:}
<C>__{kittridge}
<D>__{you seem hell bent on blaming yourself, ethan.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{who else is left?}
<C>__{kittridge}
<D>__{yes. i see your pointerior}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{why was there another team?}
<C>__{kittridge}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{of imf agents. at the embassy. tonight.}
<C>__{kittridge}
<D>__{i don't quite follow you.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{let's see if you can follow me around this room.}
<P>__{(eyes moving around the room)}
<D>__{the drunk russians on the embankment at 7 and 8 o'clock...the couple waltzing around me at the embassy at 9 and 11. the waiter behind hannah at the top of the staircase bowtie, 12 o'clock. the other imf team. you're worried about me. why?}
<C>__{kittridge}
<P>__{(a tight little smile)}
<D>__{you're right. maybe this'll save some time.}
<A>__{the figures around the room have grown restless. kittridge tries to indicate that it's okay. he pulls some papers out of his jacket.}
<C>__{kittridge }
<D>__{for a little over two years now we've been spotting serious blowback in imf operations. we have a penetration. the other day we decoded a message on the internet from a czech we know as "max."}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{the arms dealer.}
<C>__{kittridge}
<D>__{that's right. max, it seems, has two unique gifts a capacity for anonymity and for corrupting susceptible agents. this time he's gotten to someone on the inside he's put himself in a position to buy our noc list. an operation he referred to as "job 314". the job he thought golitsyn was doing tonight.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{but the list golitsyn stole was a decoy.}
<C>__{kittridge}
<D>__{correct the actual list is safe at langley. "golitsyn" was a lightning rod, one of ours.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{this whole operation was a molehunt.}
<C>__{kittridge}
<D>__{yes, the mole's deep inside. and like you said. you survived.}
<A>__{ethan stares at him levelly.}
<C>__{kittridge }
<D>__{i want to show you something, ethan.}
<A>__{he now shoves the papers across the table. they're xeroxed copies of a wisconsin bank account in the name of donald and margaret ethan hunt. it shows a balance of $127, 000.}
<C>__{kittridge }
<D>__{since your father's death, your family's farm has been in sub chapter s and now, suddenly, they're flush with over a hundred and twenty grand in the bank. dad's illness was supposed to have wiped out the bank account dying slowly in america after all, can be a very expensive proposition ethan. so, why don't we go quietly out of here onto the plane...}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{how about if we just go quietly into the bathroom and i wash your mouth out with soap you pathetic button down bureaucratic asshole.}
<C>__{kittridge }
<D>__{ethan, i can understand you're very upset.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{kitteridge, you've never seen me very upset.}
<A>__{ethan takes something from his jacket pocket. while kittridge talks, ethan unwraps whatever is in his hand.}
<C>__{kittridge}
<D>__{all right, enough is enough hunt. you've bribed, cajoled, killed and relied on intimate loyalties to get away with it. you're determined to shake hands with the devil and i'm going to make sure you do it in hell.}
<A>__{we see what ethan holds in his hand it's the piece of bubble gum, half red, half green. he squeezes the gum, mushing the two sides together. ethan lashes out, swatting kittridge's glass of wine off the table in one quick motion. as he does, he hurls the piece of gum. diners look up, startled at the sound of the breaking wine glass. kittridge follows the trajectory of the glass and sees the piece of gum, stuck to the tank. his eyes widen. ka boom! the tiny piece of plastique explodes, shattering the fish tank. a hundred gallons of water flow over the man and woman, knocking them to the ground. at the same time, ethan bolts for the door.}
