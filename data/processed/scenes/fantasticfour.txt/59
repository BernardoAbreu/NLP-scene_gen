<A>__{debbie steps out. there is "welcome home" sign over the door. she looks out. the wind blows softly. something shifts in the darkness. debbie pulls her robe tighter.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{ben?}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{don't come any closer for a sec. this is gonna be kind of a shock... you remember when we said "together forever no matter what"?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{baby, you're scaring me.}
<A>__{a hanging beat. and ben...steps into the light, where we see him for the first time: he's huge, easily twice the size he once was, and an orangy rocky surface covers his entire body. debbie sees him. fear washes over her, not sure what to think. he reaches out, a little tentative. she flinches back.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{oh my g g g. what did you...do to ben?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{deb, it's me. it's still me.}
<A>__{he reaches out. she recoils. it's too much for her. tears swell in her eyes. covering her mouth, she backs away. he takes a step closer. she backs away faster, tripping over her robe, falling into the street. a car screeches to a halt. ben instinctively steps out to help, but she scurries back.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{don't...don't...don't touch me!}
<A>__{her shout wakes neighbors. lights flicker on. ben knows he has to go. he looks at debbie, sensing this is the last time he'll see her. she trembles, terrified. his eyes go moist.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i love you, deb.}
<A>__{with that, he turns away. the "welcome home" sign flutters, falls to the ground. a tragic tableau. as more lights go on around him, ben picks up his pace, speeding into the dawn.}
