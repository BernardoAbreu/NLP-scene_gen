<D>__{alright let's get back to our monster music marathon with this classic called the teddy bear's picnic.}
<A>__{perched on a stool behind the counter sits captain spaulding, a crusty looking old man in a filthy clown suit and smeared make up. the word love is tattooed across his right knuckles and hate is tattooed across the left. he is reading the newspaper, crunching on crackers from a paper bag and halfheartedly listening to a small, nerdy man wearing coke bottle glasses named stucky. stucky thumbs through a stack of autographed 8x10 photographs.}
