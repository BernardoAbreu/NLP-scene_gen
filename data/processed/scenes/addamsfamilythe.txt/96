<A>__{fester is lying in bed, the covers around his chin. abigail sits on the bed beside him, tucking him in.}
<C>__{abigail}
<D>__{i know why you've been so glum. it's because it's taking us a little longer than we'd hoped to find the gold. isn't that right?}
<A>__{fester turns away, depressed.}
<C>__{abigail}
<D>__{of course it is. well, don't you worry we're right on the verge. tomorrow, for certain, my darling.}
<P>__{(she kisses him on the}
<D>__{forehead, and stands. she goes to the door,}
<P>__{and turns)}
<D>__{you know, some people might think it's strange, for a mother and son to be so close. i think it's beautiful. don't you, gordon?}
<A>__{fester mumbles something, under his breath.}
<C>__{abigail}
<P>__{(very stern)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{fester}
<P>__{(dutifully)}
<D>__{yes, mother. it's beautiful.}
<C>__{abigail}
<P>__{(instantly very sweet,}
<D>__{dabbing her eye with}
<P>__{a fingertip)}
<D>__{look i'm weeping.}
<A>__{abigail exits. the minute the door shuts, fester gets out of bed. he is fully clothed. he goes to the window, and begins to climb out.}
