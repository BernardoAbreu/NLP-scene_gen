<L>__{exterior house night}
<A>__{the police arrive: three cars. mark appears at an upstairs window with his camera.}
<C>__{sergeant}
<D>__{look out!}
<A>__{he thinks mark has a gun. they all duck. mark raises his camera and photographs them. the police recover and charge for the house. mark disappears.}
<L>__{interior dark room night}
<A>__{mark hurries back into the room carrying his camera. he knows exactly what he has to do.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{mark! mark! give yourself up!}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i've been ready for this... for such a long time...}
<A>__{rapidly he fixes his camera on to a hook on the wall. then he adjusts the tripod so that the spikes protrude towards him...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{what are you...}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{it'll be all right.}
<A>__{he makes chalk marks on the floor in front of the camera, then switches on all the floodlights. we can hear the policemen pounding on the door.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i can beat that!}
<A>__{he crosses to a switch presses it. the room is filled with a small boy's screaming.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{give yourself up... mark!}
<A>__{he stands next to her, and looks at his long array of cameras. we see that each one of them has been fitted with a small metal disc (a delayed release), and that some of the older cameras have flashlights attached.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{watch them, helen... watch them say goodbye one by one }
<P>__{(he presses a master switch on the wait)}
<D>__{i've timed this... so often...}
<A>__{slowly he walks past his cameras. as he does, the metallic disc on each one explodes with a little plop and the eye of each camera winks once as if in salute. some go off with flashlights on either side of the room. the sound of footsteps hurrying up the stairs. ahead of mark coming steadily closer are the spikes of the tripod. the mirror on the cine camera reflects the approach and helen's terrified face.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{no no!}
<A>__{the child's screaming reaches its peak as mark approaches the spikes... ahead of him, on the small table where his projector stands, is helen's book the magic camera.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i wish... i could have found your faces for you...}
<A>__{the policemen are now rattling on the dark room door.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{helen i'm afraid!}
<A>__{we see his face, terrified, in the magnifying mirror. the spikes are against his throat. the eye of the camera is winking rapidly.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm glad i'm afraid!}
<A>__{heavy shoulders are pressing against the dark room door... as it breaks in, mark lunges forward against the spikes. the cine camera is wrenched away from the wall as he falls back. he crashes against the small table, which falls over. he is not parted from his camera it is fixed to him by the tripod, and falls back with him, covering his face like a canopy. we see his face in the lens of the cine camera. and we see his hand lying limp on the cover of the magic camera. the policemen hurry into the room. they stare motionless at what they see. close shot of helen her face buried in her hands. the child's screaming stops suddenly... and in the absolute silence which follows we hear the voice of mark's father:}
<C>__{father's voice }
<D>__{don't be a silly boy... there's nothing to be afraid of...}
<A>__{and a small voice answers.}
