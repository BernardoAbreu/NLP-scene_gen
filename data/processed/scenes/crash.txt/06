<L>__{exterior ballard apt. balcony night}
<A>__{catherine stands at the railing of the balcony of the ballard apartment, which overlooks a busy expressway near the airport. her arms are spread wide as they were in the airplane hangar, only now it is james, her husband, who is standing behind her. they are both half naked, and he is inside her. their sex making is disconnected, passionless, as though it would disappear if they noticed it. an urgent, uninterrupted flow of cars streams below them.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{where were you?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{in the private aircraft hangar. anybody could have walked in.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{did you come?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{no. what about your camera girl? did she come?}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{we were interrupted. i had to go back to the set...}
<A>__{catherine turns toward james and pulls open her blouse, exposing her left breast. she pulls james's face down and presses her nipple against his cheek.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{poor darling.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{what can i do about karen? how can i arrange to have her seduce me? she desperately needs a conquest.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{i've been thinking about that, about you and karen.}
