<L>__{interior pub. evening.}
<A>__{helen and danny, jenny and david are standing in a quiet, old fashioned pub, warming themselves at an open fire. david has a pen in his hand, and he's holding a book `the lion, the witch and the wardrobe'.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{so. now.is he clive, do you think? or cs?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i'm confused now. i thought you'd made him up?}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(attempting, briefly, to be patient)}
<D>__{no, we...never mind.}
<A>__{david walks over to the nearest table and writes in the book.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{there.}
<A>__{he stands up, hands the book to jenny.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(reads)}
<D>__{"to dear jenny. with the pleasure of meeting you. come and see me again soon. clive."}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{dirty old man.}
<A>__{laughter. he takes a long drink from his pint of bitter. a group of students enter, all carrying musical instruments. they stand at the bar, waiting to be served. jenny stares at them with longing she wants to be one of them. helen, meanwhile, stares at them as if they were aliens.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(sotto voce)}
<D>__{why are university girls so strange looking?}
<A>__{helen's right. the girls in the group are all bespectacled and frumpy. the others laugh.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{it's true. and they can't all have started off that way, can they? most girls aren't ugly, but most girl students are. so there must be something about those places that, you know, makes you fat, or spotty, or short sighted.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{well, if you look at it that way...i mean, that's proper scientific analysis. and you can't argue with science.}
<A>__{helen looks pleased.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i'm still not quite clear on what you want to do when you get here.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i want to read english.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{books?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{sorry?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you want to read english books?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{oh. yes. reading english is just another way of saying...}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i wouldn't worry, jenny. you're wasting your breath.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{anyway, tomorrow we'll try to get more of a feel for the place.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{absolutely. this would be a good place to do a little business.}
<A>__{david catches jenny's eye. this isn't what he meant by "getting a feel for the place."}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{all those little old ladies wandering around...i will bet this place is rife with stats.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{please explain what stats are. you're always going on about them.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{all right. think of a number. now think about the most boring lesson you've ever had at school. now double it. done? doubled? now multiply it by the number you first thought of, and there you are. that's the official boredom content of stats.}
<A>__{jenny laughs.}
