<A>__{gabe at the eye piece, eli beside him, photographing the scene.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{keep rolling!}
<P>__{(calling out to soldiers)}
<D>__{the clothes!...do the clothes!}
<L>__{98 angle on cameron}
<A>__{the men tear him free from the couple shouting playfully.}
<C>__{one man}
<P>__{(dialect)}
<D>__{what are you a field marshal?}
<C>__{second man}
<P>__{(dialect)}
<D>__{wait your turn like the rest!}
<A>__{cameron's confusion changes to helpless fury as he kicks and struggles against a forest of grasping hands ripping his clothes away, passing him back toward the rear of the line.}
<C>__{third man}
<P>__{(dialect)}
<D>__{where are your manners?}
<C>__{whore}
<P>__{(dialect)}
<D>__{this is a whorehouse, not a stable.}
<A>__{whores have left their cots to join in the assault, screeching in glee. as he maniacally lashes out at his good natured molesters, the blood from cameron's face smears a whore's body.}
<C>__{eli's voice}
<D>__{cut!}
<A>__{instantly everything stops. cameron is sprawled half naked on his knees at the end of the line. enraged, he whirls toward eli who has caused this humiliation. then the clapping begins, the cast and crew applauding his stunt. people slap him on the back admiringly. a robe is thrown around him. he is helped to his feet. suddenly nina is there flinging her arms about him and kissing him on the mouth.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{i'm so proud of you...i could just die!}
<A>__{he is pulled away from her by the backslappers. now cameron is responding to this strange new sensation the warmth of public acclaim. he regains his poise, hoping his embarrassing anger wasn't noticed. chuck is now beside him, reaching up to the wound on cameron's face and pulling away the plastic makeup patch with fake blood inside; the "wound" is gone. he starts feeling cameron's shoulders, arms and ribs for possible damage.}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(quietly to chuck, wincing in pain)}
<D>__{why didn't you tell me about the awning? i could have been killed.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{no chance. you were in your mother's arms from the time you hit the sugarglass skylight. those stunt men you fell on would have got you out of anything.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{stunt men?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{the one with the tits and the other guy.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{why didn't you tell me? afraid i'd chicken out?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{eli likes some things spontaneous. makes 'em more believable. you're okay. whaddya want?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{not to think i'm going crazy.}
