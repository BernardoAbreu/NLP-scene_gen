<L>__{interior carl's house, living room continuous}
<A>__{carl and ellie's things are strewn across the floor, a mess from the rough journey. carl rights ellie's chair, sets the lamp upright, slides the table into position. he pushes their two chairs back into their place. carl closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and sits. quiet. nothing, save the distant sound of the falls outside. carl surveys the room. the adventure book rests on a table near him. he opens it and puts ellie's drawing back. he looks through the pages, remembering the newspaper clippings and old photographs, the dreams of young ellie. he turns to the page marked: stuff i'm going to do. carl sighs. he managed to bring the house to the falls, but ellie never made it. he closes the book. but as he does, carl sees something he hadn't before. the blank pages at the end are no longer blank. a wedding photo of the two of them. on a picnic. celebrating birthdays. another and another... photos of their ordinary life together, the ups and downs. carl's face warms. ellie lived the life she wanted: she saw adventure in everyday life. a photo of the two of them sitting side by side, together, in their chairs. beneath it, ellie has written: "thanks for the adventure now go have a new one! love, ellie." carl smiles. he looks over to ellie's empty chair. on the arm is russell's sash. carl picks it up. he looks to ellie's chair. he crosses his heart.}
