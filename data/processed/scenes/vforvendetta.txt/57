<L>__{exterior bishop's quarters night}
<A>__{close on a stain of white vomit and blood on the thick pile of a persian rug. it is encircled in police chalk. pull back to reveal the chalk outline where the body of bishop lilliman was found. the circled bloodstain floats above the head like the last word balloon of a crude comic strip character. the bishop's quarters is slowly being picked over by a forensic team from the nose. a photographer's flash bursts against a painted "v" on the wall near the body outline. at the window, finch chews on his pipe, staring at a plastic evidence bag that contains a single violet carson rose.}
