<L>__{interior wooton sims reception later that morning}
<A>__{willy still unshaved, unslept, in yesterday's suit comes off the elevator, fishing out id as he passes a receptionist:}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{hi, i'm just }
<A>__{ going directly to the key card slot by the glass double doors to the rest of the floor. he swipes his card and pulls the handle but it stays locked. willy swipes his card again. no go.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{excuse me i'm new, i just started and there's something wrong with my card. can you buzz me in?}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{who are you here to see?}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i work here. willy slocum. i'm new }
<A>__{he stops, realizing how he must look.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{nikki gardner. willy slocum, for nikki gardner.}
<A>__{as he calls in, willy sees nikki through the doors one of a half dozen associates trailing in the wake of bob wooton. they all carry expensive business luggage, except wooton who is powerful, perfectly groomed, and two decades older.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{wait a second never mind, here she is, thank you.}
<A>__{willy goes toward the glass doors as wooton comes through nodding deferentially to the boss, semi apologetic:}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{hey...bob }
<P>__{(to nikki)}
<D>__{can i talk to you for a second?}
<A>__{wooton glances back at nikki, eyes saying: don't take long. she nods as wooton and the team continue to the elevators staying back by the glass doors to talk with willy:}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{you let him know what happened last night?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i told him.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{great who do i work with on it while you're gone?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{you don't work with anyone.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{nikki: the man has power of attorney and a health care proxy, he can disconnect her life support whenever he wants. if we don't move fast }
<A>__{nikki explodes but quietly, not wanting the team to hear:}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{jesus, willy, wake up! it's over! what is wrong with you it's first year law: that woman could fully recover and swear he shot her and it}
<C>__{nikki }
<D>__{wouldn't matter. double jeopardy! you can't take him back into court!}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i told you we bring a civil suit }
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{you've got no standing.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{it doesn't have to stick: we just need to get a court order for now to keep crawford from pulling the plug! with all the brain power here, i'm sure somebody can come up with a pretext or call in a favor. then we can tie this up in court while we arrange a state appointed conservatorship so we can protect her while we fight him on }
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{what's the point, willy?}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{the point?!}
<A>__{willy stares. because she's drawn a line in the sand. one he already crossed, without truly understanding...and now he's standing out there alone feeling the sand slither away under his feet.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{this man is going to kill his wife.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{yeah.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what does that have to do with wooton sims?}
<A>__{willy just breathes. vulnerable like we have never seen him before. he looks across the big reception area, at wooton and the team of associates. some look away.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i warned you.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{no, this is insane.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{it's what it is.}
<A>__{ding! the elevator. nikki grimaces, frustrated and sad:}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i warned you.}
<A>__{she starts for the elevators, willy following }
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{you're not really just gonna let this happen, are you?!}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh i'm supposed to lose my job over your problems?!}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{my problems?! wait a second this is not about my anything any more }
<A>__{willy grabs nikki's arm to stop her, turn her around and she shoves him away, hard, tears welling in her eyes willy letting her go as the receptionist quietly calls for help and nikki hurries into the waiting elevator. the associate holding the doors lets them go.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{this is about taking a couple of goddamn weeks off to try and save a woman's life!}
<A>__{the doors begin to close. willy stands facing the cluster of lawyers in expensive suits, their expressions ranging from pity to contempt except nikki, whose eyes are full of shame and guilt and defensive anger. as the doors shut across them. willy doesn't move. confused, humiliated, frustrated. he turns when a bunch of other lawyers emerge from the offices, ready to act as bouncers. people gawk from behind the glass doors. beat. willy holds up his palms.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{don't bother. i got it.}
<A>__{he bangs open the paddle sign on the stairway door, setting off the fire alarms as he stalks out.}
