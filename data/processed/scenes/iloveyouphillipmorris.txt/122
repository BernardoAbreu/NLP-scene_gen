<L>__{interior usamm boardroom 1996 day}
<A>__{steven sits in a board meeting, surrounded by all of the company honchos. dan lindholm lords over the gathering at the head of the table while a suit (mark) reads from a report to the group.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{crossover from traditional markets shows declination and inverse diffusion seems commensurate with net trade trending. hmo penetration still leads ppo, nmo and fmo as usual but attenuation is growing more prevalent in q4 as projected... as for q3, well q3 is what q3 always is: q2 with training wheels.}
<A>__{everyone laughs, but no one quite as hard as steven who desperately tries to fit in. larry birkheim, the ceo of usamm sits beside dan lindholm. he chimes in.}
<C>__{birkheim}
<D>__{okay steven, your turn. i know you've only had the one quarter to play catch up but i tell you, we can't wait to get some insight here.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{sure. what about?}
<C>__{birkheim}
<D>__{mark's projections.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{mmm hm. sure.}
<C>__{birkheim}
<D>__{they seem kind of flat.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{oh. okay. ummm...}
<A>__{steven fumbles through some folders and vamps a while.}
<C>__{steven }
<D>__{well i did a lot of work here and uh... i think maybe... well i could just read it to you but uh... it might be better to just uh...}
<A>__{the group looks at him quizzically. just as it seems steven has been up to nothing }
<C>__{steven }
<D>__{well, i will just show you. todd?}
<A>__{todd, an incredibly hot assistant unveils an easel full of detailed tables. steven walks the board through an incredibly well prepared presentation.}
<C>__{steven }
<D>__{if you look here at mark's projections again for q3, you'll see well you'll see they're just that projections. projections based on a model set by my predecessor. i decided to reject that model and do things a little differently. i want to show you my results. this is what we actually made in q3 }
<A>__{todd flips to the next card. the graphs grow exponentially. the group is intrigued.}
<C>__{steven }
<D>__{now let me tell you how i did it...}
<A>__{todd unveils another card, the men are impressed by the unseen image. and as steven explains himself, dan and birkheim smile broadly and turn to each other with smug assurance.}
