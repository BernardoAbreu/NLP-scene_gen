<A>__{claire finishes bagging groceries. looks up to see ronna coming to open the next register.}
<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{claire doesn't say anything, a pointed silence. ronna keys in, checks the drawer. claire returns to her register. ronna tries to make eye contact, but no luck.}
<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{okay, real mature.}
<A>__{claire continues to ignore her, turning her back. she straightens coupons, rubber banding them.}

<C>__{ronna}
<D>__{alright. mistakes were made. things didn't go exactly as planned.}
