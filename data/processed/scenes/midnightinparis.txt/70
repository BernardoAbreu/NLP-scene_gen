<D>__{where does gil go every night?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you heard her. he walks and gets ideas.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{you sound skeptical.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't know. i see what he earns but sometimes i think he's got a part missing. and i didn't like his remark about tea party republicans. they're decent people who want to take back the country they're not crypto fascist, airhead zombies. did you hear him say that?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{nevertheless i hardly think your idea of having him followed is practical.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no? i'd like to know where he goes every night.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{well we know one thing he doesn't go dancing.}
