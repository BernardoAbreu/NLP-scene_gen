<L>__{interior the catacombs night}
<A>__{behemoth!!! the size of a house hellboy head smoking writhes in the grip of the tentacle. it suddenly throws him toward the ceiling. as he arcs back down, abm!! he cracks the floor wide open. next to him: the rosary and the explosive belts. he tries to grab them. the tentacle slams down, blocking his way. the vibration sends the belts down into the crack. they bounce off a small ledge and land further down. far below, grinding cogwheels and gears. hellboy manages to pull a steel sword from the closest marble statue. hellboy stands up and swings the sword for all he's worth. fwap! he cuts clean through the tentacle. the tip hits the floor, rolling into the crack. from out of behemoth's stump... a mass of wriggling tentacles replaces the cut off section! they squirm around hellboy's face as he slashes, again and again, fighting his way forward. he leans into the crack, stretches his arm, struggling to grab the belts. a few inches short. he jumps into the crevice, onto the first ledge. it crumbles!! the gears below grind a few falling bricks. the belts slide away. a tentacle captures hellboy, pulls him up. at the last second, he grabs the belts with his tail. the beast raises hellboy high. a multi layered mouth opens in the body of behemoth. the most horrible proboscis ever seen. hellboy's tail passes him the belts. the timers on them are crushed. a spark spurts: useless.}

<A>__{he pulls the pin on all the explosives. behemoth drops him into a squid like beak and gulps him down. after a moment, a weird gurgle emanates from the creature's innards. then }
