<A>__{randy lies on a scrunched up mattress on the floor, unable to sleep. the van wall is decorated with a mini shrine randy has built to himself. old magazine and newspaper clippings, mini posters, etc. a few changes of clothes lie in a messy heap in the corner. he grabs a bottle of pills and pops a few, washing them down with a beer. he closes his eyes, trying to unwind.}
