<C>__{rebecca}
<P>__{(watching band)}
<D>__{this is so bad, it's almost good.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{this is so bad it's gone past good and back to bad again...}
<A>__{close up on enid, we see the party from her pov: the six or seven most popular students huddle closely together.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{just think, we'll never have to see any of these creepy faces ever again.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{unless they're in your summer school class!}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{shut up!}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{uh oh... don't turn around...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{what? why?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{forget it...}
<A>__{melorra, an ambitious, incessantly upbeat classmate, approaches them.}
<C>__{melorra}
<D>__{oh my god, you guys! i can't believe we made it!}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{yeah, we graduated high school how totally amazing.}
<C>__{melorra}
<D>__{so what are you guys doing this summer?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{melorra}
<D>__{i'm going to be in this actor's workshop, and i'm hoping to start going on auditions soon. i'm so excited to finally have some free time. we have to get together this summer!}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{oh yeah, that'll definitely happen...}
<C>__{melorra}
<P>__{(spotting better people to talk to)}
<D>__{well, bye you guys... congratulations!}
<A>__{melorra leaves.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{since when is she an "actress"?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i know, she needs to die immediately.}
<A>__{todd, a friendly but slightly below average looking guy, approaches from behind.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{hey rebecca!}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{oh... hi...}
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(pause)}

<C>__{todd}
<D>__{oh, hey enid...}
<P>__{(starting over)}
<D>__{so... we finally made it!}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{yep.}
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(awkward pause)}
<D>__{so... where are you going to college?}
<C>__{enid}
<P>__{(before rebecca can answer)}
<D>__{we're not.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{really? both of you?... why not?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{just because.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{we have other plans.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i guess i should have figured that you two would do something different.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{what are you going to be when you grow up, todd?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{well i'm going to major in business administration and, i think, minor in communications.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{see, that's exactly the kind of thing we're trying to avoid.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<A>__{todd starts to talk again but enid has noticed something off to the side.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{so... i }
<A>__{enid grabs rebecca and turns her away from todd before he can finish his sentence.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{oh my god, look! is stacy himmler going out with rod harbaugh?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{how perfect.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{he better watch out or he'll get aids when he date rapes her.}
<A>__{todd, forgotten, walks away. the singer wails a sappy, maudlin ballad. enid spots dennis, the class loser, wandering around by himself.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{god, just think, we'll never see dennis again.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{good.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{god, think about that... that's actually totally depressing.}
