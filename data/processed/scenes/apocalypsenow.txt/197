<L>__{interior dining room group tracking shot}
<A>__{track down the long table, covered with delicious food. the p.b.r. crew sits with others of the de marais group. the table is headed by st. lefevre. chef's face lights up as he regards the wonderful european style food.}
<C>__{chef}
<D>__{this food is wonderful ! i can't believe the chef is a slope.}
<P>__{(turning to clean)}
<D>__{some more?}
<A>__{opposite the table, sitting next to the chief, lance reaches hungrily for bread and other food with his hands.}
<C>__{chef}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hey lance.}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{huh? oh. um, wouldya .. wouldya pass me the rice a roni, please.}
<A>__{and then he looks to his friends for approval. our view reveals that behind a transparent silk curtain there is another, more elaborate table, where the de marais family is dining with willard. our view moves through the curtain and settles in a medium view of the group. the men rise as a very attractive woman enters the room. willard finally does as well, and she moves to the chair next to him.}
<C>__{gaston}
<D>__{roxanne, i hope you are feeling better.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{je vais bien maintenant.}
<C>__{gaston}
<D>__{may i present captain willard? he is of a paratroop regiment. you know the difference between a paratrooper and a regular soldier, don't you , my dear?}
<C>__{roxanne}
<P>__{(smiling and taking willard's hand)}
<D>__{yes, they come from the sky.}
<A>__{she sits there's an uneasy silence. willard is caught with this exotic woman on one side of him, and the ongoing conversation on the other. he is forced to face toward gaston, and drawn to look at roxanne.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{i would like to know more about the .. uh, plaque...}
<A>__{philippe turns around, points to an elaborately scripted wooden plaque with various tallies on it.}
<C>__{gaston}
<D>__{attacks repulsed, as i was saying.}
<P>__{(hard)}
<D>__{this is only for this war, captain. viet cong 54; north vietnamese regular forces 15; south vietnamese 28 regular forces and otherwise.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{americain 6. of course, they were, perhaps, mistakes, captain.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{of course. i once we make our repairs, we could send word, we could have you evacuated from here.}
<C>__{gaston}
<D>__{captain?}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{you'll get blown outta here some day.}
<C>__{gaston}
<D>__{we will never 'evacuate', captain this is our home. indochina is ours; it has been so for a hundred and twenty one years, there is something to say for that.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{the vietnamese think it's theirs i guess the americans do, too.}
<C>__{gaston}
<D>__{but we civilized it. a place belongs to those who bring light to it, don't you agree.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{i always thought the french came here to get the rubber.}
<C>__{philippe}
<D>__{excuse me, i must attend to my men.}
<A>__{he gets up, and leaves abruptely followed by his wife.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{may i ask where the captain is going in his little boat?}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{we were going upriver when we got caught in a storm, ma'am.}
<C>__{gaston}
<D>__{upriver? why upriver? there is nothing there, only jungle.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{do you know that jungle?}
<C>__{gaston}
<D>__{when i was a boy, my father would take me there, to hunt. there are a few savages, but no man can live there, no white man.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{what about an american named kurtz?}
<A>__{there is a pause.}
<C>__{gaston}
<D>__{we have never heard of him.}
<A>__{gaston rises, and takes roxanne's hand.}
<C>__{gaston}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{bon nuit, roxanne bon nuit, captain.}
<A>__{willard turns.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{good night.}
<A>__{gaston leaves. willard and roxanne are left alone. the servants clear the table.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{you must realize, captain we have lost much here i, my husband. gaston his wife and son.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{i'm sorry to hear that.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{cognac?}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{i should be checking on the boat.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{the war will still be here tomorrow.}
<A>__{she walks out of the room.}
<C>__{willard}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{i guess so.}
<A>__{he follows.}
