<ACTION>__{CRANE SHOT of the six guest violinists on stage for the Grand Finale, each one sharing a music stand with a student. Roberta nods, and they begin THE BACH DOUBLE CONCERTO. She turns to face the audience as she joins them. MOVE IN AND PAN the performers and students: NAAEM shares a stand with ARNOLD STEINHARDT; ISAAC STERN stands and plays with GUADALUPE, sitting beside him; ITZHAK PERLMAN sits and plays next to CARLOS, standing beside him; MICHAEL TREE plays beside DE SEAN; DIANE MONROE plays beside LUCY; KAREN BRIGGS plays beside THOMAS, and MARK O'CONNOR plays beside STEPHANIE. NICK plays cello; LEXI plays the piano behind them; and, playing with her own solo music stand, ROBERTA. Their expressions are serious and passionate, broken by occasional smiles lighting on faces: Isaac Stern... Lucy... Carlos... Itzhak Perlman... Diane Monroe... De Sean. The song finishes and the APPLAUSE begins. The OTHER FIDDLEFEST PLAYERS come out from back stage, RAMON in front, and join the rest. More applause. The CAMERA PULLS BACK TO INCLUDE the audience facing the stage, then REVERSES to show the audience standing in the orchestra and balconies. We see the students' PARENTS; JANET, ISABEL and their families; ASSUNTA, LAWRENCE and DOROTHEA; DAN; CONCEPCION, MANUELO and their sons; BRIAN; and DENNIS -- even he can't stop himself from applauding. BACK AGAIN to the stage where the students and guest violinists bow... and MOVE IN CLOSER on ROBERTA in her moment of triumph.}

<ACTION>__{Roberta Guaspari lives in East Harlem with her daughter Sofia, whom she adopted from El Salvador. Nick is a professional cellist in a graduate music program, and Alexi has been accepted to medical school. Roberta teaches violin to approximately 150 students a year in three East Harlem elementary schools. The East Harlem Violin Program, however, is still not funded by the New York City Board of Education. The money raised from Fiddlefest supported Roberta's violin program for three years. Roberta and Opus 118 continue their fundraising efforts to keep the program alive.}
