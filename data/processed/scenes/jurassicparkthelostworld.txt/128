<A>__{kelly remains huddled under the fallen shed, trembling with fear. she holds her breath and freezes, as just outside, only two feet from where she's hiding a raptor's feet pick their way past her, down the middle of the street. kelly closes her eyes and suppresses a scream.}

<L>__{exterior rooftop night}
<A>__{nick and malcolm burst onto the roof of the now burning hotel and slam the door behind them. the helicopter is now only three rooftops away. they turn and head for it, nick in the lead, but there's an eight foot gap between the buildings.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{it's too wide!}
<A>__{nick looks around, desperate. a fallen power pole leans against the building they're standing on, its lines gone slack.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{help me push this!}
<A>__{malcolm understands. he and nick throw a shoulder into the pole and give it a mighty push, tipping it over in the other direction. one good hard shove and it falls to the far building, thudding against it solidly. its power lines are not taut, a lifeline from this rooftop to the nexterior nick grabs hold and starts to pull himself across the gap, hand over hand. behind them, the door of the building splinters and crashes open as a raptor throws all its weight into it. malcolm leaps onto the power line without hesitation and starts pulling himself across. but even with the door wide open, the raptor on the other side hesitates. it snarls and backs away, refusing to come out onto the roof. on the other rooftop, malcolm lands next to nick on the second rooftop. they look back at the frightened animal, which takes tow steps out onto the roof, snarls, and backs into the doorway again.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{it's afraid to come onto the roof!}
<A>__{malcolm looks around, at the rooftop. strange bits of scrap and debris seem to have been arranged there, in an odd, concentric pattern.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{something's wrong.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{look! sarah!}
<A>__{he points to the roof of the kilm house, in the distance. malcolm turns, and sees sarah crawling across the tile. his face turns white.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{she's alone!!}
