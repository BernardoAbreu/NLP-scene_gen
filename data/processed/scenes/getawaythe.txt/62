<A>__{the buick streaks down the center of the roadway... two bombs detonate into fireballs... the hay truck blazes upward, bales instantly igniting. the grange at the opposite end of town becomes an orange flame inferno... traffic stalls on the boulevard; drivers and pedestrians gawk at the twin blazes. rudy zig zags the buick along. maneuvering through the stopped traffic. doc slides the ford through a right and left turn, emerging onto smoke covered main street. the speeding ford avoids a halting car, then suddenly spins out of control, jumps across the sidewalk, splinters a wood bench, and finally slides in a complete circle across the grass of a small park.}
