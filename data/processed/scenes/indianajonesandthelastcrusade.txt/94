<A>__{vogel gets to his knees as the huge zeppelin rises into the sky above him, revealing an airplane attached to the belly of the airship. vogel shakes his fist at the rising zeppelin.}

<D>__{du wirst nochmal boren von mir!}
<L>__{interior zeppelin day}
<A>__{indy and henry together again in their compartment.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{you know, sharing your adventures is an interesting experience.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(meaning elsa)}
<D>__{that's not all we shared. it's disgraceful. you're old enough to be her fa er, her grandfather!}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{well, i'm as human as the next man.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i was the next man.}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{ships that pass in the night...}
<A>__{henry opens his diary and begins to thumb through it.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{do you remember the last time we had a quiet drink? i had a milk shake.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{hmmm... what did we talk about?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{we didn't talk. we never talked.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{and do i detect a rebuke?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{a regret. it was just the two of us, dad. it was a lonely way to grow up. for you, too. if you had been an ordinary, average father like the other guys' dads, you'd have understood that.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{actually, i was a wonderful father.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{when?}
<A>__{henry looks up from his diary.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{did i ever tell you to eat up? go to bed? wash your ears? do your homework? no. i respected your privacy and i taught you self reliance.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{what you taught me was that i was less important to you than people who had been dead for five hundred years in another country. and i learned it so well that we've hardly spoken for twenty years.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{you left just when you were becoming interesting.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{dad, how can you ?}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{very well. i'm here now.}
<A>__{he closes the diary and leans back in his seat.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{what do you want to talk about? hmmm?}
<A>__{indy stutters uncomfortably as henry stares at him, waiting for a response.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{well... i can't think of anything.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{then what are you complaining about?}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{look, we have work to do. when we get to alexandretta we will face three challenges.}
<P>__{(he reads from the diary)}
<D>__{"first, the breath of god. only the penitent man will pass. second, the word of god, only in the footsteps of god will he proceed. third, the path of god, only in the leap from the lion's head will he prove his worth. "}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i don't know. we'll find out.}
<A>__{sunlight falls across the table from the window. indy reaches for the drink. the bar of sunlight turns like the hand of a clock over the tabletop across the drinks. we see indy puzzled. only for a moment.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{they're turning around. they're taking us back to germany.}
