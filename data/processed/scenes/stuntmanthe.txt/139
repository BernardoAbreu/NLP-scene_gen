<L>__{interior rehearsal hall day}
<A>__{in one of the private dining rooms off the lobby, tables and chairs are pushed against the wall to make room for a rehearsal now in progress. some early morning tourists have gathered outside the entrance, watching. a few members of the kitchen staff peer through an inside doorway. sam and key crewmen stand on the sidelines as eli rehearses with nina.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{the graveyard's over here...}
<P>__{(he takes a few steps)}
<D>__{...her car's parked here.}
<P>__{(sets down a folding chair)}
<D>__{...lots of these little graveyards along the roadside...most of the stones are unmarked...}
<A>__{he takes nina by the hand and pulls her down beside him, kneeling on the floor.}
<C>__{eli }
<D>__{you're tired...you're broke...all things which meant so much are gone. what's left is a single memory... that brief bright love.}
<A>__{nina's listening intensely but something catches her eye. among the tourists at the doorway stands cameron, who has paused to watch, his costume slung over his shoulder. he nods to her with a small tender smile. subtly, so eli won't notice, she smiles back, then renews her concentration.}
<C>__{eli }
<D>__{...you spent your month's pension in hiring the car. you just can't look for his grave any longer...so you pick one...any one. you kneel... then lay the flowers down.}
<P>__{(yells to the prop man)}
<D>__{what have we got for her?}
<C>__{property man}
<D>__{i got roses.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{no...something she picked herself... wildflowers or something.}
<A>__{sam crosses over to them and kneels beside eli and nina.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(hesitantly)}
<D>__{eli. an idea, maybe. instead of flowers, what if she brought him the things of their life together...of their sexuality...like her nightgown, her underclothes...}
<A>__{eli looks at him thoughtfully.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{'course they'd be rags by now, but let me show you this...}
<A>__{from a paper bag, he takes a small bronze casting of a bear and a girl on a swing beneath a tree. he sets it down.}
