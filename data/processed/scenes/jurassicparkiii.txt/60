<D>__{eric! are you here?}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{eric!}
<A>__{all listen for a response. nothing. paul and amanda exchange a despondent look. sitting on the reception counter is an official looking telephone. everyone has the same thought, but no one dares. finally }
<C>__{amanda }
<D>__{what the hell.}
<A>__{amanda puts the receiver to her ear. nada. with grant in the lead, they head deeper into the building. unseen by the group, a fleeting shadow flits across the lobby's dirty windows with terrifying speed.}
