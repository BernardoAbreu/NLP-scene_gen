<A>__{the second floor of a two story house has been turned into a one bedroom studio. a partition separates the living area from the bedroom. sara walks past a collection of saxophones and several framed pictures of herself. aside from the saxophones and the pictures, there's hardly any furniture. roy lights a cigarette.}

<D>__{not much of what you're used to. but the water's hot and the fridge is full. and i made room in the closets for you. girl's gotta have closets, right? you even get your own bed. i will crash on the couch.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{you bought a bed?}

<P>__{(slight bow)}
<D>__{pardon me. your own futon. check it out. on the other side.}
<A>__{suitcase in hand, sara walks around the partition. her "room" is an old futon, an ancient set of drawers. she stands in the middle of nothing, wanting something to do. she removes framed photos of glynn from her backpack, places them around the room.}
