<L>__{interior max's apartment night}
<A>__{max's pov through the microscope. max sees the brain structures. just then, there's a knock on the door. the knock startles him and his hand bumps the turret of the microscope. the lens moves and he realizes that the magnification can be changed. a knock again. max looks out the peephole and sees nothing. confused, looks down at his thumb. it's not shaking. he heads back to his microscope. there's a knock again. max angrily unlocks the door and whips it open. in the hallway is jenna with her calculator.}

<C>__{jenna}
<D>__{please, max.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i'm working now, later okay?}
<A>__{max shuts the door and returns to the microscope. he changes the magnification. at a weaker magnification, the mathematician sees that the cells are grouped in spirals. max is stunned, he grabs the phone and pulls a business card out of his pocket he quickly dials a number. someone answers with a "shalom" on the other end of the line. max asks for lenny meyer and is put on hold.}
