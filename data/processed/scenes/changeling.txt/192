<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior execution area night}
<A>__{the door to the prison yard opens and closes as northcott is led into the area with the scaffolding. the warden is there, waiting at the foot of the gallows, along with a chaplain. several other parents, including mr. and mrs. clay, are in the witness gallery at the back, separated from the gallows area by a large plate glass window. christine is among the parents. the clays see her, and put a hand on her arm for strength. christine nods, accepting it, and moves to one side. northcott, legs and arms bound in chains, makes his way to the warden at the base of the gallows. a clock reads 9:50. changeling a true story}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{gordon stewart northcott, you have been found guilty of murder, the penalty for which is death by hanging. there have been no stays or reprieves, therefore the execution will go forward as stipulated under the laws of the state of california. do you have any last words?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{no...nothing.}
<P>__{(to chaplain)}
<D>__{i kept clean after i confessed, reverend...just like i said i would.}
<A>__{the chaplain nods silently as the warden looks to the guards, who begin to escort northcott up the steps to the gallows.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{will it...will it hurt?}
<P>__{(no reply)}
<D>__{please...not so fast...don't make me walk so fast!}
<A>__{they struggle with him now, pushing and carrying him up the last of the thirteen steps to the top. they tie his legs together, and cinch his arms tightly in place.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{thirteen steps...thirteen steps... but i didn't touch all of 'em, you bastards...i didn't touch all of 'em!}
<A>__{they start to slip a black felt mask over his head and secure the rope. he looks desperately to the witnesses.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{a prayer! please, somebody, say a prayer for me!}
<A>__{the mask goes on and is tightened into place. the executioner approaches the handle that will open the trap door. the warden looks to the clock...9:59. from beneath the hood we hear, in a terrified, shaking voice:}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{silent night...holy night...all is calm...all is bright...round yon virgin mother and child...holy infant so tender and mild }
<A>__{just then the warden nods to the executioner who pulls the lever and the trap door jerks open. changeling a true story northcott falls through the door six feet then there's a snap...and the body bounces in slow motion at the end of the rope...as we hear the sound of his heart slowing...slowing...until it finally stops. christine covers her eyes. there is no cheering in the witness room. only the sound of weeping.}
