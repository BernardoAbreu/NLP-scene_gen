<L>__{interior restaurant later}
<A>__{walter, toni and brandon finish dessert.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{i should've ordered two.}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{what'd the doctor say, walter?}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{oh yeah, i've been meaning to tell you. i had a check up yesterday. afterwards he was very concerned. he sat me down, looked me in the eye and said, "walter, who do you like in the buffalo oakland game?" walter laughs. he reaches to toni's plate, lifts a dessert pitcher.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{you didn't touch the sauce.}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{neither should you, walter.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{i read chocolate's good for you.}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{i'm not raising a kid alone.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{don't get dramatic, toni. in biblical times you'd just move in with my brother morty. toni shoots him a look and walter quickly sets down the sauce.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{ wow. what a meal. do you feel good, brandon? content?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{very.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{yeah, i can tell. don't be. ever. one week's over, another begins. the past is merely a prologue. in this job you have to push the envelope every day. brandon glances at a nearby table, catches the eye of a stunning girl sandwiched between two middle aged, overweight men. walter catches the eye contact before she looks away. the girl seems bored as the two big men heartily chow down.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{look at that. beauty and the beasts. what do you think of her, brandon?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{she's cute.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{cute doesn't half cover it. the girl's gorgeous. and bored out of her mind. waiting for some young buck to save her from those two gorillas. check it out. she's eyeing you again, brandon.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{so are the two guys she's with.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{i will bet you 10 to 1 on a 1000 you can't pick her up, cash, if you leave with her. toni c'mon walter. you might as well go to atlantic city and open a house account. you know you can't gamble.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{who's gambling? it's a challenge. if brandon leaves with her i give him ten thousand dollars, that's probably more than he made last year. if not, he gives me a grand, which i will give to you.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{i don't bet, walter. (glancing over, look from the girl) ... but i do love a challenge.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{all right. before you bust a move, just one thing... (talks across the table, addressing the model and the two men) excuse me, i don't mean to interrupt but walter con'd i have to know what's going on here. you're drop dead gorgeous and your dates look like they haven't missed a meal since christ died. seriously, you two are eating like you have a date with the electric chair. what's the story with you three? i'm not gonna sleep if i don't know. lemme guess. garment district. the hardy boys make lingerie and you're a model. that it? close? sprechenzee english? sit down, sit down i'm just joking. i better stop before i get stabbed with a fork. bon apetit. (turning back, toni staring at him)}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{what the hell was that?}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{i will send over a bottle of champagne. toni you'll pick up their check.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{the voice of reason. she's right. i owe 'em a meal. hey here we go, brandon, your girlfriend's going to the bathroom. the girl glides by their table. heads up a flight of stairs.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{well get moving, slick. brandon after that introduction?}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{hey, i just raised the bar. c'mon, kid. john anthony could close her. beat. brandon looks from walter to toni.}
<C>__{toni}
<A>__{i'd prefer brandon... brandon smiles. he walks through the restaurant, up the stairs as the women's room door opens and the girl emerges before him. she regards brandon. jaded, disintested air.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{you're beautiful.}
<C>__{girl}
<A>__{(stepping past) excuse me.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{i just want to get to know you.}
<C>__{girl}
<A>__{you just want to get into my pants.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{i want to get into your mind, your heart, your soul. i don't see you wearing any pants in this equation. beat. this could go either way before the girl smiles.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{i'm brandon. what's your name? girl alex.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{alexandria. beautiful name for a beautiful girl. brandon leans in close, talking too low now for us to hear. selling hard. alexandria laughs at something he says and }
