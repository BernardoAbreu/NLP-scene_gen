<L>__{interior cara's bedroom moments later}
<A>__{frank strolls into the room, barefoot, in his boxers. the bed is unmade. cara has left a shirt over a chair... he picks it up and holds it to his face for a moment to enjoy her lingering scent. he notices a newspaper... a copy of the international herald tribune is open on her bedside table. he lifts it to see what cara had been reading. there is a personal ad that has been lightly dotted with a ball point pen. the message is just a list of words: "tom corry now in a mica can if feeling pest still around." the dots single out letters in a code... frank picks up the pen and puts a faint line through the groups of unselected letters to reveal the message: "tomorrow 11 caffe pesaro" frank studies this for a moment.}

<D>__{breakfast.}
<A>__{frank reaches for the doorknob... then pauses. breakfast again? he quietly slides the chain on. peers through the spyhole. spyhole pov two tough looking men in suits stand there: most definitely not hotel staff. one has a scar on his face... demidov's bodyguards. frank is frozen. scarface takes out a silenced pistol and mutters something in russian to his partner. he produces a lock pick set and crouches out of frame. frank hears the sound of scratching metal and clicking tumblers inside the lock. he looks around wildly. sees the key on the entryway table and reaches for it... ch chunk. the russian picks the lock and slowly starts to open the door. the chain stops it. a pause. a moment later a knife comes through the crack and starts to slide the chain... frank stares at the knife; he has to act fast... frank throws his shoulder against the door. the knife clatters to the floor as the door slams shut. frank jams his key into the lock and turns the bolt into place. there's angry confusion on the other side of the door. frank grabs a heavy glass ashtray and swings it at the back of the key breaking it off in the lock. frank scrambles out of the way... the sound of metal scraping in the lock. russian cursing can be heard just outside. a heavy blow as they try to shoulder the door open... frank looks around desperately for an escape. the bathroom? the sitting room? adjoining doors? none. there's nowhere to go. frank bolts for the balcony in his bare feet. he scrambles outside as... pop! pop! pop! bullets rip through the wood and metal, blasting the lock assembly apart. the door bursts open.}
