<L>__{exterior dirty hank's bar day interior dirty hank's bar continuous}
<A>__{a popular watering hole. a dark rustic interior, blasting alternative rock. plenty of underage students carry pitchers of beer to their tables. evan and thumper play pool against two young women. heidi, beautiful, wears ripped jeans, no make up. she sinks the eleven ball off the rail. kristen coolly smokes a cigarette, confident that she and heidi will hold the table.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{so... which one of you has a pet worm?}
<A>__{thumper proudly steps forward.}
<C>__{thumper}
<D>__{worms, plural.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{that's so gross.}
<A>__{thumper steps back, points to evan.}
<C>__{thumper}
<D>__{talk to him about it, he's got the fetish.}
<A>__{heidi sinks another ball and looks up at evan strangely.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{actually, they're for a psych project. a study on memory.}
<A>__{heidi misses her shot and passes the cue to evan.}
<C>__{heidi}
<P>__{(stifling a yawn)}
<D>__{shit, better explain before all the excitement gives me a heart attack.}
<A>__{evan speaks as he knocks the one ball in the corner pocket. as he talks, at a table behind them, some obnoxious greeks, including hunter, spencer, and gwen make fun of thumper.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{it's an experiment with flatworms and a maze. you take a flatworm and run it through the maze until he's memorized it. then you put a new flatworm in the maze. he's clueless. banging into walls, getting lost, whatever.}
<C>__{thumper}
<P>__{(thoughtfully)}
<D>__{like ozzy.}
<A>__{gwen giggles as spencer throws popcorn at thumper's head.}
<C>__{spencer}
<D>__{ten bucks says he eats it off the floor.}
<A>__{thumper seems oblivious to their taunts as evan knocks the three ball in the side.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{you chop up the smart flatworm and feed it to the dumb one and presto, the dumb one suddenly knows the maze inside and out.}
<A>__{evan walks past heidi, putting his hand on her shoulder to squeeze by. the hand lingers longer than necessary and heidi doesn't mind. he sinks another ball.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{just by absorbing the first worm into its cellular structure, it gets all of the worm's memories.}
<C>__{thumper}
<P>__{(thoughtfully)}
<D>__{that's probably why hannibal lecter's so smart.}
<A>__{a handful of popcorn hits thumper's face. they all try to ignore hunter and spencer's jeers.}
<C>__{heidi}
<D>__{so what's the point?}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(setting up the eight)}
<D>__{maybe if i can figure out how the memories of a simple worm function, it'll help me understand the complexities of the human brain.}
<A>__{another barrage of popcorn hits thumper's jacket. although his hand clenches on the cue. he meekly shuffles away to the opposite side of the pool table from the cackling greeks.}
<C>__{heidi}
<P>__{(intrigued)}
<D>__{so are you planning on becoming a doctor or something?}
<A>__{thumper casually takes the pool cue from evan.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{no, i just don't want to lose my mind.}
<A>__{as heidi digests this, thumper carefully lines up his shot... the eight ball. crash!!! the cue ball intentionally jumps the table, rocketing into the pitcher of beer on the greek's table. they're all soaked with beer and debris. just as they begin to rise, thumper smashes the cue stick on the table, whistling innocently (while now brandishing a spear). they sit the fuck down. kristin, impressed, casually wraps her arm around thumper's waist. he smiles coolly, it's nothing.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(to heidi)}
<D>__{i think that's your game.}
