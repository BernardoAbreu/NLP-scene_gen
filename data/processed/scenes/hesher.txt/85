<A>__{tj and hesher push nicole's car off to the side of the road.}
<L>__{interior hesher's van moments later}
<A>__{hesher drives. nicole's in the passenger seat shaken by the turn her day has taken. tj is in the back.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{sometimes, you know, a day is bad and then when you think it couldn't get any worse you suddenly discover whole new ways it can get worse.}
<A>__{hesher reaches over her and pulls a joint from the glove compartment. he lights the joint and takes a big toke. he offers it to nicole.}
<C>__{nicole }
<D>__{no, thanks.}
<A>__{hesher shrugs and takes another big toke then offers it to tj who also declines.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{this one time i had like four hella drunk chicks in the back of the van, and we were going for it and i had one hand on this one girl's tit and my other hand on this other chick's twat, but there was like still two other girls wanting to get off so like i had my foot rubbing on one girl's asshole while i'm trying to eat the other girl out, and i was going crazy man. it was too much. i couldn't work out which chick was which and i'm making one girl cum but then i'm forgetting about the others and my tongue's hurting and my fingers are getting tired and like eventually i was just like 'fuck this. this is too much' and i just stepped back. i just stepped back. and before you know it these girls are all working on each other, you know. they're all fingering each other and eating each other out, you know, and i jerk myself off and everyone's a winner, you know?}
<A>__{nicole looks at hesher like he's crazy. tj is in the back he can't believe what's coming out of hesher's mouth. a moment passes.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{was that some kind of perverted metaphor for me? about how i should just step back and let things work themselves out?}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{a what?}
<A>__{he reaches for the stereo and cranks the knob metallica's, 'motorbreath' blasts through the speakers. as if he were possessed by the music, hesher veers dangerously off the road onto a dirt patch. he has a crazed look in his eyes. tj and nicole grab onto anything they can hold onto. hesher turns the wheel hard and floors the gas. the van spins in circles spraying dirt in every direction. tj gets thrown from the back seat onto the ground. dirt pours into the windows and covers them from head to toe. hesher corrects the wheel and veers back onto the road again. he turns the knob on the radio to an easy listening station. ub40's 'red red wine' plays. a car honks as an angry driver passes.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{what the hell was that?}
<A>__{hesher looks over at nicole.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{i saw a mouse.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{tj picks himself up off the van's floor, dusting himself off.}
<C>__{nicole }
<P>__{(to tj)}
<D>__{are you ok?}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{i have dirt in my mouth.}
<A>__{tj scrapes his tongue with his fingers. nicole breaks a little smile.}
