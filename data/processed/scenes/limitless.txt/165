<D>__{i realize that this is a useless platitude, but... if there's anything we can do...}
<C>__{van loon}
<D>__{obviously we want to be as helpful and respectful as possible.}
<C>__{mrs. atwood}
<D>__{thank you so much. i rely on your discretion.}
<A>__{she shakes both of their hands. a driver has the door open for her; she gets in, now out of earshot.}
<C>__{van loon}
<P>__{(low)}
<D>__{you think there's a proxy?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{cagey fuck like him giving away power of attorney?}
<A>__{eddie shakes his head. the two men look at each other darkly. the driver closes her door, turns and now eddie can see his face. it's tan coat. with a huge, angry scar slashed across his cheek. eddie and tan coat look at each other. a steely moment of recognition. tan coat turns away, gets in the driver's side. van loon watches the car pull away.}
<C>__{van loon}
<D>__{well. he'd better get better.}
<A>__{we push in on eddie's face. who now knows.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{but atwood wouldn't get better. because atwood was out of mdt.}
