<A>__{gregor is seated where we saw him last at the little table in the corner cafe. he's been here for hours, observing the town square, and now, he finally sees what he's been looking for two men, definitely not tourists here for the music, have entered the square everything about these guys screams gunmen. now, as gregor watches a punked out teen comes up to the men and hands them a small envelope. the gunmen look around the square, trying to see where gregor is, but he's too far back in the shadows. the gunmen ask the teen a question, to which the teen can only shrug his shoulders. now the teen walks away, leaving the gunmen to open the envelope and look at its contents, which are quickly read. from off screen we hear the sound of gregor punching in a number on his cell phone. simultaneously, the gunmen finish reading the instructions gregor has sent them, and turn around to face a pay phone. the phone rings, and one of the gunmen goes to pick it up.}
