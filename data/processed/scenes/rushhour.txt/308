<L>__{interior bachelor apartment day}
<A>__{the flames have engulfed both sets of curtains and have begun to creep across the floor and the ceiling. carson glances over at the electronics on the tv: 4:55 pm. the family is coughing from the smoke, trying not to panic. in the kitchen, lisa can't cough through the tape on her mouth. she's freaking out. seeing this, carson runs over to her and pulls the tape off. she starts screaming, so he grabs her face.}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{okay... work with me here!}
<A>__{he grabs one of the refrigerator handles and pulls, but it won't come loose. lisa cries out in frustration.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{hurry, please hurry...}
<A>__{carson spots javal's toolbox. in it, he finds a socket set handle, which he levers in between the refrigerator handle and the door. he rips one handle loose, then the other. carson turns his attention to the booby trapped chairs. lisa sits on the floor, frantically pulling her handcuffed hands around her feet so they're in front of her, then runs for the front door. just as she reaches it:}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{don't!}
<A>__{he grabs her before she opens the door. there's a small magnetic sensor at the top of the door jamb.}
<C>__{carson}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{we have to go out the window.}
<C>__{mrs. han}
<D>__{can't you disarm the bomb?}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{too risky. let's concentrate on getting you out of here.}
<A>__{he looks at the meters on the electronic units.}
<C>__{carson}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{sound detectors?}
<C>__{mrs. han}
<D>__{sam covered them with chewing gum.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{high tech problem, low tech solution.}
<A>__{carson looks at sam, impressed, then peers under the chairs.}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{pressure sensors. use 'em in convertibles: bad guy sits on your seat, he sets the alarm off. these are rigged backwards get up, you set 'em off.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you a bomb expert?}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{nope. but i've had some car alarms in my day.}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{for all the goddamn good they do...}
<A>__{carson looks around, thinking. he spots the roll of duct tape on the table, grabs it and unrolls a long piece.}
<C>__{carson}
<P>__{(continuing; to mrs. han)}
<D>__{slide your arm forward... watch the meter... keep the pressure on the armrest with your elbow...}
<A>__{he wraps the armrest with tape, cinching it tight.}
<C>__{carson}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{it'll squeeze the sensor, duplicate the weight of your arm... okay... pick it up.}
<A>__{they look at each other, scared... after a beat, she does. the meter jiggles... but stays in the black! everyone sighs with relief. carson repeats the process on her other armrest.}
<C>__{carson}
<P>__{(continuing; to sam)}
<D>__{low tech solution...}
<P>__{(to mrs. han)}
<D>__{lean back... carefully.}
<A>__{carson feels for the sensor in the seat, finding it buried under mrs. han's thighs. he runs a long piece of tape around the seat and wraps it tightly. he tries to lift mrs. han, but the meter moves to the red.}
<C>__{miranda }
<P>__{(thru radio in his pocket)}
<D>__{how's it going in there?}
<C>__{carson}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{nag, nag, nag...}
<A>__{he wraps another piece of tape around the seat, and tries again to lift her. this time it works!}
