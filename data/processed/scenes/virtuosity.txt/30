<B>__{inside the upscale nightclub}
<A>__{sid 6.7 has separated the patrons into four separate groups: older men and woman, and younger men and woman. all are frozen in their seats with fear. sid 6.7 points his gun at one group, then another, waving his arm as if he were a conductor, and as if his gun were a baton. sid 6.7 clearly enjoys this game of terror. he delights in the patrons' fear, and revels in his power over them.}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<D>__{good... very good... nice...}
<P>__{(pointing at a woman)}
<D>__{you in the middle don't hold back. give it to me!}
<A>__{he fires his gun just above her head. she screams in terror.}
<C>__{sid 6.7 }
<D>__{that's better...}
<A>__{he continues aiming his gun from face to face, seeking ever increasing emotional responses from his "instruments." a guy entering the bar does a quick about face. gone by the time sid 6.7 glances at the door.}
<C>__{sid 6.7}
<D>__{god, i hate interruptions.}
<P>__{(to the patrons)}
<A>__{once again, from the top boom! he shoots again, just missing a man's foot.}
