<A>__{the paraplegic eugene, seated by the window, meticulously cuts a long fingernail into numerous clippings. he places the clippings in small plastic bags and seals them. he then begins to fill tiny sachets with blood. he turns as he hears jerome enter down the spiral staircase with the groceries.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{you didn't forget the truffles?}
<A>__{jerome places the items in the refrigerator in the bathroom and retrieves a bottle of vodka the vodka incongruous looking beside the blood and urine specimens. joining eugene at his workbench, he pours them both a drink.}
<C>__{eugene}
<P>__{(sensing something amiss, trying to keep his humor)}
<D>__{who died?}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{the mission director.}
<C>__{eugene}
<P>__{(misinterpreting the deadpan remark)}
<D>__{you wish.}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{they found him in his office this morning beaten so bad they had to check his nametag.}
<A>__{eugene takes in the news, a smile broadening across his face.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{what an act of benevolence a service to the community. so that's it. now there's nothing between you and ignition.}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{he was still warm when they confirmed.}
<C>__{eugene}
<P>__{(confused by jerome's attitude)}
<D>__{this calls for a celebration. doesn't it?}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{the place is crawling with hoovers.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{so what? you didn't kill him, did you?}
<A>__{jerome shoots him a glance for the inappropriate remark.}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{that's not the pointerior}
<C>__{eugene}
<P>__{(scoffing)}
<D>__{hey, how much of you can be there? even if the "j. edgars" do find something, in a week }
<P>__{(glancing up to the night sky)}
<D>__{you'll be slightly out of their jurisdiction.}
<P>__{(gently chiding)}
<D>__{come on, we've got to get drunk immediately.}
<C>__{jerome}
<P>__{(still tempering eugene's enthusiasm)}
<D>__{you're going to have to earn your supper. i've got my final physical tomorrow.}
<A>__{jerome wheels eugene's chair to a specially constructed platform that allows the wheels to spin in mid air. jerome tapes an electrode to eugene's chest and attaches the wire to a slim recording device. eugene begins to spin the wheel of the chair faster and faster. jerome monitors eugene's steady heartbeat through a set of headphones.}
