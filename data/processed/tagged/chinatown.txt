<A>__{without waiting for a response, he does. the secretary half rises in protest but gittes is through the inner door. mulwray's inner office the walls are covered with commendation, photos of mulwray at various construction sites, large maps of watershed areas and reservoirs in the city. on the desk is a framed, tinted photo of evelyn in riding clothes. gittes moves to the desk, watching the translucent pane in the upper half of the door leading to the outer office as he does. he begins to open and close the desk drawers after quickly examining the top. he tries one of the drawers and it doesn't open. he reopens the top drawer, and the bottom one opens. he looks in it, pulls out a checkbook. he opens it, riffles through the stubs like he was shuffling cards. drops it, finds a set of keys, an old phone book, and a menu from a water department lunch at the biltmore hotel in 1913. then, he flips through them, reads one notation in mulwray's neat hand:}
<D>__{"tues. night. oak pass res. 7 channels used."}
<A>__{gittes spots a shadow looming in front of the translucent pane. he quickly tosses item after item back, kneeing the drawer, nearly knocking a spare pair of mulwray's glasses off the desk top when he does. he catches them, puts them on the desk and is pacing the room as the door opens.}

<D>__{i wonder if you'd care to wait in my office?}

<D>__{you see, this whole business in the paper with mr. mulwray has us all on edge.}
<L>__{interior yelburton office}
<A>__{smaller than mulwray's, he has most noticeably a lacquered marlin mounted on the wall. there are a couple of other pictures of yelburton with yellowtail and other fish he's standing beside. there's also a small burgee of a fish with the initials a.c. below it, tacked onto the wall.}
<C>__{yelburton}
<D>__{after all, you work with a man for a certain length of time, you come to know him, his habits, his values, and so forth. well either he's the kind who chases after women or he isn't.}

<C>__{yelburton}
<D>__{help yourself.}
<A>__{gittes fishes a couple off the tray, puts them in his handkerchief pocket. he goes out the door, nearly running into a man who is standing by the secretary's desk, about gittes' age only a head taller and a foot wider, dressed in a plain suit that fits him about as well as a brown paper bag.}

<D>__{j.j. gittes to see mr. mulwray.}
<A>__{he hands the chinese butler a card from his wallet. the butler takes it and disappears, leaving gittes standing in the doorway. gittes stands, and sweats, watching a japanese gardener trim a hedge. there's a squeaking sound. gittes moves a few feet off the porch.}

<A>__{a chauffeur is washing down a cream colored packard with a chamois. steam rises off the hood. the squeaking has obviously come from the chamois.}

<D>__{you wait, please.}
<A>__{gittes is left standing by the pond. it's suddenly very quiet except for the runnning water. the pond is over flowing. after a moment, the gardener comes running back. he smiles at gittes, probes into the pond. there's something gleaming in the bottom of it. gittes notes it. after a moment, the gardener drops the long probe, the waters recede.}

<D>__{yeah sure. bad for glass.}
<A>__{the gardener nods, and is off, leaving gittes staring at the object in the bottom of the pond that is gleaming. he looks at the tool the gardener was using, hesitates, picks it up and starts to probe into the pond himself, toward the gleaming object. he then spots evelyn rounding a turn, coming down the trellised pathway. he casually belts the probe, holds onto it for poise. evelyn is wearing jeans that are lathered white on the inside of the thighs and laced with brown horsehair. she's wearing riding boots, is perspiring a little, but looks younger than she did in the office.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{yes, mr. gittes?}
<A>__{gittes is a little taken aback at seeing evelyn. he is annoyed as well. nevertheless, he is elaborately polite.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{actually, i'm here to see your husband, mrs. mulwray.}

<D>__{that's not his apartment.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{anyway... i... the point is, mrs. mulwray. i'm not in business to be loved, but i am in business, and believe me, whoever set up your husband, set me up. l.a.'s a small town, people talk.}
<A>__{he waits for a response. then:}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(continuing; uneasily)}
<D>__{i'm just trying to make a living, and i don't want to become a local joke.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{mr. gittes, you've talked me into it. i will drop the lawsuit.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i said i will drop it.}

<P>__{(a little concerned)}
<D>__{why?... what on earth for? look, hollis seems to think you're an innocent man.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{well, i've been accused of many things, mrs. mulwray, but never that.}
<A>__{again he laughs a little nervously. again no reaction.}

<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you see, somebody went to a lot of trouble here, and i want to find out, lawsuit or no lawsuit. i'm not the one who's supposed to be caught with my pants down... so i'd like to see your husband. unless that's a problem.}

<P>__{(with a slight edge)}
<D>__{what do you mean?}

<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{you may if you can, mr. gittes.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(determined to be polite)}
<D>__{well, that little girlfriend, she was attractive in a cheap sort of way of course. she's disappeared. maybe they disappeared together somewhere.}

<P>__{(with rising anger)}
<D>__{suppose they did. how does it concern you?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{nothing personal, mrs. mulwray, i just }
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{it's very personal. it couldn't be more personal. is this a business or an obsession with you?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{look at it this way. now this phony broad, excuse the language, says she's you, she's hired me. whoever put her up to it, didn't have anything against me. they were out to get your husband. now if i see him, i can help him. did you talk this morning?}
<A>__{evelyn brushes lightly at the horsehair on her jeans.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{no. i went riding rather early.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{looks like you went quite a distance.}
<C>__{evelyn}

<A>__{she finishes, looks plaintively at gittes. escobar is right at her back. gittes says nothing.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{and when did mr. gittes inform you that these rumors had some foundation in fact?}
<A>__{evelyn looks at escobar but doesn't know how to answer him.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(smoothly)}
<D>__{just before the story broke in the papers, lou.}
<A>__{escobar nods. they begin to walk slowly, again have to move out of the way as some other corpse is being wheeled out of one of the coroner cubicles.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{you wouldn't happen to know the present whereabouts of the young woman.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{or her name?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{no.}

<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{will you need me for anything else, lieutenant?}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{i don't think so, mrs. mulwray. of course you have my deepest sympathy and if we need anymore information, we'll be in touch.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{i will walk her to her car, be right back.}
<A>__{escobar's pov evelyn glances at gittes. they go through a couple of outer doors and pass several reporters who have been in the outer hall, laughing, kidding, the tag end of lines like "only in l.a." and "southern cafeteria." gittes hurries her past the reporters who flank them, asking questions. gittes brushes them aside.}
<B>__{evelyn and gittes at her car}
<A>__{in a small parking lot. evelyn fumbles in her bag, looking feverishly for something in her purse.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{mrs. mulwray?... mrs. mulwray.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(flushed, perspiring)}

<D>__{a check?}

<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{no. it was an accident.}

<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{that's right.}

<D>__{out of respect for his civic position.}

<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{what'd he do, lou, make a pass at your sister?}
<A>__{escobar stops.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{no, he drowned a cousin of mine with about five hundred other people. but they weren't very important, just a bunch of dumb mexicans living by a dam. now beat it, gittes, you don't come out of this smelling like a rose, you know.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{oh yeah? can you think of something to charge me with?}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{when i do, you'll hear about it.}
<A>__{gittes nods, turns, and walks down the hall.}
<B>__{outside morgue}
<A>__{gittes stops by a body on the table, the toe tagged with mulwray's name. morty is standing near it in a doorway to an adjoining room. a radio is on, and with it the announcement that they're about to hear another chapter in the life of lorenzo jones and his devoted wife, belle. another coroner's assistant sits at the table, listening to the radio and eating a sandwich. gittes ambles into the room.}

<P>__{(a cigarette dangling out of his mouth)}
<D>__{jake, what're you doin' here?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{nothin', morty, it's my lunch hour, i thought i'd drop by and see who died lately.}
<A>__{gittes picks up the sheet and pulls it back. camera gets its first glimpse of mulwray's body. eyes open, the face badly cut and bruised.}
<C>__{morty}
<D>__{yeah? ain't that something? middle of a drought, the water commissioner drowns. only in l.a.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(looking at. mulwray)}
<D>__{yeah. banged up pretty bad.}
<C>__{morty}
<D>__{that's a long fall.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{so how are you, morty?}
<A>__{morty is wheeling in another body with the help of an assistant.}
<C>__{morty}
<D>__{never better. you know me, jake.}
<A>__{as he begins to move the body into the refrigerator, he breaks into a wrenching spasm of coughing. gittes spots the other body, lowers the sheet on mulwray.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(picking up on cough)}
<D>__{yeah, so who you got there?}
<A>__{morty pulls back the sheet.}
<C>__{morty}
<D>__{leroy shuhardt, local drunk used to hang around ferguson's alley.}
<A>__{morty brushes some sand from the man's face, laughs.}
<C>__{morty}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{quite a character. lately he'd been living in one of the downtown storm drains. had a bureau dresser down there and everything.}
<A>__{gittes has already lost interest. he starts away.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{morty}

<C>__{gittes}

<P>__{(a little puzzled)}
<D>__{yeah, under hollenbeck bridge, what's wrong with that?}
<A>__{gittes has moved back to the body, looks at it more closely.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{it's bone dry, morty.}
<C>__{morty}
<D>__{it's not completely dry.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{yeah, well he ain't gonna drown in a damp riverbed either, i don't care how soused he was. that's like drowning in a teaspoon.}
<A>__{morty shrugs.}
<C>__{morty}

<D>__{jesus, this town...}
<L>__{exterior sunset boulevard gittes day}
<A>__{he's parked on an overpass. the sign hollenbeck bridge on one of its concrete columns. gittes looks down into the riverbed below.}
<B>__{from the bridge}
<A>__{gittes can see the muddy remains of a collapsed shack, its contents strewn down river from the bridge. below him, lying half over the storm drain and one wall that was on the bank of the river is a sign that proclaims "own your own office in this building $5000 to $6000" which was used as a roof of sorts. downstream, there's the dresser, an oil drum, a ford seat cushion, an armour lard can, etc. the trashy remains of shuhardt's home. gittes scrambles down the embankment and as he lands near the storm drain one shoe sinks, ankle deep into mud. gittes pulls it out, swearing. he begins to walk a little further downstream when he hears the vaguely familiar squishy clop of something. clearing the bridge on the opposite side is the little mexican boy, again on his swayback horse, riding along the muddy bank. they look at one another a moment.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(calling out to him)}
<D>__{you were riding here the other day, weren't you...?}
<A>__{the boy doesn't answer.}

<D>__{when it comes? what'd you tell him?}
<C>__{the boy}
<D>__{comes in different parts of the river. every night a different part.}
<A>__{gittes nods. the horse snorts. the boy rides slowly on.}
<L>__{exterior riverbed dusk}
<A>__{gittes scrambles up the embankment to note the direction the storm drain by hollenbeck bridge takes. it is headed above toward the hollywood hills, where the sun is setting.}
<L>__{exterior gittes in car nightfall}
<A>__{winding his way up a section of the hollywood hills. he picks up on an open flood channel with the spotlight by the driver's windwing.}
<B>__{gittes in car moving}
<A>__{along the flood channel. it is dark now and gittes follows the channel with the car spotlight. he turns at a fork in the road which allows him to continue following the flood channel.}
<B>__{further up moving}
<A>__{the road is narrower. gittes drives more slowly. foliage is overgrown in the channel so its bottom cannot be glimpsed.}
<B>__{still further night}
<A>__{the road is dirt. heavy clusters of oak trees and eucalyptus are everywhere. it is very still. another turn and a pie shaped view of a lake of lights in the city below can be}
<B>__{glimpsed.}
<A>__{pov chain link fence over the road, bolted. it says "oak pass reservoir. keep out. no trespassing." the chain link itself actually extends over the flood channel and down into it, making access along the channel itself impossible. gittes backs up, turns off the motor, the car lights, the spotlight. a lone light overhead on tension wires is the sole illumination. there is only the eerie sound of the tension wires humming. gittes gets out of the car, clubs the fence near the flood channel itself.}
<B>__{on the other side}
<A>__{gittes carefully works his way up through the thick foliage toward a second and large chain link fence. lights from the reservoir still higher above can be seen. suddenly there is a gunshot. then another. gittes dives into the flood control channel, which is at this point about four feet deep and six feet wide. there is the sound of men scurrying through the brush, coming near him, then retreating. gittes loses himself among the ivy in the channel. he waits. the men seem to have passed him by. but there is another sound now. an echoing growing sound. it puzzles gittes. he starts to lift his head to catch the direction.}
<B>__{gittes in flood control channel night}
<A>__{then he's inundated with a rush of water which pours over him, knocks off his hat, carries him down the channel, banging into its banks, as he desperately tries to grab some of the overgrowth to hang on and pull himself out. but the force of the stream batters him and carries him with it until he's brought rudely to the chainlink fence. it stops him cold. he's nearly strained through it. swearing and choking, he pulls himself out of the rushing water by means of the fence itself. drenched, battered, he slowly climbs back over the fence and makes his way toward his car. at gittes' car he fishes for his car keys, looks down. one shoe is missing.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(grumbling)}
<D>__{goddam florsheim shoe, goddammit.}
<A>__{he starts to get into his car but mulvihill and a smaller man stop him. mulvihill pulling his coat down and pinning his arms, holding him tightly. the smaller man thrusts a switchblade knife about an inch and a half up gittes' left nostril.}

<P>__{(shaking with emotion)}
<D>__{hold it there, kitty cat.}
<B>__{close gittes}

<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{wanna guess? no? okay, lose their noses.}
<A>__{with a quick flick the smaller man pulls back on the blade, laying gittes' left nostril open about an inch further. gittes screams. blood gushes down onto his shirt and coat. gittes bends over, instinctively trying to keep the blood from getting on his clothes. mulvihill and the smaller man stare at him.}
<C>__{the smaller man}
<P>__{(continuing)}

<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{you'll have to explain that, mrs. mulwray.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(a flash of annoyance)}
<D>__{look, i do matrimonial work, it's my metiay. when a wife tells me she's happy her husband is cheating on her it runs contrary to my experience.}

<D>__{sweaty?}

<D>__{tough guy, huh?}
<A>__{gittes looks, sees she's kidding, and nods.}
<B>__{outside in the parking lot dusk}
<A>__{gittes' car has been brought by the parking attendant. the attendant opens the passenger side for evelyn.}

<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{okay, go home. but in case you're interested your husband was murdered. somebody's dumping tons of water out of the city reservoirs when we're supposedly in the middle of a drought, he found out, and he was killed. there's a waterlogged drunk in the morgue. involuntary manslaughter if anybody wants to take the trouble which they don't. it looks like half the city is trying to cover it all up, which is fine with me. but, mrs. mulwray.}
<P>__{(now inches from her)}
<D>__{i goddam near lost my nose! and i like it. i like breathing through it. and i still think you're hiding something.}

<A>__{the secretary immediately gets up and goes into the inner office. gittes turns and strolls around the office a moment. he sees a photographic display of "the history of the dwp. the early years", along the wall. he stops as he spots a photo of the man with the cane gittes had seen photos of earlier. he is standing high in the mountains, near a pass. the caption reads "julian cross. 1905". cross is strikingly handsome. gittes immediately pulls out the envelope containing evelyn's check. he looks at the corner of it, his thumb pressing down under the middle initial c, then he looks back to the photos. the secretary returns.}

<D>__{mr. yelburton will be busy for some time.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{well i'm on my lunch hour. i will wait.}

<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{i take a long lunch. all day sometimes.}

<D>__{yes.}

<P>__{(really surprised)}
<D>__{how did they get it away from him?}
<C>__{secretary}
<P>__{(a sigh, then)}
<D>__{mr. mulwray felt the public should own the display. the water. if you'll just read the display.}

<P>__{(glances back, hums, then)}
<D>__{mulwray? i thought you said cross owned the department.}

<D>__{they were partners.}
<C>__{secretary}
<P>__{(testily)}
<D>__{yes. yes, they were partners.}
<A>__{she gets up, annoyed, and goes into yelburton's inner office. gittes goes back to the photographs. he hears a scratching sound, apparently coming from just outside the outer door. he moves quickly to it, hesitates, swiftly opens the door. workmen are behind it, scraping away mulwray's name on the outer door, looking up at gittes in some surprise. the secretary returns, sees the workman on the floor.}

<C>__{yelburton}
<D>__{mr. gittes, sorry to keep you waiting. these staff meetings, they just go on and on.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{yeah, must be especially tough to take over under these circumstances.}
<C>__{yelburton}
<D>__{oh yes. hollis was the best department head the city's ever had. my goodness, what happened to your nose?}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i cut myself shaving.}
<C>__{yelburton}
<D>__{you ought to be more careful. that must really smart.}

<D>__{i never was.}

<P>__{(stops smiling)}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{neither do i, actually. but you hired me or you hired that chippie to hire me.}
<C>__{yelburton}
<D>__{mr. gittes, you're not making a bit of sense.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{well, look at it this way, mr. yelburton. mulwray didn't want to build a dam and he had a reputation that was hard to get around, so. you decided to ruin it. then he found out that you were dumping water every night. then he was drowned.}
<C>__{yelburton}
<D>__{mr. gittes! that's an outrageous accusation. i don't know what you're talking about.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{well, whitey mehrholtz over at the times will. dumping thousands of gallons of water down the toilet in the middle of a drought. that's news.}
<A>__{gittes heads toward the door.}
<C>__{yelburton}
<D>__{wait. please sit down, mr. gittes. we're... well, we're not anxious for this to get around, but we have been diverting a little water to irrigate avocado and walnut groves in the northwest valley. as you know, the farmers there have no legal right to our water, and since the drought we've had to cut them off. the city comes first, naturally. but, well, we've been trying to help some of them out, keep them from going under. naturally when you divert water you get a little runoff.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{yeah, a little runoff. where are those orchards?}
<C>__{yelburton}
<D>__{i said, the northwest valley.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{that's like saying they're in arizona.}
<C>__{yelburton}
<D>__{mr. gittes, my field men are out and i can't give you an exact location...}
<A>__{gittes nods.}
<C>__{gittes}

<C>__{yelburton}
<D>__{yes...}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{hard working, have a wife and kids...}
<C>__{yelburton}
<D>__{yes...}

<D>__{i don't want to nail you. i just want to know who put you up to it. i will give you a few days to think it over.}
<P>__{(hands him a card)}
<D>__{call me. i can help. who knows? maybe we can lay the whole thing off on a few big shots and you can stay head of the department for the next twenty years.}

<P>__{(he leans back; to evelyn)}
<D>__{tell me, did you get married before or after mulwray and your father sold the water department?}

<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{your father is julian cross, isn't he?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{yes, of course. it was quite a while after. i was just out of grade school when they did that.}

<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{not over me. why would they have a falling out over me?}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(noting her nervousness)}
<D>__{then it was over the water department.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{not exactly. well, i mean, yes. yes and no. hollis felt the public should own the water but i don't think my father felt that way. actually, it was over the van der lip. the dam that broke.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{oh, yeah?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{yes. he never forgave him for it.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{never forgave him for what?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{for talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... they haven't spoken to this day.}

<D>__{of course i'm sure.}

<D>__{what about you? do you and your father get along?}
<A>__{sophie comes in with the form, cutting off evelyn's reply. gittes places two copies on a coffee table in front of evelyn.}
