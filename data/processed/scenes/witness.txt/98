<A>__{it is later in the morning. rachel comes out onto the porch, tosses a pan of dirty dishwater off onto the grass, looks toward the barn.}

<A>__{eli and book standing in one of the open doorways, looking in.}

<A>__{angle favoring luke, one of eli's team of fine mules as samuel opens the stall gate. the beast is skittish, obviously afflicted with something of a behavioral problem. but he allows samuel to lead him out. book, eli as samuel brings luke out. eli is now harnessing the other mule of the team to a large manure spreader. but as luke nears book, his eyes widen and he shies, almost hauling samuel off his feet.}
<C>__{book}
<P>__{(alarmed)}
<D>__{careful, son}
<A>__{book moves to samuel's aid; a gesture which proves a serious mistake. luke erupts into a screaming, bucking cyclone. samuel who no doubt has been here before dives nimbly for cover as a flying hoof nearly takes book's head off. then eli hustles into the fray, pushing book aside as he bellows belligerently in german at the rearing animal. finally he gives luke a swat upside the head that seems, somehow, to have the effect of quieting the beast instantly.}

<D>__{you don't say.}
<A>__{eli leads the pacified mule back to the traces, grunting at book.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{have to teach you mules, too, i guess.}
