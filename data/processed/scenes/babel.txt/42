<L>__{interior yussef and ahmed's house evening}
<D>__{abdullah and his children sit at the small table while the women prepare the food. a column of smoke rises from the fire where they are roasting goat meat and toasting bread. yamil, the youngest of the daughters, sets some bread on the table. abdullah takes it, tears some off and starts to eat. he turns to yussef.}
<C>__{abdullah}
<D>__{did you kill any jackals?}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{we shot at them, but didn't hit them.}
<C>__{abdullah}
<D>__{you have to kill them. if not they're going to eat all the goats. yasira sets the strips of goat meat on the table. abdullah serves himself some. his children wait until he's done to serve themselves.}
<C>__{yasira}
<D>__{why are you home so late? abdullah starts talking with his mouth full.}
<C>__{abdullah}
<D>__{they closed the road, and we had to take the long way around.}
<P>__{(he swallows)}
<D>__{apparently some terrorists killed an american tourist. ahmed and yussef shoot each other a nervous glance.}
<C>__{yasira}
<D>__{an american?}
<C>__{abdullah}
<D>__{yes, the terrorists attacked a tour bus on the road.}
<C>__{yasira}
<D>__{but there aren't any terrorists here. abdullah finishes his mouthful. he wipes himself with his sleeve. ahmed doesn't even dare raise his eyes.}
<C>__{abdullah}
<D>__{you never know. yussef, nervous, looks up.}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{and how do you know the american died?}
<C>__{abdullah}
<D>__{that's what they were saying. the police are looking for the culprits. yussef and ahmed again exchange a furtive glance.}
