<L>__{interior ice room}
<A>__{as box enters followed by logan and jessica. this room has a fairly low ceiling and it is not too wide. it stretches back as far as the eye can see. the ice along the left wall is frosted...but the ice along the right wall is perfectly clear. and embedded in the ice along the perfectly clear right wall are: wide angle men and women standing in erect positions. at first it appears that they might be more of box's perfect works of sculpture. but as logan and jessica examine them closely through the clear ice...it is soon apparent that they are real people...who have been frozen.}
<B>__{close on logan and jessica}
<A>__{horrified as they move slowly along the wall. another angle including the men and women frozen}
<B>__{in the wall}
<A>__{we can see that each of them has a black crystal flower in the palm of their right hands. logan walks to the end of this wall. each frozen body has a number above it. the final body's number is 1056...that number which the voice in sandman's headquarters revealed as the number of missing runners. the camera pans logan back to box. another angle including box as logan turns toward him.}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(stupefied)}
<D>__{how did they get in here?}
<C>__{box}
<D>__{regular storage procedure...the same as the other food... the other food stopped coming and they started.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{what other food?}
<C>__{box}
<D>__{fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea.}
<P>__{(pointing to the frosted ice wall)}
<D>__{it's all here ready fresh as harvest day. fish and plankton, sea greens and protein from the sea...and then it stopped coming and they (gesture) came instead. so i store them here. i'm ready. and you're ready. it's my job protein, plankton, grass from the sea}
<A>__{logan pulls out his gun.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{tell us how to get out...or i1ll destroy you..i will kill you!}
<A>__{box laughs...the same loud, roaring laugh we heard earlier. then:}
<C>__{box}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{such a beautiful pair. i will stand you facing one another.}
<A>__{box starts his saw hand buzzing. he turns all the flesh parts of his body away from logan and starts advancing toward him and jessica who is now standing behind logan. box is now like an armed vehicle. logan fires...the fire reflecting harmlessly off box's metal frame.}
<C>__{box}
<P>__{(advancing)}
<D>__{resign yourself.}
<A>__{med. angle logan and jessica retreating...as logan fires again and again...to no avail. as logan and jessica retreat further and further toward the rear of this room and: reverse angle box advancing we can see person after person...embedded in the clear wall of ice. a strange mute audience to this to the death drama. two shot logan and jessica finally reaching the rear wall of this room as: reverse angle box relentlessly moving toward them. two shot logan and jessica seemingly pinned back against the rear wall. logan is firing his gun futilely with his right hand...while moving his empty hand against the rear wall...trying to find a knob or button which might open it. the entire time he never takes his eyes off: reverse angle box getting closer. the saw is buzzing loudly.}
<C>__{box}
<P>__{(chilling tone)}
<D>__{i make such a small, quick incision ... you can hardly feel it.}
<A>__{reverse angle logan and jessica against the rear wall...we can see...but they cannot...that above them...on the ceiling...there are a number of exposed cables. full angle logan, jessica and box box is practically upon them. as he lunges forward with his whirring saw hand logan pushes jessica to the floor and drops down alongside her. box cannot stop his forward thrust and cuts a sizable chunk of ice out of the rear wall as: logan shoots at box from the floor level...upwards ...trying to penetrate some part of his seemingly impregnable body. he misses but hits the exposed cables on the ceiling. there is an explosion.}
<C>__{box}
<P>__{(looking up; screaming)}
<D>__{no! the coils!}
<A>__{box rushes past logan and jessica toward the huge ice cavern containing his sculptures.}
<C>__{box}
<P>__{(still screaming)}
<D>__{all my work!' all my work!!}
<A>__{as logan and jessica stand:}
