<ACTION>__{Rain falls on the rear window of a taxi parked in the taxi zone of the Charles de Gualle Airport. Aside from the incessant tapping of rain on the roof of the cab  we hear the sounds of the airport:  the almost monotonic loudspeaker declaring in French that loitering is not permissible and that should any bags be left unattended that they will be destroyed; the honking of the horns from other automobiles; the unintelligible chatter of people as they get their bearings.  Inside the cab, playing on the radio, is Angelique Kidjo's funky song "Batonga". Then, the rear door to the cab opens and in an EXTREME CLOSE UP we see ZED, a young man with wild, almost mesmerizing eyes shielded by small round glasses, and with a head of nappy red hair.  His face has drops on it from the flurry outside. He settles himself, then looks to the CAB DRIVER, an easy going Senegalese/Frenchman, in the front seat.}

<DIAL>__{Slow enough for you?}
<ACTION>__{Then, like a cat prowling for it's prey, she crawls over the bed to him and begins to unbuckle his pants. She removes the pants and climbs on top of him.  They begin to make love. On the television, "Nosferatu" silently plays. Zoey and Zed quicken their pace with an urgency one can't resist during a moment of passion. She cries out and lowers herself to his grasp.  An IMAGE overcomes her mind. They quicken to an almost violent speed and then expire, both satisfied. She begins to kiss him multiple times over the face.}

<CHAR>__{ZED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No I don't.}
<CHAR>__{ZOEY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Usually never.  They're almost always fat like pigs.}
<ACTION>__{Zed laughs at this.}
<CHAR>__{ZOEY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And you make me feel safe.  That's something more important than the orgasm. An integral part maybe of the orgasm.}
<CHAR>__{ZED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I never really thought of it like that.}
<CHAR>__{ZOEY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, it's true.}

<CHAR>__{ZOEY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Not any of the old shit.}

<CHAR>__{ZED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What kind of things do you paint?}
<CHAR>__{ZOEY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't paint.  I make things.  Objects. Not like sculpture.  Like life...but with no narrative.  I want when someone looks at one of my objects for there to be no reference to the world.  Void of feeling, emotion...void of destiny.  Those are left for me.  They belong only to me.  If someone else can see into it...then it is no longer mine.  I have failed.  And I would destroy it.  I don't care how much cash they would offer me.  It would be shit.  I can't tell you how many objects of mine have been destroyed.  They told too much about me.  And if someone wants to know something about me...I'll tell them myself.  The way I'm telling you.}

<DIAL>__{Zoey.  I'm sorry for calling you a prostitute.  I didn't understand the difference.}
<CHAR>__{ZOEY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The difference is a prostitute would have lied to you about her orgasm.}
<ACTION>__{He gives her a kiss.}
<CHAR>__{ZED} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{If these things you make are as true as you are...I'm sure they're as indescribable.  Perhaps, someday, you'll make one...about me.}
<CHAR>__{ZOEY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{If I do...you'll never know which one it is.  Because I'll be the only one who understands.  I'll be the only one who can look into it and see where in my life it came from.}
