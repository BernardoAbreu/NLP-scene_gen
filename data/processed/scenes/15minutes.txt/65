<L>__{interior bellevue mental observation unit day}
<A>__{the camera widens from the tv set. we are now in an interview room, a guard is posted outside the room. emil sits at a small table with cutler. emil is dressed in bellevue clothes. he's handcuffed and his ankle is bandaged. emil gives a complimentary nod toward cutler.}
<C>__{cutler}
<D>__{i brought you some letters. it's really fan mail. women mostly. one wants to buy you clothes, another sent a check. another wants a check.}
<C>__{emil}
<D>__{you bring the cigarettes?}
<C>__{cutler}
<D>__{oh, sure.}
<A>__{cutler shakes a cigarette out of the pack, stuffs it in emil's mouth and lights it for him. emil has never smoked before.}
<C>__{cutler }
<D>__{how're they treating you, alright}
<P>__{(emil is nonresponsive)}
<D>__{i want to get the cuffs off... but there's a little bit of a problem. things out there are very negative right now for us. we gotta change that around. perception is very, very important. perception is reality. i know you're not fuckin' crazy. but it's important that i get that message out. cause that's our only defense in this case.}
<A>__{emil leans forward. cutler retrieves the cigarette from between his lips.}

<C>__{emil}
<D>__{what about my movie rights? book rights?}
<C>__{cutler}
<D>__{look, i haven't really focused on that kind of thing.}
