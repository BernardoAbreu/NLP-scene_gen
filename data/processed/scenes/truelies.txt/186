<L>__{exterior billboard and trailer park night}
<A>__{the agents have gathered behind a billboard. harry, gib and the other three agents have donned black jumpsuits. they finish fitting battle harnesses, then they grab black ski masks. they don them in perfect unison. commando precision. harry leads off and they quick time from behind the billboard, closing in on simon's trailer.}
<L>__{interior trailer night}
<A>__{helen looks up at simon and nods slowly.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{okay. i will do it.}
<A>__{simon shoots over and sits next to her, taking her hand.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{you are incredibly brave. i have to remind myself the fear you must be feeling. i've lived like this for years, so i'm used to it. every day when i get up, i think it might be my last. but it makes you appreciate life. and the moment. because that may be all you have.}
<A>__{he moves a little closer. casting his spell.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{to pull this cover story off, we have to look exactly like two people who are intimate with each other. the enemy can spot a fake easily.}
<A>__{he puts his hand on her knee. she tenses up instantly.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{you see what i mean? that reaction would give us away in a second. try to relax.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{it's just that... it's been sixteen years since anyone but harry did that, i }
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{relax. there, that's better. let yourself slip into the role.}
<A>__{he puts his other arm around her shoulders and pulls her slowly into a kiss. this doesn't seem real to helen. she finds herself not pulling away. he lowers her slowly until they are lying together on the bed.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{there you go. that's right...}
<A>__{he slides his hand up her thigh. the fingers, stroking in little circles, slips under her skirt. and she suddenly explodes, pushing on his chest, forcing him up off her.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{no! stop!}
<P>__{(he keeps kissing her)}
<D>__{get off me right now!}
<A>__{simon struggles with her. she gets one knee up under him and levers him up. she pushes him to a standing position. she sits up on the bed, straightening her skirt. he looks forlorn and pathetic. now he's going to try pleading...}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{if not for me, do it for democracy.}
