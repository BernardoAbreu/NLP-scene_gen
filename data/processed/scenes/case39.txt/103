<D>__{what is she of?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{stop acting like you don't know what i'm talking about.}

<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{you think your daughter is the devil?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{not him himself, of him, working in his name, in his honor.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{evil incarnate?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{i don't care what you call it.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{and why do you think that?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{not what i think it's what i know.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{how do you know this? could you give me an example?}
<A>__{margaret pauses. seeming afraid for the first time. some secrets perhaps best left untold.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{she can make you see things. visions.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{visions of what?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{hell. damnation. whatever you're afraid of.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{i see. any other `special abilities'?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{people die around her, is that a special ability?}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{she kills people?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{not by her hand, they just die. i had two brothers, brent and travis...}
<A>__{margaret's voice falters. overcome by grief, she dissolves into tears. it's a side of her we've never seen. human.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{...and i mean they was healthy boys, healthy as can be. eddie, three sisters. soon as she was born they started dying.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{you blame lucy for their deaths?}
<A>__{margaret nods yes, wiping her eyes. embarrassed. unaccustomed to crying in front of strangers.}
<C>__{interviewer}
<D>__{why do you imagine you were spared?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{i guess she couldn't get rid of us till she found somebody else. now that she has, i don't imagine we're long for this world.}
<A>__{close up on margaret face streaked with tears, her pain deep and undeniable.}
