<L>__{exterior saloon night}
<A>__{as mick and haven come out; the crowd makes a noisy clearing. there are bets going down. as soon as the crowd has formed an open space, haven wheels and smacks mick across the face hitting with the heel of the hand, so that mick rocks back almost going down. there is dead silence. mick sets himself for the kill, as he peels his coat. bristow is shaking with excitement.}
<C>__{bristow}
<D>__{mick will kill him.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{that's ten to one.}
<C>__{bristow}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{i don't like the other fellow's chances, but i'm a sucker for odds.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you should always bet on a champion. then you can only lose once.}
<C>__{bristow}
<D>__{you give ten to one...?}
<P>__{(she nods)}
<D>__{i will take it.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you're down. a thousand to a hundred.}
<A>__{as they stare at the fight full shot fight scene. as mick is slowly advancing toward haven. he suddenly swings a haymaker which haven easily ducks, another and another that haven evades.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{don't miss so much. you'll got tired.}
<A>__{mick misses again, fiercely and haven cracks him one in the midriff. then steps out fast and waits. mick charges and haven catches him full in the mouth. it stops mick, and then haven socks him again, this time with the butt of his hand open palm on the nose. mick is surprised, tasting the blood on his hurt lips. angle on charlie, mark and prince, as they watch. charlie's eyes are fixed with a kind of admiration on haven. prince watches without interest. mark is tense and excited.}
<C>__{bristow}
<D>__{he can fight a little.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{a little won't be enough.}
<A>__{but you feel she wishes it might... angle on the fight.}
<C>__{mick}
<D>__{stand still and fight.}
<A>__{as mick closes again, haven stops quickly to one side, clipping him behind the ear as he goes by. but this time mick keeps after haven and finally connects. it is more of a push than a clean hit, but even so the force of it drives haven off balance and he sprawls on his back. as mick, sensing victory, charges, haven knows he can't get to his feet in time, so he turns his body and springs at mick's knees shoulder first. the impact spills mick on his face; before he can recover, haven dives on him, hands flat on his own chest and palms turned out. his body crashes heavily, angling across mick's head, and haven's savagely pushing hands mash the other man's face into the hard ground. then he rolls clear and comes to his feet, breathing easily, waiting. mick gets up, shaking his head to clear it, mad and hurt. as he closes ponderously in on haven, his booted foot suddenly shoots out. haven twists his knee cap away but takes the blow on the inside of his thigh, numbing the leg so that he almost goes down. and now mick gets to him. his great arms close around haven's waist, his hands locked in the small of haven's back. haven braces himself against the crushing squeeze, tensing his back muscles and stiffening his spine, but there is nothing he can do against the implacable brute power of the other man. the sweat stands out on haven's face as mick's great strength bends him over farther and farther. he must do something, and soon, or his back will be cracked like a barrel stave. suddenly he bends his knees and lifts his feet up from off the ground. mick, suddenly finding haven's full weight pulling him forward, crashes down on top of him. with all the strength left in him, haven brings his knee to the pit of mick's stomach; as mick's hold breaks, haven rolls clear. now they are both hurt. haven's ribs and chest are so bruised that it is agony to take a breath. he knows it has to end quickly or he is done for, and he goes all out. as mick tries to close with him again, he stands his ground and throws pile driver punches to mick's midsection; as mick finally lowers his arms to cover his body, haven shifts his attack to the face. this is not mick's style of fighting, but as he lashes back clumsily and angrily, each time he touches haven it is with punishing power. toe to toe, they slug it out, the belt now unwound and dangling from mick's fist, both men groggy but both refusing to go down. finally mick is helpless to protect himself, but haven hasn't got power left to knock him off those sturdy legs. gathering himself, haven hurls his body shoulder first at mick's chest but he miscalculates, glances off and falls flat on his face. as he rolls over, dogged and slow with exhaustion, he sees that his weight has staggered mick; the big man has taken a step back, and now he starts to walk forward. dazed and blind with pain, he passes haven, staggers forward until the tie rail stops him. there he stands, his hands on the rail, moving his head from side to side like a wounded animal. the crowd is silent now, waiting. haven gets to his feet, drunk with weariness. he puts a hand on mick's shoulder, but hasn't the strength to whirl him around. he braces himself with one hand against the tie rail, and almost in slow motion pulls mick around and clips him one last time with his remaining strength. mick goes down.}
<C>__{mick}
<P>__{(getting up very slow)}
<D>__{you can't do this.}
<A>__{before he is up he goes down again, unable to make it.}
<C>__{mick}
<P>__{(in the dirt)}
<D>__{nobody can do this... to me.}
<A>__{the crowd is transfixed. they can't even cheer. the two bouncers lean over the fallen mick.}
<C>__{bouncer}
<D>__{somebody just did.}
<A>__{they pick up mick as haven stupidly watches. then as haven turns and goes away, swaying and weak, the roar rises. he pushes aside people who try to assist him. they move aside and watch him leave. the crowd goes back in the saloon behind the vanquished mick... angle on charlie, bristow and prince. prince watches the beaten mick go by with a smile of contempt. charlie's eyes are fixed on the vanishing lonely figure of haven. mark's eyes are dancing.}
<C>__{bristow}
<D>__{i can't believe it. mick marion losing a fight and me winning a thousand!}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(to prince)}
<D>__{give it to him, prince in chips.}
<A>__{bristow follows prince, wiping his forehead. charlie remains, looking down the now empty street where haven vanished, a strange soft look in her eyes, a slow smile mounting her lips.}
