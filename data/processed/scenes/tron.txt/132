<A>__{it looms high overhead.}
<B>__{tron and yori}
<A>__{on a long curving walkway which encircles the base of the tower, approaching a wide door in the wall. inside this door' we see that it opens onto a wide elevator platform, which is now rising upwards at a steep angle, carrying tron and yori smoothly and silently towards an opening in a floor a hundred feet overhead.}
<B>__{shot from below them}
<A>__{looking upwards as they move.}
<B>__{the upper floor}
<A>__{as the elevator platform arrives, and they step off. we get the sense of massive, over size ceilings, floors, windows and machinery, dwarfing the programs who come to the tower to communicate, preparing them for the experience, as a vaulting cathedral prepared the sinner for confession. but here, everything is composed of clean, sharp, angular surfaces. on this second story there is floor and ceiling, but no outer wall, so we can still see the city grid below and beyond. tron and yori cautiously move forward across the floor, heading for a door into the inner parts of the tower.}
<B>__{the central chamber}
<A>__{of the i 0 tower. a large, raised circular altar stands against one wall, with a darkened opening behind it. a square, secondary altar supports the first, about fifty feet up a side. in the middle of the altar we see a structure of stacked, diminishing steps, the final one forming the shoulders of an armless, padded suit with a puffed headdress revealing the face of the i 0 tower priest, dumont. his eyes are shut. his face is lined with age, but still holds a sprightly sensitivity. it is the face of dr. gibbs, from the laser lab in the real world. there is a large, v shaped opening behind the altar, and the circular steps glow a hot neon, each a different color. the stripes of color thus formed bleed upwards onto the wall, lining either side of the v opening. there is only blackness beyond. dumont's face asleep.}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{tron and yori walk toward him from an entranceway across the wide room, their footsteps echoing. central chamber tron, yori, dumont tron and yori stop at the foot of dumont's altar.}
<C>__{yori}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{dumont... ?}
<A>__{the priest's eyes flicker open. he looks at tron and yori, doesn't recognize either one.}
<C>__{dumont}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{tron}
<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{i... have come to communicate with my user.}
<C>__{dumont}
<D>__{hmm. a difficult proposition... difficult proposition at best.}
<P>__{(indicates empty chamber)}
<D>__{perhaps you've noticed... we're not exactly packing them in these days ...}
<C>__{yori}
<D>__{yes...what ?}
<C>__{dumont}
<D>__{you know, not so long ago, you could've come in here and seen programs lined up all the way back to those doors, waiting for communion with their users. the building fund was doing well too...but now...}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{...this so called master control program is going around cutting programs off from their natural creators, grabbing all our believers and making them ride around on little motor scooters and shoot things at each other and weiner knows what all oh, it's enough to give you a crisis of faith...}
<C>__{tron}
<D>__{well i want to communicate }
<C>__{dumont}
<D>__{oh, you want to hah. i could get myself de rezzed just for letting you in here. they hate this tower. they'd close it down if they dared to but they keep me around, in case one of them wants to deal with the other world once in a while. and you should hear the way they commune! sounds like they were routing a payroll, for all the heart they put in it. no, i don't think you}
<A>__{tron steps closer, speaks quietly to dumont.}
<C>__{tron}
<D>__{dumont... my user has information that could could make this a free system again.}
<C>__{dumont}
<D>__{hah.}
<C>__{tron}
<D>__{really. you'd have programs lined up around the block to use this place and no mcp looking over your shoulder.}
<C>__{dumont}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{when you've been in the system as long as i have, you hear many promises... many reassurances...many brave plans...}
<A>__{he pauses, sizing tron up, considering it. finally:}
<C>__{dumont }
<P>__{(falling into ritual)}
<D>__{who is your user, program?}
<C>__{tron}
<D>__{alan one. he calls me... may i pass?}
<C>__{dumont}
<D>__{all that is visible must grow beyond itself and extend into the realm of the invisible.}
<A>__{dumont nods, and the neon glow fades a little.}
<C>__{dumont}
<D>__{you may pass, my friend.}
<A>__{tron runs lightly up the steps, past dumont, into the darkness beyond.}
