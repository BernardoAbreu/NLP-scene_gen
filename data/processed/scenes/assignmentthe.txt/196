<L>__{interior carlos' bedroom mansion on carlos' bed}
<A>__{the voluptuous blonde her body glazed with post coitus sweat is paralyzed with fear; covering her prized assets seems the last thing on her mind. she gapes at the kgb marauders with wide, blue eyes. not so, ramirez's look alike. caught reaching from under the sheets to replace the tape in the stereo by the bed, he instinctively tries for his gun.}
<B>__{on head kgb officer}
<A>__{standing at the door. his automatic no longer has a silencer.}
<C>__{head kgb officer}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{don't even think about it. it would deprive the kgb of the pleasure of interrogating you.}
<B>__{on carlos}
<A>__{surprisingly, he seems quite relieved.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{kgb? i thought...}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{head kgb officer}
<D>__{what? that we were your new friends... the cia... jack shaw...}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{jack shaw...?}
<C>__{head kgb officer}
<D>__{stop playing games. and it's no use looking behind me... your associates can no longer be of assistance. not to you, not to anyone...}
<C>__{carlos}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{comrade, you'd getter have an explanation }
<C>__{head kgb officer}
<D>__{you've got it all wrong, illich. it's you who has all the explaining to do... now get dressed!}
<P>__{(to the blonde)}
<D>__{you too, fraulein.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{my pants...}
<A>__{the head kgb officer motions to andrei, who throws carlos his pants but not before checking to make sure there's no weapon in them. he then hands the blonde who finally hides her bazooms behind a sheet her clothes.}
<C>__{carlos}
<P>__{(continuing; getting dressed)}
<D>__{that's what was going on in libya. the cia... the dst... they're trying to set me up and you're falling for it, you idiot!}
<C>__{head kgb officer}
<D>__{enough. we tailed you to your meeting. we have the pictures of you with shaw.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{that's impossible. i've been here all night.}
<P>__{(points to the blonde)}
<D>__{ask her.}
<P>__{(to the blonde)}
<D>__{tell him.}
<B>__{on blonde}
<A>__{she's putting stockings on a pair of legs that could distract even the most committed kgb.}
<C>__{blonde}
<P>__{(in a voice matching her looks)}
<D>__{it's true. all night...}
<C>__{head kgb officer}
<P>__{(unimpressed)}
<D>__{we know about your women... now hurry up, both of you!}
<B>__{on ivan and vladimir}
<A>__{with kalashnikovs still trained on carlos, they seem unable to resist stealing glances at the blonde.}
<C>__{carlos}
<P>__{(to head kgb officer)}
<D>__{i will prove it to you. you'll be pleading for my forgiveness. let's just go. i want to be interrogated. i demand to be interrogated.}
<A>__{he seems truly eager to leave with them now, as if confident he can prove his case. dressed, with the exception of a jacket, he casually grabs one which lies on a nearby chair.}
<C>__{head kgb officer}
<D>__{wait!}
<A>__{too late. the scorpion machine pistol is already out, spouting deadly accurate fire. he kills the head kgb officer first, then...}
<B>__{on kgb}
<A>__{they drop like flies, their bullets hitting everything but him.}
<B>__{on blonde}
<A>__{hysterical, she screams her healthy lungs out.}
