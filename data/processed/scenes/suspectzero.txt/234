<D>__{i'm talking about uncompromised justice. no trials. no lawyers. no hiccups in a chain of evidence that can set a monster free. you of all people should be able to appreciate the value of that.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{where's the boy?}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{i won't be doing this much longer. actually, this is the end of it. i've}

<P>__{(anger rising)}
<D>__{where's the boy, o'ryan?}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{do we have an understanding?}
<A>__{mackelway pulls the car over, under an i 30 overpass... and out comes his gun, pointed right at o'ryan's forehead.}
<C>__{mackelway }
<D>__{enough of this shit. where's the boy?}
<A>__{o'ryan can't help it. he's pleased.}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{good. this is good. sort of thing you'd never find in a procedural manual. it tells me i was right about you.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<P>__{(cocking the hammer)}
<D>__{i will kill you, o'ryan.}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{i know. but we have work to do first.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{where's the goddamn kid?!?!}
<A>__{silence... then that cel phone rings. must be fran.}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{don't pick that up.}
<A>__{mackelway eyes him: are you kidding? it rings again.}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<P>__{(a panicked offer)}
<D>__{this is the guy who put all those pins in that map of yours! and i can take you to him!}
<A>__{ring #3. mackelway grabs the phone.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{fine. where is he?}
<P>__{(silence)}
<D>__{where is he?!?!}
<A>__{silence, punctuated by ring #4. then o'ryan smiles... and points to his own forehead.}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{right here...}
<A>__{mackelway lets out a disgusted sigh.}
<C>__{mackelway}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<A>__{he punches the "talk" button, taking his eyes off o'ryan for a split second. ...what follows is a blur: o'ryan lunges forward like an animal, throwing his cuffed wrists over mackelway's head, yanking mackelway out of his seat with a violent tug. the gun falls. we pop outside the yukon, pulling back... obscuring our view of what's going on inside that truck. that cel phone continues to ring... we keep pulling back, under this sparsely trafficked overpass, rain falling. the cel phone stops ringing. continue pulling back, taking in the expanse of highway cars rolling by without a hint of the peril beneath them...}
