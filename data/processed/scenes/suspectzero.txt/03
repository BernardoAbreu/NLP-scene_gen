<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{...a spoon, stirring a cup of coffee.}
<L>__{interior "the all american diner" gainesville texas continuing}
<A>__{(4:30 a.m.) harold speck sits: mid 40's, pleasant face. a family man. reads "rod and reel" magazine. has a salesman's case by his side. around him is a truck stop in twilight: truckers at the counter, elvis on the wall, a "drink bud!" mirror. the world series can be heard on a radio...}
<C>__{dolly }
<D>__{top that off for ya, hon?}
<A>__{that's dolly, a waitress, (50, been here too long.) speck looks up, smiles thinly, "no." dolly heads off. speck returns to his article, underlining a particular passage. ...until a man seats himself, suddenly, in the seat opposite speck's. speck reacts, startled.}
<C>__{speck}
<D>__{jesus...}
<A>__{the man's name is o'ryan. we only see pieces of him: his eyes, his hands, a stain on his parka...}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{what's in the case?}
<C>__{speck}
<D>__{i'm sorry?}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{you're always lugging that case around. i'm curious.}
<A>__{speck looks around: there are plenty of empty tables in here. so why is this guy bothering me???}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{what do you sell?}
<C>__{speck}
<D>__{i'm... in restaurant supplies. i didn't get your name?}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{must travel a lot, huh?}
<A>__{speck is looking for dolly, a manager, anyone...}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{whole country, or just hereabouts?}
<C>__{speck}
<D>__{i don't mean to be rude but }
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{how's your wife feel about it?}
<A>__{that spun things a bit. speck pauses.}
<C>__{speck}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{she must get lonely, with you gone all the time. does she?}
<C>__{speck}
<D>__{look, i...}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{do you get lonely?}
<A>__{speck's so thrown now he can't answer.}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{ya miss fucking her, harold?}
<C>__{speck}
<D>__{listen, i don't know who you are but you can't }
<A>__{o'ryan silences him... by holding up a piece of paper. on it is a drawing. the image faces away from us. but speck can see it in rich detail. and his eyes go wide. we catch glimpses: the color of flesh. a body part. looks like a rendering of a young, naked woman. and, just like that, speck finds himself staring. glued.}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{did it myself. it's sort of a hobby.}
<P>__{(no reply)}
<D>__{i've got more. would you like to see them?}
<A>__{o'ryan lowers it and slides a second drawing over... speck is speechless, transfixed. can't look away.}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{tell me: those jokes about the traveling salesman and the farmer's daughter are they true?}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<P>__{(speck remains silent)}
<D>__{here. this one's my favorite.}
<A>__{o'ryan slides over drawing #3. again, we don't get to see it. and we still haven't seen all of o'ryan's face. but we can see speck, and his reaction. utter horror. in fact he recoils so violently that his coffee spills.}
<C>__{o'ryan }
<D>__{really says it all, wouldn't you agree?}
<C>__{speck}
<D>__{you're a... you're sick.}
<C>__{o'ryan}
<D>__{that's a matter of opinion.}
<C>__{speck}
<D>__{you're sick!}
<A>__{he rises, leaving the drawings behind. we stay with him as he crosses the diner deeply unsettled. he reaches the manager, (mel, balding, 50, in no mood) at the register.}
<C>__{mel}
<D>__{mmm hmm?}
<C>__{speck}
<D>__{i'm having a problem with another customer. i'd like you to ask him to leave, please.}
<C>__{mel}
<D>__{what kind of problem?}
<C>__{speck}
<D>__{he's }
<A>__{he turns, to point out o'ryan. ...but the booth, suddenly, is empty. the guy has simply disappeared, taking those drawings with him. speck tightens. mel eyes him, annoyed.}
