<L>__{exterior waterfront night}
<A>__{loud, crowded riverfront taverns full of ruffians. louis staggers down, an arm around a whore, drinking from a bottle. a pockmarked pimp follows behind.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{my invitation was open to anyone. sailors, thieves, whores and slaves...}
<L>__{exterior wharf night}
<A>__{louis, quite insensible, being propped up against a wall by the whore in a dank wharf over the water. the pimp rifles his pockets, then pulls a knife, about to slice his throat, when a shadow falls over him. he turns, and we see the face of lestat, who lifts him into the air by his throat, breaking his neck. the whore screams and lestat's other hand clamps over her mouth. lestat drags her towards him. louis falls to the ground, supported no more, insensible. close on his face, as we hear the last breaths of life of the whore, off.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{but it was a vampire that accepted.}
<B>__{in the water}
<A>__{the bodies of the thief and whore float by. above on the wharf, louis, now awake, stares down at them. he turns, to see lestat, towering above him.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{they would have killed you }
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{then my luck would have changed.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you want death? is it death you want?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{yes...}
<A>__{lestat floats down on top of him, then lifts him in the air, draws his head back by the hair and sinks his teeth in his neck. on louis' face every muscle rigid, teeth clenched, as the blood is drained from him.}
<B>__{on their feet}
<A>__{hovering above the ground, like two quivering dancers. the wind billows through the ghostly white sails and rigging of the boats around the wharf.}
<B>__{lestat}
<A>__{floats higher, with louis in his arms, draining his blood. one hand reaches out and grips a rope, hanging from a shipmast. the other holds louis. he withdraws his teeth, and looks into louis' drained face.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you still want death? or have you tasted it enough?}
<A>__{louis can barely get the words out.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{enough...}
<A>__{lestat smiles and lets him go. louis falls and plummets into the water below. louis' face coming to the surface, in the water lapping by the wharf. the bodies of the whore and thief float beside him. he looks up and sees lestat way above him, dangling from the rope of the shipmast.}
