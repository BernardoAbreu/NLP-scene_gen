<T>__{time cut to:}
<A>__{control room later jones sits near the vent sound asleep, his weapon across his stomach. near him willie lies still, eyes open. she watches beck across the room, standing at the window. he stares outside into the darkness for a moment, then as if a thought suddenly occurs to him he looks at the blank computer screen.}
<B>__{close on computer screen}
<A>__{"request weather summaries january 14 21." the cursor blinks back ominously then races across the screen. "file closed."}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{martin, you asshole...}
<A>__{suddenly he hears a voice behind him.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{they know, don't they?}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{yeah...i think they're just deciding what to do with us.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{maybe they already have.}
<A>__{she moves into doc's seat in front of the console and calls up the stock market program that bowman was monitoring earlier. on screen we see: stock prices. willie types in a series of commands.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{seeing how my stock's doing...}
<A>__{on screen: the words transocean corp. the capsulized report comes up on screen: "transocean corp. took a bath on world markets today when news of a tragic mining accident was revealed to investors. the board of directors...."}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(impatiently)}
<D>__{where?....}
<A>__{she scrolls forward in the report and suddenly freezes the words. the screen: "...accident took place in shack six, southeast sector of pacific zone 10...seven dead. all bodies missing." their names follow. on willie as her name comes up she shivers.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{i can't believe they'd just leave us.}
<A>__{a voice behind them causes them to turn.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{welcome to the union, boss. we're all expendable.}
<A>__{he is now awake. he sits up against the air vent. suddenly, beck listens, the room is deathly silent. he looks over to the air vent. jones is listening also.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{the air's stopped.}
<A>__{whoop! whoop! suddenly a klaxon horn sounds hysterically. a blue light on the console blinks on and off. it says "air." beck turns to the instruments.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{we're on backup air.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{how much time does that give us?}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{less than an hour. it's ruptured an air duct.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{can't we fix it?}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{there're twenty miles of pipe in the bilge, they could have tapped in anywhere.}
<A>__{suddenly we hear a sound we haven't heard in a long time. the rattle that jones and cobb fixed. jones and beck home in on the tell tale noise.}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(almost to himself)}
<D>__{cobb...job security...}
<A>__{he locks eyes with beck.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{they're drawing us out.}
<A>__{he leaves his seat and jones checks his weapon as willie watches.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{you can't go out there, that's what they want.}
<A>__{beck checks his make shift flamethrower.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{we don't have much choice... without air, the internal pressure will fall and }
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{crunch...implosion.}
<A>__{willie watches them a moment then picks up one of the mining tools, the laser drill, she powers it up to check it. her action stops both men and she catches their looks.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{you don't think i'm sitting in here, do you?}
