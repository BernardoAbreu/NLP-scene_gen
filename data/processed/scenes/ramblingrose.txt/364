<P>__{(eyes down)}
<D>__{what's the use, there ain't none.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{mmm. would you get me another half a cup of coffee, dear?}
<A>__{rose rises and he watches her leave, then turns to mother.}
<C>__{daddy }
<D>__{it has been three weeks since i "fired" her. is there no way to get rid of this girl? are we stuck with her for life?}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{she can't get a job, it's a depression. and we can't just throw her out on the street.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{the hell we can't.}
<A>__{rose returns with coffee and pours it out for daddy.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{rose, you don't look well and you haven't eaten a bit of breakfast.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i'm not hungry. i can't eat nothin', i haven't been able to eat since i got fired. i think maybe i'm sick.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{god forbid. you're not sick, rose, forget it. don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{yes, sir.}

<D>__{she does look a little peaky.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{no, she doesn't, she's fine, fine. she's perfectly healthy, don't give her ideas.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{well, i will do the dishes, then i'm goin' to lie down a minute and rest. my stomach hurts.}
<A>__{daddy watches rose exit to the kitchen, then leans forward and speaks to mother, his expression a bit sly.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{her plan is obvious, plain as day. she's going on a hunger strike. the question is, how do we foil her?}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{she's just nervous and worried. and you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(thinking hard)}
<D>__{something has got to be done or rose is going to be in this house forever.}
