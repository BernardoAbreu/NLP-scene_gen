<L>__{exterior verizon mall hill continuous}
<A>__{and with that, ryan cranks the steering wheel hard right and hits the gas! despite other drivers' protests, the little rent a cop vehicle blasts across the gridlock, tears through the rusty guard rail and vroooom! flies off the side of the hill! ryan lets out a frightened yell as he sails through the clear blue sky.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{hoooollyyy shiiii }
<A>__{thump! the rent a cop car touches down on a steep downslope. ryan struggles to control the bucking automobile, miraculously avoiding the minefield of rocks and tree stumps. he needs both hands for the job and holds the phone by its antenna in his teeth. there's so much noise, the only thing jessica could possibly hear is a cacophony of noise and ryan hyperventilating.}
<C>__{jessica }
<D>__{what's going on?!}
<C>__{ryan}
<P>__{(with phone in teeth)}
<D>__{mmmrrmph mrm mrmph!}
<A>__{ryan is bounced around like a corn kernel in a popper until the car hits a jutting rock and whoooom! goes up on two wheels. it looks like it's going to roll but gravity brings it back down slamm! so hard that the phone goes flying across the car!}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{ryan scrabbles for the phone but gives it up when he bounces over a rise and sees a billboard dead ahead!}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{whoaaaaaa!}
<A>__{ryan whips the wheel and navigates the little car between the billboard's concrete posts, but wham! obliterates the rent a cop's bubble lights on the billboard's lower edge. somehow, ryan muscles the bucking econocar safely down the rest of the hill and into the strip mall parking lot, where it skids out.}
<C>__{ryan }
<P>__{(grabbing phone)}
<D>__{jessica?! can you hear me?!}
<C>__{jessica }
<D>__{i'm here!}
<A>__{ryan hops out and races inside the verizon wireless store continuous and of course, they're having a sale and the place is packed. every salesperson is beyond busy in the feeding frenzy. sfx: beep beep beep!! panicking, ryan pushes his way to the front of the counter }
<C>__{irate customers}
<D>__{hey, what do you think you're doing? there's a line!}
<A>__{ to the overly perky salesman helping someone else.}
<D>__{overly perky salesman ..and if you get the new nokia 9200, you can switch out faceplates to match your mood! and we have a special today on tiger stripes... are you feeling fierce?}
<A>__{the salesman makes a playful paw swipe with his hand.}
<D>__{easily excitable customer oh, how fun!}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{excuse me overly perky salesman i'm sorry, sir, i'm with a customer now.}
<P>__{overly perky salesman (cont'd) (indicates a number dispenser)}
<D>__{but if you take a number, someone will be with you shortly.}
<A>__{ryan glances at the dispenser. a big yellow smiley face with tickets ejected from the mouth. the next ticket it offers is "#97"...and the now serving display on the wall reads "#71". sfx: beep beep beep!i just then, a busy saleswoman walks by. ryan grabs her.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{hey! hey! i've got an emergency here }
<C>__{busy saleswoman}
<D>__{sorry, i'm on break }
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{damn it, will you listen to me?! i've got a life and death call on this phone and my battery's dying! do you have a charger?}
<C>__{busy salesman}
<D>__{sure.}
<P>__{(walks away)}
<D>__{take a number and one of the sales associates will grab you one when your turn comes up.}
<A>__{ }
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{bu t !}
<A>__{sfx: beep beep beep beep!!! ryan breaks out in a cold sweat. can't catch his breath. as a saleswoman rushes by, ryan reaches for her.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{help, i }
<C>__{saleswoman}
<D>__{take a number.}
<A>__{the room starts spinning around him. it's clear no one's going to help him. like the clap of doom, the now serving display on the wall flips happily to "#72" sfx: beep beep beep beep!!! frantic, ryan glances at the phone. and just as the last battery bar on the power indicator flickers and disappears }
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{aw, screw this...}
<A>__{ ryan pulls the rent a cop's big .38 special from his pocket and blows the smiley face dispenser to dust! instantly, people hit the dirt.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{oh look! now serving thirty eight special!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now who's gonna get me that goddamn charger?}
