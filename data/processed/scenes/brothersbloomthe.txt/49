<L>__{exterior tiergarten early morning}
<A>__{berlin's central park and zoo, dead and brown. the brothers stroll through the woods, stephen a few steps ahead, bloom trailing behind, lost in thought. camel heads poke over a wall with `kamelhaus' painted on it. stephen throws open the wall's gate.}
<C>__{stephen}
<P>__{(to camels)}
<D>__{back to the swamps!}
<A>__{the camels are unimpressed. bloom slouches into a bench. stephen shows the deck of cards to bloom, who nods. stephen cuts the deck, shows him a card. bloom shakes his head, no.}
<C>__{stephen }
<D>__{at least you're honest.}
<A>__{bloom stares into space.}
<C>__{stephen }
<D>__{alright, let's do this. let's just get it done. so first you say `i'm quitting, stephen. i'm out.' then i say...}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{`do we have to go through this again.'}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{then you make a show of putting on your jacket and say `no i mean it this time stephen, this time i'm really out.'}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{then you say `let's have a drink, and in the morning bloom you'll have come to your senses'}
<A>__{stephen pulls a flask, unscrews it.}
<C>__{stephen}
<P>__{(re: bloom's bright red blood stain)}
<D>__{that's a major design flaw in fake blood, by the way.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{`and we'll be moving on.'}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{real blood turns brown after a half hour.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{listen to me, stephen.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{this scotch costs more than your suit. 26 11 06.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{listen to me.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{and the flask stopped a bullet from a black powder rifle at appomattox.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{listen.}
<A>__{bloom bats the flask away. a camel catches it, tips its camel neck back and gulps it down.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{that's my new favorite camel.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{i hate you. i hate this life, i hate it, i hate that you won't fucking listen to me for one goddamn second. just listen.}
<A>__{stephen listens.}
<C>__{bloom }
<D>__{i can't wake up next to another stranger, who thinks they know me, or even wants to know me, cause i don't know who i'm thirty five years old, and i, i'm useless, i'm crippled, i don't, i've only ever lived life through these roles that aren't me, that are written for me by you.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{tell me what you want.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{why? so you can write me a role in a story where i get it? you're not listening to me. i want a real... thing, i wanna do things how i don't know are gonna work out, a, i, want, a...}
<C>__{stephen}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{you want an unwritten life.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{i want an unwritten life!}
<P>__{(realizes stephen just wrote that line for him)}
<D>__{aauuugghh god!}
<A>__{the camel belches. bloom makes a show of putting on his jacket.}
<C>__{bloom }
<D>__{i'm going away. somewhere you or even the chink won't be able to track me down, so don't try. no more stories.}
<A>__{bloom tosses stephen the bowler, and storms off. he gets about ten feet, then hesitates.}
<C>__{bloom }
<D>__{i love you. bye.}
<A>__{then goes. the camel nudges stephen's jacket, looking for more scotch. stephen puts the bowler on its camel head.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{sorry bud. i'm dry.}
<A>__{stephen watches his brother walk off into the rising morning mist, lost in thought. his hands mechanically begin shuffling the pack of cards.}
