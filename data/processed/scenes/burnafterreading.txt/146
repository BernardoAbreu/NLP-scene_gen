<A>__{linda flings open the door to her car parked on the street bordering the mall. she gets in and turns the ignition. pulling into traffic she checks her rear view, and her look snags on: a dark four door sedan pulling out a few cars back. it falls in behind her. its driver is a man in sunglasses. he reaches up and touches fingertips to one ear. linda frowns. she looks forward, glances again at the mirror. another dark car pulls into the lane next to the first. its driver is also a man in sunglasses.}
