<L>__{exterior street corner day}
<A>__{in a news pot, further down the street from where he was first seen, the old, blind man sits with his dead dog, speaking as if into camera, sipping on a dr. pepper.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{it's the desert that makes you crazy. the loneliness out here. nobody to talk to. people on the run. trailer parks. white trash. i seen some peculiar things on a hot day. i seen a scorpion sting itself to death. it just keeps driving its tail into its body again and again. a little killer killing itself. seen a coyote kill itself too. just kept on biting and tearing at its own legs. near tore one clean off before it bled to death. and what a white man'll do when it's freezing one moment, hot as hell the nexterior a man could get hisself killed just for rubbing shoulders with another (smacking his lips) kiss kissy kiss. nice pussy y'see, see it coming. i don't know what it is about the desert. i figger it's sort of like putting a kettle of water over a fire. people is mostly water. we boil when it's hot. 'cept when we boil the water's got no place to go. it just churns inside of us until we can cool off. if it's not too late.}
<A>__{bobby is now revealed standing next to the blind man, and we realize the blind man has been talking to him all along. bobby sips a dr. pepper as well.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you sure seen a lot for a blind man.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{just 'cause i ain't got eyes doesn't mean i can't see.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{that a fact?}
<A>__{bobby noticing now all the little newspaper clippings that the blind man keeps around him in a sort of inchoate stall.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{i can see just fine. for example: you're a young man who thinks he's got someplace to be.}
<A>__{a police radio crackles, bobby tensing.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{maybe i do.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{or maybe you just think you do. just another small town. one guy chasing you. you go big town. just gonna have four guys after you instead. kiss kissy kiss. it gets down to one thing are you a human being or are you one of those hungry ghosts out there never satisfied with nothing? cause you gotta remember you can run just as far as you can, but wherever you go, that's where you gonna be.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i think i've heard that before.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{what do you want for free?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you sure got a lot of philosophy, old man.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{seems like i do but only cause end of the day we're all eyes in the same head. and everything is everything.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{...and everything is nothing too.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{maybe one day i will get to sit on a corner and spout wise.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{think you'll live that long?}
<A>__{bobby is clearly unnerved by this. suddenly the blind man stands, pissed and powerful, sniffing the air with the police radio in it. as sheriff potter cruises by, glancing at bobby shrinking. the car goes on up the street.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{cocksucker motherfucker! cops. i hear you. always sneaking around. thinks i can't see him. well he's right. motherfucker. but that ain't mean i don't know what's going on around here. they're all cursed. yes sir.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{who's cursed?}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{all them miners last century. hungry ghosts, killed off all the indians. up at the mine. earth ran red with blood, think i'm fooling around here. white sky was on fire. grown men cried like babies. i saw a flash, then darkness descended upon me. they put me in the jointerior took my eyes. i cursed them. white people can't seem to stay away from indians (grabs his bandaged hand, smelling the blood). you gotta watch where ya put your fingers. pussy pussy pussy, indian pussy.}
<A>__{it sounds demented. bobby, checking him out to see if he's really blind, walks quietly around him during this monologue and peeks over his glasses trying to see the blind man's real eyes. although he thinks the blind man thinks he's on the other side of him, the blind man fools him by suddenly swivelling around and cranking a gob of spit into bobby's face as if bobby were on the other side. bobby, pissed, wipes the spittle from his face.}
<C>__{blind man }
<D>__{...but they gotta know you don't fuck around with indians.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i thought you said you lost your eyes in the war?}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{so now you're going to tell me where i lost my eyes. you don't think i know where i lost my eyes? i was there when i lost them. i lost them in the war. the war in the jointerior there's always wars in the jointerior cause i was a code talker in the joint and in the war too.(sniffs) mmmm, nothing like the smell of a naked lady. be careful, boy.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{musta been some bad ass nuclear tests here in the 50's. this town's all inbreeding.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{well, people gotta get by somehow. that's the curse. the mines done it. all that uranium, plutonium, fuffonium, fuckononium, assononium, all that "om"! everybody's got a mother. you don't rip up your mother. you don't rip up the earth and take everything out. it's like the cracker jack box says, "the more you eat, the more you want...."...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i got things to do.}
<C>__{blind man }
<D>__{oh well, go do 'em. you don't see me stopping you...}
<A>__{bobby starts to walk away. the blind man rattles his tin cup.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{...but ain't you got a little something for the infirm?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i'm a little short pops. i will catch you next time.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{your lies are old, but you tell 'em well.}
