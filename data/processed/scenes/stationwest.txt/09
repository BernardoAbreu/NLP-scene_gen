<A>__{the board sidewalk has given way to a rutty dirt road. now the racket of the saloon street is just a ghost of noise, the road dark and silent. haven has emerged from the saloon. he glances up the street. fifty yards ahead, stellman is walking slowly. stellman pauses, shoots a quick glance backwards, then goes on. haven follows, going leisurely up the street after stellman. angle on a corner as stellman turns it, pauses and waits. when haven reaches it, stellman goes on in silence.}
