<A>__{the passenger side agent sees bourne, points bourne cuts to the south side of the road so the passenger side agent doesn't have a shot, while controlling the car makes it almost impossible for the driver to fire accurately.}
<L>__{exterior 41 street day}
<A>__{the westbound car cuts sharply and drives up on the sidewalk. but bourne is too fast. he's already past them. the passenger side agent jumps out. but he's still got to get around the door and then move a few steps to get a bead over the hood of his car on bourne. the other cri car races the wrong way on the street but gets immobilized and trapped by the onrushing tunnel traffic.}
