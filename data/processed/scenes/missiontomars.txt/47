<L>__{interior eva airlock. day. a bunch of m&ms}
<A>__{are floating in mid air, forming an intricate 3d pattern. in the eva airlock, it's zero g. phil, strapped into a chair by a galley counter, is just completing this weightless puzzle by placing a final blue m&m. he looks bored, sluggish. in the b.g., terri is hunched over a microscope. mcconnell emerges from the core tunnel, behind them, coming up from the lower hab, then pushes off from the ladder, floating towards phil. he grins, admiring phil's obsessive handiwork.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{that... is the exact chemical composition of my ideal woman.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{used to be.}
<A>__{he plucks out a couple of the m&ms as he drifts by.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{mcconnell grins, snacking on the m&ms.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{now what is it?}
<A>__{phil looks sadly at his floating model.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{a frog.}
<A>__{mcconnell and terri laugh as phil starts scarfing down the rest of the m&ms. swooping at them with both hands.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{i guess now we have our answer to the effects of long term interplanetary travel on the human mind. the answer is phil.}

<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i'm gonna get an update on sima. it should be just about close enough to start capturing some surface images.}
<A>__{he's drifted to another short ladder, and now grabs it, starts up to the cockpit, atop the hab.}
