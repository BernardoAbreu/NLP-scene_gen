<L>__{interior tommy's house night}
<A>__{tommy and celia are watching the press conference on tv.}
<C>__{celia}
<D>__{well, congratulations. you've found yourself your own hopeless cause.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{speaking of hopeless causes...}
<A>__{they kiss, and slide out of frame.}
<A>__{& &}
<L>__{114 interior dodge's office night}
<A>__{an impressive thunderstorm pounds on dodge's windows.}
<C>__{dodge}
<P>__{(pouring)}
<D>__{on the rocks, or neat?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{whatever you're having.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{well, why ruin good bourbon with the taste of some shitty sears icemaker, that's what i always say.}
<P>__{(handing tommy a glass)}
<D>__{cheers.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{cheers.}
<A>__{dodge downs his drink. tommy follows suit.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{son, you're a real comer. i wouldn't be surprised if you ended up in the leadership. i will say this: if i were speaker, i'd sleep better with you as a lieutenant.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{why, thank you, mr. chairman. you know, to tell you the truth, i didn't know you'd be on my side on those power lines.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{but i'm not.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{but you said you were sympathetic }
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{of course i did. we're all sympathetic to little girls with cancer. but i'm not sympathetic to holding an inquiry.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{but you said }
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{i know what i said. but that was just a press conference, son. i wasn't under oath.}
<A>__{the intercom buzzes.}
<C>__{dodge}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{yes?... bring them right in!}
<P>__{(hanging up)}
<D>__{look. son. it's great to get your name in the paper.}
<C>__{dodge }
<D>__{i bet the gentleman from iowa was all over the evening news in des moines tonight. getting good press letting them know you care that's what it's all about. smart move, tommy. but that's as far as i'd go with this, if i were you.}
<A>__{the door opens. dodge turns to see olaf anderson, tommy o'connor, and zeke bridges enter.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{what a surprise!}
<C>__{andersen}
<D>__{mr. chairman!}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{mr. chairman! hello, tommy. zeke you're looking well, good to see you.}
<C>__{zeke}
<P>__{(wheezing)}
<D>__{good to see you, you old sum' bitch.}
<C>__{o'connor}
<D>__{evening, mr. chairman, thanks for taking the tommy, you s.o.b., they let you in here?}
<P>__{(indicating andersen and bridges)}
<D>__{you folks finally get to press flesh! olaf, meet tommy johnson. tommy, olaf andersen. chairman of gulf coast power.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{the boys here have told me a lot about you.}
<C>__{o'connor}
<D>__{yeah i told him you voted for him!}
<A>__{they all share a laugh. except for bridges, who squints at tommy.}
<C>__{andersen}
<D>__{glad to meet you, son. they tell me you've got a real talent for the game.}
<C>__{o'connor}
<D>__{and this is zeke bridges, ceo of pyramid insurance.}
<C>__{zeke}
<P>__{(still puzzling)}
<D>__{congressman.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{good to meet you.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{help me with these, would you, tommy?}
<A>__{he hands tommy a couple of drinks.}
<C>__{tommy}
<P>__{(to zeke)}
<D>__{chivas on the rocks?}
<C>__{zeke}
<P>__{(taking the drink)}
<D>__{you look awfully familiar.}
<A>__{tommy just smiles.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{tommy and i were just talking about power lines.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{yeah, what a coincidence. i thought this little party might be for me.}
<P>__{(to anderson)}
<D>__{you may not like this.}
<P>__{(to dodge)}
<D>__{i think we should hold those hearings.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{you really fell for the line that parents group fed you, didn't you?}
<A>__{tommy is struck by dodge's intelligence.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{how'd you know i met the parents group?}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{oh, i keep my ear to the ground, that's what a good politician does. listen, tommy, why don't we just get olaf's take on this.}
<C>__{andersen}
<D>__{it's tragic, cancer's a terrible thing, but there's no way you can link it to power lines. truth is, there's a bigger electromagnetic field given off by an electric blanket, or a microwave oven, than by those derricks.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{but there are studies that say }
<C>__{zeke}
<D>__{for every study that says one thing, i will show you a study saying another. we've studied it ourselves. nada.}
<C>__{andersen}
<D>__{there's not a single state health official anywhere in this country who says power lines cause cancer.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{but what if you're wrong?}
<A>__{as tommy persists, andersen looks increasingly angry.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{people didn't use to say smoking causes cancer, either. what if the evidence is just building, and some day we wake up and discover that your power lines are killing us?}
<C>__{andersen}
<P>__{(exploding)}
<D>__{"kill us"? "kill us"? you calling me a murderer? you're saying there's blood on these hands? how dare you talk to me like that, you }
<A>__{o'connor puts a restraining arm on andersen.}
<C>__{o'connor}
<D>__{calm down, olaf, calm down, he didn't mean it that way, did you, son? alright, gentlemen. easy.}
<A>__{andersen backs off, regains his composure. the outburst makes an impression on tommy.}
<D>__{tommy i'm just saying, it's worth looking into.}
<C>__{andersen}
<D>__{tommy do you want to move the power lines? do you know how much it would cost to bury them? millions. tens of millions. i don't have that money. the state doesn't have that money. you people up here sure don't have that money. you know who'd end up paying for it? folks who sent you here, that's who.}
<C>__{o'connor}
<D>__{now how'd you like the people in your district to think of you as the putz who tripled their electric bill? you think they'd thank you for that on election day?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{all i'm saying is, maybe we should hold hearings to look at }
<C>__{o'connor}
<D>__{think for a minute, boychik. you hold your hearings. overnight, everyone who lives near a substation finds the value of his home in the toilet. you kill the real estate market.}
<C>__{zeke}
<D>__{you kill the insurance companies.}
<C>__{o'connor}
<D>__{you kill the school district.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{you kill the local economy.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{for a smart boy, you're not thinking very politically.}
<A>__{tommy watches the lightning.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{maybe i should think about it.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{yeah, the system ain't perfect, but the fleas come with the dawg.}
<C>__{andersen}
<D>__{oh, by the way, tommy, on a completely different subject you don't have a state pac yet, do you? i'd like to give you a hundred thousand dollar corporate contribution to start one up.}
<C>__{zeke}
<D>__{my company would be honored to do the same.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{can you do that? i thought there were limits }
<C>__{o'connor}
<D>__{oh, it's all aboveboard, we all believe deeply in the rules. it's just that the state rules are often more flexible about these things.}
<C>__{andersen}
<D>__{are you interested?}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{i'm always interested in the happiness of my constituents.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{i will drink to that.}
<A>__{dodge and andersen shoot each other a look.}
