<A>__{the unit seven van pulls up in the spooky shadows under the bridge, stopping next to helen's red accord. the door slides open and helen gets out, helped my black garbed hands. she is wearing her hood, which is whisked off by one of the hands. she whirls in time to see the door slide shut and the van speed off. she watches it drive off into the night.}
