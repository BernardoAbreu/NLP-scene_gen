<L>__{interior eddie's bedroom night}
<A>__{eddie stands, naked, at the window, looking out.}
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{what are you doing, hon?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{he walks back over to her, looks down. she is snuggled up in eddie's pillow, looking very pretty and vulnerable.}
<C>__{lindy}
<D>__{what, you think somebody's watching?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{he's lying. he's not sure.}

<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{with success comes enemies.}
