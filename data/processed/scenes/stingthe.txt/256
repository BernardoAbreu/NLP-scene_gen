<A>__{we follow lonnegan across the street and into the store. the bodyguards remain outside.}
<L>__{interior the store}
<A>__{the store is buzzing with activity. money and booze are everywhere. the sheet writer and the boardmarker can hardly keep up with the action. lonnegan walks quickly to the betting line and finds to his relief that there's only one man ahead of him. the man puts $25,000 on king's image. lonnegan steps to the window, swings up the brief case, and opens it for niles to see.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<P>__{(straight faced)}
<D>__{five hundred grand on syphon.}
<A>__{niles is struck dumb. he's never seen that much money before.}
<C>__{niles}
<P>__{(playing the flustered clerk)}
<D>__{hold on, i will have to get the manager.}
<A>__{niles goes and returns with gondorff.}
<C>__{gondorff}
<D>__{what's the problem?}
<C>__{niles}
<P>__{(pointing to the brief case)}
<D>__{he wants to put a half million on syphon.}
<A>__{gondorff looks at the money a second and then looks up at lonnegan like he's gotta be crazy.}
<C>__{gondorff}
<P>__{(uneasily)}
<D>__{i can't lay that off in time. we lose a bet that big, it could break us.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<P>__{(challenging)}
<D>__{if ya win it could make ya, too.}
<C>__{gondorff}
<P>__{(to niles)}
<D>__{what are the odds on syphon?}
<C>__{niles}
<D>__{eight to one.}
<A>__{gondorff looks at lonnegan long and hard.}
<C>__{gondorff}
<D>__{a half mill on an eight to one shot. you're dumber than i thought, lonnegan.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{you're more gutless than i thought.}
<A>__{the words "last flash" are heard on the speaker. gondorff looks at lonnegan with utter contempt. he turns to niles.}
<C>__{gondorff}
<P>__{(chopped)}
<D>__{take it.}
<A>__{niles hurriedly writes out a slip for 500,000 dollars. lonnegan, allowing himself a sly smile, picks it up and retires to a nearby table. he flashes a little okay sign to hooker who acknowledges it with a nod.}
<C>__{caller}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, this is arnold rowe, your caller for the san antonio handicap at pimlico in baltimore a mile and 1 16 for three year olds. and they're off.}
<A>__{lonnegan takes a deep breath and leans forward in his chair, the larceny boiling in his veins. hooker looks to gondorff. gondorff gives him the "office." hooker has to smile.}
<C>__{caller}
<D>__{and around the first turn it's king's image by a neck, syphon is second by one, key to the vault third by one half, followed by mr. moonlight, red ridge, moneyman and no charge.}
<A>__{unexpectedly, kid twist bursts in through the entrance. barely able to control his enthusiasm, he hurries over to lonnegan's table and sits down next to him.}
<C>__{twist}
<D>__{sorry, but i just couldn't wait. did everything go all right?}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<P>__{(motioning for him to keep his voice down)}
<D>__{take it easy. everything's all right. i put it on syphon, on the nose.}
<C>__{twist}
<P>__{(in utter horror)}
<D>__{on the nose! i said place. place it on syphon. that horse is going to run second.}
<A>__{lonnegan looks like he's just been stabbed. he vaults over the table to the teller's window and grabs niles.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{you give me my goddamn money back! you hear me? there's been a mistake!}
<C>__{niles}
<D>__{i'm sorry, sir. the betting's closed.}
<A>__{lonnegan begins to shake him violently.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{you give me my money back. there's been a mistake, do you hear me?}
<A>__{gondorff leaps to niles' aid when suddenly there is a crash at the entrance door, and polk, snyder and eight federal agents burst into the room, guns drawn. the place falls silent except for the loudspeaker, the members of the boost afraid to move. gondorff and niles look at each other wondering how this could have possibly happened.}
<C>__{polk}
<P>__{(motioning to hooker)}
<D>__{all right, hooker, you can go.}
<A>__{hooker's eyes go to gondorff, who looks back at him in utter disbelief, the betrayal raging in his features. hooker, unable to meet his gaze, lowers his head and starts to walk out. almost unnoticed, there's a flash of movement at gondorff's belt. a small gun. a shot. hooker clutches his back and falls dead on the floor, the blood spurting from his mouth. polk, reacting instantly, pours four shots into gondorff, who goes down in a heap. pandemonium breaks loose. the members of the boost race for the door. lonnegan is totally stunned. first he lost his money and now he's involved in a murder. snyder rushes over to him.}
<C>__{snyder}
<D>__{c'mon. we gotta get you outa here.}
