<L>__{exterior notre dame day}
<A>__{the plaza is filled with tourists. moving through the crowd is sami zerhouni, algerian, late 20's, a small time street hustler, dressed in jeans and a "i love paris" tee shirt. he passes a man who is about to take a picture and lifts his wallet. sami moves on. he sees two overweight women standing at a vendor's cart, holding a large wad of money. the woman puts the cash back in her purse, but does not zip it up. sami moves in behind her and slips his hand into the purse. she zips the bag closed. sami's face fills with pain as the zipper catches the hair of his arm. the women walk towards the cathedral. sami has no choice but follow after them. he tries to match their pace so he doesn't alert them of his presence. the woman looks back and sees sami's hand. she pulls her bag away, ripping a section of hair off his arm, then swings the bag, putting all of her weight behind it. it hits sami squarely in the face. he lands on his back with a thud. wallets and billfolds fly out from every one of his pockets. he staggers to his feet and starts to pick up the wallets when he sees... his pov across the plaza: of two police officers moving towards him . he knows he has no more time. he takes off running, disappearing into the crowd.}
