<L>__{interior kitchen morning}
<A>__{rachel is cleaning the kitchen again, clearing some of the mess of dishes into the sink. she moves a dirty pan which has been left overnight and stops, staring at the cockroach which is crawling inside. a sudden wave of nausea hits her. bathroom moments later rachel crouches at the toilet, vomiting. she finishes, rinses her mouth, looks at her pale reflection. she opens the door and steps out... vogel stands directly in front of her. rachel stands frozen a split second of total panic. then stephan steps into sight behind vogel, gun in hand the morning bathroom visit. rachel flattens herself against the hall wall, quickly wiping her mouth dry, as stephan pushes vogel past her towards the bathroom.}
