<L>__{interior bjurman's apartment night}
<A>__{bjurman slowly comes to.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{good. you're alive.}
<A>__{it takes him a moment to realize it's true. another to realize it might be better if he wasn't since he's naked on the floor, face up, wrists and ankles bound. he tries to cry out and realizes he's also gagged. she emerges from the shadows, stands over him, and he sees that her eyes are ringed in black mascara like some kind of ghoulish raccoon. she looks insane. as she steps out of his field of view, and his hands struggle against the restraints.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{recognize this?}
<A>__{he cranes his neck to see she's by her backpack that's resting on a chair.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{i had it with me last time. i set it here. remember?}
<P>__{(he doesn't)}
<D>__{see this snap? it's not a snap. it's a wide angle micro lens.}
<A>__{she takes a dvd r from the backpack, puts it in his player, flips his plasma tv on with a remote. she got it all what he did to her the rape in hd.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{this shows you sodomizing a mentally impaired girl. if it's ever seen outside this room, who'll be institutionalized then?}
<A>__{he starts to whimper.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{here's what's going to happen. pay attention.}
<A>__{he can't. he can't even look at her. his life is over. he weeps into the gag.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{look at me.}
<A>__{he won't. she strides to her backpack. takes out a large dildo. gets on her knees, and works it into his ass. she can only get it about halfway up. she has to stand up and kick it the rest of the way with her boot. he howls into the gag.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{do i have your attention now?}
<A>__{she does indeed. he vigorously nods his head, now, and after everything she says }
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{when you can walk again, which i admit could be a while, we're going to my bank. you'll tell them i alone have access to my account. after that, you'll never contact me again. each month you'll write a report of a meeting we won't have. you'll describe how well i'm doing, how sociable i'm becoming. then you'll negotiate with the court to have my declaration of incompetence lifted. if you fail, this video will spread across the internet like a virus.}
<P>__{(he stares in horror)}
<C>__{salander }
<D>__{if something happens to me if i get hit by a car if you hit me with a car same thing, it uploads automatically.}
<A>__{she fishes his apartment keys from his trousers. shows him that she has them.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{i'm taking these with me. i will be checking on you. if i ever find anyone in here with you, whether she came of her own free will or not }
<A>__{his eyes dart to the tv as he nods that he understands.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{no. not the video.}
<A>__{she kicks him. then straddles his fat gut and looks him in the eye.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{i will kill you.}
<A>__{and he knows she means it.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{do you doubt anything i've said?}
<P>__{(he shakes his head no)}
<D>__{do you doubt what's in the reports about me? what do they say when you sum them up? they say i'm insane.}
<P>__{(he shakes his head no)}
<D>__{no, it okay. you can nod because it's true. i am insane.}
<A>__{she gets up off him, rummages through her backpack again.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{i know it'll be hard for you to abide by my rules. especially no more sex. i'm going to make it easier for you.}
<A>__{she puts on a plastic surgical mask. he fears the next thing he'll see is a pair of scissors in her hand, but it isn't. it's something else he doesn't recognize. she straddles him again. he squirms under her weight.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{lie still. i've never done this before.}
<A>__{he sees that the thing in her hand is some kind of surgical device, a shiny stripped down gun with a sharp point and a plastic ink bottle where the bullets would go.}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{there will be some blood.}
<A>__{he struggles to twist his body away, but it's useless. she digs the tattooing gun's needle into his chest and begins dragging it back and forth. he screams as dots of blood spatter her plastic mask ...}
