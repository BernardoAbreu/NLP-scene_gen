<A>__{jack strains, trying to budge one of the bars. even with the damage from the cannon ball, it won't move. he hears the sound of the door latch the door opens, and will slips in. looks around. jack lounges on the floor of his cell, apparently relaxed and unconcerned. will marches straight up to the bars.}

<D>__{surely you've heard the stories? the black pearl sails from the dreaded isla de mureta... an island that cannot be found except by those who already know where it is.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{the ship's real enough. so its anchorage must be a real place. where is it?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{why ask me?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{because you're a pirate.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{and you want to turn pirate yourself?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{never.}
<P>__{(beat)}

<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(he was right)}
<D>__{so it is that you found a girl. well, if you're intending to brave all and hasten to her rescue and so win fair lady's heart, you'll have to do it alone. i see no profit in it for me.}
<A>__{will slams his fist against the bars in frustration. jack is surprised at the outburst. will thinks ... makes a decision.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i can get you out of here.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how? the key's run off.}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(examines the cell)}
<D>__{i helped build these cells. those are hook and ring hinges. the proper application of strength, the door'll lift free. just calls for the right lever and fulcrum. . .}
<A>__{jack watches will as he speaks, and it dawns on him will is the spitting image of someone he's known in the past.}
<C>__{jack}

<D>__{will turner...}
<P>__{(he stands)}
<D>__{i will tell you what, mr. turner. i've changed my mind. you spring me from this cell, and on pain of death, i will you to the black pearl.}

<C>__{will}
<D>__{agreed.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{agreed!}
<A>__{will looks around, figures out what he needs. he makes a chair his fulcrum, and levers the long bench under the door. pushes down it's hard work but the cell door rises, and then falls forward, crashing down on the bench and chair. jack is impressed. he steps out of the cell.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{someone will have heard that. hurry.}
<A>__{will heads for the door. jack searches the desk, cupboards.}

<D>__{my business, will. as for your business one question, or there's no use going.}
