<A>__{sandra and audrey are locked in battle. sandra slaps audrey hard. audrey stumbles over kyle and hits the floor. percy appears in the doorway. now is her last chance. sandra whips open the back door and that's when the world hits slow motion. howard is there. a few feet away. alive. sandra races toward him. just behind her comes percy.}

<A>__{and that's when the speed accelerates to normal and the boils covering howard's body explode spraying streams of dark fluid toward sandra just at the moment percy spins around her, shielding her from the spray, which hits him in the back. but he's not stopping. percy pushes sandra back into the diner, the door slamming closed behind them. percy releases sandra, letting her stumble hysterically into the room. kyle and jeep grab her, forcing her to the ground. but she's not fighting anymore. charlie turns to look at percy who is still standing with his back to the door, breathing heavily.}
