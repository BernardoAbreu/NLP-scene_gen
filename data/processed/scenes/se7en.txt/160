<L>__{interior mills' car late afternoon}
<A>__{mills drives, looking to the back seat through the rearview mirror. a steel mesh partition separates front from back. john doe sits with his hands cuffed. he is dressed in gray pants and a gray shirt. his feet are cuffed to a metal fastener on the floor of the car. rivulets of sweat pour down his face. he seems wired.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{what's your story, johnny? who are you, really?}
<A>__{doe pushes his glasses back up the bridge of his nose, looks at mills' eyes in the rearview mirror.}
<C>__{john doe}
<D>__{it doesn't matter who i am. who i am means absolutely nothing.}
