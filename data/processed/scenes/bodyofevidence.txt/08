<L>__{exterior cemetery morning}
<A>__{gray clouds hang over head. a light drizzle falls. a group of mourners hold umbrellas as they stand around the grave. in the b.g. the press is visible, held back my private security guards. a woman dressed in black stands in the front of the mouners, her face hidden behind a hat and veil. raymond sattler, a tall, distinguished looking man in his sixties stands beside her. he supports his weight with the aid of a cane. the service concludes. sattler along with several other people offer her their condolences. joanne braslow is there. she does not go over to rebecca. cardenas and reese stand off to the side by a large oak tree. cardenas watches and waits. he steps forward as sattler leads the woman by.}

<D>__{miss lawson?}
<A>__{the woman stops. her back is to cardenas.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{i'm district attorney, john cardenas.}
<A>__{rebecca lawson removes her hat and veil and slowly turns around. she is in her late twenties. a deep pain fills her face controlled, but evident. her eyes are tired heavy from crying but no tears show now. this is a woman whose grief is private and not displayed for others. although emotionally drained she is still stunningly beautiful. so beautiful that even cardenas' usually cool demeanor cannot hide how impressed he is.}
<C>__{sattler}
<D>__{i don't think that this is the time, or the place.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{i just wanted to introduce myself and inform miss lawson that there will be an inquiry.}
<C>__{sattler}
<D>__{an inquiry into what?}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{for starters i'd like to know why she left the house and didn't report the death?}
<C>__{sattler}
<D>__{because he wasn't dead when she left, and even if he was, not reporting a natural death in a timely fashion isn't a crime.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{did i say it was a natural death?}
<A>__{cardenas and rebecca lock eyes. rebecca stares at him genuinely shocked by his accusation. cardenas nods and walks away. in the b.g. we see joanne staring at rebecca with hostility.}
