<L>__{interior sommensen's warehouse night}
<A>__{blackness. the sound of wind. of water lapping at wood. click of a key, springing a lock. the scrape of a large padlock sliding away. a door creaks open, and from the sound of it, a large one. gray light seeps in.}
<C>__{moran }
<D>__{blackmail. that's all it is.}
<A>__{see them now. three silhouettes framed in thr barn's open doorway. against the night sky.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{i call it keeping your promise. we said if i ever needed some cooperation from you...}
<A>__{a soft click, and the lights go on. such as they are. a few bare bulbs strung across the rafters of this towering ramshackle enclosure. a 50 year old mildewed barn, built of creosoted timbers. this is a place for overhauling boats, with sea doors facing the harbor. two boats are tied to wide elbowed piers. we've seen them before.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{you threatened me, chambers, pure and simple. and what idiot's gonna believe some cock and bull story that i made a deal to keep stuff outta your paper? not that anybody reads your paper.}
<A>__{abel martenson leads the way. along soaking planks.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{same idiots who'll believe you cracked this case. when i tell 'em you did.}
<A>__{moran snorts. points up to the cross spar, high on the mast of the first boat.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{see, no lantern.}
<C>__{abel }
<D>__{sheriff? that's miyamoto's boat.}
<A>__{oh. moran swings his gaze up to the second boat.}
<C>__{moran }
<D>__{no lantern there, neither.}
<A>__{sure enough. no lantern on the cross spar. they keep walking.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{never shoulda given you that inventory in the first place.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{it's public record. if the public cares enough to read it.}
<A>__{they step across the gunnel. onto carl heine's boat. flashlights working against the dim, eerie glow of distant bulbs, they enter carl's cabin. neat as a pin. ishmael scans the floor.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{you said there was a coffee c...}
<C>__{abel }
<D>__{i picked it up.}
<A>__{and points to the cup. sitting on the counter.}
<C>__{abel}
<D>__{it's the only thing i moved, i swear. it was right there.}
<A>__{the sheriff glares at the boy.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{you wanna see that in the papers ? don't ever touch something at a cri...}
<A>__{and stops. because ishmael's gaze has gone to a kerosene lantern. in the corner.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{one lantern. like the inventory says. sorry to disappoint you.}
<A>__{but ishmael is out the door. shining his flashlight. up the mast.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{actually. i was hoping you got it right. what's that, up there?}
<A>__{and they all squint up. shining their lights together. along the cross spar.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{nothin'. bits of string.}
<A>__{that's what it looks like. many of them.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{pieces of twine aren't nothing.}
<A>__{and he steps to the base of the mast. puts the flashlight in his pocket. wraps his arm around the shaft of wood.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{here now, what are you fixin' to do?}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{have a look. at nothing.}
<A>__{and wrapping his legs around the mast, he hoists himself up.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{you can't go up there, touch things...}
<A>__{with all his strength. ishmael begins to climb.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{trial's over, sheriff, it's with the jury now.}
<A>__{supporting himself with his legs, he struggles upward.}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{you gonna climb that with one arm?}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{you're right. i better use two.}
<A>__{up he goes, inching his way, abel shining his flashlight. moran swings his beam up, too.}
<C>__{abel}
<D>__{there's lots of 'em, art, look.}
<A>__{and moran is looking. saying nothing. now, ishmael is there.}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{a dozen or more, all figure eights. all cut clean through on an angle.}
<C>__{abel}
<D>__{and look at that streak of rust, across the mast.}
<A>__{his light playing on it. bracing his full weight with his legs, ishmael fingers the scraps of rope...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{it's on the twine, too. but it's not r...}
<C>__{moran}
<D>__{don't prove there was two lanterns. coulda been the one in the cabin.}
<A>__{still supporting himself with his legs, ishmael pulls out his flashlight...}
<C>__{ishmael}
<D>__{there's a stretch of ground between guessin' and provin', sheriff. i will give you that.}
<A>__{...shines it down on the deck. along the gunnel. just below the mast. and as we watch the circle of light move...}
<C>__{moran }
<D>__{what do you think you're lookin' at now?}
<A>__{still moving. and in the silence, an absent...}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{not what i'm looking at. it's what i'm looking for.}
