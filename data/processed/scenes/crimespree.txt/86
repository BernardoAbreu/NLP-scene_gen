<L>__{interior motel room later morning}
<A>__{a knock on the door. sami clamps his hand over sophie's mouth just in case she gets any stupid ideas. daniel opens the door. agent hadley steps in, stares at daniel, then feels the barrel of zero's gun pressed against his head. hadley steps into the room. daniel closes the door. zero searches him. finds a gun which he gives to daniel, then a wallet. he opens it and sees his fbi identification.}
<C>__{zero}
<D>__{he's fbi.}
<A>__{zero knowingly bends down and removes hadley's backup gun which is strapped to his ankle. he gives the gun to sami.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{what is she doing with an agent du fbi?}
<A>__{sami looks at her at hadley at the black canvas bag. slowly it starts to come together in his mind.}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{we've been set up.}
<A>__{he stares at sophie angrily.}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{we didn't go to the wrong house. we went to right one, didn't we sophie?}
<A>__{her expression gives away nothing.}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{they send us to zammito's house. the fbi is right across the street watching the whole thing, but they don't move. a crime is going down and they don't move. why?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{because they were waiting for us to come out so they could arrest us.}
<C>__{zero}
<D>__{what does arresting us get them?}
<C>__{sami}
<P>__{(to hadley)}
<D>__{you wanna tell him?}
<C>__{agent hadley}
<D>__{you're telling it fine.}
<A>__{daniel motions to zero.}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{you see my friend over there? i nod to him and he's going to put a bullet in your knee.}
<A>__{zero stares at hadley, just waiting for daniel to give him the go ahead.}
<C>__{agent hadley}
<D>__{you wouldn't.}
<A>__{daniel nods. zero aims his gun at hadley's knee cap.}
<C>__{agent hadley}
<D>__{that's going to make a lot of noise. not much time for a conversation after you pull the trigger.}
<A>__{they know he's right.}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{he's got a pointerior}
<A>__{sami lifts up a heavy brass lamp from the nightstand. he pulls the electrical cord out of the base, then touches two wires together. they spark. before hadley can say a word sami touches them to his hand. hadley's body jerks violent as he screams. sami removes the wires. hadley winces in pain from the burn mark on his hand.}
<C>__{agent hadley}
<D>__{okay! okay! we've been investigating zammito for years, but we've never had enough evidence for a warrant to search his house. we got word through a snitch that zammito was planning on taking bonanno out.}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{we know all this.}
<C>__{agent hadley}
<D>__{you just don't take out a boss. you need permission from the other families to do something like that. our informant told us that zammito was talking with other bosses and recording their conversations in case they later claimed they weren't involved. look at these tapes. the guy has recorded every conversation he's had for years.}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{so we rob zammito. you arrest us when we come out and the contents of the safe is now evidence which you can use against him.}
<A>__{agent hadley nods.}
<C>__{sami}
<P>__{(to sophie)}
<D>__{what are you getting out of this?}
<A>__{there is no point in hiding anything now.}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{money. it was supposed to simple. in and out.}
<P>__{(more)}
<C>__{sophie }
<D>__{zammito wasn't supposed to be there.}
