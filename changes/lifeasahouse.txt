<ACTION>__{GEORGE NELSON, 42, squints and shivers as the spotty morning light and ocean breeze enter through an open window.  Bold waves crash against the cliffs outside the room.  A five-foot wide stack of hand hewed beams are piled pyramid style, making movement in the room next to impossible.  George stands shirtless in underwear and coughs again.  He steps over a pile of tools and stands at the window, facing the sea.  A happy sounding tune by Guster, "WHAT YOU WISH FOR," begins with the lyrics: 'Woke up today, to everything gray and all that I saw just keeps going on and on...'}

The song continues with: '...sweep all the pieces under the bed, close all the curtains and cover my head.'  Sam looks wasted as he climbs out of bed and rummages through his dresser, retrieving an empty bottle of prescription drugs; he tosses the bottle.  He walks to a desk where a half-built model of a house sits unfinished and squeezes glue into a plastic bag and sniffs it.  Sam enters the closet and digs into a pile of dirty clothes, pulling out the tie to a robe; he knots it around the closet pole and then twists it once to form a noose.  He slips his neck through the noose and lowers his body; though we don't see exactly what he's doing below his neck, it's evident through his jerking arm that he's masturbating.}
