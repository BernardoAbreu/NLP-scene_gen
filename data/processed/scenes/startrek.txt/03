<A>__{sarek (late 40's, a vulcan) comes out to the balcony through the rear doors of the home. he moves to amanda and kneels. he looks at the child his child and says:}
<C>__{sarek}
<D>__{well done.}
<A>__{she looks at him for a beat, then says, flatly with just enough rancor:}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{he regards her. knows he's in trouble }
<C>__{sarek}
<D>__{your tone suggests disappointment. the science council required my presence for a session regarding }
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{don't do that. you knew i wanted you here.}
<A>__{the vulcan midwives share a look. sarek glances at them. nods. the two women excuse themselves. sarek reaches over, touches a small touchpad the harpsichord music stops. he says, clinically:}
<C>__{sarek}
<D>__{as you are aware, the vulcan male is traditionally not present at the moment of delivery.}

<A>__{she looks at sarek: spock it is.}
<C>__{sarek}
