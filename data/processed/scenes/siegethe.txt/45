<L>__{2,000 detainees}
<A>__{all young men between the ages of sixteen and thirty are milling about. squatting, smoking, pacing, some laughing, most looking terrified. all spread across: the halogen lit football field armed guards backlit in the upper tiers. enlisted men passing out blankets and soup. nearby, hub sees tina, standing quite still finally, she is able to speak.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{1942, my father was put into the camps at manzanar. until the end of the war. two years. now he roots for the dodgers and swears it could never happen again.}
<A>__{moments later on the field hub asks for devereaux, is directed across the field, through an aisle in the wire cages. frank haddad looms out of the shadows. he looks terrible, drawn. furious.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{they got frankie. my kid's here someplace }
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{frank, slow down }
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(fighting back tears of rage)}
<D>__{he's only thirteen, for chrissake }
<A>__{nearby, the "allahuh akbar," call, to evening prayer.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{i will get him out.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{they came into my house. my wife told them who i was }

<D>__{how many times did i put it on the line, hub ? how many times }
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{frank }
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we're american citizens, twenty years. ten years in the bureau they knocked her down... and took him. out of my own house.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{it's wrong, frank. what can i say to you, but it's... all... terribly... horribly... wrong.}
<P>__{(takes his arm)}
<D>__{now, come with me.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no! i've got to find him. besides, this is where i belong.}
<P>__{(takes out his wallet, hands over his badge)}
<D>__{here. i'm not their sand nigger anymore.}
<A>__{hub watches as he he walks away. a muezzin chants the call to evening prayer. frank drops to his knees and joins the rest of the prisoners.}
<B>__{the locker room}
<A>__{has been transformed in a command post.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{ and his name is haddad?}

<C>__{col. hardwick}
<D>__{don't get in my face, hubbard. i might decide you're an ethiopian.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{and you're just stupid enough to think that's an insult.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{if a mistake's been made we'll fix it.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{there is no "if". i'm vouching for this kid. i want him out.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{and i said we will look into it.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{you mean, like you're looking into me? surveilling me? breaking up my operations? if i'd known i was going to have to do your job for you i would never have left the army.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{there's an fbi office in anchorage, agent hubbard. fuck with me and you'll be learning a hundred and fifty new words for snow.}
<A>__{the two men stare at each other.}

<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{the prisoner is being interrogated.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{i want to see him.}
<A>__{devereaux just looks at him as we cut to:}
<B>__{the tiled shower room}
<A>__{tariq is strapped, naked, into a folding metal chair. his head lolls on his chest, his eyes are dulled. on a nearby table, an empty syringe. two mp's stand guard. sharon is speaking softly to him in arabic. suddenly, tarak spits in her face. she wipes it off as if it is nothing.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{how long have you been at it?}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{not long enough, apparently.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{how much longer, do you think, before he gives up the other cells }
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{he can't give up the other cells if he doesn't know about them.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{he knows.}
<C>__{hub}
<P>__{(gestures to sharon)}
<D>__{what about her briefing? the strategy session she said the cells don't know about each other, that they }
<A>__{devereaux ignores him. turns to sharon.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{how long before he breaks?}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{at this rate. too long. the theatre was hit nine hours after we took down the first cell.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{so what other models do we have ?}
<A>__{no one wants to be the first to step into uncharted terrain.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{shaking.}
<A>__{nobody answers.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{what about it, sharon?}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{ won't work.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{works for the israelis.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{only in conjunction with sleep deprivation. needs at least thirty six hours.}
<A>__{hub stares at sharon as the dark side of her professional life is revealed.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{we don't have thirty six hours.}
<A>__{another silence. they're teetering on the edge of the abyss.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{electric shock?}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{the neurotransmitters just shut down.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{water?}

<D>__{are you people insane ?}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{the time has come for one man to suffer in order to save the lives of hundreds}
<C>__{hub}

<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{you're welcome to wait outside.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{general... you've lost men, i've lost men... but what you're doing... it doesn't work in belfast. it doesn't work in gaza. and it won't work here.}

<D>__{first, then in a}
<P>__{rush:)}
<D>__{ what if... they don't want their leader back at all? you said yourself, we don't even have him. maybe what they really want is that we herd our children into stadiums. put soldiers into our streets. radicalize people who want to think of themselves as americans. bend the law, shred the constitution.}
<P>__{(searches for the}
<D>__{kind of words that}
<P>__{come so hard to him:)}
<D>__{because if we torture him and let's call it what it is... you... and i... then the country men like us have sworn to defend. and bled to defend. and died to defend... is gone.}

<D>__{and they've won.}
<A>__{gen. devereaux stares hard at hub. and then:}
<C>__{devereaux}
<P>__{(to col. hardwick)}
<D>__{i think we have to soundproof the room before we begin.}
