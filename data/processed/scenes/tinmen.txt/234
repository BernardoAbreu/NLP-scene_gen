<D>__{you know, when i saw 'bonanza' the other day, something occurred to me. there's those three guys living on the ponderosa and you never hear them say anything about wanting to get laid. you never hear hoss turn to little joe and say 'i had such a hard on when i woke up this morning.' you know ... they never talk about broads ... nothing. ya never hear little joe say 'hey, hoss, i went into virginia city and saw a girl with the greatest ass i ever saw in my life.' ya just see 'em walking around the ponderosa saying, 'yes, pa,' and 'where's little joe?' nothing about broads. i don't think i'm being too picky... at least once if they talked about getting horny. i don't care if you're living on the ponderosa or right here in baltimore, guys talk about getting laid.}
