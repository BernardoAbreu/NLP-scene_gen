<A>__{finnegan runs wildly down a passageway. he rounds a corner. a tentacle side swipes him. hard. smashes him into a wall. finnegan drops the shotgun. hits the floor running. another tentacles checks him. sends him spiraling through a hatch. finnegan tumbles in. face first. quickly rolls over and looks back a tentacle lashes in through the doorway. finnegan back pedals on his hands and feet, stumbling over various sports equipment. the tentacle homes in on him. charges forward. finnegan hurls himself backwards. throwing anything that comes to hand at the tentacle. a volleyball. a waterski. a tackle box. a frisbee. but onward it comes. finnegan back pedals faster. over diving gear. scuba tanks. fins and masks. the tentacle rises. about to strike. finnegan backs into the wall. trapped. he spots a speargun. grabs it. the tentacle lunges. finnegan fires. nails it. pins it to the wall. finnegan scrambles past the furiously writhing tentacle and runs out of the room.}
