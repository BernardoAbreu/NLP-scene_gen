<L>__{exterior square day (early evening)}
<A>__{sunil stands outside the clinic, rolling his sleeves down. anouar waits at a polite distance. exhausted but exhilarated, max and aloka emerge with an elderly woman patient, max singing chuck berry to the woman's embar rassed delight: "they're really rockin' in boston, in philadelphia, p.a..." sunil looks at his american colleague, smiles a small smile.}
<C>__{sunil}
<D>__{good night, i will see you day after tomorrow.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{good night, sunil.}
<A>__{"... deep in the heart of texas, around the frisco bay..." manooj and shambu come charging at max with the soccer ball, hoping to engage him as a playmate. hasari returns home with his rickshaw. selima waves at max, indicates she's cooking dinner. joan wanders out of the school as the kids are released and go charging through the square. joan has the pal kids in hand.}
<C>__{selima}
<D>__{very special supper for you tonight, doctor big brother! will you stay?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{wish i could, selima, because i'm sure hungry! sixteen hours of pestilence and misery always make me famished. i have to go with my man anouar tonight. i've got lepers to heal!}
<C>__{anouar}
<D>__{no, no, you know how patient we are. eat, eat.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(to aloka)}
<D>__{you're not tired, are you?}
<C>__{aloka}
<D>__{not if you're not.}
<A>__{between hasari and aloka, there's just a flicker of tension; evidently, this has become max's (and her) normal day. but he's also worried about the note from ashoka. joan joins them with the pal children.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{well, i think we've got three very good potential scholars here.}
<A>__{behind the children's backs, she points at manooj and indicates the kid's really got a head.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{given him some time here, he'll be good enough for a proper school.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{it's more than a father could hope.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{fifteen years from now: miami, florida, dr. manooj pal, in association with dr. maxwell loeb.}
<A>__{for a moment, hasari is swept up in this little reverie, then remembers reality.}
<C>__{hasari}
<P>__{(giving her the note)}
<D>__{from the godfather's son. for you and the doctor.}
<A>__{amidst instant concern, joan opens the envelope. looks at max. we hear the sound of bangladesh music.}
