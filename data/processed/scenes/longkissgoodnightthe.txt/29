<A>__{close on tv: stooge joe besser mugs wildly, takes a pie in the face. jack raises his arm for the killing stroke samantha takes hal's cream pie from the counter and shatters every bone in his face. comes from nowhere. back foot planted, body twisting, entire organism focused into the outstretched arm, whack ! we have never seen anyone move this fast. samantha recoils. startled by what she's done the glass dish is splintered into his head. it sticks there. he topples. hits the linoleum. she straddles him, breathing hard. winded. the barking dog "jingle bells" plays inanely in the background. samantha stares. trembling. pokes the body. nothing. pokes it again. still nothing. she leans forward. grips the neck and wrenches, crack ! just making sure. she out of it. in shock. glaring at her own hands as if demanding an excuse for their behavior. there is pie filling on her fingers. she kneels beside the corpse, catatonic. stares. absent mindedly licks the bloodied cream. hal is standing in the doorway. wide eyed. he has seen samantha break the man's neck. she looks at him, frowns.}
