<B>__{flare to white}
<T>__{fade in from white:}
<A>__{slowly the white becomes a barely perceptible image: white particles wave over a white background. a snowfall. a car bursts through the curtain of snow. the car is equipped with a hitch and is towing another car, a brand new light brown cutlass ciera with the pink sales sticker showing in its rear window. as the car roars past, leaving snow swirling in their dirft, the title of the film fades in.}

<A>__{green highway signs point the way to moorehead, minnesota fargo, north dakota. the roads for the two cities diverge. a sign says welcome to north dakota and another just after says now entering fargo, nd, pop. 44,412. the car pulls into a rodeway inn.}

<B>__{kitchen}
<A>__{we track toward the back door. a curtain is stretched tight across its window. jean pulls the curtain back. bright sunlight amplified by snow floods in. a man in an orange ski mask looks up from the lock. jean gasps, drops the curtain, rutns and runs into a taller man, also in a ski mask, already in the house. we hear the crack of the back door window being smashed. the tall man gaear grimsrud grabs jean's wrist. she screams, staring at her own imprisoned wrist, then wraps her gaping mouth around grimsrud's gloved thumb and bites down hard. he drops her wrist. as carl enters, she races up the stairs.}

<A>__{grimsrud has a crowbar jammed in between the bathroom door and frame, and is working it.}
<B>__{bathroom}
<A>__{jean crosses to a high window above the toilet and throws it open. snow that had drifted against the window sifts lightly in. jean steps up onto the toilet. the door creaks, moving as one piece in its frame. jean glances back as she steps up from the toilet seat to the tank. the groaning of the door ends with the wood around its knob splintering and the knob itself falling out onto the floor. the door swings open. grimsrud and carl enter.}
<B>__{their pov}
<A>__{room empty, window open. carl strides to the window and hoists himself out. grimsrud opens the medicine cabinet and delicately taps aside various bottles and tubes, seeking the proper unguent. he finds a salve but after a moment sets it down, noticing something in the mirror. the shower curtain is drawn around the tub. he steps toward it. as he reaches for the curtain, it explodes outward, animated by thrashing limbs. jean, screaming, tangled in the curtain, rips it off its rings and stumbles out into the bedroom. grimsrud follows.}

<A>__{hold in black. a slow tilt down from night sky brings the head of a large paper mache figure into frame. it is a flannel shirt woodsman carrying a double edged ax over one shoulder. as we hear the rumble of an approaching car, the continuing tilt and boom down brings us down the woodsman's body to a pedestal. a sweep of headlights illuminates a sign on the pedestal: welcome to brainderd home of paul bunyan. the headlights sweep off and a car hums past and on into the background. the two lane highway is otherwise empty.}

<C>__{carl}
<D>__{how can i help you, officer?}

<C>__{grimsrud}
<D>__{shut up.}

<A>__{the wrecked car's headlights shine off into a snowfield abutting the highway. a young man in a down parka is limping across the snowfield, away from the wrecked car. grimsrud strides calmly out after the injured boy. he raises his gun and fires. with a poof of feathers, a hole opens up in the boy's back and he pitches into the snow. grimsrud walks up to the wreck and peers in its half open door. a young woman is trapped inside the twisted wreckage, injured. snow swirls in the headlights of the wreck. grimsrud raises his gun and fires.}
