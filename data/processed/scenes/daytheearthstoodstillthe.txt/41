<L>__{interior hospital room full shot day}
<A>__{as harley enters. klaatu is up out of bed, walking around in a medical corps robe and pajamas. he appears to be completely recovered.}
<C>__{harley}
<D>__{good afternoon.}
<P>__{(surprised not to find him in bed)}
<D>__{i'm glad to see you up and around.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{thank you... have you any news?}
<C>__{harley}
<D>__{not very good news, i'm afraid.}
<P>__{(digs into his}
<D>__{briefcase for some}
<P>__{papers)}
<D>__{the president accepted your suggestion and cabled the invitations for a meeting last night.}
<P>__{(grimly)}
<D>__{let me read you some of the replies.}
<P>__{(he selects a cable and reads)}
<D>__{"the premier wishes to inform the government of the united states that it will be impossible for him to attend the meeting suggested by the president unless the meeting is held in moscow."}
<P>__{(with a grimly pointed}
<D>__{glance at klaatu, harley reads another}
<P>__{cable)}
<D>__{"the suggestion of the president regarding the possibility of a meeting in moscow would be unacceptable to her majesty's government at the present time. representation could be sent only if the meeting were held in washington."}
<P>__{(he looks up at klaatu and shrugs)}
<D>__{well there you have it.}
<A>__{harley extends a sheaf of cables for klaatu's inspection, but he ignores them. klaatu has listened to this recital, first incredulously, then with mounting indignation. conscious of his quiet, olympian wrath, harley continues uncomfortably.}
<C>__{harley}
<D>__{i tried to make you understand. the suspicions the jealousies the mistrust }
<P>__{(uneasily, under klaatu's level gaze)}
<D>__{surely you realize that my government has done everything in its power }
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{it's not your government i'm thinking about. it's your world.}
<C>__{harley}
<D>__{now that you understand the situation more clearly, perhaps you'd like to discuss the matter with the president}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(sternly)}
<D>__{i will not speak to any one nation or group of nations.}
<P>__{(sharply, bitterly)}
<D>__{i don't intend to add my contribution to your childish jealousies and suspicions.}
<C>__{harley}
<D>__{our problems are very complex, mr. klaatu. you mustn't judge us too harshly.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{i can judge only by what i see.}
<C>__{harley}
<D>__{your impatience is quite understandable.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{i am impatient with stupidity. my people have learned to live without it.}
<C>__{harley}
<P>__{(ruefully)}
<D>__{i'm afraid my people haven't.}
<P>__{(with real sincerity)}
<D>__{i'm very sorry i wish it were otherwise.}
<A>__{reluctantly harley has picked up his hat and brief case. he finds klaatu staring out the window. close shot klaatu as he looks out the window thoughtfully. what he sees has given him an idea. med. shot hospital grounds shooting down, from klaatu's viewpoint, at people strolling about the hospital grounds. most of them are civilian visitors, but there is a sprinkling of nurses and ambulatory patients. full shot hospital room as klaatu turns back to harley, he speaks thoughtfully, incisively.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{before making any decisions, i think i should get out among your people become familiar with the basis for these strange, unreasoning attitudes.}
<C>__{harley}
<D>__{under the circumstances i'm afraid that will be impossible.}
<A>__{harley has paused near the door, a little embarrassed by klaatu's level gaze.}
<C>__{harley}
<D>__{i must ask that you don't attempt to leave the hospital. our military people have insisted on this. i'm sure you'll understand.}
<A>__{with a polite nod, he goes out. klaatu stares after him as he realizes that he is in effect a prisoner. he shakes his head slowly, thoughtfully. the ways of this planet are strange indeed.}
