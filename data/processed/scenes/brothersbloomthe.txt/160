<L>__{exterior park late afternoon}
<A>__{bloom walks pensively through a green park. cat stevens' "miles from nowhere" plays from a nearby radio. his eye catches something. a shiny red apple on a fruit seller's cart. he approaches it slowly, face flushed, breath shallow, eyeing the elderly vendor with a thin semblance of nonchalance. holy shit. he is going to steal that apple. deftly he passes, lifting and pocketing it just as the vendor turns away. bloom has done it. his pale face tightens. and turns. and sees a five year old boy. giving him a stare of infinite judgement. bloom turns on his heel and runs hell for leather. the vendor shouts. the little boy chases him, pointing and screaming. dogs bark. people stare. and bloom sprints, apple in hand, a joyful smile forming on his lips.}
