<L>__{exterior highway 70 day}
<A>__{the semi is in the slow lane. its right rear turn signal blinks steadily telling us that it is leaving the highway and going north at the intersection ahead.}
<L>__{interior half house day}
<A>__{jenny stirs awake under the windbreaker in the bedroom as a sloppy downshift jolts the house. her eyes flutter open and she looks around the room trying to figure out where she is. the truck leans into the turn. jenny braces herself on one arm and sits up. catching the windbreaker as it slips off her front, she remembers that she was shot and examines her right side. she runs her fingers over her cheek and neck, across her shoulder and down her side, feeling for traces of the wounds she knows she sustained. she has been completely healed and there are no scars. she leans forward and looks down the hallway.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{hello... hello.}
<A>__{the wind snapping the polyethylene is the only answer she gets. she picks her blouse off the floor next to her purse, but throws it aside and shrugs into the windbreaker when she sees the blood and bullet holes. her sudden rise to a standing position makes her light headed and she has to lean against the doorway until the spinning stops. with her hands outstretched, as guards against the sway of the truck, jenny shuffles down the hallway.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{hello. where are you?}
<A>__{there is no one in the kitchen and she continues into the living room. it is empty. jenny opens the door to an enclosed back porch. it is also empty. the star man is gone. she returns to the living room and stands there not really knowing what to do nexterior the countryside rushes by outside a floor to ceiling picture window. a wail from the semi's air horn jars jenny out of her reverie and she goes to press her cheek against the window. she is looking past her left hand at the road when she notices a wide green ring on her finger above her wedding band. she steps back from the window to examine it, then with some trepidation, twists it off. as it clears the end of her finger, the star man's voice speaks out of it.}
<C>__{star man }
<D>__{jennyhay...}
<A>__{jenny drops the ring as if she'd been stung. the star man's voice stops as soon as she does and the ring bounces across the floor until it hits the baseboard. it looks innocent enough lying there, but jenny has a great deal of trouble making herself approach it. when she finally picks it up, it does nothing. she turns it in her hand and when the side of the ring hole that was facing her when she took the ring off faces her again, the star man's voice continues.}
<C>__{star man }
<D>__{...nd. you are all fixed. i'm sorry you were shot. i was a big problem for you. thank you for your help. i can go to my ship alone now.}
