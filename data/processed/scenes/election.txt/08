<A>__{tracy is seated behind her card table strategically placed near the school's main entrance. a sign taped to the wall behind her reads, tracy for prez. sign up for tomorrow, today! she checks her watch, readies herself. jim walks around the corner whistling vaguely.}

<D>__{good morning, mr. mcallister.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{not wasting any time, are you, tracy?}

<C>__{jim}
<D>__{well, good luck there, tracy}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{thanks, mr. m.}
<A>__{as jim turns and walks away, tracy watches him. he stops and picks up some litter, tosses it in a nearby garbage can.}
<C>__{tracy }
<D>__{no matter what he says, mr. mcallister had it out for me from the start. oh sure, he was all smiles and good wishes and everything, but underneath he was just as unfair and petty as anybody else.}
