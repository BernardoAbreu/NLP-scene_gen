<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{b 16 neff's office (day) he is wearing a light grey suit and has his hat on. he is standing behind his desk opening some mail, taking a few papers out of his briefcase, checking something in his rate book, making a quick telephone call. but nothing of this is heard.}
<C>__{neff's voice}
<D>__{after that a full week went by and i didn't see her once. i tried to keep my mind off her and off the whole idea. i kept telling myself that maybe those fates they say watch over you had gotten together and broken his leg to give me a way out. then it was the fifteenth of june. you may remember that date, keyes. i do too, only for a very different reason. you came into my office around three in the afternoon...}
<A>__{keyes enters with some papers in his hand.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{hello, keyes.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{i just came from norton's office. the semi annual sales records are out. you're high man, walter. that's twice in a row. congratulations.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{thanks. how would you like a cheap drink?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{how would you like a fifty dollar cut in salary?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{how would i do i laugh now, or wait until it gets funny?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{i'm serious, walter. i've been talking to norton. there's too much stuff piling up on my desk. too much pressure on my nerves. i spend half the night walking up and down in my bed. i've got to have an assistant. i thought that you }
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{me? why pick on me?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{because i've got a crazy idea you might be good at the job.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{that's crazy all right. i'm a salesman.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{yeah. a peddler, a glad hander, a back slapper. you're too good to be a salesman.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{nobody's too good to be a salesman.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{phooey. all you guys do is ring door bells and dish out a smooth line of monkey talk. what's bothering you is that fifty buck cut, isn't it?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{that'd bother anybody.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{look, walter. the job i'm talking about takes brains and integrity. it takes more guts than there is in fifty salesman. it's the hottest job in the business.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{it's still a desk job. i don't want a desk job.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{a desk job. is that all you can see in it? just a hard chair to park your pants on from nine to five. just a pile of papers to shuffle around, and five sharp pencils and a scratch pad to make figures on, with maybe a little doodling on the side. that's not the way i see it, walter. to me a claims man is a surgeon, and that desk is an operating table, and those pencils are scalpels and bone chisels. and those papers are not just forms and statistics and claims for compensation. they're alive, they're packed with drama, with twisted hopes and crooked dreams. a claims man, walter, is a doctor and a blood hound and a cop and a judge and a jury and a father confessor, all in one.}
<A>__{the telephone rings on neff's desk. automatically keyes grabs the phone and answers.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{who? okay, hold the line.}
<A>__{he puts the phone down on the desk and continues to neff:}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{and you want to tell me you're not interested. you don't want to work with your brains. all you want to work with is your finger on a door bell. for a few bucks more a week. there's a dame on your phone.}
<A>__{neff picks the phone up and answers.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{walter neff speaking.}
<A>__{b 17 interior phone booth market phyllis is on the phone.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i had to call you, walter. it's terribly urgent. are you with somebody?}
<A>__{b 18 neff's office neff on the phone. his eye catches keyes', who is walking up and down.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{of course i am. can't i call you back... margie?}
<A>__{b 19 phyllis on phone}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{walter, i've only got a minute. it can't wait. listen. he's going tonight. on the train. are you listening, walter? walter!}
<A>__{b 20 neff on phone his eyes are on keyes. he speaks into the phone as calmly as possible.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i'm listening. only make it short... margie.}
<A>__{b 21 phyllis on phone}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{he's on crutches. the doctor says he can go if he's careful. the change will do him good. it's wonderful, walter. just the way you wanted it. only with the crutches it's ever so much better, isn't it?}
<A>__{b 22 neff's office neff on phone.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{one hundred percent better. hold the line a minute.}
<A>__{he covers the receiver with his hand and turns to keyes, who is now standing at the window.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{suppose i join you in your office, keyes }
<A>__{he makes a gesture as if expecting keyes to leave. keyes stays right where he is.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{i will wait. only tell margie not to take all day.}
<A>__{neff looks at keyes' back with a strained expression, then lifts the phone again.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<A>__{b 23 phyllis, on phone}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{it's the ten fifteen from glendale. i'm driving him. is it still that same dark street?}
<A>__{b 24 neff, on phone he is still watching keyes cautiously.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{yeah sure.}
<A>__{b 24a closeup phyllis on phone}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{the signal is three honks on the horn. is there anything else?}
<A>__{b 24b closeup neff, on phone}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{what color did you pick out?}
<A>__{b 25 phyllis, on phone}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{color?}
<P>__{(she catches on)}
<D>__{oh, sure. the blue suit, walter. navy blue. and the cast on his left leg.}
<A>__{b 26 neff, on phone}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{navy blue. i like that fine.}
<A>__{b 27 phyllis, on phone}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{this is it, walter. i'm shaking like a leaf. but it's straight down the line now for both of us. i love you, walter. goodbye.}
<A>__{b 28 neff's office neff on the phone.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{so long, margie.}
<A>__{he hangs up. his mouth is grim, but he forces a smile as keyes turns.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i'm sorry, keyes.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{what's the matter? the dames chasing you again? or still? or is it none of my business?}
<C>__{neff}
<P>__{(with a sour smile)}
<D>__{if i told you it was a customer }
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{margie! i bet she drinks from the bottle. why don't you settle down and get married, walter?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{why don't you, for instance?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{i almost did, once. a long time ago.}
<A>__{neff gets up from his desk.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{look, keyes, i've got a prospect to call on.}
<A>__{keyes drives right ahead.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{we even had the church all picked out, the dame and i. she had a white satin dress with flounces on it. and i was on my way to the jewelry store to buy the ring. then suddenly that little man in here started working on me.}
<A>__{he punches his stomach with his fist.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{so you went back and started investigating her. that it?}
<A>__{keyes nods slowly, a little sad and a little ashamed.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{and the stuff that came out. she'd been dyeing her hair ever since she was sixteen. and there was a manic depressive in her family, on her mother's side. and she already had one husband, a professional pool player in baltimore. and as for her brother }
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i get the general idea. she was a tramp from a long line of tramps.}
<A>__{he picks up some papers impatiently.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{all right, i'm going. what am i to say to norton? how about that job i want you for?}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i don't think i want it. thanks, keyes, just the same.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{fair enough. just get this: i picked you for the job, not because i think you're so darn smart, but because i thought maybe you were a shade less dumb than the rest of the outfit. i guess i was all wet. you're not smarter, walter. you're just a little taller.}
<A>__{he goes out. neff is alone. he watches the door close, then turns and goes slowly to the water cooler. he fills a paper cup and stands holding it. his thoughts are somewhere else. after a moment he absently throws the cupful of water into the receptacle under the cooler. he goes back to the desk. he takes his rate book out of his brief case and puts it on the desk. he buttons the top button of his shirt, and pulls his tie right. he leaves the office, with his briefcase under his arm.}
<C>__{neff's voice}
<D>__{that was it, keyes, and there was no use kidding myself any more. those fates i was talking about had only been stalling me off. now they had thrown the switch. the gears had meshed. the machinery had started to move and nothing could stop it. the time for thinking had all run out. from here on it was a question of following the time table, move by move, just as we had it rehearsed. i wanted my time all accounted for for the rest of the afternoon and up to the last possible moment in the evening. so i arranged to call on a prospect in pasadena about a public liability bond. when i left the office i put my rate book on the desk as if i had forgotten it. that was part of the alibi.}
