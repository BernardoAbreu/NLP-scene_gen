<L>__{exterior drew garage same night}
<B>__{establishing shot of old garage.}
<A>__{it is kind of spooky, and there are no lights on outside. there is candlelight inside, and it is moving around an effect not unlike a ghost carrying a candelabra.}
<L>__{interior drew garage same night}
<B>__{establishing shot of interior.}
<A>__{the area is dilapidated, but very clean, with all kinds of kung fu and chinese paraphenalia lying around. around the corner comes the spooky light, and (with music building to a crescendo), we see drew carson, a muscular 16 17 year old, bowls of flaming wax on his bare shoulders, moving through the garage, practicing his kung fu maneuvers. he is kicking, punching, etc., occasionally spilling hot wax on his skin (insert). in the background is a tv, and on it is showing a martial arts movie.}
<B>__{angle on kwan}
<A>__{who is quietly settling into a shadowy corner of the garage, watching drew.}
<B>__{angle on drew}
<A>__{as he continues to move around the workout area, his arms and body moving as he tries to match the movements on the tv. suddenly, kwan jumps out of the shadows, attacking. drew reacts instantly, evading the attack, the wax sloshing around in the bowls but not spilling (insert shot here). kwan continues the attack, and drew evades, their movements matching the movements on the tv almost move for move. it is a beautiful ballet, and drew ends it by sweeping kwan down to the ground. when kwan hits the ground, hard, his face is lit by the tv screen.}
<B>__{angle on drew}
<A>__{who, for the first time, sees that it is kwan.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{master kwan!}
<A>__{he hurries over to his master, a concerned look on his face. he leans down to help kwan up, forgetting about the bowls of hot wax. it pours down on kwan, scalding him, as well as running down drew's chest. kwan struggles to get up, while at the same time trying to wipe the hot wax off.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{master kwan! i'm sorry, very sorry!}
<C>__{kwan}
<P>__{(blustering)}
<D>__{i'm ok, never mind! what are you doing anyway?}
<B>__{drew}
<A>__{is taking the glued on cups of wax off his shoulders, while peeling the already hard wax off his chest.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{practicing. i saw it in this movie...}
<A>__{kwan shakes his head and walks over to drew, standing in front of him.}
<C>__{kwan}
<D>__{why didn't you come to class? why waste time with this... should study tapes of opponent.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i will still win. besides, the shaolin monks never had tapes to study... they did it this way... right?}
<C>__{kwan}
<D>__{not quite our drills at the temple had meaning. if we had tapes, we would have watched them.}
<A>__{drew starts to protest, but kwan doesn't even let him start.}
<C>__{kwan }
<D>__{"the warrior who knows himself and his opponent will win 100 times in 100 battles." study the tapes i gave you. all these years of one on one training you're the best i've ever taught.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{the best?}
<C>__{kwan}
<D>__{best white boy, maybe. just fight like a shaolin warrior the rest will take care of itself.}
<P>__{(picks up tape)}
<D>__{face reality, before it breaks your jaw!}
<A>__{drew holds out his hand for the tape, and kwan slaps it into his hand. drew smiles a defeated smile and turns toward the vcr, when drew's stepfather, bob, walks in. he is a big, overweight man, and he is very angry.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{are you screwing around with this stuff again?}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{look, bob, i'm not bothering you, am i?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{it's your attitude that bothers me, son.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{i'm not your son, bob. lay off.}
<A>__{it is a threat, one that bob almost takes up. kwan feels the tension in the room, and starts to say something.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(cutting him off)}
<D>__{don't say a word, yellow man.}
<B>__{reaction shot of kwan}
<A>__{closing his already opened mouth.}
<C>__{bob }
<D>__{you're here because i told your mom i'd see you were taken care of... after. at least respect my wishes, and make something of yourself... stop wasting your time!}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{when i'm the best fighter in the country, i'm not going to let you be part of my entourage...}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{you mean when you're in jail...}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{just leave me alone, bob, ok? i never asked for anything from you.}
<A>__{he spins and kicks one of the hanging bags, then walks out of the workout room, leaving bob and kwan standing alone. kwan looks at bob, who towers over him, and smiles sheepishly.}
<C>__{kwan}
<D>__{pressure. big tournament this weekend.}
<A>__{he starts to walk out, but bob follows him.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{how would you have liked having to take care of a kid you never really wanted... ?}
<C>__{kwan}
<D>__{i wish i had the chance...}
<A>__{kwan exits, and we...}
