<A>__{inman sits on his bed, wearing pants and a vest. his room is like a monk's cell. nothing in it. inman's trunk is packed. he's polishing his boots, in his bare feet. one hand inside the boot, the other blacking it. there's a knock at the door. he opens it. it's ada. he abruptly closes the door on her.}
<L>__{interior hallway, rooming house. cold mountain town. day}
<A>__{ada waits outside. she's not sure what's happening. then inman opens the door. he's buttoning his shirt. his boots are on, one conspicuously dirty, one highly polished. somebody walks up the stairs, carrying a jug and bowl. they separate as the man passes them. they're tender, awkward.}

<D>__{i found you this book. william bartram. they tell me it's good. i think he writes about these parts, the author, so...}
<A>__{inman takes it. she has something else. wrapped in paper.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{and this...}
<P>__{(hands it to him)}
<D>__{i'm not smiling in it. i don't know how to do that, hold a smile, so now i'm solemn...}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{ada...}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{he kisses her, pressing into her, his arm circling her waist. below them the sound of a marching band. it's the recruitment parade and brings rourke and butcher racing down the stairs. inman pulls away from ada as the boys hurtle for the front door.}

<D>__{let's go!}
