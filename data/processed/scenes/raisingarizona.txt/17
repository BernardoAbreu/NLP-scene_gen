<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{extreme close shot of hi's eyes}
<A>__{as they snap open. the screaming snaps off at the cut. the singing that the building scream covered, however, is now audible again. perspiration beads hi's forehead. he looks down toward the foot of the bed.}
<B>__{the bedroom}
<A>__{it is now morning. ed walks back and forth, gently bouncing the baby as she walks. she is singing it a lullaby. faintly, from the next room, we can hear gale and evelle snoring away like buzz saws.}
<C>__{hi}
<P>__{(groggily)}
<D>__{he all right?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{he's all right. he was just havin' a nightmare.}
<A>__{hi is getting out of bed.}
<C>__{hi}
<D>__{yeah, well...}
<A>__{he crosses to the bedroom window and cracks the venetian blind. orange light filters in.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{beyond a clothes line and a septic tank, a huge orange ball of sun is rising. we can almost hear the roar of its burning surface.}
<B>__{back to hi}
<A>__{looking.}
<C>__{hi}
<D>__{...sometimes it's a hard world for little things.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{the orange sun, rumbling, perceptibly rising.}
<B>__{arizona home front foyer}
<A>__{at the cut the rumble of the sun is snapped off by the high pitched ba weeeeeeee... of a strobe going off as a flash picture is taken: we are looking over nathan jr.'s shoulder as he stands at his open front door, facing a battery of press people who stand out on the porch. an obie light over a local tv news camera glares in at us; various flashbulbs pop.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{no, the missus and the rest of the kids've left town to i ain't sayin' where. they'll be back here when we're a nuclear fam'ly again.}

<C>__{nathan}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{now don't print that, son. if his mama reads that she's just gonna lose all hope.}
<A>__{a policeman from inside the house is taking nathan by the elbow.}
<C>__{policeman}
<D>__{we really have to ask you some more questions, sir...}
<A>__{as nathan allows himself to be led back into the house he calls back over his shoulder:}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{but remember, it's still business as usual at unpainted arizona, and if you can find lower prices anywhere my name still ain't nathan arizona!}
<A>__{we are following the two, hand held, as the police leads nathan toward the living room.}
<B>__{living room}
<A>__{the room is filled with policemen milling about in several different uniforms: local police, state troopers, plainclothes detectives. the original policeman is leading nathan to a table where a white smocked technician is preparing inkpad and exemplar sheets. the dialogue is urgent, rapid fire and overlapping.}
<C>__{policeman}
<D>__{mr. byrum here can take your exemplars while you talk.}
<A>__{mr. byrum has taken nathan's right hand and is rolling its fingers onto the inkpad.}
<C>__{byrum}
<D>__{just let your hand relax; i will do the work.}
<A>__{nathan jerks his hand away.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{what is this?! i didn't steal the damn kid!}

<D>__{fbi #1 ron, you're upsetting the victim.}
<A>__{nathan is getting worked up.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{damnit, are you boys gonna go chase down your leads or are you gonna sit drinkin' coffee in the one house in the state where i know my boy ain't at?! fbi #2 sir, there aren't any "leads" yet, aside from this coat }
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{gimme that!}
<A>__{he grabs the overcoat being displayed by fbi #2.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{that's a five hundred dollar camel's hair }
<C>__{byrum}
<D>__{sir, you might want to wash your hands at this pointerior}
<A>__{nathan realizes that he's gotten ink from his fingerprinting all over the coat.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{well goddamnit!}
<A>__{he is rising to his feet and hurling the coat to the floor.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{...no leads?!}
<A>__{he furiously kicks the coat.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{...everyone leaves microbes'n whatnot!}
<A>__{throughout the speech nathan stalks the room, working himself into a frenzy, furiously putting coffee cups onto coasters, generally cleaning up, hectoring the police, and swiping their feet off his furniture.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{...hell, that's your forte, trackin' down them microbes left by criminals'n commies'n shit! that's yer whole damn raison d'itre! no leads?! i want nathan jr. back, or whichever the hell one they took! he's out there somewhere! somethin' leads to him! and anyone can find him knows the difference between a lead and a hole in the ground!!}
<A>__{hole in the ground day specifically, it is the hole in the muddy patch of earth that gale and evelle climbed out of. we hear only the squish suck of many feet walking around in the mud offscreen. we are pulling back to reveal the feet the shiny black patent leather shoes and blue pants cuffs becoming quickly spattered of several policemen milling about the hole. german shepherds sniff around also. with a roar, motorcycle wheels enter frame. the bike's jackbooted rider casually tools around the hole once; police step back and dogs skitter away to give him room. he backs toward the camera and stops, standing astride the bike. the burning stub of a cheroot is dropped into frame; it hisses angrily and dies in the mud. we start to crane up. the whipcracking biker cue mixes up. the biker's motorcycle idles with a deep rumble, like the roar of fire on the sun. we are now framed looking over the biker's shoulder. the policemen's attitude to him seems to be deferential. one cop in front of him is pointing a direction. the biker is shaking his head; he doesn't think they went that way. suddenly, with a loud whipcrack effect, the biker's head snaps to profile. he is staring across the field, stock still, having heard, smelled or sensed something. the dogs milling around the hole also react, snapping to attention, a split second after the biker.}
<B>__{their pov}
<A>__{a jackrabbit is bounding away at the far end of the field.}
<B>__{the dogs}
<A>__{after a moment, their attention returns to the hole.}
<B>__{the biker}
<A>__{his attention also returns to the matter at hand. he squints, concentrating. his bike rumbles. gradually his face sets in a specific direction. we pan down to the tattoo on his shoulder: "mama didn't love me." his shoulder flexes once or twice as he revs the throttle; then he puts the bike in gear and it roars out of frame.}
<B>__{trailer kitchen close on gale and evelle}
<A>__{they are both intently munching cornflakes, staring at something offscreen. after a beat:}
<C>__{evelle}
<D>__{...awful good cereal flakes, miz mcdunnough.}
<B>__{their pov}
<A>__{ed is sitting in the living room, bottle feeding nathan jr. she is surrounded by the rumpled sheets and blankets used by the house guests. she does not respond to the ice breaker. gale puts his spoon down and picks up a cigarette which has been smoking in the ashtray next to him. there is a bead of milk dribbling down his chin. he takes a contemplative puff, studying ed.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{...whyncha breast feed him? you 'pear to be capable.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{mind your own bidnis.}
<A>__{through a mouthful of cornflakes:}
<C>__{evelle}
<D>__{ya don't breast feed him, he'll hate you for it later. that's why we wound up in prison.}
<A>__{gale blows out smoke and picks up his spoon to start back in on his cornflakes.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{anyway, that's what doc schwartz tells us.}
<A>__{hi is walking in, yawning.}
<C>__{hi}
<D>__{boys.}
<C>__{evelle}
<D>__{morni', h.i.}
<A>__{sharply, as hi sits and starts to pour cornflakes into a bowl:}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{...hi.}
<A>__{hi holds the cornflakes box arrested in mid air. he looks at ed, who is motioning to gale and evelle with her eyes.}
<C>__{hi}
<D>__{oh yeah... say boys, you wouldn't mind makin' yourself scarce for a couple hours this afternoon?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{we're havin' some decent friends over.}
<A>__{gale and evelle are looking dumbly from ed to hi.}
<C>__{hi}
<D>__{heh heh... what ed means to say is, seein' as you two boys are wanted, it wouldn't exactly do to have folks seein' you here i mean for your own protection.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{sure h.i.}
<C>__{evelle}
<D>__{anything you say.}
<A>__{more relaxed now, to ed:}
<C>__{hi}
<D>__{matter of fact honey, maybe i will skip this little get together myself, glen won't mind, and i will just duck out with the boys, knock back a couple of uh, co colas }
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{sure h.i.}
<C>__{evelle}
<D>__{we'd love to have ya.}
<B>__{close on ed}
<A>__{looking pleadingly at hi.}
<B>__{back to hi}
<A>__{feeling the look, he goes back to his cornflakes.}
<C>__{hi}
<D>__{...well... maybe that ain't such a hot idea either.}
<A>__{gale leans back to blow smoke at the ceiling.}
<C>__{gale}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{so many social engagements. so little time.}
<B>__{wide shot gas station bathroom}
<A>__{it is the bathroom where we earlier saw gale and evelle combing their hair, now empty. we are looking toward the door. the bathroom is quiet except for the dripping sink, and the faint rumble of an approaching motorcycle. it grows louder, then begins to recede as the bike shoots by the station. suddenly we hear the screech of the bike's brakes.}
