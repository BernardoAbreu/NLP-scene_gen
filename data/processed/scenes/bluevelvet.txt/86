<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{didn't my father tell you not to talk about it?}
<P>__{(she smiles)}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{come on. you brought it up. do you know anything?}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{i don't really know much but bits and pieces . i hear things. my room is right above my father's office. the ear. there's no corpse in the morgue missing an ear, and it did come off a living person. that's direct from the coroner's office. the person is unknown. there are a couple of cases i get mixed up on, but i think there are some people who were brought in for questioning on a murder case that could have something to do with the ear. i heard some of the same names.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{do you know who was brought in for questioning?}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{there were at least three, maybe four. but a name that keeps coming up is this woman who lives in an apartment building very close to your house and also close to the field where you found the ear. there's also a business man over by the franklin factory district that was questioned. and a musician. and some others.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{were all these people questioned this afternoon?}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{no. this has been going on for some time . several months. about six months ago some parts of bodies were found down by the river. they were from people who were reported missing. they never found one complete body. only parts.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{the ear is from a missing person maybe?}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{maybe so.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{it's a strange world isn't it? do you know what building the woman lives in?}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{yeah. it's close by. that's what's creepy. they've had her under surveillance for a couple of months, except i don't know what they've found out because my father isn't in charge of her.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{i guess you have to get back home soon?}
<C>__{sandy}
<D>__{not really, why?}
<P>__{(then she understands)}
<D>__{you want to see the building?. come on, i will show you.}
