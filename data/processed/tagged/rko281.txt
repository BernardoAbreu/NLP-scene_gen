<L>__{int large, dark room night}
<A>__{in the ebony shadows of a large room we can make out corners and edges, moldings and cornices; the phantoms of decaying victorian wealth floating like disembodied ghosts in the darkness. it is may 6, 1924 the harsh flare of a match being struck a shadowy male figure lights a series of nine candles on a birthday cake. beyond the cake we can see a bed. on the bed lies a woman in her early forties. she is ashen and sickly. dying. the shadowy male figure finishes lighting the candles, blows out the match and disappears as the woman peers into the darkness.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{come into the light.. come into the light}
<A>__{a nine year old boy steps into the light. she pulls him close and whispers:}
<C>__{woman}
<A>__{never stand in the shadows }
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{mother...}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{you are made for the light, orson now you must blow out your candles. but you must always remember, the cake itself is nothing. the flame, the lights, that is where your future lies. you must have a dream. a great dream worthy of you.}
<A>__{the boy immediately spins to the cake and blows out the candles. a moment of darkness. he turns back to the bed. the woman and the bed are gone, faded into darkness. the solemn young lad stares and stares into the darkness and then, magically, the faint glimmer of twinkling stars fill his huge dark eyes. newsreel the flickering images of an old newsreel, circa 1940 under the mgm logo we see the title: boy wonder wows hollywood! the first image after the title is the imposing figure of orson welles, climbing down from an airplane and surveying the world at his feet. welles is 24 years old and somewhat handsome. welles seems rather uncomfortable in his own body, as if it could not possibly contain his vast passions and appetites. orson welles is man who tears his way through life with incendiary energy. he is at once inspiring and ferocious; visionary and coldly ambitious. he is part artist, part fraud and all showman. a sonorous voice accompanies the newsreel. the voice is always grand, occasionally sardonic.}
<C>__{newsreel voice}
<D>__{he came to the town of magic and dreams a flashing star blazing through the firmament of illusion. and he promised to devour the world in a single gulp. he was 24 years old and his name was george orson welles. sound the trumpets! unfurl the banners, hollywood! the boy wonder has arrived!}
<A>__{images of welles as a baby and his early life fill the screen: welles in a crib; as a pampered schoolboy; at dance class; drama club; dressed up for a magic show. as we hear:}
<C>__{newsreel voice}
<D>__{he made his debut on the world stage in kenosha, wisconsin, on the 6th of may, 1915. and on the 7th of may he spoke his first words, and unlike other children who say commonplace things like "momma" and "poppa", he proclaimed "i am a genius!"}
<A>__{at three the genius was reciting shakespeare and at eight he had taken up cigars and highballs and was learning magic from the knee of the great houdini. images of welles' early theatrical career: the young man playing impossibly old parts; vaudeville magic shows; various regional theaters; endless tawdry rehearsal rooms then images of welles and john houseman in new york: the great, bustling city; welles at work with john houseman on a script; welles directing a play. as we hear:}
<C>__{newsreel voice}
<D>__{so how could the magic of the stage not call to this adventurous lad? unstoppable and resolute, the boy wonder journeyed into the world of the legit theater. after a peripatetic beginning he found himself at last in new york where he joined forces with theatrical producer john houseman under the august auspices of the wpa federal theater.}

<C>__{newsreel voice}

<D>__{though he wowed the critics with his spectaculars the ticket sales left something to be desired. so, after founding the mercury players with houseman, young mr. welles quickly set his sights on the airwaves. he quickly became the sonorous ' voice of "the shadow." ''}

<D>__{with lament cranston in one pocket and his own radio show. the mercury theater of the air, our boy wonder filled the night with his resounding tones. and on october 30th of 1938, he became what he felt destined to be: a household name.}
<A>__{what started out as a roguish halloween prank became the most famous radio show in the history of the galaxy! images of the war of the worlds broadcast and panic: listeners huddling next to their radios; telephone switchboards lighting up; new jersey state motorcycle troopers zooming down rural roads; cars clogging the highways. as we hear:}
<C>__{newsreel voice}
<D>__{the war of the worlds sent this nation spinning into a frenzy. nine million listeners clasped their loved ones close and looked to the skies with horror. unlucky listeners near the epicenter of the "invasion" rural new jersey ran screaming into the night, sure a monstrous alien and a fiery death awaited them around every corner! the mischievous boy wonder had fooled us all!}

<D>__{eyebrows raised and jaws dropped all over hollywoodland when the terms of the deal that lured the great orson came forth: the boy wonder could produce, write, direct and star in his own projects with budgets up to $500,000 a picture! he would have total control over the shooting of the picture and the finished product. the studio, well, they just paid the bills. meanwhile, the insiders of filmland were skeptical.}

<A>__{shots of welles with louella parsons and hedda hopper louella is a much feared gossip columnist. she is a gorgon in her 60's; margaret dumont possessed by the devil and tanked up on gin. her capricious cruelty is only matched by her fervent loyalty to all things hearstian. hedda is a gossip columnist in her 50's. she is given to elaborate hats and villainous intrigue. louella's younger, smarter rival, hedda probably spends her spare time eating children. then a snippet of an interview with louella:}

<A>__{an explosion of color and an immediate swirl of sound we are in the grand refectory the mammoth dining room at san simeon. five long tables are placed end to end. there are about fifty sumptuously dressed guests. william randolph hearst and marion davies preside, side by side, at the center table. hearst is 76 years old. he is a fully commanding figure, towering in both height (six foot two) and personality. he is shaped rather like a pear and moves with a delicacy surprising for such a famously merciless man. although the word ruthless does not begin to do justice to the press baron's animus, hearst is endlessly polite and almost painfully soft spoken. marion is 43 years old, a shimmering and lively presence. in a word that might have been coined for her, she has moxie. while the ravages of alcoholism have left their subtle marks on the edges and attitudes of her face, she can still charm and captivate with almost effortless grace. around hearst's feet sit a collection of his beloved dachshunds. on the other side of the main table, and down a bit, sit welles and mank. we sweep around the table, hearing bits of overlapping dialogue and finally settle on marion and hearst. marion is charming carole lombard and clark gable, who sit beside her. she tenderly rests one hand on hearst's arm as she speaks. marion speaks with an occasionally pronounced stutter.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{and we would hear them scuttling around at night with their little red eyes and little yellow t t teeth and i'm just imagining plague lice jumpin' all over the damn place so we set t t traps everywhere. and every morning we would find the t t traps sprung but no mice!}

<D>__{ across from me stood a mammoth bull reputed to have gored a full seven men to a grisly demise! so with manolete shouting encouragement i flourished . . . i flourished again . . . and the bull charged! across the golden dust it came, thundering like the great minotaur of legend, closer, ever closer, its calamitous hooves pounding into the dirt, shaking the earth as i held the crimson eye of the bull with my own, defying it it was almost upon me and i flourished one last time! the monster swept past! }
<P>__{(he spins his napkin in the air and his knife is now gone, a magic trick)}
<D>__{ and my sword was gone buried in the bloody eye of the beast!}
