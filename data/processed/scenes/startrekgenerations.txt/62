<L>__{interior observatory probe room continuous}
<A>__{a small room with several probes stacked in holding racks. geordi and data scan.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{i'm still not picking up anything. someone went to a lot of trouble to shield this room.}
<A>__{they put their tricorders away and begin looking around the room. data continues to snicker and giggle as he tries not to laugh at jokes his mind conjures up. geordi begins inspecting the probes... finally stops at one probe which has several odd devices attached to the side.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{data, take a look at this.}
<P>__{(data comes over)}
<D>__{you ever seen a solar probe with this kind of configuration?}
<A>__{data uses the tricorder as if it were a puppet as he opens and closes it like a mouth.}
<C>__{data}
<P>__{(making tricorder "talk")}
<D>__{no, geordi. i have not. it is most unusual.}
<A>__{data giggles and geordi reacts with the irritation of someone listening to a very bad comedian.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{just help me get this panel open.}
<A>__{data helps geordi as they try to open a panel on the casing of the probe. they open the panel and geordi looks inside.he reacts to something.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{whoa. my visor's picking up something in the theta band...it could be a trilithium signature.}
<A>__{data suddenly start laughing. geordi turns in irritation.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{data, this isn't the time...}
<C>__{data}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{i am sorry... but i cannot stop myself... i think something is wrong...}
<A>__{angle (vfx p) data's laughter escalates into hysteria... then data begins to jerk and shake and goes into a bizarre "emotional seizure." a rush of emotions race across his face. anger, passion, shock... a kaleidoscopic blur of reactions contort his features. then it stops and he falls to the ground.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{data!}
<A>__{geordi rushes to him. data has a look of surprise on his face as he blinks a few times. he sits up.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{data, are you all right?}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{i believe the emotional chip has overloaded my positronic relays.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{we better get you back to the ship.}
<P>__{(hits combadge)}
<D>__{la forge to enterprise.}
<A>__{there's no response. geordi frowns for a beat, then we hear soran's voice.}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{is there a problem, gentlemen?}
<B>__{include soran}
<A>__{standing in the room. geordi didn't hear him come in.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{oh... doctor... yeah, as a matter of fact, there is. there's a damping field in here blocking our com signal.}
<P>__{(re: data)}
<D>__{will you give me a hand?}
<A>__{over the above dialogue, soran glances over at the solar probe geordi was inspecting. he notes the opened panel and a disturbed look crosses his face. soran looks back at geordi.}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{i'd be happy to.}
<A>__{soran moves toward them. and then without warning, he punches geordi in the face, knocking the visor across the room. he whirls around and points a phaser at data, who suddenly looks fearful.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{please don't hurt me.}
