<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{a christmas card from the nixons, they are standing in front of the white house christmas tree. it is signed "to hugh and debbie sloan, with thanks, richard m. nixon, patricia nixon."}
<B>__{pull back}
<A>__{and we're in the living room. more coffee is being drunk; sloan endlessly stirs his.}
<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{i'd like to talk to you, i really would, but my lawyers say i shouldn't until after the watergate trial.}
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{you handed out the money. maybe there's a legitimate explanation for the way it was done }
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{ then again, maybe things are even worse than we've written }
<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{ they're worse. that's why i quit.}
<A>__{woodward and bernstein wait as sloan is clearly going through a struggle with himself. then }
<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{try and understand this. i'm a decent republican. i believe in richard nixon. i worked in the white house four years so did my wife. what happened on june 17 i don't think the president knew anything about. some of his men i'm not so sure of.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{do you think the truth will come out at the trial?}
<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{that's another of the things i'm not so sure of.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{because people at the committee were told to lie to the prosecutors?}
<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{we were never told flat out "don't talk." but the message was clear.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{to cover up?}
<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{well, they sure didn't ask us to come forward and tell the truth.}
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{does "they" mean the white house?}
<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{as opposed to the committee? the committee's not an independent operation. everything is cleared with the white house. i don't think that the fbi or the prosecutors understand that.}
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{the report on the cash in maurice stans' safe, the three hundred fifty thousand, that's true?}
<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{no. it was closer to seven hundred thousand.}
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{and as treasurer, you could release those funds?}
<C>__{sloan}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{when so ordered.}
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{we're not sure we've got all the guys who could order you, but we know there were five.}
<P>__{(sloan is silent)}
<C>__{bernstein}
<P>__{(ticking them off)}
<D>__{mitchell, stans, magruder, they're obvious }
<A>__{sloan stirs his coffee.}
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{ there had to be a white house overseer }
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{ colson.}
<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that.}
<C>__{woodward}
<P>__{(to bernstein)}
<D>__{haldeman.}
<P>__{(to sloan)}
<D>__{right?}
<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{i won't talk about the other two.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{but they both worked at the white house?}
<C>__{sloan}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{i will not talk about the other two.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<P>__{(out of the blue)}
<D>__{kalmbach nixon's personal lawyer.}
<A>__{sloan is shocked at the mention of kalmbach.}
<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{i can't say anything, i'm sorry.}
<P>__{(he starts to rise)}
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{one thing i'm not completely clear on when you gave out the money to liddy, how did that work?}
<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{badly.}
<P>__{(and now for the first time, he almost smiles)}
<D>__{you don't realize how close all this came to staying undiscovered i gave liddy the dahlberg check and he gave it to barker who took it to miami and deposited it.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{then barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to liddy who gave it back to me and i put it in the office safe which was crammed.}
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{well, when liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break in funds, i went to the safe and gave him out of this whole fortune i happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me banks have to keep track of hundreds. if the money had been in fifties, or if i'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been any watergate story.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?}
<C>__{sloan}
<D>__{routine i'd just call john mitchell over at the justice department and he'd say "go ahead, give out the money."}
<A>__{woodward and bernstein just look at each other they hadn't known it, not remotely. sloan stands and as they head for the door }
