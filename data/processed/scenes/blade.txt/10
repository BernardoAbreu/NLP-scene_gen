<B>__{close on blade}
<A>__{a gaze as cold and pitiless as a midnight sun. the vampire club goers stare back. nuclear silence. and then all hell breaks loose. with a snarl, raquel charges at blade, moving at superhuman speed, practically a blur blade draws his casulls, fires in multiple directions }
<B>__{macro bullet shot}
<A>__{as a round roars through the air towards raquel. a silver tipped dum dum bullet which explodes on contact. wham! the round punches a fist sized hole through raquel's chest, continuing on into the vamp behind her! vampire blood fountains. both creatures tumble forward, their bodies liquefying into puddles of black oil which go gurgling down the run off drains. blade continues firing, then click! magazines empty. nexterior he holsters the casulls, swings up his assault rifle, calmly flicks on the uv entry light mounted above }
<B>__{mercury}
<A>__{leaps twenty feet straight up into the air. we've never seen anything move so fast. she crashes through a glass skylight, disappearing into the night just as a shaft of blinding uv "sunlight" cuts across the vampires. they rear back, skin smoking from the light's corrosive effects. blade opens fire, pumping round after round of wooden fragmentation bullets into the crowd vampire genocide. the strobe lights flicker as the mayhem mounts. some of the vampires try to flee, scurrying up the stairs, but the exit quickly becomes clogged with liquefying bodies then blade's car 15 jams. the remaining club goers see their opening, surge forward en masse blade drops the rifle, reaches over his shoulder and schinggg! unsheathes his sword with a double handed grip.}
<B>__{the sword}
<A>__{four acid etched feet of blood soaked damascus steel. an edge so sharp it could cleave a shadow in two. blade moves like lightning, hacking his way into two charging vampires. blade spins again, cuts another vampire clean in half on the far end of the club, a latex clad vamp makes a break for it. blade flings his sword, sending it spinning end over end thunk! the sword punches into the vampire's heart. the hellish creature convulses, dies. beat. blade retrieves his sword, then senses }
<B>__{something big}
<A>__{rising up behind him. in a flash, blade swings his sword downward, cutting off the vampire's right hand at the elbow. the severed limb falls to the floor but it doesn't slow the hulking creature down. it slams into blade. blade flies backwards thirty feet, tumbling over tables, slamming into the rear wall so hard that plaster rains down from the ceiling. blade suddenly finds himself wrestling with a feral faced six foot something nightmare named quinn. the vampire rears back its head, jaws stretching wide. every inch of his face is covered with ritual scarification patterns and maori like tribal tattoos. blade forces an elbow against quinn's throat, trying to keep him at bay. with his other hand he reaches to his bandoleer, pulls out a stake crunch! blade shoves the stake through the vampire's larynx. quinn gurgles, clutches at his throat. blade rolls out from under, unholsters the cross bow secured to his leg. with a flick of a switch the arms of the bow snap! open, drawing the bow string taut. blade fires the bolt hits quinn in the shoulder, throwing him backwards and nailing him to the wall. as quinn reaches over with his other hand to pull out the stake blade fires again. a second bolt slams into quinn's other arm, effectively pinning him like a butterfly to a board. up above, mounted in one of the corners, is a security camera. blade fires a cross bow bolt straight into the lens. blade strides over, placing his sword against quinn's chest.}

<A>__{blade shoves the grenade in quinn's mouth, pulls the pin. whoosh! quinn goes up like a roman candle. blade turns, surveying his work, ignoring the howling pyre behind him: all evidence of the vampires is gone with the exception of a few oily black puddles. clothes, jewelry it's all been burned away by the acidic process of the creatures' accelerated decomposition. dennis sits huddled in a corner, having pissed his pants. as blade approaches, he cringes back }
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{please don't }
<A>__{blade simply grabs dennis by the jaw, tilting his head upward, rotating it from side to side looking for bite marks. there aren't any. blade moves on, leaving dennis alone amidst the carnage. as blade starts up the stairs, he pauses in mid step }
