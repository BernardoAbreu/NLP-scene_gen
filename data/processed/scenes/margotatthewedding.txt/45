<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{margot enters and opens the refrigerator. she gets out a white wine bottle. she turns around and jumps, startled.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{woa!}
<A>__{malcolm sits at the table, eating saltines out of the box, a pad and paper in front of him.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{hey, sorry. i'm here.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{no, i... i should've looked.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i'm just writing my vows. trying to do something appropriate but also funny not jokey, more character based humor.}
<A>__{margot pours herself a glass of wine. she looks to malcolm to see if he wants some. he shakes his head. she takes a long drink. silence.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you having an okay time?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{oh, yeah. besides wizard getting }
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{yeah, we'll...we'll find him...or else, i don't know...}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{we won't.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{right, or else he's dead or something.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{it means a lot to paul that you came.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{silence. malcolm mumbles a tune.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{oh god, this is the same toaster we had here as kids. paul is so weird.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i hear you've heard the news.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{yeah. congratulations.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{pretty cool. hard to fully take in. it's a little abstract still. i haven't had that thing yet where you realize that you're not the most important person in the world. i'm anxious for that to happen. i guess i have to thank you i wouldn't know yet if you hadn't arrived.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{of course i can't help but worry i will pass some not so great genes onto the kid. i mean, in my family there's a lot of hand washing, you know. i don't have it, but my brother does.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you working on anything now?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{besides the thing with dick?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{oh, right.}
<A>__{he nods. she nods. silence.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{how about you?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{oh, i'm working on some acrylic paint }
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{nobody fills the ice cube trays.}
<A>__{malcolm stops, immediately embarrassed. margot is looking in the freezer. she takes out the trays and brings them to the sink. she runs the water.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{sorry, what were you }
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{nothing. it doesn't matter.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{no, what were you saying?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{it really... nothing.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{she treads back to the refrigerator, balancing the full trays.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i was saying i'm doing these abstractions in acrylic painterior but it's not... i'm not getting paid or anything. i don't know, i hate that question, "what do you do?"}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{you asked me.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i know, but...}
<A>__{malcolm exhales in frustration.}
