<L>__{interior delta airplane}
<A>__{another angle, on the pretty young stewardess as she brings two more drinks. dave stares sourly at her, wholly unmoved by her charm.}
<C>__{dave wilkie}
<D>__{took your time gettin' here.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{she has other things to do, dave.}
<A>__{willcox smiles apologetically at girl.}
<C>__{dave wilkie}
<D>__{supposed to get two drinks in the first place. this friggin' airline can't do nothin' right.}
<A>__{the stewardess purses her lips at dave, who is bowed over his drink busy opening it. hillyer lifts an eyebrow at the girl as if to say, "don't blame me because of this damned idiot," and she half smiles at him.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<P>__{(obviously getting him off subject)}
<D>__{tell me about that job in alexandria, dave, the big motel you're building.}
<C>__{dave wilkie}
<P>__{(with pedantic exactitude,}
<D>__{the man is a complete}
<P>__{pain in the ass)}
<D>__{near alexandria. it isn't in alexandria, it is outside it.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{i see. outside it.}
<C>__{dave wilkie}
<D>__{that's correct outside it, not in it. as for the job, well, the jewboy suppliers give me a lot of grief and we use a pile of niggers to haul and tote and they ain't worth a sorry ass damn.}
<P>__{(takes big swallow of drink)}
<D>__{but i can build anything, buddy. give me the plans and i can build a goddamn staircase to the moon. it's a fact, i can build anything...}
<P>__{(pauses, then bitterly)}
<D>__{... but she never believed that. oh, hell, no, she never believed in me.}
<A>__{this is another pointed bitter reference to the unknown "she." once again, willcox hillyer is deliberately unresponsive.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{um m, well...}
<C>__{dave wilkie}
<P>__{(broodingly)}
<D>__{doubted my ability all along, the little bitch. i never remarried, buddy, you know that, don't you?}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{well, no, i didn't actually.}
<C>__{dave wilkie}
<D>__{she's te reason cured me of women once and for all. oh, i got rid of her, buddy, i didn't waste no time kickin' that bitch out. hell, she was screwin' everybody in savannah. i caught her in a motel with this long tall son of a bitch and boy did i beat the everlastin' piss out of him!}
<A>__{dave wilkie's eyes narrow with vindictive anger as he says it and one can well believe the streak of raw violence in the man. it is frightening even now; he is a clown, but he is a dangerous clown. as his long, bitter, impassioned tirade continues, willcox hillyer becomes increasingly tense and pale it is obvious he detests what the man is saying and he is struggling to control himself. dave's tone and voice are laconically southern, but the hatred and misery in his eyes are raw.}
<C>__{dave wilkie }
<D>__{she didn't marry him, though, later she married another guy and went to winston salem. it didn't last that girl couldn't have no lastin' marriage, she left him and married another dumb sucker and went out west. little bitch left him, too, and you know what she's married to right now?}
<P>__{(puts a big finger on hillyer's chest)}
<D>__{a kike. that's right, some kind of kike horse doctor named schapiro out in seattle, who's got the nerve to have the same first name i got. wouldn't you know it, rose would wind up married to a goddamn kike? she was always out of her friggin' head and i will tell you why.}
<P>__{(his eyes narrow and again}
<D>__{he puts a finger on}
<P>__{hillyer's chest)}
<D>__{buddy, she was sick in her mind and between her legs, too. she was a nymphomaniac.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<P>__{(he has had enough; with a}
<D>__{pale trembling anger and}
<P>__{in even tone)}
<D>__{dave, you are as full of shit as a christmas turkey and you know it. now if you want to start a fight on this plane and get yourself in jail, go right ahead. but i am telling you, you are full of shit right up to your eyeballs.}
<C>__{dave wilkie}
<P>__{(with surprising mildness;}
<D>__{a little smile almost as}
<P>__{if he is pleased)}
<D>__{i don't want to start no fight with you, buddy. why do you say i'm full of shit?}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{dave schapiro is no horse doctor and rose has been a good wife to him for a long time. to call her a nymphomaniac is the most stupid thing i ever heard in my life.}
<C>__{dave wilkie}
<P>__{(again surprisingly mild)}
<D>__{you loved her, didn't you. well, so did i.}
<P>__{(a little shrug)}
<D>__{you'll have to admit she had four husbands.}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<D>__{yeah, it took her a while to grow up and find mr. right, but she did it. she found him.}
<C>__{dave wilkie}
<P>__{(another little smile)}
<D>__{she used to call me mr. right. remember that, buddy?}
<C>__{willcox hillyer}
<P>__{(he is pale with anger)}
<D>__{yeah, i remember it.}
<A>__{willcox picks up galley sheets, half turns away.}
<C>__{dave wilkie}
<D>__{well, i tell you, i don't know what the world's come to these days. things used to be better. we didn't have any money, but things were better.}
<P>__{(grimaces in anger)}
<D>__{goddamn niggers and kikes burning the flag, rioting, raising hell they ought to shoot their asses off. i tell you, buddy, where this country made its mistake was allowing people without property to vote.}
<A>__{during this speech, willcox hillyer grits his teeth but says nothing. he keeps his eyes down on the galley sheets. as dave shakes his head in sorrow at the state of the nation ..}
