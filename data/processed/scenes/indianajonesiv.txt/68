<A>__{close up a snoring pirate camera pulls back. all of the pirates sleep. their slumbering bodies lie in various positions, throughout the cave. indiana and kezure are still awake. the flickering orange light of the torches illuminates the wall in front of them. they await the lowering tide. scraggy, betsy and clare sleep on the ground beside them. kezure pours two glasses of whiskey from a stone bottle. he gives a glass to indiana. kezure toasts.}
<C>__{kezure}
<D>__{to my good fortune.}
<A>__{kezure gobbles down the whiskey. indiana reluctantly drinks. kezure pours two more glasses. laughing.}
<C>__{kezure}
<D>__{you know... we are very much alike, doctor jones.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{i doubt that.}
<C>__{kezure}
<D>__{we both share a remarkable talent for killing.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{i've never gotten used to killing, pal. i do it for survival.}
<C>__{kezure}
<D>__{i do it for pleasure.}
<A>__{indiana downs his whiskey. a laughing kezure does the same. indiana notices something. on the wall. he jumps to his feet. camera pans to the wall. the tide is very low. the entire wall is now visible. what were once simple cracks, have become the specific lines of a map. a group of arrows leads to an "x" at the bottom corner of the map. a fascinated kezure and indiana study the wall.}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(astounded)}
<D>__{this is incredible...this map was obviously used by sun wu kung's disciples...if they were ever lost...}
<C>__{kezure}
<D>__{these drawings...they are of the surrounding jungle...}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(points to "x")}
<D>__{where is that?...}
<C>__{kezure}
<D>__{it is located at the most south eastern part of the jungle...near the mountains... there is a village there. the mongooboo tribe.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{you know them?}
<C>__{kezure}
<D>__{very well. i traded with the chief for many years.}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(anxious, excited)}
<D>__{good. we'll leave in the morning.}
<A>__{camera pans from indiana and kezure, to a dark cave. a few feet away. standing inside, is the figure of the mysterious crew member. the traitor. his face is hidden in the shadows. again, he radios back to nazis. he whispers in german. camera dollies into a close up of his radio microphone. a red swastika adorns the microphone.}
