<A>__{charles sits at his desk. he is twisting pencils in a small plastic sharpener. (intercut conversation.)}

<C>__{charles}
<D>__{the thing is... i started thinking.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{you know that's never a good thing charles.}
<A>__{amy looks at the puzzle box on the table. it seems to be reflecting the snow of the tv set in some strange form. she looks closer, it's an abstract image of a little girl screaming. she compares it to the tv set, it shows only white static snow.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{look. i know the crazy stuff you do for a story.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{that's what i get paid for.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{and that's why i hired you. it's just. just... the thing is, amy... some things you shouldn't do, you know what i mean?}
<A>__{charles finishes a pencil and blows off the shavings.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{look, i say this to you, but in my heart i know that one time it's going to happen... that you're going to end up, i don't know dead or god knows what. but when it does happen, i don't want it to be my fault.}
<A>__{she watches the image of the little girl fade.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{okay, charles. i will make sure it won't be.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{you know, you're messing with my conscience, here. amy...}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{charles, i can't do the sensitive thing. i don't know how. i get the message. i knew the message before i got it. okay, mommy? you've had a change of heart? you want me to come home? well i can't. not until i know the truth. so there. you're off the hook. i gotta go.}
