<A>__{helicopters zoom over the makeshift stage like the uso show in apocalypse now. groups of soldiers cheer as a helicopter approaches the landing platform and touches down. the us army men cheer. the mothers take the stage, and kyle's mother speaks into the microphone. behind her is a huge american flag. she is wearing an army helmet. this is right out of 'patton'.}
<C>__{kyle's mother}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen of the american war effort, we salute you!}
<A>__{a big cheer goes through the crowd. kyle's mother feels the power, and lifts her head high. she starts to pace back and forth on the stage as she speaks, becoming more and more pattonlike.}
