<L>__{interior sheeni's dorm room night}
<A>__{nick enters the dark room to the sound of the bed squeaking. vijay and taggarty grunt away on the top bunk. he watches the moon lit forms thumping together. he turns his attention to the sleeping beauty on the bottom bunk. he moves toward her. she blinks, waking and smiles at the sight of him.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{sheeni?}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{yes, darling.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{was trent here?}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{yes, nick.}
<A>__{nick hangs his head.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{but i sent him away again.}
<A>__{nick stares into her eyes to discern her honesty, but he finds nothing but adoration.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{because i want you, darling. not even trent can match the industriousness and tenacity with which you have pursued me.}
<A>__{she smiles. nick smiles too. she reaches out to pull him into her bed as... the door to the room slams open and they are suddenly backlit by the harsh beam of the matron's flashlight.}
<C>__{matron}
<D>__{q'est que c'est passer ici?!?}
<A>__{nick bolts upright, smacking his head against the top bunk. he lands on the floor, where he gets a view of... trent standing behind the matron. the blinding light makes his features difficult to make out but his white teeth are definitely smiling diabolically.}
