<A>__{amy comes unsteadily down out of her hotel.}
<L>__{exterior dark street night}
<A>__{more shadows than light. she comes around a corner and onto a narrow street, moving fast, her feet making loud echoey clip clops on the street. there's a bum, dressed in rags, leaning up against the wall of a building. as she approaches him, he stirs slightly. then she looks more closely. the man is eating something very crunchy. he stares at her blankly as he picks crickets off the wall and devours them, one by one. he offers her one, and smiles. amy leaps back, turns and runs. some distance down the street, there seems to be a flicker of light, a trace of noise. she scrambles toward it. it's coming up from a subway grate. she throws herself down on it. down below she can hear the roar of a subway train passing below. indirect, flickering light shines up from below. she looks up. there's a subway entrance. she hurries toward it.}
