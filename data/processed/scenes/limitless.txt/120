<L>__{interior charlie's coffee shop day}
<A>__{eddie, limping, enters, looking around anxiously.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{what was i dealing with? who could tell me? i hoped against hope... that melissa would show.}
<A>__{eddie's pov scanning the place not one person in it could possibly be melissa. eddie sighs. turns to go.}
<C>__{female voice }
<D>__{eddie...?}
<A>__{eddie turns back. there, sitting at a booth, is a thick waisted, short haired brunette middle aged woman, wearing a large, shapeless sweater. eddie had looked right at her... and not recognized her. she bears no relationship to the siren melissa of his memories. eddie tries to hide the shock on his face.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{melissa...?}
<A>__{he goes to her, sits. yes, it's the same person, but dramatically, tragically changed. her face is puffy, her pallor blotchy. there are lines under her eyes and around her mouth, lines brought on by more than the passage of a few years. eddie tries to conceal his shock.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{you... how are you doing?}
<A>__{melissa responds with a cynical shrug. then, she eyes him.}
<C>__{melissa}
<D>__{don't tell me i look good, because i know i don't. i didn't want you to see me this way...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you look good.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i guess i lost some weight...}
<C>__{melissa}
<D>__{yeah, well, mdt'll do that to you.}
<A>__{they regard each other for minute, unsure of where to start. old emotions. new emotions. shock. dismay. affection.}
<C>__{melissa }
<D>__{i know you've been doing it. i just read the post. eddie. short selling stocks? second guessing the markets? you? come on.}
<A>__{eddie doesn't know what to say.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{since when do you read the post?}
<C>__{melissa}
<D>__{these days, the post's about all i can read.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{melissa, what do you mean?}
<C>__{melissa}
<D>__{i mean, i did it too. and i only took nine or ten hits. vernon didn't tell you any of this, did he?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{melissa snorts as if to say, typical.}
<C>__{melissa}
<D>__{well, when he told me about this amazing new drug...}
<C>__{melissa }
<D>__{i was like, down the hatch. and it was amazing. i read brian greene's the elegant universe in 45 minutes and understood it. my work rate increased... just, insanely, overnight. my boss started to hate me they offered me his job. and then i got scared.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{melissa}
<D>__{i'm not stupid. i mean, nobody can keep up that level of mental activity and not crash. i stopped taking it.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{and...?}
<C>__{melissa}
<D>__{i got sick. headaches, throwing up... i went back to vernon to see if i maybe shouldn't take another hit, or half a hit, and then he told me about... about the people who were dying. one guy didn't die, but he's a vegetable, his mother has to sponge him down every day...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{how much have you been taking, eddie?}
<A>__{a long beat as they look into each other's eyes.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{a lot.}
<C>__{melissa}
<D>__{well, maybe they've worked out the bugs. maybe... maybe this isn't the same batch...}
<A>__{eddie hates the look in her eyes. his hands are at his temples.}
<C>__{melissa }
<D>__{you're off it right now, aren't you?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{melissa}
<D>__{are you getting a headache?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{finish your story.}
<C>__{melissa}
<D>__{well, i didn't take more. and i didn't die. but after a while i found i couldn't concentrate on anything for longer than ten minutes. i missed deadlines. i got lazy... and slow... put on weight... the magazine let me go. my husband checked out. sex? get out of here.}
<A>__{she leans back, looks him in the eyes.}
<C>__{melissa }
<D>__{that was two years ago, and i haven't been the same since. i can't read any more i mean, the fucking new york post?}
<A>__{eddie feels ill, physically ill, hearing this.}
<C>__{melissa }
<D>__{after this, i'm going to have a migraine for three days. and i've got to pee. which is another thing.}
<A>__{she gets up... goes to the ladies room. and now eddie sees she wears a leg brace. like a kid, from the old days, with polio.}
<C>__{eddie }
<D>__{how many times had i thought of her, my first real love...}
<A>__{we see flashes of young melissa...}
<D>__{eddie (v.0.) (cont'd) but that melissa had unraveled in time and space she was a ghost now. i was never going to see her again, never bump into her in the street...}
<A>__{the tears gather behind eddie's eyes. he can't help it. he puts his hand to his face to hide his emotions.}
