<A>__{the girls' frowns are a great contrast to their husbands' smiles. wilma's looking at the school enrollment forms. betty paces, looks at the clock.}
<C>__{wilma}
<P>__{(seeing this)}
<D>__{it's not like the boys to be so late.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{unless they were forced to go bowling again. remember that time a burglar pointed a gun at them and said, 'go bowling right now'?}
<C>__{wilma}
<D>__{betty, sometimes you're a little too gullible }
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{don't tell me. i still can't believe what i did today...}
<C>__{wilma}
<D>__{no kidding.}
<P>__{(indicating the forms)}
<D>__{do you have any idea of what the enrollment fee is? and get this... it's non refundable }
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i know, i know! i just couldn't stand that woman's attitude! but we had to find a new school anyway, and there we were... the next thing i knew, i was in over my head... but why did you jump in, too?}
<C>__{wilma}
<D>__{oh, she was getting to me too with all that mastodon snort about her little nephew... and...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{and?}
<C>__{wilma}
<D>__{and... if a friend can't help you do something stupid, who can?}
<A>__{betty smiles, touched. then reality intrudes again.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{what do we tell the boys?}
<C>__{wilma}
<D>__{what's wrong with the truth?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{we put ourselves in debt so the kids can attend school with a family we can't stand?}
<C>__{wilma}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{maybe we could rephrase it...}
<A>__{suddenly the door bursts open. fred and barney run in with candy and flowers.}
<C>__{fred and barney}
<D>__{surprise!}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{flowers?}
<C>__{wilma}
<D>__{rock candy? that's nice, but... why?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{why? oh, me and barn, we suddenly realized that we had a little spare change.}
<C>__{wilma}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{not anymore you don't...}
<C>__{barney}
<P>__{(presenting flowers)}
<D>__{betty, these are for you. for sticking beside me during the tough times, and well... for making a little guy feel like he was ten feet tall.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{aw, barney... i... i don't deserve these. i did something really stupid today.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{hey. fred does something stupid every day and i still love him.}
<A>__{fred laughs good naturedly, grabs barney in a headlock.}

<C>__{fred}
<D>__{ready when you are.}
<P>__{(noticing the label)}
<D>__{hey, '1'... a good year.}
<A>__{this confuses the girls even more.}
<C>__{wilma}
<D>__{fred, there's no easy way to say this so }
<A>__{she closes her eyes, swings the enrollment forms over on the table so that fred and barney can read them. fred and barney look at them, look at each other... and yawn.}
<B>__{favoring wilma and betty}
<A>__{they can't believe this.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{boys... did you see... the dollar signs there at the bottom?}
<C>__{wilma}
<D>__{the non refundable dollar signs?}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{plenty more where that came from.}

<C>__{wilma}
<D>__{betty... these... these look... real }

<C>__{fred}
