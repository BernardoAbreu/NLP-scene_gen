<D>__{let's see what my man put together.}
<A>__{xander opens a dash panel, revealing a row of switches. he flips one. the headlights eject, revealing a mini gun in each fender. brrraaaaaappp!! the mini guns spin. the metal doors are getting shredded. empty shells spill down the sides of the gto. the metal doors come apart, falling in chunks. the gto slams through the wreckage without slowing down. a guard comes tumbling down and bounces off the trunk as the gto zips inside.}
