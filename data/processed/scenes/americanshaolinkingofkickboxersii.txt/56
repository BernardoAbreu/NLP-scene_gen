<D>__{back up and let me pass.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{no chance, gao. you back up.}
<A>__{gao smiles and shakes his head. gao starts forward, and whacks drew in the leg with a leg sweep. drew tries to keep his balance, and fights a valient, but losing battle. he falls over the side, the dirt in his buckets flying everywhere. gao wipes his hands off and continues walking. closeup on drew's bloody hand a huge splinter sticking out of it. he is in real pain. the d.s. walks over and looks at the splinter, and in one move pulls it out.}
