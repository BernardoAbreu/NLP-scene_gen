<A>__{carl looks above to see the house's momentum pulling forward.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{hang on to kevin!}
<A>__{carl grabs onto kevin and picks dug up by the collar. just as the dogs reach our gang, the house's momentum carries them across the chasm. alpha bites the bird on the leg but is kicked loose and falls into the river below. carl lands hard but safely across the river chasm. the dogs are stuck on the other side. carl painfully gets up. he looks up at his house. it's still intact. he breathes a sigh of relief.}
<C>__{russell }
<D>__{kevin!}
<A>__{the bird tries to stand but squawks pitifully and falls back to the ground. russell rushes to her side. the bird's leg has been injured badly by the dog bite. she can't stand. russell applies a bandage. from the distant labyrinth of rocks, the bird babies call. kevin calls back to them. she tries to stand, but can't. russell runs to her side.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{no no no! kevin! stay down.}
<P>__{(to carl)}
<D>__{she's hurt real bad. can't we help her get home?}
<A>__{carl looks at the bird's wounds. he looks to the rock maze, then to his house. he knows the right thing to do. and he hates himself for it.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{alright. but we've got to hurry.}
