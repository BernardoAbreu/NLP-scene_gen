<A>__{the jolt shoots west off the girder. he free falls through the belly and out into the open air. thinking quickly, he grabs onto the back of loveless' wheel chair. his arms nearly torn from their sockets. his weight causes the wheelchair to shift, now leaving it hanging on by a thread. west reaches out, grabs the wheel of the chair and hangs there.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{well, i will be a monkey's uncle. how did we arrive in this dark situation?}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{i don't know. guess i'm stumped!}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{and i'm so cotton pickin' afraid of heights. they just give me the spooks!}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{ah, don't be afraid, loveless. with this being the last leg of our journey and all, you should soak in the view, you're really missing something.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{mister west, i'm gonna cut this conversation short...}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{good one, loveless. i didn't think of that one.}
<C>__{loveless}
<P>__{(furious)}
<D>__{mister west!!! i am faced with a difficult decision here. on one hand, there is the overwhelming love that i have for myself, and on the other, the raw, seething hatred i have for you! now, i could kill you very easily, just by pulling this lever...}
<A>__{he moves the joystick. the chair jerks back.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{but, of course, i would die along with you. i guess the only thing that i can take comfort in is the hope that you would hit those rocks a second before me and i could enjoy immeasurable bliss before i vanish.}
<P>__{(moving joystick back and forth)}
<D>__{what to do, what to do...}
<A>__{west grabs the joystick.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{allow me to make that decision easy on you, loveless. because i want to see you dead a hell of a lot more than i want to live.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{why is it that i have a sneaking suspicion, that although you are as black as the night on the outside... inside, you are yellow?!}
<A>__{they lock eyes. a beat.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{you don't have it in you, do you... boy?!}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{you were right. let's cut this conversation short!}
<A>__{west yanks the joystick back. angle loveless his eyes widen. the wheels spin for a second, finally catch, and in a flash, loveless and west free fall into space.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{weeeeeeeeeest!!!!}
<A>__{a beat, then... angle chain which is dangling from the belly of the beast. at the bottom of the chain is the knife guy from the fight scene. west is hanging on to his ankles, enjoying a vindictive, belly laugh.}
<C>__{west}
<P>__{(downward)}
<D>__{now that looked like it hurt.}
