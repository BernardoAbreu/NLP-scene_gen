<L>__{exterior suburban street (seattle) day}
<A>__{frances carries library books and a small grocery bag. her hair and skin gleam in the sun. people in their yards stare at her as she passes. she walks on, coming to a group of children slightly younger than herself who are playing in front of a union hall. a girl, emma, 13, glances up.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{hi emma.}
<A>__{emma looks away quickly, returns to her play.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{bye emma.}
<A>__{frances shakes her head as she walks on.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{frances hesitates, then turns to look: a man in his twenties whom we recognize as harry york, kaminski's compatriot, leaves a group of men in front of the union hall and walks toward her.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(friendly)}
<D>__{c'mere. i wanna talk to you.}
<A>__{frances keeps walking. harry hurries after her.}
<C>__{harry}

<C>__{harry}
<D>__{now wait a minute, sweetie. do i look like a newshound to you?}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(examining him)}
<D>__{no... actually, you look more like a cop.}
<A>__{harry laughs.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{that's rich. hey, if i was a cop, i'd be packing, right?}
<P>__{(holding coat open)}
<D>__{you see a gun? go on, search me. pat me down.}
<A>__{frances hesitates, leans toward him as though about to frisk him. their eyes meet, and she pulls away, suddenly embarrassed.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{i will... take your word for it. so who are you, then?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{harry york. i work for martoni kaminski, he's running for congress here.}

<C>__{harry}
<D>__{now you're catchin' on. don't wanna get your daddy in hot water, do you?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{whattaya mean?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist }
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{but i'm not. the newspapers're }
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{right again. you're no more an atheist than my man's a red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. could look bad for your daddy.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{yeah. could look bad for you and kaminski too, i guess.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{harry}

<C>__{harry}
<D>__{harry.}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(hesitates, nods)}
<D>__{harry.}
<A>__{they half smile, awkwardly, as if neither really wants this encounter to end. then harry doffs his hat.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{bye.}
<A>__{she nods shyly and starts up the path toward the house.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(admiring her)}
<D>__{sure don't walk like sixteen, neither.}
