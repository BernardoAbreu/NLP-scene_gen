<A>__{the chink drives, stephen rides shotgun. bloom and penelope in the back seat. he looks weary. he sees the bridge approaching, maybe a half mile ahead. she pulls his head down into her lap, fingers in his hair. he breathes, closes his eyes. an explosion shatters the front passenger window. bloom's eyes snap open, he bolts upright. the bridge is still a quarter mile away. in the next moment the car becomes a din of breaking glass, screams, tires screeching.}
