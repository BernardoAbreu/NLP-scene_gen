<A>__{c 2 insurance office twelfth floor day neff comes through the reception room doors with his hat on and his briefcase under his arm. he walks towards his office, but half way there he runs into keyes. keyes is wearing his vest and hat, no coat. he is carrying a file of papers and smoking a cigar.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{come on, walter. the big boss wants to see us.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{he turns and walks beside keyes, camera ahead of them}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{that dietrichson case?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{must be.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{anything wrong?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{the guy's dead, we had him insured and it's going to cost us money. that's always wrong.}
<A>__{he stops by a majolica jar full of sand and takes a pencil from his vest. he stands over the jar extinguishing his cigar carefully so as not to damage it.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{what have you got so far?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{autopsy report. no heart failure, no apoplexy, no predisposing medical cause of any kind. he died of a broken neck.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{when is the inquest?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{they had it this morning. his wife and daughter made the identification. the train people and some passengers told how he went through to the observation car.. it was all over in forty five minutes. verdict, accidental death.}
<A>__{keyes puts the half smoked cigar into his vest pocket with the pencil. they move on.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{what do the police figure?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{that he got tangled up in his crutches and fell off the train. they're satisfied. it's not their dough.}
<A>__{they stop at a door lettered in embossed chromium letters: edward s. norton, jr. president. keyes opens the door. they go in. c 3 interior reception room mr. norton's office a secretary sitting behind a desk. as keyes and neff enter, the door to norton's private office is opened. from inside, mr. norton is letting out three legal looking gentlemen. norton is about forty five, very well groomed, rather pompous in manner.}
<C>__{norton}
<P>__{(to the men who are leaving)}
<D>__{i believe the legal position is now clear, gentlemen. please stand by. i may need you later.}
<A>__{he sees keyes and neff.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{come in, mr. keyes. you too, mr. neff.}
<A>__{neff has put down his hat and briefcase. he and keyes pass the legal looking men and follow norton into his office. c 4 interior norton's office naturally it is the best office in the building; modern but not modernistic, spacious, very well furnished; flowers, smoking stands, easy chairs, etc. norton has gone behind his desk. keyes has come in, and neff after him closes the door quietly. norton looks disapprovingly at keyes' shirt sleeves.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{you find this an uncomfortably warm day mr. keyes?}
<A>__{keyes takes his hat off but holds it in his hands.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{sorry, mr. norton. i didn't know this was formal.}
<A>__{norton smiles frostily.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{sit down, gentlemen.}
<P>__{(to keyes)}
<D>__{any new developments?}
<A>__{keyes and neff sit down, norton remains standing.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{i just talked to this jackson long distance. up in medford, oregon.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{who's jackson?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{the last guy that saw dietrichson alive. they were out on the observation platform together talking. dietrichson wanted a cigar and jackson went to get dietrichson's cigar case for him. when he came back to the observation platform, no dietrichson. jackson didn't think anything was wrong until a wire caught up with the train at santa barbara. they had found dietrichson's body on the tracks near burbank.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{very interesting, about the cigar case.}
<A>__{he walks up and down behind his desk thinking hard.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{anything else?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{not much. dietrichson's secretary says she didn't know anything about the policy. there is a daughter, but all she remembers is neff talking to her father about accident insurance at their house one night.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{i couldn't sell him at first. mrs. dietrichson opposed it. he told me he'd think it over. later on i went down to the oil fields and closed him. he signed the application and gave me his check.}
<C>__{norton}
<P>__{(dripping with sarcasm)}
<D>__{a fine piece of salesmanship that was, mr. neff.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{there's no sense in pushing neff around. he's got the best sales record in the office. are your salesmen supposed to know that the customer is going to fall off a train?}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{fall off a train? are we sure dietrichson fell off the train?}
<A>__{there is a charged pause.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{i don't get it.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{you don't, mr. keyes? then what do you think of this case? this policy might cost us a great deal of money. as you know, it contains a double indemnity clause. just what is your opinion?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{no opinion at all.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{not even a hunch? one of those interesting little hunches of yours?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{nope. not even a hunch.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{i'm surprised, mr. keyes. i've formed a very definite opinion. i think i know in fact i know i know what happened to dietrichson.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{you know you know what?}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{i know it was not an accident.}
<A>__{he looks from keyes to neff and back to keyes.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{what do you say to that?}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{me? you've got the ball. let's see you run with it.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{there's a widespread feeling that just because a man has a large office }
<A>__{the dictograph on his desk buzzes. he reaches over and depresses a key and puts the earpiece to his ear.}
<C>__{norton}
<P>__{(into dictograph)}
<D>__{yes?... have her come in, please.}
<A>__{he replaces the earpiece. he turns back to keyes and neff.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{ that just because a man has a large office he must be an idiot. i'm having a visitor, if you don't mind.}
<A>__{keyes and neff start to get up.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{no, no. i want you to stay and watch me handle this.}
<A>__{the secretary has opened the door.}
<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{mrs. dietrichson.}
<A>__{neff stands staring at the door. he relaxes with an obvious effort of will. phyllis comes in. she wears a gray tailored suit, small black hat with a veil, black gloves, and carries a black bag. the secretary closes the door behind her. mr. norton goes to meet her.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{thank you very much for coming, mrs. dietrichson. i assure you i appreciate it.}
<A>__{he turns a little towards keyes.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{this is mr. keyes.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{how do you do.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{how do you do.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{and mr. neff.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i've met mr. neff. how do you do.}
<A>__{norton has placed a chair. phyllis sits. norton goes behind his desk.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{mrs. dietrichson, i assure you of our sympathy in your bereavement. i hesitated before asking you to come here so soon after your loss.}
<A>__{phyllis nods silently.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{but now that you're here i hope you won't mind if i plunge straight into business. you know why we asked you to come, don't you?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{no. all i know is that your secretary made it sound very urgent.}
<A>__{keyes sits quietly in his chair with his legs crossed. he has hung his hat on his foot and thrust his thumbs in the armholes of his vest. he looks a little bored. neff, behind him, stands leaning against the false mantel, completely dead pan.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{your husband had an accident policy with this company. evidently you don't know that, mrs. dietrichson.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{no. i remember some talk at the house }
<A>__{she looks towards neff.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{ but he didn't seem to want it.}
<C>__{neff}
<D>__{he took it out a few days later, mrs. dietrichson.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{you'll probably find the policy among his personal effects.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{his safe deposit box hasn't been opened yet. it seems a tax examiner has to be present.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{please, mrs. dietrichson, i don't want you to think you are being subjected to any questioning. but there are a few things we should like to know.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{what sort of things?}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{we have the report of the coroner's inquest. accidental death. we are not entirely satisfied. in fact we are not satisfied at all.}
<A>__{phyllis looks at him coolly. keyes looks vaguely interested. neff is staring straight at phyllis.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{frankly, mrs. dietrichson, we suspect suicide.}
<A>__{phyllis doesn't bat an eyelash.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{i'm sorry. would you like a glass of water?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{please.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{mr. neff.}
<A>__{he indicates a thermos on a stand near neff. neff pours a glass of water and carries it over to phyllis. she has lifted her veil a little. she takes the glass from his hand.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{their eyes meet for a fraction of a second.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{had your husband been moody or depressed lately, mrs. dietrichson? did he seem to have financial worries, for instance?}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{he was perfectly all right and i don't know of any financial worries.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{there must have been something, mrs. dietrichson. let us examine this so called accident. first, your husband takes out this policy in absolute secrecy. why? because he doesn't want his family to suspect what he intends to do.}
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{do what?}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{commit suicide. next, he goes on this trip entirely alone. he has to be alone. he hobbles all the way out to the observation platform, very unlikely with his leg in a cast, unless he has a very strong reason. once there, he finds he is not alone. there is a man there. what was his name, keyes?}
<A>__{norton flips his fingers impatiently at keyes who doesn't even bother to look up.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{his name was jackson. probably still is.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{jackson. so your husband gets rid of this jackson with some flimsy excuse about cigars. and then he is alone. and then he does it. he jumps. suicide. in which case the company is not liable.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you know that, of course. we could go to court }
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{i don't know anything. in fact i don't know why i came here.}
<A>__{she makes as if to rise indignantly.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{just a moment, please. i said we could go to court. i didn't say we want to. not only is it against our practice, but it would involve a great deal of expense, a lot of lawyers, a lot of time, perhaps years.}
<A>__{phyllis rises coldly.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{so what i want to suggest is a compromise on both sides. a settlement for a certain sum, a part of the policy value }
<C>__{phyllis}
<D>__{don't bother, mr. norton. when i came in here i had no idea you owed me any money. you told me you did. then you told me you didn't. now you tell me you want to pay me a part of it, whatever it is. you want to bargain with me, at a time like this. i don't like your insinuations about my husband, mr. norton, and i don't like your methods. in fact i don't like you, mr. norton. goodbye, gentlemen.}
<A>__{she turns and walks out. the door closes after her. there is a pregnant pause. keyes straightens up in his chair.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{nice going, mr. norton. you sure carried that ball.}
<A>__{norton pours himself a glass of water and stands holding it.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{only you fumbled on the goal line. then you heaved an illegal forward pass and got thrown for a forty yard loss. now you can't pick yourself up because you haven't got a leg to stand on.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{i haven't eh? let her claim. let her sue. we can prove it was suicide.}
<A>__{keyes stands up.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{can we? mr. norton, the first thing that hit me was that suicide angle. only i dropped it in the wastepaper basket just three seconds later. you ought to take a look at the statistics on suicide sometime. you might learn a little something about the insurance business.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{i was raised in the insurance business, mr. keyes.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{yeah. in the front office. come on, you never read an actuarial table in your life. i've got ten volumes on suicide alone. suicide by race, by color, by occupation, by sex, by seasons of the year, by time of day. suicide, how committed: by poisons, by fire arms, by drowning, by leaps. suicide by poison, subdivided by types of poison, such as corrosive, irritant, systemic, gaseous, narcotic, alkaloid, protein, and so forth. suicide by leaps, subdivided by leaps from high places, under wheels of trains, under wheels of trucks, under the feet of horses, from steamboats. but mr. norton, of all the cases on record there's not one single case of suicide by leap from the rear end of a moving train. and do you know how fast that train was going at the point where the body was found? fifteen miles an hour. now how could anybody jump off a slow moving train like that with any kind of expectation that he would kill himself? no soap, mr. norton. we're sunk, and we're going to pay through the nose, and you know it. may i have this?}
<A>__{keyes' throat is dry after the long speech. he grabs the glass of water out of norton's hand and drains it in one big gulp. norton is watching him almost stupefied. neff stands with the shadow of a smile on his face. keyes puts the glass down noisily on norton's desk.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{come on, walter.}
<A>__{norton doesn't move or speak. keyes puts his hat on and crosses towards the door, neff after him. with the doorknob in his hand keyes turns back to norton with a glance down at his own shirt sleeves.}
<C>__{keyes}
<D>__{next time i will rent a tuxedo.}
<A>__{they go out.}
