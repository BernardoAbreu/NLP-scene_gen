<L>__{exterior service station attendant day}
<A>__{he's heavy set and sullen. dollarhyde's van, with reba, pulls in.}
<C>__{dollarhyde}
<D>__{do you want a coke or something, reba?}
<C>__{reba}
<D>__{i'm fine, francis.}
<A>__{dollarhyde gets out.}
<C>__{dollarhyde}
<D>__{fill it up and check the oil, please.}
<A>__{dollarhyde crosses to the men's room. after placing the nozzle in the gas tank the attendant bangs open the hood, draws the dipstick, grabs a can of 10 40, jams the oil spout into the can and sticks the spout into the engine. as he starts to move around the van he sees something in the interior and stops. a smile dawns on his face. we don't know what he sees. he starts wiping the windshield. he wipes and wipes the same spot. reba's dress is just above her knees. she sits on the high seat. her legs are crossed. her white cane lays between the seats. from his lower angle at the van window the attendant can look up her dress. he bends down a little to see better... men's room door nothing. then dollarhyde enters. he crumples a paper rowel and throws it in the basket. dollarhyde crosses around the backside of the van. driver's window dollarhyde appears. as he starts to reach for his wallet on the dash, he sees what the attendant's doing...}

<P>__{(cocky)}
<D>__{you don't like it? you know what you can do about it...}
<A>__{attendant starts away. dollarhyde catches him and shoves him into and through a display of stp. the attendant bounces once and slams into the station wall. cans crash and roll away... dollarhyde does know what he can do about it. reba's face through the windshield. she's trying to find the handle to roll down the window.}
<B>__{attendant}
<A>__{is white. there is something in dollarhyde's face that he has never seen before, anywhere.}
<B>__{dollarhyde}
<A>__{pulls the spout from the oil can that was in his engine. he advances on the frozen attendant. he looks at the sharp end of the spout.}
<B>__{attendant}
<A>__{is wide eyed. dollarhyde's big hand enters and flattens the man into the wall, compressing his thorax.}
<C>__{dollarhyde}
<D>__{i ought to jam this in your chest, and drain your heart...}
<A>__{the attendant tries to say he's sorry, but he can't talk. dollarhyde's hand has grabbed his face. he hesitates. then he throws money at the attendant and leaves...}
