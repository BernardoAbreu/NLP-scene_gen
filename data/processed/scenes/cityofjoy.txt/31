<L>__{interior jute mill day}
<A>__{a flaking gray wall, half obscured with moldering files. the grilled window lets in a little light and the quiet supplications of those outside. an old clerk at a desk. a voice calls out. the clerk looks up, crosses to the grill. hasari's tense face through the bars. a truck rumbles past, drowning out the words... except these: "...trade union." the clerk shakes his head sadly. on the verge of panic, hasari hangs onto the window...}

<D>__{do you have family?}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{yes, yes of course. but i'm three days without work. i will take anything.}
<A>__{the clerk digs in his pocket, presses two rupees on hasari.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{here, now go away.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{no, i don't want you to give me }
<A>__{the next man in line forcibly moves hasari out of the way.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{in this city, a man with a family can't be proud. take it!}
