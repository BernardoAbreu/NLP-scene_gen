<A>__{steven runs into birkheim's office and scans the papers on his desk. nothing. he turns his attention to birkheim's briefcase, but he can't get it open. eventually he spots a blank legal pad and looks at it closely. he grabs a pencil and does the old detective trick of shading in the page to reveal what was written on the now missing page above. the embossed text reads, "837,502.12" he stares at it a moment. this number looks familiar. he grabs the phone and dials. an automated voice answers.}

<A>__{steven quickly enters some numbers. as he listens he flips through birkheim's desktop calendar.}
<C>__{automated teller }
<D>__{thank you. your account balance is eight hundred thirty seven thousand five hundred and two dollars and twelve cents. to repeat this }
<A>__{it's the same number as on the pad. he hangs up. and turns his attention to the calendar. he spies an entry that reads, "harris county police, 12:30" he leaps out of the chair and exits the office.}
