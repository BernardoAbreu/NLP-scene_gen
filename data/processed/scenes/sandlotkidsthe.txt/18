<L>__{exterior enroute to the sandlot day}
<A>__{scotty runs by (soon familiar places):}
<D>__{a 5 & dime}
<B>__{a boys club}
<A>__{a little league field, where he slows momentarily, envious of the crisply uniformed kids... wow. moving on down}
<L>__{exterior the block of sandlot common houses day}
<A>__{whose backyards we already know. scotty flat out stops at}
<C>__{the house}
<A>__{with the fiberglass panels out back. scary place.}
<L>__{exterior the sandlot day}
<A>__{scotty slips quietly through the secret fence doorway, emerging}
<C>__{in}
<B>__{deep left field}
<A>__{where he hugs the perimeter, moving slowly toward the sandlot common houses. winded, scotty finds}
<C>__{the gang's}
<A>__{already playing "over the line."}
<C>__{narrator}
<D>__{they never kept score. they never chose sides. they never even really stopped playing the game... it just went on forever. everyday they picked up right where they left off the day before. it was an endless "dream game."}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{there was only 8 of them, so they didn't have a whole team. it didn't matter though... benny was so good he took everyone's position when it was there ups.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i didn't know any of that then... i just knew they were having the time of their lives and i wanted to be a part of it.}
<C>__{scotty}
<A>__{watches and listens (as he goes) to the sharp, satisfying sound of the hardball, snapping cleanly in the oily leather of their gloves.}
<B>__{he looks at}
<A>__{his own toy glove... how embarrassing.}
<C>__{scotty}
<A>__{continues around the perimeter, trying to be seen and become invisible. he goes unwittingly closer to those green fiberglass panels.}
<C>__{denunez}
<A>__{winds up and pitches to}
<C>__{benny}
<A>__{who connects big. crack!}
<C>__{scotty's}
<A>__{come too close to the green fence. something has overcome him... fear! he stares with serious woollies at}
<B>__{a hole in the fiberglass}
<A>__{and sees only dust rising in time with some great, sounds of exhalation. and then, before he can draw any conclusions... disaster.}
<C>__{gang }
<D>__{hey! look out!}
<C>__{scotty}
<A>__{whips a look up and sees}
<B>__{the fly ball}
<A>__{coming right at him.}
<C>__{scotty}
<A>__{tracks it, frozen stiff. scared shitless. at the past possible moment, he throws his arms over his face and ducks... social suicide.}
<C>__{the ball}
<A>__{beans him at the glove covering his noggin.}
<C>__{scotty}
<A>__{hits his butt. the ball rolls a bit. comes to an "i dare you" stop: right up against the diseased fiberglass panels of that preternatural fence. scotty pulls his arms away from his face.}
<C>__{the gang}
<A>__{laughs uproariously.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{nice catch!}
<C>__{repeat}
<D>__{nice catch!}
<C>__{ham}
<D>__{hey! throw the ball back! yeah yeah yeah yeah, hurry up!}
<C>__{bertram}
<D>__{we gotta a game here, man!}
<C>__{scotty}
<A>__{moves for the ball. as he goes, he sweats:}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{'kay, i will get it!}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{don't be a goofus don't be a goofus don't be a goofus.}
<A>__{he reaches the fence and the ball and stops. it's hard to move. the force emanating from the backyard has got him:}
<B>__{dust through the hole in the fiberglass}
<A>__{keeps perfect time with the monster breathing.}
<B>__{an olenader bush}
<A>__{moves. it scares the living kapok out of}
<C>__{scotty}
<A>__{who snatches up the ball and back pedals 10 feet.}
<C>__{squints}
<D>__{we're waiting...}
<A>__{he throws back the ball. and his chances of getting in with these guys are over. because scotty... throws like a girl!}
<C>__{the ball}
<A>__{droops forward in the air. lands 6 feet from him. rolls slowly up to the gang, finally coming to a dainty stop at denunez' feet.}
<C>__{the gang}
<A>__{looks from the ball to scotty... they crack up!}
<C>__{scotty}
<A>__{walks away... crying.}
<C>__{scotty}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{my life is over.}
<C>__{benny}
<A>__{is the only one that isn't laughing. he stares the others down.}
<C>__{denunez}
<D>__{come on, benny man, didn't you see that throw?}
<A>__{he imitates it, "flipping" his glove to ham. the gang busts up again.}
<C>__{ham}
<P>__{(truly stunned)}
<D>__{that kid's got the gaw'damn panty waistiest arm i ever saw in my whole life.}
<C>__{squints}
<D>__{i seen a guy once that threw like that. i mean not that bad, but at least so bad that he hadda move in the fourth grade 'cause they nicknamed him "bloomers."}
<A>__{benny's look stifles the bunch.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{i bet not one of you knows how the babe got his nickname.}
<C>__{ham}
<D>__{easy, 'cause of the way he looked like a little kid face.}
<C>__{bertram}
<D>__{bull, it's just 'cause he liked kids and stuff.}
<C>__{squints}
<D>__{wrong. the babe was called the babe, because he was like the child of yankee stadium.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{i knew it. you're all full of crap. george herman ruth got his nickname because his mom died when he was just a little kid, and he hadda go live in an orphanage.}
<A>__{silence. none of the other guys has heard this before.}
<C>__{benny }
<D>__{nobody liked him there. the bigger guys picked on him all the time. and when they messed with him he couldn't fight back, 'cause he was just... like scared. so when they messed with him, he cried about it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he cried... so they called him the babe.}
<A>__{this hits home real good.}
<C>__{benny }
<D>__{how ya think that kid just felt?}
<A>__{benny exits the sandlot, leaving the others with a lesson learned.}
<C>__{narrator}
<D>__{everyone knew benny was different. nobody ever voted or anything, but he was the leader.}
