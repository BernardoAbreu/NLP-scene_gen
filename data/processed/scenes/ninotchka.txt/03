<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{lobby hotel clarence at the desk buljanoff, iranoff, and kopalski are approaching the manager, their only suitcase carried by two of them.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{are you the manager?}
<C>__{manager}
<P>__{(eyeing the three suspiciously)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{kopalski}
<D>__{pardon me for introducing comrade iranoff, member of the russian board of trade.}
<C>__{manager}
<P>__{(bowing with strained politeness)}
<D>__{monsieur.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{this is comrade kopalski.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{monsieur.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{i am comrade buljanoff.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{monsieur.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{may i ask how much your rooms are?}
<C>__{manager}
<P>__{(trying to get rid of them)}
<D>__{well, gentlemen, i'm afraid our rates are rather high.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{why should you be afraid?}
<A>__{the other two nod their agreement. the manager has noted the single suitcase.}
<C>__{manager}
<P>__{(haughtily)}
<D>__{i might be able to accommodate you. is there some more luggage?}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{oh, yes, but have you a safe here big enough to hold this?}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{i'm afraid we have no boxes of that size in our vault, but there is one suite with a private safe...}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{that's even better.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{but, gentlemen, i am afraid...}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{he's always afraid.}
<A>__{the other two exchange a look of agreement again.}
<C>__{manager}
<P>__{(a little annoyed)}
<D>__{i just wanted to explain. the apartment may suit your convenience but i doubt that it will fit your convictions. it's the royal suite.}
<A>__{the mention of the royal suite startles the three.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{royal suite!}
<P>__{(to the manager)}
<D>__{just a minute.}
<A>__{the three russians take a step away from the manager and go into a huddle.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<P>__{(in a low voice)}
<D>__{now comrades, i warn you... if it gets out in moscow that we stay in the royal suite we will get into terrible trouble.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<P>__{(defending his right to a good time)}
<D>__{we'll just say we had to take it on account of the safe. that's a perfect excuse. there was no other safe big enough.}
<A>__{the other two welcome the suggestion with relish.}
<C>__{buljanoff and iranoff}
<D>__{that's right. good, very good.}
<A>__{suddenly buljanoff grows skeptical again.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<D>__{of course, we could take out the pieces and distribute them in three or four boxes in the vault and take a small room. that's an idea, isn't it?}
<A>__{for a moment all three see their bright plans crumble. then iranoff comes to the rescue.}
<C>__{iranoff}
<D>__{yes, it's an idea, but who says we have to have an idea?}
<A>__{buljanoff and kopalski see the logic of this and their faces light up.}
<C>__{both}
<D>__{that's right... that's right.}
<C>__{buljanoff}
<P>__{(turning to the manager)}
<D>__{give us the royal suite.}
<A>__{the manager leads the three toward the elevator. the camera follows them and narrows down to the suitcase carried by two of the russians.}
