<L>__{interior office of chief of police full shot}
<A>__{a young man with a serious, frowning face has just come into the room. he is dr. simon, the psychiatrist. he goes to the desk where the box of coffee containers has been placed, takes up a container.}
<C>__{district attorney}
<D>__{did he talk to you?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{no. i got the whole story... but not from norman. i got it from... his mother.}
<A>__{everyone gazes at him, mystified. he speaks as he removes lid from coffee container.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{norman bates no longer exists. he only half existed to begin with... now, the other half has taken over. probably for all time.}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(with difficulty)}
<D>__{did he kill my sister?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{yes... and no.}
<C>__{district attorney}
<D>__{look, if you're trying to lay a lot of psychiatric groundwork for some sort of plea this fellow would like to cop...}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{a psychiatrist doesn't lay the groundwork .. he merely tries to explain it.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{but my sister is...}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{yes. i'm sorry.}
<P>__{(to chambers)}
<D>__{the private investigator, too. if you drag that swamp somewhere in the vicinity of the motel...}
<P>__{(to the chief of police)}
<D>__{have you any unsolved missing persons cases on your books?}
<C>__{chief of police}
<D>__{yes. two.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{young girls?}
<C>__{chief of police}
<P>__{(nods, astounded, then:)}
<D>__{did he confess to...}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{as i said, the mother...}
<P>__{(pauses, goes on afresh)}
<D>__{to understand it, as i understood it hearing it from the mother... that is, from the mother half of norman's mind, you have to go back ten years... to the time when norman murdered his mother and her lover.}
<P>__{(a pause, then as no one interrupts)}
<D>__{he was already dangerously disturbed, had been ever since his father died. his mother was a clinging, demanding woman... and for years the two of them lived as if there was no one else in the world. then she met a man and it seemed to norman she "threw him over" for this man. that pushed him over the thin line... and he killed them both. matricide is probably the most unbearable crime of all... and most unbearable to the son who commit it. so he had to erase the crime, at least in his own mind.}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{he stole her corpse... and a weighted coffin was buried. he hid the body in the fruit cellar, even "treated" it to keep it as well as it would keep. and that still wasn't enough. she was there, but she was a corpse. so he began to think and speak for her, gave her half his life, so to speak. at times he could be both personalities, carry on conversations... at other times, the mother half took over completely. he was never all norman, but he was often only mother. and because he was so pathologically jealous of her, he assumed she was as jealous of him. therefore, if he felt a strong attraction to any other woman, the mother side of him would go wild.}
<P>__{(to lila)}
<D>__{when norman met your sister, he was touched by her... and aroused by her. he wanted her. and this set off his "jealous mother" and... "mother killed the girl." after the murder, norman returned as if from a deep sleep... and like a dutiful son, covered up all traces of the crime he was convinced his mother had committed.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{why was he... dressed like that?}
<C>__{district attorney}
<D>__{he's a transvestite!}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{not exactly. a man who dresses in woman's clothing in order to achieve a sexual change... or satisfaction... is a transvestite. but in norman's case, he was simply doing everything possible to keep alive the illusion of his mother being alive. and whenever reality came too close, when danger or desire threatened that illusion, he'd dress up, even to a cheap wig he brought, and he'd walk about the house, sit in her chair, speak in her voice... he tried to be his mother.}
<P>__{(a sad smile)}
<D>__{and now he is.}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{that's what i meant when i said i got the story from the mother. she thinks norman has been taken away... because of his crimes. she insists she did nothing, that norman committed all the murders just to keep her from being discovered. she even smiled a bit coquettishly as she said that. of course, she feels badly about it... but also somewhat relieved to be, as she put it, free of norman, at last.}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{when the mind houses two personalities, there is always a battle. in norman's case, the battle is over... and the dominant personality has won.}
<A>__{lila begins to weep softly, for mary, for arbogast, for norman, for all the destroyed human beings of this world. sam bends beside her, puts his arm about her, comforts her.}
<C>__{chambers}
<P>__{(to simon)}
<D>__{and the forty thousand dollars? who got that?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{the swamp. these were murders of passion, not profit.}
<A>__{a police guard puts his head in the door, speaks, in a near whisper, to the chief of police. the guard is carrying a folded blanket over his arm.}
<C>__{police guard}
<D>__{he feels a little chill... can i bring him this blanket?}
<A>__{the chief of police nods. the guard goes away, and camera follows him out of the room and out into the hallway. guard moves through the waiting men, heading down the corridor.}
