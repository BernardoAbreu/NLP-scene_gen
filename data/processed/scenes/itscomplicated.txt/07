<L>__{interior the bakery montecito day}
<A>__{this is jane's other home. a large, bright, bustling bakery restaurant. the bakery counter could rival any in paris. last year, the new york times rated jane's pain au chocolat the best in the united states. a line waits to get in. a very relaxed jane is behind the busy counter, easily moving between her young staff. the atmosphere is efficient and friendly. jane adjusts a few signs on the counter, then reaches inside the display case, pulling out a tray of muffins topped with powdered sugar. she carries the tray to the open pass through to the busy kitchen and calls to the head baker.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{reynaldo...}
<P>__{(nods to the muffins)}
<C>__{reynaldo}
<D>__{too much sugar.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{little bit.}
<A>__{reynaldo nods as jane hands him the tray. jane notices a line waiting to get up to the bakery counter. knowing what to do, jane's staff has already set out cups of coffee with lids.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{who wants coffee while they're waiting?}
<A>__{jane and the staff hand out the free coffee. jane walks the counter moments later refills a glass of water, checking on her customers.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(quietly to a young employee)}
<D>__{check on table five, will you?}
<A>__{the young employee nods as jane looks up and sees a man on the other side of the counter. they exchange polite hellos when jane notices peter, tan and confident, approaching her.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(all smiles)}
<D>__{peter!}
<A>__{peter joins adam, the man who stands across from jane. adam is handsome in a way that sneaks up on you. there's something reserved and refreshing about his demeanor. he holds rolled blueprints.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{jane, i can't remember, have you ever met adam schaeffer?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{well....}
<P>__{(shrugs awkwardly )}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{look what we've got.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(raises the blueprints)}
<D>__{your plans.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(to peter)}
<D>__{so excited!}
