<P>__{(face again unseen)}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, it's been a long time, but i'm back. it's all gone perfectly to plan except for one small flaw. because of a technical error, my right arm was not frozen. i was therefore by definition only partially frozen.}
<A>__{angle on evil associate mustafa. he is terrified and sweaty,}
<B>__{eyes darting left and right.}
<C>__{mustafa}
<D>__{but my design was perfect! your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{can't you see i'm only half a man? look at me, i'm a freak!}
<A>__{he holds up his older right arm, which looks normal.}
<C>__{mustafa}
<D>__{but dr. evil, all you need to do is }
<P>__{(holding up tennis ball)}
<D>__{ work with this tennis ball. squeeze it for twenty minutes a day. a few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm...}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{and look what you've done to mr. bigglesworth!}
<B>__{angle on mr. bigglesworth}
<A>__{who is now totally hairless, with a fringe of white hair around it's ears, like dr. evil himself.}
<C>__{mustafa}
<D>__{we could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash;}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<P>__{(face unseen)}
<D>__{silence!}
<A>__{angle on a hand with dr. evil's ring on it dr. evil presses a button. mustafa's chair tips back and he falls backwards into a pit.}

<D>__{ahhhhhhhhh!}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<P>__{(face unseen)}
<D>__{let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure.}
<A>__{mustafa's screams echo faintly angle on: dr. evil for the first time. he is in his early fifties and is bald, with a hideous scar on his cheek.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{gentlemen, let's get down to business.}
<A>__{more muffled screams.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{we've got a lot of work to do.}
<C>__{mustafa }
<P>__{(muffled)}
<D>__{someone help me! i'm still alive, only i'm very badly burned.}

<C>__{mustafa }
<P>__{(muffled)}
<D>__{hello up there! anyone! can someone call an ambulance? i'm in quite a lot of pain.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<P>__{(very frustrated)}
<D>__{you've all been gathered here to form my evil cabinet. excuse me.}
<A>__{he picks up a white phone and murmurs into it.}
<C>__{mustafa }
<P>__{(muffled)}
<D>__{if somebody can open the retrieval hatch down here, i could get out. see, i designed this device myself and...oh, hi! good, i'm glad you found me. listen, i'm very badly burned, so if you could just }

<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{right. okay. moving on.}
<C>__{mustafa }
<P>__{(muffled)}
<D>__{you shot me right in the arm! why did }
<A>__{sfx: muffled gunshot. dr. evil waits. nothing.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{let me go around the table and introduce everyone. frau farbissina...}

<C>__{dr. evil}

<A>__{everyone in the room tries to keep a straight face.}
<C>__{patty o'brien}
<D>__{what? what? why does everyone always laugh when i say that? they are after me lucky charms.}
<A>__{they cannot contain their laughter.}
<C>__{patty o'brien}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{frau farbissina}
<P>__{(through suppressed laughter)}
<D>__{it's a television commercial with this little cartoon leprechaun who is a benevolent imp who is very concerned that these children will steal his lucky charms which are foodstuffs fashioned into various shapes hearts, moons, clovers, what have you...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{it's a long story.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{finally, i come to my number two man. his name: number two.}
<A>__{number two, a good looking 40 year old man with an eye patch.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{for thirty years, number two has run virtucon, the legitimate face of my evil empire.}
<A>__{he hits a button. the conference table slowly rotates to reveal a large, illuminated map of the united states dotted by various miniature models.}
<C>__{number two}
<D>__{over the last thirty years, virtucon has grown by leaps and bounds. about fifteen years ago, we changed from volatile chemicals to the communication industry. we own cable companies in thirty eight states.}
<A>__{the thirty eight states illuminate on the map.}
<C>__{number two}

<D>__{we also own the franklin mint, which makes decorative hand painted theme plates for collectors.}
<P>__{(holds up plate)}
<D>__{some plates, like the gone with the wind series, have gone up in value as much as two hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{gentlemen, i have a plan. it's called blackmail. the royal family of britain are the wealthiest landowners in the world. either the royal family pays us an exorbitant amount of money, or we make it look like prince charles, the heir to the throne, has had an affair outside of marriage and, therefore, they would have to divorce.}
<A>__{there is an uncomfortable silence.}
<C>__{number two}
<D>__{um, dr. evil, prince charles did have an affair. he admitted it, and they are now divorced, actually.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{people have to tell me these things. i've been frozen for thirty years, throw me a bone here.}
<P>__{(pausing)}
<D>__{ok, no problem. here's my second plan. back in the sixties i had a weather changing machine that was in essence a sophisticated heat beam which we called a "laser." using this laser, we punch a hole in the protective layer around the earth, which we scientists call the "ozone layer." slowly but surely, ultraviolet rays would pour in, increasing the risk of skin cancer. that is, unless the world pays us a hefty ransom.}
<A>__{there is another uncomfortable silence.}
<C>__{number two}
<D>__{umm, that also has already happened.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{right.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{oh, hell, let's just do what we always do. let's hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{gentlemen, it's come to my attention that a breakaway russian republic called kreplachistan will be transferring a nuclear warhead to the united nations in a few days. here's the plan. we get the warhead, and we hold the world ransom...}
<P>__{(dramatic pause)}
<D>__{...for one million dollars!}
<A>__{there is an uncomfortable pause.}
<C>__{number two}
<D>__{don't you think we should ask for more than a million dollars? a million dollars isn't that much money these days.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{all right then...}
<P>__{(dramatic pause)}
<D>__{...five million dollars!}
<A>__{there is another uncomfortable pause.}
<C>__{number two}
<D>__{virtucon alone makes over nine billion dollars a year.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<P>__{(pleasantly surprised)}
<D>__{oh, really?}
<P>__{(slightly irritated)}
<D>__{one hundred billion dollars.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{ok, make it happen. anything else?}
<C>__{frau farbissina}
<D>__{remember when we froze your semen, you said that if it looked like you weren't coming back to try and make you a son so that a part of you would live forever?}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{frau farbissina}
<D>__{well, after a few years, we got sort of impatient. dr. evil, i want you to meet your son.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{my son?}
<C>__{frau farbissina}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{scott!}
<A>__{scott evil walks out. he is fifteen, grungy, and wears a kurt cobain t shirt.}
<C>__{scott evil}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{hello, scott. i'm your father, dr. evil.}
<P>__{(emotional)}
<D>__{i have a son! i have a son! everyone, i have a son!}
<P>__{(gesturing to globe)}
<D>__{someday, scott, this will all be yours.}
<C>__{scott evil}
<D>__{i haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship? i hate you!}
