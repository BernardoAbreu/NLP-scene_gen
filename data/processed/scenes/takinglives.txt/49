<C>__{inspector reynaud}
<P>__{(subtitled french)}
<D>__{maybe they will tell you. why do you trust junkies?}
<C>__{inspector laval}
<P>__{(makes a fist)}

<C>__{inspector reynaud}
<P>__{(subtitled french)}
<D>__{don't say that in front of her.}
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(subtitled french)}
<D>__{it's okay. i was a street cop in philadelphia for three years before i joined the fbi.}
<A>__{grace speaks french. reynaud reacts. as does laval.}
<C>__{inspector reynaud}
<D>__{very nice. you like to play games.}
<A>__{grace smiles.}
<C>__{inspector laval}
<D>__{mr. ford worked as a cruise ship musician. he would walk around and play his guitar on the decks at night.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{life is pretty cold sometimes. man's just trying to spread a little music and gets murdered.}
<C>__{inspector laval}
<D>__{he targeted mr. ford the night before he was supposed to get on a plane and meet a ship in aruba.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{only the new improved mr. ford was going to meet he ship.}
<C>__{inspector reynaud}
<D>__{think he has a plan b?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i doubt it. he's been so meticulous and effective in the past, i bet he's never needed one. we can assume he has all sorts of fake ids and passports. disguises. but that's not enough for him, he has to be someone else. he gets off impersonating people. and he knows his current persona is compromised.}
<A>__{laval and reynaud have stopped eating, are looking at her.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{inspector laval}
<D>__{you're always thinking. save something for tomorrow. we have three boxes of evidence to go through.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{pretty cavalier attitude for a man who just got his ass chewed by his boss.}
<C>__{inspector laval}
<D>__{my papa dropped dead of a heart attack in front of a drill press at work. not me.}
<A>__{grace understands. laval clinks her beer, reynaud too.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i'm dropping by costa's, i still have a couple questions.}
<P>__{(off laval's look)}
<D>__{i can't turn it off.}
