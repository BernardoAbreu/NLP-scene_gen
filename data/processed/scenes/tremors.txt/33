<L>__{exterior canyon road day}
<A>__{carmine and howard continue repairing the road, carmine still using the noisy jackhammer. val and earl drive up.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{you guys better get the hell outta here! we got a killer on the loose!}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{carmine stops jackhammering to listen.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{a murderer , man! a real psycho. he's cutting people's heads off! i'm serious! i'd high tail for town if i was you!}
<A>__{val and earl speed away.}
<C>__{carmine}
<D>__{they're drunk.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{yeah...}
<A>__{but he edges over to the truck and takes out a heavy steel pry bar to keep within easy reach. carmine goes back to work, pounding the asphalt with the jackhammer. suddenly the blade strikes something beneath the road, something soft. we hear a strange, unearthly shriek from underground. a weird orange goo gushes up around the blade. then the jackhammer takes off by itself like a harpoon stuck in a whale! carmine gets tangled in the jack hammer's air hose and is dragged along, shouting for help. howard chases him down the embankment and into the scrub brush. he hears carmine screaming.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{carmine! what the hell is it?! where are you?}
<A>__{but now there is only silence. howard crashes through the brush. all he finds is the torn end of the air hose which suddenly sucks down into the ground. he's momentarily staggered by an awful smell, but forces himself to keep looking. he lets the pry bar drag on the ground. then something it looks like a mouth or a horrid beak shoots out of the ground and grips the pry bar with uncanny strength! howard drops his weapon and scrambles madly away. he clambers back onto the road. but almost immediately cracks form in the pavement around him. more beak things break through the asphalt between him and his truck. he dashes across the road, scrambling up the embankment. he clings precariously to a tree root, looking down where'd they go? suddenly the dirt around him begins to "bubble." several hungry beaks break through and grab him, yanking him head first into the embankment. then the embankment gives way, crashing down onto the road, taking with it a nearby telephone pole and snapping the lines.}
