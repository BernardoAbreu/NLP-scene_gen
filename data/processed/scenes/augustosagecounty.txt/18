<T>__{intercut with:}
<B>__{inside the kitchen}
<D>__{ivy enters with her coffee cup, runs water in it at the sink. outside, her mother, sister, and bill on the back porch.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you can't think of anything unusual johnna sits at the kitchen table behind ivy. johnna stands, joins ivy at the sink. ivy hadn't seen her there.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{he hired this woman. he didn't ask me, just hired this woman to come live in our house. few days before he left.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{you don't want her here.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{she's a stranger in my house. there's an indian in my house. ivy looks to johnna, embarrassed. but johnna just takes ivy's cup from her, finishes cleaning it.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you have a problem with indians, violet?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i don't know what to say to an indian.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{they're called native americans now, mom.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{who makes that decision?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{it's what they like to be called.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{they aren't any more native than me.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{in fact, they are.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{what's wrong with indian?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{why's it so hard to call people }
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{let's just call the dinosaurs "native americans" while we're at it.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{she may be an indian, but she makes the best goddamn apple pie i ever ate. johnna smiles, nods to ivy. leaves the kitchen.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{he hired a cook. it doesn't make any sense. we don't eat.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{and now you get biscuits and gravy. kind of nice, huh?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{nice for you, now. but you'll be gone soon enough, never to return.}
<C>__{barbara}
<P>__{(a warning)}
<D>__{mom...}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{when was the last time you were here?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{don't get started on that }
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{really, i don't even remember.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{i'm very dutiful, mom, i call, i write, i send presents }
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you do not write }
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{presents on birthdays, mother's day ivy eavesdrops at the sink, unsure if she should stay or go.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{because you're "dutiful."}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{all right, now }
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i don't care about you two. i'd like to see my granddaughter every now }
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{well, you're seeing her now.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{but your father. you broke his heart when you moved away.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{that is wildly unfair. bill stands, picks up a plate, pushes his way back into the kitchen. ivy hears him coming, but doesn't have time to escape. goes to the refrigerator instead.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{am i going to have to separate you two?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you know you were beverly's favorite; don't pretend you don't know that. barbara follows bill. ivy finds iced tea, pours herself some. tries to make herself invisible it's not hard to do.}
<C>__{barbara }
<D>__{i'd prefer to think my parents loved all their children equally. violet trails behind them into the kitchen.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i'm sure you'd prefer to think that santy claus brought you presents at christmas, too. if you'd had more than one child, you'd know a parent always has favorites. mattie fae was my mother's favorite. big deal. i got used to it. you were your daddy's favorite. barbara notices ivy, standing there, christ. this isn't a conversation she'd like to be having in front of her sister. violet sees ivy too could care less.}
<C>__{violet }
<D>__{broke his heart.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{what was i supposed to do?! colorado gave bill twice the money he was making at tu }
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{why are we even getting into this?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{you think daddy wouldn't have jumped at the chance bill got?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you're wrong there. you never would've gotten beverly weston out of oklahoma.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{daddy gave me his blessing.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{`s what he told you.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{now you're going to tell me the true story, some terrible shit daddy said behind my back?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{hey, enough. everybody's on edge }
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{beverly didn't say terrible things behind your back }
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{vi, come on }
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{he just told me he's disappointed in you because you settled. he thought you had talent, as a writer.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{daddy never said anything like that to you. what a load of absolute horseshit.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{oh, horseshit, horseshit, let's all say horseshit. say horseshit, bill.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{horseshit. violet goes. barb and bill exchange a look. barb looks to ivy, who's blank. barb takes a beat, follows violet.}
