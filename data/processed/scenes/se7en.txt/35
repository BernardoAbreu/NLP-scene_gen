<L>__{interior precinct house, somerset's office morning}
<A>__{old office. moving boxes on the floor. the single window faces a billboard. somerset works on a manual typewriter. he types hunt and peck, slowly. his paperwork is on the desk in two sloppy piles. a jarring sound is heard offscreen, like fingers on a blackboard. somerset looks up, irritated. a workman is working at the open door, holding the source of the sound, a razor blade he's using to scrape the words detective somerset off the door's window.}
<C>__{workman}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{somerset turns back to typing. the captain steps in, looks at the workman, then drops more papers on somerset's desk. as always, the neatly groomed captain clenches his jaw. he looks around. two of boxes on the floor have detective mills written across them. the captain picks one up, puts it on top of the other. he sits, watching somerset, starts straightening the forms on the desk.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{what are you going to do with yourself out there, somerset?}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i will get a job. maybe on a farm. i will fix up my house.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{can't you feel it yet?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{can't you feel that feeling... that you won't be special anymore?}
<C>__{somerset}
<P>__{(lying)}
<D>__{i don't know what you mean.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{you know.}
<A>__{somerset reclines, looks at the captain.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{did you read in the paper today, about the man who took his dog for a walk? and how he was mugged? and, his wallet was taken, and his watch. then, while he was still lying unconscious, his attacker stabbed him with a knife in both eyes. it happened last night. not far from here.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{i heard.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i have no understanding of this place.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{it's always been like this.}
<A>__{somerset saddles up to the typewriter. hunt and peck.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{yes. you're absolutely right.}
<A>__{the captain lays the paperwork down in two neat stacks.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{you were made for this work, somerset. i can't believe you're going to trade it all in for a tool belt and a fishing rod. but, i guess i'm wrong.}
<A>__{the captain leaves. somerset looks up now that the captain's gone. he grabs the paper piles and ruffles them back to their disheveled state. he looks at the workman. the workman is looking at somerset, has a rag in his hand to remove the last remnants of somerset's name.}
<C>__{somerset}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{put a little elbow grease into it!}
<A>__{the workman is startled, continues his work.}
