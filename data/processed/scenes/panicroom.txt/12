<L>__{interior panic room day}
<A>__{from the opposite end of a lone, narrow, windowless space, we see the three of them standing in the open doorway, silhouetted by the sunlight streaming through the bedroom windows behind them.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{it's called a panic room.}
<A>__{he hits a switch and a row of bulbs flick on overhead.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{a what?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{a safe room. an inner sanctum. a castle keep, in medieval times.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{oh, i've seen these...}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{it's quite in vogue in high end construction right now. one really can't be too careful about home invasion.}
<A>__{the other two walk inside, but meg lingers near the door, looking around, studying the neatly arrayed survival supplies water, food packs, batteries, flashlights, tools, rope, clothes, blankets you get the idea.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{hey, this is perfect for you...}
<P>__{(meg scoffs)}
<D>__{absolutely! you're a woman, you're living alone now. your alarm goes off, or you head glass break, or for whatever reason you think someone's broken into your home in the middle of the night. what are you going to do? call the police and wait until they get here on tuesday? traipse downstairs in your sexy little underthings and check it out? i think not!}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{reinforced steel core walls. buried phone line, completely separate, not connected to the house's main line and never exposed throughout the house's infrastructure or outside the house you can call the police; nobody can cut you off. your own ventilation system, complete with oxygen scrubber, so you've got plenty of fresh air for as long as you like. and a bank of video monitors }
<A>__{he hits a switch next to a dozen tiny video monitors, revealing a dozen different views of the house.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{ covering almost every corner of the house.}
<A>__{meg nods, starting to sweat.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{makes me nervous.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{ever read any poe?}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{i don't think so, but i love her album.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{no, edgar allen.}
<C>__{lydia}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{the furniture guy?}
<C>__{meg}
<P>__{(giving up)}
<D>__{what's to keep them from prying open the door?}
<A>__{evan reaches past meg and pushes a red button on the wall behind her. with a sudden whang of steel, a heavy metal door leaps out of a slot in the wall and slams shut, like a submarine hatch. a series of metal latches click into place inside it, from top to bottom, securing it into place.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{steel, four inches thick.}
<A>__{meg takes a step back. they're now enclosed in the room.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{everything's spring loaded, even if the power's out it's fully functional.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{open it.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{old bernie didn't miss a trick with this room, did he?}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{open the door.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{and with kids like he's got, no wonder he wanted a place to hide.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{that's highly inappropriate.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{i said open the door.}
<A>__{evan hits a green button and the door groans slowly open, recoiling its massive spring, and revealing sarah, the little girl, standing in the entryway, grinning widely.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{my room. definitely my room.}
<A>__{she bolts in, just as her mother bolts out.}
