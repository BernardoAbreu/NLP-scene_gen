<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{village day the village of swanscombe is little more than a rough and ready collection of thatched huts and mud daubed outbuildings surrounded by cultivated fields. dogs sleep in open door ways; chickens peck around the communal well but there are no people in evidence as valerian and her company troop into town.}
<B>__{valerian}
<A>__{she trots across the square and enters a deserted blacksmith shop.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{father? hello?}
<A>__{she goes over to the forge. hot coals are burning. she becomes aware of a sound voices chanting.}
<B>__{square}
<A>__{she walks across the square toward the voices. she is joined by greil, malkin and the other travelers, all of them puzzled by the desolation. as they approach the grange hall the voices grow louder. they seem to be singing. the main doors open briefly and three villagers scamper out, dripping wet and wrapped in white muslin. valerian and her companions look at each other in astonishment.}
<B>__{in the grange hall}
<A>__{in a wooden cistern in the middle of the hall a woman is being held under water. after a few moments she is pulled to the surface by a tall red haired man with long bony fingers: brother jacopus januensis, a carthusian monk. there's a wooden cross on his chest and a mad look in his eye. gathered around him are the missing villagers, every man woman and child, here to be baptised and sing a few newly learned hymns in praise of our lord jesus christ.}
<C>__{brother jacopus}
<D>__{now are you cleansed of your sins! now are you born again, purified in spirit, into the fellowship of jesus christ!}
<A>__{the travelers enter and mingle with the congregation. valerian scans the crowd until she locates her father, simon, a balding sturdy journeyman. he's overjoyed at her return and gives her a hearty embrace.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{welcome back, my son.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{father, what are you doing? have you all lost your minds?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{some have.}
<A>__{he points to the monk, who is dunking a screaming infant and carrying on about the bishop of rome.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{it's this monk. he can read and write, and talk too, i'm afraid.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{and they listen?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{shh! they think this a holy place, a tabernacle.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{this is the granary. what kind of welcome is this? i've got news of the sorcerer and news of the dragon.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{you were brave to go, you and your friends. but nobody cares. listen he knows what they want to hear.}
<B>__{monk}
<A>__{brother jacopus strides back and forth before the assembly in an inspired state.}
<C>__{brother jacopus}
<D>__{the man who walks with christ is not a man to fear a dragon: yea, though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil! you say you are preyed upon by a foul beast. yes, but what is the nature of this beast? it comes to you on bat's wings and clawed feet, does it not? it breathes fire, does it not? and it lives under ground. this is no dragon. this is lucifer!}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{whoever it is, he's dead.}
<A>__{this is galen, who has just stepped into the hall, tattered, bedraggled and triumphant.}
<C>__{brother jacopus}
<D>__{nay, brother! it is not as easy as that. allegiance to christ, to be sure, but also prayer and confession. these are the arms by which satan may be put down.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{you're talking about superstition, friend. none of that has anything to do with what i, galen, have already achieved.}
<A>__{he marches to the center of the gathering.}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(to valerian)}
<D>__{you brought this stranger?}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{ulrich's apprentice. he's a braggart, but it doesn't matter.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{people of urland! send a messenger to the king. vermithrax is dead. crushed by the power of the moon and the stars! laid low by ancient wisdom. dropped into the abyss by mystical practice.}
<C>__{brother jacopus}
<D>__{spoken like a pagan. every word as reprobate as it is false!}
<P>__{(holding up his cross)}
<D>__{solum in hoc signo vinces!}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{nihil plus mysterium!}
<A>__{he gestures boldly and a fireball crackles at the monk's feet. the holy man scurries back. a hush falls upon the congregation.}
