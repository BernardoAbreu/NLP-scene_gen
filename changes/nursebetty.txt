<ACTION>__{A tense surgery in progress.  Meters flicker, instruments flash in the bright overhead light.  In the midst of it all stands DR. DAVID RAVELL, 35.  The master of his domain. Ravell leans forward so a NURSE can mop the sweat from his brow as he completes a last, delicate procedure.  His co workers sigh collectively with relief.}

<ACTION>__{Dr. Ravell comes out of surgery, clearly exhausted.  Without his surgical mask he is ruggedly handsome.  TWO NURSES follow, attending him like a fighter fresh from the ring: CHLOE, 25, Raven-haired and striking, and JASMINE, 24, an exotic mix of African-American and Asian. BLAKE DANIELS, 58, the silver-haired Chief Surgeon, rushes up the corridor.  On his heels is DR. LONNIE WALSH, 33. Lonnie is also conspicuously handsome, but he'll always be second to David.  In everything. The look on Blake's face stops David in his tracks.}

<LOC>__{INT. TIP TOP DINER - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Quaint, Midwestern eatery.  Knick-knacks and photos abound. The booths and counter are packed with LOCALS.  A family dining section off in one corner. TWO GUYS sitting at the counter in team jackets.  The older of the two holds up his empty coffee cup.  But his WAITRESS, standing a couple seats down from him, doesn't move. She's completely absorbed in watching the soap opera that plays on two battered, fuzzy TV sets. BETTY SIZEMORE, 30, has a wholesome attractiveness that competes with a bit too much makeup and a cheesy white waitress uniform. TWO OTHER WAITRESSES attend to customers behind her. The younger of the two guys is involved in the soap opera. But the older one, still wants coffee.  He gestures toward Betty.}

<DIAL>__{Miss?}

<DIAL>__{And half a pack, if I remember correct...}
<ACTION>__{The older gentleman's mouth works a bit but nothing comes out.  He is flabbergasted by her attention to detail.  She looks at the younger man, who is still following the show and gobbling down a huge bacon burger.}

<DIAL>__{No problem.}
<ACTION>__{Betty flashes the men a winning smile and moves off, one eye always on the TV as she approaches two local types. SHERIFF ELDEN BALLARD, 32, a short, tightly wound little man, sitting at his own booth.  Ballard is spit and polish all the way:  creases in his shirt, a glossy shine on his shoes. Badge proudly displayed.  He sits with ROY OSTREY, 31, a gangly, bookish local reporter.  Betty drops five ketchup packets and four mayonnaise packets on the table for him.  Another smile.}
<CHAR>__{ROY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hi, Betty.  You're looking good...}
<CHAR>__{BETTY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{I'm not some snot-nosed resident fresh out of medical school, Blake.}
<CHAR>__{BLAKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, you're not.  You're a good doctor, Lonnie, but you're not David Ravell. I've made my decision.  Now, if you'll excuse me ...}
<ACTION>__{Blake exits.  The camera moves in to hold on a CLOSEUP of Lonnie's face as he simmers in anger.  Music soars.}

<ACTION>__{Frustrated, Betty delivers several plates and drops them at tables where the people know her by name.  She moves off toward FOUR LOCAL GUYS in a booth jangling their empty cups. Betty weaves her way over to them and pours refills.  When a hand strays around to touch her ass, she pushes it away with her foot and keeps right on pouring. Absently, Betty takes a look around the restaurant.  The other waitresses are gone and no one is behind the grill.  Alarmed, she pushes through the double doors into the kitchen.}

<DIAL>__{Well, I paid for the damn thing, I oughta know. WAITRESS #2 C'mon, Betty!  Pose with him!}
<ACTION>__{Betty laughs and puts her arm around the cardboard man.  A flash photo is taken.  A cupcake with a single candle is placed in her hands.}
