<L>__{interior danny's apartment late afternoon}
<A>__{danny stops just inside the door. the place is spotless. the desk has been pulled out from the wall, covered with a snowy cloth and set for a sabbath meal: brass candelabrum, challah under a satin cover...and two place settings. carla is pouring wine into the kiddush cup. she's wearing a modest dress, her hair is pinned up with a piece of lace.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<A>__{she turns, startled; she hadn't heard him come in.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{it's erev yom kippur.... we'll have dinner, then go to shul. atone for our sins.}
<A>__{he grabs a couple of olives off the table, eats them as he goes through his closet, stuffing a couple things in a bag....}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{come on, we can be like eichmann. he studied torah. he hated jews.}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(in the closet, looking)}
<D>__{is it like eichmann? are we goofing?}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{i don't know. i just want to try it.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{shit...}
<P>__{(looking in other places)}
<D>__{did you talk to your mother today?}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{no. what are you looking for?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{nothing.}
<P>__{(indicates table as he keeps looking)}
<D>__{why are you doing this?}
<P>__{(back to the closet)}
<D>__{i thought god didn't exist.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{he commands it whether he exists or not...}
<P>__{(off his silence; with difficulty)}
<D>__{look, we can fight him and be crushed. or we can submit.}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(from the closet)}
<D>__{and be crushed.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{yeah, okay. but what if...what if... submitting...being crushed, being nothing, not mattering, what if that's the best feeling we can have?}
<A>__{he finds it (a kittel), stuffs it in the bag.}
<C>__{carla}
<D>__{look, just light the candles with me. then we'll eat. you have to eat.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you eat first, then you light.}
<P>__{(exasperated, he has to explain)}
<D>__{once you light, it's yom kippur, which means you're fasting, so you can't...eat.}
<A>__{he trails off, looks at her. she's everything he ever wanted, and he's already lost her.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{a woman of valor, who can find her? her price is above rubies....}
<A>__{he walks out, leaving the door open. carla starts to call after him, but then doesn't. she turns back, lights the candles and awkwardly reads the prayers....}
