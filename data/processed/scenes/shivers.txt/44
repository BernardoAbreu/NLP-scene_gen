<A>__{a young man aged about twenty five kurt, the delivery boy, dark, intense, bearded, his manner as stiff and formal as the tuxedo that he wears rolls a restaurant serving cart toward the main doors. he has obviously just come from the van outside, which is emblazoned with the words 'restaurant cote d'azur'. the doorman smiles and opens the door for kurt, obviously familiar with the restaurant. kurt takes great care as he lifts the cart slightly so that it clears the doormats. on the cart's two levels is an elaborate array of silver serving vessels and utensils.}
