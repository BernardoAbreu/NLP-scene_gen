<L>__{interior lecture hall berkeley day}
<A>__{the hall is full. on the stage, dr. helen hudson is speaking. helen is a forensic psychologist. behind her is a projected diagram: predisposition, dissociation, trauma, fantasy, violent fantasy, facilitators, murder, and trauma reinforcement which she can point to with a laser pointing device. we see her from a considerable distance... the back of the balcony. her voice is crisp and assured.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{our society creates these socially and psychically disenfranchised men, and their revenge on society is terrible. they are hard to catch. they are "the nice guy next door," their employers if they work at all find them quiet and uncomplaining. early abuse and rejection have taught them passivity. only in their violent fantasies do they feel alive. what they seek in their frenzied assaults on their victims is relief from passivity. for these men, ten minutes relief is worth far more than the life of another human being. torture, the pain they inflict, the screams of the victim, are all part of the ritual that gives them a brief respite from their own psychic pain. and then the depression, the forgetting, the feeling of sadness and despair begins the cycle all over again. like addicts seeking their drug, albert desalvo, bianchi and buono, berkowitz, dahmer, bundy they seek out their next victim.}
<A>__{during the second half of this speech, the eye of the camera has moved slowly forward until it settles just behind the balcony railing. closeup: helen}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{the cycle is endless until they are caught. and they are caught by chance they run a red light, and a body is in the trunk. a leaking pipe brings a plumber to a basement where they is the smell of death.}
<A>__{her eyes have come to rest on the spot of the camera eye in the balcony... her voice chokes off. she stares. helen's pov: sitting in the front row of the balcony, a young red headed man (daryll lee cullum) leans forward, resting his tattooed arms on the railing. he smiles intimately at helen. helen cuts her eyes to the left. she sees: backstage, an overweight cop in plain clothes. instantly alert to helen's alarm, he jumps up, comes within an inch of exposing his presence to the audience. a second cop, in the wings on the other side of the stage, also springs to attention. first cop's eyes follow helen's... their pov: the balcony young red headed man is no longer there. helen can she believe her eyes? resumes:}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{at any time, right now, as you listen, the fbi estimates there are 30 to 35 serial killers stalking their victims. the serial killer is a plaque that must be addressed not only by the law, but by science. florida spent eight million dollars to execute ted bundy. it would have been better spent building a forensic penal facility devoted to research.}
<A>__{once again her eyes fix on the balcony to reassure herself that the smiling man is not there...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{confined for life, without parole, and subjected to scientific study, these men's lives might finally, in some small measure, educate and thereby protect society. thank you.}
<A>__{applause as helen warily checks for the two cops. they are carefully casing the crowd.}
<T>__{cut to: later:}
<A>__{the crowd is breaking up. first cop walks helen to the ladies' room. people reach to shake helen's hand; she copes as well as she can with her fear. they leave the stage}

<L>__{interior ladies' room day}
<A>__{the cop, clearly embarrassed, pokes his head in and looks around. under one stall he sees a woman's high heels. he hastily ducks back into hall and signals an okay to helen. before the door behind her closes, we see the cop prepare to stand guard outside. helen walks past the stall with the high heels to a stall several doors down.}
<T>__{close up high heels:}
<A>__{and a tattoo that the cop missed seeing on one of the ankles. the shoes are kicked off. the feet disappear from view as helen, a few stalls away, methodically places toilet paper around the seat before raising her skirt. a faint noise makes her freeze. her hand reaches for the door. she is just able to unlock it, but no more, before a noise comes}
<B>__{down from the next stall.}
<A>__{like a lariat it falls over helen's head and is violently yanked tight. she kicks at the stall door. corridor: cop, leaning against outside door smoking, hears the clang of metal as the stall door bangs open. he reacts... the red headed man is struggling to secure the rope around a hook inside his own stall. knocking (o.s.)}
<C>__{cop }
<D>__{doctor hudson? are you okay in there?}
<A>__{the man lets slip a little slack. helen's fingers, thrusting between the rope and her neck, get just enough air for helen to let out a strangled little scream. corridor: cop, not certain what to do about the ambiguous sounds from inside. women stands nearby, inhibiting him for a split second from going in the ladies' room door. now there is more sound from inside...}
<L>__{interior ladies room continuous}
<A>__{cop steps into the room, gun down. over the cop's shoulder we see helen hanging in open booth, her hand fluttering at her throat. she has one slippery shoeless foot on the toilet seat. cop takes a couple of steps forward. behind cop's back we see a broom closet door opening. helen's pov: close up: the cop, taken from behind. in a second, his throat is slit. in a gush of blood, he falls, his gun still in his hand. red headed man standing over the fallen cop, smiling at}
<B>__{helen.}
<A>__{cop's body is twitching, jerking. the violent contractions in his fingers cause the gun to go off... one... two shots, the sound reverberating against the tile walls.}

<A>__{the audience and second cop react to the gunshots. helen, her eyes bulging, struggling against the rope.}

<A>__{as helen, in bed, bolts up from the nightmare, her hands try desperately to pull the dream rope from her neck. she is now pale, her hair is dirty, there are deep circles under her eyes. this is a woman in the throes of a breakdown.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{andy! andy!}
<A>__{she races through this loft apartment (the walls are eight feet under a twelve foot ceiling) to study opening off a hall. she looks in, gasping for breathing...}
<L>__{interior study continuous}
<A>__{the room is neat nobody there. (we will later see that it is used on and off by her computer, andy.) helen whimpers in frustration; she is alone. she talks to herself as she turns back and moves past a living room, where she turns on lights and the tv flicks on, (court tv.) the sound comes up, loud... she moves on... trying to calm herself with the sound of her own voice...}

<D>__{it is october twelfth, 1994 in the city of san francisco, california, u.s.a., the strongest, richest, most stable and happiest country in the world. that is the sole place of life in the universe. under god.}
<A>__{close: xanax bottle. two pills are shaken out into a palm, others scattering from the nervous haste... close: helen watching herself in bathroom mirror as she tosses down the pills, gulps water. she regards her haggard reflection with a certain detachment...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{good god. what happened to you?}
<A>__{she barks a rueful laugh... we are seeing a woman will herself from near hysteria to relative calm...}

<A>__{hall as she exits the bathroom. and moves into her office. she pours herself a brandy and stands before two computers. of the side by side computer screens, one is blank. the other shows a chess setup. flashing on the bottom of the screen comes a command.}
<C>__{chessmaster}
<D>__{'it's almost seven. make a goddam move.'}
<A>__{she studies the chess set up for a moment, then makes a move. she has not even hit the keyboard of the other computer before chessmaster sends another message.}
<C>__{chessmaster}
<D>__{'lousy move. not really into this game, helen. let's drop it. i've got a feeling about you. let's meet. like a date.'}

<D>__{'maybe it's better to just dream on; avoid the disappointments of life. come on, move.'}
<A>__{she pushes a button on the remote, and we see the window curtains open. bright sunlight streams in! we see that the t shirt helen wears says "shrinks 'r' us." she crosses to the window with her glass of cognac, looks out.}

<A>__{a sweeping view of the bay, and across to marin county. the morning sun is dispelling the last of the night's fog. helen opens window, puts a hand outside, trying to feel the air, the freedom. feeling quite restored from the dream horror of the night... o.s., the phone rings. helen. a frisson. close: phone her hand comes into frame and picks up the handset and carries camera to closeup helen.}

<B>__{muzzle of semi automatic pistol blasts nine shots almost directly into camera. a beat of silence...}
<A>__{the target: it is a silhouette of a man's head and torso; centered in the right side of the upper chest, near the shoulder, is a small red circle. still smoking, the holes from the bullets are scattered all over the chest, and none in the circle.}

<D>__{my third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.}
<A>__{the shooter, ruben goetz, and partner m.j.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{yeah, but she had divine guidance.}
<A>__{we now take in the shooter, ruben, and his companion m.j. halloran. m.j. is a small, deceptively vulnerable looking young woman. she is neat, buttoned down, crisp. m.j. appears to be about twenty five. she is, in fact, thirty four and a homicide inspector with the rank of sergeant. she is usually dressed in slacks and a loose sweater or an oversize jacket that helps make her appear even smaller and younger than she is. ruben goetz is also in homicide, about twenty six and junior in authority to m.j. ruben is good looking, good humored and laid back. he has a cellular phone attached to his belt. m.j. pulls the line that dollies the target back to them,}
<B>__{and ruben replaces it with another as they talk.}
<C>__{m.j.}

<D>__{well, he's dead, he can't hurt me now.}
<A>__{the target is rigged; they pull the line that dollies it back to shooting position.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{it's sloppy shooting. it's in character, ruben, but unnecessary. and bad for your career.}
<A>__{ruben lets off three quick shots: they cluster nearer the circle. m.j. looks at him in surprise.}

<A>__{she fires! the shots make a perfect heart around the circle, inside his looser pattern. one final shot strikes exactly in the middle!}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{you're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone. i joined the cops to save lives, not waste them.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{you know, m.j., when i watch you shoot, i realize i've got a little problem with my stance... could you just move over here and critique my legs?}
<A>__{he slaps his thigh where he indicates the trouble might be. she is unloading her weapon...}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{the problem is between your legs. you told your shrink about that?}
