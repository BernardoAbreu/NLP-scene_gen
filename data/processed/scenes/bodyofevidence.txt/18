<L>__{exterior river afternoon}
<A>__{gray clouds hang overhead, threatening rain. tall birch trees line the river, the color of their leaves hinting that autumn is approaching. dulaney and rebecca walk along a jogging path cut along the bank.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{i want you to know right now that the trial's going to be nasty. your sex life is going to be dragged through the mud. they're going to say that you enticed marsh led him down a dark path.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{andrew hardly needed leading. he was a very passionate man. he was eager to explore. i gave him what he wanted. we fulfilled each others needs.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{this is a very small town people here have very straight views on sex.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i'm used to being on the outside looking in. the same men who will publicly profess their moral outrage for my sexual tastes are the same ones who privately rest their sweaty little hands on my legs and talk about weekend trips together.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{those same men will be sitting on the jury.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i am who i am. i can't deny it, anymore than you can deny who you are. i like sex different i like it wild. that's not a crime.}
<P>__{(emotional)}
<D>__{i loved andrew. we made love together. we made it differently, but we still made love. it was our way. it was private and now the whole world wants to look in through the pretense of justice. if i was some middle aged divorcee who screwed him once a week do you think this would be happening to me?}
<A>__{she stops walking and stares out over the river.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{have you ever seen animals make love, mr. dulaney? they have such passion such savage emotion. they struggle, and snarl, and claw, but neither hurts the other. not really.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{no pain, no gain?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{something like that.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{we're not animals.}
<A>__{as rebecca speaks, dulaney seems captivated.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{of course we are. our primal urges are still there but we've taken sex and intellectualized it, refined it down to its most essential components. it's bland, easy, mechanical. there's great passion in the struggle such craving in denial. do you know what it's like to yearn for something? i'm not talking about wanting, or needing. i'm talking about an urge so deep that your skin burns and every cell in your body pulses with desire?}
<A>__{dulaney appears moved by the passion of her words but he's uncomfortable by it and quickly pushes it aside.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<P>__{(awkwardly)}
<D>__{i think we're getting a little off the subject here.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i thought the subject was sex?}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{as it pertains to you not me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{did you always know you had different... tastes?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i don't know if it's something i can explain to you.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{because it's beyond intellect. it's emotion. it's passion. it has to be experienced it can't be imagined.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{try.}
<A>__{rebecca thinks for a moment.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{when i was growing up we had a strawberry patch in our backyard. so did this family down the road. i used to sneak in their yard and steal their strawberries. it wasn't easy. the stone walls were high and i'd scrape my knees as i climbed over. on the other side were wild rose bushes. the thorns would dig into my legs and cut my thighs as i lowered myself down.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{if you had what you wanted at home why did you sneak into their yard?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{because somehow the fruit always tasted that much sweeter because of the pain it took to get to it.}
<A>__{dulaney appears lost in her words. this isn't lost on rebecca. she walks off. dulaney stares after her intrigued.}
