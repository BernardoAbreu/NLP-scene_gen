<L>__{interior yasnaya polyana. library. day.}
<A>__{alone now among tolstoy's books, valentin makes his way slowly to a writing table, the holy of holies, on which war and peace and anna karenina were written. he runs his hand along the old wood top. emboldened by a backward glance, he sits in tolstoy's chair. before him are stacks of letters, pens and pencils, a pot of india ink. there's a notebook lying open. he leans forward to read it. a noise in the hall stops him. tolstoy enters from the dining room, red cheeked, beard dripping wet, the energy of a man ten years younger than he is. valentin stands.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{i'm glad you're here. so glad.}
<A>__{he tromps across the room, kisses the boy enthusiastically on both cheeks. valentin is overcome by the great man's warmth.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{i'm... i'm... here is }
<A>__{valentin interrupts himself with a sneeze.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{god bless you.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{i'm sorry. sometimes i...}
<A>__{valentin pulls out a letter of introduction. tolstoy takes it out and puts it down without a glance.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{vladimir grigorevich has already written about you at length. i need your help badly. the manifesto against the government is hard work. they commit their idiotic abuses faster than i can catalogue them...and the new book...}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{he told me about it...it's very exciting.}
<A>__{tolstoy nods.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{i've become convinced that all the world's religions have a single organizing principle. can you guess what it is? love! love! simple... now, i want to talk about you. how are you? how was your journey? come, sit down.}
<A>__{tolstoy sits on the old sofa. valentin follows suit.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{you know, i was born on this sofa...}
<A>__{valentin gets right back up. tolstoy laughs, pats the sofa.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{sit. sit.}
<A>__{valentin sits down.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{myself, my brother, my children, at least five or six of them, right here.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now, i've read your essays. how`s your work progressing?}
<A>__{valentin looks into the great man's kind old face. he tries to speak but he's overcome with emotion and begins to weep.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{my boy, what is it?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i upset you in some way. was it the sofa? it's only a sofa.}
<A>__{valentin shakes his head, smiling through his tears.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{i'm very happy. you are very kind. i'm no one and you are... you are leo tolstoy and you ask me about my work.}
<A>__{tolstoy takes valentin's hand, sits him back on sofa.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{you rest for a moment and i will fetch you a glass of tea. rest, because there's work for both of us together.}
<A>__{he smiles and goes, leaving valentin to contemplate his fortune.}
