<A>__{sarah doesn't need to be told twice. t 1000 walks toward them, opening fire with the browning hi power. terminator straight arms the 12 guage like a pistol and fires. the stunned orderlies flop face down on the floor as the corridor is filled with high velocity lead. one of them, stupidly running for the cross corridor, gets hit by the t 1000. terminator is hammered by several slugs, and the t 1000 is cratered by two buckshots hits. it staggers, but comes on. in the craters we see bright mercury before they close and reseal, disappearing in a second.}
