<A>__{the maitre d' enters from the kitchen and is stunned to find the restaurant incredibly stuffed with people, so there's standing room only. people are even sitting on tables. it's a very eclectic mix of people. an angry, stuffy old man and his wife and daughter sit horrified at the center. arthur's flanked by carmella the prostitute and sofia from the atm line.}
