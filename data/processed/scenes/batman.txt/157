<L>__{interior vicki's apartment a moment later}
<A>__{bruce is nowhere in sight. vicki is at the sink washing dishes, acting nonchalant. she pretends not to hear the door unlocking behind her. she turns and faces the three advancing thugs.}
<C>__{thug i}
<D>__{hi, miss vale. let's not put up a fight, huh? 'cause we'd hate to have to }
<A>__{bruce steps into the doorway behind them. with a single sweep of the arm, he flings three drug tipped ninja wheels at the thugs, catching one in the neck, one in the shoulder, one in the hip. they collapse in quick succession.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{there's a garage in this building?}
<A>__{vicki nods yes. bruce all business now that he's in his element disappears into vicki's bedroom. she peeks around the corner. he reemerges carrying a black nylon stocking, which he stuffs into his pocket. vicki is full of question, but he shushes her before she can speak.}
<C>__{bruce }
<D>__{i've got to take him out now.}
<A>__{he stoops down beside the thugs and pulls the elevator key off the key ring which he then tosses to vicki.}
<C>__{bruce }
<D>__{pick an apartment and stay there. and listen: call the police. give them that address. every available man.}
<A>__{he starts out the door, stops just long enough to take a dumbfounded vicki in his arms for a kiss.}
