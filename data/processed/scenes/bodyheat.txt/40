<A>__{racine comes in, beat. he throws his jacket across a chair. out the windows to the porch, the sun is rising out of the atlantic. racine goes there and closes the curtains. in the gloom he walks to his bed and sits on the edge, kicking off his shoes. he picks up his alarm clock and begins setting it.}
<L>__{exterior walker house lawn gazebo night}
<A>__{racine has just parked his car and is walking back across the lawn. matty is standing in the gazebo, her back turned, looking out at the waterway. she is dressed in white and from here she looks very much as she did when they first met. there are wind chimes hanging from the gazebo.}
