<L>__{interior coffee shop afternoon}
<A>__{because of the hour the room is not crowded. only a few people sit at the counter sipping coffee. a waitress, 50's, bee hive hair style, face covered in make up arrives at the table.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{ready to order?}
<A>__{julien looks up at her.}
<C>__{julien}
<D>__{could we see a wine list please?}
<C>__{waitress}
<P>__{(smirks)}
<D>__{that's cute.}
<C>__{sophie}
<D>__{they don't have a wine list.}
<C>__{julien}
<D>__{oh, then we will have the house wine.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{sure and would you like that before your escargot in white truffle sauce?}
<C>__{julien}
<D>__{i did not order escargot.}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{they don't serve wine here.}
<C>__{julien}
<D>__{what kind of restaurant doesn't serve wine?}
<C>__{sami}
<D>__{this kind.}
<C>__{julien}
<D>__{okay. i will have a beer.}
<C>__{waitress}

<C>__{julien}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{c'est quoi root beer?}
<C>__{daniel}
<D>__{he'll have a sprite. we'll all have sprite.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{good. now that we've gotten the beverage selection out of the way, dare we move on to the main course?}
<C>__{zero}
<D>__{idiot.}
<A>__{zero grins as he puts a cigarette in his mouth. the waitress pulls it out of his mouth.}
<C>__{waitress}
