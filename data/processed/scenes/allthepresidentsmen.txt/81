<A>__{a man sitting on his haunches between the cars, smoking. he leans with his back against the wall.}
<C>__{deep throat}
<D>__{i saw the flag signal what's up?}
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{nothing, that's the problem the story's gone underground.}
<C>__{deep throat}
<D>__{you thought i'd help out on specifics?}
<P>__{(headshake)}
<D>__{i will confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all.}
<P>__{(looks at woodward)}
<D>__{are you guys really working?}
<P>__{(woodward nods)}
<D>__{how much?}
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{i don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day we've got sources at justice, the fbi, but it's still drying up.}
<C>__{deep throat}
<D>__{then there must be something, mustn't there. look, forget the myths the media's created about the white house the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.}
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{if you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?}
<C>__{deep throat}
<D>__{because the press stinks too history on the run, that's all you're interested in.}
<P>__{(inhales)}
<D>__{you come up with anything?}
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{john mitchell resigned as head of creep to spend more time with his family. that doesn't exactly have the ring of truth.}
<P>__{(deep throat nods)}
<D>__{howard hunt's been found there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.}
<C>__{deep throat}
<D>__{follow the money. always follow the money.}

<C>__{deep throat}
<P>__{(lights a new cigarette)}
<D>__{you changed cabs? you're sure no one followed you?}
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{i did everything you said, but it all seemed }
<C>__{deep throat}
<D>__{ melodramatic?}
<P>__{(headshakes)}
<D>__{things are past that remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were dodge city.}
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{what's the whole thing about do you know?}
<C>__{deep throat}
<D>__{what i know, you'll have to find out on your own.}
<C>__{woodward}
<D>__{liddy you think there's a chance he'll talk?}
<C>__{deep throat}
<D>__{talk? once, at a gathering, he put his hand over a candle. and he kept it there. he kept it right in the flame until his flesh seared. a woman who was watching asked, "what's the trick?" and he replied. "the trick is not minding."}
<A>__{deep throat shakes his head, walks off. woodward stands alone now, watching. now the shadows have the other man. just his footsteps are audible. woodward stands there... hold.}
