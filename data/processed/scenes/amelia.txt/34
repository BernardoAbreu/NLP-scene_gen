<L>__{exterior shore, burry port, wales day}
<A>__{the little plane sputtering, shuddering, as bill drops in for a splashdown. we pan to the shore... ...a rural railroad dock. deserted except for three workers who glance up as the friendship taxis to a buoy a few hundred yards offshore. amelia at the hatch, tiny in distance, waves a towel... ...one friendly worker takes off his coat and waves back. then all three guys go back to work. snap to... reverse angle. from the friendship, we watch the workers ignoring us. bill and slim holler and jump up and down on the pontoons. nobody cares. amelia sits in the doorway, her legs swinging free.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{out of gas. may have to swim for it.}
<A>__{later. amelia alone. six pages written by her side. still working, as a rowboat pulls up. bill stands in the bow. calls to her...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{mr. putnam phoned. he says there's a fella coming from london. hilton railey.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{oh, yeh. very important man. more important than any of us.}

<C>__{bill}
<D>__{he says ya mustn't come ashore til he gets here. no matter what.}
<A>__{great. she doesn't like it, but there it is. she waves, so long.}

<D>__{some kind of royalty, is he?}
<A>__{she nods.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{public relations.}
<A>__{goes back to work. dissolve to: later. amelia sits with her papers in her lap, dangling her feet from the hatch. alone. hear the buzz of... ...a plane dropping slowly from the sky, gliding onto the water on its pontoons. she stares at it. gathers up her things. later. amelia sitting in a tiny dinghy, behind her the friendship in distance. she is being rowed to shore. our view is over the back of the man rowing. amelia is staring past him, vaguely apprehensive. reverse angle. she's looking at two thousand welshmen swarming the docks. you can't even see the sand. the crowd is silent and staring. no cheers. as if they were staring at an alien or an animal in the zoo. bill and slim help pull the dinghy to the rocky shore. but when amelia jumps out, the crowd... ...begins to soberly applaud, and slowly closes in around her. at first she seems pleased, trying to shake every hand thrust toward her. she doesn't see that bill and slim have been shunted to the back. suddenly... ...people get bolder. clapping her on the back, reaching to touch her, someone snatches her scarf, she looks around frantically for bill and slim as... ...a sheriff and three deputies muscle their way to her using billy clubs to push people back. they surround amelia, begin to escort her to the station...}

<P>__{sheriff (cont’d)}
<D>__{because you're stuck with it. from here on.}
<A>__{she is brought to a smiling avuncular hilton railey, standing beside the closest thing burry port has to a limo. she throws an affectionate arm around him, kisses his cheek.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{hullo, hilton.}
<A>__{railey stands back as flashbulbs catch the moment. he's brought photographers with him. and more.}
<C>__{railey}
<D>__{amelia, say hullo to allen raymond of the new york times.}
<A>__{a hearty handshake. she holds out her sheets of paper.}
