<L>__{exterior coast guard station, los angeles morning}
<A>__{a coast guard station overlooking the pacific. a lone woman leans on a railing. from the station, a man emerges, he has... ...a thermos and two large mugs. he pours steaming coffee into each, and brings them to the woman at the rail. she has turned to study him as he approaches.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{hullo, fred. it's good to meet you.}
<A>__{she holds out her hand. he juggles the mugs, so he can shake it. strong look in each other's eyes. hands her a mug...}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{i hear you like your coffee black.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{this time of day, i like it with bacon and eggs.}
<A>__{his slight grin. a handsome guy.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{be right back.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{over easy on the eggs. your job could depend on it.}
<A>__{silence between them. comfortable smiles.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{are we sizing me up?}
<A>__{and, of course, this is exactly what she's doing.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{i'm told that mid air refueling would be beyond my abilities.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{maybe, maybe not. 20% it works. 20% you crash. 60% you don't get the fuel, so you're cooked anyway.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{better odds of hitting that island?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{how do you feel about 100%?}
<A>__{watching his eyes as he says that. evaluating.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{even with cloud cover?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{i've crossed the pacific by air 18 times. pan am told you i'm the best celestial navigator they've ever seen.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{they did.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{someone else told you i have a drinking problem. which is a big part of why we're here, yes?}
<A>__{no answer.}
<P>__{fred (cont’d)}
<D>__{pan am will tell you. everyone i ever worked for will tell you. nothing's interfered with my performance. not once.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{my dad drank. he lied all the time. rest his soul.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{you trusted bill stultz. that worked out. rest his soul.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{bill just had to find europe. we're looking for something less than two miles long, with nothing higher on it than 18 feet.}
<A>__{he shakes his head.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{that's what you're looking for. i'm looking for coordinates on a map. and if it doesn't work...}
<A>__{he spreads his large hands...}
<P>__{fred (cont’d)}
<D>__{money back guarantee.}
<A>__{she holds the look.}
