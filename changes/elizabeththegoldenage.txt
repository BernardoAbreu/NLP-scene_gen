<ACTION>__{Philip walks rapidly down a long corridor that opens out into a broader hallway, moving from the darkness of the chapel into ever brighter light and more visible glory. On his face the far shining gaze of a man who now knows his mission. Silent servants press themselves to the walls as he goes by. Through the hallway to a grand salon. COURTIERS fall silent and bow as he passes. So into the grandest salon of all, where his magnificent court is gathered; among them his 12-year-old daughter, the INFANTA. As he enters, all kneel. His eyes scan his ministers and courtiers, all kneeling, heads bowed before him. His gaze falls on one who wears the plain black robes of a Jesuit priest: Robert Reston, the face we glimpsed in the opening montage. He speaks to all.}

The Infanta is by his side. His MINISTERS cluster behind him. Lining the crowd on either side of the plaza stand columns of ARMED SOLDIERS: a formidable reminder of the king's power. Philip does nothing, but his presence intoxicates the crowd. As their cries swell, wave upon wave, the king's eyes glow and he breathes in deeply, feeding on his people's adoration.}

Two young men walking arm-in-arm stare more intently than any; but they do not cheer or wave. There's something chilling in the way they track the distant figure of the Queen.
