<L>__{interior trailer night}
<A>__{view out a window at the line of headlights still arriving. we are immersed in the ungodly white noise of an all gentleman's newfie soiree, music pushed beyond the level of distortion, assorted grunts, squeals, unintelligible words, things breaking. as we struggle to look around... ...every square inch is crammed tight with semi conscious drunks. tert card and some boys circle the potato chip barrel, which has become a handy urinal. near the door, dennis holding forth, arm tight around quoyle who listens, listens, chuckles. then quoyle fights his way... ...out of the trailer, to cold night air where the party is much wilder, given the elbow room. quoyle steps over the supine form o billy pretty, who is singing to himself. finds jack buggit with a beer in one hand a rum in the other. wraps a drunken arm around jack's neck. starts to talk in his ear. jack looks suspicious. a fight breaks out a few feet away. they don't notice. closing in, to hear...}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{so the next day, they all sit down on the girder. the brit opens his lunch box. 'oh, no! scotch salmon again! farewell, boys!' and he jumps off the girder to his death.}
<A>__{jack nods. grins. that's pretty funny.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{the quebec guy opens his lunch box. 'mon dieu! meat pie again! au revoir cruel world!' and he jumps.}
<A>__{this. is even funnier.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{now the statie is all alone on the girder. he opens his box. 'holy moley! bologna sandwich again! i don't have to take this!' and leaps off.}
<A>__{funniest yet. jack is chuckling already.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{at the funeral. the brit' s wife says, 'why didn't he tell me he hated salmon?' frenchy's wife says, 'why didn't he complain about the meat pie?' statie's wife says, 'i don't get it. he always made his own lunch!'}
<A>__{quoyle is chortling. but jack stares him dead in the eyes.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you're sure. the feller was a statie.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{oh, yar. from new hampshire.}
<A>__{at which point jack busts out laughing fit to wet his pants...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{made his own lunch!}
<A>__{pounding on poor quoyle, who is also dissolved in hysterics. nearby, the biggest and ugliest guy at the party (no small distinction) leaps onto a tree stump brandishing an axe. even in this crowd, it commands a certain degree of attention.}
<C>__{big ugly guy}
<D>__{now we all loves old fookin' nutbeem, yar???}
<A>__{cries of yar! fill the woods. nutbeem himself is hoisted on shoulders, whooping and sloshing his grog.}
<C>__{big ugly guy}
<D>__{so less keep 'im 'ere byes! axe 'is fookin' boat! got yer chain saw, neddie??}
<A>__{an idea that wins immediate mass approval. soused nutbeem's eyes open bug wide, as he is borne in a tidal wave of mayhem toward the docks. whatever he is shrieking may well prove ineffective. and rather suddenly. quoyle is left alone. among the conscious, that is.}
