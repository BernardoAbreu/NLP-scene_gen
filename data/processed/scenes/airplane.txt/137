<D>__{now, elaine, right next to the throttle is the air speed gauge. what speed does it indicate?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{three hundred twenty miles per hour.}
<A>__{insert air speed gauge}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{we see, but elaine does not notice, the automatic pilot very slowly beginning to deflate.}
<P>__{mccroskey (v.o.)}
<D>__{good. now check your altitude. that's the dial just below and to the right of the air speed indicator.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{thirty five thousand feet.}
<A>__{insert altimater altitude is dropping.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{no, wait. now it says thirty four thousand feet. it's dropping! it's dropping fast! why is it doing that?}
<A>__{by now the automatic pilot is really slumped over as it is quite deflated. it is staring at her with a half smile. elaine notices it.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{oh, my god! the automatic pilot! it's deflating!}
<P>__{mccroskey (v.o.)}
<D>__{all right, elaine, don't worry. we have an auxiliary inflation system. just follow my instructions.}
<C>__{elaine}
