<L>__{interior church night}
<A>__{white walks in, sits on a pew, towards the back of the room, glances over his shoulder. he tries to blend in with the small gathering of people sitting silently around him. a priest appears at the altar, cloaked in a blood red robe, followed by two altar boys also in red. they move past a statue of an insect like creature, walk in circles chanting softly, stop and stare at the congregation through eye slits in their hoods. the priest begins his sermon.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{beware! the night is deadly. there is a criminal among us.}
<A>__{white looks forward. tight on the priestis hand it rises, points, moves over the heads of the congregation, accusingly. suddenly the red finger jabs towards an old woman in the front row.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{it could be she! the innocent across the street!}
<A>__{all the congregation turn and stare at the woman. sheis terrified. the hand moves slowly now, across to a beautiful japanese woman several rows back.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{or the temptress next door!}
<A>__{the priest pauses dramatically then:}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{or mister nervy stranger at the back!}
<A>__{suddenly the finger is pointing at white. all the faces turn, stare suspiciously at white. angle on white frozen with fright. fortunately his face is obscured by shadow and the priest lowers his hand, continues the sermon. the people look away.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{you are thinking it could be anyone? and youire right! why, it could even be mother!}
<A>__{white goes to leave. as he stands he notices the doors of the church open two figures step in and move into the candle light. mystery men whiteis bizarre pursuers. they look around. white ducks down, crawls between pews, startling several of the congregation. he motions to them to keep quiet. he runs into the legs of the beautiful woman the priest pointed out. she is startled momentarily but looks down at him, smiles.}
<C>__{priest }
<D>__{evil stalks our streets. it seeks to hide in our hearts. have you not evil within you now?}
<A>__{white sees a nearby confession box. staying low, he runs, almost knocks over a large illuminated candle holder, darts inside. the girl watches him. a gaunt faced woman stands. hysterical. she looks at the priest.}
<C>__{gaunt woman}
<D>__{he took my little boy! iill rip out his eyes!}
<A>__{inside white breaths relief. his p.o.v. carved on the dark stained wood in front of him is a crucified insect. a voice surprises him. another priest,}
<B>__{older.}
<C>__{older priest}
<D>__{you have sinned?}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{no. ah...}
<A>__{white watches the two mystery men walk past, through the ornate wooden grill in front of his face.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{i am listening.}
<C>__{white }
<D>__{thereis a... woman. i don't know but i think i, ahh...}
<C>__{priest}

<A>__{the mystery men look towards the box for a moment, towards white, but keep walking.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{no. i, ah...}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{you seem restless.}
<A>__{the mystery men seem to have gone. white takes out the gun, keeping it hidden from the priest. opens the chamber. tight on the gun only one bullet left.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{someoneis after me.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{then we must call the police.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{no. i mean... that isnit necessary.}
<A>__{the silhouette on the other side of the box leans forward.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{i see. then who is after you? what sins have you committed?}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{just let me sit here for a moment? iill go soon, and stop bothering you.}
<A>__{the priest suddenly stares incredulously at white. his eyes widen in horror.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{youire the murderer?}
<P>__{(starts to yell)}
<D>__{yes! that must be it! donit kill me!}
<A>__{white lunges, grabs his collar with one hand, slaps the other over his mouth. the old man stares at him, trembling uncontrollably.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{shut up! listen. walk out quietly.}
<P>__{(holds up gun)}
<D>__{understand?}
<A>__{the priest nods stupidly. white pushes him out of the confession box, grabs his coat from behind, puts the gun to his back. together they head for the doors. still no sign of the mystery men.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{donit kill me!}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{shut up!}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{please...}
<A>__{white loses his temper, grabs the priest, shakes him violently.}
<C>__{white }
<D>__{iim not going to kill you, okay!}
<A>__{faces turn. the priest kicks white in the leg, bites his hand. while white is wincing in pain, the priest breaks away.}
<P>__{priest (shouting pointing)}
<D>__{criminal!}
<A>__{people start to scream and run. the gaunt woman points at white.}
<C>__{gaunt woman }
<D>__{itis him! rip out his eyes!}
<A>__{frightened, white holds the gun out. everyone panics, scatters. people run for the exit. religious statues topple and smash. the gaunt woman is pushed screaming to the floor, trampled by the crowd. amidst the chaos, the two mystery men appear across the room, see white, head towards him. he turns and runs.}
