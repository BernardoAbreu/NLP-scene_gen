<P>__{(frightened)}
<D>__{what do you want?}

<C>__{mike }
<D>__{it's just me. i want to talk to you. let me in...}
<A>__{the lock turns and it opens, but just a crack, enough to see that she's hysterical, her eyes reddened from crying.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{you put me life in danger.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{no, you'll be safe. we're gonna pick him up again...}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{and then what? i will never be safe. i will have to leave the country! you can't protect me, and you can't keep him in jail! and you knew that all the goddamn time!}
