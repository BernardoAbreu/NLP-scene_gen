<L>__{132 sanitation truck. inside. day.}
<A>__{the name of the street cleaner is sadek. he seems frightened. he looks around, hesitates before speaking.}
<C>__{sadek}
<D>__{then the beach is okay, ali.}
<A>__{silence. sadek looks at him again, waiting, but ali does not respond. ali looks straight ahead at the street bathed in sunlight, the tar that seems to be liquid, the villas that surround algiers, the lemon trees, the oleanders ... then he speaks, but without turning to sadek. he speaks in a whisper, his eyes continually staring straight ahead.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{we need two more, the biggest ones.}
<C>__{sadek}
<D>__{and the others?}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{the others ... let's wait and see.}
<A>__{sadek remains silent for a while.}
<C>__{sadek}
<D>__{i've looked, ali, even where i work. nothing. the ones who have not been arrested have left algiers and gone into the mountains ... and the others don't want to hear any more about it ... they're afraid ...}
<A>__{ali doesn't answer him. silence.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{can't you go any faster?}
<C>__{sadek}
<D>__{yes, sure ... here.}
<A>__{sadek puts the truck in third gear, accelerates the motor, then shifts back again into fourth gear. the truck increases its speed. the road is straight, the outskirts of algiers are visible.}
<C>__{sadek}
<D>__{if we don't find any others ... should we call it off?}
<A>__{ali turns suddenly to look at him but says nothing. sadek can feel those eyes on him, and tries to justify himself.}
<C>__{sadek}
<D>__{we can't plant all of them by ourselves ...}
<A>__{ali speaks to him in a dry and indifferent voice.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{you don't have to plant anything. you only have to carry them, that's all.}
