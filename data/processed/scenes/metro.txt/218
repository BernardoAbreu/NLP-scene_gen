<L>__{exterior mccall's pov day}
<A>__{the car explodes from the building, glass flying, the car rolling, flipping over, coming to a rest on its wheels, driver's side away from mccall's position.}
<L>__{interior machine shop day roper}
<A>__{on the floor, recovering. he catches a quick glimpse of the bottom section of the lathe, a gearbox, the gears turning...}
<B>__{the lathe}
<A>__{turning, the cutting blade inching towards ronnie...}
<B>__{roper}
<A>__{staggers to his feet, grabbing the control box, pressing the button... nothing happens, the lathe still turning, sparks coming out of the box, it's shorting... only a few more seconds... desperately his eyes search the floor, seeing a huge wrench. he grabs the wrench, jamming it between the gears in the gearbox, the gears shuddering violently, threatening to crush the wrench... roper runs to ronnie's side, frantically pulling at her bonds, the cutting blade now paused an inch away from her...}
<B>__{the gearbox}
<A>__{hammering and clanking, the wrench can't last a heartbeat longer...}
<B>__{roper}
<A>__{pulls the last of the restraints away...}
<B>__{the gearbox}
<A>__{just as the massive gears crush the wrench, the table turning...}
<B>__{the lathe}
<A>__{the blade passing directly over ronnie's position as roper hauls her away, holding her in his arms.}
