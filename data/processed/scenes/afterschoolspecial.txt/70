<L>__{interior basement set as "yearbook office" day}
<B>__{darkness.}
<A>__{click. the lights come on. the big day has come at last. the guys are nervously conferring on one side of the room, far away from ashley, who's standing alone, dressed in a conservative high school girl's outfit. the basement has been transformed into the guys' idea of a movie set, complete with lights, camera, tripod, and sound equipment. a desk and decoration make the room look roughly like the high school yearbook offices. deacon gives matt a little shove, and matt takes a long walk over to ashley.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{so, um, i will be directing.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{okay. so i want you to play this very understated. it's a very visceral scene, so it's important not to play it too over the top.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{hey, did you guys shave or something?}
<A>__{deacon looks at the other two, all three now beardless.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{okay. i think we're ready here.}
<A>__{fred awkwardly picks up the boom and puts his earphones on.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{boom in position.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{deacon pushes him over to position.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{ashley, get into position.}
<A>__{matt gets behind the camera. they whisper conspiratorially. one last reality check before they take the leap.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{are we actually going to do this?}
<A>__{they look over at ashley. she's waiting.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{i guess so.}
<A>__{they return to position.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{so, um, we're starting with the masturbation and then phillip, the yearbook editor, is going to surprise you.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{and ... action.}
<C>__{ashley}
<P>__{(wooden)}
<D>__{these yearbook photos of the debate club are making me so hot. i can't help myself.}
<A>__{through matt's video display, ashley slowly strips off her clothes. but before we get too good a look, we}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{fred smiles ear to ear. deacon gulps. matt peers out from behind the camera.}
<C>__{ashley }
<D>__{i hope no one catches me because i forgot to lock the door. oh, yeah. oh, god, yeah.}
<A>__{fred's smile turns into nervous ogling. deacon crosses his legs and adjusts his shorts. matt wipes a bead of sweat from his brow. deacon whispers,}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{close up.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{close up.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{oh yeah. right.}
<A>__{and matt zooms in. ashley continues moaning and as matt gets closer, the camera starts shaking. he can't keep his hands steady. through matt's video display we'd love to get a look, but the camera is shaking so much, it's just a blur.}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<C>__{ashley }
<D>__{oh! oh! oh!}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{okay, cut!}
<A>__{she turns off her performance like a light switch.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{what? did i so something wrong?}
<A>__{matt is quivering.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{uh, no. you were great. i think i've got what i need there. i want to set up for jake.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{i need a bathroom break.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{not now, fred. jake.}
<A>__{jake comes out of the bathroom dressed as the yearbook editor.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{action.}
<A>__{jake opens a makeshift door to the office.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(wooden)}
<D>__{oh, my god. what are you doing?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i couldn't help myself. please don't tell the principal.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{give me one good reason why i shouldn't.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{cut. perfect. okay, then. let's get to the, uh, sexual material.}
<A>__{jake pulls off his pants and starts to look a little nervous. he stands in the corner, trying to psyche himself up.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{jake, you okay?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{sure. no problem.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{and action!}
<A>__{but jake is still standing there, not in the shot. he's starting to sweat.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{action, jake.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{still nothing.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{come on, jake. we're filming.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{all right. hang on a second.}
<A>__{he has his back to them, but it's obvious his bread hasn't risen. fred lets the boom mike sag a bit.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{my arm's getting tired.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{so's his.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{action...}
<A>__{jake finally whips off his underwear and faces ashley.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{that's it?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{hey, it's not hard yet.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i can see that.}
<A>__{fred snickers and jake gives him the evil eye.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{um, okay. ashley, maybe you can help him out.}
<A>__{she grabs his joint and jake freezes. he remains motionless, focusing every ounce of mental control on keeping the floodgates closed. approximately one point three seconds later...}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{aaaahhhh!}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{wait! i'm not set up for that shot!}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{can i put down the boom?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{jake? what's happened?}
<A>__{jake, humiliated, runs to put on his shorts.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{this has never happened before. she got me too excited.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{me? how did you ... without even getting hard first?}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(copping an attitude)}
<D>__{what do you want to hear? i've got a tiny pee pee? i'm a premature e jac u la tor? sometimes before i get a boner? okay?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{calm down, jake. we can shoot this scene again. just relax. we can splice it together.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{we'd have to do it like twenty times to get enough footage.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i'm out of here. and if you dickwads tell anybody about this, first i will kill you, and then i will bust you guys.}
<A>__{he pops the videotape out of the camera, takes it, and leaves.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{now what?}
<A>__{the guys regroup, away from ashley. the moment of truth: how far are they willing to go?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{deacon. you do it.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{no way.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{come on. this is your big chance.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{no. you do it.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{fred.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{come on.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{you.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i have to run the camera.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{oh, like you're the only one who can do that.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(false bravado)}
<D>__{fine. i will do it. i will do it for the sake of the film. hold this.}
<A>__{he hands the camera to deacon and starts taking off his shirt. the rest of them look at matt with his shirt off.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{matt. stop it.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{no, i will do it.}
<A>__{he desperately wants someone to hold him back.}
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(grabs him)}
<D>__{matt!}
<A>__{they huddle again, worried about whether to go on with this.}
<C>__{fred }
<D>__{look, guys. maybe we should just pay ashley and chalk this up to a failed experiment.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{fine with me.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{no. we can get someone else.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{who?}
