<L>__{interior crawford house that night}
<A>__{crawford is building a new rube goldberg device, tools and parts laid out precisely on a table. eyes enlarged by the glasses, he silently connects two tiny pieces of metal when a french door suddenly implodes, a metal lawn chair hurled in from the backyard smashing through it. crawford stands, taking off the glasses as willy walks in over the broken glass, carrying nunally's gun.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{very dramatic.}
<A>__{willy crosses the room to the alarm panel on the wall.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{you ain't seen nothin' yet.}
<A>__{he presses the police emergency button, then turns to crawford.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i want the gun.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{why? you've already got one.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i want the gun you shot your wife with. now.}
<A>__{crawford doesn't move. willy raises his gun, points it at crawford's face.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{one way or another, i'm going to see to it you receive justice tonight.}
<A>__{crawford studies willy.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{you're serious, aren't you.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{oh, yes.}
<C>__{crawford}
<P>__{(a smile dawning)}
<D>__{willy. you got religion, didn't you?! you care. that's...priceless.}
<A>__{he laughs. willy keeps the gun aimed at him.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{no, it's very sweet. really.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{gonna be a whole lot less funny in about a minute.}
<A>__{crawford nods. considering the game. unruffled.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{getting it like this: is that going to hold up in court?}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i don't work for the d.a. any more. i'm just a guy who broke into your house. when the police arrest me they'll inventory anything in my possession. if that happens to be crucial evidence in another case, well: some prosecutor just got lucky.}
<A>__{silence. crawford studies willy's eyes, over the muzzle of the gun between them.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{it takes a very special kind of person to look right into someone's eyes and pull the trigger. it takes a unique kind of strength.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i guess you'd know that.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{yes. i would.}
<A>__{willy cocks the gun. crawford shakes his head. eyes on willy.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{willy doesn't lower the gun. but he doesn't pull the trigger, either.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{you don't know me.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{no?}
<A>__{beat. crawford smiles slightly.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{then i'm in for a rude awakening.}
<A>__{willy glares over the gun. crawford shrugs.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{tick tock.}
<A>__{willy's angry. frustrated. trapped. his bluff called. refusing to back down.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{where did you even get yourself a gun?}
<C>__{willy}
<P>__{(bitter)}
<D>__{it's nunally's.}
<A>__{crawford is thrown by this but conceals it well.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{nunally's. really.}
<A>__{willy grimaces, over the gun still aimed at crawford's face.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{yeah. really.}
<A>__{he has backed himself into a corner, and he's getting scared. because all of a sudden the threat he came to fake crawford out with is starting to seem like his only way out. even crawford sees it. in willy's eyes. the uncertain edge of the idea. he could just do it. end the game. blow crawford's brains all over the wall.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{there i was, with a perfectly good weapon just sitting in the evidence warehouse.}
<A>__{it would be so easy. with his life already a shambles. with everything already lost. at least he would have this.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{willy. put it down.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i thought you might appreciate the ...irony.}
<A>__{willy's finger tightens on the trigger.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{willy. think.}
<A>__{and willy does. hesitating. distracted, by a thought. lowering the gun slightly, looking at it remembering:}
