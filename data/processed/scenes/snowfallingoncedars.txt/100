<L>__{interior courtroom day}
<A>__{close on eyes. they are asian. unblinking.}
<C>__{hooks }
<D>__{for the life of me, sir, i cannot imagine why you kept this story from the sheriff.}
<A>__{pull back to see kabuo in the witness box. ramrod straight. face composed.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{as my wife testified, we were considering it.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{actually, she said you had decided. decided not not come forward.}
<C>__{kabuo }
<D>__{i was thinking about it. every minute.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{except even when sheriff moran arrested you. you said nothing about seeing carl.}
<A>__{turns to the jury. openly bewildered.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{at that point, you were already under suspicion. the battery story explained things. if the story was true...and not simply something you thought up later...}
<A>__{turns back. to the defendant.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{why. didn't you. tell it?}
<A>__{no reaction from the defendant. nothing anyone can see.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{sheriff said right off, i was under suspicion. i didn't have a lawyer...}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{but even after you had an attorney. you still claimed to know nothing . claimed not to have seen carl. am i correct?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{yes. initially.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir. you'd been arrested, you had a lawyer, and you still claimed ignorance!}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{i should have told everything right away. i know that now, and i regret it.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{should have told 'everything'. meaning, you should have told the truth .}
<A>__{we can just discern the anger. at the edge of kabuo's steady gaze. silence.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{nothing to say?}
<C>__{kabuo }
<D>__{i didn't know that was a question. it sounded like a speech.}
<A>__{and hooks smiles. loving it. walks toward the witness, stalking him.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{my apologies. do you regret not telling the truth?}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{i have told the truth.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{you mean, this morning. the new story, the battery story. that one is the truth? that's a question, sir.}
<C>__{kabuo }
<D>__{yes. and i told it long before this morning.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{i see. now what happened the day carl heine was found? before your arrest.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{i slept til one thirty, when my wife woke me up with the news. we talked for a few hours. i left at six and went straight to my boat.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{didn't go anywhere else? no errands, no purchases? just straight to the boat. that's the truth.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{hooks leans over the box. ever so slightly invading kabuo's space.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{well, the sheriff found two batteries in your well. if you left one with carl heine, how is that possible?}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{i had a spare battery in my shed. i brought it down, and put it in just before the sheriff showed up.}
<A>__{ah. i see.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{conveniently, in your shed. only you didn't mention that a moment ago. why does this battery story change every time a new question is raised?}
<A>__{kabuo looks at him, evenly.}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{you asked if i went straight to the boat. i did. with the battery.}
<A>__{hooks steps back. looks the witness over.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{you're a hard man to trust, sir. you sit before us, with no expression, keeping a poker f...}
<C>__{nels }
<D>__{objection!}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{you know better than that, mr. hooks. either ask questions that count for something, or sit down and be done with it.}
<A>__{silence. the judge staring hard. hooks never flinching.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{shame on you.}
<A>__{hooks turns his eyes to kabuo. stares him down, so the jury can watch kabuo's implacable stare in return. and softly...}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{i apologize to the court, for letting my feelings get the better of me.}
<A>__{turns away.}
<C>__{hooks}
<D>__{no other questions. we'll go to summation.}
<A>__{as he returns to his table. as kabuo steps down from the box. we pan... ...reporters' row. the boys are writing as fast as their hands can move. only ishmael is not writing at all. he stares at the pad resting on hsi right knee. we close to see... one word circled. the word 'lantern'.}
