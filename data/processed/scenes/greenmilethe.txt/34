<L>__{interior e block night}
<A>__{paul and dean enter to find brutal trying not to wake the cons in their cells by laughing too loudly. they follows his gaze down the mile, see nothing, turn to him like he's crazy.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{i guess the legislature loosened those purse strings enough to hire on a new guard.}
<P>__{(off their looks)}
<D>__{look again. he's right there.}
<A>__{paul and dean look again and this time they see it: a tiny brown mouse is coming up the mile. it trots a short distance, peers right and left as if checking the snoring inmates in their cells, then makes another forward spurt.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{he's doing a cell check.}
<A>__{this gets them all trying not to laugh. the mouse draws ever closer. dean starts to look worried.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{it ain't normal for a mouse to come up on people that way. maybe it's rabid.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{oh, my christ. the big mouse expert. the mouse man. you see it foaming at the mouth, mouse man?}
<C>__{dean}
<P>__{(dubious)}
<D>__{i don't see its mouth at all.}
<A>__{that does it paul and brutal burst out laughing. the mouse stops before them and peers up, curling its tail primly around its paws as if to wait. the guards fall silent, fascinated. bitterbuck stirs in his cell, sits up to watch. brutal tears off a piece of his half eaten corned beef sandwich, holds it delicately out with two fingers. the mouse rises up, appraising the morsel with shiny black eyes.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{aw, brutal, no! we'll be hip deep in mice around here...}
<C>__{brutal}
<P>__{(to paul)}
<D>__{i just wanna see what he'll do. in the interests of science, like.}
<A>__{paul shrugs. brutal drops the scrap. the mouse grabs it and eats, sitting up like a dog doing a trick. the mouse turns and scurries back down the mile, vanishing under the restraint room door at the far end. dean throws paul an "i told you so" look.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{he's in the damn restraint room. you know he's gonna be chewing the padding out of walls and making himself a nice little nest.}
<A>__{brutal give paul a sheepish look well? paul sighs.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{all right. let's get the damn mouse.}
<A>__{they stride grimly down the mile to the restraint room door, men on a mission. coffey's awake now, peering from his cot.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{saw me a mouse go by.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it was a dream. go back to sleep.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{weren't no dream. it was a mouse all right.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{can't put anything over on you.}
<A>__{paul unlocks the door, revealing a padded room filled with storage: cleaning supplies, buckets of paint, mops and ladders, you name it. brutal shrugs off his jacket. paul grabs a mop from a steel bucket, hands it to dean.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{dean, watch the door. he tries to get past you, whack him.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{brutal or the mouse?}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{har har, mouse man.}
<A>__{brutal and paul start doing the heavy lifting, muscling an unused filing cabinet out the door...}
