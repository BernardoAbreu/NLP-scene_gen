<L>__{exterior las vegas police station night}
<A>__{day has turned to night. vick, stu, and alan descend the steps of the police station. the mood is grim.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{did you have to be such a dick?!}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{we got out, didn't we?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{yeah, four hours later! if we'd just cooperated with them }
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{if we'd cooperated with them, we'd be in jail right now, alan.}
<A>__{they reach the curb, and stu starts trying to hail a cab. desperation is setting in.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{what are we gonna do now? we've got zero leads on where doug is!}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{why hasn't he called? it's 8:30.}
<A>__{the guys shake their heads, i don't know.}
<C>__{stu }
<D>__{do you think he's okay ?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{stu, don't. doug is fine.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i mean, we were hanging out with mobsters last night, man! they kill people for looking at `em weird !}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{stu: doug is fine.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{or what if we like drove doug out to the desert and left him, just as like a funny prank ?!}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{stu! enough!}
<C>__{alan}
<P>__{(muttering)}
<D>__{i knew i shouldn't have come...}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{what did you just say?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{i said i knew i shouldn't have come this weekend, vick!}
<C>__{vick}
<P>__{(getting heated)}
<D>__{is that right?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{yeah, that's right. i only came because doug insisted.}
<A>__{vick steps towards alan, heated.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{why do think you're so much better than us, dude?!}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{i don't i just think i'm better than you, vick! and trust me, it's not that hard! you haven't changed one bit since high school! jesus, you're 28 years old and you still talk back to cops?! really?!}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{you're out of your depth, alan }
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{and you're still the one getting us in trouble! only then it was hiding your weed in our locker, and now you've got us partying with wanted felons! it's not cute anymore, man! we're too old for this!}
<A>__{vick scowls; this is actually hitting home...}
<C>__{alan }
<D>__{and all your stupid get rich quick schemes?! girl nasium?! custard?! in los angeles?! are you joking?!}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{okay, let's all take a breath }
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{when's the last time you had a real job, man?! when's the last time you had a girlfriend?! hell, when's the last time you picked up the check?!}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{what's so great about any of those things?!}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{those "things," vick, are what grown men do!}
<A>__{vick swallows, furious.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{look, we're all tired and hungry }
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{none of us ever liked you, alan! we only hung out with you because doug made us!}
<A>__{alan recoils, whoa, stung. this is clearly news to him.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{stu...? is that true?}
<A>__{stu gestures, uncomfortable, enh, who's to say? alan nods, i see, his face reddening.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{why would anyone like you, dude? have you ever thought about that? you're uptight, you're judgemental, you're cheap, and yet somehow you think you're sweeter than everyone else! well look around, man: no one wants to be you! i'd rather be stu than you!}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{wait, what ?}
<A>__{too late: alan charges vick and tackles him onto the lawn! they roll on the ground, trying to punch each other, but it ends up being a mess of half chops, pulled hair, and hands in each other's faces...}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{i've...always...hated you...}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{you punch like...your sister...}
<A>__{stu runs over and jumps in, trying to break them apart.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{hey, no! time out! we all need a time out !}
<A>__{thunk! stu is accidentally kicked in the face and goes down. alan and vick continue rolling on the lawn, trying to beat the crap out of each other. they could be kids again. then, just when it starts getting way too intense,}
<B>__{a car horn sounds}
<A>__{and all three of them look up to see vick's beat up cadillac parked on the curb, chastity at the wheel.}
<C>__{chastity}
<D>__{that might not be like, the smartest place to fight?}
<A>__{vick and alan look over at the huge las vegas police department sign right next to them. they frown...}
