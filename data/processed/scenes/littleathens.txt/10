<L>__{exterior jimmy's apartment morning}
<A>__{brad, in jeans with his t shirt thrown over his shoulder, is standing in front of the door, waiting. megan, in shorts, a t shirt and a baseball cap, and amy, in a sunskirt, look on. all in their late teens, they are unmade and worn out, as if they hadn't slept last night. brad rings the doorbell twice and waits some more. brad walks over to the window a few feet over from the door, trying to peer through the shades. megan passes the time by pulling jimmy's mail out of the mailbox that hangs next to the door.}
<C>__{brad}
<P>__{(banging on the window pane)}
<D>__{hey! jimmy!}
<A>__{the door opens and jimmy answers, in his very late teens, about 5'4" and thin, dressed in boxers, a t shirt and bedroom slippers. jimmy's tired, but brad's a friendly face.}

<P>__{(explaining to amy)}
<D>__{jimmy's got like, six jobs.}
<A>__{jimmy stands aside, allowing megan and amy into his apartment. megan and amy step inside, but brad holds back. he needs to talk to jimmy, and the girls do not need to hear.}
