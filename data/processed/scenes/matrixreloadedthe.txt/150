<C>__{razor }
<D>__{its all set. theres a pair of cops at the rest stop, though.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{not a problem.}
<A>__{the countach pulls into the meager rest stop, not more than a water fountain, toilet house and phone booth. a police cruiser sits, lights off, waiting to intercept speeders.}
<L>__{exterior rest stop (matrix) sunset}
<A>__{the countach skids to a stop, kicking up a massive dust cloud that hides the car. we hear the door slide, and the massive black clad figure of morpheus emerges from the dust.}
<D>__{an uzi in each hand, pointed at us.}
<A>__{the cop behind the wheel is too slow to draw, call for backup, or even duck for cover. the safety glass is destroyed as gunfire rips through it, chewing the cop to pieces. his body thrashes in the seat. morpheus turns away. niobe pulls up on her bike and gets off, slowly, obviously the ride had been a long one. trinity joins them. morpheus stops.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{i thought razor said their were two cops.}
