<A>__{cobb pulls off his balaclava. looks down at saito, who is breathing fast, shallow.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{how's he doing?}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{he's in a lot of pain.}
<A>__{cobb takes saito's hand. looks him in the eye.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{when we get you down to the next level, the pain will be less intense.}
<A>__{saito nods, breathing hard.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<P>__{(low)}
<D>__{and if he dies?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{his conscious mind will drop out of the dream. he'll be trapped in limbo for a lifetime...}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{what will that do to him?}
<A>__{cobb looks at her. grave.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{when he wakes... his mind could be completely gone.}
<C>__{saito}
<D>__{when... when we wake i will still honor our arrangement...}
<A>__{cobb looks down at saito sadly.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{saito san, when you wake you might not even remember that we had an arrangement. you'll have forgotten this world. limbo will be your reality. lost there so long, you'll have become an old man...}
<C>__{saito}
<D>__{filled with regret?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{waiting to die alone. yes.}
<C>__{saito}
<D>__{then i will take the chance and come back. and we'll be young men together again.}
<A>__{saito smiles weakly. cobb nods at him, turns to ariadne.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{when were you trapped in limbo?}
<A>__{cobb says nothing. ariadne pulls him away from saito.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{cobb, you might have convinced the rest of this team to carry on with the job. but they don't know the truth.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{what truth?}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{the truth that at any minute you might bring a freight train through the wall. the truth that mal is bursting up through your subconscious.}
<C>__{ariadne }
<D>__{the truth that as we go deeper into fischer, we're also going deeper into you and i'm not sure we're going to like what we find there.}
<A>__{cobb stares back at ariadne. saying nothing.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{this is not just about fischer, it's about you. tell me what happened to you and mal. trapped in limbo.}
<A>__{cobb looks at her. thinking it through.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{we were on a job. exploring dreams within dreams. but we didn't understand how your mind can turn hours into years. how you can get trapped. trapped so deep that when you wash up on the shore of your subconscious...}
<A>__{insert cut: mal lies on the sand, staring up at a cloudless sky, waves washing over her...}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{you can lose track of what's real.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{how long were you stuck?}
<A>__{cobb pauses before he answers. looks at ariadne.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{fifty years.}
<A>__{ariadne stares at him, incredulous.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{how did you stand it?}
<A>__{insert cut: cobb and mal build a sandcastle on the beach...}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{we built. we created a whole world for ourselves...}
<A>__{insert cut: cobb and mal walk through a deserted city.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{it's not so bad at first, being gods. the problem is knowing that it's not real. it became impossible for me to live like that.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{but not for her?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{she accepted it. at some pointerior..}
