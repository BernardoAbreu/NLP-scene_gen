<L>__{100 years old, small, black, wizened, hair and beard}
<A>__{whiter than cotton, a leopard skin draped over his shoulders, a beaded fly switch in one hand, a trussed chicken in the other, exits the car.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior yard night}
<A>__{a fire burns bright in the black african night. the boy sits holding the chicken, close by the fire, while inkosi inkosikazi shuffles around him, drawing a circle in the dust with a stick.}
<C>__{young man }
<D>__{legend had it that inkosi inkosikazi was the last son of the great zulu king, dingaan, who fought both the boers and the british to a standstill nearly 100 years before, and the night inkosi inkosikazi was conceived stars fell from the sky until the sun rose.}
<A>__{the circle complete, the old man sits down opposite the boy. from a leather pouch he produces several bones. he throws the bones on the ground and studies them for a moment. he begins to wave the fly switch back and forth in front of the boy's eyes, chanting low, softly. the boy's eyes grow heavy; his lids droop. dream exterior waterfall the boy and the old man are standing above a great waterfall. in the swirling pool far below are ten stepping stones linking one bank to the other.}
<C>__{young man }
<D>__{the medicine man instructed me to jump off the falls and climb along the ten stepping stones, counting as i went until i reached dry land.}
<A>__{the boy jumps, cascading down the falls and into the pond below. he clambers up the first rock. it is slippery. he falls off and climbs back on, buffeted by the spraying water. he makes his way stone by stone toward the other side.}
<C>__{young man }
<D>__{even though it was only a dream, i felt as if my struggle to reach dry land was terrifyingly real. the water was like ice, bone chilling, cold, and as i made my way from one stone to the next i could feel my strength desert me.}
<A>__{the progress from one step to the next gets progressively harder as the boy keeps slipping into the swirling water, coughing and sputtering.}
<C>__{young man }
<D>__{i was three rocks in when i ran out of gas. i couldn't pull myself any further. no matter how hard i tried, the current tried harder. i felt myself going under for the last time.}
<A>__{the boy's grip slips off the rock. he starts to go under.}
