<A>__{a full moon. colleagues in a volvo pull out of the parking lot, calling, "congratulations" to railly. she waves back as she hurries to her black acura, one of the last cars left in the lot. the outside lights of breitrose hall go off. railly seems to be alone in the lot as she fishes keys from her purse, unlocks her car door, starts to open it when... suddenly, she's grabbed from behind in a choke hold by a large shadowy man looming out of the darkness behind her.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{get in!}
<A>__{unable to scream, she writhes and kicks as he forces her into the front seat.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{i've got a gun.}
<A>__{railly freezes, terrified, as he opens the rear door and scrambles in behind her.}
