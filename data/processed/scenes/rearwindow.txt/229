<L>__{exterior neighborhood day semi long shot}
<A>__{miss torso, in ballet costume, practicing her dance on the outside balcony. she is exciting and desirable.}
<L>__{interior jeff's apartment day tight two shot}
<A>__{jeff notices doyle's interest.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{how's your wife?}
<A>__{startled at being observed, doyle moves quickly away from the window, affecting nonchalance. the camera moves back as doyle returns to his drink. jeff smiles at catching doyle enjoying miss torso.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{oh oh, she's fine.}
<P>__{(not too convincing)}
<D>__{just fine.}
<A>__{he tosses off the rest of the drink, and his movement is almost a comment. jeff's face grows serious.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{who said they left then?}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{who left where?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{the thorwalds at six in the morning?}
<A>__{doyle quickly collects his thoughts, and gets back to the case at hand.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{the building superintendent, and two tenants. flat statements no hesitation. and they all jibed to the letter. the thorwalds were leaving for the railroad station.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{now how could anybody guess that? they had, perhaps, signs on their luggage, "grand central or bust!"?}
<C>__{doyle}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{the superintendent met thorwald coming back. he said thorwald told him he had just put his wife on the train for the country.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{a very convenient guy this superintendent. have you checked his bank deposits lately?}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{jeff huh?}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{well what good is his information?!! it's a second hand version of an unsupported statement by the murderer himself thorwald! anybody actually see the wife get on the train?}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{i hate to remind you but this all started because you said she was murdered. now did anyone, including you, actually see her murdered?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{doyle are you interested in solving a case, or making me look foolish?}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{if possible both.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{well then do a good job of it! get over there, and search thorwald's apartment! it must be knee deep in evidence.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{i can't do that.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i mean when he goes out for a paper, or a drink, or something. what he doesn't know won't hurt him.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{i can't do it even if he's gone.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(with sarcasm)}
<D>__{what's the matter? does he have a courtesy card from the police department?}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{now don't get me mad! even a detective can't walk in anybody's apartment and search it. if i were ever caught in there, i'd lose my badge inside of ten minutes!}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{just make sure you're not caught. if you find something, you've got a murderer and nobody will care about a couple of house rules. if you find nothing he's clear.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{at the risk of sounding stuffy, jeff i will remind you of the constitution, and the phrase "search warrant" issued by a judge who knows the bill of rights verbatim. he must ask for evidence.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{give him evidence.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{i can hear myself starting out. "your honor i have a friend who's an amateur sleuth, an one night, after a heavy supper "}
<P>__{(he shakes his head "no")}
<D>__{he'd throw the new york state penal code right in my face. and it's six volumes.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{by morning there might not be anything left to find in his apartment.}
<C>__{doyle}
<P>__{(looking out window)}
<D>__{a detective's nightmare.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{what do you need before you can search bloody footsteps leading up to the door?}
<C>__{doyle}
<P>__{(looking out window)}
<D>__{one thing i don't need is heckling! you called and asked me for help and now you're acting like a taxpayer!}
<C>__{doyle}
<P>__{(turns and look at jeff)}
<D>__{how did we ever stand each other in that same plane for three years?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{you know, every day for three years i asked myself that same question?}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{ever get an answer?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{yeah frequently it ran something like this: "your request for transfer turned down "}
<A>__{he can't help smiling, and neither can doyle.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{sorry i had to turn it down.}
<P>__{(he checks his watch)}
<D>__{i'm going over to the railroad station and check thorwald's story.}
<A>__{he moves to the sideboard, picks up a felt hat.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{forget the story find the trunk. mrs. thorwald's in it!}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{oh i almost forgot!}
<A>__{he pulls a slip of paper out of his pocket. jeff watches him intently.}
<C>__{doyle}
<P>__{(looking at jeff)}
<D>__{there was a postcard in thorwald's mailbox.}
<P>__{(refers to paper)}
<D>__{mailed yesterday afternoon, three thirty p.m. from merritsville }
<P>__{(looks up, speaks pleasantly)}
<D>__{ that's eighty miles north of here.}
<P>__{(back to paper)}
<D>__{the message read "arrived o.k. already feeling better. love, anna."}
<A>__{he looks at jeff with some smugness.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{is is anna who i think it is?}
<C>__{doyle}
<P>__{(nods "yes")}
<D>__{mrs. thorwald.}
<A>__{he puts on his hat, and goes toward the door.}
<C>__{doyle}
<P>__{(maliciously)}
<D>__{anything you need?}
