<L>__{interior hospital chapel minutes later}
<A>__{several families sit in solemn prayer. the pastor comforts a man and wife. john and angela slip through, head for the shelves of reference books on the back wall. they whisper.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{corinthians goes to 21 acts in the book of ethenius. it's like a dark mirror of the bible. it paints a different view of revelations, says that the world will not come to an end at the hand of god but be reborn in the embrace of the damned.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{there's a difference?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{depends on which side of the fence you're standing.}
<A>__{john stops, casually sticks his hand in the pastor's bowl of holy water near the altar.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{so why haven't i seen this book before?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{because it doesn't exist here on this side.}
<A>__{john closes his eyes and the water in the bowl begins to boil }
<C>__{angela }
<D>__{what do you mean }
<A>__{flickering candlelight slows to a stop, catching angela mid question and the room in that dim half light. john turns and is inside same chapel hell the epitome of blasphemy a church in hell. only they don't worship god in here. and that's not christ on the cross. and those stained glass windows are now slate black. john is now facing books with completely different markings. he searches as a drone rises in pitch and an inky blackness begins to flow down the walls, getting closer to john with each heartbeat. he finds the book, steps back as he closes his eyes }
<B>__{regular chapel}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{ not here on this side?}
<A>__{john turns, covered in sweat. he's holding a book she's never seen, is already flipping through it.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{where did that come from?}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(stopping to read)}
<D>__{13:29. 13:30 here... corinthians 14:01...}
<P>__{(skimming to this)}
<D>__{'the sins of the father would only be exceeded by the ego of the son.'}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{whose son?}
<A>__{john stands, his brain going into overdrive.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{symbol isn't a demon's... that's why i couldn't place it... not a normal possession...}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{john, what are you talking about?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{but he can't cross over impossible for the son to cross over...}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{whose son? god's?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no. the other one.}
<P>__{(off her look)}
<D>__{lucifer had a son too.}
