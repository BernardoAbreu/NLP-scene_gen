<B>__{karaoke stage}
<A>__{in the far corner of a half empty dive bar. kate holds a microphone and dances as she sings a bad karaoke version of "song to be determined." what kate lacks in talent she more than makes up for with charm and enthusiasm. at a table near the stage is charlie hannah: kate's husband, late 20's, scruffy but handsome, also pretty damn drunk. he enthusiastically claps and points to kate, making up a cheering section along with owen hannah charlie's younger brother, early 20's who sings along with the small but energetic crowd. kate begins to ramble between verses and gleefully points to charlie and owen. for the moment, this drunk girl is the queen of karaoke.}
