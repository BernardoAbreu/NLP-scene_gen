The woman glances at the manuscript in her lap. It's called: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind This serves as the movie's opening title.  The other credits follow, as the old woman studies commuters in passing tubes. Their faces are variously harsh and sad and lonely and blank.}

She's in her early thirties, zaftig in a faux fur winter coat over an orange hooded sweatshirt.  She's decidedly funky and has blue hair.  Mary looks up.}

I'm not happy, but what do I expect?  Relationships require work. You know the drill.  The thing that I keep coming back to is, I'm not getting any younger, I want to have a baby... at some point... maybe... right?

That I have some completely unrealistic notion of what a relationship can be.  But then I think, no, this is what I really want, so I should allow myself the freedom to go out and fucking find it.

<DIAL>__{I...I... I... find you physically repulsive!  I can't even look at you!}
<ACTION>__{They look at each other in silence. A little boy being called "faggot" by an endless succession of boys. The aftermath of a car accident from the driver's POV. Mary having an abortion.}

<ACTION>__{It's modern and well-appointed.  The old woman enters, sits behind the reception desk, drops her manuscript into the drawer.   She takes some pills with water.  An old man enters.}

<DIAL>__{Well, don't try.  It's unbecoming on you.}
<ACTION>__{Old Howard mutters something and disappears into the back. Old Mary pulls out a file from behind, removes a small disc, places it in a machine on her desk, slips on earphones and listens, somewhat wearily but attentively.  We watch the color drain from her face, but don't hear the recording. Another old woman enters the office.  Old Mary looks up, seems a bit startled, conceals it, turns off the tape.}

<ACTION>__{He indicates a sitting area.  She sits.  He joins her.}
<DIAL>__{OLD MAN (HOWARD) (CONT'D) Would you mind if I tape our discussion?}
<ACTION>__{She shakes her hear.  He punches a couple of buttons on his computer console.  A tape recorder starts up and his computer screen lights up so only he can see it.  On it we see a whole file on Clementine Kruczynski: a list of fifteen dates of previous erasures stretching back fifty years, all of them involving Joel Barish.}
<DIAL>__{OLD MAN (HOWARD) (CONT'D) So, why don't you begin by telling me why you've come here.}

<DIAL>__{SECOND OLD WOMAN (CLEMENTINE) (V.O.) -- his eyes used to be so filled with love.  But it was gone.  How can I go back to being alone after seeing love?  I was alone for so long.  What had I done with my life?  I was alone so long.}
<LOC>__{INT. SECOND OLD WOMAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The old Clementine is unconscious on her bed, hooked up to modern versions of the erasing machines.  Two young technicians monitor the equipment.  The woman's bedside phone rings.  Her machine picks up.  After a moment:}
