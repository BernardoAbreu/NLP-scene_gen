<L>__{exterior truck stop parking lot day}
<A>__{jeff emerges from between two vehicles, glancing over his shoulder nervously. he keeps his head down, moving fast. he scans the truck stop in all directions. the patrol car is still parked on the ridge, the patrolman peering through binoculars. jeff quickens his pace alongside the truck stop building, passing a row of pay phones. he looks up, stops dead. red is talking on a pay phone six feet away. jeff stares. red is facing away, unaware of his presence. jeff darts into an adjacent pay phone. he shields his face with the receiver and listens.}
<C>__{red}
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{i don't know, dammit, he was supposed to be here a half hour ago. there's reports on the police band about a cop down and this place is crawling with uniforms...}
<A>__{red waits, listens.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{look, i'm getting out of here. stay off the airwaves. bring the girl and meet me at the barn... you got that?}
<A>__{he hangs up. jeff presses the phone against his face and turns away. when he looks up, red is walking toward his peterbilt truck, parked in a row of big rigs. jeff starts to follow, then freezes. several cops are fanning out on foot, questioning everyone they encounter. jeff sees red getting into his truck. the engine kicks over. the brakes hiss and the truck begins pulling out. jeff whips around. the older vacationing couple are talking to a cop fifty yards away. the husband points toward the pay phones. jeff makes a sudden decision, doubles back behind a rolling farm truck.}
<B>__{cop}
<A>__{thanks the couple, calls out something to his fellow officers.}
<B>__{jeff}
<A>__{runs alongside the farm truck, using it as a shield. he overtakes the truck, cuts across its path. the farmer blares his horn. jeff glances left. red's tractor trailer is traveling across the crowded parking area, slowly gaining speed. jeff sprints in front of a moving car. the driver jerks to a halt and honks, catching the attention of a nearby cop. jeff quickly turns away, avoiding being seen. red's 18 wheeler turns toward the access road. jeff looks around, panicked. more cops are spreading out on foot. they'll notice him any second. jeff crouches low and scurries underneath a slow moving postal truck. the truck speeds up, nearly crushing him under the rear wheel assembly. jeff rolls out of the path of the giant wheels, gets to his feet on the other side and finds himself... ... in the path of another huge truck! a cop is standing only 20 feet away! jeff goes underneath another trailer, crawling between the moving wheels. he springs to his feet. red's peterbilt is pulling away! jeff runs for all he's worth. his arms and legs pump furiously. he runs abreast of the truck... ... and seizes the spare tire mount!}
