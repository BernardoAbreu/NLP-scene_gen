<L>__{exterior backyard day}
<A>__{gary is lying in the sun, eyes shut. suddenly, a golf ball hits him on the head. he sits up, perplexed. for a long moment, he has no idea where the ball came from, until he hears a voice from beyond the wall that separates the properties.}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{sorry! really sorry.}
<A>__{(a practiced ear notices a canadian accent.)}
<C>__{woman's voice }
<D>__{over here. to your left.}
<P>__{(correcting)}
<D>__{right. sorry. right.}
<A>__{he follows the voice to a gap in the hedges at the far corner of the yard, finding sarah gleason. late 30's, fresh scrubbed and girlish, she looks more fragile than she really is.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i'm working on my putting, if you can believe it.}
<A>__{indeed, she's holding a putter.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{not really.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{okay. maybe i was just looking for a way to meet my infamous neighbor. you see, i'm under house arrest, too.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{what did you do?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i had sex with my husband.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{that's awful.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{nine months later, i had jaden. that's her over there.}
<A>__{she points to a small portable baby monitor.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{she's cute.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{she's sleeping for another...}
<P>__{(checks watch)}
<D>__{...seventeen minutes. she keeps to a schedule.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{she sounds really boring.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{she is.}
<A>__{a beat. a smile between them.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{you're rich. shouldn't you have a nanny from ecuador?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i'm canadian.}
<C>__{gary}
<P>__{(as if that explains it)}
<D>__{ohhh...}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i can't work in the u.s. plus, i want to maintain this air of moral superiority by doing everything myself.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{very canadian.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{another pregnant pause.}
<C>__{sarah }
<D>__{listen, jaden goes down again at 2:30. maybe i could stop by.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{i'm pretty sure i will be here.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{it's a date.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{is it?}
<A>__{she picks up the baby monitor, heading back into her house. suddenly, she realizes...}
