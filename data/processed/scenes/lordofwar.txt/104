<P>__{(to the gathering locals)}
<D>__{help yourselves. be my guest. no charge.}
<A>__{one local man tentatively approaches the cargo bay. yuri hands him an ak 47 and a box of shells. more sierra leonese locals emerge from the side of the road, seemingly out of thin air. yuri hands out more guns.}
<C>__{yuri }
<P>__{(to other locals)}
<D>__{take the whole crate.}
<A>__{two men oblige, ferrying the crate away. the other locals become bolder, then brazen. soon it's a free far all. men, women and children swarm all over the plane pilfering the arms and anything else that isn't bolted down also a lot that is. yuri has to exit the plane to avoid being trampled in the rush.}
