<T>__{quick dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior globe building}
<A>__{mary, hunsecker's secretary, occupies a cubicle which is separated form the rest of the newsroom by a partition. from the big room beyond, comes the hum and chatter of a big newspaper. the walls of the urgent murmur of the staff of a big newspaper. the walls of mary's cubicle are covered with photographs; filing cabinets are piled high with unopened mail; two wire service teletype machines click desultorily. mary is plain but attractive, past 30, a level headed woman with a sense of integrity. she is on the phone just now, bored with the insistent voice on the other end. beside her an earnest young lawyer waits with several papers in hand.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(to phone)}
<D>__{i have no power to retract, mr. cummings... i'm only mr. hunsecker's secretary. no. nor can i agree that can retraction is necessary. thank you for calling.}
<A>__{sidney has come through the newsroom in background. he pauses tactfully, seeing mary occupied with the lawyer.}
<C>__{lawyer}
<P>__{(huffily)}
<D>__{i fail to see what's amusing about these papers.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i will get the boss to sign them.}
<C>__{lawyer}
<P>__{(giving her the papers)}
<D>__{they're important.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you've said that six times that's why i'm smiling.}
<A>__{as the disgruntled lawyer leaves, sidney comes in, wearing his most winning smile. with a glance after the lawyer, making sure that he is not observed, sidney greets mary, assuming a brogue:}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{hello, mary, me darlin' and phwat are ye up to today?}
<A>__{sidney's hand caresses her shoulder with a gesture which indicates a certain intimacy between them.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{that's a question i usually like to ask you. your secretary phoned.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{what about?}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{something about a frank d'angelo trying to reach you...}
<A>__{sidney reaches for the phone. as he does so, mary hesitates and glances at a copy of the record which lies on the desk open at otis elwell's column. she picks it up.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{is that the man who manages susie's boyfriend?}
<A>__{sidney murmurs casually, "yeah. why?" as he dials. mary holds up the paper, indicating the item.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{have you seen this? in otis elwell's column.}
<P>__{(reads)}
<D>__{"the dreamy marijuana smoke of a lad who heads a highbrow jazz quintet is giving an inelegant odor to that elegant east side club where he works. that's no way for a card holding party member to act. moscow won't like, you naughty boy!"}
<A>__{sidney accepts the paper from mary, examines the item while he talks to sally on the phone.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{sally? i got the message. if d'angelo calls again, tell him i will be at the office around noon.}
<A>__{he hangs up, continuing to read.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{could this be that boy?}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(casually)}
<D>__{dallas? could be. he doesn't look like a reefer smoker...}
<A>__{he discards the paper with a show of disinterest. mary picks it up again.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(looking at the record again)}
<D>__{if this is true, j.j.'s going to hit the ceiling...}
<A>__{sidney moves around behind mary. his eyes are fixed on a spike which sits on mary's desk. on it is impaled a proof of hunsecker's column. meanwhile, he remarks:}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{can it be news to you that j.j.'s ceiling needs a plaster job every six weeks?}
<B>__{insert}
<A>__{from sidney's viewpoint, hunsecker's column. the shot is just too distant for us to be able to read the printerior}
<B>__{sidney and mary}
<A>__{sidney is looking at the column. mary is concentrated on papers before her. without looking up, she is clearly aware of sidney's efforts to read the proof.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{sidney, you know that j.j. doesn't like people to look at the column proof in advance...}
<A>__{sidney, caught "in flagrante", laughs.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{mary, i'm not "people" there's falco blood, sweat and tears in that column.}
<A>__{he turns away, changing the subject (apparently).}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{how about dinner tonight?}
<A>__{mary turns to study him.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{bribing me again?}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(uncomfortable under her scrutiny)}
<D>__{and why should i bribe the woman who holds most of my heart?}
<A>__{mary is thoughtful. without malice, in a detached sort of way, she examines sidney.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you're a real rascal, sidney. i'd certainly dislike you if i didn't like you. you're an amusing boy, but there isn't a drop of respect in you for anything alive you're too immersed in the theology of making a fast buck. not that i don't sometimes feel that you yearn for something better...}
<A>__{sidney finds this analysis hard to take. again he tries to laugh his way out of it.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(cynical)}
<D>__{mary, don't try to sell me the brooklyn bridge. i happen to know it belongs to the dodgers.}
<A>__{mary, smiling, decides "to let him off the hook". she takes the spike and the column and passes it across to sidney's side of the desk, as she returns briskly to her business.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(affably)}
<D>__{i don't mind you looking at the proof of the column in advance, as long as j.j. doesn't know. but don't do it like a boy stealing gum from a slot machine.}
<A>__{sidney doesn't like this; but, on the other hand, he does want to look at the column. after only a momentary struggle, he picks the column off the spike and reads.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{who put this item in about the comic?}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"if there's a more hilarious funny man around than herbie temple at the palace, you'll have to pardon us for not catching the name. we were too busy screaming." does this temple have a press agent?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{no. it's one of j.j.'s occasional beau gestes. evidently the fellow's funny, so he gave him a plug.}
<A>__{he goes to the door, grinning.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{what's your favorite ribbon to go around your favorite chocolates?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{let's wait till christmas it's more legitimate then.}
<A>__{she looks after sidney, thinks about him for a moment. then she types.}
