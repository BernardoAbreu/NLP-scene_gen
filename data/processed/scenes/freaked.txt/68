<L>__{exterior elijah's house day}
<A>__{elijah shows rick out the door. the eyes scurry out and leap back into the sockets in the giant head.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{bye bye. and remember, try another escape, and i will feed your balls to toad.}
<A>__{as he walks towards the freak house, rick pulls out the note he pocketed. a gust of wind blows it away from him. he chases it behind the carnival tent where... kkccliinnk! he runs into eleven phony milkmen, backing their way around the corner, each carrying their own six pack of milkbottles. startled, they turn around. why, it's the freaks! and they're all dressed as milkmen! cowboy carries the hammer, who's dressed in a little milkman suit as well.}
<C>__{bearded lady}
<D>__{hey rick, i thought you were gonna come up with your own escape plan?}
<C>__{rick}
<P>__{(to juan)}
<D>__{this is your big plan? a dozen milkmen? isn't that a little unusual?}
<A>__{juan hadn't thought of this. he pushes himself forward and confronts rick viciously.}
<C>__{juan}
<D>__{twelve milkmen is theoretically possible. thirteen is silly. looks like one milkman too many, coogan.}
<A>__{he pushes rick aside. the freaks continue past him.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{fine then. go ahead. hope you like reggae, ya flea bitten bastard.}
<A>__{rick watches as the freaks approach the open courtyard, where he knows the eyeballs will spot them. julie glances at him a second, then looks away. his mind made up, rick takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{ah, shit.}
<A>__{he runs over to the freaks. he stands in juan's way.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{look, you'll all be killed. you don't know about elijah's giant rasta eyeballs with machine guns...}
<P>__{(they think he's nuts)}
<D>__{it's suicide! i can't let you do it.}
<C>__{juan}
<D>__{and i can't let you stop us.}
<A>__{this is it. rick and juan square off. juan growls and bares his teeth. rick's monster eye starts to glow and pulse dimly. they circle each other. the others are transfixed.}
<C>__{elijah's pov}
<A>__{he peers through a side window, and sees the pack of milkmen cheering two of their coworkers, locked in mortal combat.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{that's a lot of milkmen on the same route. no wonder they fight.}
<A>__{juan rears back, about to lunge, when suddenly he freezes and looks off into the distance.}
<C>__{a squirrel}
<A>__{is sitting innocently a few yards off.}
<C>__{juan}
<D>__{squirrel!}
<A>__{he zooms off after the squirrel. the eyes pop out of the giant head and follow after him, uzis firing. juan dodges their bullets and disappears after his prey. the freaks watch their best chance of freedom run off after a pesky rodent. they turn to rick.}
<C>__{nosey}
<D>__{wow, giant rasta eyeballs, just like rick said.}
<C>__{sockhead}
<D>__{gosh, if it wasn't for rick, we'd all be dead!}
<C>__{other freaks}
<D>__{yeah! way to go rick! alright!}
<C>__{ernie}
<P>__{(to julie)}
<D>__{god, i can't believe he left you for a squirrel. what a dick.}
<A>__{julie's hurt. she doesn't even smack ernie.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{you know how men are. besides, it was a pretty good looking squirrel.}
<A>__{julie looks at rick. she sees he's trying to be helpful, not sarcastic.}
<C>__{julie}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{come on. you heard the beast boy. back to the freak house, now.}
<A>__{her eyes meet rick's. she manages a smile, and rick smiles back. ernie sizes up the situation and groans as they all head back to the freak house.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{not again.}
<P>__{(to rick)}
<D>__{oh well, at least we'll get to try a new position.}
