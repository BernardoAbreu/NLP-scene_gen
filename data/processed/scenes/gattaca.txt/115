<A>__{from above, the investigator and hugo observe the final employee exit the testing lab. lamar, following the employee out of the lab, throws a look of vindication to the two cops.}
<C>__{detective hugo}
<D>__{that's the last.}
<C>__{investigator}
<D>__{something's not right.}
<C>__{detective hugo}
<P>__{(losing his patience)}
<D>__{he's not here. it's a blind alley.}
<C>__{investigator}
<P>__{(resolute)}
<D>__{no, we've missed something. we hoover again.}
<C>__{detective hugo}
<D>__{we don't have the manpower.}
<C>__{investigator}
<D>__{get it. from outside, if you have to.}
<C>__{detective hugo}
<D>__{from what budget?}

<D>__{you question my authority one more time!}
<A>__{the investigator turns his back on his subordinate and idly contemplates the nearby telescope. hugo resignedly relays the news to director josef who is standing some distance away. josef's immediate reaction is to march towards the investigator, hugo trailing behind. director josef collects himself as he notices the investigator's hand on the telescope.}
<C>__{director josef}
<D>__{would you care to look in the telescope?}
<C>__{investigator}
<D>__{thank you, no.}
<C>__{director josef}
<P>__{(still referring to the telescope)}
<D>__{one look through there and you would know why i can't possibly allow you to disrupt operations any further.}
<C>__{investigator}
<P>__{(unfazed)}
<D>__{you're so unconcerned that you have a killer in your midst.}
<C>__{director josef}
<D>__{right now,}
<A>__{your presence is creating more of}
<D>__{a threat. i don't think you have any concept of what we do here how meticulous our preparations must be. we are about to send twelve people through 140 million miles of blackness to rendezvous with an object the size of a house and the color of coal. so it's rather critical to point them in the right direction. and we certainly don't need you looking over our shoulders. besides, i don't believe there is any evidence that the killer}
<A>__{is amongst us. i}
<D>__{don't see too many other dead bodies littering the place.}
<C>__{investigator}
<P>__{(surveying the mostly empty facility)}
<D>__{no, but since there aren't too many}
<A>__{live ones}
<D>__{tonight either, you won't mind us conducting one further sweep. if he does not work here, then there should be no other trace of him.}
<P>__{(to hugo)}
<D>__{i think you'd better get some people out of bed, detective.}
<P>__{(a thought occurs)}
<D>__{in the meantime we can re check his favorite haunt.}
<A>__{director josef quietly seethes.}
<C>__{investigator}
<P>__{(to josef, referring to the telescope)}
<D>__{you see, director, i prefer my microscope.}
