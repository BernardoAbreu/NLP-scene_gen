<L>__{interior morgue day}
<A>__{the amity morgue is also the amity funeral home, a victorian house that normally serves as the community's mortuary. the coroner, a professional small town gp, is standing by as hooper is speaking into a sophisticated cassette recorder with a headpiece that leaves his hands free for measurement with a calibrator or calipers.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{let's show mr. hooper our accident.}
<A>__{with a shrug, the coroner slides open the drawer.}
<B>__{close on hooper}
<A>__{he is looking down as the drawer slides past him, still matter of fact, turning on his recorder.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{victim one, identified as christine watkins, female caucasian...}
<A>__{the sheet has just been lifted, and hooper stares down at the lump on the slab. he stops, turns off his recorder as emotions wage war with his senses. rationality wins, and he turns on the recorder again.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{...height and weight may only be estimated from partial remains. torso severed in mid thorax, eviscerated with no major organs remaining. may i have a drink of water? right arm severed above the elbow with massive tissue loss from upper musculature. portions of denuded bone remaining.}
<P>__{(tense, to brody)}
<D>__{ did you notify the coast guard?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{no, it was local jurisdiction.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{left arm, head, shoulders, sternum and portions of ribcage intact.}
<P>__{(to brody)}
<D>__{please don't smoke. with minor post mortem lacerations and abrasions. bite marks indicate typical non frenzy feeding pattern of large squali, possibly carchaninus lonimanus, or isurus glaucas. gross tissue loss and post mortem erosion of bite surfaces prevent detailed analysis; however, teeth and jaws of the attacking squali must be considered above average for these waters.}
<P>__{(to brody again)}
<D>__{ did you go out in a boat and look around?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{no, we just checked the beach...}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(turns off the recorder)}
<D>__{it wasn't an 'accident,' it wasn't a boat propeller, or a coral reef, or jack the ripper. it was a shark. it was a shark.}
