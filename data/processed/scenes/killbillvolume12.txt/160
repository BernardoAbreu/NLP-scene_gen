<A>__{to the bride. we see the same shots as before of the bride driving up to bill's villa, through his iron gates, and parking by his front door. we see two black suited male satellites approach her. now comes the new stuff. she climbs out of her vehicle, goes to the back, opens the boot, and removes her mossberg pump action shotgun. the two satellites freeze... she slides the pump once, and fires. one is blown apart by the blast. she slides the pump a second time...blast. two buys the farm. she slides the pump again... ...and blasts the front door, kicking it open and stepping inside.}
