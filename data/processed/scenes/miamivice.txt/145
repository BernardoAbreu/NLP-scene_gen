<L>__{exterior montoya compound, guajira peninsula, colombia isabella}
<A>__{ night we are on a peninsula with palm trees. a bluff dotted with a small forest of satellite dishes. a ribbon of white sand and beyond that is silver light off the water. it is rural and futuristic at the same time.}
<C>__{isabella }
<D>__{...90 and 120 day futures with shorted canadian and us dollars...}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior master bedroom suite archangel de jesus montoya }
<B>__{londono}
<A>__{in pajama top and boxer shorts, smoking a cigar. in a sweatsuit is isabella, delivering a financial report. it's from memory. nothing is written down, in the tradition of the elite section of swiss private banking in which clerks commit portfolios to memory. there are no documents.}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{...and we're looking at nigerian crude...}
<C>__{montoya}
<D>__{precursor shipments from ras tanura and ju'aymah?}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{transshipped to a malaysian container ship.}
<C>__{montoya}
<D>__{not french registry?}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{they've been targeted. and pakistani registry is too vulnerable to search and seizure right now.}
<C>__{montoya}
<D>__{jose doesn't like the deal in south florida...}
<A>__{montoya's referring to crockett. alarm bells go off.}
<C>__{isabella}
<P>__{(cuts in)}
<D>__{burnett?}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{they want 22% of the value on loads they run into south florida. it's the juarez cartel model. they guarantee the loads. the upside is our risk goes to zero. that frees up capital.}
<C>__{montoya}
<D>__{but what does your intuition tell you...?}
<A>__{is he suspicious? does he suspect isabella and crockett are lovers?}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{my "intuition"...? my intuition made him breakfast the other morning in havana.}
<A>__{her lieson with crockett is the last thing we expected to hear from isabella.}
<C>__{montoya}
<D>__{and...?}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{they're serious. they're cautious. they'll forgo a deal over a technicality of how a delivery's handled...they'd walk away, rather than compromise operational security...that's good.}
<A>__{montoya's thoughtful.}
<C>__{isabella }
<D>__{but they have to be watched closely...}
<C>__{montoya}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{a good deal, like this with us, for burnett will be good only temporarily. he'll get restless because he believes nothing is forever. life is dust, make it while you can. he's ambitious.}
<A>__{montoya appreciates her thoughtfulness.}
<C>__{isabella }
<D>__{so i predict a few good runs. then there'll be a renegotiation.}
<C>__{montoya}
<D>__{that's my girl...}
<A>__{montoya uses isabella and her sexual allure to gather insight into the people he does business with. that's part of their deal.}
<C>__{montoya }
<D>__{on the next load, jose wants to front them silver. but they them in lead...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he thinks they are wrong. what do you think?}
<C>__{isabella}
<P>__{(revealing nothing)}
<D>__{i think jose suspects anybody he doesn't intimidate. and people, who are good at what they do? they have egos, too...}
<C>__{montoya}
<P>__{(careful)}
<D>__{what would you do...?}
<C>__{isabella}
<P>__{(equally careful)}
<D>__{i like the diminished risk. it frees up capital reserves. i like working with self interested businessmen who are competent. you can predict their behavior....}
<A>__{montoya looks at her very carefully. she stares right back at him.}
<C>__{isabella }
<D>__{on the other hand...if what you wish, mi corazon, is la plumba...the lead? then let's do that. accept their deal. after the load is received...we will close their eyes forever...}
<A>__{she looks at montoya squarely. it hangs in the air. in his strange process of decision making, montoya reaches a conclusion...}
<C>__{montoya}
<D>__{let's try a few runs with these partners, i think. i will tell jose...}
<A>__{if isabella is pleased, she doesn't show it. montoya continues to stare at her unwavering expression, frozen in stone. he smiles, then, and starts to take off her clothes. he reaches for her hand and brings her to him. she kisses him and he puts aside his cigar, pulls her face into his neck, and she runs her hands down him...}
