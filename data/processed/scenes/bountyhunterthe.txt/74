<D>__{it's ok, hang on, i'm coming...}
<A>__{gets the key in, pops the lid and sees: cass, handkerchief over her nose, pack of flaming matches in hand. cass tosses the matches and handkerchief, and punches milo in the balls. milo groans and crumbles to the ground. cass jumps out of the trunk and stands over him:}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{you know something, milo? you're one of the most gullible...}
<A>__{bam, milo grabs her ankle and jerks and cass hits the ground. next thing you know, it's wwf time, the two of them rolling}
