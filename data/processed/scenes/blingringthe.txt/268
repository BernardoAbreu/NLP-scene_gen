<L>__{interior prison bus day}
<A>__{marc sits next to a big, hard looking criminal. close on marc's face as he looks out the window, while the bus pulls away. light streams in on his pale face. he looks out as the los angeles streets go by. cut back to marc's young face looking out the window, music starts, and the bus drives out of frame.}
