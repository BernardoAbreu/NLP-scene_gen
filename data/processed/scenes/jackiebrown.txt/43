<A>__{closeup a knob is pulled out. jackie picks up a pack of mild seven's cigarettes from the bottom of a cigarette machine. she crosses the bar to join max, sitting at a small table waiting for her to return. the cockatoo inn is just what jackie was looking for. a dark and red cocktail lounge in hawthorne off of hawthorne boulevard by the apartment where the stewardess lives (about ten minutes from lax) the clientele of the cockatoo is an older, black crowd and an even older white crowd who'd been coming here years before it became a black bar. a jukebox plays soft, old school r&b. jackie and max sit side by side at a small table, lit by a bar candle in a red glass thing. max drinks bushmills over crushed ice. jackie drinks white wine. jackie opens her mild sevens, offering one to max.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{no thanks, i quit three years ago.}
<A>__{as she lights her cigarette.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you gain weight?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{ten pounds. i lose it and put it back on.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{that's why i don't quit. if i can't fly anymore, i'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{what's your brand?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{davidoffs. i get 'em in mexico. they're hard to find here. i was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{was she helpful?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{she was more helpful than the fuckin' public defender.}
<P>__{(she takes a sip of wine)}
<D>__{i don't know i guess what i need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you know, i figured out the other day i've written something like' fifteen thousand bonds since i've been in the business. i'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. if you want, i can help you look at your options.}
<A>__{jackie takes the talk in a different direction.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you're not tired of it?}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i am, as a matter of fact.}
<A>__{a moment of silence between them, they both take drinks.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{what have they told you?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{so far i've been told i can cooperate and get probation, maybe. or, i can stand mute and get as much as five years. does that sound right?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. that's state time. prison.}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(under her breath)}
<D>__{shit.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{but they won't want to take you to trial. they'll offer you simple possession, a few months of county time, and a year or two probation.}
<P>__{(pointing to her drink)}
<D>__{how 'bout another?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{max gestures to an older black cocktail waitress named rowen for two more.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you know who put the dope in your bag?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{yeah, but that's not what this was about. they were fuckin waitin' for my ass. they knew i had that money, they even knew the amount. the one who searched my bag, from l.a.p.d., dargus, hardly even looked at it. "oh, i'd say there's fifty thousand here. what would you say?" but all they could do was threaten me and hand me over to customs, and i could tell they didn't want to do that.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{they wanted you to tell them what you know.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i had 'em too. i burnt those two starky and hutch motherfuckers down. then their asses lucked out and found that coke.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{what did they want to know?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{who gave me the money and who i was giving it to. and some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. said it was him who told them 'bout me.}
<A>__{the waitress comes with the drinks.}
<C>__{rowen}
<D>__{can i get you two some popcorn?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{no, thanks.}
<A>__{rowen exits.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{that would be beaumont livingston.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{that's him. how do you know 'em?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i wrote him on monday. they found him dead on tuesday.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{ordell pick up his bond?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{same as you. ten thousand.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{the federal agent kinda half hinted ordell might of done beaumont.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you mentioned a guy from l.a.p.d., but you didn't mention the federal.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i didn't?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{no, you didn't. what branch?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{ray nicolet with alcohol, tobacco, and firearms.}
<A>__{max puts it together.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{he's the one who wants you.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{it was the other guy who busted me.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{'cause if he busted you, you'd play hell bonding out of federal court. he doesn't want you mad at him, he wants you to tell him what you know. he uses you to get a line on ordell, make a case, then take him federal. you know what ordell's into?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i have a pretty good idea. ordell aint no bootlegger and i doubt he's smugglin' cuban cigars. so that only leaves one thing an a.t.f. man would be interested in.}
<A>__{jackie waits a moment before answering, weighs things in her mind and makes a decision.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i used to bring over ten thousand at a time. that's the legal limit, so i never brought more than that.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{how many trips did you make?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{with ten thousand? nine.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{he's got that kinda money?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{it's all in lock boxes in a mexico bank. but he's got a problem. he's what do you call it when you got money, but don't have cash?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{cash poor?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{that's it. he's cash poor. he kept on me till i finally said okay. i will bring whatever fits in a nine by twelve envelope. i got paid five hundred dollars, and his friend, mr. walker, in mexico gave me the envelope.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{if you knew bringing anything over ten thousand was against the law, why not pack a hundred grand?}
<A>__{jackie gets exasperated.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{whatever it was had to fit in my bag and not hit you in the face if the bag was opened. this ain't solvin' my problem. i gotta figure out a way to either keep my job or get out of trouble. i'm of today, but if i can't leave the country i'm out of a job. and if i don't got a job, i can't hire a lawyer.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{ask a.t.f. they might give you permission.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{yeah, if i cooperate.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{well, jackie, you got caught, you're gonna have to give 'em something.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{but if all i can give 'em is ordell's name i don't really know shit about what he does or how he does it that don't give me much to bargain with.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{give 'em what you got. offer to help. show a willingness to be helpful. you want to stay out of jail, don't you?}
<A>__{max looks at jackie thinking about something.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{what'dya think?}
<B>__{closeup jackie}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i think maybe i have more options than i thought.}
