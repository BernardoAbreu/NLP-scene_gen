<L>__{interior chinatown night}
<A>__{we crane down from a chinese banner that stretches across two tenements. we land on the seedy, deserted street below as the sedan barrels into frame and squeals to a stop. two thugs emerge from the car. they pull spinner moochy from the trunk and toss his body by some garbage cans, knocking a few over. they get back in the car and speed away. moochy's lifeless foam body rolls into the gutter and lays motionless. blood seeps through his foamy torso.}
<B>__{low overhead shot}
<A>__{of spinner moochy. we slowly start to rise up as we look down at the rhino's body. the wind whistles through the empty street as we get higher. the chinese banner rustles through the frame. as we get higher and higher, we hear the intermittent clang of a prize fight bell.}
