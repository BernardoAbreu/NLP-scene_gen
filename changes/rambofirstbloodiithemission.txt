The MPs are grim-faced and walk in step. Trautman and a doctor SINGLETERRY silently walk through the corridor. They pass the open day-room where somnambulistic patients sit like statuary watching "The Young and the Restless" or watching the wallpaper fade. Bleak light from an overcast day filters through the barred window. The vets seem older than their years and although some show the physical scars of combat, there is no doubt that the greatest trauma for these men is behind the eyes. As they pass the open doors of the rooms of the "chronic ward", haunted eyes turn toward them. As they approach the nurse's station for the "chronic ward" the orderly nods.
