<L>__{exterior nottingham castle night}
<A>__{marked contrast. a forbidding fortress. cliff like battlements.}
<L>__{interior nottingham castle night}
<A>__{face like thunder, guy of gisborne strides up curving, stone steps. a long corridor leads to a guarded oak door.}
<C>__{sentry}
<D>__{sir guy. his lordship is not to be disturbed.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{away, fool.}
<A>__{he shoves the sentry aside.}
<L>__{exterior castle battlements night}
<A>__{torches illuminate nottingham's face. chilling cruelty in manson like eyes. seated, his manicured hand dis tractedly strokes a semi naked girl. she sits at his feet like a frightened dog. when gisborne enters, she covers up.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{who bade you cover up?}
<A>__{he smashes his fist into his chair. she timidly uncovers.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{cousin, i trust you justify your intrusion with news of profound value.}
<A>__{his attention is riveted on a dark niche in the corner of the courtyard. unearthly sounds emanate from the black ness.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{i met a hooded man today. he bade me warn you not to harm his people.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{his name?}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{robin of locksley.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{ha! the prodigal son returns. he is a whelp. this girl could best him.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{this whelp bested five of my men in the blink of an eye.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{your men were probably drunk. yet you survived, cousin?}
<A>__{heavy scorn. the sheriff pats gisborne's hand like a child's. the voice from the darkness becomes a loud chant. a wrinkled, monkey like figure dances into view, wearing a necklace of human fingers. you might think she was a hundred years old, if not for her incredible agility. mortianna.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{you brought her here?}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{quiet!}
<A>__{the crone's fingers dart into a bag. emerge with a writhing, squealing mass... a piglet. a knife flashes. blood spurts into an ornate, sacred platter. the girl flinches in horror. mortianna shakes the con tents of a pouch across the bloody dish. carved bone dice runes. she rattles the platter. the rune symbols dance in trails of blood. eyes vacant, mouth frothing, she hisses out her incoherent visions. nottingham follows her every move. a connoisseur.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{what do you see?}
<C>__{mortianna}
<D>__{change the seat of power.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{london?}
<C>__{mortianna}
<D>__{change it.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{move the capitol to nottingham? excellent. how?}
<C>__{mortianna}
<D>__{ally with royal blood.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{put someone on the throne and rule through him? who?}
<C>__{mortianna}
<D>__{that is not revealed.}
<A>__{the idea takes shape in nottingham's mind. mounting intensity.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{ally with royal blood. what else do you see?}
<C>__{mortianna}
<D>__{armies.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{whose?}
<C>__{mortianna}
<D>__{yours. men and weaponry in great numgers.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{and victory?}
<C>__{mortianna}
<D>__{much blood will be spilled.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{whose?}
<B>__{close shot}
<A>__{a dice splashes blood. lands a death's head symbol. mortianna hammers the platter. the dice spins and lands again. again the grinning skull.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{the tray smashes to the ground. the hag runs at gisborne.}
<C>__{mortianna}
<D>__{who have you seen?!}
<A>__{she shakes him. screams spittle in his face.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<P>__{(freaked)}
<D>__{no one. i have seen no one.}
<C>__{mortianna}
<D>__{you lie! a man... a painted man.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{what is wrong?}
<C>__{mortianna}
<D>__{i have seen my death.}
<A>__{she whimpers. spins, as if fearing invisible intruders.}
<C>__{mortianna}
<D>__{the painted man. he haunts my dreams.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{locksley has a companion. a dark skinned foreigner. he had the marked skin of islam.}
<A>__{mortianna trembles like an epileptic. eyes wide with terror.}
<C>__{mortianna}
<D>__{kill them! kill them!}
<A>__{she throws herself at nottingham for protection. he caresses her. gisborne is thunderstruck.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{cousin. prove to locksley that your survival was his last mistake.}
<C>__{mortianna}
<P>__{(frantic)}
<D>__{and the painted man! kill him.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{kill them both.}
<A>__{he continues to stroke her. her trembling subsides.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{you have done well, mortianna. exceedingly well. no one shall harm you, i swear it.}
<A>__{mortianna reaches out bloodied fingers towards the young girl, who shrinks away. nottingham gently takes the girl's hand. draws it to his mouth, as if to kiss it... and bites down viciously, drawing blood. the girl screams.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{now, my child, mortianna's kisses will seem soft, like an angel's.}
<P>__{(to mortianna)}
<D>__{take her. you have earned her.}
<A>__{mortianna grabs the terrified girl's wrist. drags her away.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{it is madness bringing the hag here.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{fear not for my sanity, guy. for in madness, there is great power.}
