"mars recovery" (formerly mars two) looks much like its sister craft on mars: a conical cockpit mounted above a "tuna can" crew hab module. super title: "mars recovery. mission day 172." the entire lower deck forms a segmented section of the hull that rotates on bearings to provide artificial gravity; we see window ports spinning past, then an american flag emblem. behind this lower deck, in an extending network of struts, like the abdomen of a dragonfly, are the three huge round propellant tanks. then vast, delicate looking rectangular solar panels, which sweep out to either side of the ship; these also bear the dish of the earth pointing hi gain antenna. and finally comes the great mass of the engine bells, housed within a curving aeroshell; three hatches in the aeroshell can open to allow the main thrusters to fire through for a mid course burn.}
