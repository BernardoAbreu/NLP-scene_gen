<L>__{interior trafalgar hospital. ward. nikolai's room day}
<D>__{nikolai is playing chess against himself, sitting on the bed, trying hard to concentrate. there is a knock and anna enters, carrying an old shopping bag. she takes out a worn pair of jeans and a t shirt, a denim jacket and a battered pair of shoes. nikolai smiles...}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{how is uncle stepan? instead of answering, anna lays the clothes on the bed.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(deadpan)}
<D>__{they're from the morgue. they belonged to someone who died yesterday. nikolai picks up the jeans and examines them. they're way too big.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{i can't believe i'm doing a favor for someone just because he had the decency not to murder a member of my family. nikolai smiles but anna turns to leave...}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{hey... wait a minute... nikolai steps behind the bed screen to pull on the jeans. he speaks from behind the screen.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{is your bike still working ok? a pause. anna considers leaving but hesitates.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{yeah. it's ok. nikolai steps out from behind the screen, the baggy jeans tightly belted, his chest bare. for the first time anna sees the extent of nikolai's body tattoos and reacts.... nikolai sees her reaction to the tattoos and doesn't care for it. he grabs the t shirt and pulls it on.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{did you get in touch with tatiana's family in russia?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{good. nikolai is now dressed, his cut and tattooed arms still showing.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{so the baby's still in england. a pause. anna nods.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{she's staying here for good. they peer at each other.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{why do you care? nikolai shrugs and grabs the shoes.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{stepan said you were kind to him. he said you were risking your own life to keep him alive. nikolai laughs.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{yeah, and all the thanks i get is a pair of dead man's shoes.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i listen to you.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{do you really?}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{yes. about semyon and the baby. thank you.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(still wary)}
<D>__{you thank me for that? their eyes lock across a huge divide. he rubs the tattoos on his arm.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<P>__{(indicating tattoos)}
<D>__{these things are just marks on the skin, you know? anna nods. an awkward pause, then anna turns and leaves quickly.}
