<A>__{a well kept older home, well planted, pretty. a woman of nearly 60 is tending the flowers. she hears someone approaching the gate in the wooden fence. she looks up. sharon is at the gate, in uniform, on her dinner break. the older woman is her mother, elaine pogue. there is an old strain between them, a sadness and a nervousness in elaine. she's a quiet woman. she smiles at her daughter as sharon comes through the gate. they hug tentatively, a lot of baggage here. sharon turns to the garden.}
