<A>__{cable sits down next to window. the helicopter begins to rise. camera goes into a medium close shot of cable against the helicopter window. the helicopter ascends in front of a very tall office building made up of endless glass squares. a telephoto lens brings the glass squares of the building directly against cable's head and shoulders giving us the feeling that cable is almost levitating by himself. as one floor after another disappears behind him we see an almost manic exhultation in cable's face; as if he is on top of things once more.}
