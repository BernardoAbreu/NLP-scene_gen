<A>__{the sun is just rising on the rko lot. we note a sign on the wall by the sound stage door: citizen kane. rko production #281. director: orson welles}
<B>__{absolutely no admittance.}
<L>__{int rko sound stage following}
<A>__{absolute silence. welles stands in the mammoth sound stage and looks around, it is as if he has entered a great cathedral. a few lights illuminate portions of the stage and giant lighting rigs and scaffolding soar to the unseen ceiling miles away. the xanadu great hall set awaits. welles slowly walks to the set and stands, surveying his domain, savoring the moment. title: july 30, 1940 he clears his throat and speaks, rehearsing his first day speech to the cast and crew. his voice echoes.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{today we }
<A>__{he stops, surprised by the echo.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{today we are going to break every rule in motion picture history...}
<A>__{no . . we are going to shatter every rule in today we are going to shatter the hallowed busts of griffith and demille and ford. we are going to show the world a new way of seeing. together we will blaze a trail... as welles continues to rehearse we slowly ascend the scaffolding and lighting rigs...}
<C>__{welles' voice}
<D>__{together we will throw away all the maps and we will become joyously lost in the wilderness. and the future cartographers of hollywood will forever chart our course. following our lead...}
<A>__{we continue to ascend and finally discover two electricians on the upper catwalk, staring down in amusement, much like the two stagehands at the opera in kane.}
<C>__{welles' voice}
<D>__{and do you know why we're going to do this?}
<A>__{again to welles on the stage floor: a beat. welles slowly smiles.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{we're going to do this because it's going to be fun.}
<A>__{above, one of the electrician's throws the switch on a huge spotlight. welles is captured in the vibrant white light and benny goodman's immortal "sing, sing, sing" immediately explodes and we are into:}
<B>__{the making of citizen kane}
<A>__{a camera crane sweeps dramatically to the ceiling of the sound stage and brilliant white lights flash on. a film clapper snaps: citizen kane. rko production 281 director:}
<B>__{orson welles.}
<A>__{and we see welles racing heroically into making his first movie: in varying kane makeups he tears through scenes and actors: laughing with agnes moorehead on the cabin set; charming ruth warrick on the breakfast table set; berating dorothy commingore on the great hall set... he speeds back and forth and back and forth from the set to the camera in the campaign headquarters set, never happy with the shot. . . gregg toland watches, bemused, as welles shifts tiny prop pieces on the set. . . welles bullies and screams and pleads and seduces. like an obsessed artistic tornado he is seemingly everywhere at once. we see him rejecting matte paintings and in makeup and rewriting the script and trying on costumes and selecting props and leaping into odd positions looking for the perfect camera angle. it is very important in this sequence that we see the pressure building ... building ... building ... on welles. "sing, sing, sing" continues on the xanadu stairway set welles behind the camera, filming actor paul stewart}
<C>__{paul stewart}
<D>__{"rosebud? i will tell you about rosebud.}

<D>__{"rosebud? i will tell you about rosebud.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{again}
<A>__{"sing. sing, sing" continues... in a corner of the sound stage: welles, in full kane makeup, studies a miniature model of the kane campaign headquarters set through a tiny periscope with cinematographer gregg toland.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{it needs a ceiling, gregg. real rooms have real ceilings.}
<C>__{gregg toland}
<D>__{you want a ceiling on this one too?}

<C>__{welles}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{no, it's gonna be impossible. that's why we're doing it.}
<A>__{sing, sing, sing" continues back on the xanadu stairway set: poor paul stewart, now at his wit's ends, continues:}
<C>__{paul stewart}
<D>__{"rosebud? i will tell you about rosebud."}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{again}

<C>__{paul stewart}
<D>__{"rosebud? i will tell you about rosebud}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{again}
<A>__{paul stewart screams and collapses. "sing, sing, sing" continues... on the atlantic city nightclub set: welles watches as the camera crane attempts the dizzying and difficult maneuver from the skylight at the top of the set down to dorothy commingore as susan alexander below. the camera crane goes out of control and crashes through some light fixtures and swings crazily down toward dorothy commingore. she yelps and leaps away as the camera barrels through the table and smashes to the floor. welles stands next to toland. a beat.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{well, that didn't really work}
<A>__{"sing, sing, sing" continues. back on the, xanadu stairway set paul stewart, dazed and shattered, is listening intently. welles stands with his arms around stewart, embracing him, whispering into his ear.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{it is the most important line of the picture. you will weave the magic of "rosebud" in a single word you will say the word in such a way as to impart to us the mystery of it. it is a divine and sinister mystery worthy only of your talent. in this one word the movie soars or falls. once more, i beg you.}
<A>__{stewart nods. the film clapper: take 178. the cameraman leans into the viewfinder. we see his black and white view of the shot through the lens then: in a cramped editing room we see welles watching the scene on an old editing moviola. on the moviola we see paul stewart taking a deep breath and then, magnificently:}
<C>__{paul stewart}
<P>__{(on moviola)}
<D>__{"rosebud? i will tell you about rosebud."}
<C>__{welles' voice}
<P>__{(on moviola)}

<A>__{on the moviola we see stewart laugh hysterically and dance away. in the editing room, welles shakes his head}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{actors.}
<A>__{"sing, sing, sing" continues. on the campaign headquarters set: welles and toland lie on the floor of the campaign headquarters set and gaze up through viewfinders. they squirm about on the floor and laugh to one another about their newest outlandish idea. then toland notices something in the catwalks high above the set. a redheaded electrician.}
<D>__{toland orson, you see that electrician up there? the redhead.}
<A>__{he was on grapes of wrath. he's a free lance studio spy. probably reports right back to the rko boys in new york. welles slowly stands and thunders:}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{stop everybody stop!}
<A>__{all the flurried activity on the sound stage immediately stops. every eye turns, terrified, to welles. welles glares up at the redheaded electrician}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{you come down here!}
<A>__{the electrician slowly climbs down from the rafters. welles rivets him every step of the way. the electrician stops before welles.}
<C>__{electrician}
<D>__{mr. welles...?}
<A>__{a tense beat and then welles fiercely and purposefully spits in the electrician's face. the electrician recoils, stunned.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{get out}
<A>__{welles returns to toland as the electrician slinks off "sing, sing, sing" continues as: we see the magnificent film emerging. welles watching scenes in a screening room, his feet up, exhausted, almost asleep, a cigar dangling from his lips... we see rushes of welles going through scenes with dorothy commingore as susan alexander. he is relentless with her off camera, driving her to the harridan outbursts he wants just before he steps into the shot... we see the crew observing, with great amusement, welles' stumbling attempts to learn the "charlie kane" dance... we see toland shifting lights to achieve deep focus cross fades. welles rages as the difficult process eats up time... we see welles growing increasingly manic. the long hours and the pressure are clearly taking a toll.. we return to the screening room. welles is now fully asleep. his cigar falls from his mouth and begins smoldering on his suit. "sing, sing, sing" fades at... on a xanadu set: filming a scene. welles, in old kane makeup, is sitting with dorothy commingore as susan alexander. he is curiously distracted. she is pouring tea in the scene:}
<C>__{dorothy commingore}
<D>__{"charlie, you sure got the funniest ways of looking at things . "}
<A>__{welles does not respond. he breaks character}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{no no i will pour the tea. sorry. i should pour the tea. let's try that again.}
<A>__{toland stands behind the camera and watches welles. there is obviously something wrong.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{okay, here we go... set. action}
<A>__{welles pops into character and pours the tea in the scene as:}
<C>__{dorothy commingore}
<D>__{"charlie, you sure got the funniest ways of looking at things . "}
<A>__{welles stops, breaks character again:}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{no that's not right}
<A>__{he clears his throat and glances at the enormous crew, all staring back at him expectantly.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{urn. . . ah . . . yes you should definitely pour the tea. okay, again. sorry.... set. action.}
<A>__{they start the scene again. she pours the tea}
<C>__{dorothy commingore}
<D>__{"charlie, you sure got the funniest ways of looking at things . "}
<A>__{a pause as she waits for his reply in the scene he sits, frozen.}
<C>__{toland}
<D>__{orson, you wanna take five?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{five...? yes. no. we're done today}
<A>__{he slowly walks off the set as he nervously pulls at his tie, tearing it off. toland watches him go.}
