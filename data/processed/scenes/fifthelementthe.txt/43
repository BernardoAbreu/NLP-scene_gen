<L>__{interior korben's apartment day}
<A>__{a thermo nuclear explosion fills a t.v. screen..which korben's cat watches with interest. korben is about to exit the apartment.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{don't watch it all day, it'll rot your mind. bye sweetie..}
<A>__{in response, the cat meows. korben opens the door to..a huge gun, brandished by a nervous mugger, pointing right in his face.}
<C>__{mugger}
<D>__{the cash man!}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{been here long?}
<C>__{mugger}
<D>__{don't fuck with me man or i will blow you into tomorrow!}
<A>__{unperterbed, korben looks at the mugger's fearsome weapon.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{isn't that a z140? alleviated titanium. neuro charged assault model?}
<C>__{mugger}
<P>__{(off balance)}
<D>__{uh..}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{you know you could hurt someone with this puppy..good thing it's not loaded..}
<A>__{the mugger is lost. he looks at his weapon.}
<C>__{mugger}
<D>__{it's not?}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{you gotta push the little yellow button...}
<A>__{korben points to the button on the side of the gun. the mugger takes his advice.}
<C>__{mugger}
<D>__{thanks..}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{you're welcome..}
<A>__{and with lightning speed, korben blasts the mugger with a straight right hand, sending him down for the count. korben retrieves the gun.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{..you know these things are very illegal.. you could get in a shit load of trouble.. i better hang onto it for you..}
<A>__{as the mugger clears his head, korben opens a drawer next to him which is full of similar guns! the mugger's eyes pop out of his head. he scampers to his feet and runs off. korben shrugs, exits his apartment, and closes the door. the cat watches a nuclear holocaust on t.v., uninterrupted.}
