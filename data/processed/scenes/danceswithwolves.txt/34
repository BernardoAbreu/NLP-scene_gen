<L>__{exterior sedgewick bluff dusk}
<A>__{a solitary wolf trots along the top of a bluff overlooking the river. he has two white socks running up his front legs. an old jagged scar cuts across his muzzle. he's watching the ruins of fort sedgewick. the little band of troops, all on foot, with their two lame horses trailing behind are fading in the distance.}
<L>__{exterior wagon camp dawn}
<A>__{the wagon is parked in a shallow depression, its team unhitched. under the wagon the forms of two men lay curled up in blankets. dunbar is sleeping peacefully, his nose pressed against a jacket. now his nostrils begin to twitch. his face turns sour and he wakes to find that he's been sleeping against the stink of timmons. flies buzz about the teamster's sleeping body. dunbar quickly pulls away from the bad smell. he rolls out from under the wagon and clambers to his feet. lieutenant dunbar looks out over the prairie. it's going to be a spectacular day. in the far distance, a column of buzzards is circling. dunbar has paused to watch them. he ducks back under the wagon.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{timmons... timmons.}
<A>__{no response from the deep sleeping driver. dunbar starts to move closer to shake him awake but the odor under there makes him think twice. he snatches up the arrow and probes under the wagon.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{timmons.}
<A>__{the teamster comes awake with a squeal, he joins dunbar staring up at the circling birds.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{something's out there...}
<C>__{timmons}
<D>__{somethin' dead.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{might have a look.}
<C>__{timmons}
<D>__{might stay clear of whatever did the killin'.}
<A>__{timmons' mood is different now. he begins to hitch the team with a new sense of urgency.}
