<L>__{exterior andy's house day}
<A>__{joan hurries out of the house and runs down the drive way toward the low rider calling out:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{socorro!! wait a minute! i want to talk to you!}
<A>__{the low rider comes to a stop. joan approaches the pas senger window and leans down to socorro:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{excuse me, socorro, but do you mind if i ask what's happening, why are you leaving?}
<C>__{socorro}
<D>__{no se, lo siento.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i'm asking, where are you going?}
<C>__{socorro}
<P>__{(indicating balto)}
<D>__{esto me yerno, balthazar. you speak please balto para mi.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{yes, what's going on, are you bringing her back later or what?}
<C>__{balto}
<D>__{yeah, monday i bring her back.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{monday? but this is thursday, i can't stay here alone 'til monday.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{it's my understanding that socorro lived here, otherwise, i would've made other plans.}
<C>__{socorro}
<D>__{si, lunes, lunes.}
<C>__{balto}
<D>__{yeah, but she got her time off, too, man, you know.}
<A>__{joan straightens up, sighing angrily and looking up at the house:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{well, this is just glorious.}
<A>__{the low rider moves down the driveway and as it disap pears onto the street, joan moves to an electric box atop a metal column at the edge of the driveway. she presses the button and looks at the gates. they remain open. she steps over to the gates and tries to close them manually. the locking device fails to engage and a portion of it falls off into the bushes.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{as she leans down to look for the fallen part, a pickup truck can be seen parked down the street. the back of the driver's head (butch gable) can be seen and on the side panel of the truck are the words "canyon tree surgeons."}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{giving up on the gates, joan turns and moves with evident reluctance up the driveway, passing a three car garage in which her mercedes and another car hidden under a trap can be seen.}
