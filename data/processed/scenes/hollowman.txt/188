<L>__{interior corridor}
<A>__{the three of them approach the supply room door slowly. blood trickles from under the door and bloody footprints extend down the hallway. they swing open the door. the floor is covered in blood and broken glass. but no body.}
<L>__{interior corridor}
<A>__{sarah, broken, is dragged toward the chair, eerily jerking down the hallway... seemingly on its own.}
<L>__{interior corridor}
<A>__{the three scientists follow the bloody footprints down the hallway past the empty cages in the tunnel of habitats. all clutch their tranquilizer pistols. the footprints lead past the habitats to sebastian's chamber. they see sarah's body in the dim light.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{oh god. sarah!}
<A>__{the group breaks into a run. linda pushes into the chamber and falls at sarah's side. matt cradles sarah's head. they look for some sign of life as linda fights back the tears.}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{her too?}
<A>__{matt nods. linda slams the cubicle wall with her fist.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{this didn't happen. this hasn't happened.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{it happened alright. now we have to deal with it.}
<A>__{matt puts his hands on her shoulder to calm her. she pushes him off.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah? and just what are we supposed to do now?}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{now? now you die.}
<A>__{the three of them whip around.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{he's here!}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{sebastian!}
<A>__{silence. the three cautiously move out. they stand back to back, each one facing out. they move toward the door of the chamber.}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{sebastian. sebastian, listen to me.}
<A>__{no response. they all their tranq pistols level waiting for some sign. hearing each other breathe. they slowly move outside the chamber into the corridor.}
<C>__{linda }
<D>__{i don't know if you can understand this, but what you're experiencing is a psychological breakdown. this isn't who you are.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{i would say that what i am experiencing is psychological awareness. i like you being in complete and absolute control.}
<A>__{they identify the general area the voice is coming from: back inside the chamber! they slowly move toward the chamber door. with lightning speed they slam the door shut, locking sebastian inside the recovery chamber.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{you goddamn bastard! you goddamn bastard. you're gonna pay for this. i'm going to bring you back to visibility and then i'm going throw your ass in jail.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{you're never gonna bring me back linda. i never want to come back.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{or maybe i will fuck you. one last time for old times sake.}
<A>__{linda slams her fist against the wall of the chamber.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{don't listen to him. it's not worth it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{come on, matt. let's go get the elevator back on line so we can got out of this hell hole.}
<A>__{matt gives linda a kiss...}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{he does anything, anything at all, come get us. i will be back to check on you in five.}
<A>__{matt and frank head off down the corridor.}
<C>__{sebastian's voice}
<D>__{imagine you two, carrying on right under my nose. out of curiosity, what did he give you that i couldn't?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{shut up, sebastian. he's more of a man than you'll ever be.}
