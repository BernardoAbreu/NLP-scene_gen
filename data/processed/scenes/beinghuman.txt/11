<L>__{exterior beach night}
<A>__{it is fully dark now. on the beach the raiders have set up a comfortable camp with a large fire. we are still with hector. he has come down from his bleak hiding place in the hills. the smell of fire and food and con cern for his family, have drawn him here. he is hiding somewhere way off from the camp, but close enough to observe it. what he sees disturbs him, but for odd reasons. his family appear to be happily integrated with the raiders. his two children have become fast friends with the man who coaxed them from the tree. his woman is with a larger group closer to the fire. they are playfully attempting to communicate with her, and although still a little timid, she is smiling. there is no hint of bar barity, rape or abuse. that was not the intention of the raiders. to them, a fertile woman and two healthy children are as gold will be to plunderers of later ages. for their part, the family have to accept the situation. food and shelter are the best that life can offer. painfully, hector takes in the reality of the scene. his family have been stolen from him, plain and simple. in the morning they will be gone, out to sea and round the headland forever. he watches them for a while longer, then it becomes too painful. he retreats into the dark ness and up into the empty hills again.}
