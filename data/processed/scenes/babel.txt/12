<L>__{exterior desert day}
<D>__{the brothers are sitting apart from each other. ahmed guards the goats with the rifle on his lap. after a while, yussef goes to sit behind a large rock. he makes sure his brother isn't watching and he pulls his pants down to start masturbating.}
<A>__{when he is at his most concentrated, a shot rings out and startles him. he quickly pulls his pants up and another shot rings out. yussef gets up to see what his brother is doing. ahmed is aiming the rifle at a rock some two hundred yards away. he fires a third time. yussef runs up to him.}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{ahmed doesn't pay attention, and focuses on the rock in the distance.}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{hassan said that it could hit things three kilometers away, but it can't even reach that rock over there.}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{that's because you don't know how to shoot. give me the rifle.}
<A>__{ahmed looks at his brother defiantly, then hands the rifle over. yussef aims and fires. the shot echoes through the vast desert; the frightened goats scamper a few yards away.}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{see, it can't reach it.}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{give me another bullet.}
<A>__{yussef aims and fires. the bullet hits the rock and kicks up a lot of whitish dust.}
<C>__{yussef }
<D>__{see.}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{yeah, but that's not three kilometers.}
<A>__{ahmed remains pensive and suddenly starts climbing to the top of the hill. once at the top, he looks around for a moment and then calls his brother.}
<C>__{ahmed }
<D>__{yussef, come here.}
<A>__{yussef climbs the slope. ahmed signals a road that in the distance cuts across the great desert plain, and points out a traffic sign that indicates a curve ahead.}
<C>__{ahmed }
<D>__{i bet you the bullet can't hit that far away.}
<A>__{ahmed loads the rifle and aims at the sign. he fires and nothing.}
<C>__{ahmed }
<D>__{these fucking bullets aren't any good.}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{you're not aiming right.}
<A>__{yussef points at a yellow car driving along the road.}
<C>__{yussef }
<D>__{what'll you give me if i hit that car?}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{i will shoot.}
<A>__{ahmed reloads. the empty cartridge falls to the ground. he fires again the car keeps going. yussef asks for the rifle.}
<C>__{ahmed }
<D>__{you see? nothing happens.}
<C>__{yussef}
<D>__{let me shoot.}
<A>__{he also drops the used cartridge on the ground, reloads and shoots the traffic sign. he fires and nothing.}
<C>__{ahmed}
<D>__{i told you. hassan's a liar.}
<A>__{a bus approaches. ahmed points at it.}
<C>__{ahmed }
<D>__{shoot at that one...}
<A>__{yussef loads the rifle parsimoniously, shuts the chamber, raises the weapon, aims and fires. the bus drives on. ahmed turns to his brother.}
<C>__{ahmed }
<D>__{see: nothing.}
<A>__{the bus drives on another three hundred yards and suddenly stops in the middle of the road.}
