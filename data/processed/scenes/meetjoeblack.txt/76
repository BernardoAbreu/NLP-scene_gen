<L>__{exterior lawns, country estate night}
<A>__{joe makes his way down the path from parrish's study, a weight on his shoulders, his step measured, within himself until he is hit by the lights and laughter and music of the party. he drifts into the center and runs right into susan, couples swirl about them, the eye of a storm of gaiety.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{hello, joe. what'd you know?}
<A>__{she smiles.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{there's something so indescribably sexy about you in a crowd. i could make love to you right here.}
<A>__{he hesitates, reaches out to take her hand, studies it.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{if you're going to tell my future, you're on the wrong side.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{there is something i do want to tell you }
<A>__{he stammers into silence.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{but you can't.}
<A>__{joe is about to respond but doesn't.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{just then when you hesitated the way you shift from foot to foot, i've always found endearing but just now i got a chill.}
<A>__{but he drifts again, now she takes his hand.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{remember that morning in the coffee shop? you said 'what's wrong with taking care of a woman, she takes care of you "}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{did i say that?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{and i said you'd have a hard time finding a woman like that.}
<A>__{joe shifts, she smiles at his embarrasement.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{well, you've found one, joe.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{the 'coffee shop' }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{ that was the place... and you were the guy.}
<A>__{joe seems resigned now, the air gone out of him.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{and you said you didn't want me to be your doctor because you didn't want me to examine you ?}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{well, i got to examine you after all }
<A>__{joe blinks, at a loss.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{i could come with you }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i uh }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you want me to wait for you, you'll be back }
<A>__{joe doesn't answer, susan is suddenly anxious.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{why do i want this night to last forever?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{don't you know, that's what i want more than anything.}
<A>__{he touches her face.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you said before you couldn't tell me who or where, only the 'when' is when now?}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{may i kiss you?}
<A>__{she waits. he kisses her, they fall into a deep embrace.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{that felt like a goodbye.}
<A>__{joe's silence is heavy.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{what's going on, joe? i feel like we're lifting off }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i'm still here.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{but you're not. you're somewhere else.}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{you're someone else }
<A>__{joe is struggling with a response, finally, inevitably, he drifts into a long silence. susan is beside herself, her emotions tossed in every direction, joe steadies her.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{tell me you love me tell me you love me now }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i love you now, i will love you always }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{hold me }
<A>__{he holds on tight to her. they are desperately entwined until finally she releases him.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{susan }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{ yes?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{thank you for loving me.}
<A>__{she smiles wanly, joe leaves her.}
