<D>__{what's wrong, dennis? why're you so pissed off?}
<A>__{it's weird the way mars is acting, so calm and all. but dennis can see the feat in jennifer's face and her swollen eyes. she manages one word }
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{please...}
<A>__{dennis tries to aim past her }
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{this fuck killed kevin. there's blood everywhere down there }
<A>__{jennifer sobs. and when she does mars charges across the room holding jennifer like a shield. dennis hesitates only a heartbeat, and then it's too late jennifer crashes into him, the full force of mars's weight behind her, knocking dennis backward into the hall }
