<A>__{this is a decrepit, illegal loft. the boys enter, hang their rosaries by the door and begin taking off their clothes. connor sits naked on the couch and gently places a bag of ice on his crotch. murphy stands naked in the open quantity shower. murphy turns on the water and sticks his hand in the stream.}
