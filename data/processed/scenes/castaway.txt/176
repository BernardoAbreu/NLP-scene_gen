<L>__{interior cave that day}
<A>__{the sun is setting on his darkened cave. the soccer ball sits in the corner by the black cold ashes of what was once his fire. chuck carves a bit of coconut meat, takes a bite and winces as the meat hits his sore tooth. he tosses the shell on a small new pile of shells. chuck shakes out the last half tylenol tablet. he puts the tablet in his mouth, then takes a sip out of his coconut canteen. when the water hits his tooth that hurts too.}
