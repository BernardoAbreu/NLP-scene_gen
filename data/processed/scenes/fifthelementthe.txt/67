<L>__{interior warehouse day}
<A>__{a group of handsome warriors approaches. aknot, their leader has the sacred case in his hands. the metal handle is missing but the second metal glove is still grasping the case.}
<C>__{zorg}
<P>__{(pretending to be worried)}
<D>__{aknot? is that you?}
<A>__{the leader nods. a disgusted look stamps zorg's features.}
<C>__{zorg}
<D>__{...what an ugly face! doesn't suit you at all! take it off...}
<A>__{aknot's face burns away revealing the head of a monstrous mangalore.}
<C>__{zorg}
<D>__{that's better! never be ashamed of who you are... you're warriors... be proud...}
<A>__{aknot says nothing, but if his eyes could talk!}
<C>__{zorg}
<D>__{so what if the federal army crushed your entire race and scattered your people to the wind... your time for revenge is at hand... voila... the zf1.}
<A>__{he takes out a weapon from one a crate and goes into a sales pitch.}
<C>__{zorg}
<P>__{(very fast)}
<D>__{...it's light... the handle's adjustable for easy carrying... good for righties and lefties.}
<A>__{meanwhile, two men set up a mannequin rigged with various defense mechanisms at the far end of the warehouse.}
<C>__{zorg}
<D>__{... breaks down into four parts, undetectable by x rays.. it's the ideal weapon for quick, discreet interventions. a word on fire power: titanium recharger. 3000 round clip with bursts of 3 to 300. with the replay button, another zorg innovation, it's even easier... one shot.}
<A>__{he fires at the mannequin.}
<C>__{zorg}
<D>__{... and replay sends every following shot to the same location...}
<A>__{zorg spins around, the rounds all hit the mannequin.}
<C>__{zorg}
<P>__{(even faster)}
<D>__{i recharge, but the enemy has launched a cowardly sneak attack from behind, the automirror takes care of that. gives me the time to turn around and finish the job. 300 round bursts, then there are the zorg oldies...}
<A>__{he fires off each item he names.}
<C>__{zorg}
<D>__{...rocket launcher. the always efficient flame thrower... my favorite. our famous net launcher, the arrow launcher, with exploding or poisonous gas heads very practical. and for the grand finale, the all new ice cube system!}
<A>__{the mannequin has been blasted into a pile of ashes covered by a net,. stuck with arrows, the whole mess frozen solid. he tosses the weapon into aknot's hands.}
<C>__{zorg}
<D>__{...four full crates, delivered right on time! what about you, my dear aknot, did you bring me what i asked you for?}
<A>__{aknot sets the case on a crate. zorg gloats while stroking the case.}
<C>__{zorg}
<D>__{...magnificent.}
<A>__{zorg smiles, takes a deep breath, opens the case. it's empty}
