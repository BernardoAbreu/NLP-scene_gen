<L>__{exterior hilltop morning}
<A>__{the knight, above the fog, hears the battle commence below. he spurs his horse and starts down into the mist.}
<L>__{exterior plain morning}
<A>__{the two opposing clans are now one confused mass of tartan and clashing swords. the air is charged with shouts of ex citement, agony, and the shrill of bag pipes. the fog has made each man's battle his own, each isolated with his opponent.}
<B>__{the knight}
<A>__{rides calmly through the fracas. he strikes and kills those that assault him, but appears disinterested in battle. he is looking.}
<B>__{conor}
<A>__{is standing above the twitching body of his friend. alone and confused, conor has become seperated from the clan. he stumbles through the fog, seeking help. suddenly he is alone with the knight. the face of iron locks its gaze onto the boy. his fear turned to panic, conor turns and flees. the knight, his resolve steeled in a raised sword, kicks his horse into persuit. conor is easily overtaken and on his first pass the knight brings his blade down hard into conor's shoulder, slicing open most of the boy's back and knocking him face first into the heather. as conor watches his own blood spew forth, he rolls over in time to see the knight dismount and start for him.}
<B>__{the knight}
<A>__{leans down next to conor, his metal face nearly against the boy's. his voice slithers out of the iron in almost a whisper.}
<C>__{knight}
<D>__{there can be but one.}
<B>__{a clansman}
<A>__{charges out of the fog and attacks the knight, who cuts him nearly in half. another wanders in and meets the same fate. the battle is shifting to where they are. not finished yet with conor, the knight is finding himself forced into retreat from an ever increasing number of assail ants.}
<B>__{a vassal}
<A>__{sees his men being hacked apart trying to stop the now mounted knight.}
<D>__{vassal #1 leave him!}
<A>__{the clansmen obey. with the slap of an armored gauntlet against his steed, the knight disappears into the fog. the vassal surveys the carnage before him. his eyes fall a moment on the moaning, gurgling conor. the vassal turns and leaves the boy for dead.}
