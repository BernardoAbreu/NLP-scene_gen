<L>__{exterior sewage filtration plant predawn}
<A>__{sewage water bubbles in huge tanks. a workman walks down catwalks above the tank, disengaging the larger pieces of debris from the filter areas with grappling hooks. shoes, tires, rags... a grinding sound is heard. the workman yells out to a control booth above.}
<C>__{workman}
<D>__{hold up! we gotta block on filter d.}
<A>__{sound of the pump coming to a halt. the workman walks to the filter area. he sinks his grappling hook into the polluted waters.}
<B>__{underwater shot}
<A>__{spooky, silent. the grappling hook moves like a scythe to the filter... ...past long, soft filaments of ragged tissue... ...and connects with a larger form.}
<B>__{above water}
<A>__{the workman feels the grappling hook connecting. he gives a yank, hooking whatever it is. he begins pulling it up. a pale form bubbles to the surface. the workman's face goes pale.}
<C>__{workman}
<D>__{oh, god...}
<A>__{a grating voice from the control booth is heard over the p.a.}

<C>__{voice}
<D>__{what's the problem?}
<A>__{it take the workman a moment to speak.}
<C>__{workman}
<D>__{i think it's a baby!}
<A>__{the workman pulls the form (as if that will do any good) toward the edge of the tank. he bends down, and now gets his first good look at it. the workman screams. his grappling hook falls from his hand, into the sewage.}
