<T>__{we see what he sees:}
<A>__{a giant renaissance style fresco covers the entire ceiling. flocks of angels fly above a goddess. cherubs. heralds. pentcho's face flushes. he's exhilarated. she takes note:}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{but only if you live your life that way. if you experience every moment as discovery.}
<A>__{pentcho's already there. he kicks his legs out. joyrides on the tug rope, arcing back and forth like a mad pendulum.}
<C>__{pentcho}
<D>__{mia! you're restoring heaven with dabs of painterior you're bringing new order to the universe.}
<A>__{she beams from his excitement.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{i always said we were in the same business...}
<A>__{his wayward motion swings him straight into her. they lock arms. the ropes shudder.}
<C>__{pentcho}
<D>__{if you're right, we have a chance. (beat) to be together.}
<A>__{pentcho reaches out to kiss her. doesn't see that their collision has jogged the clutch on his harness rope. now it opens all the way. whoosh! in an instant, he's gripping air, falling at the speed of newton's discovery. he hurtles downward in slow motion. there's a sound rushing in behind him, the rumble of a mega earthquake. pentcho catches a glimpse up over his shoulder: the angels, the goddess, mia, all of it has been}
<B>__{sucked out of existence...}
<A>__{as pentcho's eyes stare for a millisecond at}
<B>__{the void. nothingness. nada.}
<A>__{and then he's falling again, accelerating toward his own last particle collision, when a voice murmurs from somewhere.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{i'm not done.}
<A>__{thwack! the safety line holds, dangling pentcho a meter above the stone floor.}
<D>__{23d interior xanadu some time later 23d}
<A>__{they camp on old couch cushions, side by side, staring up at the illuminated fresco. pentcho is bruised, battered, vulnerable.}
<C>__{pentcho}
<D>__{when i was a kid i used to snap my head back like a gunfighter on the draw, hoping to catch a glimpse behind me.}
<A>__{mia props her head up on one elbow.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{of what?}
<A>__{on the fresco: a chorus of angels}
<C>__{pentcho}
<D>__{god. i dunno. the eternal nothingness. mia.}
<A>__{it's a plea. she turns, stares directly into his eyes.}
<C>__{pentcho }
<D>__{the universe is snapping my head back. i'm losing my focus.}
<A>__{mia's face fills with light. her best smile.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{welcome, paul. welcome.}
<A>__{she traces a line from his forehead to the bridge of his nose, quoting yeats (from "the second coming") as a celebration:}
<C>__{mia }
<D>__{"things fall apart; the center will not hold. mere anarchy is loosed upon the world."}
<A>__{he pulls her close to him. they lie, spooned together, breathing in unison, gazing up at the painted heaven. a firefly enters from outside, flutters in the air above them, blushing a trace line of yellow light.}
<C>__{pentcho}
<D>__{an electron spoke to me yesterday. (beat) i swear.}
<A>__{mia tries to suppress a giggle. can't.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{what did it want?}
<C>__{pentcho}
<D>__{that's what it asked me. "what do you want?" i didn't answer. i was in the middle of an experiment.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{like now?}
<A>__{he hesitates, then surrenders to the fact.}
<C>__{pentcho}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{the firefly dances above them. pentcho sits up (and away from her). mock serious:}
<C>__{pentcho }
<D>__{did you know electrons have lovers?}
<A>__{mia notes his distance. faces him, cross legged.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{no. i didn't. (dryly) i'm listening.}
<C>__{pentcho}
<D>__{inside every semi conductor... you have two particles, with opposite charges, separated by an impassable barrier...}
<A>__{she looks, sees him disappear into his head.}
<C>__{pentcho }
<D>__{a strip of silicon, which for you and me would be like...}
<A>__{the vulnerability is gone. and mia, with it.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{she's in l.a., he's in the bay area }
<C>__{pentcho}
<P>__{(plowing ahead)}
<D>__{a five hundred foot thick steel wall. but the connection between these two electrons is so }
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{dysfunctional }
<C>__{pentcho}
<D>__{that they tunnel, magically, through any obstacle, defying the practical laws of physics, in order to end up together }
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{and glow happily ever after.}
<A>__{silence. the story hangs between them like a fog.}
<C>__{mia }
<D>__{don't science me paul. (beat) what do you want?}
<A>__{on pentcho's face: it's blank. mia looks up at the angels, closes her eyes, turns away. (omit scenes 24, 25, 26, 27, 28)}
