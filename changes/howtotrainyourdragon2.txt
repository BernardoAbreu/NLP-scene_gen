<DIAL>__{This... is Berk. The best kept secret this side of, well, anywhere. Granted, it may not look like much, but this wet heap of rock packs more than a few surprises.}
<ACTION>__{ON A CLUSTER OF SHEEP, hiding nervously between buildings as shadows of passing dragons race by. The group moves as one, receding into a shadowy alley, pushing one sheep out into the light. It's suddenly snatched and carried into the air!}
<CHAR>__{HICCUP } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{Life here is amazing, just not for the faint of heart. See, where most folks enjoy hobbies like whittling or needlepoint, we Berkians prefer a little something we like to call--}
<ACTION>__{WHOOSH, WHOOSH, WHOOSH! A wash of VIBRANT COLORS blurs by. DRAGONS BARREL PAST at a dizzying speed. Their RIDERS SWIPE, KICK, and ROLL into one another while they WEAVE neck in neck between the houses, docks, and revamped structures of Berk.}
<CHAR>__{HICCUP } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{DRAGON RACING!}
<ACTION>__{It's like an aerial version of the Monte Carlo race. Spectators ROAR from wooden bleachers, fastened to cliff faces and perched over the sea. FISHLEGS, now 20 and even larger, rides his gronkle, MEATLUG, who carries the sheep in her claws, until... SNOTLOUT, also 20, but every bit as juvenile, and his Monstrous Nightmare, HOOKFANG, steal the sheep from them.}

<CHAR>__{TUFFNUT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Nope. Still hates you. Let's blow this place, Belch!}
<ACTION>__{Belch ignites the gas, sparking a flashy explosion, and leaving Snotlout behind in the smoke. As they rush past the main bleachers, Ruffnut DROPS her sheep into one of five baskets suspended over a chasm at the lap crossing. Each backboard bears an image of its corresponding dragon. The Barf/Belch basket filled to the brim with sheep. Presiding over the game, STOICK turns to the frenzied crowd.}

<DIAL>__{Dragons used to be a bit of a problem here. But that was five years ago. Now they've all moved in. And, really, why wouldn't they?}
<ACTION>__{The racers chase each other through a sprawling hangar and into a vast cave, teeming with colorfully painted dragon stables. They exit through the far side and circle back through the village, blasting past many of its dragon- friendly additions.}

<ACTION>__{Astrid rolls her eyes, peels away from the other dragon racers, and yanks open a spout on the overhead network of aqueducts, dousing the flames with a surge of water. BACK TO STOICK, amused as he watches the racers round the island, searching for sheep. He turns to Gobber and nods.}

<CHAR>__{STOICK} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's thirteen! Astrid takes the game!}
<ACTION>__{The crowd COMES UNHINGED. Astrid flies over the crowd, basking in her victory.}
<CHAR>__{HICCUP } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{Yep. Berk is pretty much perfect. All of my hard work has paid off. And it's a good thing, too, because with Vikings on the backs of dragons, the world just got a whole lot bigger.}
<LOC>__{EXT. OPEN SKY/ISLAND COASTLINE - DAY}
<ACTION>__{(Scene 0300 - AWOL Part One) A boundless sky. Vast. Clear. Crisp. And from it, a BLACK SPECK rockets across the horizon. The image of unbridled freedom. Tucked into his riding position, HICCUP appears to be part of TOOTHLESS. They dip, roll and dive, over a sea teeming with Thunderdrums, pulling off daring maneuvers with honed refinement, making them seem effortless.}
<CHAR>__{HICCUP} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah!}
<ACTION>__{They jackknife, heading skyward, rolling and tumbling through the ethereal cloud-scapes and joining high-flying Timberjacks as they soar in formation. Hiccup is bound head-to-toe in a snug, aerodynamic flight suit -- an asymmetrical, functional design of leather and articulated plates. It has an air of Viking bike leather.}
<CHAR>__{HICCUP } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{What do you think, bud? Wanna give this another shot?}
<ACTION>__{Toothless grumbles in protest.}
<CHAR>__{HICCUP } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Toothless! It'll be fine.}
<ACTION>__{With a click of a lever, he LOCKS the pedals in the flared tail position. Hiccup then unhooks himself from the saddle.}
<CHAR>__{HICCUP } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Ready?}
<ACTION>__{Toothless SNORTS unenthusiastically. Suddenly, Hiccup SLIDES OFF of Toothless, peeling away from him like a skydiver from a plane, YELLING as he plummets. Toothless dives after him. They spiral through the air, face- to-face. Toothless is having fun, despite himself. Hiccup slips his forearms through a pair of tucked leather flaps... and YANKS, unfurling SHEETS OF LEATHER as he extends his arms. They catch the wind, SNAPPING OPEN like WINGS... and sending him GLIDING -- out of control, at first, then stabilizing. The turbulence buffets his flight suit heavily. But he's flying! Toothless unfolds his wings, too, catching up with Hiccup. The freedom is palpable. Hiccup and Toothless are, for the moment, the same. Feeling the same rush of adrenaline. Independently together. They PLUNGE past cloud formations, splitting apart then crossing paths again. Impressive as it is, Hiccup is gliding at a steep angle. Toothless launches fireballs ahead of Hiccup, boosting him higher with the expanding heat bursts.}

<DIAL>__{No longer amazing! Toothless!}
<ACTION>__{Hiccup tries to steer himself away, to no avail. Toothless POURS ON THE SPEED, trying to catch Hiccup as he HURTLES toward collision. His locked tail makes maneuvering difficult. He's UNABLE TO PULL UP at a steep enough angle.}
<CHAR>__{HICCUP } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Oh, no!}
<ACTION>__{At the last second, Toothless BLASTS the jagged rocks just ahead of Hiccup, then WRAPS Hiccup in his wings as they fly through it. The obliterated peak rains down around them. Toothless emerges through the cloud of debris and HURTLES into the trees of a neighboring peak. They tumble down the uneven terrain, coming to rest on a small plateau. Hiccup emerges from the cocoon of Toothless' wings. He switches his prosthetic riding foot to his walking foot and stows his leather wings.}
<CHAR>__{HICCUP } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{That really came out of nowhere.}
<ACTION>__{The blown up sea stack collapses.}
<CHAR>__{HICCUP } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{We gotta work on your solo gliding there, bud. That locked-up tail makes for some pretty sloppy rescue maneuvers, eh?}
<ACTION>__{Hiccup reels in his dorsal fin and removes his helmet, revealing a 20 year old Hiccup framed by wild hair, complete with a Viking braid. He walks to the edge of the cliff, taking in the NEW LAND stretching off into the horizon, its tall cliffs and sea- stacks adorned with swaying gold birch trees basking in the dappled afternoon sunlight.}
<CHAR>__{HICCUP } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Looks like we found another one, bud.}
<ACTION>__{Toothless FUSSES and SNORTS, not amused, shaking off dust and pebbles like a wet dog. Hiccup flinches as a pebble WHACKS him on the back of the head. He looks back to Toothless, who averts his eyes.}

<DIAL>__{You're right! You're right! You win! You win!}

<DIAL>__{He's down! And it's ugly! Dragons and Vikings, enemies again, locked in combat to the bitter -- URFFF!}

<DIAL>__{You KNOW that doesn't wash out.}
<ACTION>__{Toothless LAUGHS, pleased with himself. Shifting his attention back to the new land stretched out before them, Hiccup reaches beneath his chest plate and produces a leather-bound book. He unfurls it to reveal an EXPLORERS MAP, modified with added strips in every direction to accommodate their ever-expanding world. Drawings indicate new lands, new tribes, and many new dragons. Hiccup peels a fresh strip of paper from a hidden fold in his flight suit and holds it out for Toothless to lick. Hiccup affixes the moistened strip to the map's outer edge, then whittles a pencil and consults a compass affixed to his forearm.}

<DIAL>__{Never! Come on!}
<ACTION>__{He hammers the Bewilderbeast, spurring it into a charge. Toothless calls over his shoulder, commanding the dragons to ready themselves. He then BLASTS the Bewilderbeast, mid- charge. Suddenly, Skullcrusher fires. Followed by another, and another. Hiccup looks around, amazed to see the flock of dragons opening fire on Drago and his Bewilderbeast. They've started a rebellion. Drago is forced to hide from the fiery barrage by taking cover in the tall spines of the giant's crown.}

<DIAL>__{FIGHT! BLAST THEM!}
<ACTION>__{His prosthetic arm is blasted clean off by one of his own armored dragons. The Bewilderbeast rears back to cover them all in ice, but Toothless lets loose a powerful shot. The Bewilderbeast's head is KNOCKED backward by a blue-flame fireball. As the smoke clears, one of its massive TUSKS FALLS to the ground, sheared clean off. Drago glares at Toothless. Toothless ROARS commandingly, calling an end to the fight.}

<DIAL>__{The alpha protects them all.}

As the smoke clears, Hiccup and Toothless see nothing but bubbles on the waves to mark their disappearance. No sign of the Bewilderbeast... or Drago. Toothless hops down from the spire, cooling off, as people celebrate all around them. All of the dragons -- Berk's, Valka's, even Drago's -- land around Toothless. Cloudjumper bows to Toothless, starting a wave of bows, acknowledging their new alpha. Toothless looks around, surprised, then lets out a majestic ROAR. The assembled dragons join in, roaring in tribute. Toothless turns to Hiccup as he approaches.}

Hiccup then turns his attention to a massive statue of Stoick, presently under construction. He grins with pride.}
