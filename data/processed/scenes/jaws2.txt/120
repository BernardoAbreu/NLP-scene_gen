<A>__{looking up at pontoons, wreckage, wind turbulence on the surface, the heavy "thud thud thud" of chopper blades.}
<B>__{wide on the raft and chopper}
<A>__{in the f.g., the fin rises, and starts for the scene. follow it.}
<B>__{close on the chopper}

<A>__{kids screaming.}
<B>__{quick cuts}
<A>__{ rotor blade spinning wildly. pilot's hands jerked on the delicate controls. med. shot, copter shaking. closeup engine and gas tanks, rotor head spinning. med. closeup pilot in buffeting cockpit.}
<B>__{raft and copter}
<A>__{the kids watch, horror stricken, as the giant shark hangs on the roaring copter; in the b.g., cable junction is looming closer. the copter tilts dangerously, the shark bites deeper, harder.}
<B>__{angle on the copter}
<A>__{as it tilts. then, the unspeakable the blades touch the water and explode. chunks of murderous steel break off the shattered blades and whistle through the air like projectiles.}
<B>__{the kids}
<A>__{reacting, ducking in terror. huge chunks of disintegrating rotors are flying all around. masts and sails left standing before are chopped into a deadly salad. screams.}
<B>__{low in the water}
<A>__{as blades skip and crash, the bubble of the overturned copter, pilot trapped inside, sinks into the sea. the copter cockpit underwater pilot struggling with his safety harness, trying to hit switches, working on instinct. some air in the bubble, but water too, and sparks as electrical connections short out and burn. then, the shark, powering out of the murk. angle on the pilot underwater as grim death batters at his fragile bubble. screaming. the bubble cracks. water floods, teeth snap at the slippery plastic, the pilot fumbles for oxygen as the shark veers off into the murk. on the surface the raft the kids, reacting as the broken copter sinks beneath the waves. calm for a moment, then:}

<A>__{the shark reappears, and batters at the raft.}
<B>__{shark attack}
<A>__{the raft shudders, and begins to break up under the pounding. the kids cling for their lives to masts and wreckage. marge's overturned hull is struck a fierce blow from beneath.}

<C>__{andy}
<D>__{don't struggle!}
<A>__{sean is bobbing in his life vest, marge strokes to be near him.}
<B>__{angle on marge and sean}
<A>__{in the water, swimming for the apparent safety of the raft. then, the fin, and the massive bulk of the killer, heaving up through the waves.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{sean!}
<A>__{she heaves him up out of the water, hurling him with desperation towards the safety of the floating hull.}
<B>__{angle on sean}
<A>__{screaming, hands and feet scrabbling like a monkey as he struggles for a grip on the slippery surface. behind him, marge helping as much as she can from the water. then, behind her;}
<B>__{the shark}
<A>__{rising like grey doom, then dropping out of sight. marge is gone.}
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{marge ducking under the bulk of the shark, shoving off with panicky reserves of strength, swimming away underwater, while the shark takes a massive crunching bite out of a submerged hull. follow marge as she swims.}
<B>__{copter wreckage}
<A>__{huddled in the cracked plastic bubble, the pilot is sucking air from his oxygen tank. he sees marge, and slips out of his bubble, headed for her.}
<B>__{marge}
<A>__{as the pilot overtakes her a moment of horror, as she thinks the shark has found her, then relief, as the pilot motions to the bubble, and indicates "air." she follows him.}
<B>__{marge and the pilot}
<A>__{scuttling like two crabs into the shelter of the broken chopper, buddy breathing as he passes her the oxygen tube. the chopper tilts, and moves, breaking up on the bottom as currents move it. they struggle silently.}
<B>__{angle on the chopper}
<A>__{as it slips across the bottom, the current pulling it, broken parts breaking off in slow motion, dirty swirls of oil and hydraulic fluid clouding the water.}
