<A>__{glenn looks at maurice, now ice cold behind the shades.}
<C>__{white boy bob}
<D>__{we're here.}
<A>__{glenn looks out the window as they pull up in front of a decrepit looking two story house. maurice opens the gym bag, passes the hack saw and a hand axe up to white boy bob, a sawed off shotgun to kenneth, and takes out a big .45 for himself.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{let's go see eddie.}
<A>__{glenn hesitates, then slowly gets out of the car as we hear...}
<C>__{ripley }
