<B>__{from clean room cams.}
<A>__{the clean room cams are incredibly hi def, crisp and clear, with all manner of data and time codes scrolling all over the top and bottom of the screens. matt lays on the floor of a perfectly white room. at the far end is a blackened out two way mirror. there's a camera on the inside of this too, and we can see resolute men in suits reflected on the inner glass, watching with unreadable expressions. there is a chair and a table, but he's clearly fallen out of the chair. it's maybe an hour after the scene in front of the michael graves building, and he's received no medical attention. to this end, matt is suffering from, among other things, massive blood loss, multiple broken bones, dozens of gashes and cuts, presumed internal bleeding, and a broken back. he can barely move, sliding around on the floor in his own blood as he dies, watched by the compassionless eyes of the cameras. he is barely coherent, screeching in agony.}

<D>__{please...help me. help me, help me, please...i'm sorry! i'm so sorry, i tried help me, help me, i'm dying, i'm dying. stars i see stars, somebody it hurts, please. i'm the blood...i tried...}
<A>__{two men in contamination suits enter the room, wielding some kind of radiation sensors. they go over to matt, scanning him.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{listen, help me, help me. i'm dying, you have to help me, don't just let me please i'm sorry! i'm sorry! help me! i }
<A>__{the men ignore him as matt makes some gasping sounds, his eyes going wide.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{i can...i can hear the singing.}
<A>__{matt entirely stops moving. he lays there, not breathing, completely still. and then suddenly the two men are flung backwards, as is the table and the chair. there are a series of grotesque popping and snapping sounds from matt's body, and he jerks, and writhes, pushing himself up onto his hands and knees. the security cams track and zoom, and as matt stands, we realize a startling truth: his cuts are closing themselves. his broken bones have already molded back into place. his bruises are shrinking away to nothing. the blacked out glass suddenly shatters, and falls out of its frame, revealing a shocked, frightened room of high ranking military personnel, along with several men in civilian clothes. matt stares at them. they stare back at him.}
<D>__{4 star general}
<P>__{(terrified)}
<D>__{listen...son, you don't i mean...}
<A>__{matt raises a finger to his lips, and the general trails off. matt smile weakly for a moment, then stops.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{would you please...turn off the fucking cameras.}
