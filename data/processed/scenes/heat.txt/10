<A>__{michael cerrito at 40 is looking at a doll house. he's a wide, thick, coarse featured big man. sicilian from sunnyside, he's spent 15 years in attica, joliet and marion penitentiaries. he's strictly a "cowboy": his natural inclination towards a score is "...get the guns and let's go." he's been off smack and everything else for five years. he's clean and sober. he's the nicest guy on the block and a loving father. if you get in his way, he'll kill you as soon as look at you. if you asked him about the contradictions, he wouldn't know what you were talking about.}
