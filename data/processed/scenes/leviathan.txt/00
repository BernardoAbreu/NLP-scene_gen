<D>__{screenplay by david webb peoples and jeb stuart revised draft september 8, 1987}
<B>__{face in on the surface of the ocean}
<A>__{sunny and placid then slowly we begin descending underwater moving down from the bright surface waters, through layers of fish and marine life... a school of vibrantly colored fish move with the current, their numbers are enormous, their movements in unison. suddenly out of the darkness a barracuda cuts through the school, taking out four or five before disappearing into the shadows. the school moves on as if nothing happened, quickly closing ranks where the missing ones swam only seconds before.}
<B>__{we move deeper and deeper}
<A>__{fish disappear, darkness envelopes us. cold and lifeless where light has never penetrated...five thousand feet, ten thousand. deeper, where only strange, self illuminating echoniderms move eerily through the currents. then suddenly we hear static from radio transmission. then voices...}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{burritos...enchiladas...}
<C>__{dejesus}
<P>__{(hispanic voice)}
<D>__{oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...}
<C>__{bowman}
<P>__{(female)}
<D>__{i can't wait for fresh vegetables...}
<A>__{several voices suddenly break into argument..."vegetables?" "shit," "burgers"...suddenly another voice rises above the others.}
<D>__{beck's voice radio okay, cut the chatter. you're not out of here, yet. who's the hook? seven?...you got a hook on container 22?}
<A>__{a pause, then more voices.}
<D>__{sixpack's voice radio}
<P>__{(redneck drawl)}
<D>__{the man's asking if you're hooked on 22, you dumb shit. jones' voice radio watch your mouth, sixpack. hello, shack, seven, here. i ain't the hook, over.}
<A>__{a light flares out of the darkness, suddenly illuminating an immense shape fifteen hundred pounds of hardened metal nearly seven feet tall. it is a motorized diving suit and we see the stenciled name, willie across the front breastplate. as it pivots we see the stationary worklights around the base of a large underwater mining operation, the shack. then a woman's voice.}
<C>__{willie's voice}
<P>__{(woman's voice)}
<D>__{six to shack. i'm the hook.}
<A>__{inside the shack control room littered with papers, half full coffee cups, and a confusion of wires and very low tech, high tech equipment beck sits at the monitor controls. he is younger than we expected, twenties, clean cut good looks. he'll be a hell of a good looking man at thirty five, he just needs to be hardened. from the looks of the coffee cups around him he's on his way.}
<D>__{beck's voice radio okay, six, let's wrap this container and call it a day.}
<A>__{above him a bank of monitor screens. each one labeled with a crew member's name and providing a video picture from a camera mounted on their helmet. beck reaches above him and throws a console switch which activates another monitor labeled rov. with a joystick he manipulates an outside camera(the rov), its picture we see on the monitor. it is moving.}
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{willie's pov the inside of her helmet is a grid of led gauges monitoring air reserve, body temperature, atmospheres, heart rate, blood pressure. she stops next to a pair of railroad like tracks and removes the tool attached to the end of her arm. the move is practiced and professional, like a cook changing the tool on a set of egg beaters. first, she inserts the existing tool into a lock on her opposite arm which holds it while she disengages the tool. next, she selects the next tool from the storage compartment at her waist and punches it into position. sixpack's voice comes over the radio.}
<C>__{sixpack's voice}
<D>__{hey, willie, you trip on a tit or something? we're all waiting on you, honey.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(under control)}
<D>__{keep your pants on sixpack. i promise you'll be inside before "mr. rogers' neighborhood" comes on.}
<A>__{over the radio we hear other men's voices laughing. they like willie and cheer her on. "tell him, willie," "atta girl," etc... willie clicks in her last tool and turns. expertly she hooks a large dumpster like container, the container to what looks like an underwater parachute a container transporter which when filled with oxygen it lifts the massive container onto the tracks where it can be hauled in by a winch.}
<C>__{willie's voice}
<D>__{six to shack...hook's on. ready to winch.}
<B>__{underwater machinery}
<A>__{halogen lights illuminate bits and pieces of dredges and dumpsters squatting in the gloom. a winch begins grinding and the big, newly hooked container lurches down the tracks. it comes to the end where a winch fits it into place with several others to complete a set. we hear beck's voice.}
<D>__{beck radio ok, that's it. come on in.}
<A>__{more motor suited divers appear, their helmet lights glaring. their breastplate names catch in the dim lights: cobs, bowman, willie. as they approach the underwater lock, where an elevator will transport them up into the shack, we see signs of human life: a basketball goal attached to the side of the building; stickers and signs: "no bozos," etc. a formal sign towers over the entrance. it says: transocean corp. shack 6.}
<B>__{on one of the crew}
<A>__{he moves behind the others. suddenly he freezes in his tracks and slowly rotates his helmet on his shoulder in the glare of his helmet beam we see the a hideous looking sea spider. it's thick legs moving eerily down his arm. carefully, so as not to disturb the creature, a mechanical motor hand moves into position below it, and in one quick movement, snares it. close on metal waist pocket. the latch opens and the writhing sea spider is shoved inside. from the pocket we move up the diver's suit until we see the name sixpack on the breastplate. he looks around to see if anyone has noticed then continues on toward the shack. on two divers(jones and dejesus) they walk together to the shack. a latino voice, dejesus, comes over the radio singing an old miller beer jingle in an exaggerated accent.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{when it's time to relax.... one thing stands clear...}
<B>__{inside on beck}
<A>__{as he listens to the singing over the tinny speaker, we see he aches to be a part of their comaraderie, but is alienated by age and rank. he is the shack boss, management. he listens as a booming black voice joins in off key.}
<C>__{jones' voice}
<D>__{mil ler's tastes too good to hurry through...}
<A>__{as the singing continues, beck looks over at an empty chair in front of a bank of equipment monitors. the vital signs of each miner and his equipment are registered on this console. the chair in front of them sits conspicuously empty. this doesn't please beck, neither does a hand written sign under the console which states: the doctor is out . dejesus' pov inside his helmet we see the grid of led gauges monitoring vital signs.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{...beer after beer...}
<A>__{suddenly a red warning light begins blinking in the bottom corner inside dejesus' helmet. the words to the song freeze in his mouth. his voice becomes edged with panic.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{oh, shit... jones radio}
<P>__{(to dejesus)}
<D>__{hey, hazy, i'm not that bad, man.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<P>__{(rising terror)}
<D>__{jonesy! i'm losing compression... i'm going to blow my suit, man! beck! doc! help me!...}
<B>__{inside}
<A>__{beck grabs his microphone. he tries to remain calm but there is a definite tremble in his voice.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{give me a readout, dejesus.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<P>__{(gripped with panic)}
<D>__{ahhhh!}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{the other divers move quickly to dejesus.}
<C>__{beck }
<D>__{dejesus! a readout!}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{he don't need a readout, man, he needs help!}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(anything but calm)}
<D>__{stay calm!}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{calm!? where's doc?}
<B>__{inside}
<A>__{beck stands in front of the equipment monitors, lost.}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(trying to keep control)}
<D>__{the internal monitors read normal.}
<A>__{on the miners, panicked}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{where's doc?!}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{he's not at his station.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<P>__{(panicked)}
<D>__{oh, mother of jesus, forgive me of my }
<C>__{beck's voice}
<P>__{(making a decision)}
<D>__{get him into the shack.}
<A>__{dejesus' gauges begins a countdown to implosion. "15, 14,}
