<L>__{interior windsor castle, dining hall night}
<A>__{it's a few days later and bertie is entertaining a private dinner party. they include queen victoria, princess alexandra, princess louise and henry ponsonby. brown is in attendance. he stands off to one side, near the door.}
<C>__{bertie}
<P>__{(bristling with confidence)}
<D>__{... all seven stone of the man, paddling madly towards us through a sea of horse guards, waving something that looks vaguely like a pen. i thought he must be one of the mother's ardent readership in search of the royal indenture...}
<A>__{more chortling. victoria watches her son, smiling proudly. brown looks straight ahead.}
<C>__{bertie }
<D>__{i believe i saw him first and then alerted brown. i'm not convinced that he wasn't taking a snooze on top of the box. anyway, we had our man pinned down and i must say, brown acquitted himself admirably. of course the gun was a fake, but all the same, it was well done.}
<A>__{no one registers brown. but while victoria does not look at him, she is acutely aware of his presence.}
<C>__{victoria}
<D>__{i intend brown to be rewarded with a special medal cast in gold. it will be called the devoted service medal.}
<A>__{the guests applaud politely. bertie clinks his glass for attention and raises it high.}
<C>__{bertie}
<D>__{a toast. victoria regina!}
<A>__{the others raise their glasses in unison.}
<C>__{everyone}
<D>__{victoria regina!}
<A>__{victoria smiles. brown remains alone by the door.}
<C>__{disraeli }
<D>__{the people of england have expressed in a manner which cannot be mistaken, that they will uphold the ancient monarchy of england ...}
