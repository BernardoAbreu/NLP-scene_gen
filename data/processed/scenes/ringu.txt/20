<A>__{asakawas car is already halted before a modest sized, two story house with a small covered parkway for a garage. she gets out of her car, closes the door. she stares at the house, unmoving.}
<L>__{interior ouishi household kitchen day}
<A>__{asakawa stands before her sister ryomi, who is seated at the kitchen table. ryomi is staring blankly away, making no sign of acknowledging her sister. the silence continues unabated, and asakawa, pensive, wanders idly into the adjoining dining room. she takes a long look at the television, the same television that had puzzled tomoko by suddenly switching itself on, sitting darkly in one corner. her reflection in the screen looks stretched, distorted.}
<C>__{ryomi }
<D>__{they tell me that yoichi came to the funeral, too.}
<A>__{asakawa steps back into the kitchen. she addresses her sister, who continues to stare out at nothing.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{mmm hmm.}
<C>__{ryomi}
<D>__{they used to play a lot together, didnt they? upstairs.}
<C>__{asakawa}
<D>__{yeah...}
<A>__{ryomi lapses back into a silence. asakawa waits for her to say more, but when it is clear that nothing else is forthcoming, she quietly gives up and exits the kitchen.}
