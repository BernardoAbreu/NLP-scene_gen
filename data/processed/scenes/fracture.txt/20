<L>__{interior crawford house continuous}
<A>__{crawford watches nunally's silhouette appear on the frosted glass, from across the living room.}
<C>__{nunally }
<D>__{mr. crawford?}
<A>__{the door pushes open very slowly. nunally stays in the doorway.}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{crawford studies him, staying back.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{get rid of the vampires.}
<A>__{nunally is confused; crawford gestures at the flood lit lawn outside. nunally glances back, sees the swat teams and down the street the distant barricades, the media. he nods, steps in and lets the door shut. careful silence.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{do i call you rob?}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{if you want.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{not vampires.}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{not vampires. ghouls. sorry.}
<A>__{nunally nods, humoring him, glancing around. sees the small pool of blood where jennifer fell. plays it cool.}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{mr. crawford, what do you say you give me the gun so i can pay more attention to what you're saying?}
<A>__{crawford sighs.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{is that your best shot?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so to speak.}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{i just think maybe it would }
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{tell you what: i will if you will.}
<A>__{nunally frowns, wary. crawford moves to the coffee table in the center of the room, holds his gun out over it.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{we both put down our guns. at the same time.}
<A>__{crawford gestures to a chair across the room by the foyer door, near nunally.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{we set them down and step away.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{then you can "pay more attention" to what i'm saying.}
<A>__{nunally studies crawford...and the gun, hovering above the coffee table. looking for a trick, a catch. but there isn't one. if crawford sets down his gun and steps away, he'll be standing in the open center of the room.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{happy ending, then.}
<A>__{nunally stares crawford in the eyes then slowly takes his gun from his shoulder holster. eyes on each other from across the room moving very slowly the two men cautiously set down their guns and step away. crawford smiles. nunally smiles, too, reassuring and false. begins to edge forward alert to the possibility of a lunge for the gun or having another weapon. but crawford stays absolutely still.}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{mr. crawford, your neighbor mentioned that your wife }
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{it's tom.}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{i'm sorry?}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{you can call me tom.}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{tom. your wife. is she here?}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{crawford gestures to a library alcove, behind him, out of view.}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{is she all right?}
<A>__{nunally begins to drift slowly to the side, to see.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{i don't think she is. i shot her, rob.}
<A>__{nunally's nodding, edging to look into the alcove }
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{you shot your wife.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{it was like i just suddenly snapped. we were arguing and i got the gun.}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{ okay i hear you }
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{and i shot her in the head. i know it was wrong.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{are you listening to me?}
<A>__{but nunally is not. he's frozen staring, shocked, at the back wall of the alcove which he can now see. there's a big framed black white photograph: a portrait of jennifer crawford.}
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{oh jesus christ.}
<A>__{nunally fumbles for his walkie talkie, rushing past crawford toward the alcove kneeling by jennifer, who lies, face up in a red puddle }
<C>__{nunally}
<P>__{(into walkie talkie)}
<D>__{we need a medic in here! get the ambulance up! right now! now! now!}
<A>__{nunally feels her neck frantically for a pulse looking in her open, vacant eyes for some sign }
<C>__{nunally}
<D>__{oh no god no i can't get a }
<A>__{nunally desperately starts c.p.r., his hands getting bloody. he stops to check her neck for a pulse now and then as crawford slowly approaches from the living room, standing behind nunally. cold.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{you know, i think i read somewhere that a good place to find a pulse is the femoral artery. it's on the inner surface of the upper thigh. if you put your fingers you know, right up inside her dress }
<A>__{nunally turns and lunges up, smashing a fist into crawford's face. crawford reels backward with nunally the two of them falling with nunally on top, beating crawford furiously, cursing as swat cops burst in, grabbing nunally, dragging him back knocking into paramedics trying to get to jennifer nunally kicking, flailing, spitting at crawford who's put face down on the floor, to get cuffed. nunally pulls free from the swat cops, distraught, angry going to retrieve his gun and shove it in his shoulder holster, struggling to regain control.}
<C>__{paramedic}
<D>__{wait a second she's not dead!}
<A>__{nunally whirls everyone freezing, breathless, falling silent. the paramedics kneeling around jennifer work as crawford lies on the floor, staring at his wife. like she's a machine that defied astronomical odds and refused to behave according to his calculations.}
