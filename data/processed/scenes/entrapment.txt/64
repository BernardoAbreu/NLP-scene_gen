<L>__{interior noodle shop, taipei day}
<A>__{gin and mac at a long communal table, ignored, by taiwanese couples, families, businessmen, chattering loudly all around them. gin looking down at her bowl, she's barely touched her meal...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{...no, i don't think that way.}
<A>__{glances up. mac is eating heartily, happily.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{...and i suppose you do?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{get lonely? sure, all the time. it's healthy.}
<A>__{stuffs his mouth full. talking around it...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{what's unhealthy. is denial.}
<A>__{she's studying him as he eats. since he's not looking at her, gin's eyes are thoughtful, appraising.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{be real. you could never see yourself...you know, quitting the game. settling...down.}
<A>__{and he looks up. direct to her eyes. a dead straight, heart stopping look. before the wonderful smile.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{why, ginger. this is so sudden.}
<A>__{she cuts him a hard look. not funny.}
