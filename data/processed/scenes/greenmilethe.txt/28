<L>__{exterior country road field day (flashback)}
<A>__{ and we see cars and trucks pulling up, men jumping out with rifles, pouring down the incline toward the field where klaus is hollering and waving his arms. deputy mcgee comes sliding down from the road, taking charge at the top of his lungs }
<D>__{mcgee i want all the weapons unloaded, y'hear? take out your shells, i won't have a man shot by accident today! bobo, where them dogs?}
<A>__{ and the dogs come bounding out of the back of a truck, howling down the incline to lead the chase...}
<B>__{various angles}
<A>__{...which takes us through the cattails and bulrushes...to the spot where klaus finds the little scrap of pale yellow fabric, turns and screams...}
<C>__{klaus}
<D>__{oh, lord, this belongs to my katie...}
<A>__{...and they keep going, stopping abruptly as they find: a blood drenched area of tramped grass. a little girl's bloody nightgown hangs in the low branches of a tree. some of these strong men look like they might throw up or faint at the sight of it. their blood freezes in their veins as an inhuman howling commences up ahead. it's like nothing they've ever heard before, raising the hackles of men and dogs alike.}
<B>__{paul on bleachers}
<A>__{...as paul quietly turns another page, shaking his head...}
