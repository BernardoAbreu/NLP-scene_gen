<A>__{ashley sits at the kitchen table, looking at a picture of rudy and jacob when they were infants. her eyes are filled, but she's not crying. jacob enters and crosses to the fridge. he spots ashley and is taken aback by her state.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(cold)}
<D>__{what's wrong now?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i was looking at a picture of you and rudy when you were born. god, i miss him.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{but you have keith now}
<A>__{ashley is struck by jacob's comment.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{what the hell does that mean?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you have keith. two boys again. everything is fine.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{we didn't adopt keith to replace rudy.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{didn't you?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{for your information, your father and i discussed adopting for years.}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(not buying it)}
<D>__{right. maybe if it was me who died, you wouldn't need another kid to get over it.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{how can you say that? i never wanted either of my children to die.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{but one of us did. if you had to choose which one, i bet you wish it was me.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i know you think we favored rudy...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you did! admit it.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i admit he was easier to raise, but we didn't love him more. jacob, listen to me. you came with a different set of challenges.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{my birthmark.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{it's not easy being different...}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(screams)}
<D>__{i'm not different!! you always made me feel like something was wrong. there's nothing wrong with me.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i know...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no, you don't! it's like you don't know how to deal with me. you never did.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i'm sorry if that is how you feel. you do the best you can as a parent. you don't always know what's right. but you're my son. i'd do anything for you. i'd fight for you, i'd kill for you, i'd die for you.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{rudy used to say that exact same thing.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{it's true. and as unchristian as it sounds, i still want the boy that killed rudy dead. someday, when you grow up, you'll understand what i mean. someday.}
