<A>__{howls in terror, makes a break for cover. a ray instantly zaps down at him and he explodes into fiery fragments.}

<A>__{a small shuttle craft descends vertically to a soft landing. klytus gets out. every sound ceases. he nods at barin, at zarkov. looks around. frowns. he walks directly across flash's shadow, to zarkov.}
