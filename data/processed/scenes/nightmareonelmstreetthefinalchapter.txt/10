<L>__{exterior rosedale day}
<A>__{a sprawling little community with pleasant streets and cheerful houses. it looks a lot like springwood, the only real difference being that it actually exists. it also has a sign: welcome to rosedale. population: 8,786 a volkswagon bus drives past the sign and stops a couple of blocks down the road from us. jacob steps out of the passenger side and wearily waves his ride goodbye. he shuffles into town.}
<B>__{close on yet another sign}
<A>__{it reads: drug addicts not welcome to rosedale! the sign pulls away to reveal a middle aged man with an angry expression: mr. hopkins}
<C>__{mr. hopkins}
<D>__{clean up your act somewhere else!}
<A>__{he walks along as we pull back to see}
