<A>__{she hurries into the living room, where she comes upon michael and kay.}
<C>__{kay}
<P>__{(comforting)}
<D>__{connie...}
<A>__{but connie avoids her, and moves directly to michael. neri is watchful.}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{you lousy bastard; you killed my husband...}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{connie...}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{you waited until our father died and nobody could stop you and you killed him, you killed him! you blamed him about sonny, you always did, everybody did. but you never thought about me, never gave a damn about me.}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{what am i going to do now, what am i going to do.}
<A>__{two of michael's bodyguards move closer, ready for orders from him. but he stands there, waiting for his sister to finish.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{connie, how could you say such things?}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{why do you think he kept carlo on the mall? all the time he knew he was going to kill my husband. but he didn't dare while my father was alive. and then he stood godfather to our child. that coldhearted bastard.}
<P>__{(to kay)}
<D>__{and do you know how many men he had killed with carlo? just read the papers. that's your husband.}

<C>__{michael}
<D>__{get her home and get a doctor.}
<A>__{the two bodyguards immediately take her arms and move her, gently but firmly. kay is shocked; never taking her look of amazement from michael. he feels her look.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{she's hysterical.}
<A>__{but kay won't let him avoid her eyes.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{michael, it's not true. please tell me.}

<C>__{michael}
<D>__{all right, this one time i will let you ask about my affairs, one last time.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{is it true?}
<A>__{she looks directly into his eyes, he returns the look, so directly that we know he will tell the truth.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(after a very long pause)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{kay is relieved; she throws her arms around him, and hugs him. then she kisses him.}
<C>__{kay}
<P>__{(through her tears)}
<D>__{we both need a drink.}
