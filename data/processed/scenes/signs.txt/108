<A>__{the passenger side window of the truck is open. graham steps up to it and looks inside. the thin man with the leather jacket, we saw in town, sits behind the wheel. he stares out the windshield. he is covered in sweat.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{hello ray.}
<A>__{ray reddy doesn't look over. doesn't react. keeps staring. ray clutches the steering wheel tightly, turning his knuckles a yellow white. graham glances to the backseat of the truck. there are two large bags over flowing with clothes. graham's eyes gently move back to ray and drift down to the two blood stained area on his shirt. beat.}

<A>__{tears start falling down ray's face.}

<D>__{i worked so long that night. i ain't never fallen asleep driving before. and never since. most of the ride home, there wasn't a car insight in either direction. if i'd fallen asleep then, i'd a ended up in a ditch with a head ache. it had to happen at that right moment. that certain ten fifteen seconds when i passed her walking. it was like it was meant to be.}
