<L>__{exterior sidewalk, near the cook house day}
<A>__{mumford and sofie, foreground, walk slowly up the block. in the background, mrs. cook watches for awhile before going inside.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{mom's such a cutie.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{people usually have to get to know me before they hate me.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{she's not in a bad mood. she's like that all the time.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{it doesn't bother me anymore. it's my dad and my brother i worry about.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging.}
<C>__{sofie}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{is that the technical description of what i've got?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{is she against you getting help?}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{we don't discuss it.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{something's bothering her.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{oh, we've all disappointed her. me, especially, but dad, of course. she thinks my brother's all right, but she didn't expect much. it's what happens when you "marry beneath yourself"...}
<A>__{sofie suddenly seems to be fading.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{please... forgive me.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{negative thinking makes everything more difficult. if you're going to have enough strength to do this, we have to talk only about positive things. all right?}
<A>__{she looks at him, unsure if he's serious. it seems so corny. but she agrees.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{okay then... are you positive your mother's a bitch?}
<P>__{(she laughs, surprised)}
<D>__{just kidding.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{you've got a funny idea of funny.}
<C>__{mumford}
<P>__{(seems worried)}
<D>__{i've offended you!}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{really? what would it take?}
<A>__{she laughs again; surprised again. he's got her off balance makes a "rim shot" sound.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{is this the treatment?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{sorry... i'm done.}
<C>__{sofie}
<D>__{'cause i will tell you, none of the others have tried this approach.}
<A>__{they've come to the corner. he gestures to ask "shall we cross?" she considers for quite a while, gauging her strength, then, still on his arm, steps off the curb }
<C>__{sofie}
<P>__{(absurdly unconvincing)}
<D>__{hey, 'just do it!'}
<A>__{they cross out of frame as we hear:}
<C>__{mumford }
<D>__{i want you to tell me all your symptoms.}
