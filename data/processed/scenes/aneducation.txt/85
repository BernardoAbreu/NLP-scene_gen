<D>__{i'm surprised that you two are standing in front of me. i'm not surprised to find you here, miss mellor, though i do feel rather like the judge who sent al capone to prison for tax evasion. we take a very dim view of smoking. we take an even dimmer view of some of your other behaviour, which as far as we know has taken place off school premises. your appearance here today, however, allows me to remind you that we are trying to teach you how to become young ladies, not nightclub hostesses. in reality, of course, you are neither. you are merely silly little girls. detention after school. go away. jenny's face sets hard. something in her shuts down.}
