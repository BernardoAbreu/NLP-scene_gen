<A>__{the doors bangs open and terminator strides in. the mexican cook does a fast fade as terminator walks toward cigar, who is cursing in pain on the floor. with his deep fried fingers he struggles to get out the .45 auto tucked under his leather jacket. but he can't even hold onto it. terminator takes it from him. instead of pointing it at him, terminator carefully examines weapon, analyzing its caliber and operating condition. terminator never threatens... that's a human thing. he just takes. cigar senses what he must do when the emotionless eyes come back to him. he slides the keys to his bike across the floor to terminator's foot. then painfully starts getting out of his jacket.}
