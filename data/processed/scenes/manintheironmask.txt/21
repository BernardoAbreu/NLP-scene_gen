<L>__{interior athos' apartment night}
<A>__{athos sits alone, playing a haunting melody on a violin. it is a sad tune, played with feeling; he stops as he hears a knock at his door, and opens it to }
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{d'artagnan!}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{athos, my friend!}
<A>__{they embrace with deep affection friends who have shared each other's darkest times.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{it's been too long.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{life is too long. except when we have our friends. look at you! you're still a boy! sit, sit! i will open a bottle of wine.}
<A>__{d'artagnan takes one of the wooden chairs, by the meager fire. the whole place is modest at best.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{thanks, but not for me.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{you can't drink with a friend you haven't seen in months?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i have ordered a drill of the royal guard for midnight, and must be clear headed for it.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{midnight! mon dieu! driving the youngsters hard, eh?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{they must stay sharp. there was an attempt on the king's life today.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{another? how many times have you saved his life in this year alone? three? four?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i heard your playing.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{i was feeling sorry for myself. raoul is getting married, he proposed today! i love that boy beyond all measure, i've spent everything i own to give him education and opportunity. now he has complete happiness, and i mope.}
<A>__{a cloud passes d'artagnan's face; he has something to tell athos.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{athos...}
<A>__{but whatever it is that d'artagnan wants to say is interrupted by the sound of someone climbing the stairs. as athos' face brightened with the arrival of d'artagnan, now it glows as he jumps up to welcome his son.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{that must be raoul! raoul! look, d'artagnan's come to visit...! what's wrong? you look awful!}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{michelle, she the king has invited her to come live in the palace.}
<A>__{athos is stunned; d'artagnan witnesses this with agony.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{but are you sure?}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{we were at her door. i was just taking the ring from my pocket, for the third time today, when a young musketeer brought the invitation for her to become a lady in waiting for the queen mother.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{michelle cannot possibly accept!}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{she cannot possibly refuse. her family is poor, they have even less money than we do. and along with the invitation, the king sent the diamond pendant, from the piglet.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{piglet ? what are you ?}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{never mind, papa, it doesn't matter now. she loved me once. i want to die remembering that.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{die? what...?}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{i have rejoined the army, and asked to resume my commission at the head of the troops of general fromberge.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{fromberge...?! at the front?! no.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{it is already done. i have just stopped at mother's grave, to say goodbye, before coming to tell you.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{raoul, no... you cannot do this. no matter how your heart is broken }
<A>__{but raoul stops him, with an embrace.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{goodbye, father. i am sorry.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{raoul }
<A>__{raoul breaks away, and runs from the room. athos, so joyful moments before, holds his head as if his brain might erupt.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{this cannot be. everyone knows the queen mother is a recluse, and the ladies in waiting are but mistresses for the king!}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{if the young woman truly loves raoul }
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{she's a woman, d'artagnan! from a poor family. you may still be young enough to believe love conquers everything, but i am old and hard and i've seen too much. even when kings are hunchbacks they have any woman they desire, because power seduces even more than love!}
<A>__{d'artagnan is silent, and even ashamed. athos realizes }
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{you knew this was happening. you knew and that's why you came.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i fear i know our king. i came to try to bring you hope.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{what hope is there? a wartime commission cannot be vacated except by the king, and what chance is there of that? fromberge is on the battle line, and raoul }
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i have dispatches a message to fromberge requesting that raoul be kept far from the fighting.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{raoul is everything to me.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{oh my friend.}
<A>__{athos grips d'artagnan in gratitude and desperate hope.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i will also speak with the king, for he is surely unaware of the problems his invitation to mademoiselle beaufort has caused.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{you trust his character more than anyone else does.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{raoul is hurrying to the front, so i must hurry too.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{save my son, d'artagnan.}
<A>__{they embrace once more, and d'artagnan leaves.}
