<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{i had to circle and hope things didn't get too rough to take you off.}
<A>__{ripley turns to him, stopping partway down the ramp. she puts her hand on his shoulder.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{you did okay, bishop.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{well, thanks, i }
<A>__{he notices a tiny innocuous drop of liquid splash onto the ramp next to his shoe. ssssss. acid. something bursts from his chest, spraying ripley with milklike android blood. it is the razor sharp scorpion tail of the alien queen. driven right through him from behind. bishop thrashes, seizing the protruding section of tail in his hands, as is slowly lifts him off the deck. above them the queen glowers from its place of concealment among the hydraulic mechanisms inside one landing leg bay. it blends perfectly with the machinery until it begins to emerge. seizing bishop in two great hands it rips him apart and flings him aside, shredded, like a doll. it descends slowly to the deck, the rotating lights glistening across its shiny black limbs, dripping acid and rage. still smoking where ripley half fried it. the queen is huge, powerful...and very pissed off. it descends slowly, its six limbs unfolding in inhuman geometries. ripley moves with nightmarish slowness herself, staring hypnotized...terrified to break and run. she lowers newt to the deck, never taking her eyes off the creature.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(to newt)}
<D>__{go!}
<A>__{newt runs for cover. the alien drops to the deck, pivoting toward the motion. ripley waves her arms, decoying.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{here!}
<A>__{without warning it moves like lightning, straight at her. ripley spins, sprinting, as the creature leaps for her. its feet slam, echoing, on the deck behind her. she clears a door. hits the switch. it whirrs closed. boom. the alien hits a moment later.}
