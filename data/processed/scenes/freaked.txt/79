<D>__{sorry. i'm not much for timing.}
<A>__{he takes his seat again.}
<C>__{rick}
<P>__{(to everyone)}
<D>__{tomorrow night, at the show, i will be turned into a homicidal monster and forced to kill you all. but we might have a chance if we act fast. and i'm prepared to be your new leader.}
<B>__{a thrilling chord.}
<C>__{nosey}
<P>__{(to sockhead)}
<D>__{i say we kill him.}
<A>__{sockhead nods.}
<C>__{rick}

<D>__{i still say we kill him.}
<A>__{sockhead nods again.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{if we can get into elijah's lab, maybe we can }
<C>__{worm}
<D>__{of course! design a super freak of our own and manipulate the genetic code to make him destroy elijah instead of us! brilliant!}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{oh. well }
<C>__{bearded lady}
<D>__{but how do we get to the lab?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{um, maybe }
<C>__{cowboy}
<D>__{right! the worm could dig a tunnel!}
<C>__{worm}
<D>__{by god, it's so crazy it might just work!}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{but you need noxon 24 to make the freaking sludge, and elijah told us himself he's run out of it.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{oh. oh yeah. well, see, what i was going to say was }
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{yes! exactly! if they've been using noxon 24 as a fertilizer here, the entire ecosystem must be soaked with it! all we need is a way to extract it from the vegetation, ideally into a liquid form.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{right. well, what about }
<C>__{cowboy}
<D>__{golly! so that's why my milk comes out that funny green color! i thought the grass tasted funny! wow, rick, you're a genius!}

<P>__{(smiles warmly)}
<D>__{good thinking, rick.}
<A>__{the freaks all nod in agreement.}
<C>__{nosey}
<D>__{way to go, rick! how did you ever think of such a plan?}
<A>__{rick pulls out an old comic book and points to an ad for sea monkeys.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{well, actually, i was going to suggest we send away for sea monkeys, train them to fire guns, and make a break for it. but if you want to go with this other thing, i guess that's okay.}
<A>__{the freaks stare at him, not sure if he's kidding or not.}
