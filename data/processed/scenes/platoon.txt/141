<A>__{in the jungle itself, the enemy is moving. flurries of movement and sound, blurred visuals. hands taping a piece of cloth to a tree, moving on revealing a luminous arrow pointing left ... figures moving past it. hands unraveling a thin wire waist high, backwards. hands sliding along another wire. we now see a moving helmet with a luminous plaque on the back of it, leading a file up the wire. to a jump off point about 50 yards outside the u.s. perimeter. figures crouch. whispers. movement. a pen flashlight on a drawing of the foxhole positions. the nva moving out in several directions at once.}
