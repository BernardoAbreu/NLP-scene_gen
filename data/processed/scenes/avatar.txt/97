<L>__{exterior rainforest aerial day}
<A>__{a samson thunders over the rainforest, climbing into the mist shrouded mountains. in the sealed cockpit, norm is up front, sitting left seat so trudy can talk him through the flight controls. jake and grace are behind them, in the jump seats. grace and norm's unconscious avatars ride in the open back compartment.}
<C>__{trudy}
<D>__{it only takes tiny inputs. here, put your hand on the cyclic }
<A>__{she points to the stick between her knees. norm hesitantly reaches over and rests his hand on hers.}
<C>__{trudy}
<D>__{feel how small the moves are? you barely have to think it, and the aircraft reacts.}
<A>__{on norm reacting to tiny inputs from the hot lady pilot. the samson is dwarfed by enormous arches of rock.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{see these magnetic formations. we're getting close.}
<C>__{trudy}
<D>__{yeah we are. look at my instruments.}
<A>__{on the dash, many of the displays are fritzing out.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{yup. we're in the flux vortex.}
<A>__{ahead, a cloud bank parts, revealing the hallelujah mountains. right in front of them.}
<C>__{norm}
<D>__{oh. my. god.}
<A>__{jake leans forward between the seatbacks for a good look out the front canopy. jake's pov enormous islands of rock are hovering a half mile above the ground. they are overgrown with rainforest, and straggly beards of vines hang down beneath them. waterfalls stream down the sides and dissolve into spray at the bottom. on jake, staring in amazement. it is both awe inspiring and disturbing. trudy turns, grinning at jake.}
<C>__{trudy}
<D>__{you should see your face.}
<A>__{wide aerial the samson is tiny as it approaches the floating islands of rock. an archipelago among the clouds, they cast great shadows over the forested slopes below.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{yeah, so what does hold them up? grace explained it to me some kind of maglev effect because unobtanium is a superconductor, or something. at least somebody understands it. just not me.}
