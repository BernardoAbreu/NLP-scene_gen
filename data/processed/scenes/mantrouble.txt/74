<L>__{exterior andy's house garage night}
<A>__{joan and helen enter the garage. joan gets into the driver's seat and closes the door, while helen maneuvers on her crutches around to the passenger side. angle inside joan's car joan turns the ignition on and as she starts to buckle herself in, her eye catches the movement of something at the back of the garage. from behind a sheet of plywood resting against the back wall of the garage, and just visible in the darkness, a man's hand can be seen reaching to the handle of an ax in amongst other gardening tools in an iron rack. helen opens the passenger door and joan whispers to her:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{helen, quick, get in the car!}
<A>__{helen leans down and looks in at her:}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{looking in the direction of joan's gaze she sees the dark figure of a man wearing a hood over his head, stepping out from behind the sheet of plywood, holding the ax in his hand and as he moves toward the front of the car, she screams. he lifts the ax over his head and swings it down vio lently, cleaving the blade into the hood of the mercedes. (from inside the house, duke can be heard barking furiously.) joan leaps from the car and in stark terror, runs out of the garage toward the house. stopped by the sounds of helen's hysteria, she turns around to see her, hampered by her crutches and unable to move. on the hooded man's eyes, shifting their homicidal intent from helen to joan. joan runs back into the garage and frantically tries to pull helen away from her death grip on the door handle. the man begins stalking around the front of the car toward her. she grabs one of helen's crutches and raises it up as if to hit him. as he steps back to the ax and tries to extract it from the hood, she suddenly rushes at him and begins belaboring him with the crutch. he lifts an arm to fend off the blows while his other hand con tinues to tug at the ax handle.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{helen! help me!}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i can't! i can't move!!}
<A>__{raising both arms to protect himself, the man is forced to give ground, moving further back into the garage, with joan continuing to batter at him. then in a sudden burst of rage he grabs hold of the crutch, yanks it from her grasp and lunges at her.}
