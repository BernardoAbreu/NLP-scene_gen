<L>__{exterior the neighborhood park twilight}
<A>__{in the neighborhood park, gloomy members of various cliques sit in silence at picnic tables. all are ludicrously wearing guest passes. betty finn mumbles down to her potato salad. earl frazier stoically stares off into space. heavy metaler clyde holds an absurdly large picnic basket.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{what the fuck?}
<B>__{news set}
<A>__{completely flabbergasted, veronica manages a light tone.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{the world wants winners, i guess. not people stained with loserness.}
<C>__{whitney james}
<D>__{stained with loserness. oh, i like it. can i use that. it'd be dynamite on interoffice memoranda.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{it's all yours, heather. now if you'll excuse me, i'm going to go throw up.}
<C>__{whitney james}
<D>__{sure. ciao.}
<B>__{studio floor}
<A>__{sickened, veronica stumbles onto the studio floor. studio lights suddenly pop on, momentarily blinding her. pauline grabs veronica by the arm and shouts into the air.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{everyone take their places on the stage!}
<P>__{(to veronica)}
<D>__{isn't this thrilling?!}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{but ms. fleming, it's just not right.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{what, the wine? i realize you're all under 21, but it seemed like such a perfect touch.}
<P>__{(shouting upward)}
<D>__{could we get some more light up here?}
<B>__{the stage}
<A>__{the pink armbanded aryan youths form a circle on the circular stage. pauline moves to a microphone at the center stage beside a seated whitney james who's tuning her electric guitar. veronica helplessly stands between the circle of students and the two female hosts as the cameras go on. pauline sings speaks into the microphone while whitney james strums her guitar.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{our schools have been torn apart by tragedy. let's fuse them back together through love . let's clasp hands and connect ourselves in one mighty circuit like a dove .}
<A>__{the students sthereally reach out to each other and clasp hands. veronica quivers for a moment then bursts through a handholding heather duke and heather mcnamara and off the stage.}
<C>__{pauline }
<D>__{let's begin a new happiness...}
<A>__{veronica swaggers past a seated technician. he pushes up a console lever causing the outer edge of the stage, where the circle of hand holding students is, to slowly spin around the singing pauline and the strumming whitney james.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{...with no more suicide...}
<C>__{students}
<P>__{(eeriely)}
<D>__{oh yeah...}
<A>__{ripping off her pink armband, veronica freezes. standing at the wine and cheese table, gunslinger coat and all, is j.d. he turns around and raises his wine glass for a gleeful toast.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{holy traumatic experiences, batman. i'm sorry you felt you had to put yourself through all that shit. i told you it wouldn't...hey, it's in the past already, right?}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{no more problems....}
<A>__{devastated, veronica sways back toward the technician's console.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{oh yeah.}
<A>__{veronica slams the lever back down forcing the spinning circle of handholding, pink armbanded students to crash to the ground around a taken aback pauline and whitney james.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{cute.}
<A>__{whitney james playfully lets off a hendrixian riff before coolly leaning over to her microphone.}
<C>__{whitney james}
<D>__{let's go for another take.}
<B>__{outside studio doors}
<A>__{veronica bursts through the studio doors, panting rapidly. she kicks off her shoes and begins to jog barefoot through the station hallway, weaving through various reporter types.}
