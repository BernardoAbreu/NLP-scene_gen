<L>__{interior arthur avenue apartment bedroom day (feb. 1943)}
<A>__{jake, wearing pleated dress slacks, sits on the edge of the bed examining his muscle tone. he studies his small fists. squeezes each knuckle. twists his wrists. clenches. unclenches. vickie steps out of the bathroom wearing a nightie and panties.}
<C>__{vickie}
<D>__{are you sure we should be doing this?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{come over here.}
<C>__{vickie}
<D>__{you said never to touch you before a fight.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(lovingly)}
<D>__{if you let me do it, i will murder you. come here.}
<C>__{vickie}
<D>__{you said i couldn't. you've been good for two weeks...}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{come here.}
<A>__{jake watches vickie approach him. he respects her as he would a shrine; he slowly removes her sheer nightie. his round hands caress her smooth skin. he glides his bruised knuckles across her shoulders, pride on his face. she kisses his bruised knuckles sensuously, then his bruised face.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{take off my pants.}
<C>__{vickie}
<D>__{jake...}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{do what i say.}
<A>__{he touches her breasts as she removes his trousers.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{now take the rest off.}
<C>__{vickie}
<D>__{jake, you made me promise not to get you excited.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{go 'head. do it.}
<A>__{she pulls off his shorts. vickie is now getting excited. she kisses his chest and licks it.}
<C>__{vickie}
<D>__{i like the gym smell.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{now take your panties off.}
<A>__{she does.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{now, touch me...}
<P>__{(takes her hand)}
<D>__{... here.}
<C>__{vickie}
<D>__{oh, jake.}
<A>__{she caresses his broad shoulders and runs her hand along his erection. jake's lips are trembling. he quickly turns his back on vickie, goes into the bathroom, and gets a full glass of cold water. vickie watches as he puts his erection in the glass of cold water. she is shocked and surprised.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i can't do it. i can't fool around. this robinson, i gotta beat him again. i can't fool around. don't come near me.}
<A>__{jake grabs her again and kisses her. then, gently but firmly, he turns her around and pushes her out. (it's starting again, and he must stop it.) he goes back the bathroom and closes the door.}
