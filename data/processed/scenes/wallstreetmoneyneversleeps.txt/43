<C>__{parlor}
<A>__{a huge chandelier hangs over the all marble room. a fireplace on one wall and a twelve foot wall of glass featuring that park view on the other. and jacob realizes that sonata is live. he's walked into a recital of some sort. about twenty people sit watching a young girl play on a very unique looking silver grand piano. the girl can't be a day over thirteen. she's playing mozart's "ronda alla turca"... her fingers gliding across the keyboard in precision, her eyes closed in inspiration. it's as spectacular as it is moving. jacob takes it in for a moment then looks over the room. all ethnicities and types... the african leader in full tribal gear, the disheveled artist with his gay novelist lover, the new york knick with his model wife, the movie star with her teenage son. and bretton woods... mid 40s, slicing jawline, deep set eyes, in great shape, refined, composed and masculine. he's the owner of this penthouse and he's looking right at jacob. jacob looks away. and the young girl finishes the last movement of the sonata to applause. the guests all stand, some go talk with the girl. bretton heads over to jacob.}

<D>__{as you can see, i'm having a little dinner party here but i thought it was important we speak right away.}
<A>__{he speaks with a british accent.. jacob nods. bretton looks over the room for a moment, scans his guests then back at jacob...}
<C>__{bretton woods }
<D>__{please... if you don't mind waiting in my office, i will be in a minute.}
<A>__{and the butler is already at jacob's side, motioning him to follow him.}
