<A>__{no inspiration. she puts down the pen, looking at her dog, who's curled up on the bed.}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{what do you think...time for some personal experiences to fuel our minds?}
<A>__{the dog's eyes blink, but no more than that.}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{i agree.}
<A>__{rennie moves to her closet, finding a silk blouse and some black satin pants.}

<A>__{wind is picking up, sweeping thick mist past a row of decorative flags. one of them flaps back...and exposes}
<B>__{jason.}
<A>__{through jason's eyes (flying wall efx) as the flag whips our faces. we move through it, down the empty passageway, coming to a porthole window. rennie's window. we peer through it with unnerving intensity at the backside of rennie as she pulls off her t shirt, slipping on the blouse. camera continues through the tiny round window, floating across the room, over toby and the bed...until we're inches from the back of rennie's head. she suddenly spins around in fright, facing us point blank, and:}

<B>__{dog toby}
<A>__{begins to bark vociferously, rushing to her cabin door, scratching to get out. rennie's eyes are distracted to toby for a second; when she looks back at the porthole, she sees:}
<B>__{an empty window}
<A>__{no water, no drowning boy.}
<B>__{rennie}
<A>__{snaps out of it, moving to the door, where her dog is frantically clawing with his fur up.}
