<A>__{we seem at first to be in the electronic world still, flying over a vast circuit board lit by countless dots of light. while this is our impression, and closely after the last dialogue in the preceding scene, we hear the sound o.s. of a phone ringing, as heard by the party placing the call. then the click of the receiver being picked up, and a male voice (dillinger's) answering:}
<C>__{dillinger }
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{a secretarial voice }
<D>__{mr. dillinger?}
<C>__{dillinger's voice }
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{a secretarial voice }
<D>__{hello, please hold a moment for the master control program}
<A>__{as we fly over the grid, descending, the image comes into clearer focus, and we realize that this is not a circuit board, but rather an actual landscape, a suburban grid at twilight. we are approaching a skyscraper which is yet too far off to distinguish accurately. as we descend, a thumping, rhythmic noise gradually increases in volume until it is very loud, and we realize it is the sound of a helicopter, and we are in the cockpit looking down at the landscape. we just become aware of this fact when the sound of a conversation begins, obviously between the pilot of the 'copter and a passenger.}
