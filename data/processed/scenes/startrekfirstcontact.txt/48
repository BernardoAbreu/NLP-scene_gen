<L>__{interior missile silo continuous}
<A>__{picard, geordi and beverly step onto the catwalk, which surrounds the silo walls. in the middle is the warp ship itself. it should look like an advanced icbm missile with a cockpit in place of the warhead, and with numerous modifications to the fuselage. the cockpit is on the same level as the control room. on the side of the missile is the name "phoenix". the missile itself extends down another four stories. there are other catwalks below this one, with ladders connecting the different levels. beverly sees something below.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{there.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{two catwalks below we can see a man sprawled on the grating. they all scramble down the ladders past the massive missile. (note: because of the design of the silo, we will see the entire missile only in a few shots. for the most part, our view is limited to sections of the missile.) beverly reaches the man, who is lying face down on the metal grating. she scans him...}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{severe radiation exposure...}
<A>__{geordi looks over at the section of the missile on their level. the side panels have been removed, revealing complex circuitry within. picard joins beverly, who turns over the injured man. it's zephram cochrane the man whose picture we saw on the borg monitors. beverly begins pulling devices out of her medkit, injects cochrane with a hypospray. cochrane is a man in his mid forties. he has a youthful, dynamic appearance marred by recent radiation burns.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{it's cochrane.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{i've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. i want to take him to the ship.}
<A>__{picard nods, reaches into his pants pocket, takes out a combadge.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{picard to enterprise.}
<P>__{(no response)}
<D>__{enterprise, please respond.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{it could be the radiation, captain. try from the surface.}
<A>__{picard nods... then takes a deep breath, tries to orient himself to the task at hand... there's a lot at stake and a lot to do. he turns to geordi.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{mister la forge, listen very carefully. if you remember your history... in less than twenty four hours, a vulcan ship will be passing through this system. when it does, this ship needs to be in space, flying at warp speed.}
<A>__{geordi takes a deep breath, it's a tall order.}
<C>__{geordi}
<D>__{i'd better get started.}
<A>__{geordi goes to work. picard bends down and carefully hoists cochrane up into a fireman's carry. beverly follows him up the catwalk...}
