<A>__{constanze and mozart make their way quickly through a crowd of actors in turbans and caftans, and stagehands carrying bits of the dismantled set of seraglio. we see all the turmoil of backstage after a performance. a fireman passes mozart carrying a small bucket of water. mozart snatches it from him and pushes his way through the crowd to madame weber, who still lies prone on the stage. mozart pushes through the crowd surrounding her and throws water on her face. she is instantly revived by the shock. constanze assists her to rise.}
