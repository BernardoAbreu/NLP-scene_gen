<A>__{ester stirs from slumber. on the ground beside her, she finds a bowl of food and a water gallon. now through the gloom, she sees lincoln, sitting on the stool like he never left, keeping vigil. something seems different about him as he turns, registering her }

<D>__{a r e you alright?}
<C>__{ester}
<D>__{i feel better after i sleep.}
<A>__{lincoln nods absently and stares off out of the doorway. ester moves closer, sensing something. he speaks as if from far away }
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{the man out there... he said everything has a spirit... every living thing... but not...}
<A>__{his voice cuts off. ester looks at him, recognizing his pain. she doesn't understand what it is or what caused it. it's pain and it evokes a response in her. a feeling, taking her over. her hand reaches out and strokes his hair. lincoln looks up at her, questioning. with supreme knowing, ester leans down and kisses him. at the touch of her lips, lincoln pauses. the first kiss for both of them but ester takes it in her stride. the calm ballet of nature. fluidly peeling off her shirt, breasts steeping with moonlight. lincoln rising to face her, feeling her proximity, her radiant heat. his fingers touching her breasts. ester trembling, her lips once more finding his. lincoln closing his eyes, the rush of sensation, overwhelming. he yields to it, returning the kiss, with hunger, with passion... with spirit.}
