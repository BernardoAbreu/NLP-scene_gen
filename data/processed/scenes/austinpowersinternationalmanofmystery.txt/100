<L>__{interior tank area}
<A>__{austin and vanessa slowly descend towards the water. they can see the water bubbling beneath them.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{what's your plan?}
<A>__{just then, a sea bass jumps out of the water, just missing austin.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{first, i plan to soil myself. then, i plan to regroup and think about the next move. any thoughts?}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{sadly, no. hold on! i always keep this on me just in case.}
<A>__{she pulls out a container of dental floss.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{all right, i get it. i have bad teeth. you have to understand, in britain in the sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. it didn't matter.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{no, no, no. we'll use the floss to get to the ledge.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{smashing idea! give it to me.}
<A>__{austin takes the container and draws out four feet of dental floss and spins the container above his head like a bolo. he throws it and it wraps around a radiator and it catches like a grappling hook. austin begins drawing out the floss to take up the slack. meanwhile, the slow dipping mechanism is edging towards the sea bass. unfortunately, austin is still drawing out the floss. he keeps pulling out floss. more floss still. the mechanism continues to sink. finally, the floss line goes taut. austin ties it off high on the pole of the slow dipping mechanism. austin holds out his hand like a surgeon vanessa places a tube of toothpaste in his hand. meanwhile the guard is reaching to undo the floss. austin places the open tube on his palm, aimed at the guard. vanessa whistles at the guard loudly. he turns around.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{judo chop!}
<A>__{austin judo chops the toothpaste tube, sending a stream of toothpaste into the guard's eyes.}
<C>__{guard}
<P>__{(screaming, rubbing his eyes)}
<D>__{my eyes! my eyes!}
<A>__{austin folds the tube across the top of the wire, grabbing both ends.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{hold on, vanessa!}
<A>__{she grabs onto him and they slide down the floss to safety right as the dipping mechanism goes under the water. meanwhile, the guard waits for them with toothpaste smeared all over his face. he and austin struggle. the guard manages to get austin pinned to the ground, austin's head dangling over the water. sea bass circle. the water boils, dangerously close to austin's head.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{austin, watch out!}
<A>__{austin flips the guard over. the sea bass chew the guard's head off like a blender.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{not a good time to lose one's head.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{indeed.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{that's not the way to get ahead in life.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{it's a shame he wasn't more headstrong.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{shut up.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{fair enough.}
<A>__{they head out a door. angle on the headless torso. the name tag reads "john smith."}
