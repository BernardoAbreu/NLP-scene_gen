<D>__{girls, time for school!}
<A>__{sam, nicki and emily come sit on the coach with sari fabric thrown over it and ethnic looking pillows. nicki flips up her ray bans slowly. sam has messy hair, she looks like she got home late. she's eating a bowl of cereal, nicki's on her blackberry. the room is filled with buddha statues and balinese wood carved furniture and candles. the girls are flipping through magazines.}

<D>__{put the phone away...ok you guys, today's lesson is about character development. in "the secret" we talk about the law of attraction and we want to be careful about the people we surround ourselves with because we become the average of those people. so we're going to make a visual board of people who are demonstrating good character, like angelina jolie. so what are some qualities you admire about her?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{her husband.}
<A>__{the girls chuckle.}
