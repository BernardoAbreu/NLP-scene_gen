<L>__{interior museum hallways night}
<A>__{kawakita tears up the dark stairs. he turns a corner and something jumps out at him. he almost screams. it's a drunk.}
<C>__{drunk}
<D>__{hey, where 'za little boys room?}
<C>__{kawakita}
<D>__{down that hallway. but don't stay long. you don't want to be here alone.}
<L>__{interior margo's lab night}
<A>__{margo and frock enter and huddle over a sheaf of papers that the printer has spit out.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{all right, assuming the program is accurate, this is a description of the animal with that claw.}
<P>__{(she reads)}
<D>__{"species unidentified. genus: unidentified. phylum unknown. male, weight in excess of 240 kg. brain capacity, 900 centimeters." that means it's highly intelligent. "quadrupedal."}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{quadrupedal! the other name for mbwun. "he who walks on all fours."}
<A>__{margo and frock exchange a look. holy shit. margo swallows and keeps reading.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{"nocturnal. external hair and bony plates. locomotor speed 60 70 kilometers. reduced optic chiasm"... poor eyesight. "external mucoid nasal glands,"... very keen scent... "morphological characteristics: highly robust. aggressiveness: extreme."}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{so the claw came from a huge creature with a preternatural sense of smell and poor eyesight that hunts at night.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{with the intelligence of a human being, the speed of a greyhound, and the strength of a grizzly bear.}
<C>__{frock}
<P>__{(a long moment)}
<D>__{margo, what you've just described is a killing machine.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{and it's hungry. it's been two days since it's eaten. there are five hundred people arriving right now. the animal hunts at night and it has a keen sense of smell! all those people in one enclosed space...}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{it's like ringing the dinner bell.}
