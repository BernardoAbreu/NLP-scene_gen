<A>__{rachel sits on the floor looking towards the living room, staring at something. rachel's p.o.v ...three pots have been placed under drips from the ceiling inside the room. we hear the three distinct notes of the water drops. rachel stares dully at the water dripping, feeling exhausted and numb. a key scrapes and rachel turns to the door as stephan and david walk in, hair soaked from the rain.}

<P>__{(standing up)}
<D>__{what did he say?}
<A>__{stephan stalks past, ignoring her.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you made contact?}
<A>__{david nods. david looks after stephan who's walked on into the living room in grim silence.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{what did he say?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's going to take time. they need to open up a new route, they need to find political help. maybe the americans. two weeks... maybe three.}
<A>__{rachel reacts with dismay. rachel moves after david towards the living room. the camera continues after her.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{we work four shifts guarding him. we feed him at the end of each shift. we never leave him alone.}

<P>__{(turns to rachel, hard)}
<D>__{and you're compromised. you don't leave the fucking house.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{we can do this. we just need to stay focussed.}
<A>__{the three turn to stare at something off screen. the camera continues into the room to find vogel's body slumped on the floor, bound to the radiator, mouth taped, slumped, unconscious. we continue towards him...closing on his face...closer...then his eyes open and he looks at us...}
