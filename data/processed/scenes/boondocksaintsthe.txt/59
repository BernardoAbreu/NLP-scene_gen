<L>__{interior plaza hotel suite night}
<A>__{they crash through the ceiling right above the fat man's head. the rope gets caught and slams the boys to a halt, hanging them upside down, back to back about six feet above the floor. they are turning in circles. the boss is balled up in the fetal position on the floor. the shocked russians say only a word or two in panic before the macmanus brothers react, reaching for their guns. the russians start to reach for their guns. it's too late. the boys draw and fire as they spin. taking four shots apiece. there are eight dead russians. chests explode as they fall back on the couch in a loose circle. one victims is blasted over the couch. they notice the fat man directly beneath them. murphy grabs his rambo knife, reaches up and cuts the rope. they land in a heap, scramble over to the doomed man and place him on his knees. they each put a gun to the back of his head and recite this prayer in perfect unison.}
<C>__{both}
<D>__{and shepherds we shall be. for thee, my lord, for thee. power hath descended forth from thy hand that our feet may swiftly carry out thy command. so we shall flow a river forth to thee and teeming with souls shall it ever be. e nomini patri, et fili e spiritu sancti.}
<A>__{with the silenced pop from their guns we cut the sound and go to black and white. (slo mo) choral music starts with latin script being read in the background. they take their rosaries out. they slowly walk around, mumbling prayers as they care for the dead. they gently turn over the bodies that were on their stomachs. they brush the hair back from the victims faces. they place pennies in the eyes of al the corpses. when they finish their ritual, they pull off their masks and look at each other. they start to grin and look around. they work each other into a healthy chuckle.}
<C>__{connor}
<P>__{(looks up)}
<D>__{that was some good fuckin' rope.}
<A>__{they both laugh.}

<A>__{they are already striding for a suitcase full of money. murphy picks up a wad of bills.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{i love our new job.}
<A>__{just then, there's a knock at the door. they snap into action. they stand at each side of the double doors, looking through the peepholes. they see rocco on the other side dressed as a hotel employee. he wears a polyester shirt with gold trim and a name tag that reads jaffar. he has a good cart in front of him. they look at each other and grin. murphy nods. as they open the door, murphy grabs the food cart and pulls it in. connor seizes the mortified rocco and pulls him in, slamming the door shut behind him. they run, dragging him and then throw him in the midst of the bodies. they put their guns right in his face.}
<C>__{rocco}

<A>__{rocco is silent and surprised. murphy, also surprised, looks at rocco. all is quiet.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{yeah, get a hold of yourself.}
<A>__{murphy jokingly slaps rocco a second time. rocco instantly jumps on murphy, cursing and punching. the brothers burst into laughter as they subdue rocco. as he calms down, they release him.}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{listen, we gotta get outta here now. we'll take separate exits and meet at rocco's.}
<A>__{murphy puts the two suitcases in his duffle bag and the two brush by rocco who is still unsatisfied with his explanation.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{fuck!}
<A>__{back to present interior rocco's apartment night rocco has removed his hotel jacket.}
<C>__{rocco}

<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{don't you think that's a little psycho? a little weird?}
<C>__{connor}
<D>__{weird, huh?... know what i think is weird? decent men with loving families go home every day after work. they turn on the news and see rapists, murderers, and child molesters all getting out of prison.}
<C>__{murphy}

<A>__{rocco ponders this as the boys continue to clean their weapons.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{you guys should be in every major city.}
<A>__{the boys chuckle. rocco steadily works himself into a humorous frenzy.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{this is some heavy shit. this is like lone ranger heavy man. fuck it! there's so much shit that pisses me off. you guys should recruit 'cause i am sick and fuckin' tired of walkin' down the street waitin' for one of these assholes to get me, y'know?}
<C>__{murphy}

<D>__{hallelujah, jaffar.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{so you're not just talkin' mob guys. you're talkin' anyone, right? even like pimps and drug dealers and all that shit?}
<A>__{the boys look at each other and nod.}
<C>__{rocco}
<D>__{well fuck, you guys could do this every day.}
