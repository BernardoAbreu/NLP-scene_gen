<A>__{helena waits on a bench in the empty room. maybe a few scruffy magazines? but nothing of use to her in here except she's near berlin. he arrives like every hope got abandoned and sits next to her. they clasp one another's hands before she embraces him.}

<D>__{you don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{i wanna be near you ...}

<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i think they're gonna arrest me.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{i don't want them to arrest you.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{it's not as bad as it sounds .. they can't refuse me bail. raise bail of my own cognizance & find the best damned lawyer there is ..}
