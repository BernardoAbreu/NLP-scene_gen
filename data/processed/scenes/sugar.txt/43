<L>__{interior miguel's home night}
<A>__{miguel opens a new bottle of rum, pours shots for everyone. the whole family and all of miguel's neighbors are jammed inside the tiny house and spilling out into the street. merengue blasts from the new home stereo system. friends and family pat miguel on the back. he smiles, basking in the glory of success. erica kisses miguel on the cheek.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{don't forget to call everyday. i want to know everything!}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{everything?}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{you know what i mean, dummy.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{of course i will be calling to keep you in check, make sure your grades don't slip.}
<C>__{erica}
<D>__{look who's talking.}
<A>__{carmen interrupts, drapes her arms around miguel, kissing him repeatedly. as erica looks on, we get the sense that she's used to being on the outside of this kind of attention.}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{you are my hero!}
<A>__{carmen pulls miguel close, takes something from her pocket, puts it in his hand.}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{it was your father's. i want you to take it with you...}
<A>__{miguel looks at the cross, kisses his mother on the cheek. as he looks up, he notices erica slip away.}
<C>__{carmen}
<D>__{you've been given a wonderful gift, miguelito. and god willing, you will continue to do great things with it. i love you so much.}
<A>__{she kisses him on the forehead. a series of jumpcuts present a variety of family and friends introducing themselves to miguel.}
<C>__{uncle angel}
<D>__{miguelito! you gonna remember your uncle angel when you're all big and famous? don't forget your family, kid. never forget where you came from.}
