<L>__{exterior epps's plantation cotton field day}
<A>__{solomon and the slaves pick cotton. armsby is conspicuously not laboring in the field. as solomon works he is watched by epps. watched more than he normally is. for a moment it seems it might just be a matter of perspective; solomon's unease over his actions. but soon epps is joined by armsby. the two men stand and talk, their looks locked toward solomon. whatever it is that is occurring between them continues for a long, long moment. but epps makes no move toward solomon. solomon continues with his work.}
