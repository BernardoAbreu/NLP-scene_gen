<L>__{exterior snow camp night}
<A>__{now in a kind of portable cell, madmartigan clutches the jail bars and looks out at the camp. fires and torches burn, and nockmaar soldiers patrol. shivering cold, willow sits cross legged in the jail, melting snow into a bowl. on a nearby lean to, where skins and shields are kept, raziel hangs in her cage. somewhere the baby is crying. in the distance sorsha goes inside one of the tenst. there's a muffled yel ling between sorsha and kael. then keal storms out of the tent and goes inside the tent next door. willow pours the ashes into the melted snow.}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{let it settle. carefully, slowly. concentration and will. now pour the water off.}
<A>__{as willow works, madmartigan binds together scrap sticks of wood, making a long pole. he gingerly hooks raziel's cage with this, lifting it from the spike.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{oooh, this smells terrible.}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{that's the life spark. exxence of magic and sorcery!}
<A>__{madmartigan angles the pole and the cage slide toard him. he grabs it with both hands and rips it apart. raziel right away scurries down the cell bars, jumps into the jail and bits willow's hand.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{ouch!!}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{shhhhh!}
<A>__{they look out nervously at patrolling nockmaar sol diers. willow sucks the back of his hand.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{what'd you bit me for!!}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{we need blood. to nourish the stone. charge the stone with ener gy.}
<A>__{willow drips his blood into the concoction then stirs it with a twig. it begins to glow from within.}
<C>__{raziel}
<D>__{the components of the stone are fusing...}
<A>__{willow's eyes widen with anticipation.}
