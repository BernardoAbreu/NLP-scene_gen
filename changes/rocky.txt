<LOC>__{INT. BLUE DOOR FIGHT CLUB - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{SUPERIMPOSE OVER ACTION... "NOVEMBER 12, 1975 - PHILADELPHIA" ... The club itself resembles a large unemptied trash-can. The boxing ring is extra small to insure constant battle. The lights overhead have barely enough wattage to see who is fighting. In the ring are two heavyweights, one white the other black. The white fighter is ROCKY BALBOA.  He is thirty years old. His face is scarred and thick around the nose... His black hair shines and hangs in his eyes.  Rocky fights in a plodding, machine-like style.  The BLACK FIGHTER dances and bangs combinations into Rocky's face with great accuracy. But the punches do not even cause Rocky to blink... He grins at his opponent and keeps grinding ahead. The people at ringside sit on folding chairs and clamor for blood... They lean out of their seats and heckle the fighters. In the thick smoke they resemble spectres.  Everyone is hustling bets... The action is even heavier in the balcony. A housewife yells for somebody to cover a two dollar bet. The BELL RINGS and the fighters return to their corner... Somebody heaves a beer can into the ring. The Black Fighter spits something red in a bucket and sneers across the ring at Rocky.}

The butt opens a bleeding cut on the corner of Rocky's eye. Rocky becomes furious over the foul and drives a flurry into the man's body... Rocky slams the man on the jaw and the fighter is out for the night.  The fans throw rubbish into the ring.  Rocky ignores it. The fans loudly go about collecting bets.  The referee does not bother to even count the fighter out and drags him under the ropes where he is placed on a stretcher.  Two new fighters enter the ring.  Rocky slips on a tattered robe. Embroidered clumsily on the back is, "The Italian Stallion."}

Before he even reaches the rear of the club the BELL RINGS and the next fight has already begun... Rocky fades into the darkness of the rear of the club.}

The fighter that Rocky has just defeated is drinking a beer and joking with three other fighters... Some of the fighters are smoking.  The room is cloudy. A short man of fifty enters.  He is dressed in a sweater buttoned over a t-shirt.}

Rocky drags the man into a protective passageway. Further down the street, Rocky pauses in front of the "ANIMAL TOWN PET SHOP"... He peers into the dark store and sees a sad, huge dog sitting in the window.  He mumbles to the dog and continues to the corner.}

As the CRACKLING MUSIC BEGINS, Rocky picks up his hairbrush.  Using it like a microphone, he mimes to the record.  He assumes the posture of a famous singer crooning to thousands of adoring fans... He then switches into a bullish fighting stance and throws several punches. The water boils.  Rocky soaks his badly-swollen hands.}

He taps the window and whistles.  He SEES a girl behind the counter and presses his face against the window and does his impression of the Hunchback of Notre Dame.  The girl nervously looks away. The girl behind the counter is ADRIAN KLEIN.  She is not very attractive, but pleasant-looking.  Thirty years old. Brown hair pulled back.  Light skinned.  She wears glasses.

He tears off the Washington outfit and it is clearly SEEN that Apollo Creed is garbed in an outrageous Uncle Sam outfit... On his head is a red, white and blue sequined top hat.

In the distance, Rocky floats INTO VIEW and Adrian flattens against the wall and waits for the procession to pass. The procession approaches and she clearly sees Rocky's unbelievably battered but smiling face.  He appears to be king of the world. The procession approaches and passes Adrian.  She jumps on her toes and waves frantically but is not seen.  She screams Rocky's name... Somehow the delicate voice knifes through the racket and reaches Rocky. Rocky frantically looks in all directions and barely manages to see Adrian jumping up and down waving.  The crowd is carrying him away.  He attempts to lower himself but the crowd won't permit it. Rocky instead turns and begins climbing across people's heads and shoulders.  He resembles a man trying to go up a down escalator.  People are jammed so tightly together Rocky manages to crawl across them to Adrian. Still suspended in air, Rocky leans down and Adrian jumps up and they lock in an embrace.}
