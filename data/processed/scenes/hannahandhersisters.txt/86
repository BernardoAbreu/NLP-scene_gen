<A>__{the dark hallway is illuminated by light coming from the offscreen foyer; pictures line the wall. piano music is still heard very softly in the background as hannah, hugging herself, walks slowly down the hallway into the living room. she briefly looks around, lost in thought. she sits down heavily, tiredly, on the arm of the couch as the movie cuts to several framed photographs on the mantel. one shows hannah and elliot on their wedding day. another shows elliot, obscured in the shadows. yet another has captured norma as a young girl. the camera, however, moves closer and closer to a photograph showing hannah, lee, and holly, the three sisters, smiling into the camera. there is no sound.}
