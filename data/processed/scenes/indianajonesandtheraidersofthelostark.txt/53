<L>__{exterior courtyard sallah's house night}
<A>__{indy and sallah sit in the small, protected courtyard. sallah holds the two sections of the headpiece, the medallion and the base, and has for the first time fitted them together. they fit perfectly and complete the headpiece. he peruses the markings on the headpiece quizzically. indy is cleaning and loading a .45 automatic.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i knew the germans would hire you, sallah. they couldn't have an excavation in the desert without the best digger in egypt.}
<C>__{sallah}
<D>__{all arabs look alike to them, indy.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{tell me about the map room at tanis.}
<C>__{sallah}
<D>__{we found it three days ago. i broke through myself.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{those nazis are moving awfully fast.}
<C>__{sallah}
<D>__{the frenchman is helping them.}
<A>__{indy reacts.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{belloq. so he got away from the indians. this is going to be more interesting that i thought.}
<C>__{sallah}
<D>__{i'm afraid this has put the germans close to finding the well of the souls.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(indicates the headpiece)}
<D>__{even belloq won't be able to find it without that. can you make anything of those markings? they're nothing i'm familiar with.}
<C>__{sallah}
<P>__{(shakes his head "no")}
<D>__{but i know someone who might. you can go to see him tomorrow.}
<P>__{(a worried expression)}
<D>__{indy... something bothers me.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{what is it, my friend?}
<A>__{sallah finds it hard to say. when he finally speaks, his words are accompanied by a strange, eerie, foreboding rush of wind through the courtyard. just a coincidence we might suppose.}
<C>__{sallah}
<D>__{it is the ark. if it is there, at tanis... it is not something man was meant to disturb... death has always surrounded it. it is not of this earth.}
<A>__{the wind dies down. indy shakes off a chill and stares thoughtfully at his friend.}
