<L>__{interior deckard's apartment bathroom night}
<A>__{he's lying in the tub with a drink, eyes half mast, water up to his chin, bruised and beat, but looking just a little wicked in his balmy luxury.}
<C>__{deckard }
<D>__{i knew a cop once who was involved in a high speed chase. they shot out one of his tires and he went over a cliff at hundred and fifty miles an hour. they found him in the morning with a broken skull, six fractured ribs and second degree burns. on the way to the hospital he made a play for the nurse.}
<A>__{he takes a drink and clears his throat.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{hey! i thought you were supposed to be taking care of me.}
<C>__{rachael's voice}
<D>__{what do you need?}
<A>__{he doesn't answer. lies there sipping his drink. rachael comes in a little uncertain, a little droll, and stands there looking down at him.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{don't just stand there looking at me. it's not polite.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{what do you want me to do?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{sit.}
<A>__{she sits on the edge of the tub.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{gimme your arm.}
<A>__{she's wearing a short sleeved dress. it's a long, del icate arm and deckard holds it, inspecting it like a maestro with a stradivarius. he looks up at her.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{you ever take a bath with a man before?}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{there's a lot i haven't done with a man before.}
<A>__{he's got her hand in the water and had begun to soap her arm. starting with her wrist and running the bar to her elbow, up and down, slow and slippery. she watches, not quite sure of the ritual. he pulls her closer, and runs his hand up higher, mould ing and pressing, working around her flesh, up and under her arm into the privacy of her dress.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{you're getting me wet.}
<A>__{oh, yes. for a moment deckard stares at her like some furry legged satyr in rut, the fingers of his other hand rake through her hair and into the water she comes.}
