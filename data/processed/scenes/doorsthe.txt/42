<A>__{ride the snake ride the snake, to the lake the ancient lake the snake is long, seven miles ride the snake he's old, and his skin is cold camera pulling out from his eyes. there's something different tonight. something in the air. his eyes are open, he's facing outward, gripping the mike for his life, hair falling in his face, dripping sweat, we sense all his soul concentrated in what he has to say. cliques of groupies have staked claims at the foot of the stage, eyes fucking him as he writhes, spreading his legs. every twitch, every moment he sucks out the tension on the musical interludes generates a whip of a reaction in his audience. nobody is moving in the club. the dancers are still, the go go girls in their white plastic boots and dresses hang motionless in their gilded cages. even the waitresses have stopped, frozen with their trays, denying something is going to happen. pamela, dorothy... jerry from the fog, also the manager of this place, watches from the balcony, shaking his head, doesn't understand. panning to two record types with him jac holzman, distinguished six footer, suit, and paul rothchild, funky, pigtailed, ex con, early 30s.}

<A>__{the band has come together fully now. robbie's fingers sliding across the trembling strings, staring at the ceiling, wandering around the darkened portions of stage left, he feels jim echoes him back with his flamenco blues guitar. john on drums, reading jim's moods, throws in the spontaneous and violent riffs that keep it savage. he literally tortures jim's ears with his drums. and ray, concentrated with his nodding head like a big flamingo over his keyboard, mixing it up, throwing curves, yet also and more delicately torturing jim with the messianic organ sounds that shriek in his ears. there is something of merlin in ray the alchemist knowing how to play jim. and jim "that sneaky silent lithe flowing flexing animal" ready at last to share both his body and his soul with the world, to live out the words of the indian prophet... to lead.}

<A>__{ray looks over up from his board, catches robby with a 'what's this?' look... they go with it, improvising... jim clutching the mike tighter, seeking solace in its arms; it all hangs in the air as if he doesn't have any idea what he's going to say nexterior}

<A>__{the screams primal, pure jim indian savagery ripped from the depths of his soul, of his pain bouncing off the walls... as the audience gasps, shocked, stunned... as the guitar hits a high, horrid reverb, jim in slightly slow motion suddenly tightens his backbone as if electrocuted and shoots violently backwards, hitting the floor like a puppet cut from his string we sense jim himself has crossed a barrier now, gone into yet another stage of his performance, a stage from which he can never return. like the gunfighter who has killed his first man. ray sees it instantly where it's going, hits the organ! robbie and john follow. the instruments explode all at once trying to bury jim in his primal unmistakeable scream. the club in shock. tribal taboo broken in one instant. jerry exploding off the balcony toward the stage... pamela, extremely moved and impressed, and dorothy... the go go girls, as jaded as they come, are stunned tension... the groupies love it. jim has jumped up now, dancing an indian war dance around the mike.}
