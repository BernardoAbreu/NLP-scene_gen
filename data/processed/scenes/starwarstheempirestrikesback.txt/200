<L>__{interior cloud city junk room}
<A>__{the room is piled high with broken and discarded machine parts. four ugnaughts, small hoglike creatures, separate the junk and throw some pieces onto a conveyer belt which moves briskly toward a pit of molten metal. pieces of threepio's golden body move down the belt. chewie enters the room and spots an ugnaught picking up and inspecting threepio's head. the wookiee barks a command, startling the ugnaught, then reaches to grab the head. but the ugnaught tosses it away from him to another ugnaught. this game of keep away goes on until threepio's head falls from their grip and bounces with a clang onto the ground.}
