<C>__{ms. rain}
<D>__{precious, bring your journal to me.}
<A>__{precious waits a moment and then shakes her head without looking up. ms. rain goes to her desk and picks up the journal without resistance. the words "why me?" sit alone on the page with lines crossed through them. ms. rain returns the journal to precious' desk still opened to the same page.}
<C>__{ms. rain}
<D>__{precious, would you come to my office for a moment?}

<C>__{ms. rain}
<D>__{i think telling your story will get you over that river precious ...}

<D>__{open your notebook precious.}
<C>__{precious}
<P>__{(exasperated)}

<C>__{ms. rain}

<D>__{and why not?!}
<A>__{precious doesn't answer.}
<C>__{ms. rain}
<D>__{because you love her...as much as she loves you.}
<A>__{precious looks to her side and finds rita smiling reassuringly through her crooked teeth.}
<C>__{ms. rain}
<D>__{now the rest of the world can judge you, cheat you, beat you, dismiss you and abandon you all it wants but we won't let you give up and that's the only thing that matters. some people have less than that on their side and still manage to keep going.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's up to you.}
<A>__{precious thinks a long moment, wipes her face and exhales. she doesn't move for what seems like ages. the whole class watches her until ms. rain motions for them to continue working. finally, precious takes hold of her pen, opens her journal, sighs deeply and starts to write again.}
