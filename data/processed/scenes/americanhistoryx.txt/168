<P>__{(imitating)}
<D>__{oh go girlfriend! don’t be puttin’ up wid dat, girl! oh stop girl!}
<A>__{seth and cammeron laugh together.}
<L>__{interior can – tight on little henry}
<A>__{he watches his brother jerome and three others finish loading. henry sits in the driver’s seat as the four get out of the white van. brandishing ak 47’s and pistols, henry watches them follow seth and cam through the van mirrors. tight on their feet. the men close in. panning upwards – the one with a blue bandana on his head is jerome.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{are we goin’ to the hospital or what?}
<C>__{jerome }
<D>__{funny you say that, vinyard.}
<A>__{seth and cam freeze in their tracks. as they wheel with their guns, the black men open fire. shots virtually tear apart their bodies and they fall to the pavement. as seth and cammeron lie in pools of blood, the assassins quickly walk over and examine their faces. cammeron struggles to stay alive.}
<D>__{thug #1}
<P>__{(quickly checking them out)}
<D>__{what the fuck?! i thought you said he was here!}

<D>__{cammeron alexander. long time no see, nigger bitch.}
<A>__{a siren builds in the background.}
<D>__{thug #1 lets’s go!}
<A>__{three of the men jet back to the white van – jerome staying behind. he grabs cammeron and drags him over to the curb.}
<D>__{thug #2}
<P>__{(to jerome)}
<D>__{come on, man!}
<A>__{jerome places cameron’s mouth on the corner of the curb.}
<C>__{cammeron}
<P>__{(delirious, half dead)}
<D>__{where we goin’?}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{how does hell sound?}
<A>__{jerome slams his foot to the back of cam’s head. as sirens approach from almost around the corner, he runs back to the van and little henry takes off down the street. the two bodies lay there – blood escaping them. moving upwards – we see their transfixed bodies composed over the lights of venice.}
