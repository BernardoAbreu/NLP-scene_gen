<L>__{interior loft day}
<A>__{eric, barechested, emotionally tapped, clean of makeup and blood but exhausted, his movements retarded and slack. staring fixedly into the fireplace, where he burns everything he could find of his past: the junk from the makeup table, the masques, photos of himself and shelly.}
<L>__{interior loft stairwell day}
<A>__{moving with elly as she nears the open loft door. she peeks cautiously inside.}
<B>__{resume eric}
<A>__{without looking toward the door, he speaks.}
<C>__{elly}
<D>__{what's going on...?}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{a remembrance.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{a closure.}
<A>__{and eric consigns to the fire the dress we saw earlier. holds a photograph in a broken frame. cracked glass. subject: eric and shelly, goofing for the camera. he chucks it into the fire. draws a deep breath.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{better now. i feel good. how are you, elly, my friend?}
<A>__{elly is clearly uncomfortable, groping for an excuse just to see eric. eric is staring at her, intently.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{elly}
<D>__{i knew. i knew i knew you. even with the makeup and stuff you wore.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you really loved her, didn't you?}
<A>__{close up fireplace the photo burns and blackens in the grate.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{you brought flowers. as long as you don't forget her, elly, she lives.}
<C>__{elly}
<P>__{(upset)}
<D>__{she's dead. she's gone. and now you're just gonna go away and never come back, too. i hate this place; it isn't fair.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{elly...}
<A>__{he draws her close. wipes away an errant tear with his thumb.}
<C>__{eric }
<D>__{sometimes the people we care about are gone, for no reason. sometimes that's really tough. i cry. but if the people we love are gone, we keep them }
<A>__{he taps elly's temple, then his won.}
<C>__{eric }
<D>__{ right here. it's a big responsibility. and that makes it okay to mourn.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i know that if you weren't here, i'd be very sad.}
<A>__{elly gives eric a hug.}
<C>__{elly}
<D>__{you look funny without your white face on. like it's your day off or something.}
<A>__{he quizzical expression amuses him.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{somebody here wants to meet you. gabriel?}
<A>__{gabriel the cat has wandered near the fireplace to join them. elly is immediately smitten. happy.}
<C>__{elly}
<D>__{i remember him! here, gabriel... here kitty... gabriel... is he still yours?}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i think he's yours, now.}
<A>__{the cat seems to like that idea. elly wraps him hugely up in her arms, talking to him: "how're you, gabriel, whatcha doin'" another angle tighter on eric while elly is preoccupied with the cat, eric gives up his last bit of shelly to the fire a portrait photo of her, small and creased. he puts it in the fire, watches it burn for a beat, then turns to elly.}
<C>__{eric }
<D>__{i have something else for you.}
<A>__{back focus as eric lifts off his neck shelly's ring for elly's inspection. the ring twirls large in f.g.}
<C>__{elly}
<D>__{nobody ever gave me something like that before. ever.}
<A>__{eric places it around her neck. elly beams.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{shelly would've wanted you to have it. this way, you'll think of her every time you see it...}
<C>__{elly}
<D>__{and she'll be alive. up here.}
<A>__{elly taps her own temple with a smile, keeping one hand on the ring.}
