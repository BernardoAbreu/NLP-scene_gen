<A>__{the place is empty and silent and washed dirty by the deep gray of the cloudy sky. we see sam's truck turning into the driveway and pulling to a stop. after a moment, sam and lila get out of the truck.}
<B>__{fresh angle}
<A>__{close on sam and lila as they meet on the porch side of the truck. the motel office and the house beyond can be seen in b.g. of shot. sam and lila merely stare for a moment, then turn and gaze up at the house. there is no figure in the window and the shade is drawn. same goes to the office door, peers in, knocks, opens door, enters. lila remains on the driveway, beside the truck.}
