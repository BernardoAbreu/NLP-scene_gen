<L>__{interior hitchcock house, bedroom day}
<A>__{on the stereo. alma finds hitch on the sofa swaddled in a blanket and eating ice cream.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{may i turn that down?}
<A>__{she silences the stereo. hitch doesn't react.}
<C>__{alma }
<D>__{you'll be pleased to know order has been restored.}
<A>__{he still doesn't look at her, masticating loudly.}
<C>__{alma }
<D>__{a thank you would be nice.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{we're still two days behind and sixty thousand over budget.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{i already cancelled the wrap party. that'll save us two thousand right there. and you won't be tempted by any champagne and cake.}
<A>__{she pulls at the bowl of ice cream. he refuses to let go.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{beware all men are potential murderers.}
<A>__{she yanks it from his grip.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{with good reason.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{alright, what's this about?}
<A>__{he slowly pulls the aspirin bottle from his robe pocket, building suspense as he unscrews the lid and pours sand into a tiny pile on the coffee table in front of him.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{spending a lot of time at the beach?}
<A>__{he puts down the bottle, looking for a reaction.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{that's where whit and i are writing. he's rented a place.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{hardly the ideal setting to avoid distractions.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{actually, it's very conducive to creative collaboration.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{i already told you that treatment is a waste of time.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{didn't everyone say the same thing about "psycho"?}
<A>__{she reaches for the aspirin bottle to throw it away but hitch grabs it first }
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{are you and whit having an affair?}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{don't be absurd. he's working on something new and needs a little help, that's all.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{what a coincidence. i'm working on something new and i could use a little help too.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{what do you think i've been doing?}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{then why are you spending all hours of the day and night with some overage, talentless mamma's boy?}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{because it's fun.}
<A>__{he quivers, livid.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{i am under extraordinary pressures on this picture, the least you can do is give me your full support.}
<C>__{alma}
<D>__{full support? we've mortgaged our house. my house.}
<A>__{alma's eyes flash with unaccustomed hurt and fury.}
<C>__{alma }
<D>__{might i remind you that i have weighed in on every aspect of this film so far, as i have done on every picture you've done in the last three decades. and the first time you show the film, it will be my notes that you want. i celebrate with you if the reviews are good and i cry for you if they are not. i host your parties and put up with those fantasy romances with your leading ladies. and when you're out promoting this film around the world, i will stand beside or, rather, slightly behind you, smiling endlessly for the press even when i'm ready to drop, being gracious to people who look through me as if i were invisible because all they can see is the grand and glorious "alfred hitchcock."}
<A>__{hitchcock is stunned and silent.}
<C>__{alma }
<D>__{now, for the first time in years, i dare to work on something that isn't "an alfred hitchcock production" and i'm met with accusation and criticisms. this work i'm doing with whit gives me pleasure and purpose.}
<C>__{alma }
<D>__{and even though that takes absolutely nothing away from you, please consider this a reminder: i am your wife, alma reville, not one of the contract blondes you badger and torment with your oh so specific direction.}
<A>__{she turns and, with great dignity, leaves hitchcock sitting in the gathering gloom. he's not the only one who can deliver a killer blow.}
