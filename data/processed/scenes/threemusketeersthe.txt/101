<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{d'artagnan's pov black screen out of the darkness, a face appears, blurry and obscured. it fills the screen, slowly swimming into focus. it is milady de winter, even more beautiful in closeup. familiar, and no doubt deadly, ivory combs gleam in her hair. she smiles warmly.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{welcome back. did you dream?}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{reveals the interior of a bed chamber at a roadside inn. d'artagnan, regaining his senses, finds himself propped up in a large bed. he blinks into the face of milady who sits at the edge. his eyes widen with recognition, faint awe.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{you.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{have we met?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i... saw you in paris.}
<A>__{d'artagnan notices that his shoulder has been bandaged. he looks around the large room. a fire roars in the grate. food and drink have been set upon a table. d'artagnan continues, still groggy, uncertain:}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{where am i...?}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{this is calais.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<P>__{(with a jolt)}
<D>__{calais!}
<P>__{(muttered; to self)}
<D>__{the ship... tuesday at midnight...}
<A>__{d'artagnan leaps out of bed. then realizes he is stark naked. milady smiles. d'artagnan gathers a bedsheet around him.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<P>__{(frantic)}
<D>__{where are my clothes?}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{filthy. i'm having them cleaned. is something wrong?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{what day is it? what time?!}
<A>__{d'artagnan runs to a window, and throws open the shutters. beyond: the harbor lights of the port of calais.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{it's tuesday, near nine.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{nine? are you sure?}
<A>__{somewhere in the night, a bell tolls the hour. milady smiles.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{quite sure.}
<A>__{d'artagnan relaxes slightly. milady rises from the bed. she wears a sky blue dressing gown, something soft and silken beneath it. d'artagnan reacts perceptibly. enjoying his discomfort, milady crosses the room, joins him at the window.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{are you in a hurry?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{how did i... get here?}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{i found you in the road. discarded. like an unwanted kitten. do you have a name or shall i make one up for you?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{my name is d'artagnan.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{d'artagnan. i like that. i am the countess de winter. milady.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{countess?}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{my husband's dead.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{i have learned to live with death.}
<A>__{she manages to combine sympathy, seduction, and just a hint of danger. all in a single reply. d'artagnan hesitates, he is not immune to her charms, then:}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{countess, i'm very grateful for what you've done, but i can't stay here. i've got...}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{what...?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{important business.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{how mysterious. a handsome young man with 'important business' in the still of night. does it involve a young lady?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{does it require clothes?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{yes. i need my clothes.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{they won't be ready for at least an hour.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{an hour?}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{i told the innkeeper to bring them when they are dry. until then, i'm afraid you are my prisoner. would the prisoner care for a drink?}
<A>__{milady crosses to the table, food and drink upon it. as she passes by the fire, her dressing gown seems to disappear, revealing a silhouette that makes d'artagnan's heart stop.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<P>__{(always innocent; never coy)}
<D>__{i am... thirsty.}
<A>__{milady pours wine into glasses, turns to face him. and offers a smile that dazzles and burns.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{good. then we will sit by the fire, and eat and drink, and you may impress, perhaps even move me, with the story of how you came to lie unconscious, in the middle of the night, on the road to calais.}
<P>__{(soft seductively)}
<D>__{i love a good adventure.}
<A>__{d'artagnan hesitates, then steps to her.}
