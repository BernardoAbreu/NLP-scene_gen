<L>__{interior ben's study day}
<A>__{ben's study is in chaos. the books have been plucked from the shelves and the contents of his drawers emptied on the floor. ben standing in the middle of the room surveying the vandalism.}
<L>__{interior bruwer kitchen afternoon}
<A>__{this is a medium sized kitchen with two doors leading from it, one to the dining room and the other to the living room. it has not changed since it was furnished twenty years ago, the only modern appliances being the electric stove and a modern mixer on the working table. ben is leaning against the wall next to the door leading to the living room, drinking coffee. melanie, bare feet, her long black hair tied up in a ribbon, is washing up. she looks younger and fragile with this hair style.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{what about you?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i mean not married...}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{and living in this chaos with my eccentric father? i love him and we get on perfectly. we have been together since i was a year old. my mother could not adapt to south africa. she went back to london and we've never heard from her since.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{being a professor and bringing up a child, how did he manage that?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{dorothy, dear dorothy, she was a fantastic mother. in fact she had two families, me and her three children in alexandra township.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{and this little girl grew up to be a tough journalist. why a journalist?}
<C>__{melanie}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{sometimes i ask myself the same question.}
<A>__{she leans against the sink and picks up her mug of coffee.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{alright. i will tell you. i was brought up in a sheltered way, not that dad was possessive, not openly anyway. i think he'd just seen enough of the mess the world was in, to want to protect me as much as he could. then, i went to university. i don't know what you'll think... being a teacher.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{then i married my ex teacher.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{oh. he must have been young.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{fifteen years difference. he too protected me like dad. then one day i visited dorothy in alexandra and saw her home and the appalling conditions in that township. i was shocked, ben, and ashamed.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{go on.}
<A>__{melanie pours him another mug of coffee and starts to wipe up.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{that made me think that i was a parasite, something white and maggot like... just a thing... a sweet and ineffectual thing. i felt more and more claustrophobic. poor brian, who loved and pampered me. had no idea what was happening. i left him for a whole year and we divorced.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{and then you became a journalist?}
<A>__{melanie goes to the living room, as she passes ben she touches his arm and continues talking.}
<C>__{melanie }
<D>__{i thought it would force me, or help me, to expose myself. to force me to see and to take notice of what was happening around me.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{did it work? she returns to the kitchen with a cigarette.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i wish i could give you a straight answer. what did help me was my}
<A>__{wanderings in africa.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{how did you manage that on a south african passport? we south africans are white devils in africa.}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{my mother was english, remember? so i get a british passport. it comes in handy even for the paper.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you really are your father's daughter!}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{i wonder what he's doing right now. most likely standing on a rock, looking through his old binoculars at springbok or a lion or whatever. one of the two large cats approaches them, tail in the air, and goes to melanie, drubbing against her legs, purring luxuriously. she picks it up into her arms.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{how often does he go on these trips to the veldt?}
<C>__{melanie}
<D>__{it depends }
<P>__{(approaching ben with cat)}
<D>__{ bonjour, ben. i'm porto and my friend is bello! ben smiles and starts to caress porto in melanie's arms.}
