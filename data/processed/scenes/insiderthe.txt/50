<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior wigand's car wide frontal day}
<A>__{jeff's car in the field, the giant colgate palmolive clock behind. the rain stopped. steam rises from the weed strewn empty lot. lowell's in the front seat. and we get the feeling they've been talking for hours...}
<C>__{lowell's voice }
<D>__{just give me an example...}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{for example. james burke, the ceo of johnson & johnson...when he found out that some lunatic had put poison in tylenol bottles, he didn't argue}
<A>__{with the}
<D>__{fda... he didn't even wait}
<A>__{for the fda}
<D>__{to tell him. he just pulled tylenol off every shelf of every store right across america. instantly. and then he developed the safety cap... because, look, as a ceo, sure, he's gotta be a great businessman, right? but he's also a man of science. he's not going to allow his company...to put on the shelf...a product that might hurt people.}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{not like the seven dwarfs...}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{seven dwarfs?}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{the seven ceos of big tobacco...they got up in front of congress that time...it was on television...}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{...and swore under oath that they know nothing about addiction, disease...}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{it was on c span. yeah.}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{okay, so, here you are...you go to work for tobacco.}
<P>__{(after beat)}
<D>__{you come from corporate cultures where research, really, creative thinking, these are core values. you go to tobacco... tobacco is a sales culture. market and sell enormous volume. go to a lot of golf tournaments. the hell with everything else.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what are you doing? why are you working for "tobacco" in the first place?}
<C>__{wigand}
<P>__{(deadly honest)}
<D>__{i can't talk about it. the work i was supposed to do...might have had some positive effect. i don't know...it could have been beneficial.}
<P>__{(bitterness there)}
<D>__{mostly, i got paid a lot. i took the money. my wife was happy. my kids had good medical. good schools. got a great house.}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{i mean, what the hell is wrong with that...?}
<A>__{he looks at lowell, as if needing validation...}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{nothing's wrong with that. that's it; you're making money...you're providing for your family? what could be wrong with that?}
<A>__{it's quiet. after some moments...}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{i've always thought of myself...as a man of science. that's what's wrong with it.}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{then...you're in a state of conflict, jeff.}
<A>__{jeffrey doesn't say anything.}
<C>__{lowell }
<D>__{because, look, here's how it lays out: if you got vital, insider stuff the american people for their welfare really do}
<A>__{need}
<D>__{to know...and you feel impelled to disclose it and violate your agreement in doing so, that's one thing. on the other hand, if you want to honor this agreement, then that's simple. you do so. you say nothing. you do nothing. there's only one guy who can figure that out for you. and that's you. all by yourself.}
<A>__{lowell's evenhanded...is it too evenhanded? as wigand contemplates the edge he's standing on, they're quiet. then wigand sees the time...}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{i've got to go pick up the girls. they only had half a day...}
<A>__{lowell nods. jeffrey starts the car. the windshield wipers screech on a dry window. their eyes meet. as they drive off...we hold on the colgate palmolive clock.}
