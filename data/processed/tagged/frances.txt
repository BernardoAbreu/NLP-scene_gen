<B>__{prologue}
<A>__{black. we hear the soft voice of frances farmer.}
<C>__{frances }
<D>__{no one ever came up to me and said, 'you're a fool. there isn't such a thing as god. somebody's been stuffing you.'}
<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{exterior puget sound day}
<A>__{on an expanse of water, calm and undisturbed. after a moment, it begins to ripple as something rises toward the surface. a girl's face breaks through.}
<C>__{frances }
<D>__{it wasn't a murder. i think god just died of old age. and when i realized he wasn't any more, it didn't shock me. it seemed natural and right.}
<A>__{the girl, frances, is 16, blond, very pretty: she seems like the most persuasive proof imaginable of god's existence. she swims toward the shore with long graceful strokes... then climbs the steps of the old wood jetty on west point beach.}
<C>__{frances }
<D>__{and yet i began to wonder what the minister meant when he said, 'god, the father, sees even the smallest sparrow fall. he watches over all his children.' that jumbled it all up for me.}
<L>__{exterior puget sound later}
<A>__{the banks of puget sound, dotted with elm trees. frances sits comfortably in the fork of a tree writing in her diary. towel around her neck, her hair splayed out and drying golden in the sun.}
<C>__{frances }
<D>__{but still sometimes i found that god was useful to remember, especially when i lost things that were important. 'please god, let me find my red hat with the blue trimmings.'}
<L>__{interior farmer home family room evening}
<A>__{frances is now reading aloud from her diary, gently swaying back and forth in a rocking chair. an older woman, lillian farmer, sits opposite on the couch, listening and nodding from time to time. a small suitcase stands by the front door.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{it usually worked. god became a superfather that couldn't spank me. but if i wanted a thing badly enough, he arranged it.}
<A>__{ernest farmer appears in the doorway and hesitates, listening to his daughter read.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{but if god loved all of his children equally, why did he bother about my red hat and let other people lose their fathers and mothers for always?}
<A>__{ernest goes to frances and kisses her softly on the top of her head. she looks at him briefly, smiling slightly.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{bye, baby.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{see you next weekend, dad.}
<A>__{he goes to the door and picks up his suitcase, glances at lillian. she doesn't look up. he leaves.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{i began to see that he didn't have much to do about hats or people dying or anything. they happened whether he wanted them to or not, and he stayed in heaven and pretended not to notice.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior auditorium day}
<A>__{frances stands at a podium. other students and teachers sit to either side of her on folding chairs. above the proscenium is engraved: west seattle high school. below that a banner hangs: "national high school essay competition, 1931."}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{i wondered a little why god was such a useless thing. it seemed a waste of time to have him. after that he became less and less, until he was... nothingness.}
<A>__{the audience consists of parents, students, and local dignitaries. we see several shocked faces. lillian is there also, smiling. seated next to her is a distinguished looking woman, alma styles. ernest sits on the other side of the auditorium, looking a little worried.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{i felt rather proud that i had found the truth myself, without help from anyone. it puzzled me that other people hadn't found out, too. god was gone. we had reached past him. why couldn't they see it? it still puzzles me.}
<A>__{frances closes her notebook and looks up, waiting for some response. there is a deep shocked silence, then a smattering of applause. lillian claps enthusiastically, then rises to her feet. in the back a woman also stands.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{you're going straight to hell, frances farmer!}
<A>__{a stately man sitting next to her, her husband judge benjamin hillier, puts a restraining hand on her arm. the woman continues to glare at frances. frances stares back, dumbfounded.}
<T>__{smash cut to:}
<L>__{exterior seattle streets day}
<A>__{the screen erupts into violence. a large unruly mob skirmishes with police in a cobblestoned square. on a truckbed addressing the crowd which carries placards reading: "organize now!", "workers of the world unite!", and "elect kaminski!" stands martoni kaminski. by his side, leading the crowd's responses, stands a younger man with sharp piercing eyes, harry york.}
<C>__{kaminski}
<D>__{and do you think it's radical for a man to have a job and feed a family? york & crowd no!}
<C>__{kaminski}
<D>__{is it radical for you to have a hand in shaping your future, and the future of your children? york & crowd no!}
<C>__{kaminski}
<D>__{is it radical for the wealth of this country to be turned back to the people who built the country? york & crowd no! no!}
<C>__{kaminski}
<D>__{good! because, brothers, that's you!}
<A>__{the crowd cheers. harry york gives kaminski the thumbs up sign as a banner unfurls: "today seattle tomorrow the world."}
<T>__{fade to black: fade in:}
<A>__{a title comes on screen: god's in his heaven and all's right with the world? 'not so!' says young frances farmer we realize we've been watching a newsreel. we see the school superintendent presenting frances with an award.}
<C>__{announcer}
<D>__{seattle is in the news again as a high school junior wins a national competition and a hundred dollar prize with an essay denying god.}
<A>__{city hall steps. judge hillier and other bigwigs speaking heatedly to reporters.}
<C>__{announcer}
<D>__{this prompts civic officials to charge that left wing politicians are encouraging atheism in the city's schools. miss frances farmer was unavailable for comment, but her mother lillian }
<A>__{lillian stands in front of her wood frame house addressing a small crowd of reporters, photographers, and curious neighbors.}
<C>__{announcer}
<D>__{farmer, a well known local dietician, stepped to her daughter's defense.}
<C>__{lillian}
<P>__{(emphatically)}
<D>__{frances has not turned her back on the lord, they're just having a momentary difference of opinion. what child hasn't questioned the lord's mysteries in order to better understand them? to paraphrase mr. voltaire, i may not agree with what she says, but i will defend to the death her right to say it. freedom of speech, unlike in the dark countries to the east, still lives in america! and in my home.}
<A>__{among the audience in the cinema, we see frances and her father. frances slinks down in her seat until she's hidden from sight.}
<L>__{exterior suburban street (seattle) day}
<A>__{frances carries library books and a small grocery bag. her hair and skin gleam in the sun. people in their yards stare at her as she passes. she walks on, coming to a group of children slightly younger than herself who are playing in front of a union hall. a girl, emma, 13, glances up.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{hi emma.}
<A>__{emma looks away quickly, returns to her play.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{bye emma.}
<A>__{frances shakes her head as she walks on.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{frances hesitates, then turns to look: a man in his twenties whom we recognize as harry york, kaminski's compatriot, leaves a group of men in front of the union hall and walks toward her.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(friendly)}
<D>__{c'mere. i wanna talk to you.}
<A>__{frances keeps walking. harry hurries after her.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh?}
<P>__{(reaches her, grabs her arm)}
<D>__{hey!}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{don't touch me.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm not gonna hurt you. i just wanna talk.}
<A>__{she stares at him. he's got a newspaper wedged under one arm.}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(waiting)}
<D>__{okay then...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{i'm causing trouble?! you're a pain in the butt! you newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since i won that dumb contest. i'm just sixteen, you know? who the hell cares what i think?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{not me. but other people seem to.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{yeah. well if you didn't put it in the papers nobody'd even know about it.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{now wait a minute, sweetie. do i look like a newshound to you?}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(examining him)}
<D>__{no... actually, you look more like a cop.}
<A>__{harry laughs.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{that's rich. hey, if i was a cop, i'd be packing, right?}
<P>__{(holding coat open)}
<D>__{you see a gun? go on, search me. pat me down.}
<A>__{frances hesitates, leans toward him as though about to frisk him. their eyes meet, and she pulls away, suddenly embarrassed.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{i will... take your word for it. so who are you, then?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{harry york. i work for martoni kaminski, he's running for congress here.}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(smiles & points to him)}
<D>__{oh yeah! i saw you in the newsreel!}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{yeah, well }
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{you know, my dad's done some work for kaminski...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{now you're catchin' on. don't wanna get your daddy in hot water, do you?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{whattaya mean?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well... see the papers've got us pegged as pinkos, then you come along, the friendly neighborhood atheist }
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{but i'm not. the newspapers're }
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{right again. you're no more an atheist than my man's a red, but what they're doin', see, they're addin' up their version of your ideas with their version of ours. could look bad for your daddy.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{yeah. could look bad for you and kaminski too, i guess.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{sure don't talk like you're sixteen.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{well aren't you the smoothie. now you're going to ask for my number, i suppose.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i suppose not. gotta ask you this, though: for all our sakes, you better keep your trap shut.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{well... i will give it a try, mr. york.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{harry.}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(hesitates, nods)}
<D>__{harry.}
<A>__{they half smile, awkwardly, as if neither really wants this encounter to end. then harry doffs his hat.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{bye.}
<A>__{she nods shyly and starts up the path toward the house.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(admiring her)}
<D>__{sure don't walk like sixteen, neither.}
<L>__{interior courtroom late afternoon}
<A>__{close on judge hillier in his robes, identified by a nameplate on the bench.}
<C>__{hillier}
<D>__{these are perilous times. with the economic collapse comes hopelessness and desperation; and people turn to dangerous ideas }
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{the camera pulls slowly back. we see that the courtroom is empty.}
<C>__{hillier}
<D>__{those of us who represent law and order must be vigilant. who's behind this, her mother?}
<A>__{now we see who he's talking to: alma styles, the woman who sat with lillian at the school auditorium.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{impossible. as her attorney, i've known her for years.}
<C>__{hillier}
<D>__{what about the father, he's a little pink. maybe he wants to show our schools in a bad light, shift some support to kaminski and those jackals.}
<C>__{styles}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{he's no influence; he doesn't even live at home. no, i think frances wrote that essay with no mischief intended. it was her teacher who entered it in the competition.}
<C>__{hillier}
<D>__{well, the publicity must stop. it's no good for seattle and no good for the country.}
<P>__{(sternly)}
<D>__{keep an eye on this, will you, alma?}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{of course, your honor.}
<A>__{he nods with satisfaction. two right thinking people fighting for what they believe in.}
<L>__{interior farmer house dining room night}
<A>__{ernest farmer sits alone, motionless, at the table. between two candles, facing him, is frances' check for a hundred dollars. we hear bustle from behind the kitchen door, then lillian and frances enter juggling several hot dishes. ernest rises. they set down the dishes, frances intentionally placing the bread between the check and her father.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{it always amazes me, lil, how you can whip up a hot, hearty meal out of thin air.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{i can thank you for that. it was a hard earned talent.}
<A>__{she moves the bread so ernest again faces the check. as lillian slices the bread, father and daughter eat grimly.}
<C>__{lillian}
<P>__{(offering to ernest)}
<D>__{bread?}
<C>__{ernest}
<P>__{(taking a piece)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{when's the last time you saw a hundred dollars, ernest farmer?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{mama...}
<C>__{lillian}
<P>__{(pushing back her plate)}
<D>__{i'm not hungry. you two just enjoy yourselves. after all, this is a celebration.}
<A>__{she leaves. a long silence. they both glance slightly awkwardly at the check. frances takes it, folds it, and puts it in her pocket, out of sight.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{i'm... i'm really proud of you, frances.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{thanks, dad.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{an essay contest... a national contest. that's pretty impressive.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{i didn't have much to do with it.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{you wrote it, didn't you?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{yeah, i suppose... dad, who's harry york?}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{well, harry york is a guy who... well, he does a lot of things. why do you ask?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{he talked to me today. told me to keep my mouth shut or i'd get everybody in trouble.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{yeah... well... it's possible. harry york and i both work for mr. kaminski right now, and... well... there are lots of folks in this country who never got a square break. that's the way of things, but mr. kaminski wants to change it, and when it comes to new ideas, the people in power get nervous.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{is kaminski a communist?}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{no, no, no. all he wants to do is see the common man get a little representation.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{he's a socialist, then?}
<L>__{interior study lillian night}
<A>__{sitting at a rolltop desk. she's looking through a large scrapbook. we see articles about nutrition and diet, some featuring lillian's picture, others with her name in the heading. she listens to the conversation in the other room.}
<C>__{ernest }
<D>__{the label's not important, francie. what's important is: this country's got nine million unemployed and something's gotta be done about it. besides: left wing, right wing, up wing, down wing... they don't mean much. all a label is usually is a way to call somebody a dirty name.}
<A>__{lillian's face becomes set. she looks down at the book. an article titled "girl denies god" is there, freshly pasted. she lays a hand on the blank page opposite.}
<C>__{frances }
<D>__{it's already started, dad... with me.}
<C>__{ernest }
<D>__{i know.}
<L>__{interior dining room night}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{and i can't understand how it can hurt to be honest, but the more i tried to explain }
<P>__{(what i meant)}
<A>__{lillian appears in the doorway.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{don't listen to him, little sister. when you're proud of what you are, you don't refuse the label, understand?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{yes, ma.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{and you... should be proud. you won that contest and made a name for yourself.}
<A>__{she stomps out. frances and ernest push back their plates.}
<L>__{exterior back garden night}
<A>__{lillian is watering tomatoes in the dark and talking to them quietly. as ernest approaches, she senses him and grows silent. she speaks without turning around.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{you're poisoning that child's mind.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{i have a right to talk to her. she's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why i've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{you've sacrificed?! if you'd practice law for decent folk instead of communists and indigents }
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{they need help, lil. they pay me back in other ways.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{how? what do they do for you, kaminski and his friends? they're all anarchists! traitors!}
<C>__{ernest}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{no, lil. it's just you can't understand their brand of patriotism.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{that's right. i can't understand a man who puts strangers over his family, a man who gives up a good career to become a shiftless inkhorn failure.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{i'm going back to the hotel.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{good.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{see you next weekend?}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{as usual. everything as usual, mr. farmer. just give me my due.}
<A>__{ernest starts back toward the house. he sees frances watching them and slows down, turns...}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{lillian... i'm more than willing to meet you halfway.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{don't make me sick. i'd sooner drown myself in puget sound.}
<C>__{ernest}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{that's a thought, lil. that sure is a thought.}
<A>__{he trudges back toward the house under frances' eye. a woman's voice comes from behind the fence.}
<C>__{neighbor's voice}
<D>__{are you all right, dear?}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{i'm fine, perfectly fine.}

<L>__{exterior front porch night}
<A>__{ernest stands on the porch holding his little bag.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{dad, please, don't leave early. just because of mama }
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{francie, you'll learn that sometimes it's best to stay low and just walk away.}
<A>__{he trudges out and down the walk. frances watches him, shaking her head. that is not a lesson she wants to learn.}
<T>__{fade to black:}

<L>__{interior theatre lobby night}
<A>__{opening night. harry is reading a playbill displayed in a theatre lobby: "1934 spring production... university of washington players present: 'uncle vanya' by anton chekhov." frances is playing sonia. harry turns and enters the theatre.}

<L>__{interior university theatre stage night}
<A>__{frances on stage seen from a distance.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{what can we do, we must live! we shall live, uncle vanya...}
<A>__{frances is acting with a nervous young man, chet. as her speech progresses, the camera moves in nearer and nearer, ending with a close up. it is as if we are being drawn in by her emotion.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{and then we shall rest, we shall rest. we shall hear the angels, we shall see the whole sky all diamonds, we shall see how all earthly evil, all our sufferings, are drowned in the mercy that will fill the whole world. and our life will grow peaceful, tender, sweet as a caress...}
<P>__{(wipes away tears)}
<D>__{poor, dear uncle vanya, you are crying...}
<P>__{(through her tears)}
<D>__{in your life you haven't known what joy was; but wait, uncle vanya, wait... we shall rest...}
<P>__{(embraces him)}
<D>__{we shall rest!}
<A>__{curtains close. audience bursts into applause. as the curtain opens and the players take their bows, we see in the audience: lillian and ernest, lillian clapping madly, crying, nudging ernest to clap harder. and in the back stands harry york.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{not bad, farmer. not half bad.}
<L>__{interior university reading room night}
<A>__{a celebration in progress. masks of comedy and tragedy hang on the walls. drama students lounge about: eating, drinking, talking noisily. bing crosby is on the record player, singing "i've got the world on a string." the drama teacher is holding court to a group of attentive students.}
<C>__{drama teacher}
<D>__{art is a constant struggle. some of you have the will but not the ability. for others, the opposite. i don't wish to be harsh, but only one of you on stage tonight combined the two...}
<A>__{the front door opens. frances and chet enter.}
<C>__{drama teacher}
<D>__{on cue.}
<A>__{the young men rush over to congratulate her. frances takes a mock bow. she laughs as people cheer. two girls observe from the back.}
<D>__{girl #1 i could really learn to hate her. girl #2 stand in line.}
<L>__{interior university reading room several hours later}
<A>__{things have quieted down. the drama teacher has cornered frances and is gesticulating drunkenly, waving a copy of "voice of action." frances is also tipsy, but pays close attention to her mentor.}
<C>__{drama teacher}
<D>__{this is the answer: a subscription drive to "voice of action!" first prize is a trip to moscow! you could visit the art theatre, maybe even meet stanislavski!}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{but i will never win that.}
<C>__{drama teacher}
<D>__{yes, yes, it's all arranged. everyone's collecting subscriptions in your name. and the best part is: the trip returns you to new york.}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(intrigued)}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{drama teacher}
<D>__{new york, frances! broadway! this is your chance! you belong on the stage!}

<P>__{(flattered embarrassed)}
<D>__{thank you.}

<D>__{hi, harry. did you see the play?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you think i'd miss it?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{well? what'd you think?}

<D>__{you looked okay.}
<P>__{(glances around)}
<D>__{joint's pretty dead. how 'bout i take you home?}

<L>__{exterior west point beach night}
<A>__{the beach is very dark, but the sweep of the lighthouse picks up an old chevrolet parked near the shore.}

<D>__{you really think so?}

<A>__{frances and harry are sitting in the back seat.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{honest. when you were up there, you were really... there, know what i mean? everyone else looked stupid.}

<D>__{i don't know... i did... feel different... alive.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah, it's a gift. you gotta do something with it.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{yeah, but if i win this trip, mama'll kill me. she hates russians. i do want to go, though... to new york, especially... but i wanted to do it...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{quietly.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you're not the quiet type, frances.}
<A>__{they are silent for a while.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you know, my old man was an inventor. spent his whole life down in the basement trying to design transcontinental underground railroads, stuff like that. well, i was supposed to be his partner. when i told him the smell of his workshop made me sick, i thought he was going to die right there.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{what happened to him?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{he retired to florida... made a killing in vending machines.}
<A>__{he grins ironically and frances laughs.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i kick myself sometimes, but the thing is, i would have been miserable living his life.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{...so you think i should go.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{sure. try this acting thing. you can make good money at it.}
<C>__{frances}

<D>__{you don't know what you want.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{she looks at him, smiles wistfully.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{not in the long run, anyway.}
<A>__{she starts to unbutton her blouse. harry is pleasantly surprised, but unnerved.}

<D>__{frances...}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well... don't you think it's up to me to...}

<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{i thought we might go skinny dipping.}

<D>__{i have no doubt, mrs. farmer. if you'll speak to the girl at the desk, she'll arrange an appointment.}

<C>__{frances}
<D>__{thank you, harry.}
<A>__{she's untied. the orderly helps her up onto a gurney. she lies down. doyle nods to the orderly, who starts pushing her. she is wheeled out and down:}
<B>__{the hall}
<A>__{past other patients, doctors, etc. we see some of this from her point of view. she goes through two swinging doors, down another hall... at the end of which a man opens a door. she is pushed onto a:}
<B>__{stage}
<A>__{she is wheeled into a row... between two other patients. in the background we hear a voice:}
<C>__{dr. harlington }
<D>__{one merely inserts the leucotome beneath the eyelid and presses up into the prefrontal lobe, manipulating it so as to sever the nervous connections between the thalamofrontal radiation and the body of the brain.}
<A>__{the lights are bright, on her and the other patients. we cannot see, but we sense, an audience watching.}
<C>__{dr. harlington }
<D>__{because of the speed and simplicity of the operation, i am able, as you are seeing, to perform the procedure on ten patients in less than a half hour.}
<A>__{frances stares up at a fan in the ceiling. it's moving round and round. the voice drones on.}
<C>__{dr. harlington }
<D>__{the operation is completely painless and can be performed without any sedative whatsoever.}
<A>__{we now see vaguely that dr. harlington has moved to the patient on the adjacent gurney.}
<C>__{dr. harlington}
<D>__{we have always known that this form of radical treatment was effective, but until now it couldn't be applied on a large scale. the old procedure required a full day's work by a surgical team to perform a single operation. in the same time, working alone, i can treat fifty.}
<A>__{frances turns and stares mutely, without emotion, at what's happening next to her: the leucotome (an ice pick like instrument) is inserted into a woman's eye socket...}
<C>__{dr. harlington}
<D>__{this procedure works best on patients with extreme over reactions to emotional stimuli. it can also be used as a last resort on those who seem impervious to other forms of treatment.}
<A>__{the leucotome is then shoved up into the brain and twisted.}
<C>__{dr. harlington}
<D>__{in plain language, my technique severs the nerves which give emotional energy to ideas. along with the cure comes a loss of affect... a kind of emotional flattening...}
<A>__{frances turns away and stares at the fan again. there is something simple and pleasing about its rhythmic whirring...}
<C>__{dr. harlington}
<D>__{...with diminished creativity and imagination. patients become like good solid cake with no icing. but, after all, it is their emotions and imaginations that are disturbed.}
<A>__{we glimpse the leucotome being withdrawn.}
<C>__{dr. harlington}
<D>__{these patients will soon be leaving the hospital.}
<A>__{harlington's face moves vaguely into frances' view.}
<C>__{dr. harlington}
<D>__{lobotomy gets 'em home.}
<A>__{he moves directly over frances, his pleasant face obscuring the fan. as the leucotome descends, we:}

<A>__{total disrepair: peeling paint, broken steps, fallen shingles... this house is easing slowly back to nature...}
<L>__{interior farmer house living room day}
<A>__{neglect is just as evident inside. dust, faded rugs, torn yellow curtains. lillian sits on the couch staring out a window. she has aged and looks tiny, frail, with no trace of her old formidability. the scrapbook is open on her lap.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{what was i saying? oh yes, it was the communists that did it to frances.}
<A>__{ernest is hunched in a chair by the stone fireplace. four reporters crouch on the floor, totally bored. yesterday's headlines are now old news.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{they capture the mind by first seducing the heart. i suppose i never taught frances to close her heart...}
<A>__{two reporters rise and edge toward the door.}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{uh... excuse us, mrs. farmer. we're going to have to... uh...}
<C>__{third reporter}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{yeah, i better pack it in too.}

<A>__{the last reporter gets to his feet.}
<C>__{fourth reporter}
<P>__{(kindly)}
<D>__{i think we've had enough. thank you, mrs. farmer. goodbye.}
<A>__{he follows the others out. lillian climbs wearily to her feet and goes to the window, looks out. ernest stares into the fire.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{you know, ernie, i think we should have frances' room repainted for when she comes home. that'll brighten her day.}
<A>__{ernest looks at her wearily, as if she is stark raving mad. he knows damn well frances isn't coming home...}
<T>__{fade in on:}
<A>__{a television screen against a dark background the show is "this is your life". we see a smiling ralph edwards, reading from a large black book. next to him stands frances. she has aged dramatically, but is still a very handsome woman. she seems uncomfortable.}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{...dwayne steele divorced you, and from this point on, your story takes a darker turn. shunned by the hollywood you criticized so harshly, alienated from your family and friends, you turn your back on professional commitments in new york, and alcohol and drugs enter your life. these are sad, desperate times for you.}
<A>__{throughout this, frances' jaw works slowly back and forth, not from anger, but in embarrassment and doubt.}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{...until finally your mother finds it necessary to commit you to a state mental institution. were you mentally ill, frances?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{...no, ralph. i don't believe i ever was sick. but when you're treated like a patient long enough, you're apt to act like one...}
<A>__{we move away from the screen to see that the tv set is in the living room of a comfortable, tastefully furnished home. on the couch in front of the set sits harry york. he still looks athletic, young for his age. tears stream down his cheeks.}
<C>__{edwards }
<D>__{were you an alcoholic?}
<C>__{frances }
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{edwards }
<D>__{were you a drug addict?}

<D>__{no. never.}
<A>__{on the screen edwards has moved frances over to a seating area where various people from frances' life are waiting, smiling at her. we've never seen any of them before.}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{...and over 200 producers have been invited to watch your appearance here tonight... so who knows, frances farmer, anything's possible on your comeback trail!}
<P>__{(indicating seating area)}
<D>__{and since your friends tell me they have to drive you everywhere, look what we've got for you!}
<A>__{the curtains behind them open to reveal a car in a spotlight.}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{a brand new 1958 edsel!}

<C>__{frances}
<D>__{thank you, ralph.}

<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(vaguely)}
<D>__{no... no, someone's picking me up.}
<A>__{the people all excuse themselves, calling goodbye. frances waits by herself for a few moments, but soon begins to walk away down the sidewalk.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{she turns. harry is leaning against the side of a building, looking much as he did when they first met. but there is very little light of recognition in frances' eyes.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{c'mere. i want to talk to you.}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(flatly)}
<D>__{oh. why, harry york. how nice to see you.}
<A>__{harry is a little puzzled by her reaction.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{how... how ya doin', farmer?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{fine, thank you. did you watch the show?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{sure i did, that's why i'm here.}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(concerned)}

<P>__{(a glimmer, but she}

<D>__{well... you're looking well.}
<A>__{they are both silent a long moment.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{i got a new car. only it's red. did you know mama died?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah. yeah, i heard about that.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{dad, too. i sold the house. i'm a faceless sinner, harry...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{why do you say that?}

<D>__{i'd ask you to take me home, but i'm a faceless sinner.}
<P>__{(she smiles)}
<D>__{...you smell good, harry. familiar, you know? i'd ask you to take me home, but...}
<A>__{harry is alarmed now.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(taking her by the arm)}
<D>__{frances!}
<A>__{she angrily bares her teeth; then just as suddenly she relaxes and becomes lucid.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{don't get mad at me, harry. please. it's just... some things happen for the best.}
<A>__{beat. she takes his hand as if to shake it. harry clasps hers tenderly. she holds on like an old woman, stroking his hand. for an instant she gets lost in time, just holding his hand. then she looks up.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{it's going to be slow from now on. do you know what i mean, harry?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm not sure.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{very slow.}
<P>__{(uncertainly)}
<D>__{but we're not going to stop, are we?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(reassured)}
<D>__{no, we're not.}
<A>__{it is as if she is able to express in words the last remnant of her indomitable will... but the words bear no emotional power.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{goodbye, harry. it was very good to see you again.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yes. would you like me to walk a little way with you?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{that would be okay.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{just a little way.}
<A>__{he offers his arm. she takes it. all rather formal. they stroll on together.}
