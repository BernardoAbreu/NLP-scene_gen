<D>__{cris medium coffee, black, and a glazed.}
<A>__{as he waits, he sees a vague reflection in the glass display case: a square cross, coming into focus. puzzled, cris looks up and around to see the object that's being reflected. he can't find it. cris turns back to the display case, but the reflection is gone. the donut girl gives him his order. cris takes it, turns, and notices liz cooper sitting by herself at a booth, circling items in the classified section. he recognizes her as the future mother of his future child. cris gazes at her face, which is both childish and mature, shy yet indomitable. she turns, scowling, from the staring stranger. cris approaches liz and gives her that smile that always works.}
