<A>__{watson finishes off his thug and plucks the engagement ring off the floor, just as dredger flies through the air, slamming into watson, knocking him off his feet, and knocking the ring away. holmes looks at the lightning rod in his hand, stunned by the efficacy of the weapon. dredger tries to recover, climbing off of watson. holmes cranks his weapon. the rod sparks and hums. dredger pulls himself up with the help of a water pipe on the wall. holmes thinks quickly, then touches the other end of the pipe with the rod, and zzzapppp!! the electrical current runs along the pipe, and knocks dredger back twenty more feet. watson spots the ring rolling towards the window, starts running for it, frantic as dredger rises, a clear change in his demeanor. he looks at the sparking rod and races for the window as well. watson chases the engagement ring, bends down... just as he's about to grab it... thud! dredger's massive foot stomps down on the ring. dredger gives watson a cruel smile, then leaps out the window, landing atop a heap of coal. watson glares as holmes blasts past him, leaps out the window. watson picks up the ring, sees: the stone was knocked out of the setting, lost in the floorboards, the rest of the ring mangled. watson darkens, grips his ruined ring, and heads out }
