<L>__{interior room night}
<A>__{bob and lyn, their hands tied, sit on a mattress in the otherwise empty room, lit by a shaft of moonlight from the small window above them. from next door comes the faint sound of a period song playing. bob is losing it.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{we're going to die! i'm going to be killed by al qaeda!}
<A>__{from the next room we hear the young iraqis start to sing along to the track, laughing. lyn listens.}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{i don't think they're al qaeda.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{oh what the hell do you know? you don't know! you don't know anything! and this is all your fault!}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{bob, there's something i have to tell you. when i said i was retired from the unit, that was a lie. i'm on a mission. dewitts was just my cover. i've been reactivated. i couldn't tell you because this is a black op, but...i think you have a part to play. i think that's why you're with me.}
<A>__{bob collapses face down on the mattress.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(muffled)}
<D>__{you're an idiot. you want to know why i'm with you? because i got}
<P>__{drunk. (starting to cry a little)}
<D>__{i got drunk and i just wanted to get into iraq so i could prove to my wife i wasn't...just once that i...and now i'm going to die. she's right. i'm such a...}
<A>__{he dissolves into misery. lyn watches with sympathy.}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{have you heard of optimum}
<P>__{trajectory before? (no answer)}
<D>__{your life is like a river, bob. if you're aiming for a goal that isn't your destiny, you will always be swimming against the current. young ghandi wants to be a stock car racer? not gonna happen. little anne frank wants to be a high school teacher. tough titty anne. that's not your destiny. but you will go on to move the hearts and minds of millions. find out what your destiny is and the river will carry you. now sometimes events in life give an individual clues as to where their destiny lies.}
<C>__{lyn cassady }
<D>__{like those doodles you just "happened" to draw?}
<A>__{he unbuttons his shirt and reveals an eye tattooed on his chest very similar to the one bob had drawn. bob looks up.}
<C>__{lyn cassady }
<D>__{this is the ajna chakra the third eye the symbol of the jedi. when i saw you'd drawn it...well, the universe gives me a sign like that, i don't ignore it. you're meant to be here with me, bob. the jedi inside you sensed that.}
<A>__{bob stares at the eye.}
<C>__{lyn cassady }
<D>__{now listen to me. i don't think these guys are frl's or mehdi army... i think we're talking standard criminals here, okay? what they're gonna do is try and sell us on to another group. we can't let that happen.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{how are we gonna stop them? there's three of them! and they've got guns!}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{we're jedi, bob. the jedi don't fight with guns. we fight with our minds.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{let's say we have no choice but to fight with these men. then we use visual aesthetics to instill psychically in the enemy a disincentive to attack.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{okay, you lock eyes with one of them, you go into a monotone and you say "no, i'm not going to attack you." you totally relax your body and your voice. and then you rip out one of his eyeballs.}
<C>__{lyn cassady }
<D>__{or you use a pen, stab him in the neck, create a fountain of blood, i mean really a fountain, get the blood to squirt on his buddies. that's a psychic disincentive, right there.}
<A>__{bob thinks about this, a little nauseated.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{we haven't got a pen.}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{you're missing the pointerior}
<P>__{(standing up) here let me show you}
<D>__{something. stand up.}
<A>__{bob stands up reluctantly.}
<C>__{lyn cassady }
<D>__{choke me.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{oh...i don't want to lyn.}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{choke me. what am i gonna do?}
<P>__{(pointing at his throat) just}
<D>__{here. choke. choke.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i don't think i...there's sharp edges around here...}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{c'mon...(making quotation marks with his fingers) "attack me."}
<A>__{bob stares at him, a little annoyed by this.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{what's with the quotation fingers? that's like implying i'm you know...only capable of ironic attacking or...}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{quit jawing, bob, and choke me.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{well, if i choose to choke you, what are you going to do?}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{i'm going to interrupt your thought pattern.}
<A>__{bob thinks about this then raises his hands to choke lyn. lyn throws him sailing through the air. he crashes down into the floor behind lyn.}
<C>__{lyn cassady }
<D>__{see? i hardly moved. physics wise there's not much going on. it's the psychic energy that's important. (beat) you okay?}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(in pain)}
<D>__{sharp...edges...}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<P>__{(helping him up)}
<D>__{you felt fear didn't you? before hand?}
<A>__{bob massages his back, impressed despite himself.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{would you say that level of fear was abnormal for you?}
<A>__{bob thinks about this.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i don't know. i was pretty terrified anyway but the fear i felt on the run up to the choking did seem, you know, unusual.}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<P>__{(pleased)}
<D>__{you know why? it wasn't you. it was me. i was inside your head. fighting with the mind.}
<A>__{suddenly the door opens and one of the young iraqis comes in, smiling.}
<C>__{younger iraqi}
<D>__{okay. we go.}
