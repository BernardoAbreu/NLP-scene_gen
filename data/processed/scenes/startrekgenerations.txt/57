<A>__{a short time later. a romulan tricorder is connected to some diagnostic equipment near a console. worf is talking to riker. worf activates a monitor which shows a complex diagram of sensor information.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{one of the dead romulans had a tricorder. we analyzed its sensor logs and found they were scanning for signature particles of a compound called trilithium.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{trilithium?}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{an experimental compound the romulans have been working on. in theory, a trilithium based explosive would be thousands of times more powerful than an anti matter weapon. but they never found a way to stabilize it.}
<C>__{riker}
<D>__{why were they looking for it on a federation observatory? it doesn't make any sense.}
<A>__{riker considers.}
<C>__{riker}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{have geordi and data go over with the next away team... tell them to scan the observatory for trilithium.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{aye, sir.}
