<L>__{exterior 2nd floor balcony day}
<A>__{nell stands at the railing of a stone balcony on the house's second floor. the air stirs her hair. she peers up at the house's roofline, its clusters of misplaced windows and other features like so many screaming heads. chilled, she pulls her sweater closer. marrow comes out onto the balcony from twin french doors behind her.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{are you coming to confess?}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{i wish i were. i wish i had done it, then i could confess and you'd be at peace. that great moral philosopher frank sinatra once said to someone he loved, i wish you had an enemy, so i could beat him up.}
<A>__{she smiles.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{let's say it wasn't you. who did it?}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{it was a stupid thing to do.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{it was.}
<C>__{nell}
<P>__{(for the absurdity of the idea)}
<D>__{welcome home.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{you'll never see it again. mr. dudley's taking care of it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, nell. can i show you something you'd like to see?}
<C>__{nell}
<P>__{(still too shaky for enthusiasm)}
<D>__{sure.}
