<L>__{interior hospital room day}
<A>__{kyle enters, having heard kirsty crying. she is sitting with her legs over the side of the bed with her face in her hands. kyle immediately sits next to her and puts an arm around her shoulder. he doesn't force her to speak. he lets her let the tears out. finally, she looks up.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{i...i had a visitor.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{oh, jesus. i can't explain. it's ...it's. i don't know how to help! i have to save him and i don't know how to help!}
<C>__{kyle}
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{kirsty, i'm sorry... don't understand. i...}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{i know. no one can. but i have to save him. where's the other doctor? he said he'd listen. he promised.}
<A>__{kyle responds quickly to this. his faith in malahide is strong, despite that curious incident of the previous night when malahide followed ronson out of the room.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{dr. malahide. yes. look, i will fetch him. you take it easy. i'm sure he can help.}
<A>__{kyle stands up, making soothing motions with his hands, and heads for the door.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{help. no, no one can help. i just want someone to listen or i will go crazy.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{if anyone can help, he can.}
<A>__{kirsty turns and gives kyle a strange look as he opens the door.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{yeah? he got a ticket to hell?}
