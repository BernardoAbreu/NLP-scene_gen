<L>__{interior interrogation room day}
<A>__{detective ybarra is sitting on one side of a table, a notepad in front of him, staring across at "walter," who isn't very happy right now, and is staring back with substantial venom. his true, nasty personality is free to come out at last. there's a long beat, then:}
<D>__{"walter" i want a glass of water.}
<C>__{ybarra}
<D>__{tough. "walter"}
<P>__{(mocking)}
<D>__{"tough!"}
<C>__{ybarra}
<D>__{what's your name? "walter" walter collins.}
<C>__{ybarra}
<D>__{walter collins is dead. "walter"}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{i didn't do it.}
<A>__{changeling a true story}
<C>__{ybarra}
<D>__{look, let me explain something to you. because of your lies, you've ruined a woman's life embarrassed the police department, and got the whole city up in arms over this.}
<A>__{"walter" considers this for a beat, then smiles.}
<D>__{"walter" got a lot done, didn't i?}
<A>__{ybarra exchanges a look with the matron, then closes up his notepad.}
<C>__{ybarra}
<D>__{all right, if that's how you want it, then i guess we're done here.}
<P>__{(to matron)}
<D>__{tell county jail we're remanding him for trial. "walter" wait...what's remanding? what trial?}
<C>__{ybarra}
<D>__{i told you, the real walter collins was murdered. "walter" so? i didn't do anything! i wasn't even here when it happened!}
<C>__{ybarra}
<D>__{by pretending to be walter collins, you're interfering in a police investigation of a kidnapping and murder. we can try you as an accomplice to murder after the fact.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{too bad. county jail is a lot worse than juvenile hall or a foster home. a lot worse. "walter" you can't do that...i'm just a kid!}
<C>__{ybarra}
<D>__{sanford clark is a kid, too. fifteen. but he's going to jail. all murderers and their accomplices go to jail. everyone knows that.}
<P>__{(to the matron)}
<D>__{get him out of here. it's out of my hands now.}
<A>__{changeling a true story he heads for the door when "walter" cries out, scared.}
<D>__{"walter" wait! i don't want to go to jail.}
<C>__{ybarra}
<D>__{prove it.}
<A>__{and on the boy's face, we hear:}
<C>__{ybarra }
<D>__{arthur hutchins.}
