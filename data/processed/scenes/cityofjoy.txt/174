<L>__{exterior narrow lane near city of joy day}
<A>__{amrita, subash, and shambu heading home from the work shop. shambu's cast is gone. subash flirts with amrita. they see hasari, max, and manooj coming toward them. manooj runs to them, shouting that he's going to the school; amrita, subash, shambu congratulate him...}
<B>__{hasari and max}
<A>__{suddenly the rickshaw wheels jam. they turn to find two men, one of whom has slammed a stick into hasari's spokes. retribution, it would seem, has arrived. the kids stop, huddle instinctively together in fear. our policeman disappears into a doorway as shutters close up and down this little street. there are thugs at both ends. no one else is visible on the street. the two men stare at hasari a moment, smiling. then one gets into the rickshaw, crosses his legs as if he might want transport. but now he whips out a narrow bladed knife, and still staring at hasari, begins to slice up the newly covered seats of the rickshaw. max looks around, trying to cool things.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{hey, come on, don't do this.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{well, what's the problem here?}
<A>__{they turn, ashoka. behind him, the goonda.}
<C>__{ashoka}
<D>__{you've become very brave of late, haven't you?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{don't do this.}
<C>__{ashoka}
<D>__{oh, i do what i please. you see, my father's dead, i'm in charge now. so you will get off my streets, you will leave my country, and that clinic and school will close.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{ashoka}
<D>__{my father was weak. he let you and your european friend give these little people ideas. it's over.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you can't do this!}
<A>__{he takes no more than a step at ashoka, a hand coming up, when he's hit hard from behind. goes to his knees.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{jesus christ.}
<A>__{his hand comes away from the back of his head with blood. he tries to rise and is hit again.}
<C>__{hasari}
<P>__{(to the kids)}
<D>__{get back! stay back!}
<C>__{ashoka}
<D>__{no, no, come forward. come.}
<A>__{ashoka glides toward the petrified amrita. the goonda remains unmoving, watchful. ashoka puts out his hand with its rings, and strokes amrita's cheek.}
<C>__{ashoka}
<D>__{what a little woman already, hey?}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{please, don't touch her, babu.}
<C>__{ashoka}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{i said, please, don't touch her.}
<A>__{hasari glances over his shoulder, his eyes bouncing off the goonda's impassive face. now, the knife comes out of ashoka's pocket, snaps open, glints in the light.}
<C>__{ashoka}
<D>__{she's going to give someone a lot of enjoyment. yes.}
<A>__{there's a moment of unbearable tension as everyone, in cluding the goonda, realizes this man is out of control.}
<C>__{ashoka}
<P>__{(to the goonda)}
<D>__{he said 'please' didn't he? 'please, don't touch her?'}
<A>__{the goonda stares at ashoka... and now ashoka reaches out and we follow close on his hand as it moves ever so slowly through space to settle on amrita's breast. and now hasari explodes. he hits ashoka. a hard punch to the chest. ashoka stumbles and falls to one knee. the two thugs make a move to come to his rescue... but a curious thing stops them: the goonda's arm, outstretched across their path, his eyes alerting them not to proceed. max lurches to his feet unsteadily.}
<C>__{ashoka}
<D>__{bhose, help me!}
<A>__{hasari unloads a punch into ashoka's face; ashoka's nose pours blood; he starts to whimper. he clutches hasari hard to him. holds him. hasari struggles, slams his palm into ashoka's chin, sending ashoka to the ground, sending the knife skidding across the ground. hasari grabs the knife, straddles ashoka, about to kill. but he can't do it.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{life is hard enough. no more. leave us alone.}
<A>__{hasari backs off, leans against a wall, stares down at ashoka, his hands in tight against his body. manooj and shambu stare at their father in awe. shambu sees something on the ground where the first blow was delivered to ashoka's chest. everyone has moved slightly to one side. he bends and closes his fist around something. the goonda steps between ashoka and max and hasari.}
<C>__{goonda}
<D>__{you won't be bothered again.}
<A>__{a look from the goonda and the thugs vanish, leaving ashoka cowering in a doorway on his knees. shutters start to open, people begin to appear again in doorways and windows. fearing for his life, ashoka suddenly bolts. max is fixed on hasari. he lets up a scream of exulta tion, his hand going out for a "five" from hasari. the kids charge toward hasari. then everyone freezes. hasari lists to his right side and blood starts to pour from the knife wound in his abdomen under his pressing arm.}
