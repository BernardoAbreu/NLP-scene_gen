<L>__{interior church night}
<A>__{beck enters to find stauffenberg in the front pew, staring at christ on the cross.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{have you made your peace with god, then?}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{as best i can.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{then you have nothing to fear.}
<A>__{stauffenberg manages a smile as beck sits.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{i know the soldier inside me is a traitor. i wonder how i will be judged as a man.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{by history?}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{by god.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{in the end, we answer only to ourselves.}
<A>__{stauffenberg fingers the cross and ring hanging from the chain around his neck.}
<C>__{beck }
<D>__{did you reach your wife?}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{bombing in ebingen. i can't get through.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{ebingen is a long way from bamberg. they're safe. you've seen to that.}
<P>__{(realizing...)}
<D>__{to think... you came to us a wounded soldier from africa. now... now you are both the architect and the assassin. i'm still trying to understand how this came to be.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<P>__{(more to himself)}
<D>__{like a farmer watching the corn grow. one day it's over his head...}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{nothing...}
<A>__{and the two men look up at the cross in silence.}
