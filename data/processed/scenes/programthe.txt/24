<L>__{interior examination room morning}
<A>__{twenty freshman football players, including darnell, are scattered at tables around the room, writing furiously in test booklets, as a proctor paces the room. darnell starts to write an answer, stops, stumped. worried, he looks at the clock, goes on to the next page.}
<L>__{exterior e.s.u. campus morning}
<A>__{darnell and joe walk across campus. darnell carries a gleaming, chromed trophy with a football player on top. he's still thinking about the test.}

<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{i will see ya at the meeting.}
<P>__{(handing him the trophy)}
<D>__{take this for me, will ya?}
<A>__{joe starts to protest, but darnell is already off, racing across the quad, quickly catching up with autumn.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{hey, autumn, hold up! what're you doing here? i thought students didn't come back for two weeks.}
<C>__{autumn}
<P>__{(rather coolly)}
<D>__{i came back early to see a friend.}
<C>__{darnel}
<D>__{you're looking fresh, autumn. a package of pulchritudiness. what about getting together later tonight? maybe get a pizza? they got pizza in this town don't they?}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{i can't tonight.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{how about tomorrow night?}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{i don't think it's a real good idea for us to see each other, darnell.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{what's the matter? i'm not good enough for you all of a sudden? too young, is that it? i'm not, ya know. they held me back a year.}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{no, it's not that... i've got a boyfriend.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{did you have this boyfriend when you showed me around?}
<C>__{autumn}
<P>__{(reluctant to admit it)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{yeah, well, it didn't seem to bother you then. i'm willing to overlook it now.}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{i was mad at him.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{i caught him with another girl. a white girl.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{and you're still with this nigger?}
<A>__{she nods, slightly embarrassed.}
<C>__{autumn}
<D>__{look, i got to get going, darnell. i'm sorry. i didn't mean to lead you on. i'm glad you came here.}
<A>__{she starts walking away.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{wait a minute. i can at least walk with you, can't i? nothin' wrong with that.}
<A>__{she speeds up. he speeds up.}

<C>__{ray}
<D>__{hey, autumn }
<A>__{this is exactly what autumn didn't want to happen. ray and darnell eye each other like a couple of roosters.}
<C>__{autumn}

<D>__{starting tailback.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{i know. that's why they recruited me.}
<A>__{autumn can't believe he said this. she starts to interject something to break the tension, but never gets the chance.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{the two guys they recruited before you are handing out gatorade now.}
<P>__{(making the jerkoff motion)}
<D>__{better start strengthening your wrist.}
<C>__{darnell}
<D>__{we'll see.}
<P>__{(departing, to ray)}
<D>__{give my best to miss lilly.}
<A>__{autumn's mortification is complete.}
