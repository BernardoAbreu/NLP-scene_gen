<L>__{exterior landing day}
<A>__{a catwalk branches off, a set of stairs continuing down the along the canyon wall. grant starts down the stairs. he's only taken a few steps down the rusty staircase suddenly}
<B>__{breaks beneath his feet.}
<A>__{paul grabs him in the nick of time. the staircase vanish into the fog. clanfing against the canyon wall. after a few more seconds of silence, they hear the crash far below.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{grant nods and looks in the other direction.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{how about if we try this way?}
<A>__{their only other option is a precarious catwalk that disappears into the mist.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{do you think it goes all the way across?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{one way to find out.}
<A>__{the only way to get his near fall is to push ahead. but his stomach turns at being so high. amanda follows. the catwalk creaks and groans, listing slightly. she freezes mid stride.}
<C>__{grant }
<P>__{(glancing back)}
<D>__{we'd better do this one at a time.}
<A>__{amanda steps of and grant carefully pushes forward, disappearing into the thick fog. the others listen to the creaking of the catwalk until it stops}
<B>__{abriptly. silence.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{dr. grant?}
<A>__{more silence. then, out of the fog, a distant voice call out }
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{come on over. one at a time.}
<A>__{amanda steps tentatively forwards. eric is clinging to her.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{eric, its okay. you'll be right behind me.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{we're not going anywhere, i promise.}
<A>__{as paul holds eric, and amanda shares a look.}
<D>__{amanda we're all together now, eric.}
<A>__{eric reluctantly releases her mother. amanda starts to cross.}
