<L>__{interior examination room day}
<A>__{doc lardner is checking pete's eyes. pete sits on an examination table, his shirt off, his head freshly bandaged. stanton lurks in the corner, maggie curled at his feet.}
<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{he was passed out cold. maggie woke 'im.}
<C>__{lardner}
<D>__{uh huh. he looks familiar.}
<P>__{(to pete)}
<D>__{open your mouth. say "ah."}
<A>__{pete does. lardner has a look as stanton pulls out a pocket watch.}
<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{said as much myself, doc. can't place him, though. to look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker.}
<P>__{(looks at his watch)}
<D>__{well, morning's half over. i'm off.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{thank you, mr. lawson.}
<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{don't mention it. whoever you are.}
<A>__{stanton and maggie exit. lardner checks pete's ears.}
<C>__{lardner}
<D>__{any idea how you got here, son?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<A>__{lardner sniffs him.}
<C>__{lardner}
<D>__{been drinkin' a bit, have we?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i don't remember. i guess so. smells like it.}
<P>__{(smacks his lips and frowns)}
<D>__{tastes like it.}
<C>__{lardner}
<D>__{well, you've been wet to the skin. you must've fallen in.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i guess i did.}
<C>__{lardner}
<D>__{lucky you got out, that water's got quite a pull, and it empties straight into the ocean.}
<A>__{lardner takes a shirt off his counter and hands it to pete.}
<C>__{lardner}
<D>__{here, one of mine.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{pete puts on the shirt.}
<C>__{lardner}
<D>__{do you remember if you were driving a car? maybe you went over the bridge. no guard rail there, it's easy to do. it's happened before.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{it's possible. i just don't remember.}
<C>__{lardner}
<D>__{and you don't know your name or who you are, that right?}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{i... no, i... i just can't...}
<C>__{lardner}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{it's okay, son. we just need to call you something. that's all.}
<A>__{pete stifles a laugh.}
<C>__{lardner}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{call me... ishmael?}
<C>__{lardner}
<D>__{well, at least you remember "moby dick."}
