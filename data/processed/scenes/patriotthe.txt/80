<A>__{marion and scott shove their chisels through the door which falls away from the hinges. they all duck inside finding barrels and casks of gunpowder, boxes of weapons and hundreds of muskets. gabriel and the others load themselves up with the best of the weapons as marion opens a cask and pours a trail of gunpowder across the floor.}

<D>__{oh, you poor man...}

<D>__{these rebels seem to lack fear as well as decency, eh, general?}

<D>__{colonel tarleton, you deal with these damned rebels.}
<C>__{tarleton}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{tarleton smiles grimly and strides off the balcony.}
