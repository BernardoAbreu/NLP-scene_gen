<L>__{exterior bleeker house day}
<A>__{juno bikes up to find bleeker sitting on the stoop. she smiles and takes out her guitar. she sits across from bleeker and pulls the pick out of the strings.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{ready?}
<A>__{bleeker nods. juno begins strumming her guitar and playing "anyone else but you," by the moldy peaches. bleeker joins in. at first their playing is discordant, but suddenly it works.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{you're a part time lover and a fulltime friend. the monkey on your back is the latest trend. i don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{here is the church and here is the steeple. we sure are cute for two ugly people. i don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{we both have shiny happy fits of rage. you want more fans, i want more stage. i don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{you are always trying to keep it real. i'm in love with how you feel. i don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.}
<C>__{bleeker}
<D>__{i kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train. i kiss you all starryeyed, my body's swinging from side to side. i don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{the pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me. so why can't you forgive me? i don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.}
<C>__{juno and bleeker together}
<D>__{du du du du du du dudu. du du du du du du dudu. i don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else but you.}
<A>__{she and bleeker exchange glances as they play. they smile ambiguously. juno leans over and kisses bleeker on the cheek. pull out to reveal the surrounding green suburb buzzing with life and summer activity.}
