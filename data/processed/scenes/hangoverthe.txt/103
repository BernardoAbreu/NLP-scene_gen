<D>__{yep, just driving out to the middle of desert to meet some mobsters, what could possibly go wrong...?}
<A>__{the guys all frown.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{so what's our plan?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{i think we should tell mr. lang that we couldn't get the money, but that, if he's amenable, we could create a payment calendar }
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{we're gonna give jimmy a dummy bag of money, grab doug, and make a run for it.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{yes, good! what an airtight plan !}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{jimmy lang doesn't do payment calendars, alan! trust me: this is our only shot of getting doug back! left turn!}
