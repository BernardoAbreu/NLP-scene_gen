<L>__{interior "tonight show" stage day moments later}
<A>__{abby now sits in the audience, watching as jay interviews mike on stage.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{so what's your number one piece of advice to all the people out there who are trying to find love?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{don't do it. try to find lust instead. it's a lot easier and a lot less messy. blue balls only last a few hours. a broken heart can last years.}
<A>__{the audience reacts with hollers and cheers. abby shakes her head.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{so, what's her name?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{the girl who screwed you up. she must have been a doozy.}
<A>__{mike looks a bit taken aback, but recovers quickly.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{like i said, better a floozy than a doozy.}
<A>__{abby cocks her head, intrigued by mike's reaction.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{well, what do you say to guys like me who have been happily married for twenty seven years? we can't be the exception to the rule, can we? there's plenty of us out there.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{well, jay, let me tell ya }
<A>__{he hesitates, then looks at abby for a moment. she gives him an encouraging nod. he gains confidence, and continues.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{marriage starts off great. she's cute, you're cute, the world's cute. nothing can burst your bubble of everlasting love.}
<C>__{mike }
<D>__{then, ten years later, she's put on twenty pounds, you've got nose hair, you're voting for different presidents, and one day, the receptionist at jiffy lube accidentally grazes your hand as she hands you back your keys and you realize that's the first time a woman's touched you in three months. by year twenty, you've learned to completely tune out the sound of her voice and it occurs to you that ever since you walked down the aisle, you're living with someone who can barely tolerate your presence and, on the rare occasion that you actually do make love, she probably thinks about jake gyllenhaal.}
<A>__{jay looks stricken, going along with the bit.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{you're right. i'm going to get a divorce. my whole life is a lie.}
<P>__{(to camera)}
<D>__{sorry, honey.}
<A>__{the audience laughs, as we cut to : }
