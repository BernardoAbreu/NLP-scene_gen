<L>__{exterior first street and main street day}
<A>__{racine makes his way up first to the corner of main and crosses diagonally to his building on main. he is well known here, greeted through glass by many of the shop owners. the heat dominates much of the pantomimed conversation. racine goes in a doorway and heads up the stairs to his office.}
<L>__{interior racine's office day}
<A>__{racine's secretary, beverly, is behind the desk in the modest reception room. she's a pretty girl barely past twenty. she pushes some phone message slips toward racine and nods toward the sofa. a middle aged woman client, mrs. singer, sits there clutching a walking stick. her face suddenly is contorted in pain. racine glances meaningfully at beverly then turns his full solicitous charm on mrs. singer.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{mrs. singer, i would have gladly come to the house.}
<A>__{he helps her up and leads her slowly to his office.}
<C>__{mrs. singer}
<D>__{no. no, the doctor says i should walk and i had some shopping. not that that quack knows what he's talking about. i tell you, mr. racine, i'm not sure his testimony is going to be very useful.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{don't worry about it. i will find you a doctor who's more understanding. is it bad today?}
<C>__{mrs. singer}
<D>__{oooh, you can't imagine. nothing can make up for the pain they've caused me.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{how well i know. we'll sue those reckless bastards dry. excuse my language. converted to pdf by www.screentalk.org}
<A>__{as mrs. singer disappears into the office, racine flashes a grin at beverly.}
<C>__{mrs. singer}
<D>__{don't apologize. that's the kind of attitude you've got to have these days...}
