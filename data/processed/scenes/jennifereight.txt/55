<L>__{55: interior interrogation room. police station. day.}
<A>__{the polygraph machine looks like state of the art. a table and two chairs. berlin takes one and sits opposite emerson. she at tempts a smile but he kills it with the intensity of his stare.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{my name's sergeant john berlin.}
<A>__{and the time is his. he knows what he's doing. and she doesn't.}
<D>__{i been a policeman 17 years: 16 years 9 months of which with the l.a.p.d. i witnessed literally hundreds of lie detector tests, and i never seen one like this?}
<C>__{emerson}
<D>__{what d'ya mean, sergeant?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{well, look at it. look at this line? that's the important one. dead straight down the page. no body gets a dead straight down the page. even our expert says a dead straight's "exceptional."}
<A>__{all he's doing is telling her truth. up to her to interpret it.}
<D>__{thought you might wanna comment?}
<A>__{a tongue slides through the lipstick like something being born.}
<C>__{emerson}
<D>__{i wasn't actually lying, officer.}
<A>__{and suddenly the only thing holding her chops up is max factor. he's got her on the roll now and all it needs is one more push.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{you busted the box, lady! you flunk ed it .. you lied about things you didn't need to lie about .. the only truthful statement you made's your name .. your name is carol emerson?}
<A>__{the quivering lip and flooding eyes amalgamate into a horrible sort of groan. she's bellied up and anxious to spill her beans. berlin better get through the door fast because he might laugh.}
<D>__{you tell one more lie, you're go ing in a cell. sergeant ross is coming in to take your statement.}
