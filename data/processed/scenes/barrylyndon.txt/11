<A>__{the guests leaving and saying their goodbyes.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{at last, and at morning, the ball was over.}
<L>__{exterior road dawn}
<A>__{dorothy and roderick on horseback together.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{sure it's a bitter night, roderick dear, and you'll catch cold without a handkerchief to your neck.}
<A>__{to this sympathetic remark, from the pillion, the saddle made no reply.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{did you and miss clancy have a pleasant evening, roderick? you were together, i saw, all night.}
<A>__{to this, the saddle only replies by grinding his teeth, and giving a lash to daisy.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{oh! mercy, you make daisy rear and throw me, you careless creature, you.}
<A>__{the pillion had by this got her arm around the saddle's waist, and gave it the gentlest squeeze in the world.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{i hate miss clancy, you know i do! and i only danced with her because because the person with whom i intended to dance chose to be engaged the whole night.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{i had not been in the room five minutes before i was engaged for every single set.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{were you obliged to dance five times with captain best, and then stroll out with him into the garden?}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{i don't care a fig for captain best; he dances prettily to be sure, and is a pleasant rattle of a man. he looks well in his regimentals, too; and if he chose to ask me to dance, how could i refuse him?}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{but you refused me, dorothy.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{oh! i can dance with you any day, and to dance with your own cousin at a ball as if you could find no other partner. besides, roderick, captain best's a man, and you are only a boy, and you haven't a guinea in the world.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{if ever i meet him again, you shall see which is the best man of the two. i will fight him with sword or with pistol, captain as he is.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{but captain best is already known as a valiant soldier, and is famous as a man of fashion in london. it is mighty well of you to fight farmers' boys, but to fight an englishman is a very different matter.}
<A>__{roderick falls silent.}
