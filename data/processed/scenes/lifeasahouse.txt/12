<L>__{exterior george nelson's cul de sac morning}
<A>__{george's dog, guster, is doing his business on the lawn of a modern day robber baron, david dokos, who exits his house with a briefcase. he hops into his mercedes and proceeds to chase guster straight across his well manicured grass. guster easily escapes death and runs off. george walks out of his shack as david hops the curb, flips him off and drives away. george waves goodbye.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{stick it up your ass! have a nice day.}
<P>__{(glancing around)}
<D>__{guster!}
<A>__{guster runs to his side as colleen rushes out of her house.}
<C>__{colleen}
<D>__{this has got to stop!}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{he escaped. he's going back in.}
<C>__{colleen}
<D>__{does it give you some sort of perverse pleasure to expose your...penis in plain view of my sixteen year old daughter?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{there are no windows facing my...exposure.}
<C>__{colleen}
<D>__{george, this is the third time.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{the plumber's due out on friday.}
<C>__{colleen}
<D>__{you'll have to explain that to the police.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you were the only neighbor i could tolerate.}
<C>__{colleen}
<D>__{i did warn you.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{my life is a warning. i just can't figure out for what.}
<A>__{colleen shies away from george's stare; he finally turns and walks toward the house but stops short as he turns back.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{colleen, how hard was it for you to get your head outside that window far enough to see my dick?}
<A>__{this stops colleen for a moment; it was difficult. george walks back to the cottage and locks guster in before stepping into an old ford truck and driving off. colleen watches him drive off, then turns to her house and stares.}
