<L>__{interior charlie's bedroom day}
<A>__{charlie paces the room, his brow furrowed with concern, carrying the phone as he talks in low urgent tones. in the living room lansky, costello, and siegel sit around the coffee table, still in the clothes they wore for the hijack. the contents of the bar are scattered across the coffee table, indicating serious drinking in progress. costello glowers at siegel, as bugsy uses his bandaged right hand to pour a fresh measure of scotch.}
<C>__{siegel}
<D>__{i got a booger hangin' out my nose, paisan? cause if i don't, i suggest you step over to the fuckin' mirror and take a look.}
<A>__{costello doesn't respond, but maintains his accusing gaze.}
<C>__{lansky}
<D>__{come off it, bugs.}
<C>__{siegel}
<P>__{(mocking)}
<D>__{come off it, bugs.}
<C>__{lansky}
<D>__{ben jamin.}
<A>__{bugsy grabs the whiskey bottle, shatters it across the edge of the table, and holds the jagged edge to his opposite wrist.}
<C>__{siegel}
<D>__{is it blood ya want?}
<A>__{siegel jams his wrist against the jagged edge, sparking a trickle of blood. he holds his wrist over the table, letting the blood drip into an empty glass. he "milks" his arm to increase the flow of blood.}
<C>__{siegel}
<D>__{tell me when ya got enough.}
<A>__{lansky shakes his head in disgust.}
<C>__{lansky}
<D>__{there's nothin' in this world crazier than a crazy fuckin' jew.}
<A>__{a white shirt flies into siegel's face. charlie stands to one side, bare chested.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{wrap it.}
<A>__{bugsy's bravado collapses in the face of charlie's bloodless calm. he wraps his arm. luciano lowers himself into a chair.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{johnson's still on board. even maranzano won't screw with nucky in atlantic city. but everywhere else, we got nothing but problems.}
<C>__{siegel}
<D>__{i will knock 'em in, charlie. i can do it. blow his fuckin' head off. get rid of the bastard for good.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{you wouldn't live out the week.}
<C>__{lansky}
<D>__{we got exactly two choices, maranzano or masseria.}
<C>__{siegel}
<D>__{they don't give a shit about us!}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{masseria's scared. he might make our deal.}
<C>__{siegel}
<D>__{we can't sell out to those guys. they ain't businessmen!}
<A>__{but nobody pays the slightest attention to bugsy's protests.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{but maranzano's got the men and the brains.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{which is why he doesn't need us.}
<A>__{frustrated at being ignored, bugsy shouts.}
<C>__{siegel}
<D>__{all they care about is killing the nephew of some guy who screwed their grandmother fifty years ago!}
<A>__{charlie continues in a calm, contained voice. bugsy crosses his arms across his chest and sulks.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{at least masseria plays by the rules. maranzano thinks he's god, and the rules don't apply.}
<C>__{lansky}
<D>__{without us, masseria don't stand a chance, and he knows it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i'm sorry, but i sleep better when i know i'm with the winning side.}
<C>__{lansky}
<D>__{we're gonna be the winning side. it's like rothstein said about that guy in austria. we're gonna use maranzano and masseria. let 'em knock each other bloody. and then, when everybody's screamin' for peace, we step in to make it. what they're fight in' over, everybody will beg us to take.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i thought we just wanted to be left alone to run our business.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{it's past that. we take over the whole show, or we're all dead.}
<A>__{bugsy perks up.}
<C>__{siegel}
<D>__{so we're gonna knock 'em both off?}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{if it comes to that. yeah.}
<A>__{bugsy breaks into a broad grin.}
<C>__{siegel}
<D>__{well, shit. why the fuck ya didn't come right out and say so!}
