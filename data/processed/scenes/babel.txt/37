<D>__{ahmed and yussef run full speed, herding their goats as they go. some of them get left behind and yussef hurries back to them. as they climb a hill, he slips and falls, rolls downhill and drops the rifle, which slides a few meters away. ahmed runs to help him. yussef gets up, covered in dust and with a scratch on his forehead. ahmed picks up the rifle.}
