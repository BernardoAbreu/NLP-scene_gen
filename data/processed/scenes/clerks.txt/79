<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{ext: convenience store. day}
<A>__{the sign on the door reads:}
<B>__{temporarily closed. be open after first period.}
<A>__{the players ascend a ladder adjacent to the door, one by one. on the roof they jump off the ladder and skate around. more players join them. from across the street we get the full, odd perspective: a store with many men gliding around on the roof. on the roof dante skates and passes with another player. redding stretches, leaning against the sign. randal pulls his mask on and slaps his glove, urging a shot. sanford skates in and takes a shot, which randal blocks. jay and silent bob deal to a player: he drops money over the ledge and jay throws up a dime bag. dante holds a ball in the center of the court.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{ready?}
<A>__{players take positions. sanford comes to the center and holds the ball in drop position. dante and redding face off, and the ball is in play. the game begins as the players engage in a savage ballet. faces are smashed with sticks, slide tackles are made, shots are taken, cu's of various players included. inactive players call out encouragement and slander from the sidelines. more game playing including both goalies getting scored on and more face offs. below, a customer tugs on the convenience store door. he reads the sign and then backs up into the street, attempting to peer over the ledge. above, the game continues. below, the customer shifts from one foot to the other impatiently. he grabs the ladder and quickly ascends. above, from over the ledge of the roof, we see the head of the customer peek. skating feet pass rapidly before him, and he watches for a moment before calling out.}

<D>__{that's easy to say from over here.}
<C>__{customer }
<D>__{give me a stick, pretty boy! i will knock your fucking teeth out and pass all over your ass.}

<C>__{woman}
<D>__{is the convenience store open?}

<P>__{(to customer)}
<D>__{there's a stick over there. you're shooting against the goal.}
<P>__{(to the court)}
<D>__{redding! come off and let this fuck on!}
<A>__{a new face off pits dante against the customer. the ball drops between the two and dante gets flattened. the customer winds up and takes a hard shot. the ball sails off the court, through the air, and into a faraway yard. dante calls to the sidelines.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{give me another ball.}
<C>__{someone }
<D>__{there are no more.}
<C>__{dante}
