<B>__{the neverwhere pyramid}
<A>__{the camera pans down the stone statue to the glowing sphere, which lies abandoned on the ground. the soldiers are gone. as we watch, time begins to accelerate and the neverwhere pyramid ages and crumbles all around the green ball. the earth heaves and shifts, and dense vegetarian grows up through the cracks in the ground. a prehistoric man walks up and sees the glowing ball under a fern. fascinated, he picks it up and looks at it, as the foot of a tyrannosaurus rex comes down, crushing him. time advances again as the dinosaur becomes a skeleton, and a biblical tent community grows up around the ball. in the fire light, the nomadic tribesmen are watering their animals, when one of the camels paws at the ground, uncovering the glowing ball. scared, the camel struggles and trys to break its ropes. out of nowhere a roman legion attacks, slaughtering the tribesmen. time accelerates again, and the conquering romans build a temple, placing the green ball in the head of a golden idol. then the romans grow fat and debauched, while slave girls feed them grapes. as the ball glows, the temple crashes down around the debauched romans, covering them and the green ball in rubble. over the ruins of the temple, a succession of primitive mud and clay huts evolve into the thatched roof cottages of a medieval village. a medieval stone cutter finds the ball, and mortars it in with his stones as he builds a water well in the centre of the village. satisfied with his work, he lowers the bucket to draw himself a drink. behind him, an ox cart comes roaring around a corner. the axle breaks and a heavy wooden wheel careens along, striking the stone cutter in the back and knocking him into the well. time advances once more as the medieval village grows and transforms into a victorian style town. it is evening, and the stone well now sits under a gazebo at the centre of a gas lit village green. a fancy carriage carrying a victorian gentleman passes by and circles the green. moving in through a window across the street, we see a seductive looking woman dressing herself in black garters and lace. this is intercut with the carriage circling the green, until the woman, who looks like a high class harlot, finishes dressing and leaves her room. crossing the street, she walks up to the gazebo and leans provocatively up against the well. the gentleman gets out of his carriage, approaches the woman and propositions her. she smiles, touches, and teases him. we pan down their legs to the green ball glowing in the well wall. suddenly red blood begins to drip over the ball, and the woman's body falls to the ground. the camera pans up to the well bucket, where the gentleman is washing the blood from his hands. as time begins to move forward again, the man ages and hobbles away, as the well crumbles and cheap turn of the century row housing grows up, covering the green ball. the town becomes dirtier and blacker, and smokestacks blow soot into the morning sky. almost on cue, the doors of the houses open, and grim coal miners emerge, shuffling through the filthy streets on their way to work. the camera pans down to a drain in the gutter. a rat appears. panning back up, the street is now empty. a bell is heard ringing, and a horse drawn red cross cart pulls around a corner and into view. masked workers follow the cart. one rings the bell, while the others pull corpses from the doorways and load them into the cart. the gutters and windowsills are now full of rats. time advances again and the buildings become deserted derelicts. their decaying timbers groan under the weight. a support snaps, and one of the buildings starts to collapse. falling amidst the crumbling plaster and rotting wood is the glowing green ball. as the ball hits the ground, it is covered over by rubble. the rubble becomes bleached by the hot sun and the landscape grows drier. sand blows all around, covering over everything. as the sandstorm clears, the entire terrain is nothing but desert. in the distance we can see a group of people walking.}
