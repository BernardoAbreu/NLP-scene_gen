<B>__{richard travers}
<A>__{mid thirties, a tough, imposing treasury agent he regards the fortune piling up in front of him with only cold, professional interest. travers is flanked by a trio of equally tough treasury agents he turns to flunky davis (20s). it's clear who's in charge of protecting the money here, and who's in charge of counting it.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{tell wright the san francisco shipment is ready.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(phone already out)}
<D>__{right away, mr. travers.}

<A>__{of walter wright (50s), comptroller of currency his demeanor suggests he's in control, and used to keeping it that way.}
<C>__{wright}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{good good. i will be right down.}
<A>__{as wright gets up from his desk, though, we hear in the outer office }
<C>__{secretary }
<D>__{you can't go in there }

<A>__{printing compound the money has now been packed into a trio of metal briefcases ten thousand $5,000 bills. travers shuts the cases in turn, and locks each with an electronic key card, triggering a flashing red light on the locks as he does. a uniformed pilot shows up behind travers as he cuffs the cases to the hands of the three other agents.}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{we'll be fueled and ready in ten minutes, mr. travers.}
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(an order)}
<D>__{be ready in five.}
<C>__{matheson }
<D>__{go ahead and take ten. we'll need the time.}
<A>__{travers looks up at matheson, who has just arrived with wright. travers is instantly furious at the challenge to his authority.}

<P>__{(flashes badge)}
<D>__{matheson. fbi.}
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(looking down at it)}
<D>__{your parents must be proud.}
<P>__{(to wright)}
<D>__{what the fuck is this about?}
<C>__{wright}
<D>__{small problem with the shipment, travers.}
<P>__{(to matheson)}
<D>__{tell him what you just told me.}
<A>__{matheson draws out a file and hands it to travers.}
<C>__{matheson}
<D>__{we got word that somebody's been observing your currency shipments this load, the $5,000s over the last three deliveries.}
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{there isn't a hell of a lot anyone can do but observe.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{this is the most protected shipment we've got and the most useless for a thief. those bills aren't in circulation. you think five thousand dollar bills are easy to pass? who the fuck would try?}
<A>__{matheson hands travers a folder.}
<C>__{matheson}
<D>__{this guy might.}
<A>__{we look over travers' shoulder at the photos, which are all blurry, all blown up from different surveillance pictures and all of them show eric qualen.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{who is he?}
<C>__{mathers}
<P>__{(patient)}
<D>__{his name's eric qualen. one of the east german spies who got shut out by the reunification. the cia issued an inter agency warning about him right after the wall came down. he's got nowhere to go and nothing to lose. he's also got the international connections to get rid of bills like these and he's probably desperate enough to try for them. fifty million bucks buys a lot of sanctuary.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{could you get to the part where i'm supposed to care?}
<C>__{matheson}
<P>__{(shows him more photos)}
<D>__{we had two agents monitoring him. these two gleason and quinones. their last report said he was going to try to take this shipment.}
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(turning away)}
<D>__{thanks for the tip. but i've got work to do.}
<C>__{matheson}
<P>__{(stopping him)}
<D>__{did i say "last" report? i think i did. i mean last fucking report. these guys have vanished.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{you have my sympathy, but }
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{there's a reason we do things this way, all right? armored cars can be hijacked. trains can be derailed. but nobody can get to us in flight. the only time this is on the ground is at the mint, or on the presidio runway in san francisco. either way, someone would have to shoot his way past a couple of thousand guards.}
<A>__{matheson still isn't convinced.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{if you're worried about an inside job, forget it. i checked the plane from top to bottom an hour ago. and these three are my best against. even if one of them did go skydiving, they wouldn't get far. each case has an electronic tracer with a range of one hundred miles.}
<A>__{travers pulls a tracking device about the size of a watchman out of his jacket pocket. the small screen shows three red blips at rest matching the three currency cases.}
<C>__{travers}
<P>__{(facing down matheson)}
<D>__{i haven't lost a bill in eight years. and i'm not scrubbing this shipment because you scare easily.}
<C>__{matheson}
<P>__{(an easy smile)}
<D>__{who said anything about stopping the shipment?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i've been tracking qualen for almost a year. if he pulls something, i want to be in on the party.}
<A>__{travers, angry, turns to wright. wright clearly doesn't like this either, but is resigned to it.}
<C>__{wright}
<D>__{this is cleared from the top, travers. matheson will accompany you on the flight to san francisco.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{show him every professional courtesy.}
