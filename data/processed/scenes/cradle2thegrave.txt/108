<L>__{interior korean club day}
<A>__{daria walks out the front door.}
<L>__{interior chambers' cell day}
<A>__{willy chickens hovers near chambers, who is talking as he eats another meal. lobster. at first, we don't realize who chambers is addressing.}
<C>__{chambers}
<D>__{... if you're willing to pay five, you're willing to pay ten.}
<C>__{chambers }
<D>__{you're willing to pay ten, you're willing to pay twenty. twenty, forty. forty, eighty... i'm not selling till i know exactly where the ceiling is.}
<A>__{whereupon we see who he's talking to: ling.}
<C>__{chambers}
<D>__{you like foreplay?}
<C>__{ling}
<D>__{how much money do you want for the stones?}
<C>__{chambers}
<D>__{i hate foreplay. fuck the warm up drills girl's gotta get in there and be ready to score points. bring it straight to the motherfucking hoop. you understand?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so, instead of us going back and forth doing warm ups, my idea's for you to think of a number. a very high number. a very final number. a number so high and final it'll get me off good, bam, right when i hear it.}
<A>__{chambers hasn't looked at ling the whole time. still isn't looking. forks up some lobster meat. when... chickens' face suddenly appears in front of him. and... ling slams a lobster claw deep into chickens' neck. chambers doesn't wait for whatever's nexterior jumps back. fast for a big man. but ling is much faster. stronger. deadlier. quickly, and quietly beats chambers like a drum. chambers knows when it's finally tent folding time. croaks surrender through the blood and swelling }
<C>__{chambers}
<D>__{okay, okay...}
<A>__{ling stops.}
<C>__{chambers}
<D>__{ain't worth my life... i will take the five and call it a game.}
