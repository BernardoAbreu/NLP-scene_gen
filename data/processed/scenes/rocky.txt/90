<A>__{the first light of dawn streams through mickey's filthy windows... rocky is slumped in a chair and it is apparent he has lost interest in watching the movies. the film has completed its run through the projector and lazily flops around on the top reel... listlessly rocky rubs his reddened eyes. the door opens and mickey flips on the light... the two men stare at each other for a long moment. mickey studies rocky's despondent expression and knows what is on the fighter's mind.}

<A>__{rocky stands and, with his dog, inches past mickey and exits the room. mickey walks over and turns off the projector. he idly pushes the machine with a lazy motion until it slides off the desk and crashes to the floor.}
