<A>__{jackie and ben cuddled in bed, watching a video in the darkened room. it is not a french comedy. they are, however, eating popcorn. the door opens. annabelle stands motionless, composed. her face looks like she's been crying. she clears her throat...}

<D>__{i'm sorry you're sick.}
<A>__{from across the room. jackie stares at her.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i can't hear you.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{then turn off the cartoon!}
<A>__{jackie cups her hand to her ear. shakes her head, can't hear a thing. waves, come on over. and slowly... ...annabelle does. crawls up into the bed, on the opposite side from ben. into her mother's arms. jackie kisses her head, strong. big smile.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{i said...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{...i'm not deaf, y'know.}
<A>__{they grin at each other. like equals. jackie picks up the remote, cuts off the sound. and when ben turns to her...}

<A>__{wow? really? you bet. annabelle chuckles.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you think she's the queen of cool?}
<A>__{jackie shakes her head. pulls down the covers, pulls up her t shirt...}
<C>__{jackie}
