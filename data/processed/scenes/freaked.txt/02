<A>__{the e.e.s. logo a large metal shoe with a bar across it, with the words "everything except shoes" beneath. widen to reveal richard hertz, president of e.e.s., smiling rigidly to camera. rick coogan is next to him, also holding a stiff movie star smile. flash! they shake hands as the ees photographer takes publicity shots. off to one side, behind hertz, are several ees executives. behind rick is his entourage: lawyer, bodyguard, trainer, stylist, and spirit}
<B>__{guide.}
<A>__{further off, at the boardroom table, four doddering old corporate farts on the brink of death look on with glazed expressions.}
<C>__{rick}
<P>__{(through a clenched smile)}
<D>__{so, what kind of crap do you scumbags want me to peddle?}
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{everything. everything except shoes, of course. hah hah...}
<A>__{he laughs pathetically. rick doesn't respond. hertz nods to a nearby executive who hands him some beef sticks.}
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{meaty twig beef sticks.}
<A>__{rick takes them and holds them up to the camera. smiles. flash.}
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{helmet head hair spray.}
<A>__{he takes the hair spray and holds it up. smile. flash. the assistant carefully hands hertz a pulsating metal container with lots of warnings and danger symbols on it. hertz gives it to rick.}
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{noxon 24 biogenetic neuro fertilizer.}
<A>__{rick holds it up, then pushes it away in disgust.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{fertilizer? ricky coogan does not do ads for hi tech cow shit. i'm a star, got it, hertz?}
<P>__{(to his aide)}
<D>__{rico, give these misguided clowns tony danza's phone number, and let's get the hell out of here.}
<A>__{he gives the finger to the ees photographer, who obligingly takes a picture. hertz waves at him to get lost, and calls after rick who's headed to the door with his entourage.}
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{rick. wait! only you can stand up to the radicals trying to keep noxon from the struggling farmers whose very future depends on it.}
<C>__{rick}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{noxon? wasn't that just banned?}
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{only in the u.s....and europe.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{but i heard that shit's lethal.}
<A>__{hertz lets out a big laugh. he shakes his head at rick.}
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{rick, rick, rick... you want proof? fine. just take a seat. please.}
<A>__{rick nods to his entourage. they sit at the boardroom table, across from the ees execs. an easel behind hertz shows a placard with a bar graph. hertz whispers something to an aide, who scurries off.}
<C>__{hertz}
<P>__{(to rick)}
<D>__{meet the head of our south american research facility, juan valdez.}
<A>__{the aide ushers in a handsome latin american executive in a natty three piece suit and a sombrero.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{my name is george ramirez.}
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{whatever. he's worked with noxon 24 every day for five years, and he's in fine shape. aren't you, juan?}
<A>__{george glares at hertz bitterly. hertz stares him down.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yes. i am fine. me and my team in santa flan have }
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{santa "flan?" what kind of shitty name for a country is that?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{it is named for the patron saint of creamy desserts... as i was saying, we've worked very closely with noxon...}
<A>__{rick nods. we cut back to george, but he isn't george anymore. he has mutated into a similar looking actor, in the same suit, the same sombrero, but shorter and swarthier.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{i personally supervised its development...}
<A>__{rick furrows his brow. he's a little suspicious of george's transformation, but just a little. now george is even shorter, even swarthier. yet another actor.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{i performed rigorous scientific tests. no potential danger was left uninvestigated...}
<A>__{rick's suspicion is increasing. he looks over to hertz, who feigns total innocence. george is now even shorter. still another actor. his clothes are baggy, and the sombrero is starting to slide down over his face.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{the environmentalists are crackpots, all of them.}
<A>__{rick looks at his entourage. their mouths hang open in astonishment. george has now shrunk to near midget proportions. the sombrero completely covers his head. when he takes it off, we see he's now played by linda hunt!}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{it's ridiculous, i tell you. totally ridiculous!}
<A>__{rick is ready to ask questions, but hertz cuts him off.}
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{thank you, valdez. that will be all.}
<A>__{george nods and heads back to his seat. as he passes behind hertz, he can't resist sticking his thumbs in his ears and making a face.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{wait a second }
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{ricky, this is important. we're talking about a major threat to the ees image. how does 2 million dollars plus expenses sound?}
<A>__{the aide reveals a new placard on the easel. it reads "$2 million."}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{look, it sounds great, but }
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{i hear you. make it five million }
<P>__{(a new placard: 5 million)}
<D>__{that is, if the board agrees ...}
<A>__{hertz reaches beside his chair and pulls a lever. the old geezers beside him raise their arms stiffly, as if they were being pulled by strands of fishing line, which they are.}
<C>__{hertz}
<D>__{good, it's unanimous. well, what do you say, ricky? are you ees's "man in santa flan?"}
<A>__{rick looks at his advisors they look over at linda hunt, then emphatically shake their heads "no." rick looks at hertz, who shows him five big fingers and grins. rick breaks into a big smile and gives hertz his trademark thumbs up sign.}
