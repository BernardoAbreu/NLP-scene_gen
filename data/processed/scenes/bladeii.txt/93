<L>__{interior scud's workshop blade's sleeping area night}
<A>__{blade sits in the shadows, wrapping a piece of rubber tubing around his arm, injecting himself with pneumatic syringe of serum. he shivers, convulses violently, then throws back his head in relief. when he does so, he sees whistler standing in the doorway. they eye each other a moment as blade unwraps the tubing from his arm, puts away his syringe and serum. whistler lights a cigarette, then nods through a window towards nyssa and the others.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{you ask me, you and miss muffet are getting a mite too cozy for my taste.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{i wouldn't worry about it.}
<A>__{blade moves to walk away, but whistler stops him.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{i am worrying. seems to me, you're starting to get confused as to which side of the line you're standing on.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{pretty hollow words coming from a man who spent the last year running with the enemy.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{what the hell is that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{it means i'm starting to wonder if the vampires still have their hooks in you. you've been acting strange ever since i gave you the cure. reckless, quick to anger }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you said it yourself, whistler. those vampires knew our defense system backwards and forwards. where'd they get their intel?}
<A>__{whistler steps closer, his voice dropping to a lethal, whisper.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{i'm compromised?! me?! i'm not the one playing stink finger with vampirella out there!}
<A>__{blade stares back at whistler, calm as a viper.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{you're out of line, old man.}
<A>__{the two comrades in arms stare each other down. then, finally, whistler backs away.}
<C>__{whistler}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{we'll see.}
<A>__{whistler turns and strides exits. we hold on blade, torn, conflicted, watching whistler retreat.}
