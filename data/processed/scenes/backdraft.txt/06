<L>__{exterior building day 20 yrs. earlier}
<A>__{there's a level of apartments above the storefronts. as brian watches, a window opens and out steps his father and adcox onto a small fire escape. their attention's on the next window over, out of reach, wrapped in leaky smoke. suddenly dennis climbs up onto the fire escape railing, armed with only an axe, and jumps across to the next metal balcony. a ballsy, dangerous move. he kicks in the window, breaks out the frame with his axe, and dives in. a beat later he reemerges on the balcony with a terrified, smudged little girl. he hands the little girl over the railing to a fireman now coming up the more traditional way a ladder. dennis's face lifts and grins at brian; dirty, bigger than life, invincible. he winks a wink only possible between fathers and sons and he's gone again, back into the swirling darkness. as brian stands there, full of love, full of pride, he sees a piece of awning along the roofline crack; releasing a sickly yellow tongue of flame that slinks over the roof. the flame seems to pause, to stare at brian a beat. shhh, don't tell anyone. brian is transfixed, his little head staring up in astonishment. nobody else has noticed it. brian can see his father and adcox through the window; probing, looking for the flame lurking just above. brian starts to call out in a small, hesitant voice,}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{dad...}
<A>__{he tries to call louder... but suddenly everything is happening very fast in slow motion: brian can see adcox testing the ceiling with a pike pole as brian steps forward, under the power of a flame that beckons him as dennis suddenly throws his body against adcox, knocking him clear just as a flame explodes downward from the ceiling fully against him as all the building's windows blow out and it's like the sky's erupted for brian, a burning hailstorm that falls and pelts the ground around him. plaster, wood, and something metal that cracks against the pavement and spins slowly. a fire helmet. and adcox is coming out the door now, blackened and torn, hopeless tears streaming down his face.}

<D>__{get us some backup! we need some goddamn backup!}
<A>__{and, spotting brian, he runs towards him. and the helmet spins and spins and adcox keeps running, and the sky is raining fire, and the flame on the roof has risen up now to its full, horrifying size and it's laughing now, laughing at the little boy as the helmet finally stops spinning, and we read the printing on the neck guard.}
<B>__{mccaffrey}
<A>__{and adcox is sobbing and has his arms around the boy, protecting him from the fire, the world, but it's like brian doesn't see him. he pulls away from adcox, walks up to his father's helmet, and puts it on. the scene explodes with a flash as a photographer captures the instant.}
