<L>__{interior urban school, office day}
<A>__{tracy looks out a window from behind steel bars. below her, young children play in a playground. they're playing hop scotch, throwing balls, chasing each other. the swing sets are broken. the handball wall is graffitied.}
<C>__{woman's voice }
<D>__{i'm sorry, mrs. mills. we don't have anything right now.}
<A>__{tracy looks away from the window to the haggard woman. the school's office is ill equipped, busy, disorganized.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{we'll try to give you a call if we need substitutes next month.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{tracy looks back at the playground: on the other side of a chain link fence, a butcher in a bloody apron walks down the ramp of a freezer truck. he carries a big, whole, slaughtered pig on his shoulder. the pig's head flops as the butcher walks. some children stop their games and run to watch the man and the pig corpse pass.}
