<A>__{the bundle of newspapers. it hits the sidewalk with a smack. camera pulls back as sidney falco crosses the sidewalk. the owner of the newsstand, iggy, comes to pick up the bundle; he is a grizzled gnome with a philosophical sense of humor; sidney snaps his fingers with impatience. iggy wears spectacles and is clearly more or less blind, he has to grope for the cord that binds the papers.}

<A>__{annoyed, sidney throws him a dime, seizes a paper and returns briskly to the orange juice stand. orange juice stand night sidney's place at the crowded counter has been taken by newcomers. rudely, he recovers his half consumed glass of orange juice and sandwich. he takes them further down the counter to a quieter corner at which he can examine the paper. camera moving with him, picks up further snatches of overheard dialogue. (see dialogue attached at the end of the scene) we move close enough to see sidney's hands open the paper expertly at hunsecker's column identifiable by the picture of the spectacled eyes. over scene there is a babble of offstage dialogue.}
