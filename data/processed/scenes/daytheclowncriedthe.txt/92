<L>__{interior boxcar helmut's pov day}
<A>__{in one end of the car the children are huddled together in one frightened, wailing mass. they do not even notice helmut at first, so great is their sorrow. the little ones cling to the larger youngsters, who, in turn, cling together. the small ones weep hysterically , as children do when they have been crying for a very long time. the camera pulls back so that helmut is in f.g. he slides the boxcar door open fully, throwing more light on the children. this brings renewed walls of anguish from the youngsters, who cluster together more fiercely. but one little boy sneaks a look at the door, expecting to see more guards. when he sees helmut, his tear filled eyes widen. he can scarcely believe what he sees, much less verbalize it. he tugs frantically at an older girl he has been clutching. she looks first at him, then at helmut. she, too, can hardly believe it.}
<C>__{older girl}
<P>__{(tentatively)}
<D>__{doork?}
<P>__{(shrill with recognition)}
<D>__{it's doork. it is! it is!}
<A>__{the children begin untangling quickly. faces appear between legs, around skirts and over shoulders. for a moment they can only stare at helmut, speechless with wonder.}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{so this is where you've been hiding?}
<A>__{that breaks the silence, and the children begin squealing ad libbed expressions of greeting and relief. they repeat his name time and again: "doork, doork, doork." as one... the youngsters surge toward him. the little boy who first saw him reaches him first. he drops to his knees and puts his arms around helmut's neck, hugging him furiously. helmut returns the embrace.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{i want to go home. take me home.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{now, now, there's nothing to cry about. we're going to have fun.}
<P>__{(disengaging himself}
<D>__{and picking up the}
<P>__{sack)}
<D>__{here. i brought you something.}
<P>__{(he tosses it into the car)}
<D>__{the children pounce on the sack and tug at it, unsure what it is except that it's a gift from helmut.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{wait now. don't open it yet. wait'll i get in. you help me.}
<A>__{he backs up a few steps, the camera pulling back with him. then he runs toward the car and, with strength he really doesn't have, jumps up so that he gets his arms on the floor of the boxcar. he heaves himself forward partially into it, and the children grab his clothes to help him inside. a couple of the older boys seize the seat of his pants and finally pull him in.}
