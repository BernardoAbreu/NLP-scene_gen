<C>__{captain sharp}
<P>__{(horrified)}
<D>__{juvenile refuge. that sounds like jail.}
<A>__{silence. in the background, the acolyte picks up panagle's walking stick weapon off the floor. he stares at it, puzzled. social services says carefully:}
<C>__{social services}
<D>__{just find the boy and deliver him }

<C>__{captain sharp}
<D>__{nobody's going anywhere.}

<C>__{captain sharp}
<D>__{he's not getting shock therapy.}

<C>__{redford}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{look!}
<A>__{everyone looks. redford is standing on a pew with his arm stretched out pointing up at the choir loft in amazement. the troop is there, but sam's and suzy's seats are empty. there is a flash, a bang, and all the lights in the room go out at once. people gasp. candles flicker alight on candlesticks. a back up generator kicks into gear, humming, and the room fills with a new, different light. captain sharp says to himself:}
<C>__{captain sharp}
<D>__{they're gone.}
