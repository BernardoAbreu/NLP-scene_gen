<P>__{(into phone)}
<A>__{yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... negative attention is attention. like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention.}
<C>__{ike }
<A>__{this is about her negative attention, not mine. did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet?}
<C>__{fisher}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<A>__{no, i'm paying for the dress. do you think she's still gonna run?}
<C>__{ike }
<A>__{i don't know. ellie enters the kitchen, hears the question and shakes her head to herself. if only these boys would give it up.}
