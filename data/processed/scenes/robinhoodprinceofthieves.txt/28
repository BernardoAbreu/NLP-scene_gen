<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior stream}
<A>__{water erupts under hooves. aslan fords a stream. duncan hangs on for dear life. robin strives to keep up. half a mile behind gisborne splits up his men. trying for a short cut, robin finds himself at the steepest part of the river gorge. his horse balks at the drop. robin flails at his mount with hands and feet. it backs away.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{damn you, animal!}
<A>__{aslan shouts from the far bank.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{treat it like a woman.}
<A>__{robin continues to hit his horse and hurl abuse. closing in, the soldiers unfurl their crossbows. a flight of bolts whistles ominously close to robin. he must jump or die.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{have you never had a woman? gently, man. soothe it!}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{of course i've had a woman! come on, pretty one.}
<A>__{he pats the horse soothingly. the animal edges forward.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{softly. with your knees.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i know! i know!}
<A>__{the soldiers reload. robin urges the horse at the steep drop.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{easy, easy.}
<A>__{another wave of crossbow bolts. robin launches the frightened animal into space. hooves flail... touch down. scramble up the other bank. robin enthusiastically pats the horse's neck.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i love you!}
<A>__{the first two pursuers misjudge their leaps. their mounts land sprawling in the riverbed.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{robin of the hood! son of the devil worshipper.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{what is your pleasure, gisborne?}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{it was i who strung your father's corpse to the castle gate. my pleasure will be in doing the same to you.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{you survived one meeting. our next will be your last.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{your father died a coward, cursing your name and squealing like a stuck pig.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{that's a lie!}
<A>__{incensed, he is losing his judgement.}
<C>__{aslan}
<P>__{(shouts)}
<D>__{come, robin! he is trying to anger you into a trap.}
<A>__{a shaft pierces the flank of robin's horse. it rears in fright. robin clings on. six soldiers, the men gisborne split off, are climbing the embankment towards him. robin regains control. rides right at them. scatters them, and takes off again. gisborne yells at his men to follow. robin and aslan ride flat out. open land turns to scrub. seeing no followers, robin pulls up and dismounts.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{we have lost them. i will lame this mare if i ask her to go any farther.}
<A>__{he gently extracts the shaft from his horse. aslan opens his pouch. pulls out two shiny clear pebbles and a square leather hide. rolls the pebbles into the tube and holds it to his eye. a primitive telescope. robin watches, curious.}
<B>__{scope pov}
<A>__{through the scope we see the movement on the hill behind them.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{here they come. look.}
<A>__{robin puts the device to his eye...}
<B>__{scope pov}
<A>__{the soldiers are close!}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{he reacts in shock. prepares to defend himself. then realizes they are still in the distance.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{is this arab magic?}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{no. arab science.}
<A>__{he replaces the tube in his pouch.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{how did your uneducated kind ever take jerusalem?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{god knows!}
<A>__{aslan laughs. robin points towards an endless expanse of trees.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{we can lose them in the forest.}
<C>__{duncan}
<D>__{sherwood is haunted, master.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{either we take our chances with the ghosts, or become ghosts ourselves.}
<A>__{he remounts. they race into the trees. gisborne's men thunder up,... slowing as they enter the forest. peering around them in trepidation, they slowly rein in. robin looks back.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{they're not following.}
<A>__{gisborne curses his men, urging them on.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{come on, damn you! there are only three of them.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{it's not the men we fear, sir.}
<A>__{eerie howling and rattling of bones. aslan draws his sword.}
<C>__{duncan}
<D>__{banshees. they say they fly in your mouth and suck you dry of blood before you can scream.}
<A>__{he wraps his scarf over his mouth.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{be quiet! listen.}
<A>__{wind gusts the trees in angry waves. emits deathly shrieks. the horses whinney. unnerved, aslan smites around him with his scimitar. wheels at the sounds, striking only air.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{allah protect us from the evil spirits.}
<A>__{duncan clings to his back. robin points.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{behind you!}
<A>__{aslan slashes out, futilely.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{no, there! and there!}
<A>__{aslan flails. robin cracks up.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{cease your mad laughing. i can feel them.}
<A>__{robin reaches into the branches. pulls out a string of hollowed wooden tubes windchimes. dozens of such strings on all the trees. he blows over the hollow end. a low chilling moan.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{here are your ghosts, duncan. a child's toy put to good use. you scare easily, my painted saladin.}
<A>__{his laughter is broken by a piercing yell. a red jacketed figure swings down out of a tree on a rope. catapults him to the ground. the bushes are instantly alive. shaggy, wild eyed men, armed with cudgels, scythes and hayforks. twelfth century hell's angels. the red jacketed young turk, will scarlet, leaps around robin.}
<C>__{will scarlet}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{ring around the rosie!}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{aslan!}
<A>__{aslan makes no move to intervene. the woodsmen eye the bizarre stranger, keeping their distance from him. will kicks at robin, who tries to grab him. will skips out of range. robin falls.}
<C>__{will scarlet}
<D>__{atishoo, atishoo. we all fall down. beg for mercy, rich man.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i beg of no man. which of you scum has guts enough to face me man to man?}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{yeah, bollocks, mate.}
<A>__{robin looks up... i mean up! a towering figure. seven feet of grinning, muscled brute. the giant extends a vice that passes for a hand. hauls robin to his feet. his eyes twinkle with merriment. his whole body shakes when he laughs, which is often.}
<C>__{john little}
<D>__{what are ya, m'old cock?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{er... robin...}
<A>__{he pauses, checking the faces of the angry peasants.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{...hood. robin hood. who are you?}
<C>__{john little}
<D>__{john little. bestman o' the woods.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{bestman? you lead this rabble?}
<C>__{will scarlet}
<D>__{we waste time. tax him.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{tax? for what?}
<C>__{will scarlet}
<D>__{for passage through sherwood.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i will pay no tax. besides, i have nothing but my cloak and my sword.}
<C>__{will scarlet}
<D>__{a man who travels with two servants and claims he's without money, is either a fool or a liar.}
<A>__{grabbing robin, little shakes him like a doll. something clinks. robin's father's medallion. laughing heartily, little rips it from robin's neck and tosses it to scarlet.}
<C>__{will scarlet}
<D>__{and this one is a liar.}
<P>__{(he bites the metal)}
<D>__{ahah! gold!}
<A>__{the men cheer. john snatches the medallion back from will.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{that is sacred to me.}
<C>__{john little}
<D>__{sacred to us too, mush. this here'll feed us for a bloomin' month.}
<A>__{robin draws his sword.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{you will have to fight me for it.}
<C>__{john little}
<D>__{i'd love to, mate.}
<A>__{he grins hugely. a boy pushes his way through the throng.}
<C>__{wulf}
<D>__{wait, father! i know him.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{this man is your father? tell him how i saved your hide from the sheriff's soldiers. that deserves some gratitude, i believe.}
<A>__{he reaches for the medallion. john pulls it away.}
<C>__{john little}
<D>__{naw ya don't, laddie.}
<C>__{will scarlet}
<D>__{you must be robin of locksley. the blackguard who abandoned us to nottingham's plundering.}
<C>__{wulf}
<D>__{be careful, father. he fights like a demon. he walloped six o' sheriff's men?}
<C>__{john little}
<D>__{is that so?}
<A>__{another grin. licking his lips in anticipation, he lunges for robin's wrist. wrenches the sword free. bends it into a pretzel.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{aslan!}
<A>__{aslan shrugs. robin swings a fist into the giant's gut. john doesn't flinch. hoists robin off the ground with one arm. cannonballs the other fist into robin's stomach. robin folds.}
<C>__{will scarlet}
<D>__{oh dear! the little rich boy is lost for words. thanks for the taxes, locksley.}
<C>__{john little}
<D>__{and for the laughs.}
<A>__{the woodsmen find this hysterical. they disappear into the tree. will administers one final kick before leaving. robin staggers to his feet. glares furiously at aslan.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{son of an arab whore! once again your assistance was invaluable.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{you seemed more in danger of losing your pride than your life.}
<C>__{duncan}
<D>__{i recognized some of the voices. many were from your father's farms.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{your avenging army, my friend.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{that rabble?}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{all they need is a leader.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{they have a leader. a very large one.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{defeat him and they will follow you.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{allah has taken your brains.}
<C>__{duncan}
<D>__{i hear the voice of a spoiled child, master robin. i suggest you cease your brave talk of revenge and flee to the north.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{you, too? you expect me to fight that behemoth?}
<C>__{duncan}
<D>__{your father would expect you to act like a man.}
