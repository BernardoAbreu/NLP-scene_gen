<D>__{are you a believer?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{in some things.}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{i mean in god.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{that's a tough one. i don't disbelieve in him, but i couldn't say i believed in him either. i guess i just never paid him much mind. didn't seem important.}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{god not important?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i don't mean what he does isn't important if he exists. i mean it's not important to me whether he exists or not.}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{christian was raised in a christian home.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{is that so? i didn't know }

<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{christian said you never was much worried about money i been worried about money most of my life up until i figured out it wasn't so important.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{no, it's necessary, but it isn't so important.}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{well how come you want to play this king fella?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{ambition maybe security, like that.}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{is it aspiration to be the king or just uncertainty about the future?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i ain't looking for security if that's what you mean.}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{not trying to lock something up tight and nail it down?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{that would figure into it. but that isn't all of it. it's important to me.}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{now son which is more important to you, this king business or christian?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{if you got the guts to ask that question, mr. craigie, i guess i got the guts to answer it. christian, if you came right down to it, is not as important as doing what i have to do.}
<A>__{craigie has finished piling the manure. he puts away his shovel.}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{well son, i had to know.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{know what?}
<C>__{craigie}
<D>__{there never was a man worth a damn, to my mind, who let his woman stand in the way of the thing he had to do.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i got to go now see what i can do for a sick heifer. why don't you take christian, when her mama lets go of her, and tell her i said you should go to the old spring. it's a good place.}
