<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm detective jefferson }
<C>__{rosa}
<D>__{oh... did betty call you?}
<A>__{charlie nods. rosa opens the door, and he enters with wesley.}
<C>__{rosa}
<D>__{she's got problems, but she's no killer. i hope you guys can straighten this out...}
<A>__{charlie and wesley exchange a puzzled look.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{we'll do what we can. where is she?}
<C>__{rosa}
<D>__{bet ty!}
<P>__{(to the men)}
<D>__{please, go easy on her. she's had a really rough day.}

<C>__{rosa }
<D>__{these guys are here to help you, betty.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{rosa, i didn't kill del... they did.}
<A>__{wesley produces a pistol, sitting rosa forcibly on the sofa and tapes her mouth and hands. charlie walks over to betty.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{we meet again.}
<A>__{he moves closer to her... almost whispers. wesley steps in and quickly tapes her hands. charlie stops him.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{not her mouth...}
<P>__{(to betty)}
<D>__{i've spent many long hours in a car with your face staring back at me. i've seen it painted on the horizon.}
<C>__{wesley}
<P>__{(to charlie)}
<D>__{what's wrong with you?}
<A>__{a knock at the door ruins charlie's moment.}
<C>__{rosa}
<D>__{that's our pizza.}
<A>__{wesley hustles rosa out of the room.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{get rid of them. you understand?}
<A>__{betty nods, scared, and looks through the peephole. she stares with disbelief at roy ostrey. he knocks again. she opens the door a crack.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{betty! boy, am i glad to see you!}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{roy! what are you doing here?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{you're in serious danger!}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{ahh, look, right now's not very...}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i woulda' been here sooner, but ballard put me in jail. he still thinks you had del scalped.}
<C>__{ballard}
<D>__{i never said that! open the door, betty.}
<A>__{ballard shoves roy aside; charlie's getting edgy ...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{sheriff, i don't...}
<C>__{ballard}
<D>__{c'mon, betty, open up! i got some questions for you about...}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{have you checked the trunk of that car you're driving, betty? i think there might be...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{it's not really a good time, guys...}
<C>__{ballard}
<D>__{don't give me that. i've come two thousand miles for this!}
<A>__{charlie has been listening quietly on the other side of the door and finally snaps.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{two thousand miles? that's nothing!}
<A>__{he flings the door open, sticks a pistol in ballard's face and yanks them both inside.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{hah! you probably flew! i've crossed the river styx looking for her, pal! i travelled the fucking country to be here!}
<A>__{charlie slams the door and frisks them, taking a gun and handcuffs from ballard. wesley returns with rosa.}
<C>__{charlie }
<P>__{(to betty)}
<D>__{who are these idiots?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{this is roy ostrey, he's a reporter. and this is sheriff ballard. we all went to fair oaks high together...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{oh, this is wonderful...}
<A>__{wesley takes over. he sits rosa down on the sofa, then pushes betty down next to her and beckons to roy.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{come here.}
<A>__{he breaks roy's nose with his pistol. roy crumples to the floor, holding his face. betty starts to scream, but charlie puts his hand over her mouth. wesley tapes roy's hands together, then beckons to ballard.}
<C>__{wesley }
<D>__{your turn.}
<A>__{ballard drops to his knees in a prayer like position near the aquarium.}
<C>__{ballard}
<D>__{i got two kids and a dog...}
<A>__{wesley grabs his shirtfront and slams him to the floor, then with a foot on his neck, he loops ballard's arms around one leg of the steel aquarium stand and handcuffs him. charlie does nothing but stare at betty, his eyes locked with hers. wesley sees it.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{act professional, remember?}
<A>__{charlie pulls her to her feet.}
<C>__{wesley }
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{charlie leads betty out of the room.}
<C>__{wesley }
<D>__{no way! this is not professional!}
