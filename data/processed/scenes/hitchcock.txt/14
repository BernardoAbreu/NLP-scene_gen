<L>__{interior hitchcock's office, paramount day}
<A>__{hitchcock peeks avidly through the blinds at a smartly dressed kim novak type woman hurrying along to some appointment or assignation... hitch cranes to see who she's meeting, but she moves tantalizingly out of sight. hitch turns back with a sigh towards his desk, covered with discarded newspaper clippings and boring story proposals. he sweeps them off his desk into the trash.}
<L>__{interior hitchcock's outer office a moment later}
<A>__{a shadow looms over peggy at her desk as she sifts through another round of story ideas. it's hitchcock. he startles her.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{anything. anything at all?}
<A>__{he starts sifting through her tray. she notices the glass in his hand.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{nothing suitable. is that water or do i need to call alma?}
<A>__{he drains it playfully.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{gin. mother's ruin.}
<A>__{but something's caught his eye. a circled review of anthony boucher's column "criminal minds" in the new york times review of books. he picks it up.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{boucher says this "psycho" book by robert bloch is `fiendishly entertaining'.}

<A>__{he takes the coverage and reads for himself.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{"graphic elements of brutal violence, voyeurism, transvestitism and incest." certainly not your average run of the mill nutcase, is he?}
<A>__{he gives a grunt of approval.}
<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{you're kidding.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
