<L>__{interior korean club upstairs hall night}
<A>__{music pumps downstairs as su and fait cautiously move down the hall toward chambers' office.}
<C>__{fait}
<D>__{no chambers' guys. i don't get it.}
<A>__{they reach the closed office door, where they stop and listen. hear nothing. su and fait exchange a "ready ready" look. then su opens the door.}
<L>__{interior chambers' office continuous action}
<A>__{su and fait enter, unchallenged, to find... odion and the other chambers' men. dead. skull shot.}
<C>__{fait}
<D>__{i get it now.}
<A>__{su ignores the bodies, quickly moves to the zen fountain, where he reaches into the water and begins searching the rocks lining the bottom. beat. then }
<C>__{fait}
<D>__{are they there?}
<A>__{su doesn't answer, still searching.}
<C>__{fait}
<D>__{no. this can't fucking happen. they gotta be there.}
<A>__{another beat. then, at last, su holds something up: one black stone. it takes fait a moment to understand.}
<C>__{fait}
<D>__{... what? that's it?}
<C>__{su}
<D>__{the rest are gone.}
<A>__{fait can't believe it.}
<C>__{fait}
<D>__{... what the hell happened? who got 'em?}
<C>__{su}
<D>__{... ling.}
<C>__{fait}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{su}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{fait}
<D>__{... how'd he get here before us?}
<C>__{su}
<D>__{he's good.}
<A>__{beat. failure. summed up in one word:}
<C>__{fait}
<D>__{vanessa...}
<P>__{(then, trying)}
<D>__{he has the stones. there's no reason to keep her. hell, she's a little girl, she's eight years old she can't hurt him. he can let her go... he can just fucking let her go...}
<A>__{su just looks at him. not a chance. and he knows fait knows it, too. it's over. for fait, it's as if his life just ended.}
<C>__{fait}
<D>__{... what the hell am i gonna do?}
<C>__{su}
<D>__{... we need to go.}
<A>__{fait doesn't move. then, suddenly, it all explodes as rage, and fait picks up the large, stone ball spinning atop the fountain and, screaming, hurls it into a large display of exotica, destroying it. beat. fait looks at su, who meets his eyes. then }
<C>__{su}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{off which, as su mobilizes him, and they go...}
