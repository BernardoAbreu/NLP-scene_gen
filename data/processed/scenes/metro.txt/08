<L>__{interior bank day}
<A>__{a tense situation. a wild eyed, white punk, fuck up of a bank robber, earl, is holding a pretty, young teller around the neck with a cocked gun held to her temple. the other bank employees are cowering on the floor. a few are giving aid to the wounded bank guard who is half conscious and oozing blood from his side. roper strolls right through the front door and walks toward earl, very sociable.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{hi, earl, i'm scott roper. wanna donut? i ate the glazed but there's a bunch of chocolate and a }
<A>__{earl swipes the donuts out of roper's hand and starts frisking roper for weapons with his free hand. the other hand still has the gun poised at the young teller's head.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{i'm a negotiator, earl. i don't carry a weapon.}
<A>__{roper smiles reassuringly at the pretty teller. it seems to help. earl finishes patting roper down, straightens back up and puts his hand around the teller's neck.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{where's the car?}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{i need to get something straight first.}
<A>__{roper looks over at the other bank employees huddled on the floor.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{who's the manager?}
<A>__{a balding, middle aged man sheepishly raises his hand.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{i am.}
<A>__{roper takes a step toward him.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{when did you start keeping longer hours?}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{last spring.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{really! because i've been thinking of moving to this branch. it would be really convenient for me }
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{hey, shut up!}
<A>__{earl wags his gun against the teller's ear.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{do you want me to start killing people?!}
<A>__{roper holds his hand up defensively.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{it's my job to see that no one gets killed, earl... including you.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{then where's my fucking car!}
<A>__{earl is pouring sweat. his gun hand is shaking uncontrollably.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{i'm getting it, earl, but we have to do this the right way.}
<A>__{roper keeps his eyes locked on earl. his voice is calm.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{first i need you to point that gun away from }
<P>__{(to the teller)}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{teller}
<P>__{(voice trembling)}
<D>__{debbie...}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{point the gun away from debbie.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{debbie's brains are going to be splattered all over the floor if i don't see a car in five minutes!}
<A>__{roper takes a long look at earl. the guy is a hair trigger.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{alright! but let's be clear about one thing. if you kill someone, i can't help you. the swat guys will take you out.}
<A>__{earl glances at the army of cop cars poised outside. reflects for a moment on the reality of the situation.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{what are my chances of getting out of here?}
<A>__{roper calmly moves toward where the wounded guard is laying.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{not bad. last month, a guy robbed a bank in daly city...}
<A>__{roper crouches down, smiles at the blurry eyed guard.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{how ya doin'?}
<A>__{the guard groans. he's not doing very well. roper peels back the bloody handkerchief, takes a look. winces.}
<C>__{roper}
<P>__{(to earl)}
<D>__{...cops gave him a car, and he lost them on the freeway.}
<A>__{earl is encouraged by that.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{absolutely. bank robbers are generally your smartest criminals.}
<A>__{roper looks directly into earl's eyes.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{he didn't kill anybody, though.}
<A>__{roper bends over the guard.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{this is gonna hurt.}
<A>__{he grabs the guard under the arms and starts dragging him across the floor. the guard moans piteously.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{hey, leave him alone. what are you doing?}
<A>__{roper keeps dragging the guard toward the front door.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{it's part of my negotiator's oath. if there's an injured party and i can help them, i'm duty bound by my oath to do that. you can shoot me if you want, but the next negotiator in here is going to tell you the same thing.}
<A>__{earl is unsure what to do, but he guesses an oath is an oath. he lets roper drag the guard to the door.}
<C>__{roper}
<D>__{i will be right back, earl. point that gun away from debbie.}
<A>__{earl compliantly moves the gun away from the teller's head, then re thinks and jerks it back against her temple.}
