<D>__{i am not i just think it'd be funny to see what he'd do...}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i thought we decided that josh was way too cool to be interested in sex, and that he's the only decent person left in the world and we would never want to bring him down to our level and all that...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{yeah, but maybe one of us should at least try...}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{no matter what happened it would be a big disaster... let's just try and keep everything the way it is.}
