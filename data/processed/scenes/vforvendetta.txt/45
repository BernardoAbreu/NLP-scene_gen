<A>__{the door opens and finch steps in.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{ah, mr. finch. i sent for you because what i have to say cannot be said over a phone or a radio. what i have to say cannot leave these four walls. do i make myself clear?}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{i believe in a few things, mr. finch. i believe in god. i believe in the destiny of the nordic race. and i believe in fascism. the romans invented fascism. they had a symbol for it; a bundle of twigs bound together. one twig could be broken but a bundle would prevail. that is the heart and soul of fascism. strength in unity. i tell you these things knowing full well that they make you uncomfortable.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{well, i...}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{you have in fact expressed your discomfort in several arrest reports, arrests that were, in your opinion, "unnecessary." the fact that you are here, that you are not rotting in a prison cell, is a mark of my respect and admiration for you, for your craft, and for what you have done for this country.}
<A>__{finch looks at the ground.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{it is also because i know you, finch. i know what you are. you're a man like me. a man who understands when they are given a job what must be done. i understand you, finch, and that is why i can trust you.}
<A>__{he moves in close to finch.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{this terrorist knows us, finch. these attacks are perfectly calculated and they are divisive. he knows what he's doing, finch. he knows us all too well.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{you think he's an insider?}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{what i think is that this man must be stopped. stopped at all costs and no one, i repeat, no one is to be placed above suspicion. do i make myself clear?}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{perfectly.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{england prevails, mr. finch.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{england prevails.}
