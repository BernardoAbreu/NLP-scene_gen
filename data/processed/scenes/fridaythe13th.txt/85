<A>__{alice snaps around, sensing that she is being watched. in cu her frightened face looks at the sun drenched dusty pane. her face relaxes until bang! the sound of a door slamming echoes through the room. the camera zooms back from her face to see someone standing in the doorway. it is bill.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{sorry. how you doing?}
<A>__{alice smiles, then turns back to her job of taking inventory. bill watches her.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{did you want something?}
<A>__{she starts to take a box down from a high shelf. she doesn't realize that there is something on top of the box.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{steve said you were thinking of leaving. true?}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{un hunh.}
<A>__{alice lugs down the box and suddenly a bunch of leather working tools clatters down, shattering the silence. alice fends off the flying implements and bill rushes to her side.}
<C>__{alice}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{oh, my god...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{she nods.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you're lucky.}
<A>__{they stoop down to pick up the fallen tools from the floor. bill looks at her while they work.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{how come you're leaving?}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{it's long and personal. it has nothing to do with you or the other kids.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{maybe i can help?}
<A>__{alice looks at bill and smiles. this really is a very nice, if naive, young man.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{and it's this place. it makes no sense, but it spooks me.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{you're right. it makes no sense.}
<A>__{as alice nods, she is interrupted by a shrill scream outside.}
