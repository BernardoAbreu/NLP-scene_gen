<D>__{"the bad death of eduard delacroix"}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior del's cell day}
<A>__{paul is sitting with delacroix. brutal is leaning against the bars. del is throwing the spool. mr. jingles is fetching it. the silence is thick. just the clack clatter of the spool, and the skitter skitter of tiny mouse paws on concrete. it's getting on paul's nerves in a big way. softly:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what about dean? he's got a little boy would love a pet mouse, i bet.}
<A>__{del looks horrified at the thought.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{how could a boy be trust wid mr. jingles? maybe forget to feed him. and how he keep up wid his trainin', just a boy, n'est ce pas?}
<A>__{del tosses the spool again clack clatter, skitter skitter.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{all right, i will take him.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{t'ank you kindly, merci beaucoup, but you live out in the woods, and mr. jingles, he be scared to live out dans la foret.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{he whisper that in your ear?}
<A>__{del nods, tosses the spool again clack clatter, skitter skitter. paul is completely out of ideas. but then:}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{how about mouseville?}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{mouseville?}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{tourist attraction down in florida. tallahassee, i think. is that right, paul? tallahassee?}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(level)}
<D>__{yeah, that's right. tallahassee. just down the road apiece from the dog university.}
<A>__{brutal's mouth twitches, but he manages to keep a straight face. he gives paul a look don't blow this.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{you think they'd take mr. jingles? you think he's got the stuff?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{might. he's pretty smart.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{hey! what dis mouseville?}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{tourist attraction, i said. they got this big tent you go into }
<C>__{del}
<D>__{like a cirque? you have to pay?}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{you shittin' me? course you pay. dime a piece, two cents for the kids. and inside the tent there's this mouse city made out of boxes and toilet paper rolls...}
<A>__{percy is drifting up the block, listening too, but nobody's really paying him much mind.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{...plus they got the mouseville all star circus. there's mice that swing on trapeze, mice that roll barrels, mice that stack coins...}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{dat's it! dat's da place for mr. jingles! you gonna be a circus mouse after all! gonna live in a mouse city down in florida!}
<A>__{del tosses the spool extra hard it takes a bad bounce off the wall and goes clattering through the bars onto the mile. the mouse goes after it like a shot, too intent to notice: his old enemy percy.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{percy, no!}
<A>__{percy stomps the heel of his heavy work shoe down on mr. jingles. there's a soft snap as the mouse's back breaks. del screams in horror and throws himself at the bars, sobbing the mouse's name. percy looks to brutal and paul, smiles.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{knew i'd get him sooner or later. just a matter of time, really.}
<A>__{he turns and strolls up the mile, leaving mr. jingles dying in a tiny pool of blood. up at the duty desk, dean and harry get up from a cribbage game, stunned and furious. percy strolls past, exits to the execution chamber. del is still screaming, all his pent up terror and grief pouring out at the dying mouse. and then comes a soft, urgent voice:}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{give'm to me.}
<A>__{they turn. coffey's got his arms out through his bars, one massive hand spread open.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{give'm to me. might still be time.}
<A>__{paul hesitates, scoops the mouse up off the floor, wincing at the feel of it. splintered bones are poking at the hide.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{paul doesn't answer, just lays mr. jingles into coffey's hand. coffey pulls the mouse in through his bars and lays his other hand gently over it, cupping the creature. all we see now is the tail hanging out the side, twitching weakly.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{paul, what the hell }
<A>__{paul motions him quiet. del is pleading softly at his bars:}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{please, john. oh johnny, help him, please help him, s'il vous plait.}
<A>__{harry and dean join the group. everybody watching now. coffey puts his mouth to his cupped hands, inhales sharply. the world hangs suspended for a moment. coffey raises his face, contorting as if desperately ill, starts making those horrendous choking sounds in his throat...}
<C>__{brutal}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{oh, dear jesus. the tail. look at the tail.}
<A>__{they do. the tail is no longer weak and dying. it's snapping briskly back and forth, as if ready to play. coffey makes that retching gagging sound...and again exhales a cloud of swirling black "insects" from his nose and mouth. the men watch, speechless, as the bugs turn white and disappear. coffey bends down, opens his hand. mr. jingles bounds off his fingers through the bars, racing past the guards' feet. they turn to see del gather the mouse up, laughing and crying. dean turns back to coffey with a stunned whisper:}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{what did you do?}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{i helped del's mouse. he a circus mouse. goan live in a mouse city down in...down in...}
<C>__{brutal}
<P>__{(numb)}
<D>__{florida?}
<A>__{coffey nods, remembering.}
<C>__{coffey}
<D>__{boss percy's bad. he mean. he step on del's mouse.}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{i took it back, though.}
<A>__{and with that, he lies back on his bunk and faces the wall. the others look to paul, don't even know what to say.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{brute, come along with me.}
<P>__{(to harry and dean)}
<D>__{you fellas go on back to you cribbage game.}
<A>__{harry nods numbly. paul leads brutal up the mile...}
<B>__{execution chamber}
<A>__{...and they enter to find percy polishing old sparky's arms.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{don't start in on me. it was just a mouse. never belonged here in the first place.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{the mouse is fine. just fine. you're no better at mouse killing than anything else around here.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{you expect me to believe that? i heard the goddamn thing crunch.}
<A>__{paul steps closer, angry as we've ever seen him:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{aren't you glad mr. jingles is okay? after all our talks about how we should keep the prisoners calm? aren't you relieved?}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{what kind of game is this?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no game. see for yourself.}
<A>__{beat. percy stalks past them, heads out onto the mile. paul and brutal just wait, saying nothing. brutal picks up the rag left by percy, resumes polishing chores on old sparky. paul stretches, cracks his neck. the silence heavy... ...until percy reappears.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{you switched them! you switched them somehow, you bastards!}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{i always keep a spare mouse in my wallet for occasions such as this.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{you're playing with me, the both of you! just who the hell do you think you are }
<A>__{brutal grabs him , slams him bodily into the electric chair. paul bends close, gets right in percy's face.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{we're the people you work with, percy, but not for long. i want your word.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{my word?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i put you out front for del, you put in your transfer to briar ridge the very next day.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{what if i just call up certain people and tell them you're harassing me? bullying me?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{go ahead. i promise you'll leave your share of blood on the floor.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{over a mouse? you think anyone's gonna give two shits?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no. but four men will swear you stood by while wild bill tried to strangle dean to death. about that people will care, percy. even your uncle the governor will care.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{thing like that goes in your work record. work record can follow a man around a long, long time.}
<A>__{percy looks from one man to another, knowing he's trapped.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i put you out front, you put in your transfer. that's the deal.}
<A>__{percy thinks it over, nods. he tries to get up, but paul keep him pinned...and pointedly offer his hand.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you make a promise to a man, you shake his hand.}
<A>__{percy hesitates, shakes paul's hand...}
<B>__{high wide angle of execution chamber}
<A>__{...and paul pulls him out of the electric chair as we}
