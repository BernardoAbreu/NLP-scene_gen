<A>__{frank speeds up avenue b. noel, wearing generic homeless combat fatigues, muttering to his friends in hell, passes on the sidewalk. frank notices another hooker, catches her face: the same face as the pregnant whore #2. the rose face. his mind drifts:}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{rose was getting closer. ever since the call a month before, when i'd lost her, she seemed like all the girls in the neighborhood. one of the first things you learn is to avoid bad memories. i used to be an expert, but lately i'd found some holes. anything could trigger it. the last month belonged to rose, but there were a hundred more ready to come out.}
