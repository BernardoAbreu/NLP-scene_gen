<B>__{with efficiency and caution fbi swat types move toward the}
<A>__{auditorium. a grappling hook is thrown high over the roof; they prepare for an assault. a helicopter swoops in, bathing}
<B>__{the scene in its brilliant light...}
<L>__{interior auditorium stage night}
<B>__{peter has helen on the stage where chairs are randomly}
<A>__{scattered and pushed her to a seat facing him, almost knee}
<B>__{to knee... helen will use her psychological wiles to try to}
<A>__{take away peter's control of the situation... peter looks up}
<B>__{at the sound... he is proud and thrilled.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{listen to them! we'll be on all three channels.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{kill me, peter, do it, now.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{no. not yet.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{do it. if that's what all this carnage is about, then do it. have enough guts to do it.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{don't talk to me about courage. i know death, what it's like to kill. you're not a killer you watched daryll lee kill that cop and you didn't make a peep, because you were paralyzed with fear. you chocked. i know something else about you.}
<A>__{peter is jerking about with amphetamine energy; he pops a pill into his mouth and swallows...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{you want one? no? there was something in you that was fascinated, that wanted to see what it was like for a man to die. everybody feels it. like every person who slows to see a bad accident, or runs to see a fire. that's true. i see it in you... you're the same as me.}
<B>__{there is noise outside... like someone breaking in.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{oh, no.}
<A>__{he grabs her, and she moves with him, without resistance, as}
<B>__{he turns out the lights inside.}
<A>__{floodlights suddenly illuminate the facade outside,}
<B>__{increasing the brilliance of the light streaming in and darkening the shadows further. german expressionism.}
<A>__{he leads her back to the stage... he pushes her into a chair facing him... he looks into her face and smiles...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{we'll keep talking. until they get here. then...}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i have no life anymore. i ruined your life, make me pay for it.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{why did you do that? didn't you have any idea how hard it was for me, to get that far? i worshipped you. you inspired me. i thought you could understand me the way you understood the others. i knew that about you the ones you admired were the great murderers; they fascinated you.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{that's not who i admire i admire people who are good at what they do, great artists, writers, thinkers...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i don't have the talent for any of those things. all i have a talent for is death. and i am one of a kind. what do you think of your student now? i have made you famous, i am your creation and your monument.}
<B>__{behind him a shadowy figure darts from hiding spot to a}
<A>__{vantage point: we can't make out the figure... helen sees}
<B>__{but peter does not.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{if you let me, i can make you more famous than any of them.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{oh, please. i know what's coming, now. "let me help you..."}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{do anything you want to me. i give myself to you. only put the knife down. isn't this what you always wanted? i know it's what we all want, to love and to loved. i could love you. you could work together in some safe place, learn to really understand you, help you, give you some peace of mind, some happiness...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{back in the driver's seat again, doctor? that old dream study us to see what makes us sick. so you can find a cure they'd name it after you? death is the only cure for people like me.}
<A>__{he leans toward her with the knife. this might be the moment. his gun lies on the floor beside him. her eyes have flicked to the shadow behind him; he sees it and stoops to pick up the gun and fires into the shadows, two or three quick rounds. he turns back to helen, dropping}
<B>__{the gun to reach for the knife.}
<A>__{helen head butts him with astonishing strength, knocking him}
<B>__{backward. she stands... he comes up with gun... and aims at her... behind him m.j. steps out of the shadows having now a clean shot.}
<A>__{helen doesn't give a clue, just looks into peter's eyes as}
<B>__{m.j. and peter in slow motion details as she lines up her}
<A>__{shot: she could kill him or go for the exposed shoulder.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{do it. for god's sake, now ...}
<B>__{m.j. fires.}
<A>__{peter is spun away from helen by the impact, stands there,}
<B>__{shaking with the shock of the hit... he stares at her.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(surprised, like a child)}
<D>__{you hurt me!}
<A>__{m.j. holds her gun on him, ready to shoot again, but he just goes down on one knee, his body violently shuddering... as:}
<B>__{there is a huge sound of breaking glass and then an enormous explosion that throws them to the ground.}
<A>__{the big front doors are blasted open, and the flak vested}
<B>__{swat team swarms through... smoke from the concussion grenade swirls in the chiaroscuro of floodlights and shadows.}
<A>__{out of the smoke come ski masked swat men...}
<D>__{m.j. & helen no!!}
<A>__{peter turns to the swat team, offering himself, as the women scream to the swat men's wounded and harmless...}
<B>__{a pattern of red dots from laser beam sights on the swat}
<A>__{team rifles dapple peter's head and torso.}
<B>__{swat team like a firing squad the team fires.}
