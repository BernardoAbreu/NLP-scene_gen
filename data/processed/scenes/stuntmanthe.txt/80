<A>__{he watches for a moment with hopeless longing. finally, turning from her, he looks about at the dark water and deserted boardwalk. there come some of eli's crew, laughing, joking, cutting a swatch through the stillness, pushing their heavy brutes toward some nearby spot to light a night shot. there's the church tower. he stares at it, wavering in his resolve to leave, wondering what would happen if...}
<C>__{nina's voice}
<D>__{what next? do you rescue the maiden from the tower?}
<A>__{she has come up behind him, unnoticed. he turns, startled, and there she stands.}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{for a moment they search each other's eyes for intentions. then she glances at the tower.}
<C>__{nina}
<D>__{yes. it does look pretty high.}
<P>__{(with concern)}
<D>__{are you worried about tomorrow?}
<A>__{cameron's mind is racing over all the things he'd like to say so she would know him instantly. but his answer is simple and sounds sincere.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{not much. i guess if there were any real danger, eli wouldn't let me do it, would he?}

<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{she understands the slightly jealous rebuke for her blind faith in eli. her laughing answer hangs like a challenge.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{well, come on.}
<C>__{nina}
<P>__{(willing, but flustered)}
<D>__{what, right now?}
<A>__{for a moment he weighs it: whether to "run" or stay. then acts on his decision. starting to laugh, he takes her hand and pulls her toward the tower. she holds back, struggling playfully.}
<C>__{nina }
<D>__{wait, i'm afraid of heights! what if i freeze up?}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(pulling her along)}
<D>__{don't worry, i will give you a push. isn't that what a pal's for?}
