<L>__{exterior road day}
<A>__{sissy makes little puffs of dust as she walks. from the direction of the ranch a vw microbus is approaching. it is painted with mandalas, lamaistic dorjes and symbols representing "the clear light of the void." when the microbus draws alongside sissy it stops. inside are two men and a woman. they are approximately twenty four years old.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{are you a pilgrim?}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{no, i'm more of an indian the trio doesn't smile.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{she means are you going to see the chink?}
<C>__{sissy}
<D>__{oh, i may and i may not. but seeing him is not my main objective out here.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{that's good. because he won't see you. we came all the way from minneapolis to see him and the crazy bastard tried to stone us to death}
<C>__{other man}
<D>__{yeah, but i no longer believe that guy's a master. he's just a dirty, uptight old mountain man. why, he pulled out his pecker and shook it at barbara. i'd stay away from there if i were you, lady.}
<A>__{sissy walks on leaving the people in the bus arguing about whether the chink's rock shower and pecker wag actually had been intended as spiritual messages.}
