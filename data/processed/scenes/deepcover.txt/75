<L>__{interior betty's office night}
<A>__{a bill counter toting up the cash. she watches it fixedly to avoid looking at him, but she feels the chemistry.}
<C>__{mccutcheon}
<D>__{why do you look at me like that?}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{how do i look at you?}
<C>__{mccutcheon}
<D>__{like you know something i don't. like you're better than me.}
<A>__{that catches hull off guard, and he responds with a candor she didn't expect.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{i don't think i'm better than you. i don't think i'm better than anybody.}
<A>__{she's startled by this remark and instinctively drawn to him.}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{but i do know something... you can't stop thinking about me.}
<A>__{embarrassed, she looks away. he takes her hand, and at his touch something yields to her. she lets him draw her to him. his kiss is strangely tender, searching. it turns betty on incredibly. she melts into him.}
<C>__{mccutcheon}
<D>__{let's go back here...}
<A>__{she leads him into...}
<B>__{the small office}
<A>__{she's sweet and loving, but her sweetness scares her. he's all over her, but she pulls back for a moment. there is a couch and before it a coffee table with coke scattered on a plate.}
<C>__{mccutcheon}
<P>__{(indicates coke)}
<D>__{do this... do it with me.}
<A>__{she offers him a straw. he doesn't take it.}
<C>__{mccutcheon}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{this is where i'm at. you want to be with me, it's gotta be there.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{i don't do that.}
<C>__{mccutcheon}
<D>__{never have, never will.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{it's for fuck ups.}
<C>__{mccutcheon}
<D>__{what do you think, you're not a nigger? you're a nigger as much as me.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{more.}
<A>__{she's angry, hurt, confused, wants to love him, but feels he won't let her, or she won't let herself. it's torment. finally she's released by a knock on the door. she goes out to...}
<B>__{the front of the store}
<A>__{lets in elias. he smells the tension.}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(amused, jealous)}
<D>__{having fun?}
<P>__{(neither answers; to hull)}
<D>__{i talked to barbosa. he'll see us now.}
<A>__{hull turns to betty. both want to go that way instead of this, but events are leading somewhere else. he follows elias out.}
