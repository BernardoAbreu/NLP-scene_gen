<A>__{joey is alone at the control desk. she has a video tape in her hand and feeds it into the master machine. she looks up at the still ghosting monitors and then presses a few buttons on the console. the snow is replaced by blackness on every monitor with a time code ticking away at the bottom of each screen.}

<A>__{the blackness on the monitors gives way to multiple images of kirsty, the girl in the picture in the antique store. the video image is primitive, shot with a non professional camcorder, and is a simple medium long shot of kirsty, dressed in a simple white smock, sitting in a hospital room. kirsty addresses the camera directly, though occasionally looks up to the side as if speaking to an unseen doctor.}
