<C>__{burger shack employee}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{there used to be a white castle right in this spot. where is it?}
<C>__{burger shack employee}
<P>__{(remembering)}
<D>__{oh yeah. there was a white castle here. look guys, i hate to be the bearer of bad news, but burger shack bought this location four years ago.}
<A>__{harold and kumar look at each other, devastated.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{please tell me there's another white castle in town.}
<C>__{burger shack employee}
<D>__{nope.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<C>__{burger shack employee}
<D>__{do i look like the type of guy who would be unsure about something like this?}
<A>__{harold and kumar are freaking out.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{shit. what are we gonna do?}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{i don't know. should we just eat here?}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{do you really think that'll satisfy us?}
<A>__{the burger shack employee senses their desperation.}
<C>__{burger shack employee}
<D>__{there's a 24 hour white castle in cherry hill, about forty five minutes away.}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(to harold)}
<D>__{i can make the trip if you're willing to.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{kumar, i have a shitload of work to finish. and you have that med school interview in the morning.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{forget about the med school interview. it's a non issue.}
<C>__{burger shack employee}
<D>__{if i may interject for a moment...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i've been an employee here for three years now, and if there's one thing i've learned, it's that when you're craving white castle, the burgers here simply won't cut it.}
<P>__{(in his own little world)}
<D>__{in fact, just thinking about those tender little white castle burgers and those grilled onions makes me want to burn this place to the ground and re build a white castle in its place.}
<P>__{(back to reality)}
<D>__{if i were you, i'd suck it up and make the trip.}
<A>__{kumar looks at harold. the guy makes a convincing case. harold is clearly torn. we sense that this is an important moment for the guys...}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(enticing harold)}
<D>__{you can always do your work in the car.}
<A>__{harold thinks for a moment, then licks his lips.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{let's do it.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{then it's settled. no matter what, we're not ending this night without white castle in our stomachs. agreed?}
<A>__{kumar puts his hand out. harold shakes it.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{agreed.}
<C>__{burger shack employee}
<D>__{wise choice. besides, you wouldn't want to go near our special sauce tonight. some of the guys and i added an extra ingredient, if you know what i mean.}
<A>__{harold and kumar look confused.}
<C>__{burger shack employee}
<D>__{i will give you a hinterior..}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{it's semen.}
<A>__{we hear harold and kumar scream in disgust as harold's infiniti zooms out of the drive thru...}
