<A>__{the juggernaut grinds to a stop. but the roar of engines continues because more dozers and tractors advance nearby, crushing the forest before them. trees are slashed down by the plasma cutters. terrified animals flee before the onslaught. powersuits and troopers stride through the ravaged forest, blasting anything that moves. a trooper sees jake on the dozer. he rips off a burst and rounds clang into metal as jake dives off the machine. he grabs neytiri and they run into concealing foliage. from behind a screen of leaves, they watch as the dozers advance, obliterating the sacred site, leaving only mud and wood splinters in their path. cu neytiri, stunned by the nightmarish, unfathomable wrongness of it. she sobs as the willows die.}
