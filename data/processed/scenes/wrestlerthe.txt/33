<C>__{randy }
<D>__{long time no see.}

<C>__{randy }
<D>__{whatcha doing here? here to root on your old man?}
<A>__{she shakes her head no.}
<C>__{randy }

<D>__{tonight's forecast calls for severe butt whoopin's with a 100 percent chance of pain.}
<A>__{psyched "yeah!"s from the meatheads. stephanie is pissed at the interruption. and, even more, randy's embrace of it.}
<D>__{meathead #1 could we get a picture?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{no problemo.}
<A>__{the two meatheads flank randy, their arms around his broad shoulders. meathead #1 looks tentatively at stephanie, holding up his digital camera.}
<D>__{meathead #1 think you could...?}
<A>__{she coldly takes it.}
<C>__{stephanie}
<D>__{no problemo.}
<A>__{she looks into the camera. the meatheads stick their tongues out and throw up devil signs. randy flexes theatrically, making his best "aaargh!" wrestling face. stephanie snaps a shot. meathead #1 takes back his camera. he and his buddy pat randy heartily on the back.}
<D>__{meathead #1 thanks a lot, yo. kick some ass out there.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{you know it, broski!}
<A>__{the meatheads excitedly head off. randy turns his attention back to stephanie, who's glaring at him with cold disgust.}
