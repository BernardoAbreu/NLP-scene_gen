<L>__{exterior boat deck night}
<A>__{lightoller has his boats swung out. he is standing amidst a crowd of uncertain passengers in all states of dress and undress. one first class woman is barefoot. others are in stockings. the maitre of the restaurant is in top hat and overcoat. others are still in evening dress, while some are in bathrobes and kimonos. women are wearing lifebelts over velvet gowns, then topping it with sble stoles. some brought jewels, others books, even small dogs. lightoller sees smith walking stiffly toward him and quickly goes to him. he yells into the captain's ear, through cupped hands, over the roar of the steam...}
<C>__{lightoller}
<A>__{hadn't we better get the women and children into the boats, sir? smith just nods, a bit abstractly. the fire has gone out of him. lightoller sees the awesome truth in smith's face.}
<C>__{lightoller}
<P>__{(to the men)}
<A>__{right! start the loading. women and children! the appalling din of escaping steam abruptly cuts off, leaving a sudden unearthly silence in which lightoller's voice echoes. on wallace hartley raising his violin to play.}

<A>__{number 26. ready and the band has reassembled just outside the first class entrance, port side, near where lightoller is calling for the boats to be loaded. they strike up a waltz, lively and elegant. the music wafts all over the ship.}
<C>__{lightoller}
<A>__{ladies, please. step into the boat. finally one soman steps across the gap, into the boat, terrified of the drop to the water far below.}
<C>__{woman in crowd}
<A>__{you watch. they'll put us off in these silly little boats to freeze, and we'll all be back on board by breakfast. cal, rose and ruth come out of the doors near the band.}
<C>__{ruth}
<A>__{my brooch, i left my brooch. i must have it! she turns back to go to her room but cal takes her by the arm, refusing to let her go. the firmness of his hold surprises her.}
<C>__{cal}
<A>__{stay here, ruth. ruth sees his expression, and knows fear for the first time.}
