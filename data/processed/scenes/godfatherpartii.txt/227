<C>__{michael}
<D>__{how did they get their hands on pentangeli?}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{roth engineered it, michael. he made pentangeli think you hit him. deliberately letting him get off alive. then the new york detectives turned frankie over to the fbi. my informants say he was half dead and scared stiff talking out loud that you had turned on him and tried to kill him. anyway, they had him on possession, dealing in heroin, murder one and a lot more. there's no way we can get to him and you've opened yourself to five points of perjury.}
<C>__{neri}
<D>__{they've got him airtight. he's in a military base, twenty four hour guards. trying to kill him is like trying to like the president it's impossible.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{what does fredo know?}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{he says he doesn't know anything, and i believe him. roth played this one beautifully.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{alright. i'm going to go outside and talk to fredo.}
