<L>__{exterior pizza shop morning}
<A>__{jimmy is carrying several full insulated pizza carrying bags, with several brown lunch bags full of food on top. although the pile looks unwieldy, jimmy has no trouble with it. he places the pile on the roof of his piece of shit, opens the passenger door, and places the pile on the passenger seat. he closes the door, and pulls a delivery list out of his pocket to examine while walking around to the driver's side. jimmy gets into the driver's seat and pulls out his cell phone.}
