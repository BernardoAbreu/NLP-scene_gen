<D>__{christ. that was close.}
<C>__{sherman}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{nothing. caroline pays $351 for this place. it's rent controlled. i sublet it for eleven hundred a month. but it's not legal. they would love to get caroline out of here. but they have to prove she doesn't live here.}
<C>__{sherman}

<C>__{maria}
<D>__{oh, sherman. you are completely paranoidical. look, i have to leave for the airport in twenty minutes. so we don't have much time.}
<C>__{sherman}
<D>__{you don't think they could possibly trace the car to me?}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{how? they don't have the full number, they don't have a witness, and the only one who could recognize you is in terminal comatosis.}
<C>__{sherman}
<D>__{right. there is the other boy, however. suppose he came forward.}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{if he was gonna materialize, he would have done it by now. and the reason he hasn't, is because he's a criminal. would you get my blue jacket out of that closet?}
<A>__{sherman gets the jacket. maria starts putting a painting into her portfolio.}
<C>__{sherman}
<D>__{what a wretched painting.}
<C>__{maria}
