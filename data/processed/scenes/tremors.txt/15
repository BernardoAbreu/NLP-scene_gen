<A>__{at one end of town, earl maneuvers a huge bulldozer with a scoop loader blade through a choking cloud of dust, scouring out a shallow pit to serve as a watering hole. val sights down a row of stakes which mark one end of the pit. the job is done. he signals earl to cut the engine. both men have kerchiefs covering their faces and are totally encrusted with dust. angle truck trailer day nearby is an old battered truck trailer the massive, solid steel kind used for heavy rock hauling. tires flat, mired in dried mud and weeds, it hasn't been used in years. now it provides welcome shade as the men sit sipping some coffee. nestor cunningham drives up, surveying the pit with approval.}

<C>__{earl}
<D>__{no, we're not too easy going. this area is economically depressed.}
<A>__{val realizes he has the key and hands it over.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{so what if we just did it...today. pack up. drive straight down to bixby. get serious.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{we could. we could. but we'd have to get really serious. it's gonna cost twice as much to rent a place.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{so? that car wash pays good, and they're always looking.}
<C>__{earl}
