<A>__{west slides under the train! he lies flat as the death machine roars over him. at the last second, he lassos the rope around the rear axle. it slows him for a beat... then stretches. he's gotten gordon's trick rope. we see his silent scream "artemus!" he slides way behind the tank train, then springs back... past the tank train. finally, west slides back underneath and manages to grab hold of their caboose. he swings his legs up, pulls himself around onto the step.}
