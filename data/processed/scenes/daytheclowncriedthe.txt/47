<A>__{the same guard is motioning for the men to hurry and get outside... he is standing at the doorway to the barracks and the men are moving out into the ice cold morning as briskly as they can... the guard moves inside after the last man has made his exit...}
<L>__{interior barracks day}
<A>__{shooting over the guard as he looks around, we see keltner coming out of the toilet area, rushing because he's late... he throws his towel on his bunk, and as he does... he sees what stops him in his tracks... keltner's pov it is helmut still sound asleep in his bunk...}

<D>__{reverend, let him sleep... you move out, i will take care of this...}
<A>__{keltner reluctantly starts to move out towards the front door, as the guard passes him on his way to helmut's bunk... keltner goes out the door... the guard sneaks over towards the bunk where helmut is asleep and very sneakily slips the cover off helmut's body... then proceeds to open the window above his head and the window alongside... and across the way and opens the back door... which is adjacent to the toilet area... and walks out of the barracks leaving the front door wide open...}
