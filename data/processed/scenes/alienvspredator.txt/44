<L>__{interior pyramid entrance chamber}
<A>__{the team walks into an entrance that is located half way up the pyramid. lex illuminates a pictogram showing two creatures locked in combat (an alien and predator). she looks down and takes a bearing on her digital compass. above the entrance are three lines of ancient hieroglyphics.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{i recognize the egyptian. not the other two.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{the second line is aztec. pre conquest era. third is cambodian. looks like a mixture of bantu and sanskrit.}
<A>__{sebastian catches lex watching him.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{impressed?}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{then you were right. the pyramid does contain all three cultures?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{that's what it looks like.}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{this goes against every history book that's ever been written.}
<C>__{thomas}
<P>__{(translating first line)}
<D>__{...you may choose to enter. those who choose may enter.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{it's like an ancient welcome mat.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<P>__{(stepping forward)}
<D>__{who taught you to translate?}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{funny, he looks just like you.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{it's not "choose," partner, it's "chosen."}
<A>__{sebastian steps up to examine the writing more closely.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{only the...chosen ones may enter.}
<A>__{verheiden takes the first step through the entrance, stepping on an ornate stone tile which sinks ever so slightly into the ground. a hidden trigger of some kind. no one notices as the team enter one by one.}
