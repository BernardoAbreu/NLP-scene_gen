<A>__{series of shots. skip and mumford move through a maze of hallways with progressively less foot traffic.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{i've never brought anyone down here before.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i'm honored.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{doc, there's something about what you told me the other night i can't get out of my head. it's driving me batty }
<P>__{(mumford nods, waits)}
<D>__{why me? how did you know you could trust me?}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{you're completely reliable.}
<A>__{skip is pleased. they approach a heavy steel door, the entrance to skip's workshop. a very old security aide sits at the end of the intersecting hallway, watching this area. skip shouts down there }
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{it's just me, dino!}
<A>__{the old man nods, barely awake.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{skip, i've got a problem and i need some advice.}
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{you want my advice? far out!}
<A>__{skip puts his hand in a scanning device in the wall. some lights blink and the heavy metal door pops open a few inches. skip has to put all his weight into opening the door. he hesitates, suddenly concerned }
<C>__{skip}
<D>__{i hope nothing you're about to see will shake your faith in me.}
<A>__{mumford reassures him with a look. skip pushes the door open far enough for them to enter, then pulls it closed behind them.}
