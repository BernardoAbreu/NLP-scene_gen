<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{follow shot. shorty dodges through the crowd with his packages. his smile is one of anticipation. he nods to a pal without stopping; eyes a couple of chicks dancing on the street, but is not dissuaded.}
<L>__{interior barber shop day}
<A>__{shorty has his jacket and hat off, his sleeves rolled up. he is like a surgeon preparing for an operation. his equipment is spread out on a table: can of lye, large mason jar, wooden stirring spoon, knife, the eggs. his actions have the character of a ritual: each thing being done just so, in time honored fashion. he slices the potatoes and drops the thin slices into the mason jar. he adds water and makes a paste of the starch. behind shorty is a spirited barbershop conversation. one man is}
<P>__{getting a haircut; two others are watching (toomer, jason)}
<A>__{one of them from behind a newspaper. a middle aged barber, cholly, is doing most of the talking.}
<C>__{cholly}
<D>__{after i hit the number that woman wasn't no good to me at all.}
<A>__{the men laugh. angle shorty pries open the can of lye, whiffs it. it's good and strong. he pours some in the mason jar, stirring with the wooden spoon. he cracks the eggs into the mixture and stirs. he waits as fumes rise and feels the outside of the jar as it gets hot. another angle the barbershop seen from a door, slightly ajar. a woolly head, entirely in shadow, peers out.}
<C>__{cholly's voice}
<D>__{she says i'm cheap cuz i won't cop her a diamond ring. had the indignation to call me a cheap black sunovabitch to boot.}
<C>__{toomer}
<D>__{and when a black woman call you a cheap black sunovabitch you've been called a cheap black sunovabitch.}
<A>__{cholly is annoyed. it's _his_ story.}
<C>__{cholly}
<D>__{will you let me tell it?}
<A>__{on shorty he opens the bulky package he has been carrying, unfolds a large rubber apron and gets into it. now he dons a pair of}
<D>__{rubber gloves.}
<C>__{shorty}
<D>__{where's homeboy?}
<A>__{he is all ready; one of his hands is filled with a huge glob of vaseline. his manner is indignant as if he were asking the whereabouts of an exasperating child.}
<C>__{cholly}
<D>__{red's in the head, man.}
<C>__{toomer}
<D>__{you mean hiding in the head.}
<C>__{cholly}
<D>__{hey, red. your man's here and waiting on you.}
<A>__{his hands full, cholly opens the door with his feet and malcolm comes out, a big, gawky, bright faced country boy, wearing downhome clothes and an expression of apprehension.}
<C>__{toomer}
<D>__{gonna get that first conk laid on, hunh, homeboy?}
<C>__{cholly}
<D>__{man, don't scare him more than he's scared already. ain't too bad...}
<A>__{malcolm allows himself to be led to an empty chair, where cholly drapes him with a double sheet, tucking it tightly around his neck and adding a protective collar of paper.}
<C>__{cholly}
<A>__{...like anything else. first time a chick gets her cherry popped, she might put up a little fight. but pretty soon you can't give her enough. right, homeboy? close malcolm malcolm gulps, his eyes on the fuming mason jar. shorty starts massaging a great quantity of vaseline into malcolm's scalp, covering his neck and ears as well. all the men have gathered}
<D>__{around, involved in the ritual. for malcolm it is closer to being a}
<A>__{kind of execution.}
<C>__{cholly}
<D>__{git his forehead and eyebrows.}
<C>__{shorty}
<D>__{i know what i'm doing.}
<A>__{shorty applies the vaseline to that area. now he brings over the steaming jar and places it nearby.}
<C>__{shorty }
<D>__{listen. you pull my coat if it's still stinging when i get through 'cause this shit can burn a hole through cement.}
<C>__{cholly}
<D>__{hold tight, baby, and keep your eyes shut.}
<A>__{malcolm nods his head, clenches his eyes and grits his teeth. shorty applies the congolene with a comb, working it into malcolm's hair. close malcolm}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i thought you said it was gonna sting... this ain't nothin'.}
<A>__{for a moment nothing happens, then the heat hits him. he yells, tries to catch his breath: his head is on fire.}
<C>__{malcolm }
<D>__{you motherfucker. you're killing me. i'm burning up. my damn head is on fire.}
<A>__{he nearly leaps out of the chair, but the barber restrains him. shorty, utterly unmoved by the outburst, continues working the congolene into his hair. malcolm breaks out of the chair wildly. but the three men drag him to a basin where shorty has attached the shower spray. his cries filling the room, malcolm is ducked under the spray. shorty starts rinsing out his hair.}
<C>__{shorty}
<D>__{don't fight me, man. let me git it out.}
<A>__{malcolm is a little relieved, he tentatively opens his eyes, then he feels the congolene again and there is another outburst. shorty forces his head under the spray, spurts the water all over his head, wetting malcolm and the shop in the process.}
