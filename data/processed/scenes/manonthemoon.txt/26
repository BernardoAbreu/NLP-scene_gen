<L>__{interior meditation institute university, classroom day}
<A>__{the light is magical. soothing sitar music plays. andy and fifteen other barefoot students sit on mats in a semi circle. eyes shut, bodies in different yoga positions, they are all meditating. facing them on a throne like chair sits a reverent, indian yogi. at his feet is the class teacher, little wendy, a teeny lady with an absurdly high pitched voice.}
<C>__{little wendy}
<D>__{now, while continuing your deep breathing, slowly open your eyes. you should feel rested, relaxed, and alert.}
<A>__{the students all open their eyes.}
<C>__{yogi}
<D>__{do any thoughts come...? student #1 my mind is clear. i feel great.}
<C>__{yogi}
<D>__{good... student #2 all the tension is gone from my body.}
<A>__{the yogi's eyes go to andy. andy smiles sweetly.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{i want to thank you, your holiness. my heart is radiating with pure energy.}
<A>__{the yogi nods kindly.}
<C>__{yogi}
<D>__{you always had a good heart. but i'm proud of the progress you've made in your discipline.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{yes. tm got me focused. in fact, my manager got me a tv gig! it's just some new show with no budget, but i'm still excited.}
<A>__{oh. the yogi peers intently.}
<C>__{yogi}
<D>__{are you at peace with your family?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{um, yes. i haven't fought with them, since i started here.}
<C>__{yogi}
<D>__{goals are important.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{i stopped drinking. i gave up drugs. and i'm meditating three hours a day. it's the center of my life...}
<C>__{yogi}
<D>__{we are all impressed.}
<A>__{andy smiles beatifically. this means a lot.}
<C>__{little wendy}
<D>__{okay. anyone else ?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{oh, wait! i have a question.}
<P>__{(beat; working up his nerve)}
<D>__{is there... is there a secret to being funny?}
<A>__{huh? the yogi thinks hard... squinching up his face. then... he finally speaks.}
<C>__{yogi}
<D>__{yes. silence.}
