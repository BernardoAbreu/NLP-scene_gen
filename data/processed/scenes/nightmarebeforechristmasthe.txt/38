<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior town square. dusk.}
<A>__{the mayor lies sprawled on top of his hearse, staring up at the sky for ideas. he's exhausted, as are the assembled citizens of halloweenland, exhausted from exhausting their alternatives when it comes to seeking jack. the mayor lifts his heavy head and feebly asks:}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{did anybody think to dredge the lake?}
<A>__{a recumbent corpse sits up and nods:}
<C>__{corpse}
<D>__{this morning.}
<A>__{the corpse flops down again. the mayor lets his head fall back. in the distance, there's a bark (o.s.)}
<D>__{witch #1 hear that? witch #2 what?}
<A>__{now a deep rumbling (o.s.) can just be heard punctuated by another sharp bark (o.s.)}
<D>__{witch #3 ssh!}
<A>__{they listen. more rumbling. definite barks now.}
<C>__{vampire}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{zero?!}
<A>__{the sounds get louder, closer... the group revives. the mayor sits up. before long...}
<B>__{around the corner}
<A>__{comes an ecstatic jack driving a jaunty, christmasland snow mobile, heavily laden with christmasland memorabilia. a joyous zero loops the loop around his master.}
<C>__{mayor and various citizens}
<D>__{look! it's jack!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm back!}
<A>__{the halloweenland citizens gape.}
<C>__{vampire}
<D>__{where've you been?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i can't wait to tell all of you all about it!}
<P>__{(to the mayor)}
<D>__{mayor! call us a town meeting!}
