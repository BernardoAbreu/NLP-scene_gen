<A>__{michael and suzy in michael's office, classical music in the background. michael's clearing his desk, putting stuff in boxes. jamie bursts in on michael and suzy, his phone still on.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{right, frank and nancy sinatra. i've got good news. you're not fired. that's great news, isn't it?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{that sounds ominous.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{he's fucking delighted.}
<P>__{(cancels phone)}
<D>__{we want to put liza weld's pwip pip out there, properly. in the public domain. we just have to refine it a bit.}
<C>__{suzy}
<D>__{refine it?}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{take out the cons, change the name of the main informant.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{that's a complete fabrication.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{changing his name doesn't make a difference. the main source in there he's not really called ice man, is he? "mr and mrs man, you've got a son, ice." so we change it, to another name. who's the fuck with the fiddle? the fiddlefuck.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{this is debussy, if that's what you mean.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{okay, we'll call him debussy.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{and then you'll make a couple of other changes. it'll mean your fingerprints are on it, mikey, but it's the only way to save your job, you leaky fuck.}
<A>__{michael is now scared of what he's being asked to do.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{it wasn't me, jamie, alright? it wasn't me. don't make me do this. someone else must have come in and used the fax machine.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{what? oh, that thing about your fax? don't worry about that. i made that up. the paper was sent by e mail. it;s just, the fax machine was there and it;s easier to kick.}
<A>__{michael looks at suzy. she doesn't know what to say or do.}
<C>__{jamie }
<P>__{(grabbing michael)}
<D>__{come on deuce bigalow. you're coming with me.}
