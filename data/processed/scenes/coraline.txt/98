<A>__{miss forcible grabs another dish of old stuck together candy and puts it in front of coraline.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{how is hundred year old candy going to help }
<A>__{miss spink suddenly raises her knitting needles as if to stab coraline. coraline yelps, hands up in defense. but it's candies she attacks, sending sticky chips flying, making loud grunts as she stabs. she pulls a large, three sided candy with a hole it from the rubble and passes it to coraline.}
<C>__{miss spink}
<D>__{there you go, sweety.}
<A>__{coraline studies the odd candy.}
