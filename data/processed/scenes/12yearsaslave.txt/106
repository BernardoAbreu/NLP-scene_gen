<L>__{interior master epps's plantation slave shack night}
<A>__{we come up on the slaves who lay sleeping. all except for patsey. she rises from her bedding, goes to a corner of the cabin and removes something from a secretive location. she then moves over to platt.}
<C>__{patsey}
<D>__{platt... platt, you awake?}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{i am.}
<C>__{patsey}
<D>__{i have a request; an act of kindness.}
<A>__{patsey displays what she took from hiding. it is a lady's finger ring.}
<C>__{patsey }
<D>__{i secreted it from the mistress.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{return it!}
<C>__{patsey}
<D>__{it yours, platt.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{for what cause?}
<C>__{patsey}
<D>__{all i ask: end my life. take my body to the margin of the swamp }
<A>__{solomon looks at patsey as though she were insane.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{patsey}
<D>__{take me by the throat. hold me low in the water until i's still 'n without life. bury me in a lonely place of dyin'.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{no! i will do no such thing. the...the gory detail with which you speak }
<C>__{patsey}
<D>__{i thought on it long and hard.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{it is melancholia, nothing more. how does such despair even come to you?}
<C>__{patsey}
<D>__{how can you not know? i got no comfort in this life. if i cain't buy mercy from yah, i will beg it.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{there are others. beg them.}
<C>__{patsey}
<D>__{i'm begging you!}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{why? why would you consign me to damnation with such an un godly request?}
<C>__{patsey}
<D>__{there is god here! god is merciful, and he forgive merciful acts. won't be no hell for you. do it. do what i ain't got the strength ta do myself.}
<A>__{solomon says nothing. clearly he's not about to do the deed. with nothing else to do, knowing she is damned with every breath she draws, patsey crawls back to her spot on the floor and lays herself down.}
