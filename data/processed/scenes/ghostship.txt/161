<A>__{as dodge makes his way up, he's forced to climb onto the other side of the crane to keep from dangling over the water. above, greer casts a line. it falls near, but out of reach as the swell of the water starts to swing the crane to and fro. dodge reaches out for the line again, his hand coming close but not close enough. the swell brings the crane toward the boat one last time and dodge reaches out, his fingers just coming to the line, coaxing it into his grasp. he pulls it back and hangs on, as the crane sways back with the foundering boat. the crane falls away from dodge, leaving him hanging in space by the line from the bow of the chimera.}

<A>__{as he pulls himself upward, coming to the bottom of the rail well on the chimera where murphy reaches out, just short of dodge's hand. a screeching sounds and they turn to see the twin tow cables coming taught against the hull in the anchor alley's of the chimera as the sinking tug pulls them tight. with a concussive strike, one cable is freed, snapping against the chimera's hull like a giant steel guitar string. it starts sliding along the hull as the tug drifts, pulling the cable with it, toward dodge as he dangles in mid air. dodge pulls himself up, reaching for murphy, but still short. a loud hissing sounds and dodge turns to see misty air escaping from ports and deck vents as the encroaching water forces it out of the tug below decks. the tow cable loudly scrapes the hull in a shower of rust, as dodge struggles to pull himself up. murphy reaches out as dodge extends as far as he can, their hands barely reaching. the tow cable is a mere few feet away and closing, ready to scrape dodge into the water or smear him across the hull like a bug on a windshield, when dodge pulls himself up with everything he's got and murphy grabs his hand. murphy pulls, lifting dodge, as greer grabs dodge's other hand and they pull him up, the tow cable sweeping by with a}

<A>__{dodge turns to see the bow of the tug dip below the surface, slowly going under until disappearing with a last exhalation of misty air. the pilothouse is next to go, the last of it slipping into the frothing water, then the crane, finally disappearing altogether into the depths. a long beat as they hold there in the sudden silence, phantom bubbles rising to the surface where the tug once stood.}
