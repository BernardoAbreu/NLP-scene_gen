<A>__{unclipping from the line, she closes the door on the howling behind her. pulls off her mask. teeth are chattering. she spins the wheel lock of the door going out of the ready room into the building.}

<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{mooney? hello?}
<A>__{only silence responds. the hallway is long and dark, leading away from her in both directions. she draws a flashlight from her pocket. thumbs the switch, sending a beam out through the dark. something doesn't feel right. slides her baton out from her belt. she decides to go left. walking the hall, she tries door after door. finally one gives.}
<C>__{carrie }
<D>__{mooney?}
<A>__{she cautiously pushes it open: four stripped bunks in an empty room. moves on down the corridor hears coughing, like someone trying to clear their throat. looks ahead, and determines it's coming from behind a closed door at the end of the hall. it's confirmed when she hears it again. stops at the door. she slowly opens it now she can hear heavy, labored breathing sweeps the inside with her light. it's a large lounge type room: scattered chairs, tables, and an overturned sofa on the other side where the heavy breathing's coming from. another cough. she enters the room. inside the lounge continuous inching forward, she gets to the sofa. looks over it to see a body it's mooney, lying in a pool of blood. struggling to breathe through a puncture wound to his esophagus.}

<D>__{...my god.}
<A>__{she goes to him. as she kneels, he grabs her, gasping for air, trying to tell her something. carrie catches a reflection of moment behind her in his eyes someone's coming at her. she instinctively rolls back over mooney just as wham! an ice axe swings down at her. just misses her head by an inch, but the shaft nails her arm holding the baton that goes clattering across the floor. the killer, wearing ecw gear with hood and goggles, takes another swing. she lunges to the side. axe misses her, but sinks into mooney. game over for him. carrie slices the floor with her light, looking for the baton, but can't see it. the killer yanks his axe free of mooney as carrie bolts around the sofa, heading back out the door.}
