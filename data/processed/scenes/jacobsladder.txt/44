<L>__{interior jacob's kitchen day}
<A>__{jacob, unshaven, wearing his bathrobe, is sitting at the kitchen table. piles of books on demonology are spread out before him. he studies them to distraction. jezzie is standing by the counter making sandwiches. she wraps them in plastic baggies and puts one in a lunch box, another in the refrigerator. she is dressed in her postal uniform.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{you know, you really ought to get out today. you can't just sit around like this all the time. it's not healthy. it's not good for your mind. go take a walk, or somethin'. go to a movie. christ, who's gonna know? you think i care? i don't give a shit. go. enjoy yourself. one of us should be having a good time.}
<P>__{(jezzie knocks on jacob's head)}
<D>__{hello! anybody home?}
<P>__{(she looks in his ear)}
<D>__{anybody in there?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{jezzie just stares at him. she does not respond. jacob returns to his books.}
