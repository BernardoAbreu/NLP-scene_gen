<D>__{stop, he's one of the circus mice!}
<A>__{with a swift blow of its paw, the cat knocks the mouse into the air, and catches it in his mouth. he gives a quick, killing bite coraline gasps and the mouse transforms into a big dead rat. coraline is stunned. he drops the rat on the ground.}

<A>__{coraline, standing in front of the living room doors, tests the cane in her hands, and peers down the hall for danger. it's dead quiet no piano, no sounds of anything. she jams the cane through the doors' handles, and pulls with all her might. one handle and lock break and the door swings open into the pitch black living room. the hall light casts a narrow path directly to the other little door on the far wall, cracked open. she steps into the room.}
<L>__{interior other living room continuous}
<A>__{a huge armoire bug suddenly crab steps in her path, blocking the little door, and all around her things start to glow. the room has been transformed into an amazing bug museum, with all sorts of glowing, living specimens in the place of the old furniture and furnishings. the radiators are now big caterpillars, the nordic track a serving bug. the other mother speaks out, startling coraline.}

<A>__{she extends a candy dish filled living chocolate beetles.}
<C>__{other mother }
