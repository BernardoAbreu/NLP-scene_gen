<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{what's your problem? allison opens her sandwich and and tosses the meat up. it lands on the sculpture above. she opens some pixie stix and pours the sugar on the sandwich and then puts cap'n crunch on top of that. she crushes the sandwich together and loudly eats it. bender goes over and sits by brian, bender takes brian's bag lunch.}

<C>__{bender}
<D>__{do you believe this? huh? it's about the size of a cigar...do i stutter? you see, this is what you get in my house when you spill paint in the garage. bender begins to walk away.}
<C>__{bender}
<D>__{see i don't think that i need to sit here with you fuckin' dildos anymore! bender walks over to a map table and throws all the maps on the floor. he climbs up on top of the table and then up to the second floor balcony.}
