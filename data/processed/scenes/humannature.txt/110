<A>__{puff's pov: through some brush we watch nathan and lila hiking. we hear puff's loud heavy breathing and, in the distance, the relentless gibberish chatter of nathan and lila. puff moves. lila glances over.}

<A>__{we're with lila and nathan now. lila has stopped and is peering into the distance.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{did you see that?}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i don't know. something.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{a deer?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{no. too... upright. might've been a person.}
<C>__{nathan}
<P>__{(nervously)}
<D>__{it might behoove us to turn back at this pointerior}
<A>__{lila walks in the direction of the sighting.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{come on.}
<C>__{nathan}
<P>__{(not budging)}
<D>__{if it's a person, why should we go see it? it's not like it's nature or anything. it's just a person.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{sometimes people who live in the woods don't want to be seen. they live in the woods because they're anti social, lila. we have to respect that.}
<A>__{lila trudges through the brush. nathan follows. better than being left behind.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{this is the way to get ticks, lila. this is it. bingo! lyme disease! you've hit the nail on the head here.}
<A>__{lila is in her element. her whole demeanor has changed. she is tracking. she sniffs the breeze, cocks her head, moves stealthily. then she sheds her clothes, almost shaking them off, like a dog shaking off some cute costume his owner had dressed him in.}
<C>__{nathan}
<D>__{oh for god's sa...}
<A>__{lila turns her head and glares at nathan. there is an animal fierceness in her eye that shuts him up instantly. she turns back to pursue her prey.}
