<A>__{marchena is not a tidy man. books are piled up on the floor, the desk, on every shelf, along with maps, instruments of astronomy... the visible evidence of an inquiring mind. with practiced familiarity, as if they had done this a hundred times which indeed they have marchena sits behind his desk, and columbus opposite him. marchena lights a candle and considers the mess. then methodically, he slowly sweeps it from in front of him with his sleeve, exposing a large map underneath. when he looks up again, there is a new severity in his expression. he turns over an hourglass.}
<C>__{marchena}
<D>__{why do you wish to sail west?}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{to open a new route to asia. at the moment there are only two ways of reaching it...}
<A>__{he leans forward, and points to the map spread out on the desk.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{by sea, sailing around the african continent the journey takes a year...}
<A>__{his finger traces the journey, from west to east.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{or by land...}
<A>__{we are close now on the map, as we watch his finger tracing a line between europe and the far east.}
<C>__{columbus }
<D>__{... but the turks have closed this route to all christians. trading with the orient has become arduous, if not dangerous.}
<P>__{(he pauses)}
<D>__{there is a third way...}
<A>__{we notice that the outline of the european continent is familiar. but we also notice that, in that great expanse of ocean, the whole american continent is missing.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{by sailing west across the ocean sea.}
<A>__{close on marchena's face, touched by the mystery.}
<C>__{marchena}
<D>__{how can you be so certain? the ocean is said to be infinite.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{ignorance! i believe the indies are no more than 750 leagues west of the canary islands.}
<C>__{marchena}
<D>__{how can you be so certain?}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{the calculations of toscanelli marin de tyr, esdras...}
<C>__{marchena}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{esdras is a jew.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{so was christ!}
<A>__{marchena throws his quill in the air in frustration. he glances at the hourglass:}
<C>__{marchena}
<D>__{two minutes... and already you're a dead man. don't let passion overwhelm you, colon.}
<C>__{columbus}
<P>__{(mockingly)}
<D>__{i will try to remember that, marchena...}
<C>__{marchena}
<D>__{father marchena!}
<C>__{columbus}
<P>__{(ignoring this)}
<D>__{passion is something one cannot control!}
<C>__{marchena}
<P>__{(heatedly)}
<D>__{you get so carried away when you are being contradicted!}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{i've been contradicted all my life... eternity!}
<C>__{marchena}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{only god knows the meaning of such words, my son.}
