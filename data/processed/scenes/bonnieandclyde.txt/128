<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{c'mon, get out! get out of there, i said.}
<A>__{they come out, hands held high, shaking with fear. they have practically turned to jelly.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(ordering them into the other car)}
<D>__{get in here.}
<L>__{interior other car. day.}
<A>__{they get in and the gang gets in. seven people are now jammed inside. clyde drives, bonnie next to him, c.w. next to her. in back, blanche, then eugene with velma (of necessity) sitting on his lap, and then buck. as will be seen, the reason the barrows have kidnapped the couple is simply that they wanted company. living as they do, seeing only each other day after day, they long for diversion and new faces. so the atmosphere in the car will shortly change to one of friendliness and jollity, and it will get progressively more so in the series of cuts which advance the time. as the car starts up at the beginning, however, the man and woman are terrified.}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{eugene}
<P>__{(hesitantly)}
<D>__{i'm eugene grizzard.}
<C>__{velma}
<D>__{i'm velma davis.}
<C>__{buck}
<P>__{(just as friendly as he can be)}
<D>__{well, howdy! we're the barrow gang. that there is clyde drivin' and i'm buck.}
<A>__{the man and woman almost faint from fear; clutch at each other. the gang all laugh at this. velma and eugene begin to realize that they are not going to get hurt and that the barrows are friendly to them.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{look, don't be scared, folks. it ain't like you was the law. you're just folks like us.}
<C>__{eugene}
<P>__{(agreeing over enthusiastically)}
<D>__{yeah, yeah, that's the truth.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{i expect you been readin' about us.}
<A>__{the man and the woman answer simultaneously with what they think is the right thing to say under the circumstances.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{velma}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{they glare at each other.}
<C>__{eugene}
<P>__{(meaningfully)}
<D>__{yes, velma, we have too.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(laughing at the contretemps)}
<D>__{well, you two must be in love, i bet.}
<A>__{eugene and velma blush, get shy for a second. bonnie smiles.}
<C>__{buck}
<P>__{(gleefully, clapping his hands)}
<D>__{well, when you gonna marry the girl, boy?}
<A>__{everyone chuckles heartily.}
