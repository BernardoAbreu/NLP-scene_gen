<L>__{interior betting shop day}
<A>__{carter comes in from the back and walks calmly through to the street. a blind man is at the counter placing a bet.}
<L>__{exterior jetty tyne ferry day}
<A>__{the sunbeam waits in the car park. eric, con and peter arrive in the land rover and park behind it. they go down the gangplank to the floating jetty. a ferry is chugging across the water.}
<L>__{interior ferry day}
<A>__{carter sits, watching the other passengers. a mother and two young children take his attention. his look is tinted with regret even remorse.}
<L>__{exterior jetty day}
<A>__{as the ferry comes alongside, eric, con and peter move up to the rail. the passengers disembark, leaving carter standing alone. he's holding con's handgun. eric, con and peter hack slowly away to the steel shelters. peter, impatient as ever, pulls a sawn off automatic shooter from under his coat, cocks it and fires. too late. carter is already safely behind the ferry's superstructure. eric shouts.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{no shooters. cyril said no shooters, you stupid bastard.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{get stuffed. he's reloading.}
<C>__{con}
<D>__{gerald wants to see him first.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{shut up.}
<A>__{carter is listening to all this.}
<C>__{carter}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{are you coming in? or do we piss about all day?}
<A>__{eric laughs.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{you're finished, jack. you know that, don't you? i've bloody finished you.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{not till i'm dead, eric.}
<A>__{eric laughs.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{oh, you've still got your sense of humour? tell him how i've fixed him, con.}
<C>__{con}
<D>__{he's told gerald about you and anna.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{didn't believe us at first, did he, con? then peter talked to him.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{didn't even say goodbye. just asked us to take you back alive.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{he's probably talking to her right now. are you still going to fancy her when gerald's finished with her face?}
<A>__{carter shows no emotion. or are his eyes just that bit sadder? peter lets rip again. another window is shattered. carter ducks back, allowing peter time to board the ferry. carter catches a glimpse of peter as he climbs up the ferry's superstructure to the roof. by the time he heaves himself into position, carter is waiting.}
<C>__{carter}
<D>__{stay where you are, peter.}
<A>__{peter is helpless, clinging to the roof, unable to even raise his shooter.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{don't.}
<A>__{there's a long pause while carter looks at him, then he cold bloodedly shoots. peter is blown away. by the time he hits the deck, he's dead. con and eric panic. they run up the gangplank, safely out of range.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{carter, your car needs a wash.}
<A>__{eric signals to the driver in the land rover to bump the sunbeam into the water. two hits and the task is done. glenda's screams are lost as the river wraps itself around the sinking car. carter watches impassively.}
