<A>__{amelia holds tight to george's hand, leading him out into the falling snow. she turns, fixes him with a look. hands him the letter. and steps back. as if giving him space. at first, he smiles. what is this? she gestures for him to read. as he begins, there is nothing for a few seconds. then...}

<D>__{amelia (v.o.) (cont’d) if we can be honest i think the difficulties which may arise may best be avoided should you or i become interested deeply, or in passing, with anyone else.}
<A>__{she gazes intently, her heart in her eyes. he never looks up.}
<D>__{amelia (v.o.) (cont’d) please let us not interfere with the other's work or play, nor let the world see our private joys or disagreements.}
<A>__{and then...}
<D>__{amelia (v.o.) (cont’d) i must exact a cruel promise. and that is you will let me go in a year if we find no happiness together.}
<A>__{he stops on this. his thoughts unreadable.}
<D>__{amelia (v.o.) (cont’d) i will try to do my best in every way. and give you that part of me you know and seem to want.}
<A>__{he folds the letter carefully. places it in his pocket. and smiles.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{my amelia. brutal in her frank ness. beautiful in her honesty.}
<A>__{he steps to her. looks in her eyes. they kiss.}
