<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior master bedroom night}
<A>__{an exercise bike in the corner of the bedroom has been turned into a clothes hanger long ago. the t.v. across the bed has framed family photos displayed on top of it. david's shadow passes over them as he moves towards the open bathroom on the other side of the bedroom. a woman is tied to the bathroom door handle. she sits on the tiled floor slumped against the door. her eyes stare blankly at the ground. she has considerable bruises on her face and arms. david stands before her.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{where is he?}
<A>__{the woman doesn't answer, but a sound comes from the screen door nearby. the curtains draping the screen door move with the wind from outside. david crosses the room and pushes aside the curtain. it leads to a small balcony. an empty lawn chair is the only thing on it. david steps onto the balcony and looks down. the rain still pours down unmercifully. it comes down on a black tarp that covers a pool in the backyard. david turns to go back inside.}
<B>__{a blurr of orange attacks him.}
<A>__{the collision is sudden and explosive. the huge man drives his shoulder into david's chest and takes him off his feet. david's body flips over the railing. the dark green rain poncho flaps in the wind as he falls two stories directly towards the black tarp.}
