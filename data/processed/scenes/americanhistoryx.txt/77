<A>__{danny sparks up another cigarette and types on the screen}
<C>__{danny }
<D>__{the sixty or so disciples followed my brother’s word like it was the word of god.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior venice beach house – a rainy night – flashback}
<A>__{as the rain falls we see the vinyard's sitting at the table. stacey and murray rosenberg, doris’ then boyfriend who we met earlier, round out the clan. stacey sits close to derek.}
<C>__{danny }
<D>__{then came october 4th.}
<A>__{doris looks wonderful. and mr. murray rosenberg is a far cry from his present clean cut image. ponytail and beard, murray stares at derek talking away.}
<C>__{danny }
<D>__{everything was fine at the time. my mom had a good job and a new boyfriend…her first in a while. we had a four bedroom house six blocks from the beach that dad set us up with. everyone was happy.}
<A>__{tight on derek. his hair is longer on his face than on his head. his head is completely shaved. a wife beater cotton tank top, tattoos, nose and ear rings, wire rimmed glasses. his charisma draws their attention as he rambles over the crackling rainfall.}
<C>__{danny }
<D>__{everyone but derek.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{white men don’t cruise the streets of la killing each other, murray.}
<C>__{murray}
<D>__{no. you guys make bombs.}
<A>__{derek stares at the man, eyes filled with homicide.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{white americans don’t take p.c.p. and drink and drive a hundred and twenty fuckin’ miles an hour! that’s reality. we pull over and trust the law.}
<C>__{murray}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{you are kidding, right?}
<C>__{davina}
<P>__{(sarcastically)}
<D>__{don’t you know, murray? white people never break the law. we’re perfect little angels.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{that’s not what i said, davina.}
<P>__{(to the group)}
<D>__{three different times rodney king comes at those officers with the intent to hurt them. to hurt them! three times! but since we see it on some fucking tampered videotape... the bleeding heart media makes you believe that he only comes at them once. all we see is powell... koon and wind hittin’ him and...}
<P>__{(busting up laughing)}
<D>__{briseno kickin’ him in the back of the fuckin’ head with his boot. still…the dumbfuck’s tryin’ to get up and kick their asses! that’s how stupid that mother fucker is. they used textbook solid tactics and if dad were still here he’d say the same damn thing.}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{that doesn’t make it right.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{yes... it does. cops are taught to use that stick and they did.}
<C>__{murray}
<D>__{excessively.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{appropriately. cops demand authority and white people... unfortunately... are the only ones who give it to them.}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{even i acknowledge a cop’s authority.}
<A>__{davina starts to laugh.}
<C>__{davina}
<D>__{look who’s talking about respecting the law? mr. k.k.k. here.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{that’s two errors in one sentence, davina. first error – i didn’t say i respect the law. i said i respect a cop’s authority. second error... i’m not a member of the fuckin’ ku klux klan. pull your head outta your ass.}
<C>__{murray}
<D>__{don’t speak to her that way, derek. come on.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{murray, stay out of it. you’re not a member of this family and you never will be.}
<C>__{murray}
<D>__{what the hell does that have to do with anything?}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{you know, sometimes it’s hard to believe that i gave birth to you.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{if dan was walking across the street that night and rodney king plowed into him—}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{forget about rodney king for chrissake!}
<C>__{derek}
<P>__{(fiercely continuing)}
<D>__{–while wasted on chias and p.c.p... you’d consider the force those cops used to be justified.}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{he didn’t hit anybody!}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{if he did though! if that shithead killed dan... you would have believed the beating to be justified and so would everybody else. but since he didn’t hit anyone... it’s "hand’s across america" for the son of a bitch. it’s a "modern day, do anything to help the struggling black man society," and we’re all fucking suckers to it.}
<C>__{stacey}
<D>__{i’m with you, honey. all the way. it’s one... giant... ploy.}
<C>__{davina}
<D>__{here we go.}
<C>__{stacey}
<D>__{i mean... nobody likes chief whatever his name is, right?}
<C>__{davina}
<D>__{gates.}
<C>__{stacey}
<D>__{yeah. so here comes this filthy piece of garbage in a hyundai. he pulls over in front of a perfectly lighted area where a video camera is sitting there…fucking waiting for him, man. what happens next? chief gates is dust. it’s total—}
<A>__{davina drops her silverware on the plate with a clatter and looks at her mother. everyone stares at davina.}
<C>__{davina}
<P>__{(to doris)}
<D>__{may i be excused please?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{don’t interrupt, davina.}
<C>__{davina}
<D>__{i didn’t interrupt shit.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{the hell you didn’t. i was listening to stacey and then i heard you. that’s called interrupting. wait til’ she’s finished and you can be excused.}
<C>__{davina}
<D>__{who the hell do you think you are?}
<A>__{derek jumps up from the table and grabs her by the back of the hair. the table jolts and plates drop to the floor.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{you don’t know when to shut up, do you?}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{goddammit derek!}
<C>__{murray}
<D>__{come on, derek! what are you trying to prove, man?! jesus!}
<A>__{derek turns and laughs at murray.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{i’m trying to teach my sister some respect, murray.}
<C>__{davina}
<D>__{let go of my fucking hair!}
<C>__{derek}
<P>__{(to murray)}
<D>__{see! see the way she speaks!}
<P>__{(softly to davina)}
<D>__{tell me you’re gonna shut up and i’ll let you go.}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{derek! let go of her hair and sit down!}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{i will when i hear an answer, doris. tell me, davina.}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{are you going to shut up?}
<A>__{tight on danny. he gets up quickly and tries to pull derek off. derek turns and cracks danny in the face with a backhand, dropping him back into a cabinet. a crystal vase with flowers crashes to the floor, just missing danny’s head.}
<C>__{murray}
<D>__{jesus!}
<C>__{derek}
<P>__{(to danny)}
<D>__{what are you thinkin’?}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{danny? are you okay? derek!}
<A>__{danny nods his head as everyone looks at derek.}
<C>__{derek}
<P>__{(to davina)}
<D>__{are you going to shut up so stacey can finish or what?}
<P>__{(sympathetically)}
<D>__{it’s a real easy question, davina. a simple yes or no will suffice. tell me what i want to hear and i’ll let go.}
<C>__{davina}
<D>__{fuck…you.}
<A>__{derek takes a piece of roast beef off her plate and shoves it in her mouth. he holds the whole piece inside so she can’t spit it out. davina cries as she chokes on the meat. murray: she can’t breathe, derek!}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{stay back, both of you! it’s her bed…she’s gotta lie in it.}
<P>__{(grabbing harder)}
<D>__{you can cry all you want, davina. i’m not gonna let go until you tell me what i wanna hear! are you going to shut that fat fucking mouth of yours and let my girlfriend tell her opinion?}
<P>__{(exploding)}
<D>__{are you?!}
<A>__{doris grabs him from behind and he aggressively turns on her. derek curled his tongue behind his teeth and raises his arm like he’s actually going to smack his mother. she grabs his arm though, forcefully.}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{let go of her hair and sit down.}
<A>__{derek releases his grip on his sister and she spits the roast beef onto the floor. she runs in the back bedroom crying, choking and coughing.}
<C>__{davina }
<D>__{i hate you, you fucking asshole!}
<A>__{the door slams shut in the background. doris, murray, danny, and stacey all stare at derek. derek calmly faces his brother.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{danny nods.}
<C>__{murray}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{psycho.}
<A>__{in slo mo – time freezes as derek slowly turns his head back to murray. on the track we hear a few keys being typed and then silence. a cigarette sizzles.}
