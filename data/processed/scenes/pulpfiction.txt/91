<L>__{interior pawnshop day}
<A>__{butch sneaks to the door. on the counter is a big set of keys with a large z connected to the ring. grabbing them, he's about to go out when he stops and listens to the hillbilly psychopaths having their way with marsellus. butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in a situation like that. se he begins rooting around the pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in with. he picks up a big destructive looking hammer, then discards it: not destructive enough. he picks up a chainsaw, thinks about it for a moment, then puts it back. next, a large louisville slugger he tries on for size. but then he spots what he's been looking for: a samurai sword. it hands in its hand carved wood sheath from a nail on the wall, next to a neon "dad's old fashioned root beer" sign. butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its sheath. it's a magnificent piece of steel. it seems to glisten in the low wattage light of the pawnshop. butch touches his thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. not on your life. it's as sharp as it gets. this weapon seems made to order for the brothers grimm downstairs. holding the sword pointed downward, takakura kenstyle, he disappears through the red curtains to take care of business.}
