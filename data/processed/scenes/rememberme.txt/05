<L>__{interior junior's restaurant brooklyn after}
<A>__{the family sits together in a booth. tyler rolls a bic lighter over his knuckles. caroline draws a funny portrait of tyler on her napkin. he is smoking nine cigarettes at once. diane gives the menu a ridiculous amount of attention. les is eyeing the cheesecake. charles subtly aligns his silverware.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{...this is nice... i think it's nice that we still do this...}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{mom.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{i forgot. i'm trying to purge "nice" from my vocabulary. michael would like that we still do this.}
<A>__{tyler takes out a cigarette. lights it. without saying a word his mother takes it and snubs it out in an empty water glass.}
<C>__{diane}
<P>__{(to caroline)}
<D>__{did you tell tyler what your art teacher said about your portrait?}
<A>__{caroline, as bemused as an eleven year old can be, looks at her mother, then at her brother. she adopts a very motherly tone.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{tyler, did i tell you what my art teacher said about my portrait?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{why no, caroline. what did your art teacher say about your portrait?}
<C>__{diane}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{you two. i quit.}
<A>__{she flickers a glance at her ex husband and squeezes les' hand.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{...she was very impressed. she said i captured a moment like a young james whistler.}
<A>__{the waitress brings platefuls of extravagant cheesecake to the table. les dives in. charles is having toast. he sips a glass of water and takes a surreptitious glance at his patek phillippe.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{young whistler... good... 'cause whistler really fell off late in his career. he's the michael jackson of european art history.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{she suggested your sister take pratt's summer art intensive and that's hugely prestigious.}
<A>__{caroline looks a bit sheepish, tyler high fives caroline. diane, again, flickers a glance at charles.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i would be the youngest one, ever, practically...}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{tyler, would you please pass the butter?}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{caroline was speaking.}
<C>__{tyler}
<P>__{(to charles)}
<D>__{are you really this clueless? are you really dismissing her like this?}
<A>__{diane touches caroline's hair.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{caroline is perfectly capable of speaking up if she is feeling dismissed. caroline, are you feeling dismissed?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i'm okay.}
<C>__{charles}
<P>__{(solicitous, to caroline)}
<D>__{i didn't mean to change the subject.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{what was the subject?}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{the subject we were discussing. what was it?}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{now's not the time for your heroics tyler}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{no. it's the perfect time.}
<A>__{charles makes a minute adjustment to his collar. father and son lock eyes until...}
<C>__{tyler}
<P>__{(whispering, to caroline)}
<D>__{do you need me to take you anywhere?}
<A>__{caroline shakes her head.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i will stay with mom.}
<A>__{diane glares at her ex husband. tyler rises and kisses his sister's forehead.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{then i will see you after school.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{kay.}
<A>__{he exits as caroline sips her lemonade, avoiding everybody's eyes.}
