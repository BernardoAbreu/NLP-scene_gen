<A>__{he is in the muddy door yard of a rural hootch, part of a small hamlet, of about a dozen buildings. pigs scatter, grunting their surprise, as rambo sprints across the yard. over a low rail fence. between the hootches. soldiers charge down the slope behind him.}
<L>__{exterior hamlet}
<A>__{rambo emerges onto the main "street" at a dead run, tearing a swath through the everyday village activities. the viet peasants scatter as the fierce american charges through their midst. a giant by their standards to begin with, rambo is now a mud caked nightmare, trailing vines and brambles... his face a mask of dark streaks topped by encrusted hair. he crashes into a panic stricken young man on a bicycle, spilling them both. rolls. comes up running. rambo changes course to intersect with an ancient truck which is accelerating away, headed out of the village. the truck, rusted and mud caked into a brownish lump on wheels, is hauling a load of chickens in a wire mesh cage on the flat bed. rambo leaps onto the running board of the cab and points his pistol through the window at the terrified old man driving.}
