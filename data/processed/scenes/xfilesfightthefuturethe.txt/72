<A>__{tracking table height across gurneys where white sheet wrapped bodies lie. camera landing on scully. standing next to mulder who is undoing the peculiar ropey stitching on the sheet used to secure the bodies.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{this is one of the firemen who died in dallas?}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{according to this tag.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{and you're looking for?}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{i can tell you that without even looking at him.}
<P>__{(off mulder's look)}
<D>__{conclusive organ failure due to proximal exposure to source and flying debris.}
<A>__{scully pulls out an autopsy report that was laid on the gurney under the body of the sheet wrapped corpse.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{this body has already been autopsied, mulder. you can tell from the way it's been wrapped and dressed.}
<A>__{undeterred, mulder works to get the sheet off. the first thing we notice is that he's still in his fireman's uniform. his face looks familiar to us, not because we know him, but because of the translucency of skin we saw in the other fireman. (we will also notice he's missing an arm, a leg and large part of his torso.)}

<D>__{does this fit the description you just read me, scully?}
<A>__{scully comes around, reacting to what she sees.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{oh my god. this man's tissue...}
<A>__{scully is quickly removing a pair of latex gloves, stretching them on to palpate the man's tissue.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{it's like jelly.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{there's some kind of cellular breakdown. it's completely edematous.}
<A>__{she palpates the spongy skin on the man's face, neck. unbuttoning the uniform now, seeing:}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{and there's been no autopsy performed. there's no y incision here; no internal exam.}
<C>__{mulder}
<D>__{you're telling me the cause of death on the report is false. that this man didn't die from an explosion, or from flying debris.}
<C>__{scully}
<D>__{i don't know what killed this man. i'm not sure if anybody else could claim to either.}
<A>__{off mulder's reaction to this:}
