<L>__{141 ali's hiding place. inside. morning.}
<A>__{ali la pointe bends over petit omar as if to cover him. hassiba has stopped breathing, her eyes wide open; mahmoud is crying ... a single image, a second and now:}
<B>__{the explosion.}
<L>__{142 rue des abderames. outside. morning.}
<A>__{the house collapses in a white cloud, as if its foundations had suddenly been removed. mathieu and the other officers move away. behind them the echo of the explosion continues to resound, then shouts, orders, and isolated ju ju. mathieu's face is weary but his expression is relieved. he is smiling.}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{and so the tapeworm no longer has a head. are you satisfied, mathieu? in algiers everything should be over.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{yes, i believe there won't be any more talk of the nlf for some time.}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{let's hope forever.}
<A>__{another colonel intervenes:}
<D>__{1st colonel at heart they are good people. we've had good relations with them for a hundred and thirty years ... i don't see why we shouldn't continue that way. 2nd colonel yes, but algiers is not the only city in algeria.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{bah, for that matter, algeria isn't the only country in the world ...}
<C>__{general}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{why, yes, of course ... but for the moment, let's be satisfied with algiers! in the mountains our work is always easier.}
<A>__{gradually the officers move away down the slanting street toward their jeeps, and their remarks fade away and are lost.}
