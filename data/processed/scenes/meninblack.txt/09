<D>__{and when he gets here, i will kick his ass too.}
<A>__{edwards is about to slap the cuffs on him, when the perp blinks. nothing unusual about that, but then another set of translucent, milky white eyelids, underneath his regular eyelids, blinks also. edwards is thrown for a moment, which is all the time the perp needs to pull out... his weapon, which is the strangest looking gun you've ever seen. reacting quickly, edwards bats it out of the perp's hand. the weapon smashes into the stone wall surrounding central park and shatters into a million pieces.}
