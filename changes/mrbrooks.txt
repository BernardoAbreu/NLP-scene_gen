Below the pants and shirts are a dozen pairs of identical leather work shoes. The windbreaker he puts on is also from a dozen identical windbreakers. He takes a set of car keys off a hook next to a door which opens into a garage. Under the light is an older model non- descript Toyota.}

<ACTION>__{A mixture of modest houses and apartment buildings. Mr. Brooks's Toyota is parked in the semi-dark cast by a tree. We rise over the car, over the trees, over the houses to the other side of the block and come down to find Mr. Brooks working the lock on the side door of a small BUNGALOW. He has on surgical gloves. The pick is extracted, the handle turned. The door opens. There's a chain. Mr. Brooks removes a pair of bent rubber tipped forceps from a pocket, inserts it in the chain, pulls the door to, gives the tool a twist and gently pushes the door inward. The chain has been released.}
<LOC>__{INT. BUNGALOW N NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Mr. Brooks quietly closes the door and holding his breath stands very still and listens. There's a faint indistinct sound coming from the recesses of the house. Mr. Brooks's feet glide out of the PANTRY. Now coming slightly behind him is another pair of legs encased in dark slacks. Move up; the person in the black slacks is Marshall. In the middle of the KITCHEN, the sound is now recognizable. It's the moans of a Couple fucking. This disturbs Mr. Brooks, he hesitates. Marshall leans in and hisses fiercely in his ear.}

<DIAL>__{Don't you dare quit on me, you piece of shit. I want to see what they're doing.}
<ACTION>__{Mr. Brooks's spine stiffens and he's going forward again. Entering a HALLWAY, he reaches into his jacket. When his hand reappears it's inside a Ziplock bag, his fingers around the butt of a silenced pistol. He brings the hand and bag to his mouth and tightens the Ziplock against his wrist. The two Men arrive at a door that's slightly ajar. Behind it the sounds of the love-making are becoming more intense. Mr. Brooks nudges the door with his foot. It opens enough for he and Marshall to see the Couple inside. The Man and Woman from the Arthur Murray dance class are naked on the bed. As much as Mr. Brooks hates himself for it he loves watching. He can now hear his heart beating in his ears. He begins to breathe in unison with the Couple, but his expression is distant almost clinical. When the Couple climaxes, when they come, Mr. Brooks's face goes blank. On the bed the Woman rolls off her Partner and the two of them lie there basking in the afterglow. Behind them Mr. Brooks pushes the door fully open and slips into the ROOM. They don't know he's there until he speaks.}

<ACTION>__{In an attempt to get away, the Woman pushes herself back against the wall. She can't take her eyes off Mr. Brooks and she can't stop screaming. POP! A hole appears above her left eye. The impact of Mr. Brooks's High Velocity .22 slug bounces her head off the wall. The screaming stops. The Man opens his mouth and begins to shake. POP! The bullet through his brain makes him instantly dead and he crumples onto the Girl. Mr. Brooks looks at what he's done. His nostrils flare at the scent of death. Then he moves, he's got work to do. On his way to the bed, the pistol goes into his pocket.}

It drops through the open side door into the street. Atwood rolls away and reaches for her ankle gun. Now it's Meeks' turn. A sharp tug on the chain of the handcuff stalls her motion. He flicks his other arm and a switchblade is delivered into his right hand. Snap!! The blade comes out. Atwood is reaching again for her ankle gun. She sees the flash of metal and flings her head back. Luckily all she receives is a deep gash above her right eye. Blood immediately begins to cascade over her brow. Meeks grins and gives another sharp tug on the handcuff to pull Atwood into the range of his knife. With one foot Atwood kicks at him, with the other she pushes off and propels herself backward to grab a handful of the Driver's hair.

But before they get to it, there's a Room on the right. Snyder shines his light in. It's a BATHROOM. The shower curtain is open. Nobody in the tub. The Door ahead is waiting, but there's another Door on the right. Snyder shines his light in. This one is a Treatment Room with a Therapy table and shelves of oils and unguents. They've come to the red Door. Atwood will open this one. She turns the knob and pushes. The Door is stuck. She and Snyder exchange a look. Snyder shuffles back half a step and flattens himself against the wall. He shuts off his flashlight. Atwood takes a deep breath, levers her weight against the door and pushes. There's a sudden Snap! Then the door swings freely open. The beam of Atwood's flashlight reveals a large room containing a bed, a dresser, a... CREEEKKK!!! The sound is coming from up in the rafters. Atwood whips her flashlight in that direction. For an instant the beam catches a piece of a large shape falling fast right at her. Then it's lost in the darkness and then picked up again in the reflected light in the Hall. The shape is a naked Man. WHACK!! The Man nails Atwood in the shoulder. BANG! Her gun goes off. She bounces into the wall and onto her ass. Barely slowed the Man continues in an upward arc. His feet and knees slam into the ceiling. Plaster dust rains. The Man swings back, past Snyder. He's lost in the darkness again. Then he swings back into the light and comes to a stop just inside the bedroom Door. The Man is hanging from a rope around his neck. He's dead. His Body is festooned with syringes stuck into his bare flesh. In fact two of the needles hold a sheet of paper to the Man's chest. Printed on the paper in big black letters are the words: HA! HA!

The reflection off her face catches the attention of the Man who is wearing a wide brimmed hat. He lifts his head. It's Thorton Meeks. The Woman with him was the Driver of the Van. She's wearing a watchcap. Meeks gently takes his Companion's arm. They stop. Her eyes go to where he's looking and then back to his. At some unspoken signal they both draw their guns. Intent on finding 517 and Baffert, the Couple hasn't registered on Atwood's radar. BANG! TWOCK! A chunk of plaster blows off the wall next to her head. Startled, Atwood winces away. BANG! The Woman fires. The slug explodes the plaster on the other side of Atwood's head. Now Atwood is turning toward them, gun in hand. Meeks fires. The bullet passes through Atwood's jacket. Instinctively Atwood assumes a classic duelist's pose offering the smallest target possible. Calmly she squeezes off her first shot. The plaster explodes from the wall above Meeks' head. The Woman fires. A hole appears in Atwood's sleeve. Atwood pulls the trigger again. SMACK! The Woman screams and falls back into Meeks, a bullet in her hip. Atwood's third shot takes the hat off Meeks head. She now realizes who her attackers are.}

Atwood's next two shots miss. Meeks and the Woman arrive at the stairs and before rounding the corner, BANG! BANG! BANG!, fire at Atwood who is now moving deliberately at them. Atwood doesn't try and dodge the bullets or flinch away from them and her shots are unhurried. The next one catches the Woman in the side. The one after that nails Meeks in the left shoulder. He's spun into the Woman.}

But Meeks' knee has collapsed and he and the Woman are already tumbling down the next set of steps. Atwood waits. There's silence, then the murmur of voices.}
