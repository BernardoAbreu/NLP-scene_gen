<A>__{malkovich awakes with a start. maxine looks over at him.}
<C>__{maxine}
<D>__{bad dream, darling?}
<C>__{malkovich}
<D>__{i've got to leave malkovich.}
<C>__{maxine}
<D>__{you've got to be kidding.}
<C>__{malkovich}
<D>__{i just had the most horrifying nightmare. the devil was in it.}
<A>__{flemmer crouches behind a bureau and listens. he is pleased with himself.}
<C>__{maxine}
<D>__{malkovich is our meal ticket. you can't back out because of some stupid dream.}
<C>__{flemmer}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{shit.}
<C>__{malkovich}
<D>__{honey, we can be happy and poor together.}
<C>__{maxine}
<P>__{(laughs derisively)}
<D>__{perhaps you'll want to consult that ouija board again.}
<A>__{there is a knock at the door. maxine opens it, angry.}
<C>__{maxine }
<D>__{yeah what?!}
<C>__{malkovich}
<D>__{derek mantini!}
<A>__{mantini enters. maxine is suddenly interested. mantini and maxine give each other the once over.}
<C>__{mantini}
<P>__{(still eyeing maxine)}
<D>__{hello, schwartz. i saw your show.}
<C>__{malkovich}
<D>__{did you see the reviews?}
<C>__{mantini}
<D>__{yeah, i saw them}
<C>__{malkovich}
<D>__{because if you missed any, i just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now.}
<C>__{maxine}
<D>__{i'm maxine. i produced the evening with malkovich.}
<C>__{mantini}
<D>__{very impressive. i could use a producer with your vision. and other outstanding attributes.}
<C>__{malkovich}
<D>__{she's not available.}
<C>__{mantini}
<D>__{we'll see, schwartz. we'll see.}
<C>__{maxine}
<D>__{yeah, we'll see, schwartz. we'll see.}
<C>__{mantini}
<D>__{i won't waste your time schwartz, or more importantly, mine. here's my proposal: there's only room in this world for one "world's greatest puppeteer." correct? so let's allow the puppet going public to crown their king.}
<C>__{malkovich}
<D>__{how do we do that?}
<C>__{mantini}
<D>__{a friendly competition, if you will. your malkovich puppet and my harry s. truman puppet appear opposite each other in a play. not some vegas burly q pyrotechnics, but a real play that requires actual acting. the audience decides who is more deserving of the title. the losing puppeteer bows out graciously. goes back to obscurity as a file clerk.}
<C>__{malkovich}
<D>__{what's the play?}
<C>__{mantini}
<D>__{say... "equus"? it's got everything.}
<C>__{malkovich}
<D>__{never heard of it.}
<C>__{mantini}
<D>__{broadway's finest three hours. it's about the suppression of the individual. conformity as god in modern society.}
<C>__{malkovich}
<D>__{sounds boring. are there any songs?}
<C>__{mantini}
<D>__{nothing but acting to hide behind, buddy boy.}
<C>__{malkovich}
<D>__{i'm not afraid. i toured for a year with the national puppet company's production of "long day's journey into night."}
<C>__{mantini}
<D>__{great then.}
<C>__{malkovich}
<D>__{is there dancing?}
<C>__{mantini}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{malkovich}
<D>__{who needs dancing?}
