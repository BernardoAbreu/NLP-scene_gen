<L>__{exterior parking lot night}
<A>__{the ferrari scrapes as it takes the curb too fast. from the alley, the bartender chases after it, finally stopping to squeeze off three shots. none seem to hit. the ferrari tears down the street.}
<L>__{interior ferrari driving night}
<A>__{taking a left, marcus slows down a little. we're on an empty street well away from the crazy horse. he dabs at his bloody nose. in the passenger seat, simon looks at the gun in the hand. he suddenly throws it out.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{getting rid of the weapon.}
<A>__{marcus slams on the brakes.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{it has your fingerprints on it.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{oh shit.}
<A>__{craning around, simon looks for it in the street. marcus backs the car up. suddenly, a phone rings. lights flicker on the car phone.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{do we answer?}
<A>__{marcus brakes again. the phone keeps ringing.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{it's probably orange county asking where the hell his car is.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{it's a cell phone. they can trace where we are even if we don't answer.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{get the gun. go. find it.}
<A>__{simon climbs out and starts looking, crouching to look under cars. in the ferrari, marcus sits back and kicks the phone with his boot, over and over until it stops, dead. for a moment, silence. then the car's alarm starts going off. marcus screams with frustration. he punches buttons on the keychain, but nothing will quiet it. he tries the key in the ignition. it won't turn over. climbing out of the car, he kicks it with all his might. simon finds the gun, crawling under a truck to get it. using his jacket, marcus starts frantically wiping off the inside and outside of the ferrari. simon joins him. the whole time, the alarm is still wailing. satisfied, marcus motions that they're done. he and simon take off running down the street.}
