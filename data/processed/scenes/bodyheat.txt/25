<L>__{exterior second floor porch night}
<A>__{the tinkling is distinct out here. matty and racine come out onto the porch. there are about thirty wind chimes of various, lovely designs crystal, metal, wood hanging at intervals from the rim of the wide porch awning, completely encircling matty and racine. halfway down the long lawn is a white gazebo. beyond it, the waterway is shimmering in the moonlight. at the edge of the water is a small boat house. racine walks along under the chimes, looking up at them. a smile plays across her face. he looks back at matty,}

<A>__{racine moves back and stands very close to her. he looks at her in the moonlight, but she concentrates on the distant water.}

<D>__{it's a mess. there's a row boat, a lot of lounge chairs... things like that.}
<A>__{racine puts his hand up under her hair, on her nape. she closes her eyes at his touch, then moves away, as though by an act, of will, to the door, half opening it.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{i think you should go now.}
<C>__{racine}
<D>__{i just got here.}
<C>__{matty}
<D>__{you've seen them. please go.}
<A>__{racine steps toward her, but she ducks inside and moves through the intermittent light of the hall and down the steps. racine follows her.}
