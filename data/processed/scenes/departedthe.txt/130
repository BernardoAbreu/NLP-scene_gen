<L>__{interior madolyn's cellar apartment. continuous}
<A>__{billy looks around and sees: boxes, transition. the furniture already gone. an air mattress on the floor. there are still tea things on the counter. a basic life is still possible here. madolyn has been making tea here, sleeping here, reading in bed. billy, soaked, a drowned rat, is looking vulnerable and honest.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{thanks. if this is inappropriate... i can leave.}
<A>__{madolyn takes a moment to react.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{no, it's, it's, it's not inappropriate...you're not a patient...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{you moving in or out?}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{i still have three weeks on the lease...}
<A>__{billy is looking at the picture to which colin objected. a young girl in front of a rust belt slum, tilted in a box of effects.}
<C>__{madolyn }
<D>__{that's me.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{yeah, i know.}
<A>__{he hangs the picture on a nail.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<P>__{(the kettle whistles os)}
<D>__{would you like a cup of tea?}
<A>__{billy nods.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{yeah. yeah i would. thank you.}
<A>__{madolyn leaves him looking vaguely around the apartment. in the kitchen, it appears that madolyn has forgotten how to make a cup of tea. she perseveres, comes out holding two cups. billy is looking at the handful of books still in the apartment.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{do you want some...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{sugar? no...}
<A>__{she hands him the cup of tea. strung out, he spills his tea, slightly, unobserved by madolyn. madolyn looks over at the bed, the book, the lamp, the incontrovertible evidence that she's probably really, in fact, not that into colin..}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{i've always needed my own place.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{hedging your bets?}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{no. i'm not "hedging my best"...i told you when we had coffee...there's a choice. you choose...you have to make a...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{decision.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{...decision...and stick by what...you choose...you have to...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{move in with your boyfriend?}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{yes. stick by what you...otherwise it's... i have to say that your vulnerability is really freaking me out right now. is it real?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{yeah, i think so.}
<A>__{tick...tick...tick.}
<C>__{billy }
<D>__{you don't have cats.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i like that. that's good.}
