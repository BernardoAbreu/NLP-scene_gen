<L>__{interior large courtroom day}
<A>__{cynthia is looking at helen.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{and you're positive the man you saw with the gun is the defendant.}
<A>__{instead of looking at joe, cynthia turns to rodriguez and divinci who are seated in the rows behind the prosecution table. they are looking right at her. they wait for her answer.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{no further questions.}
<A>__{divinci offers her a small smile. cynthia turns away. arthur is now standing in front of her.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{miss webb... is it miss?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{miss webb, had you ever seen the defendant before that night, the night you described to us?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{do you know what perjury is?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{when you lie.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{when you lie under oath in a court of law. do you know what the penalty for that is?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{you go to jail.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{yes... cynthia, have you ever seen the defendant before that night?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{objection. the witness has already answered that question.}
<C>__{judge harold pine}
<D>__{sustained.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i just want to give the witness the opportunity to remember if she could have seen mr. mccall anyplace else before the night in question.}
<A>__{divinci stares at cynthia. as if willing her to give the answer he wants her to give.}
<C>__{judge harold pine}
<D>__{ms. webb, do you understand the consequences of perjury?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{judge harold pine}
<D>__{let's get on with it then.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what did you buy the night you went into the mini mart?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{what did i buy?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you remembered seeing mr. mccall that night and hearing the gunshot and a car crash. i just wondered if you remembered what you bought in the mini mart.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{...shampoo i think.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{that's all?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{where do you live?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{4356 17th street. number 37.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{is that close to where this mini mart is?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{close? sort of.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{how far would you say?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i don't really know.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{within walking distance?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{no... i don't think so.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{did you walk there that night or drive?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i ahh... drove.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you drove. but when you left the mini mart you stated that you walked down the street.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{how far?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{...to the corner.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{objection. your honor, i don't see a point to this line of questioning.}
<C>__{judge harold pine}
<D>__{is there a point?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{yes, your honor. since this is the only witness, i'm trying to establish what the scene was like that night.}
<C>__{judge harold pine}
<D>__{try to get there as quickly as possible.}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(to cynthia)}
<D>__{and how far away from the corner was the mini mart? for example was it in the middle of the block, close to the corner, where?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{in the middle i think.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{so you walked all the way to the corner. i assume then you were walking back to your car, yes?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{...yeah.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{was there a reason you parked so far away?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(getting nervous)}
<D>__{um... there were lots of cars parked on the street.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{was there anyone else on the street besides you?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{lots of cars, but no people. any traffic?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i don't remember.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{so you were the only person to see joe on the street that night?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i didn't see anybody else.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{so you heard a gunshot, a car crash and a man running with a gun in his hand.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what did you do then? did you call the police, 911?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i went home.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you went home. straight home?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{and you're sure it was joe you saw that night?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{when you went home.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{arthur pauses.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{when you went home you saw joe?}
<A>__{cynthia realizes what she's said.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{objection. defense is trying to confuse the witness.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i'm not trying to confuse the witness, it's the witness that's trying to confuse the court. i have witnesses who will refute her testimony. witnesses who were on that corner the night of the shooting, who never saw ms. webb, who never heard the gunshot, who never saw joe run past. ms webb saw joe outside her apartment building that night because he lived in the alley next to it. isn't that right, ms webb?}
<A>__{arthur turns dramatically to cynthia. she is scared.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{objection!}
<A>__{everyone's attention is on cynthia.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{when i referred to him as joe, you knew who i was talking about, didn't you. this case is the people versus mr. william mccall. not joe. joe has never been mentioned in this trial. how did you know who i was talking about, ms. webb?}
<A>__{cynthia looks from arthur to divinci. divinci is frozen. rodriguez is sweating. then cynthia turns and looks at joe. joe looks at her, feeling sorry for her. not hating her.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{ms. webb, how did you know that joe was the defendant?}
<A>__{cynthia lowers her eyes to the floor.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{he lived in the alley next to my apartment building.}
<A>__{helen and richard stein are stunned yet again.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{oh shit.}
<A>__{divinci and rodriguez are doing their best to remain cool, calm and collected.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{why did you lie to this court?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{are you afraid of somebody?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{are you protecting somebody?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{judge harold pine}
<D>__{answer the questions, ms. webb or i will be forced to cite you for contempt.}
<A>__{cynthia looks up at the judge. she's not talking.}
