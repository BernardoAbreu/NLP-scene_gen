<L>__{interior basement set day}
<A>__{the set is finally ready: ashley is lying on the bed in a robe, the lights and camera are set, and matt and fred are adjusting the video camera. the only thing missing is an actor. deacon enters.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{hey, where's coop?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{he was supposed to be here a half hour ago.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{maybe he got sucked into a black hole.}
<A>__{he chuckles to himself.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{good one, spock. i can't understand why you're not more popular with the ladies.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{look, we're wasting time. deacon, why don't you just go in there?}
<A>__{deacon balks at first, then looks over at ashley, lying there.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{come on...}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{okay. okay. all right already.}
<A>__{he pulls off his shirt and approaches ashley with a pizza box from out of nowhere.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{and action!}
<A>__{matt starts filming while ashley pulls deacon near her.}
<C>__{ashley }
<D>__{maybe i can pay for the pizza some other way...}
<A>__{we hear deacon's zipper opening offscreen as deacon rolls his eyes and reluctantly delivers his line:}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{and maybe i could throw in the sausage for free.}
<A>__{deacon shows no enthusiasm for what's happening down below.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{fred, you get in there, too.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{yeah, it'll be a great shot.}
<A>__{fred takes off his shorts and walks over to the other side of the bed. ashley is offscreen, presumably lying on the bed. the two guys are facing each other.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{s'up?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{how's it going?}
<A>__{deacon shrugs.}
<C>__{fred }
<D>__{hey, did you see that show on sci fi about sun spots?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{yeah. they said there's going to be a massive eruption next year.}
<A>__{fred starts laughing.}
<C>__{deacon }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{you said "massive eruption."}
<A>__{deacon starts laughing, too.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{hey, quit the chatter.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{hey, why don't you guys kiss?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you know. make out with each other.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{all right.}
<A>__{fred goes in to kiss deacon, who's thoroughly confused. deacon holds him back with his hand.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{wait. why do you want us to kiss?}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{because that's what guys do in gay porn.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{deacon looks over at the camera. it's ashley filming. panic! he slowly looks down at the person he and fred are having sex with. he can barely look. it's matt!}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{more sausage please.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!}
