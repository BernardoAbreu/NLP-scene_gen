<A>__{zaphod is in line with arthur and ford. he looks up to: a presidential photograph of himself, in suit and tie, smiling broadly. he lowers his thinking cap.}
<C>__{female vogon processor}
<D>__{next!}
<A>__{arthur steps up, followed by ford and zaphod who keeps his head low and bowed.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{yes. hi. we're here about getting a prisoner released?}
<C>__{female vogon processor}
<D>__{prisoner release form?}
<A>__{she holds out her hand. arthur doesn't have a form. annoyed, she points across the room to a wall that is nothing but shelves holding forms.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{right. once i've filled it out can i return to the front of the line, seeing as i've already waited...}
<C>__{female vogon processor}
<D>__{no. next!}
<A>__{arthur sighs, frustrated. all three of them walk to the shelves holding the forms. arthur turns to zaphod.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{can't you do something?! you're president, aren't you?}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{you want me to make a speech, shake a hand? that's what i do i think. it's all a little fuzzy.}
<A>__{arthur angrily fills out the form. moments later arthur is back in line, having waited a long time. he finally gets to the window, hands the green form to the vogon processor. she types into her computer, then checks the screen.}
<C>__{female vogon processor}
<D>__{this prisoner is being detained for...}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{kidnapping the president. not eligible for release at this time. you can make an appointment for a later date or take a number and wait.}
<A>__{arthur's breathing quickens. he can't take this.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{alright, look.}
<P>__{(yanks thinking cap and sunglasses off zaphod)}
<D>__{this is the president.}
<A>__{she looks at zaphod, then back to the large portrait of zaphod, then back to zaphod. she nods. okay...}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{he says the whole kidnapping thing was a terrible misunderstanding, she didn't mean anything by it and he's ordering you to let her go.}
<C>__{female vogon processor}
<P>__{(holding up green form)}
<D>__{but this isn't a presidential release of prisoner form. those are blue.}
<A>__{she points to the wall of forms. arthur sighs.}
