<D>__{what? tell me you got signal.}
<C>__{razor }
<D>__{no fucking shit i got signal. dude, theyre changing it. choi is annoyed.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{are you using the right pulse wave?}

<D>__{shut the fuck up and get back here.}
<A>__{the matrix scroll pours down at a streaking pace. its almost impossible to make out the individual characters.}
<D>__{choi comes up behind razor}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{oh my god. what are they }
<C>__{razor}
<D>__{theyre changing the matrix.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{call morpheus.}
<A>__{razor patches into morpheus cabin through the headset.}
<L>__{interior morpheus cabin}
<A>__{its dark, but quiet classical music can be heard. hes not in bed alone. niobes shaded form can be made out behind him. morpheus sounds awake, but looks anything but. he grabs the buzzing handset only an arms length from him.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{im here.}
<C>__{razor}
<D>__{sir, you gotta get down here.}
<A>__{morpheus starts dressing as he talks. he puts a reasurring hand on niobes shoulder.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{proximity alarm?}
<C>__{razor}
<D>__{the matrix, sir. the coding is going nuts.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{be right there.}
<A>__{morpheus hangs up the phone and jumps into his boots. he turns to niobe as he works.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{it sounds bad. theyre readjusting quicker than we thought. niobe jumps up and dresses quickly.}
<C>__{niobe}
<D>__{already?}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{it appears that they are learning their lessons. niobe shakes her head. morpheus, how much are you going to tell him? morpheus pauses.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{tell neo? about his predecessors, i suppose? niobe, dressed, nods.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{he is the niobe puts a finger to his lips.}
<C>__{niobe}
<D>__{six came before him, morpheus. morpheus shakes his head slowly.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<A>__{"to me, none came before him. the oracle told me i would find the one.}
<D>__{it is prophecy. you havent seen what he can do."}
<C>__{niobe}
<D>__{what if they toughen the matrix code, like last time?}
<C>__{morpheus}
<A>__{"there are lots of ifs. how about this one: what if we lose faith in}
<D>__{our cause?"}
<A>__{he disappears through the door, leaving niobe standing in the dim}
