<D>__{we're full up tonight, frank.}
<A>__{frank walks over to unit three, mr. burke's cubicle, pulls back the curtain. burke lies sedated, wired and tubed. frank leans over, feels burke's pulse. frank's expression changes he looks at the ekg monitor: green lines seem to be at war, normal beats marching in formation against wild looking rhythms, the heart working hard and not getting much done. burke's face twitches. burke's voice speaks in frank's head:}
<C>__{burke's voice}
<D>__{go to the bank, boy, take out everything you can.}
<A>__{frank turns up the ekg amplitude:}
<C>__{frank}

<C>__{burke's voice}
<D>__{i'm going. i've had enough.}
<A>__{the alarms start to ring: ekg first, followed by the bells off the oxygen saturation monitor and low drone of ventilator. intern milagros pulling open the curtain behind frank, shaking her head, reaching for the defribilator paddles, handing them to frank. he steps back:}
