<L>__{exterior barbecue}
<A>__{on the turkey roasting over an open fire. it looks golden and juicy. grug is agitated. the croods are devouring the turkey fish.}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{it's an avalanche of flavor.}
<A>__{the croods are eating like wild animals. they practically maul each other for scraps. howls and snarling fill the night air. guy is amazed and shocked at how the croods are wolfing it down. guy sits to the side, his ankle roped to a heavy rock. guy and belt share a concerned look as they politely eat their meal. eep comes over and sits next to guy.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(to belt)}
<D>__{looks like we won't be having any leftovers.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{what are "left overs?"}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{you know, when you have so much food to eat you have some, left over.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{we never have that much food.}
<A>__{grug is struck by eep's words. ugga sees grug is hurt. guy and belt are struck by this as well.}
<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{grug, how about a story?}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{that's a good idea. how about a story huh?}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{yeah a story, tell us a story!}
<A>__{croods gather around grug.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{once upon a time there was a little tiger who lived in a cave with her family. there were a lot of rules, but the big, simple one was to never leave the cave at night. and the door was so heavy, you'd think it would be easy to remember.}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{so easy to remember!}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{i know! but, while everyone was asleep, she went out anyway.}
<C>__{croods}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{yes! and no sooner than she did, her cave was destroyed and everyone had to go on this long, sucky walk, with some weirdo they met, and died! the end.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{whoa! i did not see that coming. twist ending. my stories never end like that.}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{yes! two stories in one night!}
<A>__{the croods leave grug and gather around guy. guy is uncharacteristically dumbstruck. a beat }
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{okay. but it won't be as good as grug's. um, once upon a time, there was a beautiful tiger. she lived in a cave with the rest of her family. her father and mother told her, "you may go anywhere you want but never go near the cliff, for you could fall."}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{and die. good story.}
<A>__{thinking the story is over, the croods begin to get up. as guy begins talking again they settle back down.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{but when no one was looking, she would go near the cliff, for the closer she came to the edge, the more she could hear, the more she could see, the more she could feel. finally, she stood at the very edge, and she saw a light. she leaned out to touch it, and slipped.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{and she fell.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{and she flew.}
<C>__{croods}
<C>__{gasp}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{where did she fly?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{tomorrow.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{tomorrow?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{a place with more suns in the sky than you can count.}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{it would be so bright.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{a place not like today, or yesterday, a place where things are better.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{tomorrow isn't a place, you can't see it!}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{oh yes, yes it is. i've seen it. that's where i'm going.}
<A>__{grug studies guy. is he crazy? eep though is entranced. eep and guy lock eyes. there is something growing between them. grug and belt see it too. grug is not thrilled.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{well, we are going to shut our eyes and sleep. and when we wake up we're going to find the place that has everything we want.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{tomorrow?!}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{a cave.}
<A>__{grug stuffs guy neatly back inside the log. grug curls up by the fire with the log tucked under his arm far away from eep.}
