<A>__{prew, on hands and knees, is on a weeding detail with three other men, one of them sal anderson. another is private nair, a tousle headed, sentimental man we have not seen before. sergeant thornhill, in charge of the detail, lolls on the ground, his head propped against a tree, reading a comic book. prew works his way over to nair.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{you just get out of the stockade?}

<D>__{why don't he go to the c.o.?}
<C>__{nair}
<D>__{we tried to get him to. but he won't peep. he says he got a lot more scalp to lose first. that boy is about the hardest artery in the hospital.}
<P>__{(with great sentiment)}
<D>__{but he's got a heart just like a great big baby.}
<A>__{prew's face has been growing in fury. he pulls up a clump of sod, throws it down with all his might.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{you think he's gonna be all right?}

<A>__{during following men run from across the quadrangle and from out of the barracks to watch the affair, form a circle around the fighters. prew is a skillful boxer, moving around galovitch quickly and cleverly. galovitch is more lumbering but not awkward. his heavy blows stagger prew several times. prew drives his attack at his opponent's body. he never throws a punch at the other's head.}
<C>__{nair}
<D>__{the head, prew! hit him in the head!}
<A>__{the other men around shout similar advice.}
