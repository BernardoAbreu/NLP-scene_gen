<T>__{slam cut to:}
<L>__{exterior castle hall day}
<A>__{anna bursts out of her room, wearing her coronation dress. she finishes pinning ribbons in her hair. seeing the hustle and bustle of preparations, she can't help but sing.}
<D>__{"for the first time in forever"}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{the window is open! so's that door! i didn't know they did that anymore. who knew we owned 8000 salad plates...?}
<A>__{ anna slides along the floor of the ballroom in her socks.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{for years i have roamed these empty halls why have a ballroom with no balls? finally, they're opening up the gates!}
<A>__{ she shakes hands with a suit of armor. breaks it. hides the evidence.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{there'll be real, actual people it'll be totally strange. but wow am i so ready for this change!}
<A>__{ anna comes to a window and jumps out onto a window washer's pulley. she raises herself up to see the ships arriving.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{for the first time in forever, there'll be music, there'll be light. for the first time in forever, i will be dancing through the night.}
<A>__{ anna walks through the garden and follows a family of geese.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{don't know if i'm elated or gassy, but i'm somewhere in that zone 'cause for the first time in forever, i won't be alone.}
<P>__{(speaking)}
<D>__{i can't wait to meet everyone....}
<P>__{(gasp) what if i meet the one?}
<A>__{ anna twists herself in a velvet drape like it's a gown. she acts like she looks gorgeous, but she looks ridiculous.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{tonight, imagine me gown and all fetchingly draped against the wall. the picture of sophisticated grace.}
<A>__{ she notices the bust of a man across the room.}
<C>__{anna }
<P>__{(google eyed)}
<D>__{i suddenly see him standing there, a beautiful stranger tall and fair.}
<P>__{(mouth full of chocolate)}
<D>__{i wanna stuff some chocolate in my face!}
<A>__{ she grabs the bust of the man and swings it around.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{but then we laugh and talk all evening, which is totally bizarre. nothing like the life i've led so far.}
<A>__{the bust goes flying and lands on the top of the cake. anna bursts into the portrait room, bounces on the furniture, and interacts with the paintings.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{for the first time in forever, there'll be magic, there'll be fun. for the first time in forever, i could be noticed by someone. and i know it is totally crazy to dream i'd find romance. but for the first time in forever, at least i've got a chance!}
<A>__{ interior library. elsa, now a very poised 21, watches out the window as the coronation guests arrive.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{don't let them in. don't let them see. be the good girl you always have to be.}
<A>__{elsa moves to a painting of her father's coronation. she takes off her gloves and mimics the painting by holding a candlestick and ornament in place of an orb and scepter.}
<C>__{elsa }
<D>__{conceal. don't feel. put on a show. make one wrong move and everyone will know.}
<A>__{the candlestick and ornament ice over. elsa gasps, slams them back down onto the table. she tries to reassure herself.}
<C>__{elsa }
<D>__{but it's only for today.}
<A>__{we cut between anna's excitement and elsa's nerves.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it's only for today!}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{it's agony to wait.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it's agony to wait!!!}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{tell the guards to open up the gate.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{the gate!!!}
<A>__{ finally, the gates are open! anna moves through the crowd, admiring the people around her.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{for the first time in forever.}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{don't let them in don't let them see}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i'm getting what i'm dreaming of}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{be the good girl you always have to be}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{a chance to leave my sister's world a chance to find true love}
<C>__{elsa}
<D>__{conceal. conceal. don't feel. don't let them know.}
<A>__{ anna hurries over the bridge and into the village square.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{i know it all ends tomorrow, so it has to be today!! `cause for the first time in forever. . . for the first time in forever! nothing's in my way!!!}
<A>__{ anna slams right into the breast of a horse! she falls back and lands in a small wooden boat. it tips off of the dock. she's heading overboard. but just then, the horse slams his hoof into the boat and steadies it.}
<C>__{anna }
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{hey!}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{i'm so sorry. are you hurt?}
<A>__{the rider, hans, sure is handsome and regal.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(gentler)}
<D>__{hey. i ya, no. no. i'm okay.}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{yeah, i just wasn't looking where i was going. but i'm okay.}
<A>__{he hops down from his horse and steps into the boat.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{i'm great, actually.}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{oh, thank goodness.}
<A>__{he offers her a hand and their eyes meet. chemistry. he helps her to her feet.}
<C>__{hans }
<P>__{(bowing)}
<D>__{prince hans of the southern isles.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(curtseying)}
<D>__{princess anna of arendelle.}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{princess...? my lady.}
<A>__{he drops to his knees, head bowed. the horse bows too, curling his hoof up and out of the boat. the boat tips. hans tumbles on top of anna. awkward.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{hi...again.}
<A>__{the horse slams his foot back into the boat to stabilize it. anna and hans tumble the other way. anna lands on top of him.}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{oh boy.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{ha. this is awkward. not you're awkward, but just because we're i'm awkward. you're gorgeous.}
<P>__{(did she just say that?)}
<D>__{wait, what?}
<A>__{hans quickly gets to his feet and helps anna up again.}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{i'd like to formally apologize for hitting the princess of arendelle with my horse...and for every moment after.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no. no no. it's fine. i'm not that princess. i mean, if you'd hit my sister elsa, that would be yeash! `cuz, you know...}
<P>__{(patting the horse)}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{anna }
<P>__{(to hans)}
<D>__{but, lucky you, it's it's just me.}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{just you?}
<A>__{hans smiles, amused. she smiles back. the bells ring. she doesn't notice at first; she's too busy drinking in hans's handsomeness.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{...the bells. the coronation. i i i better go. i have to...i better go.}
<A>__{she hurries off, stops, turns back. gives hans a little wave.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{bye!}
<A>__{as she rushes off again, hans waves back. the horse waves too, once again taking his hoof out of the boat.}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{oh no.}
<A>__{the boat falls, with hans in it. splash! it lands upside down in the water. hans raises it up off of him, gasping for air.}
