<L>__{exterior dock by river night (pouring rain)}
<A>__{a disheveled randolph paces on a deserted dock. the brooklyn bridge looms in the b.g. a car pulls up in the b.g. stokes gets out. randolph moves under an awning.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{i was starting to think that maybe you weren't coming.}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{i agreed to meet you, didn't i? i had a dinner engagement.}
<A>__{randolph takes a swig from a flask.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{really? you know, i used to have dinner engagements. sometimes four, five a night. dinner... drinks... i was the toast of the fucking town.}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{don't start, randolph. please.}
<C>__{randolph}
<P>__{(voice rising)}
<D>__{cars, boats, whores and horses, i had 'em all. when i walked into a restaurant, ten guys reached for my hat. when i stood up to take a piss, they cleared the rest room. i'd walk down the street and traffic stopped, mouths gaped. you know why? you know why, frank?}
<P>__{(now shouting)}
<D>__{i was rainbow fucking randolph! that's why!}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{are you through?}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{what? you're in a hurry? you don't have time for me? the guy who earned for you? the guy who put those fucking suits on your back and the pheasant au vin in your brooklyn mouth?}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{i think it's fair to say we helped each other.}
<A>__{randolph suddenly breaks down.}
<C>__{randolph}
<P>__{(pleading)}
<D>__{you gotta fix it, frank. you gotta get me my slot back.}
<A>__{he now clings to stokes' lapels.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{how can i sit around while that rhinoceros... that horned carpetbagger gets a free ride on my dime? you and i have history, frank! please!}
<A>__{stokes pries randolph's hands from his overcoat.}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{there's nothing i can do for you. nothing. you're a pariah. i can't even be seen with you.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{don't do this to me, frank. i'm in deep, deep shit. they kicked me out of the corporate penthouse... i got bookies breathing down my neck. i'm homeless! don't you hear what i'm saying? i'm not gonna make it! the clock's ticking! put yourself in my shoes, for christ's sake!}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{the ugly truth is, your shoes have become my shoes. as long as the rhino's on the air, everything's by the book. no skim, no percentage. nothing. the network wanted squeaky clean and they got it. and believe me, mopes is sparkling.}
<A>__{he looks randolph squarely in the eye.}
<C>__{stokes}
<D>__{you're totally broke? you don't have a dime left to your name?}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{yes! exactly! that's what i'm trying to tell you!}
<A>__{randolph looks at him hopefully as stokes straightens his tie.}
<C>__{stoke}
<D>__{don't contact me again, randy. ever.}
<A>__{stokes walks off. randolph watches him disappear through the mist.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{you'll get yours, frank! the rhino too! do you hear me?! the wheels are turning!}
<A>__{stokes is gone. randolph takes a swig from his flask and wipes his chin with his sleeve. he stares out at the river.}
<C>__{randolph}
<P>__{(quietly to himself)}
<D>__{sooner or later, even a guy who's squeaky clean falls into mud.}
<B>__{thunder clap.}
