<B>__{various shots of the rally}
<A>__{hawkers selling _the messenger_, faces of fruit of islam near the podium; lorraine, sidney, earl, benjamin, and bembry. for the first time a new note is seen in bembry's face: reserve bordering on resentment. when others around him cheer malcolm, bembry is cool. sidney notices this from his father, but makes no comment.}
<D>__{malcolm his voice the honorable elijah muhammad teaches us that god is now about to establish a kingdom on this earth based on brotherhood and [...] against peace, his history on this earth has proved that. nowhere in history has he been brotherly toward anyone. the only time he has been brotherly toward you is when he can use you, when he can exploit you, when he can oppress you, when you will submit to him. and since his own history makes him unqualified to be an inhabitant or a citizen in a kingdom of brotherhood, the honorable elijah muhammad teaches us that god is about to eliminate that particular race from this earth. so since they are due for elimination, we don't want to be with them.}

<D>__{if the so called negro were american citizens we wouldn't have a race problem. if the emancipation proclamation was authentic, you wouldn't have a race problem. if the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments to the constitution was authentic, you wouldn't have a race problem. if the supreme court desegregation decision was authentic, you wouldn't have a race problem. all of this is hypocrisy. these negro leaders have been telling the white man everything is all right, everything is under control. and they've been telling the white man that mr. muhammad is wrong, don't listen to him. but everything mr. muhammad has been saying is going to come to pass is now coming to pass and now the negro leaders are standing up saying that we are about to have a racial explosion. we're going to have a racial explosion and that's more dangerous than an atomic explosion.}

<D>__{it's going to explode because black people are dissatisfied. they're dissatisfied now not only with the white man, but with these negroes who have been sitting around here posing as leaders and spokesmen for black people. anytime you put too many sparks around a powder keg, the thing is going to explode and if the thing that explodes is still inside the house, then the house will be destroyed. so the honorable elijah muhammad is telling the white man get this powder keg out of your house, let the black people in this country separate from him while there's still time. and if the black man is allowed to separate and go on onto some land of his own, where he can solve his problems, then there won't be any explosion. complete separation is the only solution to the black and white problem in this country!!!}
