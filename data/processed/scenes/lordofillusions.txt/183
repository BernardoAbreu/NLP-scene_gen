<L>__{interior nix's house sanctum night}
<A>__{high, wide shot of the room, as butterfield approaches the body of nix. it lies on a table, surrounded by bowls of oil. bandages, soaked in oil, are laid over its limbs. beside its head, butterfield's instruments are laid out. on dorothea, crouched in the corner of the room, terrified as she watches butterfield remove the multi part mask screwed into nix's face. he works with surgical precision.}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{listen. you've got everything you want. you don't need me. ..}
<A>__{a piece of the mask comes away from the cheek. a subtle power plucks at dust around the room, disturbing it minutely. we cut close : to dorothea's face throughout this sequence (on occasion her eyeball fills the screen) as she sees these signs of disturbance in the ether, growing in magnitude.}
<C>__{butterfield}
<D>__{no, but he will. after what you did to him.}
<A>__{he pulls a piece of the mask from nix's mouth.}
<C>__{butterfield}
<D>__{he'll want vengeance. simple ps that.}
