<L>__{exterior alley where tin tin got it night}
<A>__{cop lights bounce, competing with the trash fires. albrecht and several other uniforms assess the double death scene. a detective, torres tries to appear in charge.}
<C>__{torres}
<D>__{couldn't have happened to a nicer couple.}
<A>__{angle albrecht and torres over dead tin tin tin tin frozen in deathshock, all of his knives sticking out of him. dead ratso, b.g., where he fell.}

<C>__{albrecht}
<D>__{who ever made that.}
