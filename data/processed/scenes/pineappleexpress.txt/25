<L>__{exterior forest continuous}
<A>__{the car is parked on a small dirt path in the moon lit woods. dale paces back and forth as saul walks over.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{so what do we know? nothing. we may or may not be followed because we don't even know if he found the roach or not. and, we could just be completely crazy. but, the question is this: even if he found the roach, how could he know where you were?}
<C>__{saul}
<P>__{(thrilled)}
<D>__{he couldn't. cause i'm in the woods. it's impossible! unless he's, like, hanging on the bottom of the car or some shit, but i mean }
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{no, what i mean is, if ted found the roach and identified the weed, how could he connect it to you?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{there's no way. he could only find out from red.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{who is this red guy?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{red's pretty much a middleman between ted and guys like me. and we're mad fucking tight. one time he convinced some girl he knew to give me a hand job within, like, five minutes of me meeting her.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{but let's say someone calls asking who he sold this pineapple weed to, he'll say you, because...why wouldn't he?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{fuck that. that's bullshit. he would have called me if that happened. a hand job, dale! imagine if i'd gotten you a hand job by now!}

<D>__{yeah, but saul, he's a fucking drug dealer.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{so? i'm a fuckin' drug dealer. what, you don't trust me then?}
<A>__{saul stares at dale, who doesn't know how to respond.}
<C>__{dale}
