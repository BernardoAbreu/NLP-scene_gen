<A>__{with choreographed precision, swann removes the sword and scabbard from the presentation case, held by a uniformed navy man. he slides the sword into the scabbard, holds it out vertically to norrington, in full dress uniform. norrington grasps the scabbard above swann's hand, and swann lets go. norrington draws the sword, flourishes the sword, and snaps the blade up in front of his face. swann steps forward, pins a medal to norrington's jacket, steps back. norrington nods, turns smartly and nods to his fellow officers, turns again and nods to the audience dignitaries, merchants, plantation owners, their families. another flourish, and he returns the sword to its scabbard. the silence is broken by loud applause. backslapping from the navy men. in the audience, elizabeth doesn't look so good, out beneath the hot sun. she applauds briefly, then winces. discreetly tries to adjust the corset through the material of the dress, then resumes clapping, trying to hide her discomfort.}
