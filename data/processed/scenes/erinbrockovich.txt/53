<L>__{interior erin's hyundai day}
<A>__{erin looks around. the house she's passing has been razed. a heap of lumber and wires in the middle of the property. as she checks the piece of paper with donna's address, she drives by the pg&e compressor station, a massive gray structure of pipes, chimneys and ladders, set way back from the road. erin passes it without noticing it. she stops at an intersection. the house on the corner has been boarded up with plywood. erin notices it depressing then turns the corner onto donna's street.}
