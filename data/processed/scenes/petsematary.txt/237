<L>__{exterior jud crandall's garden, with jud}
<A>__{the garden is a plot of about half an acre. jud comes trundling slowly along a row, pushing a wheelbarrow. there are several pumpkins in it. jud is wearing old khaki gardening pants and a ramones sweatshirt. he's wearing his headphones and we can hear the romantics doing "what i like about you." jud is singing along and bopping a little as much as his arthritis will allow, if you can dig it. he sees a real big pumpkin, stops, and bends over to get it. he takes out his pocket knife and slits the pumpkin vine. he gets the pumpkin in his arms and stands up. he turns...and louis is right there (kind of a cheap jump, but always fun), looking totally stunned. jud, startled, drops the pumpkin. louis reaches out and slides the phones off jud's ears.}
