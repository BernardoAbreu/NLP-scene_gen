<B>__{alex}
<A>__{climbs into the row, carrying his backpack. he takes his window seat and reaches up to the air flow valve. close air flow valve turns, hissing, air streaming full blast. camera inches in on him as he takes in deep breaths of the stale air. he presses his face to the window. alex's pov the left wing rain falls. gears whir as the ailerons are tested. close alex camera creeps toward him, face to the glass; eyes scanning the plane and outside area.}

<A>__{as alex sits, the tray table falls from its upright position. he lifts the tray back up, but as he turns the latch, it breaks off in his hand. he briefly tries to jimmie the tray into postition, then gives up. camera follows alex's hand as it rises. camera sweeps in extreamly close to the attendant call button. as alex's finger engages the button, it lights up orange.}
<B>__{alex}
<A>__{the jet lurches. he looks... out of the window alex's pov the 747 begins rolling out of the gate.}

<B>__{alex}
<A>__{o.s., the engine volume increases in pitch and intensity as the jet begins to taxi. alex sits back as the tray over his lap. he looks out the window. alex's pov the right wing appears motionless in the f.g. as the tarmac and runway signs roll past the window. the engine pitch rises...}
<B>__{alex}
<A>__{the engines whir as the jet gathers speed. he checks the window. alex's pov the runway is a blur. the airport terminals in the b.g. streak past. the wings lift, angled as the jet leaves the ground.}
<B>__{alex}
<A>__{o.s., his classmates cheer and "raise the roof." the trip has begun. camera pulls away from alex, as if reflecting his easing of annoyance with the tray situation. he finally appears to notice the raucous reaction and settles back in his seat, slightly pushed by mild g force. the upwarding angle increasing... the cabin buffets, as if passing mild turbulance. then... the cabin sharply jolts! everyone tenses, gasps. camera sweeps back to alex. and just as he clenches his backpack... the cabin bangs, rocks. the engines spool to a stall. metal twists under extreme pressure. the cabin dips, angles, sharply to the right. alex's pov the cabin passengers scream! unrestrained personal belongings fly across the aircraft into camera, which buffets and shakes...}

<B>__{alex}
<A>__{breaths deep into his oxygen cup. the jet engines grind and whir, as if the craft were in the midst of a last ditch effort to regain stability; the sounds deafening over the passengers' cruelly hopeless screams. then... ka boom a devastating explosion erupts across the cabin, blasting a five foot hole in the fuseluge. human limbs and blood spray, craft and passengers torn to shreds. dead students sit lifeless in their seats. every unrestrained object on board flies to the hole and through the fire; paper, books, luggage, pillows. a parent and a student clutch their seat in terror, screaming before they are pulled into the sky. wind. screams. dying engines, a deafening blare.}
<B>__{alex and tod}
<A>__{scream, pale, knowing there is no hope, no escape as the engines die. the cabin begins to tilt downwards... then straight down. debris tumbles toward the flight deck as if falling from a cliff. outside... the sick familiar sound of an aircraft going down. alex is strapped to his seat, upper body facing downward toward the water. fire, wind, and blood whip across him. a building whine crescendoes before a second explosion rips across frame...}
