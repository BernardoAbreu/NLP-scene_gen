<D>__{you'll likelier lose an eye, mr. lyons, if you carry on prating at me how to manage my son! or my plow, or my horse, or my field, or my farm!}
<A>__{dad sits nearby, watching this exchange with silent approval. lyons stares at her, gape mouthed, as she turns her attention back to albert.}
<C>__{mrs. narracott}
<D>__{come on, albie! push on through!}
<A>__{the rain becomes torrential. lyons turns towards the car gestures, frustrated, to his driver, who runs forward with the umbrella to shield his boss from the rain. david remains on the running board, watching albert plowing. the plow speeds through the earth. the boy and the horse are working as one. it is a moment of triumph.}
