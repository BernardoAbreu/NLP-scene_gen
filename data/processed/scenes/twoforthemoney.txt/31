<A>__{chump change, brandon. we're angling for bigger fish here. you see, the networks don't talk about it and uncle sam can't tax it, but sports gambling is a 200 billion dollar a year business. these gamblers have needs, brandon. come monday morning, after a losing weekend, a lot of them have big needs. walter presses a button and the tvs fill with football games.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{that's every pro game played last sunday. do you know why monday night's the most watched game of the week? it's because monday's the last chance bettors have to climb out of the hole before paying their bookies on tuesday. sports betting's illegal in 49 states, including this one, but what we do is 100% legal it's exactly the same as a stock broker, only instead of touting stocks, we advise people on how to bet. we make the big money off our client list. you see, when a client wins with our advice we take a percentage, which they gladly give to keep getting our picks. when they lose we get zip. so the object here, my tall, athletic, religious friend is to win. walter clicks a control and his face fills the wall of tvs. phone numbers and messages ("football selections!" college and pro!" "basketball picks!") flash on the screens. it's a high octane infomercial for sports gamblers.}
