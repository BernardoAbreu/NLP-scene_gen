<L>__{interior rosenberg and goldstein's apartment}
<A>__{harold and kumar walk into an apartment that looks almost identical to theirs. (instead of a "billy madison" poster, there's one of "happy gilmore.") sitting on the couch is rosenberg (a seemingly "nice jewish boy," wearing khakis and a sweater) and goldstein (a more depraved jewish boy, wearing a t shirt with a picture of the olsen twins underneath the picture we see the words, "finally legal on june 13, 2004"). both of them are taking bong hits (out of a shofar bong) while watching tv as harold and kumar enter...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{rosenberg, goldstein get up. we're going to white castle.}
<A>__{rosenberg and goldstein continue staring at the tv...}
<C>__{rosenberg}
<D>__{wait we're watching the gift on hbo.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{no waiting. we're starving...}
<A>__{out of the corner of kumar's eye, he notices harold grabbing a piece of beef jerky from rosenberg & goldstein's coffee table.}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(scolding harold)}
<D>__{...put that down! we're not eating `til we get to white castle.}
<A>__{harold acts like he's going to put the jerky back, but as soon, as kumar turns his attention back to rosenberg and goldstein, he slips it his pocket.}
<C>__{kumar}
<P>__{(to rosenberg and goldstein)}
<D>__{now come on guys, let's go.}
<C>__{goldstein}
<D>__{sorry man! we're not going anywhere. supposedly, katie holmes shows her milk paps in this movie!}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{is that all you jews ever think about? tits?}
<C>__{rosenberg}
<D>__{we're talking about katie holmes here. you would never think a sweet, innocent girl like her would ever take her top off. which is precisely why we have to watch her do it.}
<C>__{goldstein}
<A>__{dude, the things i'd eat out of her ass, you have no idea.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<A>__{bacon, shellfish, milk with meat, you name it...}
<C>__{rosenberg}
<P>__{(to goldstein)}
<D>__{that's a very vulgar statement.}
<C>__{goldstein}
<D>__{so is "i want to pound britney spears in the pussy." but it's true.}
<C>__{rosenberg}
<D>__{touche.}
<P>__{(to harold and kumar)}
<D>__{anyway, if you guys want to wait till the movie's over...}
<A>__{harold and kumar have already shut the door.}
