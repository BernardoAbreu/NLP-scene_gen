<A>__{sarah and ginger are crammed into the tiny bathroom, becoming inextricably tangled in each other's cords as they blow dry, curl hair, and apply make up. ginger has her headphones inverted under her chin but in place, and is bouncing to music as she dries her hair. she is wearing a short terry cloth bathrobe that reveals the greater part of her legs. sarah is in a skirt and bra. the phone rings and sarah goes out into the living room to get it.}

<D>__{...and then slowly pull your jeans off inch by inch and lick your belly in circles, further and further down... then i will pull off your panties with my teeth...}
<A>__{sarah is repressing laughter.}
