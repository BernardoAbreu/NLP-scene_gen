<A>__{jeff, who is still staring out the window, has a look of sudden discovery on his face. he calls quickly:}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{lisa lisa on the shelf over there get me the small yellow box }
<A>__{he turns halfway around, and points. we see lisa moving behind him toward the shelf. he adds:}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{and that little viewer.}
<A>__{he turns back to the window, holding out his right hand to the side, waiting for the box and viewer. the camera pulls back a little as lisa comes up, and places the box and viewer in his hand. he opens the box, which contains color slides, and holds one or two of the slides up to the light. lisa looks down at him curiously and stella comes forward from the background.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(half to himself as he searches slides)}
<D>__{these aren't more than two weeks old i hope i didn't take all leg art.}
<P>__{(discovers the right slide)}
<D>__{i think this is the one.}
<A>__{puts the other slides to one side and puts the selected one onto the viewer, with sounds of satisfaction. as he lifts the viewer to his eyes lisa asks impatiently:}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{jeff what are you looking for?}
<A>__{he squints out through the viewer, then looks away a moment without it.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{something that if i'm right might solve a murder.}
<A>__{he looks back through the viewer.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{mrs. thorwald?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{uh uh. the dog. i think i know now why thorwald killed it.}
<A>__{he takes the viewer from his eye, hands it to lisa.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{you take a look and tell me what you see.}
