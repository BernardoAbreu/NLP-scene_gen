<A>__{everyone stiffens as victoria walks in. acknowledging the other diners with a quick nod, the queen takes her place. she flaps open her napkin and, bang on cue, everyone else sits and does the same. the meal is served immediately by waiting servants, who plonk the food down without ceremony. it's a very ordinary meal of meat and vegetables. victoria starts eating heartily, straight away. everyone does the same. only the clink of cutlery and the same eerie silence.}
