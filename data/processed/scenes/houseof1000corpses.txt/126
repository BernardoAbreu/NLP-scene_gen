<L>__{interior pit night}
<A>__{denise, waist high in sludge, wanders lost through the endless tunnels of the pit. in the distance she hears high pitched animal sounds. a ghoul rises up from the sludge behind denise. it stands silent. it reaches out a boney hand with long curled fingernails and grabs her hair. denise screams and tries to pull away. the ghoul grabs her with his other hand and pulls her closer, clawing at her face. denise fights her way free, but loses her footing and falls backwards, slipping under the sludge. she quickly resurfaces and starts to run.}
