<L>__{exterior courtyard night}
<A>__{hull and betty are about to enter hull's room. the door is ajar.}
<L>__{interior hull's room night}
<A>__{taft stands at the dresser. he's found hull's collection of memorabilia and is looking at the photo of his children.}
<C>__{taft}
<D>__{cute kids...}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(angry at the invasion)}
<D>__{give me that.}
<A>__{he snatches away the photo, but not before betty sees it. she reaches out her hand. he reluctantly turns it over to her.}
<C>__{taft}
<D>__{tell me something, who the fuck are you?}
<A>__{hull doesn't answer, collects the rest of his things, including the bloody money, stuffs it back in the envelope.}
<C>__{taft}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{'cause i don't think you're quite the asshole you're trying to be.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{look, mr. taft, that's your name, right? leave me alone. i got things on my mind.}
<C>__{taft}
<D>__{i'd think you would. you better have your goddamn life on your mind, or it's gonna get away from you. it's gonna burn up like that poor woman across the way. like all of you's gonna burn...}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{and what do you do, mr. taft, except chase bad guys up and down the street with your dirty partner, never catching anybody important?}
<C>__{taft}
<D>__{i do what i can. do you do what you can?}
<P>__{(hull says nothing)}
<D>__{maybe my partner was dirty. maybe the chief's dirty. and the mayor. and the president. maybe god himself's taking something on the side. that's their problem. but i will bust 'em if i can.}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(without force)}
<D>__{get out of my room.}
<C>__{taft}
<D>__{don't deny who you are.}
<A>__{he leaves. hull turns to betty who is still holding the photo of his children. he gently takes it, looks at it, seems to draw both succor and pain from it. he gets out carver's flask and tries to drink, but it's empty.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{they're my children. they live in cleveland with their mother. i'm divorced from her. i haven't seen them in... some time. i want to, but i haven't been able to arrange it.}
<C>__{mccutcheon}
<D>__{how much else don't i know about you?}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(trying to make a joke)}
<D>__{everything else... everything else is... i don't know.}
<C>__{mccutcheon}
<D>__{taft has all the evidence about my laundering.}
<A>__{hull's upset.}
<C>__{mccutcheon}
<D>__{he's going to put me in jail for a long time unless i give you up.}
<C>__{hull}
<D>__{do it.}
<C>__{mccutcheon}
<D>__{i can't. so, i've got to get away. far away. but i need money.}
<C>__{hull}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{money? i got money...}
<A>__{he empties his pockets of all that gushed out of the winnebago, empties a satchel as well until it fills the room like snow.}
