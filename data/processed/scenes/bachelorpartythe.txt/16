<T>__{fade in :}
<A>__{with a big loud blare on eighth street in greenwich village on a warm august night. packed sidewalks, jammed traffic, taxis, trucks, buses, honking of horns, etc. man we're going to have a ball type feeling.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior. street night}
<A>__{thirteenth street off sixth avenue not so blary and lit up as the main drags, but traffic is heavy, and there are lots of people on the sidewalks. there are a number of restaurants dotting the street with their little striped awnings and modest neons. if we are on our toes, we notice one neon that reads: "louie's."}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior. louie's restaurant}
<A>__{the entire interior isn't too much to show, really. it's a small restaurant, but it is packed. waiters scurry here and there. people jammer and jab. hustle and bustle. in background, we can pick out our bachelor party, five men now, clustered around a table, yakking it up. wide shot of our bachelor party, showing all five. they all seem to be in the best of spirits. the new member of the cast is arnold, the groom, a towheaded, pleasant looking young man of thirty, shy to the point of being noticeable. of all the men at the party, he is the quietest. he sits, a smile nailed onto his face, turning his head from one friend to another as they talk, enjoying the rare privilege of being liked. the dinner is over. during the ensuing scene, a bus boy continues to remove the used dishes. several large bottles of beer and two fifths of scotch are on the table. there is a welter of variously assorted glasses. eddie, walter, and kenneth are smoking cigars, charlie a cigarette. the groom is not smoking. we have cut into the scene during a jumble of conversation. walter is talking to charlie, whose head is bent toward the older man. kenneth is trying to tell the groom a joke, but the groom's attention is being distracted by eddie, who is leaning across the table trying to get charlie's attention. ad libs.}

<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(bellowing out)}
<D>__{the best fighting outfit in the whole fighting army was the fighting hundred and fourth infantry division, general terry allen commanding!}
<A>__{this brings the jumbled conversation to a halt. walter surveys the other four, looking for possible challenges, then sits heavily down.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{well, now that we got that settled....}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm with you, walter.}

<D>__{i'd like to make a little speech to our guest of honor and mutual friend, arnold craig. arnold, a bunch of us down the office, the girls too, all chipped in, and we got you a couple of small gifts....}
<A>__{eddie crosses to extra chair, picks up wrapped gifts, crosses back to his place.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(whispering to kenneth)}
<D>__{these are the gag gifts.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{let's see, what's this one? oh, yeah. arnold, we figured louise might be very sleepy on your wedding night, so we thought you might want something to keep you warm.}
<A>__{walter leans forward to see what the tissue wrapped parcel arnold is now unwrapping is.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{what is it? what is it?}
<A>__{arnold holds a hot water bottle aloft. walter is seized with a paroxysm of laughter at this immensely rabelaisian gift.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{it's a hot water bottle!}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{okay, walter, okay.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{hey, did you see that? hey, he bought him a hot water bottle for his wedding night. hey, that's funny ...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{hey, eddie, you should have bought him an ice pack for after tonight.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(holding a second parcel)}
<D>__{walter, take it easy.... now, this one, arnold, this one is something to keep you busy on cold winter nights.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(crosses to arnold; to the others)}
<D>__{this ought to be good.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{look at walter.}
<A>__{walter has come around behind arnold's chair and can hardly wait to see what the next joke is.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{hey, these are funny. who bought these? you buy these, eddie? these are funny. you got a good sense of humor.}
<A>__{arnold unwraps the parcel, holds out a miniature baby bottle. this is too much for walter; how funny can you get? he clutches his sides.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{hey, did you guys see that? hey, did you guys see that?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{come on, walter, sit down.}
<A>__{charlie and kenneth are smiling appreciatively. walter crosses with bottle, sits, starts pouring whisky into baby bottle.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{eddie got a good sense of humor, you know?}
<C>__{kenneth}
<P>__{(to charlie)}
<D>__{boy, old walter is crocked.}
<C>__{arnold}
<P>__{(smiling, rising halfway in his chair)}
<D>__{listen, i want to thank you. really. i really want to thank you fellows.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{we haven't got to the serious presents yet, arnold.}
<A>__{a hush falls over the assembled guests. arnold composes his face into a solemn expression and looks down at the cluttered table.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(solemnly)}
<D>__{well, in all seriousness, arnold, seriously, i don't know why you picked me to be your best man, but i am deeply honored. i guess it's because we're both dodger fans, and i'm going to miss you at next tuesday's night game when the pittsburgh pirates invade ebbets field. we always had a lot of fun together, and, seriously, arnold, in all seriousness, good luck on your wedding, but see if you can't get out of the house occasionally, see a night game or even a sunday doubleheader with your old buddy, eddie.}
<A>__{this touching address has brought a note of sadness to the gathering. indeed, there are tears in walter's and arnold's eyes.}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(handing arnold}
<D>__{two neatly wrapped}
<P>__{packages)}
<D>__{well, anyway, in all seriousness, here are a couple of presents from all of us in the office and good luck.}
<A>__{arnold takes the presents, stands, head bowed. eddie sits and all faces turn to arnold.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{well, i just want to thank you fellows. i don't know what to say. i just want to thank you.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{open the presents, arnold.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{i will. i just want to say, eddie, that when the pirates invade ebbets field next tuesday night, i'm going to be sitting right there in section 37 there right with you.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you'll be on your honeymoon next tuesday, arnold.}
<A>__{this interesting information gives arnold pause.}
<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{gee, that's right.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{arnold, you're getting married sunday, did you forget?}

<P>__{(frowning fuzzily)}

<C>__{arnold}
<D>__{boy, it's here, isn't it? i guess i've been running around so much the last couple of weeks, i guess the wedding snuck up on me.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{i think arnold's having a little buck fever. does anyone know what our waiter looks like?}
<C>__{eddie}
<P>__{(to kenneth)}
<D>__{you know who didn't want to chip in for arnold's presents? ...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{arnold'll be all right. have a drink, arnold.}
<C>__{walter}
