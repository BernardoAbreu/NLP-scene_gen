<L>__{interior bijou apartment day}
<A>__{the small apartment above the projection booth is quite a contrast to the rest of the theater. it's neat as a pin, and fairly lit, as harry has just pulled back the curtains, allowing the sun to flood the room. a beam of golden light falls across a table, atop which are}
<B>__{several framed photos.}
<A>__{one of the photos is of the real, much younger luke. it's a norman rockwell scene, at a train depot, with an army issue olive drab duffel bag slung over his shoulder. he has one arm around harry and the other around his mother. (and by the way, pete's resemblance to the real luke even in a nearly 10 year old photo is pretty damn startling...)}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{the day you shipped out. that was a proud day for your mother and me. last time you saw her. last time i saw you.}
<A>__{he smiles.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{till today.}
<A>__{luke sets it down and picks up another photo, that of a fine looking woman. it's a formal portrait, dating perhaps from the 30's.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{that's lily. your mother, rest her soul.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(repeating)}
<D>__{mother.}
<P>__{(to harry)}
<D>__{she's beautiful.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(coming over)}
<D>__{well, yes, that she was. she certainly made this place a home.}
<A>__{he takes the picture from luke, kisses it, and gently replaces it on the table. luke goes over to the sofa and sits.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(brightly)}
<D>__{can i get you anything? i can put some coffee on or some...}
<A>__{harry looks at luke, who has almost instantly fallen asleep on the sofa. he goes to him, gently picks his feet off the floor, lifts them onto the sofa. removes his shoes, sets them on the floor.}
