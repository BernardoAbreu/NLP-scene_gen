<L>__{interior the. st. jerome hotel elevator bank same time}
<A>__{the elevator opens and we see harling step from the elevator with his knapsack over his shoulder. teva sandals, sunglasses.}
<L>__{interior the st. jerome hotel whip's room morning}
<A>__{whip has a towel around his neck as he tries to sip coffee. charlie sits opposite him at the small table by the window. the door bursts open, and harling storms in.}
<C>__{harling mays}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{come mista tally man tally me banana...whip, what's the deal man you look like you're hurtin' for certain...shut the door, interior lock!}
<A>__{harling places a leather doctor's bag on the table. an anxious charlie reaches for the bag which sets harling into a frenzy.}
<C>__{harling mays }
<D>__{you do not touch the merch motherfucker!!!}
<A>__{it's quiet as harling gives orders.}
<C>__{harling mays }
<D>__{everyone except whip and myself take three steps away from the table.}
<A>__{as they step away, harling now pulls a beautiful silver framed mirror from his bag and a blue coke grinder, he calmly but sternly delivers orders...}
<C>__{harling mays }
<D>__{i need three things.}
<P>__{(focuses on charlie)}
<D>__{two glasses of water, a credit card and a hundred dollar bill.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{all i have is a twenty.}
<C>__{harling mays}
<P>__{(takes the card and bill)}
<D>__{that'll do. and i need to make a coco puff.}
<A>__{harling tosses a pack of smokes to charlie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{a what?}
<A>__{hugh takes the smokes from charlie and pulls out a cigarette. harling stops grinding, opens the lid and pours out a nice smooth pile of coke. he begins a masterful ballet of cocaine manipulation.}
<C>__{hugh}
<D>__{millions of dollars hang in the balance.}
<A>__{hugh is removing the last quarter of an inch of tobacco from the end of the cigarette.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{they hang on the consumption of a 300 dollar bag of cocaine.}
<A>__{harling uses the credit card to groom the coke into neat piles and lines. he has a system. whip's head sags as he again appears ready to pass out.}
<C>__{harling mays}
<D>__{okay whip, just two small whiffs first...one on each side...just a primer.}
<A>__{using the mirror as a tray, harling holds the rolled up 20 dollar bill just above the line of coke. whip slowly manages to place his face in position to ingest the coke. it's tense as his head wobbles. he finally zeroes in and snorts the first line. harling quickly switches nostrils. whip sniffs the other side.}
<C>__{harling mays }
<D>__{atta boy, head back now. swallow. water, chief, you! water.}
<A>__{charlie puts the glass of water to whip's mouth. whip drinks.}
<C>__{harling mays }
<P>__{(snaps his fingers)}
<D>__{coco puff...}
<A>__{hugh hands harling the cigarette with a slightly hollowed out tip. harling leans over the coke with the cigarette in his mouth and hoovers up a small pile, sucking the coke through the cigarette. harling sits up, careful to keep the cocaine in the end of the cigarette. he tips it up and lights it.}
<C>__{harling mays }
<D>__{little coco puff buddy. c'mon banana man. who's the banana man?}
<A>__{whip's head levels a look to harling with a smile that leads us to believe that he is actually making a rally.}
<C>__{harling mays }
<D>__{good man, focus up big dog. here's the train comin' to you.}
<A>__{harling takes a puff and holds it as he extends the cocaine cigarette to whip. whip is more nimble now as he cocks his head in acceptance of the cigarette. whip takes a drag and holds it.}
<C>__{harling mays }
<P>__{(still holding the smoke)}
<D>__{keep it down big dog, banana boat's comin' tell me the banana boat's comin'...}
<A>__{whip finally exhales the smoke, harling does too. whip smiles.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{the banana boat is here.}
<C>__{harling mays}
<D>__{nothing can keep you down dog. nothing keeps the big dog down.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{okay, we gotta go.}
<A>__{harling has crafted 4 big lines now, he snorts one himself in record time. looks to hugh and charlie.}
<C>__{harling mays}
<D>__{you guys are up.}
<C>__{hugh}
<D>__{no, i'm good. charlie?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{are you fucking crazy?}
<A>__{whip jumps in and sniffs 2 huge lines. he looks to harling.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{thanks brother, i'm back.}
<A>__{harling gathers his things, stands and hugs whip.}
<C>__{harling mays}
<D>__{i love you man.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{i love you too.}
<A>__{hugh and charlie are quiet as they watch the strange but sincere drug fueled emotion pass between two old friends. harling eyes charlie before handing him a baggie.}
<C>__{harling mays}
<D>__{there's a gram in here, you paid for it and he might need it. my work here is done. see you all on the dark side of the moon.}
<A>__{harling leaves and our trio exchange looks, "did that just happen?"}
