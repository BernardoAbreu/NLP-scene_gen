<A>__{the room is dark. thomas is tied firmly to the bed. the cords cut into thomas's wrists and thomas can't reach the knots, but mars made one mistake: he tied thomas to the headboard posts, and one of the newels has been loose for years thomas stretches against the ropes to reach the newel, then twists it back and forth. he works it harder and harder until the newel slides off its pin, and suddenly his hand is free, though still tied to the newel thomas peels the tape from his mouth, then unties the remaining binds and frees himself from the newel. he slips off his bed and crawls along the wall to his closet }
