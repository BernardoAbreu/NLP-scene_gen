<L>__{exterior trans siberian restaurant. side entrance day}
<D>__{the side door opens to reveal a hard looking, handsome russian man (nikolai), who stops to groom his hair back from his face and put on a pair of sunglasses as he emerges into daylight. he steps into a small courtyard, where a fierce doberman dog is barking and snarling on the end of a chain. nikolai is followed by kirill, who is a little younger, slim and pretty but hard looking too. kirill is dressed in a crumpled t shirt and jeans and looks like he had a heavy night. nikolai ignores the dog as he walks by but kirill yells at it and teases it with a whoop and few russian curses. nikolai unbolts the gate to the street.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{so you pick up ozim and his bitch of a wife and you bring them back here. he glances back at the restaurant and speaks softly.}
<C>__{kirill }
<D>__{then i will think of an excuse and we can get away.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i will think of an excuse. your excuses are like fucking fairy tales. kirill grins and nikolai flicks the fob of his car keys. the lights on an expensive black mercedes glow in response. kirill notices anna locking up her bike at the front of the restaurant.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{who the fuck's that? they both see anna removing her crash helmet and shaking out her hair. she walks towards the front door.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{maybe somebody sent your dad a hooker for christmas.}
<C>__{kirill}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{you're so... fucking unbelievably disrespectful. kirill sees that nikolai is studying anna and his grin fades. we sense jealousy.}
<C>__{kirill }
<D>__{hey, you've got work to do. go... kirill grabs nikolai's face to distract him, gives him a playful slap, but there is somehow more to it than playfulness. nikolai gets into his car. kirill glares at anna as she approaches the front of the restaurant.}
