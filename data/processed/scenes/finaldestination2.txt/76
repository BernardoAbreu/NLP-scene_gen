<A>__{small town station. only one patrol car. in the patrol car, isabella buckles up in the sho tgun seat, the belt stretched tightly across her belly. deputy steve tries the ignition, but the car won't start.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{damn, they always stick me with the clunker.}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{take my van!}

<A>__{kat's expedition speeds through a yellow light and continues on. close on expedition's left tire metal sheers away more rubber.}
<B>__{inside the expedition}
<A>__{rory, antsy, rubbing his nostrils, stares at two yankee tickets.}
<C>__{rory}
<D>__{here's what i don't get. for nine months, death does all this shit to make sure i win these tickets and end up on route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up...}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{rory}
<D>__{but why single me out? what am i in the great scheme of things? you'd think i stepped off flight 180 or something... fucking weird, man.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{you want weird? last year, my partner and i were heading out for the graveyard shift. a call comes in about a train wreck and frank decides to let me handle it alone.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{frank died that night in a shootout. i'd be dead too if that call had come in just ten seconds later.}
<A>__{everyone nods in that 'life's weird' reverence kind of way.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{i got that beat. so like, last may, i was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in pennsylvania. there was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night.}
