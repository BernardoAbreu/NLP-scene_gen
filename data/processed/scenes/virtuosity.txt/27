<A>__{inside parker's squad car parker drives through a residential neighborhood. 9 pm. madison points to a house on the right.}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{not this one, but the next one. the one with the bicycle out front...}
<A>__{parker stops in front of a modest, but wellkept, house.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i will wait out here.}
<A>__{madison pockets the car keys, then reveals a pair of handcuffs. she latches one cuff to the steering wheel, and holds up the other toward parker.}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{give me your wrist.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{give me a goddam break. i'm not going to go anywhere alone.}
<C>__{madison}
<D>__{and i'm going to make sure of it.}
<P>__{(not wavering)}
<D>__{give me your wrist.}
<A>__{parker relents, and holds up his wrist. madison places the cuff around it, then gets out of the car. outside madison's house madison walks up the steps to the front porch. she is immediately intercepted by her daughter, karin, 7, who bursts out of the front door and leaps into her arms.}
<C>__{karin}
<D>__{mommy's home! mommy's home!}
<A>__{karin's baby sitter opens the door for madison as she carries her daughter inside. parker stares from squad car in surprise. even disbelief. he had no idea madison was a mother. moments later, karin comes back out and sits on the front steps. staring at parker. with fascination. curiosity. wondering who this strange man is, and why he's sitting in a police car outside her house. but not saying a word. parker stares back as if carrying on a silent conversation with her. a multitude of expressions passing over his face as memories of his own daughter flash through his mind.}
