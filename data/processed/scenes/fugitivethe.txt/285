<A>__{the phone rings nine, ten times. as kimble waits he looks down at his list of five. the only name remaining is fredrick sykes. he looks down the street it seems clear then his focus shifts to a man carrying two coffees. he approaches a car parked along the curb. the passenger a woman leans across the seat and opens the door for him. he hands her a cup of coffee and as he starts to climb in, he shifts something on his hip we see the butt of a handgun. kimble hangs up and leaves through the back door.}
