<A>__{utah pops into frame, arms extended, one leg in front of the other, torso bent at the waist: classic surfing stance. suddenly, he drops out of frame. we pull back revealing utah on his board, on the sand.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{do it again.}
<A>__{tyler is making him "pop" up to his feet. again and again. gawkers stop to watch. utah fights humiliation. he pops again. and again. quick cuts. on the next pop we pull back to reveal utah on his board, in a wave. he is surfing. for about three seconds. he flies off the deck, ass over teakettle. on the splash we start }
<B>__{a sequence of time cuts}
<A>__{tyler and utah straddle their boards outside the break. she nods as the set comes, mellow right tubes. utah digs in, arms pumping. he feels the bite as the wave picks up his board and starts down the wall. and endos.}
<B>__{cloudy platinum dawn...}
<A>__{tyler shouting at utah as he fights for balance. he flies off again. blinding bright sunrise. tyler next to utah in the lineup, straddling boards. she moves her hands like a fighter pilot explaining a dogfight maneuver. utah watches intently. utah, backlit in glorious slow motion, tries a little turn and feels his feet slip out. he slams down butt first on the board, flips over, feet sticking straight up out of a blast of diamond spray. tyler cringes, giving a look like it's hopeless. tyler and utah, at their cars, skinning out of their wetsuits. utah looks exhausted, downcast. she snaps her wet towel at his ass, cheering him up. malibu pier. rain. tyler jumps out of her porsche and sees utah sitting in his car. she goes to him, opens the door and starts pulling him out. come on you pussy. utah and tyler wait their turn in the lineup. rain pelts their faces. the waves are depressing inside mushers under a gray sky. utah starts to paddle. tyler shakes her head no. utah is committed to the i'face. tyler stifles a laugh.}

<P>__{(to the other surfers)}
<D>__{i'm not with him.}
<A>__{johnny gouges the lip, pops and begins the drop. suddenly, miraculously, he catches an edge and, still standing, is carried along the tiny wall. the wall begins to sag. utah shoots along the mush hooting and continues hooting madly as he thrashes all the way to shore. he turns and grins foolishly out to sea. tyler bursts out laughing.}
