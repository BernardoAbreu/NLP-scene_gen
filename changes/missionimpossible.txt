He SMACKS the suction cup down on the roof and pulls himself the rest of the way out. He pulls out a second suction cup and SMACKS it down on the smooth surface of the train. Now for the tough part.  Using the suction cups, PHELPS slowly pulls himself forward, a foot at a time, pulling and replanting the cups as he goes. He drags himself over the length of the final car, to the back of the train, where the rear engine slants off sharply, a window for the ENGINEER. Half kneeling on the roof, PHELPS pulls out the clip from his belt. He looks up, scanning the sky behind the train.  From out of the fog, a helicopter approaches. PHELPS turns and looks ahead, in the direction the train is going.  In the distance, he can see the chunnel approaching the tunnel under the English Channel.  His eyes widen.}

Without goggles or suction cups, he has to use his fingers to grab small holes on the roof. He is flipped over by the wind, ending up facing the other way.  Loses his grip and is blown backwards over the roof.}

The helicopter avoids the oncoming train too -- and PHELPS misses the skid. KRIEGER tips the front of the copter, trying to decapitate ETHAN with the rotor.  PHELPS jumps onto the skid, but the copter pitches so far forward the blade hits the top of the tunnel.  SPARKS and chunks of cement fly. KRIEGER levels the chopper quickly.  ETHAN uses the moment to leap from the train onto the other helicopter skid. PHELPS and ETHAN now hang on the skids, facing one another. Crouching on the skid, ETHAN digs in his pocket and pulls out -- -- a red and green piece of bubble gum. PHELPS sees it and SCREAMS at KRIEGER, who scrambles frantically for his gun.}

The helicopter whirls and BASHES into the tunnel, veers wildly, then pitches forward and down, smashing PHELPS under the skid and EXPLODING in a giant fireball.
