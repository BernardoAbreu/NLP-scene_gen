<A>__{jerry moving dawn the hallway, hears voices.}
<L>__{interior kitchen morning}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{because i'm worried that you're putting your faith in this guy who, because of the way things are going, may not have an emotional marble in his head.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{please, if i start talking }
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{guys are just different people when they're hanging onto the bottom rung.}
<B>__{on jerry}
<A>__{listening. pinned to the wall, listening to the kind of honesty an agent rarely hears.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{... so what am i, for taking the opportunity, laurel?}
<P>__{(more)}
<C>__{dorothy }
<D>__{maybe i am taking advantage. am i a bad person? all i know is that i found someone who was charming and popular and not so nice to me and he died. okay? so why should i let this guy go, when everything in my body says this one is the one.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{easy, hon, i was just looking for fun details }
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{oh, well, why didn't you say so? and oh, i don't know if you're interested in this detail, but i was just about to tell you that i love him. i love him, and i don't care what you think. i love him for the guy he wants to be, and i love him for the guy he almost is. i love him.}
<A>__{they look at each other. the cat is way, way out of the bag.}
<B>__{on jerry}
<A>__{rubbing his face.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{hi jerry!}
<A>__{dorothy leans into the hallway now, sees jerry standing there, well within earshot. as ray pounds down the hallway in his new over sized shirt, brought by jerry, dorothy begins to crumble. the lack of control in her life is overwhelming her.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{oh god.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{easy, easy }
<A>__{jerry enters the kitchen, stands near laurel.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i could pretend i didn't hear, but i won't, i heard everything.}
<P>__{(to laurel)}
<D>__{thank you for your honesty, as always.}
<C>__{laurel}
<P>__{(frozen polite)}
<D>__{coffee, jerry?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{oh, no thanks. we bottom feeders prefer cereal first }
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{let's have apple jacks!}
<A>__{apple jacks it is. dorothy, good morning, darling. he kisses her on the cheek, in full view of ray. dorothy, still embarrassed, not sure what is going on, reaches for cereal. jerry sits down for breakfast. they are an odd, but fairly complete looking family.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{what's going on, jerry?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{a lot. we got a big fax today... we need this commission, buddy.}
<A>__{the sisters look at each other. ray looks around, he feels happy, but there is something else in the room. he shrugs and continues to feel happy.}
