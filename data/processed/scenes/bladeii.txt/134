<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{the two of them}
<A>__{naked on the tatami mats upon which blade sleeps. skin beaded with sweat. breath steaming in the chill air. he's atop her, moving inside her with measured thrusts. nyssa's limbs are wrapped around him. she claws at the expanse of his back with her fingernails. her mouth is locked on blade's throat, then his is locked on hers. together they drink, leeching blood from one another.}
<B>__{pulling back again}
<A>__{nyssa clutching greedily at blade like she never wants to let go. her soul is gone transported to that place we drift to when the euphoria overtake us and we're somehow able to transcend the horror of our fleeting lives. finally, nyssa gasps, climaxing as she retracts her fangs from blade. her head rolls to the side as her pupil focused on nothing short of eternity dilate unnaturally large.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{blade and nyssa lie in each other's arms, awash in moonlight, blissfully dead to the world until }
<B>__{something makes blade stir}
<A>__{he sits up, listening. nyssa stirs beside him. she moves to speak but blade holds up a hand, silencing her. together, they slowly creep towards a nearby window where jared nomak's nightmare face is pressed up against the icy glass, staring back at them! nyssa gasps. blade draws back with a start. but in the time it takes to blink, nomak is gone. just then, we hear a noise. scud appears in a doorway, groggy.}
<C>__{scud}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{he was here. watching us.}
<C>__{scud}
<D>__{nomak?}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{he wants us to know he's hunting us now.}
<B>__{moments later}
<A>__{blade is at the computer workstation. he activates the footage of nomak he was viewing earlier. he fast forwards to a specific moment, then plays it back at normal speed.}
<C>__{blade }
<D>__{nomak said something to me before he disappeared the first time }
<A>__{blade points to the screen, saying the words as nomak silently mouths them.}
<C>__{blade }
<D>__{athelfiki singenia ex amato. at first i thought he might've been using one of the vampire dialects. but it turns out, it's greek. do you know what it means?}
<A>__{nyssa shakes her head.}
<C>__{blade }
<D>__{it means "bloodbrother."}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{whistler }
<D>__{well maybe i do.}
<A>__{blade spins, his mach pistol up and ready to fire. whistler sits on the opposite side of the room, watching them as he smokes.}
<C>__{whistler }
<P>__{(to scud)}
<D>__{your security's for shit, kid.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{where the hell have you been?}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{just out connecting a few dots.}
<A>__{whistler rises from his chair. he flicks his cigarette butt into the shadows and fixes blade with a heavy stares.}
<C>__{whistler }
<D>__{bangin' some vampire chick. kind of a faux pas in our line of work, wouldn't you say? hope you double bagged it, at least.}
<A>__{blade is still guarded, not yet ready to lower his mach.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{what's your problem, whistler?}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{why don't you ask your girlfriend?}
<A>__{blade looks to nyssa, but she seems equally perplexed.}
<C>__{whistler }
<D>__{i did some checking on that carter stevens character. that familiar of theirs who claimed he was with the nih? turns out he used to work for them, but he doesn't anymore.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{then who does he work for?}
<A>__{whistler gives nyssa a rueful stare, then tosses blade a research folder. on the cover is the same red, double helix logo we saw at damaskinos' facility.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{some biotech outfit called caliban industries. they've been lying to us since day one. this nomak fucker didn't evolve. he was designed.}
<A>__{nyssa look to blade, imploring.}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{i don't know what he's talking about.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{you expect us to believe that?}
<P>__{(to blade)}
<D>__{who you going to trust, blade? me or her?}
