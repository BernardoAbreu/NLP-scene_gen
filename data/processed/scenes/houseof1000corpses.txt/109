<D>__{right.}
<A>__{willis runs to the car, he gets about halfway there before he is hit in the back by a bullet. he stumbles and falls to his knees. he kneels silent, stunned. we hold on his face and watch as his life passes before him. a quick montage, we see the following images flash by: a. a father and daughter together in happier times. b. a child's birthday party. c. a baby crying. d. willis and his deceased wife. otis fires another shot. willis falls forward into the mud, dead. naish sees willis fall. before he can react a voice calls out from behind him.}

<C>__{otis}
<D>__{kneel.}
<A>__{naish kneels down. from a distance we see otis standing over naish, execution style. a white puff of smoke comes from otis's gun and a distant popping sound is heard. naish falls over on his side. the scene fades to blood red.}
