<L>__{interior nero's cell night}
<A>__{nero lies on the floor of his cell, semi conscious, looking like death. behind him the door opens. two klingon guards enter, backlit.}
<D>__{klingon guard #1 the day you've been waiting for is upon us, silent one. and look. no sign of salvation. no sign of change. just more pain.}
