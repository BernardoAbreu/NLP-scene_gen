<L>__{interior doctor's office afternoon}
<A>__{splooge! we see ultrasound goo being squirted onto juno's exposed pregnant belly. an ultrasound technician is using a doppler device to view the contents of her burgeoning bump. bren and leah ooh and ahh at the resulting image. the tech takes measurements and types them into her database.}
<C>__{ultrasound tech}
<D>__{that's the feet...}
<C>__{all three}
<D>__{oooh...}
<C>__{ultrasound tech}
<D>__{and there's a hand...}
<A>__{the monitor reveals the baby's head.}
<C>__{all three}
<P>__{(various)}
<D>__{check that out... no way...}
<C>__{bren}
<P>__{(dreamily)}
<D>__{would you look at that?}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{check out baby big head. that kid is scary!}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{hey, i'm a sacred vessel. all you've got in your belly is taco bell!}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{touche.}
<C>__{juno}
<P>__{(gazing at the monitor)}
<D>__{it is really weird looking. it's like it's not even real. i can't believe there are saps who actually cry at these things.}
<A>__{juno and leah look at bren, who is dabbing her eyes discreetly.}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{what? i'm not made of stone.}
<C>__{ultrasound tech}
<D>__{well, there we have it. would you like to know the sex?}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{aw, please junebug?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{no way. no, i definitely don't want to know.}
<C>__{ultrasound tech}
<D>__{planning to be surprised when you deliver?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i want mark and vanessa to be surprised, and if i know, i won't be able to keep myself from telling them and ruining the whole thing.}
<C>__{ultrasound tech}
<P>__{(condescending)}
<D>__{are mark and vanessa your friends at school?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{no, they're the people who are adopting the baby.}
<C>__{ultrasound tech}
<D>__{oh. well, thank goodness for that.}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{wait, what's that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{ultrasound tech}
<D>__{i just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here. it's obviously a poisonous environment for a baby to be raised in.}
<A>__{juno, leah and bren become immediately defensive.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{how do you know i'm so poisonous? like, what if the adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{or stage parents!}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{they could be utterly negligent. maybe they'll do a far shittier job of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would. have you considered that?}
<C>__{ultrasound tech}
<D>__{no... i guess not.}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{what is your job title, exactly?}
<C>__{ultrasound tech}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{i said, what is your job title, missy?}
<C>__{ultrasound tech}
<D>__{i'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{well i'm a nail technician, and i think we both ought to stick to what we know.}
<C>__{ultrasound tech}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{you think you're special because you get to play picture pages up there?}
<A>__{bren gestures to the ultrasound monitor.}
<C>__{bren}
<D>__{my five year old daughter could do that, and let me tell you, she is not the brightest bulb in the tanning bed. so why don't you go back to night school in manteno and learn a real trade!}
<A>__{the ultrasound tech exits in a huff.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{bren, you're a dick! i love it.}
