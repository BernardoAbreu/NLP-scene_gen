<C>__{norman}
<D>__{here, here.}
<A>__{everybody gets in their position by the bar. norman lays his left hand on the block of wood with his pinky sticking out. in his right hand is his zippo lighter, poised and ready to strike. chester hands ted the meat cleaver. ted takes it, raises it up above norman's finger, in position.}

<C>__{chester}
<D>__{okeydoke. norman, begin.}
<A>__{norman looks hard at the zippo in his hand. ted, holding the cleaver, stares focused on norman's pinky. norman readies himself. places his thumb on the wheel in the zippo. takes a breath. and strikes. it sparks, but doesn't light. without missing a beat, ted brings down the cleaver, slicing off norman's pinky. norman lets out a scream. ted, in one move, lays down the cleaver, scoops up the money and walks out the door.}
