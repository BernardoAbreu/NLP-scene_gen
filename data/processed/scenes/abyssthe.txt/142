<L>__{interior drill room corridor}
<A>__{bud comes pounding down the flooding corridor in time to see the water in the drill room swirl above the pressure window, obscuring the faces of the trapped men. he claws futility at the door. the motors and the fail safe latching mechanism are on the opposite side. through the pressure window he watches helplessly as they drown. we don't see what he sees, but we know what he sees. suddenly the bulkhead next to him gives way and a freezing torrent thunders in. bud is blown off his feet a hurled along the corridor. he scramble up somehow, splashing waist deep toward the opposite end of the corridor where another of the hydraulic doors is closing inexorably. he's not going to make it. he reaches it a moment too late to squeeze through. grabs the edge of the door and desperately tries to stop it from closing with the strength of this arms. it doesn't work. the steel door closes on the fingers of his left hand, pinning them in the doorframe. but something amazing happens. his wedding ring lodges between the door and frame, preventing his fingers from being crushed and the door from sealing and locking. it resists tons of pressure, denting but not collapsing. the freezing sea pours in until only his head is clear.}

<A>__{on the other side of the door, catfish and sonny come pounding up. they see his face at the tiny window and his hand jammed in the door. sonny wedges a crowbar in the narrow opening and starts to pry. catfish whips open his jackknife and slashes the hydraulic hoses on the door actuator. he is sprayed with red hydraulic fluid, machine blood. together they force open the door. bud is blown through in a torture of water. sonny is thrown back into some pipes. breaks his arm. together they somehow heave the door shut manually, cutting off the flow. catfish hammers the fail safe latch home with the crowbar. bud lies gasping and shivering... staring at the tiny band of metal that saved him.}
