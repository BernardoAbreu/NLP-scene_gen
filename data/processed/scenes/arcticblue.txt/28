<L>__{interior kenai's general store}
<A>__{a handwritten public notice next to a schedule of church meetings reads: "live each day so you can look every damn man in the eye and tell him to go to hell." there is a post office in the corner with some combination boxes and a wicketless window. the trappers come in. corbett sits in a chair and pulls his boots off. one of his wool socks is wet. he nods to the man sitting in the other chair, sam wilder. wilder is short and tough, with a full head of crewcut grey hair and weather ravaged face that makes him look older than his sixty years.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{hullo, sam. slow day?}
<C>__{wilder}
<P>__{(wary)}
<D>__{ben...boys. yeah, real slow, and i'd like to keep it that way.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(conciliatory)}
<D>__{just passing through.}
<A>__{a chubby inupiat (interior eskimo), wearing thick glasses, several heavy sweaters and battery heated socks, fusses behind the counter. he's earl kenai, owner of the hot springs spa and the general store. lemalle chews on a handful of bear jerky. kenai stares at lemalle until he begrudgingly pays for the jerky. corbett pulls on some sneakers and hands his boots to kenai.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(continuing; re boot)}
<D>__{needs patching.}
<C>__{kenai}
<D>__{twenty five dollar.}
<C>__{corbett}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{sure have learned to worship the white man's god.}
<A>__{kenai nods agreeably and holds his hand out. corbett pays him. meyerling comes in and posts some fliers on the corkboard.}
<C>__{meyerling}
<D>__{i hope i can count on you gentlemen to vote for the people's friend this november.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{share some of that oil company money in your pocket and you can.}
<A>__{meyerling smiles like a toad, then slaps another poster on the wall. lemalle throws his knife and it sticks in the poster between meyerling's spread fingers. meyerling jumps back and the trappers laugh. meyerling looks to wilder for support.}
<C>__{wilder}
<P>__{(to meyerling)}
<D>__{one flier comes loose and i shoot you for littering.}
<C>__{meyerling}
<P>__{(exiting; grudgeless)}
<D>__{have your fun... just remember the people's friend come election day.}
<C>__{wilder}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{oil company candidate running on that slogan makes about as much sense as a rat fucking a grapefruit.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{hard to work up an interest in politics, way we live. you're the first people we've seen in two weeks.}
<C>__{lemalle}
<P>__{(to kenai)}
<D>__{how about a quart of jack daniel's?}
<C>__{kenai}
<D>__{how about it is right. back in the primary this town was voted dry.}
<C>__{lemalle}
<P>__{(to corbett)}
<D>__{aw, shit. let's go. leave a note for viking bob, tell him to meet us in cache.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{relax. one more day without drink won't kill you. right, sam?}
<C>__{wilder}
<D>__{i'm living proof of that sad fact.}
<C>__{corbett}
<D>__{can we buy the marshal some dinner?}
<C>__{wilder}
<D>__{no, i better stay at my post. even without the hootch riling 'em up, you know how mean spirited folks get when they smell winter coming.}
