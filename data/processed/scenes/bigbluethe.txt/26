<L>__{exterior train station day}
<A>__{the train pulls in, slowly pushing piles of snow in front of it and finally stops in front of an old shack which serves as the station. a man, frank, bundled in a parka, comes out of a snowmobile parked by the station, and walks up to the train. johana steps down, carrying her suitcase and drops two feet in the snow as she comes off the last step. frank walks over and leans down towards her.}
