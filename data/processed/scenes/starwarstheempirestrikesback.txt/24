<L>__{interior rebel base medical center recovery room}
<A>__{luke sits up in a recovery room bed, weak but smiling. his face shows terrible wounds from the wampa's attack. threepio and artoo enter the room.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{master luke, sir, it's so good to see you fully functional again.}
<A>__{artoo beeps his good wishes.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{artoo expresses his relief, also.}
<A>__{han and chewie make their entrance. the wookiee growls a greeting.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{how are you feeling, kid? you don't look so bad to me. in fact, you look strong enough to pull the ears off a gundark.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{thanks to you.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{that's two you owe me, junior.}
<A>__{han turns as leia enters the room. he looks at her with a big, devilish grin.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{well your worship, looks like you managed to keep me around for a little while longer.}
<C>__{leia}
<P>__{(haughtily)}
<D>__{i had nothing to do with it. general rieekan thinks it's dangerous for any ships to leave the system until we've activated the energy shield.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{that's a good story. i think you just can't bear to let a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{i don't know where you get your delusions, laser brain.}
<A>__{chewie is amused; he laughs in his manner. han, enjoying himself, regards chewie good humoredly.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{laugh it up, fuzzball. but you didn't see us alone in the south passage.}
<A>__{luke sparks to this; he looks at leia.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{she expressed her true feelings for me.}
<A>__{leia is flushed, eyes darting between luke and han.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{my...! why, you stuck up,... half witted... scruffy looking ...nerf herder!}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{who's scruffy looking?}
<P>__{(to luke)}
<D>__{i must have hit pretty close to the mark to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?}
<A>__{leia looks vulnerable for a moment, then the mask falls again, and she focuses on luke.}
<C>__{leia}
<D>__{why, i guess you don't know everything about women yet?}
<A>__{with that she leans over and kisses luke on the lips. then she turns on her heel and walks out, leaving everyone in the room slightly dumbstruck. with some smugness, luke puts his hands behind his head and grins. suddenly, in the distance, the muffled sound of an alarm is heard.}
<C>__{announcer}
<P>__{(over loudspeaker)}
<D>__{headquarters personnel, report to command center.}
<A>__{the voice repeats the order and han, chewie, artoo, and threepio hurry out of the room, bidding farewell to luke.}
<C>__{han}
<D>__{take it easy.}
<C>__{threepio}
<D>__{excuse us, please.}
