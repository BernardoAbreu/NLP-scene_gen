<L>__{interior chapel evening}
<A>__{begins to slowly pan back up the length of an exquisite gown. we can tell from the organ, the nearby thrum of expectant voices, that we are nearing the moment. we reach... ... kimmy's hand. firmly clasping walter's. keep panning, the bodice, the lace, her throat, and finally, we are close on... ... the face of the bride. now we understand the word radiant. we also understand scared senseless. our perfect, unflappable kimmy is in a trance of emotional overload where bliss and panic seamlessly blend. the organ's noddling stops. kimmy's eyes alerted, like a small animal bearing a predator approach her thicket. suddenly, the chord. the wedding march from wagner's lohengrin. here. comes. the bride. and we snap to... full angle... kim and walter. this is it.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{left foot.}
<A>__{reverse angle... kim's pov, the chapel, every pew packed, every neck craning this way, the white satin carpet down the endless aisle to where... michael waits. also in a zone of pseudo consciousness. from which he attempts a smile. not comforting. kim's pov whip pan the groomsmen, the twins, locking focus on julianne, standing strong and beautiful, a glow of her own in the daffodil dress. she sends her little sister a wink across the trackless miles of aisle. you can do this, kid. so... ... kimmy does. on her father's arm, she walks the gauntlet of the world's intrusive admiration. one step at a time. the most beautiful she will ever be. she is dazzling the crowd and managing to not throw up at the same time. and she's there. at his side. she glances back to her maid of honor, just to make sure she's not working without a net. so julianne... ... crosses her eyes. which lets the kid smile and finally take a breath. have a little fun, huh? kim nods, got it, turns to... the minister. who stands before them with a calming presence. thank god someone has done this before. the crowd has hushed. the minister's eyes are only for two. his words are for all...}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{michael and kimmy wrote these words. she asked me to confide, mostly michael.}
<A>__{a ripple of laughter. gentle and fine. they are setting in.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{so he gets to say them.}
<A>__{a surprise. a pleasant one. the crowd adjust in its seats. as michael begins...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{why do people get married anymore?}
<A>__{and on these words. we snap to julianne. share her interest in the bluntness, the simplicity, the unorthodoxy of this beginning.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{why not live together amicably, with no sense of obligation beyond the moment?}
<A>__{her eyes. she's listening.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{as long as the sex is good. as long as no one more interesting has wandered into view. as long as the thousand conflicts of two individual wills remain comfortably compromised.}
<A>__{panning now. other faces. isabelle. proud to the bone.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{and when one feels the urge to move on, to explore the new. no guilt, no disgrace, no promise broken.}
<A>__{walter. his eyes damp. against our expectation.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{no agony of having dishonored a time. when our hearts. and the world were different.}
<A>__{joe nods, as he hears...}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{marriage is a lot to put up with.}
<A>__{julianne once more. no breath. rapt.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{the answer must be. that there is some need basic to the human heart. that<u< embracing... the obligation of commitment... fulfills.}
<A>__{her eyes have clouded. as if michael is talking to her.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{some need to belong to one another in a way which rages against the notion... that all is impermanent. against the notion of mortality.}
<A>__{and suddenly, all the feeling rises in her throat.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{our love is bigger. and longer. than life itself.}
<A>__{and the tears come. they come freely, unhidden, unnoticed. as if they were needed. michael now. looking at his bride.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{that's what we want. and marriage. is what we do about it.}
<A>__{kimmy smiles at him. with love bigger than life itself.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{we are fools in this. thank god almighty.}
<A>__{he is done. there is a silence.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{boy, that was good!}
<A>__{people laugh. the minister holds up a sheet of paper. for the crowd to see. mostly paragraphs crossed out in red ink.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{michael and kim also edited what they want me to say...}
<A>__{more laughter.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{the idea was, we're only marrying once. we have to remember it forever. let's keep to the good stuff.}
<P>__{(squints at the sheet)}
<D>__{you may kiss the bride.}
<A>__{bigger laughter. the minister waves this off, his little joke. turns to the best man, pantomimes the ring. as the hammered gold circle is handed to michael, julianne absently scratches her still swollen finger. mandy taps julianne on the arm, and produces... ... a matching ring. take it! gives it to her. so julianne steps forward. places the second ring into kimmy's waiting hand. their eyes meet, and hold throughout...}
<C>__{minister }
<D>__{if anyone here can show just cause why this man and woman should not be married, speak now. or forever hold your peace.}
<A>__{julianne clears her throat. kimmy's heart flutters. in the silence... julianne's wonderful smile. just kidding. michael reaches for kim's hand, turns her gently to him. places his ring on her finger. holds her hands.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{kimberly. i promise to love. and respect and comfort you. to hear your voice and your heart. until we are parted by death.}
<A>__{she swallows. smiles a fleeting, beautiful smile. fumbles slightly, putting the ring on his finger.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{michael. i promise to love and respect and comfort you. to hear your voice and your heart. until we are parted by death.}
<A>__{staring in each other's eyes. a moment so fragile, the minister waits an extra beat.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{for the record, you each agree to marry the other?}
<C>__{kimmy}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{i do!}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i do.}
<A>__{the minister joins their right hands.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{we haven't said much about god this evening, i know. but he is here. and he is happy. to bless his wonderful children.}
<A>__{close now on julianne. for the inevitable moment.}
<C>__{minister }
<D>__{in that michael and kimberly have given themselves to each other by solemn vows, and the exchanging of rings...}
<A>__{unnoticed by the world. her eyes are close.}
<C>__{minister }
<D>__{i pronounce them husband and wife. those whom god has joined together, let no one put asunder.}
<A>__{the eyes open. wet, brave, ready for...}
<C>__{minister }
<D>__{now. kiss the bride.}
<A>__{julianne watching. as michael does.}
