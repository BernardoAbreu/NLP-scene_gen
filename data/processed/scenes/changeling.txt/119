<L>__{exterior northcott ranch chicken coop night}
<A>__{the boy, crying, is tossed into the chicken coop. there are two other boys there, also crying and screaming.}
<C>__{sanford }
<D>__{some days he'd do 'em right off. other days, he'd wait, pick up a few more, keep 'em in the coop until he had like four or five, 'cause }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{ 'cause he liked to hear 'em scream all at once. like they were some kinda chorus. and then....}
<B>__{quick images}
<A>__{gordon, eyes insane with blood lust, stumbles toward the coop.}
<C>__{sanford }
<D>__{...and then....}
<A>__{the kids, screaming. sanford looking on, afraid to move, the single overhead light in the coop swinging wildly. gordon grabbing an ax. raising it. on sanford's eyes, terrified. the ax begins to fall in slow motion and }
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{ as the long ash at the end of ybarra's cigarette, tumbles to the floor in slow motion, end over end, shattering when it hits the floor and bringing us back to full speed.}
<C>__{sanford}
<D>__{sometimes...sometimes he'd leave one or two of 'em alive...barely anyway...and tell me...finish 'em. finish 'em...or i will finish you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and i did...i did...oh god...oh, sweet jesus...i killed 'em...i killed 'em...i killed 'em....}
<A>__{then: silence, except for sanford's sobbing. ybarra realizes he hasn't been breathing. he tries to find his voice. changeling a true story}
<C>__{ybarra}
<D>__{these...uhm...these kids...do you think...if you saw them again, do you think you'd recognize them?}
<P>__{(sanford nods)}
<D>__{just a second.}
<A>__{he goes to his coat and pulls out a batch of photos of missing kids bound with a rubber band. hands it to sanford.}
<C>__{ybarra}
<D>__{i haven't updated these in a while, but still, it should be....}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{just go through...and if you see any faces you recognize, put it on the table.}
<A>__{sanford takes the photos. starts going through them. a photo, a face, goes down on the table. then another. a third. with each photo slapped down the slap gets louder, booming at us. another photo. another. row after row. he's crying, sobbing, but still putting down photos. then he slams down the last one and half falls, half stumbles out of his chair, sobbing...goes to the corner of the room and slides down the wall until he's sitting in a fetal position, hands covering his face. sobbing uncontrollably. numb, ybarra goes to the table, picks up a photo. looks at it. turns it over to the name, then picks up another. then a third. when he picks up the fourth photo and turns it over, he stops, staring at it.}
<C>__{ybarra}
<D>__{...shit....}
<A>__{the name on the back of the photo is walter collins.}
<C>__{jones }
<D>__{he's lying.}
