<L>__{interior backstage of palace theatre}
<A>__{the movie will soon by finished and the comedian who opens the stage show is ready and made up in the wings. he sits with his agent, (al evans) a small, worried, bespectacled man, who waves an unlighted cigar as big as himself. they converse in loud whispers, talking against the muffled and echoing sound of the film sound track, silhouetted against the ghostly, distorted images on the big screen seen at a weird angle behind them.}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{i didn't waste words, herbie, take my word. i says, "look, figo, i'm not selling you a dozen eggs, i'm selling you herbie temple", i says, so don't gimme your lip!}
<A>__{the comedian, herbie temple, looks up. sidney comes through a fire proof door which separates the stage from the corridors to dressing room. in background two chorus girls in costume are squeezed into a telephone booth. sidney joins the comedian and the agent; he smiles to the comedian, while he addresses the agent.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{hiya, al!}
<A>__{the agent looks from sidney to temple, surprised and displeased.}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{since when did you two get acquainted?}
<A>__{sidney has clearly never met evans; blandly he chooses to regard the agent's remark as an introduction; he offers his hand with generous amiability.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{how do you do, mr. temple...}
<A>__{the comic accepts the hand doubtfully.}
<C>__{evans}
<P>__{(uncertain)}
<D>__{delighted.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i'm sidney falco.}
<C>__{temple}
<P>__{(still dubious)}
<D>__{yeah, delighted...}
<A>__{evans stands up, warns the comic.}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{watch this guy, herbie, he's a press agent.}
<A>__{temple's smile congeals.}
<C>__{temple}
<D>__{you watch him, al, i s...s...stutter!}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(in no way discouraged)}
<D>__{temple, i caught your act the other night and }
<C>__{temple}
<D>__{did you now? on which bounce?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{ and i just had to drop by and tell you how great i thought you were.}
<C>__{temple}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{cheers. what time is it, al?}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{you got ten minutes.}
<P>__{(to sidney)}
<D>__{hope you don't mind, falco: we're busy and if }
<A>__{sidney stands up.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{no, i don't mind. i'm busy too.}
<C>__{temple}
<P>__{(scowling)}
<D>__{good! we're all off to utica, so excuse me, mr. frannis on the portisan.}
<A>__{sidney moves toward the doorway onto the corridor. the chorus girls have now vacated the phone booth.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{but can i ask one impertinent question here? with no criticism intended, because i know, al, you earn your ten percent, how come you let a sock act like herbie temple tip toe through town without a publicity build...?}
<A>__{smiling wise, evans shakes his head.}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{we're not buying it, falco no fish today.}
<A>__{sidney presses, as if annoyed.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i'm not selling. i'm just curious, that's all.}
<A>__{temple turns away from sidney, leaving him to evans.}
<C>__{temple}
<D>__{answer the man, al, if he asks you a question. quick, before he thinks up another!}
<A>__{evans moves to sidney, trying to shepherd him out the way he came.}
<C>__{evans}
<D>__{mr. temple doesn't believe in press agents does that answer you something?}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{evans makes the mistake of laying a hand on sidney's elbow. sidney doesn't like people touching him. he reacts in anger, as we have seen before fixes a burning eye on evans.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{take your hand off, lump!}
<P>__{(more politely, to temple)}
<D>__{no one believes in press agents, temple, when they make claims they can't perform. i got nothing to sell i didn't come here to peddle but if i tell a client that hunsecker will give him space, it's not just talk!}
<A>__{sidney stops briskly up the stairs into the corridor. evans, angry, is stalled for a moment of delay action by mention of the magic name of hunsecker.}
<C>__{evans}
<P>__{(after hesitation)}
<D>__{listen, you bull artist !}
<C>__{temple}
<D>__{let him go, al...}
<B>__{sidney}
<A>__{but sidney has already stepped to the phone booth and is dialing.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(to phone)}
<D>__{hello? mary, let me speak to j.j., please...it's sidney falco...}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{shooting past sidney in foreground onto temple and evans beyond, they watch him, open mouthed. sidney notes their reaction.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(to phone)}
<D>__{tell him it's important...}
