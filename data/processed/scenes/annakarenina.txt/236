<A>__{anna, with some dainty shopping by her, is taking tea in a genteel cafe. her eye is caught by a mother and son at another table. the boy is a "serozha." anna misses her son acutely in that moment. then dolly enters the tea shop. anna's heart lifts for a moment and she is about to greet her, but then realises that dolly is one of a trio of "society ladies," and anna lowers her head. when she sneaks a look, she catches one of the ladies whispering to the others. anna realises that she has been recognised by a stranger, and is notorious. she "hides" in her purse, finding money to leave on the table so that she can escape. a sound makes her look up and she sees that dolly has sat down opposite her.}
