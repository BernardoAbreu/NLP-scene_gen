<A>__{the last of the opening images. rudy's motionless santa figure, upside down on the snowy incline, bits of his suit still aflame. he opens his eyes.}
<B>__{angle on snowy road}
<A>__{rudy staggers to his feet. battered and dazed. looks at gabriel's body. then looks to the trailer. inside, nick is still alive, bones broken from the waist down. he's mumbling madly, staring at the ceiling:}

<D>__{...rudy... help me... rudy...}
<A>__{rudy climbs the tire ramp. and pulls the trailer gate shut. he climbs into the rig's cab. starts the engine. puts the truck in reverse, taps the accelerator and hops out.}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{...rudy! rudy! help me!!!}
<A>__{the truck rolls backwards. and into the ravine. rudy listens to its tumbling sounds all the way to the bottom. he then looks up the road one way. then the other. and notices the two money sacks sitting in the snow. he stares at them. a long time.}
