<A>__{the spaniards, columbus, mendez, fernando... all running hard to the boat. arrows whistle around them as they leap into the canoes, nearly capsizing them, launching them into the current. some cannibals still follow them along the riverbank. but the canoes are faster, and soon, they are left behind.}

<A>__{fernando is crouched on the poop deck, wrapped in a blanket. he seems in a state of shock: he is pale and shaking. as columbus goes and sits near his son, he hands him a flask of alcohol.}
<C>__{columbus}
<P>__{(kindly)}
<D>__{take it. come on. drink.}
<A>__{as columbus insists, brandishing the flask, fernando notices that his hands are shaking too. his father's forehead is dripping with sweat. fernando drinks a gulp and grimaces. he drinks again and hands the flask back to his father, who does the same. fernando notices dried blood on his father's fingers. columbus immediately hides his hand and stands.}

<A>__{then, with sudden anger.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{your brother was right. i should have never taken you with me. i will never forgive myself. never!}
<A>__{he walks a few steps, lurches, and has to lean against the rail. he raises his hand to his eyes, grimacing in pain, as if they were burning. fernando scrambles to his feet and rushes to him. columbus' eyes are already fixed somewhere fever is eating him up.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{will you ever forgive me?}
<A>__{fernando turns around for help.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{captain mendez!}
