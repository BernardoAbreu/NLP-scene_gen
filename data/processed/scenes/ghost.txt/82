<L>__{interior subway train night}
<A>__{sam begins quickly casing the aisles, looking for something. it is not there. another train can be seen speeding past the window. sam takes a running leap and jumps onto it, passing through the walls.}

<A>__{angle sam disappointed. suddenly, an express train passes alongside his local. sam sticks his face inside it. suddenly, he smiles and rushes onto it.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{sam does not have to stand there long. within seconds, the terrifying ghost he had seen before comes charging at him. we notice him more clearly now. he is wearing a dark blue pea coat. there is a grizzled look about him. he has stained teeth and seems perpetually unshaven.}
<C>__{ghost}
<D>__{get off my train!}
<A>__{this time sam does not back away. he holds his ground. the ghost lets fire every trick in his arsenal. posters come flying off the walls. a bag of groceries topples from a woman's arms, an old man's cane flies across the aisle, a boy's mets cap flips off his head. people on the train move quickly to other cars. unable to frighten him, the ghost kicks sam in the stomach. sam recoils, feeling it, but gets back up again. he is angry now. he begins raging at the other ghost. the ghost is shocked.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{teach me how you do that! i want to learn! i'm not leaving til you teach me!}
<A>__{the ghost, exhausted, looks up at him and smiles with appreciation.}
<C>__{ghost}
<D>__{you stubborn asshole.}
<A>__{sam nods in agreement.}
