<L>__{exterior crossroads day}
<A>__{converging. the postman with his forty five coming from the west. drew, chubby, and a ragtag thirty coming from the north. and from the south, ponytail leading a contingent of fifty! the forces converge and continue east.}
<L>__{exterior holnist camp day}
<A>__{the army has gathered. three hundred strong. bethlehem and getty stand outside the command tent, listening to a winded, frightened gibbs. we follow bethlehem's eyes over gibbs' shoulders to the horizon, where he sees: the postman and his army of two hundred carriers cresting a distant rise.}
<C>__{gibbs }
<D>__{... we were outnumbered, sir.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{how many?}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{a least a hundred. with guns.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<P>__{(feigning shock)}
<D>__{with guns? are you sure?}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{yes, sir...}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{looks more like two hundred to me...}
<A>__{he steps away to get a better vantage point of the approaching army. he reaches out getty hands him a pair of binoculars.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<P>__{(donning a pair of leather gloves)}
<D>__{only thing worse than a coward is one who can't count. lieutenant, do yourself a favor. die well in this battle. in my army a deserter's life is a brief and unpleasant one.}
<A>__{bethlehem watches the postman through the binoculars a hint of a smile on his face.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{at last, someone with courage enough to bring the fight to me.}
<A>__{a holnist soldier stands by with bethlehem's horse. the general mounts the model of military calm and precision. getty reins up beside him.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{reckoning, gentlemen. this is the day i've dreamed of.}
