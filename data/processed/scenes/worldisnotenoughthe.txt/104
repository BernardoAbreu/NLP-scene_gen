<D>__{let me introduce you to a former colleague of mine at the kgb. dmitri palov, you may know him as...the boa.}
<A>__{the boa is completely bald, muscular; huge, deadly hands.}

<A>__{zukovsky shakes his head. sighs.}
<C>__{zukovsky}
<D>__{the russian army, they spend millions on flying skis, but they cannot afford to pay the soldiers. the men, they do what they have to do to feed their families. in this country, for the right price and a pack of cigarettes, you can get anything you want.}

<D>__{that too. everyone does what they can to survive.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{how high up does this...arms dealing go?}
<C>__{zukovsky}
<D>__{bond. if someone wants you dead, it is renard. our government has nothing to gain by killing you.}

<D>__{poor bond. the cold war is over. what have you got left? economic espionage. murder in the boardroom. so dull.}
<A>__{bond's eyes catch something, someone entering the casino. his pov: elektra...more vibrant than we have ever seen her, living up to her name. she is impossibly glamorous in a sparkling dress that fits like second skin. her hair is full and tumbling, her eyes are fiery and wild.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{oh, you'd be surprised.}
<A>__{bond starts toward her, but she tosses her head, defiant, and turns away, making her way to the roulette tables. bond follows her across the casino. they are like two cats, moving through this neon jungle, their energy dangerous and sexy, all eyes on them. he takes note as she passes...minimum $100, then $500, $1000... she finally stops at the 'no limit' table. crowded with the nastiest and richest of the high rollers, armenians, turks, south americans, a computer nerd american and a russian industrialist's wife, heavy with jewelry and drink. zukovsky is suddenly there, pulling out a seat for her in the center.}
<C>__{zukovsky}
<D>__{we've kept your father's chair free.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{and his account?}
<C>__{zukovsky}

<A>__{she points to a show girl in a feather headdress and pasties.}
<C>__{bond}

<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{you had your chance, james. now i'm looking for a bigger thrill.}
<A>__{she pushes half her chips back onto the table, letting them stand on her bet. the whole table exhales. then, it starts: bets are placed, gamblers energized by her arrival. bond scans the room, vigilant, nervous... his p.o.v. he zeroes in on davidov, sidling off, away from the table, trying to look nonchalant, his eyes shifting this way and that...he looks suspicious as hell. bond watches, his blood running, and then... davidov slips into the hostess bar. a hooker is soon wrapping herself around him. after a few words, she leads him off toward the back. bond returns to the game, shaking his head. he watches as}
