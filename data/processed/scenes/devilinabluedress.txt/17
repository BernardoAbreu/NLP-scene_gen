<L>__{interior maintenance office}
<A>__{easy follows albright inside and the big man goes behind a big wooden desk and puts his bone colored shoes up next to a half full bottle of wild turkey. on the other end of the desk a small radio scratches out the glen gray orchestra's "gotta be this or that." there is a paper calendar hanging on the wall behind him with a picture of a basket of blackberries, but other than that the room is bare.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{have a seat, mr. rawlins.}
<A>__{easy takes a seat in a chair in front of the desk and tries not to stare at the tan leather shoulder holster under albright's arm with the muzzle of the pistol almost reaching his belt.}
<C>__{easy}
<P>__{(gesturing back)}
<D>__{your friends, hunh?}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{like you, easy. i need a little help? i give 'em a call... drink?}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{albright pulls another glass from the desk drawer and pours a fresh one for easy and fresher one for himself.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{one thing i like about working for myself... i always have a bottle on the table... you wanna drink with me? fine. you don't? door's right behind you... joppy tells me you're a war hero... said you went in with patton.}
<A>__{easy nods, proud but polite, and albright pushes him a glass of whiskey.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{so, you want the job?}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{depends on what kind of job. i don't want to get mixed up in nothing.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{walk out the door in the morning, easy, and you're mixed up in something. only thing that matters is if you're mixed up to the top or not.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{i mean i don't wanna get mixed up with the law...}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{neither one of us wants to get mixed up in that. that's just rich people trying to keep me and you in our place.}
<A>__{he laughs and takes a healthy swig and easy takes a drink too.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{i'm looking for somebody for a friend.}
<A>__{he pushes a newspaper across the desk to easy and easy holds it up.}
<B>__{newspaper}
<A>__{it's the front page with the photograph of the wealthy todd carter and his beautiful bride to be... despite her smile, there's a sadness in the eyes.}
<C>__{albright }
<D>__{daphne monet... fiancee of todd carter, one of the richest men in town... been gone for two weeks...}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{she leave him?}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{evidently... you know how it is with women, easy... happens to the best of us...}
<A>__{he rears back in his chair as if expecting a sign of recognition.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{i ain't never heard of her before. i wouldn't know how to find a woman like that.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{that's a shame.}
<A>__{he laughs a conspiratorial, lecher's laugh and easy allows a smile.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{see, daphne has a predilection for the company of negroes. she likes jazz and pigs feet and dark meat, know what i mean.}
<A>__{the insult takes easy off guard but he should've known.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{so you think she might be down in watts.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{i'm sure of it. but i can't go looking for her myself because i'm not of the right persuasion, so to speak. i've been asking joppy for over a week, but all he could do was introduce me to you.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{what do you want me to do?}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{just get a location on her. mr. carter wants to make up with her...}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{that's all.}
<C>__{albright}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{that's all.}
<A>__{he pulls out a brown secretary type wallet and counts out 10 ten dollar bills into a neat stack next to the whiskey.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{one hundred dollars, and i pay in advance.}
<A>__{easy eyes the money. all he has to do is pick it up.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{i just have to tell you where she is?}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{that's right. and keep it, you know, confidential...}
<A>__{he freshens easy's drink and easy eyes the money some more.}
<C>__{albright}
<D>__{joppy tells me you used to frequent an illegal club down on eighty ninth and central. somebody saw daphne there a few nights ago. you could start tonight.}
<A>__{easy takes a drink and looks again at the money.}
