<L>__{interior back room of hardware store (night)}
<A>__{lila is sitting close by the phone, and looks as if she hasn't moved from it in the last hour. sam is pacing, occasionally stopping at the window, glancing out, pacing again. the ash tray close to lila is filled. there is a thick atmosphere of smoke, tension and weariness in the small, otherwise cozy room.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(at window, quietly)}
<D>__{sometimes saturday night has a lonely sound. ever notice, lila?}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(unable to keep up small talk)}
<D>__{sam. he said an hour. or less.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it's been three.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{are we just going to go on sitting here?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(suddenly cheerful)}
<D>__{he'll be back. let's sit still and hang on, okay?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{you have an awfully nice habit, sam.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{hundreds! which one is your pet?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{whenever i start contemplating the panic button, your back straightens up and your eyes get that god looks out for everybody look and... i feel better.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i feel better when you feel better.}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(a pause then she rises)}
<D>__{where's the old highway?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you want to run out there, bust in on arbogast and the sick old lady, shake her up and maybe spoil everything arbogast's been building for the last three hours.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{that wouldn't be a wise thing to do.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{patience doesn't run in our family. sam, i'm going out there!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{arbogast said...}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{an hour! or less!}
<A>__{sam stares at her, frowns in concern over her very real anxiety, goes to the phone, dials operator.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{got the number of the motel out on the old highway? bates, i think.}
<P>__{(waits)}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{sam! why call when we can go?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{and maybe pass arbogast on the road?}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{he presses down the receiver, releases it, dials bates' motel. the faint other end ringing tones can be heard, repeatedly, annoyingly. he waits.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(to lila)}
<D>__{probably on his way back right now.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{sam, i'm going.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(hangs up and picks up his jacket)}
<D>__{you'll never find it.}
<A>__{he starts for the door. lila follows after him into the store.}
