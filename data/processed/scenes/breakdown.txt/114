<A>__{earl sneers. jeff is about to slug him again when he notices the two truck parked across the road, the driver staring out. jeff swears and wrestles earl into the passenger seat. he seizes the roll of duct tape and binds earl's wrists, then passes the tape under his legs so earl is effectively hog tied. he then slams earl back in the seat, circles his neck twice with tape and wraps the free end around the base of the passenger side headrest. earl begins to gasp for air. the tow truck driver gets out and approaches.}
