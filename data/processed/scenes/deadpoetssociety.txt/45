<L>__{interior todd's room day}
<A>__{todd is on his bed trying to write a poem. the door opens and todd turns his writing pad over. neil enters the room laughing. he crouches down next to todd's bed and plunks a sheet of paper in todd's lap.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{i found it.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{you found what?}

<D>__{right. they're putting it on at henley hall. open tryouts. open tryouts!}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{yes, so?}
<A>__{neil pounds on the bed and then pulls a blanket off his bed, wearing it like a cloak.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{so, i'm gonna act. yes, yes! i'm gonna be an actor! ever since i can remember, i've wanted to try this. i even tried to go to summer stock auditions last year, but, of course, my father wouldn't let me. for the first time in my whole life i know what i wanna do.}
<A>__{neil grabs a handful of papers off todd's bed and tosses them into the air.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{and for the first time i'm gonna do it whether my father wants me to or not! carpe diem!}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{neil, neil, hold on a minute. how are you gonna be in a play if your father won't let you?}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{first i gotta get the part, then i can worry about that.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{yeah, but won't he kill you if he finds out you went to an audition and didn't even tell him?}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{no, no, no, no. as far as i'm concerned, he won't have to know about any of this.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{well, that's impossible.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{bullshit! nothing's impossible.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{well, why don't you just call him and ask him? and m maybe he'll say yes.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{that's a laugh!}
<A>__{neil tosses the blanket back onto his bed.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{if i don't ask him, at least i won't be disobeying him.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{yeah, but if he said }
<C>__{neil}
<P>__{(shouting angrily)}
<D>__{jesus, todd! whose side are you on?}
<A>__{todd says nothing. neil looks at him for a moment and then takes the flyer back from todd. he walks over to the window, his excitement gone.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{i mean, i haven't even gotten the part yet. can't i even enjoy the idea for a little while?}
<A>__{once again, todd says nothing. after a moment, neil sits on the heater and todd returns to his poem.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{you're coming to the meeting this afternoon?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{i don't know. maybe.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{nothing mr. keating has to say means shit to you, does it, todd?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{w what is that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{you're in the club! being in the club means being stirred up by things. you look about as stirred up as a cesspool.}
<A>__{neil gets up from the window and stands over todd.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{so you want me out?}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{no! i want you in, but being in means you gotta do something. not just say you're in.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{well, listen, neil. i i appreciate this concern, but i i'm not like you. all right? you, you, you say thing and people listen. i'm, i'm not like that.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{don't you think you could be?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{no! i i, i don't know, but that's not the pointerior the, the, the point is that there's nothing you can do about it, so you can just butt out. i can take care of myself just fine. all right?}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{what do you mean, "no"?}
<A>__{a smile comes to neil's face.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{neil grabs todd's notebook of poetry and runs across the room with it. todd leaps up after him.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{give me neil. neil, give that back.}
<A>__{the two begin racing in circles around the room, jumping from bed to bed as todd tries to grab his poem back.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{"we are dreaming of a " poetry! i'm being chased by walt whitman! okay, okay.}
<A>__{neil drops the notebook. cameron walks into the room.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{what are you guys doing? i'm sure you see this chemistry }
<A>__{cameron tries to hold up his book and neil snatches it from his hands and suddenly all three of them are racing around the room.}
<C>__{cameron}

<A>__{charlie enters the room and begins waving his hands.}

<A>__{neil tosses cameron's book to charlie.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{let me have my book, i need my }
<A>__{the four boys continue racing around the cramped quarters, tossing cameron's book back and forth. neil picks up a recorder and begins blowing erratic notes on it while charlie starts pounding on a set of bongo drums. outside the room a crowd of boys watch.}
