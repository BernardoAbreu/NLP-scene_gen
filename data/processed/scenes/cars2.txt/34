<P>__{(more)}
<D>__{brent mustangburger (v.o.) (cont'd) second, the course itself, and it's like nothing we've ever seen. david, how exactly does this competition work?}
<C>__{david hobbscap }
<D>__{well, brent, all three of these street courses are classic round the house racetracks.}
<A>__{outlines of three race courses are shown. they're labeled japan, italy and england, and are different in shape and size.}
<C>__{david hobbscap }

<D>__{and with a series of technical turns throughout }
<A>__{more shots of the course, now highlighting the tech turns.}
<C>__{david hobbscap }
<D>__{gt and touring cars like spain's miguel camino should make up some ground but i doubt it'll be enough to stop francesco from absolutely running away with it.}
<C>__{darrell cartrip }
<D>__{woah, now just hold your horsepower. you're forgetting the most important factor here. that early dirt track section of the course! the dirt is supposed to be the great equalizer in this race.}
<A>__{graphics of the courses now isolate a stretch after the first couple turns, label it "dirt sections."}
<C>__{brent mustangburger }
<D>__{french rally car raoul caroule is counting on a big boost headed through there.}
<C>__{darrell cartrip }
<D>__{and don't forget lightning mcqueen! his mentor, the hudson hornet, was one of the greatest dirt track racers of all time. in my opinion, mcqueen is the best all around racer in this competition.}
<B>__{back in the studio}
<C>__{david hobbscap}
<D>__{really, darrell, i think you need to clean your windshield. you're clearly not seeing this for what it is: francesco's race to lose.}
