<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{rob pushes through the rush hour raincoats, seeming to be the only one going his way.}
<L>__{interior rob's apartment night}
<A>__{rob is soaking, slumped in his chair, his headphones on and the stereo lit up behind him. he talks a little loud, due to the headphones.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{tonight we're gonna figure out the five best angry songs about women. let's go...}
<A>__{he holds up a stack of records and cds.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{you kind of have to start with elvis costello, but where? "motel matches?" "i want you?" "i hope you're happy now?" "green shirt?" his records should be sealed in cases that say "in case of vicious betrayal, smash glass." "where did you sleep last night," sure, but by robert johnson or by nirvana? maybe a liz phair track. there are a couple to get angry at instead of being angry with. some devil's advocate stuff. the silver jews could be good when you're ready to start putting it all behind you... but i think we're getting ahead of ourselves there. ah. dylan. bob fucking dylan. now bob dylan would the phone rings. he pulls off his headphones and picks it up but says nothing.}
<C>__{laura }
<D>__{you must have known it would happen. you couldn't have been entirely unprepared. like you said, i've been living with the guy. we were bound to get around to it sometime.}
<A>__{she laughs a bit nervously.}
<C>__{laura }
<P>__{(machine)}
<D>__{and anyway, i keep trying to tell you, that's not really the point, is it? the point is we got ourselves into an awful mess, rob... are you there? what are you thinking?}
<C>__{rob}
<P>__{(barely a whisper)}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{laura }
<D>__{we can meet for another drink if you want. so i can explain it better. i owe you that much.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{look, i gotta go. i work too, you know.}
<C>__{laura }
<D>__{will you call me?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i don't have your number.}
<C>__{laura }
<D>__{call me at work. we can arrange to meet properly. i don't want this to be the last conversation we have. i know what you're like.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{you do, huh.}
<A>__{he hangs up and stares at the wall for awhile. he gets a beer from the fridge and sits back down. he picks up the phone and dials.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{yes, a residence, a mr. ian raymond, north side... thank you.}
<A>__{he writes down a number and hangs up, then looks to camera.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{you know the worst thing about being rejected? the complete lack of control due to loss of control.}
<A>__{he picks up the phone and dials, while continuing to talk to us }
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{if i could only control the when and how of being dumped by somebody then it wouldn't seem as bad. but then, of course }
<A>__{he hangs up quickly }
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{ it wouldn't be rejection, would it? it would be mutual consent. it would be musical differences. i would be pursuing a solo career.}
