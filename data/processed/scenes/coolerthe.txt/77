<A>__{on bernie's hunched over figure, waiting on natalie. he tugs at his car keys as he wrestles with his emotions. natalie's betrayal has finally sunken in. the man's in pain. his natural instinct is to just take off. run. fuck natalie. fuck shelly. fuck this whole goddamn town. suddenly he looks up. a couple of people pass by in front of him... and then there she is. standing a few feet away, face patched up, arms clutching herself, not sure whether to approach him or not. the sight of her just breaks bernie's heart. he stands slowly, legs like jelly and in that instant it's all so clear to him. he walks over, forgiveness in his eyes, contrition in hers. she tries to say something. he shakes his head.}
