<A>__{santa claus wears shorts and sandals, ringing a bell as he collects for the salvation army. this is christmas in the southland. no snow, no winter wonderland. just a pleasantly thick heat and an unchanging season, as music continues. turning the corner, walking into frame is elaine miller, 35. she is a tall woman, consumed by the fevered conversation she's having with her pale young son william, late pre teens. they stand apart from the other shoppers. all around them is the highly charged salesmanship of the season... silver glittering fake christmas trees. she hurries her son through the commercial juggernaut, continuing their lively intellectual conversation, when something stops her. a workman is affixing letters to a store front. he has already placed the merry... now he's finishing the xmas. elaine is strong, but always pleasant, always clear about her purpose in this life.}
