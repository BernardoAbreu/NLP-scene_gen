<A>__{corey lays on her stomach in bed, studying the philosophy of time travel. the book is open to: chapter six the living receiver... the living receiver is chosen to guide the artifact into position for its journey back to the primary universe. no one knows how or why a receiver will be chosen... she flips through the onion skin pages to: chapter ten the manipulated dead... the manipulated dead are more powerful than the living receiver. if a person dies within the tangent dimension, they are able to contact the living receiver through the fourth dimensional construct... corey glances over at the closet mirror and sees billy's image reflected. she flips over and finds him standing at the foot of the bed, clad in the same garb as all her visions.}

<A>__{he points to the closet mirror... she stares into her own reflection as billy's disappears. her image starts to fade : as well, and then the surface of the mirror transforms into a three dimensional vision of a park. the focus is a swing set... and one of the swings in particular, which rocks slowly back and forth. empty. void of life.}
