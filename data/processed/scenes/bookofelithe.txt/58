<L>__{exterior house day}
<A>__{on the outskirts of a small town that lies in ruins. almost every building burned or reduced to rubble. except for one small house. the building is damaged and worn but in mostly decent condition. it stands out among its surroundings for being the only structure still intact. the windows are barred. the outer structure fortified with sheet metal and other custom patch ups. the whole plot surrounded by a chain link fence topped with razor wire. eli and solara crouch behind a pile of rubble nearby.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{i don't get it. it looks almost... normal. like nothing ever happened. how can it still be out here?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{maybe we should look inside. there might be food.}
<A>__{beat as eli considers. then stands and unhooks his shotgun.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{stay behind me.}
<A>__{they approach the house cautiously. arrive at the perimeter fence. there's a gate held in place by a padlock. eli pulls a pair of bolt cutters from his belt and snips the padlock free. swings open the gate with a metallic squeak. they move inside, up the garden path. though the soil in the yard is dead, it's been carefully raked and tended. weeds arranged in thoughtful patterns, like real flowers.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{this is weird.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{eli steps forward, his foot planting on a cracked paving stone that shifts almost imperceptibly under his feet. accompanied by a barely audible sound. he looks down.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{shit.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{a rope noose suddenly whips around their feet, tightening at their ankles and yanking them upside down into the air. eli drops his shotgun to the ground. they hang there for a moment, twisting in the breeze. the front door to the house swings open to reveal... an elderly couple. the woman's gray hair tied into a neat bun. the man bald, squinting through wire frame glasses. they look like the couple from grant wood's "american gothic." instead of a pitchfork the man holds a 12 gauge riot shotgun which he keeps trained from the hip on eli and solara. they step outside, regarding their new visitors carefully. the man seems more suspicious than his wife. he drags eli's shotgun toward him with his foot, hands it to his wife.}
<C>__{elderly man}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{my name is eli. this is solara. we're travelers, that's all. we don't mean you any harm.}
<C>__{elderly man}
<D>__{you cut my padlock. i saw you. trying to break into our house.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm sorry. we didn't think anybody lived here. we thought it was abandoned, like all the rest.}
<A>__{this seems to annoy the man.}
<C>__{elderly man}
<D>__{take a look around you. look at this yard. does it look abandoned to you?}
<A>__{clearly he's proud of the work he's done with the pitiful means at his disposal.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{no, sir. i... like what you've done with the place.}
<C>__{elderly man}
<D>__{what's your business here?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{no business. we're sorry to have troubled you. if you'll let us down we'll happily be on our way.}
<A>__{the wife steps forward, she's much warmer, less guarded.}
<C>__{elderly woman}
<D>__{george, look at them! they're not robbers or road agents! one of them's just a girl!}
<C>__{elderly man}
<D>__{seen that before. oldest trick in the book.}
<C>__{elderly woman}
<D>__{oh, stop! it's no trick. let them down!}
<A>__{the woman glares at him. the husband reluctantly accedes and moves to the concealed trap apparatus. releases the rope, dropping eli and solara to the ground in a heap. the old woman helps them to their feet. they shake off the noose from their ankles.}
<C>__{elderly woman}
<D>__{i'm so sorry about my husband. we so rarely get visitors these days, he's suspicious of everybody.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm martha and this is my husband george. would you care for some tea?}
<A>__{eli and solara exchange a look. what the hell is this?}
