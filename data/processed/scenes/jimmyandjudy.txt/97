<A>__{it's completely pitch black dark. we can see nothing. we can only hear the sound of jimmy fumbling around and breathing heavily and nervously.}
<B>__{begin nite shot}
<A>__{suddenly, we see everything, albeit in a weird black and white grainy fashion. jimmy's flipped the camera into nite shot, using the fuzzy black and white mode as a tool to see in the complete darkness. he's strapped the camera to his wrist. the image is jimmy's pov as he searches through his trunk for something. pulling aside a duffle bag, we see the 9mm pistol that jimmy stole from the cop. he grabs it as camera shuts down.}
