<A>__{an officer turns on the faucet of a sink and begins to wash his hands. we go down to the pipes beneath the porcelain basin. an old leak seeps water through a crack in the floor.}
<L>__{interior macmanus' cell night}
<A>__{a water leak starts on the ceiling. it drips faster and faster. the water begins to follow a water damaged crack along the ceiling. it slowly spreads in two directions. the brothers struggle for air in their sleep. then slowly, and at the same time, they each reach up one arm apiece and simultaneously curl their hands as if grabbing something. their straining faces are brought from darkness to light as they sit up quickly, face to the ceiling. their eyes open wide and they each draw their first breath as drops of the creeping water land on their foreheads. they look at each other across the room in shock as the drips of water still fall between them.}
