<L>__{exterior rooftop night}
<A>__{blade, whistler, and the bloodpack are gathered on a rooftop overlooking a derelict city block.}
<B>__{the house of pain}
<A>__{rises before them, a gothic revival hotel marred by graffiti scrawls and boarded up windows. there's a large neon "hotel" sign on the side of the building.}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{from what we can gather, the reapers hunt in packs, targeting places where vampires congregate. so far, they've attacked bloodbanks, safehouses, underground clubs like this }
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{i don't see any traffic, no vampire glyphs }
<A>__{whistler lifts up a pair of night vision binoculars and scans the building. whistler's pov (through binoculars) he scans the graffiti scrawls, doesn't see anything.}
<C>__{nyssa}
<D>__{look closer. because of your efforts, we've had to re think our habits, tighten our security.}
<A>__{whistler's pov (through binoculars) whistler switches to infra red. a previously unseen vampire glyph is now revealed, hidden amongst the haphazard graffiti. just beneath the glyph are a pair of loading doors set flush into the concrete sidewalk.}
<C>__{whistler}
<P>__{(lowering binocs; to blade)}
<D>__{let's put this clusterfuck in gear.}
<A>__{reinhardt reaches for whistler, stopping him.}
<C>__{reinhardt}
<D>__{you're not going anywhere, greenjeans. you won't be able to pass for us.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{like i give a shit.}
<A>__{before things can escalate, blade steps between them.}
<C>__{blade}
<P>__{(to whistler; sotto)}
<D>__{he's right. they'll smell that you're human. stay here, watch our backs.}
<C>__{whistler}
<P>__{(bristling)}
<D>__{i don't like it.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{i'm not giving you a choice, old man.}
<A>__{whistler considers blade's words, then reluctantly nods. blade rejoins the vampires. reinhardt grins.}
<C>__{reinhardt}
<D>__{you don't keep that dog of yours curbed, blade. we might have to do it for you.}
<A>__{blade pulls out the remote for the flechette in reinhardt's head, holding it up for view.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{keep pushing, asshole.}
