<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{is it a bible?}

<C>__{linda}
<D>__{well, this one of the clock's not bad.}
<A>__{linda picks up the sketch and walks over to the clock with it a few steps away. she stands comparing it to the real thing with her back to cheryl and ashly. she is only a few inches from the trap door, and cheryl wants to call out in warning when ashly kneels in front of her to speak secretly.}
<C>__{ashly}
<P>__{(in a whisper) i got it right here.}
<A>__{he taps something in his shirt pocket. cheryl is looking past him paying no attention. she watches only linda's feet, waiting for whatever is in the cellar to grab them. linda looks at the drawing in comparison.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{cheryl, this is really good. i like how you did the numbers in that wood ish style.}
<A>__{ashly produces a small box from his shirt and opens it quickly to show cheryl. it contains a gold pendant on a necklace. linda takes a step closer to the clock. she is now standing almost upon the trap door. although nailed shut, it opens slightly, pulling the nails with it. cheryl gasps. ashly is pleased with her response.}

<C>__{ashly}
<D>__{you better get washed up. i will see ya in there.}
