<A>__{fade in:}
<B>__{a bright blue tiger}
<A>__{surrounded by a pack of dogs, ten of them snarling and gnashing their teeth. the tiger's, eyes burn with fury as he wheels in a circle, lunging at one dog clawing at another, keeping them all at bay. suddenly, the tiger leaps over the dogs and transforms into a white bird, soaring majestically into the sky.}
<B>__{the face of a japanese man}
<A>__{sits up into frame, sweating, waking from a dream. he is katsumoto. we will come to know him later. fade to black. credits over. the faint sound of a brass band.}

<D>__{the leader in all forms of armament used by the united states army. when you need a friend, winchester is by your side. .}
<B>__{the face of an american man}
<A>__{as he smokes a cigar, barely listening. captain nathan algren, u.s. army, ret, 36 years old and looking every da y of it. his eyes are lined and saddened. he takes a swig from a flask. he is backstage at:}
<L>__{interior convention hall san francisco day}
<A>__{where a trade show is in progress. scantily clad lovelies in red white and blue undies demonstrate the nation's most important new export: arms. every weapon imaginable is on display: rifles, pistols, even howitzers. banners declaim the virtues of winchester and springfield. of colt and remington and smith & wesson. crowds mill around a stage. where:}
<C>__{winchester rep}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen ... the winchester corporation is proud to bring to you... a true american hero. a patriot who has proven his gallantry time and again on the field of battle.}
<A>__{little tin soldiers are all lined up. a mass of grey. rebel troops surrounding a band of blue union cavalry. a large, metal diorama.}
<C>__{winchester rep}
<D>__{i hope you will join us in welcoming ...late of the u.s. cavalry. the savior of sutter hill ... captain nathan algren!}
<A>__{a last swig. algren steels himself, then strides onstage as we reveal a banner: winchester presents: the miracle at sutter's hill! garish limelight from a row of foot lights illuminates algren.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{my thanks, mr. mccabe... ladies and gents.}
<A>__{he looks down at the little metal soldiers and begins to tell the story of the battle that made him famous. his narration is halting, unsteady:}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{... on that fateful day, johnny reb had us in a spot, perched on the lonely top of sutter's hill, nothing but grey as far as the eye could see: unhorsed and out of ammunition, i gazed down into the, um, mael... mael...}
<P>__{(squints to see better)}
<D>__{ maelstrom below us, and saw them moving up.}
<A>__{we realize he is reading from cue cards. the little rebel soldiers begin sliding up the metal hill.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{i knew it was fight or die. into the teeth of the enemy or we would all be buried... buried ...}
<P>__{(loses his place, under his breath)}
<D>__{shit...}
<P>__{(finds it again)}
<D>__{...on the same hill with our comrades a1ready gone to merciful heaven...}
<A>__{a sudden flash: algren's mind. the real battle of sutter's hill. the grim reality is ver y different from the dashing tale. union soldiers scream in agony. those horses still alive buck and froth at their tether. . algren, a lieutenant then, moves among the panicked, bloody men. he stops beside a private, his brother, david algren, 19, blonde, not much more than a boy.}
<C>__{davey}
<D>__{they're coming, nate.}
<A>__{he looks over the wall. rebel troops are moving up the hill.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{keep your head down.}

<D>__{you watch me now. do whatever i say. .}
<C>__{davey}
<D>__{aye a ye, lieutenant.}
<A>__{algren punches his shoulder and moves on down the line. nearby, algren's friend, sergeant zebulah gant, though severel y wounded, reloads his revolver with the last of his ammunition.}
<C>__{gant}
<D>__{how're the horses?}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{better than you. smell better, too.}
<P>__{(looks at him)}
<D>__{can you hold on, zeb?}
<C>__{gant}
<P>__{(fighting the pain)}
<D>__{i got i choice?}
<A>__{algren smiles sadly. his mend will die loon without medical attention. algren moves down the line, bullets whizzing overhead. he kneels beside colonel bagley, his commanding officer.}
<C>__{bagley}
<P>__{(panicking)}
<D>__{we need a flag. find me a goddamn white flag!}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{what are you talking about?!}
<C>__{bagley}
<D>__{surrender, damn it! that's an order!}
<A>__{back to the convention hall:}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{no thought of surrender among those boy. better to die as god made us, we thought, as soldiers... so i gave the order. mister bugler, sound mount up. mister bugler, sound prepare arms. there were only thirty of us, but we had fire in us yet. i looked down the hill at the destiny ordained for us. and gave the order. mister . bugler, charge!}
<A>__{the little union cavalry soldiers begin moving down slots in the hill. on sutter's hill: algren leads a chaotic cavalry charge down the hill toward the advancing rebel infantry artillery explosi ons bullets snapping, trees shattering. algren's brother, davey, rides beside him. the wounded sergeant gant pulls himself up, waves his cap and yells. bagley remains cowering behind the stone wall. back to the convention hall:}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{and straight into them we went...}
<A>__{on sutter's hill : carnage. union and confederate soldiers slam together, falling, drowning in mud and blood, stepped on by panicked hones. algren wields his saber in one hand and his revolver in the other, serving death on all sides. a soldier riding next to davey is shot. a horse falls into a shellhole. back to the convention hall:}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{"hip hip hurray" we shouted, for we had spirit in us yet }
<A>__{more flashes: algren slices right and left with his saber. he is a truly gifted swordsman. a tree branch knocks davey from his horse. he sits, dazed, on the ground. algren kills a rebel soldier just as be is about to fire on him. single handedly, be rallies his men, screaming orders, then lifts his wounded brother onto the saddle beside him. he leads them downhill toward safel y, davey clinging to him for dear life. back to the convention hall:}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{before they knew what hit them, we had broken through into the rear of the rebel army.}
<A>__{on sutter's hill: algren and his men gather in a copse of trees. they are giddy with the exhilaration of having survived.}
<C>__{davey}
<D>__{we did it, bro', we did it! whoeeeee!!}
<A>__{algren's smile is shortlived, though. suddenly, the woods erupt with gunfire. trees are shredded. algren's men are literally cut to pieces davey is riddled with bullets, his dead body shielding algren from harm until he slides, lifeless, to the mud.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{davey !!!!}
<A>__{men and horses are torn apart they contort and writhe in agony jerking grotesquely as the bullets rip into them. algren frantica1ly tries to locate the source of this firepower. then he sees: a gatling gun. six barrels glisten like steel teeth. this early machine gun is the pinnacle of current military might 60 rounds a second a triumph in engineering.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{ahhhhhhh !!!!!}
<A>__{with insane courage, he wheels and charges the gun. bullets rip into horse and rider alike. algren falls, lifeless, into the mud. back to the convention hall:}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{and the 23rd rode on to glory.}
<A>__{applause. at the back of the hall three elegantly dressed japanese men watch algren's performance. they wear western frock coats and top hats}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{now let me: tell you, gentlemen, if there's one thing on earth i could have had with me on that glorious day, it would have been this beauty...}
<A>__{algren holds up a winchester repeating rifle. at the back of the audience we note someone else watching algren. sergeant zebulon gant, whom we last saw on sutter's hill.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{the winchester model '73 lever action rifle. 15 shot capacity, one round per second, accurate at 400 yards. you'll note the patented loading port just beneath the cartridge chamber and the smooth cocking action. ...lets' just see here }
<A>__{he peers into the ejection port as he cocks the weapon and sights out over the crowd. ka boom!!! the report echoes among the screams of the ladies. dust and glass fall from a rear chandelier.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{smooth trigger action, too.}
<A>__{audience members murmur nervousl y.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{this is, gentlemen, the gun that is winning the west... step on up and take a look. mr. mccabe is here to answer any question and take orders. i thank you.}
<A>__{later... a winchester representative is handing algren an envelope.}

<D>__{june 17th, 1876. the dead are with me tonight. they return each time i am obliged to tell their story.}
<L>__{interior squalid bar night}
<A>__{algren sips absinthe. he stares at the milky, green liquid before him.}
<C>__{algren }
<D>__{i can almost see them in the shadows, their bodies whole and beautiful once more. sometimes it's as if they call to me in a sweet invitation }
<L>__{exterior gas lit street night}

<C>__{algren }
<D>__{"do not be afraid," they whisper. "you have been dead, too."}
<A>__{a sudden flash: we are back on sutter's hill. algren's slaughtered cavalry litter the bloody ground, dead to the last man. a rebel army surgeon gives a cursory look at each body before it is loaded onto a wagon. algren's turn is no different than the others. he is declared dead and hoisted unceremoniously onto the pile of corpses. back in the. hotel room.: algren sits, staring into the middle distance.}
<C>__{algren }
<D>__{is this why they gave their lives? so that i might disgrace their memory?}
<A>__{he reaches into the suitcase and takes out a colt revol ver. stares at it, cracks the cylinder to make sure it's loaded. his finger wraps around the trigger, the barrel makes its wa y toward his head. and then, unaccountabl y, he is laughing.}
<C>__{algren }
<D>__{and why, after taking so many lives, do i find myself incapable of taking just one more?}
<A>__{a knock on the door. algren shuts his eyes, then calls out.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{go awa y.}
<C>__{gant }
<D>__{not exactly the greeting i imagined.}
<A>__{algren looks up. he knows that voice. he carefully puts the revolver back into the suitcase and shuts it before opening the door.}
<C>__{gant}
<D>__{thought you'd seen the last of me, i expect.}

<L>__{interior restaurant night}
<A>__{gant leads algren into a lush san francisco restaurant. flickering gaslight and trays of lobster. colonel benjamin bagley (whom we saw in flashback) sits with the three japanese men. bagley's hair has greyed. he has his eye on a political future.}

<D>__{nathan, good to see you.}
<C>__{algren}
<P>__{(stunned)}

<C>__{bagley}
<D>__{they're looking to hire real american soldiers to create the first japanese imperial army.}
<A>__{algren looks at him.}
<C>__{bagley}
<D>__{japan's got it in mind to become a civilized country and they're willing to spend what it takes to hire white experts to do the job right.}
<A>__{algren takes a slow lip of whiskey.}
<C>__{bagley}
<D>__{sergeant gant has already agreed to serve. you would be m y second in command.}
<C>__{algren.}
<D>__{with approval from washington, of course.}

<D>__{both governments prefer to consider our mission unofficial. we'd be there as non combatants}
<C>__{bagley}
<D>__{only, advisors to the japanese officers. help them with training, ordinance and the like.}
<C>__{gant}
<D>__{you ought to think about it., captain. unless you intend to take up a career in the theater.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{i have an agreement with the winchester corporation i'm sure these people have some concept of what an agreement is.}
<A>__{omura suddenly speaks. his english is flawless.}

<C>__{algren}
<D>__{a year?}

<C>__{omura}
<D>__{...after the shogun gave up power, the daimyos you would call them warlords knew that japan needed a centralized government. so they asked}

<D>__{the hereditary emperor, his highness the enlightened meiji, to lead the country.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{and these warlords just ... gave up hundreds of years of power?}
<C>__{omura}

<C>__{algren}
<D>__{what about those that didn't?}
<C>__{omura}
<D>__{to deal with those who have resisted, the emperor has decided to create an army with allegiance only to him... we considered hiring advisors from germany, but your ambassador reminded us of your experience in suppressing rebellious elements in your civil war.}
<A>__{this evocation of the civil war is not lost on algren.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{who are we supposed to be fighting against?}
<C>__{omura}
<D>__{his name is mori katsumoto. he is samurai.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{samurai?}
<C>__{omura}
<D>__{the word you might use it "warrior". but that does not quite capture it ... katsumoto once served the emperor but he is now a traitor who leads a band of traitors. he must be punished.}

<C>__{bagley}
<D>__{what's a hero to do when there's no more great battles?}
<C>__{omura}
<D>__{is that an evasive answer?}
<C>__{bagley}
<D>__{sir, this man was left for dead at sutter's hill. doct ors swore his heart had stopped beating, but before they could bury him, he came back to life. after the war he fought the sioux, the cree, and the blackfoot.}
