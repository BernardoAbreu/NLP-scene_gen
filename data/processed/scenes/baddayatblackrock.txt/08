<L>__{interior hotel}
<A>__{it is a typical small town hotel, but crummier, with a tiny lobby. macreedy is waiting at the empty desk as hector strolls in, flopping his enormous bulk into a nicked and mothy chair. he picks up a newspaper, but his eyes remain on macreedy. macreedy waits patiently for the absent clerk. for a moment, he studies the open registration ledger; his eyes rove from the ink splotched blotter up over the desk to one of those world war ii banners, the imitation silk now stained and faded. it depicts a shrieking eagle rampant, clutching the flag in a claw. under it, the legend:}
<D>__{"god bless america"}
<A>__{near it, a tacky placard proclaims: do all the good you can, by all the means you can, in all the ways you can, at all the times you can, to all the people you can,}
<B>__{as long as ever you can.}
<A>__{feeling the eyes of hector on him, macreedy turns. hector meets his gaze with bland, insolent interest. now a young man (his name is pete) comes out of a small room behind the registration desk and walks up to it. there is a softness about his regular features, a certain indefinable sugariness about his mouth. he seems tight lipped, for lorn and uneasy as he faces macreedy across the counter.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(pleasantly)}
<D>__{i'd like a room.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{all filled up.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{got any idea where i might }
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(stiffly, shaking his head)}
<D>__{this is 1945, mister. there's been a war on.}
<A>__{macreedy looks at the young man with impeccable tolerance. without shifting his gaze, he slowly lets fall his small suitcase. it thuds softly on the frayed carpet.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{i thought it ended a couple of months ago.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{yeah, but the o.p.a. lingers on.}
<A>__{macreedy looks down at the open ledger on the desk before him. the clerk reaches out to close it. gently, yet firmly, macreedy stops him, reopening the big book. he studies it, a finger straying unconsciously inside his collar. he [...] on it to relieve the starchy stiffness. pete begins to fidget...}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{you don't know about the o.p.a...}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(without looking up)}
<D>__{tell me.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{well, for establishments with less'n fifty rooms hotel keepers got to report regularly about...}
<A>__{his voice fades desperately.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{...about tenants and... and... registration...}
<P>__{(drawing himself up)}
<D>__{there are penalties imposed...}
<A>__{again his voice trails off.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(eyes still on the ledger)}
<D>__{you seem to have lots of vacancies.}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(uncomfortable)}
<D>__{well... as i said...}
<A>__{macreedy leans over the counter to a rack of keys. he runs his splayed fingers over the key rack as...}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{lots of vacancies.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{they're everyone of 'em locked up. some are show rooms...}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{yes...?}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(with touching sincerity)}
<D>__{...for cattle buyers, feed salesmen. the others they're spoken for, rented to cowboys, ranch hands...}
<P>__{(macreedy listens respectfully)}
<D>__{they pay by the month. for when they come into town. we provide for their every wish and comfort.}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{you understand...?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{not really. but while i'm pondering it, get a room ready. just for tonight.}
<P>__{(picking key from rack at random)}
<D>__{this one.}
<A>__{pete opens his mouth but no sound comes out. [...] at hector. close shot hector glowering at pete. two shot macreedy and pete as macreedy signs the ledger.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(signing)}
<D>__{sure could use a bath. where is it?}
<A>__{he picks up the key.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{head of the stairs.}
<A>__{macreedy nods, reaches for the bag at his feet. then he hesitates, looks at hector.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{i don't know just why you're interested but the name's macreedy. i'm...}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{it's all in the ledger.}
<C>__{hector}
<P>__{(slowly, his eyes}
<D>__{glued to macreedy's}
<P>__{stiff arm)}
<D>__{you look like you need a hand.}
<A>__{macreedy says nothing. the wales along his face harden. he picks up his bag and climbs the stairs. as he disappears, hector lumbers to the desk and grabs the ledger.}
<C>__{hector}
<P>__{(reading aloud)}
<D>__{john j. macreedy. from los angeles.}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{i wanna know everything he does, pete. check every call any mail.}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{and in the meantime...?}
<C>__{hector}
<P>__{(grinning harshly)}
<D>__{in the meantime, i will crowd him a little...}
<P>__{(looking up the stairs)}
<D>__{...see if he's got any iron in his blood...}
<A>__{as pete bites his lower lip thoughtfully,}
