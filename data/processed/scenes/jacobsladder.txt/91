<L>__{interior jacob's apt. night}
<A>__{jacob, stark naked and covered with goose bumps, runs his hands under a shower spray. the water is freezing and taking forever to warm up. anxious, he dashes past his gasoline drenched clothes, grabs a suitcase from the bedroom closet, and stuffs it with clothes. then he hurries back to the shower, tests it, and jumps in. lather covers jacob's hair and hangs over his tightly closed eyes. his entire body is covered in suds. he is washing as quickly as he can. suddenly he hears a noise as someone enters the bathroom. he tenses.}

<D>__{who's there? who is it?}

<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{goddamn it! who's there?}
<A>__{jacob rubs his eyes, fighting to see. suddenly the shower curtain is thrown back. jacob backs against the wall. a hand reaches in and pulls his nipple, pinching hard.}
