<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior the euclid bar}
<A>__{a dive furnished with a few mismatched chairs and a bar. a single overweight patron sits at a corner table with face buried in his hands as he whimpers. jake and, lionel dolby pass him as they emerge from a back hallway. miles, late 20's, wipes blood off the bar. placed at the edge of the bar are two briefcases, both open, both filled with neat stacks of blood splattered money. a dead guy lies face down on the floor in a pool of blood. jake grabs the dead guy's legs as lionel watches in disbelief.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{come on. grab his arms.}
<A>__{lionel stands frozen. jake, drops the dead guy's legs with a thud.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{lionel... he's dead. yeah, maybe you didn't pull the trigger, but you were standing right there and watched me do it. help me. grab his arms.}
<A>__{the police sirens grow louder.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{tick tock...}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{if you wanna help, then help. if not, shut up.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{your mess.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{then shut up.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{my place.}
<A>__{miles lets out a little chuckle; it's just enough to set jake off again. jake pulls the gun and points it at miles.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{oh please...}
<A>__{miles non chalantly pulls a sawed off shot gun frown under the bar.}
<C>__{miles }
<D>__{you think this kinda shit hasn't happened here before? given it's usually on thursdays. and usually, i gotta tell the cops, "no, officer... i didn't really get a good look at the shooters." usually anyway.}
<C>__{patron}
<P>__{(without looking up)}
<D>__{i didn't see nothing. and i swear if you let me go now, i won't say }
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{relax, porkchop.}
<A>__{the police sirens sound like they're right outside.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{i can't be here!}
<A>__{jake cocks his gun, never taking his stare off miles.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{then go.}
<A>__{lionel looks at the briefcases of bloodied money.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{what about... the money?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{what about this situation makes you think i can answer that question right now?}
<A>__{lionel again looks at the briefcases; then the shotgun leveled at jake; then at the direction of the police sirens... he runs for the door without a second thought.}
