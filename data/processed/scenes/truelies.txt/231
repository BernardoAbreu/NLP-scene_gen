<L>__{interior suite door night}
<A>__{crash!! the door lock is shattered by tremendous force and three men burst into the room. we may recognize them as workers from juno's shop. they are wielding pistols and are clearly part of malik's terrorist brigade. harry is still groggy, and he doesn't want to start anything with helen there, and risk her getting shot. he acquiesces as they pull him to his feet.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{he's got nothing to do with this. it's me you want, right?}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(to lead terrorist)}
<D>__{let the hooker go. she's not important.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{harry, be quiet. let me handle this.}
<C>__{lead terrorist}
<D>__{shutup, both of you.}
<A>__{during this exchange, the thugs have handcuffed harry's hands behind his back. the leader gestures to one of the men to bring helen along. helen and harry are dragged roughly out of the room with pistol muzzles stuck in their ribs.}
