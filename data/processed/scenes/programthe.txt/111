<L>__{interior joe's room night}
<A>__{joe lies on his bed, a bottle of vodka next to his coca cola. he stares at the larger than life cardboard stand up of himself. he takes a drink, then gets up and grabs his jacket. the phone rings. he looks at it a beat, then walks out of the room.}
<L>__{interior camille's room night}
<A>__{camille's on the phone, waiting, the one calling joe. she listens a few more rings, hangs up, concerned.}
