<A>__{robbie is wide awake. he is staring out the window from under the covers. there is a flash of lightning. robbie begins nervously counting.}

<D>__{one... two... three... four... five...}
<A>__{the sound of rolling thunder. robbie tenses and watches the tree. angle window a wind rustles the gnarled branches. the sky is a rolling mass of gray and black. a second flash of lightning and robbie whispers to himself.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{one... two... three...}
<A>__{crackle! rumble! the window pane vibrates as the shock wave from the thunder bears down and the wind begins to dance with the tree.}
