<A>__{half an hour later, brown races up to the queen's carriage amid a swarm of servants, ladies' maids and householders rushing to be ready in time. suddenly the huge castle doors open and victoria bustles out with her entourage in tow. brown only just in time yanks open the door for victoria to step past him and take her place. she ignores him completely. brown slams the doors. as he looks up, he sees his brother archie staring at him from across the courtyard. for a second the two brothers hold each other's gaze. it's obvious that archie has noticed the queen's indifference. brown turns away and mounts the box as the carriage races away under him.}
