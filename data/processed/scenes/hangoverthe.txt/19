<B>__{the next morning}
<A>__{shafts of white desert sunlight pour into}
<B>__{the dean martin suite}
<A>__{the camera follows a live chicken as it walks through the totalled suite. furniture is broken, the minibar ransacked, and the floor is covered with remnants of the night before: empty beer cans, platefuls of room service food, a cowboy hat, the gideon bible, half eaten skinless mangos, a bra, a battle axe, etc. snoring on the couch, wearing only his jeans and one shoe, the word asshole written in sharpie across his chest, is stu. title card: "saturday, 11:15am" the chicken struts across the top of the couch, until it reaches a plastic coin cup from bellagio blocking its path. beat. then the chicken pecks it off...onto stu. the cup hits stu in the face, and stale beer splashes all over him. stu spastically jerks awake and flips off the couch, onto a pile of newspapers.}
<C>__{pile of newspapers}
<D>__{oww! get off! get off! jesus!}
<A>__{confused, stu clambers off the pile of newspapers to find vick sleeping underneath, on the floor, fully dressed. vick pulls himself onto the couch, clearly in pain.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{damn, dude, why are you retarded?}
<A>__{both men are ragingly hungover. a long beat as both of them rub their faces, then:}
<C>__{vick }

<C>__{stu}
<D>__{yo.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{why do you have a mullet?}
<A>__{stu does, in fact, have a mullet haircut. but he's too hungover to understand.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{you know, business on top, party down the back?}
<A>__{stu still looks confused. this is excruciating for vick.}
<C>__{vick }
<D>__{your hair, dude. you have a mullet.}
<A>__{stu touches his hair. then he stumbles into the bathroom. after a beat, we hear his voice:}
<C>__{stu }
<D>__{dude...i have a mullet.}
<A>__{then we hear alan's voice in the bathroom, groggy:}
<C>__{alan }
<D>__{just give me ten more minutes, beck...}
<C>__{stu }
<D>__{whoa, did you sleep in the tub?}
<A>__{beat, then stu pokes his head out of the bathroom.}
<C>__{stu }
<D>__{check it out: alan slept in the tub.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{get him up. i'm hungry.}
<A>__{stu disappears back into the bathroom. we hear the shower turn on. beat. then we hear alan slowly awaken:}
<C>__{alan }
<D>__{wet. water. jesus, what's ?!}
<A>__{there's a thud as alan falls out of tub. beat. then stu and a very confused, very hungover, very wet alan stumble out of the bathroom. alan appears to be wearing his polo shirt from the night before. only, as we pull back, we see that his shirt is cut off at his chest he's naked from there down.}
<C>__{vick}
<D>__{jesus, dude, put away your sack.}
<A>__{alan looks down at his hairy nakedness, totally bewildered.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{yeah, and it might be time for some manscaping, bro. your bush looks like yanni.}
<A>__{alan looks back up again, squinting, hungover.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{what did we do last night?}
