<L>__{ext charity garden party day}
<A>__{...a large well kept lawn covered with smart guests, business people, politicians, pop stars, celebs... behind and beyond them is an impressive country house. a small orchestra is playing. there is a marquee. waiters and waitresses move amongst the assembled notables bearing trays of drinks and food. tony is the focus of attention. a tv current affairs news journalist with camera crew is following him around.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{sustainability's great, if you can achieve it. the problem is, in many cases you simply can't, for a whole variety of reasons.}
<A>__{tony smiles and shakes the hand of someone in a wheelchair. a group of guests burst into spontaneous applause. everybody loves and admires tony. he smiles boyishly. he moves on. the tv crew stay with him.}
<C>__{journalist}
<D>__{aren't you running the risk of entrenching the need for charity by increasingly institutionalising it?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{look, charity, like poor little olga...}
<P>__{(referring to the little girl)}
<D>__{...is always with us, to coin a phrase...}
<A>__{valentina appears. she is beautifully dressed, coiffed, made up, she looks stunning.}
<C>__{tony }
<P>__{(to valentina)}
<D>__{ah, there you are, my lovely.}
<A>__{she and tony exchange broad smiles. they're in love. he pulls her to his side and puts his arm around her. the photographers snap away.}
<C>__{journalist}
<D>__{and what's your message to the prime minister?}
<C>__{tony}
<P>__{(laughs engagingly)}
<D>__{i wouldn't presume to have a 'message' for the prime minister... fortunately for the foundation, i think we pretty much see eye to eye on most things.}
<A>__{now we hear a distant buzzing. everybody looks up. they see a speck in the sky, it's the prime minister's approaching helicopter... tony and the posse of journalists and photographers rush off leaving valentina standing alone.}
