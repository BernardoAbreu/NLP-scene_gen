<L>__{interior diner morning}
<A>__{sam sits at the booth where she and corey sat before, and agatha sets down a glass of orange juice.}
<C>__{agatha}
<D>__{dusty gibbens has been comin' in here for coffee ever since i can remember... gives me the shivers.}
<A>__{ted pipes up from behind the counter:}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{they should hang guys like that. only thing bothers me is how many of `em are still out there...}
<A>__{chris enters the diner and catches the end of ted's rant.}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{hang `em all.}
<C>__{agatha}
<P>__{(to sam)}
<D>__{i will be right back with your breakfast.}
<A>__{as agatha moves off, chris sees sam and approaches her table.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{may i?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i guess you heard.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{it's so messed up... i feel bad that i recommended him now.}
<A>__{agatha notices that chris has sat down with sam.}
<C>__{agatha}
<D>__{what can i get you, honey?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{uh... sausage, eggs, coffee, please.}
<C>__{agatha}
<D>__{white or wheat?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{wheat toast, please...}
<A>__{he refocuses his attention back on sam.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{if i had kids, i'd be worried sick about `em in a world like this. i'm sure your parents must be.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{hey, you could've been some crazy rapist serial killer.}
<A>__{agatha is there with his coffee just in time to hear this last part. she gives chris and sam each an odd look before setting the coffee down and leaving.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{you turned out okay.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{yeah, but everybody doesn't.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i can take care of myself.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i'm sure you can... but i wouldn't feel right if i didn't tell you about jeremy.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what about him?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i don't know what you have goin' with him... but you shouldn't be hangin' around him. let's just leave it at that.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what makes you think you can tell me who i can and can't hang around with?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{it's just that i know him better than you do. he lived in my neighborhood when we were kids.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{so he used to do weird stuff... to animals.}
<A>__{sam waits for him to go on.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{my sister lost her pet rabbit once, and we went all over the neighborhood lookin' for it. we were just about to call it quits when we heard something comin' from jeremy's garage. he'd stuck it in a trash can and put the lid on.}
<A>__{sam looks shocked and a little disgusted.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{it was half starved by the time we got it home. died just a few days later.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{how old was he?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i don't know, just a couple years. cute little black and white }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no. jeremy.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{he was like nine, probably.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{he was just a kid, he didn't know what he was doing.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{when you were nine years old did you know it was wrong to put a living creature in the trash can and leave it there?}
<A>__{sam's had enough.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{chris... you're a nice guy, but you don't have to be looking out for me. you're not my dad, you're not my big brother...}
<A>__{chris hangs his head, frustrated.}
