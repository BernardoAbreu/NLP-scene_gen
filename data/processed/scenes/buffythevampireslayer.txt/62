<L>__{interior warehouse afternoon}
<A>__{grey, dusty and long since abandoned. sunlight pours in through the large windows, practically caked with dust. old crates are stacked here and there, bits of manikins leaning on one or two. merrick sits on a crate, reading the newspaper. buffy enters hesitantly, puts down her bookbag next to a pile of merrick's stuff, including a rolled up sleeping bag. this is definitely not her turf. she runs her finger along a crate, picks up a world of dust. she holds up her finger at merrick.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{fire the help. no kidding.}
<A>__{merrick looks up at her.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{it's not pretty, but it does suit our purposes.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{our purposes.}
<A>__{she repeats it not with attitude, but a dull wonder at her connection with this strange man. she crosses to him.}
<C>__{buffy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{what, um... what do we do?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{there's a great deal i have to show you, i'm not even sure where to start there's so little time.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{why do you keep saying that?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{do you know what a vampire king is?}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{a vampire king? you mean like dracula?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{oh, yes. and the man from your dreams. lothos.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{oh, him.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{yes. they travel about, usually with one or two of their followers to lay the groundwork. the vampires find a community and they feed on it, make it their own. you were difficult to trace, and i think the process has gone a lot further than i'd anticipated. usually this goads a community into some kind of paranoid frenzy. but for some reason, nobody here seems to be paying any attention.}
<C>__{buffy}
<P>__{(not paying attention)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{we'll cover it later.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{i still don't get how they happened to come to my town. i mean, was i born here because... because they were coming here? that lothos guy, and his buddies?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{in a way, yes. your fate is inexorably connected to them.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{great. first i have a birthright, now i've got a fate. hey, do i have to take notes on this?}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(put down his paper)}
<D>__{we're going to have the work hard. you'll need some excuse for staying out. for your parents.}
<A>__{buffy laughs.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{not a pressing issue.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{i tell you, the best thing i can do right now is find out more about you. what your strengths are, your likes... everything. what's your best subject?}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{uh... gym.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{yes, you used to do gymnastics. but you stopped. why?}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{well, everybody says... it's just kind of dorky. i mean, have you ever seen a gymnast's legs? they're like }
<P>__{(indicating huge)}
<D>__{ the mighty oak. it's not a look.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{but you enjoyed it, yes?}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{well... i do cheerleading now. it's way cooler.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{cheerleading. for... sporting events, yes?}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{sporting events, yeah.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{all right. why don't you show me a cheer?}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{here?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{yes, yes. it would be interesting. a nice cheer.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{buffy starts, a bit awkwardly, doing a cheer.}
<C>__{buffy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{who we gonna beat?}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(pathetically following her motion)}
<D>__{who we gonna beat?}
<C>__{buffy}
<P>__{(stops)}
<D>__{no you don't have to }
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{oh. i thought... you lead me }
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{no. you don't do anything. i do it.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{oh. good.}
<A>__{she starts again.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{who we gonna beat? who do we defeat? who will we be pulverizing into cream of wheat?}
<A>__{gradually, buffy gets more into the cheer. the steps become more complicated as she repeats the verse. closeup merrick's hand we see a knife slip out of merrick's sleeve. he palms it, hands behind his back. in the middle of her routine, he hurls it at her. she catches it, reflexively, inches from her face. stops dead. then bursts into tears. merrick is thrown off by this reaction.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{oh, what the hell is wrong with you? you threw a knife at my head!}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{i had to test you.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{but you threw a knife at my head!}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{and you caught it! only the chosen one could have done that.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{i don't want to be the chosen one, okay? i don't want to spend the rest of my life chasing after vampires! i just want to graduate from high school, go to europe, marry charlie sheen and die. it may not sound too exciting to a sconehead like you, but i think it's swell. and then you come along... and... and then i'm a member of the hairy mole club, so you throw things at me!}
<A>__{she is coming at him now. he begins to back up.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{it was necessary.}
<C>__{buffy}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{last night. you knew i was sitting on a fresh grave, didn't you?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{i don't think you understand the full implications of }
<A>__{buffy punches him in the face. he goes flying a good ways, lands on his back. his nose bleed merrily. buffy stops.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{oh. sorry.}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(getting up)}
<D>__{don't you see what's happening? you're changing. you've got powers you've only just begun to tap. physical, mental prowess you've never dreamed of.}
<P>__{(pulling a handkerchief out of his pocket)}
<D>__{god, this hurts. i've administered a few shocks to your system to start the adrenaline working. i'm sorry i have to take so many shortcuts in the training process.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{put your head back.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{two days ago, would you have even hit me? let alone so powerfully?}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{no... i guess i would have gotten jeffrey to hit you.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{exactly. you're changing. you're becoming something extraordinarily powerful.}
<A>__{buffy looks at the knife in her hand. the music comes up and we...}
