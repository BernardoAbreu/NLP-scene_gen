<A>__{dark office night the laughing man pushes kafka down into a chair and shakes with uncontrollable sobbing shrieks. someone else is sitting in darkness behind a huge desk (murnau). his hand holds out a small vial. the laughing man grabs it and leaves, gulping down its contents voraciously.}
<C>__{murnau}
<D>__{i assume you're wondering ... what all this has been about.}
<A>__{kafka tries to see into the shadows.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{are you the head of medical records?}
<A>__{the door behind kafka opens again and an officious bureaucrat (ekman) comes in. he sits in a chair and looks at kafka.}
<C>__{murnau}
<P>__{(to ekman)}
<D>__{he's come on his own initiative.}
<P>__{(to kafka)}
<D>__{ not something we encourage, mind you, but we like to know it exists.}
<A>__{and he's stood up.}
<C>__{murnau}
<D>__{what it amounts to is simply this ...}
<A>__{he's coming around the desk. he's drying his hands on a towel.}
<C>__{murnau}
<D>__{a piece of paper was delivered to the wrong clerk. it was essential he bring it back to us. these complications have arisen because he had friends like you, among others friends unlikely to let a sleeping dog lie.}
<A>__{he tosses the towel onto the desk. ekman looks irritated by this.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{... a piece of paper ...}
<C>__{murnau}
<D>__{a mere slip.}
<P>__{(coming forward)}
<D>__{your friend mr. raban dealt only with claims that came in , another department being responsible for compensation that goes out this is correct?}
<A>__{he places a fatherly hand on kafka's shoulder.}
<C>__{murnau}
<P>__{(not quite in the light yet)}
<D>__{through a very unfortunate and i might add extremely rare mishap, a document intended for the one department was sent to the other. and for the first time though your friend wasn't aware of it two and two could have been put together to make one.}
<C>__{kafka}
<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{... a piece of paper ...}
<C>__{murnau}
<P>__{(face bending into the light)}
<D>__{you see, kafka, in all cases relating to the factory at orlac which is what this paper referred to the authority that puts in a request and the authority that grants it is, to all intents and purposes, the same authority.}
<A>__{and he's an impressive, imposing figure of authority himself. you'd probably trust him. you'd certainly respect him. but if you look into his eyes, he's frightening.}
