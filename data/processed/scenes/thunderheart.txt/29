<A>__{off in a backfield, lit by a hot fire, a small round hut covered in patchwork quilts, canvas and buffalo hide. a strange mist floats around it, and from inside, voices are heard a drumming and chanting in lakota. and eagle sounds. dozens of shrill whistles. are there birds inside this thing? reverse ray and cooch, kneeling in the weeds, look dumbfounded. and more than a little unnerved.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{what the hell is that?}
<B>__{near the inipi lodge}
<A>__{an indian youth door tender with shoulder length hair falling over a t shirt, steps out of the dark and walks to the fire. he prods it with a broken pitch fork. he turns to get some more wood and walks right into an m 16, trained chest level. ray stares him down.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{on the ground.}
<A>__{the boy drops boot camp fast. cooch moves up on the sweat lodge, looking quizzically at it, trying to figure out how to open it. he grabs a canvas flap at the front and after a moment's hesitation and a look at ray, he tears the flap away. a blast of 200 degree steam explodes forth and cooch dances back, throwing up his rifle.}
<C>__{voice }
<P>__{(inside lodge)}
<D>__{mitakue oyasin!}
<A>__{grandpa samuel reaches, a rail thin sioux elder, appears through the steam like a vision. bent in the tiny doorway, he searches out the interruption. cooch aims the m 16 at the old man.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{this is the fbi! come on out of there nice and slow. let's move it! hands on your head!}
<A>__{grandpa reaches crawls out first, ignoring the "hands on your head" order from cooch. his eyes move back and forth between the two agents. five more indians, from 16 45 come out, looking confused. cooch makes the towel wrapped men spread out in a line. the old man is speaking to the others in lakota, and ray steps up to him, cuts him off.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{hands on your head, sir. come on, come on...}
<A>__{the archaic figure just looks through him. starts to walk away. ray takes his thin arm. he locks eyes with the old man. slowly, he obeys, raising his hands and laying them on his head. from the lodge, the last man emerges. it's crazy horse reborn out of the burning sage. jimmy looks twice is in his mid thirties big, well over two hundred pounds. but lean. his braids fall nearly to his hips. his face is handsome but at the moment, twisted in a full blood's scowl.}
<C>__{looks twice}
<P>__{(outraged)}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{james looks twice?}
<C>__{looks twice}
<D>__{that's right. what are you doing here? this is a religious ceremony you're desecrating.}
<A>__{looks twice shoots hawk like black eyes onto ray.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{we're fbi, james. we just need to ask you a few questions.}
<C>__{looks twice}
<D>__{we are in the middle of a sweat lodge ceremony. do you drag people out of your churches when they're in the middle of prayer?}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{let's take a walk, jimmy. come on.}
<A>__{cooch takes a careful step behind jimmy and cuffs him. looks twice speaks to the others in lakota, and they disband, heading to a shade arbor where their clothes hang. as cooch starts marching looks twice toward the house, ray keeps an eye on the departing. one of them stops halfway to the fence and turns. grandpa reaches looks at ray with eyes that have seen one hundred and one hard years in indian country.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{go ahead. you can all go home.}
<A>__{and he follows cooch and the cuffed jimmy to the house.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{we just wanna take a look around your place, jimmy. we're not here to bust your balls.}
<B>__{at the back of the house}
<A>__{cooch leads the half naked suspect to the backdoor. cooch show: a warrant, tries the door but it is locked.}
<C>__{looks twice}
<D>__{what's this about?}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{your good friend leo fast elk.}
<C>__{looks twice}
<D>__{you think i killed him? cuz he was an apple? well, let me tell you something about leo, man }
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{ don't "man" me, jimmy. where's the key?}
<A>__{jimmy doesn't answer. he glares with hatred into cooch's eyes.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{ray, use the federal master key.}
<A>__{ray steps up, gets ready to throw a frontkick at the door.}
<C>__{looks twice}
<D>__{no. don't do that. don't deface the property, man. the key's in there.}
<A>__{with his hands cuffed, he can only jerk his head toward a big hole in the wall down near the foundation. cooch quickly drops to a knee and checks out the hole.}
<C>__{looks twice}
<D>__{inside... in the coffee can.}
<A>__{cooch reaches in, probes.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{there's no coffee can in }
<A>__{something horrifying happens so fast, cooch has no time to react. whatever has taken his arm has done so with such force, his body jolts like he's touched raw voltage. the south dakota badger rips through his leather jacket we get a glimpse of its striped face and yellowed teeth through his shirt. through flesh, and deeper, growling insanely while cooch hollers in shock tries to pull free and jimmy looks twice spins from the porch with a skillfully executed back kick, knocking ray off the step and to the ground. the indian bolts like a deer into the darkness. ray rolls in the grass, throwing his m 16 up. he hesitates. but only for a moment before firing and decimating the corner gutter, a junked car, several trees. but no sign of jimmy. cooch falls back in the grass badly mauled. his arm has been ripped open down to the bone.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{jesus... jesus...}
<A>__{ray starts toward cooch.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{get him...}
<A>__{ray takes off, crashing through weeds, into a stream, wading through mud. he throws his flashlight left and right. he crosses the river, shines the light in a field of wild sage. nothing. he runs like a sprinter, looking everywhere. but as he enters an }
<B>__{open field}
<A>__{all he finds is jimmy's towel. he picks it up and looks around the area, breathing heavily. and then suddenly, something leaps up out of the grass. ray swings his m 16 up, ready to blast. but it is a deer, taking off into a mystical blue night. the drum. beating fast. heavy.}
<B>__{turtleshell rattle. eagle bone whistles. in the yard}
<A>__{cooch traps his bleeding arm between his knees to stanch the blood. he speaks quietly but firm into his radio, trying to stay in control.}
<C>__{cooch}
<P>__{(into radio)}
<D>__{assault on federal officers. suspect has left the area. one officer down. issue a fugitive alert immediately. over.}
<C>__{radio}
<D>__{has the officer been shot, x 22?}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{no, the officer's been bitten by a fucking badger, okay? get a fugitive alert fucking now! over.}
