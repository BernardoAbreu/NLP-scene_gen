<D>__{chieko walks down the street with mitsu. they are good looking and attract attention. they know this and look back out of the corners of their eyes.}
<L>__{exterior park, tokyo day}
<D>__{they arrive at a park with a playground: swings, see saws, slides. several of their deaf mute volleyball friends are there. with them are two young men with hair dyed blond. one of them, takeshi (18), has an earring, and the other, haruki}
<P>__{(19), has several tattoos.}
<D>__{mitsu and chieko greet them in sign language. chieko asks the slightly chubby kumiko who they are.}
<C>__{kumiko}
<D>__{they're my cousins. chieko turns to look at them, curious. haruki, the guy with tattoos, exchanges a look with her. chieko suddenly feels intimidated and looks down.}
<C>__{chieko}
<D>__{is he deaf mute like us?}
<C>__{kumiko}
<D>__{no, but he understands some. haruki seems to understand what they're saying and leans in to whisper something to takeshi, his brother. they both laugh. haruki approaches chieko and talks to her face to face so she can read his lips.}
<C>__{haruki}
<D>__{what's your name? chieko and her friend smile. chieko takes out her notebook and pen and writes her name. haruki reads it out loud.}
<C>__{haruki }
<D>__{chieko? chieko nods.}
<C>__{haruki }
<D>__{my name's haruki. chieko nods, trying to show she's understood. haruki takes out a flask and holds it out to her. chieko opens it and smells it. haruki stands in front of her.}
<C>__{haruki }
<D>__{it's whisky. chieko smiles and gives a long swig. mitsu asks for some and also gives it a long drink.}
<C>__{haruki }
<D>__{do the cops come around here?}
<C>__{mitsu}
<P>__{(gutturally)}
<D>__{sometimes. haruki takes out some ecstasy and gives it to them. mitsu and chieko look at each other and down the pills with a gulp of whisky.}
