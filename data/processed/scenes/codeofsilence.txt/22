<L>__{interior painter's apartment day}
<A>__{the painters are not what they seem. working quickly, silently, they open their tool kits and lay out their hardware: machine guns and automatics. tony luna, a barrel chested italian mobster is running the show and it's well rehearsed. his boys, gus, vito, and eenie move like oiled machinery. vito turns on a radio to a latino station to cover the sound of their preparations. they remove the whole window from its frame. then they rest a wide plank on the window ledge. three feet away is the window of the adjacent building and silhouetted against the shade we can see the drug deal. luna'ys check their weapons. they put on painters' masks and goggles.}
