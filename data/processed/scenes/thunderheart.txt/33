<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{the old man saw an owl. over there in the dry wash. last week.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{and...}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{he saw an owl.}
<A>__{a silent moment. ray tries to figure out what he's missing here.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{so what?}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{the owl is a messenger. when one shows itself to a sioux... it means someone's gonna die. the owl told him about leo.}
<A>__{ray stares vacantly.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{the owl told him about leo. that's incredible. i guess we just broke the back of this investigation, didn't we? evidence doesn't get any harder than that not for my money. is there anyway we can seduce this owl into federal court?}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{he also said "listen to the water."}

<D>__{listen to the water. listen to the owl. he also said, don't trust the fucking cookie monster.}
<C>__{crow horse}
<D>__{go back to your dna finger printin'.}
<A>__{crow horse kick starts his bike and burns off down the drive ray feels the presence of the old man, standing behind the busted screen door. just watching. over this, a screaming. a high pitched, chilling, scream that takes us straight into slack tail powwow grounds res later close on a terrifying face painted in blazing red and yellow, black around the eyes. a ridge of feathers high along the hairline, and a mouth open, tongue trilling screaming.}
<B>__{a wacipi}
<A>__{is going down. a powow. held in the center of a huge arbor. this dancer, a traditional kit fox dancer, is dressed in authentic costume and is dancing with ten others dressed in various traditional garb and paints. under the arbor, two hundred indians in modern clothing sit on blankets or in lawn chairs, watching the dancing. a group of singers sit around a big drum, beating on it, and wailing the song that keeps the dancers hopping. sixty cars (res beaters) are parked off around the arbor, less interested kids sitting on them, smoking cigarettes. a few actually have mtv hair cuts. drifting through the cars and people are special agents couture, miles, sherman and levoi. they stroll through, incongruously, checking out faces. vehicles. ray slows his step and takes in }
<B>__{the powwow circle}
<A>__{as the dance ends. weak applause. the powwow caller, a big sioux with a crew cut and cowboy shirt, speaks through a scratchy p.a. system.}
<C>__{caller}
<D>__{was te yelo! let's have five more veterans. five more veterans. hoka hey!}
<A>__{an old indian man sitting in a lawn chair, removes his cowboy hat and reaches down toward a blanket. he brings up his vfw hat, adorned with medals and puts it on. slowly, he rises, and shuffles out to the center pole along with four other veterans who have exchanged cowboy hats for veteran's caps. there is even a traditional dancer in there, wearing a veteran cap. as a mournful war song is banged out by the singers, a flag is unrolled by the veterans. an american flag. unrolled, and set on the mast. and together, all five indian men, hoist }
<B>__{the american flag}
<A>__{high. slowly it climbs. proudly. it blows in the hot south dakota wind.}
<B>__{outside the arbor}
<A>__{ray stands, watching this. and then the song ends. a loud, angry voice breaks across the p.a. at the crow's nest (caller's booth) anderson chasing hawk, a young indian in ribbon shirt and long hair has taken possession of the microphone. six w.a.r.n. members stand behind him. he speaks loud, firm, with the sharp gestures of an old way chief.}
<C>__{chasing hawk}
<D>__{what is that that you honor there, uncles? after all the wasi'cu country has done to you, after all he still does to you, you honor that flag?! that flag has been desecrated by the united states, because they have not honored what that flag represents!}
<A>__{the veterans just stand under the flag, solemn, looking at chasing hawk. the flag undulates soundlessly.}
<C>__{chasing hawk }
<D>__{to them, we are the bank of america. whenever they get into a little difficulty, they go to the bank, withdraw a little land, withdraw a little oil }
<B>__{outside the arbor}
<A>__{the four fbi agents stand, watching.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{okay. here we go.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{who's this guy?}
<C>__{sherman}
<D>__{anderson chasing hawk. second in command behind jimmy.}
<A>__{at the crow's nest chasing hawk hands the mic over to another warrior. maggie eagle bear would be the most beautiful woman ray has even seen if she was not the meanest looking. her thick black hair falls over a denim jacket down below her horse hair belt. her faded jeans are stuffed into worn cowboy boots. and she is full of fire. she begins speaking in lakota. fluently. and with hand sign, like the old man.}
<B>__{outside the arbor}
<A>__{the agents stand. cooch is writing into a small notebook.}
<C>__{sherman}
<D>__{magedelana eagle bear. eagle's claws and a bear's balls.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{she keeps an ar 15 assault rifle in her truck. and she'll use it.}
<A>__{as ray watches her, someone approaches in a less hostile manner. it is president clear moon, looking very upset. he holds the hand of a little girl, dressed in traditional dancing garb. he approaches ray.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{mr. clear moon.}
<C>__{clear moon}
<D>__{our police are afraid of them. please get them out of here.}
<A>__{clear moon gestures for the little girl to run off. he leans in close to ray.}
<C>__{clear moon}
<D>__{they're going to kill me nexterior that's what i hear. these new indians are destroying everything. our people are a quiet people.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{they can lead us to jimmy. just let them go. we're tightening the net on him. we know he's on the reservation.}
<A>__{clear moon is looking past ray at the warriors. they are approaching the agents, and clear moon looks at ray with great concern.}
<C>__{clear moon}
<D>__{help us.}
<A>__{and he slowly retreats to his lawn chair under the arbor. chasing hawk, maggie and the other warriors strut up to the agents. all but one who is bound to a wheelchair. we've seen richard yellow bird, the big cheyenne who wears a red power baseball cap, an earring, and thick bifocals in one of the file photos. his arms are plastered with tattoos.}
<C>__{agent sherman}
<D>__{where's jimmy? we thought he'd be dancing today.}
<A>__{the warriors make a show of not acknowledging the fbi presence. they have walked over here just to walk by them. that is there statement. but yellow bird stops cranking the wheels of his chair and stop: long enough to look up at ray.}
<C>__{yellow bird}
<D>__{are you the washington redskin?}
<A>__{even the agents crack grins at this bit of indian wit. all but ray who just stands there, arms folded across his chest, considering the crippled activist.}
<C>__{agent miles}
<D>__{say hello to richard yellow bird, ray.}
<A>__{yellow bird sits there, staring up at him through thick glasses but then maggie eagle bear takes the handles of yellow bird's wheel chair. she looks at ray with eyes that are choke cherry black, eyes that look right through him. he returns the glare. and then she pushes yellowbird forward and leaves the feds alone. ray turns to cooch who is lighting a cigarette, and concentrating on the movements of this group as they wander under the arbor, visiting people. lakota singers start up.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{ray, get to jimmy's place and keep it tight. i'm gonna get a tail on his warriors.}
<B>__{in the powwow center}
<A>__{the under ten year old "fancy dance" twenty five indian children, whirling and stomping and dancing. jimmy looks twice house night the battered old house sits under a full moon. the upside down flag moves slightly in the cross winds.}
<B>__{across the road}
<A>__{several junked cars. among them a black, rusted out vw van with a smashed windshield. a pack of res dogs sniff at its tires.}
