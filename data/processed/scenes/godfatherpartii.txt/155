<A>__{the bar is fairly empty; and very dark. pentangeli and rosato step up to the bar; the bartender momentarily stops polishing glasses to pour a couple of drinks.}
<C>__{rosato}
<D>__{we were all real happy about your decision, frankie; you're not goin' to regret it.}
<A>__{he holds up the glass.}
<C>__{pentangeli}
<D>__{i don't like the c note. i take it like an insult.}
<A>__{suddenly, a garrote is thrown around pentangeli's throat; and he is forcefully yanked back into the shadows, all the way into a wooden telephone booth.}
<B>__{close view}
<A>__{the folded hundred dollar bill resting on the bar. med. close the phone booth we see only pentangeli's feet and legs, struggling. we hear the terrible sounds of a man being strangled.}

<A>__{calm, and then he sees something that disturbs him.}
<C>__{rosato}
<D>__{shit, your friend the cop!}
<A>__{suddenly, the side door opens, and a shaft of sunlight cuts through the darkness.}

<D>__{everything all right in there, ritchie? the door was open.}
