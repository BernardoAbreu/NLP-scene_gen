<L>__{interior warehouse night}
<A>__{west is trying to get dressed. as he pulls on one leg of his pants, a guard lunges at him with a knife. west hops up on one leg, smacks the guy with a mule kick. now he puts his arm through his shirt sleeve. when the hand emerges out of the cuff, it's balled in a fist which coldcocks the other guard.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{could i have a little privacy here?}
<A>__{as if in response, the water tower, still hovering above, now crashes to the floor obliterating his opponents.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{he calmly looks up in time to catch the falling, naked, screaming saloon girl in his arms.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{you'll have to excuse me, darlin'... but my evidence is getting away.}
<A>__{west gallantly puts her down, jumps up, grabs the overhead block and tackle system and slides through the warehouse. as the horse team, which has spooked, thunders past... closeup west sails onto the runaway wagon. as he pulls himself into the back, he gives the shivering saloon girl a tip of his hat now on his head.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{sorry about there not being any towels.}
