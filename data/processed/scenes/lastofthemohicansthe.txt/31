<A>__{on pointerior the trail cuts the side of a hill. the ground on one side rises into a forest acclivity and on the other falls off into a forested ravine. magua walking towards camera. closer magua's slid his tomahawk out from the front of his belt that girdles his waist. he lets the shaft drop into his hand. he shrugs off his blanket. there is a solidity to his dark, tall figure we didn't see before. magua turns about face and advances on the column. track with magua. heyward and the munro girls pass the camera as does sgt. major ambrose, marching in advance of the men. magua is approaching the soldier on the left in the first row. we see magua has caught the redcoat's eye.}
