<A>__{a small airstrip transects a meadow bounded by rain forested slopes. wreathed in low clouds the mountains march into the distance in increasingly subtler shades of gray like a japanese watercolor. near a cluster of small buildings the scene is one of manic but efficient activity as the high tech base camp is assembled. an enormous sikorsky ch 54 "sky crane" lowers a winnebago sized conex container as another roars by. an army corps of engineers work crew, stripped to the waist, scurries through the rotor wash. the blasting air raises curtains of muddy spray and drowns out the yelled commands of the supervisors. a vietnam era huey uh 1d helicopter nimbly touches down nearby. rambo, in the pilot's seat, slips off his headset and climbs down. brewer and trautman, in fatigues, jump out and join him as kirkhill approaches. dollying with them as they emerge from the rotor noise and kirkhill motions them toward the mobile tactical operations center (mtoc).}

<A>__{they pass a tent like camouflage canopy under which an all black sikorsky uh 60 "blackhawk" helicopter squats ominously. it has no markings or insignia. there is another canopy behind it, the contents of which are screened from view. nearby is a cluster of conex airlift containers, two of which are joined together to form a building like a double wide mobile home. another unit contains a roaring generator, a fourth is topped by tracking gear. cables snake through the mud, connecting the units. kirkhill notices three work party "grunts" kibitzing nearby, taking pictures of each other with a pocket instamatic. he snatches the camera from a surprised young corporal.}

<A>__{he opens the camera and drops the film in the mud. the corporal reaches petulantly for the camera. kirkhill drops it casually in the mud as well.}
