<L>__{interior fay's room night}
<A>__{moments later. simon comes upstairs and stops outside his bedroom door when he sees... fay, passed out drunk on her bed. her clothes are half off and her lipstick smeared. she still grips a bottle of tequila in her hand. simon hesitates, but then goes in and removes her shoes. he gets her out of her jacket and rolls her into the bed. her bare limbs have their effect on simon and he finds himself staring at her thigh. he reaches out and almost caresses her leg where her hiked up skirt reveals the bottom of her behind. he catches himself, snaps his hand away and covers fay with a blanket. he flees.}
