<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{hub's apartment dawn a ringing phone. hub wakes up in a tangle of sheets. he looks around and realizes he is alone. did last night even happen?}
<C>__{hub}
<P>__{(on the phone)}
<D>__{hubbard... what ? ...slow down, slow down }
<A>__{he reaches for the remote control, turns on the tv.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{a grinding of treads on asphalt dawn as the first apc enters brooklyn. followed by another. and another. and in a sound bite: general devereaux, in fatigues for the first time, and looking like grim death.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{today, with the invocation of the war powers act by the president, i am declaring a state of martial law in this city.}
<B>__{the battle of brooklyn has begun}
<A>__{road blocks set up at select intersections. random stop and frisk. patrols of young soldiers in the streets. gang kids, same age, same color, eye them warily.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{to the best of our knowledge, we are opposed by no more than twenty of the enemy. he is hiding among a population of roughly two million.}
<B>__{the brooklyn bridge}
<A>__{is closed. soldiers in full battle dress stop cars, check trunks, handbags, briefcases, and id's. the line of honking, angry motorists stretches as far as the eye can see.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{intelligence tells us he is most likely arab speaking, between the age of fourteen and thirty. narrowing the target to fifteen thousand suspects.}
<A>__{a swarthy teenager is pulled from a car by a sergeant and led away to a camouflaged tent set up on the bridge.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{we can further reduce that number down to those who have been in this country less than six months. now you have twenty hiding among two thousand.}
<A>__{a car trunk is inspected. two women waved through.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{if you are one of these twenty young men, you can hide among a population of similar ethnic background. unfortunately for you, you can only hide there. and that population, in the classic immigration pattern, is concentrated. right here in brooklyn.}
<A>__{hub and sharon stare at the orwellian tableau.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{we intend to seal off this borough. and then we intend to squeeze it. this is the land of opportunity, gentlemen. the opportunity to turn yourselves in. after sundown tonight any young man fitting the profile i described who has not cooperated will be arrested and detained.}
<A>__{hub and sharon show their id's to an mp.}
<C>__{mp}
<D>__{would you follow me, please. the general is expecting you.}
<A>__{he leads him to a camouflaged tent on the service roadway.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{there is historically nothing more corrosive to the morale of an army than policing its own citizens.}
<B>__{in the tent}
<A>__{the swarthy teenager is being interrogated by col. hardwick.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{but the enemy would be sadly mistaken if they were to doubt our resolve. they are now face to face with the most fearsome killing machine in the history of man. and i intend to use it. and be back on base in time for the play offs... that is all.}
<A>__{devereaux sees hub and strides over to him:}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{hub. good to see you again.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{i can't say the same, sir. not in that uniform. i thought you were against this.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{i am against it. it wasn't my call.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{"i'm only following orders" didn't work at nuremberg. it may not be your policy but they're your tactics.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{your operation had its chance, hub, and you couldn't get it done. you're down three touchdowns. time to bring in the first string.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{against our own team?}
<A>__{devereaux suddenly goes ice cold.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{are you questioning my patriotism?}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{i'm questioning your judgement, yes, sir.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{hub, i want you to take a moment and reflect on my life as a soldier. i have a dozen tropical diseases i will never entirely get rid of. i set off metal detectors with the shrapnel in my ass. i have watched men die and i have killed. now i am serving my president and quite possibly not the best interests of my country, but my profession doesn't afford me the luxury of that distinction. i won't question your patriotism but don't you ever again question my command.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{i'm not under your command, general.}
<C>__{devereaux}
<D>__{take a good look around, my friend, and tell me that's still true.}
<P>__{(softening his tone)}
<D>__{but we're not shutting you out. in fact, i can't do it without you, hub. i need men like you. men willing to put it on the line like you did in that schoolroom.}
<P>__{(gestures to his uniform)}
<D>__{these stars mean i have been putting it on the line for thirty years... and never made a mistake worth remembering. don't tell me i made a mistake about you.}
<A>__{on the bridge moments later hub and sharon exit the command tent.}
<C>__{hub}
<P>__{(ironic)}
<D>__{they're not shutting us out. they need men like me.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{he'll fuck it up, the arrogant prick. you ever met anybody so in love with the sound of his own voice?}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{we're putting samir in play.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{now? with all this going on? he's freaked.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{oh, right, he's high strung. only you can manage him. you and the cia and the dia and god knows who else you're really working for !}
<P>__{(seething)}
<D>__{get back in there, sharon, elise, whatever the fuck your name is they'll probably make you a colonel... if you're not one already.}
<A>__{she gestures at the military leviathan.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{all this... is no more in our interest than it is in yours, hub.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{what, exactly, are your interests, sharon? you protect samir, you protect the agency. you're interested in protecting everything but your country.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{you have no idea what i do for my country.}
<C>__{hub}
<D>__{no, and i don't want to know. with you or without you we're putting samir in play. now.}
<A>__{she looks at him for a long moment. considering:}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{one more lamb to the slaughter.}
