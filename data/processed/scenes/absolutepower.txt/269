<D>__{glad for the talk, wish we'd had more.}
<A>__{luther crosses to the door, turns.}
<C>__{luther}
<D>__{this is probably it; you understand that.}
<P>__{(as she does, he still looks at her. then )}
<D>__{i was never going to tell you this, but i watched you argue a case last year thank god you got your brains from your mother.}
