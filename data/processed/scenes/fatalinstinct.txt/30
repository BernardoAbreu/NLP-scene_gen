<L>__{interior le hot club night}
<A>__{it's dark, seductive, smoky, crowded... and hot. everybody is dripping with sweat and holding unlit cigarettes. ned enters, sees lola sitting on a stool at the bar, one leg crossed provocatively over the other. a beer can is stuck to the gum on the bottom of her shoe. it falls off with a clunk. he sits on the stool next to her. she looks at him, smiles.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{oh yeah, before i forget... you asked me to take care of this.}
<A>__{he reaches into his jacket pocket, pulls out a lit cigarette. it has a very long ash.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{thanks...}
<A>__{she takes it... inhales a drag, then lets the smoke flow out through her smile. it flows out for a loooooooooong time! more smoke than she could ever have inhaled. then...}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{you smoke too much.}
<P>__{(looks around, then)}
<D>__{it's hot tonight.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{is it? i never know. my body heat runs about twenty degrees above normal.}
<A>__{he notices the drink in her hand is boiling. a saxophone begins to softly wail lola's theme. ned looks over to see a quartet, featuring dizzy on sax. the guitarist spontaneously bursts into flame! a fireman, in full gear, jumps up from the bar and puts out the blaze with a fire extinguisher. none of the band members miss a beat.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{maybe we should look for a cooler place.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{i doubt we'll find one. even the wind chimes on my porch aren't moving much these days. they keep thudding softly, like dairy cows bumping butts in the night. i go out there expecting to find a cool breeze... but it's just a lot of hot air.}
<A>__{ned glances at the male customers... sitting at the bar across from them. they're staring coldly at ned.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{what're they lookin' at?}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{a lot of them have tried that seat. you're the first one's lasted this long.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i feel honored.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{don't. it's broken.}
<A>__{a beat of realization, then the stool collapses with a crash! ned pulls himself back up and drags another stool over.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{did you bring the... papers?}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{no. i thought you might come over...}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{sure. i will drive you.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{i brought my own car.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i will follow you then.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{i know it sounds silly, but would you leave first... wait in your car? i come here a lot and i wouldn't want those men to think i'm "easy"... a slut who'll jump into bed with anyone at the drop of a hat. but if you leave first...}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{...they'll think i'm a putz for passing up a sure thing.}
<A>__{lola stares at ned for a long moment... then slaps his face. he doesn't move, remaining staunchly macho. then, suddenly, she slugs him so hard it knocks him over the top of the bar!}
<C>__{lola}
<P>__{(for all to hear)}
<D>__{now leave me alone!}
<A>__{she pauses to give him a flicker of a coy smile... then picks up her drink and moves to a nearby table. ned struggles to his feet and staggers to the door.}
