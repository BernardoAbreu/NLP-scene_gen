<L>__{exterior hotel swimming pool (miami) day}
<A>__{laura macnamara, a pretty and charming tv news correspondent, is on the air live, surrounded by her camera crew. kids are frolicking in the pool, splashing off the water slide behind her.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{so judging from the mob scene around the pool here today, i think you'd have to say that there's nothing 'off' about the 'off season' in miami beach this summer. now, on a personal note, this is my last report for w.v.b.f. i'm getting married to a wonderful man and moving to new york, so if you're up that way, watch for me on the w.p.i.x. news team. thanks for everything, miami.}
<P>__{(voice catching slightly)}
<D>__{for the last time, this is laura macnamara, w.v.b.f. news.}
<A>__{she pulls a bouquet out from behind her back and tosses it to the camera.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{catch!}
<A>__{she smiles for a long beat.}
<C>__{producer}
<D>__{we're clear.}
<A>__{laura's smile abruptly disappears.}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(to the crew, all business)}
<D>__{i will do the re asks, then you guys can just shoot the inserts and pack it up.}
<P>__{(looks off)}
<D>__{ben!}
<A>__{laura runs to ben, standing on the sidelines, and embraces him. michael is there too.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{this is him, everyone! this is the guy!}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(to the crew)}
<D>__{hi, everybody.}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(as she hugs him)}
<D>__{oh, i missed you.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i missed you too. michael, say hello.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{hi, laura.}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(a little too big)}
<D>__{this is michael? i don't think so. if i remember correctly, michael was a little boy, and this, this is a great big kid. hey, you. tell us what you did with michael sobol.}
<A>__{ben and michael look at each other out of the corners of their eyes.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{okay. come on. give me a break. i'm trying.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no, it was nice, but i'm fourteen so it wasn't you know age appropriate.}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(smiles appreciatively)}
<D>__{sorry. just smack me if i do that again.}
<P>__{(hugs him)}
<D>__{how are you, michael?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{great.}
<A>__{there is an awkward silent moment, everyone smiling uncomfortably.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{mike, you want to go look at the camera?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{why would i want to look at the camera?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{'cause i bet there's all kinds of cool video stuff over there. why don't you check it out?}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(gets the hint)}
<D>__{oh, yeah.}
<P>__{(to laura)}
<D>__{is it okay?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{go ahead. if you break something, don't worry. i'm out of here.}
<A>__{michael crosses to the camera crew.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you think he likes me?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{michael? he's crazy about you. i am too.}
<A>__{they embrace.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you are? and you still really want to get married?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{but what if you get tired of me? i know so many couples that were really happy, then they got married and just completely lost interest in each other.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{that's not going to be us.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i just don't want to lose the passion.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{yes, i'm brimming with passion. i'm up to here with passion.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i want us to be like animals. you know just screaming and sweating and tearing at each other all the time }
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{the sweating shouldn't be a problem. the tearing sounds painful.}
<A>__{the sound guy crosses over.}
<C>__{sound guy}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{uhh, laura? you want me to take your mic, or at least turn it off?}
<A>__{laura looks over at the crew. it's obvious that michael and the crew have heard this whole exchange.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<A>__{& &}
