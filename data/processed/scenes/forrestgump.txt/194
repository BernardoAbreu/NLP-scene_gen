<A>__{forrest jr. looks over and waves to his father. forrest nods approvingly. forrest jr. gets on the bus. the bus pulls away. forrest stands next to the mailbox. forrest sits down. the camera cranes down, revealing the feather as it lies at forrest's feet. a gust of wind picks the feather up. the feather floats up into the air. forrest sits at the side of the road. the feather floats higher into the air. the feather soars up into the sky and travels up and down, then covers the camera lens.}
