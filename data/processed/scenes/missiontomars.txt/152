<A>__{following the martian, they find themselves in a round, open space, defined by light, with a smooth matte metallic floor, but without apparent walls. the martian stops, turns, facing them. the astronauts stop, too, uncertain what they're meant to do. then the martian gestures again. a cylindrical holographic column appears, rising from the floor in front of the astronauts. inside it, a swirl of eerie lights, millions of them, like cosmic fireflies... mcconnell, luke, and terri set down their helmets, then cautiously converge around this column, forming a loose triangle. as they stare into it, the myriad lights are reflected off their own eyes and their spacesuits.}
