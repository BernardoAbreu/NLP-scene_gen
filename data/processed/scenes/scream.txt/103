<A>__{sidney races to where the van lay on it's side. sidney peers through the windshield...gale's body lay limp and bloody. sidney cries out, turning, limping to the driveway. she sees the patrol jeep with it's open door...she goes for it.}
<L>__{interior jeep}
<A>__{sidney hops in, reaches for the ignition...no keys! shit. just then, sidney's eyes go to the front porch. she watches as the front door opens and a figure appears in the darkness, undetectable. sidney throws the headlights...illuminating the front side of the house, revealing...}

<D>__{dewey!}

<D>__{noooooooo!!!!!}
<A>__{sid jumps back inside the jeep, closing the door, locking it. she reaches over and locks the passenger's door and then she...waits. and watches as the ghost leans over dewey's still body, fumbling with something. then the figure stands upright, in his hands he holds...}
<B>__{the keys}
<A>__{they jingle in the wind, the ghost toying with her, enjoying this... sidney, hysterical, locks eyes with the figure as he moves to the door, sidney leaps on it, holding the lock button down, making it impossible to unlock. her face is pressed against the glass...inches from the masked figure. she uses every ounce of strength when suddenly, the ghost disappears, dropping down, below the window, out of her view. sidney moves to the center of the jeep, trying hard to listen over her own rapid breathing, every sound amplified. then she hears it, the soft jingling of keys near the passengers side door. she pounces on the lock, holding it down. a shadow cuts the beam of the headlights, unseen by sidney. the lock turns on the other side. sidney leaps over and holds it down, securing it. this is beyond nerve racking. sidney is certifiable. her eyes spot the police radio for the first time. she grabs the mouthpiece and hits the switch.}
