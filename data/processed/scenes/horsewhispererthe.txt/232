<L>__{interior creek house morning}
<A>__{annie awakens in bed and discovers she is alone. she looks around for tom. she rises and enters the other room to discover: all her boxes and all her luggage have been removed. her heart sinks. tom re enters, fully dressed, to get the last box. he sees on her face a look of confusion and hurt.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i figured, whenever you decided to go, you'd be all set.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(curt)}
<D>__{how thoughtful of you. and what if i decide not to go?}
<A>__{tom doesn't know how to respond. he looks away and bends down to reach for the box when annie commands:}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{leave me alone!}
<A>__{beat. they stand awkwardly for a moment, until;}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(pleadingly)}
<D>__{annie, please...}
<A>__{tom reaches to embrace her, but annie attacks him. punching his chest... pulling at his shirt as tom tries to put his arms around her...}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{no!... no!... you don't decide this!... no!...}
<A>__{tom's heart is breaking as he manages to get his arms around her and hold her... as she breaks down and softly, the rage passes... annie speaks softly.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(struggling)}
<D>__{i don't know any other way, annie.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(more adamant)}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{suddenly;}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you think this is easy for me!?}
<A>__{annie is struck by the powerful sincerity of his words;}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{it's just happened this way sometimes. i can't explain it. but i look at you and see grace and i see robert, and no matter what you decide about him, i just know this is right. your life isn't here and you know it.}
<A>__{annie looks into his eyes and asks, softly defiant;}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{then what have we been doing? i mean what was the point?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(confused by her question)}
<D>__{the point was to love each other.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{as if there has to be a result... tom looks at her and says with an almost innocent conviction:}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{because we had to... and i will never stop loving you, annie. here. where my life is.}
<A>__{the simplicity, and truth, of it hits annie strongly. annie releases herself from him and turns away... despondent. realizing the utter truth and inevitability of what he says. she starts shaking her head. tom can't hear it... he reaches for her;}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{annie...}
<A>__{she turns back into his arms and they kiss passionately... holding each other... as if for the last time.}
