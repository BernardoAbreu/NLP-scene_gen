<A>__{your wife always used to say you'd be late for your own funeral. remember that? her little joke because you were such a slob always late, always forgetting stuff, even before the incident. right about now you're probably wondering if you were late for hers. you were there, you can be sure of that. that's what the picture's for the one tacked to the wall by the door. it's not customary to take pictures at a funeral, but somebody, your doctors, i guess, knew you wouldn't remember. they had it blown up nice and big and stuck it right there, next to the door, so you couldn't help but see it every time you got up to find out where she was. the guy in the picture, the one with the flowers? that's you. and what are you doing? you're reading the headstone, trying to figure out who's funeral you're at, same as you're reading it now, trying to figure why someone stuck that picture next to your door. but why bother reading something that you won't remember? she's gone, gone for good, and you must be hurting right now, hearing the news. believe me, i know how you feel. you're probably a wreck. but give it five minutes, maybe ten. maybe you can even go a whole half hour before you forget. but you will forget i guarantee it. a few more minutes and you'll be heading for the door, looking for her all over again, breaking down when you find the picture. how many times do you have to hear the news before some other part of your body, other than that busted brain of yours, starts to remember? never ending grief, never ending anger. useless without direction. maybe you can't understand what's happened. can't say i really understand, either. backwards amnesia. that's what the sign says. crs disease. your guess is as good as mine. maybe you can't understand what happened to you. but you do remember what happened to her, don't you? the doctors don't want to talk about it. they won't answer my questions. they don't think it's right for a man in your condition to hear about those things. but you remember enough, don't you? you remember his face. this is why i'm writing to you. futile, maybe. i don't know how many times you'll have to read this before you listen to me. i don't even know how long you've been locked up in this room already. neither do you. but your advantage in forgetting is that you'll forget to write yourself off as a lost cause. sooner or later you'll want to do something about it. and when you do, you'll just have to trust me, because i'm the only one who can help you.}
<A>__{earl opens one eye after another to a stretch of white ceiling tiles interrupted by a hand printed sign taped right above his head, large enough for him to read from the bed. an alarm clock is ringing somewhere. he reads the sign, blinks,reads it again, then takes a look at the room. it's a white room, overwhelmingly white, from the walls and the curtains to the institutional furniture and the bedspread. the alarm clock is ringing from the white desk under the window with the white curtains. at this point earl probably notices that he is lying on top of his white comforter. he is already wearing a dressing gown and slippers. he lies back and reads the sign taped to the ceiling again. it says, in crude block capitals, this is your room. this is a room in a}
<B>__{hospital. this is where you live now.}
<A>__{earl rises and takes a look around. the room is large for a hospital empty linoleum stretches out from the bed in three directions. two doors and a window. the view isn't very helpful, either a close of trees in the center of a carefully manicured piece of turf that terminates in a sliver of two lane blacktop. the trees, except for the evergreens, are bare early spring or late fall, one or the other. every inch of the desk is covered with post it notes, legal pads, neatly printed lists, psychological textbooks, framed pictures. on top of the mess is a half completed crossword puzzle. the alarm clock is riding a pile of folded newspapers. earl slaps the snooze button and takes a cigarette from the pack taped to the sleeve of his dressing gown. he pats the empty pockets of his pajamas for a light. he rifles the papers on the desk, looks quickly through the drawers. eventually he finds a box of kitchen matches taped to the wall next to the window. another sign is taped just above the box. it says in loud yellow letters, cigarette? check for lit ones first, stupid. earl laughs at the sign, lights his cigarette, and takes a long draw. taped to the window in front of him is another piece of looseleaf paper headed your schedule. it charts off the hours, every hour, in blocks: 10:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. is labeled go back to sleep. earl consults the alarm clock: 8:15. given the light outside, it must be morning. he checks his watch:}
