<L>__{interior ballroom night}
<A>__{lights and music and laughter. they're in black tie tonight. it's a wedding party. up on the stage, at the head table, some guy is finishing a toast, and as everyone roars and claps...}
<C>__{best man}
<D>__{...so to the bride! thank god she's more than he deserves!}
<A>__{everybody shouts the bride. everybody drinks champagne. and the bride stands up. in her white gown. in her hand, an envelope. she goes to the mike, and waits for the raucous cheers, the calls of speech!, to die down. leans to the mike. flushed and happy. and, oddly, nervous.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{now i know the tradition, so this isn't a toast. at least... not for me.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{the guest list is 114. but we all know there's one more here, tonight. because...}
<A>__{looks down the table at her children. dressed to kill. enjoying the party.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{...my two sidekicks there always bring her along. wherever they go.}
<A>__{right? right.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{so jackie and i were sitting around. on new year's eve. and she said, 'you're not gonna talk at my funeral, are you?'}
<A>__{and now. it is quiet indeed.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{and i said, 'i've never been to a funeral. i'm not sure i will know how to act...'}
<A>__{her sweet smile. keeps the mood right.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{'...but i will prob'ly sneak into where you are. just before it's over...'}
<A>__{nods to herself. fights back the feeling of that moment.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{'...say something. just to you. get the last word in, when you can't talk back.'}
<A>__{there is laughter in this room. gentle, loving.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{so she says, 'no way.'}
<A>__{holds up the envelope. holds it tight.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{she wrote this. she sealed it up, i didn't see it. she made me promise to read it. at the wedding.}
<A>__{and slowly, luke begins to clap. and others join. and when it stops...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i told her she'd better make it dirty, or make it funny. because... no way...on my wedding...}
<A>__{no way in hell.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{...could she make me cry.}
<A>__{applause. they are loving it.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{she says, 'it's a deal'.}
<A>__{the band plays an impromptu flourish. rachel begins to carefully tear open the envelope...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{now, if it's too raunchy, we may have to excuse the kids...}
<A>__{shouts from everyone, especially the children. she has it open. she looks at it. and everything. stops. the world watches her sway, watches her eyes fill as she stares at the small card in her hand. she can't believe this...}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(mouths to herself)}
<D>__{you promised.}
<A>__{the tears are welling. everyone screams for her to read it. she leans to the mike, shaking her head...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{it's...no big thing, really... it's just...five words, it's...}
<A>__{the place goes happily up for grabs. a joyful riot of demand. tears streaming now, rachel fumbles to pull up her white beaded bag. as she puts the card inside, we alone can read the words...}
<B>__{my babies. are so lucky.}
<A>__{hold on this. and...}
