<L>__{exterior very narrow alley night}
<A>__{just inches of clearance on either side, the alley runs behind a series of strip malls and office buildings. there's only one way out simon's aiming for the boulevard on the far side.}
<C>__{singh}
<P>__{(looking out back)}
<D>__{i don't see `em.}
<B>__{up ahead}
<A>__{the end of the alley approaches. from the far edge, a flashing orange light. a giant street sweeper is slowly crossing the alley. we whip back to see the cadillac approaching.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{shit.}
<C>__{singh}
<P>__{(looking back)}
<D>__{wait, no. they're coming in.}
<A>__{behind them, the ram charger gingerly negotiates a three point turn into the alley. wider, it scrapes against one side. ahead, the street sweeper is blocking one quarter of the alley. one third. a moment of hesitation, then simon floors it. the caddy hits thirty, forty. engine racing }
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{we can't make it!}
<A>__{the sweeper is already halfway across the alley. singh braces for impact. somehow, simon still thinks he can clear it.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{stop!}
<A>__{at the last moment, simon slams on the brakes. they're skidding towards it. marcus grabs the wheel and jerks it. the front bumper catches the wall, sending the trunk slamming against the far alley wall. a ear piercing screech. a ribbon of sparks shoots off as the front and rear bumpers are scraped away. forward momentum finally stops.}
