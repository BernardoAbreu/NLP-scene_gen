<L>__{exterior hospital next morning}
<A>__{sam, holding the baby, and becca, having just checked out, walk down the steps of the hospital holding their complimentary plastic baby bag. sam is nervous haling the precious cargo and becca is agitated. they see the bus pulling up and down the street and sam moves quickly so they can hurry and catch it. as he approaches the bus, he looks to becca by his side, but she is not there. he looks around and no sign of her. frantically turning in a full circle, he sees the fabric of her dress disappearing into the crowd down the street. he screams.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{becca! becca!}

<D>__{oh my, oh my, oh my. quite a bit of business.}
<A>__{he rushes over to the kitchen counter and unsnaps the baby's pajamas, revealing a cloth diaper held together with promotional buttons: one says "hertz, #1 for car rentals", the other a picture of magic johnson and reads "go, lakers, go!" sam undoes it.}

<A>__{we follow her through the dark house as she creeps down the stairs. she gets to the front door. it's been dead bolted where she cannot reach it. from the darkness we hear }

<P>__{(tenderly)}
<D>__{lucy. come here.}
<A>__{randy sits in the darkness, next to a third of a glass of milk and a half a denny's blueberry muffin.}

<D>__{i made us a midnight snack.}
<A>__{lucy stares at the muffin and milk. torn.}
<C>__{randy }
<D>__{i understand that you want to see your daddy. and i don't want to keep you from him. i honestly don't. so you tell me when you want to see him. you can see him anytime you want. but we have to arrange it first. do you understand?}
<P>__{(lucy nods)}
<D>__{now would you like a snack?}
<A>__{lucy nods. elated, randy makes room for her on the couch. but lucy just reaches for the milk and muffin and heads up the stairs then turns back and speaks gently to randy.}

<D>__{thank you. goodnight.}
<C>__{randy}
<P>__{(words caught in her throat)}
<D>__{goodnight, lucy.}

<C>__{sam}
<D>__{them first, then me. they're a nice couple. they have a nice house. she's pretty. she's smart, too. i can tell. the manager of the salad bar is gonna testify, isn't he? that will help us.}
<A>__{for a moment, rita's mask drops and her fear for sam overwhelms her.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{nobody believed that george harrison could really be a song writer. but he wrote "here comes the sun". john and paul said it was one of the best songs on abbey road.}

<D>__{now. i want to see him now.}
<L>__{interior sam's bedroom 3:30 a.m.}
<A>__{we see sam sleeping in bed. there's a knock at the door. sam wakes with a start, throws down the covers. we see that he's wearing the armani suit. sam opens the door to see randy standing there, holding a sleeping lucy in her arms.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{she fell asleep on the car ride over. i was gonna turn back and tuck her in to her bed...with the pink canopy...and the quilt i made...but i was afraid she'd wake up at our house...}

<D>__{...and want to come home.}
<A>__{sam looks at randy with profound compassion.}
<C>__{randy }

<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i hope i hope i hope that you're saying what i think you're saying even though you're not saying it.}
<A>__{randy nods and hands the sleeping lucy into sam's strong arms. for a moment they both hold lucy between them in the most unique embrace. randy finally lets go and struggles to say goodbye.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{goodnight. i will see you in court. save me a seat...on your side.}
<A>__{randy walks away. stunned, sam watches her, holding lucy in his arms. then, from a very brave place:}

<C>__{sam}
<D>__{penalty! rules broken. penalty, please!}
<A>__{sam, wearing a uniform and whistle around his neck, walking his inimitable walk, races up the field, coaching the team. ifty, robert and brad sit in the bleachers. robert, in sunglasses, paranoid, looking behind him. brad follows around an attractive young woman as close as he can get to her. sam runs by the water stand, manned by randy and bill. they share a look a moment of intense parental pride. lucy and a kid named phillip go after the ball.}
<C>__{obnoxious mom}
<D>__{get her! phillip, you get her!}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{i saw that! you gave him a secret signal! didn't you?}

<A>__{it's rita! with danny hollering from the stands.}
<B>__{on lucy}
<A>__{looks over at her father. sam does every coaching gesture, and referee hand signal from every sport known to man. it looks like a bizarre twyla tharp dance.}
<B>__{on lucy}
<A>__{she does it right back at him. their secret code. the code that will bind them for the rest of their lives.}
<B>__{on the crowd and players}
<A>__{all watching. what the hell was that? sam blows his whistle.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{play ball! play ball!}
<A>__{the game heats up. lucy's team gets the ball and is headed toward the goal. sam is running right alongside them, so excited, until he can't hold himself back anymore and intercepts the ball! sam runs valiantly down the field with it! we hear "here comes the sun"... little darlin', it's been a long, cold lonely winter. little darlin', it feels like years since you've been here. here comes the sun...here comes the sun...and i say, "it's alright..." and the credits roll.}
