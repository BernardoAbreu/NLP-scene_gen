<A>__{the sky is just beginning to lighten over the dunes to the east, making dangerously obvious the thin column of smoke rising from the entrance to the well. omar and his men are peering through the smoke down into the well.}
<L>__{interior the well of the souls}
<A>__{indy and sallah are on the altar. pushing together with all their strength, the heavy stone top of the protective chest begins to slide away. indy and sallah exchange slightly wary but very excited looks, then continue to push. as the ark begins to be exposed, the air seems to almost vibrate, to become electrostatically charged. we hear what sounds like a low hum. the sea of snakes around the altar draws back further from this presence. as the top of the stone chest is pushed completely off and slams down beside it, we see the lost ark of the covenant. it is awesomely beautiful, breathtaking. 4 feet long, 2.5 feet wide and 2.5 feet high. it's height, however, is increased by the two sculptured gold angels mounted facing each other on the top. though the body of the ark is acacia wood, it has been overlaid with gold. an elaborate gold crown surrounds the top edge and gold carrying rings are attached to each corner. sallah is mesmerized by the sight. his hand starts to reach out and touch one of the angels, but indy grabs it.}

<D>__{don't touch it! never touch it!}
<A>__{the wooden crate stands open next to the stone chest. now indy extracts the wooden poles from its rings and begins fitting them through the rings in the ark. this takes some maneuvering by the two men, but soon they are able to lift the ark clear of the stone chest and into the wooden crate. they extract the poles, fasten the top of the crate and stick the poles through the rings of the wooden crate. they start back toward the space under the hole. the fire strips have begun to dwindle, as have some of the torches. the snakes move slowly in toward the clear spaces. indy and sallah eye them nervously as they hurry along with their heavy load. under the hole, they hurriedly attach ropes to the wooden crate and it is pulled up. indy's concentration is on the tide of snakes.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{hurry up! why did it have to be snakes?}
<A>__{sallah takes the next rope and climbs quickly out of the well. indy has picked up a torch and now throws it at a pool of snakes who are too close for his comfort. he turns and takes hold of the exit rope. he gives it a first tug and it falls down into the well, landing partly beyond the ring of fire where is instantly disappears in a tangle of angry, hissing asps. indy looks up at the hole.}

<A>__{smiling down at him from the perimeter of the entry are belloq, shliemann and gobler.}
<C>__{belloq}
<D>__{why, dr. jones, whatever are you doing in such a nasty place?}
<A>__{belloq and the germans laugh.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{why don't you fellows come down here? i will show you.}
