<D>__{and why's that?}
<A>__{mr. jolly's surprised: the answer's so obvious.}
<C>__{mr. jolly}
<P>__{(in a hoarse voice:)}
<D>__{niggers.}
<C>__{mrs. jolly}
<D>__{if he don't have to let some alabama coon come up to missouri, steal his chickens, and his job, he'd much prefer that.}
<A>__{seward takes the letter from mrs. jolly and hands it to lincoln.}
<C>__{seward}
<P>__{(to lincoln, quietly:)}
<D>__{the people! i begin to see why you're in such a great hurry to put it through.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<P>__{(to mr. jolly:)}
<D>__{would you let me study this letter, sir, about the tollbooth? come back to me in the morning and we'll consider what the law says.}
<A>__{lincoln stands.}
<C>__{lincoln }
<D>__{and be sure to visit "beanpole" and tell him that you support passage of the amendment. as a military necessity.}
<A>__{the jollys nod, skeptical now.}
<C>__{nicolay}
<P>__{(to the jollys:)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{nicolay escorts them out. before he closes the door:}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{oh, nicolay? when you have a moment.}
<A>__{nicolay nods and steps into the anteroom, where dozens more petitioners are waiting to speak with lincoln. hay confers with the doorman. seward closes the door behind them. lincoln kneels at the fireplace, stoking the fire. he puts more wood in, then stands. seward watches him, then:}
<C>__{seward}
<D>__{if procuring votes with offers of employment is what you intend, i will fetch a friend from albany who can supply the skulking men gifted at this kind of shady work. spare me the indignity of actually speaking to democrats. spare you the exposure and liability.}
<A>__{there is a sharp knock on the closed door, followed by two long ones.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{pardon me, that's a distress signal, which i am bound by solemn oath to respond to.}
<A>__{lincoln opens the door. tad enters, cross.}
<C>__{tad}
<D>__{tom pendel took away the glass camera plates of slaves mr. gardner sent over because tom says mama says they're too distressing, but }
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{you had nightmares all night, mama's right to }
<C>__{tad}
<D>__{but i will have worse nightmares if you don't let me look at the plates again!}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{perhaps.}
<C>__{seward}
<D>__{we can't afford a single defection from anyone in our party...not even a single republican absent when they vote. you know who you've got to see.}
<A>__{nicolay enters. lincoln turns to him.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{send over to blair house. ask preston blair can i call on him around five o'clock.}
<C>__{seward}
<P>__{(a shudder, a swallow of brandy:)}
