<L>__{interior kirk's quarters}
<A>__{after a long moment, the camera discovers kirk. he pours a drink, then decides not to have it. he sits wearily, not knowing how to shake the ghosts. then he sees the book. kirk picks up the battered volume, the gift from his friend, and closes his eyes a moment. almost idly he starts turning pages, looking for a clue. but he can't see the writing he rummages through his pockets and pulls out the half glasses one of the lenses is broken. it has a deep impact on kirk. he puts down the book and glasses and covers his eyes. a soft bong. kirk clears his throat.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{yes... come.}
<A>__{the door whooshes open and closes to admit david. the last person kirk expected to see.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i don't mean to intrude.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{uh, no...}
<P>__{(rises)}
<D>__{i should be on the bridge.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{are you running away from me?}
<A>__{david's strength is turning a corner with kirk }
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i suppose i was.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i poured a drink. would you like it?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{no. i i guess i'm not what you expected.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(rueful)}
<D>__{i didn't expect anything.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{that makes two of us.}
<P>__{(he studies his father)}
<D>__{lieutenant saavik was right: you never have faced death }
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(hoarse)}
<D>__{not like this no. i haven't faced death, i cheated death. i tricked my way out of death and patted myself on the back for my ingenuity. i know nothing.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you knew enough to tell saavik that how we face death is at least as important as how we face life }
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{it was just words.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{but good words. that's where ideas begin. maybe you should listen to them.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i'm trying, david.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{so am i. my friends were killed, too.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i am truly sorry.}
<A>__{pause. they study each other.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i was wrong about you. an i'm sorry.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{is that what you came here to say?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{mainly.}
<P>__{(he starts out, then turns )}
<D>__{and also that i'm proud very proud to be your son.}
<A>__{a stunned moment, then kirk lets it all hang out: for david, for carol and for spock. he hugs his son, hold ing onto him as if to life itself.}
