<L>__{interior basement night}
<A>__{max and welles enter through the double doors, into a kind of small, underground porn flea market. it's incredibly quiet. about fifteen card tables are set up in rows. the men behind the tables and the thirty or so "customers" looking through the merchandise make those in the previous porn shops look like high society. these are middle aged men, most balding, some with pot bellies, in shorts and tube socks, in sweatpants and members only jackets: plain men, but with a look of desperation in their eyes, glancing around nervously, greasy and afraid.}
<C>__{one dealer}
<D>__{we're shutting down in fifteen minutes. fifteen minutes.}
<A>__{welles makes his way to the tables, wary. one table is covered in dirty cardboard boxes, filled with hundreds of photos of young children, mostly boys, naked. each photo is wrapped in plastic, censored by masking tape. welles swallows back disgust. the next table is piled high with used pornographic magazines. there are baggies with colorful pills laid out. x rated polaroids wrapped in rubberbands. max follows behind, unaffected, smokes a cigarette. another table offers video tapes with no identifying marks other than hand written labels with numbers written out, "two," "sixteen," "five." and many bootleg videos with grainy, homemade labels showing women in extreme bondage. welles watches out the corner of his eye as the plump man beside him pays for a thick stack of kiddie porn pictures. welles waits till the man moves on, addresses the angry looking dealer who's counting money.}

<C>__{angry dealer}
<D>__{there ain't no such thing as snuff. why don't you fuck off?}
<A>__{the dealer sits and keeps counting cash. welles moves on beyond the tables there's a curtained doorway. welles walks to it, enters...}
<B>__{inside the curtain}
<A>__{folding chairs face a screen. a projector shows a silent movie; a buxom woman in nurses uniform prepares an enema bag and tube. a hairy, overweight man lays face down on an examination table, naked, arms tied behind his back. in the darkness, a man shifts in his chair, grunting, obviously masturbating. a few chairs away, a man is bent over, moving his head in the lap of someone in a blonde wig. a large man approaches welles from the dark.}
<C>__{large man}
<D>__{you have to pay to come in here.}
<A>__{welles backs away, shuts the curtain.}
