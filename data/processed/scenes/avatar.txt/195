<L>__{interior lock up night}
<A>__{jake, grace, and norm are in a common holding cell. they sit, staring in silence. too wired to sleep, too emotionally drained to move.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{they never wanted us to succeed.}
<A>__{at the desk outside, the lone trooper looks up as trudy approaches along the corridor, pushing a stainless steel trolley.}
<C>__{trudy}
<D>__{personally i think steak's too good for these traitors.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{they get steak? that's bullshit. let me see that }
<A>__{the guard bends to look into the hot cart and the muzzle of trudy's pistol presses behind his ear.}
<C>__{trudy}
<D>__{oops.}
<P>__{(shoving him down)}
<D>__{all the way down, pendejo.}
<A>__{she whistles and max trots around the corner. trudy binds the guard with one of his own zip ties as max grabs his key card and runs to the cell. swipes the card. the door is rolling open when another trooper rounds the corner. trudy takes him down with a sharp blow to the windpipe and a thai knee to the ribs. meanwhile the first trooper is getting up, but max clocks him heartily with a coffee urn. he goes down and stays down.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{that was unexpectedly satisfying.}
<A>__{trudy plants a kiss on norm as he runs out of the cell.}
<C>__{norm}
<D>__{baby, you rock.}
<A>__{jake wheels out, grabbing the sidearm from the fallen trooper as trudy binds his wrists.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(to max and trudy)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{jake faces his motley group, chambering a round.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{so what do you say? time for a revolution?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i'm free.}
<A>__{trudy grins and taps his fist.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{come on.}
