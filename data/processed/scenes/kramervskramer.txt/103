<A>__{stand side by side. he is cutting, chopping, making some kind of stew. thelma stands nearby watching, sipping a glass of white wine. from off screen we can hear billy and kim running around, playing.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you ever think about getting married again?}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{no, not really...}
<P>__{(she thinks for a moment, then:)}
<D>__{i guess it's different if you don't have children, but... i dunno, even if charley and i don't live together, even if we're sleeping with other people, even if charley was to marry again... he'd still be my husband. that stuff about "till death do you part?" that's really true.}

<P>__{propped open nearby)}
<D>__{how many onions does it say to use?}

<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(as he does)}
<D>__{d'you think you and charley'll ever get back together again?}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{no. i don't think so.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{c'mon, thel. so charley had a little fling. so what? all in all he was a pretty good husband.}
<C>__{thelma}
<D>__{look, i know this isn't gonna make any sense, okay? i mean forget the logic part... but i keep thinking if charley really loved me, he wouldn't have let me divorce him.}
