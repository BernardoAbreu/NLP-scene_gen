<A>__{o'connell., jonathan, daniels, the curator and ardeth ray follow evelyn as she strides through the museum.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{last month i came across an inscription that mentioned the book of the dead.}
<C>__{daniels}
<D>__{that book we found at hamunaptra?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{yes. i dismissed it, because it talked about bringing people back from the dead. a notion i was unwilling to believe.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{believe it, sister. that's what brought our buddy back to life.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{and now he's going to use it to bring his girlfriend back}
<C>__{ardeth ray}
<D>__{and if he succeeds, the two of them together will bring about the apocalypse.}
<A>__{the curator joins evelyn at her side as she heads up the stairs, everyone else in hot pursuit.}
<C>__{the curator}
<D>__{the plagues we have seen so far, are merely imhotep flexing his muscles. only at the moment of anck su namun's resurrection will he be truly invincible.}
<A>__{they reach the display cases. evelyn quickly opens them.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{i'm thinking that if the black book of the dead can bring people back to life }
<C>__{curator}
<D>__{ then perhaps, the golden book of the living can return them to the underworld.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{exactly }
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{so your sayin', if we find the book made outta gold }
<C>__{curator}
<D>__{ and read the sacred incantations contained inside it.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{you think it'll send this guy back to hell?}
<C>__{curator}
<D>__{correct, and that's when }
<A>__{loud chanting is heard coming from outside. they all rush over to the upper windows and look down outside: a large, crazed mob covered in hideous boils and sores comes chanting up the driveway: 'anck su namun! anck su namun!'}
<C>__{ardeth ray}
<D>__{it has begun. the beginning of the end.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{not quite yet it hasn't. c'mon.}
<A>__{evelyn dashes back to the display cases. everyone follows.}
