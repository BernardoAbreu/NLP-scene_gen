<L>__{interior basement room night}
<A>__{sweating, windowless concrete. overhead pipes. churning machinery. as the camera reveals this airtight dungeon }
<C>__{pistol agent }
<D>__{ this is bullshit, zagon. we got work to do.}
<C>__{zagon }
<D>__{all work and no play makes jack a dull boy.}
<B>__{nico}
<A>__{in a metal chair, wrists taped in front of him. one agent stands behind him, clasping a thin cable noose wrapped tight around nico's throat. shotgun agent holds his weapon on him, its twin muzzles inches from nico's skull.}
<B>__{zagon}
<A>__{finishes washing his hands in an industrial type sink. he is cleaned up, wearing a fresh shirt, his hair combed. when he dries his hands, he looks like a surgeon preparing to operate.}
<C>__{zagon}
<D>__{we've got an hour before the honorable senator.}
<P>__{(hands towel to pistol agent)}
<D>__{you've got to learn to take time, smell the roses.}
<A>__{zagon turns to nico.}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{how are you gonna do him, zagon? in a motorcade? or passing through a hotel kitchen?}
<A>__{the noose agent jerks his cable tight, making nico gag and choke. zagon motions to slacken off. he stops at a small table before nico unrolls a well worn felt pouch. zagon watches nico's reaction as the tools of the inter rogator's trade come into view drug vials, syringes, scalpels, surgical tools.}
<C>__{zagon}
<D>__{i've used these little beauties many times to extract information }
<P>__{(lifts a needle to the light)}
<D>__{ this'll be the first time i've ever used them... just for fun.}

<C>__{zagon}
<P>__{(to agents)}
<D>__{take his arms.}
<A>__{pistol agent and bad dude move in, one on each side, seizing nico's forearms. shotgun agent holds his weapon tight to nico's head. zagon punches nico square in the face, so hard the chair reels backward, spinning out from under nico }
<C>__{zagon}
<D>__{hold him up!}
<A>__{pistol agent and bad dude lift nico. zagon slams him again. again. nico's cheekbone is broken; blood drains from his nose. zagon aims a two handed blow; backhands nico, crushing the other side of his face! zagon backs off, chest heaving. pistol agent and bad dude plop nico back in the chair, gagging, choked by the noose. nico looks like the viet prisoner the one we saw in the opening sequence. like the prisoner, nico takes his beating still conscious, still meeting zagon's eyes with defiance.}
<C>__{zagon}
<D>__{this is where you came in, toscani. only, now it's where you're gonna check out.}
<A>__{he takes off his glove, grabs the syringe. pistol agent and bad dude clamp nico's right arm down tight. zagon injects nico.}
<B>__{nico}
<A>__{reacts instantly to the hypo cursing, sputtering under the choking noose. he twists wildly trying to free him self, but the agents' powerful arms hold him.}
<C>__{zagon}
<D>__{that's it. fight it, cherry. fight it, so it speeds faster on its way }
<A>__{nico struggles more violently.}
<C>__{zagon}
<D>__{fight it. till the vessels burst in your brain. till the arteries rupture in your heart }
<A>__{slowly, the struggle goes out of nico. his muscles go limp; he slumps drooling, babbling incoherently.}
<C>__{zagon}
<D>__{that's my boy. that's what i was waiting for }
<A>__{zagon produces his famous knife. he motions pistol agent and bad dude to release nico's arms. noose agent slackens his grip on the choke cable. zagon moves in closer, gloating, cooing }
<C>__{zagon}
<D>__{a fool learns from his own mistakes. but a wise man learns from the mistakes of others }
<P>__{(moves closer, blade in hand)}
<D>__{you should have killed me when you had the chance, toscani }
<A>__{the blade moves to nico's throat. suddenly: nico springs to life (catching noose man by surprise and jerking the cable from his grip) grabbing zagon with his taped hands by the throat, lifting him bodily, slamming him ferociously into the wall! zagon drops to the floor, half conscious. nico spins instantly to find: the shot gun agent right behind him, raising his weapon to nico's face, about to pull the trigger. nico sidesteps, grabbing the man's wrist. the shotgun goes off, missing nico by inches, blasting a huge chunk out of the concrete wall. the noose agent draws his weapon from his shoulder holster. nico snaps the shotgun agent's wrist, flipping him through the air, simultaneously grabbing the weapon, spinning behind the noose agent, then using the shotgun barrel like a club to smash the back of his head in! another swing wipes out pistol agent. bad dude, now with a clear shot, aims his m 16. nico blows him away with a double barreled shotgun blast. in a flash, nico has spun to zagon's surgical tool table, lifted a rzor sharp scalpel and slashed the tape, freeing his hands. he yanks the choke cable off his neck zagon against wall on his feet again. he reaches swiftly to the floor, snatches up his famous knife. nico confronts him face battered, bloody shaking, battling internal spasms.}
<C>__{zagon}
<D>__{can you feel the chemicals, cherry? you can't fight 'em much longer }
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{long enough to finish you.}
<A>__{sweating, half spitting, zagon slashes at nico like an animal nico traps the knife, and enters, smashes zagon in the face with one lightning blow. we see zagon's nose and face completely cave in. nico comes under zagon's elbow, the arm that still holds the knife clamping it in a vise like grip and bending it backwards, slowly, against the joint which now starts to rip in half. zagon is screaming and cursing, writhing in agony the drugs have hit nico full force now. he's weakening, his eyes are starting to roll. zagon tries one last surge of strength to save himself; it almost seems he'll wriggle free when: the elbow joint snaps in half with a sicken ing sound. as the joint hangs, dangling grotesquely, nico reaches up around zagon's neck, still holding the dangling limb with one arm. he begins to now do to zagon's neck what he did to his arm. we hear a terminal crack. zagon's body crumples to the floor. nico, in delirium, staggers toward the door }
