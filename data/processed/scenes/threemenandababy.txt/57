<L>__{interior living room day}
<A>__{peter and michael are still sitting on the living room couches. the doorbell rings. michael springs up and runs to open the door. peter follows him. on the doorstep stand the two punks. one of them is short and speaks with a heavy brooklyn accent. the other, tall, thin and creepy looking, stands behind his buddy and doesn't speak.}
<D>__{punk #1 jack collins live here?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{yes, he does. punk #1 we came for the package.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{package? oh that's cute, referring to her as a package! anyway, you can tell sylvia she's a lousy stinking bitch. punk #1 sylvia?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yeah, sylvia! you can tell her she's got a hell of a nerve dumping her problems into our laps! punk #1}
<P>__{(nervously)}
<D>__{problems? did you guys have trouble?}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(sarcastically)}
<D>__{he wants to know if we had trouble!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{do you have any idea what it's been like around here for the past four days?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{she could have at least given us a phone number or the name of someone to contact... punk #1}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{i don't get it. didn't they tell you we were gonna be here today?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{sure they told us! so what? that doesn't make the last four days any less hellish than they were!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well, anyway, they're here now, that's all that matters!}
<A>__{peter turns and walks toward the basket.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{the next bottle's in 45 minutes. i made it already. it's in the basket. punk #1 bottle? whadda ya mean, bottle?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{about an hour after her bottle, she starts yawning. put her to bed right away or it's pure hell for the next three hours, at least that's what we've noticed.}
<A>__{peter has returned with the basket. the punks look at the baby, their eyes wide with disbelief.}
<D>__{punk #1 what the hell is that? a baby?}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{no, it's a very short teenager. of course it's a baby! now listen carefully: i'm giving you a can of the milk she's been getting. she loves it, and more importantly, she's not allergic to it. i even put a can of the same brand in here for you, but in powdered form, understand?}
<A>__{punk #1 hears "powder" and catches on.}
<D>__{punk #1 oh! i get it! powdered milk! very clever!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yeah, right... real clever... okay, here. she's all yours. good luck.}
<A>__{he hands them the basket. punk #1 grabs the handles.}
<D>__{punk #1 okay, i got it. you can take her out now.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{take what out? i'm not taking anything out. punk #1 wait a minute, i don't get it! we take the basket and the milk, that's all. we ain't gonna take the... what's inside.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{whadda ya mean, what's inside?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you take it all, man! it's a package deal! punk #1 but what are we s'posed to do with it?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{how do i know? you take it where they told you to take it. punk #1 y'mean, i take it to the connection?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{yeah, whatever you want to call it. punk #1 are you sure that's the plan?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you bet that's the plan! we're not keeping her one more second. punk #1 okay, if that's the plan...}
<A>__{he passes the basket to punk #2}
<D>__{punk #1 ... here, hold this. okay, so long!}
<A>__{they start to leave, pressing the elevator button.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(suddenly a little worried)}
<D>__{uh... listen... maybe you could leave us the address or the phone number just in case. so we can find out how she's doing?}
<A>__{the punks exchange a puzzled glance.}
<D>__{punk #1 oh, yeah, sure, the address.}
<P>__{(feebly searching his pockets)}
<D>__{oh shit, i don't have it on me... but i will call you. okay, so long! peter & michael so long!}
<A>__{the elevator has arrived. the punks quickly slip inside it with the basket. michael closes the door. peter plops down in the armchair by the front door.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{aah, relief at last! good riddance!}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you said it! now maybe i can get some work done.}
<A>__{he disappears in the direction of his room. peter is sitting on something hard. he pulls it out from under him, it's a package. he looks at it, casually reading: "care of jack collins." he tosses it to the side. suddenly, it dawns on him. he leaps up, grabs the package and runs into michael's room.}
