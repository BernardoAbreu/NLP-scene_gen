<A>__{a tight two shot of malcolm and betty in an embrace. she breaks from him and whispers: "go ahead. i can wait now."}
<L>__{interior jfk airport day}
<A>__{a large press conference: mikes of every network, every newspaper and wire service present. malcolm sports a beard.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{let's begin. reporter #1 malcolm, you said on your trip abroad you sensed a feeling of great brotherhood.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{as i recall, i pointed out that while i was in mecca making the pilgrimage, i spoke about the brotherhood that existed at all levels among all people, all colors who had accepted the religion of islam. i pointed out that what it had done, islam, for those people despite their complexion differences, that it would probably do america well to study the religion of islam and perhaps it could drive some of the racism from this society. muslims look upon themselves as human beings, as part of the human family and therefore look upon all other segments of the human family as part of that same family. today my friends are black, brown, red, yellow and white. reporter #8 malcolm, are you prepared to go to the united nations at this point and ask that charges be brought against the united states for its treatment of the american negroes?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{oh yes.}
<A>__{the audience applauds.}
<C>__{malcolm }
<D>__{the audience will have to be quiet. yes, as i pointed out that during my trip that nations, african nations, asian, latin nations look very hypocritical when they stand up in the un condemning south africa and saying nothing about the racist practices that are manifested everyday against negroes in this society. i would be not a man if i didn't do so. i wouldn't be a man. reporter #3 are you prepared to work with some of the leaders of some of the other civil rights organizations?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{certainly, we will work with any groups, organizations or leaders in any way, as long as it's genuinely designed to get results. reporter #1 does the new beard have any religious significance?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{no, not particularly. but i do think that you will and black people in america, as they strive to throw off the shackles of mental colonialism, will also probably reflect an effort to throw off the shackles of cultural colonialism. and then they'll begin to reflect desires of their own with standards of their own. reporter #2 one of your more controversial remarks was a call for black people to get rifles and form rifle clubs sometime back. do you still favor that for self defense?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i don't see why that should be controversial. i think that if white people found themselves victim of the same kind of brutality that black people in this country face, and they saw that the government was either unwilling or unable to protect them, that the intelligence on the part of the whites would make them get some rifles and protect themselves. reporter #2 what about the guns, malcolm?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{has the white man changed since i went away? have you put up your guns? the day you stop being violent against my people will be the day i tell folks to put away their guns. reporter #3 then you're still an extremist?}
<A>__{angle muslim male}
<C>__{benjamin thomas}
<D>__{git your hand out of my pocket!}
<A>__{everyone turns around to the back to see what the commotion is about. the man who yelled out leaves quickly, we will see him later on, very soon.}
