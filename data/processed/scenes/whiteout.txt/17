<A>__{selecting a putter from a bag of golf clubs is doc fury,}
<L>__{60. looks seasoned. bearded. wears the only non red}
<A>__{parka we've seen: it's royal blue, trimmed with black fur and emblazoned with dozens of emblems and patches from years of antarctic service.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{in less than three days we begin winter over. the sky will go completely black and stay that way for six months.}
<A>__{camera pulls back to reveal five newbies (first timers); an asian, french, brazilian, danish and an american. all are standing on their jackets, shivering uncontrollably in the wind.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{the sane ninety percent of the population will be leaving the ice. extreme weather conditions make it impossible for planes from the outside world to land. you have chosen, for your own misguided reasons, to stay. and it is my responsibility to teach you beakers how not to die.}
<A>__{doc lines up on a hot pink golf ball and putts. the ball rolls across the glacier in an impossible, wind driven arc, approaches a flag, and sinks.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{time?}
<A>__{the asian holds a stopwatch. he stares at it stupidly.}
<C>__{asian}
<D>__{t... t... three minutes.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{your core body temperatures have fallen to approximately 97 degrees. you are shivering uncontrollably losing basic motor skills. you're having trouble focusing on even the simplest tasks. in short, you are well on your way to dying, and it has only been two hundred seconds.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{put your coats on.}
<A>__{the class struggles into their jackets. doc assists those who, in their diminished capacity, are having trouble figuring out how to put them on.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{your life is dependent on your awareness of the weather. so be aware. there is a condition that arises around here known as a whiteout. don't get caught in it. winds kick up snow that's lain on the ice for thousands of years can't see six inches in front of your nose. temperature plummets to triple digits. we found bodies less than a foot from safety and warmth.}
<A>__{carrie walks up. doc's eyes brighten.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{class, here we have another of the many hazards found on antarctica. say hello to marshal stetko.}
<A>__{through a disjointed, chattering chorus }
<C>__{class}
<D>__{hello marshal stetko.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{always a pleasure to see you. unlike most of the beaker heads down here.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{social visit?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{i wish we got a job. i need you to take a ride with me.}
<C>__{carrie }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{might be a body out on the ice.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{why's this crap always happen at the end of the season?}
<A>__{carrie pulls a driver from doc's golf bag. lines up another pink ball.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{too cold for driving.}
<A>__{carrie swings whack! the ball shatters and pink bits rain down around them.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{so it is.}
