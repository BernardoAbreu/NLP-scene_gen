<A>__{by firelight, we see sajnu feeding the big elephants while short round feeds and talks to the baby elephant }
<C>__{short round}
<D>__{you come to america with me, and we can get job in the circus you like that?}
<A>__{the baby elephant trumpets affirmitively. a ways off, willie stands wrapped in a blanket watching shorty and the elephant as she dries her hair by a campfire. now indy comes up and drops an armload of wood for yet another fire.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{where'd you find your little body guard?}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{i met short round when he tried to pick my pocket.}
<A>__{indiana kneels and arranges the wood.}
<C>__{indiana }
<D>__{shorty's family was killed when they bombed shanghai. he was living on the streets.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{he'll be okay. he's a good kid.}
<A>__{indy strikes a match and lights the new fire.}
<C>__{willie }
<D>__{all these fires you expecting more snakes, dr. jones?}
<A>__{she smiles snidely and continues drying her hair.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{by the way, how'd you end up in shanghai?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{well, when my nightclub career was run over by the depression, some pinhead convinced me that "a girl could go places in the orient..." so, look where i got.}
<A>__{indy picks up a blanket and spreads it on the ground.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{what about the future?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{oh, that's easy i'm going to latch onto a good looking, in credibly rich prince.}
<A>__{indy lies down on the blanket.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{i'd like to find one of those myself.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(raising an eyebrow)}
<D>__{oh really?}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{yeah, but he's got to be dead and buried for a couple of thousand years.}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{fortune and glory...}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{is that what you're hoping to find at this palace, dr. jones?}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{maybe...}
<A>__{indy reaches into his pocket and removes the old piece of cloth.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{she walks over to where he's lying down and sits on a boulder. he hands her the cloth and she looks at it by the firelight.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{something that kid gave me last night. it's a piece of an old manuscript.}
<A>__{willie sees a crude drawing in reds, blue and gold.}
<C>__{indiana }
<D>__{the drawing shows a priest named sankara who lived centuries ago.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{what does the writing say?}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{it's sanskrit. it tells the story of sankara climbing mt. kalisa where he met the hindu god shiva.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(examining it)}
<D>__{that's shiva? what's he giving the priest?}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{legend says he told sankara to go forth and combat evil. to do that he gave him five sacred stones that had magical powers.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(looking at indy)}
<D>__{you mean magical like the rock that was stolen from that village?}
<A>__{indy looks at her meaningfully.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{it could be.}
<A>__{willie seems frightened. she hands him the piece of cloth and stands up.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{fortune and glory...sweet dreams, dr. jones.}
<A>__{she picks up a blanket and starts off.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{i think you should sleep closer.}
<P>__{(seeing her sus picious look)}
<D>__{i meant for safety.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i'd be safer sleeping with that snake.}
<A>__{she steps over to a tree by the fire where her clothes are dry ing. indy watches her pull her dried clothes from the lower branches. she reaches up to remove another piece of her clothing it's stuck to the tree and she looks up and yanks it. suddenly the piece of clothing moves! two enormous winds open and the hideous face of a giant bat screeches and hisses at willie! she screams hysterically as the bat flaps against her, biting and scratching at her before it fi nally takes off. the bat flies off into the darkness and indy chuckles as he watches willie shanking as she backs slowly toward the fire }
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{did you see it?! it was one of those bats!}
<P>__{(staring into the darkness)}
<D>__{god, what else is out there...?!}
<A>__{she quickly picks up her blanket and lays it out very close to indy.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{couldn't keep away, huh?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{just try and control yourself.}
<A>__{indiana watches her lie down and wrap herself in her blanket. then he rolls over and tips his hat down over his eyes to get some well deserved shut eye. in a moment, however, we see something grotesque and snake like slide into frame and move towards indy finally, we realize it's an elephant's trunk. the trunk nudges indy's shoulder.}
<C>__{indiana}
<P>__{(without looking)}
<D>__{still scared? okay, willie, you can get closer if you want...}
<A>__{the elephant's trunk moves closer and nuzzles indy's neck.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{honey, i knew you'd be the first one to give in...}
<A>__{now, we see that short round is guiding the baby elephant's trunk with a prod. willie watches, stifling a laugh as the elephant's trunk sniffs indiana's ear }
<C>__{indiana }
<D>__{you're going to start something i'm going to have to finish.}
<P>__{(moaning)}
<D>__{okay, doll, you asked for it.}
<A>__{indiana rolls over, lifts his hat and hollers! he nearly jumps out of his pants as he stares into the elephant's trunk. willie and short round dissolve into laughter.}
