<L>__{interior barracks day}
<A>__{the barracks are empty... keltner enters the huge room and looks around and sees helmut at the other end of the barracks just walking back and forth like a caged lion... angry, hurt, sad, and generally out of sorts... he can't even hear keltner approaching him... he finally stops at the back wall of the barracks and lays his head against the barracks wall...}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(not aware keltner is behind him)}
<D>__{dear god, please hear me!}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{he hears you, my son...}
<A>__{helmut jumps, scared... throwing his back against the wall, like a man who fears being attacked at any time...}
<C>__{keltner}
<P>__{(sympathetically)}
<D>__{here, here, easy, you can't do this to yourself...}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{you frightened me, johann, i'm sorry...}
<C>__{keltner}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{you have nothing to be sorry for... fear isn't something controlled by man... fear can not be conferred with... there isn't anyway known to mankind where man can say to himself... "i will not be afraid"... oh, certainly man can try to fight it... but faith and believing are man's only chance... you must have faith... you must!}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{i have faith... but not always... sometimes it eludes me... i can't remember to remember it.}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{but that's natural... you can't expect to be perfect in what you try to do...}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{i don't know...}
<A>__{he starts pacing again.}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{i heard what happened at breakfast this morning with rothman, the guard...}
<A>__{helmut spins around, frightened again...}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{will they do something to me? what have you heard?}
<C>__{keltner}
<P>__{(putting his arm around him)}
<D>__{nothing, absolutely nothing... don't worry about it... i just wanted you to know that i believe you handled yourself admirably...}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{that was one time i didn't care for the laughs i was getting from some of the men...}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{of course you didn't... but i'm sure you know man laughs for two reasons... one because something is funny... two, because they fear showing fear... they laughed because "there but for the grace of god go i!"}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{do you really think so?}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{i'm certain of it!}
<A>__{helmut smiles and takes johann's hand, tenderly, and warmly:}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{thank you, johann. i always feel so much better after you talk to me...}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{i'm glad, helmut, i'm very glad... you know you can always talk to me, about anything...}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(remembering)}
<D>__{oh! i almost forgot...}
<A>__{helmut puts johann around the back of the barrack area near the wall out of sight of anyone coming in...}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{before breakfast this morning, i spoke to one of the guards, a very intelligent one, and he seems quite nice and friendly too. well, he said that the gestapo has set up a special review board to handle cases just like mine. and he said he would get me a form, a special form. just been printed up. and i'm to fill it out. isn't that good?}
<A>__{keltner looking at him, like a child that believes in the boogie man:}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{how many times since you've been here, have you filled out forms? twenty? thirty times??}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(in fast)}
<D>__{but this is different. it's entirely new.}
<A>__{helmut takes out a set of papers from his back pocket to show keltner.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{see? these are made up by the gestapo itself... and the form will go directly to berlin, to gestapo headquarters. that's the important thing about this... the gestapo's in on it. that's a very good sign.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{isn't it a good sign?}
<C>__{keltner}
<P>__{(sympathetically)}
<D>__{yes, my son, it is a good sign.}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(in fast, excited; scanning the papers)}
<D>__{and i have to be very careful of everything i put down on the form. the tiniest detail could make the difference. don't you agree?}
<A>__{helmut looks up and notices johann is looking up towards the ceiling of the barracks... watching something... helmut looks up, too. their pov the birds up and under the eaves of the barrack just above their heads, two small birds are perched (apparently they flew in from outside and decided to nest there). back to helmut and keltner two shot}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{isn't it strange? they are free to go anywhere they want, and they come here to nest.}
<A>__{helmut doesn't react to keltner's dialogue, but goes back to his creased and soiled papers that he's read a thousand times before, and reads them again... as he reads... keltner takes a piece of brown bread from his shirt pocket and crumbles it and throws the crumbs up to the little birds... his pov the birds they scramble to chew the crumbs, and they do... down shot keltner watching. johann just watches, smiling at the birds, turns and looks to see if helmut is watching, too... helmut close intense at scanning through the papers and totally oblivious to keltner and the birds... keltner close}
<C>__{keltner}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{watch the birds eat, helmut... it's so cute...}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{i'm sure i've got everything here... the important facts from the moment i was arrested, the questions the gestapo officer asked me... now what was his name again? i can't seem to remember what his name was...}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{helmut...}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{what the devil was his name?}
<C>__{keltner }
<D>__{helmut !}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(coming out of it)}
<D>__{oh, yes, johann... i'm sorry... you were saying?}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{you're not a religious man, are you, helmut?}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(thinking about it)}
<D>__{well, i... ah...}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{not sure i am myself anymore.}
<A>__{helmut quite surprised by this remark.}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{yet... when i see those birds, i wonder... were they sent here to let us know this place really isn't god forsaken?}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{he should have sent them elsewhere... they could be eaten here!}
<A>__{helmut goes back to studying his papers, keltner ponders helmut's remark, looks backup at the birds... his face full of compassion, as we:}
