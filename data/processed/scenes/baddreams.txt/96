<A>__{this is a low passageway between floors. edgar has to stoop under the ducts and pipes. he comes to a small hatchway in the coiling above him marked "caution: turbine." there is a latch which has to be pulled to release the hatchway. edgar pulls. it's stuck. he yanks with his frail body. the latch barely moves. a trickle of blood streams out at the edge, but edgar doesn't see it. edgar yanks and pulls with all his might, groaning and heaving. finally he stops in frustration. he sits an a duct, resting. just then the latch undoes itself. the hatchway slams open. edgar is showered with red lumpy fluid. he is coated with it.}
