<D>__{fuck.}
<A>__{even when she talks dirty, there's a heartland goodness to her voice. like kansas corn fields swaying in the breeze. as she grabs the ticket from the windshield, her sunglasses accidentally clatter to the ground.}

<C>__{erin}
<D>__{goddamnit.}
<A>__{she tends to the nail as she opens her car door and gets in.}

<A>__{the hyundai starts it up, signals. then, just as it pulls slowly out into the street, a jaguar barrels around the corner, accelerating out of the turn, and rams into the side of erin's car, sending it careening into the median. it smashes into a foot thick lightpost. and stops.}
