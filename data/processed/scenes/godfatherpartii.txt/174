<A>__{the first time ever away from michael, moving toward us quickly. he stops, knocks on the door of roth's suite. then quickly for a man his size, he moves without noise to the adjoining door, opens it with a key, and disappears inside. a moment elapses on the empty corridor, and then a roused johnny ola, opens the first door. he steps out into the corridor, to see who had knocked. confused, he is about to return inside, when bussetta easily breaks his neck in two from behind.}
