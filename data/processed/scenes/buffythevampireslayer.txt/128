<A>__{thrashing about the room in hysterics, screaming and snarling, banging his one fist on the boiler tank. it booms hollowly. lothos grabs him, throws him up against the wall.}

<D>__{what's wrong with you!?!}
<C>__{amilyn}
<D>__{my arm! he took my fucking arm!}
<C>__{lothos}
<D>__{shut up! you let him have it!}
<A>__{lothos lets amilyn go. amilyn still fumes, quietly.}

<D>__{i had him in my grasp.}
<C>__{lothos}
<D>__{cheer up. you may still.}
<A>__{only lothos smiles at the joke. amilyn raises his stump, looks at it. the tattered end of his jacket covers the grossness of it, but it still isn't good.}

<D>__{i look horrible.}
<C>__{lothos}
<D>__{the other two the new ones. where are they?}
<C>__{amilyn}

<P>__{(thoughtfully)}
<D>__{no... not a boy...}
<P>__{(gathers himself)}
<D>__{find out if they're dead. and do something about that arm. honestly, i don't know how you made it through the crusades.}
<A>__{he turns toward his chamber.}
<C>__{lothos}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{let me know about our little recruits. i will be in my chamber...}
<A>__{on his way through the door he passes a box on an oil drum. he plucks a large kitten out of it.}
