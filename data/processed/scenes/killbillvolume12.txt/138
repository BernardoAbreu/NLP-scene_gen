<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{back to coffin, six feet under pitch black the flashlight beam turns on. cu the bride in profile. her breathing is normal. we can hear the soft beat of her heart inside the pine box. her composure is back. taking the flashlight, she shines the beam on the lid above her....along the line of the coffin's rim and the lid where many nails meet....then down to her red cowboy boots, bound by a leather belt around her. raising her knees, as much as the coffin will allow, and wiggling her feet, she slips her bare feet our of the boots and the belt's binding...then, using her bare feet, then her bound at the wrist hands, to pass one of the boots up to her...when the red boot is in her grasp, she turns it upside down....the straight razor falls out. opening the razor, she slices through the ropes that tie her wrists, till both hands are free. she positions the flashlight so its beam shines on the coffin lid. the lid's about an inch and a half from the tip of her nose, about three inches from her hand.}
<B>__{then...}
<A>__{as combat drums begin to beat on the soundtrack, she begins to concentrate. her eyes focus on the wood above her, her left hand reaches out, touches the pine, passing her energy to it... ...her long, white fingers, ball up into a fist.... ...and that fist begins striking the coffin lid above her. with each strike she lets out a karate scream...}
<B>__{again...}
<A>__{and again... her fist smashes into the wood, leaving blood on the lid...}
<B>__{again...}
<A>__{and again... a crack in the lid...}
<B>__{again...}
<A>__{dirt begins to sift through the cracks onto the bride...}
<B>__{again...}
<A>__{more dirt...}
<B>__{again...}
<A>__{even more dirt...}
<B>__{again...}
<A>__{the lid smashes and dirt pours into the coffin like water...}
<B>__{then...}
<A>__{through six feet of dirt, we watch, the bride dig climb swim sprout burrow trough the earth like a sprouting plant and a burrowing mole combined, clawing for surface air.}
