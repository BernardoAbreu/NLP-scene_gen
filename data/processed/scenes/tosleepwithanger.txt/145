<A>__{okra is painfully standing on his bad feet. he is in his security guard uniform, holding a bouquet of greens. as suzie comes in, okra tries to stand upright at attention.}
<C>__{okra}
<D>__{i brought you these greens and some salt meat.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{that is very thoughtful of you. i haven't had time to tend to my garden like i should.}
<A>__{suzie takes the greens and puts them on the counter. she squeezes okra's hand as a thank you. she pours him a cup of coffee. okra eases down into the chair. he crosses his legs and starts massaging his feet. suzie get herself a cup of coffee and sits opposite him. she stretches and tries to hold back a yawn. okra looks at her in a slightly desirous way.}
<C>__{okra}
<D>__{you know gideon and i are lodge brothers and it has always been a policy to take care of the wives if something happens to our brother.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{you are very sweet, but gideon has already taken care of everything in case something happens to him. he has a policy.}
<C>__{okra}
<D>__{if you become a widow, you will need someone around to fix the whatnots. we like for the widow to marry someone in the lodge. i know gideon ain't gone yet, but there will be a lot of his old friends coming around to get in line. i just want you to consider this as a kind of a conditional proposal, to be first in line so to speak.}
<A>__{suzie keeps herself under control; she tries to find words to say. she stands up.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{excuse me. i have to go feed my dog.}
<A>__{she turns the fire out from under the coffee pot and exits the back door. okra unties his shoes and begins to massage his feet.}
