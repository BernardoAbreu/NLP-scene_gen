<A>__{mckee scribbles a diagram onto a transparency in an overhead projector. it's some kind of complicated time line with act breaks and corresponding page numbers indicated. the audience members take copious notes. kaufman sweats.}
<C>__{kaufman }
<D>__{it is my weakness, my ultimate lack of conviction that brings me here with all these desperate idiots lapping up everything this bag of wind spouts. easy answers. rules to short cut yourself to success. and here i am, because my jaunt into the abyss brought me nothing. well, isn't that the risk one takes for attempting something new. i should leave here right now. i will start over }
<P>__{(starts to rise)}
<D>__{i need to face this project head on and }

<D>__{... and god help you if you use voice over in your work, my friends.}
<A>__{kaufman stops, looks up, startled. mckee seems to be looking at him.}
<C>__{mckee}
<D>__{god fucking help you! it's flaccid, sloppy writing. any idiot can write voice over narration to explain the thoughts of a character. you must present the internal conflicts of your character in image, in symbol. film is a medium of movement and image.}
<A>__{kaufman looks around at people scribbling in notebooks. "any idiot..." writes the guy on one side of him. "flaccid..." writes the guy on the other side.}
<C>__{mckee }
<D>__{okay, one hour for lunch.}
