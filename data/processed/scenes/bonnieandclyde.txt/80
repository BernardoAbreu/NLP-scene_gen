<L>__{interior bedroom.}
<A>__{bonnie closes the door and immediately begins fussing with clyde's hair, doing a scathing imitation of blanche. though her miming expresses her irritation at being closeted with the barrow menage, it is also a peach doing an imitation of a lemon and it is disarmingly sensual... indeed the mimicry allows bonnie to be physically freer with clyde, and allows clyde to respond without anxiety, without self consciousness. we should have the distinct if momentary feeling that clyde could suddenly make it with bonnie.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(doing an unmerciful imitation)}
<D>__{oh, daddy, you shore need a haircut. you look just like a little old hillbilly boy, i do declare.}
<P>__{(she has her other}
<D>__{hand toying with the buttons on his shirt, her hand slipping under, fluttering}
<P>__{across his bare chest)}
<D>__{oh mercy me, oh my stars!}
<A>__{clyde laughs, and bonnie tugs at the shirt she kneels on the bed over clyde, who quite easily drapes across it.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(a little louder)}
<D>__{oh, daddy! yore such a slowpoke!}
<A>__{she's letting her hair fall loose, its golden ends brushing up and down clyde's body.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(amused, but cautionary)}
<D>__{hush up a little. they're in the next room.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(a mock pout, but with an edge to it)}
<D>__{shoot, there's always somebody in this room, the next room and ever' other kind of room.}
<A>__{clyde has his arm around bonnie, and she's almost draped across him but in the direction of the length of the bed, so their bodies almost form a crooked cross. she digs an elbow into his stomach.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{oof!...now that ain't no nice way to talk about my brother.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(imitating blanche again with baby talk)}
<D>__{i ain't talking about your brother.}
<A>__{suddenly bonnie straightens up to a kneeling position again, and cocks her head. when she speaks now it is with a simple plaintiveness.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{honey, do you ever just want to be alone with me?}
<P>__{(sensing clyde's}
<D>__{sensitivity to the}
<P>__{sexual implication)}
<D>__{i don't just mean like that...i mean do you ever have the notion of us bein' out together and alone, like at some fancy ball, or, i don't know, where we walk in all dressed and they announce us and it's fancy and in public, but we're alone somehow. we're separate from everybody else, and they know it.}
<A>__{clyde looks up to bonnie, affectionately. he runs his hand carelessly down her body.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{i always feel like we're separate from everybody else.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(it's terribly important to her)}
<D>__{do you, baby?}
<A>__{suddenly there is a ring at the door. bonnie and clyde freeze.}
