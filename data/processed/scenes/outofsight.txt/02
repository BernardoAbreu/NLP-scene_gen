<C>__{a printed brochure that reads...}
<A>__{looking for money? you've come to the right place. we then pull back to reveal that we're now...}
<B>__{inside the bank}
<A>__{as foley stands at a counter holding the above credit application while he studies the bank layout. foley watches a man in a suit, carrying an attache case, enter the bank and move through the gate into the fenced off business area at the front. an executive rises from his desk, shakes hands with the man and they both sit down. foley rosses the brochure in the trash, then crosses to a teller window where a nameplate on the counter tells us the young woman with the pile of dark hair smiling at him is loretta.}
<D>__{teller loretta how can i help you, sir?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{loretta, you see that guy talking to your manager, has his case open?}
<A>__{foley takes out a zippo lighter and casually, yet expertly, begins to fiddle with it as the teller looks across the bank.}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{that's mr. guindon, one of our assistant managers. our manager is mr. schoen, but he's not in today.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{but you see the guy with the attache case?}
<C>__{loretta}
<P>__{(looks again)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{that's my partner. he has a gun in there. and if you don't do exactly what i tell you, or you give me any kind of a problem, i will look over at my partner and he'll shoot your mr. guindon between the eyes.}
<A>__{loretta goes stiff, swallows, stares back at foley.}
<C>__{foley }
<D>__{now take one of those big envelopes and put as many hundreds, fifties and twenties as you can pack into it. nothing with bank straps or rubber bands. i don't want any dye packs. i don't want any bait money. start with the second drawer and then the one over there, under the computer. come on, loretta, the key's right there next to you. no bills off the bottom of the drawer.}
<P>__{(as she works)}
<D>__{first time being robbed?}
<P>__{(she nods)}
<D>__{you're doing great. just smile, loretta, so you won't look like you're being held up.}
<P>__{(she smiles awkwardly)}
<D>__{that's the way, you're doing fine.}
<A>__{we hear a bit of thunder and foley cuts a fast look out the front door. when he turns back, he sees that loretta's having some trouble fitting all the bills into the envelope.}
<C>__{foley }
<D>__{here, give me the twenties. i will put 'em in my pocket. okay, i haven't had to give my partner a sign; that's good. now, he's gonna wait thirty seconds till after i'm out the door, make sure you haven't set off the alarm. if you have, he's gonna shoot mr. guindon between the eyes. okay? i think that'll do it. thank you, loretta, and have a nice day.}
<C>__{loretta}
<D>__{you, too.}
<A>__{foley heads for the door. he pauses by mr. guindon's desk, looks back at loretta. foley smiles at her, then turns to the man sitting with mr. guindon, indicates loretta...}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{she's cute, isn't she?}
<A>__{the man looks across the bank at loretta.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{uh, yeah, i guess so.}
<A>__{foley winks at loretta and walks out.}
<C>__{man }
<P>__{(to mr. guindon)}
<D>__{who was that?}
