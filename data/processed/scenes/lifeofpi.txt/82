<T>__{a short time later:}
<L>__{exterior raft day}
<A>__{pi has cut his shoe into a dozen bits of leather and tried fishing several times always with the same result. richard parker, watching, mops at his jaw to wipe away drool he's clearly getting hungry.}
<C>__{pi}
<D>__{patience!}
<L>__{exterior the lifeboat the raft dusk}
<A>__{pi still fishes with no success. richard parker stares in the water at the dorado. he leans over the side of the boat, pawing hungrily at the surface as fish streak past but the fish elude him. richard parker leans out further, striking with both paws and finally jumps in altogether. richard parker strikes and splashes as fish streak past. pi grins at the tiger's predicament but the moment richard parker realizes he can't climb back aboard, he begins swimming toward the raft. pi snaps to, recognizing the danger he's in. he reels the raft over to the lifeboat, practically leaping onto the bow. as he hauls the raft aboard, richard parker manages to catch the netting on the raft with one paw. pi leans back against an oar with all his weight, trying to lever the raft aboard; the weight of the tiger tips the entire bow lower in the water. pi is about to lose the struggle when the tiger's claw rips through the netting, and the lifeboat springs back up in the water; the momentum flips the raft up onto the boat. pi turns, watching as richard parker swims up behind him alongside the bow. he digs into the supply box and rises with a hatchet in his hand, crossing to stand over the tiger and blowing the whistle threateningly. standoff. pi pumps the axe a few times, but cannot bring himself to kill the tiger. richard parker stares up at pi a long moment, then paddles to the stern, trying once again to pull himself aboard at the other end of the boat.}

<D>__{what am i doing?}
<A>__{pi kicks at the side of the boat in frustration, and is surprised to hear a metal clunk. he finds a rectangular aluminum air box used for bouyancy: pi then pulls the tarp back fully for the first time and examines the contents below. as he removes one of the floorboard panels, imagining new uses for the wooden slats, he hears richard parker scratching at the hull of the boat.}
