<A>__{as he reaches a small armory. a glass case set into the wall. a half dozen rarely used guns are inside. he tries the handle. locked. he hears the clamor of feet and voices as the others are nearing. he breaks the glass and grabs a shotgun. then a box of shells. he frantically tries to load, but is too nervous. the others arrive at the end of the hallway. garry pulls his handgun and points.}
<C>__{garry}
<D>__{put that down!}
<C>__{sanchez}
<P>__{(trembling)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{garry}
<D>__{i will put this right through your head.}
<A>__{no one doubts garry's sincerity.}
<C>__{sanchez}
<D>__{you guys going to let him give orders? i mean he could be one of those things.}
<A>__{the other regard garry tensely. no one oblivious to the fact, that sanchez just might be right.}
<C>__{macready}
<P>__{(calm)}
<D>__{put it away, sanchez. just put it away.}
<A>__{still trembling, he tosses the shells back into the broken case, leans the gun against the wall and begins to sob. nauls skates over to comfort him. the men watch as garry lowers his gun. he turns to them.}
<C>__{garry}
<D>__{i don't know about copper. but i didn't go near that plasma...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but i guess you'll all rest easier if someone else is in charge.}
<A>__{he hands his gun to norris.}
<C>__{garry}
<D>__{can't see anyone objecting to you, norris.}
<C>__{norris}
<D>__{sorry, gentlemen...}
<P>__{(rubs chest)}
<D>__{...don't think i'd be up to it. haven't been feeling well lately.}
<A>__{childs goes for the gun.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{i will take it...}
<A>__{macready beats him to it.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{maybe it should be someone a bit more even tempered, childs.}
<A>__{childs glares.}
<C>__{macready}
<P>__{(to others)}
<D>__{...any objections?}
<A>__{roving eyes pass about the hallway. nobody is sure who to trust. macready seems as good as any.}
