<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior sleeping quarters}
<A>__{sam 1 enters the sleeping quarters straightens the bed and lies down. he picks up the picture of the pregnant tess, stares at it long and hard.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior rec room later}
<A>__{the tv is off. sam 2 is sitting, arms folded, entrenched in}
<B>__{gloom.}
<A>__{sam 1 enters and heads for the kitchen, prepares himself a snack. sam 2 is aware that sam 1 is there, but keeps his eyes focussed forward, as immobile as a statue. eventually sam 1 tentatively comes over.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{i'm staring into space.}
<P>__{(points to the window)}
<D>__{get it?}
<A>__{sam 1 does get it. he smiles to be polite, sits.}
<C>__{sam 2 }
<D>__{how's the nose?}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{better.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{listen, i went haywire before. i lost it. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{it's okay.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{no it's not okay. i fucked up fairfield your model that's unacceptable. i don't know what's wrong with me.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i've got a temper. i need to do something about it.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{yes you do.}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{i've been thinking. that rescue unit eliza they'll be here in less than fourteen hours. i don't know about you but i'd like to figure out where we stand before they get here.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{ostensibly they're coming to deal with the stalled harvester. we both know that isn't true.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{they're coming to dig your body out of that rover. they think you're in there.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{what'll their reaction be when they find out you survived the crash? i wasn't supposed to find you. lunar instructed gerty to lock me inside the base for christ's sake.}
<A>__{a pause. sam 1 thinking it over.}
<C>__{sam 2 }
<D>__{and there's something else. something i haven't told you.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<C>__{sam 2 }
<D>__{right around the time i was awakened...i walked in on gerty talking to central. he was having a live conversation.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{a live conversation?}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{that's not possible.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{no no no, it is possible. it's possible because i saw it, that's my pointerior}
<A>__{sam 2 feels himself losing his temper a little here. he reigns himself in.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{how do you know the conversation was live?}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{it was a back and forth exchange. and i saw thompson and overmeyers up on the monitor. i was supposed to be asleep in the infirmary. the moment i walked into the comms room gerty terminated the transmission. now i was a little drugged up, granted, but i didn't imagine it.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{the communications equipment is damaged there was a solar storm }
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{tabitha.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{tabitha, right.}
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{lunar made it up. maybe. i don't know. bottom line is they don't want us to be able to contact earth. otherwise why would they have lied to us?}
<A>__{a pause. sam 1 staring forward, concentrating. sam 2 concentrating on sam 1.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{how are they blocking the live feed? the base's communications equipment works fine }
<C>__{sam 2}
<D>__{maybe they're not blocking the signal from inside the base.}
<C>__{sam 1}
<D>__{from where then?}
<A>__{as if reading each others minds, the two sams' heads turn to the window a slow, perfectly synchronized movement. the lunar landscape, as black and vast as ever. the view almost cruel in its emptiness. it's not giving them any answers, not yet.}
