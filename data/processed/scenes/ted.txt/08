<D>__{hey teddy... can i tell you something nobody knows?}
<A>__{teddy looks back at him, expressionless.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{last week, my mom and dad took me to the park for a picnic. and they have this duck pond there, and... when nobody was looking, i pooped in my hand and threw it at a duck. was that mean?}

<C>__{john }

<D>__{now, if there's one thing you can be sure of... it's that nothing is more powerful than a young boy's wish.}
