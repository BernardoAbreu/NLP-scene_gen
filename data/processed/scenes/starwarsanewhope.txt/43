<L>__{exterior tatooine rock canyon floor day}
<A>__{artoo forces himself into the shadows of a small alcove in the rocks as the vicious sandpeople walk past carrying the inert luke skywalker, who is dropped in a heap before the speeder. the sandpeople ransack the speeder, throwing parts and supplies in all directions. suddenly they stop. then everything is quiet for a few moments. a great howling moan is heard echoing throughout the canyon which sends the sandpeople fleeing in terror. artoo moves even tighter into the shadows as the slight swishing sound that frightened off the sandpeople grows even closer, until a shabby old desert rat of a man appears and leans over luke. his ancient leathery face, cracked and weathered by exotic climates is set off by dark, penetrating eyes and a scraggly white beard. ben kenobi squints his eyes as he scrutinizes the unconscious farm boy. artoo makes a slight sound and ben turns and looks right at him.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{hello there! come here my little friend. don't be afraid.}
<A>__{artoo waddles over to were luke lies crumpled in a heap and begins to whistle and beep his concern. ben puts his hand on luke's forehead and he begins to come around.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{don't worry, he'll be all right.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{rest easy, son, you've had a busy day. you're fortunate you're still in one piece.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{ben? ben kenobi! boy, am i glad to see you!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{the jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly. tell me young luke, what brings you out this far?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{oh, this little droid! i think he's searching for his former master... i've never seen such devotion in a droid before... there seems to be no stopping him. he claims to be the property of an obi wan kenobi. is he a relative of yours? do you know who he's talking about?}
<A>__{ben ponders this for a moment, scratching his scruffy beard.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{obi wan kenobi... obi wan? now thats a name i haven't heard in a long time... a long time.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i think my uncle knew him. he said he was dead.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{oh, he's not dead, not... not yet.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you know him!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well of course, of course i know him. he's me! i haven't gone by the name obi wan since oh, before you were born.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{then the droid does belong to you.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{don't seem to remember ever owning a droid. very interesting...}
<A>__{he suddenly looks up at the overhanging cliffs.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i think we better get indoors. the sandpeople are easily startled but they will soon be back and in greater numbers.}
<A>__{luke sits up and rubs his head. artoo lets out a pathetic beep causing luke to remember something. he looks around.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{threepio!}
