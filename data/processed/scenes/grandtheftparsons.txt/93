<D>__{well... the first part.}
<A>__{the cop nods and repeats it to himself.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{the first part.}
<A>__{they stare at each other.}
<C>__{cop }
<D>__{okay, now why don't you tell me what the hell's going on?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{going on?}
<A>__{they stare at each other. the cop shifts position and purses his lips. larry stares at the ground looking for some kind of inspiration. just when the silence moves beyond uncomfortable, the door of the mortuary opens and phil clatters out with the casket.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{well, i don't care if it is first thing in the morning but i sure need a coffee. i tell you, i've never seen so many darned bits of paper to sign! it's paperwork which is slowing this great country down. we're drowning in triplicate!}
<A>__{he's busying himself at the back of the hearse, and appears to notice the cop for the first time.}
<C>__{phil }
<D>__{good morning officer.}
<A>__{the cop peers at him suspiciously.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{mornin'.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{i was just saying how people with work to do people like yourself, officer are just getting engulfed by paper. grab the end, will you? doesn't that just drive you plain crazy?}
<A>__{the cop hesitates and then takes the end of the casket and helps load it into the hearse. con tinue d: (2)}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{i guess it does.}
<A>__{phil gestures at larry to get into the car, which he does.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{one casket, six sheets to sign. six! that can't be right. does that sound right to you?}
<A>__{he closes the back doors and gets into the passenger seat.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{nope. sure don't.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{and the very last thing i want to do is to hold you up further with my chatter. thank you for your help, officer. you have a good day, now.}
<A>__{it looks like they've got away with it. but:}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{just a moment, boys.}
<A>__{phil smiles up at him.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{yessir?}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{your sidekick here has just finished telling me that you're gonna pick someone up from the terminal. a surprise, he said. and here you are loading a coffin into your vehicle...}
<A>__{phil doesn't miss a beat.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{and there you have it, officer. you see the gentleman we're meeting from the plane doesn't yet know about the sad passing of his... aunt.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{and you're gonna meet him off his flight with her coffin?}
<A>__{he raises an eyebrow. con tinue d: (3)}
<C>__{cop }
<D>__{that's a real nice touch.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{yeah. we're doing it this way for the avoidance of doubt.}
<A>__{he gestures at larry to start the car. larry pulls out the screwdriver and starts to jig it about in the ignition. the cop watches. as the engine refuses to catch, larry starts to panic.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{ignition's a bit temperamental.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{more fiddling. no ignition.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{have to use a screwdriver.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{i see that.}
<A>__{the car starts.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{thanks for everything, officer. we'd best be off...}
<A>__{he looks meaningfully at the cop, who grudgingly moves back. as they move off, stanley hurries round the corner with his overnight bag in his hand.}
