<L>__{28a. (deleted) 28b. duke leto and paul against sea}
<A>__{they look out over the sea. a huge wave crashes below. the duke turns to paul.}

<P>__{(out loud)}
<D>__{thufir hawat has served house atreides three generations.... he swears you are the finest student he's ever taught. yueh, gurney and duncan say the same.... it makes me feel very proud...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i want you to be proud of me.}
<A>__{paul smiles up at his father. the wind blows the duke's hair and behind him stands the castle and the green and black atreides banner against the night sky beyond. the rain starts again lightly. paul takes a closer look at the atreides banner moving in the wind.}
<C>__{duke leto}
<P>__{(studying the dark sea below)}
<D>__{i will miss the sea... but a person needs new experiences... they jar something deep inside, allowing him to grow. without change, something sleeps inside us... and seldom awakens... the sleeper must awaken.}
<A>__{paul's attention goes to his father's hand where he sees the duke's signet ring. again he smiles at his father.}
