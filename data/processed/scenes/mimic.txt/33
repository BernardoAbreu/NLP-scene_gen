<B>__{later}
<A>__{siri comes over as susan grabs steel tongs and a cork dissecting board.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i'm gonna pull it out and i want you to pin it down, okay?}
<C>__{siri}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i have no idea. are you ready?}
<A>__{siri nods, pins in hand. susan opens the lid and grabs the nymph with the tongs. the creature goes berserk, flailing its spindly limbs, buzzing and croaking, a milky substance foaming out of its body.}
<C>__{siri}
<D>__{oh my god...}
<A>__{susan deposits the insect onto the corkboard. siri tries to get a hold of it; but it twists out of the tongs and wraps its coarse legs around her hand!! a spider trapping a sparrow.}
<C>__{siri}
<D>__{shit!! get it! get it!}
<A>__{snap! it bites her hand between index and forefinger. susan pins the insect into the corkboard. it spins furiously, like a crazy lp record. susan gets a grip on it again with the tongs. siri uses more pins to secure it down.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(noticing siri's hand)}
<D>__{it bit you.}
<C>__{siri}
<D>__{no shit.}
<B>__{susan}
<A>__{leans to get a closer look at the nymph: deep dark brown, flat as a pancake, one rear leg broken, lower tail smashed. it squirms helplessly now, looking pitiful under the harsh overhead light.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{this wing configuration. i've never...}
<C>__{siri}
<P>__{(looking at her injury)}
<D>__{fuck! it broke the skin...}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{and they're not fully developed. this thing's not even an adult.}
<A>__{the nymph continues to hiss and foam, struggling against the steel pins. susan looks closely at the insect's belly.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{my god.}
<C>__{siri}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{susan gestures to look. siri stares down at the nymph's torso where a set of valves on its underside click in and out.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{it's breathing.}
<B>__{siri}
<A>__{shakes her head.}
<C>__{siri}
<D>__{that's impossible. insects don't...}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i know.}
<P>__{(picks up a scalpel)}
<D>__{help me get a sample.}
<A>__{susan touches her scalpel to the nymph's leg. the nymph clicks nervously.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{hold on, big guy, hold on...}
<A>__{she traps the nymph down and cuts the leg off. a painful, agonized buzz echoes around the room.}
