<A>__{mcmurphy starts tossing packages of cigarettes into the mass of struggling bodies as washington grabs mcmurphy by the arm and tries to wheel him away. mcmurphy shakes him off and throws a pack of cigarettes in washington's face. washington goes after mcmurphy, grabs him, and drives him against the wall, right next to bromden, who watches as mcmurphy shoves washington away, goes into a crouch and starts circling washington. washington dances in and out, chipping away at mcmurphy's face until mcmurphy drives his fist square into washington's white, starched chest, drawing him against the wall. mcmurphy moves in for the kill.}

<D>__{warren! miller!}
<A>__{the acutes have stopped fighting and are watching. mcmurphy tags washington, then is grabbed from behind by warren, who pulls him back. washington moves in and goes to work on mcmurphy, when bromden grabs washington, from behind, in a bear hug. miller jumps on bromden's back. bromden, still holding washington, backs up into the wall, squashing miller, who screams out.}
