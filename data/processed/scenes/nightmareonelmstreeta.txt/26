<A>__{she brakes in the middle of the alley and whirls around. listening. shivering in the same thin slashed nightgown. a sharp crank of metal, and fifty feet down the alley the lid of an ash can rolls from the dark like a huge tin coin and spirals noisily down. low reverse across lid to tina. despite herself she comes over and touches it. she comes up with long worms on her fingers. next moment the exact same shambling man from her nightmare staggers into view fifty feet behind her. tina falls back into the shadows, shaking the worms off her fingers in repulsion. the man turns and starts directly for her, something shining on his right hand as he spreads his arms wide. he starts scraping the steel fingernails along a cinderblock wall. orange sparks spurt out his arms elongate until they reach from one side of the alley to the other and tina is cut off from her home! close on her as the scraping of the blades gets louder and closer. she begins to shake uncontrollably.}

<A>__{he holds up his steel tipped hand like a surgical steel spider. tina runs for her life. wider angle in the alley a terrifying, all out footrace between the girl and her pursuer. the man is fast; the distance between them closes with each heartbeat. tina overturns ashcans claws her way through a rotten back fence, hammers against a window. ashen faces appear, recoil, pull curtains closed and disappear in fright.}
