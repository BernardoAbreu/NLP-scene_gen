<L>__{exterior day. morton jane's cottage.}
<A>__{jane is in her scullery putting all her energy into scrubbing dishes.}
<C>__{mrs fairfax }
<D>__{jane eyre is requested to send references and all particulars to mrs fairfax at thornfield hall.}
<A>__{jane closes her eyes, trying to banish her thoughts. it is no good. the memories crowd in.}
<L>__{interior night. thornfield the ground floor.}
<A>__{a smiling lady dressed in black approaches her through the darkness mrs alice fairfax.}
<C>__{mrs fairfax}
<D>__{how do you do, my dear? what a long and tedious journey you must have had of it. john is quite the slowest driver in the county. you must be cold to the bone.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{are you mrs fairfax?}
<C>__{mrs fairfax}
<D>__{indeed i am; come and warm yourself in here.}
<A>__{mrs fairfax leads jane up the dark corridor and into a cosy parlour. leah, a young maidservant, follows.}
<C>__{mrs fairfax }
<D>__{your poor hands must be quite numb; here, let me help you.}
<A>__{mrs fairfax undoes the ribbon on jane's bonnet. jane is taken aback, unused to motherliness of any kind.}
<C>__{mrs fairfax }
<D>__{leah, make a little hot port and cut a sandwich or two.}
<A>__{leah eyes jane with great curiosity. she hurries away.}
<C>__{mrs fairfax}
<D>__{draw nearer the fire. john is taking your trunk up to your room.}
<A>__{knitting apparatus lies abandoned on a fireside chair. mrs fairfax moves it and gestures for jane to sit.}
<C>__{mrs fairfax }
<D>__{i've put you at the back of the house; i hope you don't mind. the rooms at the front have much finer furniture but they are so gloomy and solitary i think.}
<A>__{jane can't help noticing that every surface is covered in lace, embroidery, or fine crochet. the whole room is an advertisement for mrs fairfax's skill at handicrafts and testament to the hours she has spent alone.}
<C>__{mrs fairfax }
<D>__{i'm so glad you are come. to be sure this is a fine old house but i must confess that in winter one can feel a little dreary and alone. leah is a very nice girl and john and martha good people too, but they are servants and one cannot talk to them on terms of equality.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{am i to have the pleasure of meeting miss fairfax tonight?}
<C>__{mrs fairfax}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{miss fairfax my pupil?}
<C>__{mrs fairfax}
<D>__{oh you mean miss varens; mr rochester's ward. she is to be your pupil.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{who is mr rochester?}
<C>__{mrs fairfax}
<D>__{why, the owner of thornfield.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i thought thornfield hall belonged to you.}
<C>__{mrs fairfax}
<P>__{(bursting into laughter)}
<D>__{oh bless you child, what an idea. to me? i am only the housekeeper.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{forgive me }
<C>__{mrs fairfax}
<D>__{there is a distant connection between mr rochester and i his mother was a fairfax but i'd never presume on it. heavens, me, owner of thornfield?}
<A>__{she continues to laugh. a bashful smile is playing on jane's lips. mrs fairfax is beginning to thaw her.}
