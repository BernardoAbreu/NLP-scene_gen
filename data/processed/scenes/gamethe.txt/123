"game over" is the first one we see in the foyer, above the harlequin, who still sits in the only upright chair... but now a glossy black and white photo is stuck in its teeth. schuyler pulls out the picture, looks at it, hand trembling a police photo of mr. van orton, his body sprawled in a pool of blood. it's stamped "property sfpd" in red...}
