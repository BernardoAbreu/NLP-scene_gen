<A>__{emma (60s, american). the older woman in the picture from karen's file. she's lying on her stomach on a stained mattress, feebly looking up at karen.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{oh my god... are you alright? }
<A>__{karen immediately kneels down next to the infirm woman, helping her sit up. emma looks dazed and disoriented. karen's eyes sweep the room. it reeks of neglect.}
<L>__{9 exterior the house porch day}
<A>__{emma sits on the back porch, staring vacantly. but her expression isn't simply blank there's an odd sadness there. karen is washing the dirty sheets in a bucket and hanging them to dry. she finishes, turning to her charge.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{okay, emma. let's try again: my name is karen. do you remember? i'm from the health center. i'm substituting for yoko, just for today.}
<A>__{emma doesn't respond and there's no indication that she remembers karen introducing herself before. kneeling in front of emma, karen notices a band aid around one of her fingers. blood has soaked through it.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{looks like you need a new band aid. how'd this happen, emma?}
<P>__{(still no reaction)}
<D>__{would you like a bath? maybe that will help you feel better.}
<A>__{emma doesn't even turn towards her.}
