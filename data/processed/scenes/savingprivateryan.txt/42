<A>__{the seven americans walk along a hedgerow lane, untouched by war. spreading trees arch gently over the lane which is lined with hedgerows, thick, rooted masses, impenetrable, hundred of years old. miller sees smoke ahead. he motions to the men. they advance. exterior french farm day a burning house and barn. an old french farmer kneels on the ground, weeping, next to this slaughtered family, two adult women, an adult male and a boy, no more than ten. his animals, a pair of cows and a draft horse and some pigs are dead as well, shot to pieces. a dead american paratrooper lies sprawled in the dirt with empty shell casings around his body. miller and his men approach carefully. miller motions to upham who squats down next to the french farmer and speaks gently to him in french. the farmer speaks softly as if in a trance. upham stands and translates.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{five nights ago, he found this paratrooper caught in a tree with a broken leg. the leg got infected. last night he went to ville cholet to get a doctor. the doctor refused to come and when he got back, this is what he found. the krauts must have shown up while he was gone.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{did he see any sign of them?}
<A>__{upham gently asks. the farmer answers.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{no, but he heard firing, just east, less that a kilometer.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{thank him and tell him we're sorry about his loss.}
<A>__{miller heads off without glancing back. the men hesitate. sarge jerks his head for them to move out. they do so. upham squats down and speaks softly to the farmer, puts his hand on the man's shoulder, then rises and follows the others.}
