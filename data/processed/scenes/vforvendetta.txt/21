<L>__{exterior new government building}
<A>__{a massive modern building that is the seat of the new government. a long, black car pulls up to the entrance. adam susan gets out, wearing a long black trenchcoat over his pajamas. he is the leader and he looks older, heavier, and meaner. he hurries past the heavily armed guards, barely acknowledging the snap and cock of their nazi like salute.}
<L>__{interior leader's office}
<A>__{the leader enters his main chambers and we see the fate computer system. it is a cerebral cortex for a vast intelligence network. information can almost be felt coursing through its hard drives. the leader sits, at once regaining a measure of composure. he takes a deep calming breath and accesses the system. dozens of monitors fill with images from all across the city, most of them are of the damage caused by v.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{gentlemen, i will hear your reports now. mr. heyer, speak for the eye.}
<A>__{conrad heyer appears on one of the screens. he is at his desk inside the command center for the eye, the governmental organization responsible for the visual surveillance systems.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{we have less than two minutes of usable footage, leader. it took the suspect less than a minute to dispatch the finger's vice patrol.}
<A>__{on an insert screen, we see grainy footage of v rescuing evey from one of the pole mounted cameras.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{as you can see, the suspect's reflex speed is extraordinary. as is his strength.}
<A>__{as the last body falls, v seems to pause and looks back over his shoulder straight into the camera.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{freeze it!}
<A>__{the leader stares at the smiling face.}
<C>__{conrad}
<D>__{i'm afraid the mask makes retinal identification impossible.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{mr. etheridge, report for the ear!}
<A>__{bunny etheridge appears on another screen. behind him, huge spooling reels of audiotape wind constantly.}
<C>__{etheridge}
<D>__{we were able to triangulate the origin of the fireworks. we also are currently monitoring a lot of phone surveillance indicating a high percentage of conversation concerned with the explosions. all suspect or significant transcripts are being forwarded to mr. almond.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{very good. mr. finch, speak for the nose.}
<A>__{finch, no longer the same young man, stands at the site of the fireworks launch.}
<C>__{finch}
<D>__{thanks to etheridge, we found the launch for the fireworks. these appear to be individually weighted flares and we have found traces of the same chemicals at both of the detonation sites which leads us to conclude that, despite a level of sophistication, these devices are all home made with over the counter chemicals, making them impossible to trace. whoever he is, leader, he's good.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{thank you for that professional annotation.}
<A>__{an intercom opens.}
<C>__{lieutenant }
<D>__{leader, mr. almond has arrived.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{very good. gentlemen, keep me informed of any further developments. england prevails.}
<A>__{they answer in unison as almond enters the office. his face is harder but he has the same violent gleam in his eye. the leader turns in his chair.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{mr. almond, do you know what this is behind me?}
<C>__{almond}
<D>__{uh... the fate computer system, sir?}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{no. no sir. it's more than that. this, this computer is a symbol, mr. almond. a symbol of the highest attainable goal of mankind. do you know what that goal is, mr. almond?}
<A>__{almond does not. the leader leaps from his chair while pounding the desk.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{control, mr. almond! control! the world around us is a changing, directionless, amoral morass and it is up to man and man alone to set things right!}
<A>__{he moves around the desk at almond.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{without control, man is nothing more than any other stinking, sweating, brute animal. control, mr. almond. the control that we have painstakingly built up over the last ten years. now, do you understand what happened last night?}
<C>__{almond}
<D>__{we... lost control.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{yes, mr. almond. last night someone did the unthinkable. someone hurt us. it is imperative that we act swiftly and precisely. i want that man found, mr. almond. i want his head or, by god, i will have yours.}
