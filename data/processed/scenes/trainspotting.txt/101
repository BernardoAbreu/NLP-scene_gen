<L>__{interior court. day}
<A>__{spud and renton stand in the dock. renton's mother and father, sick boy, begbie, and spud's mother (mrs. murphy) are among those in the gallery. the sheriff delivers his sentence.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{...because shoplifting is theft, which is a crime, and, despite what you may believe, there is no such entity as victimless crime. heroin addiction may explain your actions, but it does not excuse them. mr murphy, you are a habitual thief, devoid of regret or remorse. in sentencing you to six months' imprisonment my only worry is that it will not be long before we meet again. mr renton, i understand that you have entered into a programme of rehabilation in an attempt to wean yourself away from heroin. the suspension of your sentence is conditional upon your continued cooperation with this programme. should you stand guilty before me again, i shall not hesitate to impose a custodial sentence.}
<C>__{renton}
<D>__{thank you, your honour. with god's help, i will conquer this affliction.}
<A>__{the sheriff and renton stare at one another for a moment. renton turns to look at spud, then back towards the sheriff, who is now leaving the court.}
<P>__{(v.o)}
<D>__{what can you say? well, begbie had a phrase for it.}
