<A>__{chaos. men, half naked, bounce from their cubicle. pulling on their pants, digging into shoes.}

<D>__{that's what he said. now! move!}
<A>__{bennings is off.}
<L>__{interior tunnel}
<A>__{as the men approach the locked kennel door. the two dogs, thrown into clark, back ferociously and scratch at the door trying to get back in. one is badly bloodied. the fight inside rages on. macready and clark brace themselves by the narrow door. norris and garry hold back the two hysterical dogs. clark undoes the latch and he and macready enter the kennel. the light has been broken and it is pitch black. macready snaps on his flashlight. norris and garry can't contain their animals and the dogs burst into the room. they smash into macready and send him sprawling. total confusion: the dogs; the men; the screeching; the blackness.}
<C>__{clark}
<D>__{mac, where are you?}
<A>__{macready gropes for his flashlight and rights himself. he finds clark. then shines it around the cramped room trying to get his bearings. the light finds a mass of dogs in a wild melee in the corner. barking mixed with hissing, a gurgling, a screeching. dogs being hurled about and then charging back into the fray with a vengeance. the flashlight illuminates parts of some "thing." a dog. but not quite. impossible to tell. it struggles powerfully. garry pokes his head into the blackness.}
<C>__{garry}
<D>__{what's going on, damn it?}
<A>__{macready aims his shotgun at the entire pack.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{i'm going to shoot.}
<C>__{clark}
<D>__{no! wait!!}
<A>__{clark wades into the pack, grabs at dogs' hides and throws them back. he then wields his ax into the fray, chopping and hacking away at the gurgling, hissing silhouette. from out of nowhere, a large, bristly, arachnid like leg springs up and wraps around clark's ax. it sends clark smashing violently into the wall.}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{more men running, nearing the kennel. several squeezing in with garry, trying to get a look.}
<B>__{inside}
<A>__{macready fires several rounds. a dog is flung at him, knocking him and his flashlight once more to the ground. garry squeezes in and begins blasting away in the direction of the hissing and screeching. a dog is hit. macready crawls for his flashlight.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{clark? where are you? clark!}
<A>__{blam. blam. garry continues firing at the silhouette.}
