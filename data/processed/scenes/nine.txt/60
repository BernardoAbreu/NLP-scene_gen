<D>__{yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap, yap!}
<A>__{guido leaps over the balcony and lies down on a table. performance mode off. lilli nods to roberta to leave. roberta puts down her work and clears the room quietly, leaving them alone.}
<C>__{guido }
<D>__{what are we doing here?}
<C>__{lilli}
<D>__{i'm happy. i brought my swimsuit.}
<A>__{lilli is working at a mannequin, hand sewing some sequins on a costume. a red feathered boa is draped on the figure.}
<C>__{lilli }
<D>__{it was luisa's birthday yesterday.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{what? no. oh please god. no. i spoke with her yesterday. she didn't even mention it. give me a cigarette.}
<A>__{lilli points to the one in guido's hand.}
<C>__{lilli}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{guido sees the costume.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{lilli}
<D>__{it's for claudia.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{for which scene?}
<C>__{lilli}
<D>__{well i don't know which scene until i`ve seen the script, but she always likes something like this, or you do.}

<C>__{guido}

<C>__{lilli}
<D>__{oh guido, don't. that's death. every time we have to start again.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{i'm trying to find it.}
<C>__{lilli}
<D>__{you won't find it with your head jammed halfway up your ass.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{ashtray.}
<A>__{she produces one.}
<C>__{guido }
<D>__{thanks. you were saying my head is jammed up my ass.}
<C>__{lilli}
<D>__{halfway. i don't know. why not dream up something entertaining, guido? something with music...with dancing... god knows, we could use a little joie de vivre around here...}
