<L>__{interior hospital corridor and room day}
<A>__{holden is laid out in an apparatus that resembles an iron lung. a little above his head, facing him, is a bank of bio feedback lights registering body functions. deckard is in a chair sitting next to his friend. holden has lost weight, his face is grey, he can't move his head, but he's smiling like the cat who ate the canary.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{how are you doing, old man?}
<A>__{holden's voice is just a whisper the kind of whisper that comes out of the joker at the back of the class.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i'm great. i mean, i know i'm not really great, but i feel just great. how you like my new suit?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{well, you don't have to worry about getting it wrinkled.}
<A>__{holden's eyes close, his smile gets bigger and little spasms of laughter pump out of his mouth.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{don't make me laugh. it makes me pee.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{hey, it's okay. i like to pee. so how are you doing?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i'm doing okay.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{from what i hear you're doing great. bryant tells me you're going like a god damn one man army. making a lot of money, huh?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{yeah.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{but that's what i wanted to talk to you about.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{money?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{no. i got a problem.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{let's hear it.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i think i'm starting to empathize with these nexus sixes.}
<A>__{holden giggles. starts to laugh again. a blue light on the panel begins to turn very bright. they both notice it.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i'm taking a piss.}
<A>__{they wait for the light to abate.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{let me ask you something, deck. you been having intimate relations with one of these units?}
<A>__{deckard doesn't deny it. holden smiles like a cherub.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{that's what i thought... one of the liabilities of the trade you has sex with your prey, old buddy. that's bound to create problems, unless you're a black widow.}
<A>__{deckard has to wait for him to stop giggling.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{what about not sex but love?}
<A>__{holden bites his bottom lip to keep the laugher out of his voice, but he can't.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{love is just another name for sex. love is sexy and sex is lovely i don't care what you call it, an android can't have it.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{these aren't just...}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i know what they are, deck look, maybe they can pretend to feel, but far as the raw, hot emotions of the old heart no way.}
<A>__{holden stops talking for a moment to get some air.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{believe me, take it from an old pro, no matter how good we get, we're never gonna make an artificial anything that can feel. it's a contradiction. you might as well go fuck your washing machine.}
<A>__{holden laughs, deckard doesn't.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{just go out there and keep up the good work.}
<A>__{holden's whispers have become harder to hear.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{got to save it, deck, i'm getting sleepy. it's been good talking to you.}
<A>__{deckard stands.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{but he's already asleep. deckard stands there a moment looking at him, then walks out.}
