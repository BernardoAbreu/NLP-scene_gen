<D>__{ferris on monitor i'm afraid we need you to sit.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{why? ferris on monitor why not?}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{i know what happens. ferris on monitor tell us.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{you tie me down and never let me out.}
<A>__{wisdom looks at ferris. she shrugs, sheepish.}
<D>__{ferris that's only because you won't cooperate.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{because you're trying to force me. ferris work with us, cris, and you can be a hero. fight us, and things will get worse and worse.}
<A>__{cris squints, frustrated, looking for a way out.}

<P>__{(severe)}
<D>__{now sit in the chair. one. two. three.}
<A>__{ferris switches the toggle. the sizzle of electricity. cris hops and jumps in agony. ferris turns away, then makes herself look.}

<D>__{whoa, you are one tough bitch.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{we're still in a code red if i'm not mistaken.}
<A>__{she turns off the juice.}
<C>__{wisdom}
<D>__{he knew he'd get shocked, but he chose to resist.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{he's almost never had to face consequences.}
<P>__{(flips toggle)}
<D>__{cris, are you ready to get in the chair?}
<A>__{cris, recovering, shoots her the finger. she switches the toggle again and leaves it on. wisdom doesn't have the stomach to watch.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{we need information, right?}
<A>__{cris collapses, unconscious.}
<C>__{ferris}
<D>__{leave him there. we'll start again when he recovers.}
