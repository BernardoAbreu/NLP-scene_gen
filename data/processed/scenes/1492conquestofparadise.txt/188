<L>__{exterior camp sunset}
<A>__{a magnificent sunset. a fire is burning, food cooking. columbus looks over his maps, trying to figure out where they are. we see the outline of the continent of asia. an old indian squats beside him, silent, also looking at the map. then, slowly and very deliberately, he takes a piece of charcoal from the fire and begins to draw on the map. ignoring the asian continent, he sketches the panamanian coastline an isthmus. mendez and fernando gather round. columbus watches the old indian with initial puzzlement, then growing excitement.}
<C>__{mendez}
<D>__{what's he doing?}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{he's drawing an isthmus... he's saying we're on an isthmus.}
<C>__{mendez}
<D>__{we can't be.}
<A>__{fernando is still confused. the old indian continues to sketch, talking quietly all the time. an indian translator listens.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{tell me what he's saying.}
<C>__{translator}
<D>__{he says water on the other side.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{ask him if he means a lake. a big lake.}
<A>__{the translator asks. the old indian shakes his head, laughs, points to the west, way beyond the other lakes, emphatically.}
<C>__{translator}
<D>__{no. says those are lakes. water on other side big as wide as here. above and below, much land.}
<C>__{columbus}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{an ocean...? he's says it's an ocean?}
<C>__{fernando}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<A>__{columbus is too stunned for a moment to explain. the indians laugh. then columbus takes the charcoal, and begins to draw on the map, for his son.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{here is europe... and over here, the continent of asia. but there's something in between! another continent! we've found... another continent!}
<A>__{fernando stares west, then back at his father. columbus looks very feverish, his face bathed with sweat.}
<C>__{fernando}
<D>__{father...}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{there must be a passage to that other ocean.}
