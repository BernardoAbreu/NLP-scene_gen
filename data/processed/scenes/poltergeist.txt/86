<A>__{her pov inside the room inside is a junk pile of shattered furniture and toys. the window is boarded up. objects are in motion throughout the room... the bed is hopping about, records are flying, a lamp sails through. the clown is seated upside down on the boxspring as it spins. children’s picture books flapping their covers like wings, cruise the upper reaches. a horse flies by. finally, a spinning compass plays a record while flying toward the roar of the room, creating an eerie melody. close panning dr. lesh, tak and ryan all semblance of clinical cool is gone. they are blown away.}
