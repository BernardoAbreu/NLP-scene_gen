<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior bar night}
<A>__{it is very late and very gloomy. just a couple of loners staring into their drinks. the bartender is up one end of the counter, smoking and reading the sports pages. there is a t.v. on above the bar, showing baseball. bean and david are sitting up at the bar. the latter has had far too much whisky and looks the worse for it. bean has a tall glass packed with fruit and paper umbrellas. we can guess how much he's had to drink by the way he has difficulty finding the straw with his mouth. david almost, but not quite, slurs his words:}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's just a matter of acceptance, isn't it ... lose your job lose you wife ... c'est la vie. you ever been married, bean?}
<A>__{he turns to bean who has the end of a straw up his nose.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i guess not.}
<A>__{he fills his glass from a bottle.}
<D>__{you know, i don't get it. the new artist exhibition this year people might not all have liked the dead sheep, but ... the place didn't look that empty to me. it wasn't full but i saw people. i just don't understand how the gallery can be so bankrupt they have to sell the whistler.}
<A>__{he looks at bean who now has peanuts in each nostril. david notices the bartender looking at bean strangely ....}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{he's english, okay? you wanna make something of it?}
<A>__{bartender goes back to reading. david searches for his last train of thought, taking a huge swig from his drink.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{... to hell with the figures. i'm not a damn accountant. i'm an artist. you know, me and ali met in art school? i cut quite a figure then. far cry from the man you see before you now. then, i smoked gitanes before i went to bed, to help me sort out the problems of the world. now, i take a spoonful of laxative before i go to bed to help me sort out the problem with my bowels.}
<A>__{bean at that moment is keen to show david his nut trick. he throws a peanut high into the air and catches it in his mouth. then does two. then does it with his eyes closed. actually, it's rather impressive.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{truth is, i disappointed her. i turned out to have no spine. spineless. a kind of medical miracle. mr flippy floppy. i just don't seem to be able to fight cant stick up for myself. too nice. i mean, i should never have let you come stay and i should be handing you over to the police right now. shall i tell you something, beanie ...}
<A>__{bean has been interested all this, even looking to check whether david does indeed have no spine. but now the baseball on the tv is making it hard for him to concentrate on this important confidence. he raises a finger, for david to be quiet for a second. he blows a peanut from his, nostril at the t.v. it hits the button, and changes station to a pleasant quiet music station.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{do you want to know what the reality of the situation is?}
<A>__{bean nods his head, very curious, listening hard.}
<D>__{this is it. because you moved into my house, my wife has left me. she might have done it anyway but you were the ten ton weight that broke the camel's spinal column.}
<A>__{bean stares at david something is getting in he's actually registering this.}
<D>__{that's point one. and point two is that you've destroyed whistler's mother, which was' the last hope for the place where i work. so within a week, i'm going to lose my job as well.}
<A>__{bean nods, seriously dispirited.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{so, you've totally and utterly destroyed my life. do you understand? you've put me in a position where it would have been better if i'd never been born.}
<A>__{he puts his hand on bean's shoulder. bean looks down. very sad. this is actually the first time in his life that he's realised that his actions have really effected the life of another person. bean looks up sadly. sad music plays.}
