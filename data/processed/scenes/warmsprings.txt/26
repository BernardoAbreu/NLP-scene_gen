<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior sun room day}
<A>__{franklin lays on a chaise being examined by a doctor, who leans over him holding out his hand.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{can you take my hand?}
<A>__{franklin tries, but can't. almost his entire body is paralyzed. he can only breathe and blink. the doctor glances at eleanor, louis and sara indicating they should follow him out.}
<L>__{exterior screened porch day}
<A>__{as the door from the sun room opens onto the porch, elliot is there waiting. seeing them coming, he dashes off into the yard so as not to be seen as eleanor, louis, sara and the doctor enter.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{he has infantile paralysis. polio.}
<A>__{sara sinks into a chair.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i knew it. i knew it.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{i thought it only struck children.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{not necessarily.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{how did he get it?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{some experts believe it is linked to contaminated water. but that theory is speculative at best.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{it was the visit to that god damned boy scout camp!}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{in all honesty you need to be looking forward, not back.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{what is the prognosis?}
<C>__{dr. lovett}
<D>__{the damage to his leg muscles is extensive. i suspect he will be paralyzed from the waist down.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{dear god.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and the children?}
<C>__{dr. lovett}
<D>__{if they don't have any symptoms by now then they have been spared.}
<A>__{sara stands her bearing once again erect and proud.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{then we must count our blessings.}
<C>__{dr. lovett}
<D>__{you will need to prepare yourselves. there is a deep depression that follows an illness of this magnitude. i'm afraid life as he knew it is over.}
<A>__{their discussion is suddenly interrupted by the sound of a child crying. eleanor rushes off the porch to the bushes.}
