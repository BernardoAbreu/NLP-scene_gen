<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior desert later}
<A>__{a long line of footprints works their way through the sand up to epps, jaeger, and wes. epps and wes trek side by side. jaeger is behind them, having trouble keeping up. between pants he gasps:}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{hey...hey! slow up. you don't have to go so fast.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{faster we get there, faster we get back.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{yeah. i know. i'm with you.}
<A>__{jaeger struggles on just a bit more, then:}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i'm gonna...i'm just gonna stop for a little water.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{don't drink up all of yours, 'cause you aren't getting any of ours.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i'm just going to have a little sip, that's all. just a sip.}
<A>__{jaeger lets himself drop down into the sand. he looks up. epps and wes are still walking.}
<P>__{jager{cont)}
<D>__{wait for me!}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you can catch up.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{yeah...i'm right behind you.}
<A>__{wes looks back at jaeger sitting on the ground sucking on his water.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{thanks for straightening out jaeger.}
<A>__{epps shrugs, like hitting jaeger wasn't much of anything.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{maybe we are crazy for doing this. but if we do it, we do it right. i just needed to explain that in a way i wouldn't have to do it again.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{not much chance of that. jaeger's an idiot.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{he's not so }
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{he's an idiot, and he's not nearly as hard as he thinks.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{how tough you have to be to make the army? all you've got to do is shoot a gun, and stop a bullet.}
<A>__{again epps looks behind him as jaeger struggles to his feet and stumbles after his two comrades.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{look at him. we ought to just leave him behind.}
<A>__{epps gives a little laugh like he's just heard a mildly amusing punchline.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{like he said: people get lost in wars all the time. and out here? out here there are eight million ways to die.}
<A>__{all this talk starts to creep out epps a little.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{okay, so he was riding you. get over it.}
<A>__{wes smiles a little smile.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{i'm just talking.}
<A>__{they walk on. jaeger works to catch up, muttering to himself as he goes.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{can't even slow up for me. wasn't for me they wouldn't even be here. i'm the one that found the map. should have just come by myself. should've. shouldn't even cut them in. shouldn't.}
<A>__{as jaeger steps down be hears an audible clicking sound come from under his boot. he goes dead still. panic races up and down his spine. in almost a whisper be says:}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{epps...}
<A>__{again, louder:}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{epps!}
<A>__{like he couldn't be more annoyed epps turns around.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{what!?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{mine.}
<A>__{epps isn't sure of what he's heard.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{mine. land mine!}
<A>__{epps doesn't say anything, he just keeps on staring. scared, angry they don't get it:}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i stepped on a land mine!}
<A>__{epps and wes look at each other, then back to jaeger. like he's got no time to mess around:}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you didn't step on any mine.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i heard it click.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{if you stepped on a mine you'd be dead by now. nobody uses delayed fuse mines anymore.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i heard it.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{maybe it's just a can, or something.}
<A>__{jaeger loses it.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{jesus christ, i'm standing on a mine. shut up, and get over here!}
<A>__{just plain sick of all this, epps and wes trudge back over to jaeger.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{paranoid, that's your problem. you're just paranoid. why'd the paranoid one have to find the map?}
<A>__{epps pulls a knife from his belt. he sinks to the ground and probes the sand under jaeger's foot. nothing...nothing... we hear the sound of metal against metal. epps goes white. for a second he doesn't move. tension falls like a steel curtain. slow, careful, epps withdraws the blade and stands. jaeger reads the expression on epps' face.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{oh, god! oh god!}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{just be cool.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{it's a mine, isn't it?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{just relax.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{how'm i gonna relax standing on a mine!?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we're going to get off, all right. we'll get you off of there. just...be cool.}
<A>__{epps goes to wes. the two start to move away from jaeger.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{where you going?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{me and wes are just going to talk.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{why you got to move away to talk!?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we're going to be right over here.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{you're moving away because it's going to blow up, isn't it!? it's going to blow up!}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i said be cool, all right? now be cool!}
<A>__{epps and wes move over and huddle.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{what kind of mine?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i don't know, and i wasn't about to mess with it.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{should have blown already. delayed fuse, that's vietnam stuff.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{maybe that's all the iraqis could afford, okay? maybe they got it on discount. maybe the fuse is messed up. or maybe it's going to go off in two seconds, and we won't have to worry about getting jaeger down off there, all we'll have to worry about is finding the pieces.}
<A>__{behind them, pathetically, jaeger cries:}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{epps...}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{doesn't matter. we're not going to be able to get him off it anyway.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{there's a way.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{epps...}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{can't do it. can't do it, and keep him alive.}
<A>__{epps' eyes narrow. he doesn't want to hear this kind of talk.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i said nobody dies. nobody dies.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{epps, my leg is falling asleep.}
<A>__{epps thinks, and thinks hard.}
<C>__{epps}
<P>__{(to wes)}
<D>__{we've got rope?}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{for climbing.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{break it out.}
<A>__{epps crosses back over to jaeger.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{my leg is falling asleep.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{it's not falling asleep. you've only been standing there for three minutes.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i'm the one who can feel my leg, and it's falling asleep.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{it falls asleep and you die, so wake it the hell up.}
<A>__{wes crosses over with climbing rope. very, very gently epps wraps the middle of the rope around jaeger's waist leaving several feet dangling off each end.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{how's this going to work?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{me and wes each going take an end of the rope, run our asses of, and yank you off the mine.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{that's going to do it, right? i'm going to be okay.}
<A>__{not too convincingly:}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you're going to be fine.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{you're not going to let me die, are you!? don't let me die!}
<A>__{ignoring the question:}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{when we start running suck up your breath. you're going to get the wind knocked out of you.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{don't let me die, epps. i don't want to die.}
<A>__{epps and wes pick up separate ends of the rope, and take up positions behind jaeger. epps waits a beat, afraid of what might happen, but there is no choice. he digs in ready to take off running. wes whispers to him:}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{what if it's a valloro 69? just going to bounce right up out of the ground, explode in the air, kill him and us.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you just go when i say go.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{should have at least gotten the map off of him. blows up with him then we did all this for nothing.}
<A>__{ignoring him:}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{ready?}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{epps takes a couple of deep breaths, holds one:}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{go!}
<A>__{wes and epps are off the the races, churning up sand as they race away from jaeger. they scream like banshees as if to draw strength. jaeger does a little chant:}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{oh, god. oh, god!}
<A>__{the rope goes taught. jaeger's body jerks violently backward as he gets the air punched out of him. as his feet leave the ground the mine detonates.}
