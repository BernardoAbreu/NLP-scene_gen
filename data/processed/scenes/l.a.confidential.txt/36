<A>__{followed by jack, bud forces his way through the crowd. the men who see it's him quickly clear a path. swigging from a pint of gin, stensland works skinny garcia. head saps. the kid drops to his knees drooling blood. bud grabs stensland, hauls him off of garcia who looks up.}

<D>__{fuck you, pendejo .}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{yeah yeah...}
<C>__{garcia}
<D>__{and fuck your mother too.}
<A>__{bud sees red. letting go of stensland, bud white picks up garcia by the neck. there are cheers, "attaboys" and "holy fucks" as bud bangs garcia's head on the ceiling.}

<D>__{stop, officer! that's an order!}
<A>__{cops block exley's way. as bud looks over, garcia kicks him in the balls. a dangling shot. bud keels into the bars, garcia stumbles out of the cell, smack into jack. jack looks down aghast at blood on his cashmere blazer, then puts garcia down with a left right. exley pulls a pad of paper and pen form his pocket.}

<C>__{exley }
<D>__{let me out! that's an order!}
<B>__{cell block}
<A>__{the herald reporter and photographer enter unchaperoned and unnoticed. stensland swings like a madman. that's when a flashbulb goes off. freezing everyone in black and white.}
