<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior sleep lab pre dawn}
<A>__{the wall clock says it's not quite 3 am, yet julie has managed to round up all her co workers: alice, hutch, clarissa, et al. they're groggy, disheveled, un made up, unshaven. but they're there.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{six hours. that's when they pull the plug. that's how long we've got to wake him up.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now these are stu's old charts from five years ago, when he first came to the sleep lab...}
<A>__{she points to a series of easels where hutch and alice have been tacking up eeg printouts, engram maps, etc.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{...they show incredibly intense nightmare activity. the chart below is his new chart...}
<A>__{the lower chart shows a jagged spike virtually identical to the one on the upper chart. julie pauses for effect then pulls on the edge of the lower chart, opening it up like a gatefold the onlookers gasp. opened accordion style, the lower chart shows the same spike recurring again and again, ten times over!}
<C>__{hutch}
<D>__{holy shit.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{he's stuck in a loop a nightmare loop.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{anybody here know what oneirix is?}
<C>__{clarissa}
<D>__{sure it's an enzyme. the brain secretes it during violent dream activity...}
<C>__{hutch}
<D>__{it's nightmare juice. julie and i were on the team that learned to synthesize it. if those charts are right, stu's swimming in the stuff.}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{are you thinking we can decrease the levels?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{no. i want to give him more. i want to give him a massive dose.}
<C>__{hutch}
<D>__{that's not going to stop his nightmare }
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i don't want to stop the nightmare, hutch. i want to crank it up. i want to take it right off the charts. i want to scare him awake.}
<A>__{the group exchanges nervous glances: it's risky. julie claps her hands:}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{all right! we have a plan. let's move!}
<A>__{as the group swings into action, hutch pulls julie aside.}
<C>__{hutch}
<D>__{you know, julie, even if this works which it probably won't that stuff is tricky. you don't know what it'll do to his brain.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{what'll it do if they pull the plug?}
