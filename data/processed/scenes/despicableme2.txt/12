<L>__{int: avl sub same}
<A>__{the water drains out from the holding dock. a buffer and hair dryer come out to dry off the car. a squeegee wipes off the windshield. then the platform the car is on lowers down.}
<L>__{int: avl room day}
<A>__{lucy's car lowers into the center of the room as a large circular table assembles around it, effectively locking them in. lucy and the minions get out of the car. she pushes a button on her remote and gru, with a starfish attached to his head, is ejected from the trunk.}
<C>__{gru}
<P>__{(groggily)}
<D>__{ugh...ooh...what...where...ah...oh, foot's asleep...ah...pins and needles...}
<C>__{silas }
<D>__{good afternoon, mr. gru.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{ehhh...}
<C>__{silas}
<D>__{i apologize for our methods in getting you here.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i don't. i'd do it again in a heartbeat. i am not gonna lie i enjoyed that. every second of it. gave me a bit of a buzz, actually.}
<C>__{silas}
<D>__{that's enough, agent wilde.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{sorry, sir.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{okay, this is bogus!}
<A>__{gru peels the starfish off his head and drops it onto tom's. stuart laughs at him.}
<C>__{gru }
<D>__{i don't know who you people think you are, but }
<A>__{a waiter comes over with tea for silas.}
<C>__{silas}
<D>__{we are the anti villain league.}
<A>__{as silas summons a map that shows all of the avl offices around the world, lucy's car drops out of the way. stuart is trapped on the lowering platform and he scrambles to get back onto stable ground. silas continues.}
<C>__{silas }
<D>__{an ultra secret organization dedicated to fighting crime on a global scale. rob a bank? we're not interested. kill someone? not our deal. but you want to melt the polar ice caps? or vaporize mt. fuji? or even steal the moon? then we notice.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{first of all, you've got no proof that i did that. second, after i did do that, i put it back!}
<C>__{silas}
<D>__{we're well aware of that, mr. gru. that's why we've brought you here.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i am the league's director, silas ramsbottom.}
<A>__{upon hearing the name, tom and stuart start giggling.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{bottom.}
<C>__{tom and stuart}
<D>__{heeheheeeeheeehee.}
<A>__{silas bristles at this, and glances over at lucy.}
<C>__{silas}
<D>__{hilarious. agent wilde...}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{oh, me now...?}
<A>__{she continues the de briefing, turning to the screens, which show an image of the magnet ship stealing the lab.}
<C>__{lucy }
<D>__{um, recently an entire top secret lab disappeared from the arctic circle. yeah, the entire lab. just whoosh. voom! gone. where did it go?}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{i don't care.}
<A>__{the screen shows footage of a tiny little bunny in a scientific lab. furry and adorable.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{the lab was devoted to experiments involving px 41, a transmutation serum. what is px 41, you ask? mmmm, it's pretty bad... look.}
<A>__{a labcoat technician approaches the bunny with a syringe containing the purple liquid. injects some in its butt.}
<C>__{tom and stuart}
<D>__{aaah!}
<A>__{instantly the bunny transforms into a hideous purple monster bunny. gru and the minions smile, impressed. then it goes crazy and attacks the scientist. gru covers his eyes and the minions pass out.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{oh!}
<A>__{the bunny attacks the technician, then the camera...and the film is over.}
<C>__{gru }
<D>__{hmm, you usually don't see that in bunnies.}
<C>__{silas}
<D>__{as you can see, in the wrong hands, the px 41 serum could be the most devastating weapon on earth.}
<P>__{(struggles to get through the opening in the table)}
<D>__{fortunately it has a very distinct chemical footprint, and using the latest chemtracking technology, we found traces of it in the paradise mall.}
<A>__{on the screens we see images depicting a highly technical diagram of the shopping mall.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{ha! a mall?}
<C>__{silas}
<D>__{precisely. and we believe that one of these shop owners is a master criminal.}
<A>__{silas scrolls through pictures of the mall's shop owners.}
<C>__{silas }
<D>__{and that's where you come in. as an ex villain, you know how a villain thinks, how a villain acts.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{the plan is to set you up undercover at a shop in the mall, where hopefully you'll be able to }
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{okay, i see where this is going, with all the mission impossible stuff, but no. no! i am a father now. and a legitimate businessman. i am developing a line of delicious jams and jellies.}
<A>__{silas shoots him a look. he chuckles.}
<C>__{silas}
<D>__{jams and...jellies?}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{oh, attitude! that's right! so thanks, but no thanks.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and here's a tip instead of tasing people and kidnapping them, maybe you should just give them a call! good day, mr. sheepsbutt!}
<C>__{silas}
<D>__{ramsbottom.}
<C>__{gru}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{oh, yeah, like that's any better!}
<A>__{gru turns and heads for the door, followed by tom and stuart, who continue to giggle about ramsbottom's name.}
