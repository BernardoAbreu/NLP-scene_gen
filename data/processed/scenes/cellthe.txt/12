<L>__{interior the cell observation room day}
<A>__{from the outside, a passerby would never know this sanctuary existed. within the foundation of a farm building never completed, we find a small room in the center of a much larger space. the cell. we hear the whir of electronic equipment and notice video cameras mounted on tripods pointed at the two way glass. we follow cables to a massive video recorder the type used in surveillance, able to record for days without maintenance, and an elaborate timing device connected to a series of valves and switches. as if in a beatific trance, the driver moves to the window and gently rests his palm on the glass. anne moves! arms flailing, mouth gasping, eyes filled with dread. the last spark of life... the driver jumps, startled and frightened. almost shamefully, he turns and hides, unable to look at her. suddenly, his body tenses and writhes, as if seized by torturous pain. he opens his mouth in a silent scream. and then, quickly as it came, the pain subsides. hidden in shadow, he breathes deeply, regaining self control. he waits, then moves back to the glass. anne's dead face floats past him. almost angelic. he watches her and leans his head against the window, closer. and the driver catches his own reflection in the mirror. meet carl stargher.}
