<L>__{exterior private airport day}
<A>__{doris the bus stays behind in the parking lot, abandoned near a field. the new plane lifts off in the background, as the bus sits alone, as if crying steel tears. bus banner reads simply: cleveland. reprise ending of whole lotta love.}
<L>__{interior plane night}
<A>__{the girls sit on the jumper seats at the back of the plane, with william.}
<L>__{interior boston hotel room hallway day}
<A>__{william trudges the hallway with tape recorder and notebook, trolling for russell. he passes boston travelogue posters on the walls. a few room doors are open, he looks for any sign of the guitarist. william veers into dick's room, where a poker game full of roadies is in progress. the room is thick with exotic smoke. they are a bunch of road hardened snobs, smoking cigars and other items, famous to themselves, listening not to rock and roll... but sarah vaughn.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{anyone seen russell?}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{the enemy!}
<A>__{door widens to reveal russell.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{hey! welcome to the road crew poker party. this game's been going of for two years.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{that's mick he's with the who. that's john with j. geils. and that's richard with the eagles... and you know the wheel.}
<C>__{the wheel}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{grumbling roadies continue playing. like an old pro, the kid turns down a cola can hash pipe. this hand is down to dick, and a roadie named reg from humble pie.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{side proposition. for fifty dollars and a case of heineken, i will put into the pot... three lovely ladies, including the famous penny lane... the band aids, who need to exit our tour before new york...}
<C>__{reg}
<D>__{it's a deal. show 'em.}
<A>__{dick lays down three tens. reg lays down three kings. dick loses.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{three lovely ladies... now in the custody of humble pie.}
<C>__{reg}
<D>__{alright, so we owe you fifty dollars and a case of heineken.}
<A>__{embarrassed, russell notices the kids face. he leans over, and speaks confidentially to him.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{look. nobody's feelings are getting hurt here. she already knows leslie's coming to new york tomorrow. they all understand. this is the circus. everybody's trying not to go home. nobody's saying goodbye.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{no, i got it.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{these are the rules that come with every electric guitar and every amplifier. they're not just written anywhere. rock and roll, brother. no attachments. no boundaries.}
<A>__{but the kid feels bad, and russell knows it.}
<C>__{russell }
<D>__{quit looking at me like that.}
