<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{the missing piece of the jigsaw. i tried to get you to give it to me as peter; i tried to steal it from you as dr. darling. as myself i will be a bit less subtle.}
<P>__{(he slips it off her finger; holds it up)}
<D>__{with this ring my plan will be complete.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{how wagnerian ... do you mean to say you've waited all these years because you couldn't create a chip on your own? that would have amused peter.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{speaking of peter, there's more good news: you won't even have to change your last name. you'll always be mrs. peel.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{what are my choices?}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{choices?}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{i will never marry you.}
<A>__{valentine is philosophical. he spins the sarcophagus on an axis, lying it flat emma lying in her coffin as he looks down at her }
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{one out of two isn't bad. i will keep you alive, darling emma. in a year or five, you may change your mind. if you're still in it.}
<A>__{valentine presses a button. from the ceiling a surgical laser. moves down to within inches of her face.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{this little toy gave me back my face. it can replace yours. what do you think? medusa? madame defarge? maggie thatcher?}
<A>__{he marks an imaginary line round emma's face. an alarm bell rings. emma reacts.}
<C>__{father }
<D>__{dr. darling, this is father. we have an intruder. i repeat }
<A>__{valentine switches off the pa.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{ah. that will be steed. he followed you. please excuse me. i have work to do. my most spectacular performance. a ballet of clouds. it was made for you. i want to give you a heart, emma. i want all of london to see it. and now with this ...}
<P>__{(flourishes ring)}
<D>__{they will.}
<P>__{(leans close)}
<D>__{and for an encore: the biggest cyclone in history will wipe the city from the face of the earth.}
<P>__{(winks)}
<D>__{shape of things to come, my darling.}
<A>__{he stuffs a gag into emma's mouth and closes the coffin on her muffled protests. darkness. immediately, steed tries to force his way through the grille. no such luck.}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{blast. what to do? mrs. peel!}
<A>__{he doesn't dare say her name too loud and there's no telling if she could hear him in that thing, anyway. he turns around in the tunnel heads the other way.}
