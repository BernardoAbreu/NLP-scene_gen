<A>__{jack continues along a long dark tunnel with baby tooth close behind. eventually the labyrinth opens up to reveal a huge underground cavern. baby tooth continues to tug at jack's tunic.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(waving baby tooth off)}
<D>__{baby tooth, baby...come on!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i have to find out what that is.}
<L>__{interior pitch's inner sanctum continuous}
<A>__{jack can't believe his eyes. dozens of huge bird cages hanging from the ceiling, and in them are the mini tooth fairies. they see jack, and immediately perk up, tweeting and flitting like crazy. jack jumps up onto one of the cages, then quickly leaps and holds onto the side of another one.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{shhhh! keep it down.}
<P>__{(leaps to another cage)}
<D>__{i'm gonna get you out of here, just as soon as i }

<D>__{jack...}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{as i can }
<A>__{jack looks down and sees the tooth drawers from tooth's palace. mounds of them heaped to the ceiling. and inside the drawers are the missing baby teeth. he drops down to a mound and begins rummaging through the drawers, looking at the names on the boxes. in an instant he forgets his duties, and the fairies, and the guardians and everything except those teeth, and the chance to finally get his memory back. the cavern suddenly goes darker than it already was. jack finally looks up, as a shadow of pitch crawls up a nearby column.}
<C>__{pitch }
<D>__{looking for something?}
<A>__{jack swings around with his staff, shooting off a blast of ice, but pitch isn't there. jack takes off, following the sound of pitch's cackle as it echoes throughout the chamber. jack rounds a corner as he sees pitch's shadow glide across the walls into a shadowed corridor.}
<C>__{pitch }
<D>__{don't be afraid, jack. i'm not going to hurt you.}
<A>__{jack continues along a shadowed corridor.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{afraid?}
<A>__{jack sees pitch on a bridge across the cavern and heads after him.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{i'm not afraid of you!}
<C>__{pitch}
<D>__{maybe not. but you are afraid of something.}
<A>__{jack steadily approaches, cautious and alert.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you think so, huh? guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 89.}
<C>__{pitch}
<D>__{i know so. it's the one thing i always know.}
<A>__{pitch finally turns to face jack.}
<C>__{pitch }
<D>__{people's greatest fears. yours is that no one will ever believe in you.}
<A>__{panic flashes in jack's eyes. as he backs away, the chamber fills with shadows, and jack is spun around. he's disoriented as he thuds into a wall, which flips to reveal that it's actually the ground. pitch, unseen now, chuckles. jack's unsure of where he is. he looks back to see the cavern entrance he's right back where he started.}
<C>__{pitch }
<D>__{and worst of all, you're afraid you'll never know why. why you? why were you chosen...to be like this?}
<A>__{jack discovers that the entrance has been blocked with bricks as pitch's shadow encroaches on him.}
<C>__{pitch}
<D>__{well fear not, for the answer to that...}
<A>__{pitch is now directly in front of jack, holding out a tooth box.}
<C>__{pitch }
<D>__{is right here.}
<A>__{jack's eyes widen at the sight the face of a young boy etched into the box, and under it is the name "jack frost."}
<C>__{pitch}
<D>__{do you want them, jack? your memories?}
<A>__{he holds them out to jack. jack stares, fighting the impulse to grab them. he closes his eyes, struggling to make a decision, but when he opens them again, pitch has disappeared. pitch's shadow moves across the pillars of the cavern.}
<D>__{guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 90.}
<A>__{jack heads down a corridor, cast shadows from the mini tooth cages everywhere.}
<C>__{pitch }
<D>__{everything you wanted to know...}
<A>__{pitch's face moves in and out of the shadows over the following.}
<C>__{pitch}
<D>__{...in this little box.}
<A>__{every time jack turns, pitch disappears. it's like jack's trapped in a fun house. multiple pitch shadows have appeared on the wall around jack. they're closing in on him.}
<C>__{pitch}
<D>__{why did you end up like this? unseen. unable to reach out to anyone.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you want the answers so badly. you want to grab them, and fly off with them. but you're afraid of what the guardians will think.}
<A>__{jack's breath quickens. he's been pushed into a corner.}
<C>__{pitch}
<D>__{you're afraid of disappointing them.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{well let me ease your mind about one thing. they'll never accept you. not really.}
<A>__{the shadows have overcome jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(trying to scramble away)}
<D>__{stop it! stop it!}
<A>__{almost reluctantly, the shadows back away and pitch appears before jack.}
<C>__{pitch}
<D>__{after all, you're not one of them.}
<A>__{jack aims his staff at pitch.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you don't know what i am! guardians screening script 9 6 12 avid 91.}
<C>__{pitch}
<D>__{of course i do. you're jack frost. you make a mess wherever you go. why, you're doing it right now.}
<A>__{pitch tosses the box to jack, who instinctively catches it. jack looks up. terror comes into jack's eyes, as he realizes...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what did you do?}
<C>__{pitch}
<D>__{more to the point jack, what did you do?}
<A>__{pitch begins to back away, becoming one with the darkness, laughing as he disappears. jack charges towards him only to be swallowed whole by one of pitch's black holes.}
