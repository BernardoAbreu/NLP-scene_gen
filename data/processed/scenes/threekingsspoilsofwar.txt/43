<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior desert later}
<A>__{we see a set of three very odd tracks across the ground. it looks like something has been dragged through the sand. the camera follows the tracks to epps, wes and jaeger who crawl on their bellies. they thrust knifes into the sand before them searching for mines. we get the feeling they've been at this for awhile.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{how long we going to keep this up.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{until we're out of the mine field is how long.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{haven't found a mine for half a mile, or more.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{that don't mean nothing. iraqis could have just spread them out like that; make us think we're in the clear.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{you want to crawl, crawl.}
<A>__{wes stands and starts to walk. epps waits a beat and follows suit. only jaeger stays down.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{you're going to blow yourselves up.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{wes is right. if there were any more mines we would have found them. hell, that one you stepped on was probably old anyway; left over from the war with iran.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{you don't know that. it could be a trick.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{if we step on a mine we'll know it was. let me see the maps.}
<A>__{jaeger stays down, afraid to get up.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{get up and give me the maps.}
<A>__{after a beat jaeger stands and hands over the map from the puzzle box and a recon photo. epps compares the two, then takes out the navicom.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we're on course. northeast, twenty eight degrees. when we hit the base of the mountain we'll find a pass. i can see it on the recon photo. shouldn't be too hard to traverse. that'll take us to the top and...}
<A>__{epps points at a black dot on the puzzle box map with a smaller white dot in the middle.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{this. whatever it is.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{it's the treasure, that's what it is.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{it better be.}
<A>__{epps starts to pack away the map. real plain jaeger says:}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{the map.}
<A>__{epps stops, like he almost not sure what jaeger is talking about. jaeger extends a hand.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{the map.}
<A>__{epps gets it. he hands the map back to jaeger who tucks it away. our boys walk on.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you're not losing trust, are you?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{just figure it's my map, i ought to hang on to it.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{if all we wanted was the map out of you we could have taken it while you were standing on that mine pissing on yourself.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{probably would've too if epps wasn't around to stop you.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i didn't have to stop anything, 'cause nobody was going to do nothing. we're in this together, understand?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{yeah, i understand. wes doesn't want to come along in the first place, but he gets a third of the find. that's a sweet deal.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{i'm getting tired of you riding me, jaeger.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{anytime you want to do something about it just let }
<A>__{epps stops dead in his tracks.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{quiet!}
<A>__{they all go quiet. epps cocks an ear to the air and listens. they all listen. wind, but that's about it.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i don't hear any }
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{shut up and listen!}
<A>__{again they listen. again they hear wind. then, there it is; the sound epps is looking for: a pop, like a big balloon being burst just over the next rise.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{gunfire.}
<A>__{quick like that jaeger grabs his m 16 down off his shoulder and is about to ready it when epps slaps down the muzzle.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{don't!}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{it's a fire fight.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{single shots doesn't mean a fire fight. that's not a battle going on.}
<C>__{wes}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{epps thinks. yeah, what the hell is it?}
