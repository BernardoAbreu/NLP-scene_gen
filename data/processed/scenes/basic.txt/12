<L>__{interior fort mckinley corridors morning}
<A>__{hardy follows styles and osborne. they pass soldiers replacing broken windows and sweeping up glass.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{the official term for it is "clusterfuck" . by the time beth hit us, i'd canceled all off base exercises save one a six man cadet team and their drill out in the bush. we're missing three and the sergeant. the cadets are in their eighth week of the cycle, nobody here knows much about them, up to and including their names. but the sergeant...}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{it's not west, is it? tell me it's not west.}
<A>__{styles' look tells him it is.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{ah, christ}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{you knew sergeant west?}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{he was our drill here. man's older than sand.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{a few years ago, the army picked our good buddy as their go to non com to trot out to the press to talk about the kinder, gentler military. he even did the standard video greeting played to all incoming basic cadets across the country.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{well, he's a good soldier.}
<A>__{osborne nods, agreeing.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{i didn't mean that as a compliment.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{sergeant west's served for twenty three years. he's the public face of the modern army.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{and you notice i'm not in the army anymore.}
<A>__{they round a corner.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{the exercise was one of his section eight "private sessions". left around 2100 yesterday and were scheduled for pick up at 0630 this morning.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{and the problem is you only got three.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{no, the problem is one's dead, one's got a bullet in his arm, and one won't talk. the one who won't talk was trading live fire with the dead one as we reached the pick up.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{i'm assuming that's what made him the dead one?}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{cadet roberto r. nunez. killed right in front of me.}
<C>__{osborne}
<D>__{search parties for the others are fanning out in a ten click radius from the pickup. if they're hurt and we can get to them in time...}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{i called the jag corps, the two cadets we retrieved are to be flown to d.c. on a transport leaving here at 1700 }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{which gives us about five hours. why'd you call me?}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{the guy in interrogation said he'd only talk to a cop.}
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{and i'm the closest thing to it, right?}
<A>__{styles stops, turning to his friend.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{tom, bottom line: i let those kids go out there. if jag shows up and i don't have any answers for them, my career is finished }
<C>__{hardy}
<D>__{i'm not gonna let that happen.}
<A>__{styles exhales, relieved.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{thank you. osborne will brief you on the cadets. and tom?}
<P>__{(half smile)}
<D>__{it really is good to see you.}
