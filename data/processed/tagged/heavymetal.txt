<B>__{a wheatfield}
<A>__{a beautiful field of wheat glistens in the morning sun. as the camera skims overtop, titles start to roll. ahead of us an odd looking service van comes into view, sputtering along a dirt road. getting closer, we can see the driver, a thin, bookish man with a neat mustache. this is austin grimaldi. the truck pulls up to a strange victorian house in the middle of the wheatfield. the house has several futuristic radar devices on the roof that rotate constantly. austin gets out, opens the van's rear doors, and pulls out two large metal boxes.}

<B>__{inside the house}
<A>__{austin is reading a schematic diagram as he sits in front of the exposed chassis of a complicated futuristic electronic contraption, twice his size. there are strange tools all over the floor. putting down the diagram, he opens one of the metal cases and takes out a sophisticated looking glass sphere with electronic receptacles mounted in the sides. he places this sphere in a space in the middle of the contraption, clamps it down, and plugs some wires into the globe's receptacles. then he opens the second box. inside is a glowing green ball. using a pair of special tongs, austin carefully lifts the ball out, and inserts it into an opening at the base of the machine, in the back. as soon as the ball is inside, the machine hums to life. the glass sphere sparkles, and a holographic picture of a green planet in space appears inside it.}
<C>__{austin}
<P>__{(looking at the holograph)}
<D>__{hmmmm ....}
<A>__{he takes a strange tool, and moves out of frame to make an adjustment underneath the machine. suddenly a wire comes loose from the sphere and begins to spark.}

<B>__{a forest}
<A>__{from the forest floor we see the green planetoid fly overhead, dropping balls. we watch as it moves away and disappears beyond a far off mountain range. the forest rumbles as the planetoid crashes in the distance. the camera then pans over to a forest patch, where a beautiful girl approaches, picking mushrooms.}

<B>__{a green ball near her feet}
<A>__{an ominous note is struck as the girl notices the glowing ball, and is drawn to it. picking the sphere up, she looks at it. something inside her warns her of its danger, but, unable to resist, she puts it in her basket and continues on.}

<B>__{the outlands}
<A>__{flying quickly overtop futuristic villages, the camera heads further and further out into the less civilized sectors, where the rusting pipelines and crumbling utility stations of a past civilization have been overgrown by scrub bush and weeds. the camera zooms across this strange landscape toward the distant mountains where the huge planetoid fell. finally, from high above the foothills, we begin to come down. in the hills below us, hundreds of blue humanoid barbarians are moving along, mesmerized, toward a pulsing green glow high in the mountaintops. suddenly the mountains begin to rumble.}

<B>__{the gates of kraan}
<A>__{a frightened kraanian councillor spurs his horse forward through the beautiful glass gates, as in the distance we hear the sound of ten thousand approaching footsteps. the camera pans to a hillside overlooking kraan. in the glow of sunset, the outline of the barbarian leader, riding a black war horse, appears at the hillside and stops. then with a thundering of footsteps, the outline of five thousand barbarians comes into view behind him, filling the horizon.}

<A>__{he is now wearing a strange medallion around his neck as, wild eyed, he screams to signal the attack. the bloodthirsty horde charges down the hill behind him. the camera moves with the barbarians as they crash through the gates of the city, destroying everything in their path. smoke and flames are everywhere. ahead of us, terrified kraanians run from the onslaught. as we track up over the burning rooftops, we see the barbarian leader riding his war horse in the streets below. shouting a command, he waves his men on as they move toward an impressive doomed building in the middle of the city.}

<A>__{we look down over this uncivilized wilderness with only decaying pipelines and the occasional jagged rock structure breaking the barren uniformity of the land. as the council's distant chanting fades out, all is quiet. suddenly from behind us, we hear the sound of flapping wings and a huge rush of air. just above our heads, taarna the defender comes flying in, sitting proudly in the saddle of a giant crimson bird.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{taarna's face she is beautiful, with dark eyes and wild red hair blowing behind her in the wind. below her, on the ground, she sees a humanoid running in terror, chased by an ugly, four legged mutant creature. spurring her bird forward, taarna sweeps down over the ugly beast and lassoes it. she then hoists the creature up into the air and, tossing her end of the rope over a tall jagged rock, she leaves the snarling beast hanging helplessly. flying down to the grateful humanoid, she dismounts. as she approaches we see that he has a barbarian medallion on a chain around his neck.}
<C>__{humanoid}
<D>__{i owe you my life. let me repay you ...}
<A>__{he takes off his medallion and places it around her neck. suddenly he twists the chain tight in his hand, pulling her towards him. his eyes change to a bright green as he forces her to the ground and starts ripping at her clothes. as he molests her, taarna is distracted. she hears something voices inside her, chanting her name. quickly she grabs the chain and rips it apart. then she powerfully smashes both her hands together around her attacker's ears. as he holds his ringing ears, she gets up, lifts him above her head, and hurls him mercilessly to the ground. still hearing the chanting, she jumps on her bird, pulls out a second rope, and lassoes the barbarian's feet. she then lifts him up and leaves him hanging from the tall, jagged rock, next to the growling creature. as taarna flies off, the hanging beast eyes the barbarian hungrily.}

<A>__{he is still sitting on the floor, working on his machine. as the camera pulls closer, we see that austin is reaching deep inside the machineworks, trying to solder a small orange diode in place with an odd style soldering iron. the connection breaks, and the diode and some hot solder fall deeper into the machine and start smoking and sputtering. as the smoke grows thicker, the machine starts to buzz loudly.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{dammit!}
<A>__{austin pulls his face out of the smoking chassis, grabs a pair of needlenose pliers, and reaches back to retrieve the part. the camera follows austin's arm into the chassis, where smoke surrounds it and clouds over everything. the buzzing sound grows, and changes into the sound of powerful, throbbing engines. slowly the smoke begins to clear as we hear a voice crackling over a radiophone.}
