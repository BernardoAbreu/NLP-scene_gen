<A>__{solemn and mournful, ten year old wednesday has black hair and white skin like her mother. she sits on a stool among the stored addams' family objects, one end of a string tied to her tooth, the other tied to a trap door. the trap door is flung open, granny pokes her head through. she's a giggly hag who looks like she was in the bathtub when the hairdryer fell in. wednesday's pulled tooth swings at the end of the string.}
