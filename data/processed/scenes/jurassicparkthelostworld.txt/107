<L>__{exterior worker village night}
<A>__{ and find themselves at the edge of what was once isla sorna's worker village. the size of a football field, the town is divided by a main street that's dotted on both sides by stores, residences, cafes, a gas station. all the way at the far end is a large, blocky, four story building. but the town is a mess. the hurricane that hit here must have been ferocious, for everywhere things are smashed, broken, upended. and the jungle has stepped into the breath, growing up, around, and over everything. huge root systems snake through the street, making it almost impassable.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{the jungle. it's always ready to return.}
<A>__{roland catches up and looks at ludlow.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{where's the power and radio setup?}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{operations building. far end of the street.}
<A>__{a light rain falls as they start down the street, carefully, silently, roland and malcolm with their weapons at the ready. they pass the skeleton of a fallen water tower. an empty gas station, its vine snarled pumps now useless. the only sound is the low mechanical hum of the servo lights as they follow the group's gazes obediently. every few feet, the group encounters strange, grayish lumps that lies in random places in the middle of the street. malcolm, curious, stops and taps one of them. it's a rock hard. nick looks over his shoulder.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{lava?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what are they?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{finally, they reach the operation building, at the far end of the town.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{the radio rig is inside. it runs directly from the geothermal generator, so power shouldn't be a problem.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{good.}
<A>__{he pulls out his canteen. ludlow watches as he screws the top off, moves toward the building, and starts splashing the contents on the outside of it. the rest of the group just stares at him.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{what's he got in there?}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{piss.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{don't ask me. the guy's completely out to lunch.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what in god's name would he want with }
<A>__{roland rejoins them.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{tyrannosaur urine. i don't want anything to do with it, and neither does any other animal on this island. this building is now demarcated as the rex's territory. as long as you stay in that building, you'll all be safe until the helicopter comes.}
<A>__{he drops his pack, swings his gun off his shoulder, and checks the load. dr. juttson looks fearful.}
<C>__{juttson}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{after the rex. i saw a fresh kill back in the valley with tyrannosaur tracks all around it. if i'm not back in time, don't wait for me.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{you've got to be kidding.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{runs against my nature to hole up in a cave and wait.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{do you think the rex might have the infant with it?}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{possible.}
<A>__{ludlow takes off his hat and turns to nick.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{you know how to work a radio, don't you?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{you're going too?}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{i lost everything i came after on this trip, but one t rex in one theme park could single handedly bail ingen out of chapter 11.}
<A>__{he takes a slip of paper from the brim of his hat and hands it to nick.}
<C>__{ludlow }
<D>__{this is the broadcast frequency. id yourself as "harvest leader." you know what to tell 'em.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you gentlemen feel you have to do this now?}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{now's the perfect time. the animal just fed, so it won't stalk us for food. predators don't hurt when they're not hungry.}
<A>__{ludlow double checks the clip on his semi automatic rifle }
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{ and smacks it back into the belly of the gun.}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{only humans do.}
