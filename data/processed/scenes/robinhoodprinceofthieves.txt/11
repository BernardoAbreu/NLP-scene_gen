<A>__{kenneth checks the ground. locksley waits.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{they came this way, my lord.}
<C>__{locksley}
<D>__{onward then. what is this place?}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{nearby the gregor caves.}
<A>__{locksley reacts a hint of fear. they move on... ahead, the hillside glows, rimmed in eerie light. strange primitive chants, wafted on the wind. locksley ties his nervous horse to a tree. parting undergrowth, kenneth creeps forward. cries out. he's face to face with the maggot eaten skull of a goat. beyond it, a gruesome host of half skinned human skulls, all arranged on stakes. some male, others with rotting female tresses, staring eyelessly into the night. kenneth turns to run... a hand grabs him.}
<C>__{locksley}
<D>__{steady, man. they are to dissuade the faint of heart. think of gwen.}
<A>__{from the crest of the rise, they peer down into the craggy valley. a cave opening, ablaze with flames leers at them like the mouth of hell. before the cave, a circle of stones. a miniature stonehenge. a medieval orgy. men and women in masks and loose robes. dancing. drinking. reveling. pure carnality. lord locksley and kenneth watch in horror. faces ashen.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{druids.}
<C>__{locksley}
<D>__{i trusted we were rid of such evil a century ago.}
<A>__{an unearthly screech. a creature leaps into the circle of stones. grotesque gargoyle head, horns, fur covered arms and legs. a living hieronymous bosch demon. its clawed hands slash across a reveler's back, drawing blood in vicious streaks. the creature tastes the blood. the reveler is ecstatic.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<P>__{(petrified)}
<D>__{is it the devil?}
<C>__{locksley}
<D>__{if it is, i have some christian steel that will test his hide.}
<A>__{he draws his sword. a crucifix sculpted into the hilt. a girl is dragged from the cave. kenneth buries his head.}
<C>__{locksley}
<D>__{gwen?}
<A>__{kenneth nods. the demon shrieks, dervishing around gwen, who is carried onto the central plinth stone. a pagan altar, the shape of an elephant's head with its trunk raised. a masked figure stands at the head of the altar. the high priest of the dark rite. the girl's body shudders as blood red liquid is forced down her throat. the demon's voice is husky and hideous.}
<C>__{demon}
<D>__{come, my virgin flower.}
<A>__{hypnotized by the creature's voice and snake like move ments, gwen stretches herself out. a single beam of sunlight slices through the mist, like a laser. the first light of the rising sun, it strikes directly on the altar, tracking down towards the girl's heart. the demon's raised talons close in on the white flesh of her neck. gwen's eyes are open wide, in a trance. the crowd of revelers encircle the plinth. awed anticipation... a warrior's yell! sword raised, locksley thunders in on his charger. the terrified crowd parts. the demon screams like a banshee.}
<C>__{demon}
<D>__{kill him! kill him!}
<A>__{the followers throw themselves at locksley. he beats them off. the high priest issues orders to armed guards, who run to intercept. one aims a spear. locksley hacks the shaft in half. cuts men down left and right. reaches the altar stone.}
<C>__{locksley}
<D>__{gwen! up, girl, up!}
<A>__{gwen shakes off her trance. the demon launches itself at locksley. talons rip flesh from his face. with all his strength, locksley hurls the creature down.}
<C>__{locksley}
<D>__{in the name of god!}
<A>__{his broadsword swings in a mighty arc. slices across the gargoyle's skull. clean through half the face... impossibly, the demon rolls back to its feet. the head is an elaborate mask beneath are the yellow skin, white hair, and burning red eyes of an albino crone. screaming vitriol, the hag is unharmed. momentarily stunned, locksley regains his senses, hauls the girl onto his charger. the guards close in. locksley spurs his horse. rides for an opening. the masked high priest stands resolutely in his path. brandishing a burning branch. the horse is freaked. rears. locksley and the girl are thrown. unarmed, locksley charges the man. slams him into the cave wall. the mask falls. locksley gasps in recognition.}
<C>__{locksley}
<D>__{nottingham!}
<A>__{the sheriff of nottingham. powerful build, black beard, cruel intensity in every feature.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{you are an unwelcome surprise, locksley.}
<C>__{locksley}
<D>__{the king shall hear of this, nottingham.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{i think not.}
<A>__{locksley is surrounded. one by one the men reveal their faces. locksley backs up in shock, recognizing them.}
<C>__{locksely}
<D>__{god help us.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{one day all england will worship with us.}
<C>__{locksley}
<D>__{never.}
<A>__{the crone spits venom in his face.}
<C>__{demon}
<D>__{i am mortianna. you will die with my name on your lips.}
<A>__{locksley's agonized cry fills the valley. on the hill side, kenneth averts his eyes. turns to run. five masked figures block his way.}
