<L>__{exterior woodsmen's camp day (later)}
<A>__{hands tighten a girth. will confidently jokes with his cronies. woodsmen form a primitive circle of spectators. little john and his wife, fanny, keep to themselves, while wulf openly talks with robin, aslan and duncan. robin is stripped to the waist, his muscled skin ravaged with scars.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{this man has true purpose. he means to kill you.}
<C>__{duncan}
<D>__{and you have given him the means.}
<C>__{wulf}
<D>__{will is ruthless, robin. guard your back.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i am grateful for your concern, friends, but i have to prove to them it is possible to overcome unequal odds.}
<P>__{(shouts)}
<D>__{i am ready, will.}
<A>__{will bends, as if checking the horse's legs. secretly grabs a handful of sand. swings into the saddle and digs in his heels. closing in, will flings the sand in robin's eyes. robin clutches his hands to his face, blinded. will spins back to the attack. his sword slashes. reacting to the sound, robin rolls aside. the men cheer like a big fight crowd. robin's pov is blurred. ducking the blade, he grabs will's arm. a blow glances off his shoulder. robin falls to his knees, still blinded. will rides right at him, to trample him. robin scrambles away. will wheels his horse. a flashing hoof grazes robin's chest. robin leaps to his feet and yells at the top of his lungs. panicked, the horse rears, whinnying wildly. will struggles to stay in the saddle. loses his sword. robin seizes the moment and runs to a water trough. douses his face. yells at will.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{come on, you little piss pot. do your worst!}
<A>__{will grabs a spear from a bystander. robin stands his ground. will lunges, robin sidesteps.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{the horse is smarter than you are, will.}
<A>__{some of the men laugh. will is incensed. robin ducks and weaves, easily evading will's repeated charges. robin ducks right under the horse's belly.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{here, will! you aim like a girl, will!}
<A>__{will stabs wildly, more and more frustrated. laughter spreads, as robin plays hide and seek around the horse's legs. grabbing the end of the spear, he clowns a tug of war. enraged, will strains and tries to kick robin away. suddenly, robin lets go. unbalanced, will flies back wards off his mount. robin snatches the spear and raises it over his fallen adversary. the crowd falls silent. robin strikes. the point quivers in the ground below will's crotch. will wriggles in terror. impaled, his pants rip open.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{thank the lord you are not endowed like bull.}
<A>__{the crowd is convulsed with laughter. robin catches his breath. does not see will, who grabs a heavy staff and runs at him. a strong hand grasps will's arm as he is about to strike.}
<C>__{little john}
<D>__{bollocks, will. jus' bugger off, eh?}
<A>__{overpowered, will relents. with a defiant glance, he skulks away.}
<C>__{little john}
<D>__{ya got us by the short and curlies, robin hood. now let's hear what ya got to bleedin' say.}
<A>__{robin scans the faces. he has their attention.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{nottingham has taken from us everything we own. now we are going to start taking from him.}
<C>__{little john}
<D>__{'ow in bloody blazes are we gonna do that?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{we are going to tax him.}
