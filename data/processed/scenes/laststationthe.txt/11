<L>__{interior yasnaya polyana. tolstoy's bedroom study. morning.}
<A>__{where tolstoy, awake and dressed, sits on his bed, pen in hand, writing in his diary. dushan sits next to him, taking his pulse.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{nothing's working... hand me my other boot, my friend, will you?}
<C>__{dushan}
<D>__{let me finish.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{it doesn't matter. if my heart had stopped beating, i'd still go riding today.}
<C>__{dushan}
<D>__{your pulse is my responsibility...}
<C>__{dushan }
<D>__{and if you must ride, i insist you wear a coat. even the sun is cold today.}
<A>__{he puts tolstoy's arm down and hands him his riding boot. sofya comes ranting into the room carrying several russian and international dailies.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{this is impossible! it really is! these people are parasites! look...}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"countess tolstoy has become estranged from her husband. they barely speak."}
<A>__{she throws the paper on the floor.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{you know who spreads all this rubbish....}
<A>__{she opens another paper, a french daily.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{c'est la meme en france. they gossip about us in paris... "they do not share a similar view of either religion or politics." incroyable!}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{peut etre. you think that's inaccurate?}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{i think it's none of the world's business.}
<A>__{she looks at dushan who is transcribing every word into his diary. he does it with all the master's conversations.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{what are you doing? don't do that.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{dushan petrovich, you're scribbling again?}
<A>__{tolstoy moves with energy and purpose toward the door.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{darling, where are you going?}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{riding with sasha. don't expect us for lunch.}
<A>__{something strikes him. he walks to his desk, picks up his pen and quickly writes a sentence on a scrap of paper.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{leovochka, why do you insist on dressing like that.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{like the man who looks after the sheep.}
<C>__{tolstoy}
<D>__{it's not meant to offend you.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{but it does offend me, because it offends reason. you're a count, for god's sake.}
<A>__{he puts his pen down, goes to her, kisses her gently on the forehead and leaves the room.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{oh darling, i have something else to say.}
<C>__{tolstoy }
<D>__{i doubt it not, my dear.}
<C>__{dushan}
<D>__{he's forgotten his coat.}
<A>__{he runs after him, tripping over the long fur garment.}
<C>__{dushan }
<D>__{count tolstoy, you've forgotten your coat.}
<A>__{meanwhile sofya notices a photographic portrait of chertkov on the wall. she takes it down and tosses it in the corner.}
