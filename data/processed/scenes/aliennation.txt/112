<A>__{sykes has stopped to pick jetson up. he's wiping the "e.t. p.d." from the door as jetson approaches from the edge of the bluff. fedorchuk pulls up alongside in his n.d. sedan. he calls off to jetson, who is still twenty yards away.}
<C>__{fedorchuk}
<D>__{well, if it isn't detective jetson. forget you hip waders, big guy?}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{lay off, asshole.}
<C>__{fedorchuk}
<D>__{i may be an asshole, but at least i'm a real detective, not some outer shit space thing.}
<A>__{sykes, his face neutral, which we should by now know to be highly dangerous, saunters to fedorchuk's car and leans against it.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{yeah? you're a real honest to god detective...?}
<A>__{sykes grabs the back of fedorchuk's head and slams it into the steering wheel, bam honk!, and in doing so, has hurt his hand again (the hand he hit jetson with). he shakes that hand while lunging in and grabbing fedorchuk's car keys with the other.}
<C>__{sykes}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{then detect these!}
<A>__{fedorchuk, holding his bloody nose, watches as his car keys sail out in an arc out over the bluff. jetson, just climbing into the slug mobile, witnesses the last of this scene without knowing how it began.}
