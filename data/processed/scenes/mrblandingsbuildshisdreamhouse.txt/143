<L>__{exterior the blandings' home day}
<A>__{it is an especially beautiful, sunshiny morning. a rural looking taxi deposits a weary jim, who pays the driver. as the cab drives off, jim looks speculatively at simms' car, which is parked there, yawns, stretches, opens the door and enters. under this a slightly sour underscoring of "home on the range."}
<L>__{interior blandings living room day}
<A>__{as jim comes into the foyer, he sees muriel, in nightgown and robe, talking to mr. simms. she holds the rolled up volume of blueprints that went into building the house.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{'morning, dear.}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(going to him; solicitously)}
<D>__{darling, you must be exhausted. how did it go?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{fine. fine.}
<A>__{they kiss.}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(obliquely)}
<D>__{is... everything all right?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(unenthusiastic)}
<D>__{everything's fine.}
<P>__{(still in embrace; looking up)}
<D>__{hello, simms, what brings you out with the morning dew?}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{just dropped by to check the blueprints. some extras came in from retch this morning and there're a couple of things i thought we ought to go over together.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(arms still around muriel; unconcerned)}
<D>__{really. what are they?}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{well, let's see.}
<P>__{(thumbing through sheets)}
<D>__{few little things here, all right, i guess. "mortising five butts a dollar sixty eight."}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{let's not quibble about that. a man's entitled to mortise a few butts now and then.}
<C>__{simms}
<P>__{(next sheet)}
<D>__{extra nails and screws three dollars, eighty nine cents.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{petty larceny, but let him get away with it.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{now there's one here i frankly don't understand. ah, here we are.}
<P>__{(reads)}
<D>__{"changes in closet, twelve hundred and forty seven dollars." did you authorize that?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{well, we probably told him to }
<P>__{(reacting)}
<D>__{twelve hundred and what?!}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{forty seven dollars. changes in closet.}
<P>__{(hands bill to jim)}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(explosively)}
<D>__{who does he think we are!}
<P>__{(looks at bill; very businesslike)}
<D>__{what's this notation: "refer to detail sheet number one thirty five?"}
<C>__{simms}
<P>__{(indicating blueprints)}
<D>__{far as i remember, that would be something in the back of the house. let's just take a look.}
<A>__{as he unrolls the blueprints, jim looks suspiciously at muriel. she seems a little nervous.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{ah, here we are. it isn't a closet at all. it's off the back pantry... mrs. blandings' little flower sink.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{oh... mrs. blandings' little flower sink.}
<C>__{simms}
<P>__{(to muriel)}
<D>__{you didn't authorize any changes, did you?}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(defensively)}
<D>__{well... they certainly weren't changes.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what have you done?}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(speaking rapidly a little confused)}
<D>__{i haven't done anything! and what i did was... just nothing at all.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what have you done?!}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{well }
<P>__{(rattling off)}
<D>__{all i did was one day i saw four pieces of flagstone left over from the porch that were just going to be thrown away because nobody wanted them and i asked mr. retch if he wouldn't just put them down on the floor of the flower sink and poke a little cement between the cracks and give me a nice stone floor where it might be wet with flowers and things. that was absolutely all i did.}
<A>__{during the above speech simms sinks into a chair, puts his head in his hands and closes his eyes, a fact that isn't lost on jim.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{that's all you did?}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{absolutely. just four little pieces of flagstone.}
<C>__{simms}
<P>__{(to muriel; wearily)}
<D>__{did you by any chance authorize a drain?}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(verge of tears)}
<D>__{of course i didn't. all i said was i wanted a nice stone floor and mr. retch was just as nice as could be and said, "you're the doctor," and that's all anybody ever said to anybody about anything.}
<A>__{jim takes a deep breath, turns to simms.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{...well?}
<C>__{simms}
<P>__{(sigh; plunging in)}
<D>__{all right, i think i can tell you what happened. first, the carpenters had to rip up the flooring that was already laid. those planks run under the whole width of the pantry, so retch had to knock the bottom out of the pantry wall to get at them.}
<B>__{jim and muriel}
<A>__{jim and muriel jim looks at muriel as though he were premeditating first degree murder. she averts his gaze. over this:}
<C>__{simms' voice}
<D>__{then he had to chop out the tops of the joists under the flower sink space to make room for a cradle. i guess he bought some iron straps and fastened them to a big pan to give him something to hold the cement. what with that added load on the weakened joists, i will bet he had to put a lally column down there for support, too.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{it was just four little pieces of flagstone, and i only }
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{quiet!}
<A>__{group shot during the following speech group shot during the following speech we see bill cole, in jim's pajamas and robe come down the stairs and enter the room. jim and muriel are not aware of his presence.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{well, the main soil pipe runs under there on wall brackets, so retch had to get his plumbing man back to take out a section so he could get that cradle set. i guess that meant he had to change the pitch of the soil pipe from one end of the house to the other.}
<P>__{(looks up)}
<D>__{'morning, mr. cole.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{'morning. hello, jim.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(turning)}
<D>__{hello, bill.}
<A>__{jim turns away, reacts, suddenly turns back to bill, taking in the pajamas and robe. a little shocked but unwilling to believe the implication of what he sees, he looks to muriel for an explanation.}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(lamely)}
<D>__{the bridge was roped off and bill had to stay last night.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{...oh.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(cheerily)}
<D>__{slept like a rock.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i'm delighted.}
<A>__{jim looks at bill, then back at muriel.}
<C>__{simms}
<P>__{(clearing his throat)}
<D>__{and then, of course, there are hot and cold water pipes hooked to the joists right under that pantry. they go up to the wing bathroom on the second floor, and i will bet my bottom dollar he had to relocate them.}
<A>__{three shot jim, muriel and bill. three shot jim, muriel and bill. jim turns to listen but finds himself looking speculatively at muriel and bill.}
<C>__{simms' voice}
<D>__{and i guess the electrician had to rip out about sixty feet of armored cable between the main panel and the junction box by the oil burner, including the two hundred twenty volt cable that goes to the stove.}
<A>__{full shot gussie appears in the doorway full shot gussie appears in the doorway in raincoat, carrying umbrella.}
<C>__{gussie}
<D>__{'morning, everybody. whew! what a night!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{where have you been?}
<C>__{gussie}
<D>__{lansdale. couldn't get back across the bridge.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you... weren't here last night?}
<C>__{gussie}
<D>__{they weren't letting anybody across that bridge, mr. blandings.}
<P>__{(to muriel)}
<D>__{i passed the girls over at the williams. they'll be along any minute.}
<A>__{as jim reacts:}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{thank you, gussie. you'd better get breakfast started.}
<A>__{as gussie exits, muriel turns to simms.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{where were we?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{we were at the two hundred twenty volt cable that goes to the stove.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{just a minute.}
<P>__{(looks at bill, then at muriel)}
<D>__{you mean the children weren't here last night either?}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{how could they be, dear? the bridge was closed.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i just came across it.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{well, it was closed last night.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{it's open now!}
<A>__{embarrassed pause.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(attempt at breeziness)}
<D>__{if you'll all excuse me i i think i will just go up and slip into something a little more comfortable.}
<A>__{bill exits. another pause. simms, aware of the tension, wants to get out of there.}
<C>__{simms}
<P>__{(rapidly)}
<D>__{well, that's about the size of it }
<A>__{through simms' speech, jim looks darkly at muriel.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{ except that retch had to repair the pantry wall and that meant getting a plasterer back. and of course, he couldn't have broken through that wall }
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{all right, simms, all right. we'll take care of it.}
<C>__{simms}
<P>__{(preparing to exit)}
<D>__{i will admit it's a little steep. but i will try to get retch to knock a hundred dollars off the bill. if i can't get that, i will certainly try for seventy five.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{fine.}
<C>__{simms}
<D>__{if he doesn't go for seventy five, i will take a stab at fifty.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you do that.}
<C>__{simms}
<P>__{(at the door)}
<D>__{anyway, i'm almost sure we can get twenty five.}
<A>__{there is no answer.}
<C>__{simms}
<P>__{(lamely)}
<D>__{well. good day.}
<A>__{he leaves. there is a deadly pause.}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{now dear, you're upset, you've got a lot of things on your mind }
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(with dangerous calm)}
<D>__{muriel, there's only one thing on my mind this house and how fast we can get rid of it!}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{that's not what you're thinking.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{maybe it's not. maybe i'm thinking i was once a happy man!}
<P>__{(the martyr)}
<D>__{i didn't have a closet, i didn't have three bathrooms, but i did have my sanity, a few dollars in the bank, two children who loved me and a wife i could trust!}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{that's a fine thing to say!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i also had a job at danton and bascomb, something i don't happen to have at the moment!}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{jim!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{that's right, i've resigned! we're starting all over again! from scratch! and without this house!}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(near tears)}
<D>__{you love this house!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i hate it!}
<A>__{in the b.g. mr. tesander enters, cap in hand, stands there, nervous and embarrassed.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{you don't mean that.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{every word of it! anybody who builds a house today is crazy! the minute you start, they put you on the list. the all american sucker list! everywhere you turn they've got a hand in your pocket. if you take out their hands, they find more pockets!}
<P>__{(explosively)}
<D>__{it's a conspiracy, i tell you, a conspiracy against every man and woman who want a home of their own! against every boy and girl who were ever in love!}
<A>__{tesander clears his throat. jim turns.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{what do you want?!}
<A>__{a slight embarrassed pause. then:}
<C>__{tesander}
<P>__{(shyly)}
<D>__{well, mr. blandings, there's a matter of twelve dollars and eighty six cents.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(with a wild gleam)}
<D>__{twelve dollars and eighty six cents! why be a piker, mr. tesander?}
<P>__{(emptying pockets)}
<D>__{take everything i've got! spread it out among your pals!}
<P>__{(advancing toward the bewildered tesander)}
<D>__{wouldn't retch like a little something? maybe zucca could use my new dinner jacket? it's open house, mr. tesander! help yourself! if this isn't enough i will come over to your place and do some odd chores. maybe i can mow your lawn or scratch your back!}
<C>__{tesander}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{you don't understand, mr. blandings. this twelve dollars and eighty six cents you don't owe me, i owe you.}
<A>__{there is a momentary pause.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{...w what was that?}
<C>__{tesander}
<P>__{(taking out money)}
<D>__{found i overcharged you. almost three feet.}
<A>__{he hands the money to jim, who stares at it blankly.}
<C>__{tesander}
<D>__{better count it. i think it's all there.}
<A>__{jim looks haplessly at muriel, sheepish, guilty.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{thank you very much, mr. tesander.}
<C>__{tesander}
<D>__{well, i guess i'd better be gettin' along.}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{sure got a pretty place here.}
<P>__{(at door; pauses; looks back)}
<D>__{i will tell mr. zucca about the dinner jacket.}
<A>__{jim and muriel look at each other a little sheepishly.}
