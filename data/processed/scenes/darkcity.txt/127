<L>__{interior seaside hotel room day}
<A>__{a p.o.v. enters a small room. dappled sunlight through a tattered lace curtain. a clock ticks on a wall. a cough o.s. from the corridor. a fat man, talks as he enters:}
<C>__{fat man}
<D>__{it's small but clean...}
<P>__{(it isn't)}
<D>__{...and the view's nice.}
<P>__{(points to window)}
<D>__{isn't it?}
<A>__{john white enters. he is haggard, eyes rimmed with red. he still holds the small black notebook, tight to his chest. he stands in the centre of the room, looks up. strangely, though the room is very small, it extends upwards several stories windows sit at various heights. white walks to the lace curtain, opens it with shaking hands.}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{a narrow street and at the end, the ocean. the sound of distant surf, he can taste the salt spray.}
<C>__{white }
<D>__{i will take it.}
<A>__{the man behind him blows his nose loudly and turns to go, shutting the door. white puts the notebook down on a table near the open window.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{white has fallen asleep on the bed. he wakes, troubled. stands and walks over to the sink next to the bed. he moves like he is underwater. the sea breeze tugs at the curtain, draws him to the window.}
<B>__{his p.o.v.}
<A>__{down the street to the small patch of sand between buildings. two figures approach each other. he pulls out his wallet and removes the torn photo of the woman, places it against the pillow on the bed. he sits on the edge of the bed and lifts his trousers, looks at his legs nothing out of the ordinary. white is disturbed by a tiny movement in his coat pocket. he reaches in and pulls out a small, emaciated fish. disgusted, he drops the fish to the floor, looks at the creature. white raise his foot. his heel comes down with a sickening squish. the camera moves in steadily towards the notebook near the window. as the shot tightens we can read the title on the cover: answers by jonathan white, age nine. now a sudden gust of wind blows open the book. the pages flicker past. glimpses of happy things. a child's drawings of smiling people. the sun shining down on a blue ocean full of sailing boats. fields of colourful flowers. cute animals.}
