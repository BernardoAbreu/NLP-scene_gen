<L>__{interior robot service tunnels night}
<A>__{eve zooms through the hallways. a band of rejects track behind them. they reach an intersection when... ...the captain's face appears on holo screens all around them.}
<C>__{captain }
<D>__{testing, testing... is this thing on?}
<B>__{all around the axiom}
<A>__{all screens display the captain's live feed. he's absolutely everywhere. a few stray passengers are still up. watch their screens in confusion.}
<L>__{interior bridge night}
<A>__{auto watches the captain on the holo screen. furiously tries to shut off the intercom. back on eve and wall e}
<C>__{captain }
<D>__{psssst! hey! hey! this is the captain i'm locked in my room. eve, wall e, bring the plant to the lido deck. i will have activated the holo detector. now hurry! auto's probably going to cut me off }
<A>__{the screens all go dead. eve and wall e look at each other with determination. they're about to continue on when... a wall of stewards block their path.}
<C>__{stewards}
<D>__{halt.}
<A>__{dozens of them stand in a row. eve fires her gun. destroys a steward. another one quickly takes its place. traps her arm with its suspension beam. she can't shoot. the stewards advance, when suddenly... ...the rejects charge the stewards: ...the beautician bot deflects rays with her mirrors... ...the vacu bot sneezes dust in their faces... ...the defib bot shocks them with her paddles... ...the umbrella bot opens up... ...shields the others from the attack... behind the umbrella bot a weak wall e activates his welding beam. shorts out the massage bot's energy straightjacket. it goes berserk. leaps at the entire army of stewards. robot parts fly everywhere. eve and wall e can't watch the carnage. back in the captain's quarters he sets eve's cylindrical device on the floor behind him. it projects her stored memories.}
<B>__{up on the bridge}
<A>__{auto watches steward blips disappear from his screen. a message screen pops up. it's the captain. ...and he's holding the plant?}
<C>__{captain }
<D>__{ha, ha! look what i got, auto!}
<A>__{auto's single lens irises wide.}
<C>__{auto}
<D>__{not possible.}
<C>__{captain }
<D>__{that's right! the plant! oh, you want it? come and get it, blinky!}
