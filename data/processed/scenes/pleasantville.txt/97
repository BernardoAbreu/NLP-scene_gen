<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{soda shop. dusk.}
<A>__{david heads toward work with his apron and little paper hat. the buddy holly music has given way to "hip" '50s jazz. dave brubeck drifts out of the soda shop as david pauses for a moment, takes a bite of his oatmeal cookie, and heads inside.}
<B>__{soda shop.}
<A>__{the place has "morphed" even more. if it was a teenage hangout before, it has become almost a bohemian coffee house now. brubeck's "take five" plays in the background while several patrons talk "intensely" in their booths.}
<B>__{doorway.}
<A>__{david walks into the building and pauses. next to him, one of the boys from the basketball team plays along with the jazz on a bongo drum. there are several coffee cups on the table. jennifer gets up quickly and comes over to him.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(in a whisper)}
<D>__{i had nothing to do with that fire.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{it's okay.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{not directly anyhow ...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's fine.}
<A>__{david glances at the booth beside them and realizes that the bongos have stopped playing. all the kids are staring up at him, with a weird expression of awe.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(still under her breath)}
<D>__{um ... they like wanna ask you a question ... i didn't know how to handle it. so ...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{he crosses to the booth where biff and two others look up at him. it's like elvis has entered the building.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{how you doin?}
<C>__{various kids}
<D>__{swell ...}
<A>__{they keep on staring. several glances are exchanged back and forth like they're sharing a secret. finally ...}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{how'd you know about the fire?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{how'd you know how to put it out and all?}
<A>__{david hesitates, weighing his words.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{well where i used to live ... that's just what firemen did.}
<A>__{this sends a murmur through the shop. the boy leans forward.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{and where's that?}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{um ... outside of pleasantville.}
<A>__{this sends a much louder murmur rifling through the kids. it's like electricity. they glance excited at one another. a hush descends.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{what's outside of pleasantville?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{look it doesn't matter. it's not important.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{david stops and looks out at the kids who are hanging on every word.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's really not important.}
<C>__{girl's voice }
<D>__{what's outside of pleasantville?}
<B>__{reverse angle. including doorway.}
<A>__{margaret henderson (the girl with the cookies) stands in the doorway staring at david. she hangs on his words with the same excitement as the others, it just means so much more.}
<C>__{margaret }
<P>__{(hungry for knowledge)}
<D>__{c'mon. tell us ...}
<A>__{she stares right in his eyes. she's ten feet away but might as well be touching him.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{well ... there are some places where the road doesn't go in a circle. there are some places where it keeps on going.}
<A>__{there's an excited giggle. they lean forward.}
<C>__{margaret}
<P>__{(an exotic concept)}
<D>__{keeps going ...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{well it all just keeps going. roads ... rivers ... 2nd boy}
<P>__{(from the back)}
<D>__{like the "mighty mississippi".}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{... what?}
<A>__{he moves forward extending a book. the cover reads: "the adventures of huckelberry finn." david opens the first page. there is printing inside.}
<C>__{boy}
<P>__{(quoting)}
<D>__{"it was big 'n brown 'n kept goin' an' goin' as far you could see."}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(turning to jennifer)}
<D>__{i thought the books were blank?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{they were.}
<A>__{he looks over at her.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{okay look, this like wasn't my fault. they asked me what it was about and i like didn't remember 'cause we had it back in tenth grade, but i told them what i did remember, and the next thing i knew the pages had filled in.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{the pages filled in?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{but like only up to the part about the raft, because i didn't read any farther.}
<B>__{closer.}
<A>__{david flips through the book and sure enough only the first chapter has printerior the pages are blank after that.}
<D>__{2nd boy do you know how it ends?}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(hesitating)}
<D>__{well, yeah ... i do.}
<C>__{margaret}
<P>__{(breathless)}
<D>__{so how does it end?}
<A>__{she has moved closer and is gazing at him from a couple of feet away. it's silent in the soda shop.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{well see ... they're both running away huck and the slave ... and ... they go up the river ... but in trying to get free they sort of see that they're free already.}
<A>__{david looks immediately down to the blank pages of the book that aren't blank anymore. rows and rows of fresh new type materialize in front of him. he turns to the back of the book, that is complete with a color illustration.}
<C>__{david }
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{oh my god. 2nd boy wow! 3rd boy do you know this one?}
<A>__{he shoves another book in front of david.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{hunh?}
<P>__{(looks down at the book)}
<D>__{oh yeah ... well this is great.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{see holden caulfield is like this really lonely kid...}
