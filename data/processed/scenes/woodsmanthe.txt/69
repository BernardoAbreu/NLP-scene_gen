<A>__{walter stands alone at his bus stop. as he waits, he sees the white volvo turn a corner and pull up in front of the school. whe bus pulls up to the stop, obscuring walter's view. he quickly gets on and moves to the back, looking for candy's car. it is nowhere in sight, the place where it had parked, empty. walter sits down and stares ahead, numb.}
