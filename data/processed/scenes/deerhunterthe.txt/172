<L>__{interior nick's trailer night}
<A>__{linda is asleep lying on her back, arms flung out across the pillows, like a dancer leaping. nick stands beside the bed, wrapped in a blanket, looking down at her. after a moment he draws the covers over her, fusses with her slippers until they are straight and then goes to the window.}
<L>__{exterior street in front of nick's trailer (nick's pov) night}
<A>__{the wind is blowing. bits of trash skitter and swirl in the frozen ruts and a cat comes by, meowing. suddenly a man appears walking slowly down the street. the man is elegantly dressed in western attire, wearing a tailored suit with vest, polished boots and a stetson hat. as the man draws under the light of a street lamp he pauses, looking at nick's trailer. the man is merle, or if not merle it is a face so strikingly}
<B>__{similar that nick almost lets out a cry.}
<A>__{the man under the street lamp pauses, just for an instant,}
<B>__{then he turns and moves on down the street.}
