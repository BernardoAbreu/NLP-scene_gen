<A>__{ingolstadt establishing angles day high white clouds in a blazing blue sky. church steeples rising among the rooftops. beautiful. boarding house day frau brach trudges heavily up a long, steep, narrow flight of stairs with victor teetering uneasily behind.}
<C>__{frau brach}
<D>__{no real rooms left. all we've got is attic space. no one ever wants the attic space...}
<A>__{attic space garret day she leads him into an immensely long space running a twisted path the entire length of the building; various levels and areas unhindered by wall separation, massive vaulted beams crisscrossing as understructure to the roof. daylight filters dimly through dozens of dormer windows and skylights coated with grime. nooks and crannies abound.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{this will do nicely.}
<A>__{university day a monumental structure of brick. a bell tower tolls. dead leaves scurry across the lawn. lecture hall day professor krempe, a squat little man, paces before the packed galleries of eager young students.}
<C>__{krempe}
<D>__{in science, the letter of fact is the letter of law. our pursuit is as dogmatic as any religious precept. think of yourselves as disciples of a strict and hallowed sect. someday you may be priests... but only if you learn the scripture chapter and verse.}
<P>__{(off their laughter)}
<D>__{any questions?}
<C>__{victor}
<P>__{(hand shoots up)}
<D>__{but surely, professor, you don't intend we disregard the more... philosophical works.}
<C>__{krempe}
<D>__{philosophical?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{those which stir the imagination as well as the intellect. paracelsus, for one.}
<A>__{this reference is lost on all but a few. at the faculty table: professor waldman peers up at victor, adjusting the glasses on his nose. up among the students: henry clerval leans out and shoots an amused look in victor's direction. schiller catches henry's look and rolls his eyes.}
<C>__{krempe}
<D>__{paracelsus?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{or albertus magnus. cornelius agrippa...}
<C>__{krempe}
<D>__{what is your name?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{victor frankenstein, sir.}
<P>__{(no response)}
<D>__{of geneva.}
<C>__{krempe}
<D>__{of geneva.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{tell me, mr. frankenstein of geneva. do you wish to study medicine? or mysticism?}
<A>__{titters sweep the room. krempe remains staunchly unamused:}
<C>__{krempe}
<D>__{those of you unfamiliar with mr. frankenstein's suggested reading list... thankfully, that would be most of you... would be well advised to avoid it. here at ingolstadt, we concern ourselves with immutable reality...}
<P>__{(specific to victor)}
<D>__{...not the ravings of lunatics and alchemists hundreds of years in their graves. understood?}
<A>__{victor is flushed and humiliated. held like to say more, but wisely swallows his anger and nods.}
<C>__{krempe}
<D>__{i am relieved. are there any relevant questions?}
<P>__{(there are none)}
<D>__{lecture hall dismissed.}
