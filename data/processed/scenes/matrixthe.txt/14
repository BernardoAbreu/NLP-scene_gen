<L>__{interior apartment}
<A>__{an older chicago apartment; a series of halls connects a chain of small high ceilinged rooms lined with heavy casements. smoke hangs like a veil, blurring the few lights there are. dressed predominantly in black, people are everywhere, gathered in cliques around pieces of furniture like jungle cats around a tree. neo stands against a wall, alone, sipping from a bottle of beer, feeling completely out of place, he is about to leave when he notices a woman staring at him. the woman is trinity. she walks straight up to him. in the nearest room, shadow like figures grind against each other to the pneumatic beat of industrial music.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{hello, neo.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{how did you know that }
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{i know a lot about you. i've been wanting to meet you for some time.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{my name is trinity.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{trinity? the trinity? the trinity that cracked the i.r.s. kansas city d base?}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{that was a long time ago.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{gee zus.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{i just thought... you were a guy.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{most guys do.}
<A>__{neo is a little embarrassed.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{do you want to go sorewhere and talk?}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{no. it's safe here and i don't have much time.}
<A>__{the music is so loud they must stand very close, talking directly into each other's ear.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{that was you on the board tonight. that was your note, wasn't it?}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{i had to gamble that you would see and they wouldn't.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{who wouldn't?}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{i can't explain everything to you. i'm sure that it's all going to seem very strange, but i brought you here to warn you, neo. you are in a lot of danger.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{what? why?}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{they're watching you. something happened and they found out about you. normally, if our target is exposed we let it go. but this time, we can't do that.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{i don't understand }
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{you came here because you wanted to know the answer to a hacker's question.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{the matrix. what is the matrix?}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{twelve years ago i met a man, a great man, who said that no one could be told the answer to that question. that they had to see it, to believe it.}
<A>__{her body is against his; her lips very close to his ear.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{he told me that no one should look for the answer unless they have to because once you see it, everything changes. your life and the world you live in will never be the same. it's as if you wake up one morning and the sky is falling.}
<A>__{there is a hypnotic quality to her voice and neo feels the words like a drug, seeping into him.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{the truth is out there, neo. it's looking for you and it will find you, if you want it to.}
<A>__{she takes hold of him with her eyes.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{that's all i can tell you right now. good bye, neo. and good luck.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{wait. who was it? who was the man?}
<A>__{she leans close, her lips alrost touching his ear as she whispers.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{you know who.}
<A>__{she turns and he watches her melt into the shifting wall of bodies. a sound rises steadily, growing out of the music, pressing in on neo until it is all he can hear as we }
