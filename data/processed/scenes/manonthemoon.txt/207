<C>__{andy}
<D>__{uh, yes... that's true. but he's also ordained in holistic medicine.}
<A>__{on george he glares, stewing. george is fed up. on andy an unspoken tension. then suddenly, he breaks down.}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{george, what am i supposed to do?! i'm sick, and i'm tryin' to get better... but everyone's lookin' at me funny! even you come to my home and act like i'm puttin' on a skit!}
