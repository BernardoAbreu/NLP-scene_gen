<B>__{dorn}
<A>__{doing sit ups in the infield. vaughn walks by and smiles. longshot practice field practically every member of the team is doing penalty calisthenics somewhere on the field.}

<D>__{we got anybody left playin' baseball out there?}
<L>__{interior the locker room afternoon}
<A>__{taylor, hayes and vaughn drag in, looking beat from the day's workout.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{shit, the way i played today, i wouldn't be surprised if they red tagged me already.}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{what do ya mean?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{red tag in your locker means the manager wants to see you, 'cause you just died and went to the minors.}
<A>__{vaughn's hand freezes on his locker latch, afraid to open it now.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{don't worry, they don't cut anybody the first day.}
<A>__{vaughn is still not so sure. he sits down on his locker stool and glances over toward steve harris a starting pitcher, whose locker is adjacent. as harris takes off his jersey we see three splotches of greasy substances on his chest, just inside the button line.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{what is that stuff?}
<C>__{harris}
<P>__{(pointing to them in order)}
<D>__{crisco, bardahl, vagisil. any one of 'em will give you another 2 3 inches drop on your curve ball.}
<A>__{vaughn can't believe this.}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{course if it's cold and i got a shirt on under my jersey, i just rub a little jalapeno inside my nose and get it runnin'. i need to load up the ball a little, i just wipe my nose.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<P>__{(revolted)}
<D>__{you put snot on the ball?}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{at my age, you put anything you can find on it. i haven't got an arm like yours.}
<A>__{vaughn just looks at him incredulous.}
<B>__{taylor and carrano}
<A>__{taylor is undressing, but his attention is diverted by cerrano whose stall is right next to him. cerrano has set up an altar in his locker. in front of his bats, which are lined up like sentinels, is a table covered with pictures of baseball players, figurines of saints, several lit candles and, in the middle, a primitive fetish doll with a cigar in its mouth. cerrano has drawn some magic signs on his bats. he finishes an incantation and then lights the cigar on the fetish doll.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{what are you doin' there, pedro?}
<C>__{cerrano}
<D>__{bats. they are sick.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{so are mine. is somethin' goin' around?}
<C>__{cerrano}
<D>__{no hit curve ball. straight ball, hit it very much. curve ball, bats are afraid. i ask jo buu to come. take fear from bats.}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{jo buu?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{maybe he's the pagan saint of baseball.}
<C>__{cerrano}
<D>__{i offer him cigars and gin. he will come.}
<A>__{cerrano pours some gin in a small cup and puts it next to the fetish doll. harris has been listening to all this. cerrano grabs a towel to head for the showers.}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{i wouldn't leave this gin sittin' around out here with this group.}
<C>__{cerrano}
<P>__{(with a certain gravity)}
<D>__{is very bad to steal jo buu's gin. is very bad.}
<A>__{cerrano closes his locker and goes off to the showers, leaving everyone to wonder just how bad.}
<B>__{omit}
<B>__{montage sequence}
<A>__{compressing and detailing the progress of spring training. we see: a) vaughn on the pitcher's mound. a tin replica of a batter has been set up at home plate and rope stretched across the plate to delineate the strike zone. vaughn fires a pitch and hits the tin batter in the hip, leaving a dent in him. b) cerrano in the batting cage, flailing away in futility at several curve balls. c) hayes doing push ups at night. he's the only one left on the field, except temple, who supervises. d) taylor doing the "scramble" drill blocking down balls purposely thrown in the dirt, one after another. when it ends, he can hardly get to his feet. e) cerrano waving a ten foot boa constrictor in the sign of the cross in front of his locker before opening it. no red tag greets him. hayes watches from a safe distance. f) vaughn holding a mirror under the vents on his locker door to get a peek inside to see if there's a red tag there. g) dorn taking a hard ground ball off the chest. brown applauds. dorn is pissed. h) vaughn throwing at the "ropes" again. the tin batter is dented in every conceivable place now. vaughn whips in another fast ball. this one hits the tin man in the head, knocking it completely off. i) taylor in an exhibition game, attempting to throw out a base stealer. jake springs out of his crouch and fires down to second on a bounce. the ball skips into center field. j) hayes also in an exhibition game, swinging at a pitch and popping it up behind the plate. he just drops in his tracks and starts to do push ups as the catcher makes the catch behind him. k) cerrano flailing away again at a curve ball. this and the remaining shots are all in exhibition games. l) hayes waving a ten inch garter snake in front of his locker. even at this size we can tell it scares the hell out of him, but it works its magic. no red tag. m) vaughn with a runner on third, winding up and throwing a pitch four feet over taylor's head. the run scores. n) hayes attempting to steal second. he goes into a hell bent for leather head first slide. unfortunately, he comes up two feet short of the base. the second baseman, who's waiting for him with the ball, makes a motion for him to keep coming. hayes flips him the bird. o) lou brown on the bench. he turns to pepper with a look that says, "can you believe this shit?" p) taylor waiting for a throw at the plate. just as he's about to catch it, the runner knocks him flat. q) brown his head in his hands. as taylor gets up and goes to the wrong dugout, the montage ends.}
