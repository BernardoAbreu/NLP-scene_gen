<A>__{eastern white pine wrapped in early morning fog. hazy. floating like a dream. and then the sound of wood splintering... and we find sam alone in this vapor cutting logs with an axe. sweating despite the chill in the air... ... and then a voice from somewhere far off. sam stopping, looking into the haze as a figure materializes... coming toward him calling his name... at first it looks like donnie... but then we see it's lynn... and when she reaches him her look tells us something terrible has happened.}
