<C>__{dan}

<D>__{i kind of just shat in my pants a bit, i'm not gonna lie.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{he llo!!!!!!!!!!!????}
<A>__{parker is starting to shake.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{no one knows we're up here. they forgot that we're up here.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{no they didn't. they couldn't have. i'm sure they have a system or something. there's probably security cameras on us right now.}
<A>__{he starts waving around his hands.}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{hey assholes?! start the chair!!! we're freezing up here!!!}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{what if they don't start it again? what if everyone went home?}
<C>__{dan}
<P>__{(angered out of panic)}
<D>__{will you stop?!}
<B>__{e}
<P>__{(recovering)}
<D>__{they didn't go home. stop freaking me out.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{remind me to knock down that fucking lift operator when we get down. this is horse shit.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{what did you say to the guy?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{me? nothing!}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{well, clearly you pissed him off enough to do this.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i didn't do anything! he knows we're still up here.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{then why are the lights off, dan? is that part of their policy? shut off the lights and scare the customers?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{they just lost power or something. i'm sure it's gonna come back on any second.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{they didn't go home. that's retarded.}
<A>__{after a few more moments.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{this is so messed up.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{it's a power outage. they'll come up with a ladder if they have to.}
<A>__{parker is starting to whimper. in a few more seconds she may even be teetering on full on panic.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{we need to get down from here. we can't just sit up here. why isn't the goddamn chair moving, dan? what the hell?!}
<B>__{e}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{well you being all psycho about it isn't gonna make it move. just chill out.}
<A>__{another few beats.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{don't yell at me.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i wasn't yelling at you but you need to relax. this stuff happens all the time. can you imagine the law suit if they left everyone on this lift up here all night?}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{free lift tickets.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{what other people on the lift? there was no one in front of us.}
<A>__{she made a good pointerior but still...}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{we won't be stuck here all night.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{no. you're right. we won't be here all night. it's sunday.}
<P>__{(she starts crying)}
<D>__{its fucking sunday and they aren't open again until friday.}
<P>__{(sobbing)}
<D>__{we'll be stuck here all week.}
<A>__{silence as dan and lynch take this in.}
<C>__{parker }
<D>__{we're gonna die up here.}
<A>__{lynch tries to be the voice of reason.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{we're not going to be stuck here. parker. parker, look at me. even if by some strange reason they really did forget us up here we can jump. i see people jump off of chair lifts all the time.}
<B>__{e}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{it's true. i've done it before. you just get tired of waiting, you wait for a spot with some serious powder and you just jump. it's actually kind of fun, but they can ban you from the mountain for it.}
<A>__{looking below them, it is way too far a drop to be jumping off of the chair.}
<C>__{parker}
<P>__{(hysterical)}
<D>__{ help!!! somebody please help us!!!! hel lo!!! help!!!!!}
<A>__{she cries into dan's shoulder.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{shh. i know you're scared. i'm scared, too. but any minute now they're gonna turn the power back on and we're all gonna be laughing about this.}
<A>__{more moments pass in silence as they survey their situation. finally...}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i have to pee.}
<A>__{they all share an uncomfortable laugh.}
<C>__{parker }
<D>__{i have to pee wicked bad.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{that makes two of us.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{ew, lynch if you pull out your junk in front of me i'm gonna puke.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{well, what do you want me to do? i gotta go.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{how am i supposed to go?}
<A>__{dan moves the safety bar a little.}
<C>__{dan}
<B>__{e}
<D>__{well if we just lift the bar up you could probably just bend over if we hold on to you.}
<A>__{parker instantly starts freaking out with the bar up.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{are you crazy! put the bar down!!!}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{it's just the safety bar. it doesn't really do anything anyway.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{well i like the safety bar and i like it down where it's supposed to be.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{then how are you going to piss?}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i can hold it.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{for a whole week?}
<A>__{dan and parker glare at him.}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{sorry.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{she's the one who said we'd be here for "a week"!}
<A>__{parker takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{i can hold it.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i'm telling you, five minutes from now we'll all be laughing.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{i'm pissing.}
<A>__{lynch lifts the safety bar up, whips out his business and starts to pee off the side of the chair into the snow below them.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i hope they catch you and throw you out. i hope they ban you from the}
<B>__{e}
<D>__{mountain. that's so nasty.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{ban me from the mountain? you couldn't pay me to come back here. make me sit up here in below zero weather forever while they get their damn fisher price lift working? sorry. not coming back.}
<A>__{lynch finishes his business.}
<C>__{lynch }
<D>__{there. much better.}
<A>__{a low thunder clap rolls in across the trees and the chilling wind picks up.}
<D>__{dan parker lynch help! hel lo! up here!}
<A>__{they continue to scream their heads off for a few moments until freezing sleet starts falling all around them, soaking them through to the bone. almost instantly, giant balls of hail stream down at them. "ping ing" off of the metal chair and pelting their faces. the wind blows hard as their flimsy chair swings back and forth in the foul weather. parker sobs quietly into dan's shoulder.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{somebody get us down from here! help!}
<C>__{dan}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{put the safety bar down, joe.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{somebody please help us!}
<C>__{dan}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{put the bar down.}
<C>__{lynch}
<D>__{someone }
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{put the bar down!}
<A>__{lynch pulls the bar down and sulks, looking away from dan. the hail sleet mixture keeps pelting against their skin as they sit together in silence. another loud thunder clap hits. this time, much closer.}
