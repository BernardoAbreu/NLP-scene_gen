<L>__{interior scarab chamber day}
<A>__{the warden crawls into a dark chamber and lights a torch. a mural wall comes alive. embedded into it are dozens of black amethyst scarabs; glittering images of the sacred beetles. awestruck, the warden pulls out a pocket knife and starts prying away at one of the precious bugs.}
<L>__{interior anubis' chamber day}
<A>__{beni and the americans hover around the egyptologist, who's found the secret compartment inside anubis. the egyptologist brushes sand away from the seam. henderson steps forward and grabs the seam, the egyptologist quickly stops him.}
<C>__{egyptologist}
<D>__{seti was no fool.}
<A>__{henderson sees the intense look in the egyptologist's eyes}
<C>__{henderson}
<D>__{yeah, sure...}
<A>__{he looks back at the native diggers.}
<C>__{henderson}
<D>__{we'll let him open it.}
<A>__{the egyptologist nods, then yells in egyptian at the diggers. the diggers hesitate, filled with fear. daniels pulls out his gun, aims it at three of the diggers. the three diggers hesitantly step forward with crowbars and stick them into the seams. the other diggers back away, scared shitless. beni and the americans exchange looks, and then they back away as well.}
