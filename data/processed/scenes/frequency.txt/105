<A>__{john knocks on the door. it opens to reveal a jamaican woman clutching a crying infant, a toddler hanging off her leg. behind them we half recognize julia's apartment. we know it's her apartment because of the bay window and the view of the george washington bridge. but everything else is different. different furniture. different pain job. john stands speechless. the jamaican woman regards him...}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{but this is her place. 910 riverside. apartment 3c.}
<C>__{jamaican woman}
<D>__{i'm sorry, but no one by that name lives here.}
<A>__{john just stands there, lost, questioning his grip on reality. liquor on his breath, fear in his eyes, he is a scary sight. jamaican woman does the smart thing she slams the door.}
