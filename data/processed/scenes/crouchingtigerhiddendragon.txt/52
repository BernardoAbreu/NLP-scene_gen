<A>__{the governess leaves, a small sack over her back.}

<A>__{li practices fluently with green destiny in hand, beautifully at ease with the weapon. he spins around to find yu standing in the doorway.}
<C>__{yu}
<D>__{the sword is back... are you happy?}
<A>__{li smiles.}
<C>__{li}
<D>__{i admit, getting it back makes me realize how much i'd missed it.}
<C>__{yu}
<D>__{but it's not your sword anymore. you gave it to sir te.}
<C>__{li}
<D>__{true. but i must borrow it for one last mission. jade fox must die at its edge. did you know what you were hiding when you covered for that girl?}
<C>__{yu}
<D>__{my job was to get the sword back, without embarassing anyone. i wasn't about to ruin her life, or her father's.}
<C>__{li}
<D>__{you did your job well. but, this girl... i saw her last night.}
<C>__{yu}
<D>__{i knew she would intrigue you.}
<C>__{li}
<D>__{she needs direction... and training.}
<C>__{yu}
<D>__{she's an aristocrat's daughter. she's not one of us. in any case, it will all be over soon. you'll kill fox, and she'll marry.}
<C>__{li}
<D>__{that's not for her. she should come to wudan and become a disciple.}
<C>__{yu}
<D>__{but wudan does not accept women.}
<C>__{li}
<D>__{for her, they might make an exception. if not, i'm afraid she'll become a poisoned dragon.}
<C>__{yu}
<D>__{it's not our affair. even if wudan accepts her, her husband might object.}
<C>__{li}
<D>__{i thought by giving away the sword, i could escape the giang hu world. but the cycle of bloodshed continues.}
<C>__{yu}
<D>__{i wish there were something more i could do to help you.}
<C>__{li}
<D>__{just be patient with me, shu lien.}
