<L>__{int bridal suite night}
<A>__{victor enters to find the room aglow with dozens of candles. elizabeth turns from the fireplace, her body silhouetted through the sheer white nightgown.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{you're soaking.}
<A>__{she approaches, peels off his coat. victor stares at her, awe struck. she sees the look in his eyes, crosses her arms demurely... then laughs at her own modesty.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{brother and sister no more.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{now husband and wife.}
<A>__{he strokes her bare shoulders with his fingertips.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{i remember the first time i ever saw you. crossing the floor of the grand ballroom with my parents at your side. so beautiful even then.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<P>__{(a whisper)}
<D>__{i have been waiting for this ever since.}
<A>__{she leans up and gives him a kiss that would melt glass, triggering the sexiest seduction imaginable... ...kissing, caressing, victor stripping off his wet shirt, camera drifting around them in slow circles, candles spinning like a fever that's been building for a lifetime... and now onto the bed. magnificent and canopied. kneeling together, bodies touching, hands seeking, mouths joining... elizabeth lying back, beckoning for him to love her. victor sinking down, running his hands up her thighs, peeling up the nightgown, making her shudder with desire... ...and a shot fires. victor jerks up. he can hear shouting. he rolls off the bed, snatching up both pistols lying primed and ready on the nightstand.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{victor!}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{open this door for no one!}
