<L>__{179a. interior cave of swimmers. torchlight.}
<A>__{almasy returns with the stocks of acacia twigs the expedition had cached. as he makes the fire, the light sends his shadow flitting across the walls.}
<C>__{katharine}
<D>__{shall we be all right?}
<C>__{almasy}
<D>__{yes. absolutely.}
<C>__{katharine}
<P>__{(with a laugh)}
<D>__{oh dear.}
<C>__{almasy}
<P>__{(as he works)}
<D>__{listen to me, katharine. you've broken your ankle and i'm going to have to try and bind it. i think your wrist might be broken, too and some ribs, which is why it's hurting you to breathe. i'm going to have to walk to el taj. given all the traffic in the desert these days i should bump into one army or another before i reach there or fenelon barnes and his camel. and then i will be back and we'll be fine, and i will never leave you.}
<A>__{the fire is lit and he comes over to her, kneels beside her.}
<C>__{katharine}
<D>__{do you promise? i wouldn't want to die here. i wouldn't want to die in the desert. i've always had a rather elaborate funeral in mind, with particular hymns. very english. and i know exactly where i want to be buried. in our garden. where i grew up. with a view of the sea. so promise me you'll come back for you.}
<C>__{almasy}
<D>__{i promise i will come back. i promise i will never leave you. and there's plenty of water and food. you can have a party.}
<A>__{he kisses her tenderly. pulls out his herodotus and lays it beside her. then he puts down the flashlight.}
<C>__{almasy}
<D>__{and a good read.}
<P>__{(of the flashlight battery)}
<D>__{don't waste it.}
<C>__{katharine}
<D>__{thank you.}
<P>__{(clouds over)}
<D>__{will you bury geoffrey? i know he's dead.}
<C>__{almasy}
<D>__{i'm sorry, katharine.}
<C>__{katharine}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{almasy}
<D>__{every night i cut out my heart but in the morning it was full again.}
<A>__{he's tearing strips from the parachute with his knife. as he starts to bind her wrist he gets her to talk, trying to distract her from the pain.}
<C>__{almasy}
<D>__{tell me about your garden.}
<C>__{katharine}
<P>__{(tries to focus)}
<D>__{our garden, our garden not so much the garden, but the copse alongside it, wild, a secret way plunging down to the shore and then nothing but water between you and france. the devil's chimney it was called }
<P>__{(he pulls tight on the binding)}
<D>__{the devil's chimney, i don't know why.}
<P>__{(he kisses her)}
<D>__{darling. my darling.}
