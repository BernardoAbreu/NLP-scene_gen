<L>__{interior ntsb hangar the remains of flight 227 day}
<A>__{whip is now alone in the huge, brightly lit hangar. he sees the plane. the jr 88 has all of its pieces laying as close together as possible. like the skeleton of a t rex in a museum. the sight is awesome, breathtaking. whip walks closer to the twisted wreck and stops. whip is overwhelmed by the sight and as he is about to leave... charlie steps out of the passenger door and calls down to}
<B>__{whip.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{here's our guy. c'mon.}
<A>__{whip walks towards a ramp that leads up to the hole in the plane where the door used to be. charlie stands at the top of the ramp. suddenly hugh steps out of the plane...}
<C>__{hugh}
<D>__{captain whitaker, we've won. whip doesn't move as hugh starts down the ramp.}
<C>__{hugh }
<D>__{this is what we call in my profession a "walk over."}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{they've scheduled the hearing. it's in 10 days.}
<A>__{charlie and hugh reach the bottom of the ramp.}
<C>__{hugh}
<D>__{but these hearings can be tough. you just need to stay sharp and on course and answer the questions correctly. it's no longer a question of your condition but the condition of the plane.}
<A>__{this picks directly at the scab of whip's guilt.}
<C>__{hugh }
<D>__{i've had an "act of god" successfully added to the list of probable causes.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{look, it's simple. i flew a broken plane.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you got it. that's right.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{and what about my toxicology report?}
<C>__{hugh}
<P>__{(trying to stay calm)}
<D>__{i killed it. they have no physical proof that you were intoxicated on that plane. and no eye witness claims. but there's a problem.}
<A>__{this stops whip cold.}
<C>__{hugh }
<D>__{because of the turbulence at the beginning of the flight and then the crash, there was never any drink service on the flight. but, they found two little vodka bottles in the galley trash bin. there was no physical evidence found on the bottles, no dna, no finger prints. but both the bottles were uncapped and empty. the only people who had access to those bottles and could have drank them were the flight crew. margaret, evans and camelia satou all had clean tox reports. that leaves you and trina marquez.}
<A>__{they let that land. whip nods.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{okay. i see...where this is going. that's funny that they found two bottles.}
<C>__{hugh}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{because i drank three. one's missing.}
<A>__{hugh explodes in frustration.}
<C>__{hugh lang}
<D>__{when i met you i couldn't believe what a flip, drunk, arrogant scumbag you were.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{fuck you too, hugh.}
<C>__{hugh lang}
<D>__{but i did the research and heard the analysis from the experts. i'm in awe of what you did.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{can i go now?}
<A>__{hugh gets big as he has to add the final piece of credence to the coronation.}
<C>__{hugh lang}
<D>__{the ntsb and the faa took 10 experienced pilots and placed them in simulators. they recreated all of the events that led to this plane falling out of the sky!}
<A>__{hugh is so loud and emotional even whip lends focus.}
<C>__{hugh lang }
<D>__{do you know how many were able to safely land these broken planes?}
<A>__{everyone waits for the response as hugh acknowledges the debris around them...}
<C>__{hugh lang }
<D>__{not one. every pilot crashed and killed everyone on board.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{yeah. so?}
<C>__{hugh}
<D>__{you have no capacity to accept the responsibility for the miracle you performed and the lives you saved.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{great. i'm going home.}
<A>__{whip pulls out his cigarettes and frees a smoke from the pack.}
<C>__{hugh lang}
<D>__{do you want to go to prison? i'm trying to save your life!}
<A>__{charlie steps between them as this exchange spirals.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{what fucking life?! don't kill yourself on my account, hugh.}
<A>__{whip starts to walk away.}
<C>__{hugh}
<D>__{okay, i'm done here. i'm running out a faith that this guy's gonna make it, charlie.}
<C>__{whip}
<P>__{(turns on hugh)}
<D>__{you wanna talk about me like i'm not here? like i'm fucking dead?}
<C>__{hugh}
<P>__{(to whip now)}
<D>__{this ntsb hearing is a federal agency hearing. do you understand that? it's in 10 days and if i show up with you like this?!}
<A>__{whip turns and walks. hugh wheels on charlie and lights him up.}
<C>__{hugh }
<D>__{everything we've done? everything i've done? goes out the window. that's not on me. i did my job. it's your job, charlie, to get him straight and get him to the church on time.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{yeah charlie just get him home. sober him up long enough to save the union's contract and that fat fuck's airline. fuck you. i shoulda died on that plane.}
<A>__{whip walks away from them away from the bright, clean, shiny floor of the hangar and into the growing rain storm.}
