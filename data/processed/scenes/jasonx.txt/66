<T>__{one of the aliens is cut in half:}
<A>__{! green goo squirts from its body.}
<C>__{azrael}
<D>__{what the?!}
<B>__{jason voorhees}
<A>__{slashes through another alien, splitting it down the middle. then another.}
<C>__{dallas}
<D>__{he's good.}
<A>__{azrael smiles knowingly. he takes aim and lets loose a blast at jason. aliens scatter as the blasts hits jason dead on. dallas joins in unloading on the hulinking terror. their assault has no effect on jason whatsoever.}
<C>__{dallas}
<D>__{that sucks. why won't he go down?}
<C>__{azrael}
<D>__{pause play.}
<A>__{suddenly the aliens freeze in place. jason stares at them, then turns to dallas and azrael.}
<C>__{dallas}
<D>__{he's not part of the program.}
<C>__{azrael}
<D>__{hey cool. they brought ancient hockey guy back to life.}
<A>__{jason walks up to them. titls his head like a dog hearing a high pitched whistle. why aren't they running.}
<C>__{azrael}
<D>__{hey! we're playing a game here. get off the court!}
<A>__{jason raises his silver blade high.}
<C>__{dallas}
<D>__{no, we're playing a game...not you numbnuts...}
<A>__{slash! the blade slices through azrael's shoulder to the bottom of his rib cage. blood spurts as his right side pulls away from his body. azrael does not seem hurt, only pissed.}
<C>__{azrael}
<D>__{asshole that does not count as a kill.}
<C>__{dallas}
<D>__{yes it does.}
<C>__{azrael}
<D>__{oh, come on!}
<A>__{jason is confused. he spins and slashed taking dallas' head clean off. the head falls to the ground, then dallas speaks.}
<C>__{dallas}
<D>__{okay, enough of this shit.}
<C>__{azrael}
<D>__{alright, asshole.}
<A>__{the sound of an engine shutting down. jason finds himself standing alone on a huge open court, all white, sterile. no creatures, no dallas or azrael. a both ends of the white garganuan room we see a small tinted glass. azrael's voice booms over a loud speaker.}
<C>__{azrael}
<D>__{clear off the court, asshole.}
