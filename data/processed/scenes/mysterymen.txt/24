<A>__{in a weedy overgrown far corner of the junkyard sally and furious stand looking a big old hunk of a military vehicle. it is a herkimer battle jitney, a heavily armored, windowless, soundproof, personnel carrier (designed by the pentagon in the fifties to take congressmen on battlefield fact finding tours). overgrown with weeds, home to an extended family of pigeons, its fighting days (if it ever had any) are over.}
