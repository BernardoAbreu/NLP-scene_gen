<A>__{josie walks down the hall, purposefully she is on a mission. groups of kids stop and stare at her, but this time, josie doesn't even notice. as josie rounds a corner, she comes face to face with guy, who is at his locker. he looks at her. she smiles. and now it is guy that is nervous. he drops a pile of papers, tries awkwardly to gather them. josie looks at him and for the first time we see it register on her face this guy is just a seventeen year old kid.}
