<A>__{posed in an alert stance, duke breaks into a run, loping gracefully across the lawn to harry, where he assumes a sitting position upon the command:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{duke, platz!}
<P>__{(to joan)}
<D>__{always the name first, and then the command.}
<A>__{she stands off to the side, repeating the command and studiously writing it down in a small notebook.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{now, in regard to any aggressor seeking to give you a bad time, i want to show you what you can expect from a dog of this caliber.}
<A>__{he takes hold of the dog's muzzle, lifting the lips to reveal the large scimitar like canines:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{here we have the dog's arsenal, so to speak. the animal is trained to apply pressure to specific points of the body until the bone is more or less crushed.}
<P>__{(releasing the muzzle)}
<D>__{if the attacker is bearing a weapon of any kind, be it a gun, a club, a knife or what have you, the dog will, excuse me for saying...}

<P>__{his crotch)}
<D>__{... automatically go for the testicles.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{oh god, what if i don't want him to do that?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you want him to do that.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{no, i just want him to scare someone.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{believe me, this will scare them, as well as incapacitate their mind and any ability to maneuver against you.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{you know, i have an extremely sensitive reaction to dog dander, so maybe i shouldn't...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{let me ask you something. i like to get a general picture of the individual situation i'm working with.}
<A>__{he pauses to light a cigarette, making a quick, reflexive appraisal of her contours as he does:}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{are you married, single, living alone or with some other party?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i'm in the process of a divorce and i moved up here because my apartment was burglarized and...}
<P>__{(suddenly mistrustful)}
<D>__{but i'm not entirely alone, there's a housekeeper here, and several friends.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well, the hills are hit heaven as far as burglaries go. and right up on mulholland is where they found the fifth victim of the westside slasher...}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{no, please, don't tell me about that.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{believe me, i know what you're up against, being an attractive, and i take it, unattached woman, such as you are...}
<P>__{(flicking his cigarettte away)}
<D>__{but we're going to remedy that situation right now, and get you to feeling as safe as a little baby, alright?}
<P>__{(indicating her notebook)}
<D>__{what've we got there so far?}
<C>__{joan}
<P>__{(reading her notes)}
<D>__{ober, platz, geh am platz, bringen, komm, sitz, fuss', fahrt and blieb.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well, that's enough for a start on the basic control commands...}
<A>__{he scans the grounds for signs of something we as yet know nothing of:}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{now let's do a little work with the assailant.}
