<A>__{now rose is testifying. the court is quiet, focused.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{i want to move on now to the march. as i understand it, you and your daughter were marched for many months.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{yes. it was the winter of 1944. our camp was closed down, we were told we had to move on. but the plan kept changing every day. women were dying all around us in the snow. half of us died on the march. my daughter says in the book, less a death march, more a death gallop.}
<A>__{michael looks along the row to where ilana is now sitting.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{please tell us about the night in the church.}
<A>__{michael watches as rose looks across to ilana. ilana stares back at her. michael watches the exchange as rose nods, as if accepting she must go ahead and speak.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{that night we actually thought we were lucky because we had a roof over our heads. we'd arrived in a village, as always, the guards took the best quarters, they took the priest's house. but they let us sleep in a church. there was a bombing raid. in the middle of the night. at first we could only hear the fire, it was in the steeple. then we could see burning beams, and they began to crash to the floor. everyone rushed, rushed to the doors. but the doors had been locked on the outside.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{the church burned down? nobody came to open the doors? is that right?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{nobody.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{even though you were all burning to death?}
<A>__{rose nods.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{how many people were killed?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{everyone was killed.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{how did you survive?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i needed to get away from the other women. because they were panicking, they were screaming. i couldn't stand it. i couldn't stand their screaming. i was more frightened of the other women than i was of the fire. so i too my daughter and led her to the upper floor. i can't defend what i did. it's impossible to defend. i took ilana in my arms and i led her towards the fire. there was a small gallery at the side of the church on the upper level. it saved our lives. the gallery didn't burn.}
<A>__{rose turns, in tears, to look at ilana.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{thank you. i want to thank you for coming to this country today to testify.}
