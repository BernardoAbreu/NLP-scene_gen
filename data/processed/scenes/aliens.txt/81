<A>__{sitting huddles in a chair, arms around her knees. looking at a point in space.}
<C>__{gorman}
<P>__{(o.s.)}
<D>__{what's her name again?}
<C>__{dietrich}
<P>__{(o.s.)}
<D>__{rebecca.}
<A>__{wider angle revealing gorman sitting in front of her while dietrich watches the readouts from a bio monitoring cuff wrapped around newt's tiny arm.}
<C>__{gorman}
<D>__{now think, rebecca. concentrate. just start at the beginning...}
<A>__{no response. ripley enters, carrying a coffee mug.}
<C>__{gorman}
<D>__{where are your parents? you have to try...}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{gorman! give it a rest would you.}
<A>__{gorman stands with a sigh of dismissal.}
<C>__{gorman}
<D>__{total brain lock.}
<C>__{dietrich}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{physically she's okay. borderline malnutrition, but i don't think any permanent damage.}
<A>__{she unsnaps the bio monitoring cuff.}
<C>__{gorman}
<D>__{come on, we're wasting our time.}
<A>__{gorman and the others exit, leaving only ripley with newt. through the window of the office, out on the main floor of the operations room, we see gorman join burke and bishop at a computer terminal. ripley kneels beside newt, brushing the girl's unkempt hair out of her eyes in a gentle, maternal fashion.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{here, try this. a little instant hot chocolate.}
<A>__{she wraps the child's hands around the cup. raises it to her lips for her. the girl drinks mechanically, spilling down her chin.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(soothing)}
<D>__{poor thing. you don't talk much do you? that's okay by me. most people do a lot of talking and they wind up not saying very much.}
<A>__{she sets the cup down and wipes the child's chin clean.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{uh oh. i made a clean spot here. now i've done it. guess i will just have to do the whole thing.}
<A>__{she pours water from a squeeze bottle onto a small cloth and gently washes the little girl's face. newt's eyes seem to focus on her for the first time.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{hard to believe...there's a little girl under all this. and a pretty one at that.}
<A>__{newt gazes at her. ripley smiles.}
