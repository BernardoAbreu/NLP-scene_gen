<A>__{a cleaning woman vacuums as an elevator door dings and opens. out comes paddy. the casino is nearly empty, the only sounds coming from the tinny ringing of a handful of slot machines. from a distance, paddy spots tommy sitting at the far end of a bank of triple 7 american glory slot machines, mechanically feeding the slot from a tray full of silver and pulling the lever with a thousand yard stare. paddy approaches tommy, who doesn't acknowledge him.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{can't sleep, huh?}
<A>__{tommy feeds the machine and pulls. says nothing. paddy sits down in front of a slot machine next to tommy.}
<C>__{paddy }
<D>__{i know that other thing's bothering the hell out of you, but i'm proud of you. what you did for that kid in the tank? that was really something.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{how about deserting my unit? is that really something, too? yeah. i was on my way outta country when i came across those guys. what was i supposed to do, let `em drown?}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what'd you do?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{what'd i do? i took off.}
<A>__{paddy starts putting things together.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{that's why you go by riordan. that's why the press can't find your service records.}
<A>__{tommy doesn't respond.}
<C>__{paddy }
<D>__{what the hell happened over there, tommy?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{that is none of your business.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{come on, kiddo. i've been there. i've done it. i've seen it. you can trust me. i will understand.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{spare me the compassionate father routine, pop. the suit don't fit.}
<C>__{paddy}
<D>__{i'm really trying here, tommy.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{you're trying? now? where were you when it mattered? i needed this guy back when i was a kid. i don't need you now. it's too late now. everything's already happened. you and brendan don't seem to understand that. let me explain something to you: the only thing i have in common with brendan conlon is that we have absolutely no use for you.}
<A>__{paddy's shaken. he can't fathom the anger in tommy, yet he knows he's responsible. it's written all over him. tears well up in his eyes. they seem to make tommy madder.}
<C>__{tommy }
<D>__{look at you. yeah, i was right. i think i liked you better when you were a drunk. at least you had some balls then. not like now. tip toeing around like some beggar with your cup out. take it somewhere else, old man.}
<A>__{tommy reaches down and picks up a plastic cup made for holding coins and dips it into his tray, filling it with}
<B>__{quarters.}
<C>__{tommy }
<D>__{in fact, you know what? here's a cup. why don't you take this and go buy some more of your shitty tapes?}
<C>__{tommy }
<D>__{go back to the room and listen to some more fish stories no one gives a shit about. go on, get outta here.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{get the fuck outta here!}
<A>__{tommy whips the bucket toward his father, splashing coins into his face. a stunned paddy, tears streaming down his face, walks off. a handful of late night gamblers look at tommy, who stares angrily ahead and bounces a quarter off his slot machine as his destroyed father limps away.}
