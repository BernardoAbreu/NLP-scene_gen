<L>__{exterior studio lot day}
<A>__{viktor's face against the sky. as he walks, we reveal that the sky is no more than a huge, painted backdrop on the studio lot behind a parking lot. viktor hands his valet ticket to a fawning valet manager.}
<C>__{valet manager}
<D>__{ just be a minute, mr. taransky. we gave you a complimentary car wash they're washing the engine now.}
<A>__{viktor joins other industry movers and shakers waiting for their cars under an umbrella. a young talent agent approaches.}
<C>__{talent agent}
<D>__{viktor! look, i'm sorry i didn't call you back last year. i was, er... out of the country.}
<P>__{(strained moment)}
<D>__{but we should get together. my schedule's wide open.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{sure, i will... "call you".}
<A>__{the agent's face falls. he gets in his car, disconsolate. suddenly, hal sinclair, rushes over and hugs viktor.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{viktor, i'm so happy for us!}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{hello, hal.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{the film. the chemistry. no reflections on nicola but simone and i we were just so right together.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{you never were together, hal.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{and still the connection was undeniable.}
<P>__{(aside)}
<D>__{i haven't read "eternity forever" but i know it's brilliant. and i know i would be perfect for clive.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(correcting him)}
<D>__{clyde.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{yes, perfect.}
<P>__{(lowering his voice)}
<D>__{as a matter of fact, i ran into simone on the lot the other day.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(genuinely startled)}
<D>__{really? she didn't mention it.}
<C>__{hal}
<P>__{(quickly covering)}
<D>__{i'm sure she's meeting with a lot of people right now.}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{she is just as you described her, viktor... indescribable. i strongly sensed she thought i was right for it.}
<A>__{behind his back, viktor surreptitiously presses a button on his cell phone. the phone rings. viktor feigns surprise and answers.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(answering the phone he}
<D>__{has just dialed, louder}
<P>__{than necessary)}
<D>__{hello?... simone! how are you, sweetheart?}
<A>__{a hush descends over the executives. hal is suddenly very uncomfortable. even the valets strain to eavesdrop on the conversation.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(winking to hal)}
<D>__{you'll never guess who i'm with... you ran into him on the lot.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{it was more in passing.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{you're so far off!}
<P>__{(finally chuckles)}
<D>__{hal... hal sinclair... your co star. remember now?... no, i don't think he's put on weight.}
<P>__{(a shrug of apology to the appalled hal)}
<D>__{anyway, you think he's right for "eternity forever"?... not the right type?... a different direction...}
<P>__{(covering phone, to hal)}
<D>__{i will try to talk her into it.}
<A>__{the other industry people make a note of the remark. a mortified hal excuses himself with a pathetic wave, climbing into his car.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{... listen this is a bad place to talk... what?... sweetheart, i know you have charity work you want to do, i know you want to give back but remember, your greatest gift is your talent... we'll talk about it at the beach house this weekend... i'm looking forward to it too.}
<A>__{viktor hangs up. his car pulls up. he tips extravagantly and drives away. the industry people get on their cell phones.}
