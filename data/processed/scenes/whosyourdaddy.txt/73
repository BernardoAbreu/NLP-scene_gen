<A>__{ted stands on an ottoman as a tailor fits him for a prom tuxedo. he towers over his parents who try to talk to him. we feel for them. they've lost control of their kid.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{you have to understand. this was a big shock, for all of us. one minute you're our little boy, of whom we could not be more proud. the next minute you're the owner of this whole pornographic empire.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{but that doesn't make you the boss of everything, son.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{don't you see how your self involvement and lack of humility are affecting the whole family?}
<A>__{ted looks down at them, literally.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i paid off the mortgage! i ordered that winnebago you always wanted! now you're ashamed of me?}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{you ordered a winnebago?}
<A>__{mom gives dad a look. stick to the script. don't be swayed by presents.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{we're not ashamed of you, teddy. we don't approve of the magazine or the models or the so called "flesh parties" you attend. but we can get past all that.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{we miss you. we miss our son.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{we miss our family.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i promised i'd finish high school and that's what i'm doing. what more do you want from me?}
<A>__{dad glances at mom, hesitant. she nods, giving him the courage to continue.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{we think you should give up the magazine. sell it. let someone else run it. whatever it takes.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{we want you to go to college, find a career you love, marry a nice girl from a nice family, and live happily ever after.}
<A>__{ted laughs.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{that is your dream, not mine. my dream is so far beyond anything you people could even imagine.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{watch your tone, mister.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{why don't you just admit what this is really all about? i'm not your real kid and you can't control me anymore.}
<A>__{mom and dad look stricken. ted doesn't know when to stop...}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{no wonder i was so bored. no wonder i hated this one horse cow town. i come from talented people who took chances and dared to imagine a life without limits! i was never meant to be raised by...grocers.}
<A>__{ted storms away, unintentionally crashing into a treasured family photo on the end table. the frame shatters into smithereens. breaking mom and dad's hearts. stunned silence hangs heavy in the room.}
