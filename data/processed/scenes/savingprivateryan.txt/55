<L>__{exterior outskirts of ramelle day}
<A>__{a gently sloped valley with scattered farm cottages and small, cultivated fields, bordered by ancient, moss covered stone walls. the twos is visible beyond. miller and his men crouch run to the cover of one of the stone walls. miller pulls out his binoculars.}
<B>__{on the far side of the field}
<A>__{there's a large gathering of german troops and vehicles.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{scans the germans with his binoculars.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{looks like tea time, maybe they're brits.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{i sure hope so.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{what do you think they're waiting for, captain?}
<A>__{just then they hear an ominous rumble, deeper and more threatening that that of the convoy. the sound gets louder and louder. miller and his men exchange looks. they know that sound, they don't like it.}
<B>__{four massive german tanks}
<A>__{appear down the road, heading for the german soldiers who greet them enthusiastically. the tanks are tigers, huge, far bigger than an american sherman. each one, sixty two tons, with a big 88 mm gun, four heavy machine guns and impregnable armor. each one, an infantryman's nightmare. there are four of them.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{puts away the binoculars and jerks his head for his men to follow, low, along the wall. the men are happy to do so, looking back nervously at the german tanks.}
