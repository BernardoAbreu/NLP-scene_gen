<L>__{exterior ida's cabin night (splinter unit)}
<A>__{darkness envelops the cabin. a coyote howls.}
<L>__{interior torture room #1 night}
<A>__{sheryl on table, unconscious. her hand finger bandaged. the door's thrown open... deacon throws mike roughly to floor. he's tied per usual. notice: the back of mike's shirt soaked in blood.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{how do you expect me to do this? like this?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{do we need to provide you with some more motivation?}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{you wouldn't want to put that lovely bride of yours through a day like she had today again, now would you?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{you'll never get away with this. we have friends and family. they know where we went. they'll come looking for us. they'll find us!}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{that may very well be... but they won't find your car.}
<A>__{clyde dangles the keys his keys in front of mike. deacon, clyde and ida leave. the door bolts, locks. mike limps over to sheryl, he sees her bandaged hand.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{oh baby, what did they do to you? i'm sorry. i'm so sorry.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<P>__{(without moving, barely audible)}
<D>__{are they gone?}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{yeah. you're awake?}
<A>__{their entire conversation is no louder than a whisper. sheryl turns to face mike... they kiss.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{i didn't swallow that shit she gave me.}
<A>__{sheryl spies the back of his jersey in a mirror's reflection.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{oh my god. mike...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{it's okay. i'm okay.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{you're not okay. we're not okay. what are we gonna do?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{sheryl takes a moment. thinks carefully about how exactly to phrase this... then...}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{maybe... we should just give them what they want?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{if it stops them from hurting you and me... maybe we should...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{absolutely not. no fucking way. forget the fact, that the moment you get pregnant, they'll kill me. then the moment you give birth, you're dead. beyond both of those reasons... ain't no fucking way i am going to give them our child.}
<A>__{tears pour from sheryl.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{for all my coward marriage moments... i've thought about our child. is that stupid? i picture what he'll be like...}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{he?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{wishful thinking. i picture your heart... your eyes... and i picture us, raising him. growing old with him.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{no. ain't no fucking way i'm going to give him to them. they keep talking about sins... that would be the worst sin of them all.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i will get us out of this, sheryl. i promise you.}
