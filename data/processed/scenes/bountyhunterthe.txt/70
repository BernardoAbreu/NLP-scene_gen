<L>__{int cadillac afternoon}
<A>__{now milo really is the happiest man alive. he pulls out his cell phone, dials: split screen: teresa removes her gum, sticks it on her mouse pad, answers:}

<D>__{sid's bail bonds.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{guess who's in my trunk?}

<D>__{you're disgusting. let me out of the trunk.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{hmm. nope. by the way, your boyfriend stewart's been following me. unfortunately, i had to ditch him at the track.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{why is stewart..? (realizing) and wait: who said he's my boyfriend?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{aw, don't be embarrassed. these things happen. you were drunk when you guys hooked up, right?}
<A>__{cass turns bright red. she was drunk when they hooked up. changing tactics, she tries to flatter him:}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{you know what, milo? i shouldn't have run from you like that. i was...i don't know. you caught me off guard. the truth is, i'm kind of in some trouble and i could really use your help.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{bad news for you, then. i wouldn't help you if you were the very last baby sea turtle in the world, dragging its tiny weak body across the burning hot sand while sea gulls circled overhead. i'd just pull up a chair, sip a pina colada, and let nature take its course.}
<A>__{long beat. suddenly, cass starts to sob. loud, hysterical sobs. milo listens for a moment, out of a purely clinical interest, then:}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{hey, i used to be a sucker, but no more. you can cry til the cows come home, for all i care.}
<A>__{cass instantly stops crying and slams her phone shut.}
