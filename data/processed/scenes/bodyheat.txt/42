<L>__{exterior intersection}
<A>__{a block away from the station, the patrol car races toward an intersection. suddenly, a woman steps into the street, pushing a baby buggy. pat slams on the brakes, and the car skids sideways toward the intersection, where it rocks onto two wheels and stops just a few yards short of the buggy. sam sticks his head out the window.}

<D>__{are you crazy, lady? didn't you hear the siren?}
<A>__{the woman dives to the ground as the baby sits up in the buggy he is a midget with a cigar in his mouth and a tommy gun in his hands. pat jerks sam to the floor just as the midget opens fire. the midget riddles the car with bullets. headlights explode, windows are smashed, the grill is torn to shreds, and steam mushrooms into the air.}

<A>__{all four tires are flattened, a bumper is sheared off, and still the blasting goes on. there's almost nothing left of the patrol car as a dark sedan wheels into the intersection to pick up the woman and the midget. the sedan speeds away, and pat and sam climb out of the rubble, unhurt but very shaken.}
