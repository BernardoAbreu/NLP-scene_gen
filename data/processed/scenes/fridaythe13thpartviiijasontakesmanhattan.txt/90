<L>__{exterior deck night}
<A>__{rennie appears again, scanning her no visibility surroundings.}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{toby? where'd you go?}
<A>__{no sign of her dog. she remembers her mission, heading to the anchors again.}
<L>__{exterior bow continuous}
<A>__{as rennie arrives on the bow, climbing into the left hoist box behind the huge anchor cable.}
<B>__{stalking point of view}
<A>__{moving up to the bow door like jason did before, cracking it open, seeing rennie from behind. and moving towards her.}
<B>__{rennie}
<A>__{is oblivious as she reads the directions above the controls. insert hoist lever (second unit) as rennie's hand grabs it, shoving it forward. insert green hoist button (second unit) a moment later, her thumb finds it and depresses it. insert anchor chain (second unit) as the massive black chain links thunder to life.}
<B>__{stalking point of view}
<A>__{he's now within ten feet of the unaware girl.}
<B>__{rennie}
<A>__{remains in the hoist box, making certain it is operating correctly. a second later, we see the fleeting outline of a human shape appear behind her.}
<B>__{stalking point of view}
<A>__{three feet from rennie. she spins around to climb out of the hoist box and gasps.}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{she's facing mcculloch. he immediately reaches past her, yanking the lever back to its center position, and: the anchor chain (second unit) grinds to a halt.}
<B>__{return to shot}
<A>__{as mcculloch faces her, angrily grabbing rennie's arms, shouting over the storm.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{you had me worried to death!}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{but sean said...}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{i'm the one you should be listening to! do you think dropping an anchor in the middle of a storm makes any sense whatsoever?}
<A>__{she tries to find some defense, but mcculloch leads her off before any wards come forth. close up exercise mat as a pair of skeet rifles, three fire axes, a flare gun and several pool cues are dumped onto the foam padded plastic.}
