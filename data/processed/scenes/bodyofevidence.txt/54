<C>__{judge burnham}
<D>__{mr. dulaney, before you cast aspersions on the district attorney's office by suggesting they've coaxed this witness to say things that aren't true you better have more than a hunch. do you?}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{no, your honor.}
<C>__{judge burnham}
<D>__{maybe you don't know what it's like where mrs. crawford comes from but i do. i came from a neighborhood just like hers. this is a whole other world for her. she's a poor working woman who has been thrust into a room full of highly educated and mostly unsympathetic people. so, she puts on her best dress, fixes her hair and tries to present herself as intelligently as possible.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{being poor and having pride is not a crime, mr. dulaney and before you attempt to impeach another witness' testimony in my courtroom your foundations better be based on something other than semantics.}
