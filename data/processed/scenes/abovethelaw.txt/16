<C>__{nico}
<D>__{i'm happy, branca. i like what i do.}
<A>__{branca glances seriously to the other uncles, then, with a smile, pats nico's cheek.}
<C>__{branca}
<D>__{look at this face! six foot four, pretty as the statue of david. and he's a cop!}
<A>__{branca laughs. from a distance, watanabe watches, missing nothing. across the porch, lukich and several other cops observe and try to listen.}

<D>__{uncle gio, that kind of help i don't need. i'd rather get shot by someone i don't know.}
<A>__{jackson and lukich crack up. the others follow. for the moment, the tension is dispelled.}
