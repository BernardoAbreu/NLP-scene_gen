<L>__{exterior park bench day}
<A>__{juno and leah are sitting at a bench in a park. they slurp giant blue slushies and sift through a pile of penny savers. juno has her pipe with her.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{the penny saver sucks.}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{yeah, but it sucks for free.}
<A>__{they turn the pages in silence for a moment. their lips and teeth are windex blue.}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{look at this one "wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other."}
<P>__{(checks to see that}
<D>__{juno is paying}
<P>__{attention)}
<D>__{"all that's missing is your bastard."}
<C>__{juno}
<P>__{(reading a different page)}
<D>__{there's a guy in here who's giving away a piano. free for the hauling! we should put it in bleeker's yard.}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{you're not listening to me.}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{no, i heard you. i just can't give the baby to people who describe themselves as "wholesome." i'm looking for something a little edgier.}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{what did you have in mind, a family of disturbed loners who are into gunplay and incest?}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{i was thinking a graphic designer, mid thirties, and his cool asian wife who dresses awesome and plays bass. but i'm trying to not be too particular.}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{all right, how about this one? "healthy, educated couple seeking infant to join our family of five. you will be compensated. help us complete the circle of love."}
<C>__{juno}
<D>__{yeesh, they sound like a cult. besides, they're greedy bitches. they already have three kids!}
<C>__{leah}
<D>__{hey, juno. juno! look at this one.}
<A>__{she points to the paper and motions for juno to look. juno scans the ad silently. we see the ad. it contains a photo of an attractive couple with ambiguous mona lisa smiles. it reads "educated, successful couple wishes to..."}
<C>__{juno }
<D>__{they were mark and vanessa loring, and they were beautiful even in black and white.}
