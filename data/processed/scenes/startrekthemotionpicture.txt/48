<A>__{kirk entering as rand and her assistant electronically list the last of the five arrivals who are leaving the transporter chamber. kirk calls through intercom to the last arrival, a young female yeoman.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{yeoman, what was the problem down there?}
<C>__{yeoman}
<P>__{(through intercom)}
<D>__{he insisted we go first, sir. said something about first seeing how it scrambled our molecules.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{thank you, yeoman}
<P>__{(hits transmit control)}
<D>__{starfleet , this is captain kirk. the officer is to be beamed up immediately!}
<A>__{angle on the chamber (o) a moment, then again the generating humming, and then the familiar beaming effect. and then you see mccoy! he fully materializes. he looks himself over as if in pleased surprise he is still in one piece. camera pans mccoy from the transporter chamber to kirk who is hav ing a hard time containing his amusement and delight.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{well, for a man who swore he'd never return to starfleet... mccoy}
<P>__{(flat, tight)}
<D>__{what happened, captain, sir, was that your revered admiral nogura invoked a little known and seldom used reserve activation clause...}
<P>__{(snaps)}
<D>__{... in simpler language, captain, sir, they drafted me!}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(straight faced)}
<D>__{they didn't...!}
<A>__{kirk has offered his hand, but mccoy is already flaring:}
<D>__{mccoy this was your idea! it was your idea, wasn't it!}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{bones, there's a 'thing' out there mccoy why is any object we don't understand called a 'thing'?}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(continues)}
<D>__{ headed this way. i need you... mccoy were you behind this?}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{bones, i need you badly.}
<A>__{kirk extends his hand again; mccoy delays some moments then finally responds. and once done, it is the long hand clasp of two old friends reunited despite their differences. now mccoy turns to rand.}
<D>__{mccoy permission to come aboard, sir?}
<C>__{rand}
<P>__{(elated)}
<D>__{permission granted, sir!}
<A>__{and mccoy moves toward the door, grumbling:}
<D>__{mccoy i hear chapel's an md now; i need a top nurse, not a doctor who'll argue every diagnosis... and }
<A>__{even when he's in the corridor his grumbling trails after him.}
<D>__{mccoy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{... they've probably redesigned sickbay, too. engineers love to change things.}
<B>__{full on kirk}
<A>__{as he gazes fondly after the grumbling mccoy, and now turns to the intercom, flips it on:}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{all decks, this is the captain. prepare or immediate departure.}
