<A>__{we follow the electrical overcharge as it crackles along the wires and cables inside the walls and floors. it is making its way up to the lab!}
<L>__{interior lab day}
<A>__{all the kids are now trying to hold onto their vibrating equipment. the charge crackles up a wire and erupts at liz's table. a breaker explodes in flames. there is an outburst of ad libs: "fire!" "everybody out!" thorkel (comes running he is shabby and bewildered) seeing liz trapped behind the fire which is growing from second to second.}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{keep calm, everybody keep calm. use the front door. everybody out the front.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{liz! come on...!}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{i can't. help me!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i'm coming!}
<A>__{he wades into the fire, but is beaten back by the flames. his sleeve is on fire. he pats it out.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{peter!}
<A>__{flash appears and tries to help but thorkel stops him.}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{get back, you idiots. you can't go in there!}
<A>__{liz smashes at the window, but this is an inner city school and the windows are covered by steel gates. liz wraps her fingers in the gate.}
<C>__{liz}
<P>__{(out at the street)}
<D>__{help! help me!}
<A>__{outside the window the air is clear and people come and go. some are stopping to look up at the girl on the second floor who screams (but they can't hear, of course) down at them as the flames close in behind her. peter comes flying in with a fire extinguisher. he fumbles with it. flash pushes thorkel, grabs the extinguisher away from him with a scowl of disdain. liz turns to face the flames. suddenly there is an eruption of co2 clouds and the roar of a fire}
