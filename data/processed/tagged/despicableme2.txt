<B>__{the entire lab starts to get pulled up out of the ground.}
<A>__{clank! the lab makes contact with the ship. it flies up and down, shaking the scientists and guards off. they fall to the ground. the magnet ship flies away with their lab, vehicles, and weapons. the remaining guards and scientists are strewn across the snow with the remnants of the damaged base. we see a porta potty door open. a confused guard is sitting on the can reading a newspaper, having missed the entire incident. he closes the door.}

<D>__{how come you're tho fat?}
<A>__{gru grits his teeth, then forces a smile and speaks with a high pitched, dreamy voice.}
<C>__{gru}

<A>__{she pulls out a lipstick. fires it at gru. the tip flies through the air and connects with his chest, latching on. zzzzzappp! it tases him, which sends his body flailing in different funny poses before passing out.}
