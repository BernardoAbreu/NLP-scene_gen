<L>__{exterior field behind motel morning}
<A>__{some workers are in the process of rebuilding the windmill. a man with a hose sprays the side of the water tank in an attempt to wash off the burn marks resembling the nearly imperceptible image of the monster bunny's face... i e. jeremy's bmw motel morning jeremy pulls into the motel parking lot. sam hesitates for a moment before getting out.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{i heard about your friend...}
<A>__{sam doesn't say anything, so he goes on.}
<C>__{jeremy }
<D>__{i wasn't gonna say anything... but then i thought i probably should, because if i didn't, it might be inconsiderate.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{well... okay. thanks.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{so... what are you gonna do?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i don't know yet.}
<A>__{sam brushes her mussed hair out of her face, still not wanting to go inside the motel room.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{do you believe that everything happens for a reason?}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{i know that for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yeah... i learned that in science.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{and everything in the universe is in constant motion, as the universe is constantly expanding...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yeah, but do you believe that everything happens for a reason, like in life?}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{you mean like destiny?}
<A>__{jeremy thinks on this for a moment.}
<C>__{jeremy }
<D>__{i think everyone has a purpose. something they're meant to do. like potential, but more clear cut. for instance, i was destined to get my hands on the meteorite.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{really.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{i'm making amazing discoveries every day, practically sleeping at the lab...}
<A>__{while he talks and becomes more excited he scratches nervously at his left forearm. it draws sam's attention away from what he's saying.}
<C>__{jeremy }
<D>__{i'm still doing some tests, but there's a metallic substance that's not showing up on the elemental charts }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what happened to your arm?}
<A>__{jeremy stops scratching. a small area on the inner part of his wrist is raw and red, partially scabbed over.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{it's just a rash.}
<A>__{sam starts to get out of the car.}
<C>__{jeremy }
<D>__{sam, wait. here...}
<A>__{he offers her a wad of cash. sam hesitates.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{but }
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{i know you need it. it's no big deal.}
<A>__{she accepts the money.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{thank you.}
