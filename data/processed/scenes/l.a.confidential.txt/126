<L>__{interior jack's desk day}
<A>__{sitting in disgust, jack spots something amidst all the clutter the great jerk off books of 1962. he flips one over, looks at the fleur de lis stamp. jack remembers something matt reynolds told him. he dials the phone.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah. sergeant jack vincennes requesting. i need the home address on a pierce patchett.}
<C>__{operator }
<D>__{please hold, sergeant...}
<A>__{as jack waits, exley appears in front of him.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{i need to speak to you.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{give me a minute, will ya?}
<A>__{exley clicks off the phone.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{damnit... what ?}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{i want you to follow bud white.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{even i'm not that crazy.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{it's not a request. i need to know what white knows. follow him or i will have you pulled off 'badge of honor.' permanently.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yesterday that might've meant something. pull me off. you'd be doing me a big favor.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{yesterday yes, today no. what happened last night?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{transfer me, suspend me. just leave me alone.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{you make a mistake?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah. my whole life.}
<A>__{jack stands, heads out. exley follows; he needs help.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{listen, i think i made a mistake, too.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i ain't a priest, lieutenant. i can't hear your confession.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{do you make the three negroes for the nite owl killings?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{it's a simple question.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you should be the last person who wants to dig any deeper into the nite owl, lieutenant .}
<A>__{exley watches as jack continues down a hall. then:}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{rollo tomasi.}
<A>__{jack stops, looks back at him.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{is there more to that, or do i have to guess?}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{rollo was a purse snatcher. my father ran into him off duty. he shot my father six times and got away clean. no one even knew who he was. i made the name up to give him some personality.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{so what's the point?}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{rollo's the reason i became a cop. i wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it. it was supposed to be about truth and justice and rollo. but somewhere along the way i forgot all that... how about you, jack? why'd you become a cop?}
<A>__{jack looks like he might cry, but smiles instead.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i don't remember...}
<A>__{both men are quiet a moment.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm trying to figure what angle you're playing this time, but i sure as hell can't see one.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{i've given up angles for awhile. i just want to solve this thing.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{the nite owl was solved, lieutenant.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{i want to do it right.}
<A>__{so does jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{okay, college boy, i will help you. but i want half the collar.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{a third. i don't think we can make a case without bud white.}
