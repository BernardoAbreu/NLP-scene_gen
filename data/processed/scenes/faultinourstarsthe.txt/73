<A>__{hazel sits in the middle with frannie on the aisle and gus at the window. he looks around, antsy.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{have you never been on a plane before?}
<A>__{gus shakes his head, he has not. and he's nervous. he pulls a cigarette out of his pocket and puts it in his mouth. within seconds a flight attendant rushes over.}
<C>__{flight attendant}
<D>__{sir, you can't smoke on this plane. or... any plane.}
<C>__{gus}
<P>__{(cigarette in his mouth)}
<D>__{i don't smoke.}
<A>__{the flight attendant shoots him a look.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{it's a metaphor. he puts the killing thing in his mouth but doesn't give it the power to kill him.}
<C>__{flight attendant}
<P>__{(no nonsense)}
<D>__{that metaphor is prohibited on today's flight.}
<A>__{gus nods and puts the cigarette away.}
<C>__{pa system}
<D>__{"flight attendants, prepare for departure."}
<A>__{the engines roar to life and the plane accelerates towards take off. gus is getting more worried by the second. he grabs the arm rest, his eyes wide.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{ok?}
<A>__{gus doesn't say it back. hazel laughs.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{this is what it feels like to ride in a car with you.}
<A>__{gus grabs hazel's hand as the plane lifts off. he looks out the window they're flying! and then back to hazel.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{we're flying! look!}
<A>__{hazel smiles at his enthusiasm.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{holy look at that?! nothing has ever looked like that ever in all of human history!}
<A>__{he's adorable at this moment. hazel can't resist leaning over to give him a kiss on the cheek.}
<C>__{frannie}
<P>__{(not looking up from her magazine)}
<D>__{just so you know, i'm right here. sitting next to you. your mother.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{we're just friends, mom.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{she is. i'm not.}
<A>__{hazel shoots him a look. gus shrugs "what, it's the truth." hazel just shakes her head. cut to: later. mid flight, the plane is dark, frannie's asleep. hazel and gus watch the same gory action movie. actually, he watches the movie. she just watches him watch it. he watches it with gusto. hazel continues to watch him. try as she might, she's falling in love. cut to: sfx: the plane touching down. cut to:}
