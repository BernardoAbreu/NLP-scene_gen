<A>__{carol sleeps on her stomach, her head resting across one arm. doc lies beside her, eyes open. he looks over at carol a moment, noting the long strands of hair that move rhythmically back and forth from her gentle breathing. after a moment doc quietly stands, moves to the writing table and stares at the black suitcase. he opens the valise and lifts the large stack of greenbacks into a shaft of light coming through a crack in the drawn shade. still holding the money, doc looks back at carol. one last tightly bound money pad night printed clearly on the brown wrapper.}
