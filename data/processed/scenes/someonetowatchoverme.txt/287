<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior the house same}
<A>__{the lawn virtually filled with police vehicles, their revolving red lights illuminating the grim scene; a small gathering of onlookers gawking from behind police ropes, ambulances pulling slowly, silently, away. camera pans to two figures alone, beside a squad car, in the distant shadows. it's claire, still clad in the police overcoat, and mike. they are together, but separate, maintaining the proper distance to say goodbye. closer angle on them: not knowing quite what to say.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{so.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{so.}
<A>__{angle on both: their eyes locked into each other's.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{you still going away?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i don't know...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{you don't have to, now.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i think it's probably still a good idea.}
<A>__{close on mike: getting her message.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{yeah...}
<A>__{both are hurting.}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(heartfelt)}
<D>__{i will miss you, mike.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{listen, i will... see you again.}
<A>__{her eyes are glistening; she gives him a bracing smile. but he can't quiet manage it.}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(barely able to speak)}
<D>__{say goodbye.}
<A>__{he struggles with it; unable.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i like your coat.}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(half laugh, half cry)}
<D>__{you have a weakness for lady cops.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i do.}
<A>__{silence now; their eyes adoring.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{say goodbye, mike.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(thick voiced)}
<D>__{you take care.}
<A>__{mike turns camera moving with him as he walks slowly away finding himself on a collision course with garber. they meet, spending a long moment in non communicative greeting.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{any chance? there's nothin' else i'm any good at, but this.}
<C>__{garber}
<P>__{(noncommittal)}
<D>__{call me next week. we'll talk about it.}
<A>__{mike absorbs it, looking up to see ellie and tommy, beside a squad car, a distance away. girding himself, he heads}
<B>__{toward.}
<A>__{angle on ellie and tommy as he approaches, and stands beside them. not much to say. finally he reaches out and tousles tommy's hair.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{good police work, kiddo.}
<A>__{he catches ellie's eye, both assessing each other.}
<C>__{ellie}
<P>__{(re: tommy)}
<D>__{he doesn't want to sleep here.}
<P>__{(a long beat)}
<D>__{neither do i. it's not my house anymore.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{me neither.}
<A>__{angle on all: finding each other's eyes.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{let's find some place to start over.}
<A>__{mike puts an arm around tommy and the camera begins a long pullback, as ellie moves to his side, and the keegan family begins to move away. we see claire, being helped into a squad car, turning to look back at them as it pulls away cars revving up and pulling out, in all}
<B>__{directions.}
<A>__{from a distance, we hear mike's voice.}
<C>__{mike }
<P>__{(to ellie)}
<D>__{what this crap about singing lessons?}
