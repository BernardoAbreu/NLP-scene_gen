<L>__{interior living room two hours later}
<A>__{caroline and roy are kissing on the sofa, and he is all over her: his hands are on her breasts, her thighs, everywhere. aroused in spite of herself, caroline pulls away, indicating the light in the other room.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{don't. toby's still up.}
<A>__{roy leans back, smiling, and eyes caroline.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{you are one sweet thing, baby: just the sight of you makes my dick hard.}
<A>__{he pulls her to him, starting to kiss her. she fends him off, looking worriedly toward the room where toby's light burns.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{aw, he won't hear anything.}
<A>__{again he pulls her toward him; again she turns her head from the kiss. then it happens. a spasm of anger passes across his face and he shoves caroline away from him. it's a hard shove, but nothing that could really hurt her. violence has happened before between these two, and they recognize it. caroline is immediately on guard, and roy is apologetic.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{shit, baby, i'm sorry. i didn't mean that. i'm just so glad to see you.}
<A>__{he slides toward caroline, kisses her. this time she accepts the kiss feels she has no choice.}
