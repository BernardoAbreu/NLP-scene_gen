<L>__{interior clubroom continuous}
<A>__{"baby's" standing wide eyed next to the jukebox, staring at bones, his razor pressed against her quivering lips.}
<L>__{interior black cat pool club continuous}
<A>__{mack's wondering where she is.}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{c'mon, baby!}
<A>__{he walks doing a little funky rufus thomas shuffle to the music. he steps into the club room. it's dark, lit only by the jukebox. but it's empty.}
<C>__{mack }
<D>__{bitch. nobody walks out on eddie mack.}
<A>__{then he sees something. her legs on the floor, sticking out behind the jukebox. he walks towards her, slowly... then sees the deepening pool of blood pouring across the floor right towards him. whatever happened to her, she's beyond his help now.}
<C>__{mack }
<D>__{muthafucka!}
<A>__{he whips around but can't see anyone. he strides defiantly back into the pool room.}
<C>__{mack }
<D>__{c'mon. i take you all on.}
<A>__{mack picks up the two gold plated revolvers off the mirror with coke on it. suddenly all the coke moves on its own. the many grams piled there, all merge into one pile.}
<C>__{mack }
<D>__{what the...?}
<A>__{he bends down to check it out. and the coke actually flies straight up off the mirror with the force of a punch and shoots like a fire hose straight up his nose. he reels back, choking. coughing. after having probably an ounce fly straight up his snot locker. blood pouring out his nose. wobbly now. he hears a low echoing laughter through the club, and the sound of the cue ball breaking and sending pool balls spinning 'round the table.}
<C>__{mack }
<D>__{who's there?}
<A>__{bones stands by the pool table, under the overhanging light. he pulls out his razor and with one savage slice, splinters the pool cue in two.}
<C>__{mack }
<D>__{bones? jimmy bones? that you? you're dead. i killed you and i stuck your dead ass in a hole in the ground wrapped in nothing but your bitch's bloody rags. now i will count the holes in your muthafuckin' chest. and i will add a few more.}
<A>__{he fires both guns at bones, while backing away. bones don't feel a thing. he just picks up the mirror and holds it up facing mack.}
<C>__{bones}
<D>__{this it? your big ass tidal wave.}
<A>__{mack sees his own terrified face staring back from the mirror, belling hanging over his briefs, coke and blood clotted on his face.}
<C>__{bones }
<D>__{look like the wave's long gone and nothing but oil scum, dead fish, and yo' ugly ass left on the beach.}
<A>__{mack shoots wildly at bones. at the mirror blasting it into shards. but bones stands unscathed. and the shards of broken mirror do not fall to the ground. they remain in the air, forming a living room swarm of razor sharp glass. mack turns and runs, waaaaay too fucking late, as the swarm of glass shards fly like angry wasps right at him eddie's thrown forward by the sheer force of them, and is skewered throughout his body by all the glass fragments. pinned face mashed against the wall.}
<C>__{bones }
<P>__{(mack's voice)}
<D>__{"i'm taking a five dollar kick in the head that's a quick ticket to heaven."}
<A>__{mack pinned to the wall. bleeding from everywhere. snot blood coke mess drips out his nose. bones pulls mack's head back by his hair and slides his razor into the half inch between his adam's apple and the wall. as the juke box changes song, we hear a liquid slice and a scream slip into a gurgle. bones' long hands drip blood as he ties something to his belt. we don't quite see what it is, not until we catch the sight of eddie mack's headless remains pinned to the wall.}
