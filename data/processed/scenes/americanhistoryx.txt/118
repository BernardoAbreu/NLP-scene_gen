<L>__{exterior corner – seth’s truck}
<A>__{seth and cam eagerly await danny’s arrival. young danny skates up and hands cammeron the coke through the passenger window.}
<C>__{cammeron}
<D>__{i’ll get you the money soon.}
<A>__{before danny can answer, seth quickly takes off in the other direction.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior bedroom – danny’s pov – present}
<A>__{cammeron, coke hanging out of his nose, looks at dan.}
<C>__{cammeron}
<D>__{want a little pick me up or what?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{no thanks.}
<A>__{cam wipes his moustache and the table. in the glass he sees derek’s reflection. sure enough, derek stands in the doorway – a ghost of three years’ past.}
<C>__{cammeron}
<D>__{well—}
<P>__{(smiling to derek)}
<D>__{i can tell by the look on his face that he wants one.}
<A>__{danny turns. derek doesn’t lift his eyes from cammeron.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{you need to get your eyes examined.}
<C>__{cammeron}
<D>__{i need to get my fucking nose examined.}
<A>__{cam laughs and puts his cowboy hat back on.}
<C>__{derek}
<P>__{(calmly to danny)}
<D>__{there’s a cute little redhead out there looking for you, dan. why don’t you go talk to her?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i’d like to kick it for a second.}
<C>__{cammeron}
<D>__{naw…get the fuck... outta here, dan.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{please. get out of here, please.}
<A>__{danny looks at cam, stands up, and walks out of the room. derek seizes his brother with his eyes as danny exits.}
<C>__{cammeron}
<D>__{fuckin’ pigs are hasslin’ me any chance they get, man. gotta be extra careful.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{what’d you expect? they have a job to do.}
<C>__{cammeron}
<D>__{fuck cops. they don’t understand a goddamn thing.}
<P>__{(hiding the coke)}
<D>__{last chance before i put it away.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{give it a rest.}
<C>__{cammeron}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{okay. alright. just don’t preach any self righteous prison shit to me and i won’t ask.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{don’t worry about that.}
<C>__{cammeron}
<D>__{have a seat.}
<A>__{derek sits. the sketchy cammeron smiles, licks his lips, and sits back down. he jitters his jaw as derek stares him down.}
<C>__{cammeron}
<D>__{i haven’t had a chance to thank you, derek. since you haven’t fuckin’ stopped by here.}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{you kept your mouth shut and did your time and i... i respect that, man.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{did i have a choice?}
<A>__{cammeron laughs.}
<C>__{cammeron}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(smiling at him)}
<D>__{so what are you gonna do? what are your plans?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{i’m gonna get a job.}
<C>__{cammeron}
<D>__{professional basketball?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{uhhh... i don’t think so.}
<C>__{cammeron}
<D>__{courier boy?}
<A>__{derek coldly shakes his head sideways in amazement. cammeron sniffs a little from his fingernail and takes a sip of beer.}
<C>__{cammeron}
<D>__{do the shit in the pen at all?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{nope. not once.}
<C>__{cammeron}
<D>__{we thought you might be making a killing in there.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{who’s we?}
<C>__{cammeron}
<D>__{me and the fat kid.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{nope. kept my nose clean.}
<C>__{cammeron}
<D>__{no pun intended.}
<A>__{derek nods slightly, pulls out a pack of marlboro’s and lights up. derek stares down at the laughing cokehead. tight on cammeron. the sketchy dealer looks behind the couch to break the stare.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{why would you think that i could make a killing in there, cammeron? i only did it when my mom was short on cash.}
<A>__{deep inside cam knows. behind the couch is a pistol and a bong. nervous and hesitant, he grabs the bong.}
<C>__{cammeron}
<D>__{well... she sure was short a lot.}
