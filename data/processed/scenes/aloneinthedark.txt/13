<D>__{so, maybe you're thinking i'm an asshole, trying to scare this poor kid for no reason. but that's where you're wrong. because i've got my reasons. there's a world around you that you've trained yourself not to see. you've willfully closed your eyes. but your fear of the dark is not a weakness. it's there to protect you from things you'd better pray you never see. my eyes were forced open a long time ago. now i know. just because you can't see something, doesn't mean it can't kill you.}
<A>__{carnby steps into the first taxi waiting in the row. the taxi shifts into gear and drives off. another taxi is parked up ahead. as carnby's taxi passes it, the second taxi pulls out and follows it.}
