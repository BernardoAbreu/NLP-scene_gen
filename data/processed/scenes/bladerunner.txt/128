<D>__{i told myself over and over again, if i hadn't done it, they would have. i didn't go back to the city, not that city, i didn't want the job. she said the great advantage of being alive was to have a choice. and she chose. and a part of me was almost glad. not because she was gone but because this way they could never touch her. as for tyrell he was murdered, but he wasn't dead. for a long time i wanted to kill him. but what was the point? there were too many tyrells. but only one rachael. maybe real and unreal could never be separated. the secret never found. but i got as close with her as i'd ever come to it. she'd stay with me a long time. i guess we made each other real.}
