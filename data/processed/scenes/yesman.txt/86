<L>__{interior korean restaurant later}
<A>__{carl's eating across from renee. he can't stand the food. he grimaces with every bite, but manages to choke it down.}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{do you want any more squid hot pot? it's really good here.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i think i'm good. to have some more.}
<A>__{renee spoons a huge amount of squid onto both their plates.}
<C>__{carl }
<D>__{so, all this art you create. what do you want to do with it?}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{like, do you want to open a store?}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{where i can sell my photos and pottery? of course not. they're terrible.}
<A>__{carl's surprised that she knows this.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{they're not terrible.}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{yeah, they're awful.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i think you're being hard on yourself }
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{i'm not asking for sympathy. my voice is way too high pitched, my pottery looks like poo, and my photos are blurry and subjectless. but who gives a shit? not everything needs a goal. the world is a playground. you know that as a kid but then somewhere along the way everyone forgets.}
<C>__{renee }
<P>__{(as if telling a secret)}
<D>__{besides, i can't open a store. my big master plan is to take a trip around the world.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{when? like in a couple years?}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{i bought a ticket for four months from now.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{people always talk about that, but you're actually doing it.}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{honestly, i'm terrified.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{how about you? do you like the bank?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{it's lame, but you know, it's pretty funny. my boss norman always throws theme parties.}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{so if it's lame why do you work there?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{because... it's actually not lame.}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{i just gave the answer i've automatically given for years. i'm actually enjoying the bank for the first time maybe ever. i started this pilot program that gives out microloans.}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{like say you need three hundred bucks to pay for paint so you can start a house painting business. rather than paying a loan shark who charges you 300%, now you can come to southwest bank. whatever. it's kind of dorky.}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{that actually sounds really cool.}
<A>__{the waitress comes over.}
<C>__{renee }
<D>__{i'm stuffed. but i would love to wrap this up.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(in korean, with subtitles)}
<D>__{[we are very fat. but can i please have this food made mobile?]}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{so, what do you say we hit this crazy party?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{funny, not crazy. my boss is white noise.}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{white noise?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{you know, like totally boring.}
<C>__{renee}
<D>__{i don't know anyone who's totally boring. crack a person's shell there's always something creepy underneath.}
