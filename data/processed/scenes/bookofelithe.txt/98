<A>__{the sun rises through the fog on the horizon. the great iron gates grind open. solara emerges from inside the prison, steps out onto the island rock. she is dressed in a flak jacket, combat pants and boots. eli's old pack across her back. hair tied in a neat pony tail. atop that, eli's ragged fur hat.}

<D>__{thank you for the friend i made.}
<A>__{in her hand she clutches a copy of the newly printed bible. eli's sword slung over her shoulder.}

<D>__{please watch over her as you watched over me.}

<C>__{eli }
<D>__{thank you for allowing me finally to rest. i'm so very tired. the time of my departure is at hand and now i surrender my soul into your care, at peace in knowing that i have carried out your will. that i have done right with my time on this earth.}
