<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior lake sunrise}
<A>__{the steam is lifting off the lake.}
<L>__{exterior lake morning}
<A>__{keough, kelly, hector, and deputy burke are cruising in the whaler. hector and jack are both in full diving gear. jack also has a stick gun for protection. hector does not.}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{again, i don't mean to be annoying with my questions. but if it is a crocodile which i don't think it is. and if they do charge these baby hatchling sounds...}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?}
<P>__{(to hector)}
<D>__{with you it makes sense.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{they don't really attack underwater and }
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{that "walt" guy got hit underwater }
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{no crocodile has ever }
<C>__{kelly}
<P>__{(to hector)}
<D>__{you should take a flax pole.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{and what if i tranq him kelly? he drowns. you think about that?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i'm just saying last resort.}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{again. not to be disruptive. do we have a problem with it dying?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{crocodiles don't sever with their teeth, their molars are blunt.}
<A>__{as if that's suppose to clear it up. keough stares back blankly. then:}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{is this a trick?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{what i'm saying is if it's a crocodile that cut a man in half he would have to be over twenty feet which would make him well over a hundred years old, it would be unthinkable to destroy him.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to burke)}
<D>__{alright, let's just drop here.}
<A>__{burke lowers the anchor, as keough just continues to stare at hector. kelly readies the hatchling recorder. she lowers it into the water.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{they respond pretty quick. i will wait till you get down before i turn it on.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{good.}
<P>__{(climbing over)}
<D>__{see ya soon.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{good luck.}
<A>__{there was a twinge of real concern in her voice. he makes eye contact with her. then drops over. goes under.}
<C>__{hector}
<P>__{(to kelly)}
<D>__{two years married, divorced, used to be a lawyer, quit, i'm still waiting on his sperm count.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{what?}
<P>__{(off hector's look)}
<D>__{oh as if i'm interested.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{as if.}
<P>__{(as he's about to go overboard; to keough)}
<D>__{will you miss me?}
<C>__{keough}
<P>__{(to hector)}
<D>__{i brought a pork chop, maybe we could hang it around your neck for luck.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{no thank you, but maybe later you can chew the bark off my big fat log.}
<A>__{and hector drops overboard.}
<C>__{keough}
<P>__{(to kelly)}
<D>__{was that like a homo sexual remark?}
<C>__{kelly}
<P>__{(strict)}
<D>__{i asked you to be nice to him.}
<A>__{keough rolls his eyes.}
