<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior the bijou sign night}
<A>__{pete sits leaning up against the base of the dark sign. a gentle breeze tousles his hair as he gazes up at the stars. after a moment, he hears footsteps coming up the ladder to the roof.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{who's that?}
<C>__{adele's voice}
<D>__{it's me.}
<A>__{adele climbs onto the roof, comes over and sits down next to pete.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{hi.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{i'm sure a lot of people down in l.a. are worried sick about you.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{yeah? i'm sure a lot more people down in l.a. want a piece of me.}
<A>__{he turns to her.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{this luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he?}
<C>__{adele}
<P>__{(wistful smile)}
<D>__{oh, yes. yes, he was.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{well... let me tell you, i'm not luke. i know who i am now, and you don't. and... i don't like me very much.}
<C>__{adele}
<P>__{(changing the subject)}
<D>__{you know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you pete.}
<P>__{(she takes it for a spin)}
<D>__{pete. pete. it's a nice name.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{thanks, i like it. i think.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{delly, i want to do the right thing.}
<A>__{pete can't believe he just said that but he did.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{i believe you.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{the truth is, i'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{but if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{come on, delly, look at the country today. we're fighting communists in korea, we're paranoid about the russians, we've got this thing with the rosenbergs and the atomic bomb...}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{you think they want "suspected communists" entertaining the american public with party propaganda like, gosh i don't know, "sand pirates of the sahara?"}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{forget about all that. you want to do the right thing? then defend your name. if someone says something about you that's untrue, you have to stand up and say so. i know the law, and the law's on your side.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{what about you, delly?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{i am, too.}
<A>__{pete smiles and puts his arms around her.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{you'll stand by me?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{whatever happens.}
<A>__{they kiss, and we}
