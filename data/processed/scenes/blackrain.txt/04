<L>__{interior brownstone apartment}
<A>__{... a miniature las vegas, complete with music, drinks, tuxedoed dealers and croupiers: roulette, craps, black jack. wall to wall people. the fact that casino gambling happens to be illegal in new york doesn't stop these connecticut slummers, hollow cheek nightlifers, and junior wiseguys from having a good time.}
<B>__{at the card table}
<A>__{nick conklin, holding a dollar cigar, is trying to pull a winning hand. in his late thirties, nick has the sort of quiet good looks that takes an extra glance to appreciate. his moe ginsburg rent a tux is too tight, his ruffled shirt, out of date; nick could care less. two other players are still in the game. one of them is a lithe debutante surrounded by an entourage of giggling friends and tuxedoed men. the pot is huge. nick flips two one hundred dollar chips onto the pot.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{one, and one on top.}
<C>__{dealer}
<D>__{house sees.}
<C>__{player one}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{i'm out.}
<A>__{disgusted, he throws down his cards. it's down to nick and the debutante. the cocky deb gives nick a long look, confident she can win.}
<C>__{debutante}
<P>__{(her eyes still on nick)}
<D>__{i see the deuce, and one to chase them home.}
<A>__{she throws her chips on the pot. nick hesitates, then decides to match it.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{call.}
<C>__{debutante}
<P>__{(showing her hand)}
<D>__{ladies, aces wired. sorry sport.}
<A>__{nick turns over his cards, jacks and tens, not good enough to win. elated, the deb gets up from the table and joins her giggling friends. nick walks over to her.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{very nice, barbie.}
<P>__{(pointing toward her boyfriend)}
<D>__{now, i'd take ken over there and go home.}
<C>__{debutante}
<D>__{why's that?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{it's time. that's all.}
<C>__{boyfriend}
<D>__{the lady wants to play. someone should teach you to be a better loser, loser.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{listen, ken }
<C>__{boyfriend}
<D>__{my name is not ken }
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{ i'm offering you the benefit of my experience.}
<C>__{debutante}
<D>__{looks like you have a lot of experience in places like this. it was nice of them to relax the dress code for you.}
<A>__{that draws a laugh from her friends. the entourage heads for the bar. charlie skloaris, twenty three, steps in front of the debutante, blocking her path. she steps to the side. charlie steps with her. charlie's pushing it, he's always pushing it. she's not amused. finally, charlie lets her pass. he comes up to nick.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{typical new york woman, big attitude, small apartment, no tits.}
<A>__{only two things count to charlie: his job and his women, but not necessarily in that order.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i think she got to you, pappy.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(checking his watch)}
<D>__{you want a popsicle, go to good humor. and don't call me 'pappy.'}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(glancing at the door)}
<D>__{still, you gotta wonder how she'd look in handcuffs.}
<A>__{nick, wary, eyes this kid. charlie shrugs, spreads his arms defensively. the sound of pounding on the front door.}
<B>__{the door}
<A>__{splinters. the bouncer steps back as four helmeted emergency service officers the first members of the raiding party rush in. pandemonium. people rush for the exit any exit.}
<B>__{at the bar}
<A>__{nick and charlie hold up their glasses.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{alley oop.}
<A>__{they down their drinks, then set them down. charlie pulls out the binaca, offering nick a spritz, but nick is already pulling out his police badge and hanging it around his neck. charlie quickly follows suit.}
<B>__{a half dozen cops}
<A>__{line the patrons up against the wall. the asst. d.a., patty zachara, climbs onto the crap table. a petite, nervous woman, patty has dressed in a channel suit for the occasion.}

<D>__{settle down. hey, quiet... please.}
<A>__{not a prayer.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{shut the hell up, goddamnit!}
<A>__{that quiets them.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{my name is conklin. let's do this fast so i can go home.}
<A>__{zachara, annoyed, looks at nick.}

<B>__{nick}
<A>__{catches the debutante's eye across the room. she smiles at him, he was right. he shrugs, spreads his hands. that's life. a well groomed middle aged man, who we'll come to know as cavello, suddenly bolts from the crowd lined up against the wall. charlie spins around to stop him }
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{whoa where do you think you're going, hotdog.}
<A>__{cavello butts him with his head, sending charlie to the floor. then, crosses his arms in front of his face and plunges through the window. nick, not missing a beat, gives a small sigh as he follows.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{fabulous...}
<A>__{he takes off after him.}
