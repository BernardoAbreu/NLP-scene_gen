<C>__{ryan }

<A>__{the tether tenses and she stops nine feet away from matt. matt ignites the thrusters, tugging ryan behind him. but this proves a difficult endeavor as her momentum drags him, changing his direction.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{see? where you go, i go.}
<A>__{matt ignites a new thrust to re direct his position. as he does so ryan's change of momentum makes him swing again.}

<D>__{better. let's get out of here.}
<A>__{using his thrusters, matt negotiates a new position and, igniting a long thrust, he jets away. ryan cannot repress the anger boiling up, and she screams }

<D>__{i know what you mean.}

<A>__{they descend, gliding through pieces of debris. among the space junk, a solar panel from the hubble is distinguished. matt eyes a small dot in the distance: the shuttle.}

<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{why aren't they answering?}

<D>__{we don't know. that's why we keep talking. if someone is listening they might just save your life. set your watch for ninety minutes.}
<A>__{matt reaches for a digital watch strapped to his wrist and sets up the timer for 90 minutes.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{why ninety?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{houston clocked that debris at fifty thousand miles per hour. factoring in our current orbit, i reckon we've got 90 minutes before we play duck and cover again.}

<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{you did all right.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{matt }
<P>__{(to the shuttle)}
<D>__{houston, in the blind. this is kowalsky. our current location is approximately 900 meters out from the explorer. dr. stone and i would like to retrieve the body of mission specialist shariff and return it to shuttle. am i a go to retrieve?}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{roger that.}
<A>__{matt changes direction and approaches shariff. he has to ignite several small thrusts to try and steady his direction, fighting against ryan's momentum.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{where is he? where is he?}
<A>__{shariff's body is tethered to a panel that was ripped away from the explorer. matt approaches the panel and ignites the thrusters to slow down his course, and he grabs onto it. ryan, continuing her momentum, crashes against shariff's body. the contact slows her trajectory, but it throws shariff away, his tether tensing, pulling the panel with him.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{oh, my god. oh, my god.}
<A>__{matt, holding on to the metal, spins with it. he detaches shariff's tether from the panel and attaches it to himself. he lets the panel go and immediately ignites his thruster, pulling the two tethers behind him which, as they tense, bring ryan and shariff closer together.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{grab him!}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i'm trying. i'm trying.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{quick. you're pulling me away.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i got him. i got him.}
<A>__{matt tries to ignite a very long thrust in the direction of the shuttle, but this is difficult as the momentum of the other two bodies pulls him in all directions.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{clutch him like he's your valentine. i can't gauge my thrust with you two yo yoing around.}
<A>__{tentatively ryan extends her right hand to grab onto shariff's body harness. and she sees shariff's broken helmet. a hole the size of a soft ball pierces through it and has left a tunnel of frozen dried bloody mess. ryan's face is inscrutable. finally she looks away, but this time something arrests her gaze: a laminated photograph floats next to shariff, tethered to his suit via a small chain. in it, a young boy laughs with abandon, happy in the embrace of a man unseen save for his two strong arms. transfixed, ryan is unable to look away, something complicated confusing her eyes. the photograph floats in the empty space above planet earth.}
<B>__{outer space.}
<A>__{as they approach, the damage to the shuttle becomes apparent. explorer has been badly hit.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{jesus...}
<A>__{the shuttle has suffered devastating damage. the tail is beyond repair, one wing is completely destroyed, while the other waffles weakly, nearly sheared from the fuselage.}
<C>__{matt }
<P>__{(grimly)}
<D>__{here's hoping you've got one monster insurance policy, houston. damages to explorer are... it's totaled. will commence search for survivors.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{02 down to five percent.}
<A>__{matt thrusts to slow down his trajectory and slowly bumps against the windshield of the cockpit. at the mercy of matt's momentum, ryan hits hard against the nose of the shuttle, losing her grip on shariff. as she caroms off, she grabs onto what is left of the cockpit's window.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{all right, here we go. careful of the edges.}
<A>__{matt takes his flashlight and looks through the broken windows, lighting the cockpit. ryan pulls herself up and looks through the window the cabin has been destroyed. a disarray of objects, smashed and devastated. at the end of the cabin, among the floating objects, a lifeless body drifts among the wreckage. ryan regards it silently, mesmerized.}
<B>__{bang.}
<A>__{the face of a second astronaut appears right in front of ryan and crashes against her visor. the eyes are frozen, unblinking. ryan gasps, wheeling backward and away. matt clicks shariff's harness onto the shuttle.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{houston, in the blind. to confirm. mission specialist dr. stone and myself, mission commander matthew kowalsky, are the sole survivors of sts 157.}
<A>__{matt turns to ryan, who is staring at the dead astronauts inside.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i apologize for not complying. i should've stopped working as soon as you instructed me to.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{we were going to be hit no matter what. there was nothing you could've done to change that.}
<A>__{he begins to reach out, hesitates briefly, then lightly touches her shoulder.}
<C>__{matt }
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{she turns, no elbows this time.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{alright... we have to get ourselves to the space station. there.}

<D>__{agreed.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{alright. after you.}
<A>__{he gently pushes her into space. she slowly drifts away from the explorer but is suddenly stopped by the safety tether. matt ignites his propellers and, giving a couple of small thrusts, he combats ryan's swing. and with a longer thrust he shoots forward, pulling ryan behind him. the two astronauts push forward together, leaving behind the shell of the shuttle and the remains of the hubble.}
<C>__{matt }

<C>__{matt }
<D>__{is there a mr. stone?}
<A>__{she frowns, unable to comprehend this initially, as if it were a particularly complicated bit of math, then shakes her head.}

<A>__{matt gives ryan a gentle push, waiting until the tether goes taut, and he gives a small thrust to position himself in the right direction. he holds this single thrust for longer than all of the previous ones, immediately gaining speed, descending towards the space station which is half a mile away, and now all of its modules are clearly visible. it also becomes clear that }

<A>__{she stops, takes one deep breath and she turns the latch and opens the re entry hatch. the hatch blows open as the air inside the cabin escapes into the vacuum, almost throwing ryan back into space, but she holds tightly onto the latch. she hangs outside, trying to gasp the last breath of oxygen inside her life system. she sees her feet dangling against the emptiness of space and with one last effort, she pulls herself into the airlock. airlock module. international space station. 500 km above earth. as she enters she does a 180 degree flip. as soon as her legs are in, she grabs onto the latch, and }

<B>__{the cabin begins to pressurize.}
<A>__{a low hissing sound can be heard as the tanks in the station begin pumping pure oxygen into the airlock. the control panel's monitor shows the atmospheric levels slowly rising. inside the helmet ryan gasps for air, but there is none. she stares at the red orange green graph on the control panel showing the atmospheric levels. it reads red. her pupils begin to dilate as sound begins to surface in the vacuum of space there was nothing to carry sound waves, but now sound begins to travel through the oxygen that slowly fills the cabin. the sounds are muffled, like the sounds of the outside world heard from within the womb. a beeping sound intermittently penetrates the airlock, anxious and halting. the control system's graph slowly moves from red to orange. the cabin is still not fully pressurized. but that will have to do. with one sharp motion she takes off her helmet and pushes it from her head. she gasps for air and coughs. she contorts and shakes, fighting to breath in the thin atmosphere of the airlock. her helmet bounces around the walls of the cabin, floating. the beeping sound has become clearer and recognizable it is an alarm ringing out across the station. orange is turning to green. her lungs begin to absorb the oxygen and her breath becomes more even. her body floats, relaxed in the confined space of the airlock.}

<A>__{the station hovers below the soyuz like a large whale swimming beneath a tiny lifeboat. the hatch of the soyuz opens. ryan comes out of the craft into space. she's wearing the space suit she packed and she carries a large bag. she holds onto handles as she floats, safely tethered to the inside of the cabin. she looks around the international space station is a looming presence floating ten meters below. it is pulling the soyuz by its parachute. an alarm on her stopwatch rings. it's been 85 minutes. she turns the alarm off and looks around.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{clear skies but with a chance of satellite debris.}
<A>__{she hums a song, the tune is reminiscent of the hank williams melody that matt had played earlier. she begins to climb around the vessel. with plenty of oxygen in her pressurized suit, this is not a difficult task. she pulls herself from handle to handle, making her way around the soyuz and reaching the parachute container an impact has blown open the cover. three ropes float out of the container into space. three meters away from the vessel each rope branches into dozens of parachute strings. next to it a second cover is also badly damaged. harnessing herself to a handle, she inspects the ropes. the three ropes are bolted to the container's frame.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{okay. we detach this and we go home. piece of cake.}
<A>__{she harnesses the bag and resumes her humming, louder this time. she unzips the bag and takes out the pistol grip tool, without noticing that behind her dozens of pieces of debris pass, zooming less than thirty meters away from the station. a tiny piece of high speed debris crashes against one of the station's solar panels, shattering it and causing the station to tremble. she places the tool against the first bolt, stretching her arm into the parachute container. it is an awkward position. she pulls the trigger and the drill rotates, turning the bolt, but it slides out of the notch. she places the tool once more against the bolt and pulls the trigger. the drill rotates, slower this time. she hums under her breath and sweat begins to drop down her forehead. she is very focused, unaware that behind her debris hits the station's solar panel, piercing holes through it.}
<B>__{the bolt comes off.}
<A>__{as it floats off into space, ryan drops the pistol grip and uses both hands to detach the rope from the frame. the rope floats away from the soyuz, undulating like a long snake, but ryan notices that the pistol grip is also floating away. she stretches her arm trying to catch it, but it is out of her reach. she pushes herself towards the pistol grip, and barely manages to grab onto it when she sees }
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{oh shit.}
<A>__{the tide of debris is floating straight at her. she pulls herself back to the container.}
<B>__{debris hits the station.}
<A>__{it crashes in silence against one of its modules, creating a hole the size of a car wheel. the vacuum sucks blue flames from the station that quickly die without oxygen to consume. ryan brings the pistol grip to the second bolt and pulls the trigger. the bolt spins. ryan is humming louder and louder. ryan stares intently at the head of the bolt turning as the debris zooms by behind her.}
<B>__{the second bolt comes off.}
<A>__{she quickly pulls the rope loose from the frame and lets it float away. shaken by the impacts, the space station drags the soyuz with it. she braces herself as debris wreaks havoc some pieces hit the station, others crash against one another. each collision creates more debris that ricochet and fly away in all directions. the soyuz is pulled by the remaining parachute rope, as the station spins out of control. ryan starts humming even louder, the bravado is full tilt now. her face is now covered in sweat, which pours into her eyes, making it difficult to see as she unscrews the last bolt. behind her, a cluster of debris pierces the parachute. ryan continues drilling as }
<B>__{more debris hit the station.}
<A>__{it crashes against the japanese lab, which silently explodes into millions of pieces. the pieces expand away from the station.}
<B>__{the last bolt comes off.}
<A>__{ryan manages to unhook the rope, freeing the soyuz from the collapsing space station. she braces herself against the vessel, as she sees }

<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{no... no... no..}

<B>__{more debris hits the station.}
<A>__{ryan watches as a succession of satellite fragments pepper the slowly revolving station segments. as the segments crumble, colliding with additional debris, the fragments glimmer magnificently then join... ...the thinning tide of debris orbiting toward the dark side of the earth. all of a sudden...}
<B>__{everything is calm.}
<A>__{she pauses, blinking into the suddenly empty distance. her gaze remains fixed on the vast nothingness for no good reason but nevertheless fixed on something.}

<A>__{a symphony of alarms shrieks loudly. the hatch flies open and a helmet floats in, followed quickly by ryan.}

<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{she takes a breath and begins fastening the seat belt.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{alright. that's good.}
<A>__{she puts on the communication headset and resets the stopwatch 85 minutes and counting down. she checks the temperature gauge she exhales, the plume of her hot breath hanging briefly in the frigid cabin air before evaporating.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{okay, let's stabilise you.}
<A>__{she takes the joystick. ryan looks focused at }
<D>__{the periscope }

<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{ok. let's visit the chinese station. houston in the blind, tiangong is approximately 100km... to the west and i am off it's course by about 3 degrees. i will correct trajectory.}
<A>__{she moves the joystick, and the crosshair readjusts.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{she releases the safety lock and places her finger on the button.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{ok. i will engage main thrust in five... four... three}

<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{two... one...}

<D>__{let's reset you then.}
<A>__{using the manual as a reference, ryan uses the cursors to select the altitude display on the computer screen. the current altitude is 2600 m. she uses the cursors and presses a button. a warning on the computer screen comes on. she presses another button, and on the screen, the altitude goes blank. ryan punches a new set of commands. the altitude now reads 3 meters.}
