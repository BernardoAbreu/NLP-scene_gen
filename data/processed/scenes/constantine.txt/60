<L>__{interior theological society later}
<A>__{a few bishops talk quietly. a cardinal studies scriptures. definitely not the place for atheists. john walks through the vaulted chamber room to the }
<B>__{library}
<A>__{john stops, fixes on the two gentlemen standing in front of a fireplace. one is a young man of pure class wrapped in armani's best. the other is father garret. john stands to the side and waits for their conversation to end. an attendant makes the rounds.}
<C>__{attendant}
<D>__{can i take your coat, mr. constantine?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no thanks, i'm not staying long.}
<C>__{attendant}
<D>__{how about you, ma'am?}
<A>__{attendant turns to angela standing just a few feet away, her gaze fixed on the same two men.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{i'm not staying long either.}
<A>__{john glances over and for the second time they make contact. something about her eyes. john stares a bit too long. angela looks back toward the fireplace.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{my business with him is urgent.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{first come, first served.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{so you're rude no matter where you are.}
<A>__{john gives her a look. the two men shake hands and start to part. john and angela make their move toward the men. both are surprised when angela goes for father garret and john goes for the snob, officially known as gabriel. yes, that one.}
<B>__{father garret}
<A>__{and angela have retreated to another area for privacy.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{why is he stalling on this? my sister needs a catholic funeral.}
<C>__{father garret}
<D>__{angela, it's still considered a mortal sin }
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{she didn't commit suicide.}
<C>__{father garret}
<D>__{the bishop has read otherwise.}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{father... david this is isabel.}
<P>__{(meeting his eyes)}
<D>__{please...}
<A>__{father garret stares at her, tries to be compassionate.}
<C>__{father garret}
<D>__{i will talk to him again.}
<A>__{but angela has just lost a load of faith.}
<B>__{by the fireplace}
<A>__{gabriel sits in his chair, watches the fire with unblinking eyes. john approaches from behind and against the backdrop of flame, sees the nebulous shape of wings. the ghostly image is visible for only a heartbeat.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<P>__{(without looking back)}
<D>__{i know what you want, son.}
<A>__{john sits across from him.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{been keeping your all seeing eye on me, have you?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i could offer how a shepherd leads even the most wayward of his flock but it might sound disingenuous.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{so you're going to make me beg?}
<A>__{angela pauses on her way out, looks over.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{it wouldn't help. you've already wasted your chance at redemption.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what about the minions i've sent back, the souls that i've saved that should guarantee my passage across }
<C>__{gabriel}
<P>__{(keeping it private)}
<D>__{ no passage requires faith and faith by definition is belief without proof. you have proof. and that means you're not playing by the same rules as everyone else. your work has mostly been for selfish reasons. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{this is bullshit bullshit!}
<A>__{now he's really got angela's attention.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it's like you've got some cosmic scale weighing everything we do help an old lady across the street put in a nickel, kick a dog, take out a dime you're fucking nickel and diming us to death down here!}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{keep your voice down.}
<A>__{john jumps up, leans into his face.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{and you know what, you're the ones with the problem, not us you make these impossible rules to decide who goes up, who goes down and you don't even understand us }
<A>__{this more than anything gets under gabriel's skin.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{each of you is born with the promise of salvation preordained. the cost of your redemption is simple belief. and yet you whine about impossible rules. sometimes i imagine you hardly deserve the gift you have been given.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{gift?! more like a curse the way you manage things.}
<A>__{gabriel stands and towers over john.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i am taking your situation into account, john, but don't push me.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{why me, gabriel? it's personal, isn't it? i didn't go to church enough? i didn't pray enough? i was five bucks short in the collection plate? why?}
<A>__{gabriel moves right up to him, makes this very personal.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you're going to die because you smoked 30 cigarettes a day since you were 15. and you're going to hell because of the life you took. or to put it in a way that your kind would understand. you're fucked.}
