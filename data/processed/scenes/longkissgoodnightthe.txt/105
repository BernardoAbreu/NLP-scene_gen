<A>__{full dark now, the fun begins... a tanker truck rumbles up the mountain road. pulls up before the deer lick motel. men in suits wield flashlights, motioning the truck forward into a cavernous garage. inside, men in blue jumpsuits operate cranes, maneuver a fill tank into place above the truck.}
<L>__{exterior surrounding mountainside same time}
<A>__{in the distance, as the tanker enters the garage charly baltimore drops into frame. lands and rolls, cat quick. comes up behind a scrawny pine. scans through a pair of zeiss nightvision binoculars. welcome to the extraction. no more fun and games, tonight it's a survival zero operation. henessey appears at her elbow. lugging the ordnance bag. he sees charly lower the binoculars, head in hands.}
