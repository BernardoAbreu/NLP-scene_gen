<L>__{interior great hall night}
<A>__{marrow steps into the dark, vast room, his glasses glinting. the faint outline of the fireplace on the far wall looms in the darkness. marrow approaches it. the mesh screen is still open. marrow stands there a moment. then looks in. he squats and tries to open the ash drop. it doesn't budge; it's jammed by the poker nell dropped in. marrow considers, then shakes his head, feels stupid for even coming in to check. suddenly his cell phone rings, startling him.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{shit.}
<P>__{(answering the phone)}
<D>__{hello? yes, this is dr. marrow.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{oh, hello. thank you for returning the call.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{no. you mean he hasn't returned?}
<P>__{(long beat)}
<D>__{no, we haven't seen him.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{can you tell me, what sort of car does he drive?}
<P>__{(beat, reacting)}
<D>__{a toyota...}
