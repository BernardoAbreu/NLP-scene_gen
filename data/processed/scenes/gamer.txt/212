<L>__{interior castle's court continuous}
<A>__{they leave the hallway and step on to an indoor, nba regulation basketball court; electronic scoreboard, bleachers, the whole nine. it's dark, moody only one bank of overhead floods is turned on. at the far end of the court, hackman is in warm ups, shooting baskets. one leg the one with the abbreviated toes is in a flex brace. the geek squad grabs seats in the bleachers.}
<C>__{ken castle}
<D>__{but mine's different.}
<P>__{(taps his forehead)}
<D>__{built to send to transmit . whereas every other k soft cell out there including the ones in...}
<P>__{(taps kable's forehead )}
<D>__{your head, kable is designed to receive. i think it, you do it.}
<A>__{castle looks across the court at hackman; nods toward him... hackman drops the ball and begins to pop lock.}
<C>__{ken castle }
<D>__{we're talking every slayer, everyone in society city... i believe your better half would fall under that category... provided they're within range of my transmitters...}
<A>__{castle chuckles at hackman; hackman stops dancing, jogs over, picks up the ball and resumes shooting.}
<C>__{kable}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{very nice, castle. so you've got an army of psychotics and deviants to dance around for you.}
<A>__{castle narrows his eyes, amusement edging out irritation; he walks over to a bin of grip powder.}
<C>__{ken castle}
<D>__{you're thinking small, kable. but not as small as me.}
<A>__{he sinks his hands into the powder, brings them out and claps, making white dust clouds. kable waves the dust away}
<B>__{from his face.}
<C>__{ken castle }
<D>__{see, nano cells are real small, a thousand times smaller than even these dust particulates...}
<P>__{(kable coughs)}
<D>__{inhale it and they go to work: replicating, spreading... like a virus, multiplying in exponentials... six months time i could have 100 million people converted ditch diggers, porn stars, presidents and not one would be the wiser.}
<A>__{behind kable, hackman lets the ball roll away and silently}
<B>__{turns toward us.}
<C>__{ken castle }
<D>__{a hundred million folks that will buy what i want them to buy, vote how i want them to vote, do pretty much damn well anything i figure they ought to do.}
<A>__{hackman comes running at kable from behind, eyes burning, at a full charge... running into focus... holding the bowie}
<B>__{knife...}
<C>__{ken castle}
<D>__{for instance.}
<A>__{kable hears hackman at the last second, spins and absorbs the tackle. the men go to the ground, grappling, ufc style. kable has hackman's knife hand by the wrist, stopping it but leaving his face unprotected... hackman brings his free elbow down on kable's face, connecting and opening a cut : under his eye; then again this time kable catches the elbow with his own free hand and wrenches it in sideways, dislocating hackman's shoulder with a sickening pop. kable works around hackman, gets him in a headlock and squeezes... still gripping the knife hand, immobilizing it... hackman is choking, beat red... for long, brutal seconds the life drains out of him... finally, hackman's eyes roll back; he goes limp. kable takes the bowie knife from hackman's dead fingers. he struggles to his feet, dripping sweat and blood.}
<C>__{kable}
<D>__{you should've let him fight for himself, castle he might've had a shot.}
<C>__{ken castle}
<P>__{(pleasant)}
<D>__{i think you're missing the point, my man.}
<C>__{kable}
<D>__{no, i get it you're pulling the strings on all of this...}
<P>__{(starts to move toward castle with bad intent)}
<D>__{... which makes my next move pretty easy to figure.}
<A>__{kable comes at castle fast, bringing the knife around to open his throat like a pez dispenser... his arm freezes in mid air, the blade inches from contact.}
<C>__{ken castle}
<D>__{neglected to mention: my smart boys reversed that hack those fellas worked for you easy breezy, once we had access to their drives...}
<A>__{this is gut wrenching for kable after tasting freedom, he feels his will ripped away from him... he's being puppeted by}
<B>__{the man he hates the most.}
<C>__{ken castle }
<D>__{you're mine, boy.}
<A>__{with a twitch of castle's eyes kable brings the knife down and slices open his own leg.}
