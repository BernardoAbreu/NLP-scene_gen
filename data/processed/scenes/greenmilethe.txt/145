<L>__{exterior paul's house dusk}
<A>__{tight on paul as softly:}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it makes sense. i read the file. hal even said it himself. wharton rambled all over the state last few years, causing trouble. hell, longer than that. been at it since he was ten. vandalism. petty theft. setting fires.}
<A>__{angle shifts to include jan, brutal, harry and dean. they're in the brambly patch that borders the woods behind the house. the sun is setting, turning the horizon fiery.}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{you saw him. you actually saw this wild bill person take those girls.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{their father hired him on for a few days last spring, help repair the barn. cheap labor, just another drifter...}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{only not.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{sick bastard came back a month later, just before dawn. took the girls...did what he did. coffey found them afterwards and tried to help. it was too late.}
<C>__{jan}
<P>__{(absorbs this)}
<D>__{then you can stop it. the execution, i mean. get coffey a new trial.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{based on what, honey? some kind of magical vision i had?}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{show this farmer what's his name, detterick? show him a picture of wild bill.}
<P>__{(off their looks)}
<D>__{why not? if wharton was there...if the farmer can identify his picture and they know he was there...}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{him being there in may doesn't mean he came back and killed those girls in june. even if he was committing other crimes.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{they got their killer as far as they're concerned. hell, coffey's own lawyer would come throw the switch if we let him.}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{then lie.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{lie? about what?}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{tell them wharton confessed to the crime. brutus, you can back him up, say you heard it too. you can say that's what set percy off. he shot wharton because he couldn't stand thinking of what happened to those two little girls, it snapped his mind...}
<P>__{(seeing their looks)}
<D>__{...what? what now?}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{we never reported anything like that. we would've, too, everybody knows it. it's part of our job.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{besides, confessing don't make it so. slugs like wild bill lie about everything. crimes they committed, women they had, even the weather.}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{but he was there! he painted their barn! he ate dinner with them!}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{all the more reason he might take credit for the crime. he's gonna fry anyway, so why not boast?}
<A>__{jan stands thinking for a moment, then:}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{all right. then you've got to get john coffey out on your own.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{ma'am?}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{you did it once, didn't you? only this time, don't bring him back.}
<A>__{dean blinks, stunned by this notion. gently:}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{ma'am, your son's grown up and moved away. my kids are just starting kindergarten. will you be the one to explain to them why their daddy's in prison?}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{work out a plan. make it look like a real escape.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{better be a plan an imbecile could dream up. nobody'd believe it otherwise.}
<C>__{brutal}
<D>__{even if we did think of something, it wouldn't do any good.}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{why not? just why the hell not?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{because he's a six foot eight inch baldheaded black man with barely enough brains to feed himself. how long you think it'd be before he was recaptured? two hours? six?}
<A>__{jan swipes a tear away with the heel of her hand. softly:}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{do you mean to kill him, you cowards? do you?}
<A>__{paul tries to take her hand. she wrenches away, furious.}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{don't touch me! next week this time you'll be a murderer, no better than that man wharton, so don't touch me!}
<A>__{she runs off toward the house, starting to sob as we}
