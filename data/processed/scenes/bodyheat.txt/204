<A>__{grace has gotten out of his car. he starts toward the front door, but sees racine out on the lawn. he heads out in that direction, but stops as racine steps into a bright spot of moonlit lawn and the gun's shiny silverplate glints in the light. the gun is pointed at the retreating matty. grace pulls his own gun from a shoulder holster and raises it. he is about to call out, when matty disappears completely in the gloom. racine lowers the revolver wearily and stares out toward the boathouse. grace lowers his gun and looks out there too. he moves slowly forward. close on racine's face. it's changing now. it's not just that he's very tired. the hardness is going out of his look. as the seconds tick by, and matty does not reappear, he begins to lose faith in his view of the world. he begins to be afraid. afraid for matty. even now. a sudden breeze starts the wind chimes tinkling loudly.}

<D>__{no, matty! stop! don't go in! matty.}
<A>__{racine breaks into a run, dropping the revolver on the grass. he has taken two big strides when there is a sound like the roar of a dragon, and the roof of the boathouse lifts and then disappears in a huge ball of flame. the air is sucked around racine's body, whipping at his clothes, as he stumbles on the lawn and falls forward. grace steadies himself against the side of the gazebo. racine knows horror. he struggles to his feet and stumbles toward the fire. his body is silhouetted against the leaping, roaring flames in the night sky.}
