<L>__{exterior farmhouse night}
<A>__{a lonely farmhouse stands amid the fields of upstate new york farm country. several lights are on and through a window we can see the silhouette of a man sitting at the kitchen table, the silhouette of a woman hovering over him, bringing things to him. the man (edgar) waves his arms, ranting.}
<C>__{edgar }
<D>__{i go out, i work my butt off to make a living, all i want is to come home to a nice clean house with a nice fat steak on the table, but instead i get this this i don't even know what you call this!}
<A>__{in the sky above, it's one of those brilliant star fields. but something strange is happening with one of those stars it's getting bigger.}
<C>__{edgar }
<D>__{i will tell you what it looks like, it looks like poison. don't you take that away, i'm eating that, damn it! it is poison, isn't it?!}
<A>__{no, that star isn't getting bigger, it's moving. toward us. fast. it goes from a pinpoint to a dime, to a nickel, to a quarter, and works its way into fruit metaphors.}
<C>__{edgar }
<D>__{i swear to god, i would not be surprised if it was, the way you skulk around here like a dog been hit too much or ain't been hit enough, i can't make up my mind.}
<A>__{okay, we're way past watermelon now, that thing is huge, and it's starting to glow hot red as it enters the earth's atmosphere, headed straight toward us, coming here, to beatrice and edgar's place. the blazing fireball barrels through the sky, snaps off a couple trees }
<C>__{edgar }
<D>__{you're useless, beatrice! the only thing that pulls its weight around here is my goddamn truck!}
<A>__{ and slams right through a pickup truck parked in the driveway. a concussive blast follows, then a geyser of smoke and flame erupts.}
<C>__{edgar }
<D>__{stay here!}
<A>__{the silhouette of edgar leaps to its feet, races to the door, and throws it open. edgar is everything his voice led us to expect a nasty, bug eyed redneck carrying a twelve gauge shotgun. his mouth agape, he walks across the yard and stares at the hulking shell that was his truck. the skeleton of the truck is still there, but there's a huge, smoldering hole in it, a hole that goes at least ten feet down into the ground.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{figures.}
<A>__{he walks to the truck and touches the door handle. hot. using his shirt tail, he opens the door and peers down into the hole. in the hole, he sees a smooth curve of metal and a few blinking lights. embedded into the ground is, indeed, a spaceship, maybe eight feet across. beatrice calls from behind him, standing in the doorway fearfully.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{what is it, edgar?!}
<C>__{edgar}
<P>__{(turns to her)}
<D>__{get your big butt back in that house!}
<A>__{beatrice does as she's told, closing the door behind her. edgar turns back to the smoldering rock, raising his shotgun in defense. an otherworldly voice comes from deep in the hole.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{place projectile weapon on ground.}
<A>__{edgar staggers back a step, terrified. but then he regains himself, raises the weapon, and steps forward, pointing it menacingly down into the hole.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{you can have my gun when you pry it from my cold, dead fingers!}
<A>__{there is a pause while the voice thinks about this offer. finally, it responds, in a voice and cadence remarkably similar to edgar's.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{your proposal is acceptable.}
<A>__{a long, hairy pincer flashes out of the hole, grabs edgar by the head, and pulls him down into the hole. from deep in the hole, we hear a terrible ripping sound, like a bedsheet being torn in half. there are some disgusting gushy sounds, then a moment later, something flies out of the hole and flops onto the ground next to the truck. it's edgar. well, sort of. his body parts still hang together face, arms, legs, even clothes but everything inside has been removed and now he just lies there, flat and empty, like a tuxedo on the floor after the prom. the shotgun flies out and lands beside him.}
