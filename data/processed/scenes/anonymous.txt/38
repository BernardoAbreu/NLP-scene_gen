<L>__{exterior maze day}
<A>__{oxford turns to jonson.}
<C>__{oxford}
<D>__{i enjoyed your little comedy last week, jonson. you have potential, great potential.}
<C>__{jonson}
<D>__{thank you, my lord.}
<C>__{oxford}
<D>__{but it's politics did seem to have quite an effect on the tower. my father in law's men felt it quite seditious.}
<C>__{jonson}
<D>__{politics? my play had nothing to do with politics! it was just a simple comedy }
<C>__{oxford}
<D>__{that showed your betters as fools who go through life barely managing to get food from plate to mouth, were it not for the cleverness of their servants.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{all art is political, jonson. otherwise it would just be decoration. and all artists have something to say, otherwise... they'd make shoes. and you're not a cobbler, are you, jonson?}
<A>__{as they enter the center of the maze, oxford turns to his servant.}
<C>__{oxford }
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{francesco.}
<A>__{francesco steps forward and hands jonson a leather bound manuscript. jonson looks at it confused and opens it.}
<C>__{jonson}
<D>__{a play, my lord?}
<C>__{oxford}
<D>__{one you shall stage bankside.}
<C>__{jonson}
<D>__{stage?}
<C>__{oxford}
<D>__{under your name.}
<C>__{jonson}
<D>__{my name, my lord?}
<C>__{oxford}
<D>__{i can't very well use my name, can i? i'm the seventeenth earl of oxford. the lord great chamberlain of england, viscount bolebec, lord escales, sandford and badlesmere, etc, etc. no. i have a... reputation to protect. in my world, one does not write plays, jonson. people like you do.}
<A>__{jonson tries not to be offended.}
<C>__{jonson}
<D>__{yes. my lord. you wrote an entire play, my lord. i know how difficult }
<C>__{oxford}
<D>__{not a play, jonson, i've written many. no doubt, many more than you yourself. a good number performed at court years ago, others never seen by a living soul.}
<C>__{jonson}
<D>__{and you want... me to apply my name to this play?}
<C>__{oxford}
<D>__{no. i mean you to put your name to all of them.}
<C>__{jonson}
<D>__{all of them?}
<C>__{oxford}
<D>__{well don't look like i just gutted your pet dog, jonson. i mean to make you the most popular and therefore the most monetarily successful playwright in all of london.}
<A>__{jonson pales. this is a disaster for him.}
<C>__{oxford }
<D>__{i wish you god speed and good morrow.}
<A>__{jonson looks down at the manuscript, reads a few lines.}
<C>__{jonson}
<D>__{my lord i really }
<A>__{he looks up, but oxford is gone, having left the maze without so much as a good bye.}
<C>__{jonson }
<D>__{my lord?}
<A>__{but before he can follow, francesco tosses a leather pouch of coins at his feet.}
<C>__{francesco}
<D>__{that is for your trouble, signor jonson. and your silence. if i hear you break that silence, then... not so good for signor jonson.}
<A>__{and francesco follows after his master as jonson picks up the pouch, examining its contents. and then jonson realizes he doesn't know how to get out of the maze. he chases after them.}
<C>__{jonson}
<D>__{hello? my lord?! i }
<A>__{and he's lost. he looks this way and that, then picks a path (the wrong one).}
