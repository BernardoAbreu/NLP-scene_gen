<A>__{a stand of trees. the pastoral lush green virginia. a rabbit surfaces from its hole. peace and beauty. a second rabbit shakes itself from the ground, darts into open ground to confront the forbidding trenches of the confederate and union armies, ranged against each other on the outskirts of petersburg. massive wooden barricades in the shape of crosses, rows of x's, define the two lines. the federals have been laying siege for months. so early and it's already hot. the trees are an oasis of green in a world of mud between the two stark and ugly scars of the trenches. in the confederate lines, the men are rousing, boiling water for coffee or to shave, smoking, stiff from night. there's a large gun emplacement and some men still sleep against the stub nosed cannon. another rabbit is disturbed from its hole. ears pricked up to a distant rumbling.}
