<L>__{exterior west side car chase montage night}
<A>__{with spidey jammed in between liz and flash, the mg chases the vette. since neither ock nor flash is any good at this, both cars quickly careen into poles, fences, hot dog cars and begin falling apart. on riverside drive the mg begins to lurch and steam. the vette looks eaten away. the george washington bridge looms ahead. the vette roars through the toll booth. they spot ock stuck in traffic.}
<C>__{flash}
<D>__{why is he going to new jersey, and who is it in that shitty red car...}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{don't you recognize him... it's ock! spider man new jersey has the largest toxic waste dump in the world.}
<C>__{flash}
<D>__{what does he want with toxic waste? spider man he's looking for plutonium, my dear... the car has to slow down... it's in a traffic jam.}
<C>__{flash}
<D>__{sorry... can't do anything about this traffic.}
<A>__{spider man jumps out of the car.}
<D>__{spider man try to stay with me. i don't want to lose him!}
<A>__{speeding along the bridge, ock sees no one. but high above, spidey swings from tower to tower after him. at the last tower, spidey leaps down onto a big truck. the vette weaves and spidey crosses to another big truck. for a moment he is caught between the two trucks, but he makes it across. the vette takes an exit. spidey leaps to the next sign. he aims his wrist gizmo and waits for the next car to take the exit, but none does. deflated, he drops to the ground. he looks up to see a sign on a cyclone fence. it says, "dump number 7 keep out radioactive material!"}
<D>__{spider man bingo.}
