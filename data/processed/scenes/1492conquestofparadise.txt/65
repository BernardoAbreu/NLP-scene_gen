<L>__{exterior santa maria deck day}
<A>__{most of the men are now back on board. they go silent as columbus appears. he walks slowly over to them. all, including alonso, are surly, threatening...}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{who gave you the order to come on board?}
<A>__{he looks up and down the line, finishing on alonso. they stare at one another.}
<C>__{alonso}
<D>__{god doesn't want us to cross the ocean...! this voyage is cursed!}
<A>__{some of the men murmur their agreement.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{cursed?}
<C>__{alonso}
<D>__{we set sail for greed. god has abandoned us. the voyage is cursed. there are signs...}
<A>__{alonso glances towards the ship's boy, with his hair lip. the boy lowers his eyes. columbus moves towards him, pulls him forward, stands him in front of alonso.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{this boy has the voice of an angel. what comes out of his mouth is blessed, alonso. what comes out of your is evil.}
<A>__{some of the men laugh at this statement. alonso is ill at ease. columbus pauses, looks around at all the men.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{listen to me! every man is afraid who does something for the first time. but those who overcome their fears, will find their rewards. i do not know if it is god's will that we cross this ocean but i am certain it is the devil who puts fears into our hearts...}
<A>__{the men are listening. we sense a subtle change of mood...}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{this jacket to the first man who sights land! i want a man up that mast day and night.}
<A>__{columbus points at the ship's boy.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{you start first.}
<A>__{the ship's boy rushes up the mast. as he climbs, the mainsail starts to fill with wind. the deck begins to move under their feet. this movement under their feet seems to imperceptibly erase the fears and the angers.}
<C>__{mendez}
<D>__{alonso! jaime! don't let this wind escape us.}
<A>__{cries from the other ships, as the sails snap taut, filling with wind. men rush to their posts. pinzon stares at columbus, shaking his head in disbelief.}
<C>__{pinzon}
<P>__{(murmuring)}
<D>__{you lucky bastard...}
<A>__{columbus walks away to his cabin, then turning back to}
<B>__{pinzon.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{pinzon, the more i sail, the luckier i get.}
<A>__{turning abruptly, he enters his cabin.}
