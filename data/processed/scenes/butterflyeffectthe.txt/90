<L>__{exterior ridgewood diner night}
<A>__{kayleigh struggles with the zipper of a shabby coat as she exits. evan steps out of the shadows. she's startled at first, but eventually recognizes him. a smile flickers across her face and she allows herself to be hugged.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{god, evan! i never thought i'd see you again. how've you been?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{oh, comme si, comme ca, you know...}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{no, evan. i don't know. it's been a long time. fill me in.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i'm going to state now. things are going okay. i guess. mom's good...}
<A>__{kayleigh nods and they walk down the street. she reaches into her pocket, pulls out a pack of smokes.}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(declining)}
<D>__{not since we were kids.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{i've stopped a hundred times.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{so how's tommy?}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<P>__{(takes a long drag)}
<D>__{they kept him in juvy for a few years. now he works over at dale's autobody.}
<A>__{evan nods and scrutinizes her face with his next question.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{you still live with your dad?}
<A>__{her face is betrayed by a slight tick.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{no. i emancipated myself when i was fifteen.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{wow. that must've taken some courage.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{not if you remember my dad.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{couldn't you have moved in with your mom?}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{she had a new family. not enough space for me. said i should have moved in with her when we were kids. but... whatever.}
<A>__{they walk in silence for a moment.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{actually, kayleigh, the reason i came back to town was to talk to you.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<P>__{(brightening)}
<D>__{me? are you kidding? why?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{remember when i was a kid i had all these blackouts?}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{well, lately some of the memories have begun to come back and i'd kinda like to talk to you about one of them in particular. it'd be a big help.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{well, sure. i will try to remember. shoot.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{when we were kids. your dad was making a movie. robin hood or something?}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<P>__{(cold)}
<D>__{what do you want to know, evan?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{it's just... did he... what happened in the basement?}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{it was a long time ago.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i know, but...}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<P>__{(cold)}
<D>__{is that why you came all the way back? to ask a lot of stupid questions about robin hood?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{no, but i think something really bad might've happened to us.}
<A>__{kayleigh stops walking and crushes her cigarette.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{is there a point to any of this?}
<A>__{evan's features shift from inquisitory to tenderness. he steps closer to kayleigh and softly strokes her face. she flinches at first, but remains in the same spot.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{whatever happened, it wasn't our fault. you know we couldn't have stopped it.}
<A>__{kayleigh begins to tremble. tears flow.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{look, kayleigh. this may sound like bullshit coming from a guy who hasn't spoken to you in seven years...}
<A>__{she moves her face away from his hand.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{but you were seven years old and there's nothing you could've done to deserve...}
<A>__{her face collapses and she turns away.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<P>__{(defeated)}
<D>__{just shut up, evan. you're wasting your breath.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{you can't hate yourself just because your dad's a twisted freak.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{who are you trying to convince, evan?! you come all the way out here to stir up my shit just because you had a bad memory!? you want me to cry on your shoulder and tell you that everything's all better now? well fuck you, evan! nothing's gonna be all better! okay?! nothing ever gets better!}
<A>__{kayleigh runs, stops and turns back to evan.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{if i was so wonderful, evan, why didn't you ever call me? why'd you leave me here to rot?!}
<A>__{she turns and runs away. evan looks sick with guilt.}
