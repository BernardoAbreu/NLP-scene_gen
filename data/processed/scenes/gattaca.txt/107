<L>__{exterior jerome's pool. morning.}
<A>__{jerome sits at his own poolside in his robe, feet dangling over the edge, smoking a cigarette. eugene, from his wheelchair, is applying bleach to jerome's hair and eyebrows with gloved hands. at the same time, jerome plays a sleight of hand game with a syringe.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{how was your evening?}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{complicated. i couldn't stop her apologizing.}
<C>__{eugene}
<P>__{(teasing)}
<D>__{you}
<A>__{are a catch. no doubt she's worried that}
<D>__{she would lower the standard of your offspring. everybody wants to "breed up".}
<P>__{(idly curious)}
<D>__{what's wrong with her?}
<C>__{jerome}
<P>__{(trying to be blase)}
<D>__{you know how it is with these altered births somebody told her she's not going to live forever and she's been preparing to die ever since.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{you're not thinking of telling her, are you?}
<C>__{jerome}
<D>__{of course not. but she's have to know eventually.}
<C>__{eugene}
<P>__{(adamant)}
<D>__{she doesn't}
<A>__{have to know. she doesn't want to know. the camera travels down jerome's scarred legs to find that the pool is completely drained. we now realize that it never contained water.}
<B>__{a barren wasteland.}
<A>__{a desolate landscape, resembling the surface of the planet mars. we pull back to find that we are peering at this forbidding desert through a circular aperture.}
