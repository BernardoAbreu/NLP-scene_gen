<L>__{interior plane night}
<A>__{martin reclines in first class, soaring toward the midwest on the red eye. he has already scanned his magazines and they are piled in the empty seat next to him. he sets aside a powerbar. martin reads kill without joy. after a moment, he sets the book down and takes up iron john.}
<L>__{interior detroit airport terminal early morning}
<A>__{at the edge of the airport bar sits lardner and mccullers, two government spooks, agency unknown. they are both in blazers, no ties, early thirties, and they watch the passing crowd.}
<C>__{lardner}
<D>__{you always say that. you always say that. i'm telling you, you never met the man.}
<C>__{mccullers}
<D>__{seventeen months ago i was posting a walk in lisbon, and he was there. he never saw me. but i saw him, though.}
<C>__{lardner}
<D>__{lisbon?}
<C>__{mccullers}
<D>__{in portugal, yes.}
<A>__{in the background, martin passes by them as he walks down the hall. without directly regarding him, the two stand, drop some cash on the bar, and begin to leave.}
<C>__{lardner}
<D>__{here's the news: he hasn't been in portugal since '90. i know that from the file. why don't you read the file, man?}
<C>__{mccullers}
<D>__{in fact, i think i talked with him, in bonn.}
<A>__{lardner can neither confirm nor deny this.}
<C>__{lardner}
<D>__{you always say that. you always have to know everybody. why don't i just take the weekend off and let you kill him. since you two are so close.}
<A>__{they exit.}
