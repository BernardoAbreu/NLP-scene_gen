<L>__{interior vivienne's office day continuous}
<A>__{the office boasts many glass cases full of trophies and framed photos of vivienne's younger self showjumping and holding trophies aloft. there's one small photo of vivienne, arthur's late father gerald and arthur as a toddler. vivienne's engrossed in a document, making notations. arthur, clearly uncomfortable here, sits in a low sofa before her.}
<C>__{vivienne}
<P>__{(not looking up)}
<D>__{so. how are you, arthur?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{quite busy. i have a riding boot shoot for petrie dressage...}
<A>__{but vivienne's buried in her work, not listening.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{what else...i'm meeting ivanka trump for brunch to discuss the environment. she's sending her helicopter to avoid the traffic...}
<A>__{vivienne's still not listening.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{crashed my batmobile into the bronze bull on wall street...}
<A>__{she's still not listening. has it always been like this?}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{...which caused a hole to swallow up the new york stock exchange...}
<A>__{she's still not listening.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{..the world economy to collapse and the planet to descend into looting and cannibalism.}
<A>__{still not listening.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{what else? um...tripped over in the shower this morning. head split open, found a family of meerkats hiding in there! hated the thought of the little lads being homeless so i bricked up the remaining half of my brain, popped them back in and hobson glued my skull back together.}
<A>__{still not listening.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{i'm thinking of buying a giant. i think the market's right for it.}
<A>__{arthur stops. he watches vivienne. he lets out a huge belch. nothing. a big fart. nothing. opera. nothing.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{you really are a shoddy mother.}
<A>__{vivienne eventually looks up.}
<C>__{vivienne}
<D>__{did i hear you say you were meeting ivanka trump for brunch? that's nice. right. today we're going to have a friendly chat. then a serious talk. and lastly make a timetable. how does all that sound?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{amazing. do you have any vodka?}
<C>__{vivienne}
<D>__{what happened, arthur? you were such a sweet baby.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i still wake up in my own poo occasionally.}
<C>__{vivienne}
<D>__{right, that's it for the chat. time to transition to our talk.}
<A>__{vivienne hits a remote control. a large wall mounted screen fills with a changing collage of him drunk, dancing, puking, making out with women, beside countless news headlines.}
<C>__{vivienne }
<D>__{this insanity has to end, arthur. as the delightful coffee coloured gentleman who runs this country said, `the time has come to set aside childish things.'}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{can't hobson set them aside for me?}
<C>__{vivienne}
<D>__{susan is a splendid girl. her feet are on the ground, she's of fine stock...}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(gets up)}
<D>__{oh. that's what this is all about. i'm not marrying susan. i don't love her.}
<C>__{vivienne}
<D>__{and? you think i spent my marriage to your father skipping through meadows?}
<C>__{arthur}
<A>__{not after you ran him over in the bentley, no. susan's boring. she's not funny.}
<C>__{vivienne}
<A>__{ditto your father. the aristocracy doesn't marry for `fun', arthur. it's about stability. continuity...}
<C>__{arthur}
<A>__{...and sinking your fangs into susan's father's bank account.}
<C>__{vivienne}
<A>__{the johnson family's considerable equity in a stormy financial period is merely a side issue. burt is a pillar of the community.}
<C>__{arthur}
<A>__{his baby formula was taken off the market in six african countries!}
<C>__{vivienne}
<A>__{a completely innocent error in places where there's precious little for children to live for anyway. the families all got gift baskets as compensation. that little bump in the road aside, burt is a devout christian.}
<C>__{arthur}
<A>__{yes, because they're never insane. and where did he get jesus?}
<C>__{vivienne}
<P>__{(getting exasperated)}
<A>__{burt paid his debt to society years ago.}
<C>__{arthur}
<A>__{he strangled a fireman! who strangles a fireman?}
<C>__{vivienne}
<A>__{arthur...}
<C>__{arthur}
<A>__{i'm sorry, vivienne. i've met someone else very lovely who, as far as i know, isn't related to anyone who would kill an unsung hero in cold blood.}
<C>__{vivienne}
<A>__{un meet her. arthur, you're the end of our line. we need an heir.}
<C>__{arthur}
<A>__{i nearly gave you an heir!}
<C>__{vivienne}
<A>__{oh, give me strength! a bach templemead having a child by a lap dancer called `mystery'?}
<C>__{arthur}
<A>__{that was just her stage name! to give her more mystery when she...waved her fanny around. her real name was...what was it again?}
<C>__{vivienne}
<A>__{susan is 33 this year. her egg inventory has dropped by 23% since you met her. you risk having no sons, or worse, some pea brained hunchback who hugs everyone!}
<C>__{arthur}
<A>__{great! i like hugs! and some of them are really good at math.}
<P>__{(heading to the door)}
<A>__{you know the `frog and toad' books?}
<C>__{vivienne}
<A>__{no.}
<C>__{arthur}
<A>__{of course you don't. hobson read them to me while you were off riding horses over stripey poles. they're about fun and friendship, not how many unspasticated tadpoles i can squirt up a rich girl.}
<C>__{vivienne}
<A>__{your father would turn in his grave to hear this nonsense...}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{that i won't follow in his footsteps and marry a woman i hate? i think he might climb out of the grave and dance on it.}
<C>__{vivienne}
<D>__{suit yourself.}
<A>__{vivienne holds up the document she was notating earlier.}
<C>__{vivienne }
<D>__{my will, which i have updated to designate grant in reception as the sole beneficiary.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you wouldn't! you're my...}
<C>__{vivienne}
<D>__{...vivienne? try me.}
<A>__{vivienne opens a draw and takes out a huge ring box.}
<C>__{vivienne }
<D>__{shall we segue to the timetable part of our meeting?}
