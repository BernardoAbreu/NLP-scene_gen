<A>__{from macreedy and smith to exploit the reactions of the loafers at the bar.)}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(with effortless ferocity)}
<D>__{you're still in trouble.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{so are you.}
<P>__{(smith snorts)}
<D>__{whatever happens you're lost.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{you got things a bit twisted...}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{you killed komako. sooner or later you'll go up for it. not because you killed him in this town you probably could have gotten away with it but because you didn't even have the guts to do it alone. you put your trust in guys like him...}
<P>__{(gesturing toward the unconscious coley)}
<D>__{...and hector they're not the most dependable of god's creatures. sooner or later they'll get the idea you're playing them for saps. what'll you do then peel them off, one by one? and in the meantime if any one of them breaks, you'll go down hard. because they got something on you. something to use when things get tough.}
<A>__{with a quick motion, he tosses the knife to smith. smith catches it.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{and they're getting tougher every minute.}
<A>__{he walks past smith and goes out the door. self consciously holding the knife, smith turns to face the loafers at the bar. they say nothing; they stare at him, through him, like a panel of ghouls. the door opens, admitting sam and doc, who carries his little black medical bag. doc looks at coley.}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(softly, full of awe)}
<D>__{man... man oh man.}
<A>__{he goes to coley, bending down over him. smith has remained motionless as a monument. now he doubles shut the knife in his hand. he pockets it, and without even glancing at coley, turns quickly and goes out.}
