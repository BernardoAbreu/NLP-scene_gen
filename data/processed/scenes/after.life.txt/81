<L>__{interior paul's apartment. living room night}
<A>__{paul stands motionless in the middle of the room. staring blankly into space. the room feels empty and depressing. he suddenly looks around. not quite sure why he came into the room in the first place. he moves over to a cd player. mechanically switches it on. music fills the room. he turns the volume higher. then all the way up. the music's unbearably loud but paul just stands there. numb.}
<B>__{on paul}
<A>__{the music's strangely distorted now. almost silent. as if we were inside paul's head.}
