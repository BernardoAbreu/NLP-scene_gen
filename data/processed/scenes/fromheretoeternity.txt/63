<L>__{exterior road day}
<B>__{long shot}
<A>__{par below in the shot are prew, hiking, and galovitch, riding behind him on the bicycle. the dirt road is steep and the sun pours down, steaming hot.}
<B>__{moving shot prew and galovitch}
<A>__{prew is hunched under the seventy pound pack as he plods along. he is sweat soaked, puffing, dog weary. galovitch's bicycle is just behind him; he runs the wheels up on prew's heels.}
<C>__{galovitch}
<D>__{move along. you not half way yet. three more miles to top.}
<A>__{a jeep rounds a curve a couple of hundred yards above and moves down the road. it slows its speed and pulls up when it nears prew and galovitch.}
<B>__{medium shot}
<A>__{the jeep is driven by an enlisted man. sitting next to him is major general slater. galovitch hops off the bike and he and prew snap to attention. general slater leans out of the vehicle. he seems puzzled and interested by the odd sight of the two men.}
<C>__{general slater}
<D>__{at ease. where're you men headed?}
<C>__{galovitch}
<D>__{top of pass, sir. this man insubordinate. the captain is teaching him lesson.}
<C>__{general slater}
<P>__{(frowns)}
<D>__{what's your outfit, sergeant?}
<C>__{galovitch}
<D>__{company g, 219th, sir.}
<A>__{the general, still frowning slightly, nods. he signals his driver to move on. the jeep starts down the road. galovitch gets on his bicycle. prew starts hiking again.}
