<L>__{interior bob's apartment. day}
<A>__{bob is standing by his kitchenette, extremely nervous. sammy sits on his sofa.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{do you want to go for a walk, or a drive? it's really nice out.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{no. i'm not gonna stay long. bob, i don't want to get married.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{ok.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{i've really thought about it a lot, and if you had asked me last year i'm sure i would have said yes.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{oh. thank you.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{but i'm not sure it would have been a good idea then either. i'm going through a really hard time right now and i just think that getting engaged to you or anyone would be just about the stupidest most self destructive thing i could possibly do.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{ok.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{and i really think you have to grow up.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{well, how about we fix up my personality some other time?}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{ok.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i really hope we can still be friends.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(quietly sarcastic)}
<D>__{oh, yes, me too.}
<A>__{she looks at him miserably.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{bob... this is so crazy... i mean... i don't even understand why you... i don't even get it.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{what do you want me to say? everything you said about me was true, sammy. i was just a big chickenshit jerk, and now i'm payin' the price.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{bob...!}
<A>__{she goes over to him. he gets up.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{well i don't know...}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i don't know. sammy, i love you. i wish i could say it in a more interesting way. i just i love you.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{well i mean i love you too }
<A>__{he puts his arms around her and kisses her. she responds very warmly. just as things are heating up, she suddenly remembers something and jolts away.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{oh shit.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{i gotta go. i'm sorry }
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{where do you have to go?}
<C>__{sammy}
<P>__{(off the top of her head)}
<D>__{i'm supposed to i gotta get mabel back her car.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{well... i don't understand. how are we leaving things?}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{oh god, i don't know. call me later.}
