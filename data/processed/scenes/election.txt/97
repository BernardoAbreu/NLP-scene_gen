<A>__{standing on an overturned garbage can and wielding the straight edge, tracy tries to smooth the banner. but she's not holding the ruler flat against the wall and rip! she slices the banner lengthwise. now the plastic garbage can begins to buckle. struggling to retain her balance, tracy accidentally hooks the banner and as she tumbles yanks the whole thing down. overcome with anger and frustration, she thrashes around on the ground and tears up what remains of her banner. paul metzler smiles down at tracy from his poster across the hall. tracy looks up at it. instantly she is on her feet, lunging for the poster. she jumps up, tears it down, and rips paul's head into pieces. blood issues from a thin paper cut on one hand. tracy regards it at first without comprehending, then raises it to her mouth. while sucking her wound, her gaze falls on another smiling paul mocking her pain.}
