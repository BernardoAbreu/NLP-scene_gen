<D>__{how about now?}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{sixty pounds.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{what? you sure?}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{that's what it says.}

<L>__{interior arctic warrior pilothouse night}
<A>__{through the pilothouse windows, the hull of the chimera disappears into the darkness beyond the tug's work lights. murphy sits at the chart table as epps steps in.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{coffee?}
<C>__{murphy}
<P>__{(sitting up)}
<D>__{yeah. thanks.}
<A>__{she brings him his cup, seeing the documents he brought back from the chimera.}
<C>__{epps}
<P>__{(taking a seat)}
<D>__{what'd you find up there?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{some charts. a crew manifest.}
<P>__{(looking them over)}
<D>__{looks like her last voyage was january 1953. the question is where the hell's she been since.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{she was sailing up north, right?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{her destination was halifax, yeah.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{well, suppose she got a little further north than she should have. got stuck in the ice. the passengers and crew evacuated. she froze into the ice pack, which moved further north, where it froze in solid. they write it off. fifty years later, the whole global warming thing happens. the ice melts, she gets loose and floats around til somebody runs into her.}
<A>__{murphy nods, considering it.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{as reasonable an explanation as any, i guess.}
<A>__{epps takes a sip of her coffee as she thinks about it.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{ever heard of the mary celeste?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{nope.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{she was a two masted brig boat sailing out of new york in 1872. one day she was sighted off the coast of portugal by a merchant vessel, the dei gratia. as the crew of the dei gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the mary celeste. on boarding, they found her completely deserted. the captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. the last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. the table was even set for dinner. and in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{so what did happen?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{nobody knows. there've been a lot of theories, of course. but we'll never really know for sure.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you think she's sailing without a crew?}
<A>__{murphy looks out at the chimera off the bow.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{i think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you're more practical than superstitious.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{only way to be.}
<A>__{epps nods, takes another sip of coffee, looking on at the rusting hull of the chimera stretching off in the light.}
