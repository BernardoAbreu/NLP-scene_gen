<A>__{storm lashed sea and driving rain. a great wave rises up and hammers down. as it recedes we see the figures of men heaving on great ropes, the sea water streaming down over their faces. the harsh storm light catches glints of metal: these men are convicts, chained by manacles, heads shaved, wearing red shirts with prison numbers crudely stitched onto them. now we see that the ropes run up to a ship that is being hauled ashore a storm damaged man of war, its masts broken, rising and falling on the surge. as yet another great wave rolls over the convicts, we follow the straining ropes down into the base of the slipway, and find the convict jean valjean, up to his waist in water, chained by two sets of manacles, as the rain and spray and wind scream round him. a great brute of a man, he seems to feel nothing. the convicts sing in time with the rhythmic pulls on the rope }

<A>__{the camera rises up to find javert, the officer in charge of the convict workforce, looking on, his face rain lashed and expressionless. he stands above the men on the top of the dock, as lines of convicts labour beneath him on the steep steps of the dock wall. behind javert, through the storm rain we glimpse a forest of half built ships, their ribbed frames like great skeletons in the mist. foreground convicts are at work on another ship that is almost completed, labouring in the crashing spray.}

<A>__{with a last great heave the lines of convicts haul the damaged ship onto the slipway. crack! the stern flagpole of the ship snaps in a vicious gust of wind and crashes down into the shallow water near valjean. javert sees and points his stick at valjean in silent command. valjean stares back for a beat, defying him. then he drops down into the seething water and re emerges with the great mast in his hands, held over his head. his head breaks water with his bitter gaze still on javert, as he throws the mast ashore in a deliberate display of strength. javert nods to the guards, and they begin to form the chained men into lines to return to their prison. the storm is passing now, blown by the driving wind. javert approaches jean valjean.}

<A>__{valjean makes his way up a rising track, a worn knapsack on his back. he comes to a stop at the top of the hill, and there before him, lit by the rising sun, spreads a wide vista of fields and towns and villages, stretching into the distance, with the snow capped alps beyond. behind and below him lies toulon at the sea's edge. as we hear the musical theme ('freedom is mine'), we see for the first time the darkness in his face give way to a new hope.}

<P>__{(to valjean)}
<D>__{please sit.}
<A>__{the bishop gently takes his arm and draws him into a chair. valjean sits, and the housekeeper lays food before him. famished, valjean eats like an animal. the bishop says a short grace.}

<L>__{interior bedroom, bishop's house night}
<A>__{the bishop leads valjean to a bedroom where the walls are also painted with religious imagery. across the passage, valjean sees the open door to the bishop's own bedroom. there the housekeeper is putting the table silver away in a cupboard. he turns to see a bed made up with clean white linen waiting for him. he hasn't slept in such a bed ever in his life. but the bishop is smiling, offering it to him.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{sleep well. tomorrow morning before you leave you will have a cup of milk from our cows, nice and hot.}
<A>__{the bishop turns away to go to sleep.}

<D>__{you let me sleep here next to you? how do you know i'm not a murderer?}
<A>__{valjean laughs a strange laugh.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{god will take care of that.}
<A>__{later that night valjean lies on the bed, fully dressed, deeply asleep. outside a dog barks. valjean's eyes snap open. the first thing he sees by the light of the moon is an image of god the father gazing down on him from the painted ceiling. in panic, fearing judgement, he sits bolt upright. then he looks round, and remembers. he gets out of bed, and opens the door. there, across the narrow passage, the door stands open to the bishop's bedroom. in the moonlight, he sees the bishop lying asleep. above his bed, the cupboard where the silver is kept. valjean moves silently into the bishop's room, holding a metal miner's spike which he pulls from his bag. the floor boards creak. he looks down at the old man, holding his breath, but the bishop is peacefully and innocently asleep. he reaches up to the cupboard. it is unlocked. the cupboard door opens with a sharp cracking sound. the bishop, disturbed in his sleep, moves a little. at once valjean is over him, like a wild animal, spike raised to strike should he wake. the bishop sleeps on. the moon comes out and lights up his beautific, smiling face. valjean is thrown. he turns back and opens the cupboard door fully: there is the silver. carefully he picks it out, fearful of every clink. one last look at the sleeping old man, and he makes a run for the door.}

<A>__{he upends valjean's kitbag, and the silver tumbles out. the bishop looks from the silver to valjean.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{that is right.}
<A>__{amazed, valjean looks up.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{but my friend, you left so early, you forgot i gave these also. would you leave the best behind?}

<D>__{messieurs, release him. for this man has spoken true. i commend you for your duty now god's blessing go with you.}
<A>__{silenced by the bishop's gentle tones, the policemen turn and leave. valjean, utterly bewildered, takes the silver candlesticks.}
