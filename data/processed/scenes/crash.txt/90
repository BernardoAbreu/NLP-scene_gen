<L>__{exterior ballard apt. balcony day}
<A>__{james sits on the balcony of his apartment, watching the sky. a single engined airplane floats above the motorway, a glass dragonfly carried by the sun. it seems to hang motionless, the propeller rotating slowly like a toy aircraft's. the light pours from its wings in a ceaseless fountain. below it, the traffic moves sluggishly along the crowded concrete lanes, the roofs of the vehicles forming a continuous carapace of polished cellulose. suddenly, catherine is behind him. she puts her hands on his shoulders and he turns to her as though in a dream, gestures toward the airplane.}
