<B>__{close shot george enters the bedroom}
<A>__{the room is modestly furnished with just a cheap bed, a chair or two, and a dresser. mary is asleep in the bed. as george comes in, his head is filled with many confusing thoughts, relating to incidents in his past life.}
<C>__{potter's voice}
<D>__{you wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town. buying your wife a lot of fine clothes, going to new york on a business trip a couple of times a year. maybe to europe once in a while.}
<A>__{george takes off his hat and coat, moves over to the dresser and stares at his reflection in the mirror.}
<C>__{george's voice}
<D>__{i know what i'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and next year and the year after that. i'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet, and i'm going to see the world... and i'm going to build things. i'm going to build air fields. i'm going to build skyscrapers a hundred stories high. i'm going to build a bridge a mile long.}
<A>__{while the above thoughts are passing through george's head, his attention is caught by a picture on the wall near the dresser: insert: picture on the wall it is the sketch of george lassoing the moon that we first saw in mary's living room. the lettering reads: "george lassos the moon."}
<C>__{george's voice}
<D>__{what is it you want, mary? you want the moon? if you do, just say the word; i will throw a lasso around it and pull it down for you.}
