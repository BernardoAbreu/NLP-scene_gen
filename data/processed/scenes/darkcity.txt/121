<L>__{into flames. mister black recoils, almost falling off his}
<A>__{chair, taken by surprise. the mystery men all look at white, a murmur of concern. mister black looks up at white angered.}
<C>__{mister black}
<D>__{how dare you use your tricks on me!}
<A>__{white, genuinely surprised, looks around. several mystery men back away from him, scared.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{i didn't realise...}
<C>__{mister black}
<D>__{shut up, freak! monster! you are insignificant.}
<A>__{he glares across the room, angrily. an wooden chair in a corner starts to vibrate. close on mister black's eyes. the chair rises into the air hurls across the room at white. mister black laughs as it crashes into the wall. white ducks just in time. the gathered mystery men erupt into enthusiastic applause. white regains his composure and tries some mind tricks of his own. he lifts a small table into the air, and makes it spin a knife and fork dance back and forth on the surface, as several plates (from a stack in the kitchen) hurl, firstly at the spinning table, then go flying across the room, smashing near mister black, making him dance back and forth comically. this display is accompanied by a rousing rendition of a waltz playing on a floating gramophone white has also activated with his mind. several mystery men are terrified. white is amazed at his own performance.}
<C>__{mister black}
<D>__{you'll regret that.}
<A>__{mister black is furious, spluttering, spit flying from his mouth.}
<C>__{mister black }
<D>__{shut it down!}
<A>__{a mystery man by the window, picks up a phone and dials furiously. everyone in the room remains silent waiting.}
<C>__{man on phone}
<D>__{yes, we have a problem here. shut it down immediately.}
<A>__{white doesn't understand what is going on. o.s. the sound of machinery winding down. angle on a clock hanging on the wall. on the second hand. it suddenly stops. all eyes are on mister black.}
<C>__{mister black}
<D>__{this has all gone too far. yes, much too far.}
<A>__{mister black starts to shake. his eyes shut, clenches his teeth, grips the insect on his cane, plants his feet firmly to the floor. around the room walls crack, plaster rains down from the ceiling...}
