<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{a worn satchel (moving day) is being carried by a world weary middle european wearing a black armband. vladimir nekhorvich exits a gleaming building, pausing for a moment, under a motto clearly visible above his head, 'where the future is now'. he checks the time. insert watch set in countdown mode. it's at 19 hours forty seven minutes and sixteen seconds and dropping, 19:37.15, :14, :13, :12 etc. o.s. children are singing:}
<D>__{ring a ring a rosy a pocketful of posy a tissue a tissue we all fall down.}
<A>__{nekhorvich looks to see children at play outside the adjacent natural history museum. they are moving in and around an odd freeform sculpture. pov sculpture and children a blur where the sculpture seems to be distorting the children, almost like mirrors in a fun house.}
<B>__{nekhorvich}
<A>__{wipes his eyes, a horn honks. he looks toward the sound. moving shot satchel (interior airport security day) on the belt that takes it thru x ray. on the other side a guard opens the satchel and pokes thru a few toilet articles, personal items, books, a battleship gray digital camera and in a small plastic container marked 's.g.' a small, square shiny object, hi tech and at odds with the other items. she pulls out an urn shaped vessel.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{what's this, then?}
<C>__{nekhorvich}
<P>__{(handing her documents)}
<D>__{the ashes of a colleague, i'm taking them to his family. if you wish to open it, please be careful.}
<A>__{computerized screen display (interior plane moving day) on the cabin wall displays a colorful map showing the flight point of departure in sydney, continuously updating distance, direction and time to its ultimate destination, atlanta, georgia.}
<C>__{captain's voice}
<D>__{ folks, we're a little over two and a half hours from touchdown in atlanta, but if you look out your windows on either side of the aircraft, we'll soon be crossing the southern section of the rocky mountains, a range which includes more than 50 peaks rising above 14,000 feet. the chain's loftiest point, mount elbert, at 14, 433 feet should be coming into view as we pass over central colorado shortly..}
<A>__{nekhorvich (interior cabin day) seems intent on the map, its changing times and distance. he checks his watch the countdown has gone from 20 to three hours and 32 minutes as nekhorvich is mesmerized by the descending seconds whipping by. ethan hunt sits into shot on the vacant first class aisle seat beside nekhorvich.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{you keep staring at that watch as if your life depended on it, doctor..}
<C>__{nekhorvich}
<D>__{well, yes. i suppose i am a bit anxious.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{they're ready and waiting. you'll soon be with old friends.}
<C>__{nekhorvich}
<P>__{(meaning ethan)}
<D>__{i'm with an old friend now, dmitri.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{sorry it couldn't be under happier circumstances.}
<C>__{nekhorvich}
<D>__{yes, i'm sorry too.. 'you're sorry and i'm sorry..'}
<P>__{(bemused laughter, then looks at ethan)}
<D>__{ you do know gradski thought the world of you.}
<A>__{nekhorvich is overcome. ethan puts a comforting hand on his shoulder:}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{he was quite a man. did he know before the end you two had succeeded?}
<C>__{nekhorvich}
<D>__{yes, he knew. just..}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{..not in time to save him.}
<C>__{nekhorvich}
<D>__{no. after you've lived with chimera for twenty hours, nothing can save you. not even...bellerophon.}
<A>__{nekhorvich pats the satchel.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{you carry them together? safely?}
<A>__{with an almost impish grin and a wink:}
<C>__{nekhorvich}
<D>__{yes, and you'll get us to a safe place with them, thank god!..left to my own devices, i'm an old fart too inept to read a railroad timetable!..}
<A>__{good natured laughter. cut off by a flight steward who passes by, giving a sidelong silence in ethan and nekhorvich's direction. oxygen masks suddenly deploy from the ceiling. passengers are puzzled and alarmed.}
<C>__{captain's voice}
<D>__{you captain again. we've experienced a slight but abrupt drop in cabin pressure..}
<A>__{a passenger struggling with his mask. as nekhorvich fumbles with the strap on his mask he notes that the display screen shows their altitude is below 30,000 feet and dropping. he checks the countdown time on his watch again. nekhorvich looks around him. the flight attendants are conspicuously absent and all the passengers who have on oxygen masks are passed out.}
