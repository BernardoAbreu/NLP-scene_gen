<D>__{this is going to sound kind of funny to you, but i want to ask it.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{do you think there's any chance, if you do win this big game, that you might do something else besides cards?}
<P>__{(hastily)}
<D>__{i don't mean never play poker. i just mean not have it be the only thing you do.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{hell, it's the only thing i know how to do. what else is there for a guy never finished school? college graduates are walking the streets looking for jobs trained people, engineers, scientists!}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{i realize }
<C>__{kid}

<C>__{christian}
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{no, this is your time now you go on honey and you play the man i will be at mama's.}
<A>__{she closes the suitcase and puts on the one dress she hasn't packed. the kid, dressed now, watches her for a moment then goes to the bottom drawer of the dresser and opens it to reveal a stack of money under a shirt. he takes five clean twenty dollar bills and counts them on to the top of the dresser, snapping the crisp leaves gambler style. then he stoops down again and takes out two more twenties, adding them to the pile.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i wish it could be more.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{that's all right.}
<A>__{he doesn't actually hand her the money. he leaves it on top of the dresser and she goes over and takes it, folding the bills and putting them in her change purse. the kid picks up her suitcase, and she leads the way into the other room. at the front door she stops and looks back at the little apartment for a moment.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{i don't guess i will ever forget these rooms, kid.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i don't guess i will either.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{you going to move?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{if i win, it won't be good enough. if i lose, i lose it all.}
<A>__{she looks at him for a moment, then exits. he follows. (time lapse)}
