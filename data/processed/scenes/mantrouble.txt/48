<L>__{interior andy's house living room night (some time later)}
<A>__{joan and harry are seated on the couch having coffee as they listen to a chopin nocturne. he is doing his best to emulate her posture of thoughtful intensity as she listens, but as he steals a look at her his adult male impulses causes him to shift about slightly. she looks over at him:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{it's not affecting you too much, is it?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no, it's very nice.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{it's chopin, a nocturne.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you know what's affecting me?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{night piece, it means.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you are.}
<A>__{he reaches over and runs his hand slowly down her back.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i think i should say something.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{don't worry about it.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{that's the problem though, i want to be honest with you...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{there's no problem.}
<A>__{he leans over and kisses her. after a moment she breaks off:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{because i recently realized something about myself. that i've slept with a number of men in my life just because i didn't want them not to like me.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(not averse to}
<D>__{being one of}
<P>__{them)}
<D>__{uhm hmm.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{but the thing is, i didn't like most of them that much, so why did i care whether they liked me or not?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you know, i'm not one of these guys who's going to look upon you as an object.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{oh, i know, that's not what i'm saying...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{because i look upon a woman as a whole.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{what i'm saying is i don't know if right now i might not go to bed with you because i don't want to be alone, so i thought maybe we... could try to explore other modes, or...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{other modes?}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{i mean, there are other ways of being intimate, that people don't even realize.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{uhm hmm.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{which doesn't mean i'm not attracted to you.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{but you don't want me to bring you around.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{pardon me?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{other modes is fine. you don't have to be shy with me.}
<P>__{(moving closer to her)}
<D>__{i've been asked to do do every kind of thing in the book.}
<A>__{he kisses her once more. her response, is far less tentative. as it begins to border on the ardent, she breaks off again:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{god, it's so hard to pioneer in this area... when you keep doing that...}
