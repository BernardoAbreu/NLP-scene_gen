<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior dense forest day}
<A>__{cool, clear water. widen to reveal d'artagnan and athos at a shallow pond, watering their horses. the forest around them is dark and primeval.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{do you think we've lost them?}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{they'll catch up eventually.}
<A>__{to the point, as always. d'artagnan pauses to look at their beautiful surroundings, remembers:}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{my father used to hunt in a forest like this. he promised to take me on my tenth birthday. i don't know why he picked that year. something about a boy becoming a man. i'd lay in bed at night and imagine it, just the two of us. but he died before i could go with him.}
<A>__{athos is unmoved, or so it would seem. he replies with quiet cynicism:}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{well. you have your boyhood wish at last. the dark forest. the thrill of the hunt. the nearness of death.}
<A>__{only d'artagnan is the hunted, not the hunter.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i'd be proud to die for my king.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{i just wanted to save you from the life of a musketeer. you don't have to go looking for experience, d'artagnan. it'll find you soon enough. and when it does it will mark you forever.}
<A>__{athos rides into the forest. d'artagnan hurries to follow.}
