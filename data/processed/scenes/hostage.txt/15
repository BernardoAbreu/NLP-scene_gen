<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{get your ass in the chair! sit down!}
<A>__{dennis shoves jennifer to the floor and stalks directly across the room, his gun trained on walter. walter freezes, hands motionless, letting the paper feed into the shredder. strangely, he has little outward reaction }

<D>__{jen? are you all right?}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{she'll be dead if you don't put your ass in that chair!}

<C>__{dennis }
<D>__{kevin! don't stand there, asshole, close the windows! mars, keep him covered, dude!}

<D>__{don't go rambo and you'll tell'm about this on the back nine. i'm gonna tie you up, then we're gonna take your car.}
