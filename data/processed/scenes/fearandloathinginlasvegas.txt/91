<D>__{i'm a whiskey man myself. we don't have much trouble from drugs where i come from...}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{you will. one of these nights you'll wake up and find a junkie tearing your bedroom apart.}
<C>__{da}
<D>__{naw!}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{they'll climb right into your bedroom and sit on your chest with big bowie knives. they might even sit on your wife's chest. put the blade right down on her throat.}
<C>__{da}
<D>__{not down in my parts.}
<A>__{duke joins them.}
<C>__{duke}
<P>__{(to waitress)}
<D>__{rum and ice, please.}
<C>__{da}
<P>__{(looks at duke's name tag)}
<D>__{you're another one of these california boys. your friend here's been tellin' us about dope fiends.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{they're everywhere. nobody's safe. and sure as hell not in the south. they like warm weather... you'd never believe it. in l.a. it's out of control. first it was drugs, now it's witchcraft.}
<C>__{da}
<D>__{witchcraft? shit, you can't mean it!}
<A>__{the bartender cleans his glasses, one ear straining for the conversation.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{read the newspapers.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{man, you don't know trouble until you have to face down a bunch of these addicts gone crazy for human sacrifice!}
<C>__{da}
<D>__{naw! that's science fiction stuff!}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{not where we operate.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{hell, in malibu alone, these goddamn satan worshippers kill six or eight people every day. all they want is the blood. they'll take people right off the street if they have to.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{just the other day we had a case where they grabbed a girl right out of a mcdonald's hamburger stand. she was a waitress, about sixteen years old... with a lot of people watching, too!}
<A>__{the bartender keeps cleaning the same glass more and more furiously.}
<C>__{da}
<D>__{what happened? what did they do to her?}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{do? jesus christ, man. they chopped her goddamn head off right there in the parking lot! then they cut all kinds of holes in her head and sucked out the blood!}
<C>__{da}
<P>__{(da ad libs a summation of the crime)}
<D>__{and nobody did anything?}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{what could they do? the guy that took the head was about six seven, and maybe three hundred pounds. he was packing two lugers, and the others had m 16s.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{they just ran back out into death valley you know, where manson turned up...}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{like big lizards.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{... and every one of them stacked naked...}
<C>__{da}
<D>__{naked!?}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{naked.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{yeh, naked!... except for the weapons.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{they were all veterans.}
<C>__{da}
<D>__{veterans?!!!?}
<A>__{agog with the horrors of the story, the bartender polishes the glass faster and faster...}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{yeh. the big guy used to be a major in the marines.}
<C>__{da}
<D>__{a major!}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{we know where he lives, but we can't get near the house.}
<C>__{da}
<D>__{naw! not a major.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{he wanted the pineal gland.}
<C>__{da}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{that's how he got so big. when he quit the marines he was just a little guy.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{usually, it's whole families. during the night. most of them don't even wake up until they feel their heads going and then, of course, it's too late.}
<A>__{the glass smashes in the bartender's hand.}
<C>__{duke }
<D>__{happens every day.}
<A>__{duke turns to a waitress with a warm smile.}
<C>__{duke }
<D>__{three more rums. plenty of ice. maybe a handful of lime chunks.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{are you guys with the police convention upstairs?}
<C>__{da}
<D>__{we sure are, miss.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{i thought so. i never heard that kind of talk around here before. jesus christ! how do you guys stand that kind of work?}
<C>__{gonzo}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{we like it. it's groovy.}
<A>__{the waitress stares sickened at gonzo.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{what's wrong with you? hell, somebody has to do it.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{hurry up with those drinks. we're thirsty. only two rums. make mine a bloody mary.}
<C>__{da}
<P>__{(whacks his fist on the bar)}
<D>__{hell, i really hate to hear this. because everything that happens in california seems to get down our way, sooner or later. mostly atlanta. but that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. all we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance. they didn't roam around much... but now jesus, it seems nobody's safe.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<P>__{(with a conspiratorial nod)}
<D>__{you're going to need to take the bull by the horns go to the mat with this scum.}
<C>__{da}
<D>__{what do you mean by that?}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{you know what i mean. we've done it before and we can damn well do it again!}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{cut their goddamn heads off. every one of them. that's what we're doing in california.}
<C>__{da}
<P>__{(stupefied)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{sure. it's all on the q.t., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{we keep it quiet. it's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs. not with the press around.}
<C>__{da}
<P>__{(recovering slightly)}
<D>__{hell, no. we'd never hear the goddamn end of it.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{dobermans don't talk.}
<C>__{da}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{they'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs.}
<C>__{da}
<D>__{god almighty!}
<P>__{(muttering in a daze)}
<D>__{i don't think i should tell my wife about this. she'd never understand. you know how women are.}
<A>__{duke gives the da a brotherly slap on the back.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{just be thankful your heart is young and strong.}
<A>__{duke and gonzo leave the stunned da staring into the swirling ice in drink.}
