<A>__{everyone's eyes go wide at the insanity they're witnessing. audrey is the first one in. michael is almost there. but the fire is faster, engulfing him in flame!}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{michael!}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(pulling charlie away from the door)}
<D>__{get back!}
<A>__{bursting out of the flames, michael marches confidently into the diner. jeep slams the door closed just as the wall of}
<B>__{fire reaches them.}
<A>__{everyone hits the deck as the fire shoots through the slats covering the windows like spindly fingers reaching for prey. michael's clothes are a smoky, smoldering mess. jeep and bob rush to pat him down. audrey's coughing from the smoke.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i will get some water!}
<A>__{charlie dashes behind the counter to the sink. she fills up a pitcher of water. she turns away from the sink with the filled pitcher... and screams! the young boy with the lifeless white eyes stands before her wielding an enormous butcher's knife. the pitcher shatters loudly on the floor. the boy swings the knife at her, slicing open the waitress outfit covering her pregnant belly. charlie tumbles back to the ground behind the counter. she frantically pushes herself away from the approaching boy. but she doesn't have far to go before she'll run out of room to maneuver.}
<C>__{young boy}
<D>__{c'mon, don't be scared. i just wanna play with your baby.}
<A>__{that's it. she's backed against the end of the counter! the boy raises the knife to strike. charlie grabs a baking pan off a shelf. swings it out in front of her body like a shield, as the knife is driven down. clang! the knife hits the pan hard and stops. but the boy's hands don't. they slip off the handle and run right down the blade. the knife clatters to the ground. the boy instinctively raises his hands to strike again, but there's no knife. charlie watches in horror as the boy calmly realizes that his thumbs are missing. blood sprays from the stumps. charlie pulls her legs in close then rockets them out at the boy's chest. he's catapulted away from her. michael leaps over the counter, landing in front of charlie, guns ready for action. but the boy is gone.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{are you hurt?}
<A>__{charlie shakes her head no.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{where is he?!}
<A>__{that's when the electricity goes out once again, plunging the}
<B>__{diner back into darkness.}
<C>__{jeep's voice}
<D>__{he's still in here!}
<A>__{flashlight beams fan out across the diner. lighting under chairs. under tables.}
<C>__{bob's voice}
<D>__{where the fuck is he?!}
<A>__{a scampering sound... moving fast. everybody spins to track the location of the sound. as soon as they move in one direction, the scampering is heard in another. jeep's light catches something on the ground. a trail of}
<B>__{blood.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{he's bleeding!}
<A>__{the beams of light join together, moving fast to track the}
<B>__{blood across the diner where it ends at... a wall...}
<A>__{jeep raises his light up the wall where the trail of blood}
<B>__{reaches the ceiling and...stops.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{what the fuck?}
<A>__{screech! the bloody boy springs off a table behind them and lands on bob's back. bob flails around trying to pull the boy's small, but deadly strong arms away from his neck.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{dad!}
<A>__{jeep can't get a clear shot. bob's gasping for air. michael grabs the boy and fiercely rips him off of bob's back. he swings the boy around like a living shot put.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{get ready!}
<A>__{jeep and bob whip up their guns as michael throws the wicked creature into the air. sandra's vacant face flickers in the light as the sound of gunfire and inhuman screaming fill the diner. and then in moments... all is quiet. behind the counter, audrey helps charlie to her feet. she winces. doubles over, clutching her stomach.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{oh, no!}
<A>__{michael lowers his flashlight. clear fluid runs down charlie's legs.}
