<A>__{bourne just manages to punch his car into the right rear of the cri sedan and race down the avenue with paz and the slightly damaged sedan in pursuit. paz gains on him and bourne is forced to swerve violently to deny paz the kill shot he is all too capable of. just ahead of bourne, two government suvs slide into the intersection completely blocking his path. bourne instantly spins his car 180 degrees and continues on, barreling into the roadblock backwards. as bourne's car plows through the suv's he whips the wheel and his car spins through a reverse 180 as paz and the other sedan race through the wreckage in bourne's wake. paz and the cri sedan are all over bourne as he slides a right hand turn onto south st. as paz and the cri sedan overwhelm bourne's battered vehicle.}
