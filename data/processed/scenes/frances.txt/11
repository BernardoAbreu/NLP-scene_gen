<A>__{close on judge hillier in his robes, identified by a nameplate on the bench.}
<C>__{hillier}
<D>__{these are perilous times. with the economic collapse comes hopelessness and desperation; and people turn to dangerous ideas }
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{the camera pulls slowly back. we see that the courtroom is empty.}
<C>__{hillier}
<D>__{those of us who represent law and order must be vigilant. who's behind this, her mother?}
<A>__{now we see who he's talking to: alma styles, the woman who sat with lillian at the school auditorium.}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{impossible. as her attorney, i've known her for years.}
<C>__{hillier}
<D>__{what about the father, he's a little pink. maybe he wants to show our schools in a bad light, shift some support to kaminski and those jackals.}
<C>__{styles}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{he's no influence; he doesn't even live at home. no, i think frances wrote that essay with no mischief intended. it was her teacher who entered it in the competition.}
<C>__{hillier}
<D>__{well, the publicity must stop. it's no good for seattle and no good for the country.}
<P>__{(sternly)}
<D>__{keep an eye on this, will you, alma?}
<C>__{styles}
<D>__{of course, your honor.}
<A>__{he nods with satisfaction. two right thinking people fighting for what they believe in.}
