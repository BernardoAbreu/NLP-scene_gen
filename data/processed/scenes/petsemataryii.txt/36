<L>__{exterior pet sematary day}
<A>__{the woods here have grown long with shadows. the air is still and the sound of birds is conspicuously absent. a wooden archway frames the entrance to the primitive graveyard. scrawled across the weatherstained boards is a child's barely legible attempt at "pet sematary." geoff trepidatiously enters the clearing of crude, crowded graves. collars, leashes, bird cages and other accessories adorn the makeshift crosses and headstones. geoff moves along the outer circle of markers, each crafted by a child's caring hands. as he searches, he can't help but notice the heartfelt epitaphs. on the outer circle, he sees a crate board marker memorializing:}
<B>__{smucky the cat... he was obediant.}
<A>__{moving inward, the markers are older. the ones he can still read convey a sense of the perpetual cycle of life and death. here is a wide, flat, upright board planted deep in the earth: "in memory of marta our pet rabit dyed march 1 1965." the next three rows are illegible, the inscriptions are weathered beyond recognition... and then, chiseled into sandstone: hannah the best dog that ever lived 1929 1939. and now... "meow." fainterior but very much alive. geoff picks up his pace, weaving quickly toward the center. there, he finds tiger. trapped in a rusted old birdcage, its base swallowed by the grave. geoff opens the door and frees tiger, stroking the trembling kitten. geoff's eyes are drawn to the far perimeter... to the deadfall... the deadfall looms on the outskirts of the clearing like a pile of skeletal remains. an abstract stairway to things beyond. a wind picks up just then, sending leaves skittering in waves across the ground.}
