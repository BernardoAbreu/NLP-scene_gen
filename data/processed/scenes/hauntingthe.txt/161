<A>__{they stop there, staring into the shadows.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{nell?}
<A>__{and there, hunched over something turning a creaking crank of some sort, is nell.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{nell.}
<A>__{nell straightens from whatever it is she was doing and turns to them. theo steps toward her, afraid for her.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{what'd you come back for, babe?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{just had to be sure.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{come on, jesus! let's go!}
<A>__{marrow shuts him up with a vicious gesture, stays back himself as theo approaches nell.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{let's go, hon. don't you want to go back to your little apartment where you can hear the buoy out in the harbor when the wind is just right?}
<A>__{nell smiles at theo. she's holding something.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{oh, theo. you know i don't have an apartment.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{then let's go get you one.}
<A>__{nell's smile softens even more. her voice is reassuring.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{don't worry about me, theo. i'm wanted. right here. i'm home.}
<A>__{a chill of fear cuts through theo as nell looks deep into her eyes.}
<C>__{nell }
<D>__{after all...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm family.}
<A>__{the thing in nell's hand is a needle, the thing she's been cranking an ancient phonograph. she lowers the needle to the spinning record. and her tune, the one she hums all the time, begins to play. the others are frozen where they stand. marrow's mind reels at the implications of what he's hearing.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{my mother used to hum this to me. like her mother hummed it to her. and my great grandmother carolyn hummed it to her.}
<A>__{nell turns back. the others stand there speechless.}
<C>__{nell }
<D>__{i have to stay. you better go. i could explain it, but you'd never understand.}
<A>__{and that, finally, galvanizes the others into action. marrow sweeps past theo, grabs nell hard, and swings her for the door.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{come on.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{no }
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{please, nell, just see us out.}
<A>__{luke closes in on nell with marrow, and there's nothing she can do but let herself be pulled along.}
