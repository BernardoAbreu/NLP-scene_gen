<L>__{interior dan's car night}
<A>__{dan pulls his car up in front of roberta's house. beside him, roberta holds a program from a lincoln center concert. roberta's tense, but dan seems relaxed and centered in his attraction to her.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i had a lot of fun tonight.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{yeah, i did too.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{i have a confession i've never answered an ad before. i did it on a dare.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{well, i have a confession my boys placed the ad behind my back.}
<A>__{they both laugh, then smile at each other. an awkward beat: will he or won't he? dan leans in to kiss her, and roberta turns away, uncertain.}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{look, dan i went along with this 'cause it's been a while. quite a while... and i had a very nice time... but i'm not sure if i'm ready to get involved with anyone right now.}
<A>__{a beat. roberta feels badly about rejecting him.}
<C>__{dan}
<P>__{(deadpan)}
<D>__{does this mean i don't get any lasagna?}
<A>__{roberta cracks up. dan smiles at her.}
