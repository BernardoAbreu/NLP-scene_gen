<L>__{interior coral lounge}
<A>__{the decor is sort of polynesian. goofy tropical motif murals on the walls. the place has a mixed bag of customers, including upwardly mobile low lifes who have graduated from the streets and use it as a kind of office. it is a crossroads for druggies, upscale hookers, junior entertainment suits slumming after a day in the pressure cooker. lenny cruises through like he owns the place, greeting a number of the early regulars. we get the impression he knows everybody, all the time, everywhere he goes. he leans on the bar.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{hey, lenny.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{anything without an umbrella.}
<A>__{he gets backslapped by a guy in a satin racing jacket: fabrizio.}
<C>__{fabrizio}
<D>__{lenny my man, i think you want to meet a friend of mine.}
<A>__{lenny follows fabrizio's look to a guy, dressed la power casual, sitting at a booth across the room.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{looks like money to me.}
<A>__{lenny grabs his drink off the bar and follows fabrizio across the room.}
<C>__{fabrizio}
<D>__{don't forget your friends.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{10 percent, fabri, like always.}
<A>__{they slide into the booth with keith.}
<C>__{fabri}
<D>__{keith, this is lenny. guy i was telling you about. he can get you anything you }
<C>__{lenny}
<P>__{(cutting him off)}
<D>__{just a second. not to be rude, keith, but i got to ask, are you a cop?}
<C>__{keith}
<D>__{i understand. no, i'm not.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{you understand? attorney! right? am i right?}
<C>__{keith}
<D>__{that's right.}
<A>__{lenny sizes the guy up, looks around the edge of the table.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{tassel shoes. entertainment law, would be my guess.}
<P>__{(off the guy's scowl)}
<D>__{relax. i just like to guess, is all. it's my job to know people and what they want... what's behind their eyes.}
<C>__{fabrizio}
<D>__{lenny gives people their heart's desire. ain't that right, lenny?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{that's right. my second question i gotta ask, so we get our bearings here... have you ever jacket in? have you ever wiretripped?}
<C>__{keith}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lenny}
<P>__{(a winning grin)}
<D>__{a virgin brain! well we're going to start you off right. so what do you know about this? save us some time...}
<C>__{keith}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{just what i've read. that the technology was developed for the feds, to replace the body wire. and now it's gone black market. so, uh, do i get the deck from you?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{i will set you up, get you a deck at my cost... since my thing is the software.}
<C>__{keith}
<D>__{clips.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{that's right. clips.}
<P>__{(lenny leans in, working the guy)}
<D>__{look, i want you to know what we're talking about here. this isn't like tv only better. this is life. it's a piece of somebody's life. pure and uncut, straight from the cerebral cortex. you're there. you're doing it, seeing it, hearing it... feeling it.}
<C>__{keith}
<D>__{what kind of things exactly?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{exactly anything. whatever you want. whoever you want to be.}
<P>__{(handing fabrizio a twenty)}
<D>__{fabri, get us another round, would you.}
<A>__{fabrizio gets the hint and heads for the bar.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{you want to go skiing without leaving your den, you can. but i'm assuming a guy like you, you wanna go skiing you fly to aspen. that's not what you're interested in here. it's about the stuff you can't have... right? the forbidden fruit.}
<A>__{keith nods, mesmerized by lenny.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{like running into a liquor store with a .357 magnum in your hand, feeling the adrenalin pumping through your veins. or...}
<P>__{(pointing discreetly)}
<D>__{... see that guy, with the drop dead philipino girl friend?}
<P>__{(keith looks)}
<D>__{wouldn't you like to be that guy for twenty minutes? the right twenty minutes. i can make it happen. and you won't even tarnish your wedding ring.}
<A>__{keith touches his ring self consciously, then grins.}
<C>__{keith}
<P>__{(hooked like a carp)}
<D>__{sounds good.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{i can get you what you want. you just have to talk to me. i'm your priest, your shrink, your main connection to the switchboard of souls. i'm the magic man, the santa claus of the subconscious. you say it, you even think it, you can have it. you want a girl, you want two girls? i don't know what your thing is or what you're curious about... you want a guy? you want to be a girl... see what that feels like? you want a nun to tie you up? it's all doable.}
<C>__{keith}
<P>__{(flushed, sweating, ready)}
<D>__{talk to me about costs, here.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{listen, before we get into numbers, i want you to try a taste. i got a deck with me.}
<C>__{keith}
<D>__{what? right here?}
<C>__{lenny}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{step into my office.}
