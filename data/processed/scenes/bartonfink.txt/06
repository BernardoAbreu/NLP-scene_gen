<A>__{a typewriter whirring at high speed. the keys strike too quickly for us to make out the words.}
<B>__{slow track in}
<A>__{on barton, sitting on a couch in an office anteroom, staring blankly. distant phones ring. barton's eyes are tired and bloodshot.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{a gargoyle secretary sits typing a document. the office door opens in the background and a short middle aged man in a dark suit emerges. to his secretary:}
<C>__{executive}
<D>__{i'm eating on the lot today}
<A>__{he notices barton.}
<C>__{executive}
<D>__{...who's he?}
<A>__{the secretary looks over from her typing to consult a slip of paper on her desk.}
<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{barton fink, mr. geisler.}

<D>__{more please.}

<D>__{think about it, fink. writers come and go; we always need indians.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{i'm a writer. ted okum said you're producing this wallace beery picture i'm working on.}
<C>__{geisler}
<D>__{what!? ted okum doesn't know shit. they've assigned me enough pictures for a goddamn year. what ted okum doesn't know you could almost squeeze into the hollywood bowl.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{then who should i talk to?}
<A>__{geisler gives a hostile stare. without looking at her, he addresses the secretary:}
<C>__{geisler}
<D>__{get me lou breeze.}
<A>__{he perches on the edge of the desk, an open hand out toward the secretary, as he glares wordlessly at barton. after a moment:}
<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{is he in for mr. geisler?}
<A>__{she puts the phone in geisler's hand.}
<C>__{geisler}
<D>__{lou? how's lipnik's ass smell this morning?... yeah?... yeah?... okay, the reason i'm calling, i got a writer here, fink, all screwy. says i'm producing that wallace beery wrestling picture what'm i, the goddamn janitor around here?... yeah, well who'd you get that from?... yeah, well tell lipnik he can kiss my dimpled ass... shit! no, alright... no, no, all right.}
<A>__{without looking he reaches the phone back. the secretary takes it and cradles it.}
<C>__{geisler}
<D>__{...okay kid, let's chow.}
<B>__{commissary}
<A>__{barton and geisler sit eating in a semicircular booth. geisler speaks through a mouthful of food:}
<C>__{geisler}
<D>__{don't worry about it. it's just a b picture. i bring it in on budget, they'll book it without even screening it. life is too short.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{but lipnik said he wanted to look at the script, see something by the end of the week.}
<C>__{geisler}
<D>__{sure he did. and he forgot about it before your ass left his sofa.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{okay. i'm just having trouble getting started. it's funny, i'm blocked up. i feel like i need some kind of indication of... what's expected}
<C>__{geisler}
<D>__{wallace beery. wrestling picture. what do you need, a road map?}
<A>__{geisler chews on his cottage cheese and stares at barton.}
<C>__{geisler}
<D>__{...look, you're confused? you need guidance? talk to another writer.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{who?}
<A>__{geisler rises and throws his napkin onto his plate.}
<C>__{geisler}
<D>__{jesus, throw a rock in here, you'll hit one. and do me a favor, fink: throw it hard.}
<A>__{commissary men's room barton stands at a urinal. he stares at the wall in front of him as he pees. after a moment, he cocks his head, listening. we hear a throat clearing, as if by a tenor preparing for a difficult passage. it is followed by the gurgling ruch of vomit. barton buttons his pants and turns to face the stalls. there is more businesslike throat clearing. barton stoops.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{we boom down to show the blue serge pants and well polished shoes of the stall's kneeling occupant. a white handkerchief has been spread on the floor to protect the trouser knees. the toilet flushes. the man rises, picks up his handkerchief up off the floor and gives it a smart flap.}
<B>__{barton}
<A>__{he quickly straightens and goes to the sink. he starts washing his hands. we hear the stall door being unlatched. barton glances over his shoulder.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{the stall door opening.}
<B>__{barton}
<A>__{quickly, self consciously, he looks back down at his hands.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{his hands writhing under the running water. we hear footsteps approaching.}
<B>__{barton}
<A>__{forcing himself to look at his hands. we hear the man reach the adjacent sink and turn on the tap. barton can't help glancing up.}
<B>__{the man}
<A>__{a dapper little man in a neat blue serge suit. he has warm brown eyes, a patrician nose, and a salt and pepper mustache. he smiles pleasantly at barton.}
<B>__{barton}
<A>__{he gives a nervous smile more like a tic and looks back down at his hands. we hear the man gargling water and spitting into the sink. after a moment, barton looks up again.}
<B>__{the man}
<A>__{reacting to barton's look as he washes his hands. this time, a curt nod accompanies his pleasant smile.}
<B>__{barton}
<A>__{looks back down, then up again.}
<B>__{the man}
<A>__{extends a dripping hand.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{bill mayhew. sorry about the odor.}
<A>__{his speech is softly accented, from the south.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{barton fink.}
<A>__{they shake, then return to their ablutions. we hold on barton as we hear mayhew's faucet being turned off and his foot steps receding. for some reason, barton's eyes are widening.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{...jesus. w.p.!}
<A>__{the dapper little man stops and turns.}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{i beg your pardon?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{w.p. mayhew? the writer?}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{just bill, please.}
<A>__{barton stands with his back to the sink, facing the little man, his hands dripping onto the floor. there is a short pause. barton is strangely agitated, his voice halting but urgent.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{bill!...}
<A>__{mayhew cocks his head with a politely patient smile. finally barton brings out:}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{...you're the finest novelist of our time.}
<A>__{mayhew leans against a stall.}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{why thank you, son, how kind. bein' occupied here in the worship of mammon, i haven't had the chance yet to see your play}
<A>__{he smiles at barton's surprise.}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{...yes, mistuh fink, some of the news reaches us in hollywood.}
<A>__{he is taking out a flask and unscrewing its lid.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{sir, i'm flattered that you even recognize my name. my god, i had no idea you were in hollywood.}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{all of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the great salt lick. mebbe that's why i allus have such a powerful thrust.}
<A>__{he clears his throat, takes a swig from the flask, and waves it at barton.}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{...a little social lubricant, mistuh fink?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{it's still a little early for me.}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{so be it.}
<A>__{he knocks back some more.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{...bill, if i'm imposing you should say so, i know you're very busy i just, uh... i just wonder if i could ask you a favor... that is to say, uh... have you ever written a wrestling picture?}
<A>__{mayhew eyes him appraisingly, and at length clears his throat.}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{...you are drippin', suh.}
<A>__{barton looks down at his hands, then pulls a rough brown paper towel from a dispenser. mayhew sighs:}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{...mistuh fink, they have not invented a genre of picture that bill mayhew has not, at one time or othuh, been invited to essay. i have taken my stabs at the wrastlin' form, as i have stabbed at so many others, and with as little success. i gather that you are a fresh man here, eager for an upperclassman's council. however, just at the moment...}
<A>__{he waves his flask.}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{...i have drinkin' to do. why don't you stop at my bungalow, which is numbah fifteen, later on this afternoon...}
<A>__{he turns to leave.}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{...and we will discuss wrastlin' scenarios and other things lit'rary.}
<A>__{the number "15" we are close on brass numerals tacked up on a white door. muted, from inside, we hear mayhew's voice enraged, bellowing. we hear things breaking. softer, we hear a woman's voice, its tone placating.}
<B>__{reverse tracking slowly in}
<A>__{on barton, standing in front of the door. the noise abates for a moment. we hear the woman's voice again. barton hesitates, listening; he thinks, decides, knocks. with this the woman's voice stops, and mayhew starts wailing again. the door cracks open. the woman looks as if she has been crying.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{...can i help you?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i... my name is fink... uh, bill asked me to drop by this afternoon. is he in?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{mr. mayhew is indisposed at the moment}
<A>__{from inside, we hear mayhew's wail.}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{honey!! where's m'honey!!}
<A>__{the woman glances uncomfortably over her shoulder and steps outside, closing the door behind her.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{mr. fink, i'm audrey taylor, mr. mayhew's personal secretary. i know this all must sound horrid. i really do apologize...}
<A>__{through the door mayhew is still wailing piteously.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{is, uh... is he okay?}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{he will be... when he can't write, he drinks.}
<C>__{mayhew}
<D>__{where are you, dammit! where's m'honey!!}
<A>__{she brushes a wisp of hair out of her eyes.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{i am sorry, it's so embarassing.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{how about you? will you be alright?}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{i will be fine... are you a writer, mr fink?}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{yes i am. i'm working on a wres please call me barton.}
<A>__{audrey reaches out and touches barton's hand.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{i will tell bill you dropped by. i'm sure he'll want to reschedule your appointment.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{perhaps you and i could get together at some point also. i'm sorry if that sounds abrupt. i just... i don't know anyone here in this town.}
<A>__{audrey smiles at him.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{perhaps the three of us, mr. fink.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{please, barton.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{barton. you see, barton, i'm not just bill's secretary bill and i are... i love. we }
<C>__{mayhew's voice}
<D>__{m'honey!! where's m'honey!!}
<A>__{audrey glances back as we hear the sound of shattering dishes and heavy footsteps.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{...i know this must look... funny.}
<C>__{barton}
<D>__{no, no}
<A>__{hurriedly:}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{we need each other. we give each other... the things we need}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{m'honey!!... bastard ass sons of bitches... the water's lappin' up... m'honey!!}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{i'm sorry, mr. fink. please don't judge us. please...}
<A>__{flustered, she backs away and closes the door.}
<B>__{close on a small wrapped package}
<A>__{hand printed on the package is the message: "hope these will turn the trick, mr. fink. chet!" the wrapping is torn away and the small box is opened. two thumbtacks are taken out. barton's hotel room late at night. the swath of wallpaper behind the bed has sagged away from the wall again, and has been joined by the swath next to it. barton enters frame and steps up onto the bed. he smooths up the first swath and pushes in a thumbtack near the top.}
