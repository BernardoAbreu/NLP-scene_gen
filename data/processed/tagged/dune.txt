<A>__{inside the emperor's chamber, the tank suited guildsmen are arranging themselves in a "v" formation around the box. suddenly the box opens, slowly and beautifully revealing a huge, thick glass tank. inside the tank floats a third stage navigator twenty feet long, much like a cross between a pasty, pale human being and a fleshy grasshopper. the tank is filled with swirling orange spice gas, and guildsmen continuously vacuum up the toxic chemical spills dripping from under the tank. suddenly the guild navigator swims towards the emperor. his head is enormous and fleshy, like a huge grasshopper head the eyes are totally deep blue. his voice is a high, fleshy whispering and an intricate electrical apparatus in the front of the tank translates into english and broadcasts it into the room.}
<C>__{navigator}
<D>__{we have just folded space from ix...}
<C>__{emperor}
<P>__{(extremely nervous)}

<C>__{navigator}
<D>__{i see two great houses house atreides, house harkonnen feuding... i see you behind it.}
<C>__{emperor}

<C>__{navigator}
<D>__{you must share with us.}
<A>__{ }
<C>__{emperor}
<D>__{the atreides house is building a secret army!... using a technique unknown to us... a technique involving sound. the duke is becoming more popular in the landsraad... he could threaten me.... i have ordered house atreides to occupy arrakis to mine the spice... thus replacing their enemies the harkonnens.... house atreides will not refuse because of the tremendous power they think they will gain. then, at an appointed time baron harkonnen will return to arrakis and launch a sneak attack on house atreides... i have promised the baron five legions of my sardaukar terror troops.}

<C>__{emperor}
<D>__{can you hear me?... if this visit has anything to do with spice...}
<A>__{ the guild navigator shudders and swishes quite violently in his tank.}
<C>__{navigator}
<D>__{listen to me!! the spice must flow... the spice has given me accelerated evolution for four thousand years... it has enabled you to live two hundred years... the spice helps make the sapho juice, which gives the red lipped mentats the ability to be living computers... the secret side of spice... the water of life.}

<D>__{i know, thufir, i'm sitting with my back to the door.}
<A>__{hawat suppresses a smile.}

<D>__{not sorry enough.}
<A>__{gurney draws his knife.}
<L>__{25b. shield effect the fight}
<A>__{gurney activates his body shield, sending a shimmering force field around his body. he advances swiftly toward paul. paul snaps on his force field, draws his knife and jumps back, collecting himself hurriedly for the fight.}
<C>__{gurney}
<P>__{(his voice sounding strange through the forcefield)}
<D>__{guard yourself for true!}
<A>__{gurney leaps high, then forward, pressing a furious attack. paul falls back. the shield edges crack loudly as they touch each other.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(inner voice)}
<D>__{what's gotten into gurney? he's not faking.}
<A>__{paul presses forward and the fight moves quickly around the room. the smell of ozone grows stronger as the shields hit and spark off one another. paul directs a parry downwards, turns, and leads gurney against the table, plunging at just the right moment to pin gurney against the table top with his blade right at gurney's neck.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(strange shielded voice)}
<D>__{is this what you seek?}
<C>__{gurney}
<P>__{(strange shielded voice)}
<D>__{good... the slow blade penetrates the shield... but look down.}
<A>__{paul looks and sees gurney's blade at his groin.}
<C>__{gurney }
<D>__{we'd have joined each other in death. however, you did seem to finally get the "mood".}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{would you really have drawn my blood?}
<C>__{gurney}
<D>__{if you'd fought one whit below your abilities i'd have scratched you a good one.}
<A>__{paul stands and snaps off his shield as does gurney.}
<L>__{25. back to scene}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{things have been so serious here lately.}
<C>__{gurney}
<D>__{yes. i sensed the play in you lad, but this can no longer be play. tomorrow we leave for arrakis! arrakis is real. the harkonnens are real.}
<A>__{thufir, yueh, gurney and paul stare at each other for a moment in silence. dr. yueh moves forward and begins to take paul's pulse rate and to collect other data with a small black machine.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{dr. yueh, do you have any information on the worms of arrakis?}
<A>__{ }
<C>__{dr. yueh}
<D>__{i have obtained a filmbook on a small specimen... only 125 meters long.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{only?!}
<A>__{they smile at each other.}
<C>__{dr. yueh}
<D>__{there are have been documented sightings of worms as large as 450 meters in the deep desert far from where we'll be in arakeen.... the desert belt and the south polar regions are marked forbidden.... why?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{the storms and the worms. is it true, that the sand can blow at seven hundred kilometers per hour?}
<C>__{yueh}
<D>__{it can render flesh to dust in minutes. and these dry winds can generate tremendous static electricity in the atmosphere. our body shields won't have enough power to operate in the open air on arrakis.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{well, how do the fremen survive there?}
<C>__{yueh}
<D>__{we don't know much about the fremen... they live in the deep desert... some of them in the cities and they have blue within blue eyes...}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{the eyes yes, yes... saturation of the blood by the spice melange. could the spice affect us in other ways?}
<C>__{thufir}
<D>__{many dangers exist on arrakis. for one, we know the harkonnens would not have given up their choam company contract so easily.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{the harkonnens are our enemies, yes... but behind them, i suspect, is the emperor.}
<A>__{ }
<C>__{thufir}
<D>__{you will make a formidable duke!}
<A>__{paul bows.}
<C>__{thufir }
<D>__{now remember... the first step in avoiding a trap is knowing of its existence.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i know. but if it is a trap then why are we going?}
<C>__{thufir}
<D>__{we have our new army.}
<P>__{(in the same breath)}
<D>__{dr. yueh, put the weirding module on him.}
<A>__{thufir, noticing a squad of guards at the other end of the training room, calls out to them.}
<C>__{thufir }

<L>__{25c. robot fight}
<A>__{suddenly a fighter robot lowers from the ceiling. as the robot begins to rotate and go through several frightening, complicated movements, dr. yueh places a plastic device around paul's neck. he tightens it around the adam's apple above paul's voice box. paul turns and emits a very strange, powerful sound through the weirding module as he rushes towards the robot.}

<A>__{feyd smiles. he lashes out biting paul's hand. feyd laughs in triumph. feyd leaps forward jabbing, his right hip also forward. yet paul, although a little slowly, again reels away. again, feyd thrusts. this time paul jabs with his crysknife, but feyd moves away effortlessly. feyd counters and kicks paul to the ground.}

<D>__{who is the little one? a pet, perhaps? will she deserve my special attentions?}
<A>__{paul jabs out, his crysknife slashing. feyd grabs his arm, and paul his, the two men locked in a straining clinch. feyd presses his right hip closer and closer to paul's body. paul strains to keep it away. suddenly, the gom jabbar flips out of feyd's girdle, but on the left side, and he lunges powerfully with it at paul, who just barely misses taking it in his skin. he throws feyd back, but not before feyd's feet strike out, sending paul to the floor. feyd leaps onto him.}

<D>__{you see... your death... my blade will finish you.}
<A>__{suddenly, paul, with lightning swiftness, pushes feyd up and over. he is on top of him in a flash. paul's crysknife flashes up, thrusting upward through feyd's jaw. feyd's mouth opens as the knife continues up through his tongue and through to his brain. feyd's eyes go wild, then glaze over as he jerks dead on the floor. paul slowly gets to his feet, breathing heavily. anger still seething in him, paul issues a sound a loud, horrible, powerful sound, and feyd's internal organs rupture and the stone floor under him cracks open. the fedaykin smile.}
<D>__{fedaykin #2 usul no longer needs the weirding module.}

<A>__{paul opens his mouth and issues an ever increasing wind. lightning and thunder begin. clouds begin to form over the palace. in the half light of dusk, thousands of fremen watch the sky. giant golden lights are illuminated and their rays shoot far into the sky illuminating the growing clouds. five tremendous bolts of lightning suddenly unleash a downpour of rain on arrakis. the fremen stand awestruck as they are drenched with water falling from the sky.}
<L>__{285. interior great hall arrakeen palace day}
<A>__{we move through paul's glowing blue eyes into beautiful blue luminescent light. a gigantic wind arises, and suddenly appearing in the blue light is an ocean of light rolling like gold glass off into infinite. the blue becomes darker and a golden lotus flower blooms in the night.}
