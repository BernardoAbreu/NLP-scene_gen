<L>__{exterior sidelines day}
<A>__{redskin quarterback eddie martel is conferring with redskin head coach bud tildon near the bench. madden and summerall continue over.}
<C>__{madden }
<D>__{take it all in, people. this could be it for 2,000.}
<A>__{we move to veteran redskin center reese evans, 38, standing on the sidelines, uniform totally clean. he looks near tears.}
<C>__{summerall}
<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{once again, if you haven't heard, it was announced during halftime that the n.f.l. players association will hold a press conference immediately following this game that would make it about five o'clock eastern time and it is expected that the players' union will announce a strike effective immediately.}
<B>__{on redskinettes}
<A>__{twelve striking looking women dressed in burgundy and gold are doing some inane chatter to a section of fans that ignore them. the girls are led by pretty annabelle farrell, a bundle of manic energy inside a body from heaven.}
<C>__{madden }
<D>__{it's all about money, folks. more money, of course and ain't it always? the shame of it is the big losers are you out there, the fans.}
<B>__{on martel}
<A>__{the redskin quarterback moves to the huddle.}
<C>__{summerall}
<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{here we go: third down, eight seconds to play, ball on the dolphins' thirty three yard line. skins down by a touchdown.}
<A>__{the huddle breaks and martel sets up over the center.}
<C>__{martel}
<D>__{green 48! green 48! hut! hut!}
<A>__{the ball is snapped and martel drops back. he looks for a receiver and doesn't see anybody. he steps up in the pocket, sees an opening and takes off running down field.}
<C>__{madden }
<D>__{there goes martel!}
<A>__{martel is a pretty good broken field runner for a big guy. plus with the defense covering every possible receiver, he's got a lot of daylight. nobody has touched him as he crosses the fifteen. suddenly, a safety, smaller than martel, looms in front of him at the ten. martel goes down in one of those wimpy quarterback slides before the safety can even hit him. bang! the gun sounds and the game is over.}
<B>__{on madden and summerall}
<A>__{they look at each other in disbelief}
<C>__{summerall}
<D>__{well... martel goes down ten yards short of a score.}
<C>__{madden}
<D>__{on maybe the last play of the season.}
<C>__{summerall}
<D>__{i think he might have slipped.}
<C>__{madden}
<D>__{yeah, there's a lot of that going around.}
<B>__{on three redskin fans}
<A>__{we'll see these guys throughout. they're typical low level washington bureaucrats named todd, rod and bob who live for the hogs the traditional name for the redskin offensive linemen. todd is shirtless and his entire upper body is painted redskin red. at that moment, they are livid with their quarterback and bob is speaking for them all.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{we're coming to your house tonight, and we're gonna fucking kill you! and if you got a dog, we're gonna kill your fucking dog too!}
<B>__{on annabelle}
<A>__{behind her, the rest of the cheerleaders are already walking away. annabelle looks at quarterback martel with pure disgust as he walks off the field.}
