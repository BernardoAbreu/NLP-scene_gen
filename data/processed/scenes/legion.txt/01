<L>__{exterior an alley way late night}
<A>__{a dark figure in a tattered trench coat tumbles onto the pavement, hands out to slow the impact. a beat then slowly he climbs to his feet, recovering from what seems to have been quite a fall. he has chiseled features, shaved head, deep set eyes. looks like he's been through one hell of a fight. his name, we will come to know, is michael. he quickly checks out his surroundings, nothing but brick walls above him. where'd this guy jump from? a rumble of thunder...then rain starts to hammer down. seems to motivate him. michael pulls his overcoat tight around his body and dashes toward the mouth of the alley. he reaches the street just in time to see a fleet of police cars tearing around the corner, sirens wailing, heading this way. he reels back into the alley way, ducks down behind a trash dumpster, as the blue and red lights of the police cars whip past. michael waits for the lights to disappear, then he pulls a massive ornate knife from his jacket. considers it grimly. runs his finger along its edge. blood beads up. razor sharp. michael begins to peel off his overcoat, revealing his bare chest underneath...and skin literally covered with dark tatoos. hard to see what they are in this light. as his coat falls to the ground, we drift over to the brick wall behind him where we see michael's shadow crouch over, and then... ...two large shapes unfold from his back, stretching up into}
<B>__{what are unmistakably...the shadow of wings.}
<A>__{the rain pounds harder, as if punishment from the heavens. the glint of the knife coming down fast.}
<B>__{a horrendous sound of flesh tearing away from bone... ...the bloody knife clattering to the pavement...}
<A>__{...followed by michael's ungodly scream rising up from the alley way. and then silence... close on the gutter, as blood begins to flow freely, mixing,}
<B>__{swirling with the rain...}
