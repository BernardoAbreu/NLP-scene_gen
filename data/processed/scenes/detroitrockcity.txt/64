<A>__{hawk starts the engine and takes off. trip pulls a baggie of weed and some rolling papers out.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{hey, look, it's that girl.}
<A>__{jam points out at the road ahead to christine. she's a few hundred feet away walking sadly in the breakdown lane.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{that's no girl. that's a stella.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{stella or no stella, we should pull over and help her out.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{oh no, jam. i'm not falling for that twice.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{well, couldn't you slow down so i can at least state my case, hawk? if you don't like it, you can speed up and i will never mention it again.}
<A>__{hawk slows down, turning into the breakdown lane, travelling about two miles per hour. christine doesn't notice as they edge closer to her.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{what is it with you, jam? you got a thing for that... thing?}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{she's a teenage girl walking on the side of the highway. they make very scary movies that start out like that.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{well, they may not make movies about four dudes going to a kiss concert. but if they ever did, the four dudes most certainly would not stop and pick up a stranded disco bunny.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{trip}
<D>__{unless there was gonna be a scene where the disco bunny blows the four dudes on the way to the show.}
