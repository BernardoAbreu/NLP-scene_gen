<L>__{exterior farmer's market day}
<A>__{the farmer's market is crowded with people. we hear the sounds of a bluegrass band playing somewhere nearby. zoe spies the little goat sign. but stan is not there. she looks around the neighboring stalls for him, but no luck.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{oh, well.}
<A>__{she walks towards 14th street. we see the bluegrass band on the steps by the subway station. it's not a big band, just a few guys with an open banjo case and a sign that reads, "the organics." the country twang of the music is in sharp contrast with the tall buildings all around. as she gets closer, she notices that stan is in the band. he's playing banjo. zoe quickly ducks into the nearest food stall, olivia's berries. olivia, mid twenties, natural beauty, approaches.}
<C>__{olivia}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<C>__{zoe}
<P>__{(distracted)}
<D>__{no, i'm fine.}
<A>__{zoe watches stan. she mindlessly starts eating some blueberries out of the display pinterior olivia sees that zoe is looking at stan.}
<C>__{olivia}
<D>__{tasty, huh?}
<A>__{zoe nods and takes another berry.}
<C>__{olivia }
<D>__{all ripe and juicy. and firm, too. bet you could just eat him up in one bite, right?}
<A>__{zoe now turns, confused.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{olivia}
<D>__{and don't look now, but he's coming this way.}
<A>__{olivia winks and moves off. zoe turns back and is now face to face with stan, who's smiling from ear to ear, his banjo slung over his shoulder.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{a ha! i didn't scare you away after all.}
<C>__{zoe}
<P>__{(trying to be casual)}
<D>__{i was just in the neighborhood. i thought i'd come by and get some blueberries. i'm going to make a pie.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{i love blueberry pie.}
<A>__{stan takes two pints of blueberries and hands them to zoe.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i'm confused. i thought you made cheese or something.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{what makes you think i don't?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i don't know, you're over there playing the banjo.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{can't someone do both?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{honestly, i didn't know anyone did either.}
<A>__{olivia returns.}
<C>__{olivia}
<D>__{aren't you going to introduce me to your new friend?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{nope.}
<P>__{(to zoe)}
<D>__{come on. let me show you around.}
<A>__{stan puts his arm around zoe and leads her away. olivia watches them go with her arms crossed.}
