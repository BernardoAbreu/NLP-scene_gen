<D>__{portion of her right}
<P>__{ribcage)}
<D>__{ally, i have a pain right here that has nothing to do with my head. my dad died of heart disease, and if that asshole taught me anything, it's better to be paranoid than dead.}
<A>__{a female police officer, a prim and proper plain jane 5'5" woman in her early twenties, exits the building and walks over to talk with the two male police officers.}
<C>__{heather }

<A>__{heather starts the ambulance and starts to pull out of the lot.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{i'm just afraid its gonna be the whole thing all over again with derek, and then i've got to find some other asshole, and do it all again. i'm sick of the whole cycle.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{so do something different.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{i'm trying, but he's fucking it all up.}
<A>__{as they pull out of the lot, the two male police officers head toward their police cars and the female police officer heads back inside the station.}
