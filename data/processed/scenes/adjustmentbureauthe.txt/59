<L>__{interior rsr office floor morning}
<A>__{david sprints toward the door he came in. it closes as he gets there. he grabs it. it's locked. he sprints away into an internal hallway. richardson emerges from a door in the middle of the hallway. david jumps a mile. it's physically impossible that richardson could have gotten there that fast.}
<C>__{richardson}
<D>__{you can't get away, david.}
<A>__{david spins and rushes back into the main office, then down an internal staircase to the floor below. jumps the last five steps and hits the floor hard. as he comes up he runs smack into another rsr employee who is frozen solid. david curses, then dives around the frozen employee to find richardson, coming out of another office. down the hall. again, physically impossible for him to get there that fast david spins and a distorted wide angle shot of a chloroform rag shoved right at us. focus goes in and out... from david's pov, blurry focus as he's carried toward one of the large corner offices on the 40th floor. the nameplate reads "steve kincaid." richardson opens the door and ushers his men, carrying david, inside except when they walk through the door they're not in an office 40 floors above lower manhattan,: they step inside a large warehouse... their movement completely violates the laws of physics.}

<A>__{silence. then voices come up slowly:}
<C>__{richardson }
<D>__{yes, sir. no, sir. no, sir. i understand that, sir. absolutely. i will do that, sir.}

<D>__{was that donaldson?}
<C>__{richardson }
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{mccrady }
<D>__{what do you want to do?}
<A>__{fade up blurry at first to david's pov of the warehouse david caught a glimpse of just before he passed out. a half dozen members of the "intervention team" (the silver suits) stand nearby. richardson and mccrady (one of the men from the rooftops) stand behind david, about 20 feet away.}
<C>__{richardson }
<D>__{can you reset him?}
<C>__{mccrady }
<D>__{i don't think we have the authority in a situation like this.}
<C>__{richardson }
<D>__{call legal }
<C>__{burdensky }
<D>__{legal just arrived.}
