<L>__{interior outer office, j. walter thompson late afternoon}
<A>__{the large room is crowded with secretaries, junior executives, researchers, editors, ad men, etc., etc. they all have drinks in their hands and there is a good deal of kissing and general conviviality going on. the camera tracks with ackerman as he steps out of his office, closes the door behind him and makes his way across the room to mr. spencer, the advertising director. at the moment, spencer stands with his coat over one arm and a drink in his hand talking to a very pretty young woman. ackerman approaches him, whispers something in his ear. spencer shakes his head and points to his watch. ackerman says something else and finally, with a look of weary resignation, spencer excuses himself from the pretty young woman and follows ackerman back to his office. the camera follows them. as ackerman opens the door to his office, the camera is angled so that we can see past them, into the office where ted stands waiting.}
