<L>__{interior restaurant retirement party night}
<A>__{that's been cleared out for a huge party in full swing. an irish folk band cuts loose a merciless bagpipe beat. city brass including alderman swayzak a few reporters, firemen and their families all mix together for this is a retirement party for the captain fitzgerald. brian enters, seeks out a beer at the bar. stephen's there, swaying with what is clearly not his first drink of the evening.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{cheers as a one joke gift after another is laid on the chief. stephen sees his ex wife, helen, dancing with another man. he turns away.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i gotta change the view...}
<A>__{santos and grindle walk up.}
<C>__{grindle}
<D>__{heard you didn't make the list for captain, man. i'm sorry...}
<A>__{stephen just shrugs. brian sees jennifer across the room. she looks great. refined as she expertly works the room, schmoozing and hugging and calling various politicos by their first name. as she speaks to one, a waiter offers a drink. as she accepts, a bottle appears over her shoulder and splashes it with red syrup.}
<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(holding bottle, interrupting)}
<D>__{with grenadine, right?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{when i was twenty.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{oooh, very sophisticated. having fun?}
<A>__{her attention broken, the politico has slipped away. annoyed, jennifer leads brian aside and speaks low, but angrily at him.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{look, i'm not the same girl who had nothing better to do than wrap her legs around you on a saturday night. this isn't about fun. i'm working here.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{carrying swayzak's notebook?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{let me tell you something. martin swayzak is going to be this town's next mayor.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{yeah. swayzak. humanity's last hope. how can you work for that guy?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{why do you think marty came here tonight? because he cares about your department. you don't know how hard he works. you don't know about his programs helping west side }
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{ all i know is that his programs are getting firemen hurt.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{bullshit. marty's plan is only about efficiency. i've got two cousins on the job, you think i'd work for him if i didn't believe in it?}
<A>__{jennifer instantly cuts off as a well dressed couple passes and switches stunningly into schmmoze mode.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(to man)}
<D>__{ tom, how nice to see you. i know marty'll be very happy you came. thanks so much for the donation.}
<P>__{(to woman)}
<D>__{marie... how's little kevin? really? seen the polls? this is the year...}
<A>__{they move away. jennifer turns to brian and switches just as fast back to their argument.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{ the thing that really makes me angry is the way your union has }
<A>__{brian can't help it. he cracks up.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{what was that? oh man, you have picked up a few moves since john paul ii boulevard.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{yeah, well i like to think i'm just a little past hanging out on jp ii watching the irish pick fights and litwalks barf in the planters.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i seem to remember some pretty good nights on jp ii.}
<A>__{brian turns and walks away.}
<B>__{across the room}
<A>__{adcox is talking with another knot of firemen. he's brought a date, sally, a hot little number that has a habit of standing on her tip toes when she talks.}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(looking at swayzak across room)}
<D>__{yuck, what a scumbag.}
<C>__{axe}
<P>__{(to santos)}
<D>__{fuckin' city transferred sally three months ago out of parking violations into swayzak's office. now i gotta pay my own goddamn tickets and she's stuck with an asshole.}
<C>__{santos}
<D>__{pay more?}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{no, but there's more exercise being chased around a desk.}
<A>__{there's a commotion at the other end of the bar. a group of firemen have gathered around a weekly magazine.}
<C>__{grindle}
<D>__{aw, i don't believe this shit.}
<C>__{schmidt}
<D>__{somebody get a shovel! you seen this, stephen?}
<A>__{as they hold it up to stephen we see a photo spread titled}
<B>__{daring fire rescue.}
<A>__{the first photo shows brian rushing out of the burning building with seemingly a woman in his arms. the second photo shows the backs of adcox and tim's helmets as they administered aid to the real woman they saved. the implication is it's the same woman.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tim}
<P>__{(reads)}
<D>__{"probationary fireman brian mccaffrey, on his very first fire, showed the kind of bravery and courage of a veteran firefighter when he risked life and limb to double check a burning floor alone, emerging victoriously with anna rodriguez, a seamstress for the north shore clothing company... mccaffrey first gained prominence as the subject of a 1972 pulitzer prize winning photograph taken at the scene of his father's death..."}
<A>__{the old photo is there too. brian and his dad's helmet.}
<C>__{grindle}
<D>__{whadda we gonna do about this?}
<A>__{stephen glances over the headlines.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{y'know, i think it's a union bylaw that if a guy gets in the paper especially if it's bullshit he owes the company a drink. in fact...}
<P>__{(motions to waiter)}
<D>__{...i will have a double. on the hero.}
<A>__{the other firemen jump in with drink orders. dozens of them.}
<C>__{brian}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<A>__{tim shows him the magazine. brian reads with horror as alderman swayzak appears beside him.}
<C>__{swayzak}
<D>__{brian mccaffrey, right?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{brian, this is my boss, alderman swayzak.}
<P>__{(to swayzak)}
<D>__{brian's a big fan of yours.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{yeah. big fan.}
<C>__{swayzak}
<D>__{and i'm a huge fan of what you did to save that woman, brian.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{uh, i think there's been a mistake. i didn't save that woman.}
<C>__{swayzak}
<D>__{no need to be modest, brian.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{no, you don't understand, i saved a mannequin.}
<C>__{swayzak}
<D>__{ that really was incredibly work you did. you and your brother, fighting fires together, helluva image, isn't it? you must feel lucky to be assigned under his command.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{every little boy's fantasy.}
<C>__{swayzak}
<D>__{brian, let me come to the pointerior i'd like to offer you a job.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i have a job.}
<C>__{swayzak}
<D>__{this one's still with the fire department. one of our best investigators, don rimgale, is working on a very difficult, visible case right now. we think he could use another pair of hands and you're exactly the kind of guy i want representing us: an authentic hero from a traditional firefighting clan.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{yeah, we got all kinds of traditions like dying young.}
<C>__{swayzak}
<D>__{not every job in the fire department comes with a tombstone, brian. this could be a great opportunity to move... beyond a fire engine.}
<A>__{brian looks at jennifer, then smiles at swayzak.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{thanks anyway, mr. swayzak, but fire engines sorta run in my family. politics don't.}
<A>__{ a man suddenly steps between them to pump swayzak's hand. brian shakes his head and walks away. swayzak shoots a concerned glance at jennifer. she catches up with him at the buffet table.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{boy, took you all of thirty seconds to blow that.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{c'mon jennifer, he's just another north side jag off with a mouth.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{brian, do you always have to be so stupid? think about your future for once.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{so now you suddenly care about my future?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{look, i didn't mean to take a piece out of you back there, i just thought you'd call when you came back. you didn't and...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{don't blow it just because of this garbage between us.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{hey, sorry if i made you look bad in front of your boss. but i'm not gonna be a poster boy for him, i'm trying to do something here. there's five hundred smoke eaters in this room that do that stuff for real every day. tell swayzak to talk to one of them.}
<A>__{across the room, stephen's at the buffet, watching helen dance with her fireman date, the drinks hammering him hard.}
<C>__{pengelly}
<D>__{aw man, how can she dance with that guy?}
<C>__{schmidt}
<D>__{i hate that guy. he's a dispatcher. i hate his voice.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{whatever...}
<C>__{pengelly}
<D>__{i mean, i know women have gotta bang somebody, but why that son of a bitch?}
<A>__{stephen gives pengelly an icy, sideways look.}
<C>__{schmidt}
<D>__{hey stevie, he's an asshole...}
<A>__{stephen smiles and pushes off the bar right for helen as she dances.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{uh, helen, i wanted to talk to you a second about sean...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{stephen, i'm kinda busy here, can we talk about this later?}
<C>__{date}
<D>__{how ya doin', stephen?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{jackson.}
<A>__{jackson steers her away but stephen isn't done yet. he dogs them.}
<C>__{stephen}
<P>__{(to helen)}
<D>__{what's wrong with right now? he's your son for christ's sake. he's }
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{hey, stephen, what about that dumb ass brother of yours, huh?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{...yeah?}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{savin' a mannequin... how fuckin' stupid can a guy get?}
<A>__{stephen suddenly punches jackson.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{you can't talk about my brother like that...}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{here we go...}
<A>__{and stephen plows into jackson. another fireman jumps to jackson's aid. and brian's there, defending his brother, punching out a fireman. the crowd finally pulls the two apart.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{you're crazy, man!}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{leave me alone!}
<C>__{axe}
<D>__{goddamn it, stephen, lay off!}
<P>__{(stephen calms a little)}
<D>__{you stupid dumbshit, you never know when to fucking quit, do you? you ever wonder why your career's in the fucking toilet? why you're gonna be stuck a lt. for life?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i need a drink.}
<A>__{stephen takes a step for the bar then suddenly turns and jumps jackson again. brian pulls him off and drags him for the door.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{you don't need a drink, man. you need to get outta here...}
<A>__{as jennifer watches brian lead stephen out the door.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(to swayzak)}
<D>__{ah those mccaffreys... just hate leaving a party with anyone left standing...}
