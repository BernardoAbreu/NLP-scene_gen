<A>__{the group enters a large room with the filthiest wall to wall carpet imaginable. in the back corner is a small stage. on it a three piece hell metal band is building up toward oblivion. the lead singer is dressed in a buffalo skin complete with at least half the buffalo head and horns. he wears spray painted, day glow orange cowboy boots. some half dressed girls and cowboys are dancing to the band. in darkened corners away from the stage other groups are racing the band to oblivion. laura leans over to donna noticing her shocked look.}
