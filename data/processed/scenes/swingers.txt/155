<A>__{...we rise and pass the glowing hollywood sign. it's still a full moon...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{here's to those who drink their dinners when that lady doesn't show... to the girls who wait for kisses underneath that mistletoe... to the lonely summer lovers when the leaves begin to fall... here's to the losers... bless them all...}

<A>__{... up and over hollywood boulevard. high above the city...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{here's the last toast of the evening... here's to those who still believe... all the losers will be winners... all the givers shall receive... here's to trouble free tomorrows... may your sorrows all be small... here's to the losers... bless them all.}
