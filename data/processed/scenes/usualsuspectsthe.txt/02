<L>__{exterior boat night stern 2'}
<A>__{a stack of oil drums rests on the stern. they are stacked on a palette with ropes at each corner that attach it to a huge crane on the dock. one of the barrels has been punctured at it's base. gasoline trickles freely from the hole. the flame is racing now towards the barrels. keaton smiles weakly to himself. the flame is within a few yards of the barrels when another stream of liquid splashes onto the gas. the flame fizzles out pitifully with a hiss. two feet straddle the flame. a stream of urine flows onto the deck from between them. the sound of a fly zipping. follow the feet as they move over to where keaton rests at the wheel house. crane up to the waist of the unknown man. he pulls a pack of cigarettes out of one pocket and a strange antique lighter from the other. it is gold, with a clasp that folds down over the flinterior the man flicks up the clasp with his thumb and strikes it with his index finger. it is a fluid motion, somewhat showy. keaton looks up at the man. a look of realization crosses his face. it is followed by frustration, anger, and finally resignation.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{how are you, keaton?}
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{i'd have to say my spine was broken, keyser.}
<A>__{he spits the name out like it was poison. the man puts the lighter back in his pocket and reaches under his jacket. he produces a stainless .38 revolver.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{ready?}
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{what time is it?}
<A>__{the hand with the gun turns over, turning the gold watch on its wrist upward. the sound of sirens is closer now. headed this way.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{twelve thirty.}
<A>__{keaton grimaces bitterly and nods. he turns his head away and takes another drag. the hand with the gun waits long enough for keaton to enjoy his last drag before pulling the trigger.}
<B>__{gunshot}
<A>__{the sound of keaton's body slumping onto the deck. move out across the deck. below is the stream of gasoline still flowing freely. the sound of the gasoline igniting. the flame runs in front of us towards the barrels, finally leaping up in a circle around the drums, burning the wood of the pallet and licking the spouting stream as it pours from the hole. move out across the dock, away from the boat. the pier to which the boat is moored is littered with dead bodies. twenty or more men have been shot to pieces and lie scattered everywhere in what can only be the aftermath of a fierce fire fight.}
<B>__{a barge comes into view.}
<A>__{on the deck of the barge is a tangle of cables and girders. the mesh of steel and rubber leaves a dark and open cocoon beneath its base.}
<B>__{move into the darkness.}
<A>__{sirens are close now. almost here. the sound of fire raging out of control.}
<B>__{sirens blaring. tires squealing. car doors opening. feet pounding the pavement.}
<A>__{move further, slower, into the darkness voices yelling. new light flickering in the surrounding darkness. suddenly, an explosion. then silence. total blackness. we hear the voice of roger "verbal" kint, whom we will soon meet.}
<C>__{verbal }
<D>__{new york. six weeks ago. a truck loaded with stripped gun parts got jacked outside of queens. the driver didn't see anybody, but somebody fucked up. he heard a voice. sometimes, that's all you need.}
<B>__{boom}
