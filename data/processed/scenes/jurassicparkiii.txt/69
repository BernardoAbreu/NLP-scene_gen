<L>__{exterior ingen compound twilight}
<A>__{on the far side of the tipped over vehicle, eric pulls open a hatch his hiding place. the door opens part way. eric motions for grant to follow.}
<L>__{interior inside the bunker twilight}
<A>__{squeezing in sideways it's very tight fit grant finds himself in a space no bigger than the inside of a datsun. lit by a small battery powered lantern. this is where eric has been hiding. the minute grant's inside, eric goes back to work re sealing the door. this 13 year old boy has become astonishingly efficient at staying alive.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{eric...}
<A>__{the boy holds up a hand. he listens for a moment. he doesn't hear anything outside.}
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{eric, your parents are both here.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{in costa rica?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{on the island.}
<A>__{eric truly can't believe it. he hoped to be rescued but...}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{they'll never make it. i mean, they can't manage when the cable goes out.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{you'd be surprised what people can do when they have too.}
<A>__{eric studies his guest, finally certain he recognizes him.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{you're alan grant, aren't you?}
<P>__{(off surprised reaction)}
<D>__{i read both of your books.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{which one do you prefer?}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{the first one. before you where on the island. you liked dinosaurs back then.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{back then, they hadn't tried to eat me.}
<A>__{grant takes a better look around eric's tiny hideaway, impressed with what he's been able to scavenge. among the many items we see another smoke canister, some battery powered lanterns and lots of candy wrappers. this kid's been living on chocolate for weeks.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{when ingen cleared out, they left a lot of stuff behind.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{any weapons, radios?}
<A>__{eric pulls up a long cattle prod to show grant.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{found this, but the battery's dead.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{it's a wonder you aren't. i'm amazed, eric. i barely lasted 30 hours. you lasted eight weeks.}
<A>__{the line catches eric strangely. it's the first moment of true emotion we've seen him in.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{is that all it's been? i thought it was longer.}
<C>__{grant}
<P>__{(trying to be positive)}
<D>__{the important thing is we both made it. that's something we have in common.}
<A>__{eric rips into a candy bar. after a moment, he realizes he should offer one to his guest as well. grant takes it. a lone beat. than, grant just has to know...}
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{did you read malcolm's book?}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{what did you think?}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i dunno. i mean, it was kind of preachy. chaos this, chaos that. and like, to me, the guy seemed kind of high on himself.}
<A>__{grant smiles.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{that's two things we have in common.}
