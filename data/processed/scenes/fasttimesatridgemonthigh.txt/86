<L>__{exterior hamilton pool}
<A>__{mike damone yells "banzai!" and dives into the small pool. at one end of the pool is the jacuzzi, which is separated by a tile wall. damone has already poured the wisk into the jacuzzi, and the detergent has created a huge bubble bath effect. damone surfaces and flips into the jacuzzi. stacy, looking great in a green bikini, sits kicking her legs by the side of the pool. linda stands on the board. she is poised to dive. the rat treads water and stares at both girls. inside the hamilton living room, the family stereo plays the music of deep purple's "woman from tokyo".}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{hey, linda! i will judge your dive. i'm a champion diver myself.}
<A>__{brad arrives home by the side gate and slams it behind him. he is home from a bad day at work. he walks out onto the patio and stands with his hands on his hips. for the first time, our former campus hero looks absurd. he is still in his uniform from captain kidd fish and chips it is a blue and white striped pirates of the caribbean outfit, complete with black plastic sword at the side, and a ridiculously large ponce de leon esque hat. brad carries the hat under his arm.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{does mom know you have company?}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{it's just linda. and mark from school.}
<A>__{brad ignores the underclassmen, and notices linda on the board in her maroon bikini. he smiles.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{hi, linda.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{hi, brad.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{well, you guys, keep it down. i've got some work to do upstairs.}
<A>__{brad turns and heads back inside. he is just out of earshot when they begin talking about him.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{god, he hardly even talks anymore.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{i know. he hates to have to wear uniforms.}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{poor guy.}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{really.}
<A>__{stacy breaks the spell by jumping into the water, surfacing, and flipping over the tile wall into the jacuzzi. she sits next to damone, looking mischievous.}
<B>__{angle on damone and stacy in the jacuzzi}
<A>__{talking while the others are at the other end of the pool.}
<B>__{angle on the rat}
<A>__{casually catching sight of them together from the other side of the pool. we can read the emotions on the rat's face. he is still taken with stacy, but his big moment for her appears to have passed.}
<B>__{angle on damone and stacy in the jacuzzi}
<A>__{as they talk. underneath the water, her leg accidentally knocks against his. then he feels her continue. damone feels stacy's cool hand on his inner thigh. moving upwards, stopping just short of the bulge in his trunks. angle on damone's face as it loosens and quivers just the slightest bit. this is uncharted territory, even for mr. attitude.}
<B>__{angle on linda}
<A>__{who is now sunning herself by the side of the pool. she rubs her legs against each other, slowly, enjoying the hot afternoon.}
