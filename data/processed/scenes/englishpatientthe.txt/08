<L>__{6. exterior italian hill road. early 1945. day.}
<A>__{the sand gives way to trees, the jingling bottles to distant church bells, as a convoy of twenty trucks red cross vehicles and some supply vehicles snakes along a bumpy hill road. the war in italy is largely over and the allies are moving up the country, the wounded and supply lines slowly following.}
<L>__{7. interior red cross truck. day.}
<A>__{a young canadian nurse, hana, sits in a truck full of patients. hana pays special care to the patient lying in the stretcher alongside her. this is the pilot now known as the english patient. a web of scars covers the patient's face and body. they have the quality of a livid tattoo, magenta and green black. the hair has largely gone and the effect is curious, lassoing his features, the strong nose, the eyes liquid. it's a warrior's face. but he has no physical strength. he coughs violently as the trucks shudders along the road.}
