<A>__{jean luc picard, the most beloved and respected captain in starfleet. his face is resolute and set. even stern. his white dress uniform is buttoned tightly to the neck. he looks at us evenly and then utters the word that has been the watch cry for his entire life as a starfleet officer.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{duty...}
<A>__{he lets the word resonate and then continues.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{a starship captain's life is filled with solemn duty. i have commanded men in battle. i have negotiated peace treaties between implacable enemies. i have represented the federation in first contact with twenty seven alien species. but none of this compares to my solemn duty as... best man.}
<A>__{uproarious laughter. we pull back to reveal the wedding reception of will riker and deanna troi. the enterprise crew is gathered with invited guests, some from other "star trek" series. riker and deanna sit at the center of a long table.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{now, i know that on an occasion such as this: it is expected that i be gracious and fulsome with praise on the wonders of this blessed union... but have you two considered what you're doing to? this is all a damned inconvenience...}
<P>__{(laughter from the crowd)}
<D>__{while you're happily settling in on the titan, i will have to train a new first officer; no doubt a stern martinet who'll quote the rule book at me and never... ever... allow me to go on away missions.}
<P>__{(laughter)}
<D>__{... then there's the matter of my new counselor. undoubtedly some soft spoken, willowy thing who'll be probing into my darkest psyche as she nods her head and coos sympathetically. isn't that right, deanna?}
<A>__{deanna nods her head and coos sympathetically. hearty, wonderful laughter!}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i notice dr. crusher laughing along with the rest of you. as most of you know, the doctor will also soon be leaving the enterprise, to assume command of starfleet medical. again, i'm forced to ask, beverly, have you considered what you're doing to little ole' me?! i will probably get some old battle axe of a doctor who'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if i don't show up for my physical on time!}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{it'll serve you right.}
<A>__{laughter, laughter, laughter! he looks to riker and deanna:}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{really, it's not too late to reconsider. no? very well then...}
<A>__{he smiles and raises his glass, looks at them deeply.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{will riker, you have been my trusted right arm for fourteen years; you have helped keep my course true and steady. deanna troi, you have been my conscience and best guide, the touchstone to the better parts of myself. you are my family. and in proper maritime tradition i wish you full sails and a clear horizon... my friends, make it so.}
<A>__{they drink.}
