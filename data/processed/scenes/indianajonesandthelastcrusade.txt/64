<L>__{exterior the castle day}
<A>__{indy swings from the window to the stone gargoyle.}
<B>__{close on the window ledge}
<A>__{a pair of wooden shutters seals the window. indy takes hold of the bullwhip with both hands, pushes off with his feet... swings toward the shuttered window with his feet extended... crashing through the wooden shutters as a clap of thunder disguises the noise.}
<L>__{interior the room day}
<A>__{indy crashes through shutters and glass into the room. the broken shutters hang by their hinges. rain and cold air whip through the open window. no sooner does indy get to his feet, than a vase comes crashing down on}
<B>__{the back of his head.}
<A>__{stunned, indy sinks to one knee... and indy's father, professor henry jones, steps out of the shadows.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{junior?}
<A>__{indy gets to his feet.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(a reflex)}
<D>__{yes, sirl}
<A>__{this reply is a kneejerk reaction on indy's part. now they look at each other.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{it is you junior!}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(an old familiar irritation)}
<D>__{don't call me that, please.}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(amazed)}
<D>__{but what are you doing here?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i came to get you! what do you think?}
<A>__{nazi voices are heard approaching. indy and henry press themselves against the wall, henry still holding the broken vase in his hand. indy steps to the window and looks down. henry moves to a lamp, holding the vase under the light for a closer look.}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(sotto, mumbled)}
<D>__{late fourteenth century, ming dynasty.}
<A>__{henry is all about the broken vase which he still holds in his hand. father and son get onto crossed lines for a couple of moments.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{oh, it breaks the heart.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(quietly to himself)}
<D>__{and the head.}
<P>__{(to henry, aggrievedly)}
<D>__{you hit me, dad!}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(referring to the vase)}
<D>__{i will never forgive myself}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(surprised, misunderstanding)}
<D>__{don't worryi'm fine.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{thank god!}
<A>__{henry has clearly been concentrating entirely on the vase... he is examining the broken end carefully.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{... it's fake. see, you can tell by the cross section.}
<A>__{henry throws the vase against the wall where it shatters.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{no! dad, get your stuff. we've got to get out of here.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{well, i am sorry about your head, though. but i thought you were one of them.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{dad, they come in through the doors.}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{good pointerior}
<A>__{indy steps to the door and stands, listening.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{but better safe than sorry.}
<A>__{henry slides his umbrella through the straps of his bag.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{humpfso i was wrong this time. but by god, i wasn't wrong when i mailed you my diary. you obviously got it.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i got it and i used it. we found the entrance to the catacombs.}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{through the library?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i knew it. and the tomb of sir richard?}
<A>__{indy nods.}

<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(breathless)}
<D>__{he was actually there? you saw him?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{well, what was left of him.}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(trembling with anticipation)}
<D>__{and his shield... the inscription on sir richard's shield...?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{alexandretta.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<A>__{it's a great moment in henry's life. he turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to indy with joy.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the eastern empire. oh, junior...}
<A>__{indy winces, and would interrupt but suddenly it's not the moment.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{... you did it.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{no, dad. you did. forty years.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{if only i could have been with you.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{there were rats, dad.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{rats?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{yeah. big ones. what do the nazis want with you dad?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{they want my diary.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(interested)}
<D>__{yeah?}
<A>__{indy's interest is a moment which becomes important later but for now it passes.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i knew i had to get that book as far away from me as i possibly could.}
<A>__{indy's hand moves unconsciously to his pocket. his eyes turn inward.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(thoughtfully)}
<D>__{yeah. . .}
<A>__{then... bami the door is kicked open and three nazis enter. one is an s.s. officer. the other two are soldiers with machine guns. henry and indy raise their hands.}
<C>__{s.s. officer}
<D>__{doctor jones!! henry & indy yes!!}
<C>__{s.s. officer}
<D>__{i will take the book now. indy henry}
<P>__{(simultaneously)}
<D>__{what book?}
<C>__{s.s. officer}
<P>__{(to indy)}
<D>__{you have the diary in your pocket.}
<A>__{henry laughs genuinely, believing himself to be laughing at the expense of the}
<B>__{s.s. officer.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{you doltl do you think that my son would be that stupid that he would bring my diary all the way back here?}
<A>__{at which point an awful thought strikes henry.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{you didn't, did you?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{you didn't bring it, did you?}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{well, uh...}

<D>__{you did!!}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{look, can we discuss this later?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i should have mailed it to the marx brothers.}
<C>__{indy}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{will you take it easy....!}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{take it easy?! why do you think i sent it home in the first place?}
<P>__{(points towards the nazis)}
<D>__{so it wouldn't fall into their hands!!}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i came here to save you.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{oh yeah? and who's gonna come to save you, junior??}
<A>__{indy's eyes blazes his nostrils flares he's so pissed off, he literally rips a machine gun from the hands of one of the startled soldiers... and for a moment we think he's going to use it on his dad.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{i told you }
<A>__{he turns and sprays the room with machine gun fire, cutting all three nazis to ribbons and blowing them backwards across the room.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{ don't call me junior!}
<A>__{henry looks shocked and horrified.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{look what you did!!}
