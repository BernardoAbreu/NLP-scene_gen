<A>__{ross is playing a game of full court basketball with some other officers. a door at the far end of the court opens and kaffee and jo walk in. they head down the sideline toward ross. kaffee shouts }
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{jack!}
<A>__{but ross is into the game...}
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{jack!!}
<C>__{ross}
<P>__{(waving him off)}
<D>__{hang on...}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{they were given an order.}
<A>__{ross stops cold and looks over at kaffee. the game flies by him. he motions to the locker room door in the corner of the gym and the three of them make their way to privacy.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{how long have you known about the order?}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{i didn't }
<P>__{(to kaffee)}
<D>__{who is this?}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{this is jo galloway she's downey's lawyer. she's very pleased to meet you.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{what exactly are you accusing me of, commander?}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{i'm accusing you of }
<A>__{they're in the locker room night and kaffee slams the door shut behind them.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{jack didn't know about the order. because if he did and he hadn't told us, jack knows he'd be violating about 14 articles of the code of ethics. as it is, he's got enough to worry about. god forbid our clients decide to plead not guilty and testify for the record that they were given an order.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{kendrick specifically told the men not to touch santiago.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{that's right. and then he went into dawson and downey's room and specifically told them to give him a code red.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{that's not what kendrick said.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{kendrick's lying.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{you have proof?}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{i have the defendants.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{and i have 23 marines who aren't accused of murder and a lieutenant with four letters of commendation.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{why did markinson resign his commission?}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{we'll never know.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{you don't think i can subpoena markinson.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{you can try, but you won't find him. you know what markinson did for the first 17 of his 21 years in the corps? counter intelligence. markinson's gone. there is no markinson.}
<A>__{some of the wind has been taken out of kaffee's sails.}
<C>__{ross}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{jessep's star is on the rise. division'll give me a lot of room to spare jessep and the corps any embarrassment.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{how much room?}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{i will knock it all down to assault. two years. they're home in six months.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{no deal, we're going to a jury.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{jo }
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{no you're not.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{'cause you'll lose, and danny knows it. and he knows that if we go to court, i will have to go all the way, they'll be charged with the whole truckload. murder, conspiracy, conduct unbecoming, and even though he's got me by the balls out here, dan knows that in a courtroom, he loses this case. danny's an awfully talented lawyer, and he's not about to send his clients go to jail for life when he knows they could be home in six months.}
<A>__{this is now clear: ross is as good as kaffee.}
<C>__{ross}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{that's the end of this negotiation. from this moment, we're on the record. i will see tomorrow morning at the arraignment.}
<A>__{ross turns and heads back to the gym as we}
