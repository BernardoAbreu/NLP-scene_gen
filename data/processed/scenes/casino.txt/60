<C>__{ace }
<D>__{after we ate, we left jennifer and ginger alone and we took a ride to talk. and then... he hit me with it.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{what do you think about me movin' out here?}
<P>__{(ace looks away.)}
<D>__{what's the matter? you got a problem with that?}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{no, of course not.}
<C>__{nicky}
<P>__{(playfully)}
<D>__{you mean, i have your permission?}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{sure, you have my permission. but i i just gotta tell you it's no joke out here. it's no joke, you know? you gotta keep a low profile. it's not like back home. right off the bat, they don't like guys like us. and this sheriff's a real cowboy. even the coppers aren't afraid to bury people out in the desert here.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{i don't care. i want to get away from back home for a while. i'm tired of that shit back there.}
<P>__{(referring to the vegas lights.)}
<D>__{look at this place. it's made of money. you know what the best part is? nobody's gonna know what we're doin'! there's nobody here to see us! everybody's back home.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{nick, i gotta tell you, i got pinched twice for no reason. you really gotta be careful. i'm running a licensed place. everything's legit.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{don't worry about it. i'm not gonna do anything. what am i gonna do? i'm especially not gonna involve you in anything.}
<A>__{ace gives nicky a look.}
