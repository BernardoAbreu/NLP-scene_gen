<L>__{interior early 60's coffee shop wide night}
<A>__{it's 1963 futuristic: flagstone and rubber plants. most of the patrons are night people: pimps, hookers, customers, disintegrating couples, etc. we pan around the interior and settle on a booth by a window. in the booth are chris and cerrito on one side and waingro alone.}
<C>__{waingro}
<D>__{anybody want some pie?}
<B>__{cerrito}
<A>__{looks at waingro, sips his coffee, and looks away again waingro is nervous.}
<B>__{chris}
<A>__{sees something in the parking lot. door neil enters, crosses to the booth, slides in across from waingro.}
<B>__{close}
<A>__{the four men huddle together and talk in a whisper. neil pulls out three yellow envelopes, presumably full of money. neil will talk about waingro in the third person as if he inanimate.}
<C>__{neil}
<P>__{(whispered)}
<D>__{this is a partial split, but i took out of ours every to make up...}

<P>__{(whispered; tense)}
<D>__{i had to dust him!}
<A>__{neil grabs the back of waingro's neck, slams the side of his face onto the table top and flicks the middle finger of his left against waingro's temple. neil could kill him.}
<C>__{neil}
<P>__{(whispered)}
<D>__{electricity and chemicals a little fucked up?}
<P>__{(flick)}
<D>__{you a shooter? speed? what?}
<A>__{flick. cerrito looks around the coffee shop: it's quiet.}
<C>__{neil}
<P>__{(continuing; whispered)}
<D>__{you didn't have to. now we got extra heat off a clean score.}
<A>__{waingro does nothing. neil shoves him into the corner of the booth. plates fall. all three get up and walk out.}
