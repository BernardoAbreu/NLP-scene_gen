<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{you guys okay?}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{samantha takes a wide line around hannah, who continues banging the two by four into the ground. as soon as the child sees her mother, she stops. samantha crouches in front of hannah, gently taking the board away from her. samantha signs with her hand and speaks at the same time.}
<C>__{samantha}
<D>__{no. don't touch.}
<A>__{hannah tilts her head, looking off to the side. samantha touches her chin bringing her eyes back around.}

<P>__{(signing and speaking)}
<D>__{you understand?}
<A>__{hannah nods once, "yes".}
<C>__{samantha }
<D>__{oksy. come here.}
<A>__{samantha stands and takes the board to a trash pile in the back corner of the yard. a storm shelter is buried in the ground just behind the pile. it's a grass covered mound with two rusted metal doors angled toward the sky. she throws the board onto the heap and wipes her hands on her pants. staring at the pile, she lets out an irritated sigh. thunder rumbles low in the distance. she looks up at the approaching clouds and calls to the children as she walks back inside.}

<D>__{hey, dj. bring the girls inside.}
