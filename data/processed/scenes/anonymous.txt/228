<L>__{interior tower of london interrogation room night}
<A>__{where we began. a bucket of water is dumped on jonson. he regains consciousness and looks around. somewhat confused he sees: robert cecil limping out of the dark towards him. robert cecil leans down, and very close to his ear, whispers:}
<C>__{cecil}
<D>__{i can make all this go away, jonson... to be but a dream. like one of your plays... or, i can bring you so much pain pain that were you given a thousand years, and a thousand quills, you could never justly describe...}
<A>__{cecil steps back.}
<C>__{cecil }
<D>__{i know you have them. all his manuscripts. my sister saw you leave oxford stone with them under your arm.}
<A>__{jonson takes a long time before answering. will he betray oxford?}
<C>__{jonson}
<D>__{they were destroyed... burned... by your own men...}
<A>__{cecil doesn't know whether to believe him or not.}
<C>__{interrogator}
<D>__{he's lying...}
<C>__{jonson}
<D>__{my lord? why would i lie? is there a man alive who has reason to hate him more than i?}
<A>__{jonson stares directly at cecil, knowing he is speaking about cecil as well as himself.}
<C>__{jonson }
<D>__{he was something i could never be. an undeniable perfection... that plagued my soul... and to him i was... nothing. a messenger. nothing more.}
<A>__{cecil stares into his eyes for a long moment, searching for the truth. then he smiles.}
<C>__{cecil}
<D>__{let him go! he tells the truth.}
<A>__{robert cecil turns to leave, but then turns a last time.}
<C>__{cecil }
<D>__{and jonson better him, won't you? wipe his memory for all time. for you. and for me.}
<A>__{robert cecil smiles at jonson, who can only stare at him. finally:}
<C>__{jonson}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{i am afraid that this is not possible, my lord.}
<A>__{robert cecil's smile freezes and he leaves.}
