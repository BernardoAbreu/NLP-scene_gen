<A>__{which shows now only space and its familiar star patterns. all gaze at the viewer, awed at what they've seen and undergone. they exchange looks silently, no one wanting to be the first to try to comment on some thing which is beyond mere words. we hear an elevator door, scott and chapel enter the bridge and stand silently watching.}
<D>__{mccoy well, it certainly has been... interesting.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{spock, we were its answer!}
<C>__{spock}

<D>__{yes, captain. it needed our mortality, the fear of it, our struggle against it, our fears, our dreams...}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{... and the 'foolish' emotions which drive us?}
<C>__{spock}
<P>__{(looks at kirk; then)}
<D>__{i prefer your poet dante's phrase 'the divine restlessness of the human spirit.' mccoy spock... you're quoting poetry?}

<C>__{kirk}

<P>__{(toward spock)}
<D>__{we can have you back on vulcan in four days, mr. spock.}
<C>__{spock}
<P>__{(coolly)}
<D>__{i have no business on vulcan, engineer.}
<A>__{kirk and spock exchange a look then kirk turns to the helm.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{ahead warp one, mr. sulu.}
<C>__{difalco}
<D>__{heading, sir?}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(taking center seat; indicates generally)}
