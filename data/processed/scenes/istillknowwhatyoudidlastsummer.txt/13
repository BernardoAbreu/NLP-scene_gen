<A>__{she hits the light switch. a bedside light goes on. it's a sparsely furnished room. the bed is pilled high with pillows. she checks the windows, then climbs into bed with the food. on the bedside table are pictures of family and friends. she looks at one of helen and barry. she looks around the room. it's depressing. outside we hear young people having fun, slamming car doors, going places. she picks at the food, then puts it on the table. she turns off the bedside light and enjoys the golden late afternoon glow in the room.}
