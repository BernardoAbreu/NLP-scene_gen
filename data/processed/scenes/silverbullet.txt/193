<L>__{interior a slightly wider shot, featuring andy and haller}
<A>__{andy hops off the bar to face haller directly. in the b.g. we see herb kincaid (kincaid, by the way, should be wearing a black armband he's come directly from his son's funeral).}
<C>__{haller }
<D>__{we'll catch him.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{you couldn't catch a cold.}
<A>__{haller looks at him for a moment, then turns to look at the crowd. they look rather like a lynch mob; on their faces we see an uneasy mix of shame and eager determination. haller speaks with a kind of haggard, fading desperation.}
<C>__{haller}
<D>__{the law has a name for what you men are planning. it's private justice, and private justice is about a step and a half away from lynch mobs and hang ropes. i'm no j. edgar hoover, but i am the law in tarker's mills, and i want you men to go home.}
<A>__{they shuffle their feet uneasily; many look down. he is getting to them.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{don't let this guy scare you! what's he done since this thing started but hang his face out?}
<A>__{it's not working. many of the men look disgusted with both andy and themselves.}
<C>__{andy }
<D>__{he ain't got so much as a fingerprint!}
<C>__{owen knopfler}
<D>__{ah, shut up, andy.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{don't tell me to }
<A>__{herb kincaid steps forward.}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{yes. correct. shut up.}
<A>__{andy, surprised and bewildered, does. herb turns and looks grimly at joe haller, who can barely meet his gaze.}
<C>__{herb }
<D>__{i just came from my boy's funeral.}
<C>__{haller}
<D>__{herb...i know how upset how grief stricken you must be...but }
<C>__{herb }
<D>__{he was torn apart.}
<A>__{utter silence in owen's place now. the others are staring, rapt.}
<C>__{haller}
<D>__{yes. yes, but }
<C>__{herb }
<D>__{upset, you say. grief stricken, you say. constable, you don't know what those words mean. my son was torn to pieces. to pieces!}
<A>__{herb turns to the others in the pub. tears stream down his face.}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{my son was torn to pieces!}
<P>__{(turning back to haller)}
<D>__{you come in here and talk to these men about private justice. you dare to do that. constable haller, why don't you go out to harmony hill and dig up what's left of brady and explain to him about private justice. would you want to do that?}
<A>__{haller makes no reply. he looks down at his feet.}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{no. i thought not.}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{you folks stay here if you want. i wouldn't ask anyone to do anything that runs counter to his conscience. as for me... i'm going out and hunt up a little private justice.}
<A>__{andy fairton has swelled up again. he grins poisonously at the slumped haller. he pushes off after herb kincaid. other men start to follow.}
