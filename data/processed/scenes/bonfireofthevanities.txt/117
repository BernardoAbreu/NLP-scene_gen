<D>__{what kind of muckracking yellow journalist are you!? you print a story like this without so much as a by your leave to me or to reverend bacon here! who the hell do you think you are.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(tearfully)}
<D>__{please, you have to keep your voices down.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{look, don't you understand? it is very possible that sherman mccoy was not driving that car. and i can almost prove it.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{so what?! so what?! so what?! this is our case.}
<A>__{he gestures toward henry lamb.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{right here. you see? it's the hospital that's the guilty party.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{the hospital?! what are you talking about?}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{a young man comes in here with a cerebral concussion and they treat him for a broken wrist. that is our case! that is the lawsuit that we are going to bring against this hospital. that is what we have been working toward all this time. and you are confusing the issue! do you understand me?!}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{alright, alright. but christ, albert, this is a great story. this is my exclusive. and it's also the truth!}
<C>__{bacon}
<D>__{it's a little late for you to start telling the truth, isn't it, pete?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i can't just drop this now. i can't just let it go.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{sure you can. there's gonna be other stories, other exclusives. don't worry. we'll take care of you.}

<D>__{that's right. you're our boy, peter. you take care of us and we'll take care of you. i promise you, that's going to be a very profitable relationship for all of us.}
<A>__{suddenly, annie starts to weep.}
<C>__{bacon}
<D>__{annie, i know that nothing can heal the wound that you have suffered. but ten million dollars in damages will certainly make your grief more comfortable.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{well, yes, i could use a few things, reverend, thank you. i been worried about my clothes for instance. i feel that the presentation of my person should be carefully designed. as a model to black mothers everywhere, i think i should have the right wardrobe. so if you could have mr. fox's limousine pick me up in the morning, i could do some shopping.}
<C>__{fox}
<D>__{why certainly.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i will need some furniture, too. and a new refrigerator. and although i should probably continue to live in that shithole of an apartment at least until after the lawsuit is settled, i would like to start looking now for a co op in manhattan for me and my son something with a view of the river and preferably in a neighborhood that is at least upwardly mobile.}
<A>__{pause as they all look at her.}
<B>__{close on peter}
<C>__{peter }
<D>__{how could i turn my back on the plight of this grief stricken woman? how could i turn my back on a 'profitable relationship'? i was touched to the depths of what was left of my soul... and my bank account.}
