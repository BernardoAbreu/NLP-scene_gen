<D>__{i'm sorry for misleading you. but i'm here to ask you the same question.}

<D>__{i'm sorry to surprise you like this sir. your name is doctor harif al fallari. you were born in basra.}
<A>__{the old man looks perplexed. even a little amused. he sits.}
<C>__{professor aziz}
<D>__{well. this is indeed a strange morning. madam, there seems to have been a mistake. my name is said uhmah aziz. i am a theoretical physicist. i model space. i've never been to basra. i'm a teacher. i'd like to be of assistance. but i'm afraid i can't help you.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{so you're not doctor fallari.}
<C>__{professor aziz}
<D>__{madam. i've never even heard of this man.}
<C>__{valerie}

<C>__{professor aziz}
<D>__{this is absurd.}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{you weren't tortured. broken. you didn't finally escape and arrive here in cairo with nothing.}

<A>__{he looks up at valerie tears in his eyes}
<C>__{valerie}
<D>__{i know tarif. i know what happened.}
<A>__{he walks over to the window. slowly he takes off his jacket. his shirt, pulls it off over his head and turns his back to her. he's been mutilated and burned all up his back. slowly he turns. deep scars. burns.}
