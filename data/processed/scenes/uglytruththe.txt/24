<A>__{abby is pacing, clearly on the verge of hysteria.}
<C>__{abby}
<P>__{(chanting)}
<D>__{i am an award winning news producer. i am an award winning news producer...}
<A>__{a knock. then the door opens and mike appears.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{hey, no hard feelings, right?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you don't even knock?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i knocked. i got no response.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{so, essentially your knock was negated by your complete lack of adherence to the social etiquette of what follows a knock.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{wow. you are wound like a fuckin' top.}
<A>__{abby glares at him.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{woof woof. recognize the bark?}
<A>__{he stares at her, surprised.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(then; realizing)}
<D>__{hey, what do you know? you're not ugly at all.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{imagine my relief.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{you know, if it weren't for you, i would have never gotten this gig. you and i make good tv.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i'm sorry, what channel is your show on?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{eighty three.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{this is channel two. you do know that the lower numbers are better, right? more people watch. so don't tell me that "you and i" make good tv. i am an award winning news producer. i make good tv. you make imbecilic trash watched by housebound inbreds who are so busy putting their hands down their pants they're unable to change the channel.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i hadn't really been picturing you that way, but thanks for the image.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{let me tell you something. i am not one of your viewers. my cat stepped on the remote.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{thank your pussy for me, then.}
<A>__{abby gags as she pushes past him and walks out.}
