<A>__{a house sampan wallows among the naked tree roots in a brackish inlet off the main river. on deck are two men, loosely speaking. possibly two of the most misbegotten specimens the orient has to offer. they raise their ak 47s as co approaches. exchange a few quick syllables and co turns, motioning rambo and brewer forward. as they pass, two more equally unwholesome looking men emerge from concealment and follow them to the sampan. everybody grips their weapons tightly.}

<A>__{before they step across onto the sampan, co introduces the "captain" in vietnamese. wearing all manner of jewelry, including four wristwatches and a pair of filthy western style jeans a size too large, captain trong kinh grins and motions them aboard. the grin reveals bare gum where his upper front teeth would be. obviously broken out in a fight.}

<A>__{grinning wider, captain kinh motions them inside the cabin, a rambling and dilapidated structure of corrugated sheet metal and woven bamboo. kinh barks orders at his men, who cast off from their moorings and jump aboard. the first light of dawn is breaking through the trees.}
