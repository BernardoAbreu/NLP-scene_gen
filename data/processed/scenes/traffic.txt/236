<C>__{marquez}
<D>__{that is not true, mrs. ayala. your route is compromised. perhaps it is time for me to deal with other distributors in california.}
<C>__{helena}

<A>__{juan marquez is confused.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{this doll is cocaine.}

<C>__{helena}
<D>__{every part, from his ears to his accessory belt, is high impact, pressure molded cocaine. odorless. undetectable by dogs. undetectable by anyone.}

<A>__{she takes out the "solvent" and puts it on his desk.}
