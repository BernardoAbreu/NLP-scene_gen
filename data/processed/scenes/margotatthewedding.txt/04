<L>__{exterior ferry dock day}
<A>__{a ferry is docked. cars pull up onto the boat. margot runs, clutching a suitcase, holding down a floppy wine colored sun hat. claude hurries alongside her, a bag slung over his shoulder.}
<L>__{exterior ferry day}
<A>__{the rumbling and sputtering of the boat. people get out of their cars and stretch their legs. claude leans against the rail and lets the spray hit his face. margot's cell vibrates. the caller id: home. she stuffs the phone in her pocket.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{why aren't you wearing your new shades?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i don't think i need them right now.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{you begged for those glasses.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i know, but...i will wear them, i just feel like people might think it's weird that a kid is wearing dark shades.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{that's ridiculous.}
<A>__{claude reluctantly takes out a pair of thin wrap around punk sunglasses and puts them on. he looks around self consciously.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{you look very cool.}
<A>__{he takes them off.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i don't need them right now.}
