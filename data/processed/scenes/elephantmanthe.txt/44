<A>__{high altitude... roiling clouds with lightning flashes and low thunder. the sky is in turmoil.}

<D>__{when will the stream be aweary of flowing under my eye?}
<A>__{lightning flash... thunder roll. the clouds are mingling and scattering.}
<C>__{merrick }
<D>__{when will the wind be aweary of blowing over the sky?}
<A>__{the clouds erupt, pushed onward and onward... they slowly begin to calm as... they turn slowly into... elephants linked trunk to tail moving slowly away from us...}

<D>__{when will the clouds be aweary of fleeting?}
<A>__{the elephants are calmer than the skies we saw... they keep moving onward and onward...}

<D>__{when will the heart be aweary of beating....}
<A>__{a lacy curtain has taken the place of the sky. the elephants seem to be moving on it... into the distance.}
<C>__{merrick }
<D>__{...and nature die?}
<A>__{knock, knock sound. the curtain moves to one side wiping the elephants away with it. there is no terrified audience behind the curtain. there is only light and merrick's mother smiling a calm and benign smile.}

<D>__{never, oh! never, nothing will die; the stream flows, the wind blows, the cloud fleets, the heart beats...}
<A>__{the light grows brighter and brighter until we cannot see john's mother anymore. it almost blinds us.}
<C>__{john's mum}
<D>__{nothing will die.}
