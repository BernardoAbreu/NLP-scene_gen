<T>__{fade in from white to:}
<L>__{exterior park bench day}
<A>__{karen lies sleeping on the bench amongst the grass and trees. her eyes open and squint at the bright light. she sits up and tries to get her bearings. some hair falls into her face and she brushes it away. only then noticing that she's holding something in her hand. she opens her hand and looks down. karen's pov it's an id bracelet. a band of gold with a larger plate dangling from the middle of it. karen's hand turns it over. this time the printing reads jacob.}
<B>__{with karen}
<A>__{she chokes back the tears. we hear a panting o.s. then a woman's voice.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{you okay, honey?}
<A>__{karen looks up as we pull back. a pleasant looking woman, no longer a mutant, is walking her cute dog. she looks sincerely concerned. karen nods.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{yes. i'm alright.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{i've never seen you around. are you new in town?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{sort of.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{well then...}
<P>__{(she smiles)}
<D>__{welcome to springwood.}
<A>__{the woman continues on her way. karen sighs and puts the bracelet on her wrist. she stands and our shot pulls up and away as the pretty young girl starts walking through a town she's never seen except in her dreams.}
