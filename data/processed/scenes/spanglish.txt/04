<A>__{as cristina, six years old and adorable, waits patiently to step down. she sees her mother and grins and waves excitedly, digging into her little pack to pull out an english book which she displays with pride. now she steps down from the bus and, as she walks toward camera, narration begins. the voice is of a girl eleven years older than the child we see.}

<D>__{to princeton university's director of admissions: in considering me for a scholarship you have asked for, and have every reason to expect, an essay from me about myself. and, as a clever high school graduate, i of course realize the subtext of this essay about who i am and why i want to enter princeton, is actually to make clear to you why you should have me. i have gotten tips, from friends who have preceded me to college, that being a latina, with my grades, list of activities and relative poverty, i am as good as in if i simply do the dance and work in a word like "bipolarization" every so often. and while i love dances this dance of self is one i am afraid to master.}
