<A>__{the fiery nevada sun begins its ascent into the sky. maurice looks bad. he's breathing heavy as he moves up a steep incline by the side of the road. his feet slide on the loose dirt. maurice looks like he could collapse at any moment. he makes it to the indentation in the hillside just enough room to lay down in the shade. maurice lays out slowly. he pries off his sneakers, band aids and blisters cover every inch of his feet. maurice dumps the sand out of his sneakers and painfully pulls them back on. his eyes close as he tries to unbutton his jacket... too late he's asleep. maurice's bed is a rock that juts from the side of the hill... first we see nothing, then some grains of sand escape from the crack where the rock meets the hillside. the crack becomes slightly larger pulling away from the hill by a fraction of an inch. it stabilizes there. maurice unaware of his precarious situation sleeps twenty five feet above the ground.}
