<L>__{into his mouth and down his throat, ending near his stomach.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{look at that.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{what is it i can't tell anything }
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{it's some kind of organ it's inserted some kind of tube or something down his throat.}
<C>__{hunter}
<P>__{(turning sick)}
<D>__{oh... god...}
<A>__{hunter bends over and retches.}
<C>__{roby}
<D>__{i think that's how it's getting oxygen to him.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{it doesn't make any sense. it paralyzes him... puts him into a coma... then keeps him alive.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{we can't expect to understand a life form like this. we're out of our back yard. things are different here.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{well, can't we kill it? i mean, we can't leave the damn thing on him.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{we don't know what might happen if we tried to kill it. at least right now it's keeping him alive.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{how about cutting it off? we can't pull it loose, but we can cut off everything but the bottom layer, where it's stuck to his face.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{you're right... we can't stand here and do nothing.}
<A>__{standard picks up his dusty breathing mask and pulls it over his head. then he pulls back on his bulky gloves. finally, he presses a switch and broussard slides back out of the booth.}
<C>__{standard }
<P>__{(muffled in his mask)}
<D>__{somebody give me a scalpel.}
<A>__{melkonis takes a glittering surgical blade from a slot in the wall, and carefully passes it to standard. clumsily because of the gloves, standard manipulates the knife in his hand till he has a decent grip on it. then he flicks a little button with his thumb. the scalpel begins to hum. standard advances on the parasite. the others draw back nervously. roby reaches over and draws yet a longer blade from the rack, and holds it inconspicuously at his side. standard bends over the parasite. carefully, he touches the scalpel to the extreme end of one of the tentacles, where it curves toward the back of broussard's head. effortlessly, the electronic blade slides through the alien tissue. immediately, a urine like fluid begins to flow from the wound.}
<C>__{standard }
<P>__{(muffled)}
<D>__{i've made an incision... it's not reacting... but some kind of yellowish fluid is leaking out of the wound...}
<A>__{the noxious looking liquid drips down onto the bedding next to broussard's head. instantly, it starts to hiss, and a thin stream of smoke curls up from the stain.}
<C>__{standard }
<P>__{(muffled)}
<D>__{hold it, this stuff's smoking!}
<A>__{the others react nervously. by now, the yellow fluid has eaten a hole through the bunk bed and has dripped down onto the floor below. the metal floor begins to bubble and sizzle, and more smoke rises. the men start to cough.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{god, that smoke's poisonous!}
<C>__{hunter}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{it's eating a hole in the floor!}
<A>__{abruptly, the men jostle their way out of the room and huddle in the corridor outside, coughing their lungs out. standard, who is masked, remains. frantically, he attempts to put a bandage on the wound, but the fluid instantly melts the bandage, and in the process, some of the stuff gets on standard's gloves. they begin to smoke. frantically standard leaps back, pulling off the smouldering gloves. then he runs out into the corridor and yanks off his mask.}
