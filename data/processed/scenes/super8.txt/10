<A>__{darkness. then a door opens. it's detective hathaway (played by martin), in silhouette. he enters. it's an old warehouse, dirty, cobwebbed, crowded with crates, old machinery, chemical barrels and junk. the detective turns on his flashlight aims it sweeps it across the space the light hitting the lens for a moment. the detective walks through the spooky, dark space. a low, growling industrial drone makes the whole place oddly creepy. then: a sound quick but strange slithering and the detective aims his flashlight tense. he watches. waits. we see where he's aiming the light, which cuts through thick dust in the air. it's an old office door, ajar. hathaway is still. nervous. watching the door waiting for it to open... and then from the darkness behind him a terrifying open mouthed zombie appears attacks and the detective turns his flashlight knocked to the ground and hathaway falls too the wild eyed gaping mouthed zombie drooling as it tries to bite hathaway's flesh we recognize that the zombie is cary. actually, not a bad performance. the detective pulls out his gun but the zombie grabs his wrist they wrestle with the gun the zombie wanting to rip into hathaway's neck but hathaway sees three sharp tipped nails sticking out of an old piece of wooden crate and after a significant struggle, hathaway pushes the zombie back so his head is impaled by the nails which we see enter his skull!!! the zombie (stuck to the crate via the nails) screams and dies and just at hathaway catches his breath the image dims and freezes; the projector has just been stopped. we are in:}
