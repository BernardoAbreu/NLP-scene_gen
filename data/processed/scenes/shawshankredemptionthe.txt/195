<L>__{int red's cell night (1966)}
<A>__{red sits in the dark, a bundle of nerves, trying to hold himself still. he feels like he might scream or shake to pieces. the seconds tick by, each an eternity.}
<C>__{red }
<D>__{i have had some long nights in stir. alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts, time can draw out like a blade...}
<A>__{a flash of lightning outside his window sends harsh barred shadows jittering across the cell. a storm breaking.}
<C>__{red }
<D>__{that was the longest night of my life...}
