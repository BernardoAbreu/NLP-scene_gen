<L>__{interior mozart's workroom day 1780's}
<A>__{it is littered with manuscripts. in the middle stands a billiard table. the beautiful closing ensemble from act iv of figaro: ah, tutti contenti! saremo cosi plays in the background. standing at the billiard table, mozart is dreamily hearing the music and playing shots on the table. from time to time he drifts over to a piece of manuscript paper and jots down notes. he is very much in his own world of composition and the billiard balls are an aid to creation. presently, however, we hear a knocking at the door.}

<P>__{(outside the door)}
<D>__{wolfi! wolfgang!}
<A>__{the music breaks off.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{he opens the door.}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{there's a young girl to see you.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{what does she want?}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{well, ask her!}
<C>__{constanze}
<D>__{she won't talk to me. she says she has to speak to you.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{oh, damn!}
