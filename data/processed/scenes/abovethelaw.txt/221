<C>__{voice }
<D>__{not even you can hit him at this range, nico.}
<A>__{o.s. behind nico: the unmistakable sound of a .safety being clicked off. nico freezes, his back to the voice. he raises his hands.}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{that wasn't the plan, nelson.}
<B>__{nelson fox}
<A>__{covers nico from behind with a silencer fitted .45. he glances to the briefcase and building plans, on the floor.}
