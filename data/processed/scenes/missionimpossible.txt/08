<C>__{phelps }
<D>__{beyond charles bridge there is our embassy. see it? tomorrow night, if anything goes wrong, this guy will steal the names of our agents in every country all over eastern europe. up for grabs to the highest bidders third world terrorists, arms dealers, drug lords any and everybody who'd love to get rid of long term coverts like us, and some very dear friends among them. if they're exposed, they'll be executed. come over here. take a lock at this.}
<A>__{claire, who is working at a computer, has pulled up a quicktime video image in a box on her screen. in it, an old edition of the mclaughlin report, the pbs news show, is playing. ethan is distracted by it. insert television senator waltzer, a bearded, bespectacled man in his forties, is holding forth:}
<C>__{senator waltzer}
<D>__{i will go you one further. i say the cia and all its shadow organizations have become irrelevant at best and unconstitutional at worst. it's time we throw a little light on the whole concept of the pentagon's "black budget." these covert agency subgroups have confidential funding, they report to no one who are these people?! we were living in a democracy the last time i checked.}
