<L>__{exterior countryside day}
<A>__{his countenance grim, arthur gallops along a trail bordering a plowed field when in it a scarecrow moves. it starts to run as stick wielding farmers pursue it. it is merlin. arthur turns off into the field, and at the sight of an armored knight on a war horse, the farmers turn and flee. merlin stops to catch his breath.}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{i should have left you to fend for yourself.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{i had to weave a little enchantment on the bees so i could get some honey, and i didn't feel up to using any more magic just yet. anyway, i was in less danger than you'll be in today.}
<A>__{arthur's hand is clenched tight around excalibur's hilt.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{so you were stealing their honey. they should have killed you.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{come now. so much anger for such a little crime? are you sure there is nothing else troubling you?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you know full well there is, and i go to meet it now. come witness my revenge.}
<A>__{he offers his arm and merlin hoists himself up behind the king.}
