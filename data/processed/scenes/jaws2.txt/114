<C>__{mike}
<D>__{doug's down!}
<A>__{he sails to where doug is being carried along by the current. the inflatable is a mess shredded rubber and dead engine; the shark didn't like it.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{doug! this way!}
<A>__{doug carefully oh, so carefully strokes over to where mike and andy can pull him abroad. some of the others sail closer to get a look.}

<C>__{marge}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{so much for the rubber duck.}

<D>__{come on.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{i'm telling you, a goddamn shark ate my goddamn boat!}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{if he liked your boat, i got some sneakers he'll love.}
<A>__{there's nervous laughter from all around as they examine the remains of doug's inflatable. some of those jagged rents could be made by teeth...}
<C>__{kids}
<P>__{(ad lib)}
<D>__{...jeez what did that?... a porpoise, maybe...nah, killer whale... i think he snagged it... i hate to}
<P>__{pop his balloon... (etc.)}
<A>__{angle on mike's boat doug's inflatable is draped over the tip of one hull, forward. without warning, the shark hits. screams, terror, confusion. mike, andy, jackie into the water.}

<A>__{his head bangs on a metal fitting as the boat turns over.}
<B>__{on the group}

<B>__{confusion}
<A>__{as the following events take place: larry's red cat rams and locks onto mike's tornado. marge's boat capsizes, putting sean and marge into the drink. marge scrambles up on the over turned hull, pulling sean up with her, just in time. polo, under full sail, scoops mike out of the water before the shark can get to him. the shark dips out of sight. surface, wide over the stern of polo's boat showing the results of the turmoil:}
<B>__{angle on the survivors}
<A>__{as they make ineffectual, frightened moves towards grouping together, andy is the first to gain any composure.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{raft up! raft 'em up!}
<A>__{he reaches towards a drifting line, and pulls timmy's doughdish towards them, tying it off as it comes close.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{tie off to your strongest pointerior}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{anyone need an extra line?}
<A>__{polo has mike and timmy aboard his boat. timmy is looking up from examining mike's dazed body.}

<D>__{mike's bleeding!}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{can you sail?}
<C>__{polo}
<P>__{(testing his rudder)}
<D>__{yeah! we'll take him in!}
<A>__{he starts to make sail back towards the lighthouse, on a severe, but manageable tack. polo, timmy, and the injured mike sail towards safety, leaving the others behind. tackle the job at hand, concentrating on survival. jackie is strangely quiet; things are out of control...}
