<A>__{xander does the only thing he can. he puts the car sideways and aims out the window as he slides to a stop. slovo turns and blam! xander shoots slovo right in the chest. in slo mo: a spray of blood erupts from his chest and slovo falls backwards, his face frozen in a look of shock and betrayal. the smoking shell clatters to the ground. slovo blinks up at xander, gasping for words, then lays still. xander hops out, rifles through slovo's pockets. the other anarchy 99 cars pull up, the whole group looking on.}
