<A>__{sits on the vinyl sofa. close on the small makeshift booklet whose cover reads, "there's a place for us" in overdone fancy cursive. the second page shows a cutout from a travel magazine of a swanky beachfront hotel. one room has been circled with the words "you and me" written next to it. below: "a time and place for us." we hear walt clearing his throat, swallowing. the third page has glued to it a postcard showing a couple hand in hand on the beach at sunset and reading, "maui is for lovers." below: take my hand and we'll soon be there. the last page has a cutout of a bouquet of flowers. it reads, "tracy, see you in paradise? love, your 'teacher' david. p.s. i really, really need you now." the booklet is lowered.}
