Simply because the mind honestly perceives that twenty-six hours are twenty-four, the body follows. And then there are sections of time. Your life can be broken down into the sections of time that formed your personality (if you have one). For instance, when I was twelve, I had an eleven minute conversation with my father that to this day defines our relationship. Now, I'm not saying that everything happened in that specific section of time, but the events of my childhood involving my father led up to, and then were crystallized in, that eleven minutes.}

Graham closes his eyes, accepting Ann's touch. She caresses him. Slowly. Delicately. She touches his arms, his face, his hair. Closing her eyes, she takes his hand and puts it against her face. She begins to lie him back on the couch. When he offers light resistance, she gently persists.}
<CHAR>__{ANN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<ACTION>__{Graham lies back, silently obeying. Ann touches his face. Gradually, her hand slips to his neck and she begins to unbutton his shirt. She watches his face, hoping that he will remain calm. He does. She rubs her hand on his chest. Once again she brings Graham's hand to her face. She moves his hand to her neck and throat, painting her skin with his fingers. Soon each hand is exploring the other. Fingers search for and find hidden areas. Ann stands. Their hands remain together, and Graham's eyes remain closed. Ann moves onto the couch with Graham. She gently lowers herself into a sitting position on his waist. She slowly moves both of her hands onto Graham's chest. They move forward and back, like a lazy tide. She looks at Graham. His face is tranquil. Ann quietly begins to move her face toward his. Soon she is hovering inches above him, her long hair touching his features. She lowers her lips to his forehead and kisses him. She waits for a negative reaction. Getting none, she moves lower and kisses his eyes. Still receiving no discouragement, she moves to his nose. A subtle movement from Graham. Ann waits for a moment. She then moves to his lips, her luxuriant tresses enveloping his face. She kisses him lightly. She kisses him again. Graham tilts his head back and she softly kisses his neck. Graham's hands make their way up Ann's back until they have reached her neck. He slowly pulls his face to hers. He kisses her. Graham is flooded with warmth and excitement. He caresses her, intoxicating himself with physical contact. The kisses become more meaningful, and the touching becomes more passionate. For a moment, Graham seems about to evaporate in a state of ecstasy, his eyes filled with relief and happiness. But his gaze happens to fall on the video camera, which continues to record. Graham seizes up and abruptly backs away from Ann's embrace. Reality slowly envelopes him.}

He walks over to the camera/recorder, trailing a mound of videotape behind him. He breaks the lens off the camera body, and smashes the inner workings against the edge of the table.

<DIAL>__{Who is it?}
<ACTION>__{A knock again. Graham sets his book down and goes to the door. He unlocks the deadbolt and opens it. Ann stands in the hallway. Graham is obviously flushed with feeling at seeing her. She wordlessly moves into the room, her movements like a slow breeze, her expression calm. Graham watches her go by. She stops in the middle of the room, her back to him. Graham moves toward her slowly. Sensing him behind her, her breathing becomes deep. Graham slowly enfolds her in his arms, his face against her hair. She closes her eyes as their fingers entwine.}
