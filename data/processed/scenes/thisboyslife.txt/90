<L>__{interior dwight and caroline's living room same night}
<A>__{(later) "the lawrence welk show" is on the television. dwight, caroline, skipper, norma and pearl and toby watch an irish tenor sing a lugubrious ballad. dwight stands in a corner of the room, his saxophone to his lips. he's playing along with the music, but silently. occasionally he gets overcome and accidentally causes the saxophone to squawk. the irish ballad ends, and lawrence welk's champagne orchestra strikes up a lively polka. dwight takes a sip of his drink and grabs caroline, pulls her to her feet, and begins to dance with her. a polka can be a decorous, contained dance. he dances caroline vigorously around the living room, out into the kitchen, around the table, and then back again. dwight is really good, and caroline matches him every step of the way. skipper turns the volume up and dwight kicks the dance into an even higher, wilder gear: the kids clap on the beat, the two whirl and stamp and spin. faster and faster caroline's heel catches an end table and sends it spinning and faster they go. caroline's head is thrown back; she's laughing with pleasure. as the music reaches its climax, dwight spins caroline back to the sofa, lets her go, and wham! she lands back where she was seated exactly on the last note of the song. amid the general laughter and applause, caroline smiles at toby.}
