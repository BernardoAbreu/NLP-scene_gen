<A>__{high angle shot of angie meandering down the street on which the neighborhood bar is located. it is near midnight, and the street is empty except for angie and the clacking of his leather heels on the pavement. he comes to the bar, opens the door, enters...}
<B>__{the bar. night.}
<A>__{the sounds of saturday night revelry are loud, coming mostly from the irish contingent of the neighborhood. they are grouped along practically the whole bar. three or four women and a number of shirtsleeved men, mostly in their late forties, early fifties. we know they're irish, because one of the younger men is chanting an auld country ballad. camera angles disclose the entrance to the bar in the background, showing angie coming in, looking here and there. he starts toward the bar.}
<B>__{near bar.}
<A>__{two irish women, middle aged, squat heavily on bar stools over their schooners of beer, gassing away at each other.}

<C>__{first irish woman}
<D>__{...going to the hospital or coming from it. she was hatching them out like eggs.}
<C>__{second irish woman}
<D>__{and that husband of hers is a skinny bit of a fellow, isn't he?}
<C>__{first irish woman}
<D>__{well, i bumped into her on the street, and she was as big as a barrel.}

<C>__{first irish woman}
<D>__{well, last week tuesday, she gave birth to the baby in saint elizabeth's hospital... a big healthy boy of nine pounds...}
<C>__{second irish woman}
<D>__{oh, that's nice. so the doctor was wrong, wasn't he?}
<C>__{first irish woman}
<D>__{oh, no! she died right in the hospital...}
<C>__{second irish woman}
<D>__{oh, that's a sad story. and her husband is that little fellow, works in peter reeves.}
<C>__{first irish woman}
<D>__{that's the one.}
<C>__{second irish woman}
<D>__{oh, that's a sad story.}
<A>__{angie has nothing better to do than give his attention to the last lines of the story. perturbed, he turns and leaves.}

<A>__{with street noises over the scene, marty and clara walk along through the intricate understructure of the elevated subway toward webster avenue.}
<B>__{street.}
<A>__{marty and clara walk slowly along a side street in marty's neighborhood. the streets are almost empty; perhaps an occasional pedestrian on the other side of the street. the cars are parked bumper to bumper in lines along the curb. the five story apartment buildings are mostly dark, an occasional window lit. marty suddenly stops and bends down; his shoe lace has become untied. clara sits back against the fender of the nearest car and continues talking.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{...it's really a fine opportunity for me. but i'm not sure i want to be a department head. it's mostly executive and administrative work. well, anyway, i told you about my father, and he depends on me a great deal, and...}

<C>__{marty}
<D>__{i think you're kidding yourself, clara. i used to think about moving out, you know? and that's what i used to say. "my mother needs me." but when you really get down to it, that ain't it at all. actually, you need your father. you know what i mean? you're living at home, and you got your father and mother there, and you can go on like that being a little girl all your life.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{i'm afraid of being lonely.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{oh, you won't be so lonely. you'll make friends right away.}
<C>__{clara}
<D>__{actually, i don't make friends easily.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{what're you talking about? you're a real likeable person. you'll make friends out there in portchester one, two, three. you'll have people visiting you alla time. i will come visit you. i will borrow my brother freddie's car, or you can call me up when you feel blue, or i will call you up. and it's gonna be nice. don't be so afraid.}
<A>__{they have only gone a few paces farther when marty's shoelace comes loose again. he fidgets self consciously, bends down and begins to retie it. the voice of ralph, the well dressed man, established previously, is heard.}
