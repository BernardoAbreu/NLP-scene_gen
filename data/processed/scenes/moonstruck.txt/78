<L>__{exterior lincoln center plaza night}
<A>__{lincoln center loretta's pov crowds of people in beautiful clothes fill the plaza created by the three great buildings. a glorious fountain filled with lights forms the centerpiece. behind the fountain, grand and splendidly lit, is the magical metropolitan opera house. two huge chagalls, one to the right and one to the left, inhabit the face of the building, filling it with marvelous color.}
<B>__{loretta comes to the fountain}
<A>__{the fountain is quiet and dark now. loretta is puzzled. she remembers that it was going. while she looks, it lights up. then small jets of water begin to appear. then larger jets. then with a roar the central shaft of water rises high, higher into the night sky. she follows the column of water with her eyes up into the sky. right above the crest of the water, like a beanball on a seal's nose, is the moon. from over loretta's shoulder we see the rushing water forming an opaque wall before her. then the fountain, for its next piece of aquatic choreography, drops away to nothing quite suddenly. and there, facing loretta, on the opposite side of the fountain, is ronny. he's looking incredibly handsome and dashing in a tuxedo and topcoat and, of course, gloves. he smiles slightly and raises a hand in greeting. loretta, caught off guard, smiles brilliantly at him. then she remembers her situation and starts to put on her usual serious expression. but the fountain has rushed up into the sky again, obscuring her attempt at composure from, ronny. ronny comes into view again, walking toward loretta around the fountain's perimeter. he comes close to her.}
