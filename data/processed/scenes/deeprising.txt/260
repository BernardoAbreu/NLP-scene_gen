<A>__{finnegan turns as the dance floor and the d.j. booth explode as something rises up from below them. his eyes widen. and there it is the huge, horrible, mutated, mucus covered, sucker faced head of the creature. a giant mutated protoplasm. jutting up from a breach in the floor. the trunk of the creature, the part where all the tentacles come from, is below the next deck. a slimy, translucent membrane slowly rises, revealing what appears to be some sort of organic liquid eye. it seems to stare right at finnegan, who is transfixed by the sight. a tentacle slowly starts to move in on finnegan. finnegan starts making his way around the shattered debris that blocks his shot. the eyeball type organism follows him. another tentacle starts to move. silently undulating through the water towards finnegan. the membrane over the eye moves. and another tentacle starts to close in for the kill. they are surrounding finnegan. finnegan comes around the shattered d.j. booth. faces the creature full on. he can't miss. he gives it a wicked smile.}

<A>__{in slow motion, finnegan lifts his pulse rifle. it drips water. he jams the gun butt into his hip. takes aim fires! but he only gets off one quick burst before a tentacle lashes out and grabs him. jerks him into the air. his pulse rifle goes flying. finnegan is being dragged toward the hole into the floor, and the death that awaits him. he struggles to free himself as the hole looms closer, closer. he is about to disappear down the hole of no return, when his hand comes up with his knife. he slashes the tentacle in two, scrambles up and heads for an open door. as he reaches the door, a tentacle rises up in front of him. huge. blocking his way. it's maw opens wide. a terrifying sight of jaws and teeth and death. about to devour him. as it strikes forward, finnegan draws his shotgun, and blasts the vile thing to smithereens. he bolts through the door, several tentacles already after him.}
