<L>__{exterior camden street night}
<A>__{at the far end of town marion, gabriel, billings, dalton, scott and several other men slip through the shadows into an alley. the lights from the ball shine from down the street and the musical strains of a minuet drift to them through the night.}
<L>__{exterior armory night}
<A>__{a block like building on the far edge of town. a pair of redcoats stand guard. a pair of drunken redcoats stagger out of a side street, singing a mumbling song. the redcoat guards look at the drunk redcoats enviously.}
<C>__{redcoat guard}
<D>__{hey, what you got there?}
<A>__{the drunken redcoats look up, bringing their faces into the light the drunken redcoats are billings and dalton.}
<C>__{billings}
<D>__{we got our own little party...}
<C>__{dalton}
<D>__{to hell with the officers and their fancy dress ball...}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{give us a nip, here.}
<A>__{billings and dalton walk over to the redcoats guards. as the guards reach for the bottles, billings slams one of the guards back against the building... dalton draws a knife and plunges it into the second guard's belly and hacks him open... dalton shoves billings out of the way, slits the other guard's throat. billings is taken aback by the speed and ferocity of dalton's attack... marion and scott duck into the shadows of the doorway, pull out hammer less carving chisels and quickly and silently start gouging out the wood around the hinges of the heavy door. billings and dalton take the posts of the guards while the other men drag the bodies of the real guards out of sight. everything appears as it should.}
