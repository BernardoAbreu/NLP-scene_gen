<A>__{duke and gonzo sit on the revolving platform. gonzo stares glassy eyed coming apart.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{i hate to say this, but this place is getting to me. i think i'm getting the fear.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{nonsense. we came here to find the american dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. you must realize that we've found the main nerve.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{that's what gives me the fear.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{look over there. two women fucking a polar bear.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{please, don't tell me those things... not now.}
<P>__{(signals the waitress for two wild turkeys)}
<D>__{this is my last drink. how much money can you lend me?}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{not much. why?}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{i have to go.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{go?}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{yes. leave the country. tonight.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{calm down. you'll be straight in a few hours.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{no. this is serious. one more hour in this town and i will kill somebody!}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{ok. i will lend you some money. let's go outside and see how much we have left.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{can we make it?}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{that depends on how many people we fuck with between here and the door.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{i want to leave fast.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{ok. lets pay this bill and get up very slowly. it's going to be a long walk.}
<P>__{(signals waitress who comes over)}
<C>__{gonzo}
<P>__{(suddenly to waitress)}
<D>__{do they pay you to screw that bear?}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{he's just kidding.}
<P>__{(to gonzo)}
<D>__{come on, doc lets go downstairs and gamble.}
<A>__{gonzo trembles with fear walks to the edge of the turntable.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{when does this thing stop?}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{it won't stop. it's not ever going to stop.}
<A>__{duke carefully steps off the turntable. gonzo, eyes staring blindly ahead, squiting in fear and confusion, rooted to the spot, is carried away.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{don't move you'll come around.}
<A>__{duke reaches out to grab gonzo, who jumps back keeps going around. the bartender narrows his eyes at them. duke steps onto the merry go round hurries round the bar approaching gonzo from the blind side and shoves gonzo from behind. gonzo goes down with a hellish scream. duke approaches him with his hands in the air. smiling.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{you fell. let's go.}
<A>__{gonzo refuses to move and stands tense, fists clenched, looking for somebody to hit...an old woman perhaps?}
<C>__{duke }
<D>__{ok. you stay here and go to jail. i'm leaving.}
<A>__{duke walks fast towards the stairs. gonzo catches up with him.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{did you see that? some sonofabitch kicked me in the back.}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{probably the bartender. he wanted to stomp you for what you said to the waitress.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{good god! let's get out of here! where's the elevator?}
<C>__{duke}
<P>__{(turning him in the opposite direction)}
<D>__{don't go near that elevator. that's just what they want us to do... trap us in a steel box and take us down to the basement.}
