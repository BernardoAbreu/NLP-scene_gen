<L>__{interior underground parking garage}
<A>__{pov: squid tape of iris' death. quick barrages of the savage imagery interspersed with bursts of static... ... until tick slips off the trodes. he's been totaled by what he's seen.}
<C>__{tick}
<D>__{whoa. that is one unbelievable piece of eyefuck.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{skip the art criticism, tick, what can you tell me about the wearer.}
<C>__{tick}
<D>__{well... the guy's fucked up.}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{we know that, tick.}
<C>__{tick}
<D>__{no, i mean the killer's got some kind of distortion in his visual cortex. the color and gray scale values are all messed up, like color blindness.}
<A>__{he gives the tape a fast run through his processing equipment.}
<C>__{tick}
<D>__{lookit, you see the peak period ratios there? could be some kind of tumor or brain lesion or something. some kind of trauma}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{this is not good. i don't like this at all...}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tick}
<D>__{well, it's cutting awful close to me. i mean she was just here.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{who was just here?}
<C>__{tick}
<D>__{iris, man. pay attention.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{wait, wait... wait a minute. iris was here?!}
<C>__{tick}
<D>__{yeah, she came by last night. shaking like a junkie, wanting me to make a copy of some clip.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{what clip? what was it?}
<C>__{tick}
<D>__{i don't know, man, she wouldn't let me see it. said i wouldn't want to see it. she said she was going to give it to you to hold for her. like insurance or somethin'}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{she never gave me a tape.}
<C>__{mace}
<P>__{(to lenny)}
<D>__{think back about what she said. exactly what she said.}
<C>__{lenny}
<P>__{(revved up)}
<D>__{she wanted to go out to my car, something about my car...}
<C>__{mace}
<D>__{something in your car...}
<A>__{lenny and mace swap a look: oh shit.}
