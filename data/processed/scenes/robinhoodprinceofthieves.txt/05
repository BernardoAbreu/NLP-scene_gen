<L>__{interior sewers night}
<A>__{they wade through foul water up to their waists. the saracen leads... a snake lashes out for his face. robin lops off its head.}
<C>__{saracen}
<D>__{you are fast, my friend.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{five years i've waited for the smell of free air. that makes a man fast.}
<A>__{guards drop down from above, carrying torches. blocking the way.}
<C>__{saracen}
<D>__{you will need to be yet faster.}
<A>__{a narrow opening to their left... they splash through. half running, half crawling in the dank water. fire arrows land around them. the orange smoke is choking.}
<C>__{saracen}
<D>__{poison air. hold your breath.}
<A>__{flames illuminate the walls, alive with a loathsome mass of crawling slime. peter falls. a pursuer descends on him, thrusting a blazing torch at his face. the saracen intercepts the blow. grabs the man's neck, snapping it with one mighty twist.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(coughing)}
<D>__{thanks. i misjudged you.}
<C>__{saracen}
<D>__{save your breath.}
<A>__{gasping for air, they find the tunnel veers steeply down ward. a slippery, granite tube. losing purchase, they slide headlong. sharp, rusted spikes jut out from the walls ahead. robin grabs at the walls to break the fall. no use. they're picking up speed. he turns his sword crossways, bracing it against the sides of the tunnel, as a brake. sparks fly. the sword cuts into robin's chest... but it works.}
<C>__{saracen}
<D>__{allah be praised.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{amen, brother.}
<A>__{a bloodcurdling scream. a pursuing guard tumbles down the sewer chute. the three men press themselves against the wall. the man hurtles by... is impaled on the spikes. a draft of fresh air from the roof of the tunnel. using the spiked guard as a ladder, robin climbs. removes a grating.}
