<A>__{gru makes his way to work on foot: he strolls down the sidewalk. he passes a mailman and gives him a high five.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{high five!}
<A>__{then a policeman, with whom he exchanges mimed gunfire. then a nun, with whom he bumps rumps.}
<C>__{gru }
<D>__{bump it.}
<A>__{seeing something offscreen, gru gasps. he stops traffic so a happy family of ducks can cross the street. he plays ultimate frisbee with a bunch of college kids, balancing the spinning disc on his pointy nose. he joins a group of old ladies doing tai chi. he "air" drums with a couple of bucket drummers on the curb. he picks a flower, then walks by a man and a woman sitting alone with their backs to each other at a cafe. he quickly turns their chairs around so they find each other and hands the man the flower for the woman. they smile and gru goes his merry way.}
