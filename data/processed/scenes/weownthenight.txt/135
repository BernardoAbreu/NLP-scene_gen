<A>__{the line of police and relatives now heap dirt onto the coffin, which is in the ground. bobby and joseph silently lead the line, shoveling dirt and moving on. rosario moves behind them. bobby sees: beyond the cemetary grounds: teenagers have climbed the trees. and they're laughing at the spectacle. michael stands next to bobby. a beat, then bobby speaks in a way that's preoccupied. almost as if the words are more for himself than for mike:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{i can't live like this no more, mike... they destroyed my family.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{there's a deal going down, i... i wanna help...}
<C>__{michael solo}
<D>__{you're a civilian, bobby. ain't no way.}
<A>__{bobby leans closer, more focused:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{i, i could join you.}
<A>__{michael turns to him, surprised.}
<C>__{bobby green }
<D>__{my pop tol' me you pull guys outta the academy, guys with special knowledge, [and] make `em cops? you could do that.}
<C>__{michael solo}
<D>__{bobby, come on you got your own life to live }
<C>__{bobby green}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{no. i can't do nothing else now.}
<A>__{a beat, as mike ponders. then:}
<C>__{michael solo}
<D>__{then you gotta understand this ain't something you do just for a vendetta. you gotta go back to the academy when you're done, you gotta commit yourself.}
<A>__{bobby looks at his brother, then back to mike.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{michael solo}
<D>__{gimme a couple days i will talk to the p.c.}
<A>__{bobby again eyes joseph, who stands over the grave wiping his eyes with a handkerchief. he walks over to him, puts his arm around him. into his ear:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{joe, i'm gonna join you. i just decided...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{okay?}
<A>__{joseph looks at him for a moment, nods subtly. then he looks back into the grave.}
<C>__{bobby green }
<D>__{this is where i belong...}
<A>__{angle back on bobby, as he spots rosario, who stares right back at him. he's going to have to tell her his decision. a line of policemen in white gloves begins to fire rifles into the air. five shots...}
