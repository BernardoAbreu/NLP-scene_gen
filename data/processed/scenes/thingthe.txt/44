<A>__{debris and wood flush down on him. the receding ceiling had been blocking the door from above. he brushes his coat and shines the light upwards. the ceiling is a shambles. he then shines the light deeper into the room.}

<A>__{dr. copper is playing the small tape recorder. a casual norwegian voice drones on as if making notes. he fast forwards. the same casual drone.}

<D>__{copper, come here!!}
<L>__{interior room}
<A>__{dr. copper enters, squeezing in, through the door. the wood cracks overhead. more debris comes falling down.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{careful. it's about to go.}
<A>__{copper dusts himself. macready stands before a huge block of ice. fifteen feet long. six feet wide. four feet tall. it has partially melted, but its thawing process has been stopped by the now freezing temperatures within the outpost. its one curious feature: the middle has been thawed and scooped out. giving it the appearance of a large bathtub. the two men study it uncomprehendingly. macready's gaze turns to a large metal cabinet at his left. he moves for a closer look. several photographs are pasted to its door. small snapshots of the norwegians at work and play. he tries to open it. stuck. the partially caved in ceiling is slightly blocking the top of the door. he tries again, careful not to dislodge the wood and plaster above. bits of dust float down.}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<D>__{watch it.}
<A>__{his grip is too strong. it gives suddenly, unexpectedly. the large metal door flies open. large chunks splash from the ceiling. they come thumping to the floor, behind and in front of the open cabinet door. macready coughs and waves away the dust. he peers inside. nothing much. some empty shelves. some small scientific gear. his flashlight then locates a large photograph taped to the inside of the cabinet door. it is a picture of five norwegians, arm in arm, all smiles, toasting each other. they are on either side of the frozen block of ice, pridefully displaying it for the camera. the block looks much thicker. its interior opaque. macready looks to the block of ice and then back to the photograph. he untapes it, pockets it and shuts the door. an armless corpse swings into his face from behind the closing door. dislodged from the ceiling, the body and macready go crashing to the floor.}
