<C>__{the president}
<D>__{captain, i want you to maintain contact with those ships. do nothing until i order otherwise. is that clear?}
<C>__{captain }
<D>__{yes, mr. president. contact only.}
<A>__{he hangs up, turns to kenny.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{i hope you're right.}
<L>__{exterior south lawn day}
<A>__{kenny, bobby and the president make their way across the lawn, out of earshot of the building.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what happened to speak when spoken to?}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{give it a rest. you were thinking the same thing, just didn't have the guts to take the heat.}
<A>__{bobby likes getting under kenny's skin. bobby aims a punch at his head which kenny knocks away. the president changes gear, serious.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{we can horsetrade with khruschev on ships. but it doesn't get us any closer to removing those missiles.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{have to hope it's a signal that he'll back down on the real issue too.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{we're going to have to stop a ship eventually, show the quarantine's got teeth, or we'll prove mccone right.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{mcnamara's on his way back here now. we need to pick the right ship. no subs. no armed boarding parties either. we need a little more time to figure this one out.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{then let's move the quarantine line.}
<A>__{it's a simple suggestion. the president considers him a beat, and then mcnamara emerges from the white house, heads for them. the three friends assume their more reserved, political faces as he comes up.}
<C>__{mcnamara}
<D>__{mr. president. bobby. kenny. the essex battle group has the gagarin, kimovsk and the sub escort under their thumb. we've got a few hours now before we need to worry about any more flashpoints on the line.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we could use a few more hours. i think we should consider moving the quarantine line back to 500 miles.}
<A>__{bobby and the president look at kenny like he's some kind of svengali. kenny just stands there, poker faced.}
