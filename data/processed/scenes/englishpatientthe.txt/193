<D>__{had a letter from my wife. the wisteria is still out, which i'm looking forward to. she says dorset is gripped with invasion fever. wrong coast i should have thought, still...}

<D>__{bermann thinks he'll be interned, poor fellow. i'm going to do what i can, but... and d'ag turns out to be a great admirer of mussolini. so now you can say i told you so.}
<C>__{almasy}
<D>__{i told you so.}
<C>__{madox}
<D>__{we didn't care about countries. did we? brits, arabs, hungarians, germans. none of that mattered, did it? it was something finer than that.}
<C>__{almasy}
<D>__{yes. it was. thanks for the compass. i will look after it for you.}
<C>__{madox}
<P>__{(shrugging this off)}
<D>__{when's clifton picking you up?}
<C>__{almasy}
<D>__{tomorrow afternoon. don't worry. i will be ready.}
<C>__{madox}
<D>__{i will leave the plane in the hangar at kufra oasis. so if you need it...hard to know how long one's talking about. we might all be back in a month or two.}
<A>__{madox kneels and takes a handful of sand, puts it into his pocket. he throws his haversack into the plane then turns. almasy puts out a hand. this is a moment of great emotional weight for them both, conducted as if nothing were happening.}
<C>__{madox}
<D>__{i have to teach myself not to read too much into everything. comes of too long having to read so much into hardly anything at all.}
<C>__{almasy}

<C>__{madox}
<D>__{may god make safety your companion.}
<C>__{almasy}
<P>__{(a tradition)}
<D>__{there is no god.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{but i hope someone looks after you.}
<A>__{madox clambers into his plane, then remembers something, jabs at his throat.}
<C>__{madox}
<D>__{in case you're still wondering this is called the supasternal notch.}
<A>__{almasy nods, goes to the propeller.}
<C>__{madox}
<D>__{come and visit us in dorset. when all this nonsense is over.}
<P>__{(then shrugs)}
<D>__{you'll never come to dorset.}
<A>__{the plane roars into life. almasy watches it taxi away then heads back to continue with his packing up.}
