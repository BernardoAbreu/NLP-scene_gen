<L>__{exterior train station platform day}
<A>__{kell and emma on the platform, garza hovering nearby, crowds swarming around them as boarding calls come over the p.a. system. kell is looking around, anxious. nick appears on the platform, hurrying. they see him. emma runs, throws herself into nick's arms as he crouches.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{i wanna see sarah...}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{hey, hey...she's fine, don't be scared. that's not allowed. and there's no reason for it.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{this sucks.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{why do we have to go?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{'cause your mom wants to see a few broadway shows. you gonna begrudge her that?}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{you're kinda full of shit, dad.}
<A>__{nick's taken aback not sure whether to laugh. he trades a look with kell, who's too tense with worry to care.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{okay, you're right. maybe i am a little. but only a little. the part you can believe is that this is all going to be fine. sarah, us.}
<P>__{(directed at kell)}
<D>__{i mean it. okay?}
<C>__{emma}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{she detaches from her father. nick rises to kell, pulls an envelope, hands it to her...}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no credit cards. too easy to track. meals, hotel, whatever pay cash.}
<A>__{...then takes her cell, swaps it for royce's...}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i will keep this. it can be traced. use this one instead. don't answer unless you see it's me.}
<C>__{p.a. voice}
<C>__{final boarding call for new york}
<D>__{city direct, final call...}
<C>__{kell}
<D>__{anything else?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i love you.}
<C>__{kell}
<D>__{emma's right. this sucks.}
<A>__{she embraces him, fears and emotions swirling.}
<C>__{kell}
<D>__{be goddamn careful.}
<A>__{she breaks the embrace. nick stands, watching them get on the train. the doors close. the train starts out... nick turns. garza's been watching a look of sympathy for what nick's going through...}
