<L>__{interior tudor's apartment morning}
<A>__{in his bathroom, nick tudor cleans his teeth with the water pick as usual. the sounds of janine bustling about with breakfast filter into the bathroom. tudor hums tunelessly. suddenly, he doubles over in a soundless spasm of pain. the water pick writhes in the sink, shooting water on to the mirror and over the floor. after a moment he straightens up and begins to press around the area of his navel, obviously looking for lumps which it seems from his expression he has already found and is overly familiar with. the water pick continues to rattle around in the sink. janine pokes her head around the corner to investigate. tudor tries to cover up, grabs the water pick, and begins to work on his teeth again, hiding the occasional twinge that hits him.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{you say something?}
<C>__{tudor}
<D>__{nope. damned thing wriggled out of my hands. that's all.}
<A>__{janine waits for tudor to say something else. he ignores her.}
<C>__{janine}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{you sure you're ok, nick?}
<A>__{tudor continues to ignore her. janine sighs in a very obvious way and disappears. tudor waits for a second, turns off the water pick, then checks out his stomach again.}
