<A>__{the camera moves, and is picked up, following a spider as it moves across the floor. it crawls up onto the side of the bed, then onto the sheets. andrew's finger points at it. the spider is telekinetically lifted into the air. it hangs struggling there for a moment, then becomes rigid. he spreads his fingers, and the spider abruptly separates into all of its component parts. they stop moving, hanging lifeless. andrew's home phone rings, and he drops the spider. rings again.}
