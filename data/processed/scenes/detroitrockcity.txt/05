<B>__{opening title sequence}
<A>__{"rock 'n' roll all nite" blasts the way it's supposed to sound. the jammin' kiss classic is accompanied by a barrage of quick cuts depicting kiss mania. tv appearances. concert footage. magazine covers. comic books. posters. art work. kiss merchandise, dolls, lunch boxes, clothes, etc. we see the band do their thing in authentic clips from real shows. gene, paul, ace, and peter shouting it out loud. the montage is a colorful, kick ass kaleidoscope of the entire kiss phenomena. cut to : the beat of this seminal anthem. the final image is the kiss "destroyer" poster.}
