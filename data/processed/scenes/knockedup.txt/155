<A>__{dr. kuni and ben come back into the room.}
<C>__{dr. kuni}
<D>__{alison, i apologize for being a little brash, but if you're okay with it, it's rather important we break the bag and give you some medicine to speed things up. because once the bag is broken, i don't want there to be an infection.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{whatever. do what you have to do.}
<A>__{dr. kuni exits.}
<C>__{alison }
<P>__{(whispering to ben)}
<D>__{oh, my god. what a nightmare that guy is. knocked up 130.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i know, i know. look, i talked to him. i think he'll be more cool now.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{i'm so sorry i broke up with you.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you really don't need to be. and you know, i knew you'd give me another shot. i figured it'd be a lot sooner than this, you know?}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{i was just in such a panic from all of this. and watching debbie and pete together, and my ass got so fat.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no, no.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{it did. i just never, for one minute, thought that the guy who got me pregnant would actually be the right guy for me.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{me neither.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{i guess he is.}
