<L>__{exterior city streets dusk}
<A>__{a series of shots of bums, "homeless persons", hanging out, in alleys, in the doorways of old buildings, sitting on the sidewalk in front of liquor stores. then we see duncan, alone but looking no different from the others. he is panhandling passersby, without much success. we see him fall into a fit of coughing that incapacitates him for several seconds. he's obviously getting sicker. we lose sight of duncan as our montage continues. we see clifford talking to a bum, then another. he is passing the time combing the streets in the neighborhood of the bar. park dusk a handful of bums are sitting together on the grass passing a bottle in a brown paper bag. duncan is not among them, but cheater is there, sitting at the end of the line. camera pans from one bum to the next as the bottle is passed. by the time it gets to cheater, it is empty. cheater looks as if he's about to cry like a baby when a hand enters the frame from the other side the hand holding out to cheater a full bottle of wine. cheater takes the bottle and looks up gratefully... to see john clifford standing beside him.}
<C>__{cheater}
<D>__{well! i can't say much for your protocol, but your timing's dead on. here's to you, pardner.}
<A>__{cheater takes a long drink, then passes the bottle back down the line.}
