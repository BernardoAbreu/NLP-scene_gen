<L>__{interior fogg's asylum evening}
<A>__{a cacophony of madness. the ragged inmates of the asylum are slammed together in a series of cramped cells, the low ceiling pressing down. we discover anthony, dressed as a fashionable wigmaker, walking past the cells with the odious mr. fogg. fogg carries a large pair of scissors.}
<C>__{fogg}
<D>__{... oh yes, sir, i agree it would be to our mutual interest to come to some arrangement in regard to my poor children's hair.}
<A>__{he moves to one of the cells and unlocks it:}
<C>__{fogg}
<D>__{i keep the blondes over here. it was yellow hair you was looking for, sir?}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{fogg goes into the crowded cell the inmates, all blonde women, scurry back, clearly terrified of fogg. anthony sees johanna, wearing a filthy straitjacket, hunched like a feral animal, cowering in a corner of the cell.}

<D>__{that one has hair the shade i need.}
<A>__{fogg goes to fetch johanna, hauls her to anthony:}

<P>__{(prepares scissors)}
<D>__{now, where shall i cut?}
<A>__{before fogg can react anthony pulls a revolver from his clothing, grabs johanna and pushes fogg back into the cell. he swings the cell door shut, locking fogg in.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{not a word, mr. fogg, or it will be your last ... now, i leave you to the mercy of your "children."}
<A>__{he grabs johanna and pulls her away. mr. fogg turns. he is locked in with the blonde inmates. they slowly begin to advance on him. menacing. it is likely they are going to rip him limb from limb...}
