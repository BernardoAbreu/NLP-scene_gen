<L>__{exterior cliff day}
<A>__{very carefully, but standing this time, chuck makes his way across the ledge.}
<L>__{exterior summit day}
<A>__{he emerges on the top, takes a drink from a hand made canteen, and looks in all directions. again, he sees nothing but ocean.}
<L>__{exterior beach day}
<A>__{he resumes his efforts at fishing. a shape scuttles raggedly beneath him.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{a crab, it's a crab.}
<A>__{he freezes, holding his spear motionless. then he jabs at the crab misses! the crab scurries away toward the rocks.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{dammit!}
<A>__{chuck splashes after it, stabbing as he goes, falling, getting up, stabbing again. suddenly one stab feels different. chuck carefully lifts up the spear. on the end is a squirming crab.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i did it. i did it!}
<A>__{he walks carefully with it to the beach. lowering the spear, he lets the crab slip off. it darts toward the water. chuck heads it off, trying to avoid the snapping claws. he kicks it back toward the beach, then slams a rock down on it. he twists off a crab claw, expecting to see flaky white meat. but a crab has an exoskeleton. the flesh simply pours out, like mucous.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{jesus.}
<A>__{this is too much. he needs the next step, from the raw to the cooked. the crucial next step from primitive man to the beginnings of civilization.}
