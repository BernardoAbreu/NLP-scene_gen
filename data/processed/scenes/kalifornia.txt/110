<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i read there are a lot of them out west, mostly in the desert. they say if you know what you're doing, you can travel anywhere in the universe in a matter of seconds. wouldn't that come in handy?}
<A>__{brian looks at him blankly. he can't think of a thing to say in response. early walks toward the entrance of the bar. brian joins him.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{by the way, i'm not much of a pool player.}

<A>__{they both laugh and enter the bar. carrie's motel room same time adele is sitting in a chair in front of the dresser mirror drinking a beer. carrie is cutting her hair. in the mirror adele watches carrie for a moment. she notices the cigarette dangling from her lips.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{how do you get your cigarette to stay there like that.}
<A>__{carrie looks in the mirror.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{i'm cool.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{could i try that?}
<A>__{carrie takes out a fresh cigarette and hands it to adele. together they stare into the mirror with their dangling cigarettes. adele drops her cigarette, as she reaches down for it she notices carrie's portfolio.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{it's a portfolio of my work.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{your pictures. can i see 'em?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{adele grabs the black leather binder and sets it in her lap. carrie continues to cut adele's hair. adele opens the binder and takes a look at the first erotic image and slaps the cover back down. she's embarrassed.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{jesus!}
<A>__{carrie watches her in amusement. after a moment, adele reconsiders, and opens the book. she gazes at the shocking photograph.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{you took this picture?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{took 'em all.}
<A>__{carrie resumes cutting adele's hair. adele thumbs through several photographs.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{that's me.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{no it is not!}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{hold still.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{sorry. boy i will tell ya, if early found a picture of me like that i'd be black and blue for a week.}
<A>__{adele notices carrie's scowl in the dresser mirror. carrie stops cutting.}
<C>__{carrie}
<P>__{(suddenly serious)}
<D>__{you shouldn't let him do that to you...}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{do what?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{adele... are you serious?}
<C>__{adele}
<P>__{(defensive)}
<D>__{you think early's bad to me, don't you?}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{carrie starts cutting adele's hair again.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{well... you're wrong. i ain't saying early ain't never hit me... but he never hurt me.}
<A>__{when carrie doesn't respond, adele grabs carrie's scissor hand and stops her from continuing. carrie looks at adele's reflection in the dresser mirror.}
<C>__{adele}
<P>__{(continues)}
<D>__{...when i was fourteen years old three boys raped me in the back of a truck, and beat me so bad i was in bed for almost four months...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{...i feel safe with early, most the time he treats me pretty good. and i know he wouldn't let nothin' like that ever happen to me again...}
<A>__{carrie is speechless, adele looks in the mirror at her new haircut.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{hey, that ain't so bad now.}
