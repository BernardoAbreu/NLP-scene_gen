<L>__{exterior gas station day}
<A>__{as jeff continues pouring the oil, he doesn't notice the mud streaked dodge ram pickup pulling up to the pumps behind him. the driver, earl, climbs out. the other man remains in the cab with the smoked windows rolled up. earl is a beefy man about jeff's age. he wears a sweat stained western hat, cowboy boots and a t shirt with the sleeves cut out to display his tattooed biceps. he saunters over to the cherokee, stands there a beat, looking over jeff's shoulder. jeff senses something behind him, turns. his eyes widen as he sees earl, recognizes the pickup as the one he nearly hit a few minutes before. earl stares at him, unsmiling.}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(flatly)}
<D>__{nice car.}
<A>__{jeff is in an awkward position. he's got a half full upside down bottle of oil in his hands. if he lifts it now, he'll spill on the engine. he turns his gaze back to the engine, decides to keep pouring.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{earl steps around to the open passenger window, peers in. jeff watches him, wary.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{air, c.d., leather i guess you sprung for the whole nine yards.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i guess.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{then again, out here, what you really need's a c.b. radio.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{is that right?}
<A>__{the oil bottle empties out. relieved, jeff pulls it away and screws back on the crankcase cap. he shuts the hood with a thunk and moves around to the side of the car to remove the gas nozzle from the tank. earl blocks his path.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{'course, if you use a c.b., you gotta have a handle.}
<A>__{jeff says nothing. this is not a friendly conversation.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{how about shit for brains?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you damn near killed us back there, boy.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{look, i'm sorry, i didn't see you. you pulled out in front of me.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{the hell i did. i saw what happened.}
<A>__{looking past earl, jeff sees amy come out of the mini mart with a bag of groceries. he speaks carefully, anxious to avoid a confrontation.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{how about if we just forget it, okay? i'm sorry it happened. i don't want any trouble.}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(snorting)}
<D>__{yeah. i bet you don't.}
<A>__{earl glares at jeff before turning away. he passes amy, gives her a broad smile.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{howdy, ma'am. caught this fellow tryin' to steal your cherokee.}
<A>__{amy takes in the situation. she nods politely. earl continues into the mini mart. she approaches jeff, puzzled.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{what was that about?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{nothing. guy in the truck. thinks i tried to hit him.}
<A>__{jeff glances apprehensively at the man in the pickup, who has not moved during the scene. he looks back at the mini mart.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{c'mon, let's go.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{you want me to drive?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{later. just get in.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{is something wrong?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{no, let's just go.}
<A>__{jeff climbs in behind the wheel. amy glances at him and gets in the car. jeff keys the ignition and pulls away.}
