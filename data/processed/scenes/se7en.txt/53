<L>__{interior mill's apartment, living room kitchenette night}
<A>__{a record player on a moving box plays quiet music. there's a basketball game with no volume on the t.v. screen. tracy, mills and somerset eat at the kitchen table. mills has a beeper by his beer and occasionally fingers it absently.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{why aren't you married, somerset?}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{tracy. what the hell?}
<A>__{somerset adjusts his napkin on his lap, thinking.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i was close. it just didn't happen.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{it surprises me you're not married. it really does.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{any person who spends a significant amount of time with me finds me... disagreeable. just ask your husband.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{no argument.}
<A>__{mills grins, but he means it. he sips beer. the conversation lapses into long silence. somerset concentrates on his plate. tracy looks at mills, who eats while watching the basketball game.}
<C>__{tracy}
<P>__{(to somerset)}
<D>__{how long have you lived here?}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{too long. much too long.}
<P>__{(drinks)}
<D>__{what do you think of our fair city?}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{you take the bad with the good, i suppose. it's... it's...}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{it takes time to settle in.}
<A>__{tracy looks at mills. somerset can see it is a sore subject.}
<C>__{somerset}
<P>__{(to tracy)}
<D>__{you'll get used to it pretty quickly. there are things in any big city that stand out at first. but...}
<A>__{a low rumbling is heard as plates begin to rattle and clatter.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{subway train. it's right below us }
<A>__{the dishes clatter more. coffee cups clink against their saucers. tracy holds her cup to stop it, tries to act like it is nothing, but she is clearly bothered.}
<C>__{tracy }
<D>__{it'll go away in a minute.}
<A>__{they wait. the t.v. picture goes fuzzy. the rumbling grows louder, knocks something over in the sink. mills continues eating. somerset fiddles with his food. the record player skips, then plays on. the rumbling finally dies down, till everything is normal.}
<C>__{mills}
<P>__{(uncomfortable)}
<D>__{this real estate guy... a real scum, brought us to see this place a few times. and, it was nice enough, and the price was right. i was thinking it was nothing, but i started to notice, he kept hurrying us along. i mean what could it be? why would he only show it like five minutes at a time, before he'd hustle us out the door?}
<A>__{mills laughs, lamely.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{we found out the first night.}
<A>__{somerset tries to stay straight, but he can't help laughing.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i'm sorry... it's a nice apartment.}
<A>__{he pulls himself together, but only for a moment. he can't stop it, laughs harder, covering his mouth. tracy and mills laugh.}
<C>__{mills}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{oh, fuck.}
