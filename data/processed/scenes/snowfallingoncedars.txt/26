<L>__{interior san piedro review day}
<A>__{close on 12 year old ishmael. neutral eyes. eating an apple. a horrific clanging surrounds us. the clash of metal on metal.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{my lessons came from my father. they were different. or seemed so, at the time.}
<A>__{see arthur chambers now, at the printing press, an enormous lime green contraption, with rollers and conveyor pulleys in a cast iron housing. the shrieking of metal and gears recalls an ancient locomotive.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{he operated the review alone, with an integrity and passion for principle that made him a figure of respect. if slightly larger than life.}
<A>__{arthur is a large, rugged man, with round gun metal rimmed spectacles and garters on his shirtsleeves. he wears the soft, perpetual smile of an oxford don, as he gracefully ducks in and out of the machine, inspecting plates and printing cylinders.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{he never spoke of wanting me to succeed him. and, in truth, it was the last job on earth i thought i'd ever want.}
<A>__{the boy rises now. sets his apple carefully aside. and under his father's supervision, takes his place operating the press. his arms inches from the fearful clatter of the rollers.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{when i was five, he casually mentioned that if his sleeve got caught in the press, he'd be instantly popped open like a child's balloon, and splattered across the walls.}
<A>__{watch ishmael running the monster, coolly, efficiently, with complete concentration.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{even his bones would disappear, to be discovered later on the floor, as strips of white confetti.}
<A>__{arthur turns away, lest his son feel a lack of confidence. picks up the boy's apple. a crisp bite.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{which, of course, made me certain that life would have no meaning until i could run that teakettle.}
