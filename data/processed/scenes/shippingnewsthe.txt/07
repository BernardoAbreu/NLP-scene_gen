<A>__{...a slender feminine hand. buried in quoyle's.}
<C>__{petal }
<D>__{petal bear, mr. quoyle.}
<A>__{pan up to see her. tiny, twitchy, moist ringlets. a gray eyed predator. she looks around at the milling suits and their name tags. as if they were alternatives.}
<C>__{petal}
<D>__{do you hate this shit, or what?}
<A>__{quoyle transfixed by her slight form in its loose but clingy wrapping. the smile that sees him again and flickers...}
<C>__{petal}
<D>__{what do you think? you want to marry me, don't you?}
<A>__{don't you? no answer. she laughs, as if at some off color response. runs hot fingers up his arm, leaning to his face...}
<C>__{petal}
<D>__{buy me a drink somewhere, it's seven thirty. i think i'm going to fuck you by ten. what do you think of that?}
<A>__{quoyle. blinks. she laughs again. bright, like whiskey music.}
<C>__{petal}
<D>__{you are quite. the raconteur.}
