<L>__{exterior the street outside salieri's house vienna night}
<A>__{the street is filled with people: ten cabs with drivers, five children, fifteen adults, two doormen, fifteen dancing couples and a sled and three dogs. it is a windy night. snow is falling and whirling about. people are passing on foot, holding their cloaks tightly around them. some of them are revelers in fancy dress: they wear masks on their faces or hanging around their necks, as if returning from parties. now they are glancing up at the facade of the old house. the window above the street is open and old salieri stands there calling to the sky: a sharp featured, white haired italian over seventy years old, wearing a stained dressing gown.}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{mozart! mozart! i cannot bear it any longer! i confess! i confess what i did! i'm guilty! i killed you! sir i confess! i killed you!}
<A>__{the door of the house bursts open. the valet hobbles out, holding the sugared cake. the wind catches at his shawl.}
<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{mozart, perdonami! forgive your assassin! piet! piet! forgive your assassin! forgive me! forgive! forgive!}
<C>__{valet}
<P>__{(looking up to the window)}
<D>__{that's all right, signore! he heard you! he forgave you! he wants you to go inside now and shut the window!}
<A>__{old salieri stares down at him. some of the passersby have now stopped and are watching this spectacle.}
<C>__{valet}
<D>__{come on, signore! look what i have for you! i can't give it to you from down here, can i?}
<A>__{old salieri looks at him in contempt. then he turns away back into the room, shutting the window with a bang. through the glass, the old man stares down at the group of onlookers in the street. they stare back at him in confusion.}
<C>__{bystander}
<D>__{who is that?}
<C>__{valet}
<D>__{no one, sir. he'll be all right. poor man. he's a little unhappy, you know.}
<A>__{he makes a sign indicating 'crazy,' and goes back inside the house. the onlookers keep staring.}
