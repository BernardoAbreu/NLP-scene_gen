<A>__{between massive tree trunks, a spectacular view: stor m clouds touch mountaintops. below, the lagoon ripples in pink crescents.}
<D>__{pre recorded voice ... and the grasses are a species of juniper, and samples can be purchased at the gift shop. now, if everyone will take a look to the right ...}
<A>__{all eyes swing that way. grant doesn't see a thing. nor do the others. ahead, timmy pulls the binoculars out of the equipment pouch and studies the location. lex grabs the night goggles. timmy pulls them from her.}
<C>__{regis}
<D>__{look ...}
<C>__{lex and timmy}
<D>__{i don't see anything. do you see anything? there's nothing there.}
<C>__{regis}
<D>__{something's out there ...}
<A>__{in the second car, a fly buzzes on grant's windshield. grant hangs out his window almost sniffing the air for some movement. nothing. suddenly the trees in front of them move! a deep trumpeting sound and two brachiosaurs rumble away fr om the side of the road. the ground shakes as they walk, their bellowing fills the air. led by grant, the passengers rise through the open top of their land cruisers, to look up at the dinosaurs far above. drooping from above, leaves and little branches shower on grant. utter amazement fills grant's face, then his mouth breaks into a giant smile then a laugh. he simply can't believe his eyes. his laugh becomes raucous and euphoric.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{ellie! can you imagine the excavation team seeing this!}
<A>__{behind him, ellie's whole person is awestruck, immobile. gennaro squints, straining to make sense of this unbelievable reality. in the car ahead, lex and timmy stare open mouthed. regis looks at the animal and then at the group's reverie. he smiles knowingly: he's been there, too. he bends and whispers:}
<C>__{regis}
<D>__{congratulations. you're the first kids in the whole wide world ever to see real dinosaurs.}
<A>__{the kids look up at regis with wonder in their eyes. grant can't stop laughing. still chewing, a brachiosaur cranes down to peer at this laughing man. the brachiosaur's huge head stops inches away from grant. grant, awestruck, stares and them close on grant as his eyes slowly roll back and ... he faints. the dinosaur casually moves away as ellie comes to grant's aid.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{alan? alan?}
<P>__{(sort of delighted)}
<D>__{he fainted!}
<A>__{gennaro waves to regis that all is okay. grant slowly revives. he looks back at the brachiosaur, groggily, smiling away. he looks at ellie and their eyes linger on each other longer than usual, sharing a look of serene delight. gennaro plops back in his seat and ponders the scene before him. a glazed look fills his face.}
<C>__{gennaro}
<D>__{my god, we're going to make a fortune here!}
<A>__{camera pushes in on the majestic, gentle beauty of the brachiosaurs. jungle sounds dominate, growing l ouder and louder.}
