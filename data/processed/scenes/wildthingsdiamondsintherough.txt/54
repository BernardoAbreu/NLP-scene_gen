<L>__{exterior underwater day}
<A>__{sunlight cuts through the dark blue surface, illuminating marie's lucky ring gold ring that drifts down gently until... marie comes diving down into the crystalline water, plucks the soon to be diamond ring from the bottom of the pool...}
<L>__{exterior blue bay high swimming pool day}
<A>__{marie surfaces at the edge of the pool. she places the ring onto the deck, pulls herself out of the water. she tries not to show surprise when she comes face to face with kristen, who's picked up her ring, runs it around her fingers...}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{i was wondering if i could have a moment of your time. ask a couple questions.}
<A>__{marie glances nervously back at the pool, where other members of the diving team go about their workout.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{i'm in the middle of practice...}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{it'll only take a moment, marie. might even help jay. remember your loving stepfather? you want to help him, don't you?}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{kristen studies the ring for a moment, then ventures...}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{why'd you agree to part with your diamonds?}
<A>__{this time marie can't hide her shock.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{how...}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{jay told me. but why? they were your inheritance.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{jay needed help. we're a team.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{team clifford. right. it's just...you must've been pretty unhappy when jay didn't give you those diamonds for your birthday.}
<A>__{marie's taking a beating, doing her best to remain standing.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{he said i wasn't ready.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{you're 18. that's heiress payday, no? must've crossed your mind that jay might never let you have them...}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{no, of course not.}
<A>__{she's a bad liar.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{and then this little scam artist saunters in and just takes them. with your help, no less.}
<A>__{kristen moves in for the kill.}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{but what i don't get is, why wouldn't elena do what jay asked, clear his name? after all, she'd gotten what she wanted.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{how should i know?}
<A>__{marie watches in fascination as kristen presses the top of the ring against the back of her hand. hard. winces, then...}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{i mean, the only way i can make sense of it is if somehow getting jay released from prison would spoil the plan.}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{what plan?}
<A>__{she hands the ring back to marie. not so lucky anymore...}
<C>__{kristen}
<D>__{you tell me...}
