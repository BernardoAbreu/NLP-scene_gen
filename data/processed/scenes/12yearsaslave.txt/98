<A>__{solomon and patsey are returning from shaw's. waiting on the porch of the great house, a drunk epps beckons for patsey, his lewd intentions obvious.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{pats...! patsey!}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{do not look in his direction. continue on.}
<A>__{epps does not care to be ignored. he lifts himself and moves toward the pair in a rage.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{patsey...!}
<A>__{solomon moves between epps and patsey, cutting epps off as patsey continues on. playing up his "ignorance" of the situation:}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{found her, master, and brought her back just as instructed.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{what'd you jus now tell her? what'd you say to pats?}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{no words were spoken. none of consequence.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{lie! damned liar! saw you talkin' with 'er. tell me!}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{i cannot speak of what did not occur.}
<A>__{epps grabs solomon.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i will cut your black throat.}
<A>__{solomon pulls away from epps, ripping his shirt in the process. epps gives chase. solomon begins to run around the large pig sty, easily keeping his distance. epps, however is undeterred. he moves after solomon as speedily as he can, which isn't very speedily at all. and quickly he tires. epps is forced to bend over and suck air. solomon maintains his distance, barely breathing hard. his breath returned to him, epps starts up the chase again. solomon runs on out of reach. shortly, epps again stops, gets his breath... and now in what should be quite comical, epps again runs after solomon. again, epps's vigor leaves him before he can even get close to the slave. dropping down to the dirt, in a show of regret and piety:}
<C>__{epps }
<D>__{platt... platt, liquor filled me. i admit that it did, and i done over reacted. it's the lord's day. ain't nothin' christian in us carryin' on like this. help me ta my feet, and let us both pray to the lord for forgiveness.}
<A>__{epps extends a hand to solomon. cautiously, solomon moves close, but not too close. as solomon draws within striking distance, epps lunges for him. he chases solomon on until he is again out of breath and once more drops down. and again offering a treaty:}
<C>__{epps }
<D>__{i'm all done in, platt. i have met my limitations, and i ain't equal to 'em. i concede to yah, but in the name of valor, help yer master to his feet.}
<A>__{solomon cautiously moves closer to help. again he is attacked by epps this time by knife. sort of. epps is too drunk and tired to fully open the folding blade and chased far around the field by epps. all of the}
<B>__{preceding should be more funny than shocking. a change of pace from the otherwise necessary bleakness of slave life.}
<A>__{mistress epps comes running from the house to the pair.}
<C>__{mistress epps}
<D>__{what? wha's the fuss?}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{a misunderstanding is all. it began when i was sent to retrieve patsey from where she'd taken sabbatical at master shaw's. upon returning, master epps believed patsey and me to be in conversation when we were not. i tried to explain, but it lead to all this.}
<C>__{mistress epps}
<D>__{what is it? ya cain't remain the sabbath without her under your eye? ya are a no account bastard.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{hold a moment...}
<C>__{mistress epps}
<D>__{a filthy, godless heathen. my bed is too holy for yah ta share.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{wha's...wha's he been tellin' yah?}
<C>__{mistress epps}
<D>__{of yer misbegotten ways.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{and he would know what of anythin'? i ain't even spoken with him today. platt, yah lyin' nigger, have i? have i?}
<A>__{discretion being the better part and all, solomon remains silent.}
<C>__{epps }
<D>__{there; there's all the truth he got. damned nigger. damn yah.}
<A>__{epps pushes his way past the mistress.}
