<L>__{interior main floor corridor}
<A>__{arthur, kathy, maggie and rafkin are searching the house, looking for bobby.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{bobby!!}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{come on out, pal!}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{robert!! stop screwing around!}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{hey, glass family robinson! you're wasting your breath! this stuff }
<P>__{(taps glass)}
<D>__{this is ectobar glass, cyrus invented it. it's shatterproof and soundproof. so your kid might have a hard time hearing you.}
<A>__{maggie touches the etchings on the glass.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{what are these?}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{they're containment spells. ectoplasmic entities can't cross them. the supernatural has laws to obey just like we do. in the case of ghosts, it's spells. written, spoken, it doesn't matter. they have to obey what the spells tell them.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{so what do these do?}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{at the moment they're keeping us alive}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{just ignore him. bobby!}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{let's go back for a second to the ecto thing...}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{you mean the poltergeists.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{poltergeists?}
<C>__{rafkin}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{alright, ghosts. and not casper the friendly kind either. cyrus had a thing for hunting the more powerful of the species. why, i got no idea.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i thought you didn't want to go through it again.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{you know, you're right. i've wasted enough time on small minds tonight.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{hey!}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{i was talking about your father.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{excuse me... did you say hunted?}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{yup, and his trophies are all locked up in the basement.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{this basement?}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{what's with you people? are you slow? of course this basement. if it was next door i wouldn't give a shit. here, i will prove it...}
<A>__{rafkin pulls out his glasses.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{you can see them with these. they're spectral viewers.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{i gave bobby a pair of those. this gets arthur's attention. maggie walks over and takes them out of rafkin's hand. slips them on.}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{i don't see any ghosts...}
<C>__{rafkin}
<P>__{(rolls his eyes)}
<D>__{that's because they're all downstairs.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{... just more of that crazy latin shit all over the floor. rafkin takes the glasses back. looks down. impressed.}
<C>__{rafkin}
<D>__{huh. hidden barrier spells. cyrus must've needed more protective zones.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{protection? you mean like oregano is to a vampire?}
<C>__{rafkin}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{yeah... something like that...}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(had enough)}
<D>__{look, raf kin, is it? do me a favor, spare us the haunted house ravings... at least 'til we get outta here. okay?}
