<A>__{two international front rows come together with bone crunching force. huge, violent men grunt like bulls. the crowd roar vibrates the stadium. the scrum a phalanx of eight men locked together against eight wheels, buckles, then steadies under the watchful eye of the referee. fanning out behind each scrum are the backs faster, more glamorous players who will run with the ball, or kick it. the lions scrumhalf thrusts the ball into the maw of the scrum, the huge men lock up against each other with maximum force. the ball comes out the back of the lions' scrum, the scrumhalf dive passes it away to the backs, who flick it out laterally to the wing, with lightning speed. the wing lofts a delicate kick just over the onrushing springbok defenders. the lions charge the ball, which bounces erratically right into the hands of the man who kicked it. one last burst of speed, one quick juke to avoid a desperation tackle, and the wing scores in the corner. as the lions kicker gets ready to convert the try, we find the springboks huddling under their goal posts, hands on their hips, stunned. at the center of the huddle pienaar bleeds behind his gum guard as, furiously, he tries to inject some fire into his team.}

<A>__{on pienaar, as he realizes he is not getting through. there is dullness, shock in his player's eyes which all lift to the heavens as the conversion kick soars through the uprights. we follow the kick as it drops past a giant scoreboard. stay on the scoreboard as it registers the conversion and shows the score: lions 10 springboks 0}
