<A>__{our heroes clear the dirt off the top of the sarcophagus, revealing a single, ominous hieroglyph. evelyn stares at it jonathan impatiently strums his fingers across the lid.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{well?... who is it?}
<A>__{evelyn stares at the hieroglyph, confused and concerned.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{'he that shall not be named.'}
<A>__{o'connell dusts off the huge lock}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{there's some sort of lock here. you say these thing's are made of granite with a steel interior?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{quarried granite with a cobalt lining.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{whoever's in here, sure wasn't getting out.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{no kiddin', without a key, it'll take us a month to crack this thing,}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{a key! that's it! that's what he was talking about.}
<C>__{o'connell}
<D>__{who was talking about what?}
<A>__{evelyn starts rummaging through the pack on jonathan's back.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{the man on the barge. the one with the hook, he was looking for a key.}
<A>__{evelyn pulls out the key box. jonathan tries to take it back.}
<C>__{jonathan}
<D>__{hey that's mine!}
<A>__{evelyn slaps his hand and quickly unfolds the box, it's now shaped exactly like the lock's keyhole. evelyn smiles. and that's when they hear the warden's screams echoing through the labyrinth. all three of them turn and take off running.}
