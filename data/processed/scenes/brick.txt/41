<A>__{our one and only scene in a classroom was moved to brendan's lunch spot to save us a location change. the degree to which the lack of classroom time in the film has been commented on has always bemused the author, who cannot for the life of him remember a single interesting thing that happened in a classroom in high school.}

<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{mm.}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{slim pickings. why'd you let dode fly when he came back to whose her name, at the theater?}
<C>__{brendan}
<P>__{(shrugs dismissively)}
<D>__{kara. it's their turf, i couldn't hear them without being seen, and that would only biff their play. best to know it's there, let it ride and see what comes of it.}
<P>__{(touches the paper)}
<D>__{but anyway.}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{hm. well, if this is what i think it is, it didn't come straight from dode, less he's playing out of his league.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i can only give you my best guess.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{when the upper crust does shady deeds they do them in different spots around town. i know under the pier's one, down by the bike trails in the state park's another. there's alot of them. the pitch is they've got little symbols for each one, and that's how they tell each other the place, so word won't get around. so this might be that.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{but dode wouldn't know it?}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{this is upper crust. dode's pie pan grease.}
<A>__{brendan studies the symbol.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{call anything up?}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{how many places start with 'a'? or if it's a shape, or just a random symbol. anyway, even if you figured it out, what good could you do? she's smart, she knows the play, she's gunning to square things.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{the brain}
<D>__{you said her business was none of yours, so she's alright, forget it now. go home, sleep.}
