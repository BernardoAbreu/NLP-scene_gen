<A>__{jim he stands in front of the washstand lathering his face. over scene we hear muriel's voice from the shower. she is singing a lusty chorus of "home on the range." jim picks up his razor and turns to the mirror. he reacts with annoyance, as he discovers it is covered with steam. with weary resignation he takes a towel and starts to rub off the mirror. as he clears one section another clouds up. by the time he gets it all reasonably clear he finds that his lather needs freshening. he grimly relathers his face only to find that the mirror is again clouded up. as he turns with exasperation toward the shower we see muriel turn off the water, reach for a towel, start to dry herself. the mirror cleared off, jim relathers, starts to shave. during this, muriel, having dried herself and donned her robe, comes into scene.}

<P>__{(reaching for toothbrush)}
<D>__{excuse...}
<A>__{she takes her toothbrush and then opens the cabinet to get the paste. jim, automatically following the mirror, has to squeeze around in a desperately contorted position as he continues shaving. close shot muriel close shot muriel. she takes the tube from the cabinet and, squeezing the tube in the middle, applies the paste to her brush.}
<B>__{jim and muriel}
<A>__{jim and muriel placing the tube on the washstand, muriel closes the cabinet. jim, still shaving, moves back to his original position as he follows the mirror.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{excuse...}
<A>__{muriel nods, steps back, starts to brush her teeth. they both hum "home on the range". her mouth full, muriel taps jim on the shoulder. without stopping his shaving, jim moves to one side as muriel rinses her mouth. she examines her face in the mirror.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(impatiently)}
<D>__{if you don't mind, dear.}
<A>__{as he steps back in front of the mirror, muriel continues to look at her face in the glass, over his shoulder. she decides she needs a little skin lotion.}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(as she steps in front of him)}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{she again opens the cabinet. jim once more follows the mirror around, nicks his face, gives up, stands glaring arms folded. muriel takes the lotion from the cabinet.}

<D>__{moment, dear.}

<D>__{take your time. i can spare the blood.}

<D>__{oh... cut yourself?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i cut myself every morning. i kind of look forward to it.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{why don't you get an electric razor?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(trying to shave)}
<D>__{don't like them. no close shave.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{ridiculous! bill cole's been using one for years.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{he doesn't have my beard!}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{that's silly. bill's beard is just as tough and coarse and }
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(irritably)}
<D>__{i'm not interested in discussing the grain and texture of bill cole's hair follicles before i've had my orange juice.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{you don't have to carry on so. i only said, why don't you get an electric razor?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{because i prefer the cool, clean sweep of the tempered steel as it glides smoothly }

<D>__{stop writing advertising copy! hurry up, dear, you'll be late for breakfast.}
<A>__{muriel exits. jim sighs, turns back to the mirror and with a few deft strokes finishes shaving. as he reaches for the water faucet, he encounters the tube of toothpaste, squeezed in the middle. reacting with annoyance, he meticulously smoothes it out and rolls it up from the bottom. he opens the cabinet and gingerly places the tube on the top shelf. the iodine bottle pops out. he grimly catches it, studies his problem, has a solution. with his right hand he starts slowly to close the mirror door. just before it closes, he slips the bottle into the cabinet with his left hand, quickly slamming the mirror door, trapping the bottle. he reacts masterfully at his triumph, picks up his robe and starts for the door. as he reaches it, there is the sound of the cabinet opening and a crash as the bottle obviously hits the washstand. as jim winces,}
