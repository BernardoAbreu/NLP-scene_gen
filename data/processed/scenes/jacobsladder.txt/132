<L>__{interior jacob's apartment day}
<A>__{jacob is sitting in a comfortable chair in his living room. he is reading. the room is dark, lit only by a reading light. the walls are mostly in shadow. the light, however, falls on one section of the wall, a portion that has been lined in fake wood paneling. jacob's eyes suddenly lift off the page and roam over the wood grain on the wall. all of a sudden he notices something strange, an image in the grain. he stares at it. the more he stares the more precise its definition. the image of a demon appears in the wall. jacob sits up quickly and stares at the walll. it is impossible to get the demon's image out of the grain. it seems etched, even imbedded, in the paneling. jacob looks away and returns to his book. he is reading about archetypes and the primordial mind. but the book does not hold his attention. he is obsessed with the wall. its molecules seem suddenly active, the wood grain suddenly animate. layers begin to appear in the surface of the wall as the grain patterns slowly define a rocky, barren landscape. the demon is growing solid. cries and screams rise up in the distance. flames and a red glow emanate from the space extending rapidly into the wall. the image of hell erupts before him. jacob stands up. he can see bodies suffering beyond the wall, masses of people wailing and enduring the torments of a fiery world. the demon's arm slowly extends from the plane of the wall and reaches into the room. he is huge, covered in flames and skulls, a living horror. he grabs hold of jacob and pulls him toward the wall. jacob tries to back away but he cannot. his face is white with fear. the demon draws jacob toward the inferno.}
