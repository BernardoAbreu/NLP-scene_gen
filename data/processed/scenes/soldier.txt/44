<A>__{a weapon firing! budda! budda! budda! the automatic weapon is being fired by the veteran soldier riley. he's blazing away at an elaborate electronic target a hundred yards away in the huge space. todd is watching with the other veteran soldiers. they're seated on the floor, wearing drab fatigues, directly across from the twenty new soldiers. as todd glances at them, the new soldiers look back unblinkingly. (the veterans, in spite of their impassive expressions, look very human compared to the new soldiers. their battle scars mark them as individuals in sharp contrast to the perfectly muscled young giants across from them.) the firing stops, and riley, his weapon empty, leaps to his feet and salutes rubrick, who's been watching the demonstration with the rest of the officers.}
<C>__{riley}
<D>__{sir!}
<C>__{rubrick}
<D>__{very nice, riley. fall away.}
<C>__{riley}
<P>__{(another salute)}
<D>__{sir!}
<A>__{as riley joins the veterans squatting motionlessly, rubrick glances at the shredded electronic target, glances at his stopwatch, then looks at mekum.}
<C>__{rubrick}
<D>__{thirty seconds, 90 percent hits.}
<A>__{mekum smirks, picks up the weapon, disassembles it rapidly.}
<C>__{mekum}
<D>__{let's make it more difficult.}
<A>__{rubrick, church and sloan exchange glances of disbelief as mekum scatters the disassembled parts onto the concrete floor with a loud clatter. todd watches, unblinking, as mekum looks to the new soldiers.}
<C>__{mekum}
<D>__{caine six oh seven!}
<A>__{a blond nordic giant is suddenly on his feet among the new soldiers. there is real dignity in his salute; he's like a pro.}
<C>__{caine 607}
<D>__{sir!}
<C>__{mekum}
<D>__{assemble the weapon, load, fire on the target from various evasive positions in a thirty second period.}
<A>__{officers look at each other again in disbelief.}
<C>__{mekum}
<D>__{starting...now!}
<A>__{mekum punches his watch as caine 607 gracefully begins to pick up pieces of weapon, doing it rapidly, yet without apparent haste. todd is watching, revealing nothing. clack! ka shack! click! caine 607 slaps the weapon together, loading a magazine with a final ka shuck, then he dives to the floor, firing a rapid burst at the electronic target which blinks wildly... officers watch, impressed. caine 607 is firing from another position. the target goes crazy. caine 607 is rolling and firing at the same time. the target goes wild. mekum's watch clicks off 27 seconds...28...29... the firing stops. todd stares impassively as caine 607 salutes. beside him, riley watches also.}
<C>__{mekum}
<P>__{(to caine 607)}
<D>__{as you were, soldier.}
<A>__{rubrick is looking at the electronic target, grudgingly impressed.}
<C>__{rubrick}
<D>__{ninety nine percent...}
<C>__{mekum}
<P>__{(smug)}
<D>__{while taking evasive action...}
<C>__{rubrick}
<P>__{(amazed)}
<D>__{that's...very good.}
