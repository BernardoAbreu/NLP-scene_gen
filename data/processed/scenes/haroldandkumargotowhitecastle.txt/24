<A>__{kumar walks over to a table in the living room where he finds an m.c.a.t. test prep book. kumar lifts open the cover inside, we see a hollowed out circle filled with marijuana. kumar smells it and shudders in ecstasy. the phone next to the book starts to ring. kumar doesn't care. he lets it ring until the answering machine picks up.}

<D>__{kumar...it is daddy. i hope your interview today was good. i'm calling to remind you that you have another one tomorrow morning with dr. wein from cornell at 10:00 a.m. do not be late!}
<A>__{kumar rolls his eyes as he tears some pages from the m.c.a.t. book and starts rolling a fat blunt...}
<C>__{man with thick indian accent}
<D>__{it is very important you show up on time! mommy and i will be very upset if you do not go. good luck, kumar. remember, the meeting is at ten o'clock. bye bye.}
<A>__{harold (still wearing his button down shirt, only now untucked) enters the living room. kumar is now licking the blunt.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{don't you think you should take at least one of your interviews seriously? at some point your dad's gonna get really pissed.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{so what? it's not like there's a shortage of dr. patel's out there. my dad's a doctor. my brother's a doctor. just because everyone in my family went to med school, doesn't mean i have to.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{well, then what are you going to do?}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{i will tell you what i'm gonna do. i'm gonna smoke this fat blunt, get ridiculously high, and then get something to eat.}
