<D>__{people! hear me out. if we get it up and running again, we can sell it as a going concern instead of an empty shop. this deal you're working on could take ages. in the meantime, you're getting cash in and you're saving money because it's got two bedrooms. eh? the three brothers is a goldmine. used to be. can be again.}
