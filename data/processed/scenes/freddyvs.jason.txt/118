<T>__{hard cut to:}
<L>__{exterior camp crystal lake night}
<A>__{jason comes alive, thrashing around on the diving dock, the electricity all over him like a spider web. on shore, erwin and the girls gasp.}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{holy shit! it worked!}
<A>__{meagan and stormie bounce, excitedly. but something is wrong. jason thrashes around on the dock, unable to break the crisscross of high voltage chicken wire.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{it's kill him! shut it off! shut it off!}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{shut it off... it suddenly occurs to me that i hadn't really planned for that contingency.}
<C>__{stormie}
<D>__{just don't stand there! do something!}
<A>__{but all erwin can do is scratch his head. meagan rushes to the shore line and screams out over the lake:}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{jason! jason! you've got to get up! do you hear me? get up!}
<A>__{jason clenches his meaty fists and slams them down against the diving dock. smashing it to bits. water rushes over him and zzzzt! ka pow! a power transformer on shore explodes, causing meagan and her friends to cringe. when they look back, the electrical light show fades away, leaving nothing but smoke and floating debris. meagan and stormie turn to erwin, who shrugs shyly and says:}
<C>__{erwin}
<D>__{well... it's off now.}
<A>__{meagan and stormie begin a verbal barrage that would shrink any man to pus... much less erwin. he cowers between them, offering quick excuses and humble apologies. all three are so wrapped up in laying blame that they never notice jason's shadowy figure as it rises from the lake. then they do see him... scream and run. jason charges after the kids in his familiar "unstoppable killer" gait. erwin ducks inside the tool shed as meagan and stormie dash past. he closes the door behind him and squirms out a tiny window just as jason kicks open the door and steps inside. erwin races around to the front and closes the door. he fastens the latch and padlock, then calls to the girls:}
<C>__{erwin}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{hey! come back! i've got him locked up in the tool shed!}
<A>__{just then, the sound of a chainsaw as the blade rips through the tool shed door. erwin screams like a girl and runs away.}
