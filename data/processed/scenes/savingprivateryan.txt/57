<L>__{exterior bridge ramelle day}
<A>__{a dozen american paratroopers on the bridge exchange sporadic fire with a few german snipers hidden in the buildings near the bridgehead. the bridge has clearly been the scene of heavy fighting. craters, burning debris and shell casings are everywhere. the bridge is intact, only slightly damaged. there are dozens of german bodies along the riverbank on both sides of the bridge.}
<B>__{miller and his men}
<A>__{crouch run and take cover as they get within sight of the bridge.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{looks like they've been having a hell of a party, here, captain.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{on the bridge! we're coming in.}
<A>__{a young but grizzled voice calls back.}
<C>__{voice from bridge}
<D>__{kiss my ass, fritz.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{you fire at us and i will do a hell of a lot more than that.}
<C>__{voice from bridge}
<D>__{who won the '38 army navy game?}
<A>__{miller turns to his men. they all come up empty.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i have no fucking idea. here we come.}
<P>__{(to his men)}
<D>__{cover me.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{what if our guys open up, sir?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{you're only allowed to shoot at germans, that's one of the rules.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{have it your way, captain.}
<A>__{miller takes a breath, then dashes out into the open, toward the bridge.}
<B>__{the german snipers open up}
<A>__{bullets smash into the ground around miller.}
<C>__{miller's men}
<D>__{pour fire at the german positions, surpressing the german fire.}
<C>__{on the bridge}
<D>__{the paratroopers pour a heavy stream of bullets at the german positions.}
<A>__{miller makes it to the bridge and dives over a defensive jumble of crates, sandbags and bodies. he finds himself next to sergeant bill forrest who was the young but grizzled voice that called out. with forrest are some very worn out, young american paratroopers. miller catches his breath. forrest navy, sir, twenty one to nineteen. they won on a field goal in overtime.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i will keep it in mind.}
<P>__{(calls to sarge)}
<D>__{okay, sarge, one at a time.}
<A>__{miller and the paratroopers fire cover for miller's men as they come in. miller and forrest alternately take and fire. forrest are we glad to see you, sir, we were supposed to hold this bridge for twenty four hours, it's been six days.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{things are tough all over. we're looking for a private james ryan.}
<A>__{forrest ryan?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{is he here?}
<A>__{forrest motions to one of the paratroopers. forrest go get ryan.}
<P>__{(to miller)}
<D>__{what do you want him for, sir?}
<A>__{miller doesn't answer. jackson leaps over the barricade and scrambles to them.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{jackson, get a hold of command.}
<A>__{jackson cranks up the five thirty five. miller turns to forrest.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{how many men do you have?}
<A>__{they pause to fire, covering sarge, the last of miller's men to leap over the barricade. forrest eleven, sir. we started with thirty six. the bridge was easy to take but the krauts have been coming back at us ever since. they must want it intact or we'd be long gone. jackson speaks into the radio handset, repeating miller's hailing i.d. no response.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{not yet.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{keep trying.}
<A>__{forrest sir, what do you want with ryan? miller doesn't answer, he looks past forrest and sees:}
<C>__{private james ryan}
<D>__{dashing from cover to cover, making his way toward them. ryan is an american classic, nineteen years old, earthy, handsome, sharp, cocky. though he's exhausted, unshaven, and smeared with dirt and blood, he's very alive. his eyes shine, his face has a spark. you can't help but love this kid.}
<C>__{miller's men}
<D>__{all watch ryan run toward them.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{so, that's ryan.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{looks like a flaming asshole to me.}
<A>__{their eyes remain glued to ryan as he makes it to the barricade. he salutes miller.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{i'm ryan, sir. you wanted to see me?}
<A>__{miller looks at ryan for a moment, amazed that he's finally face to face with him. ryan waits. miller hesitates, searching for words. then he speaks gently but clearly. miller private, i've got some bad news for you. your brothers have been killed in action. the life instantly drains from ryan. his breath comes hard. somehow he remains upright. ryan all three?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{ryan sways. miller grabs him and eases him back, leaning him against some sandbags.}
<C>__{the paratroopers}
<D>__{are stunned at the news. they look at ryan, there's nothing else they can do.}
<C>__{miller's men}
<D>__{also look at ryan, but then, one after another, they turn away, adverting their eyes, looking a their own boots, the debris on the bridge, the sky, anything other than ryan.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{we've been sent to get you out of here. you're going home.}
<A>__{ryan weakly waves miller off. miller motions to his men and the paratroopers to move away. they do so, giving ryan a little room. forrest three brothers, the poor son of a bitch.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{sergeant, we're moving out and i'm taking you and your men with me.}
<A>__{forrest but, sir, our orders are clear, we're to hold this bridge until we're relieved by forward elements of the twenty ninth division.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i'm giving you new orders, sergeant.}
<A>__{forrest sir, you can't do that, these orders are from command.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i'm not going to leave you and your men here to get killed. get them together, we're moving out.}
<A>__{a voice from behind them speaks simply, clearly, firmly.}
<C>__{ryan }
<D>__{no, sir.}
<A>__{they all turn and see ryan standing there. miller is about to automatically rip ryan a new asshole for contradicting him, but he quickly calms himself, gently touches ryan on the arm and speaks softly to him.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{come on, private, you're going home.}
<A>__{ryan jerks away from miller.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<A>__{all eyes are on miller and ryan. miller remains patient.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{private. i'm sorry about your brothers but staying here and getting yourself killed isn't going to help.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{sir, if the krauts are holding this bridge when division shows up, our guys are going to be sitting ducks.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{this bridge cannot be held. the germans have two companies less than three miles from here. they have tanks.}
<A>__{that news clearly affects ryan and the other paratroopers, but ryan holds his ground. ryan sir, i'm still not going. miller speaks with restrained, but growing, anger.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{private, if you want to commit suicide, that's your choice, but you're going to have to wait until after i get you back to the beach. and you're not going to take these men with you.}
<A>__{ryan stands eye to eye with miller.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i'm not leaving, sir.}
<A>__{miller starts to boil over.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{the hell you aren't, you're comin' with me if i have to drag you every inch of the way. you hear me, private?}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i hear you sir, but i'm not leaving.}
<A>__{miller grabs ryan by the lapels and shakes him. ryan doesn't resist.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{listen you little son of a bitch you're coming with me or i will...i will...}
<A>__{ryan speaks softly.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{what are you going to do, sir, shoot me?}
<A>__{miller considers it. then reiben speaks up from behind miller.}
<C>__{reiben}
<P>__{(politely)}
<D>__{uh, excuse me, captain.}
<A>__{miller slowly turns and glares.}
<C>__{reiben}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{so, what are a few tanks, sir?}
<A>__{miller's more amazed than pissed off. reiben smiles.}
<C>__{reiben}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{he's right, we can't shoot him...well, we could but we'd get in an enormous amount of trouble. and he's right about the bridge, it's a hell of a lot more important than he is.}
<B>__{jackson steps forward.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{cap'n...?}
<A>__{miller turns his glare on jackson.}
<C>__{jackson}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{seems to me, we got us a opportunity, here, to kill two birds with one stone. command seems to think keepin' this boy alive is worth somethin'. if we was to do that and hold this bridge, good chance we'd get us a bucket full of medals. i might even get me one 'a them big, fancy ones like you got, so's i could sass any officer in the whole dang army, you included.}
<A>__{miller does a slow burn.}
<B>__{upham steps forward}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{i'd like to stay, too, captain.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{you don't count.}
<B>__{sarge steps up}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{i do and personally, i'd rather get the hell out of here, but somebody's got to stay and take care of you and these pin head privates of yours.}
<A>__{miller looks at forrest and the paratroopers. forrest we weren't planning on going anywhere, sir. reiben smiles.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{see, captain? the vote's unanimous.}
<A>__{miller's eyes almost pop out of his head. miller the vote? what the hell are you talking about? we don't vote. this isn't a democracy. this is the army, i give orders, you follow them. we don't vote!}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{yes, sir, of course, sir, i was merely speaking hypothetically. if this was a voting situation, then the vote would have been unanimous. but of course, it's not a voting situation, you're the captain, and you give the orders, sir.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{you're goddamned right, i give the order. vote! jesus christ! listen to me, you little pissant pieces of shit, i am the ranking officer here and what i say goes, is that clear?}
<A>__{they all quickly nod.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{of course, sir.}
<A>__{all the others yes, sir. yes, sir. miller looks from face to face.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{in that case...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i vote we stay.}
<A>__{that's what they wanted to hear. miller doesn't give them time to enjoy it, he immediately starts barking orders.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{reiben, the b.a.r., there. jackson, get up on the bridgekeepers hut with your sniper rifle. sarge, you and upham move that machine gun so it can cover the left flank, it's worthless where it is. forrest, i want a full inventory of all your weapons, ammo and ordnance. go.}
<A>__{they all hurry off, except for ryan who locks eyes with miller for a moment.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{thank you, sir.}
<C>__{miller}
<P>__{(gruffly gentle)}
<D>__{yeah, yeah. i want you right next to me, no matter where i go, you understand?}
<A>__{ryan salutes.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{alright, come with me.}
<A>__{miller shakes his head at himself and strides off to check the defensive perimeter with ryan at his side.}
