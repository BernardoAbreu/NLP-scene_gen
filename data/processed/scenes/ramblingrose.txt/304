<L>__{interior doctor's office night}
<T>__{cut to :}
<A>__{a shot of dr. f. robert martinson, a rather unpleasant man with a spade beard. he has a superior, patronizing way of talking and very little southern accent if any. the scene is his office and he is in a swivel chair behind his desk. as he speaks the camera pulls back to show daddy, mother and the hillyer children.}
<C>__{dr. martinson}
<D>__{well, mrs. hillyer, the girl is strong as an ox and that is what is keeping her alive. but not many people walk away from double pneumonia, madam, not many.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{she looks terrible, just awful.}
<C>__{dr. martinson}
<D>__{of course she does and i must say i'm puzzled by your delay in getting her to the hospital. i should think ordinary powers of observation would have suggested to you that she was seriously ill.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{she hid it from us, doctor. she's afraid of the hospital.}
<C>__{dr. martinson}
<P>__{(a thin superior smile)}
<D>__{afraid of the hospital?}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{deathly afraid of it. her people were poor tenant farmers and she doesn't know anything about doctors or medicine or hospitals.}
<C>__{dr. martinson}
<P>__{(frowns in open disbelief)}
<D>__{a tenant farm? are you trying to tell me that girl is a product of the hookworm and pellagra belt?}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{well, her people were very poor. she says she was often hungry as a child, and i'm sure the food she ate was pretty awful, not a balanced diet at all.}
<C>__{dr. martinson}
<D>__{exactly, and that's why she couldn't possibly have come from such a farm.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(icily polite)}
<D>__{excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar?}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{honey, please...}
<C>__{dr. martinson}
<P>__{(a thin unpleasant smile)}
<D>__{it's simply that i find it incredible, mr. hillyer. aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female and a comely one, too. she must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{it is kind of amazing. the dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth.}
<C>__{mr. martinson}
<P>__{(tries to make a supercilious joke)}
<D>__{her entire mouth is a cavity, madam, ha ha ha.}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(dryly, doesn't like the man a bit)}
<D>__{ha ha ha ha.}
<A>__{mother frowns at daddy and dr. martinson gives him an aloof glance.}
<C>__{dr. martinson}
<P>__{(with spurious dignity)}
<D>__{the point is you don't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits. she got protein somewhere, she's a very strong girl and i think she'll live... despite the delay in medical treatment.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{that's all i want to know.}
<P>__{(rises)}
<D>__{lets get out of here before i get the epizootics myself. thank you, doctor, for your discourse, it was fascinating, no doubt.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{yes, thank you, doctor.}
<C>__{dr. martinson}
<P>__{(as they leave)}
<D>__{i beg your pardon, epi zoo tics? do you mean "epi zoo ot tics," an animal epidemic?}
<C>__{daddy}
<P>__{(icily polite, from the door)}
<D>__{no, i mean epizootics.}
