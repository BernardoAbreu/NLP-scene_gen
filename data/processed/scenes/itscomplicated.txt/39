<A>__{jake, in work out clothes, sprints across the front lawn, careful not to be seen.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{jane clears their dishes.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{you know i hope you don't feel i've been interrogating you, but...}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i know what it's like to have your ex remarried and to not have so much going on in that department. i mean, do you date ever or...}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{uh, constantly actually.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{constantly?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{everyone i know or have ever known has fixed me up. and then, sometimes i just meet women, i don't know how that happens, but...}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{ but no girlfriend?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{not yet.}
<A>__{jane stands on the other side of the island and hands adam another croque monsieur. she stays on her side, like a waitress at a counter. she refills his water glass.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{just like to date...}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{actually, i find it really stressful. you know, the last time i was in the dating world was 1978. it's a little more complicated these days. i can't tell you how nice it is to have a conversation with a woman and have the pressure off. not to mention, a home cooked meal that no one else i know could possibly cook.}
<A>__{jane's not sure if she feels a little hurt by that. she smiles, wiping the counter.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{that was a compliment. so you don't have a guy in your life at the moment?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{no....}
<P>__{(starts to say something.)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{no?}
