<L>__{exterior al rahmah security station car park later}
<A>__{a car port. fleury and team moving around the area. fleury picks up some broken glass from the ground.}
<C>__{fleury}
<D>__{the car was parked here? al ghazi yes.}
<C>__{fleury}
<D>__{backed in? al ghazi yes.}
<A>__{fleury studies the scene.}
<C>__{fleury}
<D>__{they were attacked from the front. must have assumed the killers were fellow officers... have any of these men been identified? colonel al ghazi not yet. we will check certain neighborhoods. it is likely that the four men prayed at the same mosque.}
<C>__{janet mayes}
<D>__{the same mosque is enough to identify them, link them to a cell? colonel al ghazi yes. if the mosque is in suweidi.}
<C>__{adam leavitt}
<D>__{suweidi?}
<C>__{janet mayes}
<D>__{suweidi is a known militant stonghold. al qaeda could recruit from storefronts.}
<A>__{on fleury: he looks back at the homes, then up and around: he locks on the observation building in the distance.}
<C>__{fleury}
<D>__{can we go to check out some of these surrounding buildings? colonel al ghazi why?}
<C>__{fleury}
<D>__{seems reasonable that the planner had to observe and based on hamza's past history, it's consistent that he would want to video the attack. is that true? is that accurate? colonel al ghazi that is true.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{well, in order to video, in order to observe, you need a view.}
<A>__{fleury points to one particular building.}
<C>__{fleury}
<D>__{that building sees all three crime scenes.}
<A>__{al ghazi looks up to the building. back to fleury.}
<D>__{colonel al ghazi}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's outside the walls }
<C>__{adam leavitt}
<D>__{ c'mon now. this is insane: we got enough security to invade suweidi, let alone that building colonel al ghazi no you don't.}
<C>__{fleury}
<P>__{(to al ghazi, respectful)}
<D>__{could you ask?}
<C>__{fleury }
<D>__{we're already seeing the crime scenes individually why not all at once? colonel al ghazi any answer will take }
<C>__{fleury}
<D>__{ time. i understand.}
<A>__{fleury speaks slowly and clearly now: like he's cementing his words in his own head as he speaks them.}
<C>__{fleury }
<D>__{you have to ask the general, then the general would ask the prince. does it go higher or is that... is the prince the end of the chain?}
<A>__{al ghazi hesitates, can't help but be charmed. fleury clearly knows when to step on or lay off the gas. he's smooth... and highly effective: al ghazi nods `yes' to the strange half question.}
<C>__{fleury }
<D>__{we'll be at the community center.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{janet, wanna play hoops?}
