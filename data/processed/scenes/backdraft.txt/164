<L>__{interior fire department repair depot}
<A>__{a cavernous hall full of dozens of fire trucks loaded on jacks. rimgale's sedan's there, the repairman shaking his head in amazement at the undercarriage.}
<C>__{repairman}
<D>__{what the hell do you do with this thing?}
<A>__{rimgale's looking through the report brian's handed him.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{this is the copy of swayzak's manning report that was released. everybody on this job knows it's bullshit but we could never argue with the numbers. they're all airtight.}

<D>__{yeah? airtight?}
<A>__{he dumps three more reports on rimgale.}
<C>__{brian}

<C>__{brian}
<D>__{then who wrote the report?}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{it had to be someone who knows numbers. some kind of fancy accountant. but what's the connection?}

<D>__{i think it's time mr. swayzak and us had a little heart to heart talk.}
