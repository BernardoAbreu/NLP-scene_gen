<L>__{interior funky oahu bar day}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{drink up. then we'll talk.}
<A>__{rafe takes the challenge, and takes a long pull on one of the straws. red, anthony, billy, and several others enter the bar.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{rafe?!}
<A>__{they rush the table...}
<L>__{interior funky oahu bar later}
<A>__{they're all drinking, and the whole bar is rocking. rafe uses glasses to show his buddies tactics.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{they'll go under you because their planes are faster, then they run so you can't catch 'em. but then they'll come around and take you from behind like some americans will.}
<A>__{the last words bring the group to silence. the other guys drift away, to give them room.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{why be sorry? that's what you feel, it's better to come out with it.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{i didn't mean it.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{sure you did. so come on. say what you think.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{waitress! four beers!}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you don't wanna put beer over mai tai.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{if you can't keep up, don't drink yours.}
<A>__{the waitress delivers four bottles to the table. rafe takes a slow sip, then stares at danny.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{we gotta face some facts here.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{what facts are those?}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{i understand how it could happen. i know why any guy would love her. and i can't blame you that it happened. you thought i was dead, she was grieving, you were trying to help her.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i was grieving too.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{yeah, right. anyway, you didn't know.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{so what are you saying?}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{i'm saying now you do know. so it's time for you to fuck off.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you left her. how's that for a fact?}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{how's this for a fact? i loved her first.}
<A>__{danny takes a long pull of beer, and rafe does the same.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you know, you're a lousy drinker. drinking's supposed to make men feel bigger. it only makes you stupid. and weak.}
<A>__{rafe nods thoughtfully, and sets down his beer.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{how's this?}
<A>__{bam! he knocks danny out of the chair, flat on his ass. danny backhands the blood from the corner of his mouth.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you want it, you got it.}
<A>__{he kicks rafe in the back of the knee, then mule kicks him in the chest as he goes down, and the fight is on. the bar's bouncer, a big samoan, moves over to break them up but anthony steps in his way.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{let 'em fight, they need it.}
<A>__{the bouncer tosses anthony aside, but before he can move in to interrupt the fight, red breaks a lava volcano of mai tai over the bouncer's skull. the bartender picks up the phone to call the m.p.'s. rafe and danny are exchanging punches in the middle of the room. sailors sitting at the bar have swung around on their stools to watch the action. the other pilots are wincing with the punches their friends exchange, and bobbing and weaving as if in the fight themselves. a sailor tapes billy.}
<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{is this a private fight or can anybody jump in?}
<A>__{billy hits him. the whole bar erupts. rafe and danny are really having at it, fueled by so much emotion that nothing hurts. they're on the floor now, trying to rip each other apart. they struggle to their feet and rafe manages to knee danny in the balls. danny doubles over in pain.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{that hurt? i didn't think you had any balls.}
<A>__{without looking up, danny lunges at rafe, tackling him around the waist, driving him at the wall. but they don't hit the wall; they tumble through the back window of the bar not covered in glass, but fronds and wood and out into the back alley. they're lying there in the debris when they see the m.p. jeeps coming. they drag each other to their feet, and run away.}
