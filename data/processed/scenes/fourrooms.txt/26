<A>__{ted enters the bathroom, which appears shaken by an earthquake. towels and wet clothes are all over the place. an evening gown is flushed halfway down the toilet and pills are everywhere. sigfried is shouting from the other room to hurry. ted checks the cabinet, searching for a bottle marked "nitro." no luck. ted spots a small window set above the toilet. he figures this is the best chance he's got to make a break. ted goes for it. he manages to get his head and one arm through the window before he gets stuck. his legs dangle in the bathroom. struggle as he may, he can only hit the toilet bowl lever, which sends a loud flush sound out through the apartment.}
