<L>__{interior maddy's caravan. day}
<A>__{an exotic interior, many crocks and jars, bunches of herbs, wrapped papers of dried things, like a woodland apothecary store. inman wakes up. he finds himself in a small cot, wrapped in blankets, a poultice at his neck. he doesn't know where he is or how long he's been there.}
<L>__{exterior maddy's caravan. day}
<A>__{maddy's sitting on a stool. there's a circle of stones where her fire lives and she sets the tinder to it. inman emerges from the caravan. he's pale and unsteady.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{how long have i been sleeping?}
<C>__{maddy}
<D>__{not long enough.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{i can't stop here. i'm a deserter. they find me here things could be bad for you.}
<C>__{maddy}
<D>__{what they going to do? cut short my young life? sit down before you fall down.}
<A>__{she calls over a little goat. it ambles over affectionately and nuzzles into her hand. she strokes it and scratches under the chin. the creature gets increasingly tranquil.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{how long you been up here?}
<C>__{maddy}
<D>__{what year are we? '63?}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{last time i checked it was '64.}
<C>__{maddy}
<D>__{i'd say twenty six years.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{twenty six years!}
<C>__{maddy}
<D>__{i could move on anytime. i've seen most of the world anyway, richmond in the north, south almost to charleston. you're going somewhere or you are somewhere, what's the difference?}
<A>__{she's still stroking the goat. it looks as if it's asleep.}
<C>__{maddy}
<D>__{i've learned a person can survive off pretty much of a goat. i can't abide a chicken, but a goat gives you company and milk and cheese and then, when you need it, good meat.}
<A>__{in a single motion she has a knife in her hand and has slit the throat of the goat, putting the bowl underneath its neck to catch the blood, still stroking the goat, which blinks as if it were only surprised and not dying.}
<C>__{maddy}
<D>__{so you've been fighting?}
<C>__{inman}
<P>__{(as if he might break)}
<D>__{i could be at killing for days sometimes, in the hand to hand, my feet against the feet of my enemy and i always killed him and he never killed me.}
<C>__{maddy}
<D>__{he gave it a try, to look at you.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{i guess he did.}
<C>__{maddy}
<D>__{see i think there's a plan. there's a design. for each and every one of us.}
<A>__{during this she's shucked the skin off the goat with the authority of someone who's done this a thousand times.}
<C>__{maddy}
<D>__{you look at nature, a bird flies somewhere, picks up a seed, shits the seed out, a plant grows. bird's got a job, seed's got a job.}
<A>__{and the goat is now thin and pink, eyes bulging, a piece of meat.}
