<L>__{exterior gorge night}
<A>__{they run across the elevated root of an enormous tree a horizontal trunk big as an oak. wide shot as they cross a deep gorge. a waterfall shimmers silver in the polyphemus light. vines hang down a hundred feet into the gorge, and among them swoop stingbats and other night flyers.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{hey, slow down. look, i think we just got off on the wrong foot and }
<A>__{jake looks down, suddenly aware of the height.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{ you just have to get to know me. i'm jake. jake sull }
<A>__{a vine catches his spear and spins him off balance. he drops the spear and almost falls off the root.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{whooaaa shit!}
<A>__{neytiri catches him with one hand, gripping his bicep. he watches the spear cartwheel down to splash in the river. she pulls him upright. shouts at him in english and na'vi.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i need your help.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{you should not be here.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{so take me with you.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{no. you go back.}
<A>__{down angle from far above several woodsprites float down through the trees. follow them as they descend silently toward jake and neytiri. neytiri, sensing a presence, looks up to see the woodsprites, pulsing with purpose, float right towards jake. they dance gently around his shoulders and head.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(off her amazed look)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{more woodsprites gather around him. several alight on him. jake holds still, knowing he should be afraid but somehow he's not. he spreads his arms. more sprites come, landing all over his arms, hands, body.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{what are they?}
<A>__{cu neytiri reacting with a mixture of wonder and dread.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{atokirina'. seeds of the great tree very pure spirits.}
<A>__{jake now a pulsing, glowing, fluttering mass of light moves one hand slowly, not wanting to break the spell. he studies one of the sprites dancing on his palm until whoosshh! the woodsprites whirl up and away, scattering into the darkness.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{what was that all about?}
<A>__{neytiri seems shaken. she seizes his hand and pulls him after her.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{come!}
