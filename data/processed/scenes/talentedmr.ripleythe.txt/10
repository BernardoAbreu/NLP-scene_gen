<A>__{a vinyl record revolves in close up . an exuberant and mysterious voice is scat singing. wild. then the sound slides into a raucous big band jazz number: dizzy gillespie's the champ . a hand ejects the record. when the camera finds the man's face it is blindfolded . he's hot. he's wearing an undershirt. he's trying to identify the recording.}

<A>__{the man pulls of the blindfold, examines the record cover of the disc he's been trying to learn, needs to put on glasses to do so, is irritated by his mistake. he ejects the record. a pile of other jazz records are strewn across a cluttered table which includes classical sheet music and a paper keyboard. one hand idly mimes at the keys.}
