<L>__{exterior dock, colombo, sri lanka day}
<A>__{mac and gin stroll down the gangway, to the seedy, dangerous looking wharf. at the bottom of the gangway... ...a wooden board to mark the whereabouts of guests. each stateroom has a peg, which can be moved to aboard or ashore. mac moves the peg for 16... ...to the aboard position. and off they go.}
<L>__{interior small plane night}
<A>__{mac in his jump suit piloting the dehaviland dhc 53 across the endless black of the indian ocean. for the moment, he seems alone. then...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{down there. ten o'clock.}
<A>__{he means a tiny grouping of lights. way down there, against the darkness. he switches on the autopilot. goes back to... ...gin, waiting in her jump suit, sitting on a large pack of gear just beside the window of the jump door. next to her, a pack that is even larger. no fear in her eyes tonight. pure adrenaline.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{are you dumping fuel?}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{changed my mind. there's nothing on the instruments downrange. the longer she flies before she ditches, the less chance they notice on the bridge.}
<A>__{as she stands, he begins to strap the huge pack onto her body. jesus. with her chute, and the other gear attached, the load makes us uneasy. not her.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you should lose the oxygen tank at 8000 feet.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{and how do i judge that? babe's intuition?}
<A>__{he points to an altimeter device on his wrist. it says 12,000 feet. she cuts him a look.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{so i just ask you on the way down? or were you planning to e mail me.}
<A>__{he pulls out an identical device. strapping it to her wrist...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i hate a crybaby.}
<A>__{he straps the even larger gear pack to himself. checks the path of the tiny lights far below. then, looks in her eyes...}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{you can do this.}
<A>__{not merely reassurance. affection. something connective between them. you are my partner. her eyes send back that personal bond, and she nods. i can do this. good girl. he pulls on his oxygen mask, goggles. she does the same. he opens the door, air blasting in. one more look down below, and he holds up ten fingers. counts them down, nine...eight... she moves to the edge. watching him. and on zero, she... arches out into the starry void, and we go... with her, the incomparable rush of freefall, straining to see him follow, skillfully altering his position to gain on her, coming close. she is looking between him and her altimeter, as... ...his oxygen tank falls away, and she cuts hers loose, the air rushing past her, she looks down... ...the lights below are beginning to take the shape of the freighter. back up to mac, as he... pulls his chute, it is black and square, and jolts him to what seems like a full stop far above her, and she yanks her cord, but... ...nothing. it doesn't open. she is rocketing down, looking back up to see mac make an exaggerated cutting sign across his body, and she closes her eyes, pulls her secondary chute, which... pops open, jarring her violently, and she gasps with the shock. he is well above her now, she isoff course, frantically trying to manipulate her trajectory, seeing him swooping closer, the freighter looms in distance, she looks down and suddenly... ...the sea is rushing at her, she fights her braking mechanism, shouting at herself...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{flare, flare...}
<A>__{...and slams into the water, plunging down, twisting, disoriented cutting her chute loose, struggling not to get tangled, in a panic to break her light tube, which... ...glows yellow green, illuminating the freezing depths, she fits it around her head, fights now to pull out the small electric fan we've seen before, kicking herself toward the surface, fighting against the weight of her gear pack, she... ...flips the switch, and the fan becomes a propeller which rockets her upward, but she loses her hold on one handgrip, tries desperately to hang on with one hand, but it... ...pulls free, goes shooting off into the blackness without her, one instant of terror in her eyes, and... mac is there, diving at her with his propeller, she grasps his legs in a death grip, and suddenly, they are... at the surface, gin gasping for air, and he cuts his propeller, cradles her body with one strong arm, murmuring in her ear...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{it's over, it's over...}
<A>__{her eyes are wild.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{catch your breath, quickly. hang on for the wake.}
<A>__{she sees the freighter now, a black mountain cutting the sea, a huge wake pluming from its bow. she grabs his waist with all she's got.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{do it! go!}
<A>__{and he kicks the propeller to life, they zoom off, straight at the towering wake and burst through it, racing to the freighter's looming hull, speeding alongside, mac looking up to find... ...a series of metal rungs, which begin twelve feet above the water line, climbing the dizzying height to the freighter's deck, far above. mac has a kevlar rope with a grappling hook, and as he reaches the rungs, he... ...throws it high, one of the pronged hooks catching on a rung twenty feet above them...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{hold tight!}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{if you fucking insist!}
<A>__{and he lets go of the propeller, pulling both of them, laden with gear, out of the water with sheer brute strength. planting his feet against the outward curve of the hull, he climbs with all his strength, hand over hand, until he finally... ...grasps the bottom rung. he pulls them up, until she can grab on. they hold tight to their rung for a beat. he attaches them both with metal carabiner clips.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{if i were you, i'd watch the desserts.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{boy, i will bet you were in shape before you got old.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{too long ago to remember.}
<A>__{and pulls himself up to the second rung, so that he is standing an the first. offers her his hand...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i can take it from here, thanks.}
<A>__{suit yourself. they begin to climb up the rungs, like a tilted backwards ladder, re attaching their clips as they go.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{if you'd packed my primary chute right, i wouldn't ha...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{yes, you would. you're a girl.}
<A>__{up, up. and stop. they are nearly halfway to the top. looking across the curved hull to... ...a large circular hatch. thirty feet away. the goal. mac pulls from his pack... ...their suction cup gear. with practiced speed, they fasten cups to the balls of their feet, take hold of the hand rods with cups attached, and mac takes the lead as they begin to... ...move laterally across the hull's surface toward the hatch. mac is amazingly agile at the arduous process, scuttling sideways like a crab across the precariously tilted back hull. gin is deter mined, but falls well behind, intent on making every suction seal solid one. dark water races by beneath her., by the time she looks up at the hatch... he is gone.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{anytime you're ready.}
<A>__{she looks up sharply. he is above the hatch, attached to the hull by the balls of his feet, hanging down like a bat. noting her astonishment...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{better angle.}
<A>__{that it is. he has pulled a thick cylinder from his pack. it's a battery operated air wrench, and with a menacing whirr, only partially masked by the ship's wake, he begins to swiftly pop all the rivets around the hatch. gin has pulled out the slender welding tool we saw in the shower, and begins cutting through the metal seals around the hatch's rim. at thecrucial moment...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you might want to move aside...}
<A>__{which she barely does, as the hatch door plummets past her to the sea. big splash. gone. when she turns back, mac is already through the opening and she follows, their yellow green headlamps partially revealing... ...the maximum security hold. we've seen this with carlsby. the fork lift. the shadowy multitude of platforms on their gimbals, all swaying, in different directions with the plunging of the ship. gin just stands, staring everywhere, like she's broken into fort knox. the roar of the engines is louder here, and he moves close to her to speak beneath it...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{may i trouble you for the torch? or would you rather just dance.}
<A>__{oh. slightly embarrassed at her lack of split second efficiency, she tries to find the thing in her gear. after watching her fumble for a bit...}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i know i packed it.}
<A>__{...he just reaches in and pulls it out. a small lantern which he flicks on, brilliantly illuminating the entire hold. scans the platforms...polnts to a crate wrapped in 4 ply heavy duty plastic membrane.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{coal into diamonds. a wealth machine.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{how do you know that's it?}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{it's 12 by 9 by 7 feet. and it's the only thing worth waterproofing, in case the ship sinks.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{...you twit.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{hmmn?}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{i'm just finishing your sentence. can't you answer a question with out making me feel stupid?}
<A>__{he's heading toward the swaying platforms...}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{why would i bother?}
<A>__{he is climbing onto a lower platform, easily vaulting up to the magic crate. she follows, but it isn't as easy as he's made it look. she has to scramble, almost falling. he's already pulled from his gear... ...six rubber pouches. she hands him her welding tool, and he begins attaching the pouches to the top and sides of the crate. the plunging ship has the platform really rocking.}
<C>__{gin }
<D>__{they don't look like flotation bags...}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{shit. well then, let's forget the whole thing.}
<A>__{she stares at him.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{okay, it was a dumb ques...}
<A>__{his eyes come up. so fast that her breath stops. he looks plenty angry.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{let's get one thing straight. i don't work with partners much, because basically, i find most people to be idiots.}
<A>__{she swallows. hard.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you, in contrast, are first rate.}
<A>__{he watches the effect of that play across her eyes.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{and if i think so. maybe you should start thinking the same. now move your ass.}
<A>__{and goes back to work. she pauses a beat. then pulls out two lengths of kevlar rope. begins securing their platform to the one above, to minimize the amount of sway. as she struggles with this, she sees him finish by welding a very small gray box to the top of the crate. when he glances up, he sees her staring at the box.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{gps transponder. sends a scrambled signal by satellite...}
<A>__{he touches the device. it beeps. a light glows red.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{precise coordinates. you could find a golf ball in the gobi desert.}
<A>__{he rises. jumps down to the floor.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{where you g...}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{fork lift.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{that's my assignm...}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{unless you've got the keys, someone has to hot wire it.}
<A>__{oh.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{finish up on the floaters.}
<A>__{and heads off toward the fork lift. finish up? she looks at the rubber pouches. they seem finished to her. tugs at a couple. on pretty firmly. across the way, we hear the fork lift turn its engine over.}
<C>__{gin}
<D>__{won't they hear it?}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{over these engines? through five feet of steel?}
<A>__{she hurriedly secures the last of her kevlar lines.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{hell, if they do, they don't have the second key to get in.}
<A>__{he is driving up in the rickety fork lift. weaving around crates and equipment.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{thank god for redundant security.}
<A>__{he hops lightly from the fork lift, reaches up, and she jumps down}
