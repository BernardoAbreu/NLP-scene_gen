<L>__{interior hotel corridor (regency) that night}
<A>__{black & white iris shots continue imagistic, disassociative. a long corridor couple staggering down the red carpets, champagne bottles in hand. the count gets lost. pam laughing suddenly alone, notices, goes looking for jim... floating down this endless corridor with white doors and red carpet.}
<L>__{interior elevator}
<A>__{nico stripping... a superb body... riding the floors... jim taking an amyl nitrate with her... laughing... nico with that crazed german laugh... pamela pushing the elevator buttons wildly... the elevator opening on her. from pamela's pov nico down on her knees, her blonde head buried in jim's leather pants... jim pinned against the back wall, smiling dopically, eyes barely registering pam... who screams loud and long, hiding his eyes... not wanting to know... the images faster and more fragmented: pam beating at jim wildly. he's laughing. nico's laughing. the aristocrats in the hallway are laughing. the world is laughing with its madness.}
