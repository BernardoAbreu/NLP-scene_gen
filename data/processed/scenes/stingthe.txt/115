<A>__{hooker and gondorff are sitting alone in the back office while the work goes on outside. their conversation continues.}
<C>__{gondorff}
<D>__{no signs of trouble?}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{what do ya mean?}
<C>__{gondorff}
<D>__{you know, somebody tailin' ya. a torpedo or somethin'.}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(wanting to get off the subject)}
<D>__{no, not a thing.}
<A>__{gondorff has his doubts, but lets them ride.}

<B>__{other parts of the store}
<A>__{we concentrate on some of the fine details, i.e. garfield explaining how the ticker will read out to singleton and billie; curly jackson showing a younger con man how to mark the odds board properly.}
<C>__{gondorff }
<D>__{how 'bout lonnegan?}
<C>__{hooker }
<D>__{i gave him the breakdown just like ya told me to.}
<C>__{gondorff }
<D>__{and?}
<C>__{hooker }
<D>__{he threatened to kill me.}
<C>__{gondorff }
<D>__{hell, they don't do that and you know you're not gettin' through to 'em.}
<A>__{we concentrate on niles, who's making up the "boodles" or fake bankrollls. he puts a real $100 bill on the bottom, then two inches of cut green paper on top, and then another $100 bill on top of that, so that it looks like he has a whole stack of $100 bills. the bundle is then bound with a sealed label, like those used in banks, that says $10,000. we see that he has already made several of these bundles.}
<C>__{hooker }
<D>__{then he drove me home. he tried to put himself away as legit, so i went right into the pitch.}
<C>__{gondorff }
<D>__{did he hold you up on anything?}
<C>__{hooker }
<D>__{naw, he just sat there and listened. i don't know if he bought it or not.}
