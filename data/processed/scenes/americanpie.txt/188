<D>__{there's something i've been meaning to tell you, heather.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{oz}
<D>__{it's gonna sound really bad, but i want you to know.}
<A>__{she nods. they stop walking. oz swipes his feet around in the sand.}
<C>__{oz }
<D>__{see, uh, i'm a virgin. and me, kevin, jim, and finch, we all made this pact. that we would...lose our virginity... before high school was over.}
<A>__{heather is listening.}
<C>__{oz }
<D>__{and, see, tonight is supposed to be the night we all do it.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{this isn't the best way to proposition me.}
<C>__{oz}
<D>__{no, that's not what i mean. i mean look. you know what made me leave that game? coach was giving this speech, about not slacking off when you see the opportunity to score.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{this isn't any better, chris.}
<C>__{oz}
<D>__{no, see heather, what i realized is that...with you, it's not like i'm running towards the goal, trying to figure out the best way to score. and this may sound corny, but }
<A>__{he takes her hand.}
<C>__{oz }
<D>__{i feel like i've already won.}

<A>__{oz seems truly touched.}
<C>__{oz}
<D>__{dieter. my middle name is dieter.}
<A>__{heather nods, and speaks pensively.}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{hmm. you know that's}
<P>__{(cracking up)}
<D>__{really a shitty middle name!}
<C>__{oz}
<P>__{(laughing)}
