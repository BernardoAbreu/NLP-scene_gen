<L>__{interior manager's office elland road day (1974)}
<A>__{clough's face: staring out at the leeds players waiting on the training pitch. a deep breath.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{right. better go and make myself known.}
<A>__{clough removes his jacket. jimmy gordon and clough's sons watch as he walks out onto the training pitch...}
<L>__{exterior training pitch following day (1974)}
<A>__{clough walks out into the drizzle and towards the leeds}
<B>__{players..}
<C>__{clough}
<P>__{(up beat, clapping hands)}
<D>__{all right, gentlemen, gather around, please.}
<A>__{the players truculently gather round. clough watches them, notes their mood, then..}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{i might as well tell you now.}
<C>__{clo ugh }
<D>__{you lot may all be internationals and have won all the domestic honours there are to win under don revie, but as far as i'm concerned, the first thing you can do for me is to chuck all your medals and all your caps and all your pots and all your pans into the biggest fucking dustbin you can find because you've never won any of them fairly. you've done it all by bloody cheating.}
<A>__{silence from the players..}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{mr. william bremner. you're the captain. and a good one. but you're no good to the team and you're no good to me if you're suspended. i need you fit for every game, and i want good, clean, attractive football from my captain. setting an example.}
<A>__{clough turns to peter lorimer.}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{mr. lorimer, i hope you were listening because you're as good a footballer as i've ever seen, but you know how i feel about the way don let you harangue referees, fall over when you've not been touched, protesting and pointing, trying to get other players booked. we'll have no more of that.}
<A>__{clough turns to johnny giles..}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{and you, irishman. god gave you skill, intelligence, and the best passing ability in the game. what god did not give you was six studs to wrap around another player's knee.}
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{i don't know what you're talking about.}
<A>__{clough turns to norman hunter...}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{but you do, though, "bites yer legs".}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{people kick me, i kick them back.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{not with me as manager. do that on my watch, you'll be fined and stuck in the reserves.}
<P>__{(to all the players)}
<D>__{things are going to be a little different around here. without don. might feel a little strange at first. might pinch a little. like a new pair of shoes. but if you want your grandchildren to remember you for being something other than the dirty buggers you all were, if you want to be loved as real champions, worthy champions, you're going to have to work. and improve. and change.}
<P>__{(nods to jimmy gordon)}
<D>__{now let's start off by playing some seven a sides.}
<A>__{players stare at one another. bristling. disbelieving looks.}
<C>__{bremner}
<D>__{don never did that.}
<C>__{clough}
<D>__{well, i'm not don. and from now on i never want to hear that man's name again. ever. next player who mentions it, or what he did or didn't bloody do in the good ol' days, will spend a week cleaning my boots.}
<P>__{(clapping hands)}
<D>__{seven a side. keep it nice and clean, and sensible. no fifty fifty's.}
<A>__{clough sees that one side is a man short..}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{right, i will play myself. you might learn something, irishman. two hundred and fifty one goals in two hundred and seventy four starts.}
<A>__{clough skillfully traps the ball between his feet, flips it up onto this head down onto his chest, then "wham" volleys it into a distant goal..}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{like to see don fucking revie do that, eh?}
<A>__{clough removes his track suit trousers, rolls his neck. jimmy gordon quickly divides the players into two teams, blows the whistle.. the game starts. clough, leading by example, anxious to prove himself, is soon darting about, calling out...}
<C>__{clough }
<P>__{(clapping hands)}
<D>__{here, son. to feet. keep it simple. think and give. on the deck. nice and crisp. yes, to me, sniffer. to me.}
<A>__{clarke passes the ball. but it's a fifty fifty. another player bears down on clough..who refuses to pull out.. "crunch", a bone shaking tackle from "bites yer legs".}
<C>__{clough }
<D>__{oh, jeeeeeesussss!!!}
<A>__{clough is flattened. rolls around on the floor. jimmy gordon runs up to norman hunter..}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{fucking matter with you? he said no fifty fifty's.}
<A>__{hunter aggressively steps forward. nose to nose. he is immediately flanked by other aggressive leeds players. crowding the referee. intimidating him.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{what are you going to do about it? book me?}
<A>__{jimmy gordon backs off, visibly frightened. clough lies on the floor. in agony. holding his knee.}
