<L>__{interior blacksmith shop day}
<A>__{angled to include sheriff's office. the blacksmith, sam ellis, an elderly bent man in a leather apron stands at the forge in which he is heating the rim from the big wheel which lies on the table nearby. clay, a long legged wrangler in clean but faded work clothes stands near the forge pumping the bellows and watching his brother, a freckled kid of sixteen trying to roll a cigarette. steve has progressed to the most difficult step, that of licking and sealing the paper. clay reaches over and takes it from him. he puts the skinny cylinder in his mouth and steve lights it for him. the first third of the cigarette burns with one quick flare.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{how does she draw?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{a little hot.}
<A>__{sam lifts the rim to the wheel.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you want to get out of here before noon, maybe you should lend me a hand.}
<A>__{clay, the cigarette dangling from his lips, moves over to the table, picks up a hammer and helps sam hammer the rim on the wheel. steve stands watching.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{rate you're goin', we'll be here until winter.}
<A>__{together they lift the wheel and plunge it into the tub of water. steam rises to fill the blackened shed.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(amiably grumbling)}
<D>__{account of you, i miss out on the only excitement aspen's had for months.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you're too old to watch such goin's on.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{and i'm too young.}
<A>__{clay and sam spin the wheel in the tub.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i don't see no sense to makin' people leave town if they don't want to leave.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i don't either when people are that good lookin'. maybe that's why they were too good lookin'.}
<P>__{(philosophically)}
<D>__{but there'll be others along to take their place after a while when this quiets down. and everything will be fine until some busybody starts stirring up trouble.}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(mildly)}
<D>__{don't you ever run down?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(to steve)}
<D>__{some people just have to run other people's lives. now take clay. you want to amble up the street and see the fun and what does he say?}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(good natured)}
<D>__{you stick to your blacksmithin' and let me take care of steve.}
<A>__{from o.s. comes the sound of the approaching buckboard and crowd. steve hears the noise and moves to the front of the shed.}
