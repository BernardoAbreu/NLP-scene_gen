<L>__{interior emergency room. night}
<A>__{billy, unlit cigarette in his mouth, is having his hand wrapped in plaster by a lady doctor. in another life he might have dated her. not in this one.}
<L>__{interior french restaurant. night}
<A>__{a romantic restaurant. the best boston has (which isn't saying much, but whatever). colin, looking great, a man on the rise. madolyn in pearls, also looking great. but maybe the conversation has lapsed and the date gone south.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{you also do probation work, right?}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{that's right. i see "violent offenders".}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{bad guys.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{that's one way to look at it. not necessarily.}
<A>__{colin wonders if she's breaking his balls. a dessert arrives: some towering japanesey concoction with a fan of sugar candy spines, sitting in a pool of sauce. colin looks at it, fork poised. madolyn looks at it. he looks up at her.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{that have this and they don't have duck l'orange.}
<A>__{madolyn smiles: she likes him. even with the dinner long bitterness over the duck l'orange.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{was your dinner ok?}
<C>__{colin}
<P>__{(holding balloon of inappropriate wine)}
<D>__{oh, the lobster was excellent. i just thought, french restaurant...}
<A>__{the look at the dessert.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{i'm waiting for you to make your move.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{i don't know what you're gonna do, but if it moves i'm going to arrest it (shoot it).}
<A>__{madolyn laughs. colin sees his shot: he's got her laughing.}
<C>__{colin }
<D>__{what's it like having people "find themselves?" all day long people "finding themselves." does it get messy with all those feelings flying around the room?}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{why, does that make you uncomfortable?}
<A>__{colin stares at her. water glass nearly goes over.}
<C>__{madolyn }
<D>__{you know what freud said about the irish?}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{yes i do.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{if you actually do i will see you again.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{who says i want to see you again?}
<C>__{madolyn}
<P>__{(concerned, perhaps unexpectedly)}
<D>__{don't you?}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{yes, course i do.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{what freud said about the irish is we're the only people impervious to psychoanalysis.}
<A>__{madolyn is impressed.}
<C>__{colin }
<D>__{tough luck for you with a client list of mick cops, isn't it. "opening up"? good luck to you.}
<A>__{colin laughs but looks nervous about the concept of "opening up".}
<C>__{colin }
<D>__{why do you do it?}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{some people do get better.}
<A>__{colin takes it seriously; admires it.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{fair enough.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{sometimes, though, i want people to forget about their personal bullshit and do their jobs.}
<A>__{unsaid: like i do.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{including the criminals?}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{if they don't do their jobs you don't have one.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{me? i'd just arrest innocent people. i will arrest you right now.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{you're trouble.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{you don't know the half of it.}
