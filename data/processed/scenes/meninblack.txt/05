<L>__{exterior road texas mexico border night}
<A>__{on the road, the ins agents pull their guns and run toward the rise.}
<L>__{exterior desert clearing night}
<A>__{kay has an arm around janus, whom he is leading further into the clearing. janus is white, shaking, eyes like silver dollars.}
<C>__{agent janus}
<D>__{th th th }
<C>__{kay}
<P>__{(helping)}
<D>__{"that."}
<C>__{agent janus}
<D>__{that wasn't wasn't wasn't }
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{human, i know. oops. got some entrails on you.}
<A>__{he takes out a handkerchief and wipes off the agent's face. as he does, janus looks back to where mikey blew up. then at kay. and then up at the stars. the other ins agents burst over the rise, shouting questions.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{okay, everybody, situation's under control, calm down. if you'll just give me your attention for a moment i will tell you what happened.}
<A>__{from over the rise, car engines whine in the distance and headlights start to flash around them. kay reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tubular metallic device the size of a pocket recorder. he checks his watch, figures in his head, then dials an electronic counter on the side of the device up to "08."}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{this is called a "neuralyzer." a gift from some friends from out of town. the red eye here isolates and measures the electronic impulses in your brain. more specifically, the ones for memory.}
<A>__{behind him, six more men in black, all wearing black suits and sunglasses, come over the hill. kay barks a few orders to them.}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{gimme a splay burn on the perimeter, please; holes at 40, 60, and 80. 2nd ins agent what in the hell is going on?!}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{exactly the right question. and the answer lies right here. pay attention.}
<C>__{janus}
<D>__{who are you, really?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{really? i'm just a figment of your imagination.}
<A>__{he holds up the neuralyzer. the agents peer closely at it. kay reaches into his pocket, puts on his own black sunglasses and pushes a button on the side of the neuralyzer. a blinding flash a tenth of a second long sears the agents' eyeballs. they stare blankly.}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{god, we're a gullible breed.}
<A>__{behind him, tongues of fire blast from a flame thrower held by one of the men in black. kay looks back at the ins agents, who are just coming around, as if awakening from a concussion.}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{i mean it, fellas, you are lucky to be alive after a blast like that.}
<A>__{the agents look around, confused.}
<C>__{agent janus}
<D>__{what blast?}
<A>__{kay gestures behind him, where the men in black are now using fire extinguishers to douse the flames they themselves started.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{underground gas vein, genius. you guys need to exercise more caution before discharging your firearms.}
<A>__{he jabs a finger into janus' chest.}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{especially you.}
<A>__{dee has moved away from them all and is sitting on a rock, staring up at the night sky, his sunglasses dangling idly from one hand. kay steps away from the group and finds him. he sits down next to him.}
<C>__{dee}
<D>__{i'm sorry. about...back there.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{happens.}
<C>__{dee}
<D>__{didn't used to.}
<A>__{he holds up his hands, which tremble with age.}
<C>__{dee }
<D>__{the spirit's willing, kay, but the rest of me...}
<A>__{he looks up, at the million stars shining overhead.}
<C>__{dee }
<D>__{they're beautiful, aren't they?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{dee}
<D>__{the stars. we never just look. anymore.}
<P>__{(back to kay)}
<D>__{i will tell ya, kay. i will miss the chase.}
<A>__{kay pulls his neuralyzer from his pocket and looks down at it.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{no. you won't.}
