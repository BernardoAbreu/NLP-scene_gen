<L>__{interior kitchen morning.}
<A>__{sethe has prepared all the food that was left and placed it on one plate which she sets on the table. she stands at the stove, with her back to us, picking crusted pieces of food off the bottom of the pan. beloved moves straight to the chair in front of the place and begins to eat, shovelling the food into her mouth. denver sees her mother covertly eating the burnt pan crumbs, as she pretends to wash the dishes.}
