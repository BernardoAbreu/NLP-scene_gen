<A>__{full shot waverly quarters (night) this is the party later that evening. some people are dancing. others are grouped about, and there is a general home party atmosphere. the general, martha and susan are seen helping everyone to feel at home. the camera starts on a long shot and dollies through the group, passing sylvia, where ad lib comments about the impending baby are sketchily heard. the camera continues toward the piano, where bob and betty are examining the music sheet of a man chases a girl. betty looks up and the camera follows her look to phil, who is dancing with rita. rita nestles up close to phil. this is seen by bob and betty. bob smiles. close shot phil and rita on closer view, we can see that rita is the aggressor.}
<C>__{phil}
<P>__{(referring to the grip)}
<D>__{don't you want me to breathe?}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{not especially.}
<C>__{phil}

<P>__{(evidently rita has}
<D>__{deliberately stepped}
<P>__{on his instep)}
<A>__{scene from bob's viewpoint betty is walking over to the dancing couple and deliberately cuts in on rita, who is displeased, but can do nothing but yield. bob's reaction still implies that this is understandable since betty loves phil. he turns back toward the piano, and other couples are between him and betty and phil. still at the same camera distance, we see betty turning phil over to judy. close shot phil and judy judy is a little cool.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{nothing is the matter.}
<C>__{phil}

<D>__{yes, that's true. i'm one of the close ones. that's my type.}
<A>__{he holds her closely, by force, dancing, smiling and pleased with himself. med. full shot room the dance music stops. the people disperse. med. close shot at piano harry, the piano player, is playing the last half of a man chases a girl. bob and betty are leaning over the piano, bob humming the melody. betty pantomimes to the others to quiet down. bob starts to sing the lyric. in the second chorus, he is joined in the singing by betty. during this chorus we cut to : show various reactions of the group, and end on phil, sitting close to judy, holding her hand. close two shot phil and judy we hear bob and betty, off scene, continuing to the end of the second chorus, on which phil, sotto voce, sings the last four bars.}
<C>__{phil}

<D>__{and once you've caught him, don't ever let him go.}
<A>__{applause follows the song. phil gets up.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, i would like to make an announcement.}
<A>__{full shot crowd everyone quiets, waiting to hear the announcement.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{it is my pleasure to identify the man who has been doing the chasing. i am him! or he! or it! anyway, judy has caught me. what i'm trying to say is, we're engaged.}
<A>__{he looks fondly at judy, taking it for granted she is overwhelmed at this method of announcing to her that he is going to marry her. he hugs her amidst a general reaction of congratulations. med. shot bob he is flabbergasted. med. shot group phil and judy are separated by the congratulators. betty, hiding her emotion, grips phil's arm.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i hope you realize that you're getting he most wonderful girl in the world.}

<C>__{bob}
<D>__{don't take this too much to heart. phil is a great kid but constancy isn't his long suit.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i'm not the least bit worried.}
<P>__{(phil and judy enter from the kitchen)}
<D>__{frankly, this couldn't come at a better time. they want me to come back to the carousel again i used to sing there before judy and i teamed up and i had to turn it down because they can only use a single.}
<P>__{(not too well)}
<D>__{so this couldn't be more convenient. you stay with the show and i will go back to the carousel.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{when did you get this offer?}

<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i threw it away. what is this, a third degree? you don't think i made it up?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{yes, i do.}
<A>__{there is a pause, and waverly, who has been watching each one, speaks.}
<C>__{waverly}
<D>__{well now, i wouldn't bet any large sum of money on that, since i took the message over the telephone, and i had to deliver the telegram.}
<P>__{(to take the tension off)}
<D>__{and she didn't tip me, either.}
<A>__{betty looks at him gratefully.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{oh, betty!}
