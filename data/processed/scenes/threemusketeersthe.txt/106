<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior milady's chamber at inn night}
<A>__{d'artagnan and milady face each other on a rug in front of the roaring fire. the plate of food between them is empty. they drink wine from goblets. d'artagnan drains his cup, and stares into the burning embers. milady speaks quietly, with seeming compassion:}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{you are sad.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i was thinking about my friends.}
<A>__{milady knows when to speak, and when to listen. she looks at d'artagnan with gentle expression, allows him to continue. the warm room, the wine, her kindness. all conspire to loosen his tongue. d'artagnan speaks quietly, from the heart:}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{the three best friends a man could have. we were separated on our way to calais. i'm afraid i will never see them again.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{what brings you here?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i'd like to tell you. but i can't.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{'important business.'}
<A>__{d'artagnan nods. he wants to impress her. he wants her to know how brave he is. and milady is well aware of it. she looks down, assumes a more vulnerable pose.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{i understand. men make bold plans in secret. and women wait... to mourn, or to celebrate the outcome. i know from experience, it's a lonely vigil.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{all i can tell you is... i'm on a mission for the king.}
<C>__{milady}
<P>__{(looks up; laughs lightly)}
<D>__{i've heard that one before.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i'm serious.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{you are a young man. and young men are given to exaggeration. however, if you would like to entertain me with a story, i'm eager to hear it. and please, make it very brave, filled with handsome knights and beautiful ladies. i know, a dragon }
<A>__{there is nothing a man is more loathe to experience than a woman who does not take him seriously. d'artagnan acts accordingly, and reveals:}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i came to calais to stop a spy from sailing to england.}
<C>__{milady}
<P>__{(alert; though}
<D>__{d'artagnan doesn't}
<P>__{see it)}
<D>__{a spy...?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{i believe you...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{aren't you afraid?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{musketeers are not afraid of anything.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{i knew it. i knew you were a musketeer the moment i saw you.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{you did?}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{of course.}
<P>__{(with sudden concern)}
<D>__{but, d'artagnan, if this spy was to find out you are here, your life could be in grave danger.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{a musketeer is not afriad of danger.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{i'm dangerous. you're not afraid of me?}
<A>__{her tone heralds a sudden shift. d'artagnan sees the look in her eyes, can almost feel her lips upon him. but he resists. there is constance's memory to consider. and midnight as it approaches.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{you're not dangerous.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{then what am i?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{you're... beautiful.}
<A>__{milady covers him with caresses. d'artagnan resists slightly, but she presses closer, she will not be denied. milady leans close, runs a fingertip along the line of his jaw. her dressing gown falls open at the top, enough for d'artagnan to see her breasts as they press against the silk beneath it. milady speaks as her finger traces.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{beauty, danger. they are the same.}
<A>__{and with that, she reaches up to her hair, an ivory comb... on d'artagnan he cannot continue. constance, the hour, a confusion he cannot deny.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i'm sorry }
<A>__{d'artagnan pulls back just as milady's arm arcs down toward his neck, holding a long sharp stick pin, almost a dagger, attached to an ivory comb. d'artagnan sees it in the nick of time, parries with his free hand, knocking the dagger to the rug. milady leaps after it, hands outstretched. d'artagnan follows, battles for the dagger, stunned with fear and surprise:}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{what're you doing?! have you lost your mind?!}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{you came to calais to stop a spy from sailing to england.}
<A>__{d'artagnan nearly chokes on the knowledge. milady is the messenger he is seeking. he grabs the dagger, rolls to the side. milady staggers after, the shoulder of her negligee rips open. d'artagnan sees the soft white flesh, reacts with shock, recognition she bears the brand of the fleur de lis. the infamous mark of the murderess. just as athos told it to him. not so long ago.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{my god...}
<C>__{milady}
<P>__{(crying out)}
<D>__{parker!!}
<A>__{the chamber door flies open. henri and parker, the indochinese bodyguard, appear. parker faces d'artagnan with a half smile. he holds out his hands, both empty. and steps toward him. d'artagnan looks at the dagger in his right hand. then, unwilling to fight the man with an unfair advantage, he tosses the dagger to the side, steps forward to meet him. parker disposes of d'artagnan with lightning speed. a series of unexpected kicks, brutally efficient blows. the young man is unfamiliar with, and no match for, the martial arts. parker hoists d'artagnan to his feet, dazed. henri picks up the dagger with bad intentions. milady straightens her dressing gown, adjusts her hair, and commands:}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{kill him.}
<A>__{parker holds him fast. henri steps forward. and d'artagnan thinks fast.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{you can kill me. but a surprise waits for you in england. that even buckingham can't prevent.}
<C>__{milady}
<P>__{(stops henri with a gesture)}
<D>__{what... surprise?}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{that's one thing i will never tell you.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{d'artagnan. you are young, vain, and foolish. but i do not know if you are clever.}
<A>__{d'artagnan's expression reveals nothing. except to suggest the existence of a secret he is bravely keeping. duly deceived, though she doesn't know it, milady changes her mind.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{we'll take him with us.}
<C>__{milady }
<P>__{(to d'artagnan,}
<D>__{with a nod at}
<P>__{parker)}
<D>__{parker will devise ways to convince you to share your final secret with me. it is a long voyage.}
<A>__{milady's eyes show nothing but cold cruelty.}
