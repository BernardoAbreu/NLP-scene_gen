<L>__{interior morgue, basement, alpine grove, late night}
<A>__{the drawer is yanked open to reveal starks' still, drenched face. becker, gries and the orderlies stand above him.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{take him out of it.}
<A>__{the orderlies unstrap the jacket from his body. blood from his chafed skin drips onto the burial slab. starks' eyes remain closed.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{william. william, can you hear me?}
<A>__{we hear becker's voice as it sounds to starks...muted. starks' eyes open only enough for him to see the people's faces morph chillingly into one another's.}
<D>__{dr. gries [less muffled] pulse is 16, temp, just a hair under 90. 'bout right for three hours of psychosis.}
<C>__{nurse harding}
<D>__{that's not enough, is it?}
<A>__{becker looks at starks' battered body.}
<D>__{becker [wearily, indifferently] it's enough for now. take him to the infirmary and let him recover there.}
