<A>__{vasquez rolls aside as a gout of napalm shoots through the crew door, setting the interior on fire. hicks is rolling the door closed when vasquez lunges, clawing out the opening. he stops her, dragging her inside.}

<D>__{let's go!}
<A>__{ripley jams reverse. nails the throttle. the apc bellows backward up the ramp. hudson disappears under a pile of equipment as a storage rack breaks free. hicks gets the door almost closed. suddenly claws appear at the edge. newt screams. against the combined efforts of hicks, burke and vasquez the door is being slowly wrenched open from outside. hicks yells at a paralyzed gorman.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{get on the goddamn door!}
<A>__{gorman backs away, eyes wide. hicks jams his shoulder against the latching lever and frees one hand to raise his 12 gauge. an alien head wedges through the opening, its hideous mouth opening. and hicks jams his shotgun muzzle between its jaws and pulls the trigger! blam! the creature is flung backward, its shattered head fountaining acid blood. the spray eats into the door, the deck, hits hudson on the arm. he shrieks. they slide the door home and dog it tight.}
