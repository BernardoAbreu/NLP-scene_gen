<L>__{interior restaurant. night.}
<A>__{wilson and elaine at a table.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{... no, i went in for more improving pastimes. philosophy classes, language courses, european history, all that lark. did you know that in paris in the eighteenth century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{sounds like beverly hills.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{here, are you always this sarky?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{sarcastic, moi? maybe i will mellow when my ship comes in. it's expected any day now. i'm all packed and ready to go.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{weren't you on a television series?}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(has he seen it?)}
<D>__{if it played in england somebody owes me money. who told you that eddie?}
<C>__{wilson}
<P>__{(yes)}
<D>__{said it went on for donkey's years.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{three seasons. they found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of mormons on the chisum trail.}
<P>__{(blinks coquettishly)}
<D>__{i was wife number three the ingenue.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{oh, it just ended, then.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{now who's being sarcastic?}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{when you've lost as many years as i have, love, puts things in perspective, know what i mean.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went.}
<P>__{(raises her drink)}
<D>__{it must've been the bars.}
<A>__{their food arrives.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{it's a kind of prison, doing a series. early to bed, early to rise, no time off for good behavior, you grab the boodle for as long as it lasts.}
<P>__{(the kicker)}
<D>__{only difference is you can't get arrested afterwards.}
<A>__{wilson appears fascinated by the cold glasses of water on the table. ice cubes clinking as he holds his. a busboy bringing them to other people, too, just like that, without anyone even asking.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{i can't believe jenny told you all that. about me. she was always so embarrassed.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{not embarrassed.}
<C>__{wilson}
<P>__{(correcting)}
<D>__{ashamed.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{not ashamed.}
<A>__{wilson looks at her. okay. what then.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{disappointed.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{she never told eddie, though.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{she never told anyone else.}
<P>__{(making light now)}
<D>__{about the convict strain or is it stain? no, i was privileged. i was someone who helped jenny efface her past.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{how'd you manage that, then.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{when i'm not honing my craft in episodic television i do double duty as a voice coach. not that her accent would have hobbled her progress. not with that look.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{yeah, well, she started all that in london.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{modelling.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{learnin' 'ow to speak proper.}
<P>__{(putting it on a bit there. then, upper crust:)}
<D>__{central school of speech and drama. it's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. at seventeen. they offered her a place at rada n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was jenny. she could talk posh without any training, when she was knee high to a grasshopper.}
<P>__{(indicating himself)}
<D>__{show up the old man, you know.}
<A>__{elaine smiles slightly. none of this information new to her. but warming to this man.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{you weren't disappointed in her, then.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{in jenny? 'course not. how could i be. 'course i wasn't.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{she was twenty one when she came to me.}
<P>__{(looks at him)}
<D>__{... straight from leaving you.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{footloose and fancy free.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{she was happy here. however the two of you might have parted. don't think she wasn't.}
<A>__{it's because wilson thinks the opposite that he's here. looks at elaine.}
<C>__{wilson}
<D>__{that's the trouble, n' it.}
<P>__{(hard as nails again)}
<D>__{she enjoyed life.}
