<L>__{interior tudor's apartment night}
<A>__{janine sits down in front of the tv set. after a moment or two she gets up, turns the set off, and flops back down on the sofa with her vogue. she doesn't notice a trail of bloody slime leading from the bedroom to the inside door of the milk box. in the bedroom, a hand reaches down and pulls back a bedsheet to reveal a naked abdomen. it is tudor's abdomen, and he reaches out with trembling fingers to touch a lump the size of a chicken egg stretching the skin to one side of his navel. tudor watches the lump in the muted light of his bedroom. he gradually extends his hand toward the lump, which disappears the instant it's touched.}
<C>__{tudor}
<P>__{(delirious, voice strained, whispering)}
<D>__{come here, boy. here, boy, here.}
<A>__{he taps and scratches the skin near his navel, as though trying to lure a cat into attacking his fingers. he is propped up in bed, sweating profusely, half dressed. he looks weak and drained, but still manages to smile with maniacal intensity, his eyes wide and bright.}
<C>__{tudor}
<D>__{come on, fella. thataboy. you and me, we're gonna be friends, aren't we?}
<A>__{we can now see that the sheets are twisted, the pillows half off the bed. tudor begins drumming on his abdomen. gradually, cautiously, the lump under tudor's skin returns. he tries to seize the lump with his fingers and it shrinks back, almost disappearing into his abdominal cavity again. tudor seems disappointed.}
<C>__{tudor}
<D>__{no, no, no. don't run away, boy. i'm not going to hurt you. not going to hurt you. we're going to be friends. friends.}
<A>__{the lump returns again. gently, tudor begins stroking it. the lump seems to respond by pulsing slightly, the rhythm strangely masturbatory.}
<C>__{tudor}
<P>__{(soothingly)}
<D>__{attaboy.}
<P>__{(closing his eyes in}
<D>__{bliss and smiling}
<P>__{again)}
<D>__{attaboy.}
<A>__{in the living room, janine suddenly realizes that if the tv set was on, nick must be home. she gets to her feet and walks to the bedroom. inside the bedroom, we see the door open. light floods the room as janine enters. janine sees tudor sprawled out on the bed.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{nick? i didn't know you were home. what's wrong? what are you doing? you're almost falling out of bed. how are you feeling?}
<A>__{tudor twists around to see who has spoken, eyes wide but now unsmiling. with the same motion, he pulls the covers over his abdomen to hide the lumps from janine. janine stands at the bedroom door for an instant, then approaches the bedside. she moves as though her hands were tied at her sides, as though she is quite consciously holding herself together.}
<C>__{janine}
<P>__{(tenderly, but with}
<D>__{caution, as though}
<P>__{expecting a blow)}
<D>__{nick, does your stomach hurt? can i see those bumps on your tummy, can i?}
<A>__{she reaches out to pull back the covers again, but he rolls away from her.}
<C>__{tudor}
<D>__{go away. leave me alone.}
<A>__{janine straightens up. her hands come up to her face and tears well up in her eyes.}
<C>__{janine}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{oh, why won't you let me help you?}
<A>__{she turns and walks angrily out of the room, slamming the door behind her. tudor rolls over slowly on to his back, eyes wide and shining, smiling again.}
<C>__{tudor}
<P>__{(murmuring)}
<D>__{attaboy, attaboy.}
