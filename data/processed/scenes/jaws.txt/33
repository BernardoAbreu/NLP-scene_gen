<L>__{interior brody house night dining room}
<A>__{brody and ellen, sean and michael, have all finished dinner. brody's plate is untouched, a virgin meatloaf. his glass, on the other hand, is well used, with the remnants of a stiff scotch and ice. he is staring across the table at the youngest, sean, who makes a face at him. he makes a face back. they play this game together for a few minutes.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{c'mere and give daddy a kiss.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{because he needs it.}
<A>__{sean gives daddy the kiss. brody shoos him and michael off to bed. ellen, who is feeling progressively more left out with each passing moment, gets up abruptly and clears a few dishes. brody is not letting her into his world for the moment, and it shows. there's a knock at the door.}
<C>__{hooper }
<D>__{martin brody residence?}
<A>__{ellen opens the door for him.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{hi. i'm matt hooper. if your husband is here, i'd like to talk to him.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{so would i. come on in.}
<A>__{hooper enters. he's carrying a couple of bottles of wine which he picked up in town. he sits down near brody.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{would you like something? some coffee?}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(seeing brody's plate)}
<D>__{is anyone having this...?}
<A>__{he starts in on it, as soon as someone has indicated "go ahead."}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{dynamite!}
<P>__{(to brody)}
<D>__{how was your day...?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{swell.}
<A>__{they exchange a long look that evolves into a slightly desperate, but shared laughter.}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(producing wine)}
<D>__{here... one red, one white.}
<A>__{they laugh some more. ellen is again left out of it.}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(boning his fish)}
<D>__{ummm. really good.}
<A>__{brody begins stripping the foil off the wine, screwing in a corkscrew, etc.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{my husband tells me you're in sharks.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{i wouldn't put it that way. but i love sharks.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{you love sharks?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{i do.}
<P>__{(he tells a story}
<D>__{about his boyhood}
<P>__{and a shark)}
<D>__{but you've still got a problem here, there's a shark just off the island somewhere.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{how come you have to tell them that?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{excuse me, but what are you talking about? didn't they catch the shark this afternoon? it was on the cape station news.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{they caught a shark, not the shark. big difference. i could've proved it this afternoon, by cutting that one open and examining his stomach contents. also, his bite was too small.}
<A>__{brody has the cork out of the wine. pop.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{i was lucky to find that in town it's an estate bottled vintage year...}
<A>__{brody takes the fine wine, and pours it into his drink glass filling the tumbler to the top with ice cubes, diluted scotch, and the wine.}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(as brody pours)}
<D>__{we ought to let it breathe... whatever.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{let's all have a drink.}
<A>__{he extends the bottle to hooper, who politely accepts a token sip. he takes some for himself, and offers some to ellen.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{you too, sweetheart...}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(toasting)}
<D>__{here's to your husband, the only other rational man on the island. day after tomorrow, i will be gone, and he'll be the only one.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{you're leaving?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{going out on the 'aurora.'}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{is that a boat?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{is it! the best funded research expedition to ever study the shark... around the world in 18 months.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{like those cousteau specials on television? i think it's for the kids, but i love them.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{better than cousteau, or compagno with computers, telemetry, defense department funding...}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{i saw a show with sea otters, and a big turtle... mikey loved it. made me promise to get him one. will you live on the boat?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{yep.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{martin hates boats. hates the water. on the ferry to the mainland, he sits in the car the whole way over. he's got this childhood thing, there's a clinical word for it.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{drowning. lemme ask you something. is it true most attacks take place in three feet of water, around 10 feet from the beach?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{yeah. like the kid on your beach. i wish i could've examined that shark they caught...}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{something else. do most attacks go unreported?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{about half of them. a lot of 'missing swimmers' are really shark victims.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{there's a kind of a lone shark, called, uh...}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{rogue?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{yeah. rogue. picks out an area where there's food and hangs out there as long as the food supply lasts?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{it's called territoriality. it's a theory.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{and before 1900, when people first starting swimming for recreation, before public bathing and resorts, there were very few shark attacks, cause sharks didn't know what they were missing?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{you could say that.}
<A>__{brody digests all this; confirmation of facts he has gleaned in his newly acquired knowledge of the shark species. there is a long pause.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{why don't we have one more drink, you and i, and then we go down and cut open that old shark and see for sure what's inside him, or not.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{can you do that?}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{i am chief of police. i can do anything i want.}
<P>__{(to hooper)}
<D>__{you want to come?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{i'm flattered you should ask.}
<A>__{he gets up and they both start out. ellen watches them go.}
