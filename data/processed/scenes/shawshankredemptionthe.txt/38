<L>__{int andy's cell night (1947)}
<A>__{andy lies staring at the darkness, unable to sleep.}
<L>__{ext exercise yard day (1947)}
<A>__{exercise period. red plays catch with heywood and jigger, lazily tossing a baseball around. red notices andy off to the side. nods hello. andy takes this as a cue to amble over. heywood and jigger pause, watching.}
<C>__{andy}
<P>__{(offers his hand)}
<D>__{hello. i'm andy dufresne.}
<A>__{red glances at the hand, ignores it. the game continues.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{the wife killin' banker.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{how do you know that?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{i keep my ear to the ground. why'd you do it?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{i didn't, since you ask.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{hell, you'll fit right in, then.}
<P>__{(off andy's look)}
<D>__{everyone's innocent in here, don't you know that? heywood! what are you in for, boy?}
<C>__{heywood}
<D>__{didn't do it! lawyer fucked me!}
<A>__{red gives andy a look. see?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{what else have you heard?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{people say you're a cold fish. they say you think your shit smells sweeter than ordinary. that true?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{ain't made up my mind yet.}
<A>__{heywood nudges jigger. watch this. he winds up and throws the ball hard right at andy's head. andy sees it coming out of the corner of his eye, whirls and catches it. beat. he sends the ball right back, zinging it into heywood's hands. heywood drops the ball and grimaces, wringing his stung hands.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{i understand you're a man who knows how to get things.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{i'm known to locate certain things from time to time. they seem to fall into my hands. maybe it's 'cause i'm irish.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{i wonder if you could get me a rock hammer?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{what is it and why?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{you make your customers' motives a part of your business?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{if you wanted a toothbrush, i wouldn't ask questions. i'd just quote a price. a toothbrush, see, is a non lethal sort of object.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{fair enough. a rock hammer is about eight or nine inches long. looks like a miniature pickaxe, with a small sharp pick on one end, and a blunt hammerhead on the other. it's for rocks.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{rocks.}
<A>__{andy squats, motions red to join him. andy grabs a handful of dirt and sifts it through his hands. he finds a pebble and rubs it clean. it has a nice milky glow. he tosses it to red.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{quartz?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{quartz, sure. and look. mica. shale. silted granite. there's some graded limestone, from when they cut this place out of the hill.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{i'm a rockhound. at least i was, in my old life. i'd like to be again, on a limited scale.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{yeah, that or maybe plant your toy in somebody's skull?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{i have no enemies here.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{no? just wait.}
<A>__{red flicks his gaze past andy. bogs is watching them.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{word gets around. the sisters have taken a real shine to you, yes they have. especially bogs.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{tell me something. would it help if i explained to them i'm not homosexual?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{neither are they. you have to be human first. they don't qualify.}
<P>__{(off andy's look)}
<D>__{bull queers take by force, that's all they want or understand. i'd grow eyes in the back of my head if i were you.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{thanks for the advice.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{that comes free. but you understand my concern.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{if there's trouble, i doubt a rock hammer will do me any good.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{then i guess you wanna escape. tunnel under the wall maybe?}
<P>__{(andy laughs politely)}
<D>__{i miss the joke. what's so funny?}
<C>__{andy}
<A>__{you'll know when you see the rock hammer.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{what's this item usually go for?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{my standard mark up's twenty percent, but we're talkin' about a special object. risk goes up, price goes up. call it ten bucks even.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{ten it is.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{i will see what i can do.}
<P>__{(rises, slapping dust)}
<D>__{but it's a waste of money.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{oh?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{folks who run this place love surprise inspections. they turn a blind eye to some things, but not a gadget like that. they'll find it, and you'll lose it. mention my name, we'll never do business again. not for a pair of shoelaces or a stick of gum.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{i understand. thank you, mr...?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{red. the name's red.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{red. i'm andy. pleasure doing business with you.}
<A>__{they shake. andy strolls off. red watches him go.}
<C>__{red }
<D>__{i could see why some of the boys took him for snobby. he had a quiet way about him, a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here. he strolled. like a man in a park without a care or worry. like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place.}
<P>__{(resumes playing catch)}
<D>__{yes, i think it would be fair to say i liked andy from the start.}
