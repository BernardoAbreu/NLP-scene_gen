<L>__{interior new york theater, projection booth night}
<A>__{the soothing whir of the projector as hitchcock stands next to it... but the sound of the audience below tittering nervously is anything but reassuring.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{but they're laughing too much.}
<A>__{he peers down through the tiny window but can't see a bloody thing.}
<L>__{interior new york theatre, downstairs lobby a minute later}
<A>__{hitch inches open the door and peers through the crack at the audience but now he can't read them. are they gripped with suspense or do they just hate it? from the lobby we see}
<C>__{hitch}
<A>__{as he closes the door and leans back against the wall of the empty corridor. a scared, lonely, corpulent figure. totally powerless. there's nothing for him to do but wait. and wait. and wait. across the foyer, a spotty young theatre employee sweeps up ticket stubs and empties ashtrays, quietly going about his business, entirely oblivious... on hitch's face as he grips the railing. this is taking far too long. and then finally the sweetest sound in the world a blood curdling scream. soon the whole audience screams in terror... then breaks into laughter again... nervous laughter this time, the best kind.}
<C>__{hitch}
<A>__{as he gestures with his hands, a conductor leading his orchestra, raising them up again as the audience starts screaming again right on cue}
<B>__{pushing tighter on hitch}
<A>__{as the dam breaks and all the pent up emotion floods out... leaving only relief and satisfaction... and making way for a smile... the largest of his whole career.}
