<A>__{over at the fence, the ltd comes to a looooong, skidding stop at the fairgrounds. at the trunk, jay and kay flip open the trunk and scarf up whatever weapons look most dangerous. kay grabs a black box, unsnaps a row of latches, and opens it, revealing the most wicked looking shotgun on the planet. three feet long, triple barreled, over and under and under, plus a pump action reloader on top of a storage clip for a dozen more shells. the shells themselves are solid, glistening like polished steel. kay loads up the clip.}

<D>__{you know how to work that?}
<A>__{kay pumps it once, with extreme confidence.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{no idea whatsoever.}
<A>__{he slams the trunk, revealing the flying saucers sitting atop their columns in the distance.}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{let's bag us some bug.}
<A>__{as if on cue, one of the saucers begins to hum. then it starts to spin, faster and faster. the ship begins to rise.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{oh, shit.}
