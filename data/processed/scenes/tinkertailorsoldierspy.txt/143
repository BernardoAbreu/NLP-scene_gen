<L>__{exterior circus morning}
<A>__{a lorry roars past, wiping frame and revealing guillam arriving at the circus, carrying his briefcase. he springs up the four steps.}
<L>__{interior circus ground floor lobby day}
<A>__{guillam is at the security gate at the dingy lobby. the security guard, bryant, steps from his box. beyond him is the row of lifts.}
<C>__{bryant}
<D>__{mister guillam? how's the family?}
<C>__{peter guillam}
<D>__{fine, bryant. up to registry today.}
<C>__{bryant}
<D>__{okay sir. yellow one for the bag sir.}
<A>__{bryant stamps a pink chit and hands it to guillam, pulling open the lift cage. he gives him a yellow slip for the bag. guillam climbs inside and begins to ascend, rattlingly slowly. as bryant's head disappears...}
<C>__{peter guillam}
<D>__{time you oiled this thing, isn't it?}
<C>__{bryant }
<D>__{we keep asking...}
<A>__{guillam examines the chit. he wipes his hands. for the first time we realize how nervous he is. polished shoes appear as they reach the floor, then the uniform trousers of a short man. a self important janitor. guillam steps out and the janitor checks guillam's pink and yellow chit and motions him through a turnstile. then he stops him short. he gestures for guillam to raise his arms.}
<C>__{peter guillam}
<D>__{you're kidding?}
<C>__{janitor pete}
<D>__{new rules.}
<A>__{guillam is briskly frisked.}
<C>__{peter guillam}
<D>__{mind the jewels.}
<C>__{janitor pete}
<D>__{pen and watch sir.}
<A>__{he holds up a box and guillam hands him his fountain pen and watch. the search over guillam sets off down the corridor, unnerved by the task ahead betraying his own kind.}
<C>__{bill haydon }
<D>__{what the hell are you doing up here?}
<A>__{guillam freezes. then he turns. it's bill haydon standing in a doorway, frowning at him over his spectacles. a moment.}
<C>__{peter guillam}
<D>__{you don't look pleased to see me, bill?}
<C>__{bill haydon}
<D>__{why would i be? you bloody pariah.}
<A>__{then bill grins, the grin transforming his face. guillam smiles back, relief mixing with real warmth.}
<C>__{bill haydon }
<D>__{we like the scalp hunters to know their place. on the second floor.}
<C>__{peter guillam}
<D>__{doing some research. makes a change from sitting on my arse.}
<C>__{bill haydon}
<D>__{heard it was quiet down there.}
<C>__{peter guillam}
<D>__{as the grave. when're you going to give us something to do?}
<C>__{bill haydon}
<D>__{haven't you heard? technology's the future. no need for you apes anymore. i can get you a posting to northern ireland if that helps get the blood racing.}
<C>__{peter guillam}
<D>__{thanks anyway. stick to sitting on my arse.}
<A>__{they've reached the end of the corridor. haydon peels away, a hand raised in farewell.}
