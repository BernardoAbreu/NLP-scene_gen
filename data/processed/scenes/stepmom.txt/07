<A>__{black and white fills the frame. like a checkerboard. we pull back and realize we are seeing a group of penguins waddling against a black and white backdrop. we see a white waitre'd in a black tuxedo holding glasses on a tray. a black model, iman, in a white dress glides through it all. in the center the only dash of color is rachel who has just entered and starts expertly directing the action. she calls out to her assistant, cooper. perpetually hip. perpetually young.}

<D>__{cooper, back the fill off i don't have enough shadow...}
<C>__{cooper}
<D>__{you've got a fruit loop in your hair.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you say that like i don't know that.}

<D>__{i once threw an entire bowl of jello on my stepmother's head }
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{and when did that pass?}
<C>__{cooper}
<D>__{actually, never. they'll always hate you. there's a gene for it.}
<A>__{duncan samuels rachel's boss, an elegant, edgy, englishman interrupts them.}
<C>__{duncan}
<D>__{congratulations. only forty minutes late. you're handling this promotion really well rachel.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{duncan. my work is everything to me. this'll never happen again. now stand back this session's gonna make you remember why you hired me even though i wouldn't sleep with you cooper let's get these penguins dancing }
<A>__{duncan backs off, charmed by her ballsiness. the music blares just then, and a penguin juts forward and nips the model. the flash of the camera. we freeze for a second, seeing the photo rachel just took. an avedonesque portrait of a model being goosed by a penguin colliding with a maitre'd who spills his tray and the penguins seem to be pointing and laughing uproariously. it's an inspired photo.}
