<A>__{she opens her eyes, lies still for a moment, coughs. she gets out of bed and walks across the still dark apartment to the bathroom. she shuts the bathroom door.}
<B>__{bathroom}
<A>__{abby looks at herself in the mirror above the sink, then turns on the tap water. from a neighboring apartment we hear a dull rhythmic thumping on the wall. she pauses, listens for a moment, then starts to splash water on her face. from somewhere offscreen we hear the sharp sound of glass shattering. it reverberates for a moment, then dies. abby looks up at the bathroom door. we hear a scraping at the lock of her apartment door. abby listens. suddenly we hear the lock springing open, and the front door swinging on its hinges.}
<B>__{close shot abby}
<A>__{startled. she shuts off the water and stands motionless. droplets of water are streaming down her face. we hear the sound of footsteps in the next room, crunching across broken glass.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{ray...?}
<A>__{there is no answer. after a moment we hear bedsprings creak in the next room. abby opens the bathroom door and walks out.}
<B>__{main room}
<A>__{a shaft of light slices across the floor from the open bathroom door. broken glass glints on the floor. in the semi darkness we can see that someone is sitting on the bed. the person looks up. it is marty. abby recoils.}

<D>__{lover boy oughta lock his door.}
<A>__{abby looks nervously at marty. droplets of water are still running down her face. she brushes one from her eye.}

<B>__{abby}
<A>__{bolts upright in bead with a muffled groan. sweat pours down her face. she brushes a drop of sweat from her eye and looks around. abby's pov moonlight glints through the windows across the hardwood floor. through the windows we can see the facade of the opposite building. the apartment is dark and still, just as we left it before she fell asleep.}
<B>__{back to abby}
<A>__{she slumps back onto the bed. one hand gropes down out of frame and comes up holding an illuminated alarm clock. she looks at it, drops it back to the floor. she turns on her side and stares across the room toward the window. abby's pov the window.}
