<A>__{a brief, violent flash from the jeriko tape: spreg shoots jeriko.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{how did you hook up with faith?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{this dink hires me a month ago to eyeball her, right? but faith knows me from you, right, so she comes up to me and says, 'hey max why you following me?' i say, 'i will buy you a drink and explain.' and she says...}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{'so, do you enjoy watching me?'}
<A>__{max turns and sees her in the doorway.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you were supposed to go downstairs, baby.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{i know. i don't always do exactly what i'm told.}
<P>__{(she walks slowly toward them)}
<D>__{so i said, 'do you enjoy watching me?' and you said come on max.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i said, 'yeah. i'd even do it for free.'}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{uh huh. and i said, 'that's good, because i like the feeling of someone watching me. i acquired the taste from lenny.'}
<A>__{lenny looks between faith and max, feeling like the asshole of the western world. faith moves up close to max. she puts her hands lightly on his shoulders, caressing them. max grins, realizing she is 100% with him.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(to lenny)}
<D>__{and then she said, 'since we're going to be spending so much time together '}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{'we might as well make the best of it.'}
<C>__{lenny}
<P>__{(crushed)}
<D>__{jesus, faith.}
<A>__{faith runs her hands appreciatively over max's shoulders and arms. then, in an eyeblink, she grabs his forearm in both hands and deflects the gun.}
<C>__{faith}
<D>__{lenny!!}
<A>__{lenny jumps in, wrestling max for the gun. faith pulls the glock out of max's waistband and throws it across the room.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{fucking bitch!!}
<A>__{blam! blam! max fires wildly, trying to hit lenny, who is just barely keeping the muzzle out of his face. faith grabs max's hair, trying to pull him away... his "hair" comes off in her hands. a prosthetic wig, containing the squid net array. max's head is shaved to a sinead o'connor stubble. he looks demonic, grimacing with effort as he struggles with lenny. he continues firing. the shots hit the mirrors. angles of the reflected images of them shattering. faith, screaming, reflected, her face fragmenting into shards. the crystal chandelier shatters, reigning glassy snow on them from above. max is stronger and heavier than lenny, but lenny has one advantage: max has managed to make him really angry. lenny gives a guttural cry and drives max backward into the doorframe. they tumble together into the living room, falling together over the couch. lenny pounds max's hand against the glass coffee table, shattering it. he forces max's hand along a glass edge, cutting it, and max drops the gun. lenny reaches for it, but max kicks it away a split second before his hand touches it. it skitters under the couch, out of play. max punches lenny brutally in the face, then in the gut, and grabs him with both hands. he hurls him against the wall. lenny staggers off the wall into several vicious punches from max. we feel the tide turning. lenny goes down to one knee. max pulls out his knife and flicks it open. lenny throws a lamp. max ducks and charges through. lenny spins away from the downthrust. the knife embeds itself in his shoulder blade, sunk into the bone. lenny punches max in the throat and jerks away, pulling the knife handle out of max's hand. max tackles him and they crash together through a sliding glass door onto the balcony. explosion of flying glass. max pulls a dazed lenny to his feet and rushes him backward toward the railing. at the last instant, lenny twists with all his strength and spins max into the railing, using his weight against him. he pushes hard and max topples. as he is going over, max grabs lenny's tie, pulling him over. max is dangling 12 stories above the oblivious crowd, his entire weight hanging from lenny's tie. lenny has one arm and one foot hooked around the railing, and he is being strangled by the tie. lenny is starting to black out. in agony he gropes with his free hand to his own shoulder blade, finding the handle of the knife. he jerks it out of himself. max sees it coming a split second before it happens. lenny slashes the knife across the tie, just above max's hands. max takes the express elevator to hell. he hits 12 stories down, on top of a video truck. lenny stands there panting, bleeding down the back of his jacket. faith runs to the railing and looks down. all the strength goes out of her legs. she sags to the floor. fireworks continue to boom across the sky. lenny looks down at her, gazing at the object of his quest. she looks up at him, her wet eyes seemingly at the bottom of a deep well from which he cannot save her. he turns and walks away. it's hard. but he keeps walking.}
