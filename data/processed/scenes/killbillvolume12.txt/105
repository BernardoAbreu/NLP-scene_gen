<T>__{time cut:}
<A>__{the estranged brothers continue their conversation. budd sits in the doorway of his trailer, bottle of jack in his hand. bill stands.}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{you tryin to tell me she cut her way through eighty eight bodyguards 'fore she got to o ren?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{no. there wasn't really eighty eight of them, they just called themselves the crazy 88.}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{why.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i dunno, i guess they thought it sounded cool. anyhow, she had about}
<P>__{26 or 27 around her when (bleep)}
<D>__{attacked. they all fell under her hanzo sword.}
<A>__{the mention of a hattori hanzo sword gets budd's attention.}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{she got 'er a hattori hanzo sword?}
<A>__{bill nods his head, "yes."}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{she has a hanzo jingi sword.}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{he made her one? didn't he swear a blood oath never to make another sword?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{it would appear he's broken it.}
<A>__{budd doesn't say anything at first...then;}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{them japs know how to carry a grudge don't they? or is it just you tend to bring that out in people?}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i know this is a ridiculous question before i ask, but you by any chance haven't kept up with your swordplay?}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{hell, i pawned that years ago.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you pawned a hattori hanzo sword?}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{yep.}
<A>__{the disrespect is pain.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{it was priceless.}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{not in el paso it ain't. in el pso i got me 250 dollars for it.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{since it was a gift from me, why didn't you offer me the chance to buy it back?}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{because that would've required me to acknowledge your existence. drunken bum though i may be, i don't need booze that bad. but who the hell gives a crap anyway. that bitch ain't gittin no bushido points for killin a white trash piece of shit like me with a samurai sword. i'm a bouncer in a titty bar, bill. if she wants to fight me, all she gotta do is come down to the club, start some shit, and we'll be in a a fight.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{ budd, you need to listen to me. i know we haven't spoken for quite some time, and the last time we spoke wasn't the most pleasant. but you need to get over being mad at me, and start becoming afraid of bea. because she is coming, and she's coming to kill you. and unless you accept my assistance, i have no doubt she will succeed.}
<A>__{budd sees bill's true concern for his welfare. bill tries to charm his brother.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{can't we forget the past, and look at the happy side of all this?}
<A>__{budd chuckles.}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{and what would that happy side be?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{she's brought "the boys" back together.}
<A>__{budd is touched by bill's concern and chuckles to himself.}
<C>__{budd}
<D>__{i appreciate the concern on your face, but there's a difference 'tween "the boys", time can't erase. i don't dodge guilt. and i don't jew outta payin my comeuppance. that woman deserves her revenge. and we deserve to die. but then again, so does she. so i guess we'll just see now, won't we.}
