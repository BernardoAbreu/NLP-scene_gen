<L>__{130 military car. inside. night.}
<A>__{inside a military automobile. in the back seat, mathieu is sitting next to kader who is handcuffed. zohra is in the front seat, between the driver and a para who has in his hand a large regulation pistol. the interior is lighted by the headlights of a jeep which is following directly behind the auto a few yards. silence. mathieu looks hastily at kader, who is staring straight in front of him, and appears to be sullen and downcast. then mathieu speaks in a pleasant tone, as if in friendly conversation.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{if you had let me blow you up, you would have disappointed me ...}
<A>__{kader turns to him, and replies, trying to maintain his own voice at the same level of indifference:}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{for many months, i've had your photo on my desk together with a dozen or so reports on you ... and naturally, i am under the illusion that i know you somewhat. you never seemed the type, kader, inclined to performing useless actions.}
<A>__{kader doesn't answer right away, then speaks slowly as if expressing the results of his doubts, a new point of view ...}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{you seem to be very satisfied to have taken me alive ...}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{of course i am.}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{that proves that i was wrong. evidently i credited you with an advantage greater than i should have.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{no. let's just say that you've given me the satisfaction to have guessed correctly. but from the technical point of view, it isn't possible to speak of advantages. by now the game is over. the nlf has been defeated.}
<A>__{zohra has turned around suddenly. she is crying and speaks hastily in arabic, violently, harshly. mathieu doesn't understand, and turns to kader to ask him politely, although with a bit of irony:}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{what is she saying?}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{she says that ali is still in the casbah.}
