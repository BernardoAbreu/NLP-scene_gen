<L>__{int skee ball arcade day}
<A>__{holden feeds a couple dollars into the change machine. alyssa looks on.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{explain this again.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{how could you have grown up down the shore and never played skee ball? what did you do with your youth?}
<A>__{they head toward the skee ball runs.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{stayed out late, smoked pot, screwed around.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{not your grade school years; your high school years.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<P>__{(off skee ball run)}
<D>__{this looks complicated.}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(inserts coin and pulls lever)}
<D>__{the premise is very basic you roll the ball up the ramp at varying speeds, in an effort to pop it into the score circles. the higher the score, the more prize tickets you get.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{what do you do with the prize tickets?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{trade them in for prizes that aren't worth nearly as much as you paid to play the game.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{then what's the point?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{it's fun.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{and you question my lifestyle.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{observe.}
<A>__{holden rolls the ball. it pops into a twenty point circle.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{see? it's just that simple.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{why not just walk up there and put it in the fifty every time?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{where's the skill in that?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{oh, this is a skill? i'm sorry, i had no idea.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{just toss one.}
<A>__{alyssa picks up a ball, squints to aim, and whips it overhand. it pops off one of the circles and shoots back at them, missing them as they duck. an oc knock and an "ow!" is heard. holden reacts as alyssa laughs.}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(to oc guy)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, man. she's new at this.}
<A>__{holden ducks as the ball comes sailing back at his head. he gets up.}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(to oc)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<P>__{(hands alyssa another ball)}
<D>__{underhand. throw it underhand.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{this is where you take straight chicks on dates?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{it's like spanish fly. this'll probably be the first time i don't score afterwards.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i don't know. i'm starting to get a tingle in my bottom.}
<P>__{(tosses a ball)}
<D>__{ten.}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(grabs a ball)}
<D>__{so what'd you do last night?}
<P>__{(prepares to throw)}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{got laid}
<A>__{holden whips the ball in surprise. it ricochets off the ceiling and through the glass of an old pinball machine. alyssa laughs. holden looks around, nervously.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{some more of that skill you were telling me about?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{maybe we should just leave before somebody gets hurt.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{no way. i want a cheap prize.}
<P>__{(throws a ball)}
<D>__{so your friend's quite the homophobe.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{he just feels left out, i think.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i'm not talking about his infantile hang up with me. i'm talking about when you two were playing that game. everytime he swore when his players messed up, he called them cocksuckers, he referred to the players as queers, he called you a cock teaser...}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i thought he was talking to you.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i know you think it means nothing, and it may in fact be unintentional, but it's ugly all the same.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{he was just pissed he was losing.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{so he slams the gay community?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{c'mon. don't get all p.c. on me.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i'm not. but what is that saying?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{it says he gets too easily frustrated.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{it's passive agressive gay bashing.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{how do you figure?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{how casually did it roll off his tongue? and that's how he expresses his anger? by calling people faggots?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i think you're reading too much into it.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i think you're just so used to it that it rolls off your back. i've heard the two of you play your little rank out game where one insists the other is gay.}
<P>__{(as the boys)}
<D>__{"you're a faggot. no, you're a faggot." it's cute and all to watch you go at it like grade schooler, but it's also offensive labeling and ducking the label of being gay as if it were the scarlet fucking letter.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{you're blowing this way out of proportion. we live in a more tolerant age now. you refer to yourself as a dyke. hooper calls himself a faggot all the time...}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{yeah, but that's what's known as empowerment disempowerment. i call myself a dyke so it's not too devastating when some throwback screams it at me as i'm leaving a bar at night. same for hooper by calling himself a faggot, he steals the thunder away from the mouthy jerks of this world who'd like to beat him to it. but the difference between us having it and your friend saying it is miles wide. we say it to mask the pain you say it for lack of a better expression at any given moment. no holden, we do not live in a more tolerant age. and if you think that's the case, then you've been in the suburbs way too long to be resuscitated.}
<A>__{holden kind of sulks. alyssa notices.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{but you know what?}
<P>__{(picks up his face)}
<D>__{i have more faith in you than that.}
<P>__{(rips her tickets off)}
<D>__{come on i want my cheap prize.}
