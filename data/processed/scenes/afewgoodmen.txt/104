<A>__{a few m.p.is are standing by the entrance. kaffee comes around the corner and heads toward the courtroom. we're immediately stricken by something: in his dress blue uniform he could easily be mistaken for a real live naval officer. he opens the courtroom doors and walks into}
<L>__{interior the courtroom day}
<A>__{a few more m.p.'s are standing around. the jurors, nine enlisted navy and marine men and women, are in their place, ross is at his table looking through some papers, and dawson and downey, in handcuffs, are seated at the defense table. the trial in a few moments from being underway and a few people are milling about. kaffee walks down the aisle but is stopped by a voice behind him.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{lieutenant kaffee?}
<A>__{kaffee turns around to see a man and woman who are clearly dawson's parents.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{you're gonna save our son, aren't you?}
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i will do my best.}
<A>__{kaffee continues on and stops next to jo, who's talking with a woman in her mid 30's.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{danny, i want you to meet ginny miller, louden's aunt.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{you're aunt ginny?}
<C>__{ginny}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i was expecting someone older.}
<C>__{ginny}
<D>__{so was i.}
<A>__{not quite the words of inspiration kaffee was hoping to hear before he does the hardest thing he's ever had to do. he walks over to ross.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{last chance. i will flip you for it.}
<A>__{randolph enters.}
<C>__{sergeant at arms}
<D>__{all rise.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{too late.}
<A>__{kaffee walks back to his table as}
<C>__{sergeant at arms}
<D>__{all those having business with this general court martial, stand forward and you shall be heard. captain julius alexander randolph is presiding. god save the united states of america.}
<A>__{randolph raps the gavel. randolph without objection, the sworn confessions of the two defendants have been read to the jury and entered into the court record.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{no objection, your honor.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{no objection.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{is the government prepared to make an opening statement?}
<C>__{ross}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<A>__{ross walks to the jury box.}
<C>__{ross}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{the facts of the case are this: at midnight on august 6th, the defendants went into the barracks room of their platoon mate, pfc william santiago. they woke him up, tied his arms and legs with rope, and forced a rag into his throat. a few minutes later, a chemical reaction in santiago's body called lactic acidosis caused his lungs to begin bleeding. he drowned in his own blood and was pronounced dead at 32 minutes past midnight. these are the facts of the case. and they are undisputed. that's right. the story i just told you is the exact same story you're going to hear from corporal dawson, and it's the exact same story you're going to hear from private downey. furthermore, the government will also demonstrate that the defendants soaked the rag with poison, and entered santiago's room with motive and intent to kill.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now, lt. kaffee, is gonna try to pull off a little magic act, he's gonna try a little misdirection. he's going to astonish you with stories of rituals and dazzle you with official sounding terms like code red. he might even cut into a few officers for you. he'll have no evidence, mind you, none. but it's gonna be entertaining. when we get to the end, all the magic in the world will not have been able to divert your attention from the fact that willy santiago is dead, and dawson and downey killed him. these are the facts of the case.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and they are undisputed.}
<A>__{ross walks back to his seat.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{lt. kaffee?}
<A>__{before kaffee's even stood up, these words are coming out of his mouth.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{there was no poison on the rag and there was no intent to kill and any attempt to prove otherwise is futile because it just ain't true.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{when dawson and downey went into santiago's room that night, it wasn't because of vengeance or hatred, it wasn't to kill or harm, and it wasn't because they were looking for kicks on a friday night. it's because it was what they were ordered to do.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{let me say that again: it's because it was what they were ordered to do. now, out in the real world, that means nothing. and here at the washington navy yard, it doesn't mean a whole lot more. but if you're a marine assigned to rifle security company windward, guantanamo bay, cuba, and you're given an order, you follow it or you pack your bags.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{make no mistake about it, harold dawson and louden downey are sitting before you in judgement today because they did their job.}
<A>__{kaffee walks back to the table and takes his seat.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{is the government ready to call its first witness?}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{please the court, the government calls mr. r.c mcguire.}
<A>__{while mccguire, a civilian in his late 30's, is being sworn in, kaffee has sat back down. he leans over to dawson and whispers.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{how you doin'?}
<A>__{dawson doesn't change his expression.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{good.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{mr. mcguire, would you state your full name and occupation for the record, please?}
<C>__{mcguire}
<D>__{robert c. mcguire, special agent, naval investigative service.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{mr. mcguire, did your office receive a letter from pfc william santiago on 3 august of this year?}
<C>__{mcguire}
<D>__{we did.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{what did the letter say?}
<C>__{mcguire}
<D>__{that a member of private santiago's unit had illegally fired his weapon over the fenceline.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{was that marine identified in the letter?}
<C>__{mcguire}
<D>__{no sir. i notified the barracks c.o., colonel jessep, that i would be coming down to investigate.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{and what did you find?}
<C>__{mcguire}
<D>__{for the shift reported, only one sentry returned his weapon to the switch with a round of ammunition missing.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{and who was that?}
<C>__{mcguire}
<D>__{lance corporal harold dawson.}
<C>__{ross}
<P>__{(continuing; to kaffee)}
<D>__{your witness.}
<A>__{ross goes back to his table. kaffee stands.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{mr. mcguire, have you questioned corporal dawson about the fenceline shooting?}
<C>__{mcguire}
<D>__{yes. he claims to have been engaged in some manner by the enemy.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{but you don't believe him.}
<C>__{mcguire}
<D>__{it's not my place }
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{corporal dawson's been charged with a number of crimes, why wasn't he charged with firing at the enemy without cause?}
<C>__{mcguire}
<D>__{there wasn't enough evidence to support such a charge.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{kaffee sits.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{mr. mcguire, i don't understand what you mean when you say there wasn't enough evidence to support such a charge. you had willy santiago's letter.}
<C>__{mcguire}
<D>__{santiago was the only witness, but i never had a chance to interview him. so i don't know what he saw.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{and now we won't ever know, will we, mr. mcguire?}
<C>__{mcguire}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{no more questions.}
