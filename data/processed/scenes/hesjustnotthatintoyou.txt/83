<A>__{gigi is in the kitchen, mixing up some dip. she chats with a couple of party goers, very much at home.}

<A>__{an attractive tall girl enters the kitchen, and starts looking in the cupboards. gigi watches with interest.}
<C>__{gigi }
<D>__{can i help you find something?}
<A>__{the tall girl finds a bowl in the cabinet, and grabs it.}
<C>__{tall girl}
<D>__{no, that's ok. i got it.}
<A>__{she brings the bowl over to the counter, and starts emptying gigi's dip into the bowl. gigi is thrown.}
<C>__{tall girl }
<D>__{thanks for mixing that up.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tall girl}
<D>__{alex asked me to get the dip together. thanks for getting it started.}
<A>__{gigi's face grows red. the tall girl tastes the dip.}
<C>__{tall girl }
<D>__{hmmm could use a little more dill.}
<A>__{then the tall girl deftly grabs the dip, and chips, and heads back out to the party. gigi looks to the confused party goers, not pleased.}
