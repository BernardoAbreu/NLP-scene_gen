<B>__{on chuck}
<A>__{we move up out of the reflection to the real man. his legs are scarred. the remnants of a dress wrap around his middle. a stone knife on a neatly mounted haft is stuck in a belt made of videotape and woven fiber. necklaces of shark's teeth and shells hang from his neck. his hair is long. a coconut frond hat is on his head. the hand wrapped around the spear is scarred and brown as a berry. it holds the spear perfectly still. the watch is gone. we come around slowly until we see chuck's face. the eyes say it all. they stare out with a survivor's intensity, staring at the water, unblinking. this is the man who used to splash futilely about in the water trying to fish. this is the fedex man who was plugged into the tumult of activity and energy, surrounded by technology and human activity at its most intense, devoted to making seconds count. now he is utterly alone, and utterly still. and now he has all the time in the world. suddenly, without an once of wasted motion, he shoots the spear forward at a low angle. it quivers, stuck on the bottom. he pulls it out with a practiced twist. on the end is a struggling fish. but this isn't a thrill anymore. it's another day at the office.}
