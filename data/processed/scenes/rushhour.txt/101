<L>__{interior north korean consulate ambassador han's office day}
<A>__{carson turns off the beach boys song on the tv behind him. holding javal's faxes, he's facing ambassador han, colonel lee and the hostage negotiator (whom we don't yet see.)}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{...our worst enemy'll be the city. there are events gearing up all around town, and a dozen world leaders arriving. add the friday rush hour and usual l.a. bad behavior and it'll be a nightmare out there by 3 pm. it all works to the advantage of the kidnapper, hinders our pursuit efforts...}
<P>__{(frowns)}
<D>__{you don't agree?}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{the negotiator stands and takes the faxes from carson. it's miranda, his wife. her fbi shield holder is folded over the breast pocket of her jacket.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i'm wondering whether to believe him when he says he's strictly motivated by money.}
<C>__{carson}
<P>__{(grabs faxes back)}
<D>__{you see one word of peoples' liberation, holy jihad, revolutionary whatever it is we're pissed off about this week bullshit in this entire letter?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{i still want to check the mo against known politicals, terrorists }
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{ already doing it. we're coordinating with the secret service, the nsa and the cia.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{have someone talk to the lapd, give them a cover story for the media about the crash on la cienega.}
<A>__{walther comes in and looks at carson.}
<C>__{walther}
<D>__{why didn't you tell me doctor knoll is your wife?!}
<A>__{this surprises ambassador han and colonel lee.}
<C>__{carson}
<P>__{(while looking at miranda)}
<D>__{if she'd changed her name when we got married, i wouldn't have to.}
<C>__{miranda}
<P>__{(to carson)}
<D>__{i'm so enjoying this opportunity to finally work together...}
<C>__{walther}
<D>__{jesus, forget i asked.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the cash will be here in an hour.}
<P>__{(to miranda)}
<D>__{any thoughts on the kidnapper's thoughts?}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{everything indicates he's working alone. and his concerns do seem to be solely about the money... so i agree that he's only using the summit and the tension with north korea to create extreme motivation to pay the ransom.}
<C>__{colonel lee}
<D>__{i will bring the money to him.}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{my ass.}
<C>__{colonel lee}
<D>__{the hostages are citizens of the people's republic of korea }
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{ hey, do i go to the torture chambers in your prisons, tell you how to do your job?}
<C>__{walther}
<D>__{all right, you're outta here! is this the same insubordinate crap you pulled at beverly thrift?}
<A>__{carson glares coldly at walther.}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{i will coordinate the drop.}
<C>__{ambassador han}
<D>__{perhaps that is better. inspector carson knows the terrain }
<C>__{colonel lee}
<D>__{ then he can come with me.}
<A>__{walther looks at miranda. she nods her assent.}
<C>__{walther}
<P>__{(firm; to carson)}
<D>__{it's settled.}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{it sucks.}
<C>__{miranda}
<D>__{but it means we can get on with it.}
<A>__{the americans leave the room.}
