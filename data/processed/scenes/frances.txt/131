<A>__{derelicts sleep on broken couches and armchairs. in a corner by a pay phone ernest farmer sits at a rickety desk piled high with briefs. frances sits across from him. they've been talking.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{...so what do you think?}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{i don't know, honey. your mother has such big plans for you.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{i know that, dad, but }
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{what you have to understand, francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... the only time i ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... i don't know.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{but dad, i'm asking about me. what do you think i should do?}
<C>__{ernest}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{well, francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. this is the way of things, but i guess you already know that.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{dad... whatever i decide, will it be okay with you?}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{always. always.}
<A>__{frances rises from her chair, looking around the room to hide her tears. ernest rises too.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i... i don't have a desk in my room, and...}
<P>__{(it's not a proper office)}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{i don't care, dad. i love you.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{i love you too, francie.}
<A>__{they look at each other across the desk for an uncomfortable moment, then frances slowly leaves. he looks sadly after her.}
