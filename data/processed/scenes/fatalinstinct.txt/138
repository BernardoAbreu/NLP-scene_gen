<L>__{interior frank's garage day}
<A>__{frank lays on a mechanic's "creeper", working under a car. lana steps between his feet. he hears her and rolls out, his crotch sliding to a stop against her legs. he looks up, covered with black grease.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{so... you did it. ya beat the rap.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{no thanks to you.}
<A>__{he gets to his feet, cocky.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{hey... i knew he'd spring ya.}
<A>__{she walks toward him, her voice cold, accusing. he backs up.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{you didn't lift a finger, frank. you let me take all the heat.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{heeeee eeey... what could i do?}
<A>__{lana pulls the gun from her purse, pointing it at him.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{you were gonna let me rot in the slammer... never say a thing.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{look... you're out... free. now we're together. that's what counts. we can try again! forget triple indemnity. we'll whack him and split three mil.}
<C>__{lana}

<P>__{(cocks the gun)}
<D>__{and you know too much.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(arrogant)}
<D>__{come on, lana. you're not gonna shoot me.}
<A>__{he brashly turns his back to her, putting some tools away. she sees a huge electric powered screwdriver on the workbench next to her, smiling diabolically. she lowers the gun.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{you're right.}
<P>__{(then, seductive)}
<D>__{maybe i will just screw you to death.}
<A>__{he laughs arrogantly... starts to unbutton his shirt.}
