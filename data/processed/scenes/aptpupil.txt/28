<L>__{exterior residential street sidewalk night}
<A>__{todd and dussander walk together in silence. todd is clearly in a bad mood. dussander prods him.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{you shouldn't be so hard on your father.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{why don't you mind your own business.}
<C>__{dussander}
<P>__{(amused at todd's short fuse)}
<D>__{boy, it's not so easy to raise children. your father does the best he can, i'm sure. having his own father there is bound to cause some anxiety on his part }
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{oh, give me a frigging break, will you? look who's talking to me, for christ's sake. and what was that crap about the dog? if you were any more charming i was going to puke.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{heavens, boy, wasn't that precisely the point? i used the evening to our advantage .}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{our advantage? our advantage?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{certainly now they will offer no objections if you continue to come over and read to me.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{you sure take a lot for granted. do you think there's anybody forcing me to come over to your scuzzy house and watch you slop up booze all day? do you?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{lower your voice. people will hear.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{so what?}
<A>__{dussander stops.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{no, nobody forces you to come. in fact, you are welcome to stay away. believe me, boy, i have no scruples about drinking alone. none at all.}
<A>__{they start walking again. dussander turns up his driveway. todd follows.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{you know, if they found out what you are, they'd spit on you.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{i am sure they would have nothing but revulsion for me. but what would they say about you, boy, when i told them you had known about me for nine months... and said nothing?}
<A>__{dussander unlocks his door and steps in.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{come and see me if you please, and stay home if you don't. good night, boy.}
<A>__{he closes the door.}
