<L>__{exterior trevor estate day}
<A>__{establishing shot of trevor gottitall estate, a huge palatial spread. the grounds are immaculate and huge, exquisitely kept and beautifully laid out. a gathering is around the pool and lawn area, where trevor and his team are having an exhibition for their guests. polite applause is coming from the crowd, all well dressed and obviously well heeled.}
<B>__{angle on trevor}
<A>__{as he knocks out an opponent.}
<B>__{angle on crowd}
<A>__{applauding.}
<B>__{angle on trevor}
<A>__{taunting a different opponent. trevor executes a beautiful technique and puts the guy down and out.}
<B>__{angle on team}
<A>__{(psychologist, therapist, masseur, etc.) who are cheering trevor on.}
<B>__{angle on trevor}
<A>__{as he plays with the next fighter.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{they said you were good... ha!}
<A>__{he knocks the guy out with a picture perfect kick. there is no denying that he's a superior fighter.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{can't you get me any quality sparring partners?}
<A>__{the next guy comes up, but before they can start, the psychologist, dr. pfeelgut, calls for "time" and motions trevor over.}
<C>__{pfeelgut}
<D>__{it's not enough just to win, trevor. you have to destroy your opponent completely, mentally and physically. beat him once, he's a threat. humiliate him, and he'll fear you forever.}
<A>__{trevor listens to this, nods his head once, and when pfeelgut goes to leave, trevor pushes him into the pool. pfeelgut comes to the surface, smiling.}
<C>__{pfeelgut }
<D>__{exactly!}
<A>__{trevor goes back to the ring. he really takes it to this guy, alternately playing with him and hurting him. as the guy tries to hold his own, the string to his pants comes loose and they start to fall down. he grabs for them with both hands, and trevor starts to back up, laughing with the rest of the group.}
<B>__{angle on pfeelgut}
<A>__{toweling off, who is yelling to trevor.}
<C>__{pfeelgut }
<D>__{get him! now!!}
<A>__{trevor looks at him for a moment, not really understanding, then sees what the psychologist is saying. he lunges immediately forward and (in slow motion) knocks the guy out while he is still trying to pull his pants up.}
<B>__{angle on crowd as they enjoy the show immensely}
<A>__{trevor has learned the lesson of the day, and he walks off.}
