<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{sandro's car is speeding across a harsh, sun baked landscape, bypassing long lines of peasants returning from the fields: the women seated on donkeys, the men on foot. the more fortunate among them have horse drawn carts. claudia is looking at the surrounding countryside and spies an iron bridge that is all rusty and obviously no longer in use.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{look at that bridge! who knows why they even bothered to make it...}
<A>__{the car continues onward, passing an abandoned factory, then a railroad station, also abandoned, its tracks covered by weeds, the ticket office haphazardly boarded up with old wooden planks.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{look at that: a factory... a station... and look at those tracks, all full of weeds... but why?}
<A>__{sandro shrugs his shoulders and continues driving without saying a word. up ahead a small town comes into view, with monotonous rows of newly constructed homes lined up along the side of the road. the car enters the town and stops. sandro gets out and goes over to a fountain nearby, but the fountain is dry. somewhat surprised, he begins to look around. and only then do sandro and claudia become aware that the silence around them is an unnatural one, that the doors and the windows of all the houses in the town are tightly shut. there is no sign of life anywhere, except for the weeds growing between the cracks in the walls, invading and suffocating everything in sight. claudia gets out of the car, joins sandro, and together they start walking along the streets. the sun beats furiously down upon the crumbling houses, upon the church, upon the useless monument in the square on which a dedication is inscribed: "to the agricultural worker." sandro looks around in absolute silence. claudia is also silent, somewhat dismayed. instinctively, she presses up close to sandro who leads her to a shady spot where the ground is overgrown with weeds. sandro and claudia are lying next to each other on the grass. sandro appears calm but is actually looking at claudia as though he were about to embrace her with his eyes. then he takes her hand. claudia offers no resistance; in fact, she entwines her fingers around his, almost with a sense of desperation. sandro tries to kiss her. she makes a feeble attempt to resist, looks around, and sees the deserted town, the barren fields, the crumbling, sun baked walls. she turns and looks at sandro again, and now it is she who kisses him. when they break apart, they stretch themselves out upon the grass. sandro kisses her violently, again and again and again...}
