<A>__{tears roll down needy's cheeks. she begins moaning, then screaming at that top of her lungs. she hallucinates liquid seeping through the walls, blood and lymph oozing in at the corners and windows. then the infamous spiny black bile... pixelated nightmares emerge from the darkness. skulls, jesters, demons, death. it's the worst acid trip imaginable. needy rubs her eyes frantically and continues to scream. chip immediately rolls off needy, concerned. he grabs her and tries to shake some sense into her.}
