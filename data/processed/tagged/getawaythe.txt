<A>__{moments. carol starts to speak but doesn't. he is preoccupied, lost in his own thoughts. finally he stands, looking down at her. he slowly takes off his coat, folds it, lays it on the grass, then turns and starts walking towards a tree. suddenly he takes off his shoes, breaks into a run and dives for the rope. carol is already on her feet, her sweater off, shoes kicked aside, she runs after him and hits the water with an awkward splash. she is a brief second behind him. they come up together, and he laughs with the pure joy of being free and alive. she joins him, in his laughter and with their arms around each other, they turn as they are swept down stream.}

<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(he is very tight)}
<D>__{oh christ...}
<A>__{he again moves close... doc reaches around to unsnap her bra as carol places both of her arms around him, holding him tightly... doc unsnaps the top fastener, the second one catches, remains unyielding... he closes his eyes for a second... the pressure of the moment is again too intense for doc. once more he pulls gently away from her. carol looks at him, her eyes very reassuring.}
