<A>__{quiet, mostly dark. a few fluorescent lights and a desk lamp... dekker sits at conners' desk. a somber moment, reflecting on the man, his career. he shuts off the lamp, heads for the door.}
<C>__{dax}
<D>__{detective?}
<A>__{dekker turns to find... dax, cradling a 3,000 page document.}
<C>__{dax}
<D>__{i know what they were doing inside the bank.}
<A>__{dekker and dax dax flips through the huge document.}
<C>__{dax}
<D>__{these are today's transaction records from the bank. an average day produces about 400 pages, give or take. today, there were over 3,000 pages.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{meaning?}
<C>__{dax}
<D>__{we've just witnessed the largest heist in history. somewhere in the neighborhood of a billion dollars.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{come again?}
<C>__{dax}
<D>__{it's a computer virus. "the computer virus." it randomly withdraws money from all the accounts and deposits it into the bad guys' account. if you check the transactions, no two withdrawal amounts are the same and none of'em are over $100. most security systems work on the size of the money, not number of transactions. wire out one million from a handful of accounts and red flags go up. wire out a less than a hundred from ten million accounts, no flags.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{where's the money now?}
<C>__{dax}
<D>__{i tried following one of the transactions. it took me an hour and when i finally had it... it went away.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{how is that possible?}
<C>__{dax}
<D>__{the virus created a host of phantom accounts where the money goes}
<C>__{dax }
<D>__{temporarily, then transfers to another account, then to another. it's never in one place long enough to get an accurate fix.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{it's still moving the money around?}
<C>__{dax}
<D>__{yeah. any deposit or withdrawal from any bank doesn't usually go into affect until the next business day. so it's going to keep jumping around until it clears at 9 am tomorrow.}
<C>__{dekker}
<P>__{(realizes)}
<D>__{or 6 am pacific time. sunrise. so why break in? if they're just wiring money? couldn't they do that from anywhere?}
<C>__{dax}
<D>__{that's the regional manager's computer terminal. there's no outside remote access to it. there you have unlimited entry to the bank's mainframe. no passwords to work around, no "hacking" in. it's all nice and clean.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{a billion dollars is missing and we're only discovering this now?}
<C>__{dax}
<D>__{ironically, when the power went out, it helped hide the virus and bought it time to work.}
<C>__{dekker}
<D>__{so they weren't trying to make it look like they were robbing a bank, to rip off a saudi prince? they were making it look like they ripped off a saudi prince to rob a bank.}
<P>__{(realizes)}
<D>__{the chaos theory.}
