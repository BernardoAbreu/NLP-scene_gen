<A>__{early afternoon. the sun is hot. scorching. indy and his party rest. they nap in a shady section of the path. camera pans the snoozing bodies of everyone, coming to a stop at indiana. the golden hooped rod rests beside indy. a hand comes into frame and grabs the staff. other hands move into frame. they steal indy's whip and revolver. they take all weapons from scraggy and his crew members. indiana is awakened by a sword. at his throat. indy reaches for his gun and whip...gone. he looks up. kezure stands over him, holding the sword in one hand, the golden rod in another. indy turns. the other pirates hold swords and daggers at the throats of clare, betsy, scraggy and the crew members. kezure twirls the golden hooped rod in front of him. he smiles at indiana.}

<D>__{she is a wonderful treasure... eh?...}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{we had a deal.}
<C>__{kezure}
<P>__{(moves sword closer to indy's throat)}
<D>__{i have no deals with dead men.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{son of a bitch.}
<A>__{kezure laughs. he has removed a peach from his pocket. he shines the peach on his cloak, and gives a shrug to indiana.}
<C>__{kezure}
<P>__{(shrugs, laughs)}
<D>__{i am an old pirate, doctor jones. do you suddenly expect me to treat you with kindness and fairness?... it is not my way of life!}
<A>__{indy is disgusted. kezure takes a large bite from the peach. as he chews and swallows, kezure nods to his men, motioning toward indy and the others.}
<C>__{kezure}
<D>__{kill them...}
<P>__{(takes another bite of the peach)}
<D>__{but save their hair. i will make a coat out of it.}
<A>__{the men move to kill scraggy, betsy, clare and the crew members. suddenly, kezure emits a loud scream. he grabs his stomach in pain. he falls to his knees. the half eaten peach rolls from his hand. onto the}
<B>__{ground.}
<A>__{indy and clare rush toward kezure. something very strange is happening to the pirate king... his hair begins to fall out. his teeth rot. his skin shrivels. his body becomes thinner. spindly. kezure has begun to rapidly age. he continues to scream. in horrible pain. the pirates step away. frightened. the others watch in horror. kezure's body contorts. his skin withers... flakes... it begins to peel from his bones. his screams fade... his eyeballs roll out of their sockets. only his skeleton remains. it turns black and crumbles to dust. only his elaborate clothing remains. the many stolen peaches roll out of his cloak, onto the ground. the remaining pirates drop their weapons. they run off down the mountain. scared to death! indiana holds the half eaten peach in his hand. betsy is puzzled.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{i thought the peaches promised immortality...eternal youth?...}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{the garden of immortal peaches promises life only to those who are pure in heart.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{kezure was evil. his heart was filled with greed.}
<A>__{indiana drops the peach to the ground. he grabs his whip, revolver and golden hooped rod. scraggy and his crew members retrieve their weapons. everyone turns, continuing down the mountain path. leaving kezure's clothes and the several peaches behind.}
