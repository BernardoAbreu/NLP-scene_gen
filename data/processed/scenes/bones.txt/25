<L>__{interior the building continuous}
<A>__{the darkness broken only by sunlight streaming through grimy windows reveals the decaying interior of the building. we can see now nothing's been moved since the late '70's. old furniture, carpets, pictures late '70's gothic.}
<C>__{tia}
<D>__{damn it's cold in here!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{it's eighty degrees outside. and it's gotta be barely fifty in here.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{and damp, too. let's not forget damp.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{whattaya think? can you picture it? over there the bar, and in here the dance floor.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{possible...maybe...could be.}
<A>__{patrick leads them to the stairwell going up and down around the old elevator cage shaft.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i got a great deal on it. they couldn't give this place away. just dead meat stanking up their books for twenty years.}
<A>__{they come to the elevator shaft, no elevator in sight.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{the last owner on the lease before the bank was back in '79. some dude named jimmy bones. empty ever since.}
<A>__{maurice looks down the elevator shaft and gets immediately dizzy, almost plunging to his doom pulled back by bill.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{jimmy bones?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{yeah, you heard of him?}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{you haven't?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{not that i remember.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{he was a local legend back in the '70's. there was a song, stagolee kinda deal: "this is the ballad of jimmy bones black as night and hard as stone..."}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i was born near here. my dad's from here. he never mentioned it.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{bones! how baddass is zat? this is the place for us. patrick, you get platinum props, man. platinum.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{yeah, in the land of the blind the one eye'd are king.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what's your problem with crippled dick?}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{look around, this place is a dump! naw, it'd have to work to be a dump.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{you gotta use your imagination.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{"this is patrick..."}
<P>__{(makes the sound of egg}
<D>__{cracking, the sizzling as it}
<P>__{lands in the skillet)}
<D>__{"...and this is patrick on crack." imagination, my butt. even the space cowboy can't...}
<C>__{patrick}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{why don't y'all check out the rest? i'm going downstairs and see if i can get the furnace fired up. warm this place up, you'll see. it has serious potential.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{potential toxic dump site. interior stairs continuous}
<A>__{mia, bill and maurice all climb the stairs as maurice lights a joint with a little box of stick matches.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{are you nuts?}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{the man said just to use my imagination.}
<P>__{(takes a huge hit)}
<D>__{let's see...yeah, i get it. potential. i can see it now. the first major urban theme park. village ghetto land. kinda like legoland, but made entirely from broken glass, hypodermic needles and crack vials. totally e ticket.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{keep smokin', fool.}
<A>__{tia checks out the second floor while bill and maurice continue up the stairs to the third floor. bones' old crib.}
<B>__{with bill and maurice}
<A>__{behind them, barely subliminal glimpse a manshaped darker shadow within a shadow. bill feels a cold wind from nowhere. and hears a whispery sound seemingly carried in the breeze.}
<C>__{hollow echoes}
<D>__{it ain't eh money. it's the big fat floating what if...}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{i didn't say nothing.}
<C>__{hollow echoes}
<D>__{take him down to the storm clear. bury him.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you didn't hear that? "take him... " something. "bury him" or...}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{take who where? what you smokin'?}
<B>__{below on the second floor}
<A>__{tia's checking out a bedroom. hears a light tinkling in a closet. she opens it: empty except a row of rusty metal hangers, holding the moldy remains of bones old suits. downstairs in the basement patrick is there a flashlight, poking around. trying to find the metal knob to turn on the gas. eerie as hell down there. out of the corner of our eyes we see a shadow moving, looming. a scurrying sound and patrick turns his flashlight in the other direction: we glimpse a bloated rat. behind him, the shadow we glimpsed grows, elongates. patrick notes another door. this one padlocked. sensing someone or something behind him, patrick turns with the flashlight. nothing there. but the bones shadow is behind him again. again he feels something and again he turns the flashlight around: nothing. except the bones shadow is again...behind him. shaking it off, patrick heads for the old heater, pulling out matches to light the pilot as bones shadow stays behind him.}
<B>__{bones pov}
<A>__{bones watches as patrick reaches around the gas heater. when patrick strikes a match head, the bones shadow moves even closer to him as patrick reaches in and lights the pilot. when patrick steps back, bones shadow grows and stretches, spreading like an ink stain, reaching across to where the pilot flame flickers. in profile, the shadow mouth blows...but no breath comes out. the flame doesn't even flicker. bones tilts his head back and lets loose an eerie bellow of frustration in a subliminal flash we see a howling mouth, bigger than any human mouth, howling within the shadow face. the sound echoes all through the basement rooms as patrick walks back upstairs. he slaps a nearby plumbing pipe.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{go on old pipes, groan all you like. just please don't burst. that i can't afford.}
<B>__{follow with bones pov}
<A>__{as disappointed in whatever he hoped blowing out the furnace pilot would do, he steps into the rusted remains of the old elevator and the pov begins to levitate.}
