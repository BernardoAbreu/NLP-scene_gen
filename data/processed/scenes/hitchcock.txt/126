<L>__{interior gein house, basement night}
<A>__{we pull back to discover the window is now in a basement lit by a single oil lamp. we find gein sitting at his workbench. hitchcock is perched on a stool nearby watching him. trash and newspapers are piled everywhere. there is grime and dark stains on the cabinets and counters.}
<C>__{ed gein}
<D>__{this is my favorite place. i just shut the doors and leave the world behind.}
<A>__{hitch watches gein as he threads a needle, stitching something expertly together. he notices there's no hint of a tremble in gein's hands.}
<C>__{ed gein }
<D>__{pass me that bag, will you?}
<A>__{hitch passes over the shopping bag... then pulls up his coat, feeling a chill.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{don't you get lonely out here sometimes?}
<C>__{ed gein}
<D>__{i can always talk to my mother.}
<B>__{headlights suddenly rake the room}
<A>__{as we hear cars pull up a lot of them. the sound of men, shouting. flashing red and blue lights. loud knocking at the}
<D>__{door }
<C>__{ed gein }
<D>__{that's strange.}
<A>__{footsteps thunder above him. dozens of officers are fanning out all over the house.}
<C>__{captain schoephoerster }
<D>__{jesus christ.}
<A>__{hitch watches as gein just sits there and the sound of shocked reactions and horrified gasps continue above...}
<C>__{captain schoephoerster }
<D>__{i think we found his hiding spot.}
<C>__{ed gein}
<P>__{(sotto voce)}
<D>__{they can't go in there. that's my mother's room...}
<A>__{car headlights blast through the window and hitchcock finally sees the basement room properly for the first time; knives of all shapes and sizes...jars of preserved body parts...and two severed hands, folded in prayer. from upstairs the sound of splintering wood.}
<C>__{ed gein }
<D>__{they can't go in there!}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{that's my mother's room!!}
<A>__{ed springs to his feet, screaming it out as he bolts upstairs and the pandemonium continues (o.s.) we push in on hitch's face as the bleak reality of gein's lair hits him... it's more profound and horrible than he could ever have imagined. a lush romantic score starts to swell, mercifully drowning it all out...}
