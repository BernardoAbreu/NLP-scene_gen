<L>__{exterior hills night}
<A>__{hector lies by their small fire, watching beatrice, who sleeps by his side. she is dreaming. she mumbles in her sleep, whole sentences. she turns this way and that. hector watches in fascination. we feel the echo of another night when a man watched someone sleep and dream. he handles some of the things spilling from her bag, lying beside him. her dried flowers and herbs, which he sniffs, her little bottles and phials. witches brew? or simply an early version of a cluttered handbag? we don't know what is passing through hector's mind. perhaps he is trying to work out how he came to be lying with the strange, wonderful, unknowable creature by his side. and how many people have done that through the ages, in caves or by campfires, or in suburban bedrooms? there are many ways in which we will be able to connect with this perplexed, flea ridden man, far away from home, huddling by a fire in the forest, trapped in his time, as we all are.}
