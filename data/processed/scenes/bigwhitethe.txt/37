<C>__{dave}
<D>__{yeah? take off your coat. and your shirt, too.}
<A>__{jimbo knows better than to argue. he strips down, exposing his corpulent middle aged belly to the chilly winter winds.}

<C>__{gary}
<D>__{it was our first time. no one gets it perfect their first time.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{you too, sweetie.}
<A>__{gary is about to comply when the sound of a fight on the tobogganing hill causes them all to look over, just in time to see gary's nephew shoved to ground. the bully laughs as he slides away.}

<D>__{excuse me for a second.}

<A>__{behind them on the hill, gary tries to retrieve his nephew's snowrider from the bully. he is failing.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{show me what? an empty trash dumpster? it was supposed to look like an accident. i was hoping to see it in the paper. so help me, if this guy pops up somewhere...}
<A>__{while jimbo does his best to stay warm, behind him on the hill, gary can only watch as the bully slides away.}
