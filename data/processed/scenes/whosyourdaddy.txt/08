<A>__{ted joins his schoolmates, lining up on both sides of the hallway. far from any windows. they all know the drill. christy's just across the hall from ted. he can't take his eyes off of her. charlie duke, 17, approaches ted. he's got a camera around his neck and so much confidence, it's a wonder he can balance his head on his shoulders.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{come on, bro. spare yourself the humiliation, the degradation...}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you and your pep talks.}
<C>__{charlie}

<B>__{freeze frame on charlie.}
<C>__{ted }
