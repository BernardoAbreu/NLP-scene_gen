<L>__{exterior desert evening}
<A>__{the sun is setting. it strikes the horizon sending a ripple of golden light through the sky.}
<L>__{exterior porch of house evening}
<A>__{a man dances in the evening light with a small child in his arms.}
<L>__{exterior corner of house evening}
<A>__{a dog and cat huddle together in sleep.}
<L>__{exterior police station evening}
<A>__{sheriff virgil potter is tossing horseshoes with his deputies.}
<L>__{exterior mckenna house evening}
<A>__{grace watches the sun going down outside her house, cradling herself in her arms. a desert wind gently caresses her.}
<L>__{exterior street corner night}
<A>__{the blind man, along with his dead dog, sits on the side of the street.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{well, that's it. sun's going down. people go home, trade stories over dinner. they'll talk about the day, about the heat, laugh about something crazy it made them do. they'll kiss, sleep a few hours, then do it all over again.}
<A>__{bobby now appears next to the blind man holding two dr. peppers. he hands one to the blind man, takes a sip of the other one, and offers him his own change.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{the day wasn't so bad. we all got through it all right.}
<C>__{blind man }
<D>__{keep it.}
<A>__{there's a suggestion of cockiness in bobby, feeling his luck coming back with the night. his humour is enhanced by his pov down the street: as darrell, with his dilapidated truck, readies sergei's convertible for towing.}
<C>__{blind man }
<D>__{ain't over yet. night is part of day; separate, but equal. night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{difference between you and me, old man, is i see the glass half full, you see it half empty.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. it's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you afraid of the dark?}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{afraid of it? boy, i live in the dark. all cause of a woman who made me this way. people are afraid of what they can't see. i can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me. kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death (he makes a strange sound). it's all the same to me.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{so, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride. is that it?}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{more or less.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{not this twig, friend. i got plans.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{nothing makes the great spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. we all got plans. i planned on seeing all my life. i know you didn't plan on straying into town.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{no and i don't plan on sticking around either.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{well, don't say i didn't warn you when things go your way.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. one minute you lost your eyes in vietnam, next it's the jointerior now it's a woman? i'm hep to you.}
<A>__{the blind man slowly lifts his glasses, showing his eyes at last. where his eyes should be are scars and dead flesh. an ugly sight that even takes bobby back a step.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{used to be a young smartass like you. then i got smart with the wrong man's daughter. got some acid poured on my peepers for my trouble. you know human beings ain't always just human they got animals living inside 'em too...people give spare change to war heroes not fools. all fools get is pity. may not have eyes, but i see. and you, boy?}
<A>__{the blind man puts his glasses back on.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{you got my pity.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{hope she was worth it.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{oh, she was worth it. she was worth every black minute since.}
<A>__{bobby looks at his watch, gets ready to go, drops a coin into the blind man's cup.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{time's up. any last words of wisdom?}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{things ain't always the way they seem. you got to ask yourself: is it worth it? day comes earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! then you better know what it is you're doing. are you a human being or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?}
<A>__{bobby walks away, smiling.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you are crazy, you know. be seeing you, old man.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{you know i won't be seeing you.}
<A>__{the blind man lifts his sunglasses and peers into the cup as if he sees . we don't really know. he reaches into the cup and pulls out the coin bobby tossed in.}
<C>__{blind man}
<D>__{cheap bastard. gives me back my own money... well, jesse, time's up, let's go for a walk.}
<A>__{the blind man now stands up and pulls the seeing eye dog's harness. the dog struggles to its feet and they walk off down the street together.}
