<L>__{interior the celestial eddie's living room night}
<A>__{eddie is tearing through boxes as the pounding and drilling become deafening... he rips open a box labeled "kitchen" it's full of books. mis labeled. jump cuts as he rips open other boxes... his hands frantically scattering cds, cutlery, cans of food... the door begins to give. under the deafening}
<T>__{drill:}
<A>__{more jump cuts as eddie hysterically tears the packing paper off of promisingly shaped objects. no. a glass. no. a vase. yes! the sugar bowl. with sugar still inside! eddie rummages, frantically, among the sugar cubes as the door gives a few inches, groaning, and we glimpse blurred faces on the other side...}
<C>__{eddie's hand}
<A>__{pokes, wildly, among the cubes... pushing them aside, revealing at the bottom of the bowl one mdt tablet looks back up at him. yes. it's really there! eddie grabs it, just as, with a splintering crash! the door goes down. eddie steps back, brings the pill up to his mouth... but as he steps, he trips on a soup can he's scattered... he falls backwards... his hand hits the side of the coffee table... the mdt tablet goes flying... (slow motion)... as... ...also in slow motion, gennady and his two thugs smile as they advance into the room... the mdt tablet... flies... flies... towards a grate in the floor a heating vent and hits it... rolling... ... before disappearing forever down the grate. eddie knows that's it. his life has ended. he sucks in his last breath then, with a yell, he rushes back for the terrace... for his suicide leap... thug #1 is quicker. gets to the door first. eddie will not have the luck to be able to jump. he's trapped between the two thugs.}
<C>__{gennady}
<D>__{i told you i want more. you don't listen. maybe you think i'm joking...}
<A>__{he reaches into his coat pocket...}
<C>__{gennady }
<D>__{but i'm down to this last one.}
<A>__{...and pulls out a syringe.}
<C>__{gennady }
<D>__{see, i dissolve pill in solution. you shoot it goes straight into blood and to brain. works much better.}
<A>__{he pulls the plastic sleeve off the needle. jabs himself in the arm and injects the cloudy liquid.}
<C>__{gennady }
<D>__{now. where do you keep yours?}
<A>__{eddie is backed to the wall. nowhere to go.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{i'm plum out.}
<A>__{gennady just smiles that was an unfortunate choice. he gives an order to the thugs who grab their tools and disappear deeper into the apartment. we hear them starting to tear things up. gennady and eddie are alone.}
<C>__{gennady}
<D>__{they will find it. or i will make you tell me. which is quicker? we see, huh?}
<A>__{he clicks open a black attache case. it is filled with sinister looking silver instruments, and knives.}
