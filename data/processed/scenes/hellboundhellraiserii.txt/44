<A>__{after a few seconds silence we hear a repeated clicking sound, as if something is being forced, followed by a louder snap and the sound of a sash window being opened. the curtains balloon inwards, part, and kyle steps into the room. he stands still for a moment, as if making sure he is alone, and then begins to take in his surroundings. the room is entirely devoted to malahide's secret obsession with the paranormal in general and the lament configuration in particular. it is a fair sized, square shaped room. prints, paintings, and photographs cover the walls. all of these pictures relate in some way to his obsession; photographs of ghost sightings; portraits of magicians from cagliostro to crowley; prints of arcane symbols and pentagrams, etc. specifically, we recognize a print that resembles very closely the jigsaw he has had tiffany recently solve. also, there are framed diagrams (which look very old) of the lament configuration both open and closed. on a long, low table there are three glass cases. in each of these cases is a lament configuration. on each case is a small label giving a location, a date of acquisition, and a number which we may assume to be the number of deaths attributable to that specific box. these labels read: cairo 3 4 '59 7}

<A>__{there are also, on a small desk top bookshelf on a writing table, editions of malahide's own books. he seems to have spent his career publicly denying what he is privately obsessed with because the books titles include 'possession: not demons but disease','the myth of the diabolic', and 'the internal inferno'.}

<A>__{we assume he has visited malahide's house before, but he has clearly never seen this room. he stares at the mattress with incredulity, as if he still can't believe his superior has had it brought here. then he begins to look around the room in more detail. he approaches the glass cases and bends slightly to look at their contents. kyle shakes his head.}
