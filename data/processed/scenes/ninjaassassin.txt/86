<L>__{interior safe house vault night}
<A>__{raizo is chained to the walls of a vault. spread eagled, double locked, and lit from all sides so there are no shadows anywhere in the room. raizo's head sags. eyes closed. cameras stare at him.}
<L>__{interior safe house ground floor night}
<A>__{classic berlin aesthetic. a modern office shoe horned into an abandoned building: cubicles, computers and aeron chairs amidst crumbling walls. maslow's team are hanging out there, thirty agents, a fairly competent and well armed bunch. maslow is inside the control room which is like a small construction trailer. several different monitors have images of raizo.}
<C>__{security goon}
<D>__{prisoner is secure sir.}
<A>__{for a moment it appears that raizo looks up as maslow looks at him, as if somehow raizo could see through the lens watching him. then his head drops again.}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{he scans the different monitors.}
<C>__{maslow }
<D>__{something's wrong with the infrared cam.}
<C>__{security goon}
<D>__{no sir, we checked it.}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{then why isn't he showing up?}
<C>__{security goon}
<D>__{we think he's able to lower the temperature of his body to remain neutral.}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{or maybe he's just cold blooded. security goon #2 sir!}
<A>__{the goon struggles to stop mika as she storms inside.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{ryan, you know this is wrong! it can't be legal! what is this place? your own private guantanamo?}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{it's an old gdr safehouse. jamison wants this off the grid.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{ryan you're making a huge mistake!}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{i don't think so. we got reports from washington, london, osaka all tagging your boy. only problem we have is where to extradite him first.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{so two weeks ago, there's no such thing as a ninja and now every city in the world has a warrant for one?}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{we must respect the jurisprudence of the regional government and corresponding law enforcement agencies.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{he's not the enemy.}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{no? you ever heard of stockholm syndrome i'm getting the feeling i'm looking at a pretty serious case of it.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{i'm not crazy. this is!}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{he's a killer, mika. weren't you the one telling me it was our job to stop him.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{you're not listening to me!}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{you're not saying anything worth hearing. look, if want to do the insubordination tango, let's go, but not in front of the kids okay? boys, give us a minute.}
<A>__{the security goons clear out, closing the door behind them.}
