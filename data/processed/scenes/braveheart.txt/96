<L>__{exterior marion's grove night}
<A>__{wallace is in the grove of trees where marion is buried. drinking in the silence, his own isolation. he hears a rustle behind him, and spins, drawing the broadsword. then his face registers... it's hamish and stephen. hamish is unsure if he did the right thing in coming here unsure, until wallace moves to them, and hugs them.}
<L>__{interior cave night}
<A>__{they are in the old secret cave; rain is falling, but it's dry inside, with a campfire smoldering at the entrance.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{thanks for the food and drink. and for bringing 'em yourselves.}
<C>__{hamish}
<D>__{we're here to stay. we don't care to live, if we can't fight beside ya.}
<A>__{stephen pulls a jug of whiskey from his pocket. he swigs, hands it to hamish for a chug, then to wallace, who declines, but smiles for the first time in many weeks.}
<C>__{hamish}
<D>__{there is... one thing, william. longshanks is offering a truce. he has dispatched his daughter in law as his emissary, and she has sent word that she wishes to meet you in a barn.}
<A>__{wallace frowns; a barn?}
