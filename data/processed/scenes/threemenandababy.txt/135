<L>__{exterior riverside day}
<A>__{graton and jack are sitting on a bench beside the east river. jack, still pregnant, has brought along his bottle of scotch, and he takes a swig from it occasion ally. graton has brought along his rabbit.}
<C>__{graton}
<D>__{there's something i have to know...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{wouldn't you like to be pregnant?}
<C>__{graton}
<D>__{what? oh sure... maybe... no... i dunno... look, there's been something bothering me for a long time.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you see, if i was god, and i could create the world all over again, here's what i would do: i would create adam from eve's rib, not the other way around.}
<C>__{graton}
<P>__{(having trouble following)}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{graton }
<D>__{that's an interesting idea... actually, i just wanted to ask you...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{at least that way things would have been clearer to begin with, y'see. they wouldn't have made us believe that somebody could come out of our rib, y'know? 'cause nothing ever comes out of our rib, y'know? ever. only out of our prick, and even then ... everything still has to be done after that.}
<C>__{graton}
<P>__{(very unsure)}
<D>__{that's for sure...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what we men know how to make is planes, buildings, cars, and all that stuff... it's useful, mind you...}
<C>__{graton}
<D>__{it's driving me crazy! this thing keeps going around and around in my head...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{and you know what, it's not even like they wanted us to believe it it might have been us who wanted to believe it... but let's face it, nobody comes out of our rib...}
<C>__{graton}
<P>__{(dives right in)}
<D>__{was the dope in the diaper, yes or no?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{still, that's hard to take, goddam it!}
<C>__{graton}
<D>__{was it in the diaper, or not?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{the dope? it was in the diaper, why?}
<C>__{graton}
<P>__{(getting up)}
<D>__{oh, thanks a lot. i feel so much better now. here, this is a rabbit for your baby.}
<P>__{(shakes both jack's hands)}
<D>__{thanks again, 'bye, i'm so happy.}
<A>__{graton goes off, floating on cloud nine.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(reaching out}
<D>__{toward him}
<P>__{with the rabbit)}
<D>__{but wait the baby's gone...}
