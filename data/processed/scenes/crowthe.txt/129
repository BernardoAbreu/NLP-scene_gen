<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior cityscape day}
<A>__{high blue sky. it might even be pretty if it wasn't detroit.}
<L>__{interior lao's club office day}
<A>__{the tv flybank pulses with videotaped images of club trash's of various performers including diabolique. on several screens, one by one, various images of a guitar playing eric draven freeze frame as we pull back to the desk. lao has the 8x10 from the corridor gallery. he places it within eyeshot and resumes work on the desk below frame; we can't see it yet, among other scattered research and inconcubula. angle grange entering and crossing to the desk. as he comes up to the desk, he draws back.}
<C>__{grange}
<D>__{what... the hell is that?}
<C>__{lao}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{this is a cobra, mr. grange. yes, it is real.}
<A>__{new angle lao and grange revealing lao with a sealed cage, holding a large, live cobra in his hands. the killing blade is nearby.}
<C>__{grange}
<D>__{that thing is poisonous.}
<C>__{lao}
<D>__{extremely so.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you and i are the recipients of unwanted good fortune, in the form of a man everyone is calling the crow.}
<A>__{grange makes a face. can't keep his eyes off the cobra.}
<C>__{grange}
<D>__{give me a break. that guy's a wacko...}
<C>__{lao}
<D>__{i intend no slight to you, but i cannot find the english to adequately express just what he is. i suppose western mythology would describe him as a fury.}
<C>__{grange}
<D>__{not a plymouth fury, i bet.}
<A>__{lao chuckles indulgently.}
<C>__{lao}
<D>__{do you know of spirit assassins? you do know the dead can rise? properly motivated, of course.}
<C>__{grange}
<D>__{like some sort of zombie on a revenge trip.}
<C>__{lao}
<D>__{mmm. but tonight i can take what is his.}
<C>__{grange}
<D>__{only thing you'll get from that clown is a faster way to die.}
<C>__{lao}
<D>__{to the contrary...}
<A>__{zzlip! lao smoothly beheads the snake with the blade against the stone surface of the desk and discards the writhing body. he squeezes behind one of the eyes and a venom sac protrudes like a dark pimento. lao pulls it free of the milky, clinging tissue and eats it. off grange's stunned expression.}
<C>__{lao }
<D>__{...all the dying tonight will be done by the former eric draven.}
<A>__{lao exhibits the blade to grange as though it explains all.}
<C>__{lao }
<D>__{who is only invulnerable so long as he cares about the dead. when he begins to care about the living, you'll find his heart can bleed... and i want it to bleed for me.}
<C>__{grange}
<D>__{kill a dead guy?}
<A>__{lao pops the second venom sac; swallows it. pleased.}
<C>__{lao}
<D>__{truly kill him. so i may crush his skull and smoke it.}
<A>__{lao shrugs. grange can handle it.}
<C>__{lao }
<D>__{let it suffice that i need him... and to get to him, we'll need his little friend.}
<A>__{finally, an assignment grange can comfortable understand.}
