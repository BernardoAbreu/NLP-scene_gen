<A>__{bethlehem sits waiting at his camp table. behind him, a finished painting. this time he's painted himself in the grand rococo style as part of the holy family with doves and flowers and glowing rays from heaven. it's awful. getty and gibbs bring in a prisoner. it's ford!}

<D>__{'bethlehem. this letter is my testimony to the fact that there is no restored united states and there is no postal service.'}
<P>__{(laugh; grim)}
<D>__{then who the hell have we been fighting...?}
<P>__{(reads on)}
<D>__{'my carriers are returning home. in exchange, i'm asking you to let them be. the postman.'}
<A>__{bethlehem eyes ford with undisguised contempt.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{he expects me to believe this?}
<C>__{luke }

<A>__{it takes a moment for the news to sink in. but it does.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{then i've won. i've won.}

<D>__{i couldn't get close enough.}
<P>__{(re: ford)}
<D>__{this one's his second in command.}
<A>__{bethlehem looks ford over.}

<D>__{why doesn't that surprise me?}
<A>__{ford stares back. proud. bethlehem looks to getty.}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{bring out the one we found yesterday. they can die together.}
<A>__{a frightened carrier is brought up. he wears a purple uniform with cali sewn on the shoulder. neither we nor ford have seen him before. as a firing squad assembles, ford is shoved over with him.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{cal carrier}
<D>__{name's clark. postal carrier of the restored republic of california. who are you?}

<C>__{cali carrier}
<D>__{it's an honor.}
<A>__{bethlehem watches as clark holds out his hand. ford shakes it. "aim!"}

<D>__{wait a minute... wait a minute!}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{bethlehem}
<D>__{hold your fire! you don't know each other?}

<D>__{this will never be over. it'll go on except i will be fighting a goddamn ghost.}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{should we fire, sir?}
<C>__{bethlehem}
