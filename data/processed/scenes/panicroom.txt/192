<A>__{the swirling bonds melt into swirling leaves, blowing in the air over central park on a crisp fall day. the leaves float down, over the great lawn, that massive expanse of grass we saw in meg's hallucination. but on a day like this the great lawn's full of people, throwing frisbees, playing football, lying there doing nothing. the leaves land on the grass next to meg and sarah, stretched out on a blanket, a newspaper spread in front of them, open to the ads. meg is on her back, arms folded behind her head, staring up at the clouds. sarah is intent on the paper, circling the occasional ad.}

<D>__{i mean, uptown is close to dad's place, but somebody at school said the village is really cool, so... i don't know, it's so great to be close to the park and everything... what do you think, i mean, give me a clue, here, where are we gonna live?}
<A>__{meg rolls over, props herself up on one elbow. she seems years younger. she looks at sarah, reaches out, brushes her daughter's hair behind one ear. she smiles. she is calm. behind her, a flock of pigeons takes off, leaping into the clear autumn sky.}
