<A>__{steve and matt are seen flying around, steve further away, near a large cloud bank. matt is using his abilities to shape cloud fluff into an m. there is a humming, rattling sound, slightly audible even over the deafening wind.}
<C>__{andrew }
<D>__{guys, do you hear that?}
<A>__{neither of the guys can hear him. steve however stops in the distance, looking around. he shouts something, inaudible.}
<D>__{andrew (o.s.) (cont'd) what? i can't hear you!}
<A>__{steve pantomimes, pointing at his ear and shrugging. a boeing 737 blows out of the cloudbank behind steve. he's spun like a top in its wake, and drops like a rock. suddenly we're launched downwards, and after a moment, the camera disconnects from andrew, and we see him zooming ahead. the camera, in free fall, spins wildly, then suddenly it swims through the air dizzily and lands relatively gently in some tall grass. less than a second later, andrew and steve come falling down into the grass and roll roughly, splitting apart. they lay there, breathing hard. andrew sits up, coughing; his eyes, nose and mouth bleeding. steve suddenly leaps up.}
