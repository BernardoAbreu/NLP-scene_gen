<L>__{exterior little grocery store across the street. day.}
<A>__{the camera remains just behind bonnie's shoulder so that throughout the following scene we have bonnie in the picture, looking at what we look at. clyde goes into the little store. we remain outside with bonnie watching. for a minute nothing happens. we can barely see what is going on in the store. then clyde comes out, walking slowly. in one hand he holds the gun, in the other a fistful of money. he gets halfway, to bonnie and smiles broadly at her, a smile of charm and personality. she smiles back. the moment is intense, as if a spark has jumped from one to the other. their relationship, which began the minute bonnie spotted him in the driveway, has now really begun. clyde has shown his stuff and bonnie is "turned on." suddenly the old man who runs the grocery store comes running out into the street, completely dumbfounded. he stands there and says nothing, yet his mouth moves in silent protest. clyde points the gun above him and fires. it is the first loud noise in the film thus far and it should be a shock. the old man, terrified, runs back into the store as fast as he can, clyde quickly grabs bonnie's hand. the camera swings with them as they turn and begin to run down the street. a few yards and the stores disappear entirely. the landscape turns into that arid, flat and unrelieved western plain that begins where the town ends.}
