<L>__{interior gym night}
<A>__{forsythe finally opens her eyes. she smiles at st. luc, who hovers anxiously over her as she lies on the gym mat.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{can you walk? i couldn't find anything wrong with you.}
<A>__{forsythe nods and manages to sit up with st. luc's help. once she seems able to stay propped up without st. luc's help, he gets up and begins to move the barricade away from the door.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{rollo and the police should be here by now. it's just a question of avoiding infected residents until we find them.}
<A>__{st. luc comes back to forsythe and kneels beside her.}
<C>__{st.luc}
<D>__{ok? ready to go?}
<A>__{forsythe puts her arm around st. luc's neck as though wanting support. instead, she draws him down toward her and begins to babble in a strange, casual, dreamy way.}
<C>__{forsythe}
<D>__{sometimes i have a recurrent dream. have i ever told you about it, darling? i guess you could call it a freudian dream, because in this dream i find myself making love to sigmund freud. but i'm having trouble because he's old and dying, and he smells bad and i find him repulsive. and then he tells me that everything is erotic, everything is sexual, you know what i mean? he has a very thick accent, but i can understand him perfectly. he tells me that even old flesh is erotic flesh, that disease is the love of two alien kinds of creatures for each other, that dying is an act of eroticism, that even chemicals combine out of sexual frenzy and longing. that breathing is sexual, that talking is sexual, that just to physically exist is sexual... and i believe him, and we make love beautifully...}
<A>__{while she talks, forsythe gradually slips her arms around st. luc's neck and brings her lips closer and closer to his. st. luc, mesmerized by the hypnotic drone of her words, is about to kiss her. suddenly her mouth snaps open wide with mechanical precision, her head tilts back, her eyes flick closed. st. luc stares at her in horror as her throat begins to swell. in the depths of forsythe's mouth two parasite tentacles probe about, seeking a firm hold for their suckers so that they can pull the parasite's body out of her narrow esophagus. st. luc hesitates only for an instant, then rips a strip from her blouse, balls it up, and shoves it into her mouth. holding her while she struggles to remove it, he rips off a second strip and ties it around her head to keep the gag in. st. luc rises, throws forsythe over his shoulder and begins to step toward the door of the gym. dangling over st. luc's shoulder, forsythe struggles, moans, and howls as best she can. st. luc manages to pin her hands to her sides so that she can't pull the gag out. before st. luc reaches the door, a handsome middle aged woman peeks in around the corner.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(crooning in reply to forsythe's howl)}
<D>__{hellooooo? oooooo? is there anyone here who's all alooooooooone?}
<A>__{st. luc rushes at the woman, knocking her over. she rolls on the floor, hugging herself and crooning. once out the door, st. luc makes for the nearest exit.}
