<L>__{interior player's barracks day}
<A>__{like an army barracks. rows of bunk beds seperated by lockers. taylor walks in with temple, the hitting instructor.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{what happened to the private rooms?}
<C>__{temple}
<D>__{we're on an austerity program. this is what happens when you finish 24 games out.}
<A>__{brown, pepper, temple and donovan back at the field, supervising the arrival of more players. the first is a tall, muscular latin, pedro cerrano, dressed in black from head to toe. he arrives on foot, carrying a black suitcase and pulling a black bat case on wheels. he looks like a gunfighter coming into dodge.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{who's that?}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{i think it's cerrano. defected from cuba. wanted religious freedom.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{what's his religion?}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{voodoo.}
<A>__{black and tan rolls royce pulling into the parking lot. out steps rodger dorn, high priced third baseman. brown eyes him with vague disapproval.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{thought you didn't have any high priced talent.}
<C>__{donovan}
<P>__{(sheepish)}
<D>__{i forgot about dorn, 'cause he's only high priced. got him as a free agent three years ago.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{still hits the ball pretty well, doesn't he?}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{yeh, he just can't field it.}
<A>__{dorn pulls his golf clubs out of the car.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{we'll shape him up.}
<B>__{willie hayes}
<A>__{a 22 year old black, pulling up in a '72 vw beetle which he's got a cadillac grille on. he steps out in his shades and sharkskin suit.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{don't recognize this guy.}
<A>__{hayes strolls up and introduces himself.}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{say hey, willie mays hayes here. i play like mays and run like hayes.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{lou brown. nice to meet ya, hayes.}
<C>__{hayes}
<D>__{thanks. well, i gotta get my stuff...}
<A>__{hayes hustles off toward his car.}
<C>__{donovan}
<D>__{i don't remember a hayes on the list.}
<A>__{a motorcycle pulls to a stop in the lot, diverting everyone's attention from hayes. off steps ricky vaughn, a hefty bag over his shoulder. he's still sporting his radical do.}
<C>__{pepper}
<D>__{look at this fuckin' guy.}
<C>__{temple}
<D>__{maybe he's the mascot.}
<A>__{donovan is speechless. brown breaks into a small smile. yes, sir, this is his kinda team.}
