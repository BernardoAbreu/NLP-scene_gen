<L>__{interior gondorff's room night}
<A>__{gondorff and hooker are playing gin rummy and drinking. gondorff makes little comments as he plays, but hooker is quiet and withdrawn. the carousel is not in operation and a heavy silence hangs over the place.}
<C>__{gondorff}
<D>__{what's the matter, kid? you're not sayin' much.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{just a little nervous, that's all.}
<C>__{gondorff}
<D>__{luther always told me to bite my toenails when i get nervous. you see yourself doin' that and you realize it ain't worth it.}
<A>__{hooker smiles feebly. billie appears at the door.}
<C>__{billie}
<D>__{things are a little slow tonight, henry. i wanna open the round for the girls.}
<A>__{gondorff takes out a set of keys and tosses them to her. she leaves to go start the merry go round. gondorff settles back into the game.}
<C>__{gondorff}
<D>__{take it easy, you won't lose him now. we had him 10 years ago when he decided to be somebody. believe me, i've seen enough to know.}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{how many guys you conned in your life, henry?}
<C>__{gondorff}
<D>__{two or three hundred i guess. sometimes played two a day when i was in shea's mob. we had it down to a business.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{'course chicago was a right town then. the fix was in. the dicks took their end without a beef. all the wall street boys wanted to make investments for us. even had marks looking us up, thinkin' they could beat the game.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{yeh, kid, it really stunk. no sense in bein' a grifter if it's the same as bein' a citizen.}
<A>__{gondorff chucks his cards on the table. he's through for the night.}
<C>__{gondorff}
<D>__{i better do some packin'. i'm gonna be a hot number again after tomorrow.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{then why you doin' it?}
<C>__{gondorff}
<D>__{seems worthwhile, doesn't it? maybe it's just for the cave in on lonnegan's face when we put in the sting.}
<A>__{that's good enough. hooker gets up to leave.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{henry.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{yeh.}
<C>__{hooker}
<P>__{(apologetically)}
<D>__{i appreciate your stickin' your neck out. i wouldn't have asked ya if it weren't for luther.}
<C>__{gondorff}
<D>__{ain't nothin' gonna make up for luther, kid.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{revenge is for suckers. i been griftin' 30 years and never got any.}
<A>__{hooker just nods and walks out the door.}
