<A>__{memphis is at the kitchen table. the list of cars before him. he's making notations. he gets to his feet ... he goes to check on his mother ... she's asleep in her room... he closes the door ... and goes back to the kitchen. he goes to a framed photograph of he and kip. earlier times. happier times. when there is an enormous thud! from outside. memphis goes to a window. sees a ramp truck unloading a gnarled blob of metal. memphis runs outside. just as the ramp truck drives off ... memphis goes to the mangled trans am... leans down ... and there's kip ... seriously smooshed in the flattened car.}

<D>__{i think so. there's things i can't feel right now. like my feet. but ... you think you can get me outta this, memphis? i'd appreciate it }
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{just hold on there }
<A>__{memphis goes to the garage ... finds a crowbar, an acetylene torch, tin snips ... he goes back to the wrecked car... and sets to work... he looks at kip ... shakes his head...}

<D>__{oh. you maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car crusher ?}
<C>__{kip}
<D>__{all my enemies own car crushers. it's like a pre requisite ... owwww...}
<C>__{memphis}
<D>__{easy ... take it easy ... we're almost there...}
<A>__{indeed... memphis has freed him ... kip crawls from the wreckage ... his clothes in tatters... blood seeps from a variety of contusions ... he limps ... memphis helps him to the guest house}
