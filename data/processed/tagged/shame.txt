<C>__{david }
<D>__{yeah?}
<A>__{brandon doesn't want to hear. brandon stands back against a wall, as if transfixed, as if he cannot take any more. his breathing is irregular. something of the past has come to the present. all of his distractions have now stopped, and he is at once confronted with himself. his face bears the pain of something long passed, but visually present. this wound has not healed. jolting himself out of his trance, brandon hurriedly heads out into the corridor }

<A>__{later brandon enters his apartment checking for noises. the sound of movement in the bathroom. he pushes open his bedroom door. it's like a murder scene. pale blue sheets in disarray, the mattress nearly coming off the bed, sheets soaked with sweat and the smell of sex. a lone condom disregarded on the floor. we see his bedside drawer ajar. he walks into his bedroom and pushes the drawer shut.}
<L>__{interior bedroom. apartment. night.}
<A>__{later brandon lies on his bed, with clean white sheets, sidelight on. sissy enters. brandon opens his eyes, inwardly flinches. sissy gets into the bed, covering herself with the white sheet. snuggles up to brandon}

<C>__{brandon }
<D>__{get the fuck out! get out!}
<A>__{sissy gets up, deliberate, as if rising from the dead, and slowly walks around the bed. sissy slams the bedroom door on her exit.}

<A>__{brandon stands at the end of a long pier, looking out toward the hudson river, the lap of murky water, audible. he hovers for a moment, and considers, then slowly makes his way back to the main road. the glittering lights of jersey stretching wide beyond.}
<L>__{exterior near standard hotel. night.}
<A>__{above, the tall, endless glass of the standard hotel, scored with a honeycomb of windows, randomly illuminated like tiny still lives. brandon comes to a corner, lights a cigarette and leans. above him, engraved in stone is "1949." he looks up toward the tall building, which appears like a stasi east berlin building. stark and authoritative. a kid slaps his palms against the glass of a fourth floor window, a filipino nanny ushers him away. a woman, early 30s, phone to her ear, dressed in black jeans and t shirt, paces along the window. catching sight of brandon, she pulls the curtain along the length of the glass. a man stares blankly out, clearly fresh in on a flight and jet lagged, enjoying the view two floors up. a female cleaner just visible lost in the monotony of cleaning, makes large brush strokes with a large pink fluffy duster. and then brandon sees her a middle aged woman stands, naked her body pressed against the floor to ceiling glass, high up, overlooking the hudson river. the steady back and forth of the middle aged man behind her gradually reveals both are lost in a stand up fuck. brandon hesitates, quiet fascination flickering across his face as for a brief flickering moment brandon's eyes lock with the middle aged woman's dead gaze, standing high above a car horn loud unremitting brandon turns, his hypnotism broken. it's as if he comes back to himself.}
<L>__{exterior street. near restaurant. night.}

<D>__{ok. i will be back.}
<A>__{the waiter smiles, at last moves off they sit looking at their menus. brandon steals a moment, eyes tracing over marianne's fingers playing with the edge of her menu the flutter of her lashes nipples ghosting her dress. an ring indent around her wedding finger, the shrink of skin.}
