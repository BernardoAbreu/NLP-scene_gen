<L>__{73b on sarah as she rounds a corner and sees the elevators ahead.}
<A>__{now she's home free. at a full tilt sprint, she's nearly there when the elevator doors part... terminator steps out... his head swivels to face her. sarah reacts, stricken by the image from her worst nightmares. her eyes go wide as momentum carries her forward. her bare feet slip on the slick tile. she slams to the floor, staring up at the leather clad figure with the shotgun. she loses all semblance of courage and some of her sanity. she's not even aware that she is screaming, or what would be screaming if she could get the breath to do it. in slowed down dream time, sarah scrambles back along the floor like a crab, spinning and clawing her way to her feet along the wall. she runs like the wind, like in her nightmare. if she looked back she would have seen john step warily out of the corridor behind terminator. john, however, catches a glimpse of the fleeing sarah and figures out instantly what happened.}

<D>__{mom!! wait!}
<A>__{sarah doesn't hear. she has clicked fully into her own nightmare. they take off running after sarah.}
