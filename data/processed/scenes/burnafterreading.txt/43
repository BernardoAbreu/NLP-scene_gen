<L>__{interior yacht night}
<A>__{we are in the bedroom. the boat rides gently at anchor. harry has an arm around katie, in bed. both stare at a point in space. after a beat that is silent except for the faint sloshing of water against hull:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{... and then, you know, you grow up. i guess that's what's happened with me. you just... people change. we married when i was, what, in my mid twenties. a kid. we were kids. twenties. you think it's forever. then, you know, you're older you begin to feel your mortality, you start to think, well, there's no more time for dishonesty. subterfuge. you go, i'm not that person. the choices you made, you can't, just through inertia }
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{i'm thinking of divorcing ozzie.}
<A>__{harry doesn't react a careful, studied non reaction. after more sloshing:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{... i'm just thinking, whoa. i mean, frankly, i'm thinking, whoa. i, i, i guess that's what i should be thinking about too. with sandy.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{that's what you were just saying.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yes! absolutely! and you should be getting rid of that bozo. no question about that. i agree.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{so if i were divorced }
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well yes, if you were uh, you know, yes. yes, i should settle things. with sandy. because of you and me. it just takes, courage, you know. to inflict that pain. scary stuff.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{scary stuff. you're a brave lady. well, of course, it would be easier for you.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{why's that? i don't see that.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<D>__{well you know, because he's such a dope.}
<P>__{(sobers)}
<D>__{but sandy, she's... a good lady. a very special lady.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{she's a cold, stuck up bitch.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well that's... a little }
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{you and i should sort things out. i've told you that this is not just frivolity.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no, that's understood. you've been very straight.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{i thought i was loud and clear.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{absolutely. not just fun and games.}
<A>__{awkward beat. the sloshing of waves. harry nods.}
