<D>__{[deleted scene from 1st. draft]}
<A>__{"...in an early draft of the script, ray, the befuddled bartender who for want of a more compelling character served as our story's hero, fled the scene of the tale's protracted central murder and checked into a motel outside of san antonio:"}
<B>__{motel lobby day}
<A>__{dusty rhodes, a lean man with a weathered face and large adam's apple, stands behind the formica check in counter. kyle, a heavyset man of thirty wearing a feed cap, sits in the lobby's one piece of furniture, a beat up leatherette sofa. he sips from a can of soda. ray, begrimed and haggard, enters out of the glare of the noonday sun.}
<C>__{rhodes}
<D>__{hey there, stranger! what can i do you for?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i need a room.}
<A>__{calling out from the divan:}

<C>__{ray}
<D>__{how much extra?}
<C>__{kyle}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{he wants the tv option, dusty.}
<C>__{rhodes}
<D>__{i reckon i can hear him. tv option, that's a dollar twenty, makes nine eighty six plus tax.}

<C>__{rhodes}
<D>__{channels, we got two and six. two don't come in so hot.}

<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{sure don't.}
<C>__{rhodes}
<D>__{see, wednesday's the special on rc cola. i don't know if i explained about the tv option. if there's a tv in the room, you got to pay the option.}

<C>__{rhodes}
<D>__{well see the thing about that is, we're booked.}
<A>__{"looking at this scene now, years later, it strikes us that revising it out of existence, as we did, constituted too much rewriting. indeed, the more prosaic scene we replaced it with, involving ray stopped at a traffic light, can be found in the finished script but not in the finished movie. it was shot but then deleted in order to more quickly get to the carnage, which was the picture's raison d' etre..."}
