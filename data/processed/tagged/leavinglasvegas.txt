<C>__{ben}
<D>__{... and i'm not here to demand your attention to the point where it changes your life. we know i'm a drunk... but that seems to be all right with you. and i know that you're a hooker. i hope you understand that i'm a person who is totally at ease with this... which is not to say that i'm indifferent or that i don't care... i do... it simply means that i trust and accept your judgement. what i'm saying is... that i hope you understand that i understand.}
