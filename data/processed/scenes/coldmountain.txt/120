<A>__{jo sets on esco, knocking him backwards into a sheet, where it gets twisted, while jo kicks and punches, little spots of blood staining the sheet with each blow. mo pulls out his sabre and runs esco through, leaves the sabre in deep, pinning esco to the sheet, then spinning him round in the sheet so that it tightens. a stain grows out from the blade, huge and spreading. teague walks to esco.}
