<B>__{a human passenger}
<A>__{sitting, reclined, in the chair. he is large, round and soft like a big baby. wears a red, bnl jumpsuit. the chair seems to be steering itself. guided by floor lines, just like the robots. speaker headrests block his peripheral vision. a holographic screen floats inches in front of his face. he converses with a second passenger on screen:}
<D>__{passenger #1 well, i've been in my cabin all morning so let's hover over to the driving range and hit a few virtual balls into space.}
<P>__{passenger #2 (on screen)}
<D>__{nah, we did that yesterday. i don't want to do that. passenger #1 well then what do you want to do?}
<A>__{on wall e he looks over his shoulder. passenger #2 is floating right next to them. isolated in his own hover chair. also in a red jumpsuit. also a big baby.}
<D>__{passenger #2 i don't know. something.}
<A>__{both humans are totally unaware of the other's presence. they all exit the hallway. merge into the...}
<B>__{economy class courtyard}
<A>__{wall e is in awe. hundreds of floors of guest rooms rise on all sides. thousands of passengers fill the giant space. all reclined and riding on hover chairs. multiple floor lines guide their chairs in all directions. humans have become the most extreme form of couch potatoes. absolutely no reason to ever get up. no purpose. every one of them engrossed in their video screens. cocooned in virtual worlds. over developed fingers tap armrest keypads. the controls allow them to steer... ...order food... ...play games... ...and most of all... ...chat mindlessly with other passengers: the chatter is deafening. no one notices wall e at all. he drives into the endless human traffic.}
<C>__{misc. female passenger}
<D>__{bot, over here!}
<A>__{a drink bot floats over to a passenger. puts a fresh drink in her open hand. wall e flows with the traffic into a large tunnel.}
<C>__{misc. passengers}
<D>__{i can't hear you...i'm in a tunnel. you're breaking up...oh, okay. you're back. i can hear you now...}
<A>__{they spill out into the bright light of the main concourse (coach class) a city sized, mall like environment. all under a giant dome. the ceiling simulates the sun and sky. a bnl logo (w time & temp) appears on the face of the sun.}
<C>__{ship's computer }
<D>__{buy n large. everything you need to be happy. your day is very important to us.}
<A>__{wall e is gobsmacked. a passenger (john) hovers up alongside him. tries to hand off his empty drink cup to wall e.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hey, drink bot.}
<A>__{wall e shies away. john reaches farther out with the cup.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{here, take the cup. take the cup whoa!}
<A>__{reaches too far. john falls to the floor. flails like an upside down turtle. unable to stand on his baby legs. instantly, sirens. wall e watches two stewards arrive. block john's accident. emergency lines appear on the floor. redirect the hover chair traffic. john reaches out for assistance. nobody notices. just drive past.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{stewards? hello? uhh, help.}
<C>__{steward}
<D>__{please remain stationary. a service bot will be here to assist you momentarily.}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{uhh...hey! what's going on?}
<A>__{wall e lifting him up from behind. loads him back onto his chair. john doesn't know how to react. wall e waves hello.}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{uhh... john. wall e ee vah?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{uh no, john.}
<A>__{wall e scans the concourse. spots eve's transport about to board a monorail. he races after them. abandons the stunned john.}
<D>__{wall e ee vah!}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(small wave)}
<D>__{bye...wall e.}
<B>__{on monorail}
<A>__{it pulls out of the station. wall e leaps on. barely catches the last car. it glides down the concourse.}
