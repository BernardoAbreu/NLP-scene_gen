<L>__{interior panic room night}
<A>__{sparks fly as burnham goes to work on the floor safe with a small, specialized drill. raoul bends down next to him.}

<L>__{interior living room night}
<A>__{meg is in the living room, with harris, who is still slouched in the chair. he's in awful shape, barely conscious. out of the silence, a sudden, deafening sound. the doorbell. her eyes go wide. she darts a look over to the door (the one that leads to the stoop, not the bloody kitchen door downstairs), then back at harris.}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{police.}
<C>__{meg}
<P>__{(gasps)}
<D>__{you called the police?}
<A>__{he nods.}
<C>__{harris}
<D>__{you... scared...}
<A>__{shit. this is exactly what she prayed for him to do, now it's the worst thing that could happen. she stands, thinking, desperate. she walks toward the door, stops, thinks some more. the doorbell rings again. she comes up with a plan. she goes back to where harris is in the chair, pulls the chair back a few feet, out of view of the door. she puts the gun in his lap, puts his hand over it to steady it. she leans down, whispers to him.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{don't. say. a word.}
<A>__{he nods. meg takes a breath, walks across the foyer, tousling her hair as she goes. in the panic room, raoul is staring at the monitors, aghast.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{holy shit... holy shit...}
<A>__{burnham races over, looks over his shoulder. one monitor covers the front stoop, and on that monitor they can clearly see two uniformed cops.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{she's fuckin' crazy, she killed the kid! she just killed her own kid!}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{it's not her fault, it's not her fault, the guy must have called them. look, look, look, she's telling us.}
<A>__{he points to another monitor, the one in the foyer, where meg is looking up at the camera, miming to them don't worry, i will take care of this.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{she's gonna handle it.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{she better.}
