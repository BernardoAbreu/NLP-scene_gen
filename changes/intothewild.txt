He wasn't anti-social, he always had friends, and everybody liked him - but he could go off and entertain himself for hours, he didn't seem to need toys or friends. He could be alone without being lonely. The secrets our parents kept, though unknown to Chris and I, led to bouts of rage and even violence between them that we had been forced to witness since we were very young. It seemed like they never fought without us. I remember the first family meeting to let Chris and me in on their plans for getting a divorce. They wanted us to choose which of them we'd live with. I cried my eyes out. But the divorce never happened, though the threats and meetings never stopped. It wasn't long before Chris and I shut off -- we would tell mom and dad to go ahead and get the divorce. Chris and I just wanted to get away from their fights and mom kept promising to get out and take us with her as soon as their company made enough money. Dad had been the young genius [that] NASA enlisted to do [crucial] designs for the American satellite radar systems that would be our answer to the Russian Sputnik. And mom and he later started up a consulting firm combining her get-up- and-go resourcefulness with his wealth of knowledge. By the time the company actually made its first million, the careerism and money seemed to erase her memory of the promise she'd made us. CARINE (V.O.)

<ACTION_ALT>__{CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON MCCANDLESS.}
<ACTION>__{We move from the page back up to Chris. We see that he has put on his eyeglasses to strengthen the vision of his weakening sight. He removes them, folds them, and lays them by his side. His body begins to tremble. His eyes dance wildly. The drumming intensifies. Chris takes one last look out the window. The sun is covered by a well-defined and puffy cloud. His arm nearing spasm reaches up to the bunk, grasping at the blue sleeping bag made by his mother. With great suffering and shattering trembles, he forces his body to defy its agony and pushes it into the sleeping bag. SKYWARD, the cloud obscuring the sun. Drumbeats ESCALATE - BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! We TIGHTEN on Chris' anguished face. (Director's note: These CU's on Chris' face, combine both static and hand-held CUs, upside down and right-side up moving, zooms, and push-ins. Straight, side, and dutch angles. Perhaps some intermittent distortion.)}

<ACTION>__{We INTERCUT : between Chris and the sky in a dance transitioning to the next world. It is hopeful, anguished, sad, and elated.}
<LOC>__{INT./EXT. ANNANDALE HOUSE - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Chris, approaching the Annandale house.    His backpack on and body healthy. Billie parts the curtains, ecstatic to see Chris approach, alive and healthy. We SEE but do not hear her call to Walt. A smiling Chris steps up the curb, approaching home. Walt and Billie - we PUSH INTO them as they gleefully run out the front door to their returning son. PUSH INTO Chris - he dispatches his backpack to the ground and runs toward his parents' embrace.}

<DIAL>__{What if you saw me running into your arms...}
<ACTION>__{Chris, Walt, and Billie on the cusp of a jubilant and loving embrace!}
<DIAL>__{CHRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D) Would you see then...}
<ACTION>__{The DRUMMING resumes with a BLAST OF BASS and before an embrace is possible...}
<DIAL>__{CHRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...what I see now?}
<TRANS>__{A SUDDEN CUT TO:}
<LOC>__{INT. BUS}
<ACTION_ALT>__{TOTAL SILENCE}
<ACTION>__{Chris looking at the sky, a cathartic tear falls from his left eye. Another from his right as the obscuring cloud clears the sun. Chris: The LAST, AIRY EXPULSION OF HIS BREATH. His open face as the clearing light of the sun shines in his eyes. It is a face of peace, love, a face of true, deep serenity. The eyes joyously open and the corners of his mouth ease into the subtle smile of euphoric wisdom. That's the way he settles to stillness, looking directly into our camera.}
<DIAL>__{And he died alive.}
<ACTION>__{He made it.   He lived.   He loved. Cat Stevens' Miles from Nowhere plays OVER: As we PULL AWAY from Chris' face through the bus window and up into the sky - We drift further and further away, above the stunted trees and the shimmering roof of the bus like a tiny white gleam in a wild green sea grows smaller and smaller. REPRISE IMAGE of truck driver taking picture of Chris in scene #1. Then it's him: The smiling STILL IMAGE we saw taken in the first scene from behind, but now we are seeing it from the front and it is the image of the real Christopher McCandless on the edge of the Stampede Trail. As it takes over the screen, we ZOOM SLOWLY into his smiling face. And then, these words appear superimposed over it: Dedicated to the memory of Christopher Johnson McCandless February 12, 1968 - August 18th, 1992 As those words dissolve, these words appear: On September 19, 1992, Carine McCandless flew with her brother's ashes from Alaska home to the eastern seaboard. She carried them with her on the plane...in her backpack.}
