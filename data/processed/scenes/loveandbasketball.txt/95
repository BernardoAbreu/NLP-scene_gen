<L>__{interior hallway moments later}
<A>__{monica walks down the hall, shell shocked. interior wright house kitchen late day camille moves between the counter and the stove, whipping up a couple pecan pies. monica enters.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{need any help?}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{i can manage.}
<A>__{monica nods and moves to the barstool.}
<C>__{camille }
<D>__{your sister's bringing the baby over. you should try to be here.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{yeah. can't wait to see him}
<P>__{(she falls silent, then)}
<D>__{i just saw quincy.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{how is he?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{engaged.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{to that stewardess?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{yeah, you met her?}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{his mother had a cookout a few weeks ago. he could do a lot better if you ask me.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{maybe she is.}
<A>__{camille looks up, studies monica for a moment.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{i thought you were over him.}
<A>__{monica shrugs.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{so what do i do?}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{find out where they're registered and send them a gift.}
<C>__{monica}
<P>__{(disgusted)}
<D>__{whatever.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{you didn't want my opinion in the first place, so why even ask?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{i asked but why does it always have to be so damn prissy.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{don't curse.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{there you go.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{what do you want me to tell you, monica, to go beat that girl up? to go have sex with him? i'm not going to do that. yes, i believe thinking of other people is important and yes i'd rather bake a pie than shoot a dumb jump shot. if that makes me too "prissy" for you, too bad.}
<A>__{monica stares at her mother. there's no going back.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{so that's why we can't get along? because i'd rather shoot a "dumb" jump shot?}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{you're the one always turning your nose up at me.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{no i don't.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{child, please. ever since you were little you thought you were too good for anything i had to say.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{i wasn't lena. i didn't care about nail polish or lip gloss or sneaking a spray of your perfume.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{what was so wrong with wanting to teach you the things i knew could help you?}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{because you're pushing me to be something i'm not.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{so you're angry with me because you're standing here with your hair combed and wearing perfume?}
<A>__{monica is busted. it takes her a moment to come back.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{i'm angry because i want a mother, not martha stewart.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{oh, yes. the superstar female athlete whose mother is nothing but a housewife.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{that's not it.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{don't tell me you aren't ashamed of that because i know.}
<A>__{monica stares at her mother.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{i remember when i was eight years old, you spent like four hours cooking up this fancy meal. all you'd let me and lena do was set the table. and i guess you and dad got your wires crossed or something because he walks in with a couple of pizzas. and you didn't say anything. you just threw the whole meal into some tupper ware and tossed it in the fridge.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{i don't remember that.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{i do. you never stood up for yourself. ever. if i was ashamed, it was because of that.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{that's ridiculous.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{what's ridiculous is not being a caterer so your husband can feel like a man knowing his woman's home cooking and ironing his drawers.}
<A>__{whap! camille's humiliation is immediate and she cuts off monica with a slap. camille curses herself for losing it.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{dammitt, monica!}
<A>__{monica is stunned, hurt.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{camille stares at her daughter, devastated.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{is that really all you think of me?}
<A>__{monica can't answer.}
<C>__{camille }
<D>__{when i married your father, all i wanted was a nice house with a big kitchen so i could start my catering business. and then i got pregnant with lena, and then i got pregnant with you. and i put it out of my mind because that's what you did.}
<A>__{monica stares at her mother.}
<C>__{camille }
<D>__{but you want to know what day i remember? in high school, you getting ready for the spring dance. i put my pearls around your neck, told you you were beautiful and you looked like you were going to cry. that day i was happy i didn't have a catering business to run off to. my family had three meals a day, had someone to pick up after them, and when my daughters went to a dance, i helped them get ready. that's what i came to care about.}
<C>__{monica}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{that's all you cared about. i must have played in a thousand games and i can only remember you being to two.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{you had your coaches and your father for that stuff. it never mattered one way or the other if i went to your games.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{it mattered, mom.}
<A>__{camille looks at her daughter and is struck by the need in her eyes. monica moves off the barstool and leaves. interior wright house monica's room day the room looks exactly the same. trophies, medals, plaques. basketball posters and her "strong women" wall. monica sits on her bed, staring up at a photo of her and quincy, tacked up to her bulletin board, amid other photos of her childhood. they are eighteen, playfully wrestling over a}
