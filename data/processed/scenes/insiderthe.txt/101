<L>__{interior richard scruggs' kitchen 7:00 a.m.}
<A>__{jeffrey is sitting with scruggs and motley in scruggs' kitchen around a semi circular counter. coffee and sweet rolls. it's casual. no one's dressed for court. scruggs has been looking through the sheaf of subpoenas. about motley, we sense power held in reserve.}
<C>__{richard scruggs}
<D>__{now, what this one is, is a temporary restraining order, a gag order, issued by a kentucky court.}
<A>__{meanwhile, a movie star handsome man in shirtsleeves and a tie, a coffee cup in his hand, enters and sits casually on the arm of a chair.}
<C>__{richard scruggs }
<P>__{(introducing)}
<D>__{jeff wigand, michael moore.}
<C>__{michael moore}
<D>__{good to meet you, dr. wigand.}
<C>__{richard scruggs}
<D>__{mike's our attorney general down here.}
<P>__{(to moore)}
<D>__{i was just explaining to jeff, they got a kentucky court to issue a gag order to stop his deposition today.}
<C>__{michael moore}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{richard scruggs}
<D>__{now, they tried to get the mississippi court to honor it, but the judge threw it out...}
<P>__{(to jeffrey)}
<D>__{however, for you, there is a more perilous effect to the kentucky gag order...}
<C>__{michael moore}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{dr. wigand, you do understand what could happen, don't you?}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{i'm not free to testify...here...?}
<C>__{motley}
<D>__{that's right. if you violate the kentucky order, when you step foot back in kentucky, they can find you in contempt and they can incarcerate you. and you ought to know that.}
<A>__{and jeffrey fairly turns white, it's never occurred to him he might go to jail...}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{jail?}
<C>__{richard scruggs}
<D>__{possibly, yes. that is one of the possible consequences of your testifying here today. that's right...}
<C>__{wigand}
<D>__{how does one..."go...to...jail?" what does my family do? go on welfare? if my wife has to work? who's going to look after the kids? put food on the table? my children need me. if i'm not teaching...there's no medical...no medical...even on co pay, that's like... tuition...}
<C>__{michael moore}
<D>__{dr. wigand, listen, you may not be able to do this thing. as i understand from dick, you're our key witness. and, i hope you don't withdraw. i guess we'd all understand if you did...}
<P>__{(at watch)}
<D>__{guys, i've got to go. i'm gonna be late for court. i will see y'all a little later. dr. wigand, good luck.}
<A>__{he leaves. and jeffrey's quiet, frightened. having shaken the departing moore's hand, he now turns away from scruggs and motley, thinking about consequences.}
<C>__{richard scruggs}
<D>__{i know what you're facing, jeff. and, i think i know how you're feeling...}
<A>__{jeffrey's skeptical anybody could know "how it is"...}
<C>__{richard scruggs }
<P>__{(low, personal)}
<D>__{in the navy i flew a 6's off carriers... in combat, events have a duration of seconds, sometimes minutes... but what you're going through goes on day in and day out. whether you're ready for it or not, week in, week out... month after month after month. whether you're up or whether you're down. you're assaulted psychologically. you're assaulted financially, which is its own special kind of violence. because it's directed at your kids...what school can you afford... how will that affect their lives. you're asking yourself: will that limit what they may become? you feel your whole family's future's compromised...held hostage...}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{i do}
<A>__{know how it is.}
