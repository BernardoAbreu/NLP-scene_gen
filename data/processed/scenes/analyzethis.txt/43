<D>__{in my business i deal with animals. they may seem dumb to an educated guy like you, but make no mistake about it, doctor, animals are very cunning. and they sense weakness. right now i'm an injured animal. it's only a matter of time before one of the lions out there catches the scent. then i'm dead. that's the way it is. if you don't understand that, then you don't understand the life i live and you don't understand me.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{i have until the end of the week to get strong or they're gonna eat me up. if they don't kill me in the meantime.}

<D>__{what happens next week?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{i can't tell you and you don't want to know.}
<C>__{ben}

<D>__{mr. vitti, when i got into family therapy, this was not the family i had in mind. i'm turning you down.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{you with your schmucky little office in your schmucky little house out there in schmuckville you're turning me down? what, so you can spend more time listening to housewives piss and moan about how nobody fucks them right?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'd like to go now.}
<C>__{vitti}
<P>__{(starts to cry)}
<D>__{you see this? this is what i'm talking about! i'm a dead man!}
<A>__{ben turns away and starts for the door.}
<C>__{vitti}
<P>__{(through the tears)}
<D>__{you call yourself a doctor? you should be ashamed. a real doctor couldn't turn his back on a person who's suffering!}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{all right.}
<P>__{(hands him a handkerchief)}
<D>__{what happened with your wife tonight?}
<C>__{vitti}
<P>__{(wiping away his tears)}
<D>__{i wasn't with my wife. i was with my girlfriend.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you have a girlfriend? we could do two months on that alone.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{what, you're gonna start moralizing with me now?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{okay. do you have marriage problems?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{then why do you have a girlfriend?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{i do things with her i can't do with my wife.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{why can't you do those things with your wife?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{hey. that's the mouth she kisses my children good night with. what's the matter with you?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{okay, okay. have you been under a lot of stress lately?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{you mean like seeing your best friend murdered? yeah, i got stress.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well, based on what you told me before about your attacks, i'd say that's probably it then.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{it's just stress?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i doubt if there's anything physically wrong with you.}
<C>__{vitti}
<P>__{(brightening, pointing a finger at ben)}
<D>__{you. you. you're very good.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{there's a lot more to it }
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{no, you're right. you're right on the money. i can feel the juices rushing back to my manhood as we speak.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{well, i didn't need to know that.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{this settles it. you're my shrink.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i can't treat you, mr. vitti. i don't think you're really ready to open up and deal with }
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{listen to you. the honesty. nobody and i mean nobody talks to me like this. i'm ready. let's do it.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you don't hear the word 'no' that often, do you?}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{i hear it all the time. only it's more like, 'no, no, please, no!'}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(relenting)}
<D>__{all right. i'm here for two more days. when we get back to new york, i will treat you exclusively for two weeks. i just need to figure out what to tell my other patients.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{you want me to clear your schedule for you?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no thanks, i will handle it. now can i go?}
<A>__{vitti throws his arms around him and kisses him on both cheeks. a look of concern crosses ben's face.}
<C>__{vitti}
<D>__{thank you.}
