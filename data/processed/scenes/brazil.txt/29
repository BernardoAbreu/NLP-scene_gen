<L>__{interior ministry of information lobby day}
<A>__{this is a gigantic, vaguely 30's monumental style building. the lobby is a vast impressive space containing reception desks, fountains, statues etc. prominent are the security measures, which include automatic mobile cameras, video screens and groups of security men who search all who enter. sam is finishing going through security when he meets jack who is on his way out of the building.}

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{long time no see!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{well, since you disappeared up the ladder of information retrieval ... i don't expect to see you slumming in records what's the problem?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{problem? no problem yes, everything's going fantastically well, wonderful, marvelous, great career prospects, alison in great shape, kids fine, beautiful home, i'm on security level five now, and mr helpmann relies on me more and more, yes, couldn't be better, i feel terrifically motivated and job rewarded }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you sound worried.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{me? if i'm worried about anyone, it's you. what happened to you, sam? you were the brightest of us }
<A>__{as they have been talking, a nearby bank of closed circuit tv screens has been displaying shots of people entering the lobby. as each one enters the camera zooms in tight on their faces for a frozen close up. jill has just entered and the camera zooms in and freezes on her face. sam happens to glance up at this moment. he is startled the over exposed tv image is the face of the girl from the dream. the face is only there a few seconds before being replaced by another picture. sam looks about to see where the girl is, but jill, in overalls, has her back to him as she stands in the queue for the information desk and so there is no one even vaguely reminiscent of the dream girl. sam decides he must have imagined it. over this jack has been talking.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{sorry. nothing.}
<P>__{(snapping out of it)}
<D>__{see you i'm going to be late.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(looking at his watch)}
<D>__{you are late.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{even later.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{sam, your life is going wrong let your friends tell you records is a dead end department, no security level worth a damn, it's impossible to get noticed }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yes, i know, fantastic, marvellous, wonderful remember me to alison and the er twins.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{triplets.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{really? god, how time flies!}
<A>__{as sam heads off to the lift, he passes a group of men standing around a temporary tv monitor. several of them are dressed in white lab coats. they are being explained the benefits of a new surveillance system by a salesman type. his assistant is operating the controls. on the monitor we can see jill standing in the queue for the information desk. the camera appears to he tracking in on her.}
