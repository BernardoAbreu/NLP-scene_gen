<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{a push sweeper, sweeping the carpet. angle on: old woman slowly sweeping. we follow her back to: enid, rebecca & josh. they're now eating: ten minutes have passed, it's 12:45.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{so josh... becky and i are trying to figure out what makes you tick. tell us about your political beliefs.}
<A>__{rebecca laughs.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{yeah, right.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{no, i'm serious. give us your whole basic philosophy in a nutshell.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{oh my god, look, that's got to be him!}
<A>__{a guy enters.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{is he wearing a green cardigan?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{what exactly is a cardigan anyway?}
<A>__{the guy joins a friend.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{that's not him... jesus, stop freaking me out.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{in answer to your question, i suppose i endorse policies that are opposed to stupidity and violence and cruelty in any form...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i figured something like that...}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{oh my god!}
<A>__{they see a somewhat funny looking guy in his late 30's, wearing a green cardigan, seymour, enter. enid and rebecca hunch down in their seats.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{it's obviously him!}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i can't believe it!}
<A>__{seymour sits down and looks around. weird al brings a menu. another angle on: weird al bringing his milkshake. ten more minutes have passed, it's 12:55.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{what's going on now? what's he doing?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{oh my god, he just ordered a giant glass of milk!}
<C>__{josh}
<P>__{(bursting her bubble)}
<D>__{it's a vanilla milkshake.}
<A>__{fifteen more minutes have passed it's 1:10 pm. seymour looks around, still hopeful. his date is now ten minutes}
<B>__{late.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{what's he doing now?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{he's still just sitting there. god, this is totally unbearable!}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{i agree.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i wish i could see him.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{go ahead and look, but don't make it too obvious...}
<A>__{rebecca turns around and pretends to look past seymour. it's now 1:30 pm. his date is 30 minutes late. seymour gets up and walks sadly towards the cashier (weird al).}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{do you think he knows?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i dunno...}
<A>__{they watch him leave. enid goes up to pay the bill while josh and rebecca go outside.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{hey weird al, did that guy say anything to you before he left?}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{not a thing.}
<A>__{enid goes back to the table to leave a tip, two dollars. al passes behind her.}
<C>__{al}
<P>__{(cheerfully}
<D>__{professional despite}
<P>__{her abuse)}
<D>__{thank you and come again.}
<A>__{enid hesitates, overcome with guilt. she glances back at al, then digs every penny out of her pocket (about seven dollars in coins and wadded up bills) and adds it to his tip.}
