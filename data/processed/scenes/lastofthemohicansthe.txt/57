<A>__{exhausted, sitting on a low stool, taking a breath.}
<C>__{hawkeye }
<D>__{she know what she's doin'?}
<A>__{phelps looks up, then he looks over his shoulder at cora. she's in a borrowed launderess dress blouse ... she looks different. he's a little indignant.}
<C>__{phelps}
<D>__{first assisted me in austria when she was fourteen. i would say she does ...}
<A>__{her apron is stained. hawkeye sees this may be her first time in the new world, but it's not her first military campaign. still angered at munro's dismissive response, he's nevertheless falling for cora.}
<C>__{hawkeye}
<D>__{she does not shy away from much ...}
<C>__{phelps}
<P>__{(elsewhere)}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{hawkeye}
<D>__{nothin'.}
<A>__{alice munro has caught hawkeye's attention. outside the surgery where a casement meets a wall, she sits, withdrawn. a catatonic older woman in a fine dress sits next to her.}
<C>__{phelps }
<D>__{miss cora? gentleman looking for you.}
<B>__{hawkeye}
<A>__{enters. cora's sewing up uncas.}

<D>__{mr poe?}
<C>__{hawkeye}
<D>__{miss.}
<P>__{(re: cotton)}
<D>__{may i?}
<A>__{cora, curious, nods. hawkeye cuts some pieces from her ruined and discarded dress that she now uses to bandage uncas. we don't know why; neither does cora.}
<C>__{hawkeye}
<P>__{(to uncas)}
<D>__{you 'bout done holdin' hands with miss munro?}
<A>__{uncas laughs, looking from her to hawkeye. then he's up and he hurts. cora starts to tend another wounded man. as they start out, hawkeye hesitates. sensing it, cora turns.}
<C>__{cora}
<D>__{what are you looking at, mr. poe?}
<C>__{hawkeye}
<D>__{why, i am looking at you, miss.}
<A>__{cora measures the directness of hawkeye's manner. it's not insolent, only unsettling. feeling foolish; she turns. he leaves.}
