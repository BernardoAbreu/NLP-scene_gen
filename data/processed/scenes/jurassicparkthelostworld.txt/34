<L>__{exterior jungle trail day}
<A>__{suddenly, the gathereres are taking their expedition a lot more seriously. they march quickly back to base camp, their energy and excitement palpable. nick strikes a match and raises it to a cigarette with a shaking hand, but sarah leans in and blows it out.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{no more smoking. we leave no scent of any kind. no hair tonics, no cologne, seal all our food in plastic bags. we will observe and document, but we will not interact.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{that's a scientific impossibility, you know. heisenberg uncertainty principle. whatever you study, you also change.}
<A>__{nick ejects the used videotape from his camera and pulls out a sharpie, to label it.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what should i call this? "jurassic pork?"}
<A>__{eddie, next to him, laughs.}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(still to malcolm)}
<D>__{and let's forget about the high hide. we can't do this kind of work up in a tower, we need to be out in the field, as close to the animals as possible.}
<C>__{juttson}
<D>__{i'm not surprised stegosaur lived in a family group, but there's never been anything in the fossil record to prove the carnivores did.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{why wouldn't they? look at hyenas, jackals, nearly all species of predator birds }
<C>__{juttson}
<D>__{that doesn't say a thing about t rex, they could have been rogues. robert burke certainly thinks they were.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{we've got to see one to find out. is there any }
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{no way.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{oh, my god.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{ way we could safely }
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{oh, no!}
<A>__{he takes off, running as fast as he can, down the trail, toward base camp. they look ahead, in the direction nick is running. a plume of black smoke is rising up over the trees.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{fire!}
