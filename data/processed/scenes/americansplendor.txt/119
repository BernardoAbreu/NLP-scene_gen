<L>__{exterior parking lot v.a. hospital 1980's day}
<A>__{harvey approaches the building. instead of dragging his feet like usual, he seems to be floating on a cloud. we haven't seen harvey this happy since... well, since never. he stops by a junker car and peeks in the window, finding toby eating lunch alone. he has an entire white castle smorgasbord spread across the front seat. harvey knocks on the window. toby rolls it down.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{ay toby.}
<C>__{toby}
<P>__{(mouth full)}
<D>__{no you can't have any of my white castle hamburgers so please don't even ask.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{can i have a fry?}
<A>__{harvey reaches for a handful of toby's fries.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{okay, but just a couple, harvey. i'm not going to eat dinner until very late and this has got to hold me over.}
<A>__{harvey leans in, always amused by toby. he steals another fry.}
<C>__{harvey}
<P>__{(munching)}
<D>__{whattya got, a church function?}
<C>__{toby}

<D>__{nah. i gotta fly to delaware tonight. i'm gettin' married.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{oh. why delaware?}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{the chick i'm marryin' is from wilmington. plus, i gotta help her move her stuff here.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{why you drivin' ta toledo to see a movie?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{it's not playing at the mapletown.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i didn't know you had a girlfriend, harvey.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{yeah. we met last week.}
<A>__{harvey opens the car door and slides in with toby.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{toby, what movie could possibly be worth drivin' 260 miles round trip for?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{it's a new film called "revenge of the nerds." it's about a group of nerd college students who are being picked on all the time by the jocks, so they decide to take revenge. i already saw it once.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{wow, ya really dig this movie.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i like it a lot, harvey.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{what are these nerds like? how would you describe them?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{hmm... nerds are smart but they look and act differently than other people. like nerds might wear polyester button down shirts and flood pants where their ankles and their socks are showing.}
<A>__{toby spills some catsup on his polyester button down shirt. he stands up to get a napkin, revealing his flood pants.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{so what yer sayin' is you identify with those nerds?}
<C>__{toby}
<P>__{(rubbing out the catsup)}
<D>__{yes, i consider myself a nerd. and this movie has uplifted me. there's this one scene where a nerd grabs the microphone during a pep rally and announces that he is a nerd and that he is proud of it and stands up for the rights of other nerds. then, he asks the kids at the pep rally who think they are nerds to come forward... so nearly everyone in the place does. that's the way the movie ends.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{so the nerds won, huh?}
<C>__{toby}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{harvey grabs the rest of toby's fries and opens the door to leave.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{wow. you got this movie an' i'm gettin' hitched. we both had a good month, huh?}
<C>__{toby}
<P>__{(finishing his last burger)}
<D>__{right. harvey, how long are you going to be in delaware because i'd really like to see this movie with you?}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{i'm only goin' for a week but then i will have a wife, so i will have to take her along. is it a girl flick?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{depends on the girl. what kind of girl is your new bride? is she a nerd?}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{i don't know, man. maybe. she's into herbal teas.}
<A>__{toby watches harvey saunter off. he returns to his last hamburger.}
