<L>__{exterior trans siberian restaurant day}
<D>__{anna emerges into the daylight. as she does she sees that four expensive looking cars have already parked and various ostentatiously dressed russian and turkish couples with their children are emerging from their cars. the women are all wearing furs, even the little girls. the men wear leather or dark suits. they greet each other exuberantly as they emerge from their cars. anna suddenly feels slightly uneasy. as she approaches her motorbike she sees nikolai leaning against the bonnet of his car, smoking, still wearing shades. his bumper is almost touching anna's bike.}

<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{nice bike.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{a ural. you don't see them anymore.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it was my dad's.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{how much do you want for it? anna has already taken a dislike to this man. he is arrogant and looks potentially violent. his shades, suit and tattoos say it all.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{it has sentimental value. nikolai rolls the concept around in his mind and considers.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{`sentimental value'. i've heard of that. anna puts her helmet on.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{you're not staying for the party?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{nor me. chauffeurs don't get invited. you want to go for a drink instead? anna mounts her bike.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it's christmas. everything's closed. nikolai smiles.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{sometimes if things are closed you just open them up, you know? anna now feels intimidated and luckily the bike fires first time. she rides away. nikolai watches her go and then stubs his cigarette.}
