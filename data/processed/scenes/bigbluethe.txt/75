<L>__{exterior marineland taormina day}
<A>__{jacques and johana enter the dolphinarium. johana is wearing an old pair of jacques shorts along with an oversized t shirt and rolled up sweater. she seems quite pleased with her new attire. jacques and johana walk straight through marineland and head toward the dolphin pool. it's pretty crowded, mostly kids. the dolphins are lying motionless at the bottom of the pool. the trainer is tired of throwing fish in the pool and getting absolutely no reaction.}

<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{trainer}
<D>__{i don't understand. we've tried for two days. they won't eat. they won't perform. it's since we got the new one.}
<B>__{close on dolphin}
<A>__{surfacing. it thrusts its head over the edge of the pool, looks to jacques and speaks.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{is she the new one?}
<A>__{surprised, the trainer nods. johana looks over at jacques then at the dolphin. she doesn't understand.}
<C>__{johana}
<D>__{how can you tell it's a female?}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{... the way she moves.}
<A>__{three other dolphins gather around the one that jacques is patting. jacques is staring at the female dolphin. it looks like the animal is trying to tell him something. suddenly the dolphin grabs him by the sleeve and pulls him into the pool. underwater dolphin pool jacques hangs onto the dolphin's muzzle. let's it pull him along. the dolphin swims to a far corner of the pool, and pulls jacques to the bottom. the other dolphins circle above.}
