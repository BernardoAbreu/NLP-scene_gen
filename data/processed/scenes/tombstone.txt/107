<L>__{ext hooker's ranch late day}
<A>__{the 3rd cowboy rides up to the ranch house, dumps a large something in front, and gallops back to just within earshot as wyatt and his men run up. the object is a human corpse and though we can't see what was done to it, the expressions on their faces are plain enough.}

<D>__{why couldn't they've jus killed him? 3rd cowboy}
<P>__{(shouts)}
<D>__{ringo wanted to be sure he got your attention, marshal. he wants a straight up fight, just you and him, settle this thing once and for all. you win, we quit the territory; ringo wins, your deputies get safe conduct to the colorado line. sundown today in the oak grove at the mouth of sulphur springs canyon. ride out with your escort, we'll meet you.}
