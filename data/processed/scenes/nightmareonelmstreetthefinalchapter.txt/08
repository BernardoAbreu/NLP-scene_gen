<L>__{exterior highway day}
<A>__{jacob's eyes snap open so fast his sockets suffer whiplash. he's lying smack in the middle of the road tucked in a fetal position. jacob slowly uncurls his body and sits up. he shivers and wipes his sweaty forehead and that's when he notices something in his hand. insert: jacob's hand it's a bracelet, a simple band of gold with a larger plate in the middle, like an id band. jacob's fingers turn the plate over. printed on the other side is the name of the bracelet's former owner: alice. jacob has a souvenir.}
<B>__{back to jacob}
<A>__{he raises his face and looks at the road in front of him. it goes off into the distance surrounded on both sides by empty fields. this is where springwood used to be. a look of anguish crosses jacob's face as he stares at the desolation.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{mom...}
<A>__{honk! screech! jacob whips his head around in time to see a huge moving van blasting right at him. he rolls off to the side of the road. the truck barely misses him, kicking up a cloud of dust in its wake. jacob chokes on the dust. he slowly recovers and looks back down at the bracelet in his hand. he clenches his fist around it as a wild eyed angry look starts to grow on him. he takes a few deep breaths, then stands up and walks out of frame.}
<B>__{angle down the highway}
<A>__{we can see a pickup truck in the distance. jacob's hand enters frame, thumb sticking out, his mother's bracelet dangling from his wrist. the pickup truck starts to slow down.}
