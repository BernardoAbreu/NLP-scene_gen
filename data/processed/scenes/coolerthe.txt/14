<L>__{interior shelly's office a short while later night}
<A>__{shelly seated across from nicky, larry and marty.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{so... what brings you to town, nicky?}
<A>__{nicky looks cautiously across the table.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{look, shelly, this is your joint, you run it the way you see fit. but we got a smart kid here and he's got some good ideas on how to revitalize the shangri la.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{revitalize? what are you talking about? we did thirty five million last year.}
<A>__{nicky shoots a look over at larry and marty. larry takes this as his cue.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{first off, shelly, i want you to know, i have nothing but respect for you. you've done a fantastic job with the shangri la for the last sixteen years. no one would dispute that.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{yeah, no one doubts that, shelly.}
<A>__{shelly nods carefully. but...}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{but, the business has changed out here. you just have to take a look at the strip to see what i'm talking about.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{you mean, that amusement park mook fest out there? you know what that is? that's a fucking violation of something that used to be beautiful. that used to have class. like a gorgeous high priced hooker with an exclusive clientele. and then that steve wynn cocksucker knocks her up and puts her in a family way.}
<A>__{nicky and larry exchange looks. marty drops his gaze into his lap.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{now she's nothing but a cheap, fat whore hiding behind too much makeup. i look at her and see all those ugly stretch marks and i want to cry. 'cause i remember her as she was.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{yes, well... there's no denying the bottom line. those eyesores are raking it in. and we can't compete against that.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{what? you think i'm trying to compete with that? you think this joint's about bringing in the stroller crowd? fresh off some fucking e ticket ride, looking to break the house on red and black. fremont's never been about that bullshit. this is where old time and real money comes to play.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{the numbers, they don't back you up, shelly. nostalgia's grand. we all love nostalgia but it belongs in a museum. i think it's time to decide whether you're running a museum or a casino.}
<A>__{shelly is close to losing it. he catches himself, takes a breath.}
<C>__{nicky}
<D>__{hey, forget about it. we'll talk later. over dinner.}
<C>__{marty}
<P>__{(rubs his hands together)}
<D>__{so, how's the action?}
<A>__{larry shoots him a disapproving look. off shelly's disturbed expression. he's already calculating serious damage control.}
