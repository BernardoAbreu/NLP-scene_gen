<L>__{exterior cloudy sky germany day}
<A>__{dark clouds passing overhead. the bad weather that has hovered over the eifel mountains, (in germany), the past three days is on it's way out.. an eye flickers wide open staring intently a pupil dilates and contracts in the light. the eye stares. blinks. thinks. making evaluations..}
<L>__{exterior cloudy sky germany day}
<A>__{the first rays of sunshine break through. the voices of international tv commentators in different languages.}
<C>__{commentators}
<D>__{...in places the track is still dangerously wet, but following a drivers meeting the decision has been taken. the race is going ahead...}
<L>__{interior ferrari day}
<A>__{the eye belongs to a 27 year old formula 1 racing driver wearing a fireproof balaclava... highly intelligent, he also happens to be world champion. his name is painted on the side of his ferrari. niki lauda.}
<P>__{niki (v o)}
<D>__{my grandfather always said history is cruel and reductive and no matter how long we live, or how much we achieve we are remembered for very little. so make sure it's the right things.}
<A>__{niki stares up at the clouds. his eyelids flicker. thinking. agonizing. wrestling with an all important decision... is it going to carry on raining? or become dry? should he be using slicks or wets?}
<L>__{exterior starting grid day}
<A>__{we widen to find ourselves on the starting grid of a major grand prix. all around us... engines scream into life as drivers start their cars. an official walks through the cars holding aloft a sign, "one minute"... deafening, angry thunder as engines rev impatiently.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{this is bullshit. we have no control over our legacy. we cannot choose what we are remembered for...}
<A>__{a ferrari mechanic rushes towards niki, and shouts in italian above the noise, (we see sub titles)...}
<C>__{mechanic}
<D>__{mass usa slicks. le vuoi cambiare anche tu?}
<P>__{(mass is going on slicks. you want to change?)}
<A>__{niki looks in his wing mirror back to see a red mclaren, white helmet, number 12, several rows behind him. a team of mechanics hastily changing the tyres to dry tyres.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{otherwise i wouldn't be remembered for my rivalry with this asshole. and the 1976 season.}
<A>__{niki then looks over at the car in pole position beside him. another mclaren, but with number 11, and a union jack...}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{what about hunt? has he changed?}
<C>__{mechanic}
<D>__{no, he's going on wets.}
<A>__{the car in pole position: james hunt, surrounded by tv crews, mechanics, girlfriends, hangers on.. the maclaren team is less than half the size of ferrari's, but hunt makes up for this with magnetism. the rock star of f1. niki's face: a stab of envy seeing a flash of his rival's glamorous long blonde hair disappearing into his balaclava, flirting with several hot looking girls..}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{i don't know why it became such a big thing. we were just drivers. busting each other's balls. to me this is perfectly normal. but other people saw it differently.}
<C>__{niki }
<D>__{that whatever it was between us went deeper. and changed us both somehow. forever.}
<A>__{niki stares, then...}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{be, allora usiamo anche noi quells da bagnato.}
<P>__{(then we go on wets, too.)}
<A>__{the ten second board is held up. niki pulls down his visor...as he and hunt's eyes meet for a split second, eyes staring... niki selects second gear for the wet track and revs the engine. the dashboard needle climbs through 8000, 9000, 10000}
<B>__{rpm.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{maybe that explains the state of mind i was in. and why it happened. the other thing i'm remembered for.}

<D>__{on august 1st, that same year...}
<A>__{caption: "august 1st, 1976". the starter waves the flag. niki's foot hits the floor his engine screams that deafening, stomach rearranging high pitch scream, drowning out the roar of the 180,000 crowd. niki's car is catapaulted forward violently, the wheel spin leaving livid black scars on the asphalt.. niki gets away first. a good start! but within seconds there's a mclaren car right behind him, breathing down his neck. his arch rival. hunt. but as the mclaren roars past, niki sees a white helmet. number 12. it's not hunt. it's mass. on his bald, slick tyres. niki curses under his breath. he screwed up. made the wrong decision. should have gone on slicks. he urgently needs to change tyres... niki swerves angrily into the pits. ferrari's pit is right at one end...}
<L>__{interior pits day}
<A>__{commentary from all the world's tv stations explaining the crazy, panicked situation as all the drivers come into the pits to change to dry tyres. it's chaos. a traffic jam of formula 1 cars... the ferrari team frantically work. changing niki's tyres. four men with air guns, two men with rapid duty jacks. the same italian mechanic appears, `plugs in' his headset to the car..}
<C>__{mechanic}
<D>__{hair visto? ti aveto detto di usare le slicks!}
<P>__{(see? i told you to go on slicks!!)}

<C>__{niki}
<D>__{c'mon...!!}
<A>__{niki screams at the mechanics, who are struggling. the airguns make a high pitched noise...something's not right.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{what's going on???}
<A>__{"thump", new (slick) tyres hit the tarmac, engines scream, and niki exit the pits in pursuit of hunt. but the delay has cost him dear...}

<A>__{archive tv commentary from the world's race commentators stations informs us of the positions. mass leading, hunt in 3rd, lauda in 20th...}
<L>__{interior niki's car day}
<A>__{niki gives it everything he's got. tearing through the gears, trying to catch james hunt, breaking as late as he can, engine screaming. he flies over the take off hump between pflanzgarten and swallowtail passes one car after another. into 13th place now. pulling off outrageous manoeuvres. niki's p.o.v: the world flies past in a blur. the steering wheel shakes. the car is right on the edge. cannot be driven any harder. niki approaches the streckenteil adenauer brucke section of the course...turns left at the bergwerk corner. crazy speed. and tight. too tight. a mistake... "thump", his wheels come into contact with the kerb on the inside. niki tries to counter steer, but is travelling at 155 mph. the car jerks horribly to the right.. "crunch", hits the embankment, then "bang", hits the barrier, and is thrown across the track.. fire breaks out in the engine. niki's eyes widen in horror, with another car bearing down upon him...}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{no...!}
<A>__{the oncoming car crashes head on into our car, "crash", a sickening, terrifying impact. the car explodes. seventy litres of burning high octane gasoline, with niki strapped inside, unable to undo his seatbelt. locked in a blast furnace. niki screams as the flames engulf him. 800 degrees temperature. trapped inside his car. burning smoke fills his helmet, scarring his lungs... pandemonium: commentary in different languages as panicked tv commentators helplessly describe what's happening.. niki's pov: he can just make out the barely recognizable figures of the other drivers rushing towards niki.. their hands get burnt in the flames as they try unsuccessfully to undo niki's seatbelt.. fire extinguishers blast at the car. dry powder extinguishers. covering niki's helmet. blurring his vision, as he cries out in agony, inhaling the powder.. screaming voices. panicked reactions. on the side of the car, the painted name `niki lauda' blisters and melts. then sound fades. as niki blacks out losing consciousness.}
<T>__{fade to black:}
<A>__{over this: the sound of a ringing phone...}
<L>__{interior hospital a&e unit (accident and emergency) day}
<A>__{we're in a busy hospital a&e unit. noise. crowds. a regular saturday late afternoon. the phone continues to ring.. finally, an attractive station nurse in her 20's, run off her feet, breathlessly picks up the phone.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{emergency...}
<A>__{she covers her ears, straining to hear, listening to what is being said. then her expression changes...}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{okay...standing by!}
<A>__{the nurse hangs up...then calls out to her nurse and doctor colleagues...}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{that was the race track..! there's been an accident..! a driver's been injured and is on his way in..!}
<A>__{instantly the atmosphere changes. a hive of activity as doctors and nurses prepare themselves for a major trauma... all patients with minor injuries are cleared out of the way. the nurse rings upstairs to the operating theatres and consultant surgeons, telling them to stand by... caption: "eighty eight races earlier" swing doors open, and a pair of shoeless, bare feet walks through and into the accident and emergency unit. camera tilts up a pair of long legs in white racing overalls...to reveal a tall, good looking driver, james hunt, (mid 20's), tanned, athletic, surfer long blonde hair... a man about whom a word comes to mind one would rarely use to describe an englishman. sexy. blood trickles from his nose, there is bruising to his lip and the formation (already) of a nasty black eye, but make no mistake. he rocks. drop dead gorgeous..}

<L>__{interior james's apartment night}
<A>__{`crash', the door flies open as james and the nurse stumble through, mid embrace, tearing at one another's clothes... the apartment is basic. cramped. messy. like that of a poor student. ashtrays filled with half smoked joints. empty beer cans. a toaster. a kettle. a stereo. a cage containing two budgerigars. a mattress on the floor. newspapers with headlines about the dockers strike, england's crumbling economy, rolls royce being bailed out by the government subtle reminders of britain in transition, leaving behind its strong, imperial past. james and the nurse stand against the wall, still half dressed, but already passionately making love...}
<P>__{james (v o)}
<D>__{i have a theory why women like racing drivers. it's not because they respect what we do...driving round and round in circles. mostly they think that's pathetic. and they're probably right..}

<P>__{james (v o)}

<D>__{do you fly?}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{you should try it. if something goes wrong up there, you're on the edge, but have to stay within the rules. stick to regulations. suppress the ego. it's good discipline for the racing.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{and there i was thinking you were about to wax lyrical about the romance of flight. i should have known better.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{what brings you here?}
<A>__{james indicates his rowdy, cool looking friends..}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{a friend's wedding. at least i think it was a wedding. might have been a birthday. all a bit of a blur. how about you? been at fiorano?}

<D>__{pre season testing.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{already? in february? you're relentless.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{i'm not sure i meant it as a compliment.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{but it is one. relentlessness is good. means you're a fighter. that you never give up. behind my back i know some of you guys call me `the rat.' because i look like one. it's meant as an insult. but i don't mind it. rats are ugly, sure. and no one likes them. but they're intelligent. with a strong survival instinct.}
<A>__{james can't help smiling. that's niki.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{so when do you start testing? next week?}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{are you mad? i didn't just win the biggest thing of my life so i could get right back to work.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{why? you need to. to prove to all the people who will always say you only won it because...}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{because what...? because of your accident? is that other people, niki? or you? i won. on the all important day when it came down to it, we raced on equal terms in equally good cars.}
<C>__{james }
<D>__{you bottled and i had the guts to see it through.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{it's true. you won that race. and believe me if i had to lose that title to anyone, i'm happy it was you. but that doesn't change the fact you have to win again.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{because that's what it means to be a winner, no? it's a permanent condition. never stops or goes away. it stays with you always.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{that's winning? sounds like losing to me. some of life needs to be for pleasure, niki. what's the use of having a million cups and medals if you never have any fun? how is that winning?}
<A>__{the plane load of james's friends call out..."c'mon, james!"}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{you're right. i could learn from you. in hospital the toughest part of my treatment was the vacuum. pumping the shit out of my lungs. it was agony. while doing it, i was watching television...you winning all those races...and i was cursing you.. "that bastard, hunt", i would shout, "i hate that guy." one day the doctor said, "mr. lauda, may i offer one piece of advice? stop thinking of it as a curse to have been given an enemy in life. it can be a blessing, too." i said, "who are you, confucius?" he said, "a wise man gets more from his enemies than a fool from his friends." and you know, he's right. look at us. we were a pair of kids when we first met. hotheaded jerks in formula 3. headed nowhere. now we're both champions of the world. not bad.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{no, not bad.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{so don't let me down now. i need you busting my balls. get back to work.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{i will, niki. but i intend to enjoy myself first. and so should you. you think you can?}
<A>__{niki stares. a blank look..}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{see you on race day, champ.}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{you will. champ.}
