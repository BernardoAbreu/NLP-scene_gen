<L>__{interior laverne's hideaway night}
<A>__{bucky sits low in his car, watching the white packard parked near the front of laverne's. he's been there awhile... finally the woman from the night before exits and heads for her car. he jumps out and walks quickly to intercept her while she's fumbling for her keys.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{slumming, miss sprague?}
<A>__{she sighs, exasperated.}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{i am now. daddy spying on me again?}
<A>__{she pulls a wad of cash out of her purse. switching to a very deft imitation of a scotchman's burr:}
<C>__{madeleine }
<D>__{maddy, girl, ye shouldn't be congregatin' in such unsuitable places }
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{i'm a policeman.}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{well that's a new one }
<A>__{she peels off another bill. hands it to bucky. he counts it out. over a hundred dollars.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{homicide.}
<A>__{he hands the money back.}
<C>__{bucky }
<D>__{let's try elizabeth short. linda martin.}
<A>__{all of her bravado drops. bucky sees it immediately. he grabs her purse and keys and tosses them on the hood of her car.}
<C>__{bucky }
<D>__{here or downtown? i know you knew her so don't jerk me off on that or it's downtown and a whole lot of publicity.}
<A>__{she opens the door to her car and slides in. bucky gets in next to her. by the roof light he can see that her similarity to the dahlia is more in her clothes and hair, but the resemblance is still there nonetheless.}
<C>__{madeleine}
<P>__{(gathering herself)}
<D>__{this is all a fluke. i met them at laverne's last fall. betty maybe one time. linda a couple. she'd come in to cadge a drink or a meal off a sister.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{you sleep with either of them?}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{no. just cocktail lounge chitchat.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{are you lez?}
<C>__{madeleine}
<P>__{(scotchman's burr)}
<D>__{ye might say i take it where i can find it, laddie.}
<A>__{bucky's charmed by her, but stays focused.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{why'd you rabbit last night?}
<C>__{madeleine}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{mister, my father is emmett sprague. the emmett sprague. he built half of hollywood and long beach, and what he didn't build he bought. imagine the headlines. "tycoon's daughter questioned in black dahlia case played footsie with dead girl at lesbian nightclub". get the picture?}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{in technicolor. (beat) what did you talk about?}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{linda talked about her boring boy back in hicktown, nebraska, or wherever. betty talked about the latest issue of screen world. hollywood dreams, the sad nine yards.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{betty ever tell you about a movie she did? show you a viewfinder? anything specific?}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{on a conversational level they were right down there with you, only they were better looking.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{you're cute.}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{you're not. look, i'm tired. you want to hear my alibi so i can end this farce and go home?}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{that's all anyone ever wants to volunteer: the alibi. go ahead.}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{my family and i were at our house in laguna from sunday through thursday along with our live in servants. if you want verification, call daddy. but be discreet about where we met.}
<A>__{she turns in the seat to face him directly.}
<C>__{madeleine }
<D>__{don't suppose i can convince you to keep my name out of the papers?}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{i don't need your cash if that's what you're saying.}
<A>__{she touches his leg.}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{ah, laddie...'s not what i'm saying...}
<A>__{he knows exactly what she's saying.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{convince me.}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{tomorrow night. eight o'clock. my address is 482 so. muirfield.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{i know the address.}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{not surprised. pick me up. like a gentleman.}
<A>__{he starts to get out of the car.}
<C>__{madeleine }
<D>__{one more thing what's your name?}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{bucky bleichert.}
<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{i will try to remember.}
<A>__{he pulls the purse off the hood and tosses her the keys. as he walks away he lets out a deep breath, as if he'd been holding it the whole time...}
