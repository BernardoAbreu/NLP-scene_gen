<L>__{interior campbell center laboratory day}
<A>__{in the darkened procedure room, miriam finds catherine standing between the two suspension devices, alone.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{catherine turns, nods, and tries to smile. has she been crying? miriam steps further into the room.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{he hates me.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{lucien baines?}
<A>__{catherine nods.}
<C>__{miriam }
<D>__{i wouldn't say "hates." dislikes, distrusts, maybe.}
<A>__{catherine laughs. exactly what miriam wanted.}
<C>__{miriam }
<D>__{she adores you.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{she thinks i can bring edward back.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{someday you can. we all believe that...}
<A>__{catherine halfheartedly nods, but her mind is elsewhere, focused on the two apparatuses.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i want to try it. please.}
<A>__{miriam knows what this is about.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{we've been over this a dozen times. no.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{why not? just once. a trial run. what harm could it do?}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{i don't want to find out.}
<A>__{ever the doctor, miriam finds herself surreptitiously examining catherine's eyes, flesh tone, a slight trembling in her fingertips.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{why is it taking so long for us to reach him? because we've been reactive, that's why. and we need to be active.}
<A>__{miriam reaches for catherine's wrist and takes her pulse.}
<C>__{catherine }
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{miriam...}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{shush.}
<A>__{as miriam examines her, catherine continues:}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{he creates the obstacles, he decides which games to play.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{i've heard this argument before. it's not happening.}
<C>__{catherine}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{it could take years for me to get past the barriers he's created.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{if we reverse the feed and bring edward into your mind, it could be devastating for him. imagine the shock of suddenly existing in a whole other world.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i do it all the time!}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{yes, but, you're a willing participant. picture edward in a strange place, lost, frightened...}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i'd be there for him.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{and he might blame you for terrifying him. that one moment could erase all you've accomplished. and if that happened, the trust he has in you is gone.}
<C>__{catherine}
<P>__{(defeated)}
<D>__{okay, okay...}
<A>__{miriam takes a penlight and examines catherine's eyes.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{besides, i don't know what it might do to you. you're already exhausted.}
<P>__{(concerned)}
<D>__{have you been sleeping?}
<A>__{catherine nods.}
<C>__{miriam }
<D>__{i can prescribe something...}
<A>__{catherine shakes her head no. miriam shuts off the penlight and looks at catherine with professional and personal concern.}
<C>__{miriam }
<D>__{you're sure? any more nightmares?}
<C>__{catherine}
<P>__{(defensively)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{good. we need you healthy and relaxed. you're going to eat well, meditate, exercise, and watch mindless television.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{yes mother.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{i don't want you up all night reading edward's case file of the nine millionth time. balance, dear girl, is the key. leave the work here.}
<A>__{she taps catherine's head.}
<C>__{miriam }
<D>__{don't bring it home in this.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{miriam gathers her belongings.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{henry wants me to try this vietnamese place he's wild about. want to come?}
<C>__{catherine}
<P>__{(declining)}
<D>__{i've got to feed my cat. besides, i want to get to bed early.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{that's my girl.}
<A>__{miriam exits, but catherine remains, still curious what could happen if things were reversed.}
