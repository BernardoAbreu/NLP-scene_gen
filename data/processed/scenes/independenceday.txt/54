<D>__{huh? oh, good, hood.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{strange thing is, if my calculations are right it'll be gone in approximately seven hours anyway. the signal reduces itself every time it recycles. eventually it will disappear. are you listening?}

<D>__{can you believe this?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what re you talking about?}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{haven't you been watching?}
<A>__{david turns for the first time to the television and sees the phenomenon. constance comes on addressing the press.}
