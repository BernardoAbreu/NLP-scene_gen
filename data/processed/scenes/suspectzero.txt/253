<A>__{mackelway watches as delia makes her way into the kitchen. it, too, is from another era: the dishwasher stands in the center of the floor, connected to the sink with a long hose. the refrigerator, the table, the toaster all old. the oven is an antique too. delia crosses to it, grabs a towel, opens it... and pulls a cake from it. she brings the cake to the kitchen table, moving well for a lady who can't see. on the table is an old fashioned baker's frosting tube. she grabs it, using her hands to orient herself... and begins to write on the cake, in frosting. slowly. mackelway can't see the top of that cake, but we can. the first letters, in beautiful cursive, read: "happy bir..." it's a work in progress.}
