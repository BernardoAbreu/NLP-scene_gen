<L>__{interior abandoned church night}
<A>__{flickering orange light from hundreds of once tall orange candles, now burnt low. they greet somerset, in the church's old candle racks, on the floor, on the altar and all through out the pews. somerset's eyes try to adjust to the light. he holds his gun ready, walks down the long center aisle.}
<C>__{john doe }
<D>__{hello, somerset.}
<A>__{doe sounds far, his voice echoing from the front of the church.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{where's david?}
<C>__{john doe }
<D>__{he's here. with me.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{tell me what you want.}
<A>__{somerset can see through the heat warp. doe stands facing him from the altar.}
<C>__{john doe}
<D>__{what do i want? the same you... i want an ending. stay where you are. put your gun on the floor and slide it all the way down here.}
<A>__{somerset obeys, bends, slides the gun down the aisle till it hits the bottom altar stair. he keeps walking, slowly.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{i want to see him. show me mills.}
<A>__{on the altar, doe is sweating hard, standing over mills. mills is slumped forward on the floor, unconscious. his bullet proof vest has been removed. mills' hands are tied tight together in front of him, tied to one end of the thick rope suspended from the ceiling. doe holds the other end of the rope, has his gun tucked under his belt.}
<C>__{john doe}
<D>__{you're an intelligent man, somerset. you understand what you're a part of, don't you? when this is finished, it will seem surreal, but it will be a whole, crystalline reality. and, no one will be able to deny it, no matter how hard they try.}
<A>__{doe's voice is thick with passion. somerset is about halfway down the aisle, still moving.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{you're a murderer. that's all. the only way you've distinguished yourself is by your particular brutality.}
<A>__{doe walks across the altar.}
<C>__{john doe}
<D>__{you know that's not true. you know.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{you're killing innocent people, and i should admire you? you're doing it because it gives you pleasure. that's the only purpose... your sick pleasure.}
<A>__{doe picks up a container of gasoline, looks out at somerset.}
<C>__{john doe}
<D>__{stay where you are!}
<A>__{somerset stops.}
<C>__{john doe }
<D>__{i won't deny my personal desires. i won't.}
<A>__{doe begins dousing mills with gasoline, covering mills' body and clothing. mills stirs, coming to. he coughs, choking on the gas and fumes.}
<C>__{john doe }
<D>__{but, i don't mourn the victims in this any more than i mourn the thousands who died in sodom and gomorrah.}
<A>__{somerset looks fearful. he starts approaching again.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{all you've done is cause more misery and pain! you've given people all the more reason to believe there is no god!}
<A>__{somerset eyes his gun at the bottom of the stairs. doe sees somerset moving, throws the gas can away, takes out his gun. doe walks to the edge of the altar, all the time holding his end of the rope.}
<C>__{john doe}
<D>__{stop!}
<A>__{somerset is twitching with anger, looking at the gun about fifteen feet in front of him. mills manages to look up, weak, his eyes barely able to open because of the stinging gasoline.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{somerset?}
<A>__{doe takes one step down off the altar. somerset is still edging forward, hands out away from his body.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{do you really think i'm just going to let this happen?! you think i'm going to let him die?}
<C>__{john doe}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{doe fires his gun and the bullet slams into the front of somerset's bullet proof vest. somerset flies back, knocking over a rack of candles on his way to the floor. doe walks quickly back onto the altar.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{motherfucker!}
<A>__{mills tries to grab at doe as he passes, but doe turns and kicks mills in the ribs. mills cringes in pain. somerset lays in the aisle, on his stomach, gasping. he can't catch his breath, his twisted face pressed against the floor.}
<C>__{john doe}
<D>__{how can you speak of god, somerset? when was the last time you spoke his name?}
<A>__{mills tries to rub the gas out of his eyes with his bound hands. his mind works feverishly. he looks around to see where he is, then he searches the floor. we can see, inside his open shirt, the bleeding, upside down cross doe has cut into his chest. doe walks back to shout angrily down at somerset.}
<C>__{john doe }
<D>__{when did you last speak his name? was it in prayer? or, did you say the lord's name after you stubbed your big toe? or, did you use his name to curse another man?}
<A>__{somerset holds his chest, blinking, trying not to black out. mills finds a piece of broken stained glass on the floor. he picks it up, palms it, still choking on gasoline. doe walks over to the statue of saint jerome emiliani, pulling the rope from above so it goes taut and mills' arms raise above his head. doe wraps the rope around emiliani's arm.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{i'm going to kill you, johnny. i'm going to see you dead.}
<A>__{doe begins twisting the loose end of the rope around the statue.}
<C>__{john doe}
<D>__{the irony, david, is that you policemen and i want the same things. but, you are so short sighted. in this city, where you can see a deadly sin on every street corner... and in every home, we want repentance.}
<A>__{mills clutches the glass piece and starts cutting the rope just above his hands.}
<C>__{john doe }
<D>__{we want good over evil. we want values instilled in the children. we want a world where a man or woman can lead a decent life.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, and fear of the lord. such simple concepts. why are they non existent?}
<A>__{somerset manages to life his head, struggles to his knees.}
<C>__{somerset}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{let him go, god damn you.}
<A>__{doe checks to make sure the rope around saint emiliani is secure, tightening the knots.}
<C>__{john doe}
<D>__{there were two men once, who had wonderful gardens. two gardens of flowers that went on as far as the eye could see. beautiful gardens... the fragrance was inspiration in itself.}
<A>__{doe stands behind emiliani, heaves against the statue. mills watches, gritting his teeth, rubbing the glass against the rope, fingers bleeding.}
<C>__{john doe }
<D>__{but, both gardens were beset by problems. weeds started to take root, and there were infestations of insects and diseases. the gardens started to turn putrid. and, one man fought to save his garden, because he could never forget how it once was. everyday he cut the weeds, and killed the insects. fought the diseases.}
<A>__{doe finally topples the statue, down the altar stairs, and the other end of the rope pulls mills upwards, screaming in pain. mills is held, about eight feet in the air, legs dangling.}
<C>__{john doe }
<D>__{that man never had a beautiful garden again.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<C>__{john doe}
<D>__{the other man plowed his garden under.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{he plowed it under the soil. he started over.}
<A>__{somerset gets to his feet, steadying himself on a pew. doe walks across the altar, picks up a long metal pole with a thick wick and candle snuffer on the end. he lights the wick from a near candle. the flame burns long and thin. he looks down at somerset, takes out his gun.}
<C>__{john doe }
<D>__{stay there, somerset. or, i will kill him right now.}
<A>__{doe holds the flaming pole up, near mills. somerset stops. he looks up at mills. mills is straining. he nods to somerset, and somerset sees mills cutting at the rope.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{alright... you don't have to do this, john. you've already made your pointerior}
<C>__{john doe}
<D>__{do you think i chose this? can you even begin to understand how painful my existence has been? it's like... like having every sense heightened beyond comprehension.}
<A>__{doe lowers the flame, standing below and beside mills, with his attention focused on somerset.}
<C>__{john doe }
<D>__{so that the stench of the street coats your throat like bile. so, sugar is so sweet it... it makes your bones ache to the marrow.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{you're insane. that's why.}
<C>__{john doe}
<P>__{(seething)}
<D>__{no! you're wrong!}
<A>__{mills continues cutting, bleeding, almost through the rope. he begins to swing his feet slightly, his body swaying.}
<C>__{john doe }
<D>__{i was chosen. and i've wished a thousand times i could have been a normal man. like david mills, a common man... with a common life. but, wishing that is my sin. i can't have it and i shouldn't.}
<A>__{doe steps towards mills.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{don't do this!}
<C>__{john doe}
<D>__{i meant what i said. i admire david mills. i envy david mills.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{envy is my sin.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{just as doe is to put the flame to mills, the rope is finally cut through. mills drops, swinging his legs forward, smashing doe in the face, knocking doe's glasses off. mills hits the floor with a thud. somerset runs forward.}
<C>__{somerset }
<D>__{david, get out!}
<A>__{doe has fallen back, dropping the metal pole. mills scrambles to his feet and charges at doe, shouting. doe squints, screaming, raises his gun. fires twice! the bullets catch mills in mid run, and carry him off his feet, backwards. somerset grips his own gun, just as mills' body falls, tumbles off the altar area and down the stairs in front of him.}
<C>__{somerset }
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{somerset lets out a scream of pain and rage that chokes in his throat. he falls to his knees and halts mills' body. somerset's shaking, unable to breathe, turning mills over and cradling his head in his arms. tears come to his eyes.}
<C>__{somerset }
<D>__{david... david? please...}
<A>__{on the altar, doe throws his gun away. he starts feeling around him, unsteady, looking for his glasses. mills' eyes are closed. he is still, bloody. he swallows. with one gasp, without a word, he is dead. somerset looks up at doe, vision blurred by rage and tears. doe stands, putting on his glasses, faces somerset. somerset lays mills' body down. stands, walks up towards the altar, raises his gun.}
<C>__{somerset }
<D>__{you.}
<A>__{doe stands, quaking, teeth clenched, fists balled up. he waits for the bullets, falls to his knees. the gun trembles in somerset's hand as somerset brings the barrel to doe's face. a millisecond's pause. somerset changes the angle of fire. blam, he blows john doe's arm to pieces in a splattering explosion. doe screams, falling back, on the altar floor.}
<B>__{viewed from far back in the church}
<A>__{the entire church with its candles frames the torture: somerset walks to where doe flops horribly, bleeding. somerset aims, shoots doe in the leg. doe screams, rolling, trying to crawl away, knocking over candle racks. somerset follows. he shoots doe's other leg. he shoots doe in the other arm. flames begin to rise and spread quickly amongst the pews. doe continues to spasm, wrenching, hand slapping the bloody floor. blam, blam, blam. somerset steps back from doe, overturns a rack of candles on top of him. he steps away. watching. flames begin rising on doe's clothing. close on john doe's face doe's face, covered in blood, twisted in agony, helpless, flames rising. he continues screaming. his glasses crack from the heat.}
