<L>__{interior clasky home master bedroom late night.}
<A>__{deborah's face is bleached from crying...the tear ducts of her now brown eyes are parched dry..evelyn sits eyeing her as she looks through the window at the pre dawn emptiness of stone canyon. in her current shape she would give pause to a staff worker at promises..a shock victim walking through the rubble after the bomb has dropped. deborah's voice is scratchy when she speaks.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{tell me again why i can't call him on the cell.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{besides that he turned it off?}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{forty messages start to look needy.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{mother, you're enjoying this.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{no..definitely not in the way you think.}
<C>__{deborah}
<P>__{(staggered)}
<D>__{you are enjoying it?!?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<P>__{(rising honest)}
<D>__{i am enjoying actually being of use to my daughter. i am enjoying the fact that i really know how to advise you and the miracle that you are so deeply disoriented that you are gobbling up everything i say.}
<A>__{deborah nods in agreement then looks at her mother in a somewhat new way..as if evelyn were an actual person instead of an upsetting extension of herself.}
<C>__{deborah}
<P>__{(vulnerable)}
<D>__{there's one thing i'd like to say to you about you and me.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{you don't have to.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{i want to.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{deborah}
<P>__{(quite vulnerable and appealing)}
<D>__{you were an alcoholic and wildly promiscuous woman during my formative years so that i am in this fix because of you. it is your fault. i just needed..}
<P>__{(gestures heart to heart)}
<D>__{..that moment for us.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{you have a solid point, dear. but right now the lessons of my life are coming in handy for you.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{there's a car coming....}
<A>__{evelyn moves to her.}
<C>__{deborah }
<D>__{it's him...he's got to tell me everything..}
<A>__{evelyn shakes her head "no."}
<C>__{deborah }
<P>__{(wild eyed)}
<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{do you know that right now you are your own worst enemy..that you can't trust one thought in your brain?}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{duh.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{then trust me and only allow yourself to say one thing to him..one thing..."i'm so glad you're back."}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{deborah}
<P>__{(babbling)}
<D>__{but i've got to know whether he touched her where he touched her how he touched her if they broke a sweat what they said who made the first move how they left it if anyone loves anyone or has an intention of making contact in the future what she wore how he felt afterwards whether anyone mentioned me..}
<P>__{(a wail)}
<D>__{..whether they held hands when they left..}
<A>__{the distinct sound of a door opening and closing from downstairs.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{just those words i said. if you want a prayer of coming out of this.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{i know you're right..but..}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{but what?}
<C>__{deborah}
<P>__{(a small voice)}
<D>__{i forgot the sentence you said i should say.}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{"i'm so glad you're back."}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{okay..do i have to wait here?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{no..he may not come up here..go to him.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{why wouldn't he come up here?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{just go.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{do i need a little makeup?}
<C>__{evelyn}
<D>__{you need a hose but you don't have the time. it's fine that you look like that. it's genuine..you can use genuine.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{thank you, mom.}
<A>__{she takes a breath exits...}
