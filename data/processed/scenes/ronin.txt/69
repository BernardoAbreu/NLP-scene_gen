<A>__{the citroen is parked among a number of other cars. sam is sleeping in the back seat, while vincent is seen on an outdoor pay phone at the other end of the parking lot. deirdre and larry sit at a nearby picnic table, eating french fast food, which we get a good look at as we pan the length of the table, which is covered with pasta, grilled sausages with dijon mustard, really good fried potatoes. in fact, everything that's on this table is so far beyond the imagination of your average american truck driver that larry can't contain himself. he's stuffing himself, washing everything down with the wine which is also sold at these road side rest stops. deirdre drinks coffee.}

<D>__{this...this is incredible. is the rest of europe like this?}
<C>__{deirdre}
<P>__{(with a laugh)}
<D>__{some places, not all. italy, for instance, they're serious about their food. but try bloody britain, anywhere in the u.k., you don't get much fancier than a deep fried bar egg. food's not our thing, you see.}

<P>__{(with unconcealed scorn)}
<D>__{budweiser? you talk to me of beer and you've the unbridled gall to mention budweiser in the same sentence? that's not beer! christ, it's not even a poor excuse for rabbit piss.}

<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{i drink what every civilized man, woman and child in the world drinks: guinness.}
<C>__{vincent }
