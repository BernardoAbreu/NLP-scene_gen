<A>__{fifteen torches have been dropped to the floor of the chamber, combining to make a good sized clear zone. smoke begins to fill the room. several canisters of oil have been lowered into this space. now, a large wooden crate is lowered slowly by rope. rope handles are attached to each end of the crate. up at the hole, indy gives sallah a reassuring pat, takes a breath, and swings carefully onto a rope hanging from the hole. despite his care, he swings a bit and his feet hit the stone pillar which is so near the entry. surprisingly, the pillar actually moves a bit, showering a light rain of crumbled stone to the floor below. indy lands on the floor of the well. he looks at the altar over a sea of undulating death. he picks up an oil canister and splashes two parallel lines of oil and lights them. a path six feet wide begins to open to the altar. behind indy, sallah comes quickly down the rope. we begin to intercut : all the action in the well from here on with insert shots of the snakes outside the flames. snakes and snakes. we see: snakes piled and entwined six inches deep; mother snakes laying snake eggs; snake eggs hatching little snakes; snakes cannibalizing other snakes.}
