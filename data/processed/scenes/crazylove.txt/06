<D>__{goodness, this is a bad one. tip your head back.}
<A>__{she bends down and pushes back chandra's head. chandra, off balance, places one very bloody hand on letty's jacket lapel, staining it for all eternity. letty, grimacing, takes the bloody hand firmly in her own and guides chandra down the hall, coaxing the child as she goes.}
