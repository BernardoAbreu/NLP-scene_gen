<A>__{the place is a mess. computer print outs, dirty dishes, unopened mail, videotapes, and notepads cover tables, chairs and floor. on the crammed bookshelves, psychology texts sit next to volumes on mythology, religion, and the occult. totems, figurines and artifacts (central and south american in origin) adorn the walls and tables. as portishead plays on the stereo, we find catherine suffering from insomnia, wearing goofy yet hip eyeglasses, sweatpants and a ucsd t shirt, sharing a late night snack with her pet cat. she shuts the refrigerator door and we linger on an odd postcard taped to the surface. a kitschy postcard of a warrior goddess.}
