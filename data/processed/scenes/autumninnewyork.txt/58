<L>__{interior wills' bedroom night}
<A>__{wills and charlotte, kissing deeply, tumble fully clothed onto the bed. as their passion builds, wills reaches for the bedside lamp. charlotte watches curiously, thoughtfully, as he pulls the cord, plunging the room into utter darkness. music up: a sequence begins savoring the last sunny days of autumn, wills and charlotte walk across the green of central park, which swarms with happy, healthy teenagers. at night, wills and john and his wife sarah sit in box seats at yankee stadium watching the play offs. bernie williams hits a colossal shot. the crowd jumps to its feet. as the ball flies over the right field wall, we see that charlotte sits next to wills, munching a hotdog, her nose buried in a book, utterly uninterested. in elysium's kitchen, wills watches on as charlotte, wearing an apron over her clothes, prepares bisque under the approving eye of the chef. she quickly and expertly pours a cup of cream and a cup of broth into a large blender. then she dumps in lobster meat and adds some saffron. just when she, with a dramatic flourish, is about to hit the start button, wills interrupts and puts the lid on the blender. one morning, charlotte sits up in bed doing the sunday new york times crossword puzzle. olivia sits on the chair next to the bed, chatting and laughing with her. wills enters, carrying a silver tray laden with breakfast. olivia looks up and gestures haughtily for him to set it down, as though he were the housekeeper. at the metropolitan museum of art, wills and charlotte wander amid the shadows of egyptian ruins.}
