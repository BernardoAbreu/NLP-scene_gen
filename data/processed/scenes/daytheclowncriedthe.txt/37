<L>__{exterior prison yard full shot day}
<A>__{there are two rows of prisoners quarters, wooden buildings, weather beaten each row consists of about a dozen barracks each... joined at the ends, farthest from the camera by the administration building, a two story type making a "u" shape of the compound... the entire yard is surrounded by two high wire fences about ten yards apart and fifteen feet high. at intervals of about twenty five yards, in the area between the fences, are the guard towers, each about eighteen feet above the ground equipped with searchlights, sirens, machine guns, with three guards on duty. along outer fence, also about twenty five yards apart, other powerful lighting equipment mounted on high poles. it is morning and although the sun shines brightly it doesn't in any way alter the drabness of the compound... nor does it help change the look of the men... there are about three hundred men milling about, some still chewing what was their breakfast, some pulling brown bread from their shirt fronts and exchanging bread for cigarettes or just making deals, one with another... some sit along the barracks walls trying to get some sun... others walking in circles... some talking, laughing, even playing cards... doing whatever they can to kill time... pan the entire camp. at completion of the long pan introducing the prison camp, we pick up the sixtyish johann keltner (formally anderlich), a warm, sensitive looking greying man, thin but with a dignity and a serenity about him... he walks briskly (and we know he'd love to walk slowly and tiredly, but we can see he knows his attitude and conduct will help those that can't help themselves...) his face tells us he is good, kind and the reason men want to live, he is special and he smiles at all those he passes, greets the men and is generally what man wishes he could be under the same circumstances... he walks into the building, which we learn is the barracks...}
