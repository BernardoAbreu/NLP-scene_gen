<L>__{8. exterior italian hill road. day.}
<A>__{a jeep pulls out of the line and approaches the red cross truck containing hana and the patient. the horn blows and hana looks out to see it contains her best friend, jan. two young soldiers sit up front, one driving, both grinning. jan signals for hana's attention.}

<C>__{hana}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{jan}
<D>__{hana, i know you do!}
<A>__{hana leans under the tarpaulin, holding some dollars. the two hands hers and jan's reach for each other as the vehicles bump along side by side. they laugh at the effort. jan's gold bracelet catches the sun and glints.}
<C>__{hana}
<D>__{i'm not sewing anything else for you!}
<C>__{jan}
<P>__{(getting the money)}
<D>__{i love you.}
<A>__{the jeep accelerates away. hana sighs to the patient. suddenly an explosion shatters the calm as the jeep runs over a mine. the jeep is thrown into the air. the convoy halts and there's chaos as soldiers run back pulling people out of the vehicles. hana runs the other way, towards the accident, until she is prevented from passing by a soldier.}
