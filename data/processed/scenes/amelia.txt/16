<A>__{he meant that. and she seems oddly touched.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{careful. i could get to like it.}
<A>__{no reaction from him. he hops into the boat. turns, holds out his hand. she hesitates. clearly doesn't need his help to jump into a boat. their eyes lock. we are watching her decide. and then... she reaches to clasp his hand. hops down beside him.}
