<L>__{interior narrow channel}
<A>__{prisoner claws his way between ancient walls, comes to a dead end against a thick wooden door. he nudges a shoulder against it, digs in and pushes. door groans open, sucking air into the pitch black chamber.}
<L>__{interior prisoner's cell}
<A>__{the tapestry covering the hole is pulled against the wall, then billows outward like a sail.}
<L>__{interior chamber prisoner}
<A>__{pulls himself inside, chokes in the heavy air. he scans the musty room. antique furniture. a few empty crates. and the remains of several deteriorating skeletons. he looks to the far wall, sees a hint of light above through the crumbling limestone. a way out. too high to reach, prisoner pulls an old chest out of a cobwebbed corner and slides it under the light. he steps up onto the chest, grabs the edges of the hole and starts to shove off when the top of the chest gives way and his foot crunches through. prisoner reaches down to free his foot when he sees something inside wrapped in a red cloth. he pulls it out and as he unwraps it, he discovers the cloth is a nazi flag. at the center is a crudely shaped iron relic. eight inches long. stains on the edges. could be the petrified tooth of some prehistoric animal. or maybe an ancient arrowhead. as he holds it, feverish sweat starts to form on his face.}
<B>__{mysterious pov}
<A>__{from behind. as if he's being watched by someone else. prisoner spins, looks back at us. nothing.}
<B>__{prisoner}
<A>__{starts toward the way out.}
