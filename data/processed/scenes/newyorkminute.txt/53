<D>__{i can't do it!}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{yes you can!}
<B>__{angle on the end of the alley}
<A>__{where roger appears with the emperor. surprised to see the girls, he backpedals, worried he'll be seen, but they're too wrapped up in their own getaway and he quietly makes his way to his van (painted on the back and sides: "michelangelo's painting: a masterpiece every time".}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{no i can't!}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{have fun in prison. under 'summer internships' on your college application, you can write 'license plate manufacturing.'}
<A>__{roger's van squeals away, drawing parker's attention. she glimpses him in his side mirror as he disappears around the corner into traffic. shutting her eyes, drew drops onto the closed lid of the dumpster.}
<C>__{drew}
<P>__{(astonished)}
<D>__{i did it.}
<A>__{oops, the curtain starts to slip. when she reaches for it she loses her balance and suddenly fwonk nosedives into the dumpster. the curtain floats into the alley at parker's feet.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{ow!}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{get out of there!}
<C>__{drew }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{give me... my... curtain.}

<C>__{morty}
<D>__{stop! bring back that dog!}
<A>__{morty's pov the girls near the end of the alley. a small dog could easily be concealed under that shower curtain. on the girls running full tilt, drew turns to parker.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{he thinks we have the dog!}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{a painter took it!}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{a pain }
<A>__{wham! drew's clotheslined at the intersection by a bike messenger who, in a valiant attempt to avoid her, brakes so hard he flies off the handlebars and lands}
<B>__{right on top of her.}
<A>__{it's dream guy from the train and for a confused beat they look into each other's familiar faces where we read recognition, love, unstated chemistry, then:}
<C>__{dream guy}
<D>__{you know, one of us is gonna get hurt if we keep doing this.}
<A>__{o.s. sirens signal that the police are now involved.}
<C>__{parker}

<A>__{parker yanks drew from underneath dream guy.}

<A>__{but parker's got her by the arm and she can only call back over her shoulder...}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{nyu!}
<A>__{... before disappearing into the crowd on the sidewalk.}
<C>__{dream guy}
<P>__{(too late)}
<D>__{me, too!}
<A>__{around the corner comes morty who, without time to react, trips headfirst over bike messenger guy.}
