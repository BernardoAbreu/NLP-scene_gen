<TRANS>__{FADE IN ON:}
<LOC>__{EXT. DESOLATE MOUNTAIN RANGE - HIGH ANGLE - DAWN}
<ACTION>__{Super: THE KHYBER PASS, AFGHANISTAN We're looking down at what used to be called "The End of the Known World." A landscape that is both beautiful, and forbidding. In the center of this vista, there is a deep ravine. Pushing in on the ravine, there appears to be a giant icicle hanging over a cliff: AN ICE FALL. A 600 foot waterfall whose face is frozen solid. Pushing in still closer, there is a tiny black dot inching its way up the ice. A human figure. This is: JAMES BOND, BRITISH SECRET SERVICE AGENT, 007. Bond is sweating and straining, four hundred feet in the air. He has an ice-pick tethered to each hand, ice-cleats on his boots. A black backpack. As he climbs, spider-like, pulling himself up, he goes to JAM A CLEAT into the ice, but - CRACK! A 50 foot stiletto of ice breaks off, CRASHING onto the rocks below. Regaining his foothold, Bond looks down: Certain death. He looks up: So very, very, far to go. Bond shakes his head:}
<CHAR>__{BOND} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{There has to be an easier way to earn a living.}
<ACTION>__{Still, Bond climbs. Huffing, sweating, he goes up, and up, until - ANOTHER ANGLE - He's 25 feet from the top. He drives a first ice pick in. Gets a toehold. But when he slams the second pick in - THE ICE WALL SHATTERS, FALLING AWAY IN FRONT OF HIM. IN THE SHOCK - BOND LOSES HIS GRIP ON THE FIRST ICE PICK - And 007 is now dangling, 575 feet in the air, staring at a torrent of water - hanging only by the leather thread around his wrist, attached to the first ice-pick, still embedded in the wall. Bond pauses. Thinks. And coolly begins to swing himself back and forth, in widening arcs, like a clock's pendulum. At the high point of his swing, Bond reaches back to smash his other pick into the ice - BUT MISSES. He looks up at: THE FIRST ICE PICK, STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL - Beginning to work its way out. The tether, fraying. RETURN ON BOND - Cautiously, 007 begins to swing a second time. Once. Twice. And on the third arc, he swings the ice-pick viciously - but MISSES AGAIN. ANGLE ON THE FIRST ICE PICK, STILL EMBEDDED IN THE WALL - Now jutting downward, barely holding. The tether is almost totally frayed through. RETURN ON BOND - One last chance. Bond swings. Once. Twice. He reaches back, hurls himself at the wall, lunging - AND SMASHES THE SECOND PICK INTO THE ICE... Just as the tether finally snaps on the first one. Still, he's all but home: He reaches over, grabs the first pick (barely holding in the ice,) jabs it in, and continues upward.}
<LOC>__{EXT. THE TOP OF THE WATER FALL -}
<ACTION>__{Exhausted, Bond reaches up, over the edge. He drives a pick down - through the ice, into the hard, flat, ground beneath the waterbed. As he pulls himself up, (his full weight on the first ice-pick,) he smashes a second pick through the ice, into the waterbed, and - THE ENTIRE ICE FALL GIVES WAY - Breaking off with a groan, tumbling onto the rocks below. IN THE WATERBED - A torrent of water crashes over 007. Fighting the oncoming deluge, he crawls - on his belly - through the water - 25 feet inland. NEW ANGLE - (TOP OF THE WATER FALL, INLAND) Bond stands, walks out of the riverbed. He looks back at the cliff: BOND'S POV - THE WATER FALL - On either side of the water, there are two small RADAR DISHES, angled down, scanning every inch of the area, save for the waterfall itself. In other words: This was the only way in. RETURN ON BOND -}
<LOC>__{007 shrugs. From his backpack, he takes out TWO CIGAR-SIZED BLACK}
<ACTION>__{CANISTERS, and an ELONGATED BLACK BOX. He presses a button on the side of the box, and - fwap, fwap, fwap - SNOW SKIS unfold. He presses buttons on the canisters: TELESCOPIC SKI POLES. Bond slaps on the skis, and takes off, through the snow.}

<ACTION>__{Bond hurtles over the side, going airborne, landing 100 feet below, amidst boulders. In perfect Olympic form, he skis out, and down.}

<ACTION>__{Bond slaloms down, in and out of trees, to avoid detection. At the bottom, where the snow thins, he comes to:}
<ACTION_ALT>__{A ROCK OUTCROPPING.}
<ACTION>__{Hiding behind the rock, Bond takes off his skis, knapsack. He unpacks (and unfolds) a HIGH TECH AUTOMATIC RIFLE. Puts on a HEADSET. He creeps up on the rock, and looks out on: A SECRET MILITARY BASE/AIR STRIP (BOND'S POV)}
<LOC>__{50 feet down, 200 yards away: 50 MEN are unloading CARGO from a dozen}
<ACTION>__{MILITARY TRANSPORT TRUCKS; there are TWO NORTH KOREAN MiG-29s on the ground (one partially obscured by a truck,) plus FLATBEDS carrying HELICOPTERS and SCUD MISSILES. Near a QUONSET HUT, a TRUCK-MOUNTED RADAR DISH scans the area, with INFRARED GATLING GUNS mounted on either side. BOND - AT THE ROCK OUTCROPPING - Props his rife on the boulder, and peers through the GUN SIGHT. THROUGH THE TELESCOPIC SIGHT - He sees a closer (but still wide) telescopic view of men bargaining over weapons, and forklifts loading/unloading crates of munitions.

Bond's chin just clears the barrel as THE GUN FIRES INTO THE CEILING. The flash momentarily blinds Thug #1. Bond snatches a CANDELABRA, and smashes it against the Thug's arm, knocking the gun away. As BOND DRAWS HIS WALTHER, the Thug grabs Bond's wrist, and brutally (yet effortlessly) SQUEEZES THE GUN from 007's hand, ONTO THE FLOOR. With a sick smile, the Thug tosses Bond into a corner of the room. He's having fun. AS BOND STAGGERS, PICKING HIMSELF UP FROM THE CORNER - THUG #1 tosses aside a massive table and chairs to get at Bond. BOND shoves a SUIT OF ARMOR (on wheels) at Thug #1 - who bats it out of the way, like a gnat. Concerned this might be getting serious, BOND grabs an OAK LEG from the shattered table. He wields it like a bat, to ward off the Thug. Unimpressed, the THUG SMASHES HIS FIST INTO a GLASS DISPLAY TABLE, and plucks out a CLAYMORE - a two-handed "King Arthur" type sword. With one roundhouse blow, THUG #1 SLICES BOND'S TABLE LEG IN TWO. The Thug swings the Claymore a second time, forcing Bond back to: A DISPLAY WALL - filled with pole weapons. Bond snatches a lethal-looking HALBERD. (Ax, fluke and spike on a staff.) Thug #1 stops in his tracks. Drops the Claymore. Grabs a pole-ax. THE TWO MEN face off in a short, furious battle, which ends with Thug #1 shattering Bond's Halberd with the pole-ax. NEW ANGLE - Gripping the pole-ax horizontally in both hands, Thug #1 forces Bond backward, to a SECOND DISPLAY WALL that features AN IRON MAIDEN. (Something like a hinged sarcophagus, lined with spikes.) Thug #1 tries to push 007 into the case, but Bond side-steps at the last minute. Thug #1 lurches forward, and is only stopped from killing himself by the pole-ax hitting the sides of the iron maiden. As Thug #1 steps back, Bond grabs a MORNING-STAR from the wall. (A studded iron ball on a chain attached to a club) Bond swings the Morning-Star down, SNAPPING THUG #1'S POLE-AX IN TWO... But loses the weapon in the process. Now, Thug #1 lunges for Bond's throat. Grappling, they slam into the wall next to the IRON MAIDEN - which is STARTING TO COME LOOSE FROM THE LEATHER STRAPS holding it upright.  - In a near death-grip, Bond manages to push/kick/smash Thug #1 backwards, down onto the floor. AND AS BOND REACHES UP FOR ANOTHER WEAPON - A HAND-AX - THUG #1 LUNGES FOR BOND'S GUN ON THE FLOOR. BOND CAN'T GET THE HAND-AX OFF THE WALL. HE TURNS TO SEE: THUG #1 ABOUT TO SHOOT HIM. And at the very last second, BOND DISLODGES THE HAND-AX, SLASHES THE IRON MAIDEN'S LEATHER RETAINING STRAPS and - NEW ANGLE - FROM INSIDE THE IRON MAIDEN'S POV - The iron maiden falls forward, impaling Thug #1 on the wooden floor.

Rushing the man, Bond struggles with him - and manages to FLIP the BALING SWITCH - literally tying the man up.
