<D>__{we woulda gotten here sooner, but we got backed up around la brea and pico.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{no hurry.}
<P>__{(to the boys)}
<D>__{all right, let's get to know one another. with the exception of eddie and myself, who you already know, you'll be using aliases. under no circumstances are you to tell one another your real name or anything else about yourself. that includes where you're from, your wife's name, where you might've done time, about a bank in st. petersburg you might've robbed. you guys don't say shit about who you are, where you been or what you've done. only thing you guys can talk about is what you're going to do. this way the only ones who know who the members of the team are are eddie and myself. and that's the way i like it. because in the unlikely event of one of you getting apprehended by the cops, not that i expect that to happen it most definitely should not happen it hasn't happened, you don't have anything to deal with. you don't know any names. you know my name, you know eddie's name. that i don't care about. you gotta prove it. i ain't worried. besides, this way you gotta trust me. i like that. i set this up and picked the men i wanted for it. none of you came to me, i approached all of you. i know you. i know your work, i know your reputation. i know you as men. except for this guy.}
<A>__{joe points a finger at freddy. freddy shits a brick.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{but he's ok. if he wasn't ok, he wouldn't be here. okay, let me introduce everybody to everybody. but once again, at the risk of being redundant, if i even think i hear somebody telling or referring to somebody by their christian name...}
<P>__{(joe searches for the right words)}
