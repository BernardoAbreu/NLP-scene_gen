<L>__{int: police station, lilly's office continuous}
<A>__{close on the enigmatic ring on silus' finger. we see lilly is seated on one side of her desk, silus on the other. lilly is staring at the ring, then she studies a photostat in front of her. there is a picture of a man, a rather perfect looking man.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{senior brother edgar... how long have you known about this?}
<A>__{silus opposite lilly, his perfect, serene appearance an anathema in the grunge of the jamestown police station. he watches her very carefully, listens to the way her finger taps the sheet in front of her, the sound of her chair swiveling, all the sounds very acute to him; she has a physical ease about her.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{a matter of weeks.}
<A>__{lilly smiles.}
<C>__{silus}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{is there something wrong?}
<A>__{lilly stops smiling. for the first time she is still.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{yes. withholding evidence. covering up two murders. and no one's worried. if me or one of the people in jamestown did that they'd be in the hell house with the key thrown away. it seems the church is able to do whatever it wants.}
<A>__{silus nods.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{you're right to not like it. it is political.}
<A>__{lilly becomes more interested at this; at the bald honesty of the statement.}
<C>__{silus}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{we thought we could find brother edgar ourselves. we were wrong. but now any debate is pointless.}
<A>__{lilly stares at him. there is already something between them even though they stand on opposite sides of a huge gulf. she nods, accepting his pointerior}
<C>__{silus}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{the greatest danger is if this were to become public knowledge.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{wouldn't want anyone criticizing the church i suppose.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{it's more than that captain. this is about prejudice, or rather the nature of it. as a female surely you would understand.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{really.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{how many other captains in this borough are female?}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{none?}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{how are your actions judged, the same or differently from the men.}
<A>__{lilly stares at silus; he is an incredible being.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{differently.}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{exactly. if a white man kills, then he is just a killer. if a black man kills, then all black men are suspect. that is the nature of prejudice. those who are different are grouped together. if only one brother does a bad thing then all brothers are suspect, because we are different. and then what would this world be like, if there was no hope?}
<A>__{lilly nods, acknowledging the truth of it.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{alright then. so what do you suggest?}
<C>__{silus}
<D>__{first, there is something you should hear.}
<A>__{cut to}
