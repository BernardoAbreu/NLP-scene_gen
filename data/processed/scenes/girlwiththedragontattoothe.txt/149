<A>__{he's arranged some of his research on the floor, and watches salander kneeling before it, her eyes passing over photographs of the vanger clan, the accident on the bridge, xeroxes of the leviticus list and verses.}

<D>__{i've identified r.j. her name's rebecka jacobsson.}
<C>__{blomkvist }
<D>__{i have no idea who the others are or how they're connected to the death of a 16 year old girl but they have to be.}
<A>__{his eyes settle on her blue black "handcuffs" as hers settle on a copy of an old hedestad courier front page: the article about the grisly murder of rebecka jacobsson.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{we need to somehow figure out who they are, what happened to them, what the leviticus verses have to do with}
<P>__{(anything) }
<A>__{she gets up, goes to her desk, begins jotting something down, ignoring him.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{getting started. you can keep talking if you want.}
<A>__{blomkvist, slightly taken aback, picks up the leviticus xerox from the floor.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{would you like this?}
<C>__{salander}
<D>__{got it.}
<A>__{that's what she's jotting down, from memory: the names, initials and leviticus numbers. she wakes her laptop }
