<A>__{oscar lies on the operating table, sedated. the surgeons talk medical speak. they move with astounding quickness and precision. lead surgeon takes a large scalpel, and makes a 14 inch incision under oscar's right nipple. blood rushes out, it's worse than they thought. it begins to hit the floor. a resident surgeon reacts to this, and quickly grabs a large emesis basin. he puts it underneath the wound, catching the blood. another surgeon places a spreader into the wound, and opens it up. the lead surgeon looks inside of the incision. he lets his head down in frustration at what he sees.}
