<L>__{exterior a wedding bower aka chuppa}
<A>__{from behind the bower, rabbi bolensky emerges, strumming his guitar and singing:}
<C>__{bolensky}
<D>__{parsley sage, rosemary and thyme remember me to one who lives there...}
<A>__{a pullback reveals howard d. doyle before the altar with marylin. he is in a tuxedo and yarmulke. she is dressed in a simple, kennedy type gown.}
<C>__{bolensky}
<D>__{ she once was a true love of mine.}
<A>__{the last arpeggiated chord rings out; birds tweet, everyone sits. as miles and wrigley seat themselves, wrigley is sniffling. miles is irritated.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{what the hell is wrong with you?}
<C>__{wrigley}
<D>__{i can't help it. even with the business we're in, i it gets me every time. it's so optimistic.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{is she going through with it?}
<A>__{as the crowd quiets with the end of the song, wrigley murmurs:}
<C>__{wrigley}
<D>__{if she's not going through with it, she's cutting it awful close.}
<C>__{rabbi bolensky}
<D>__{parsley sage rosemary and thyme. ingredients. spices. spicy ingredients for the banquet we call life. marriage is like a great feast. courtship is the appetizer. a small mixed green taste of things to come. the early years the first course a carefully poached fish dish dependent on freshness and delicate handling. or perhaps a light pasta a tortellini stuffed with cheese and hope.}
<C>__{wrigley}
<P>__{(whispers, to miles)}
<D>__{you have any gum or mints?}
<C>__{rabbi}
<D>__{the main course mature love a hearty stew, cooked slowly in the oven of companionship until the meat falls off the bone. and then dessert. the reward for years spent together the sweetness of a life well lived. a sorbet of grandchildren, followed by the decafe demitasse of retirement.}
<A>__{there is silence, broken only by the twitter of birds and the restlessness of a hungry audience. finally:}
<C>__{rabbi bolenksy}
<D>__{do you chaim david doyle, take marylin to be the barbara to your wolfgang though the lean years as well as those that are heavily marbled?}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{rabbi bolensky}
<D>__{and do you, marylin rexroth, take chaim to be the roux in your bechamel? the stock in your sauce?}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{argh.}
<A>__{heads turn. miles bites a knuckle. birds twitter.}
<C>__{rabbi bolensky}
<D>__{then, by the power vested in me by the state of california, and as the maitre'd in the prix fixe four star restaurant of life, i now pronounce you man and wife...}
<A>__{a kiss. cheers. applause.}
<B>__{a reception on the grounds}
<A>__{rabbi bolensky strolls through the crowd with a heaping platter of smoked salmon. miles is darkly brooding as wrigley opens a tiffany box to show him the contents.}
<C>__{wrigley}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{what are they?}
<C>__{wrigley}
<D>__{berry spoons.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{spoons! honestly wrigley, i'm surprised at you. what is this? some martha stewart suggestion? those are the most cockamamie things i've ever }
<C>__{wrigley}
<D>__{miles why so angry?}
<A>__{miles sounds wistful:}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{why couldn't we be the club sandwich?}
<A>__{ding ding howard d. is tapping a knife against his wine glass. the crowd quiets.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls: i have something to say to my bride.}
<A>__{howard d. turns to one side to address marylin, taking one of her hands between his paws, as she beams up at him.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{ darling, like the rabbi said... life is a banquet, a grand bouffe, and marylin, darling... i just want you to know that i am in the kitchen and i can stand the heat!}
<A>__{laughter from the gallery.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{and i'm going to start this marriage by eating my words. because the hot hors d'oerve of this love story is pre nup primavera!}
<A>__{he reaches into his breast pocket and withdraws a piece of paper.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{carmine! bring on the pesto!}
<A>__{a caterer places a plate and a bowl of sauce in front of doyle. marylin looks on, surprised and bemused.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{ this is for you, darling.}
<A>__{he starts tearing strips off the piece of paper, dipping them into the sauce, and eating them. his mouth stuffed with paper, doyle repeats:}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{ this is for you, darling.}
<A>__{the crowd is murmuring the murmurs grow in volume a smattering of applause cheers more applause wild cheers. slowly rhythmically, miles starts thumping his hand together, nodding comprehension.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{brilliant.}
<A>__{next to him wrigley is puzzled.}
<C>__{wrigley}
<D>__{why is he doing that?}
<A>__{miles' hand clapping accelerates.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{brilliant. it's brilliant. he's eating the pre nup.}
<A>__{wrigley's eyes widen. he looks back at doyle eating the paper.}
<C>__{doyle}
<D>__{this is for you, darling!}
<A>__{wrigley bursts into tears.}
<C>__{wrigley}
<D>__{that's the most romantic thing i've ever seen in my life!}

<D>__{this is for you, darling!}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{marylin stands at the punch bowl accepting congratulations. miles approaches and draws her aside.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i'd like to offer my congratulations. that was a beautiful gesture of howard's.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{howard is a beautiful person.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{yes. he's a diamond in the rough. and i have a feeling that someday soon you'll be taking that diamond and leaving the rough.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{miles. miles. miles.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i am thrilled for you, but tell me this... how'd you get howard to do it? i've addressed enough juries to appreciate the power of suggestion, but it seemed like he thought it was his own idea.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{it was his idea. it was a gesture of love and trust. be happy for me, miles.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{well, when this goes south promise you'll have dinner with me?}
<C>__{marylin}
<P>__{(she holds a plate of food for him)}
<D>__{have you tried the duck?}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i figure a couple of months. that's how long it should take for the ink on the settlement to dry.}
<A>__{he takes the plate of food from her.}
<C>__{marylin}
<D>__{it has bones. be sure to swallow one.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{although knowing you as i do there will be no settlement. this time it will be complete and total annihilation.}
<A>__{with a roar we cut to:}
