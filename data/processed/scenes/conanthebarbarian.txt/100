<L>__{interior the pit night}
<A>__{the same pit where fariq sacrificed the female monk, only now, a half dozen combatants stand on the grid above the void. hanging high above the pit, in baskets, lie other prisoners, including tamara's fellow female monks. several of them yell out tamara's name as they see her. and watching everything, from an amphitheater above the cage, is the massive akhun and several of his slavers.}
<C>__{akhun}
<D>__{which ever one of you slaves gets me the girl, lives.}
<A>__{the combatants all close in on conan and tamara, each taking a different plank way to get to them.}
<C>__{conan}
<P>__{(to tamara)}
<D>__{stay behind me.}
<A>__{tamara steps behind conan, who blocks the others' path to her.}
<C>__{conan }
<D>__{who dies first?}
<A>__{the first two combatants attack as one, the first wielding a short sword, the other a pike. the pikeman thrusts first, conan deftly stepping aside, then pulling the pike, sending the wielder off balance and into the abyss. the prisoner with the short sword doesn't fare much better, as conan evades his swipe and decapitates him with a single blow.}
<B>__{tamara}
<A>__{tamara sees that the prisoner baskets are suspended by the top half of the metallic cage. she begins scaling the cage, her eyes set upon the imprisoned monks.}
<B>__{conan}
<A>__{three more combatants step in to replace the fallen duo. conan readies himself as the first one steps up, only to have the combatant suddenly grabbed by a enormous tentacle, much like the one conan cut through earlier.}
<B>__{tentacled monster}
<A>__{up from the darkness of the pit comes a gargantuan monster; a gigantic octopus like behemoth, with multiple tentacles that feed a pulsing black orifice lined with razor sharp teeth. the creature reaches out and grabs another screaming combatants, lowering him to its mouth and devouring him in its gnashing maw. the creature reaches for conan, who ducks underneath the tentacle, the slices it off. he immediately turns back to check on tamara and he discovers she's not there. he looks up to see tamara scaling the cage, now nearly fifty feet directly above him.}
<C>__{conan }
<D>__{crom!}
<B>__{akhun}
<A>__{the massive warrior spots tamara getting close to the prisoner baskets and motions to his two jailers.}
<C>__{akhun}
<D>__{get her!}
<B>__{tamara}
<A>__{she's reached the base of the chain supporting one of the baskets when she spots the two jailers closing in, climbing towards her from either side.}
<B>__{conan}
<A>__{spotting tamara overhead, conan tries to keep beneath her, evading the swarming tentacles while balancing on the rickety planks.}
<B>__{tamara}
<A>__{she's scaling down the basket supporting chain when the first jailer reaches out to grab her. she reacts by gashing his eyes, and as he instinctively grabs them, he falls towards}
<B>__{the pit. conan}
<A>__{conan barely dives out of the way as the fallen jailer smashes through the plank he was on, forcing conan to jump to another. just then another combatant comes swinging for the cimmerian, forcing him to defend while still not balanced.}
<B>__{tamara}
<A>__{the next jailer grabs her, pulling her off the cage. he struggles to pull towards a nearby exit hatch when she bites}
<B>__{his ear off.}
<A>__{the jailer drops tamara, who screams as she falls.}
<B>__{conan}
<A>__{conan spots tamara plunging towards him. in one swift move, he slashes his opponent, ducks underneath a writhing tentacle, and reaches out to grab tamara by the arm as she falls. his shoulder nearly pops out, but he manages to hold onto tamara.}
<B>__{tamara}
<A>__{she swings above the chasm, the gnashing teeth of the monster below her. only a single splintering plank holds her and conan aloft.}
<B>__{conan}
<A>__{with a grunt, he swings tamara and throws her to safety, at the edge of the pit. but as he gets to his feet, he spots the massive akhun entering the arena.}
<B>__{akhun}
<A>__{the giant warrior grins as he boards the same plank as conan. he thrusts his thunderous legs down, causing the plank to bend and warp. conan struggle to balance on the undulating plank, but his training in cimmeria serves him well. akhun smiles and step closer, again thrusting down with his legs. conan's balance is thrown, but there's no other plank close enough for him to jump to.}
<C>__{akhun }
<D>__{you'll make a nice meal.}
<A>__{akhun steps down on the plank one last time, but this time conan uses the momentum to springboard up into air. conan soars into the air, his cat like reflexes keeping him focused as he lands right before the stunned akhun. with one great slash of his blade, conan eviscerates akhun. akhun's innards drop out of his belly as he falls into the abyss, only to be snapped up by the massive beast.}
