<L>__{interior cabinet room day}
<A>__{excom listens in sober silence.}
<C>__{general taylor}
<D>__{we have a flight of thunderchiefs able to respond within minutes of an attack on our planes.}
<A>__{kenny catches the president's eye. kenny glances at the door. step outside, i need to talk to you.}
<L>__{interior oval office continuous}
<A>__{the president and kenny stand in front of the president's desk. all the doors are shut. weak sunlight filters into the hushed room as if to a confessional.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{i don't like what's happening.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{in the morning i'm taking charge of the blockade from the situation room. mcnamara'll set up shop in the flag plot at the pentagon, keep an eye on things there.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{all right. 'cause you get armed boarders climbing into soviet ships, shots being fired across bows...}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{i know, i know...}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{what about these low level flights? they're starting in what? an hour? do you realize what you're letting yourself in for?}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{we need those flights. we have to know when those missiles become operational, because when they do, we need to destroy them.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{fair enough. but castro's on alert and we're flying attack planes over their sites, on the deck. there's no way for them to know they're carrying cameras, not bombs. they're going to be shot at, plain and simple.}
<A>__{kenny's right, and the president looks away in frustration.}
<C>__{kenny }
<D>__{i'm your political advisor, and i'm giving you political analysis here. this is a setup. the chiefs want to go in. it's the only way they can redeem themselves for the bay of pigs. they have to go in, and they have to do it right. it's that simple.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{i'm gonna protect those pilots.}
<A>__{thep president stares intently at kenny. kenny glances at the door, his voice hushed. he hesitates.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{they're boxing us in with these rules of engagement. if you agree to 'em, and one of our planes gets knocked down or one of the ships won't stop for inspection, the chiefs will have us by the balls and will force us to start shooting. they want a war, and they're arranging things to get one. if you don't want one, we have to do something about it.}
<A>__{the president understands. he shakes his head, paces away.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{how does a man get to a place where he can say, 'throw those lives away,' so easily?}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{maybe it's harder for them to say it than they let on. at the very least, they believe it's in our best interest. and at the end of the day, they may end up being right.}
<A>__{the president turns away, considers. then turns back.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{triple check everything the chiefs say to us with the guys who actually have to do it. no one's to know about this but bobby. i need redundant control over what happens out there. and if things aren't as advertised, you're going to make sure they come out the way i want them to come out, starting with this low level flight thing.}
<A>__{jesus christ...kenny is daunted. for a beat he just stares.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{that's going to be tough. you know how these guys are about their chains of command...}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{any problems, you remind them those chains of commands end at one place. me.}
