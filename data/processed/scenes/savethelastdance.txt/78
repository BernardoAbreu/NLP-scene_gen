<L>__{exterior o'donnell heights rooftop late day}
<A>__{a low sun over the cityscape of baltimore. push in on patrick and sara, two dots that grow larger. he clicks on a boom box resting on the roof's ledge. a hip hop track blasts.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{feel the groove. don't let the music mess with you.}
<A>__{he starts to move with the music. sara tries to emulate him. they dance throughout the conversation.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{did you always want to be a doctor?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{who said i wanna be a doctor?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{chenille. everybody.}
<A>__{he cinches her waist, pushes in her ass.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{keep it tight. watch your butt.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{what kind of doctor do you want to be?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{pediatrics. i like kids. come on, stay with me. you're slackin'.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{do you have any? kids.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{no. do you?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i wasn't being smart, patrick.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{wouldn't be the first time.}
<A>__{she stops. regards him. he stops. regards her. stalemate.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{screw you. i'm brilliant.}
<A>__{he goes into a spin, a half split, comes out of it swaggering and half stepping around her. sara gives him an impish look. rises up on full pointe, turns out her legs and lifts one of them in a spiral just below his head. it happens in two blinks. so fast patrick thinks it was a mirage. he stares at her, dumbfounded. sara smiles. the look on his face is worth the pain in her joints. she blows some stray hair out of her face, puts her hands on her hips. looks appropriately hapless.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{i didn't get it. that thing you just did. show me again?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{what was that shit you just did?}
<A>__{he mimes the move badly. sara can't help it. she laughs.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{a releve. over ice. with a twist.}
<C>__{sara }
<P>__{(succumbs to his bewilderment)}
<D>__{ballet. i used to dance, patrick.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{you used to dance?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{uh huh. used to as in don't any more. and don't ask me why.}
<A>__{she sounds suddenly defensive. patrick's suddenly intrigued.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{because i don't want to talk about it.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{that's why you brought it up. did that whole relieve thing. 'cause you don't wanna talk about it?}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{because it's not a big deal. can we just concentrate on this?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{yeah, we can concentrate.}
<P>__{(a beat; goading her a little)}
<D>__{but i think it is a big deal. whatever it is you don't wanna talk about.}
<A>__{sara shakes her head adamantly. he nods his head emphatically. another stalemate. they dance coyly, seductively around it.}
