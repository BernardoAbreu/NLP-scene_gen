<A>__{the sound is getting louder, and louder...}
<C>__{joy}
<D>__{oh, my god...}
<A>__{the meters are hovering just below the red...}
<B>__{sam}
<A>__{pivots his head and looks at the tiny microphone, no bigger than a pencil eraser, attached neatly to the headrest. he begins chewing his wad of gum... leans in toward the microphone, his head obscuring what he's doing... he moves back and we see he's sealed the front of the mic with a small piece of the gum. and his meter drops to zero.}

<A>__{sam tilts his head forward and bends his wrist upward so he can get the rest of the gum out of his mouth. then, while keeping pressure on the armrest with his elbow, he moves his hand over to mrs. han. they can't quite reach each other... he flicks the piece of gum and she catches it. meanwhile, the noise increases. the two meters peak into the red... the yellow warning light begins to flash... mrs. han quickly puts the gum in her mouth, bites it in half, and cautiously passes the remainder over to joy. joy puts the gum in her mouth. she tries to push it over her mic, but her hair is in the way. she shakes her head; some hair strands remain, but she covers the mic just as the gardeners' noise reaches a crescendo... all three sound meters sit pinned to zero. the yellow light stops flashing. sam, sweating, looks at his mother and sister... and starts laughing. they join him: a celebration for a small victory.}
