<D>__{i think so.}
<A>__{kale looks down at his dad his eyes widen in horror, not only at the sight of jeff, but of the ravine beneath them for this brief moment, we may have thought the suv was stable. but we crane back up and out kale's passenger window to reveal a much grimmer reality: the suv is perched lengthwise on top of the guardrail at a 45 degree downward angle. the suv's right front and rear tires precariously grip the rail, keeping it from plunging 500 feet to the ravine below.}
