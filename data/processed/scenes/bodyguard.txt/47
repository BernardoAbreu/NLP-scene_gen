<A>__{rachel has been watching fletcher and frank down the hill. now she leans back on the chaise lounge where she is sunning, trying to listen to a new song on a walkman. there is the screeching howl of a drill on metal from the direction of the house. rachel jumps up and yells toward the house.}

<D>__{you! you! out! out! now! out of here! get out!}
<A>__{terrified, the old locksmith drops his tools and begins backing out of the room.}
<C>__{old locksmith}
<D>__{yes, ma'am. thank you. i'm a real fan of yours, miss marron.}
<A>__{still angry, but disarmed, rachel makes a face.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{then you can take your tools with you.}
<A>__{she turns to the window, in what she imagines is frank's general direction, and, like a little girl, suddenly sticks out her tongue.}
