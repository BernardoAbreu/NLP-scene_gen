<L>__{interior chimera cargo compartment day}
<A>__{the debris has been cleared away to reveal a clean 5'x 5' x}
<L>__{4' stack of gold ingots.}
<C>__{dodge }
<D>__{what the fuck we gonna do with it?}
<A>__{greer, murphy, epps, and dodge all look on.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{what the fuck you think we gonna do with it? it's ours, baby. it's all ours.}
<A>__{murphy has stepped forward, taking an ingot, inspecting it.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{how much you figure that's worth, skipper?}
<C>__{murphy}
<P>__{(still looking it over)}
<D>__{hard to say. maybe forty, fifty million.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{ho, baby!}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{that's a lot of money for somebody to just let float away.}
<A>__{murphy looks up at her from the gold.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{yes, it is.}
<A>__{a beat as they all hold there.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{it's a hell of a lot of money.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{what, you think there's something funny about it?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{a ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard, adrift? and nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it?}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{if they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{not for fifty million. an ocean liner maybe. but fifty million in gold, they come looking for.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{maybe they didn't want it back. maybe the whole fat deal was insured.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{maybe. but there's always somebody whose interest's at stake.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{all i gotta say is it looks like that somebody's us right now.}
<A>__{greer cackles as he high fives dodge.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{and it looks like somebody got here before us too.}
<A>__{the steel hatch is twisted, as from a great hand ripping it back from the wall.}
<C>__{dodge}
<P>__{(inspecting it)}
<D>__{didn't happen yesterday, i will tell you that. torn parts rusted bad as the rest of the boat.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{then it happened before they scuttled her.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you mean, before she sank.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{cargo like this could make a crew think twice.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{that it could.}
<A>__{a beat, as they all look on at the gold.}
