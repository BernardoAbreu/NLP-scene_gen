<A>__{elmore, seated, wrapped in quilts and heated blankets, shivering horribly, lips blackened, flexing brittle fingers on his good hand, trying to restore feeling, teeth clattering like ten thousand tea cups. margie turlock enters, arms loaded down, grandson warren hot on her heels, a set of nunchukas under his arm... ...elmore, palpable hatred, pure bile for the boy. margie sets the assortment of goods down on the table in front of elmore; tourist themed hats & sweatsuits from the shop, a pair of thermals, a collection of pill bottles and what appears to be an old vietnam era ammo box.}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{so them fellas were your friends then? the ones that was shot and tossed into the lake? were they police officers too?}
<A>__{elmore nods, rifling the pile in front of him, going for the pills. margie pulls a pot of coffee off the stove, pours a mug. sets it down in front of him.}
<C>__{margie }
<P>__{(motioning to pills)}
<D>__{them was left over from my hysterectomy, so they're a few years old, might be outta date.}
<A>__{elmore eyes the labels; vicodin, vioxx...morphine based. nice...just numb it all.}
<C>__{margie }
<D>__{you sure you don't want me to call an ambulance honey?}
<C>__{margie }
<D>__{i think it's crazy you not going in...y'got what looks like hypothermia and real bad frostbite. they could wind up amputatin' if y'don't get it treated.}
<A>__{warren sits in the chair next to elmore and begins mimicking him, shaking epileptically, doing his doofus bit, tucking three fingers away, waving a stump, belly laughing...}
<C>__{margie }
<D>__{warren! now you go and practice your nunchucks now, leave us be for a bit shug.}
<A>__{warren scowls, getting up, in super slow motion, making sounds with his mouth as he stands, robotic whirs, buzzes, clicks margie chuckles at her grandson, she can't help it then, in a blur, warren snaps, abruptly slamming the nunchakas on the table, the rebounding portion of the weapon almost hitting elmore in the face. he bolts the room before grandma can scold him, his titters echoing off like taunts...}
<C>__{margie }
<D>__{...m'sorry about that boy, his momma abandoned him going on a year now, his daddy, my boy dale gulf war vet, s'over in the reno washoe correctional facility got some "clarity" issues. he did some home invasion sodomy torture type stuff, wrote a buncha bad checks, got hisself consecutive life terms shipped off to soledad there in california.}

<D>__{ reminds me, i got that care package i need to send off }
<P>__{(beat, continues lament)}
<D>__{anyhoo, m'husband bill took the coward's route, n'committed suicide by hangin' 'bout nine months back. ever since then, little boogie there's been the man'a the house!}
<P>__{(beat, gnarled grin)}
<D>__{and we make a darn cute couple i think!}
<A>__{margie, cackling again the facade of sanity showing serious signs of strain...elmore pulls the ammo box across the table. stenciled on the side: "177th airborne division charlie company reckon" he cracks the lid.}
<C>__{margie }
<D>__{i don't think that's been opened since my husband died.}
<A>__{inside, army memorabilia and bric a brac; patches, service tags, dog earred b&w polaroids, ancient titty mags, (which make margie horribly uncomfortable) saigon bottled beer and most importantly, a .357 colt python. elmore lifts it, looks it over, feels the heft, drops the chamber it's loaded. he sifts some more, palms loose bullets at the bottom of the box. he cracks a blackened grin, rolling the pistol's chamber and snapping it shut as we...}
