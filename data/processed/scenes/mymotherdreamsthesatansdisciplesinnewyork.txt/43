<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior satan's disciples' clubhouse night}
<A>__{dolly across a line of idling harleys, the bikers, one at a time in succession, switching their single beam headlights on. pan across the faces of the disciples, mounted on their cycles, dark helmets, faded blue jeans jackets embroidered with elaborate stitching of their club's insignia, cigarettes dangling from their hirsute mouths, baleful looking countenances, revving their engines loudly, tauntingly. new angle from across the street, marian, appearing like an apparition in her nightgown, surreally walks toward them, a beseeching look on her face.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{excuse me. could you please turn your motorcycles off? they're so loud, i can't sleep.}
<A>__{go to slow motion as the bikers, some ten in number, slowly approach the frail looking marian. gently, they pick her up off the ground and raise her aloft. then, like some moving human bier, they carry her through the forbidding black door into their clubhouse.}
