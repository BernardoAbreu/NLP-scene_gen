<L>__{exterior lazarus' home day}
<A>__{laz runs out of his own home, not even shutting the door behind him. he gets half way down his drive, the bible still clutched in his hand. he stops. in a panic, laz opens his bible, places it down on the drive, face up, creating a barrier to evil. he hears a choking cough inside the house. rae is fighting for breath beyond the dark door. silence. laz reaches down and picks up his bible. a passage catches his eye. as he reads, the fear vanishes from his face. his back straightens. his jaw tightens. he looks back at his house, his faith is renewed.}
