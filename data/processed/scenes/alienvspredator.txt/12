<A>__{lex is asleep. on her chest folded open is an issue of "scientific american" magazine. it features a picture of weyland and the title: "charles bishop weyland, pioneer of modern robotics." staring out the window one seat over is chemical engineer graham miller (glasses, lifelong, card carrying science geek). he stands up and attempts to take a picture of himself. first attempt he blinds himself. second attempt the chopper bumps and he's knocked into lex. she wakes up.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{she nods, starts to go back to sleep.}
<C>__{miller }
<D>__{but since you're awake, would you mind?}
<A>__{he hands her his digital camera. she snaps the picture.}
<C>__{miller }
<D>__{documenting the trip for my boys so they know that their father wasn't always boring.}
<A>__{miller shows lex a picture of his sons on his camera.}
<C>__{miller }
<D>__{that's jacob. and that's scotty.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{they're cute. is this your wife?}
<C>__{miller}
<P>__{(extending hand)}
<D>__{ex wife. graham miller, chemical engineer.}
<C>__{lex}
<P>__{(doing likewise)}
<D>__{alexa woods, environmental technician and guide.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{do you work for weyland?}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{no. i split my time between working for a small environmental group and taking scientists on expeditions on the ice. one pays for the other and neither pays very well.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{the ice?}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{antarctica. co pilot lex, you and your friend buckle up. we're going to hit some turbulence.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{friend of yours?}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{...of my dad's. he trained most of the pilots down here. during the summer, my sister and i tagged along.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{does she work with you?}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{no. she hates the cold, moved to florida. if you see her skiing, she's being pulled by a boat.}
<A>__{the co pilot turns and hollers from the cockpit.}
<D>__{co pilot just passed the psr!}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{damn, i wanted a picture.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{of what?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{the psr. they should really call it out before you pass it.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{the psr is the point of safe return. it means we've used more than half our fuel so we can't turn back.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{but we could still land? i mean if something went wrong...?}
<A>__{wicked turbulence starts to shake violently.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{we could ditch}
<P>__{(miller looks relieved)}
<D>__{ but the temperature of the water would kill us in three minutes.}
<A>__{miller goes pale as the chopper continues to shake.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{antarctica.}
