<L>__{interior team clifford building continuous}
<A>__{jay walks out of his office, into the half finished top floor of the condos. exposed beams and drying cement reveal how far behind schedule jay really is...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{hello? anyone there?}
<A>__{he swings the gun round impotently, seeing nothing in the flickering florescent light... finally jay lowers the weapon. it looks like he might collapse, until he catches himself, palms flat against the wall, head down.}
<C>__{jay }
<D>__{fuck me...}
<C>__{elena }
<D>__{any time. any place...}
<A>__{he reels around, sees elena moving toward him, brushing aside the thick plastic sheeting. she has a bottle of beer in one hand, a video camera in the other. jay's video camera to be precise...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{you promised to show me your erection...}
<A>__{elena focuses the video camera on jay's crotch. makes him incredibly uncomfortable, obviously.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{is that my...camera?}
<A>__{elena thrusts the bottle of beer at jay.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{lighten up, jay.}
<A>__{jay takes the bottle from her, sets it down on the concrete floor.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{enough's enough. i think it's time you left.}
<A>__{this brings a teasing pout to elena's lips.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{is that any way to treat marie's new best friend?}
<A>__{jay's taken aback.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{you're best friends are you?}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{sure. we've been having sleepovers. talking about boys, swapping tips. she's been teaching me about shopping, i've been teaching her about giving mind blowing head...}
<A>__{jay's taken aback once more. how much more aback can he be taken? he reaches out and blocks the video camera lens.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{gimme the camera back...}
<A>__{elena saunters slowly past, brushing up against him. keeps the camera trained on his worried face...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{come get it.}
<A>__{jay's reaching his elastic limit. he reaches for the camera, but elena won't let go. they wrestle for control of the video camera. and finally the camera slips from both their grasps, flies across the room and shatters on the concrete floor...}
<C>__{elena}
<P>__{(slyly)}
<D>__{ooopppps.}
<A>__{elena runs her finger under jay's chin, then turns and walks away, leaving jay standing there, all taken aback.}
