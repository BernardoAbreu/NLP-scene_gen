<L>__{exterior vacant, weedy drag racetrack day}
<A>__{close on a souped up tractor wheeled monster truck, its engine roaring before a starting line, itching to cross it. now take a step back... that souped up monster truck stands a foot and a half off the ground and sprouts an antenna from its back bumper. it's a remote controlled toy. the roaring engine comes from the vehicle next to it: an actual monster truck. both vehicles peer down the track at a finish line a hundred yards away. this is a race. the drivers stare each other down: turk (behind the wheel of the truck) and virgil (track side, remote control in hand) malloy. they're nice boys. really. peckerwoods, sure, but nice.}

<A>__{lights flash red to yellow to green and while the truck coats rubber on the track, virgil's toy zips to a lead. it's looking to be an embarrassment for turk until he jerks his wheel a little and ka thunk flattens his brother's vehicle. virgil pouts as he plucks up the wreckage of his entry.}
