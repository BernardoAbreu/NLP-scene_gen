<L>__{interior laura's office. day}
<A>__{laura, a well dressed, attractive woman in her late 30s, sits in a chair a few feet from mark. his gurney takes up most of the available space in the room.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{did you ever discuss sex with your parents?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no. that would have been unthinkable.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{that's the way they saw the world. it wasn't just that polite people didn't think about sex. no one did. it was never discussed. as far as they were concerned, there was nothing down there.}
<A>__{laura listens. she is pretty in a dark, angular way. a phone on her desk rings.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{sorry about that.}
<A>__{she walks over to it, pushes a button, then comes back. she has a noticeable limp.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{what's that from?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{cerebral palsy.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you'd hardly notice.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{people notice. it's not easy, the whole thing, attracting a guy, dating, sex, all very problematic.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i find that hard to believe in your case.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{well, you better believe it.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{so, what sort of chance do you give me?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{of achieving your romantic fantasy? very small to minute.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{look, there's no need to pull any punches. you can be as direct as you like with me.}
<A>__{she smiles.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{mark, i'm just a humble sex therapist. i try to help people with sex problems that can be addressed. your problem, i understand, is that you have never had sex.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{that's correct.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{would i be correct in assuming you're unable to masturbate?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{correct.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{has anyone done it for you?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{have you ever asked anyone?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{not specifically. i asked someone to marry me. she declined. does that come close to masturbation?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you know, being with the person you love is not the only way of expressing yourself sexually. there are people called sex surrogates.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{oh?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{psychotherapists and psychiatrists are not allowed to have sex with their clients, even if it seems like a good idea. sex surrogates don't have that limitation.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{would this be covered by my medical benefits?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{unfortunately, no. you'd have to pay the full fee, whatever that was.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{so, basically, i would be paying for sex.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{yes mark, you would be paying for sex. but the person you would be paying is not a hooker. she is a highly trained and sensitive professional, who is not motivated by money. just as i'm not. in fact, you can think of a surrogate as an extension of me. do i seem like a hooker to you?}
<A>__{mark thinks.}
