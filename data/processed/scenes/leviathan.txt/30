<A>__{beck, dressed now in crisp white clothes, stands on deck of the ship. he glances occasionally at a door nearby marked infirmary, then looks up as the captain approaches and shakes his hand.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{mr. beck, i understand you passed your physical with flying colors. and ms. williams?}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{i don't know yet, she's still in there.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{well, you'll be glad to know you have a friend onboard.}
<A>__{beck looks up surprised as suddenly martin joins them.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(excitedly)}
<D>__{beck! i told them you'd make it. no one back at transocean believed me, but i never gave up on you once.}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{so, how are you feeling?}
<A>__{beck looks at martin for an instant then hauls off and in one incredibly smooth punch knocks martin on his can across the deck.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{better...a lot better.}
<A>__{just then the door to the infirmary opens and willie appears with a new outfit on. smiles at beck.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{i'm fine!}
<A>__{beck lets out a slight sigh of relief as a steward approaches with a tray of whole cooked fish, hideous looking things like anglers, lobsters, crabs...miniature leviathan. the sight is almost too intense for beck and willie. the captain notices.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{i thought we might have some wonderful seafood. but, if there's something else you'd rather have...}
<A>__{willie stares at the tray of seafood uneasily then looks at the captain and smiles.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{how about a burger and fries?}
<A>__{she and beck laugh as they sit at a finely set table on the deck with the captain. as we pull back the ship becomes smaller and smaller in the distance and we are at the}
