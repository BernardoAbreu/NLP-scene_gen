<C>__{joe }
<D>__{you are presented with a simple fact: andrew beckett was fired. you will hear two explanations for why he was fired. ours. and theirs...}
<A>__{joe crosses the courtroom, coming to stand in front of... andrew, whose appearance has changed: thinner, paler than we've ever seen him, some blisters on his lips. but the most disturbing thing about his appearance is the way he moves, slowly, like a much older man. he's taking notes (which he will do relentlessly throughout the trial.) and he has a cane at his side, which he'll use throughout the trial.}

<D>__{it's up to you, to sift through layer and layer of truth, and determine for yourselves the version that sounds the most true.}
<A>__{charles wheeler, walter kenton, bob seidman, kenneth killcoyne sit behind their lawyers, belinda conine and jerome green, and several assistants at the defense table. judge garnett presides from his bench. among the spectators, miguel sits next to sarah, and andrew's sister jill. aids activists in the background.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{there are certain points in our version, that i must prove to you... point number one: andrew beckett was... is a brilliant lawyer. a great lawyer. point number two. andrew beckett, afflicted with a debilitating disease, made the legal, understandable, personal choice to keep the fact of his illness to himself... point number three: his employers discovered his illness. and ladies and gentlemen, the illness i'm referring to, is aids...}
<A>__{joe pauses, letting that sink in.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{point number four. they panicked. and, in their panic, they did what most of us would like to do with aids... get it, and the people who have it, as far away from us as possible.}
<A>__{joe walks away from andrew.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{the behavior of andrew beckett's employers may seem reasonable to you. it does to me. after all, aids is a deadly, incurable, disease...}
<B>__{close on members of the jury.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{but however you come to judge the behavior of charles wheeler and his partners in moral, ethical, human terms... when they fired andrew beckett because he had aids, they broke the law .}
<A>__{with a swift, direct glance at the judge, joe speaks with considerable power and emotion:}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{and, when lawyers break the law, when this society loses respect for the law, when that day comes, our cherished institutions will be burned to the ground, and our children and grandchildren will live like savages.}
