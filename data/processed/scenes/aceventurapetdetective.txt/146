<L>__{interior hallway continuous}
<A>__{emilio high tails it out of there. dodging concession stand patrons, bathroom lines, etc… melissa runs behind, trying to catch up.}
<C>__{melissa}
<D>__{emilio, is he in trouble?}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{don't worry, there's nothing ace can't handle!}
<L>__{interior ironworks factory day}
<A>__{einhorn cocks her gun. ace's face is glistening with tears. he's a complete wreck.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{don't kill meeee!! pleeheeheeheeheeeezzz!!! i will never tell anyone! i swear!}
<P>__{(indicating marino)}
<D>__{he's the one you want!! kill him!!}
<C>__{marino}
<P>__{(indicating ace)}
<D>__{no… kill him!}
<A>__{the two argue. einhorn fires a shot in the air to stop them.}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{no, i'm gonna kill the dolphin first.}
<P>__{(to ace)}
<D>__{i wouldn't want you to miss that.}
<A>__{einhorn walks to the edge of the tank. she aims the gun at snowflake and fires! we see the bullet miss snowflake under water. snowflake swims wildly. she fires again! misses again. suddenly, ace hollers!}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{blue forty two!!}
<A>__{einhorn turns to ace.}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{shut up!!}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{blue forty two!}
<A>__{einhorn shoots at ace! he dives out of the way.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{hut! hut!}
<A>__{suddenly, snowflake leaps out of the water and takes the gun out of einhorn's hand, like the trick we saw earlier. snowflake swims around the pool with the gun in his mouth.}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(smug)}
<D>__{yes. the highly trained dolphin. perhaps the smartest mammal in the animal kingdom. see how he knew exactly what i wanted him to do, as if our minds were somehow in complete synchronization. they have been know to save men at sea you know. they have their own language.}
<P>__{(to snowflake)}
<D>__{snowflake. come here, snowflake! bring me the gun!}
<P>__{(makes dolphin sounds)}
<D>__{eeeeee! eeeeee! eeeeee!}
<A>__{just like the trick in his routine, however, snowflake swims around the tank, passes ace, then hands the gun back to einhorn. he finishes with a tail walk.}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{stupid fish.}
<A>__{on tv: miami's kicker boots a perfect field goal from fifty yards.}
<C>__{john madden}
<D>__{he got all of his leg into that one!}
<A>__{the field goal kicker is hugged by his teammates.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{good to see someone who doesn't buckle under the pressure?}
<C>__{marino}
<D>__{yeah, not like in 82 when we choked…}
<A>__{einhorn walks to ace and puts the gun against his head.}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{what would you know about pressure?}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{well, i've kissed a man.}
<C>__{john madden }
<D>__{of course, there's never been a more crucial kick than the famous kick heard 'round the world…}
<A>__{the famous footage airs on tv. they all turn to watch.}
<C>__{john madden}
<D>__{…i mean, it's clear to me that it was a good hold. finkle just booted it.}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{the laces weren't out. the laces weren't out!!}
<A>__{einhorn takes a shot at the screen, creating a hole in madden's forehead. ace uses the moment to smack the gun out of her hand. a huge, no holds barred fight ensues. ace and einhorn punch each other about the face and stomach. einhorn throws a punch at ace. ace goes down. einhorn goes for the loose gun. ace leaps and tackles her. they both crash into old rusty equipment, raising a mountain of dust. marino struggles all the while trying to get free. einhorn kicks ace. he flies into marino.}
<C>__{marino}
<D>__{having a little trouble with the lady, ace?}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(out of breath)}
<D>__{you don't understand, she's a –}
<A>__{einhorn grabs ace, throws him into a head lock and begins wailing on his face. meanwhile, cops start arriving, swat team members disperse onto the catwalk as the fight continues. they try but can't get a bead on ace as the two roll around on the floor. more punches. they fight up a flight of stairs, then back down. to the amazement of the swat team, ace and einhorn slug it out as equals.}
<C>__{aguado}
<P>__{(caught up)}
<D>__{get him, lois!}
<A>__{now they crash through a plate glass window together. ace gets to his knees first and wobbles toward the gun. it's the first clear shot the swat team has had.}
<C>__{einhorn}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{shoot him! shoot him!}
<A>__{we all hear the guns cocked. we see ace in the rifle sights. we see fingers twitch on triggers. a loud voice comes from off camera.}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{don't shoot! hold your fire!}
<A>__{melissa is holding emilio's gun under his chin.}
<C>__{melissa}
<D>__{put down your guns or this cop gets it!}
<A>__{the swat team hesitates.}
<C>__{melissa }
<D>__{i mean it!!}
<A>__{much to emilio's surprise, she cocks the gun.}
<C>__{emilio}
<P>__{(whispers to melissa)}
<D>__{ah… melissa? that's a hair trigger.}
<P>__{(loud to cops)}
<D>__{she's not joking!}
<A>__{the swat team leader signals his men. they lower their guns. einhorn gets back to her feet.}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{he kidnapped snowflake. he killed roger podacter, and he was about to kill dan marino and me!}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{ho, ho! fiction can be fun! but i find the reference section much more enlightening.}
<P>__{(doing his best clarence darrow)}
<D>__{for instance, if you were to look up 'professional football's all time bonehead plays', you might read about a miami dolphin kicker named ray finkle, who missed a twenty six yard field goal in the closing seconds of super bowl seventeen.}
<P>__{(in one breath)}
<D>__{what you wouldn't read about is how ray finkle lost his mind, and was committed to a mental institute, only to escape and join the police force under the assumed identity of a missing hker, seducing her way to the top, in a diabolical plan to get even with dan marino whom he blamed for the entire thing!!!}
<A>__{ace gasps for air. everyone is totally confused.}
<C>__{aguado}
<D>__{what the hell are you trying to say?}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{she's not lois einhorn! she's ray finkle! she's a man!}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{he's lying! shoot him!}
<A>__{ace walks over to her.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{let's just see who's lying. would a real woman have to wear one of these?}
<A>__{ace dramatically pulls at einhorn's hair, thinking it's a wig. einhorn's head flies back. the hair is real. ace keeps tugging it. the swat team ready themselves.}
<C>__{ace }
<D>__{boy, that's really on there! but tell me this: would a real woman be missing these?!}
<A>__{ace rips open einhorn's blouse, and reveals two beautiful feminine breasts. the sharp shooters are tensing. ace is laughing nervously now.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{ha, ha, ha! that kind of surgery can be done over the weekend! but i doubt if she could find the time during her busy schedule to get rid of mr. knish!!}
<A>__{ace rips off einhorn's skirt. einhorn now stands there fully nude. she appears to be the perfect figure of a woman.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{oooh boy.}
<A>__{ace looks at melissa and emilio and shrugs his shoulders. then, just when it seems all is lost, dan marino who is back behind einhorn, motions for ace to come over.}
<C>__{marino}
<D>__{psst… ace. come here.}
<C>__{ace}
<P>__{(to everyone)}
<D>__{could you excuse me just a second.}
<A>__{ace goes to dan. melissa still holds emilio hostage.}
<C>__{einhorn}
<D>__{shoot him. shoot him, now!!}
<C>__{melissa}
<P>__{(to cops)}
<D>__{don't anybody make a move!}
<A>__{marino whispers something in his ear. ace looks confident again. he once more addresses the crowd.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, my esteemed colleague mr. marino, has just brought some new evidence to my attention. now, history has certainly shown that even the most intuitive criminal minds can be wrong, from time to time. but, if i have been mistaken… if the lieutenant is indeed a woman… then my friends, she is suffering from the worst case of hemorrhoids i have ever seen!!!}
<A>__{ace spins einhorn around now, exposing to the world, the healthy set of male genetalia that finkle has learned to keep tucked between his legs. (and if we have any balls, we'll actually show it.) everyone gasps. close up on einhorn finkle. he finally drops the facade.}
<C>__{finkle}
<P>__{(deepest voice possible)}
<D>__{it was marino's fault. the laces were in.}
<P>__{(breaking down now)}
<D>__{they were in!!!}
<A>__{quick cuts of all the cops spitting with disgust. then emilio spits. then close on marino spitting. they all have kissed her him it. even snowflake blows his spout. ace confidently cracks a sunflower seed.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{somebody read it its rights.}
<A>__{suddenly, finkle picks up a shard of broken glass and lunges at ace.}
<C>__{finkle}
<D>__{die animal boyyyyy!!!}
<A>__{thinking fast ace sidesteps finkle and sends him head first into snowflake's makeshift tank. after a few seconds finkle fights his way to the surface and thrashes around, helplessly.}
<C>__{finkle}
<P>__{(gasping for air)}
<D>__{help i can't swim!!!}
<A>__{finkle goes under again. we see him under water sinking down. snowflake swims to him now, allowing him to grab onto his fin and pulls finkle gently to the side of the pool. finkle lies there exhausted. ace reaches down into frame, removing the '82 afc championship ring from finkle's finger. we see that it's the ring with the missing stone. ace replaces it with the stone in his pocket. it's a perfect fit.}
<C>__{ace}
<D>__{llloooser! lloo hoo serr herr herr!!!}
<A>__{melissa is still holding the gun on emilio.}
<C>__{emilio}
<D>__{melissa… you can give me back my gun now.}
<A>__{melissa has forgotten she even had the gun. she hands it to emilio and faints in his arms. now aguado appears beside ace.}
<C>__{aguado}
<D>__{i don't know how you did it, ventura… but that was damn good police work. alright guys, let's wrap this up!}
