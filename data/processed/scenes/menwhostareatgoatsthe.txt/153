<L>__{exterior army base building day}
<A>__{lyn emerges blinking into the light. he stares around him. the song is playing over speakers, echoing eerily around the base. a door slides shut with a clang nearby and lyn turns to locate the sound. a trail of footprints leads across the sand to a hangar nearby. lyn heads off across the sand, dragging the iv. bob emerges behind him.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{lyn!}
<A>__{lyn reaches the sliding doors of the building and drags them open and stands staring into the gloomy interior. bob catches him up.}
<C>__{bob }
<D>__{i don't think we should...}
<A>__{he stops following lyn's gaze...}
<B>__{inside the building}
<A>__{the place is full of goats. lyn and bob stare at the animals. slowly lyn advances into the darkness, peering around him. in the shadows at the back of the building a figure stirs. lyn walks slowly forward until he can make out the man old, bearded, worn and wasted by years of heavy drinking. it's bill django. lyn stares at him.}

<P>__{(choked)}
<D>__{hello bill.}
<A>__{bill smiles hesitantly.}
<C>__{bill django}
<D>__{hello lyn.}
<A>__{lyn is too choked with emotion for a moment to answer.}
<C>__{lyn cassady}
<D>__{this is bob.}
<C>__{bill django}
<D>__{hello bob.}
<A>__{bob is too amazed to reply.}
