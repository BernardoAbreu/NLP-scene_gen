<L>__{exterior albatross establishing day}
<A>__{aerial shot. the albatross is under full sail leaving bermuda for the last time.}
<C>__{older chuck }
<D>__{and so it was the albatross that took to the open sea with the wind in her snapping canvas and a bone of white foam in her teeth... in each of us were feelings of anticipation and hesitation for the man at the wheel and of the unfamiliar world he was leading us into.}
<A>__{she crashes through the surf driving, majestic music, building. deck day the crew hauls in the line, raising the mainsail. chuck struggles to coil the rope as fast as it is coming in.}
<B>__{aloft}
<A>__{the crew take turns racing up the ratlines into the rigging.}
<B>__{bowsprit net}
<A>__{the crew pull down the jib trying to furl it. most of the sail ends up dragging in the water.}
<B>__{above}
<A>__{the squaresails are dropped simultaneously.}
<B>__{wide}
<A>__{white foam boils from the bow of the albatross as she crashes through the waves.}
<B>__{at the wheel}
<A>__{alice smiles and puts her arms around skipper's waist. it's coming together. foretop same skipper stands at the rail, looking out. the seas are up and the masts are pitching widely from side to side. chuck is high above the deck in the footropes, wrestling with one of the squaresails. the pitching mast catches him by surprise and he slips. he tumbles down, tangled in the lines. a rope wraps around his neck, choking him. robin looks up and sees him hanging helplessly.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{bill!! skipper!!}
<A>__{robin freezes. skipper leaps into the rigging like a spider and, in a few seconds, wrestles chuck free and carries him down to the deck. chuck coughs, catching his breath. the color is gone from skipper's face. this was a close call.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{you all right?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{it was my fault. i slipped.}
<A>__{alice examines chuck, making sure he's okay. skipper turns to robin, who is shaken. he never raises his voice.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{why didn't you go up there?}
<A>__{robin stands silently.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{speak up.}
<A>__{still nothing from robin.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{he's afraid to climb.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{what?}
<P>__{(to robin)}
<D>__{is that true?}
<A>__{robin looks away.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{why wasn't i made aware of this bill?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i didn't know sir.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{it's your job to know. if something goes wrong up there, the other eighteen people aboard can't be wondering if he's gonna do his job or not.}
<A>__{skipper returns his gaze to robin, measuring him. finally.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{swing up, son.}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(trembling)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{up you go. right now.}
<A>__{robin reluctantly pulls himself up onto the first rung, then the second. he stops and steals a peek up. the mast is swaying. he freezes, his lip starts to tremble. all eyes are on him. phil chuckles.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{do you have something to say?}
<C>__{phil}
<P>__{(smug)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{then keep your mouth shut.}
<A>__{phil backs off, stunned. robin can't move.}
<C>__{skipper}
<P>__{(to robin)}
<D>__{what's it going to be?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i'm sorry...}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{sorry won't cut it.}
<A>__{robin holds on frozen. skipper turns to the crew.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{survival means discipline and assimilation. there are no special cases here.}
<P>__{(to robin)}
<D>__{now, get going. get up there.}
<A>__{humiliated, a tear slips down his face. excruciating.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{what are you blubbering about?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i don't know...}
<A>__{skipper jumps onto the backside of the ratlines. his face is but inches from robin's.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{one hand in front of the other son. we'll do it together.}
<A>__{robin reaches for the next rung. he looks down. skipper growls at him.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{don't look down. look in my eyes! climb! we'll do it together.}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(sobbing)}
<D>__{i can't.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{you climb damn it, or so help me i will haul you to the foretop by your diaper and leave you there!}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{aaauuuhhh!!!}
<A>__{skipper gets right in his face and snarls.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{are you hating this?! are you!}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i hate you, you son of a bitch!!!}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{no. hate the fear inside of you! climb like a man mister! hate it! hate it away. hate your way up one more rung!! do it right now!!}
<A>__{with every ounce of strength, robin reaches for one more rung screaming as he reaches. skipper climbs and screams with him.}
<C>__{together}
<D>__{auuuggghhh!!!!}
<A>__{robin clutches the rung with a death grip. then, he looks down. his bladder releases. hot urine runs down his legs and splashes, steaming, onto the deck. the crew is horrified. robin weeps.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{oh, god...}
<A>__{skipper backs off.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{don't hate yourself. hate your weakness. all right. get down.}
<A>__{robin climbs to the deck and falls in with the others, mortified.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{i'm only gonna say this one time. i'm not here to wipe noses and asses. i'm not your mother. trust funds and blue blazers don't get you a thing out here. you wanna act like babies, then get off my boat.}
<A>__{stunned, the crew is speechless. chuck instinctively goes to help robin. skipper snaps like a turtle.}
<C>__{skipper}
<P>__{(to chuck)}
<D>__{he can take care of himself.}
<P>__{(to others)}
<D>__{any other 'phobias' i need to know about?}
<A>__{skipper fires a look towards phil.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{excellent. bill, find mr. weathers a position to suit his condition.}
<A>__{skipper turns and then stops.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{remember something, sooner or later... we all have to face it.}
<C>__{chuck}
<P>__{(aside)}
<D>__{face what?}
<A>__{the question hangs in the air like a cloud.}
