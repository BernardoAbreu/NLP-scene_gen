<L>__{interior waiting room day}
<D>__{martha follows sister marguerite into a grilled waiting room.}
<A>__{sister moves off, leaving martha looking around curiously. then the mother miriam arrives from behind the grilled door, sees martha, sighs exasperatedly and enters giving martha a slight start.}
<C>__{mother superior}
<P>__{(beaming at her own little joke)}
<D>__{doctor livingston i presume? i'm mother miriam ruth. you needn't call mother if you don't wish.}
<P>__{(shaking hands)}
<D>__{most people find it uncomfortable.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{well... i...}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<P>__{(carrying right on)}
<D>__{i'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{yes... i...}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{you can call me sister.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{... thank you.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{you must have tons of questions. you may smoke if you want to. just don't tell any of the sisters. martha sits; mother miriam gets her a box of matches.}
<C>__{mother miriam }
<D>__{they wouldn't understand, especially sister marguerite. she'd scare the pants off queen elizabeth.}
<P>__{(she lights martha's cigarette)}
<D>__{besides, i miss them.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{you were a smoker?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{two packs a day.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{i can beat that.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{unfiltered. martha inclines her head impressed. mother miriam sits down}
<A>__{next to her.}
<C>__{mother miriam }
<D>__{well, you have questions.}
<P>__{(checks her watch)}
<D>__{fire away...}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{who knew about agnes' pregnancy?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{no one.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{how did she hide it from the other nuns?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{she undressed alone... she bathed alone.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{is that normal?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{how did she hide it during the day?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<P>__{(indicating her habit)}
<D>__{she could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{we're examined once a year. her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{who was the father?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{i haven't a clue.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{what man had access to her?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{none as far as i know.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{was there a priest?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{yes, but i...}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{what's his name?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{father martineau, but i don't see him as a candidate.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{could there have been anyone else?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{obviously there was.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{and you didn't try to find out who?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{believe me, i've done everything possible short of asking agnes.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{why haven't you asked her? mother miriam removes a tray from under a pot plant and}
<A>__{brings it back to}
<D>__{use as an ashtray.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<P>__{(sitting again)}
<D>__{she can't even remember the birth. do you think she'd admit to the conception?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{look, someone gave her the baby.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{yes, but that was some ten months ago. i fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{why do you think that?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{don't ask me those questions dear, i'm not the patient.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{well i'm the doctor. i'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{look doctor, i don't know how to tell you this politely, but i don't approve of you. not you personally...}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{the science of psychiatry.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{exactly. i want you do deal with agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. she won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.}
<C>__{martha}
<P>__{(also standing)}
<D>__{i am not with the inquisition.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{and i am not from the middle ages. i know what you are! i don't want that mind cut open. then mother miriam walks out.}
