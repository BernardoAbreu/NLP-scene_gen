<L>__{interior tortupe room day}
<A>__{frank's view, from the corner of the room. we hear the sound of julia and prudhoe's approach up the stairs.}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<D>__{this your place?}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{let's not talk about it.}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<D>__{no personal details, right?}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<D>__{you know, you're incredible }
<A>__{julia opens the door.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{come on in. make yourself at home.}
<A>__{she steps inside. prudhoe does as he's instructed. he stares at the bare floor, as julia closes the door behind him.}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<D>__{there's no bed.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{i prefer the floor.}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<D>__{first time for everything, right?}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{julia moves towards him}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{why don't you take off your jacket? you're warm.}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<D>__{yeah, why don't i?}
<A>__{she slips the knot of his tie. we can hear her pulse on the soundtrack. she glances over prudhoe's shoulder. he follows her gaze, but she diverts him with a peck on the cheek.}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<P>__{(takes over his undressing)}
<D>__{why don't you do the same?}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{maybe i will.}
<A>__{prudhoe, now starts to shed his jacket and trousers, trying not to take his eyes off julia for an instant. we watch from frank's p.o.v. as he drops his underwear. he still wears his shirt, which he starts to unbutton. we move back into a tighter shot.}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<P>__{(voice slightly slurred)}
<D>__{you know, you're very beautiful.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{am i?}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<D>__{you know you are. loveliest woman i ever set eyes on.}
<A>__{julia smiles. prudhoe stops unbuttoning his shirt.}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<D>__{oh christ.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<D>__{too much drink. better empty my bladder.}
<A>__{she steps out of the way so that he can cross to the door.}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<D>__{i will be a moment.}
<A>__{as he moves to the door, she throws a piece of cloth off a hammer, which lies beside the wall. prudhoe takes hold of the door handle. turns it: it's stuck.}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<D>__{the door's stuck.}
<A>__{before he can turn she hits him on the back of the head. he doesn't fall, but the blow sends blood down the back of his shirt. to avoid the following blow he stumbles blindly towards the wall but julia's not going to be stopped now. he holds the back of his head dazed, apologetic, pitiful while she moves towards him.}
<C>__{prudhoe}
<D>__{don't ... i ... please ... i'm sorry ...}
<A>__{she eclipses him.}
<D>__{... i'm so sorry ...}
<A>__{she raises the hammer.}
<D>__{... i don't understand ...}
<A>__{she strikes him. he slides down the wall, his jaw broken, blood pouring from his face. he twitches. then the twitches stop. she drops the hammer, and stares down at the corpse.}
<C>__{julia}
<D>__{enough?}
<A>__{the room sighs. in the corner, frank's shadowy form leans forward.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{don't look at me.}
<A>__{julia backs towards the door, as the broken, skeletal form crawls out of darkness to claim its sustenance.}
