<L>__{exterior desert later}
<D>__{amelia lumbers heavily, carrying debbie asleep on her arm. mike drags his feet a few yards behind. they walk for a long stretch through the thorny brush until they reach a small mound where a leafy mesquite grows. amelia lays a limp debbie down on the ground and sits on the mound of earth.}

<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{we're going to rest here for a while.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{what if there are snakes?}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{no, there aren't any. come, lie down. the boy, exhausted and docile, obeys and lies on her chest. amelia leans against the trunk with debbie on her legs. the children sleep while amelia, nodding off, tries to keep watch.}
