<A>__{in the moonpool, bud surface with an explosive gasp beside the full of flatbed. his wracked breathing is masked by the whine of hydraulics as coffey uses the external controls to extend flatbed's big hydraulic arm, locking the geek mirv in its gripper. bud strokes to a point where coffey can't see him and heaves up out of the water onto the deck of the pool. he lies gasping behind cab one's cradle. his limbs are wooden and unresponsive from the cold. his fingers are completely numb. he hugs himself, putting his hands under his armpits. scans the situation. he can't get to the door, which is across the room, without coffey seeing him.}
