<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior laboratory day}
<A>__{the lab is buzzing with the usual activity. linda rolls up sebastian's sleeve, revealing nothing.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{hold still.}
<A>__{she wraps a bungee cord around the nothing and pulls it tight. she then sprays the inside of his elbow with dye.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<P>__{(contentious)}
<D>__{how much blood do you think you've taken so far?}
<A>__{the surface of his skin sheens in the light as linda searches for a vein. she slaps his arm several times, then plunges a hypodermic needle into his skin.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{not enough to worry about.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{every day... feels like you're sucking me dry.}
<A>__{linda presses down on the hypodermic plunger, releasing a dye into his bloodstream.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{it's funny. all these years i've known you, i never pegged you for a megalomanic.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{the shoe being on the other foot. you getting to run things.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i didn't ask for this, caine. but when a classified experiment disappears in the middle of the night, someone's gotta run the show.}
<P>__{(tries sympathy)}
<D>__{look, i know how hard this has been for you.}
<A>__{he knocks her arm away and pulls the hypo, out of his arm.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{don't patronize me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and for the record, you've got no idea what it's like. i get up every morning and you people stick needles in me. you bombard me with radiation until i vomit. and then at six it's over for you. you get to go home. but sebastian is still here. sebastian can't leave, or else. that's the worst part, you know. here i have this ... this gift and i can't even use it.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{now it's a gift?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{you're goddamn right it's a gift. and if you weren't so goddamned short sighted, i'd be out there right now trying to master it.}
<A>__{sebastian looks around at the other scientists staring at him. he tosses the hypo with the needle onto the instrument tray and heads toward the door.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{where're you going?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{looks like i'm going nowhere.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{come on, man. we've got a ton of tests scheduled today.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{do them yourself.}
