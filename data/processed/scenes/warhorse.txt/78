<L>__{exterior countryside village trench. the same.}
<A>__{joey is free in countryside but there is blood pouring from his leg, clearly torn by his encounter with the tank. he runs on it is becoming night suddenly there are explosions to the left of him this fast, elegant creature simply runs through the gaps between explosions. but as he charges on the sky lights up in the direction he is heading. he is suddenly in the thick of battle. a shell explodes next to him, and he leaps entirely over a trench. another explosion sends him leaping, but not far enough he finds himself crashing downwards, and into a trench and he races through it and finds himself charging towards a german company. both sides are equally startled joey charging through a thin trench lined with german soldiers the soldiers, finding a live horse careering through them. in desperation, joey scrambles out of the trench and once again, rushes away from the fighting... but now it is very dark indeed he is stumbling as he runs there is blood mixed with the mud on his legs. now it is total night fog confusion he jumps again. and now everywhere there are potholes the land is massively uneven shells are exploding all around. and suddenly sees in front of him barbed wire. he crashes through it more he bursts through again now dragging barriers behind him the barriers tangle, pulling him up short he flips and lands amongst even more barbed wire. he pulls and turns to release himself but it is impossible. the more he pulls, the more firmly he is trapped. he rises up, wild, magnificent, a beast fighting for his life. he is completely trapped. he cannot move. he cannot see. he is in pain. he falls. it feels like an end.}
