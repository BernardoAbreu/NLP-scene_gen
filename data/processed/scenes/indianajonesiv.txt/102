<C>__{scraggy}
<D>__{he do not know exact place... but it is somewhere over there.}

<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{but whattayou do with it?}
<A>__{scraggy asks tyki. the energetic pygmy places the mirror against an upright stone. tyki adjusts the mirror, until it faces the distant mountains. tyki emits a high pitched giggle. pointing to the mirror. everyone gathers around the mirror. the sound track music soars. the mirror reflects the clouds above the mountains. but above one specific mountain, we see the image of a city reflected on the clouds! indiana turns away from the mirror, looking at the specific moontain. but the city is only reflected in the magical mirror! clare smiles at indy, quoting tyki from earlier.}
