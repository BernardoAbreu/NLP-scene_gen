<A>__{ and we're back in blade's charger as campbell continues to hammer away at the windshield. the windshield spiderwebs. campbell manages to get a clawed hand through blade swings his shotgun over, shoving it in campbell's snarling mouth. he pulls the trigger boom! campbell's cinder remains blow over the cracked windshield. blade hits the wipers, spritzes window cleaner but the mess turns to ashen sludge. making the view worse!}
