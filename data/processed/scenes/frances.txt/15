<A>__{lillian is watering tomatoes in the dark and talking to them quietly. as ernest approaches, she senses him and grows silent. she speaks without turning around.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{you're poisoning that child's mind.}
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{i have a right to talk to her. she's my daughter, and she's beginning to understand why i've sacrificed so much in order to achieve...}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{you've sacrificed?! if you'd practice law for decent folk instead of communists and indigents }
<C>__{ernest}
<D>__{they need help, lil. they pay me back in other ways.}
<C>__{lillian}
<D>__{how? what do they do for you, kaminski and his friends? they're all anarchists! traitors!}

<C>__{ernest}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{that's a thought, lil. that sure is a thought.}
