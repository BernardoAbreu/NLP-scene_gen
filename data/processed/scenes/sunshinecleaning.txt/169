<A>__{mac looks at the unresponsive door with irritation. he shifts his weight and jangles some change in his pocket.}
<L>__{interior rose's house living room night}
<A>__{rose leans against the wall with eyes closed.}
<C>__{mac }
<D>__{rose?}
<A>__{she takes a breath, opens her eyes, then opens the door.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{hey beautiful.}
<A>__{mac smiles for the both of them.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i was starting to think you were on a date or something.}
<A>__{rose looks at him like he's speaking a foreign language.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{rose nods.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{long day.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{can i come in?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{it's not really a good time.}
<A>__{mac sags a bit. then rallies. flexes an eyebrow.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i got you something.}
<A>__{mac pulls a small gold box from his pocket and presents it to rose. the top is engraved with her initials.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{it's for your business cards. you put `em in there and, i don't know... impress people.}
<A>__{he laughs at the silliness of the whole concept.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{it's beautiful.}
<A>__{rose stares at the small shiny box. it seems to make her sad.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{you don't like it?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{no, i like it very much.}
<A>__{rose looks up and mac senses something bad is coming his way.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{it's just this thing we're doing.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{come on, let's not do that.}
<A>__{but rose is resolute. she looks mac in the eye.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i don't want this anymore.}
<A>__{disbelief gives way to the unpleasant understanding.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{so that's it?}
<A>__{rose gives an almost imperceptible nod. mac tries hard to ignore the rising slurry of hurt and anger.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{that's it then.}
<A>__{mac hesitates, hoping for a last minute reprieve. finally, he nods and rose watches him walk away.}
