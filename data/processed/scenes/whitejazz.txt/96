<L>__{interior bedroom later}
<A>__{lying there, staring at her. a silence and peace i've never known. not once.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{tell me anything. tell me everything.}
<A>__{label her surprise, her brow that furrows and unfurrows just as quickly. a long moment as she waivers...commits:}
<C>__{glenda bledsoe}
<D>__{where would i start?}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{why here?}
<C>__{glenda bledsoe}
<D>__{why l.a.?}
<P>__{(this amazing smile)}
<D>__{why is anybody here? want the rest of the world to know who they are.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{you?}
<C>__{glenda bledsoe}
<D>__{no...i don't think so.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i just love it. i grew up in seattle. my aunt, every week, she'd take me to the movies.}
<A>__{me watching her...tucks her hair back over his shoulders.}
<C>__{glenda bledsoe }
<D>__{the idea that you can outlive yourself...that a part of you goes on, long after you're gone.}
<P>__{(beat, grins)}
<D>__{sounds silly doesn't it? `attack of the atomic vampires' being }
<C>__{me}
<D>__{ your ticket to immortality?}
<A>__{make her laugh. swear a thousand silent oaths to protect her. he face slowly goes dark.}
<C>__{glenda bledsoe}
<D>__{hughes told me he could get me in for this screen test two years ago. movie with gregory peck at universal. he thought he was humoring me...until i got it. they offered me the role...there in the room. so howard, who i'm sure never thought in a million years i'd land that part, makes some phone calls and just like that they don't want me anymore.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{nobody calls now. i can't get in to see any studio casting people. he's ruined me in those circles.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{and you still want it }
<C>__{glenda bledsoe}
<D>__{ bad enough to put on a silly cheerleading skirt and try to make the most god awful dialogue sound decent.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{surrounded by winos in werewolf suits.}
<P>__{(she laughs, i laugh)}
<D>__{that's...dedication.}
<C>__{glenda bledsoe}
<D>__{or desperation. depends on the day.}
<A>__{the laughter ebbs, her eyes still shine.}
<C>__{glenda bledsoe }
<D>__{i will get there though.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i will get there.}
<A>__{i let the silence take...try not to shatter it with:}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{dwight gillette.}
<A>__{she doesn't blanch.}
<C>__{glenda bledsoe}
<D>__{he asked me to take his `niece and nephew' to their cousin in oxnard. these beautiful, funny little kids.}
<P>__{(tears she doesn't swipe)}
<D>__{i dropped them off. didn't ask any questions i believed dwight. a week later i saw their pictures in the post office. a week after that their little bodies came in on the tide near san pedro.}
<P>__{(beat, tears stream)}
<D>__{i will never shake the thought that maybe those poor kids thought i was part of it. that i knew what was going to happen to them. so i pray to god that he let them look in when i put that knife into dwight.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but i will never ask his forgiveness for doing it...}
<P>__{(beat, clears her eyes)}
<D>__{why do they call you `enforcer?'}
<A>__{she actually gets closer, i can feel her breath on me.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{i've killed 44 men.}
<A>__{she blanches, but never blinks...never takes her eyes away from mine.}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{33 for war. 2 for principle. 9 for profit mostly. why did you sign with hughes, knowing what he was?}
<C>__{glenda bledsoe}
<D>__{`for profit mostly.'}
<A>__{silence. a feeling like: `and there we are...'}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{i'm not much good.}
<C>__{glenda bledsoe}
<D>__{me neither.}
<A>__{she touches my quake. two breaths with her hand on mine and it all goes quiet: the shakes, the images, the fear. she takes my head, pulls me to her bare breasts. the only things audible: my breathing, a clock ticking. both slowly fade out.}
<B>__{black.}
<A>__{wake up quiet, look at my hamilton. 6 am. sit up slow. look back at her, sleeping, just stare. i lean down, kiss her lightly, her taste lingers, inhale her, hold that...it's the last good thing you'll get today.}
