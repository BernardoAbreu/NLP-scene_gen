<C>__{pi}
<D>__{help!! somebody help me!!}
<A>__{pi sees movement animals running. he scrambles toward them, the ship groaning as it lists sideways. oxen and deer are visible on the far side of the deck, backlit by emergency lights; pi hears monkeys screeching, the clatter of hoofs pounding. in the distance, sailors shout orders in panicked voices. pi comes onto the lower deck, where he sees three men the buddhist (taiwanese sailor) from the dining hall; the japanese captain, and sailor #1 arguing with the french cook, who has climbed into the stern of one of the lifeboats that hangs off the side of the ship. pi runs to the captain.}
<C>__{pi }
<D>__{please save my family!}
<C>__{japanese captain}
<D>__{don't scare. okay? wait stay here.}
<A>__{he grabs a life vest and starts to put it on pi.}
<C>__{japanese captain }
<D>__{here, put this on!}
<C>__{pi}
<D>__{you have to help them, please! oh no my family, please. you have to help them, my family is back there.}
<C>__{japanese captain}
<D>__{we don't have time.}
<A>__{the taiwanese sailor jumps onto the ship.}
<C>__{taiwanese sailor}
<D>__{we help. you must go.}
<C>__{pi}
<D>__{who let all the animals out?}
<A>__{they shove a life vest over pi's head.}
<D>__{sailor #1 you have to go now.}
<C>__{pi}
<D>__{no wait! my father he can't swim }
<C>__{japanese captain}
<D>__{this is your last chance just go!}
<C>__{pi}
<D>__{no please!}
<A>__{they guide pi to the side, where a section of the ship's railing has been removed to give access to the lifeboat. they push pi over the edge; pi falls onto the lifeboat, bouncing on the protective tarp that is still stretched taut across the bow. he grabs at the rope holding the bow, trying not to slip off. the sailors are shouting at the french cook, who stands at the stern.}
<D>__{sailor #1 hey! you! what are you doing?!}
<C>__{french cook}
<D>__{loosen the lines! bring it down! sailor #1 tie it down! tie it down!}
<C>__{french cook}
<P>__{(to the sailors:)}
<D>__{jump! jump!}
<A>__{the sailors look towards the upper deck. pi follows their looks and watches in horror as a zebra launches itself over the side of the ship, careening through the air toward the safety of the lifeboat. the french cook staggers backward and jumps out of the way, falling to the water below. pi throws up his arms as the life boat starts to drop. the zebra arcs through the air, missing the tarp, landing on the exposed stern with a sickening thud, shattering the rear bench. the force sends the rig lines spinning. the lifeboat plummets to the water below. the impact spins it around, nearly washing pi overboard. he is left clinging to the back of the tarp, the zebra on the floor of the lifeboat before him. as the lifeboat drops down the side of the swell, pi slides to the front of the tarp. the tsimtsum's propeller rises behind him. as pi steadies himself, a swell lifts the lifeboat, crashing it onto the deck of the tsimtsum. it drops back into the sea, rolling over completely. the vessel instantly rights itself the lifeboat is designed to be virtually unsinkable. pi lands on the lifeboat's floorboards, next to the zebra. pi sees the tsimtsum at an angle, it's bow dipping below the water. as he tries to get up, pi notices the orange emergency whistle that dangles from the vest. he grabs it and blows, shouting between blasts.}
<C>__{pi}
<D>__{help! help! somebody, help me!}
<A>__{the deck lights of the freighter glow with a cheery, unnatural brilliance. by the light of the ship, pi can just make out a distant figure in the water.}
<C>__{pi }
<D>__{hey! over here!}
<A>__{pi spies a lifebuoy tied to a rope. he grabs it and heaves it as far as he can across the water. out in the water, the lifebuoy splashes a few yards away from the shadowy figure. the moment pi feels the tug on the line, he jumps into the uncovered part of the boat, lies back and begins hauling the rope in. nearly finished, he lifts his head to peer over the side and sees who he's rescued.}
<C>__{pi }
<D>__{richard parker?}
<A>__{a beat and then pi realizes what he's done. he scrambles backward in horror, trying to throw the rope overboard.}
<C>__{pi }
<D>__{no! go away!}
<A>__{richard parker paddles toward the boat. pi grabs an oar, wielding it against the approaching tiger. richard parker tries to grab the oar. pi yanks the oar away, falling onto his back. he listens as richard parker claws his way up the side of the swaying boat, coughing and gagging water. pi scrambles backward, oar still in hand. he rises and jumps overboard.}
