<L>__{exterior the double divide day}
<A>__{pilgrim bursts out of a chute and into the riding arena. he runs to the far end and abruptly stops. tom is holding the orange flagstick, and coiled rope, coming through a gate into the arena, crossing to the middle of the ring. something in his demeanor tells us that fun and game are over. pilgrim and tom stand there, motionless, eyeing each other. pilgrim snorts and takes a few, small steps backward. tom takes a beat, then starts slowly towards pilgrim, lifting the flag and "cracking" it. at the sound, pilgrim whirls away from him and runs, around the arena. he starts to slow, looking at tom. again, tom cracks the flag and pilgrim runs, round and round the arena... like a ringmaster, tom keeps pilgrim moving, cracking the flag. something about tom's demeanor tells us it isn't going well.}
