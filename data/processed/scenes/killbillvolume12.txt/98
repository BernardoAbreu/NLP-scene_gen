<C>__{the bride }
<D>__{what l.f. o'boyle didn't know was, the real game was just beginning. bill was on the job, and she was the target. now bill was the greatest assassin of the 20th century. in fact the term hitman was coined for him. and he rarely performs actual assassinations anymore. however every once in awhile to keep his hand in he does. only he plays a game. he doesn't start big trouble...he lets them start it. if they do, they're dead. if they don't, not only won't he perform, he'll take the hit off the market. it's kind of fun watching people gamble when they don't know they're gambling, isn't it?}

<C>__{l.f.}
