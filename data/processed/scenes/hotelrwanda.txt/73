<A>__{the convoy speeds through the deserted streets. slowing only to maneuver through makeshift roadblocks where militia wave machetes, nailed clubs and spears as they dance. further along the road: a group of militia swarm over a car, smashing the windshield, the windows. inside a family huddles together in terror, waiting for the windows to give way. in the gutter by the side of the road, three dead bodies.}
