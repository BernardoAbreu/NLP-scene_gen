<A>__{jimmy pulls his piece of shit into the driveway of what appears to be a one story house, next to a range rover. he climbs out with the strap of his backpack hanging over one shoulder and walks around the house to the back yard. the yard slopes significantly from the front yard to the back yard, and the view of the back of the house reveals two stories. as jimmy turns the corner, he spots a black cat walking up to him. he grabs the cat.}
