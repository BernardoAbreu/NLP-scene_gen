<D>__{you can't close the maple branch!}
<C>__{chris parker}
<D>__{i know that maple's where you got your start, but if i don't lay those people off then i get laid off. it's a vicious cycle.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{you don't have to if you don't want to.}
<C>__{chris parker}
<P>__{(deadly serious)}
<D>__{if we don't close these branches than kbi will buy our competitor instead of us and put us all out of business. if you want to be an executive and get to do fun stuff like your microloan project, then you also have to be the bad guy who lays people off. that's why we get paid the big bucks. to make the hard decisions.}
