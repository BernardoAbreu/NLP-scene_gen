<L>__{exterior office park facility night}
<A>__{kyle has to swerve to avoid the stolen bus, which is now on its side, in flames. it was taken out by an automated skynet tank, one of three tanks here. they're positioned to take out escaping vehicles. but the atv is a small, maneuverable target, swerving and speeding crazily. a tank fires and misses, the blast taking out a chunk of wall. kyle whoops, heading across the campus one tank pursues, it moves surprisingly fast, capable of flattening anything in its path. marcus fires at it, but the plasma rifle blasts don't have much effect on the armor. the tank fires again, but kyle roars around a corner, just in time. however, in so doing, he nearly runs over marcus, from earlier, on his way to the time sphere, visible in the headlights for only an instant before he leaps}
<B>__{out of the way.}
<A>__{kyle, focused on the pursuing tank, didn't even see this. but star did. she looks wide eyed at marcus beside her.}
<C>__{star}
<D>__{that looked like }
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i know. long story.}
<A>__{play the chase, as the tank pursues the atv through the facility. kyle takes his vehicle through a large fountain, which the tank smashes to bits. kyle oversteers, putting them up on two wheels, then recovers, narrowly avoiding plasma blasts, which obliterate the facade of a building. skeletal terminators appear in their headlights, weapons raised. marcus stands and fires over kyle's head, blowing them out of the way. near the park, marcus points.}
<C>__{marcus }
<D>__{take that path!}
