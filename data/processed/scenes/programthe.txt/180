<A>__{joe brings the wolves up.}
<C>__{harvey }
<D>__{ball on the yellow jacket 35. 17 seconds left. kane barking signals.}
<A>__{joe takes the snap, drops to pass, finds no one, rolls away from the rush. just as he's about to go out of bounds, he fires a bullet down the sideline. ray griffen catches it and goes out of bounds at the twelve.}
<B>__{angle on sideline}
<A>__{joe runs over to coach winters, knowing they have no more time outs, as the refs move the chains.}
<C>__{harvey }
<D>__{field goal here ties it, but a tie may not get the wolves into a bowl. tough decision for winters.}
<C>__{winters}
<P>__{(to joe)}
<D>__{you want me to send in the kicking team or you think you can handle it?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{give me the ball.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{o.k., let's do 24 inside slot, left blue lightning.}
<B>__{on field}
<A>__{joe races back out onto the field and into the huddle, as the crowd's roar goes off the charts.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(in huddle)}
<D>__{o.k., 24 inside slot, left blue lightning. let's put the women and children to bed, and go lookin' for fuckin' dinner. on 2.}
<A>__{he starts the wolf howl. the others join in, howling for all they're worth, eleven jacked up warriors. they clap and break the huddle. the crowd is standing, waving fists in unison toward the georgia tech end zone. joe looks up in the stands again at the seat he left for his father. it's still empty.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{this one's for you, dad.}
<A>__{joe starts to call signals as bud lite sings "bali hi." we go to slow motion as the ball is snapped. the georgia tech defense fires off the line, throwing everything at joe. joe drops back five steps. bud lite picks up a blitzing linebacker, knocks him over a fallen player. joe looks for darnell in the corner, but another pass rusher breaks through, forcing joe out of the pocket. it's wartime as tackles and blockers collide, hand fight, go down, scramble up, collide again, all in pursuit of joe. darnell, realizing joe's in trouble, breaks off his pattern and heads to the center of the end zone. joe dodges one tackler, shakes free of another's ankle tackle, heads back for the center of the field. he spots darnell breaking between defensive backs. just as he's buried by two massive linemen, joe fires a rocket down the middle toward the sliver of open space that darnell is heading for. the ball barely clears the hands of a lunging linebacker. darnell and two defensive backs, one from each side, close on the ball as it cuts through the air, a perfect spiral. darnell dives. the two defensive backs dive. the ball passes between their outstretched hands by a fraction of an inch, landing in darnell's. he clutches it to his chest, rolls over, holds the ball up for the ref to see. touchdown! this time darnell does go into his touchdown dance.}
<B>__{angle on stands}
<A>__{pandemonium. the crowd including autumn and her dad goes crazy. winters just gives a few quick nods, watching almost wistfully as the players and coaches hug each other, knowing none of them will hug him. joe, bud and the others mob darnell.}
