<A>__{gordy looks up in surprise at him and the thin federale backing him up.}
<C>__{fat federale}
<D>__{you'll have to come with us.}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{fat federale}
<D>__{come with us, please.}
<A>__{he clamps a hand on gordy's arm. gordy shakes it off and starts running. almost immediately, he's tackled to the ground by the thin federale. two more federales join in. gordy's not gonna go down easy, though. even as only one against four, gordy's a formidable challenge. he's strong, and he's committed all the way. he's not getting kicked out of this country again. it's not a clean or artful fight. there's no karate. it's four men trying to tackle a bull, and... the bull gets away.}
