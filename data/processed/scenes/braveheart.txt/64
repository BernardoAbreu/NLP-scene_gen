<L>__{exterior scottish woods night}
<A>__{the moon is high above the scots, encamped for the night. most everyone is sleeping, but william sits leaning against a tree, lost in lonely thoughts. suddenly william freezes; a shaft of moonlight illuminates a cloaked woman standing twenty feet ahead of him. something about her is familiar and then she pulls off the hood, revealing her auburn hair, cascading in the moonlight... it is marion!}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{marion! is... is it you?}
<A>__{joy explodes on his face, and he runs to her, but stops before he touches her, as if she might evaporate.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{i'm dreaming.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{yes, you are. and you must wake.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{i don't want to wake. i want to stay with you.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{and i with you. but you must wake.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{i need you so much! i love you!}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{wake up, william. wake up!}
<C>__{hamish's voice}
<D>__{wake up, william!... marion hamish wake up!...}
<A>__{william clutches at marion, but his arms can't enclose her.}
<B>__{he wakes}
<A>__{lying on his new tartan, in camp, with hamish shaking him, william's arms clutched empty to his chest.}
<C>__{hamish}
<D>__{william! hounds!}
<A>__{wallace jumps up, hearing the distant barking that alarmed hamish. stephen, the new irish recruit, races up.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{we must run in different directions!}
<C>__{hamish}
<D>__{we don't split up!}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{they used hounds on us in ireland, it's the only way!}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{he's right, hamish! campbell! divide them and run!}
<A>__{shoving groups of men in different directions, wallace then takes off. his group is about a dozen; they race through the woods, dodging trees, running aimlessly. they stop and listen. the barks are getting closer.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{split again!}
<A>__{again they divide, and race in different directions. but no matter how they run and dodge, the barks grow nearer. we intercut : with the approaching of the dogs a large pack of hounds, with keepers like on a fox hunt, and behind the dogs, lord pickering, with his soldiers, prepared for a long chase, cloaked against the wet darkness, carrying torches. wallace and others pause, hear the dogs, and run again, in a new direction. the hounds are relentless. wallace's group is down to hamish, stephen, and faudron.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{no matter how we go, they follow. they have our scent. my scent.}
<C>__{faudron}
<D>__{run! you must not be caught!}
<A>__{faster now, faster. the barks are getting very close. wallace and his friends are starting to panic. the blood beats in their ears, their breath scalds their lungs. and we move in on wallace's eyes. he stops, gasping.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{we can't stop!}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{they've tricked us.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{what's the crazy man saying, lord?}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{the dogs have a scent. my scent. someone must have given it to them.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{who would do such a thing?}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{exactly.}
<A>__{wallace pulls out his dagger...}
<B>__{the dogs}
<A>__{bark frantically now; they smell a kill; they tug so hard at their leashes that the handlers are almost dragged along.}
<C>__{handler}
<D>__{be ready! we have them!}
<A>__{the soldiers grip their weapons, ready to take their prisoners. they burst into the little clearing; the dogs find a body, stabbed, his throat cut; the dogs plunge their snouts into the gore, yipping wildly. the handlers must fight furiously to tear the dogs from the body. lord pickering approaches the body and looks down. it is faudron, mangled now but clearly identifiable with the scarf he gave william, in place of william's own, tucked into his shirt.}
<C>__{lord pickering}
<D>__{damnation! damnation!}
<A>__{as pickering rants, his men look at the darkness all around.}
<C>__{lord pickering}
<D>__{after him! get them going again!}
<C>__{handler}
<D>__{their noses are drowned in new blood, they'll follow nothing now!}
<A>__{and just as the realization hits pickering that he can't pursue wallace any further, a cloaked figure mixed in among his men leans in from behind him to whisper...}
<C>__{stephen of ireland}
<D>__{the almighty says for you to give his regards to the devil.}
<A>__{pickering's eyes go wide, then roll back as stephen's dagger slides expertly through his back ribs and into his heart. as pickering falls and his men realize what has happened, stephen has already run back into the trees. pickering's men freeze at this sudden turn of events. even the dogs whimper, picking up the rising fear of the men around them. then from the darkness all around them comes a chorus of demonic, bloodcurdling yells }
<D>__{wallace hamish stephen arrrrrggggggghhhh!}
<A>__{three wild men tear out of the darkness from different directions, their swords slashing. pickering's men panic and run, their dogs yelping, and the other soldiers, evident by their torches, fell with them in all directions. wallace, hamish and stephen are left alone in the heart of the woods, howling, barking like dogs, snarling like wolves and then laughing like hyenas!}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i thought i was dead when ya pulled that dagger!}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{no english lord would trust an irishman!}
<C>__{hamish}
<D>__{let's kill him anyway.}
<A>__{they laugh again; then wallace's laughter leaks away, and he stares into the trees, where he saw marion in his dream. various shots the story spreads through scotland... two men are talking in a village...}
<C>__{villager}
<D>__{...and william wallace killed fifty men! fifty, if it was one!}
<A>__{the same tale is exchanged by two farmers at a crossroads...}
<C>__{farmer}
<D>__{a hundred men! with his own sword! he cut a through the english like }
<A>__{the tale is repeated in a tavern...}
<C>__{drinker}
<D>__{ moses through the red sea! hacked off two hundred heads! drinker #2 two hundred?!}
<C>__{drinker}
<D>__{saw it with my own eyes.}
<A>__{and the rumors are discussed even inside the palace grounds in london, where the prince and his friends are trying on elaborate attire presented them by fawning tailors, and the princess, ignored by her husband, strolls and chats with her handmaiden, nicolette (in subtitled french).}
<C>__{nicolette}
<D>__{when the king returns he will bury them in those new clothes. scotland is in chaos. your husband is secretly sending an army north.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{how do you know this?}
<C>__{nicolette}
<D>__{last night i slept with a member of the war council.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{he shouldn't be telling secrets in bed.}
<C>__{nicolette}
<D>__{ah, oui! englishmen don't know what a tongue is for.}
<A>__{the princess blushes, whacks her with her fan, and smiles.}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{this scottish rebel... wallace? he fights to avenge a woman?}
<C>__{nicolette}
<D>__{a magistrate wished to capture him, and found he had a secret lover, so he cut the girl's throat to tempt wallace to fight and fight he did.}
<A>__{the princess is pained at such cruelty; nicolette warms to share the juicy gossip...}
<C>__{nicolette}
<D>__{knowing his passion for his lost love, they next plotted to take him by desecrating the graves of his father and brother and setting an ambush at the grave of his wife. he fought his way through the trap and carried her body to a secret place! now that is romance, oui?}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{...i wouldn't know.}
