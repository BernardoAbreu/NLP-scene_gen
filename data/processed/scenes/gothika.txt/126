<A>__{lunch time for the female wing. an excited shelley rushes over to a table where chloe and jenna are, whispers something to them. they glance at the door. a moment later, miranda walks in with her police escort. taking her across the cafeteria towards the back door. an uneasy pete leads. irene and the wardens at the rear. miranda glances at the women staring at her like a specimen. like somehow she's even more dangerous than them. top dog, as it were, of the crazies. and then, halfway across the room, one of the women stands up. chloe. she claps her hands together. slowly. miranda watches her, confused. and slowly shelly, jenna and others rise as well. all of them joining chloe in clapping.}

<D>__{she's a hero. little red riding hood put the big bad wolf in a coma.}
<A>__{pete nods. just what he needed. the officers trade looks.}
<D>__{officer #1 they're not gonna start something, are they?}
<A>__{irene shakes her head, amused.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{you ain't scared of a bunch of women now, are you, officer?}
<A>__{the entire cafeteria is on their feet showing their solidarity for miranda. chloe locks eyes with her, mouths the words "thank you." and miranda is hauled out the side door.}
