<L>__{exterior highway on ramp day}
<B>__{on old woman}
<A>__{as she pushes her supermarket cart up the on ramp. a squeaky wheel is shrill and disturbing. drivers of several waiting vehicles avoid staring at her weathered face as she passes. up ahead waiting in line, is kimberly's red suv.}
<B>__{up ahead}
<A>__{waiting in line, is kimberly's red suv.}
<C>__{shaina }
<D>__{watch it!}
<A>__{kimberly accidentally kisses the bumper in front of her while daydreaming. she calls out to the driver in front:}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{sorry! my fault!}
<A>__{shaina looks over, concerned. in the backseat, the guys dano and frankie laugh hard and some of frankie's milkshake comes out of his nose.}
<C>__{shaina}
<D>__{want me to drive?}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{no, i'm good.}
<A>__{shaina looks at kimberly as a hand suddenly hits kimberly's window. kimberly spins around, startled. kimberly stares transfixed at the old woman, who stares back with chilling intensity. the kids ad lib "let's go" and "fucking freak." the old woman's plastic bag breaks, sending oranges rolling down the on ramp. the old woman breaks eye contact with kimberly as she rushes to retrieve them. the signal turns from red to flashing yellow. kimberly pulls the su v onto the highway, looking in the side view mirror to see the old woman look up at her in slow mo.}
<C>__{frankie}
<D>__{dano, shouldn't we go back and help your mother?}
<C>__{dano}
<D>__{blo w me.}
<B>__{cu on kimberly}
<A>__{as she looks back from the mirror and reacts to an ominous electronic road sign that flashes "warning: construction next 180 feet".}
<B>__{nissan suv}
<A>__{kimberly merging into traffic, nearly collides with a speeding yellow mini bus carrying a high school football team. kimberly nervously jerks the wheel to the right, then realizing she's speeding towards the road construction barrels, she swerves back left, right behind the mini bus at the last moment.}
<B>__{close.}
<A>__{kimberly pulls around the mini bus as rowdy football players tackle each other, yelling:}
<C>__{football players}
<D>__{pile up! pile up! pile up!}
<A>__{kimberly flicks on the radio and we hear highway to hell by ac dc at earsplitting volume. kimberly and shaina jump from the shock and reach to lower the volume. kimberly, disturbed by this, hits seek an oldies station. a grisly car crash from nervous norvus' transfusion album.}
<C>__{dano}
<D>__{christ, is this tribute to princess di day or what?}
<A>__{kimberly passes a car weaving on her right. the driver reaching into the back seat to quiet a barking dog hanging on its head out the window.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<P>__{(unnerved)}
<D>__{jesus, all the crazies are out today.}
<A>__{a cloud passes kimberly's head. she smells it and turns around, taking her eyes off the road to see dano smoking a jointerior}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{i told you no drugs in the car! my dad will freak!}
<A>__{dano and frankie exchange looks, god, what a geek!}
<C>__{dano}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{calm down, kimmy. it's not drugs, just weed.}
<C>__{frankie}
<D>__{yeah, you should have specified.}
<A>__{kimberly turns to shaina, helpless. shaina spins around, her eyes wordlessly tell dano, i know she's a priss, but put it out. then kimberly's cell phone rings. she hits the speaker button.}
<C>__{mr. burroughs }
<D>__{kimberly? it's dad.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{hey, dad. what's up?}
<A>__{dano defiantly blows more smoke toward kimberly, then breaks into an unexpected coughing fit looking over to see a hells angel laughing at hi m. the biker's trashy girlfriend, also laughing, quickly flashes her tits at dano over:}
<C>__{mr. burroughs }
<D>__{your car's leaking either transmission or brake fluid. i want you to have it checked asap at a gas station.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{you got it, dad. i will call you if i have a problem.}
<C>__{mr. burroughs }
<D>__{i mean it. take care of it.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{i will, dad. bye, luv you.}
<A>__{kimberly passes a station wagon on her right, the driver squinting at a map while driving. a mattress and some furniture tied to the top shift as the wagon hits a bump.}
<C>__{shaina}
<D>__{um, kimberly, your dad's not gonna call like every ten minutes is he?}
<A>__{before kimberly can answer, dano sees a chp speeding up behind him. he lowers the joint at once.}
<C>__{dano}
<P>__{(hiding bag of weed in pants)}
<D>__{shit! there's a cop behind us. pull into the right lane now!}
<A>__{kimberly, scared, does as she's told nearly colliding with a speeding flat bed semi hauling a huge load of logs ! a horn blasts. the truck swerves. then speeds by on the right. a coiled chain drops down to the highway.}
<C>__{dano}
<D>__{look first, idiot!}
<A>__{shaina turns up the radio and leans over to kimberly.}
<C>__{shaina}
<D>__{ignore 'em.}
<B>__{on log truck}
<A>__{one end of the rusty chain holding the logs in place rattles on the pavement, sparking. looking in her rearview mirror, kimberly turns pale the cop pulls in behind her.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{dano, put that out now.}
<A>__{dano takes one last drag and flicks the joint out the window. it bounces on the windshield of a ford expedition to their left.}
<B>__{inside the expedition}
<A>__{kat, 28, very corporate america, wears a navy blue power suit and speaks into a phone headset while smoking a cigarette.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{no, i'm stuck on jury duty so i won't be able to pitch the campaign. let's get silverstein to come in and...}
<A>__{kat sees the joint that smoulders in the dried leaves beneath her windshield wipers. a moment later, a small flame crackles.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{what the hell? no, not you.}
<A>__{kat flicks on her windshield wiper fluid, successfully putting out the joint, but her worn wipers smear ash and fluid around, impairing her vision. kat turns and looks at dano, dead serious all of a sudden. staring straight ahead.}
<C>__{dano}
<D>__{what's the cop doing? did he see that?}
<A>__{kat sees the tailgating chp, smiles, then resumes her conversation.}
<C>__{kat}
<D>__{forget it, i will call him myself.}
<A>__{kat hangs up, then looks down at her cell phone, squints and dials a number...}
<B>__{pan off kat to officer thomas burke}
<A>__{early 20's, rookie cop, who seems to have missed the entire exchange.}

<A>__{thomas speaks into his radio.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{i was supposed to be off today. how did i get screwed?}
<C>__{dispatcher }
<D>__{no biggie. drake called in sick.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{copy that.}
<P>__{(switches off; annoyed)}
<D>__{go on, sleep it off drake.}
<A>__{thomas tries to sip from a mcdonald's coffee cup on the dashboard, but it's too hot. he places it back on the dash. the vibrations of the road make the coffee cup slide closer and closer to the edge of the dashboard. back to kimberly's suv dano nervously looks back.}
<C>__{frankie}
<D>__{relax, dude.}
<A>__{but kimberly still looks uneasy as her dashboard "check engine" light begins flickering. kimberly spots a road sign next service 18 miles.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{this trip better be wor th it. what's the guy girl ratio again?}
<C>__{shaina}
<D>__{get ready to smile, five guys per girl.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{i can live with thaaaa }
<A>__{kimberly stops mid sentence when the white van in front of her suddenly slams on its brakes and pulls onto the shoulder for no reason. kimberly screams, swerving around the van just in time to avoid an accident. frankie instinctively shouts at the van.}
<C>__{frankie}
<D>__{what's your problem, ya fuckin' crack baby?!}
<B>__{inside the white van}
<A>__{isabella cruz, late 20's and very pregnant, drives a delivery van full of funeral wreaths, crosses and classic rose urns. most are marked: in memory of flight 180. she chokes back sobs into a cell phone as she pulls over.}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{...couldn't keep your dick in check for another month? i knew this would happen when i got pregnant.}
<A>__{she pounds the steering wheel, furious.}
<C>__{isabella}
<D>__{what'd the doctor say? i have to come in to test for stds? goddamn you, jorge.}
<A>__{a crate in the back of her van topples over and crashes and a flurry of sunflower petals sails out the window. isabella jumps in surprise and, wiping tears from her eyes, rolls up the windows as petals shower the visor of eugene, the harley rider, who smears the petals (and some squashed bugs) around his visor and drops back.}
<B>__{inside nissan suv}
<A>__{kimberly falls back into the right lane and looks uneasy as she sees a truck driver guzzling from a flask as it passes the suv, revealing its side is an ad for firestone tires. it finally clears frame, revealing a highway billboard that reads, "drunk driving kills." kimberly reaches back and pulls on her seatbelt in spite of laughter from the back seat. up ahead, the rusty chain seems to have more give to it. logs strain against it. suddenly, a black cloud of exhaust from a blue '83 chevette in front of them causes everyone to roll up their windows. oil drips from its rusty exhaust pipe. the thick exhaust blinds kimberly.}
<C>__{frankie}
<D>__{gas it around these idiots. we do have 1200 miles to go, you know.}
<A>__{kimberly tires to enter the passing lane, but she's blocked by a suburu wagon. in the front seat, a seven year old kid is sadistically smashing two toy cars together. kimberly passes the suburu and pulls up to a pacer. the harley roars by, startling her.}
<B>__{inside pacer}
<A>__{nora kesner, 35, and her son tim, 15. tim drums on the dashboard with two ten ounce naya bottles.}

<D>__{tim, will you cut that out? i can't even hear myself think.}
<A>__{tim frowns and then winces, holding his jaw.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{damn, it really hurts, mom.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{i know, we'll be there soon.}
<A>__{tim drops the naya bottles on the seat. one of them quietly falls to the floor, rolls a bit, finally settling under the brake pedal.}
<B>__{inside nissan suv}
<A>__{kimberly is still behind the smoke spewing chevette. she passes it on the left. frankie rolls down his window.}
<C>__{frankie}
<P>__{(yells to driver)}
<D>__{ever hear of the ozone layer, asshole?}
<B>__{inside chevette}
<A>__{rory, 27, leans down to snort a line of coke off a def leppard cd case. s he looks up to see the patrol car is now behind him, he reflexively taps the brakes. rory, eyes like saucers, sits rigidly transfixed at the wheel and nonchalantly wipes the cd clean on his pants.}
<B>__{inside nissan suv}
<A>__{she has dropped back behind the chevette and chp car and is running down along side of a black trans am. up ahead she sees the hig hway patrol car flick on its lights and pull into the shoulder around the chevette and behind the semi loaded with logs.}

<A>__{as thomas pulls in behind the log truck, his coffee cup lurches forward, spilling hot coffee all over his lap and the floor.}

<D>__{yeah. who does he think he is? knight rider?}

<P>__{(laughs; then)}
<D>__{who?}
<A>__{frankie leans out and tosses milkshake on evan's window.}
<C>__{dano}
<D>__{you know, hasselhoff before he did baywatch.}
<A>__{evan, pissed off, flips off frankie. the windshield wipers smear around the thick milky fluid. the sun blinding him.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{what's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to daytona?}
<C>__{shaina}
<D>__{how does a nice mature fuck sound?}
<A>__{kimberly laughs, then leans in close to shaina.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{hey, thanks for talking me into this trip. ever since my mom... i dunno, i just feel like i'm starting to live again, you know?}
<A>__{shaina smiles in understanding.}
<B>__{inside police cruiser}
<A>__{thomas bends to wipe up the mess. he only glances at the road as he tries to soak up the coffee. suddenly up ahead, the rusty chain snaps! the logs roll off the side of the truck onto the highway. one bounces as it hits, and slams through thomas' front winshield and out the back, taking thomas' head with it. eugene slams on his brakes. his harley slides out and he is slammed to the ground, sliding at 60 miles per hour across the highway, right in front of the yellow mini bus. the mini bus driver brakes to avoid eugene. the football players tumble forward and hit him in the head. he loses control and slides off the road onto the grass median. he blows a front tire and the mini bus begins to flip, rolling several times int o the oncoming lanes of traffic, and is hit by a}
<B>__{mack truck.}
<A>__{eugene slides into a huge log, and hits it with a sickening crunch. only to be hit and crushed by his sliding motorcycle. rory looks up too late and rear ends thomas' car, exploding the gas tank and hurling rory's dead body halfway through the windshield where it remains half in half onto the hood. kat, dialing, looks up, slams on her brakes, but skids on oil from the chevette. she swerves into kimberly, side swipes her, then swerves to miss a huge log only to run head on into two more, flipping the expedition end over end right next to kimberly. kimberly swerves back from being hit by kat, just in time to see a huge log ahead. she tries to turn hard to the right to avoid it, but hits it broadside sending the suv flipping over the top of the log and sliding down the road. inside, shaina, dano and frankie are tossed around like rag dolls, shredded by glass and shrapnel frankie is ejected out the side window. kimberly's suv slides to a stop on its side. she looks back to her mangled but still alive friends and up in time to see nora's pacer nora sees the collisions ahead and slams on the brakes but the fallen naya bottle prevents her from braking, and she slams into the back of kat's expedition. the crash test dummy collision folds her pacer and it explodes into a huge fireball. evan, blinded by the smeared windshield, is too late. he swerves his trans am around the burning cars onto the wet grass. kimberly sees the topless trans am slowly roll out of a huge wall of fire and coast to a stop. evan comes up battered and bloody but still alive. he is trapped in his burning car, screaming and trying to release the seatbelt. then, just when she thought it was over, a huge semi slides thro ugh the wall of fire, smashing the trans am out of the way, spinning it like a top. with the back sliding at 90 degrees it keeps on coming. kimberly's pov the semi's grill comes right at her!}
