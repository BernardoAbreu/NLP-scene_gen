<A>__{a pretty green communal garden. children are playing, watched by mothers, one of whom holds a new baby in a papoose. a very old couple wander along slowly. a small tai chi group moves mysteriously. and as the camera glides, it passes a couple sitting on a single, simple wooden bench overlooking the garden. he is reading, she is just looking out, totally relaxed, holding his hand, pregnant. it is william and anna.}
