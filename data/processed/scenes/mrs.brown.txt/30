<A>__{some hours later. it is now raining. a gaggle of royal grandchildren hurry out of a carriage from their afternoon recreational while their nannies frantically try to keep them dry under the umbrellas. john brown stands tall and erect on the gravel while they rush around him, laughing and giggling.}
