<A>__{in a paved area, adjacent to the yellow wall which marks the dalai lama's private grounds, the opera festival has begun. this festival involves performances by tibetan singers, dancers and actors. it looks to be a joyous occasion; officials and their wives are dressed in their finest and sit before beautifully laid picnics. children run here and there, amidst the monks and nomads, the swashbuckling khambas from eastern tibet (large people, with heavy braids wrapped in red cloth on top of their heads). there are westerners, nepalese and sikimese. dancers dressed in wild, colorful outfits spin and leap in time to the eerie, tibetan music. atop a low building on the yellow wall, stands an elaborate enclosure draped in yellow silk. the dalai lama sits inside it.}
