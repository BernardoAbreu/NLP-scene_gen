<L>__{interior laboratory day}
<A>__{leopold and kate sit calm and resolute. the doctors are in an uproar.}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<D>__{this is outrageous! i won't allow it!}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{the decision is not yours to make.}
<C>__{dr. plodder}
<D>__{do you realize what you're saying? you're tampering with fate, preordinance, and god himself.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{we do that every day, doctor. it is called choice.}
<C>__{dr. kau}
<D>__{dr. carlson is still over there. you can't simply abandon her. we have to get her back.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{do you think i'm not aware of that? do you think a minute goes by that i don't feel responsible for her? but someone else can go.}
<C>__{dr. kau}
<D>__{only one person can return. the capsule accommodates only one person. leopold has to find her.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{perhaps she does not wish to return. perhaps she's found greater happiness in her new life. it happened to me.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{maybe this is her destiny. maybe she's of more important use back there.}
<C>__{dr. kau}
<D>__{julia carlson died in the center factory fire of 1897, two years after she arrived. she was 37 years old.}
<A>__{there is a stunned silence.}
<C>__{dr. drake}
<D>__{dear lord.}
<C>__{dr. kau}
<D>__{she was a friend, kate. she was never expected to sacrifice her life for this experiment. i won't be a party to it. i know what i'm asking... there's no way we can force you to go. just think it over.}
