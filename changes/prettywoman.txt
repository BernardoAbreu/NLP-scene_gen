She crosses to the kitchen where she takes coffee can/piggy bank from the shelf.  She puts some more bills into it, places it back where Kit will find it. She turns and starts again for the door. She stops.  She hears something.  MUSIC.  An aria from La Boheme.  Faint.  Seemingly coming from nowhere.  She dismisses it -- she's hearing things.  She opens the door.  Stops.  The music is louder and getting louder now -- it's not her imagination.  She hurries over to the window.}

Everywhere on the street people are staring; the BUMS, the PUSHERS, the PASSERBY'S, the TOURISTS. Vivian doesn't know whether to laugh or cry. The car comes to a stop in front of the Vivian's building. Vivian's landlord comes out the front door.  His eyes go wide in disbelief. Edward disembarks from the limo by coming up through the sunroof.  He leaps nimbly to the ground.  He crosses to the entrance of the alleyway, looking up at Vivian on the fire escape.}
