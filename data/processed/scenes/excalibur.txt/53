<L>__{exterior forest day}
<A>__{arthur charges through the shadowy forest. he is in armor, but it is only a light tunic of mail. excalibur is sheathed in a leather scabbard by his side. he is frantic and he calls urgently.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{...merlin... merlin...}
<A>__{his face shines with sweat, the horse is lathered. he dismounts and continues on foot into denser, more tangled undergrowth.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{merlin!}
<A>__{a huge eye opens in the foreground of what had appeared to be shadow, bark and tufts of weeds is really merlin's head.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{you called, sir?}
<A>__{his voice is thin as he is awakening from a deep, exhausted sleep. arthur finds him lying within the large gnarled roots of a great tree. the boy kneels before merlin and lifts his hands and kisses them.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you saved me from the arrow...}
<C>__{merlin}
<P>__{(a flicker of mischief)}
<D>__{but not from your destiny.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i want to thank you.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{that's not why you came.}
<A>__{arthur blurts it out:}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{merlin, help me. i need your help. i don't know how }
<C>__{merlin}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{'help me, help me.' help me get up.}
<A>__{arthur helps merlin up and the wizard stands unsteadily.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{i'm tired. doing magic takes its toll, you know. my arms ache terribly...}
<P>__{(he makes flying}
<D>__{movements with his}
<P>__{arms and grimaces)}
<D>__{once or is it yet to happen i stood exposed to the dragon's breath so that a man could lie one night with a woman. it took me ten moons to recover. i'm sure that story would interest you, since... well, we'll have to talk about it another time. you're too busy now.}
<A>__{the forest groans and creaks, alive with murmurs and shrill calls.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{it is whispered in the forest that...}
<P>__{(he cups his ear with exaggeration)}
<D>__{...leondegrance's castle is under siege by lot and uryens.}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(pressing)}
<D>__{yes, yes, i know that. everybody does. lord leondegrance is my only ally among the barons and the great knights. i can't lose him.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{well there. you don't need me half as much as you think you do. you already know what must not happen.}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{i must find the means to save him, then. i was hoping i could ask you for a little magic help, but if it makes you so tired...}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{silence. arthur tries again.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{it's just that i have no experience, and no men to speak of. how can i }
<C>__{merlin}
<P>__{(suddenly fierce)}
<D>__{because you must! you and only you. have you forgotten that it was you who freed excalibur?}
<A>__{just as suddenly, he is his amused, ironic self again.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{besides, it will be a good lesson.}
<P>__{(giggling)}
<D>__{the best, if it's not the last.}
<A>__{arthur bows his head, confused and almost defeated. merlin steals a look at him, and puts his arm around the boy.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{maybe you'd like to meet the power that gave you the sword?}
<A>__{he enjoys being cryptic.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{how? where?}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{in the great book.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what book is that?}
<C>__{merlin}
<P>__{(melodramatic)}
<D>__{the book without pages. open before you, all around us. you can see it in bits and pieces, for if mortal men were to see it whole and all complete in a single glance, why, it would burn him to cinders.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what?!}
