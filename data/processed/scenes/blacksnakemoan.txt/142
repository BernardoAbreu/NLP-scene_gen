<L>__{interior lazarus' home afternoon}
<A>__{r.l. hands rae a glass of water. she is seated on the sofa, wrapped in a quilt.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{r.l.}
<P>__{(sits next to her)}
<D>__{i gotta ask you. why do you think laz is keepin' you chained like this?}
<C>__{rae}
<P>__{(shrugs at first, then:)}
<D>__{you know how, like they say, you save someone's life, you responsible for them. guess he just don't think it's safe for me.}
<C>__{r.l.}
<D>__{so he got it into his head that the only thing gonna keep you from endin' up bleedin' on the side of the road again, without a stitch of clothing on is...}
<P>__{(r.l. yanks on the chain)}
<D>__{you think he's crazy for thinkin' that?}
<A>__{rae struggles to answer. something is on her mind.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{you a preacher?}
<C>__{r.l.}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{can i ask you a question?}
<P>__{(r.l. nods)}
<D>__{people always say, you gotta get good with jesus, if you want not to go to hell. that you say sorry for all you done and... and jesus would let you go on to heaven.}
<C>__{r.l.}
<D>__{you could put it that way.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{but that's so fuckin' stupid.}
<P>__{(she catches herself)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. didn't mean to curse.}
<C>__{r.l.}
<D>__{what's on your mind?}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{you can't hurt people... and then just say, i'm sorry, and then everything just gets washed away. why would heaven want people like that. people who... do what they want and then... switch.}
<C>__{r.l.}
<D>__{i'm gonna tell you somethin', and it's just gonna be between you and me.}
<P>__{(rae anxiously nods)}
<D>__{i think folks carry on about heaven too much. like it's some all you can eat buffet up in the clouds. and folks just gonna do as they're told so they can eat what they want behind some pearly gates. i can go to shoney's for that.}
<A>__{rae grins. r.l. leans closer.}
<C>__{r.l.}
<D>__{there's sin in my heart. there's evil in this world. but when i got no one... i talk to god. i ask for strength. i ask for forgiveness. not for peace at the end of my days when there's no more life to live and no more good to do, but today. right now.}
<A>__{rae has never had anyone talk to her like this. she is listening. she is understanding.}
<C>__{r.l.}
<D>__{what's your heaven? what gives you peace?}
<A>__{rae looks at her bare feet. she tries to respond but the pain in her chokes back the words. tears come to her.}
<C>__{rae}
<P>__{(struggling to speak)}
<D>__{ronnie.}
