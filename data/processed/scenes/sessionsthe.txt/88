<L>__{interior motel room. day}
<A>__{mark and cheryl are lying together. he has his eyes closed. there is something on her mind.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{you awake?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{to answer your earlier question, i grew up in salem, brought up catholic, like you, but the church didn't appreciate my attitude towards sex.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you had an attitude towards sex?}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{yes, i liked it. they like to think they threw me out, but i threw them out. so for years i didn't believe in anything, and now i'm converting to judaism.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i guess it's good to have some kind of insurance.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{i didn't think of that.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{then why are you doing it?}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{my husband asked me to do it before his grandmother dies. the idea is, if it makes her happy and him happy, then it will do the same for me. our son is neutral on the subject, but theoretically, if it looks like it makes me happy, it'll make him happy too. that's the way my husband's family talks, and thinks. the fact that i'm happy already, doesn't seem to be relevant.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{what's your son's name?}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{tony. he's 14 years old and very smart. you'd like him.}
<A>__{cheryl and mark lie together in contented silence for a while.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{does he know what you do?}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{he knows i'm a sex therapist. there's a certificate on the wall. but he hasn't had sex yet. so... how much can he really know? he's not a boy, he's not a man.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{how much do you want him to know?}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{well, i want him to have some idea in his head. i hope it's a nice one.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{what does your husband do?}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{he's a philosopher.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{wow! you mean, like, at a university?}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{no, in his own mind. he runs the house, plays guitar, thinks a lot.}
<A>__{she notices the time.}
<C>__{cheryl }
<D>__{it's kind of late.}
<A>__{she gets up and starts to get dressed.}
<C>__{cheryl }
<D>__{hey, we did really good stuff today. you were fantastic. you're a fully fledged male homo sapiens endowed with a handsome and substantial penis which now has a proven track record. you should be pleased.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{was i really inside you?}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{you were really and truly inside me.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{for how long?}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{five or six seconds.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{is that all?}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{that's a long time for some people. you were pretty excited. i don't know what you were thinking about.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i couldn't tell one thing from another. it was all a jumble of sensations.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{well, you definitely achieved penetration. it was penis vagina all the way. and you definitely get an a for orgasm.}
<A>__{she is ready to go. she comes over to mark and kisses him on the cheek.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{did you come?}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{no, mark, i didn't.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{can we try for that next time?}
<A>__{she hesitates for a moment.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{if that's what you want.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes, that's what i want.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{okay then.}
