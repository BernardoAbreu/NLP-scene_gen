<A>__{orson welles, elegant and impressive, is flourishing a cigarette and a coin in his magnificently expressive hands he is perfecting a magic trick. welles is lounging on the bed of an enormous guest suite at san simeon. he is wearing a tuxedo. in the bathroom beyond him we can see the writer herman mankiewicz ("mank". ) mank is a wonderful wreck of a human being. 43 years old, but looking considerably older, he is short and squat and bitter. a compulsive gambler and drinker, mank still glimmers with wry humor that is equally wicked and corrosive. he is incomplete without the stub of a cigar clenched in his teeth. mank, also dressed in a tuxedo, is looking at himself in the bathroom mirror as he struggles with his bow tie. he occasionally glances in the mirror to welles. title: january 3, 1940}
