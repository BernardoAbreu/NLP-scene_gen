<L>__{exterior recon ship days later}
<A>__{a dumbbell nebula slowly twists in space. wall e is mesmerized by it. leads his eye to a light, growing in the distance ahead. a planet? no. a starliner. gigantic in size. the "axiom". the now tiny recon ship heads straight for it.}
<L>__{interior docking bay}
<A>__{two tug rockets guide the ship in. it locks into giant braces fixed on the deck. the impact knocks wall e off. he lands in the scaffolding of the front brace. suddenly the entire dock comes to life. robotic arms and service robots of all types appear. ...rise from the floor... ..lower from the ceiling... it's a cacophony of automation. they all attend to the ship.}
<B>__{eve}
<A>__{and four other probes slide out of the ship's side. suspended in a horizontal rack. wall e is surprised to find her facing him. she remains shut down. just a few feet away with a giant abyss between them.}
<D>__{wall e ee vah... ?}
<A>__{a squad of cleaner robots emerge onto the dock. a small roller brush bot (m o) leads.}
<D>__{m o}
<P>__{(beeps)}
<D>__{[hold up.]}
<A>__{waits for the floor lines to appear. depict their exact path of action.}
<D>__{m o}
<P>__{(beeps)}
<D>__{[okay. go.]}
<A>__{they file out on the line. a crane bot lowers eve from the rack. m o and his cleaning crew stand ready. m o scans eve. on m o's display pov scan reads: "%16 foreign contaminant." m o is disgusted. revs his brush roller. moves in for the clean. a vacu bot follows after him. then a spray bot and buffer bot finish off. the cleaning crew waits for probe #2. wall e studies the routine. figures out a way to climb down to eve. when the crane returns, wall e poses as probe #3. the crane grabs him instead. m o turns around to clean the next probe. wall e is lowered in front of him. boxes up. confused, m o scans him. on m o's display pov scan reads: "%100 foreign contaminant." m o is horrified by such filth. a red siren light rises from his head.}
<D>__{m o [oh, no, no, no. this is all wrong.]}
<A>__{he scrubs wall e full force. wall e's front panel pushes him away. confused, m o moves to clean him again. wall e backs away. leaves a dirt trail. m o curses:}
<D>__{m o [you made the floor all dirty! stop it!]}
<A>__{m o furiously scrubs the floor. wall e peeks out, amused by this neurotic little guy.}
<B>__{on far wall}
<A>__{two steward robots come out of the wall. act like hovering caution signs. a small robot (gopher) shoots out a pneumatic tube. he bears epaulet like shoulders and a siren for a face. gopher beeps an electronic order for the stewards to follow. back on m o and wall e m o just finishes cleaning the floor. wall e is fascinated. impishly makes another mark. m o compulsively cleans it. can't resist.}
<D>__{m o [look, it stays clean. you got that?]}
<A>__{wall e wipes the bottom of his tread on m o's face. m o loses it. scrubs his own face. gopher and his steward escort arrive. the cleaning crew stand at attention. wall e boxes back up with the probes. gopher begins scanning each probe. moves down the line. scans wall e...moves on to the next probe... stops wait a minute. turns back. wall e is gone. gopher shrugs it off. proceeds... reaches eve. doesn't notice wall e hidden behind her. gopher scans her blinking plant light the entire dock goes to "code green"! alarms sound. green lights flash. all automation stops. in rapid succession... ...a hover transport glides up to gopher... ...a crane bot loads eve... ...curved energy bands lock her down... ...gopher assumes the driver's seat... it's all moving too fast for wall e. suddenly eve's transport heads for the elevator.}
<D>__{wall e ee vah!}
<A>__{wall e chases after them. grabs onto the back of the transport. they disappear into the elevator. the cleaning crew files out. follow their lines back to their hold. m o stops short. notices wall e's filthy tracks crossing his path. on m o's display reads: "foreign contaminant" the tracks lead to the elevator. m o's neurosis takes over. must clean dirt. he makes a radical decision and... ...jumps off his line. starts methodically cleaning the dirt trail.}
