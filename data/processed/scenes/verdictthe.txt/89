<L>__{exterior chelsea childcare day}
<A>__{two very young children walk across a play area. the door to the play area opens and joe galvin, in overcoat, comes in. he looks around the room, starts to walk across it. camera pans with him to reveal a woman, kathy, who is comforting a crying child. galvin walks over to her. stands a respectful distance away. she sees him watching her, looks up.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{galvin}
<D>__{hi. how are you doing?}
<A>__{she nods, happy to be working with the child.}
<C>__{galvin}
<D>__{i've been meaning to come in a long time.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{you live in the neighborhood?}
<C>__{galvin}
<D>__{uh huh. my nephew's going to be staying with us in a few months, so i stopped by.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{how old is he?}
<C>__{galvin}
<D>__{four. you're great with these kids.}
<A>__{she beams, caught unprepared in something that is a great point of pride with her.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{galvin}
<D>__{you're really...}
<P>__{(stops, remembering something)}
<D>__{you, are you the one they told me was the nurse?}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{who told you that?}
<C>__{galvin}
<P>__{(gestures back at the office, vaguely)}
<D>__{mrs...}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{mrs. simmonds.}
<C>__{galvin}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{kathy}
<P>__{(very serious, correct)}
<D>__{i used to be a nurse.}
<C>__{galvin}
<D>__{that's a wonderful profession. my daughter in law's a nurse. what did you do, stop?}
<A>__{kathy is lost in thought. this is obviously a very painful subject for her. beat.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{galvin, getting involved in a serious conversation, takes off his overcoat, he is going to stay awhile.}
<C>__{galvin}
<D>__{how come you stopped?}
<A>__{she is traumatized by the question. the casual conversation has become immediate and painful. she opens her mouth to speak, then stops, staring at galvin. he doesn't know what she is staring at... something on his jacket. he looks down. angle kathy's p.o.v. the shuttle ticket, boston new york, stuck in the lapel pocket of galvin's suitcoat.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{kathy and galvin. she realizes why he is there. she starts to cry quietly.}
<C>__{galvin}
<P>__{(beat; gently dropping his pretense)}
<D>__{will you help me?}
