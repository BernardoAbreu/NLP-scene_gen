<A>__{they head toward the strange looking plane. it's a single fuselage with two propellers...one at the nose, one at the tail. off the wings are two booms that connect to a rear wing. it's a burt rutan aircraft design. there is neither metal nor exposed exhausts for radar or if to spot. it does 200 knots at 22,000 feet. it'll fly, forever, 1,000 kilos of flake worth $23 million, and the total air weight is less than two bentleys. it's the smuggler's dream airplane.}
