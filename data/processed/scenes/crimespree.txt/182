<C>__{bonanno's voice}
<D>__{good. how'd he go?}
<C>__{zammito's voice}
<D>__{like the crying rat bastard that he was.}
<A>__{hadley stops the tape. he inserts another one.}
<C>__{zammito's voice}
<D>__{angelo, we can't lean too hard on this guy. he's a congressman.}
<C>__{bonanno's voice}
<D>__{i made peter dimiano a congressman. we pay him each month to look after our interests.}
<A>__{hadley grins. this is great stuff. he looks up at sami.}
<C>__{agent hadley}
<D>__{here you go, sport.}
<A>__{sami grabs the box and leaves. hadley starts whistling a tune and walks off the other way. as he reaches the tree line lamar pops out with two of his friends. all of them have guns.}

<C>__{agent hadley}
<D>__{you don't think i see through this? you tell sami he's dead.}

<C>__{agent hadley}
<D>__{you're making a big mistake. i'm an fbi agent.}
<A>__{hadley stares at lamar defiantly. lamar cocks the hammer back on his gun and presses the barrel to hadley's forehead. hadley drops the canvas bag. lamar picks up the canvas bag and runs away. hadley stands there fuming. lamar runs towards the statue and disappears behind it. angle behind the statue daniel is waiting, holding the other black canvas bag. as lamar passes they quickly exchange bags. from hadley's point of view lamar has merely run behind the statue as he heads for the street. lamar runs a few more steps, then stumbles and falls... several cassette tapes spill out of it. lamar's buddies are already at the street.}
<C>__{lamar's buddies}
<D>__{c'mon, man! let's get out of here.}
<A>__{lamar gets up, looks at the bag, pretends to be panicked. he runs off leaving the bag laying on the grass. on hadley: he can't believe his luck. he runs over, picks up the loose cassettes and puts them back in the bag, then leaves. on daniel: he peers out from behind the fountain, watching as hadley walks off in the other direction.}
