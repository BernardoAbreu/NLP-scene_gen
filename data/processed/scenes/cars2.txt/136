<D>__{so there i was: rocket jets going full blast, mcqueen hanging on for dear life when suddenly them two nasty lemons come out of nowhere, guns drawed. we was goners. but then out of nowhere, this beautiful spy car swoops in from the sky to save us!}
<C>__{minny}
<D>__{that's a very entertaining story, young man.}
<C>__{van}
<D>__{oh, minny, please. come on, none of this happened. rocket jets? flying spy cars?}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{no, you're quite right. it does sound a bit far fetched.}
<A>__{the crowd turns, sees holley, wings out, swooping in. finn is right below her, driving up the street.}

<D>__{guido believe you now.}
<C>__{flo}
<P>__{(to holley)}
<D>__{whoa, honey. you got a nasty dent there.}
<A>__{indeed, holley still wears the dent from when she saved mater from grem and acer.}
<C>__{van}
<P>__{(already crushing on her)}
<D>__{was that from when you swooped in and saved them in london?}
<C>__{minny}
<D>__{van!}
<C>__{van}

<D>__{yeah, sure thing. no problemo. just let me go get my tools.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{oh no no. i'm keeping that dent. it's way too valuable.}

<C>__{mack}
<D>__{those two are perfect for each other.}
<C>__{mcqueen}

<C>__{mater}
<D>__{explode in a fiery inferno?}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{we couldn't figure that one out either.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{our investigation proved that allinol was actually gasoline. and miles axlerod engineered it so that when it got hit by the beam it would explode.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{wait a second. fillmore, you said my fuel was safe.}
<A>__{mcqueen turns to fillmore. everyone does.}
<C>__{fillmore}
<D>__{if you're implying that i switched out that rotgut excuse for alternative fuel with my all natural, sustainable, organic biofuel just because i never trusted axlerod, you're dead wrong, man.}
<P>__{(re: sarge)}
<D>__{it was him.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{once big oil, always big oil. man.}
<C>__{fillmore}
<D>__{tree hugger.}
