<L>__{interior eve’s car day}
<A>__{eve gets herself turned upright and stares at chev, hair full of windshield glass.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{you weren’t lying.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{welcome to my life.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(head over heels in love)}
<D>__{no, i mean: that you were going to give it all up for me.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{oh. yeah.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{and the other part?}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{the poison? yeah, that’s true too.}
<A>__{he slams his fist against the wheel.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(cracking)}
<D>__{then... that means...}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{pretty much.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{how can we stop it?}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{adrenaline. it’s the only thing that slows it down.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(getting it)}
<D>__{so... when we were in chinatown...?}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{yeah. sorry.}
<A>__{a look of determination comes over her. she reaches for his crotch.}
<P>__{chev (cont’d)}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{this will get you going.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{come on, let’s finish what you started.}
<A>__{chev’s eyes flash to the rearview mirror and go wide. he grabs the back of eve’s head and pushes it down into his lap just as a bullet slices through the rear windshield and out the front. eve’s head stays down.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{oh boy...}
<A>__{chev is straining against the seat, evasive driving as she goes down on him.}
<P>__{chev (cont’d)}
<D>__{oh yeah, that’s... that’s really working for me...}
<A>__{eve’s head pops up.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(working him up)}
<D>__{you like that?}
<A>__{shots whiz by.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{stay down.}
<A>__{he pushes her head back down. chev’s heart is pounding like a jackhammer. he’s got himself arched into a crazy position, making it happen.}
<P>__{chev (cont’d)}
<D>__{that’s it that’s it that’s it... just a little...}
<A>__{eve’s head quickly pops back up. she pushes away.}
<P>__{chev (cont’d) (flustered)}
<D>__{what’s the matter?}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(satisfied)}
<D>__{so you can fall asleep like you always do? i don’t think so.}
<A>__{chev loses his mind. he slams the brakes to put the car into a slide, exposing his driver side to the pursuing sedan punches his gun hand out the window and blasts away. he nails the driver between the eyes... the window disintegrates... the sedan full of hoods skids into the sidewalk. steam pours from the radiator.}
