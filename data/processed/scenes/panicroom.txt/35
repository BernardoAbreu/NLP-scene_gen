<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{the man walks across the kitchen, shaking his head in exasperation at the packing boxes all around him. he goes to the front window, peers outside. he reaches for a light switch on his right. through the window, we can see the stoop light go on. then off, then on and off again. still through the window, we see the side panel door of the van slide open. two more men climb out. they are also dressed in dark clothes. they also carry satchels. they walks calmly across the street, grow large in the window as they approach us. the first intruder (who has a name, it's burnham) steps over to the kitchen door, runs his silvery strip through the gap. another hum and spark.}
<B>__{an alarm panel}
<A>__{flashes again. zone 1 disabled in the kitchen, burnham opens the kitchen door, letting the two other guys slip inside. raoul is a hulking figure whose back seems to rise up over the top of his slouching head; when he walks it looks like gravity does all the work, just pulling him forward. junior is much smaller, very high strung, dresses like a homey, very street, but can't hide the fact that the street is park avenue. they all freeze, staring at the moving boxes.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{fuck.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{a woman and a little girl, both asleep upstairs.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{fuck!}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{keep your voice down.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{they're not supposed to be here!}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{this was your department, junior.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{they're not supposed to be here!}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{that's why the key didn't work, they changed the locks.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{fourteen day escrow, man, that's almost three weeks! they shouldn't be here for another week! they don't own this house yet!}
<C>__{burnham}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{exactly how is fourteen days almost three weeks?}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{fourteen business days. escrow is always business days.}
<A>__{burnham sighs.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{i mean, right? isn't it?}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{you're an idiot.}
<A>__{raoul steps forward, shoves burnham with both hands in the chest.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{watch your mouth.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{it's okay, raoul.}
<C>__{burnham}
<P>__{(to junior)}
<D>__{who is this guy?}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{raoul is cool. that's all you need to know.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{this is insane. i'm outta here.}
<A>__{he starts for the door.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{wait a minute, wait a minute. we can still handle this.}
<P>__{(to raoul)}
<D>__{can we still handle this?}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{it's just the woman and the kid?}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{unless daddy comes back later.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{daddy's not coming back, she's in the middle of a divorce, it's just the two of them. we're okay, here.}
<P>__{(to raoul)}
<D>__{we can do this, right?}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{you're fuckin' a we can do this.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{not with me. not with people.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{forty five minutes. that's all you said you need. that's like nothing.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{she'll call the cops, they'll be here before i get unpacked.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{so we keep an eye on her. raoul can totally administrate that part.}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{no problem.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{i don't want raoul to administrate that part.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{they won't get hurt.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{what about us? what if she has a gun?}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{raoul, what in god's name do we do if she has a gun?}
<A>__{raoul pulls up his sweatshirt, revealing a .38 tucked into his belt.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{asshole.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{a guy shows you a gun, burnham, and you insult him? hey, who's the idiot? huh?}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{where did you get this clown?}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{i met him at the tables, same as you. and frankly, i'm grateful we have a little muscle right about now.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{what tables? i've never seen him before.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{different tables.}
<C>__{burnham}
<P>__{(to raoul)}
<D>__{the fuck did you bring a gun for?}
<C>__{raoul}
<D>__{you're welcome.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{peace out.}
<A>__{he moves for the door. junior, trying desperately to hold this together, gets there first, blocks the door with his back.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{we can't do it without you, burnham.}
<A>__{junior starts at burnham. raoul stares at burnham.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{it's still a good plan. it's just... got a twist.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{yeah. kidnapping.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{not if we keep 'em here. you can't kidnap somebody in their own house. it's just breaking and entering, unless we take 'em someplace. or something like that, i'm pretty sure.}
<C>__{burnham}
<D>__{pure idiot.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{i am. i'm an idiot's son. an idiot's grandson. i'm third generation idiot. but for once in my life i had a good idea, and i'm not giving up so easy. you are? are you actually telling me that for the first time in your life you're gonna throw your cards on the table and go home early? i can't believe my eyes.}
<P>__{(burnham hesitates)}
<D>__{fourteen million dollars upstairs, burnham. you'll be out of the hole. baby, you'll be so far out of the hole you could draw bricks every night for the next twenty years and still shit green.}
<P>__{(burnham sways)}
<D>__{come on, buddy. one more hand.}
