<A>__{muldoon runs down a long corridor, stop with a skid and yanks open the door to the garage. he runs out. his boots resound on the concrete. back on nedry's panicked face as he listens to the footsteps. wheezing, with great difficulty, nedry bends his knees and strains. with everything he's got, he lifts the incub ator waist height. and holds it. back on muldoon muldoon's footsteps echo as they come closer and closer to the garage. muldoon whips down the curve in the stairs. his jacket catches on an incomplete section of banister. yanks him to a stop. close on muldoon's jacket as it rips, stays caught. back on nedry as he tries to heave higher, can't. beads a sweat roll down his brow. muldoon frees his caught jacket and then keep going. nedry's face drips with sweat. the incubator slips out of his sweaty palms. catches it with his knee. nedry curses and with one forceful boost, he lifts the incubator shoulder height. close on muldoon's feet on long stairwell. boom. boom. boom. nervous, nedry breathes in a labored fashion. he looks this way and that. he closes his eyes and with one superhuman effort, he heaves the incubator into the back seat of the red jeep. nedry exhales. at that moment, muldoon enters the vestibule between stairs and garage. nedry eyes the shadowy figure in the vestibule. nedry's frightened face. muldoon stops and reaches in his belt. he pulls out his pistol. he takes out long, shiny cartridges. he loads the pistol. nedry leaps in the front of the jeep, pushing aside the rocket launcher, and zooms into the night. a moment later, muldoon enters the garage. he sniffs at the exhaust that still hangs in the air. he looks over and is surprised to see his jeep gone. he bends and inspects fresh tread marks. he looks up, his face straining to understand.}
