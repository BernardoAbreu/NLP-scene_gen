<B>__{afternoon}
<A>__{he is in a rocker on the porch. suddenly he stares out and stops rocking. faint in the distance, but coming closer, the clop clop of two horses, moving at a walk. a moment later jorgensen emerges and comes to stand beside mose, shading his eyes and squinting against the sun, still not recognizing the distant horsemen. he is joined by mrs. jorgensen. and then laurie comes out and she too stares, frowning at first, then with dawning realization. lars and mrs. jorgensen also begin to guess... to suspect... and then to know. and laurie starts to run. close shot moving with laurie the camera moves ahead of her as she runs blindly over the hard packed ground, running as hard as she can toward the still unseen but nearing horsemen. full shot the group ethan has debbie on the pommel of his saddle, his arm supporting her, and she is asleep. martin is riding beside them. laurie comes running up to stare at ethan and at the girl. he smiles and puts a finger to his lips cautioning her against waking debbie and then he rides by. laurie looks then at martin. he doesn't know whether to smile or not; he just waits. and then she is beside him and she steps onto his stirruped foot and vaults up beside him, and she kisses him just as she had on the day he left the graves to take up the search. and still holding her beside him, he rides slowly after ethan and debbie toward the house.}
