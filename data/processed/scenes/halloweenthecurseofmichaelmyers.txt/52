<A>__{loomis and wynn dash across a windswept field where a smith's grove medical transport helicopter awaits them. the deafening whine of spinning rotors as a technician refuels. the doctors step inside. the doors close and the helicopter lifts off, rising high above the cluster of the white coats below.}

<A>__{a blender whips up a revolting concoction of chocolate yoo hoo, banana yogurt and chewy gummi worms as tim, wearing levi's baggies and a "harry simms kicks ass" t shirt, raps on the phone.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{bro', i knew harry when we lived in the city. don't worry he'll be there. we've got everything arranged. get with me tonight at the fair and i will hook you up. peace.}
<A>__{tim hangs up, guzzling down his shake as debra navigates around him, setting out the breakfast dishes as kara tries to study. john, dressed in what might be a respectable business suit if it fit him better, mutters grumpily as he pours himself a cup of coffee.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{shitheads ... defacing my property. i showed them ...}
<C>__{debra}
<D>__{relax, john. they were just kids.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{kids are what's ruining this country. everywhere you go, it's the same. no goddamn respect.}
<A>__{tim lets out a huge belch as he finishes drinking his breakfast.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{see what i'm talkin' about?}
<C>__{debra}
<D>__{you'll never pass that exam on an empty stomach, kara.}
<A>__{debra snatches the book out of kara's hands.}
<C>__{debra}
<P>__{(continuing; reading)}
<D>__{cognitive therapy and emotional disorders? what are they teaching in college these days? the art of going crazy?}
<C>__{kara}
<P>__{(indignant)}
<D>__{it's called psychology, mom. living in this house is what's driving me crazy.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{who the hell told you to come live here in the first place?}
<A>__{kara rises, collects her books, trying to avoid a confrontation.}
<C>__{kara}
<D>__{i'd better get danny to school.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{she don't show her face for five years, then expects us to roll out the red carpet. you think going to college is gonna make up for your mistakes, girl?}
<C>__{debra}
<D>__{john, please don't }
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{yo', just lay off her, dad.}
<A>__{suddenly danny runs in, showing off in his dinosaur costume. roaring loudly. startling john.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what the fuck }
<A>__{kara immediately seizes danny's hand and ushers him toward the back door.}
<C>__{kara}
<D>__{let's go, danny.}
<C>__{debra}
<D>__{kara, wait. john. can't we all just sit down? try to be a family for once?}
<C>__{kara}
<D>__{i'm sorry, mom.}
<A>__{debra reaches into her purse and hands kara a couple of dollars.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{that's it, debra, keep slipping her the cash. while you're at it, why don't you just give her all our goddamn money?!}
<A>__{john explodes, dumping the entire contents of her purse onto the floor. debra recoils. kara steps in. danny is terrified.}

<D>__{stay away from her, you bastard.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(re danny)}
<D>__{i only see one bastard in this house.}
<A>__{kara flies at him with medea like rage. john instantly grabs her by the neck and shoves her violently against the counter.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{dad! let her go!}
<C>__{debra}
<D>__{john! stop it! stop it!}
<A>__{danny looks outside. frozen in horror. a voice whispers.}
<C>__{whispering voice }
<D>__{kill him, danny ... kill him ...}
<A>__{danny moves across the kitchen. mesmerized. through the screen door, the shape can be seen standing in the back yard. kara's eyes bulge as john squeezes her throat. choking her.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you ever raise your hand to me again, i will kill you, you understand?}
<A>__{john looks down to see the tip of a butcher knife pointed at his groin. danny is holding it his eyes dark, emotionless. ever so slowly, john releases kara. debra and tim watch in horrified astonishment. suddenly there's a knock at the back door. kara dives toward danny. the knife clatters to the floor as she picks him up, grabs her book bag and hurtles outside.}
