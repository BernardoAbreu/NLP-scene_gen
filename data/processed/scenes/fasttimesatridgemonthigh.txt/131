<L>__{exterior boy's locker room afternoon}
<A>__{damone exits the boys locker room. just as he does, he is accosted by the rat. we have never quite heard this tone in the rat's voice before.}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{damone? what happened between you and stacy?}
<A>__{damone feigns the attitude, shakes his head. damone sighs.}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{let me tell you something, rat. sometimes girls just go haywire. it was a month ago, i've been trying to think of a way to tell you ever since. we started messing around and...}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{... something happened. it's all over with. it's no big deal. i never called her again.}
<A>__{the rat says nothing.}
<C>__{damone }
<D>__{if you ask me, she's pretty aggressive. you understand what i'm saying?}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{no damone. i don't understand.}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{she wasn't really your girlfriend anyway.}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{hey fuck you damone. there's a lot of girls out there and you mess around with stacy. what have you got to prove?}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{jesus. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{i always stick up for you. whenever people say 'aw, that damone is a loudmouth' and they say that a lot i say 'you just don't know damone.' when someone says you're an idiot, i tell them 'damone's not an idiot. you just don't know him.' well, you know, damone, maybe they do know you pretty good. and i'm just finding out.}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{fine. get lost.}
<A>__{damone starts to push past him, but the rat shoves his shoulder hard.}
<C>__{damone }
<D>__{all right, rat. you want to do something about it?}
<A>__{damone begins the classic high school fighting ritual. he throws his books down. he takes a step back. he goes into a crouch. he gestures towards himself. then damone says the universally recognized high school fighting words.}
<C>__{damone }
<D>__{well come on.}
<A>__{the rat shows no fear. as other kids begin to crowd around the two boys, rat throws his own books down. he takes a step back, goes into the crouch. he gestures toward himself.}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{you come on.}
<A>__{they stand there, gesturing, neither one of them wanting to make the first move.}
<C>__{damone}
<D>__{no. you come on, you wuss.}
<A>__{assistant coach mr. sexton comes running out of the boy's locker room, and steps in front of the two boys.}
<C>__{sexton}
<D>__{hey! knock this crap off!!}
<A>__{the rat stalks off, disappearing into the crowd of onlookers.}
