<L>__{exterior british trench. night.}
<A>__{explosions light the dirty faces of british boys in uniform, one after the nexterior each light fading out before the next great blast illuminates another anonymous face then another and then another and then albert. hold on him for extra moments before he fades completely.}
<L>__{exterior british trenches. early dawn.}
<A>__{title: france 1918, the somme with the barrage lifted, the british soldiers that are huddled in a low sub trench, are ordered back on the line. andrew easton is with albert and he's shaken and terrified. a far cry from the happy young boy we knew. a gruff sergeant (sergeant martin) walks the trench with a bucket and each soldier puts in their valuables and personal belongings. one a lighter, some money, etc.}
<C>__{sergeant martin}
<D>__{valuables in the bucket, lads. if you live, you'll get them back. if you live, you'll get them back. good lads.}
<A>__{albert and andrew move down the trench in a line of soldiers who are given ammo belts and grenades. albert gets his grenades and walks further along the trenches. we follow him in real time as he passes a bunch of soldiers who are kneeling in the ankle deep water, a padre is giving them communion. the deafening noise of shelling all around.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{maybe it's a drill, albie. maybe it's a drill like last time.}
<A>__{we keep following albert's progress in real time further on there is a post box where they all put their final letters home in identical green envelopes. we see albert's letter addressed to "ted and rose narracott" in devon. he posts it in a battered metal post box. an officer approaches:}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{love letter?}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{that's my business.}
<A>__{it is david lyon's son now in charge of this small group of men. still arrogant looking older than albert in his uniform and clearly enjoying his superior rank.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i hear you and your mate were doing bird imitations again. you gonna write a letter to your horse?}
<A>__{albert ignores him. andrew can't help but giggle.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{after you find your horse, i've lost my needle in a haystack, and i could use some help.}
<A>__{david takes up a bucket and walks down the line of soldiers.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{anything valuable. anyone who comes back gets to share it out.}
<C>__{albert}
<P>__{(to andrew)}
<D>__{stay here.}
<A>__{albert follows david down the trench.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{remember that day me and joey raced you in your car?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i remember you somersaulting through the air.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{who was that girl you were with?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{there was a girl?}
<A>__{albert nods.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{there was. don't you remember?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it was just some girl, i suppose. i don't recall which one. i do remember you falling on your bum in a ditch.}
<A>__{andrew laughs amiably. david points to him, smirking.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{you see? always entertaining, narracott, i will give you that.}
<A>__{as david walks on, andrew smiles at albert.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{you did that? you fell on your bum?}
<A>__{albert leaves without answering. andrew keeps smiling until a large shell explodes nearby. troops surge towards their ladders as officers scream indistinct orders. now david leads his troop through the trenches to the front line where they stop, lean against the enemy side wall nervously and wait each man in private contemplation. sergeant martin moves along the lines, pushing men forward.}
<C>__{sergeant martin}
<D>__{be ready! be ready! let's go, men, get ready to go! get ready to move out! stay in position!}
<A>__{david calls out from atop a trench ladder.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{hold your nerve, boys. remember, it's not far to go. there's a way through.}
<P>__{(he moves down the line)}
<D>__{run fast, keep your wits about you, keep your eyes open and god and the king will keep an eye on you. company will fix bayonets! fix bayonets!}
<A>__{the echo of `fix bayonets' goes down the line and every man fixes the brutal shining bayonet to the end of his gun. then albert turns to andrew.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{you know what it reminds me of out there?}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{that bloody impossible lower field the day me and joey plowed it. best day of my life that was and you were there.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{and this here is the worst day of my life, about to begin, and you're here cheering me on. us two, always. and him.}
<A>__{he nods at david lyons, who gives instructions to another soldier.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{once you're in no man's land, go to the flanks. stay on the flanks.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{david turns to albert and andrew.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{come on, boys, come on. to the ladder!}
<C>__{albert}
<P>__{(to andrew)}
<D>__{stick close to the gentry, that's our ticket, yeah? we have the pluck but they have the luck.}
<A>__{they both smile. and then the fear takes over again. andrew particularly feels as though he is on the very edge now. david urges them forward.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you, too, narracott.}
<P>__{(to andrew)}
<D>__{and you, too.}
<A>__{andrew and albert pass by the bucket. they throw some valuables in. but a moment later, albert goes back to the bucket and pulls something out a worn piece of paper he unfolds it it is the little sketch that captain nicholls drew of joey the night before they left for france. he slips it inside his shirt, next to his heart.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{come on, on your ladders, boy. on your ladders. in you go, in you go. that's it.}
<A>__{andrew turns towards a ladder. as fate and placement would have it he is first in line. he puts his foot on the ladder, when suddenly the sergeant stops him.}
<C>__{sergeant martin}
<D>__{listen to your sergeant!}
<A>__{he pulls andrew aside, speaking so that everyone can hear.}
<C>__{sergeant martin }
<D>__{if anybody turns back, if any one of our boys come running towards you you take this rifle and you shoot them dead. do you understand?}
<C>__{soldiers}
<D>__{yes, sir!}
<A>__{the sergeant pushes in on andrew, private and intense.}
<C>__{sergeant}
<D>__{do you understand me? do you understand what i'm telling you, son? you take this rifle and you shoot them dead. understand?}
<A>__{andrew looks ready to cry, but manages to nod. albert turns to him, only to be pushed back by the sergeant.}
<C>__{sergeant }
<D>__{up there, son. up your ladder. up your ladder to your work!}
<A>__{albert looks nervously back at albert, comforting.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{it's good. andrew, it's good. andrew! nobody's retreating today. andrew! andrew! nobody. is retreating. today.}
<A>__{the commander arrives, checks the time on his aide's watch, mounts his ladder and blows a whistle to signal the charge. a bagpiper plays as the men go over the top. david now heads up the ladder first. gun fire overhead, albert steels himself, then hauls himself over the top, followed by the next man and the nexterior immediately machine gun fire whistles past, we hear the screams of the first men who are shot. we follow albert. we are him. his vision. his experience. the ground is blasted, there are bodies all around him. he tries to run but his feet sink into the mud. bullets fly past him. felled men are screaming at his feet in fear and agony. albert staggers forward. david is now right by him. they run together. albert looks round and suddenly, david is hit. he falls to the ground, screaming.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i'm shot! no!}
<A>__{albert instinctively goes to help. bullets shower all around him.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{just leave me. leave me!}
<A>__{albert grabs him and drags him onwards with him david screaming at the pain albert grimly determined. shells explode around them as they stumble on. other men are running and falling. albert sees cover in a huge shell hole so dives into it for a moment's reprieve from the gun fire. he sits in still terror for a moment.}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{you'll be all right here. you'll be safe. someone'll come for ya.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{albert. albert, listen...}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{it's all right. it's all right. we're devon boys, yeah?}
<A>__{david looks at albert as though seeing him for the first time.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yeah...}
<A>__{albert races onward. back at the trench, andrew waits terrified and then, back out of the mist step two men heading back towards him. then a third. they suddenly catch sight of andrew waiting there with his gun pointed towards them. they slow down in the terror of the assault, they had forgotten that death was waiting for them if they turned back. time seems to slow down andrew shifts his gun from pointing at one to the other we see their individual faces. they are all just boys really. and suddenly, instinct hits andrew he charges up the ladder, and forward, firing past the three men, towards the enemy. he chooses his death instead of theirs. a sudden barrage of machine gun fire all around him. cut back to albert, who makes his way to the edge of the shell hole. bullets whizz inches from his head. he looks over to see a german machine gun position to his right. bullets whizz past forcing him to duck. andrew charges past other soldiers, ignoring their warnings.}
<C>__{random soldier}
<D>__{get down!}
<A>__{albert continues forward to dive into another shell hole, nearer to the german line. he scrambles from shell hole to shell hole. now he's very close to the machine gun position. albert takes a grenade, fumbles with the pin as his hands tremble. he finally gets the pin out and he hurls the grenade at the machine gunner. we see the explosion and the machine gun stop. albert sprints over the top again and makes it all the way into the german trench. albert runs through the trench, which seems curiously empty. albert swings round as he sees the startling face of a gas masked german holding a rifle on him. albert readies his bayonet but the man is dead, slumped backwards against the side of the trench still upright. albert spins round, his bayonetted rifle in front of him, ready for action, but there is only the ghostly sight of dead german soldiers. albert is alone, everyone else is dead. all the dead wear gas masks. more british soldiers drop into the trench, among them andrew. he stumbles in the mud, drops his rifle, recovers it, and races through the trench. he glimpses albert ahead of him, stalking through the mist. andrew breaks into a smile and rushes forward, prompting albert to whirl with his rifle raised.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{albert pauses just in time. then he collapses against the side of the trench, overwhelmed.}
<C>__{andrew }
<D>__{albie.}
<A>__{andrew grabs albert and holds him up, embracing him. albert can barely whisper:}
<C>__{albert}
<D>__{we made it. we made it.}
<A>__{a moment later, the pair of them hurry through the trenches. albert spots more comrades around a corner and calls ahead to andrew.}
<C>__{albert }
<D>__{andrew, this way out!}
<A>__{suddenly another soldier leaps from a trench branch between them, shouting in panic.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{gas! gas! gas!}
<A>__{an instant later, a gas cloud blasts through the trench. andrew and albert look in horror. it spreads towards them, too powerful to avoid. andrew is closest, turns to albert with a helpless }
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{albie...}
<A>__{ before he takes the full power of it. an instant later, the white, deadly cloud encompasses albert, too...}
