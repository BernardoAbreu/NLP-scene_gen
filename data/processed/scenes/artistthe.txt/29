<D>__{interior kinograph studios tavern decor day george, dressed as a musketeer, is sword fighting with three middle ages thugs in a tavern. he kills two of them, but unfortunately loses his epee when fighting the third. but when the third man attacks, george merely dodges with a sleight of body and puts his attacker out of action with a right hook! calm restored, he smiles and waves in brotherly fashion to a mysterious man who is trying to hide underneath his long cape. the man stands up, throws aside his cape and reveals himself to be... napoleon! he puts his bicorne hat back on and warmly thanks an astonished george. napoleon says something to him and george respectfully bows, walks away from him still bowing then turns and runs. once out of the decor, he bumps right into a worried looking zimmer who is followed by his loyal assistants. george is in a playful mood. zimmer tells him: title card: i want to show you something. right now. george seems astonished that zimmer is leaving the set and not filming, but agrees. napoleon walks past them very imperially and gestures royally to a technician to bring him a chair. the technician doesn't miss the chance to remind the man that he is only an extra, and not napoleon.}
