(103) interior basement, prince's house night chaos! the basement is packed with cops. prince's father is strapped into a gurney, staring dully at the ceiling. photographers snap pictures as paramedics work feverishly over him. i.v. units are pushed into his veins. an oxygen mask is placed over his nose and mouth. huge white bandages are bunched up along the back of his head. his mother is kneeling by the gurney, crying hysterically, grasping his hands in a white panic. two cops support her. someone is shouting instructions. radios crackle incessantly. a medic cries }

<A>__{sits motionless a long time. moonlight floods the basement with a foreboding light. a dog barks somewhere in the distance. he looks up suddenly, his face agitated, his eyes red from tears. prince's pov chalk marks on the floor outlining the body of his father. there's a gun in his father's hand clearly marked. a train whistle in the distance. he's staring at the gun. he shakes his head, rubs a hand over his face vigorously and looks up again... ...the gun in his father's hand. he can't get it out of his mind! the whistle is closer. he lurches to his feet, paces back and forth crazily. his father's head, the gun...the gun...the... the whistle is louder. he throws himself into the chair, buries his face deeply into his hands and cries. huge racking sobs spasm through his body. his father, his mother, his entire life, his music, his guitar... he looks up suddenly the gun in his father's hand. ..and he stares at it. the whistle is louder! his heart is pounding in his ears. he squeezes them shut, looks up... the gun. he bolts to his feet, paces back and forth in a panic! the train is howling! a rope in the corner of the room, his face, the gun... he sits dully, gazes at the rope as if in a trance. the train is roaring past the house, it's horn blasting. the rope, the gun, and his body dangling from the rafters in the night breeze }

<D>__{noooooo!!}
<A>__{he lurches to his feet, cuts through the basement like a madman. he grabs a stick and starts slashing things crazily, moving through the room swinging his stick wildly again and again. he's lost to himself now, deep in the pit of an unknown terror, expurgating a horror that has been festering in him for years. he flings his stick at the wall, unends shelves and bureaus, trampling old memories that have lain dormant for years. drawer after drawer is flung against the wall, their contents smashing and scattering about. he opens a large, oaken chest and flips over. thick three inch piles of yellowed paper fall out. he snaps through the rubber bands holding them together and flings the paper at the wall again and again... ...he stops suddenly, shocked. he sees musical notes written down on the paper. his heart pounding in his chest, he searches frantically through the rubble scattered about him. more and more musical notes, sketched ideas, simple melodies, entire songs and scores all meticulously recorded on lined yellowed paper, dated for the last 20 years, and signed...by his father. he's shocked to a standstill. then the full significance of what's before him hits him like a sledgehammer. he collapses in agony against the chest, tears flowing down his cheeks.

<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{cool, gray dawn. he's in a dead sleep on the floor, his arms outstretched, his legs twisted beneath him. his father's outline seemingly rests by his side... just then the basement window begins to glow with sunlight. it inches slowly across the floor, then sweeps him majestically, bathing him in its warmth. he wakes slowly, stretches his limbs like an opening flower. after a moment he sits up, shades his eyes... the basement is littered with debris. the destruction is complete, but in the midst of it lies his father's music. the yellow parchment is scattered about glowing in the sunlight... something seems to flash across his mind. he stands, moves quickly down the hallway to the antechamber... suddenly we hear a tape rewinding. after a moment...music and we immediately recognize it as lisa's and wendy's song. it plays a moment, then snaps off abruptly. he stands locked in thought, then sits behind the piano, hunts for the first few notes of lisa's and wendy's song...}
