<L>__{interior bar}

<C>__{warrior}
<P>__{(dubbed hero voice)}
<D>__{enough talk. let's fight! shashabooey!}
<A>__{wham! the warrior delivers a punch and the whole gang goes flying.}
<C>__{narrator }

<C>__{grateful bunny}
<D>__{how can we repay you??}
<C>__{warrior}

<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior bar continuous}
<A>__{the roof explodes and a cloud of ninjas erupts into the sky. like a tornado, the warrior spins and knocks them all down.}
<C>__{narrator }
<D>__{it mattered not how many foes he faced. they were no match for his bodacity.}
<A>__{the warrior beats up a thousand ninjas, delivering his final blow while doing a split between two trees. the warrior stands amongst a field of vanquished foes as god rays shine down upon him.}
<D>__{narrator (v.o.) (cont'd) never before had a panda been so feared... and so loved. narrator (v.o.) (cont'd) even the most heroic heroes in all of china, the furious five, bowed in respect to this great master.}
<C>__{monkey}
<D>__{we should hang out.}
<C>__{warrior}
<D>__{agreed.}
<A>__{as the five salute the warrior, he turns to see more bandits approaching. the five strike an attack pose. the warrior brandishes a shiny green sword and leaps off the mountain into the sea of bandits.}
<C>__{narrator }
<D>__{but hanging out would have to wait. `cause when you're facing the ten thousand demons of demon mountain, there's only one thing that matters. and that's }
<A>__{in mid air, the five talk to the warrior in a strange voice.}
<C>__{monkey}
<D>__{po! get up!}

<A>__{po lands hard on the floor. he tries to clear his head and wake up.}
<C>__{po's dad }
<D>__{po! get up!}
<A>__{we see his room is filled with various kung fu posters (including a poster featuring all of the five) and souvenirs, and a wooden version of the sword of heroes (the green sword). po sighs. he attempts to kick himself to his feet but alas, his belly is too worthy a foe.}
<D>__{po's dad (o.s.) (cont'd) po! what are you doing up there?}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{uh, nothing!}
<A>__{po hops to his feet, imitating his kung fu action figures.}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{monkey! mantis! crane! viper! tigress! rowrrrr...}
<A>__{outside on the balcony of the neighboring house, a pig watering flowers stares at po. po tries to play it cool and then quickly ducks out of sight.}
<C>__{po's dad }
<D>__{po! let's go! you're late for work!}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{coming!}
<A>__{he takes a ninja star from his floor and chucks it at the wall. it bounces off. he throws the star again, but it bounces off again. he picks it up and heads downstairs. he trips and falls the rest of the way.}
<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{po falls flat on his face on the kitchen floor. a panda shaped shadow looms over po.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{sorry, dad.}
<C>__{po's dad}
<D>__{sorry doesn't make the noodles.}
<A>__{reveal that the shadow is actually caused by a basket being carried by a small duck. this is po's dad. po gets to work, which is not easy since the kitchen's not really made for a panda his size.}
<C>__{po's dad }
<D>__{what were you doing up there? all that noise.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{oh, nothing. just had a crazy dream.}
<A>__{he gets back to work.}

<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{po's dad}

<C>__{po}
<D>__{what was i... eh, i was dreaming about uh... heh...}
<A>__{push in on po is he going to admit his dream? he hides his throwing star behind his back.}
<C>__{po }

<C>__{po's dad}
<D>__{noodles. you were really dreaming about noodles?}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{uh, yeah. what else would i be dreaming about?}
<A>__{po hands a noodle bowl to a customer, then realizes his throwing star is sitting in it.}
<C>__{po }
<P>__{(to customer)}
<D>__{careful, that soup is... sharp!}
<C>__{po's dad}
<D>__{oh, happy day! my son, finally having the noodle dream!}
<A>__{he throws his arms around po.}
<C>__{po's dad }
<D>__{you don't know how long i have been waiting for this moment.}
<A>__{when dad pulls out of the hug, po is now wearing a noodle apron.}
<C>__{po's dad }
<D>__{this is a sign, po!}
<A>__{po looks at the apron nervously what has he gotten himself into?}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{uh...a sign of what?}
<C>__{po's dad}
<D>__{you are almost ready to be entrusted with the secret ingredient of my "secret ingredient soup." and then you will fulfill your destiny and take over the restaurant, just as i took it over from my father, who took it over from his father, who won it from a friend in a game of mahjong.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{dad dad dad, it was just a dream.}
<C>__{po's dad}
<D>__{no, it was the dream. we are noodle folk. broth runs through our veins.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{but dad, didn't you ever, i dunno, want to do something else? something besides noodles?}
<C>__{po's dad}
<D>__{actually...}
<A>__{po looks surprised.}
<C>__{po's dad }
<D>__{when i was young and crazy...}
<A>__{dad gets a wistful look in his eyes.}
<C>__{po's dad }
<D>__{i thought about running away and learning how to make tofu.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{so why didn't you?!}
<C>__{po's dad}
<D>__{oh, because it was a stupid dream. can you imagine, me making tofu?}
<P>__{(laughs at the thought)}
<D>__{no. we all have our place in this world. mine is here. and yours is }
<C>__{po}
<D>__{i know. is here.}
<C>__{po's dad}
<D>__{no, it's at tables two, five, seven, and twelve.}
<A>__{he loads po's arms with bowls of soup.}
<C>__{po's dad }
<D>__{service with a smile!}
<A>__{a gong sounds in the distance. po looks out the window at the distant jade palace.}
<L>__{exterior jade palace day}
<A>__{slam zoom in towards palace. end next to palace on an old red panda (shifu) playing a flute. he is surrounded by the bushes and trees that nestle between the palace buildings. wider: we dolly around from behind the bushes. stealthy dark shapes move in the foreground. back on shifu, still playing. he seems oblivious. five figures explode from the undergrowth simultaneously, diving on shifu. shifu moves like lightning the flute now wielded like a staff he deflects, blocks, dodges, parries the attackers go flying they roll and pick themselves up, turning to face shifu, who is now standing poised ready for their next move.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{well done, students... if you were trying to disappoint me.}
<A>__{he uses his flute to correct the five's technique.}
<C>__{shifu }
<D>__{tigress, you need more ferocity. monkey, greater speed.}
<A>__{each of the five bows respectfully as their name is mentioned.}
<C>__{shifu }
<D>__{crane height. viper subtlety. mantis }
<A>__{shifu suddenly points the flute at a scared palace goose.}
<C>__{zeng}
<D>__{master shifu!}
<C>__{shifu}
<P>__{(impatiently)}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{zeng}
<P>__{(startled)}
<D>__{aah! it's master oogway. he wants to see you.}
<A>__{shifu looks up, concerned.}
<L>__{interior hallway}
<A>__{shifu strides purposefully down the hallway, which is lined with palace geese.}
<L>__{interior scroll room day}
<A>__{candles, incense, and smoke fill the room. the door bursts open, the candles flicker. shifu enters.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{master oogway? you summoned me.}
<A>__{he bows. then looks up without unbowing.}
<C>__{shifu }
<D>__{is something wrong?}
<A>__{reveal master oogway... a wise, old tortoise.}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{why must something be wrong for me to want to see my old friend?}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{so... nothing's wrong?}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{well, i didn't say that.}
<A>__{shifu looks up, concerned. oogway opens his mouth... and blows out a candle. and another candle. and another. finally, shifu uses his kung fu to blow them all out. oogway smiles knowingly.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{you were saying?}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{i have had a vision... tai lung will return.}
<A>__{shifu looks stricken. flashback interior scroll room quick, impressionistic images of shifu battling a large, shadowy figure (tai lung). present interior scroll room shifu is rattled. he looks at the claw marks that still scar the wall and quickly looks away. but he regains his composure.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{that is impossible. he is in prison.}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{nothing is impossible.}
<A>__{shifu makes a split decision.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{zeng!}
<A>__{he comes flying in. shifu gets in his face.}
<C>__{shifu }
<D>__{fly to chogun prison and tell them to double the guards, double their weapons. double everything! tai lung does not leave that prison!}
<C>__{zeng}
<D>__{yes, master shifu.}
<A>__{the goose flies off, but... smack! he hits a column. then he is off. back on oogway, as he walks toward camera, away from shifu.}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{one often meets his destiny on the road he takes to avoid it.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{we have to do something. we can't just let him march on the valley, and take his revenge! he'll, he'll }
<A>__{oogway looks into the water of the moon pool.}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{your mind is like this water, my friend. when it is agitated, it becomes difficult to see. but if you allow it to settle, the answer becomes clear.}
<A>__{shifu and oogway stare into the pool. oogway settles the water, revealing the reflection of an intricately carved dragon clutching a scroll in its mouth.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{the dragon scroll...}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{it is time.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{but who? who is worthy to be trusted with the secret to limitless power? to become...the dragon warrior?!}
<A>__{dramatic music as we push in on oogway's face. then...}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<L>__{interior noodle shop day}
<A>__{po is serving customers, but has trouble squeezing between tables.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{oop...sorry.}
<C>__{angry patron}
<D>__{hey! watch it, po!}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{sorry. suck it up.}
<A>__{he sucks his belly in, but this causes his butt to interfere with a bunny family's meal.}
<C>__{disgusted patron}
<D>__{ugh!}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{oop! sorry! a thousand pardons.}
<A>__{a couple palace geese put up a poster on the wall and a palace pig hits a tiny gong. this gets po's attention. he rushes up to the poster.}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{what?! master oogway's choosing the dragon warrior! today!}
<A>__{customers jump up excitedly.}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{everyone! everyone! go! get to the jade palace!}
<A>__{po urges the villagers out the restaurant.}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{one of the five is gonna get the dragon scroll!}
<A>__{customers rush to finish their food.}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{we've been waiting a thousand years for this! just take the bowl!}
<A>__{other customers are finishing their soup. one old lady customer slowly counts out coins and puts them on the table.}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{this is the greatest day in kung fu history! don't worry about it, just go!}
<A>__{he starts to run.}
<C>__{po's dad}
<D>__{po! where are you going?}
<A>__{po stops dead in his tracks, busted.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{to the...jade palace?}
<C>__{po's dad}
<D>__{but you're forgetting your noodle cart! the whole valley will be there, and you'll sell noodles to all of them.}

<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{i was kinda thinking maybe i...}
<C>__{po's dad}
<D>__{uh huh?}
<A>__{po wants to say something to his dad, but he loses his nerve.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{...could also sell the bean buns. they are about to go bad.}
<C>__{po's dad}
<D>__{that's my boy! i told you that dream was a sign!}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{yeah, ha ha, glad i had it.}

<A>__{throngs of villagers are streaming into the arena. a couple bunny kids run by.}
<D>__{bunny fan #1 yippee! bunny fan #2 i'm a kung fu warrior! bunny fan #1 me too!}
<A>__{where's po? pan down a long, long, long, long flight of stairs. po stands at the bottom with his noodle cart, looking up at the daunting task before him. po struggles to pull his noodle cart up the stairs. the sun beats down on po, but he presses forward. climbing. climbing.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior valley square later}
<A>__{po is still struggling up the stairs.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{come on! come on, ya almost there...}
<A>__{he stops, flopping onto his back to catch his breath. widen to reveal he's only made it up seven steps.}
<C>__{po }

<A>__{two pigs pass by.}
<C>__{kg shaw}
<D>__{sorry, po.}
<C>__{jr shaw}

<A>__{po watches as they run up the stairs. his eyes narrow. this is his heroic moment.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{no. i will bring me back a souvenir.}
<A>__{po tosses off his hat and apron and begins his ascent up the stairs.}
<L>__{exterior jade palace arena platform}
<A>__{oogway reaches the bottom of the palace stairs and a palace pig bangs a gong.}

<D>__{yes, master oogway.}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{now know this, old friend. whomever i choose will not only bring peace to the valley, but also to you.}
<A>__{as shifu contemplates what this could mean, oogway starts walking off. shifu quickly joins oogway as they head towards the roaring crowd below. the pig bangs the gong.}

<A>__{drums inside drown out po's pounding. he yells.}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{let me in!}

<C>__{shifu }
<D>__{master oogway, wait! that flabby panda can't possibly be the answer to... our problem. you were about to point at tigress. that thing fell in front of her. that was just an accident!}
<C>__{oogway}
<D>__{there are no accidents.}
<A>__{oogway smiles benignly as we hear an off screen crash! the camera adjusts to reveal the palanquin has collapsed under po. shifu looks at oogway. oogway just smiles. a squad of burly pigs rushes in and hoists po, the palanquin, and the geese onto their shoulders, and they head off for the jade palace. stunned, shifu watches them go. behind him, the five approach and bow.}
<C>__{tigress}
<D>__{forgive us, master. we have failed you.}

<D>__{uh, yeah. it's just, maybe we can find something more suited to my level.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{and what level is that?}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{well, ya know...i'm not a master, but uh, let's just start at zero, level zero.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{there is no such thing as level zero.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{hey! maybe i can start with that.}
<A>__{po points at a rather friendly looking dummy.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{that? we use that for training children. and for propping the door open when it's hot. but if you insist...}

<D>__{we've got this. help her!}

<D>__{you are, po.}
<A>__{they look at each other. this is a big moment. oogway's staff hangs in a rack surrounded by candles. as po and the five stand by, shifu carries the staff over to the reflecting pool. shifu bows his head, then, eyes still closed, he raises the staff up above his head. po and the others watch, expectantly. the peach blossom petals rise in a flickering, spinning cloud up from the pool. the gentle tornado rises up around the ceiling carving that holds the dragon scroll. the petals loosen the scroll from the dragon's mouth and it falls. at the last second, shifu reaches out with the staff to catch the scroll on the end of it. he turns to po, holding it out.}

<D>__{no. oogway was wiser than us all.}

<D>__{finally!}
<A>__{po bounces off a nearby pillar and slams back into tai lung, sending him flying into a column. po puts on a brave face and strikes a pose as tai lung recovers and charges. po turns to run. tai lung quickly catches up and they both sail off the palace steps. po clings to the scroll as tai lung delivers a kick and sends him crashing onto the theater rooftops below. po rolls down off a tree and uses the recoil to whip back and smash tai lung. he briefly skids across the rooftop and comes right back at po.}
<C>__{tai lung }
<D>__{that scroll is mine!}
<A>__{down the theater steps, po and tai lung grapple for the scroll. po is oblivious to the effects of crashing down stairs and in slow motion, his voluminous butt presses down on tai lung's head. as they crash through the gateway the scroll is knocked loose. tai lung goes for the scroll but po snatches it away using a noodle lasso. the scroll flies towards him and bounces off his head. tai lung leaps for it, but po grabs his tail and pulls him back down onto a cart which see saws po into the air. in mid air, po slurps the noodle. up and over the rooftops, po lands in a grove of bamboo trees and into a nearby wok shop. the scroll rolls to a stop in the street. as tai lung makes his move on the scroll, po turns the array of overturned woks into a shell game, sliding the woks around to hide the scroll.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{lightning!}
<A>__{tai lung knocks the woks away and exposes the scroll as po uses his bamboo stilts to block tai lung. the leopard swipes out the stilts and brings po down on top of him as the scroll rolls down the steps towards the river. po gets thrown into a fireworks booth. as tai lung chases down the scroll, he turns back to see po flying through the fireworks filled sky. po slams through tai lung and crashes into a rock wall. the scroll flies out of his hand and lands in the mouth of an ornamental rooftop dragon. he looks back at tai lung, who sees where the scroll has landed. via the magic of cookie vision, po effortlessly scales the building. tai lung is shocked.}
<C>__{tai lung}
<D>__{the scroll has given him power.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{nooo0!!}
<A>__{he takes a giant leap and kicks the wall. the resulting shockwave collapses the building. amazingly, po skips across the falling roof tiles to reach the scroll in mid air as tai lung leaps up behind him and unleashes a punishing blow that sends po smashing into the ground. as tai lung lands, he delivers a final devastating punch. as the dust settles, tai lung is looming over po in the impact crater.}

<A>__{tai lung's nerve attack has no effect on po. frustrated, he delivers a double fisted punch to po's belly. the shockwave ripples through po's entire body and po's arms come back and strike tai lung, sending the leopard crashing back into a building. po looks at his hands, amazed at what he just did. tai lung rises from the rubble and runs at po again. but po strikes back, using an unorthodox panda style technique, even getting tai lung to chomp down on his own tail. po gives tai lung a butt bump that sends him crashing into a building. tai lung emerges and attempts one more lunge at po. but po prepares... and tai lung is swiftly met by po's iron belly! he is launched into the air. po waits... and waits... until finally, tai lung appears in the sky and crashes to the ground. tai lung is battered, but still defiant.}
<C>__{tai lung}
<P>__{(heavy breathing)}
<D>__{you... can't defeat me. you're just a big, fat panda!}
<A>__{schwing! po grabs tai lung's finger. tai lung's eyes go wide.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{i'm not a big, fat panda. i'm the big, fat panda.}
<A>__{po's pinky pops up. tai lung gasps.}
<C>__{tai lung}
<D>__{the wuxi finger hold!}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{oh, you know this hold?}
<C>__{tai lung}
<D>__{you're bluffing. you're bluffing! shifu didn't teach you that.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{nope. i figured it out.}
<A>__{he flexes his pinky...}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{skadoosh!}
<A>__{ka thoom!}
<L>__{exterior valley of peace}
<A>__{a mushroom cloud appears over the valley, sweeping past the furious five and the fleeing villagers.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior valley square a little later}
<A>__{villagers emerge from hiding. po walks out from the mist looking very much like the warrior from the opening dream.}
<C>__{kg shaw}
<D>__{look! the dragon warrior.}
<A>__{as he nears, we see that his hat is an upside down wok and his scarf is a torn apron. villagers cheer the dragon warrior. po's dad emerges from the crowd.}
<C>__{po's dad}
<D>__{that's my boy. that big, lovely kung fu warrior is my son!}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{thanks, dad.}
<A>__{po hugs his dad. the wok falls off po's head and rolls on the ground until mantis appears in frame and stops it. the rest of the five are with him. po takes notice.}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{hey, guys.}
<C>__{tigress}
<D>__{master.}
<A>__{tigress bows deeply. the others follow.}
<C>__{furious five}
<D>__{master.}
<C>__{po}
<P>__{(modest)}
<D>__{master?}
<P>__{(then, remembering)}
<D>__{master shifu!}
<A>__{po races toward the jade palace. he climbs the steps. then more steps.}
<L>__{interior palace moments later}
<A>__{po arrives breathless at the jade palace. shifu is still lying in the scroll room, his eyes closed. po rushes to his side.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{master! shifu! shifu! are you okay?}
<A>__{shifu weakly opens his eyes.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{po! you're alive!}
<P>__{(then, darkly)}
<D>__{or we're both dead.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{no, master, i didn't die. i defeated tai lung!}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{you did?!}
<A>__{shifu smiles and shakes his head in disbelief.}
<C>__{shifu }
<D>__{wow. it is as oogway foretold you are the dragon warrior. you have brought peace to this valley. and to me. thank you. thank you, po. thank you...}
<A>__{shifu closes his eyes. he is still. po starts freaking out.}

<C>__{po}
<D>__{oh. so, um, i should...stop talking?}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{if you can.}
<A>__{po nods reverently as shifu closes his eyes again. master and pupil lie next to each other. the camera pulls up and back away from them. po tries to remain still, but it's hard. he's about to say something, but he stops himself. he fidgets for a beat, then can't control himself any longer.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{want to get something to eat?}
<C>__{shifu}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{yeah.}
