<L>__{interior fair oaks car city office day}
<A>__{tj walks up to an open office door and knocks. inside is larry towers. he looks up.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{i need to talk to you.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{oh, yeah? what about?}
<A>__{tj enters and sits opposite.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{i want to get the car back.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{yeah, i figured that. you made it pretty clear the last time you were here, and i thought i made it pretty clear that i couldn't give it to you.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{what do i need to do to get it back?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{the car's not for sale.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{i want to get it back, though. how much do you want for it?}
<A>__{larry takes a breath. he doesn't want to be having this conversation. he counts the obstacles out on his fingers.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{i don't know. we're talking at least eighteen hundred dollars, not including taxes, registration, adm, or dealer's fees. on top of that, you'd need a driver's license. i'm guessing you don't have one of those. you'd need valid car insurance. i'm guessing you don't have that either. but even if you did have these things, i still couldn't sell it to you because the car's not street legal. there's a million reasons why i can't sell it to you.}
<A>__{for a second it seems larry feels sympathetic toward tj.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{look kid, i appreciate your enthusiasm, i really do, but i don't know what to tell you. you can't have the car. end of story.}
<A>__{tj churns all this over in his head. larry thinks he's made himself clear. he motions to the papers on his desk.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{do you mind if i get back to it here?}
