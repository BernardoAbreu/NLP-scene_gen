<T>__{dissolving over:}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{uh... got tired of the barbie doll look. it hurt.}
<C>__{journalist 3}
<D>__{are you serious?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(cutting hair blindly)}
<D>__{about? y'know when people are joking, i find they are dead serious and when they're dead serious, i find them funny.}
<A>__{they're amazed. the point is made however visibly. the anger in his action is so extreme yet so contained the cynosure of all eyes as always. eyes shooting back at journalist 3... journalist 4 cuts in from the back of the room altering the mood.}
<C>__{journalist 4}
<D>__{what do your parents think about what you are doing?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{actually, i don't really remember being born. it musta happened during one of my blackouts.}
<A>__{laughter. journalist 4 with dark hair and demeanor, gypsy like jewelry on her arm and avant garde clothing, large glasses, is probably a rock magazine writer but seems to like jim and his work.}
<C>__{journalist 4}
<D>__{but they must've expressed some feeling?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{well, to be honest they're not living anymore so i don't like to talk about that.}
<A>__{flashbulbs hitting his face at that moment.}
<C>__{journalist 4}
<D>__{could you at least tell us how they died?}
<A>__{jim puts the scissors down, going to a low mysterious voice.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{oh, it was a... horrible car crash... in the desert in the fifties, arizona... ran right into a truckload of indians... navajos, they were lying out on the road, all bleeding, and i was with my grandma and grandad, we were banged up and all... and i was looking at my dad and he was lying there... but his throat was severed and there was air coming out.}
<A>__{he puts the room in a hush. he has mesmerized them and they're not sure whether to believe it or not.}
<C>__{journalist 4}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{journalist 2}
<D>__{i have the feeling i'm being put on.}
<A>__{jim rises, staggers slightly as he makes his way to the bar on the way out of the room, smiles right at her, ignoring everybody else in the room.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{y'all believe what you want to believe, you will anyway... but it does kinda show you what excites people?}
<P>__{(looking directly at her)}
<D>__{fear, pity, horror all those good things that count. it's sorta i guess like being on the edge of an orgasm, y'know... that mystery just before you come. when? if? should i? will you die for me, eat me, this way, the end...}
<A>__{he goes. the room in silence, embarrassed, nervous titters looking at journalist 4 who flushes deeply as we cut to:}
