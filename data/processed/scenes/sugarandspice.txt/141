<A>__{a smiling older woman with a "volunteer" button sits at a table with a "lunch tickets: $1.50" sign on it. lisa janusch approaches and hands her some money. the older woman starts to slowly count off tickets from a roll. impatient, lisa grabs the roll, rips off some tickets, tosses the roll on the table and storms off. the older woman unlocks the metal box (key around her neck), puts the money in, then shuts it. diane enters frame and gives her money. the older woman counts off tickets, smiles and gives them to diane who bends down to tie her shoe. the older woman unlocks the metal box to put the money in as kansas enters, falls to the ground and fakes choking. cleo runs up to kansas begging for help. the older woman hurries around the table to help as hannah enters frame, takes the open metal box and dumps the contents into lucy's winnie the pooh backpack as she walks quickly through frame. hannah hands the box to diane who shuts it and puts it back on the table. both exit in opposite directions as kansas stops choking, gets up and exits, followed by cleo, who first helps the older woman to her feet and then exits.}
