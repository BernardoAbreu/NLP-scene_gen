<L>__{exterior mariners memorial outside nightmute day}
<A>__{close on a huge wave crashing against a retaining wall. spray flying. pull back to reveal a small monument by the sea. a stone cupola with a bronze statue underneath. the sky, black with clouds.}
<L>__{interior mariner's memorial continuous}
<A>__{walter byrd waits under the mariner's memorial. wind whipping his jacket, the green sea churning behind him. next to a fifteen foot statue of a seaman, tall, rugged, tough. holding on to a thick coil of rope. hunches against the wind. watches as... will approaches the monument. sonics sweatshirt, wrinkled coat. face drawn and haggard. angry.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{hi, will...}
<A>__{will enters the monument.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing calling me at the station?}
<A>__{a gust of wind whorls through the monument.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i figured we should touch base. compare notes. i think it went well. what did you think?}
<A>__{will's eyes pierce into him.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{randy stetz is in jail.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{told you i could write an ending.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{congratulations.}
<A>__{will holds out his hand.}
<C>__{will }
<D>__{the tape.}
<A>__{walter looks at the open hand. hugs his jacket to him.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i thought maybe we could talk some more.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{there's nothing more to talk about.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{but we work so well together...}
<A>__{will breaks. rushes walter. slams him against one of the concrete pilasters.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{we do nothing well together.}
<P>__{(slams him again)}
<D>__{nothing! you understand me?}
<A>__{another wave crashes. sprays them. walter looks up into will's bloodshot eyes.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{you run on two settings, will. i've noticed that...}
<A>__{will tightens his grip.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{you jump from calm to rage in the blink of an eye. that's okay. i do that too.}
<A>__{he holds up the tape. will grabs it, shoves walter to the side. yanks the tape out of the cassette. steps back and hurls it into the sea. waves engulf it hungrily. walter watches him.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{you're not sleeping, are you?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what the hell do you know?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{kay told me. she comes to me, you know. tells me things. about you. about me.}
<B>__{pause.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{does detective eckhart come to you?}
<A>__{will curls his fists.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{does he ask you why you shot him?}
<A>__{whips around...}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i told you that was an accident!}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{then so was mine...}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{don't you pull that shit with me.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i didn't want to kill her, will.}
<A>__{steps closer to him. beseeching.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{when she called me that night from the party, she'd had a fight with randy. wanted to talk. i told her to meet me at our special place. the cabin at the beach...}
<A>__{a couple ravens alight nearby. flapping their wings. screeching into the wind.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{...when she came she was barefoot. and there was liquor on her breath. i only wanted to comfort her. to touch her. she could have at least let me do that. her skin...it was like everything i'd ever written about.}
<A>__{a dark shadow crosses his face. holds on to the coiled rope of the statue. will hisses.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{couldn't get it up, walter?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{it was when i went to kiss her. she started laughing. i got angry. after all i'd given her. all i'd shared with her. i just wanted to make her stop. that's all.}
<A>__{walter. squeezing the bronze rope.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{from calm to rage in the blink of an eye.}
<A>__{locks eyes with will. conspiratorial.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{remember?}
<A>__{will's hand shoots out. clamps around walter's neck.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{like this?}
<A>__{walter's face, starts turning red.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{yes. like that.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{this an accident, walter?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{if you want it to be...}
<A>__{will looks deep into walter's eyes. squeezing harder. pure hatred.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{it took ten minutes to beat kay connell to death. ten minutes.}
<A>__{their eyes, locked. veins, popping along walter's temples. lip quivering... just then a bell sounds in the distance. will looks up. a line of fishing boats coming back in. will, looks back at walter. throws him to the ground. sickened.}
<C>__{will }
<D>__{get the fuck out of town, byrd. leave and never come back.}
<A>__{walter coughs. holding his neck. enjoying this.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{i have a summer house up by kgun lake. i'm going to write my next novel there. it's about a famous detective who goes bad.}
<A>__{will shoots him a look.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{just kidding.}
<A>__{he pulls himself to his feet. a little unsteady. takes out a handkerchief. dabs his forehead.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{the never coming back part, though. i'm not sure. to tell you the truth this has been kind of fun. going to the station, meeting all those nice people. talking with you.}
<A>__{he shrugs. walks past will.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{i might miss it.}
<A>__{will turns. watches him walk away. walter hesitates. turns back.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{i especially like that new detective.}
<A>__{will looks at him. back straightening.}
<C>__{walter }
<D>__{detective burr.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i liked her very much. has a real vitality.}
<A>__{will's stomach jumps. walter turns back. continues on. the little man in a beige windbreaker.}
