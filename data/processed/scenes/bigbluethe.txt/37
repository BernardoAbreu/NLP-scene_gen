<L>__{exterior marineland on jacques}
<A>__{the park is closed, the paths are deserted. jacques approaches the dolphin's tank. all three dolphins rise up in the water. greet him with a click and clatter of tongues. jacques sits down at the edge of the tank.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{good morning, everybody! did you sleep well? i slept in a plane, and it wasn't too great.}
<A>__{he opens his duffel bag. hunts around, comes up with two packages wrapped in brownpaper. the dolphins stare at him, intrigued.}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{hey! presents.}
<A>__{the dolphins cackle some more.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{you think i'd forget you?}
<A>__{he laughs. the driver, who seems to be quite familiar with the place, walks in heading straight over to the soda machine. out of the corner of his eye, he takes in the scene, very intrigued. jacques has not noticed him. he starts unwrapping the first package.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{for bathsheba.}
<A>__{he produces a little ceramic llama.}
<B>__{on bathsheba}
<A>__{looking at the llama, bewildered. as bewildered as a dolphin can be. jacques turns the llama upside down. it moos: hiak, hiak...}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{it's a llama. you understand? from peru. it's fighting.}
<A>__{bathsheba shakes her head. jacques throws the llama into the water. he unwraps the second package. a pair of peruvian gloves and hat. wide eyed, the driver sits in the stands to watch the show.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{that's for you, darjeeling. we wouldn't want you to catch cold!}
<A>__{he throws them to darjeeling who catches them.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{and now...}
<P>__{(singing out)}
<D>__{"ta, da..." for you tina.}
<A>__{he pulls out a thermos.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{something you've never seen either.}
<A>__{he opens the thermos.}
<C>__{jacques}
<D>__{snow!}
<A>__{he sprinkles snow flakes on tina's head. she tries to taste it.}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(smiling like a child)}
<D>__{a new experience, tina.}
<P>__{(nostalgic)}
<D>__{i missed you little rascals. did you get my post card?}
<A>__{the three dolphins leap into the air and land with a huge splash which soaks jacques. he takes his shirt off.}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(pretending to be serious)}
<D>__{oh? is that what you want? alright, but five minutes, no more. i have a taxi waiting.}
<A>__{he takes off his pants. the taxi driver gets up, as if to keep him from going in. jacques dives into the pool. underwater on jacques he swims under the dolphin, reaches out and grabs hold of the dolphin's snout. the dolphin pulls jacques around and around the basin while jacques pets his chest and belly. we have never seen jacques so relaxed and happy.}
