<D>__{it was close.}
<A>__{pauline floats on her back, exhausted. ingrid swims beneath claude long strands of hair stream up from beneath the surface. margot gets out of the water and dick wraps her in a towel. for a moment it's an embrace. margot looks quickly over at claude his foot slips. he topples in. water roars around him. he opens his mouth. bubbles spurt out. he drifts down. lying next to the drain is a field mouse. its eyes are white. splash. hands wrap around him. he goes up. the sounds of wind and blurry voices now clearer. pauline brings claude to the surface and pushes him to the ladder. she helps him climb out. ingrid and maisy are grinning. their expressions slowly shift as they see claude's face. claude is sobbing.}

<C>__{margot}
<D>__{it's okay, my baby.}

<D>__{i'm sorry i laughed about the tree.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{now we're even.}
