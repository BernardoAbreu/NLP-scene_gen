<D>__{i entered here, monsieur, at a bad moment for you; it seems that you love this lady.}

<D>__{certainly, monseigneur, does not your excellency consider her worthy of love?}
<C>__{count}
<D>__{perfectly so; and what is more, i will tell you that i love her, and that i am not of a humor to put up with rivals.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{very well! now that i know it, i will no longer love her.}
<C>__{count}
<D>__{then you yield to me.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{on the instant. everyone must yield to such a nobleman as you.}
<C>__{count}
<D>__{very well; but a man who yields takes to his legs.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{that is a trifle strong.}
<C>__{count}
<D>__{take to your legs, low irish dog.}
<A>__{roderick smiles at him.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{your excellency has wantonly insulted me. that being so, i conclude that you hate me, monseigneur, and that hence you would be glad to remove me from the number of the living. in this wish, i can and will satisfy your excellency.}
