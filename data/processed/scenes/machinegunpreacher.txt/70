<A>__{a row of wood sheds and worn nylon tents marks the hospital area. each enclosure jammed with the desperately sick. battle weary aid workers move among them, doing what they can, caring for the ones who are most desperately ill.}

<D>__{cholera and malaria are everywhere, there is little food and not enough un soldiers to protect everyone. even here they worry the lra will attack at night.}

<D>__{i'm sorry, sam... i will be five minutes.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{course, do what you gotta do.}
<A>__{deng leaves and now sam is completely alone, taking in this mire of humanity all around him. and suddenly there's commotion! two aid workers coming into this tent carrying a woman on a stretcher. one of the aid workers looking around a white woman mid 30's her name is agnete closson, regional director of doctors without borders. she sees sam across the tent.}
<C>__{agnete}
<D>__{excuse me. you. can you help please?}

<D>__{we need to transfer her to the bed. get her shoulders...}
<A>__{sam grabbing the woman underneath the shoulders as another aid worker gets her feet...}
<C>__{agnete }
<D>__{one, two, three...}
<A>__{and they swing the woman over to a cot... but as they do the sheer piece of blood stained muslin that was covering her face falls away... and we see that she has been mutilated... her lips cut off of her face... ... and now a doctor sweeps into the tent and begins to work on her. sam and agnete pushed back, away from the action. sam still shocked by what he's seen.}
