<A>__{epps, wes and jaeger inch along the pass hugging the face of the mesa. small rocks churn beneath their feet and tumble to the ground below. no man says a word, they're too busy trying to keep alive, and the air is filled with the sounds of labored breathing. each step so very careful: testing the pass for purchase, making sure the footing is solid. they inch one foot forward, then slide over the nexterior their hands probe the cliff face, fingers crawling like spider legs, looking for something, anything, to take hold of. sweat drips into epps eye. he blinks hard and fast trying to clear his vision. right now he can't really afford distractions. slowly, carefully, inch by inch the little death dance goes on. jaeger steps. he steps wrong. the pass gives way under his foot and begins to slide down. instinctively wes rockets out an arm grabbing jaeger by the uniform. at first jaeger smiles, glad for the save. but then he realizes something: wes is literally holding his life in his hands. all wes has to do is loosen his grip, and... the color drains from jaeger's face. wes stares back blank as a bowl of water. eternity goes on for a second. finally wes yanks jaeger back up against the mesa's face, then slides on. jaeger just hangs where he is for a beat clutching the rocks for dear life.}
