<L>__{exterior george's garage afternoon}
<A>__{guster is in a full out run for a rubber ball. sam is shirted, sitting at the patio table. with the ball gladly returned, sam tosses it again. george walks out juggling two plates of sandwiches and two cokes and sits down.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{do you ever get like the slightest inkling that you might want to help me instead of doing absolutely nothing?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{get the inkling, sam. i'm getting tired of your attitude.}
<A>__{sam picks up the sandwich, examines it and sets it back down on the plate.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i hate turkey.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{no you don't.}
<A>__{george takes a bite of his sandwich before responding.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{i want you to take out your nose ring and leave it out.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{it bugs me.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you snore at night. that bugs me. can i take you out?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{your brothers are right. it was the most god awful smell i've ever had my nose around.}
<A>__{george tightens his face and waves his hand in front of his nose. sam stares at his father. a black range rover pulls to a stop and robin steps out with a pizza box in her hands.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{thought you guys might be hungry.}
<A>__{as robin walks up the drive, sam picks up the turkey sandwich and starts eating. george glances at sam as robin sets the box on the table and sits down.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{we're fine. turkey sandwiches.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{well, for later then.}
<A>__{robin focuses on the nearly roofless shack. guster walks to the table and sits down by robin, ready to beg.}
<C>__{robin }
<D>__{it makes me sad.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i used to live here.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{but you hated four out of the five you did.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i was here six years. and i only hated two.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{which?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{the first and the last.}
<A>__{george sets his sandwich down.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i don't even like turkey sandwiches. what kind of pizza?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{sam's favorite.}
<A>__{george opens the box and pulls out a slice. sam appears disinterested as george starts in on the slice of pizza.}
<C>__{robin }
<P>__{(to sam)}
<D>__{sure you don't want any?}
<A>__{sam shrugs off his mother, looking away. robin nods and grabs a piece for herself.}
<C>__{robin }
<D>__{you're too thin, george. from what you used to be, anyway.}
<A>__{george responds with a pleasant face; he's not going to explain his weight loss right now.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{why the first and the last?}
<A>__{robin sets her slice of pizza down as she studies george.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{the first because i wasn't sure you really loved me...the last because i wasn't sure i really loved you.}
<A>__{george nods. though it may appear that sam isn't interested in the conversation, his ears are perked.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i was up on the roof this morning, tearing it down and it struck me as strong as anything ever has. that i'm happy today.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{what have you been before today?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{it was just that, maybe the way the sun struck the ocean, the sound of the waves. it was simple, whatever it was. then i started thinking about the last time i felt this good.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's been a long time.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{do you remember?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{the only time i can think of for sure, i was holding onto sam in the ocean, saving him from the waves.}
<A>__{george turns to sam, who's caught staring at his father.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{you head was pressed against my chest. i could feel your heart racing. and i remember i kissed your hair.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{we have it on video! was that when? my parents were down for his sixth birthday! i remember that.}
<A>__{robin inexplicably starts to cry. she instantly tries to take it back, pressing her hand to her mouth, wiping her eyes, but whatever emotion has her, has her good. both george and sam are confused and concerned.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i have to go.}
<A>__{she stands and backs away from the table.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i'm fine. nothing.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i will drop by your lunch tomorrow.}
<A>__{robin wipes her eyes again as she climbs into her car and drives off. sam and george face one another.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm gonna take a walk. i need some money.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you'll have money when you work.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you're so predictable.}
<A>__{sam sets his sandwich down and grabs a slice of pizza as he stands. he walks for a few feet, stops and turns around.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{you haven't been happy in ten years?}
<A>__{he doesn't wait for an answer; as he walks away, guster follows. george takes robin's slice of pizza and drops it on the cement; that's all it takes to turn guster around.}
