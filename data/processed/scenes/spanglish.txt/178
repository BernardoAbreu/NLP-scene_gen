<L>__{interior john's restaurant night...}
<A>__{as they enter the main restaurant...}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{i've never seen your place. very perfect.}
<A>__{he heads for the kitchen.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i'm going to cook, beautiful.}
<P>__{(on a dime correction)}
<D>__{i'm going to cook beautifully.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{hey..please..}
<A>__{he turns.}
<C>__{flor }
<D>__{we both were not normal because we are angry and we act like we are angry with each other and we are not..i am not. i am glad to be with you. it feels comfortable to be with you. if i just left the job and never spoke with you it would have been sin. you understand?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{ummmmmmmmm...yes.}
<A>__{he stands next to her and, for want of a better physical expression, pats her on her back..she eyes him, almost critical about the lame extent of his aggression....he can't quite look at her...he pats her again..}
<B>__{rear angle..the pat on the back.}
<A>__{the pat is becoming a rub..he cups her back..slides his hand..she responds just a bit..}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{i think i'm inventing a horrible new way of making out..}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{not so horrible.....}
<A>__{his hand keeps going..he now hugs her to him even though they both still face front.. like a loving couple on a walk to the market. his hand squeezes her shoulder.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{my hand is the only sane part of my body..every other part wants to jump off a cliff.}
<C>__{flor}
<P>__{(digging this almost growing a sense of humor)}
<D>__{if the other hand could cheer up, you could lift me up and carry me off.}
<A>__{he laughs. he takes his hand from around her. it is a bit awkward.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't know how to handle that one. i think i already broke my record for smooth.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it's me. i'm not making sense. but i can get you fed.}
<A>__{he goes to the kitchen. she begins to explore a little. she goes to a cabinet and opens it to find a cd player. she digs in her purse and takes out a cd.}
