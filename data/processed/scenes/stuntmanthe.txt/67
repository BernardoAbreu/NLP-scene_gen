<A>__{chuck barton is a tall, rugged looking man in his mid thirties, the stunt gaffer on eli's film. a messenger trots up and presents a receipt book. chuck sets down his stunt bag and signs it absently.}

<D>__{your film from that camera in the duesenberg's on the way to the lab. put it on the plane with my own little hands.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{when do we get it back?}
<C>__{messenger}
<D>__{don't know. stamped it "rush."}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{if i stamp "rush" on my mare's ass, she'll still take eleven months to foal. call the lab and find out when!}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i lost a man today. i wanna see that footage and find out why.}
<A>__{as the messenger leaves, chuck strolls over to where cameron stands waiting, circles around him, sizing him up. cameron is no longer wearing the uniform, but now is in jeans and a work shirt.}
