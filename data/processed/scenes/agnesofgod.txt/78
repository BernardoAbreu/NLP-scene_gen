<A>__{miriam and martha are sitting there talking. martha is smoking.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{when i was a child i used to hear my guardian angel. she sang to me 'till i was six years old. that's when i stopped listening. but i remember the voice. a few years ago i looked at myself and saw nothing but a nun who was certain of nothing. not even of heaven. not even of god. and then one evening i saw agnes standing by her window, singing. and all my doubts about myself and god were gone, in that one moment. i recognized the voice. please don't take it away from me again doctor livingston. those years after six were very bleak.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{my sister died in a convent. and it's her voice i hear.}
<P>__{(a long pause)}
<D>__{does my smoking bother you?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{no, it reminds me.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{would you like one? huh?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{i'd love one. martha hands her a cigarette and lights it for her. mother}
<A>__{miriam coughs a}
<D>__{lot. martha pats her on the back.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{i'm out of prac...}
<P>__{(cough)}
<D>__{... practice.}
<P>__{(cough)}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{all right?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{fine thanks...}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{do you suppose the saints would have smoked if tobacco had been popular back then?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{undoubtedly. not the ascetics of course but, well saint thomas more...}
<C>__{martha}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{long, thin and filtered.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{saint ignatius would smoke cigars and stub them out on the soles of his bare feet.}
<P>__{(they roar with laughter) and of course (distorted)}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{hand rolled.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{even christ would partake socially.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{saint peter?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{pipe!}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{right...}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{mary magdelen?}
<C>__{martha}
<P>__{(imitating)}
<D>__{oh, you've come a long way baby.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{and saint john would chew tobacco.}
<A>__{more laughter, then the moment because more serious.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{right.}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{what do you suppose today's saints are smoking?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{there are no saints today. good people yes, but extraordinarily good people... those i'm afraid we are sorely lacking.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{do you think they ever existed?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{yes i do.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{do you want to become one?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{become? one is born a sainterior}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{well you can try, can't you, to be good?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{yes, but goodness has very little to do with it. not all the saints were good, in fact some of them were a little crazy. but... they were still attached to god. agnes has that birth.}
<P>__{(she stands)}
<D>__{no more... we're born, we live, we die. no room for miracles.}
<P>__{(martha gets up too)}
<D>__{oh my dear, how i miss the miracles. they start walking back to the convent.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{do you think agnes is still attached to god?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{listen to her singing.}
<C>__{martha}
<P>__{(a pause)}
<D>__{i'd like to begin.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{begin what?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{the hypnotism. do you still disapprove?}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{would it stop you if i did?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{no. they both halt.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{may i be present?}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{mother miriam}
<D>__{then let's begin.}
