<P>__{(chuckling)}
<D>__{i was walking past pizza hut the other day, and for a second i was sure the sign said "pizza hat." and then i thought, wouldn't it be funny if there was a shop that sold hats shaped like pizzas?}

<D>__{you know. because it sounds like "pizza hut" only it's a hat shop.}
<C>__{seb}
<D>__{look, carl, why don't you just eat your fish and fuck off?}
<A>__{carl puts the rest of his meal in his mouth, gets up from the table and walks out of the restaurant. as he leaves, he smiles to himself. his phone rings. he sees it's rooney on the caller id.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{carl answers the phone.}
<C>__{rooney }
