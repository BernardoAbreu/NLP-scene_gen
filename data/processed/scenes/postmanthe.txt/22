<L>__{exterior training camp mess line close on meat day}
<A>__{a cook dumps a scoop of gristly, gray meat into each mess pail as the conscripts wait in line. they fall to ravenously, too hungry to taste how bad it is. idaho supervises.}
<C>__{idaho}
<D>__{eat up! you got meat tonight.}
<A>__{the line has almost passed. just the postman left and bandit #20 bringing up the rear. idaho looks at the postman, addresses the cook.}
<C>__{idaho}
<D>__{why don't you tell shakespeare what kind of meat that is.}
<C>__{cook}
<D>__{mule.}
<A>__{probably bill and the postman knows it. he stares in revulsion at the putrid meat ladled into his pail.}
<C>__{idaho}
<D>__{a godawful animal. the sterile offspring of a horse and a donkey. can you imagine that?! there's no room in this new world for a bastard like that.}
<A>__{bandit #20 holds out his pail. but the cook won't fill it.}
<C>__{idaho}
<D>__{uh uh.}
<P>__{(loudly; for all)}
<D>__{any man last in line ain't hungry enough. you show up last, you don't eat!}
<A>__{bandit #20 steps away in disbelief. not knowing what else to do, he sits down beside the postman, the only man with food who isn't eating.}
<D>__{bandit #20 i will die before i'm last in line again.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{that's what they're hoping for.}
<A>__{he holds his pail out to bandit #20.}
<D>__{bandit #20 serious? this isn't bad.}
<A>__{lost in despair, the postman stares out at the skewed palette.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{these were supposed to be the best years of my life.}
