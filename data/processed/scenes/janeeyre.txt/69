<L>__{exterior day. thornfield the grounds. spring.}
<A>__{jane is playing battledore and shuttlecock with adele. her playing is full of energy, very free. her cheeks looks almost rosy. it is spring.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{just as it turns to come down that's when you hit it.}
<A>__{adele serves. the game continues apace. rochester wanders out of the open double doors of the library. he watches. something lands at his feet. a rook's feather. he looks up at the battlements. a shape disappears, too fast to see. rochester's features cloud over with an expression of shame and detestation. he stands in a terrible inner conflict. jane notices him she misses her shot.}
<C>__{jane }
<D>__{mademoiselle has got to rest.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{because i start to win!}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{have mercy, adele. play with pilot for a while.}
<A>__{rochester is leaning over the balustrade, his head bowed.}
<C>__{jane }
<D>__{is our game disturbing you, sir?}
<A>__{he looks up. a hard and cynical expression has mastered his countenance, something resolute. jane is taken aback.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{on the contrary. i like your game. i like this cold, hard day. i like thornfield.}
<A>__{rochester picks up the black feather. he starts to walk across the grounds at a fast pace. jane follows.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{i've been arranging a point with my destiny, miss eyre. my destiny stood up there by that chimney, like one of the hags who appeared to macbeth. 'you like thornfield?' she said. 'like it if you dare'. well, i dare. it's felt like a plague house for years }
<A>__{he turns, the whole house now in his sights. he shouts:}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{but thornfield is my home and i shall like it!}
<A>__{adele is running after them.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{mademoiselle il faut jouer }
<A>__{rochester snaps at her with shocking ferocity.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{get back! keep at a distance child, or go in!}
<A>__{adele's face crumples into tears. rochester sees jane's shock at his outburst. he walks away. jane isn't sure whether she has been dismissed or not. adele has run back to pilot. jane watches her. she suddenly finds rochester is back at her side. he walks her along.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{she's the daughter of an opera dancer, celine varens. celine was a beauty and she professed to love me. her ardour was so great that, ugly as i am, i believed myself her idol. so i installed in her in a hotel, gave her servants, gowns cashmeres, diamonds in short, i was an idiot.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{to fall in love, sir?}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{you've never felt love, have you miss eyre? your soul still sleeps.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{does it?}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{you're still floating gently in the stream of life, unaware of the rocks ahead waiting to dash you to pieces.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{were you dashed to pieces, mr rochester?}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{not by celine. how can one ever truly love a woman one has paid for?}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{it ended when i visited her unexpectedly one night and caught her with her handsome, charmless lover. i overheard her waxing lyrical on all my defects she was mercenary, heartless, senseless. the whole intoxication fell away like a dream. i left her money to support the little french floweret over there, whom she swore blind was mine. i see no proof of my grim paternity in her features; i think pilot is more like me than she.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{but you took her on?}
<A>__{adele is curled up, seeking comfort from the dog.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{some years later, i heard that celine had abandoned the brat, disappeared to italy and left it destitute. so i lifted it from the mud and slime of paris and brought it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an english country garden. my one good work in a sea of countless sins.}
<A>__{jane is looking at adele full of compassion.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{you listen, miss eyre, as if it was the most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of his opera mistresses to an inexperienced girl like you. adele?}
<A>__{adele looks up. rochester speaks graciously.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{forgive me; for keeping miss eyre from your game for so long.}
<A>__{adele is immensely gratified by his apology.}
