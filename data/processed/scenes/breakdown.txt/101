<A>__{jeff comes out of the rest room. the manager is behind the teller's counter. the cowboy is gone. in his place sits a middle aged blue collar worker. he looks at jeff. jeff takes a seat, glances at calhoun's empty desk. there is a letter opener on the desk, several paper bands for wrapping currency. positioning his body so no one can see, jeff takes the letter opener and slips it into his sleeve. he scoops up a handful of currency wrappers. jeff goes to the teller's window, scribbles something on the back of a deposit slip and hands it to the teller.}
