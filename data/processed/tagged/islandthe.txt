<A>__{he shrugs, disgruntled. the clerk taps her screen. turning to a row of chutes behind her, she collects a foil covered bowl and a drink can. lincoln, less than appetized, loads his tray with the oatmeal and juice breakfast. then he heads into the seating area. in the seating area, male and female residents sit eating and chatting happily. uniformed busboys intermix, clearing and wiping tables. a divide in this community now starts to become clear... the busboys, like the nutrition clerk, like all the service, maintenance, and administrative staff we'll see, have distinct uniforms but no facial marking. they are known as "outsiders". the "residents", like lincoln, have crosshatched scars on their upper left brows and ethercuffs o n their wrists. mostly caucasian, from mid twenties to mid sixties. there are no children here. we isolate a blonde mid 20's, fresh, bright eyes, a fragile beauty, a crosshatch of two verticals and one horizontal. her name is ester two alpha. seeing lincoln, she smiles and waves }

<A>__{applause and whistles erupt, mostly from the younger residents, who take on the zeal of a game show audience. the older ones including lincoln greet the prospect with labored tolerance. merrick turns the tri key i n the lectern. the glass wall switches from the live feed to a jumbotron o f flashing text; daily spin!... get ready to win!... daily spin! }
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{let the spin begin.}
<A>__{to a burst of cheers, he turns the tri key another notch. the glass wall becomes a spinning blur, like a tumbler on a slot machine. but instead of icons, it clicks through names, each separated by a blank line from "adams one alpha" to "zucker three charlie" scrolling the entire population of sector four. as the spin slows, a pent silence falls. expectant eyes watch the names click through the p's, the q's, the r's, the s's and . . . spin win!... starkweather two delta... spin win! }

<A>__{resident #1 shrugs and hands him a drink can. resident #2 ducks under the fence, reaching the can down to the track. or what looks like a track. the struts lining the bed are not sleepers but buffers of galvanized rubber. nor are there any rails. the relay system is provided by a series of metal posts, flanking the buffers to run in twin parallel. known as "lode poles," they now start thrumming and pulsing with red light, like runway beacons.}
<D>__{resident #1 hurry it up. the shuttle's coming.}
<A>__{resident #2 regains the platform. we push in on the drink can, balanced on a buffer. it starts rattling. then suddenly shoots upward into the air, arcing and bouncing off the tunnel wall, clattering into obscurity. resident #1 whoops in victory. a rush of air heralds the shuttle. it sails out of the tunnel, floating three feet above the track. a hybrid of subway car and nautical craft, it has runners in place of wheels, like hulls on a catamaran. it is buoyed by a magnetic flow emanating from the lode poles, an invisible river known as a "lode stream". the shuttle drifts to a gentle halt, hovering, rocking a little. its gangplanks fold out toward the platform and the safety fence lowers. lincoln and the other commuters file routinely aboard.}
<L>__{interior. centerville day}

<C>__{tour member}
<D>__{this "agnate"... what happens to it? after our friend here gets his kidney.}
<C>__{dr. sanger}
<D>__{that's entirely his decision. our role is intermediary. we, as the insurance provider, guarantee the condition and availability of the agnate but all other rights are retained. in legal terms, the policy holder is defined as a "sponsor". the premiums, in effect, becoming sponsorship payments, maintaining the agnate until such time as harvest is required. at such time and where feasible, the sponsor has the option to extend sponsorship, retaining the agnate for secondary harvest or, shall we say, let the policy expire.}

<C>__{dr. sanger}
<D>__{n o . not as you and i know it, at least. the associations of life and death are no more applicable to an agnate than to a cow in a field. it exists in a state of limited consciousness aware not of life but of functionality. imbued with the knowledge to maintain its function but without the capacity to question it. and yet, in many ways, the end if the most humane part of the process. the agnate goes to harvest without any fore b o d i n g and is painlessly returned to the sleep from whence it came. eternal or otherwise. there is mortality for an agnate. just utility and redundancy.}

<C>__{dr. sanger}
