<A>__{jeffrey walks along the dark streets. the same sombre music plays low and slow. some of the houses have a few lights on, some are dark. some windows have a slow uneven blue flashing light, indicating the television is on inside. jeffrey continues walking through the night. in the trees, the shadows continuously re arrange themselves in mysterious, sometimes frightening patterns.}
