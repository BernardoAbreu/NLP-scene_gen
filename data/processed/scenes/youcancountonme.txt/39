<C>__{terry}
<D>__{yeah. i didn't realize it'd been so long...}
<A>__{he looks around the restaurant.}
<C>__{sammy}
<P>__{(beaming again)}

<C>__{terry}

<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{oh... well... that's all right...!}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{...i'm kind of trying to keep to a schedule of sorts. it's a long and worthy story but i won't trouble you with it right now.}
<A>__{he twists around and looks all over the restaurant. she watches him.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{are you expecting someone?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{who would i be expecting here?}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{you just keep looking around, that's all.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{no, i was just wondering if we could get some more refreshments, actually.}
<A>__{he laughs. looks down. silence. he looks up at her.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i've actually got to confess to you, sammy... that the reason you may not have heard from me for a little while is that i've been kind of unable to write... on account of the fact that i was in jail for a little while.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{you were what?}
<A>__{a couple of people in the restaurant look at them. terry notices but sammy does not.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{well, i did a little time, i guess, in florida. for, uh, just for bullshit...}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{it was just bullshit...}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{what did you do?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i didn't do anything. does it occur to you that maybe i was wronged?}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{well, could i please }
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{oh my god! }
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{would you please let me }
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{ what happened?!}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i got into a fight in a bar down in florida. which i was not the one who instigated it, at all. but they worked up all this bullshit against me and they threw me in the pen for three months. i didn't write you because i didn't want you to get all upset about it. i just figured you'd figure i was on the road for a little while. i know it was stupid and i'm sorry. i really didn't mean to make you worry. but you know what? i can't run around all the time doin' stuff or not doin' stuff because it's gonna make you worry! because then i come back here, and i tell you about my fuckin'... traumas, and i get this wounded little "i've let you down" bullshit, over and over again, and it really just cramps me! like i just want to get out from under it!... and here i am back in this fuckin' hole explaining myself to you again!}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{ok can you please stop cursing at me?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i mean, i realize i'm in no position to, uh, basically say anything, ever but it's not like i'm down there in some redneck bar in florida having an argument with some stripper's boyfriend and i suddenly think, "hey! maybe this'd be a good time to really stick it to sammy and get myself locked up for a few months."}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{me too, man. i mean "welcome home."}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{hey you don't write me for six months, i have no idea where you are }
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i'm sorry }
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{ i don't know if you're alive or dead }
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i'm sorry }
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{ and then you show up out of nowhere and tell me you were in jail?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i'm sorry, i'm sorry, sammy, i'm really sorry...!}
<A>__{the patrons are all either looking at them or trying not to look. silence.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{sammy...}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{um... i'm in the midst of a slight predicament...}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{what do you need? money?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{um... yeah... i'm broke. i gotta get back to worcester tomorrow. i got this girl there, and she's kind of in a bad situation...? i just need to borrow some money. whatever you can spare.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i will pay you back... i will pay you back, man.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{i really wish mom was here.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{so do i, man.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{nobody knows what to do with you.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i know how they feel, man.}
<A>__{silence, except for the sounds of the restaurant.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{terry? can i ask you something?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{sammy}
<P>__{(with some difficulty)}
<D>__{well i mean, do you ever go to church anymore?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{come on, sammy, can we not talk about that shit?}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{do you?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{um no, sammy. i don't.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{can you tell me why not?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{um, yeah. because i think it's ridiculous.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{well can you tell me without like, denigrating what i believe in?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{because i think it's primitive, ok? i think it's a fairy tale.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{well i mean, have you ever considered that maybe that's part of what's making things so difficult for you?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{ that you've lost hold of well, not just your religious feeling, but lost hold of any kind of anchor, any kind of trust in anything... i mean no wonder you drift around so much. what could ever stop you? how would you ever know if you had found the right thing?}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{well, uh, i'm not really looking for anything, man. i'm just, like, trying to get on with it.}
<A>__{the waitress approaches with their salads.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{here we go...}
<A>__{she sets them down on the table. sammy and terry thank you. the waitress leaves. silence. terry picks at his salad. sammy doesn't touch hers. she watches him miserably.}
