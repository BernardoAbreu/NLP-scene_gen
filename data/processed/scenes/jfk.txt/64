<A>__{, d.c. (1970) jim waits on the same park bench as earlier in the film, overlooking the mall or the lincoln monument... as x walks up, a little grayer, a little more stooped, wearing ill fitting civilian clothes.}

<D>__{you didn't get that break you needed, but you went as far as any man could, bubba.}
<P>__{(he sits next to jim)}
<D>__{what can i do for you?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{just speculating, i guess. how do you think it started?}
<C>__{x}
<D>__{i think it started in the wind. money arms, big oil, pentagon people, contractors, bankers, politicians like l.b.j. were committed to a war in southeast asia. as early as '61 they knew kennedy was going to change things... he was not going to war in southeast asia. who knows? probably some boardroom or lunchroom somewhere houston, new york hell, maybe bonn, germany... who knows, it's international now.}
