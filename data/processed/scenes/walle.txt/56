<A>__{dark. the elevator chimes. eve and wall e step out. rows of numbered bay doors line the hallway. eve approaches "bay #1". she and wall e enter...}
<L>__{interior escape pod bay #1 continuous}
<A>__{eve navigates the dark. approaches a freestanding console. fiddles with some buttons. on wall e he glances down at eve's hand. privately intertwines his fingers. maybe now is the right moment...}

<P>__{(quiet)}
<D>__{ee vah...?}
<A>__{flash! banks of controls light up around them.}
<B>__{an escape pod}
<A>__{is revealed at the end of the room. its hatch automatically opens. bathes the room with light from its lit interior. eve turns to wall e:}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{earth.}
<A>__{she points to an overhead screen. it displays coordinates to earth.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{earth.}
<A>__{she gestures for wall e to enter the pod. he happily complies. jumps up on one of the seats. pats the seat next to him. aren't you coming? eve remains at the threshold. shakes her head. points to her chest. makes her plant symbol glow.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{directive.}
<A>__{...she's not going. this changes everything. wall e races out of the pod. boxes up.}
<D>__{wall e}
<P>__{(beeps)}
<D>__{[then i'm not going either.]}
<A>__{eve shakes her head.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(gentle, but firm)}
<D>__{wall e.}
<A>__{carries his box back into the pod. exits. wall e follows her right back out. drives behind the console. you can't make me. eve sighs.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{wall e.}
<A>__{the hallway elevator chimes. they both look up. someone is coming. eve shuts off everything. lights go out. the pod closes back up. both eve and wall e hug the wall. blend in with the other wall fixtures. they hear something hover into the room. can't see what it is. then... an epaulet robot arm rises up over the console. presses buttons. the pod lights up again. the hatch opens. the stranger's shadow comes around the console to reveal...}
<B>__{gopher}
<A>__{eve and wall e look at each other. gopher? they watch from the shadows as... ...gopher enters the pod... ...opens his chest cavity... ...emits his suspension beam... ...and deposits the plant.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(excited whisper)}
<D>__{plant!}
<A>__{gopher exits the pod.}
<B>__{close on eve}
<A>__{she keeps her eyes on gopher. watches him return to the console. she turns to speak to wall e he's gone.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(whisper)}
<D>__{wall e?}
<A>__{wall e is inside the pod. picks up the plant. proudly shows it to eve.}
<D>__{wall e}
<P>__{(loud whisper)}
<D>__{ee vah!}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(louder whisper)}
<D>__{wall e!}
<A>__{too late. gopher hits a button. the pod door shuts on wall e... ...and launches into space. gopher shuts off the room. exits. eve leaps out of the shadows. looks out the pod bay window. wall e's pod rapidly shrinking in the distance. the plant icon on eve's chest glows. she rushes to a narrow service airlock. enters it like a phone booth.}
<B>__{outside the airlock}
<A>__{eve bursts out into space. rockets after wall e.}
