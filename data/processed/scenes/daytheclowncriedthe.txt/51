<A>__{he is delighted... he grabs the door and slams it shut with a bang that would wake the dead... then opens it again and walks off...}
<L>__{interior barracks close helmut day}
<A>__{he jumps from out of his hard sleep... foggy and unsure about where he is, what time it is and he looks around and sees the barracks are empty... and he panics... but he is also shivering... the barracks feel like the inside of a meat truck refrigerated somewhat below zero... helmut grabs his pants from the front of his bunk, pulls the cover over him and tries to get the pants on under the cover... it is cold! (photographically, we can show "cold"... props: vapor smoke.) he gets his pants on and jumps down onto the cold floor and dances from the ice like floor, he bends down looking for his socks and shoes... he wears just a tee shirt... having trouble finding both shoes, he grabs the blanket again and covers himself with it, while searching for the other shoe... he finds the other shoe and proceeds to put them on... takes a beat and sees he has no socks on... reaches under the bank and pulls out the pair of socks... which stand straight up (from the cold ... he holds them in the air, and drops one at a time and they sound like "pans" hitting the floor... he takes one and blows warm air from his mouth into the socks, one at a time, which warms them... (props: the socks need discussion!) he then proceeds to put his shoes on and puts one on, and then the other... now wearing both shoes he starts to tie the laces... he pulls them straight away to tie and they stand straight up! (props: this is done with leather laces, pure leather... it works without any unnecessary rigging!) insert the standing straight laces}

<A>__{he finally gets them tied and starts, still sleepily, into the toilet area... (we can go for a great sound joke here.) he steps into the latrine, closes the door and we hear the sound of crushed ice being poured into the bowl... he flushes and we hear what might sound like an ice crusher... he steps out of the latrine and walks over to the basin and turns the water on.}

<A>__{the water spigots... they both read "cold".}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{and as he takes some water on his hands to his face... it is "cold" and his face just freezes from the pain of the cold... he looks around and sees the little metal ashtray, that looks like a small bowl or a tin from a used shaving cream lather soap... he fills it with water.. and to show his ingenuity, he takes a lighter from his pocket, places the tin on the edge of the sink and lights the fire under the tin (which couldn't possibly hold more than a handful of water) and proceeds to heat same... once he is satisfied that it is at least warmer than the spigot supplied, he grabs for the tin which is so hot from the burning, he screams in another type pain... the pain of "hot" hurting... he decides to flick his fingers in the tin bowl and splash some of the water on his face (which is by now, just drips of water)... brushes his teeth with his finger and soap... straightens his hair and exits the toilet to his bunk to get his shirt... another "ice cold" item... he feels how cold it is, and doesn't have the courage for another climate blast... he rolls up his shirt and places it under his armpit to warm it... as it hits under his arm... the cold just about wipes him out... he decides to sit on it... and he does. close the guard at the door he's been peeking all the while... he figures he's had his laugh, and it's the first time we see he can laugh... he steps into the barracks area, and yells:}
