<L>__{interior house 3307 entry hall night}
<A>__{the doorbell rings over bauhaus music. the goth girl, wearing only the nine inch nails t shirt, opens the door. bitsey barrages past carrying the vcr, zack follows with the}
<B>__{tv.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{wanna make a hundred bucks?}
<C>__{goth girl}
<D>__{what do i gotta do?}
<L>__{interior house 3307 living room night}
<A>__{bitsey, zack and the goth girl enter.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{we're going over the crime scene.}
<A>__{bitsey checks the kitchen. the tripod's back. the other exhibit pieces haven't changed.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{and for the next hour i want you to do exactly what i say when i say to do it. if i say suck zack's dick, all i want to hear from you is 'may i swallow.'}
<C>__{goth girl}
<D>__{you want me to suck his dick?}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{it's just a patriarchal figure of speech.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{is your boyfriend here?}
<C>__{goth girl}
<D>__{he ain't exactly my boyfriend anymore.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{well is his video camera here?}
<C>__{goth girl}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{get it.}
<A>__{she starts to leave, turns back.}
<C>__{goth girl}
<D>__{i gotta collect first.}
<A>__{bitsey, moaning, reaches for her purse. closeup stereo clock reads 1:48. zack's hand enters the frame, turns the music}
<B>__{down.}
<A>__{same scene minutes later video: the goth girl's messy kitchen. camera zooms in to a perspective similar to that on the constance tape. the exhibit pieces (kitchen gloves, handcuffs, tape roll) are more or less where they were before. the goth girl enters the frame, she's removing pizza boxes and laundry from the counter.}
<C>__{zack }
<D>__{move those index cards, too.}
<A>__{she picks up the index cards. zack looks up from a video camera's eye piece. the camera is on the tripod, connected to the goth girl's tv. near it, the hotel tv vcr. bitsey cues the constance tape to the beginning, freezes the image. zack then checks the camera angle on the goth girl's tv. he moves the tvs so that they are side by side.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{zoom in a hair.}
<A>__{he does so. bitsey compares perspectives between the left tv (goth girl cleaning) to the right tv (constance).}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{put the gloves on a dish rack.}
<C>__{goth girl}
<D>__{i don't have one.}
<A>__{zack goes to the sink, lays three pizza boxes on the counter as an ersatz dish rack he drapes the kitchen gloves over them.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{turn them inside out.}
<A>__{he does so.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{move the tape roll about a foot to the left. and get rid of the handcuffs.}
<A>__{zack repositions the tape. the goth girl picks up the handcuffs.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{come check this, zack.}
<P>__{(to the goth girl)}
<D>__{could you... what's your name?}
<C>__{goth girl}
<D>__{nico's cool.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{nico, lie down on the floor, facing the counter.}
<A>__{zack comes behind the tripod and looks at the tvs. nico sits on the floor, starts to take off her t shirt.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{we can imagine that part.}
<P>__{(to bitsey)}
<D>__{i will position her.}
<A>__{he goes to nico, arranges her in the position of constance (which now bears no relation to the white outline on the floor).}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{that's fine. just straighten her legs.}
<A>__{zack comes back behind the tripod. he and bitsey look at the two tv images roughly the same. the constance tape, however, shows what looks like a white towel in the lower right hand corner. bitsey points to it.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{towel or something.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{okay, look at this.}
<A>__{she plays the tape of constance for eight seconds.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{i noticed this back at the hotel. see?}
<A>__{bitsey touches the tv screen by one of constance's feet. the foot moves ever so slightly. she hits pause.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{she moves her foot. why?}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{fucking good question.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{it's another fifteen seconds before she comes to. if she had passed out once, without fresh air she wouldn't come back. there was no head trauma, her blood tested normal }
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{jesus, maybe she was faking, hoping he would go away.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{or...}
<A>__{bitsey looks up at nico.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{we've got to bag her.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{woa. not a good idea.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{all right, i will do it.}
<A>__{same scene minutes later nico hurries from the bedroom into the kitchen. bitsey and zack stand by the sink. a white plastic bag is now on the sink counter; beside it, the roll of duct tape.}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{i found it.}
<A>__{nico hands zack the key to the handcuffs. he tests them, then lays them on the counter.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<P>__{(to zack)}
<D>__{okay, i want you to wait three minutes before you take it off.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{bitsey, i'm not so sure about this.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{three full minutes. just stand behind the tripod. both of you.}
<A>__{zack and nico move behind the tripod. bitsey puts the bag on her head, rips off a long length of tape. she seals the bag around her neck. she then handcuffs herself from behind, with some difficulty. closeup key is on the sink counter while she does this.}
<C>__{bitsey }
<P>__{(through the bag)}
<D>__{have you started?}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{twenty two seconds.}
<A>__{bitsey sits on the linoleum, then lies on her side.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{thirty seconds.}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{fuckin' wicked.}
<A>__{bitsey lies perfectly still.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{thirty five... forty... forty five... fifty.}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{maybe she shouldn't...}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{fifty five... one minute... five... ten... one fifteen...}
<A>__{bitsey starts to pull slightly at the cuffs.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{fuck. twenty... twenty five... thirty...}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{this isn't cool.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{...thirty five... fuck... one forty... one forty fi...}
<A>__{bitsey panics, fights like hell against the cuffs.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<P>__{(through the bag)}
<D>__{zack!}
<A>__{zack runs to her, knocking the tripod over. he rips the bag open. she sucks air.}
<C>__{zack}
<P>__{(ripping at the tape)}
<D>__{jesus fucking christ, bitsey. you okay? what if i'd've waited?}
<A>__{she tries to catch her breath. nico releases the handcuffs.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{no more fucking experiments, all right? just tell me what's going on. you okay?}
<A>__{bitsey nods, holds up her hand, wants to say something. she takes his arm, looks at him.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<P>__{(still breathing heavily)}
<D>__{she... she did it herself.}
<A>__{same scene minutes later zack sits on the couch holding the handcuffs and smoking. nico sits on one of its armrests. bitsey, full of adrenaline, paces in front of them, thinking out loud.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{she used the gloves to keep fingerprints off the tape and bag. then she put them back on the dish rack, but upside down and inside out, a housewives' habit. a murderer would have just tossed them aside like they were the first time we were here, like you do a towel in a hotel.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{maybe, all right, maybe.}
<P>__{(indicating the cuffs)}
<D>__{but why wear these?}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{they threw me. i forgot you have to have the key to put them on. but she needed them. she knew she would instinctively try to rip the bag off, that at some point automatism would kick in.}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{fuckin' a, like when people hang themselves. at the last second they go chicken, claw at the rope and shit. the police find their own skin beneath their nails.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{and she swallowed the key so she couldn't get to it. she made sure there was no way out.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{woa, chill, chill. why not hang yourself, or take pills. why take your fucking clothes off? why make it look like a murder?}
<A>__{a beat. bitsey contemplates.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{it's so calculated. she's handcuffed, taped at the mouth. the gloves. the damn tripod.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{why, bitsey? why fake your own murder?}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{motive's like a major issue here.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{thanks, zack.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{it doesn't make sense. the woman's a bleeding heart abolitionist. why frame an innocent man? why send gale to the chair for what looks }
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{what'd you say?}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{she had to know some innocent fuck would take the fall.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{oh my god, zack, that's it! that's why! to prove it happens. to have absolute proof that the system convicts innocents.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{get the fuck out of here.}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{no, that's how she thought. she lived for deathwatch. if she's gonna die, why not die for it? that's why the tripod was here. to record proof, undeniable proof, the tape. that's why we got an out take.}
<C>__{zack}
<D>__{a dead woman put the tape in your room?}
<C>__{bitsey}
<D>__{of course not. she needed help, someone to keep it, release it. someone she could trust, someone dedicated to the cause...}
<A>__{they stare at each other a beat. the same thought:}
<C>__{zack}
<P>__{(mimicking belyeu)}
<D>__{thick as thieves.}
