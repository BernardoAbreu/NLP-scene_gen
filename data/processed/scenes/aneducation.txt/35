<L>__{interior jenny's house. day}
<A>__{jenny and her mother are sitting on the sofa, staring into space, clearly upset. on the coffee table in front of them is the test, covered in red ink. they hear a key in the lock, and they look at each other.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{i will talk to him.}
<A>__{jack enters, back from work. he's wearing a suit and carrying a battered briefcase. he looks at them, and then notices the essay on the table.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's her latin, isn't it?}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{the test didn't...well, it didn't go as well as we'd hoped.}
<A>__{he picks up the paper.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{and you still say i shouldn't go down there and have it out with whatsername? the latin teacher? because this is hopeless.}
<C>__{jenny}
<A>__{how are you going to "have it out" with her? what are you going to do? shout at her until she decides i'm much cleverer than she thinks?}
<C>__{marjorie}
<A>__{everyone's doing their best, jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{what if their best isn't good enough, though, eh? what do we do then?}
<C>__{jenny}
<A>__{we don't go to oxford. any of us. not even you, dad.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{perhaps it's all a waste of time and money anyway.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<A>__{you don't mean that.}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{well, what's she going to do with an english degree? and if she's going to spend three years playing that bloody cello and talking in french to beatniks, then i'm throwing good money after bad. i suppose she might meet a nice lawyer. but she could do that at a dinner dance tomorrow.}
<C>__{jenny}
<A>__{oh, yes. that's the whole point of an oxford education. it's the expensive alternative to a dinner dance.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<A>__{what about private tuition?}
<C>__{jack}
<A>__{is anyone listening to me? how much is that going to cost me?}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{five shillings an hour. maybe a little more for a level.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{five bob! but... we could spend five bob on this and five bob on that, and before we know it that's our savings down the drain.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{and what else are we spending five bob on? what else are we spending sixpence on?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, nothing. (he gestures round the room.) it's all free. that vase was free.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{it was, actually. it was a present from auntie vi.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{that chair was free. the sofa. we don't have to pay for anything. and even if we did, we don't have to work for it. that's the beauty of life, jenny. everything's free. grows on trees. wonderful, isn't it? (he warms to his theme, and grows}
<P>__{progressively more berserk.)}
<D>__{we've got a lovely oxford tree in the garden, lucky for you, so that's oxford taken care of. and a whole orchard of school trees, so that's all free. i'm sure there are some private tuition trees out there. i will go and have a look.}
<A>__{he stands up.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{jack...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no, no, won't take me a minute. i think i saw some at the back there, right next to the pocket money tree. i will just nip out and check, see that they're doing all right. don't want anyone climbing over the wall and scrumping, do we? and you never know. maybe there'll be a man with deep pockets growing out there. because god knows we need to find you one. he leaves the room, apparently to look in the garden for the mythical trees.}
