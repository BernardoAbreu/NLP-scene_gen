<A>__{the diseased townsfolk have all gathered on one side of the building now, putting all their efforts into tearing down one door. some have even climbed onto the roof above it, curling off the gutter and roofing overhead.}

<A>__{bill grabs his leather satchel, and starts to reload his shotgun. starla sees that the diseased townsfolk have almost torn down one of the doors.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{this is stupid.}
<A>__{starla goes to the other door, and starts tearing away the planks they nailed there.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what are you doing?!}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{we can't make it. just get away, when you get the chance.}
<C>__{bill}

<C>__{starla}
<D>__{he wants me, bill! i'm going to get him to take me to him! see if you can follow me, and kill him!}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{no, starla! no!}
<A>__{another full metal plate is pushed off the door. a diseased man's face peeks through. trevor swirls to see it. the man gleeks, hitting trevor on his chest. trevor looks down, in shock. and the whole door and part of the wall bursts open. the diseased pour inside and around trevor, gleeking all over him, splattering his body with the burning liquid. trevor starts to puff up, swelling, becoming soft. they grab him.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{nooo!}
<A>__{bill grabs trevor by the wrist, and tries to pull him away from them. but trevor screams in agony; the liquid has made his flesh too soft. his entire body splits apart like wet tissue, his organs spilling out in front of them. bill stares down in shock, still holding trevor's arm. starla has pulled away enough boards of the other door. she throws it open. none of the diseased are on this side of the building anymore. she moves outside.}
