<L>__{exterior lane night}
<A>__{max, joan, aloka and hasari walk in silence down nizamudhin lane. there is only the mingled sound of coughing, moaning, and a transistor radio nearby playing a popular song. outside the clinic, they stop. she takes his hand.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{for a non practicing doctor, that was pretty practiced.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{never been so scared in my life.}
<A>__{it's a warm, open moment between them. but now there's the ongoing desperation of her needs.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{max, please, won't you change your mind? we desperately need another doctor. full time. think about it just give us a couple of months.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{can't do it. maybe you've got it in you to be a sainterior i just don't.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{then what do you want? what are you going to be when you grow up? good night, aloka, hasari.}
<A>__{joan goes inside, leaving max, aloka, and a very uncom fortable hasari alone a moment.}
<C>__{aloka}
<D>__{thank you for allowing me to go with you.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you could make a helluva nurse.}
<A>__{a little smile comes over her face; no one's ever paid her that kind of compliment. she goes into ram's hut, leaving max and hasari now.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{i think perhaps you are a good man.}
<A>__{hasari brings his hands together and goes inside.}
