<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what the fuck george. seriously? you said that the war was intolerable and we'd go together.}
<C>__{general miller}
<D>__{it is it is intolerable. i still agree with myself about that. but i've got to tolerate it. my loyalty is with the kids. at the end of the day i'm a soldier.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you're not a soldier.}
<C>__{general miller}
<D>__{look at the uniform, karen. i'm not a pastry chef. i have military commendations on my chest, not a little fucking label saying my name is george.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you're a politician. you live on canapes and white wine and you have three anecdotes you wheel out at every party and you scour the national papers for mentions of your name. you're a fucking politician.}
<C>__{general miller}
<D>__{i'm still a soldier.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{when was the last time you shot a guy?}
<C>__{general miller}
<D>__{what, if i haven't shot a guy in 15 years then i'm not a soldier? city hall don't insist i bring along a fucking bullet ridden corpse every five years to renew my soldier licence.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you know this is an unnecessary war. it's a war you don't believe in. show me some balls, george.}
<C>__{general miller}
<D>__{i know i've got balls, i don't need to show them to you.}
