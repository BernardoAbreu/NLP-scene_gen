<A>__{an overweight man in sweats and a ponytail counts the cash in the register. we are in a low end comic book store. the walls are lined with shelves of comic books. the more expensive issues are kept in a glass case. the ponytail man looks at his watch and then to far back of the store where one head is visible behind a low rack.}

<D>__{you better not be jacking off to the japanese comics. i swear to god.}
<A>__{no response. ponytail man closes his register and walks towards the back. as he gets closer to the customer, he realizes that the man is in a wheelchair. the ponytail man walks ups to elijah.}
<C>__{ponytail man}
<D>__{listen man, i didn't know you were in }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{just choose something all right?}
<A>__{elijah doesn't react. he sits in his chair in a quiet daze. ponytail man leans over.}
<C>__{ponytail man}
<D>__{hello. you understand english?}
<A>__{ponytail man makes fake sign language gestures in front of elijah's face.}
<C>__{ponytail man}
<D>__{look man, i'm just gonna wheel you out. you can think about things outside on the sidewalk. i gotta get some chicken in me, you know what i'm saying?}
<A>__{beat. the ponytail man shakes his head moves behind elijah. he starts wheeling him towards the front of the store. they move down a narrow aisle of comics. elijah suddenly grabs the left wheel and turns the chair. his immobilized left leg hits a rack of comic books. a handful of comics tumbles to the ground.}
<C>__{ponytail man}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{the ponytail man straightens the wheelchair and starts down the aisle again. after a couple of feet, elijah jerks and grabs the other wheel sending the wheelchair ramming violently into the opposite wall. comics are knocked free and fall onto the wheel chair and the nearby ground.}
<C>__{ponytail man}
<D>__{dude, i don't care if you are in a wheelchair. if you do that again, i'm calling five o.}
<A>__{beat. the ponytail man takes elijah's silence as a, "yes." he straightens the chair. they move down the aisle. all is quiet... and then elijah jerks the wheelchair to the left again. his metal brace and the wheelchair crash into two racks. elijah gets covered in comics.}
<C>__{ponytail man}
<D>__{that's it crackerjack! you're going to sit your ass in jail now.}
<A>__{the ponytail man moves to the front counter. elijah sits in a trance slightly hunched over. his eyes stare at a comic book in his lap. his expression changes for the first time. the ponytail man finishes dialing. he looks over to elijah as he waits for a voice on the other end. elijah raises a single comic book in his hand.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{how much is this one?}
