<C>__{austin}
<D>__{welcome to my shag pad, baby.}
<A>__{light floods the pad, revealing hanging basket chairs, hi fi, and warhol silk screens of austin. austin blows dust off a table.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{care for something to drink?}
<A>__{austin hits a button and a bookcase revolves to reveal a wetbar.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{or perhaps something to read?}
<A>__{austin walks seductively over to the real wetbar and hits a button. it revolves to reveal a bookcase.}

<D>__{would you like a... mas sage? a sensssual mas sage?}
<A>__{austin hits a button and a series of actions take place: the floor opens up to reveal a sunken bed; red gels slide into place over the lamps; a painting slides back to reveal a reel to reel; an end table revolves to reveal a selection of massage oils. felicity lies on her stomach. austin begins to massage her.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{how does that feel, baby?}
<C>__{felicity}
<D>__{mmm, lower.}
<C>__{austin}
<P>__{(lowering his voice)}
<D>__{how does that feel, baby?}
<A>__{they laugh. austin continues to massage her.}
<C>__{felicity}
<D>__{wait, something's itching me.}
<A>__{she reaches behind her and unties the strap of her evening dress, revealing her naked back.}
<C>__{felicity}
<D>__{that's better.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{crikey!!!}
<A>__{austin gulps and accidentally spurts way too much oil on her.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{austin continues the back rub and felicity stretches out on the bed.}
<C>__{austin}
<P>__{(talking to his crotch)}

<C>__{austin}
<D>__{i will get you some pjs.}
<C>__{felicity}
<D>__{no, i'm ready for bed.}
<A>__{she moves over to him. he avoids her.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{oh, you'll want to clean your teeth then.}
<A>__{austin holds up toothpaste and toothbrush. felicity finally grabs him and pins him to the bed.}
<C>__{felicity}
<D>__{no, i want to have sex with you, austin.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{hello vicar!}
<C>__{felicity}
<D>__{i've studied everything about you your methods, your accomplishments, your preferences. you're the reason i became a spy. now, i've waited two years to meet you, so i say we get busy making up for lost time.}
<A>__{austin sits up.}
<C>__{austin}
<P>__{(reflective)}
<D>__{felicity, i used to think that way, too, but i guess... i guess i've changed. not to make a short story long, or to ramble on and on, or to keep talking in a repetitive manner ad infinitum until it becomes impossible to remember what i was talking about in the first place, but where was i?}
<A>__{music: sad instrumental}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{oh yes. felicity, i can't shag you. i've lost my mojo.}
<C>__{felicity}
<P>__{(obviously disappointed)}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{i thought coming back to the sixties would bring it back, but it hasn't.}
<C>__{felicity}
<D>__{austin, don't worry. i know just the man to help you. he's my guru. ringo recommended him and he's the best.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{i will warm up the jumbo jet, baby!}
