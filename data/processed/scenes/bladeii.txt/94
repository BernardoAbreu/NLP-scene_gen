<A>__{we see a figure emerge from the shadows chupa.}
<L>__{exterior city slum night}
<A>__{chupa walks the night, scanning shadows. chupa's pov (vampire vision) like heat vision, only tinged with crimson. there are drug dealers and bottom feeding whores trolling for tricks out here, beating hearts and branching arteries highlighted on their ghostly silhouettes. chupa moves to the mouth of an alley, nodding to a dealer.}

<D>__{lookin' to get hooked up?}
<C>__{chupa}
<D>__{what you got?}

<C>__{dealer}
<D>__{horse, hawaiian ice. whatever you want.}

<C>__{chupa}
<D>__{whatever, huh? well i'm all off the hook on that bitch.}
<A>__{chupa steps into the alley with the dealer.}
<C>__{dealer}
<D>__{so what's it gonna be?}
<C>__{chupa}
<D>__{fear.}

<C>__{chupa }
<D>__{i like a little adrenaline chaser.}
<A>__{whap! a hand grabs a fistful of chupa's hair, jerking his head back. it's blade. he yanks chupa off the dealer.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{what do you think you're doing?}
<C>__{chupa}
<D>__{trying to feed, puto baboso!}
<A>__{the dealer takes off as blade swings chupa around. they exchange a couple of blows, then blade knees him in the balls, twisting him around by his arm, dislocating it. blade releases chupa, shoving him forward. chupa's broken arm dangles awkwardly. furious, chupa reaches for his .45 with his good hand only to hear the click of another gun as it's placed against the back of his head.}

<D>__{oh i haven't forgotten about asad. i'm just wondering if you have.}

<C>__{blade}
<D>__{you don't have to hunt to do it.}
<C>__{nyssa}

<A>__{blade doesn't answer, just moves away. she follows.}
<C>__{nyssa }
