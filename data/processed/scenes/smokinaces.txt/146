<L>__{interior bedroom same}
<A>__{ivy and israel, oblivious to what's gone on, fifty feet away.}
<C>__{sir ivy}
<D>__{what did you say to mecklen?}
<A>__{israel looks from the ringing phone to the gun in his bag no good ivy will kill him before he clears the bedspread.}
<C>__{israel}
<D>__{that's probably him now...}
<C>__{sir ivy}
<D>__{...see, this is one'a them rare moments when y'ass get a chance to be completely honest...and if i'm asking you what you said to mecklen, assume the shit is rhetorical...so assume i already know.}
<A>__{ivy lets that .50 caliber hang like intimidation itself. israel looks over at the ringing phone, then back at ivy. he slowly withdraws the deck of cards from his robe pocket, begins shuffling at lightspeed, firing them across his body, left to right, right to left.}
<C>__{israel}
<D>__{a set of skills, god given gifts, i close my eyes.}
<A>__{he does, snatching a card cold from the deck, turning it to ivy.}
<C>__{israel }
<D>__{king of clubs...you pick up this deck, s'just playing cards, i pick up this deck it's a living, breathing thing. what do you see right now? you see exactly and only, what i choose to show you....that's illusion ivy. that's the lie i tell your eyes. the manipulation of movement. knowing where your gaze wants to go, guiding it there. making the magic happen in that moment, that split second, but seeing behind it, knowing it's all bullshit...built on sand.}
<C>__{israel }
<P>__{(cards flying crazy)}
<D>__{i can show the feds what they want to see too. and make it as real as this room. make it more than smoke, more than mirrors...and that's why i'm valuable...and that's why you're not.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i never wanted it this way.}
<A>__{israel, a card slipping from his sleeve, into his throwing hand...ace of spades. he keeps it cupped.}
<C>__{sir ivy}
<D>__{oh you ain't done a damn thing can't be undone playa. the dye ain't even close t'cast. y'wanna make some shit real? no stage, no and lemme say this one time...}
