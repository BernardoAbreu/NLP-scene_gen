<L>__{interior swimming pool, parrish townhouse day}
<A>__{a spectacular indoor olympic pool, window commanding views of the skyline. susan is swimming laps, looking very professional in a black speedo suit, joe wanders in, still licking his peanut butter. he observes her, but she is unaware of him, however now, as she makes a barrel turn, his shadow falls over a reflection from a window, she aborts her lap, looks up to see who it is.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i'm lost.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{ can't seem to escape you today.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{susan climbs out of the pool, gets halfway up the ladder, points to a stack of towels.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{hand me one of those, will you?}
<A>__{joe turns to the towels, but one hand is occupied with the spoonful of peanut butter, he shifts it to the other hand, can't manage the huge turkish towel one handed, now implants the spoon in his mouth, lifts the towel with both hands and presents it to susan.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{you must have something really big going on with my father }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{'big'?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you appear at his side out of the blue, stay at his house, eat dinner with his family, it's practically a first. you're in the red hot center of big business and i thought you were a regular joe.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i am joe.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{not the one i met this morning, hit ting on me in as nice a way as i've been hit on in a long time, but the moment you find out i'm my dad's daughter, you act like a stranger.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{that is not my intention.}
<A>__{joe continues to nibble at his peanut butter.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{what are your intentions? to make little dreams in coffee shops, turn a woman's head, and i don't mind admitting it was turned, i liked it, but ten hours later i feel like a fool. i don't get it. you, my father, here in this house, the cof fee shop, it's making me upset, and i don't like being upset. who are you anyway? and what are you eating?}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(mumbles)}
<D>__{peanut butter.}
<A>__{he finishes the spoonful.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{but it's gone now.}
<A>__{he shifts the spoon from hand to hand, starts to stick it in his pocket, realizes this is inappropriate. susan holds her hand out to him, he places the spoon in it and she sets the spoon on the table with the towels. she watches, fascinat ed, as joe licks his gums, enjoying every last bit of his spoonful.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you act like you never had peanut butter before }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i haven't.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{ what kind of childhood did you have?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{do you love drew?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{come again?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{when you put your mouth to his, susan, it seems a frequent thing.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{drew is none of your damn business. nor is where i put my mouth.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i'm sorry. do you live here?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{no, joe, i'm swimming here. then i'm going home.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i guess what i'm trying to say is i'd like us to be friends.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i've got plenty of friends.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i don't have any.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i can see why.}
<A>__{she finishes drying herself, drops the towel on a chair, and prepares to leave.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{...i didn't mean to offend you at dinner. i'm not quite at home some times with people. i get busy doing uh what i do, and i don't seem to have developed }
<A>__{he drifts off.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{yes ?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i have a certain function to per form, and that seems to take all of my time. bu sometimes uh i speculate uh i haven't left room for uh anything else.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i'm sorry to say i know what you're saying.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{susan?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{did you know you have a wet spot on your shoulder?}
<A>__{she glances at her shoulder, he grabs a towel, touches the drops of water, pats them dry, hands her the towel. she flashes a nervous smile.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{goodnight, joe.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{goodnight to you, susan.}
<A>__{susan steps towards a door, joe takes a step in the wrong direction, they almost walk into each other. now she takes a step in another direction, as does joe, again they almost collide.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{shall we dance?}
<A>__{joe is completely puzzled, finally susan heads for one door, joe for another.}
<C>__{susan }
<D>__{joe }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i think you want to go to the west wing. through there.}
<A>__{susan indicates yet another door.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{joe redirects himself, goes to the door. as they both are about to exit, joe and susan sneak furtive looks at each other across the pool, smile at catching each other's glances. joe exits. for a moment susan's eyes remain on the door through which he has gone. now she grips the towel over her shoulders, the one joe gave her, pats the same spot he did.}
