<L>__{exterior street, new york 5:30 a.m.}
<A>__{newspaper box is loaded with the new york times .}
<L>__{exterior hotel, new york 5:30 a.m.}
<A>__{cab pulls to curb and a raincoated man emerges. we see he carries a copy of this morning's new york times .}
<L>__{interior a hotel room, new york dawn}
<A>__{a suitcase is half unpacked on the floor...a sleeping figure... there's a knock. irritated, a sleeping lowell gets up to answer it. he looks through the security peep hole. he opens it. and mike wallace, a newspaper under his arm, is standing in the doorway.}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{did i get you up?}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{no, i usually sit around in my hotel room, dressed like this at 5:30 in the morning, sleepy look on my face.}
<A>__{there's an awkward quiet. mike enters. he slows, looks around.}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{how many shows have we done? huh? c'mon, how many?}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{oh, lots.}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{yeah, that's right.}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{but in all that time, mike, did you ever get off a plane, walk into a room, and find that a source for a story changed his mind? lost his heart? walked out on us? not one fucking time! you want to know why?}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{i see a rhetorical question on the horizon.}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{i'm going to tell}
<A>__{you why. because when}
<D>__{i tell someone i'm going to do something, i deliver.}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{oh, how fortunate i am to have lowell bergman's moral tutelage to point me down the shining path. to show me the way.}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{oh, please, mike...}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{give me a break!}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{no, you}
<A>__{give me a break! i never left a}
<D>__{source hung out to dry, ever. abandoned. not 'til right fucking now! when i came on this job, i came with my word intact. i'm gonna leave with my word intact. fuck the rules of the game! hell, you're supposed to know me, mike. what the hell did you expect? you expect me to lie down? back off? what, get over it?}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{in the real world, when you get to where i am, there are}
<A>__{other considerations...}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{like what? corporate responsibility? what, are we talking celebrity here?}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<D>__{i'm not talking celebrity, vanity, cbs. i'm talking about when you're nearer the end of your life than the beginning. now, what do you think you think about then? the future? "in the future i'm going to do this? become that?" what "future"? no. what you think is: how will i be regarded in the end? after i'm gone.}
<A>__{he trails off. they look at each other.}
<C>__{mike wallace }
<D>__{now, along the way i suppose i made some minor}
<A>__{impact.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i did iran gate and the ayatollah, malcolm x, martin luther king, saddam, sadat, etcetera, etcetera. i showed them thieves in suits.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i've spent a lifetime building all that. but history only remembers most what you did last. and should that be fronting a segment that allowed a tobacco giant to crash this network?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{does it give someone at my time of life pause?}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{and the look on wallace's face is "it did. whether it should or should not...what difference does that make? it did." and we realize only now that he has not come to argue.}
<C>__{lowell}
<D>__{mike...in my...}
<C>__{mike wallace}
<P>__{(low)}
<D>__{you and i have been doing this together for fourteen years .}
<A>__{and he gives lowell a copy of the new york times .}
<C>__{mike wallace }
<D>__{this is today's new york times .}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{in it is the whole sordid story of what went on inside our shop.}
<A>__{lowell looks down at the page. the headline is "'60 minutes' ordered to pull interview in tobacco report."}
<C>__{mike wallace }
<D>__{and in the editorial... it accuses us...of betraying the legacy of edward r. murrow.}
<A>__{turning, he walks out and down the hallway. lowell looks at the newspaper.}
