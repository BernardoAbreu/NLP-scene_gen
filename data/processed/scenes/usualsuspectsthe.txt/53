<D>__{six weeks ago i get an anonymous call telling me i can find keaton eating at mondino's with his lawyer, and there he is. now because he never profited from his alleged death and because someone else was convicted for the murder we tried to pin on keaton, we had to let him go.}
<L>__{interior rabin's office}
<C>__{kujan }
<D>__{he was dead just long enough for a murder rap to blow over, then he had lunch.}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{i don't know about that.}
<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{i don't think you do. but you say you saw keaton die. i think you're covering his ass and he's still out there somewhere. i think he was behind that whole circus in the harbor. my bet is he's using you because you're stupid and you think he's your friend. you tell me he's dead, so be it. i want to make sure he's dead before i go back to new york.}

<C>__{kujan }
<D>__{every cop who owes me a favor, every creeping scumbag that works the street for a living, will know the name of verbal kinterior you'll be the lowest sort of rat, the prince of snitches, the loudest cooing stool pigeon that ever grabbed his ankles for the man. now you talk to me, or that precious immunity they've seen so fit to grant you won't be worth the paper the contract put out on your life is printed on.}
