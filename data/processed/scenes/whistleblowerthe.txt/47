<L>__{interior madeleine rees' office sarajevo morning}
<A>__{kathy sits alone in the office. degrees, plaques, and awards cover the walls. pictures of madeleine rees with kofi annan, bill clinton, nelson mandela... kathy is intimidated. madeleine rees, 50s, tall, commanding, short blonde hair, british. she sashays in with a doberman on a leash.}
<C>__{madeleine rees}
<D>__{don't mind helen, she's a total sap.}
<A>__{kathy eyes the malevolent hound.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{ms. rees, i }
<C>__{madeleine rees}
<D>__{madeleine. you've been stirring things up.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{is this about zlata sehik? if i've overstepped protocol }
<C>__{madeleine rees}
<D>__{you have done in two months, what we've been trying to do for years.}
<A>__{madeleine sits. kathy straightens.}
<C>__{madeleine rees }
<D>__{all due respect to viko mezovic, but you just facilitated the first conviction for domestic abuse in bosnian history. i'm bloody impressed. so is the dutch duty officer who recommended you.}
<A>__{kathy takes it in. madeleine looks out the window at two glass towers that punctuate sarajevo's skyline.}
<C>__{madeleine rees }
<D>__{the iptf has a gender affairs office at mission headquarters. dervla hughes, the current head, is leaving and i think you're the right person to take over.}
<A>__{kathy is taken aback.}
<C>__{madeleine rees }
<D>__{you'd be overseeing 12 regional offices. any gender reports come through you. this involves anything from equality training to domestic and child abuse cases, fallout from war crimes against women, prostitution. women in bosnia are treated like second class citizens. you could have a real impact on their lives. what do you think? are you interested?}
<A>__{this is everything kathy came to do...}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{absolutely.}
