<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i'd change that in you if i could, but that's not why i come. i might be wrong, mr. hutton, but i expect... colored people will most likely be free, and when that's so, it's simple truth that your brother's bravery, and his death, helped make it so. only you can decide whether that's sense enough for you, or not.}
<A>__{hutton walks slowly back to his house.}
