<A>__{he turns away from the window and we follow him. the interior of the bank looks like new orleans on fat tuesday. three hummers sit in the middle of the floor, surrounded by broken glass. between them rests a bright red ferrari f50 (gabriel's). all but one of the front windows of the bank, the one with the door in it, has been welded over with 3 4 inch plate steel. over two dozen hostages lie face down on the floor, arms cable tied behind their backs. something has been duct taped around their chests and each is wearing what appears to be a dog collar. the other occupants of the room are nine men. all of whom would look as if they were attending the fashion event of the year were it not for the automatic weapons each one carries.}
