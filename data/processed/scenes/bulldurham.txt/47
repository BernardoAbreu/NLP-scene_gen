<L>__{interior annie's living room night}
<A>__{the shrine of baseball glows annie lights the candles. ebby and crash sit on opposite ends of her couch both men look around the room with wonder. ebby is clearly more nervous than crash, who's been in some strange rooms in his minor league career.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{these are the ground rules.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i hook up with one guy a season i mean it takes me a couple of weeks to pick the guy kinda my own spring training...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and, well, you two are the most promising prospects of the season so far.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so... i thought we should get to know each other.}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{why do you get to choose? why don't i get to choose?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{actually none of us on this planet ever really choose each other. it's all quantum physics and molecular attraction. there are laws we don't understand that bring us together and break us apart.}
<C>__{ebby}
<D>__{is somebody gonna go to bed with somebody or what?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{you're a regular nuclear meltdown, honey slow down.}
<A>__{crash rises to leave, and heads for the door.}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{after 12 years in the minor leagues, i don't tryout. besides i don't believe in, quantum physics when it comes to matters of the heart... or loins.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(challenging him)}
<D>__{what do you believe in?}
<A>__{crash at the door. annie's question is slightly taunting. he stops, and speaks with both aloofness and passion:}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{i believe in the soul, the cock, the pussy, the small of a woman's back, the hanging curve ball, high fiber, good scotch, long foreplay, show tunes, and that the novels of thomas pynchon are self indulgent, overrated crap.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i believe that lee harvey oswald acted alone, i believe that there oughtta be a constitutional amendment outlawing astro turf and the designated hitter, i believe in the "sweet spot", voting every election, soft core pornography, chocolate chip cookies, opening your presents on christmas morning rather than christmas eve, and i believe in long, slow, deep, soft, wet kisses that last for 7 days.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(breathless)}
<D>__{oh my...}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{don't leave...}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{g'night.}
<A>__{crash heads out into the night. annie hurries to the door while ebby sits on the couch, bewildered.}
<C>__{ebby}
<D>__{hey what's all this molecule stuff?}
<A>__{annie stands in the doorway crash is on the porch.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{wait, crash don't go all i want is a date. i'm not gonna fall in love with you or nothin'.}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{i'm not interested in a woman who's interested in that boy.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i'm not interested yet.}
<A>__{ebby appears in the door.}
<C>__{ebby}
<D>__{who you calling a "boy"?}
<C>__{crash}
<D>__{see ya at the yard, meat.}
<A>__{crash walks out into the durham night. ebby and annie stand in the doorway. she speaks softly to ebby.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{no ballplayer ever said "no" to a date with me.}
<C>__{ebby}
<D>__{well shit, then, let's fuck.}
