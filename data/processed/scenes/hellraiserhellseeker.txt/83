<L>__{interior tawny's apartment, bedroom night}
<A>__{tawny lies on the bed, dead, tongue sticking out of her neck, ribcage violated. trevor hears someone coming toward the bedroom can see the flashlight beam jittering as its bearer approaches. trevor rushes toward the window, opens it and leaps out onto the fire escape.}
<L>__{exterior apt. building night}
<A>__{trevor's about to climb down the fire escape when he is bathed in the flashlight's beam from inside. trevor looks down and sees a garbage dumpster full of trash bags below. he jumps. trevor sails down three stories and lands in the dumpster. he climbs out and runs to the street as fast as he can. he races down the sidewalk trying to get his bearings at the same time. hearing footsteps from behind trevor turns to see: the stranger in the window not half a block behind trevor, keeping trevor's pace. then... trevor stops. and turns. the stranger stops as well. this has never happened before. trevor shouts down the empty street.}
<C>__{trevor }
<D>__{who are you!}
<A>__{his voice echoes off the darkened buildings. the stranger stands there. trevor begins walking toward him, blood in his eyes. the stranger backs away. trevor bolts into a run and the stranger takes off running the other way. the stranger darts into an alley.}
