<A>__{a series of shots as tim sweaty, high and extremely hyper dances with bree to the deafening death metal. the party is a volatile mix of biker types and speed freaks. even though his salmon colored oxford shirt has come untucked from his casual slacks, tim still looks a tad out of place. the following conversation is shouted because of the music.}

<D>__{i feel amazing! this is awesome!}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{how much money do you have on you?}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{ah, cash wise? about 90 dollars, i think. i've got a ton of traveler's checks, though. why?}
<C>__{bree}
<D>__{i will get us some more crypto. then you can fuck me if you want.}
<C>__{tim}
<P>__{(not sure he heard right)}

<A>__{tim pauses. then what the heck. he unzips his money belt...}
