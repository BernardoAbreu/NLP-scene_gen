<A>__{a gas station right out of the fifties. an attendant in a uniform and cap whistles while he wipes down the windshield of a sky blue rambler. in the background, anderson walks toward a men's room.}
<L>__{interior the men's room}
<A>__{anderson looks at himself in the mirror. he reaches out and touches one reflected eye, which is a deep brown. it is still startling to him, the color of his eyes. then he reaches into his duffel bag and takes out the air syringe doc gave to him. he looks at it nervously. it is filled with 5 cc's of an opaque green liquid. he touches the tip of it to the soft center under his chin. he closes his eyes. then he screws up his courage, and hits the plunger. the liquid is pneumatically delivered with a searing hiss. anderson screams out in agony, slams back against the wall of the bathroom. his hands reach up for his face which looks like it's boiling from within. anderson's face the skin on both cheeks begins to pucker. the muscle tone around his chin goes soft, and begins to sag like an old man's. that is the effect like he is aging fifty years. his forehead wrinkles, the skin under his eyes droop. healthy pink is replaced by bloodless gray.}
