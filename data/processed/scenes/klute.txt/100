<L>__{interior cable's (city) office: on klute day}
<A>__{the pristine, antiseptic, elegance off cable's office is in its own way as unreal and dehumanized as the sexual underworld klute has been exploring with bree, and klute looks as out of place in the one as he does in the other. trask sits beside klute facing cable who is impeccably dressed. he is the total image of the executive in control.}
<C>__{cable}
<D>__{she wouldn't be reliable anyhow a narcotics addict.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{i believed her, pete.}
<C>__{trask}
<D>__{he's right you know. waiting for the pusher, she'd tell you anything.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{i believed her: the dumper was not tom grunemann.}
<C>__{cable}
<D>__{all right, suppose it wasn't tom grunemann; where does that get you?}
<C>__{klute}
<P>__{(smiles ruefully)}
<D>__{it's where it doesn't get me. i've got nothing left that connects to anything.}
<C>__{cable}
<D>__{then, close the case.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{i better keep looking.}
<C>__{cable}
<D>__{where, how?}
<C>__{klute}
<P>__{(the best he can offer)}
<D>__{i could try arlyn page again. she saw much more of the dumper than bree daniel.}
<C>__{cable}
<D>__{you just finished telling me she had nothing to offer. not tom, you said, the dumper was clearly not tom.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{it's got to make sense some way.}
<A>__{cable's secretary appears for a moment tapping her watch significantly.}
<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{mr. cable they are meeting in mr. camara's office.}
<C>__{cable}
<D>__{yes evvie, thanks. gentlemen, i'm sorry.}
<A>__{they rise, dismissed. he sorts a paper or two, continues to klute.}
<C>__{cable }
<D>__{i'm flying back out to pennsylvania friday; i will fill them in on things.}
<C>__{klute}
<D>__{how is it back there?}
<C>__{cable}
<D>__{i think you're homesick.}
<P>__{(reflects)}
<D>__{i will be out at my camp over the weekend. nice right now, that touch of fall in the air, that skim of frost in the early mornings, very peaceful.}
<P>__{(briskly again)}
<D>__{john, i will be back here again thursday; i will be in touch. lieutenant, thank you.}
<A>__{klute and trask depart. cable closes the door and returns to his desk. he pulls out a tape recorder from a drawer in his desk, rewinds it and turns it on. we hear a playback of the previous scene with klute and trask. he stands at the window listening with some satisfaction; as if listening to what klute revealed keeps him in control of the situation.}
