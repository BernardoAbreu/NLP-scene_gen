<C>__{erin }
<D>__{i don't want to be me anymore. make me like you.}
<A>__{erin's face blasted white by headlights. she closes her eyes as alex begins the first bold lines around her eyes and for a moment in the gauzy white light, she could be... lauren opens her eyes a second, smiles, shuts them again. wider. alex paints erin's face in the benz headlights, the two of them kneeling in the forest cathedral. camera creeps backward, leaving the two of them connected by ritual. and touch. and a promise to each other.}
