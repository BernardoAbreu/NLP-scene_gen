<C>__{bb}
<D>__{you want to get in good with these people... you want to win their confidence? good thing to try... get a five dollar bill, take it out when the guy's not looking, drop it on the ground. guy looks back, pick it up, hand it to him and say, 'mr. blah blah, you musta dropped this five dollar bill on the ground.' two things happen... he says, 'it's not mine,' you say, 'musta been, 'cos it's certainly not mine,' or the guy takes it. right away this guy is thinking you must be one hell of a nice guy... you're in. you start chipping away... you start getting inside those people.}
