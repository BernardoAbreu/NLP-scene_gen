<L>__{exterior border brush country night}
<A>__{title card: somewhere along the texas border a group of illegals hunker down in the brush, creeping in the moonlight. one of them coughs and seizes, obviously sick. another points at a water station up ahead, pulling the sick man along. headlights of a large truck appear over a ridge. a spotlight scans the brush, catches them. armed men ride in the bed of the truck.}
