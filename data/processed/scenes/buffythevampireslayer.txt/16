<A>__{grueller walks through the trees, enters an enclosed clearing of grass. he hears something, stops. maybe his name, maybe just the bushes rustling. he looks about him, hesitantly. starts forward, stops again.}
<C>__{grueller}
<D>__{yo! who is that? don't mess with me man, i will rip your head off.}
<A>__{nothing.}
<C>__{grueller}

<D>__{come on, come out here. let's see what you got.}
<A>__{rustling. no one.}

<D>__{forget this.}
<A>__{he turns on his heel, ready to drop all show and bolt. wally bessel is right behind him. wally is a ninth grader, small, nerdy, and recently undead. in marked contrast to the older vampire in the prologue, wally is freshly undead. he still has fat on his face; in fact, he looks almost normal from afar. but his inhuman eyes and his uncommon pallor mark him as a vampire. and the way he speaks is unearthly. hollow, almost detached; repeating phrases sometimes almost as though he had never heard them before. he smiles at grueller.}

<D>__{bessel! what are you doing here?}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{hi, grueller.}
<C>__{grueller}

<C>__{wally}
<D>__{could be.}
<A>__{grueller grabs wally by his shirt collar and readily hoists his small body up, wally's feet dangling two feet off the ground.}
<C>__{grueller}
<D>__{listen, you little worm. i could beat your head to a pulp for you, just like i did last year, you got that? you got that?}
<C>__{wally}
<P>__{(repeating)}
<D>__{got that.}
<C>__{grueller}
<D>__{good.}

<D>__{what the...}
<A>__{wally smiles even more broadly, quietly hissing. he has long fangs, made somehow more grotesque by the fact that he also has braces. wally's hands vise onto grueller's head, lightning quick. grueller screams. angle pike and benny crossing a street, turning and listening. angle jeffrey's car speeding by, everyone packed into it. andy howls back at grueller, mistaking his intent. he settles back. the girls are looking at him.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{it's um... you had to be there.}
<A>__{in the front seat next to jeffrey, buffy winces slightly.}
