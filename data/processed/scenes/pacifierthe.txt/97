<L>__{exterior mall parking lot continuous}
<A>__{shane (tyler in snuggle), loads brownies into the minivan, counting them. barking at them like marines:}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{move, move, move! go go!}
<L>__{exterior suburban road moments later}
<A>__{shane drives, the brownies are singing 99 bottles... again. suddenly, a look of horror comes across shane's face... he spins the minivan in a 180 and floors it.}
<L>__{interior chuck e. cheese later dusk}
<A>__{shane (tyler in snuggle) bursts in, the brownies follow. we see what he forgot: peter, still happily playing in the pool of plastic balls. the manager is watching him.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{i figured you'd come back for him they almost always do.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{inexcusable, to leave a man behind like that...}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{relax, we once found a kid in the ball pool when we opened in the morning }
<A>__{shane wades into the ball pool and pulls peter out, which is fine, except that he's missing his diaper.}
<C>__{manager }
<D>__{whoa, whoa. not okay, freestyling in the ball pool not okay.}
<B>__{s}
<A>__{shane grimaces. he holds his breath, and goes down for the diaper. he disappears under the balls for a long time. the manager and the brownies share a concerned look. he's still down there. silence.}
<C>__{lulu}
<D>__{should we send someone in after him?}
<A>__{he surfaces, gasping. he's holding the diaper, out away from him. he charges across the room with the diaper.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{clear out! go go go!}
<A>__{and he bursts out the other doors, at a full run.}
