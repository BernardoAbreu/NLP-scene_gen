<A>__{jack walks into the room holding a file folder. zoey is sitting on the couch trying to get a grip. jack throws the file in her lap.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{so is the file folder for dramatic effect?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no it was to keep everything organized...}

<D>__{...and for dramatic effect.}
<A>__{suddenly zoey's cell phon rings. she sets the folder aside and answers.}

<L>__{intercut exterior street corner}
<A>__{quinn is on a pay phone, he's shaking. at this point he is lost on what his next move should be.}

<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{i thought that was the whole plan.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{no it's...this isn't like louis. i think he is trying to cheat his way to a win.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{why don't you come over here.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{i can't!}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{come on quinn get a grip. just calm down and come over here.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{you're right.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{ok so just come on over and we'll talk.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{no i mean you're right. i need to get control of myself. i have a destiny. i need to figure out my next move.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{quinn? no wait }
<A>__{quinn hangs up the phone. zoey and anna's apartment zoey slowly drops her cell phone to the floor. jack picks up the folder zoey set aside.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{i don't know. he's losing it.}
<A>__{jack hands her the folder.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you need to look at this.}
<A>__{zoey takes the folder from him and starts reading.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{i spent a lot of time gathering that information.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{so what is all this?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{quinn wilson and louis marks were orphans.}
<A>__{zoey is flipping through documents.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{quinn displayed some erratic behavior from the beginning. one of the staff members was mormon and they would read stories to quinn out of the book of mormon. that employee was later fired, but a seed was planted in quinn's head. he kept going on about how he and louis were meant to fight to the death. some of the children at the time claim louis would encourage this behavior. he probably thought this was quinn's attempt at playing.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{as things continued the staff at the orphanage thought quinn needed help beyond what they could offer. they sent quinn to a hospital.}
<A>__{zoey puts the folder down, the documents fall to the floor.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{you're not telling me anything i didn't already know.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{that makes it worse. you're going to continue this now that you know for a fact that he is nuts?}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{i'm too far into this now. i don't have a choice.}
<A>__{zoey picks the documents up and places them in the folder. she then tosses the folder on the coffee table.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{why don't you let us save you? please zoey.}
<C>__{zoey}
<D>__{let me be guys.}
<A>__{zoey walks to her bedroom, leaving anna and jack exhausted. zoey and anna's apartment early morning the apartment is quiet. anna no where in sight, more than likely in her room sleeping. jack is passed out on the couch. zoey walks in, it's obvious she hasn't slept all night. she scoots jack's legs over and sits on the couch. she proceeds to pick up the file folder. she starts thumbing through the documents. after a few moments she finds one of interest. she reaches over and pushes jack.}
