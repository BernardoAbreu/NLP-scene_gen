<C>__{brad}
<D>__{i mean hardly any thigh. i'm telling you, joey; shorter skirt, more lift on the leg cross ... and you're made.}
<A>__{doc chuckles in a half friendly, half sleazy way.}
<C>__{joey}

<C>__{brad}
<D>__{what, you think i'm kidding? i guarantee it. an inch more flank. boys upstairs get hot. bingo, you're an anchor woman.}
<C>__{joey}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{jesus christ ...}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{ah, give her a break.}
<A>__{doc leans over and stops the tape.}
<C>__{brad}
<P>__{(to doc)}
<D>__{what's with you?}
<A>__{he swivels his chair round to face joey.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{c'mon, joey. i'm just trying to help you hit a home run here.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{yeah? well, you just struck out. it may be a surprise to you, brad, but i want to do it the right way. not tight skirts. tight stories.}
<C>__{brad}

<D>__{no. not on station time. my story. my time.}
<A>__{joey exits. brad watches her leave with a half smile on his face then turns to doc.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{lot of attitude there, doc ...}
<A>__{he starts up the video tape again and, on the monitors, joey once again crosses her legs on the couch.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{... but great legs.}
