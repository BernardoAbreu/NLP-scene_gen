<T>__{camera on:}
<A>__{i e. highway to border dinko's car night judy's got the camera trained on herself. she talks like a child.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{mexicooooooh....}
<A>__{judy points the camera up at jimmy. this is the first time we've seen him at all since he was beaten up by uncle rodney's group. he's a wreck. his face is puffy. his lip is cut up. his eye is swollen. he looks like a flyweight boxer who just went fifteen rounds with a heavyweight. he drives with one arm because the other one is in a bandage.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{hey baby.}
<A>__{jimmy looks like a beaten man, both physically and emotionally. his bad ass attitude and rebellious charisma are seemingly non existent. for the first time, we are seeing jimmy without his armor. he looks like any other 21 year old kid who is down, vulnerable, and confused. not to mention the fact that he has a fucking bullet lodged in his shoulder.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{baby?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{come on. not the camera.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{nooooo. it reminds me of when we first met. just you, me, and the camera. god, do you remember how you used to freak me out?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{yeah, those were the good old days. how much money do we have?}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{i don't know, why?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{how do you feel about canada? it's closer.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{are we going together?}
<A>__{jimmy looks over at her.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i think i should take you home.}
<A>__{judy doesn't answer.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i could write you a letter. or i could make a video saying i made you do everything. they'd believe you. you could tell them it was all my fault. you could tell them i was going to mexico and i'd really go to canada.}
<A>__{jimmy swallows.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{we swore on the bond we'd never be apart... but...}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{i will let you out of it... if you want to be out of it, i will let you out.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{you're never leaving me, and i'm never leaving you. that's all there is to it.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{judy leans in and kisses him.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{owww.}
<A>__{judy comes back into the passenger seat and just films him. she likes looking at him through the lens.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{you're so handsome, you know that?}
<A>__{jimmy smiles as best he can with his face all messed up. then his eyes get droopy and close. he's not responding. he's as punch drunk as you can get.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{jimmy?}
<A>__{jimmy's obviously in a concussion induced daze. the car starts to drift. judy drops the camera on the seat as we hear her leap forward to take control of the car.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{jimmy!}
<C>__{jimmy }
<P>__{(snaps to)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{jimmy, stop the car. you're too fucked up to drive.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<P>__{(groggy)}
<D>__{huh? oh... okay.}
<A>__{camera shuts down.}
