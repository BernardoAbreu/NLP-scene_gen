<A>__{the surface of malcolm's desk is covered with open texts. malcolm pours over a thick reference book. he circles a phrase... "...resulting bruises and abrasions on arms and legs may, in fact, be self inflicted." malcolm appears disturbed by the thoughts running through his head. anna's muffled voice carries down the stairs. his face turns up to the ceiling.}

<P>__{(loud)}
<D>__{are you calling me?}
<A>__{we hear anna's footsteps move across the basement ceiling. we}

<C>__{anna }
<D>__{what? you don't see enough of me at the store?}
<A>__{malcolm gets up and moves closer to their voices as he stretches his legs.}
<C>__{man's voice }
<D>__{on my way to the flea market in amish country. thought maybe you want to come. show me how to buy at these things.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{i trust you... besides, i don't know if i'm up for the amish today. you can't curse or spit or anything around them.}
<A>__{malcolm smiles at anna.}
<C>__{man's voice }
<D>__{i thought you'd want to get out. you've been kind of down.}
<A>__{malcolm slowly stops smiling.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{that's very sweet. i'm okay.}
<C>__{man's voice }
<D>__{do you think i should stop by on my way back? show you what i got? it's not a problem.}
<A>__{malcolm shakes his head in disbelief.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{you know that's probably not the best idea. i will just wait to see them in the store.}
<C>__{man's voice }
<D>__{okay. fine. understood.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm off then.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{don't step in the horse manure.}
<C>__{man's voice }
<D>__{thanks.}
<B>__{we hear the front door shut.}
