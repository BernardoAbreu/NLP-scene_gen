<L>__{exterior st. cloud's train station day}
<A>__{homer at the train station, staring down the empty tracks. buster is hanging around with him, kicking a rock.}
<C>__{buster}
<D>__{do you ever think about leaving this place to go find them?}
<A>__{homer makes no response. as the train approaches, homer and buster go sit on a loading cart. they see the distraught woman (no longer pregnant) from homer's experience of a few nights ago; she is leaving st. cloud's without her baby, waiting for the approaching train. her face is a mask. the disapproving stationmaster gives her a hard look.}
<C>__{buster}
<D>__{i mean your parents.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{i know who you mean. i think about leaving here, but not to find them.}
<C>__{buster}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{whoever they were, they didn't do any of the things parents are supposed to do. dr. larch did those things, and nurse edna, and nurse angela.}
<C>__{buster}
<D>__{yeah. but sometimes i wish i could meet mine, anyway.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{what for, buster? what would you do if you met them?}
<C>__{buster}
<D>__{uh... i'd like to show them that i can cook, a little.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{you cook very well!}
<C>__{buster}
<D>__{and that i can drive a truck!}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{better than i can!}
<C>__{buster}
<D>__{sometimes i want to meet them so i can kill them. just sometimes.}
<A>__{buster is ashamed; he knows he's said the wrong thing.}
<C>__{buster}
<D>__{homer, you know i would never kill anyone you know i wouldn't.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{the slowly moving train has stopped. there are soldiers leaning out the windows. buster turns to see mary agnes walking past the train she's doing her best to look grown up, sophisticated. one of the soldiers reaches out and gently tugs on her hair. mary agnes is enraged; she spits at the soldier.}
<C>__{buster}
<D>__{i think mary agnes could kill someone.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{i doubt it. she's just an...}
<A>__{mary agnes spits at all the soldiers.}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{...emotional girl.}
<A>__{the soldiers roll up the windows as mary agnes improvises some verbal abuse.}
<C>__{buster}
<D>__{what's she so emotional about?}
<C>__{homer}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{i don't know. she got left here, like the rest of us, didn't she?}
<A>__{camera closes on homer.}
