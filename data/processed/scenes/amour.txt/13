<A>__{he hesitates.}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{you don't have to hold my hand all the time now. i can look after myself, you know.}
<A>__{he nods.}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{and don't feel guilty. that would be pointless. and a drag. for me too.}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{i don't feel guilty.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{that's good.}
<A>__{she smiles.}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{go over there now. i'm not a cripple. you can easily leave me alone for two minutes. i won't collapse.}
<C>__{georges}
<P>__{(with a slight smile)}
<D>__{ok.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{did you buy the new book on harnoncourt?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{i've already read it.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{and?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{do you want it? i will get it for you.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{he goes out of the room to fetch the book. she remains lying there, waiting, and runs her healthy left hand through her hair to make herself look prettier, then smooths out the blanket that has slipped out of place a little. after a while, we hear georges shouting.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{i don't know where i put it.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{don't worry. it isn't that important.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{yes, it is. hold on, maybe it's in the... just a moment! viola! here you are! nothing like an infallible memory!}
<A>__{she smiles, looks in his direction. he enters with the book in his hand.}
<C>__{georges }
<D>__{i thought i'd left it over there in the other room, but i'd already put it away. tidy people just can't help being tidy.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(taking the book)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{she puts the book on her stomach. looks at georges.}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{right now, take care of yourself. and don't wait to see how i hold the book in my hand, ok?}
<C>__{georges}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{he looks at her for a moment longer, then leaves the bedroom. she waits till he's outside. tries to relax. then she remembers the book. she takes it in her left hand and tries to open it. it's not easy for her. then she notices that she's forgotten her glasses. she rests the book back on the bed cover and fishes for her glasses on the night stand. in the end, she manages it. then she opens the book again, and tries to read.}
