<L>__{interior elaine's house}
<A>__{as samuel comes out of the guest room in his night shirt, turns up the hall and opens the door to the bathroom.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{but it's not the bathroom; it's elaine's bedroom. she and fred are tangled in the sheets, furiously making love. elaine gasps, fred manages to grunt.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{wrong door, kid.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{as samuel quickly shuts the door. a straight faced beat; then, barely suppressing a giggle, he hurries on...}
<B>__{angle in living room}
<A>__{as rachel appears in the living room entry. samuel is sitting on the floor with two boys of about his own age, watching television. they're eating cold cereal out of a box. rachel's pov tv screen some artless saturday morning cartoon.}
<B>__{back to rachel}
<A>__{as she frowns, watching her son and the other two staring hypnotically. and...}
<B>__{angle in living room}
<A>__{it's later in the morning now, as elaine, a bit blearily, appears in the entryway, stares in groggy disbelief.}
<B>__{her pov kids}
<A>__{her oldest boy and samuel are busily washing the windows while her youngest is pushing a carpet sweeper. the tv is off.}
<B>__{back to elaine}
<A>__{as she stares.}
<B>__{angle in kitchen}
<A>__{rachel is standing in the middle of the now immaculate kitchen finishing a brisk mop of the floor. the coffee is perking. elaine appears.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(mutters)}
<D>__{jesus...}
<A>__{rachel turns cheerily.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{good morning.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(helplessly)}
<D>__{you didn't have to...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i wanted to. you were kind to take us in last night.}
<P>__{(and)}
<D>__{anyway, i needed something to do. i was so angry with your brother. he's so... agaanisish!}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{aganishish? yeah, that sounds like john.}
<A>__{she takes a seat at the table, still shaking her head.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{just a minute. i will pour you some coffee.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{you're not carrying a bullwhip... how'd you manage to put my kids to work?}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i made it a contest... the one who does best gets his cereal back first.}
<P>__{(and)}
<D>__{children like to help... they only need to be kept after a little bit.}
<A>__{rachel means no harm by this, but elaine's eyes begin to storm.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{oh, is that so?}
<P>__{(and)}
<D>__{no offense, lady, but i'm not so sure i like the idea of your coming in here and turning the place upside down!}
<A>__{rachel's smile fades at elaine's trembling outburst:}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{please, i didn't mean...}
<A>__{abruptly elaine rises and snatches the mop from rachel's hands. she mops furiously as she continues:}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{i know exactly what you meant! listen, maybe i'm not a world class housefrau, but maybe i don't have time to polish the goddamn china and keep after the kids!}
<P>__{(and)}
<D>__{it's none of your business, but i don't happen to have a man around here full time. so i sell cosmetics in a goddamn drugstore and sometimes i can even pay the rent on time! so maybe i'm not mary poppins, but maybe i don't need to have it jammed down my throat like this.}
<A>__{she finishes the floor, hurls the mop aside with a clatter:}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{there is that clean enough for you?}
<A>__{rachel is speechless, elaine is on the point of bursting into tears. at which point fred appears at the entry in his undershirt, taking in the sparkling kitchen.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{jesus, elaine... somebody die and leave you a broom?}
<A>__{not a politic observation on fred's part.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(blurts)}
<D>__{go to hell, fred!}
<A>__{and, bursting into tears, she flees the kitchen. fred stares after her.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{what's bugging her?}
<A>__{unperturbed, he crosses to the counter and the coffee pot, letting his eyes take in rachel's full figure.}
