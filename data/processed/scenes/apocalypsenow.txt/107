<L>__{95 full shot the point kilgore, willard , lance, others}
<A>__{kilgore watches the waves with his field glasses smoke drifts over. lance crouches below. willard is up looking off in another direction. shells scream over, but even their noise is drowned out by the fierce shriek of the phantoms and the deafening blast of high explosives. willard stares at the tree line where it comes down to the river. the jets are making a hell of the tree line; a hell of fire and bust ling steam thet nothing could live in. willard's glance goes further downriver through the black smoke and there merging in the river small and vulnerable, is his boat.}
<C>__{willard}
<P>__{(to lance)}
<D>__{look. there it is; the boat.}
<A>__{lance looks over a tremendous relief on his face. but still there remains the threat of kilgore, standing stark against the sky. willard silently motions lance toward the boat.}
<C>__{lance}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{he'll kill us.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{he can't kill us.}
<P>__{(realizing as he says it)}
<D>__{we're on his side.}
<A>__{kilgore fires another clip at the tree line, and then strides back without looking at them.}
<C>__{kilgore}
<P>__{(almost to himself)}
<D>__{you smell that.}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{you smell that?}
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{kilgore}
<D>__{napalm, boy nothing else in the world smells like that }
<A>__{they reflect the glow from the burning trees.}
<C>__{kilgore}
<P>__{(continuing; nostalgically)}
<D>__{i love the smell of napalm in the morning. one time we had a hill bombed for 12 hours. i walked up it when it was all over; we didn't find one of 'em ... not one stinking gook body. they slipped out in the night but the smell that gasoline smell the whole hill it smelled like ...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{victory...}
<A>__{he looks off nostalgically.}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{you know, some day this war's gonna end..}
<C>__{kilgore}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{yes, i know.}
<A>__{suddenly he senses something he stops lifts his hand then frantically licks his fingers and puts them up in the air.}
<C>__{kilgore}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{the wind }
<C>__{lance}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{sure enough there is a rushing breeze that increases.}
<C>__{kilgore}
<P>__{(rising maniacally)}
<D>__{feel it it's the wind it's blowing on shore it's on shore !}
<A>__{he leans down and practically grabs lance.}
<C>__{kilgore}
<P>__{(continuing; screaming)}
<D>__{it's gonna blow this place out. it's gonna ruin it ...}
<C>__{willard}
<D>__{the kid can't ride sloppy waves.}
<A>__{they turn and stare out to sea.}
