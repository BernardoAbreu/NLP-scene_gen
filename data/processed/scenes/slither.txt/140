<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{our foursome look up to see a buick century parked at a haphazard angle in the middle of the road. the driver's side door is open. the headlights are still on. they look at each other. bill takes his flashlight off his belt and aims it in front of him. they all slowly approach the car, in the darkness. bill aims his flashlight into the buick. the keys are still there, but no one's inside. trevor looks at the grill of the car. it's dented.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{they musta hit a deer. probably got out to see if it's okay.}
<A>__{bill and the others look around. bill hears a lapping sound behind him. he turns, aiming the flashlight downward. a diseased deer is lapping a thick purple tongue on the wound of a dead man. the sick creature is mostly hairless and pink and covered in veins. bulbous black eyes hang on the sides of its head like a goldfish's. the diseased deer glances up at bill and growls a low growl.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{fuck me.}
<A>__{the deer springs upward, bringing his hoofs into bill's chest. bill is knocked violently to the gravel, dropping his shotgun and satchel. the deer rears back and brings his hoofs down into bill again. they crack bill's head against the hard road. kylie, trevor, and starla see diseased deer coming in at them from different directions. the deer screech like dying rabbits.}

<D>__{bambi rats!}
<A>__{trevor aims his pistol at a deer jumping toward him. he shoots, misses. the deer knocks him down. the deer stomps his feet, rearing up and down on trevor's ribs, almost like a little dance. the deer tears at trevor's sleeve with decidedly carnivorous teeth, forcing him into letting go of his gun. kylie screams. she dives into a small space beneath a rock overhang on the side of the road. she watches what's going on from there. starla sees the buick a few yards away. she glances beside her to see the largest diseased deer of all, a horned buck, careening toward her. she dashes toward the buick as fast as she can. a tumorous doe leaps onto bill, biting into his shoulder and tearing at his flesh, so now he has two deer on him. bill is bleeding, dizzy, and disoriented, but he's able to turn, just a bit, to see the barrel of his shotgun above him. he tries to scoot himself back as he's being battered. he reaches up for the shotgun; but the tips of his fingers barely graze the muzzle. starla arrives at the buick, and starts to crawl into the front seat. but the horned buck is upon her. he bites into starla's ankle. she screams. he yanks back on her, half pulling her onto the road. but starla grabs onto the steering wheel with all her might, and pulls against the horned buck's massive power. the deer on trevor starts pulling him off, dragging him down the road as he hollers. kylie, underneath the rock overhang, watches bill try to scoot himself back and reach for the shotgun. it's just a little too far away. she works up her nerve and slowly starts to crawl out toward him. as starla is stretched between the horned buck pulling on her ankle, and her hand on the steering wheel, she's able to flip on her side and turn the keys in the ignition; the engine starts. she reaches one hand down to the floorboard, pressing on the gas. the buick lurches forward, wrenching her away from the horned buck's mouth. bill reaches again for the barrel of his rifle. it's too far away. but then he sees kylie, at the butt of the rifle. she reaches out and pushes it just a little, into bill's hand. bill grips the muzzle like a baseball bat, and swings it into the face of the deer jumping on him, knocking the beast back. the deer tries to stumble forward again, but its whole head and neck have been knocked askew. it topples over, dead. bill flips the shotgun forward into his hands. he stuffs the muzzle into the tumorous doe biting into his leg. the deer looks at him. blood is running down bill's face and he looks half crazed. bill glances down and sees the telephone wire wrapped around her ankle. bill pulls the trigger, destroying her. he stands, looking around for the deer with trevor. it has dragged him a fair distance down the street. bill shoots once, missing it, and again, hitting it straight on. kylie looks around to see more diseased deer running through the fields toward them. starla pulls herself into the driver's seat and backs up alongside her friends. throws open the passenger door.}
