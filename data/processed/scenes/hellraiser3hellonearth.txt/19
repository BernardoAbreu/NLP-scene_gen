<L>__{interior main room, joey's apt. night}
<A>__{close on the front door of the apartment as it opens to reveal terri leaning against the doorframe. clad identically to how we last saw her, terri clutches a well stuffed leather bag, containing all her worldly possessions.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{hi. how're you doing?}
<A>__{not waiting for either reply or invitation, she moves forward.}
<T>__{cut to wide:}
<A>__{ as terri walks past the dressing gowned joey and heads straight for joey's sofa and sprawls on it, laying her bag on the floor beside her.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{you got anything to drink?}
<A>__{joey closes the door, raised eyebrows registering her slight disapproval at terri's cavalier attitude. her voice, however, is polite.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{i put some decaf on. er ... make yourself comfortable.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{joey walks past terri and through to her kitchen, from where we hear the sound of coffee being poured. terri looks around at joey's room.}
<B>__{various angles on room}
<A>__{the large and spacious room suggests that even if joey is dissatisfied with her job she's at least being paid enough to make it bearable. the room is very ordered, very neat, but stops short of being prissy. a very large picture window takes up all of one wall. at the moment of course the drapes are closed. another wall is taken up by a huge shelf unit packed with books, videos, and cds. joey's obsession with "getting the whole story" seems to be true of her personal life as well as her professional.}
<B>__{angle on terri}
<A>__{ having finished her quick examination, she calls out.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{so ... what was your bad dream?}
<A>__{joey re enters, carrying two mugs of coffee.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{your dream. you said you were having a bad dream.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{oh yeah ...}
<A>__{she hands one coffee to terri and sits opposite her.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{... well, i've been having it for years. it's not a nightmare or anything. it's ... well, i know what it is.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{why are you so interested?}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{no. no, it's ok. i ... it's my father.}
<C>__{terri}
<P>__{(sympathetic, knowing)}
<D>__{oh, right. did he used to ... ?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{god, no! nothing like that. no, he died before i was born. he died in vietnam. i never knew him. never met him. we don't even know the details. i dream of battlefields. of searching. of trying to find out.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{that's great.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{no ... i mean, it's not like great about your dad or anything. it's just i don't dream. never have. ... maybe it'd help if i slept sometime ... just kidding ... no, so it's always neat for me to hear about dreams. i'm jealous. it's like everybody has another world except me. you know what i mean?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{i know what you're saying but ... never? you've never had a dream? no, you know, you do. you must. what you mean is you don't remember them.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{whatever. all i know is this is it for me. just me, my bag, and a series of shithead boyfriends. it'd be good to see something else. have a nighttime life. be somebody different.}
<A>__{terri pauses, then smiles like she's just realized something.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{hey ... this is great, isn't it? just girls talking. like having a conversation? good coffee. you got a cigarette?}
<A>__{joey waits, letting herself catch up with terri's good natured but marginally strung out personality. she looks around the room as if trying to remember where there are cigarettes.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{uh ... yeah. yeah, somewhere. wait a minute.}
<A>__{joey crosses to the big shelf unit and pulls out a concealed pack of cigarettes, a zippo lighter, and an ashtray from behind a shelf of videos. we notice that the videos are the world at war, volumes 1 thru 26. she brings the smokes to terri.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{great. thanks. you gonna have one?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{i'm trying to quit.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{oh, go on. have one. fuck it. you think you're going to live forever?}
<A>__{she smiles and proffers the pack to joey who shrugs, smiles, and takes one. terri picks up the zippo and sparks it. a huge flame leaps out of the lighter, producing an instant of terror from terri. joey pulls the lighter back from terri and closes the lid extinguishing the flame. terri draws a book of matches from her pocket shakily attempts to light her cigarette.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{sorry. it was my father's. it's temperamental.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{it's okay. it's just someone burned me once.}
<A>__{joey takes the book of matches from terri's hands and lights both cigarettes. terri takes a long, fearful look at the burning flame and then takes a deep, calming drag of her cigarette.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{wanna know how i look at it? way i see it is ... you give up, right? three days later, you get hit by a fucking truck and you know you just know that your last thought as you go under those wheels'd be "jesus h. christ, i coulda smoked another three packs!"}
<A>__{she lays the book of matches down. joey's eyes go to them.}
<B>__{angle on matches}
<A>__{black letters on the dark grey cover: under the underground.}
<B>__{angle on joey and terri}
<A>__{terri's eyes flick to the match book and her mood changes, becoming subdued and a little sullen.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{oh. you wanna talk about that stuff.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{yes i do. terri, something awful happened to that boy. i have to find out what it was.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{but i don't know anything! really. i just came out of the club and the kid was already in the street. he ...}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{did you know him?}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{no. i'd seen him in there a few times before. he was just a punk. i'd never like danced with him or anything. anyway, he was a thief. he must've taken it from the statue.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{taken what?}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{the thing! he was lying there in the street, moaning. but he pointed at it ...}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{wait a minute. he was already ... wounded ... when you found him?}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{yeah! that's what i'm saying! and it was lying next to him. and he pointed at it before he passed out and ...}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{wait. wait. the chains. where did the chains come from?}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{that's what i'm trying to tell you! ...}
<A>__{terri rummages in her bag, getting hold of something.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{he said they came out of this.}
<A>__{she holds her hand out and the camera tracks in to meet it. angle on terri's hand box resting on her palm is a black cube about 4 inches square. it has the same matt black carbonized look as the pillar and is recognizable as one of the "carvings" we saw on it. there is fine filigree pattern work over each of its surfaces and, to audiences familiar with the hellraiser movies, the box is recognizable despite its black coating; it is the lament configuration, the puzzle box that opens the doors to hell. there is a stubby shard of material protruding from one side of the box presumably where the boy from er had broken it off the pillar. camera favors this jagged shard as we cross fade to:}
