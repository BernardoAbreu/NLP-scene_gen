<A>__{big daddy steps out of the darkness, watching the lights of dead reckoning recede. he hears desperate squealing coming from under the toppled car. he lumbers down the embankment. pushes on one of the upturned tires. he can't turn the car by himself. he looks back to the road. grunts. number nine and others of big daddy's gathering force hurry to the car. they push. the car rolls over, freeing the three dead things. one of them used to be a butcher. still wearing a blood stained apron, carrying a meat cleaver, he looks at big daddy with something resembling gratitude.}
