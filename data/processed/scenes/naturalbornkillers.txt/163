<A>__{wurlitzer and the deputies are deciding their next move when they hear:}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{start.}
<A>__{wayne and duncan come into view with the knoxs behind them. the deputies quickly raise their guns, but soon realize if they take out either mickey of mallory that wayne or duncan would die. mallory's right hand is taped to the trigger and stock of the shotgun that's wrapped firmly to duncan's neck. the pistol in her left hand is trained on wurlitzer. mickey's left hand masters the shotgun leash on wayne, while he monitors the deputies with the camera on his right shoulder. note: the following scene will intercut between video footage and color 35mm. wayne starts belting out his speech as mickey focus the camera on wurlitzer. duncan simply cries and begs for his life to be spared.}
<C>__{wayne}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{my name is wayne gayle! i am the star of 'american maniacs', watched by forty million people every week! i am a respected journalist, winners of the golden globe, the edward r. murrows award among others! if anybody puts me in danger, my network will sue the los angeles county sheriffs department. my estate will sue every officer personally who fires. the network's law firm is rowlands, davis and sinclair...}
<A>__{mickey knew what he was doing. this has an effect on the deputies.}
<C>__{mallory}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{make a path!}
<A>__{the wall of deputies starts moving backward. the knoxs and their hostages start moving forward with wayne yelling all the way. the deputies keep their guns trained on the caravan, but they keep giving ground, until they reach the doors of the front lobby and they begin to part like the red sea. wurlitzer stands his ground.}
<C>__{wurlitzer}
<D>__{how far do you think your gonna get?}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{right out the front door.}
<C>__{wurlitzer}
<D>__{that'll never happen.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{it is happening.}
<A>__{the caravan marches forth. wayne and duncan keep shouting their speeches. nobody dares to move on them, but the deputies keep their weapons ready. wayne stops his speech to take a breath.}
<C>__{mallory}
<D>__{don't stop!}
<A>__{wayne starts up again. the deputies are completely frustrated. mickey and wurlitzer are nose to nose.}
<C>__{wurlitzer}
<P>__{(to mickey)}
<D>__{i will personally hunt you down, blow the head off your fucking whore wife, and plant your sick ass in the ground all by myself.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{another day perhaps, but not today.}
<A>__{mickey leaves frame.}
