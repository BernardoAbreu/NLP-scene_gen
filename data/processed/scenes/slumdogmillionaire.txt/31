<L>__{exterior dhobi. juhu slum. day.}
<A>__{right next to the railway lines is a pond of dirty water surrounded by shacks in which dozens of women are washing clothes. trains flash past only feet away from them. down the other end of the pond, nine year old jamal and salim are splashing noisily with some other children. jamal's mother pauses in her scrubbing, wipes sweat from her forehead and gazes up at the leaden sky.}
<C>__{jamal and salim's mother}
<D>__{it's going to come. today. i can feel it.}
<A>__{the woman next to her nods.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{hope so. my head is exploding.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{yes. we need rain.}
<A>__{jamal is trying to intercept the ball that salim and krishna are throwing to each other. he's not having much success. the ball flies overhead again from salim to krishna. jamal dives for it, misses and goes underwater. when he comes up for air, he shakes his head, clearing his ears of water. then he stops, listens. shakes his head again. definitely something strange. thunder? salim and krishna are trading catches, unaware that anything has changed. but jamal's mother has heard it too. the faintest sound of shouting, roaring. the wave of noise is still faint but getting louder. a frozen moment broken by:}
<C>__{mother }
<D>__{run! jamal, salim, run!}
<A>__{everybody stares at her. a train speeds through as she continues to shout, her words lost beneath the thundering train.}
<C>__{mother }
<D>__{go! run!}
<A>__{the train goes through, the last carriage flying past suddenly opening up the sight of a wall of rioting men wielding clubs, scythes, metal bars. they come screaming across the railway tracks.}
<C>__{salim}
<D>__{krishna, quick!}
<A>__{salim holds out his hand to krishna who is wading with difficulty through the water.}
<C>__{krishna}
<D>__{no way! you're a bloody muslim. get away from me!}
<A>__{the rioters leap the tracks and are upon them.}
<C>__{krishna }
<D>__{they're muslims! him and him!}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{go!}
<A>__{salim and jamal scramble out and retreat into the lanes. salim turns to see his mother felled by a rioter. she is surrounded by screaming, chanting men who rain blows down on her. jamal runs back and drags salim down an alley. as they head down the alley, they get glimpses of burning houses, fleeing women, a three year old boy in a doorway, painted entirely in garish blue. he stares at them. in his hand, he is carrying a bow and arrow. an eleven year old girl dressed only in a pair of pants runs after them. she has two bleeding red gashes on her back. they turn a corner and head towards some vans full of police. jamal sees mister nandha, the school teacher, stops.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{salim!}
<A>__{then mister nandha starts walking towards him. an oasis of calm in the chaos. jamal looks at him with relief.}
<C>__{jamal }
<D>__{mister nandha.}
<A>__{mister nandha smiles, walks towards them.}
<C>__{mister nandha}
<D>__{ram nam satya hai, babri masjid dhvasth hai.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{mister nandha?}
<C>__{mister nandha}
<D>__{we have destroyed your mosque. now, the followers of ram will drive you dogs out of our city.}
<A>__{from behind his back he produces a knife and runs towards jamal, screaming.}
<C>__{mister nandha }
<D>__{ram has returned to his temple! ram has returned!}
<A>__{they flee, but jamal turns, sees the girl, frozen. he chases back a few steps, hauls her arm. the spell broken, and they are off.}
