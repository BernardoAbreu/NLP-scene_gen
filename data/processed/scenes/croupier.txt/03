<L>__{interior publisher's office day}
<A>__{jack is walking through a maze of open plan partitioned offices. he ls casually but fashionably dressed, hair dyed blond long, a nervous elegance about him, almost unrecognisable from the croupier's face. he searches for the right office. he finds it. the name on the open is giles cremorne.}
<L>__{interior giles' office day}
<A>__{giles cremorne, a public schoolboy in his late twenties comes forward and vigorously shakes jack's hand. jacketless, he wears yellow braces. next to his tidy desk is a slot machine.}
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{take a pew, jack. you look well. what's it been, two years since we broke bread?}
<A>__{giles has an upper class accent, but an acquired street manner.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{three years, two months. march '93.}
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{what a memory you've got. maths always was your strong suit. what happened to the moaning lisa?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{she went back to south africa.}
<C>__{giles}
<P>__{(digging)}
<D>__{did she?}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{you were pretty thick at one time.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{we all played the field.}
<A>__{giles frowns at a memory, an implication. giles's mobile phone buzzes. he picks up.}
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{hi ya... i will call you back.}
<P>__{(to jack)}
<D>__{now then...}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{i want a job, giles.}
<C>__{giles}
<P>__{(cautiously)}
<D>__{all right. as what?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i was thinking perhaps i could be a reader. you employ readers, don't you?}
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{we do. for unsolicited manuscripts. we pay twenty pounds a manuscript. you might get two, maybe three in a week. can you live on sixty pounds?}
<A>__{jack opens a pack of gitanes.}
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{sorry. this is a no smoking office, jack. you've written a book, haven't you? i didn't read it myself, but }
<A>__{a woman secretary puts her head into the office.}
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{give me ten minutes, fiona.}
<A>__{fiona puts a fax on giles's desk, smiles at jack, and goes.}
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{fiona used to read for me.}
<A>__{he winks at jack.}
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{let me tell you about our operation. we like personality authors. people the public recognises. celebrity's what sells books. we can always find someone to do the writing. first, we need the face. then the concept.}
<P>__{(he is reading the fax)}
<D>__{right now i'm looking for a soccer novel. something where a tycoon buys a lousy team and takes it to the top. seven figure transfer fees. corruption all down the line. violence on and off the pitch. steroids. got any concepts? it could be a thug story. i tell you what. why don't you think about it. a couple of pages. the pitch. steroids. got any concepts? it could be a thug story. i tell you what. why don't you think about it. a couple of pages.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{with plenty of sex, of course.}
<A>__{giles pops a coin into the slot machine, pulls the handle, waits.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{interesting, giles. i will think about it.}
<A>__{the machine spits out several coins. giles takes them.}
<C>__{giles}
<D>__{let me give you three words of advice, jack. don't give up. stick with it. who persists wins. that's my motto. write, write, write.}
<A>__{jack nods, extends his hand. a firm handshake.}
<C>__{jack's voice}
<D>__{jack had three words for, giles. go fuck yourself.}
<A>__{meeting over. giles smiles goodbye, pockets his slot machine winnings.}
