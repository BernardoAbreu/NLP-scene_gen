<L>__{exterior whalebone graveyard}
<A>__{lex shelters behind the giant skeleton of a whale. around her a striking landscape of bleached whalebones loom from the thick mist. she can hear but not see the alien queen. somewhere out there she is moving through the mist, on the hunt for lex. the sound of her giant footsteps echo all around. it's creepy as hell. lex's eyes strain in the gloom, but the queen cannot be seen. her footsteps however are getting closer. without warning, the queen lunges from the mist. looming right above lex!!! lex runs, but the queen is right behind her! lex sprints the length of a whale's skeleton, the bones curving around her like a giant cage. the queen is seconds behind her, crashing through the giant bones, sending them flying like toothpicks. the queen is right on top of lex, her jaws snapping, when lex takes a sudden turn to the left. the queen is just too big and going too fast to be as agile as lex. the queen attempts to turn, her teeth missing lex by inches, but in an instant she overbalances and crashes across the ice in a spectacular explosion of snow and whalebones. within an instant however, she is back on her feet and hungry for blood.}
