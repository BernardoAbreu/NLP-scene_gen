<L>__{exterior roadside tavern day}
<A>__{bleak rain dribbles down willow's miserable face. pro tecting the baby, he hurries toward a tavern. the bot tom of the building is an open stable with several horses. two burly iron workers clank a red hot wagon rim, fixing a nearby wagon hitched to a horse. it's a rough place. rool and teemo peek out of willow's pockets. upstairs people drink and shout.}
<C>__{teemo}
<D>__{i'm not going in there.}
<C>__{rool}
<D>__{me neither!}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{don't worry i'm a sorcerer. what could possibly happen?}
<A>__{suddenly there's a crash up above and two picts burst through a balcony and land in the mud, fighting vi ciously. rool and teemo duck inside willow's pockets. willow steps around the picts, dashes through the stable and up the stairs.}
