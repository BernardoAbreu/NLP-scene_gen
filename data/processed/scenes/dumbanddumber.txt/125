<A>__{the athletic beauty is back in her jeep now and harry has sidled up to the driver's side. he leans against her side view mirror.}

<D>__{that's a lot of luggage for a little vacation.}
<C>__{athletic beauty}
<D>__{actually, i'm moving to aspen. i've got to get away from my boyfriend.}
<A>__{he's such a klutz. my astrologer told me i should avoid accident prone guys. just then, the side view mirror harry has been leaning on}
<B>__{snaps off the car. he cracks}
<A>__{his head against the windshield, falls to the ground, then}
<B>__{quickly leaps to his feet as if nothing happened.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(holding out mirror)}
<D>__{here, this is a little loose.}
<A>__{she throws the mirror into the back seat and takes out a cigarette.}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{allow me...}
<A>__{he pulls out a match and lights it with a debonair flourish. the athletic beauty nods her thanks. harry tosses the match to the ground, and we hear an o.s. whoosh! wisps of smokes rise around him and we hear the low crackle of something burning. (neither of them notice this.)}
<C>__{harry }
<D>__{look, um, maybe when i get to aspen we can meet up... you know, for hot chocolate or something.}
<A>__{she looks him over and smiles.}
<C>__{athletic beauty}
<D>__{why not? you seem pretty harmless. i will give you my number. just let me find a pen.}
<A>__{as she starts to rummage through her purse, harry smells the smoke. he looks down and sees that his right shoe is ablaze! he shakes it, then tries to put it out with the other shoe, but to no avail. meanwhile, the athletic beauty is still searching for a pen.}
<C>__{athletic beauty }
<D>__{i know i have one here somewhere...}
<A>__{harry starts doing a soft shoe dance to extinguish the flames. this only helps to fan them.}

<C>__{athletic beauty}

<A>__{he begins hopping around violently.}
<C>__{athletic beauty}
<D>__{is something wrong?}
<A>__{harry shakes his head no as he bites his lip to keep from screaming.}
<C>__{athletic beauty }
<D>__{okay, my number is 652 2553.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{oh, wait a second, that's my old number. it's so funny how your mind god sakes, give me the damn number!}
<A>__{she's taken aback by this outburst.}
<C>__{athletic beauty }
<D>__{look, man, if you're gonna get pushy you can just forget it!}
<A>__{she throws the car into drive and peels away.}
