<C>__{tom}
<D>__{"...aint no woman got what you got, sista girl. happy birthday to the lean, sheen, and sizzly mocha queen!"}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{how's that?}
<A>__{the african american mahogany writers are impressed.}
<D>__{mahogany writer #1 something's gotten into you son!}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{yeah. it's pretty cool.}
<A>__{(222)}
<L>__{ext movie theatre night}
<A>__{tom and summer in line to buy tickets.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you really want to see this?}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{it sounds amazing.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{it's, like, all stabbing and shit.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{exactly.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{ok.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{all you take me to are sappy little romances. i want to see some open wounds, damn it. i want carnage.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{fantastic.}
<A>__{suddenly, tom sees something at the front of the line.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{oh shit.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{and here they come, tom's mom and step dad, sarah and martin. tom's face registers a noticeable panic.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{sarah and martin are delighted at this coincidence. sarah hugs and kisses her son.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(looking at summer)}
<D>__{hi mom.}
<A>__{summer smiles. maybe this will be ok.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{mom, martin, this is summer.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{summer! well hello! we've heard so much about you! it's so good to finally meet you.}
<A>__{sarah hugs summer.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{you too.}
<A>__{and now martin weighs in with his own hug. tom notices summer's face growing increasingly concerned. why is he hugging me?}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(to tom)}
<D>__{is this the girlfriend?}
<A>__{tom is caught like a deer in headlights. what can he do?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{well this is the girl friend i've told you about. i don't know if "girlfriend" is the right word...}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{you going to see the serial killer one?}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{yes we are.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{great! should we save you seats?}
<A>__{again, this has become incredibly awkward for tom and for summer.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{ok. we'll see you inside.}
<A>__{when they're out of earshot, tom sees that summer is distraught.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{sorry about that.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{it's fine.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you wanna go do something else? we can totally bolt.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{did you tell them i was your girlfriend?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{what?! no way... i never used that word.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{they seemed to think... i mean, why is your step dad giving me a hug?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{he's very...loving.}
<C>__{summer}
<D>__{does he hug all your friends?}
<A>__{there's that word again. summer looks at tom, like she's disappointed or even angry at him for something. then she walks ahead of him into the theatre. he's forced to follow. answer less, as conflicted as ever. why is none of this easy?}
