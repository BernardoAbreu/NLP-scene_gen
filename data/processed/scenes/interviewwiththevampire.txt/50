<L>__{interior house night}
<A>__{a little girl, pulling at a figure in a rocking chair.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{mama, please wake up. mama, i'm frightened, please wake up.}
<A>__{as louis enters, he sees the woman is dead. her eyes are being eaten away by rats. louis gasps in horror. claudia turns. she is a radiant doll or angel as she stretches out her hand to louis.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{monsieur, please help us. papa's waiting for us at the ship. please wake mama, monsieur.}
<A>__{she runs to him. instinctively, he gathers her in his arms. he looks down pitying on her beautiful face.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{and if i am damned, why do i fell such pity for her gaunt face? why do i wish to warm her tiny arms? comfort her beating heart?}
<A>__{she snuggles into him, suddenly utterly secure. she tugs at his hair, brings his head down towards her. and we see louis shiver, as his lips go to her neck. her breathing becomes calm as she goes into the swoon. gradually another sound replaces it. lestat's laughter, growing louder and louder. suddenly louis backs away, caught red handed, the child in his arms. he sees lestat slapping his knee and laughing in the doorway.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{ah, my philosopher, my martyr. "never take a human life". well you must admit it is funny. or is it merely touching? i'm not sure.}
<A>__{louis stares at the unconscious claudia in horror, then lets her slip gently into a chair. shamefully he wipes his mouth, sees the tiny wounds on her throat. lestat snatches up the dead mother from the chair and begins to dance with her in great circles, humming and talking. her head falls back. black water flows from her mouth.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{let's make some party of it, shall we? maybe there's some life in the old lady yet?}
<A>__{louis flees into the street.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{come back, louis, you are what you are. the plague would have got her within hours anyway. merciful death how you love your precious guilt.}
