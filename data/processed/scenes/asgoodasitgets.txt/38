<A>__{melvin's pov verdell's towel on the floor near his bowl.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{melvin's lips compress... he sits on the piano bench and hits a few keys... looks at verdell's empty spot again... there are those who "get the joke" melvin is clearly one he laughs suddenly and helplessly even as he feels the panic rise in him... ... all his painstaking success in keeping the lid on and now it threatens to blow for a reason he articulates.}
<C>__{melvin}
<D>__{over the dog... an ugly dog.}
<A>__{it's hilarious. but now the humor detours. an actual sob is choked back... he gets up following a definite pattern across the room. he is conducting a small but highest stakes fight for survival. momentarily a scared, beaten middle aged man he races out the door.}
