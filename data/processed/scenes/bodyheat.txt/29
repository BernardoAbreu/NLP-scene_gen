<L>__{exterior front terrace night}
<A>__{racine's pov. matty is standing at the bottom of the stairs in the hall. she is looking directly at the front door. frozen in the spot. racine tries the door. it's locked. he shakes it hard, but it's solid. he looks to his left. there are windows down the wall there. he moves to them. they go into the living room but their shutters are closed. he looks through a broken slat at matty, who watches him from the same spot, through the living room door. racine tries them. they won't budge. racine moves to his right past the front door, to the windows off the dining room. he pushes at them as his eyes lock with matty, who watches from the hall. the windows won't move, racine spins and picks up the nearest object, a wooden rocking chair. he lifts it, turns and smashes the big window. glass showers into the dining room. matty watches. she hasn't moved.}
