<L>__{interior enid & rebecca's apartment around midnight}
<A>__{the apartment is dark lit only by a harsh, annoying streetlight. rebecca sits on the couch in sweat clothes, exasperated. she goes to look out the window. cars with loud radios can be heard driving by. she goes to the phone she checks it and hangs up. pause. she picks it up again one last try. she dials the number and waits. we hear the beep of the answering machine. rebecca hangs up. she gets into a sleeping bag (spread out in the center of a cold linoleum floor). she zips the zipper all the way over her head and curls up into a whimpering ball.}
