<L>__{interior hallway}
<A>__{nico and lukich pad in. quickly lukich checks the stairs leading down. nico crosses silently past the first apartment door, checks the far end of the hallway. nico comes back toward the apartment door. lukich approaches from the opposite side. they take up positions flanking the door, guns drawn. the loud music continues from inside.}
<B>__{inside apartment}
<A>__{salvano and chi chi look on, revulsed. whatever is happening to father tomassino is enough to make even cruel men ill.}
<C>__{zagon }
<D>__{ tell me the truth, father }
<A>__{the priest's eyes roll grotesquely; he convulses, sweat beading on his forehead. he looks like a man in the agonies of some narcotic hell.}
<C>__{zagon}
<P>__{(close to priest)}
<D>__{ can we kill him? if you told anyone, about our plans to kill the senator, we cannot do it.}
<C>__{father tomassino}
<D>__{nadie. nadie. nadie.}
<B>__{nico and lukich in hallway}
<A>__{o.s. we hear another elevated train approaching outside. nico kicks the apartment door in! he and lukich burst in, guns clutched two handed.}
<B>__{quick cuts}
<A>__{the first goon reacts, raises his pistol. lukich shoots him. nico nails the second goon, just as chi chi aims his sawed off pistol grip shotgun at nico. nico has a split second to dive behind a heavy upholstered chair. chi chi's double barrel blast blows the chair into powder. almost instan taneously nico sees the priest just as zagon slashes the priest's throat! salvano shoots lukich point blank, in the shoulder, sending lukich's gun sailing. nico, firing, grabs lukich, dives out the door with him }
<B>__{hallway}
<A>__{zagon and salvano open fire from the apartment full tilt. bullets rip through the wall, blasting wood and plaster everywhere. nico shoves lukich toward the stairwell }
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{go! go!}
<A>__{ simultaneously firing back through the kicked in door, emptying his gun.}
<C>__{zagon}
<P>__{(in spanish, from apartment)}
<D>__{get him! finish him!}
<A>__{nico is slamming a fresh clip in, lukich is stumbling away toward the stairwell. salvano and chi chi appear in the apartment doorway. chi chi levels his fierce "hogleg" at nico's head. at that instant a broadside of bullets slam into the wall around chi chi. it's jackson on the stairs! chi chi is hit, but spins, fires. his shotgun blast catches jackson square in the chest, blowing her back like a doll, down the stairwell, out of sight. nico reacts with agony, twists on the floor, shoots chi chi in the face. nico pulls the trigger as fast as he can, sending a hail of fire through the doorway, through the walls. salvano clutches his hench man, using his dead body as a shield; nico's bullets blow chi chi apart. zagon fires back, hits nico in the side by the ribs! nico tries to fire back; he's empty!}
<C>__{zagon}
<D>__{now!}
<A>__{nico bolts for the stairwell to the roof, clawing for a new clip as he goes. salvano and zagon burst into the hallway, shooting at nico.}
