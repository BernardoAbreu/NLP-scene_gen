<A>__{jacob and jezzie are lying in bed. they are a sensual couple and even in quiet, reflective moments such as this, their positioning is erotic and stimulating. both of them are nude. jacob's hands are clasped behind his neck and he is staring mournfully at the ceiling. jezzie is lying on her side, her left leg draped across jacob's pelvis. her head is propped up on her right arm while her left hand strokes the bayonet scar on jacob's stomach. neither are talking. suddenly, out of the blue, jezzie speaks.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{maybe it's all the pressure, jake. the money. things like that. or your wife.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{why do you bring her up?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{'cause she's always on your mind.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{when was the last time i said a word?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{it has nothin' to do with talkin'.}
<A>__{she pauses for a while, long enough to suppose that the conversation is over. then she continues.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{or maybe it's the war.}
<A>__{jacob closes his eyes.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{it's still there, jake.}
<P>__{(she points to his brain)}
<D>__{even if you never say a word about it. you can't spend two years in vietnam ...}
<C>__{jacob}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{what does that have to do with anything? does it explain the barricaded subway stations? does it explain those godforsaken creatures?}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{new york is filled with creatures. everywhere. and lots of stations are closed.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{they're like demons, jez.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{demons, jake? come on. they're winos and bag ladies. low life. that's all they are. the streets are crawling with 'em. don't make em into somethin' they're not.}
<P>__{(she rubs his forehead)}
<D>__{it's the pressure, honey. that's all it is.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{those guys tried to kill me tonight. they were aiming right at me.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{kids on a joy ride. happens all the time.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{they weren't human!}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{come on. what were they, jake?}
<A>__{jacob doesn't answer. he turns over on his stomach. jezzie stares at his naked back and drags her fingernails down to his buttocks. scratch marks follow in their wake.}
<C>__{jezzie}
<D>__{you still love me?}
<A>__{he does not respond.}
