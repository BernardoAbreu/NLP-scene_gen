<L>__{interior garage apartment.}
<A>__{close up of bonnie seated in the living room.}

<P>__{(reading from a pad; in a recital voice)}
<D>__{it's called "the ballad of suicide sal."}
<P>__{(she pauses for effect; then begins:)}
<D>__{"we each of us have a good alibi for being down here in the 'joint'; but few of them really are justified if you get right down to the pointerior you've heard of a woman's glory being spent on a downright cur'."}
<C>__{buck's voice }
<D>__{you write that all by yourself?}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{you want to hear this or not?}
<A>__{as she reads, the camera pans around the room picking out everyone's reaction. clyde is looking and listening seriously. buck is grinning. c.w. is blank. blanche is in the kitchen cooking.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{"still you can't always judge the story as true, being told by her. now 'sal' was a gal of rare beauty, though her features were coarse and tough "}
<C>__{buck}
<D>__{yeah, i knew her. she was cockeyed and had a hare lip and no teeth!}
<A>__{bonnie flashes him a look that could kill. he shuts up fast. she continues:}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{"now 'sal' was a gal of rare beauty, though her features were coarse and tough; she never once faltered from duty to play on the 'up and up'."}
<A>__{still listening, clyde gets up from his chair and walks slowly past the living room windows. the camera angled slightly above him, sees down the street. we see two police cars quietly pulling up. one of them parks sideways in the driveway to block escape from the garage, the other stays on the street. clyde turns and looks out the window.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(o.s. as we see out the window)}
<D>__{"sal told me this tale on the evening before she was turned out free, and i will do my best to relate it just as she told it to me "}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(seeing it)}
<D>__{it's the law.}
<A>__{as soon as clyde calls out, blanche drops the frying pan on the floor and begins screaming. camera cuts back to the living room. everyone else leaps into action. guns begin blazing from everywhere; we rarely see who is shooting at whom.}
