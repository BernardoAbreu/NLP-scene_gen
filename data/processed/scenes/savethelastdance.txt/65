<L>__{exterior street (o'donnell heights) night}
<A>__{sara, patrick and chenille. walking home. chenille's preaching to patrick. he's not in the mood.}
<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{... yeah, i'ma tell you. tell you like i keep tellin' you, patrick. you need to let malakai alone. let him handle his own shit before he drags you down in it.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{chenille. i heard you the first five hundred times.}
<A>__{they round a corner bordering the heights. stop in front of it. chenille, disconcerted with patrick, looks dourly at sara.}
<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{i will see you monday.}
<P>__{(to patrick, like an order)}
<D>__{he'll walk you.}
<A>__{as much as this makes sense, it still takes patrick by surprise. sara sees it in his face, regards chenille with a false bravado.}
<C>__{sara}
<D>__{it's just a few blocks. it's okay.}
<C>__{chenille}
<D>__{no, it's not okay. would you tell the girl it ain't okay?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{it's not okay, okay?}
<P>__{(before she can protest)}
<D>__{come on, braveheart.}
