<A>__{the umbrella man and the cuban sitting quietly together on the north side of the curb of elm street.}

<A>__{stunned, confused, people in the crowd some lying on the ground, some running for the grassy knoll. back in the courtroom, patrolman joe smith is on the stand.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{patrolman joe smith rushed into the parking lot behind the fence. he smelled gunpowder.}
<A>__{flashback to: the picket fence area where, with his gun drawn, smith rushes across to a man standing by a car who reacts quickly, producing credentials. he is one of the hoboes. there's a strange moment when the camera moves from smith's eyes to the man's fingernails.}
<C>__{smith }
<D>__{...the character produces credentials from his pocket which showed him to be secret service. so i accepted that and let him go and continued our search. but i regretted it, 'cause this guy looked like an auto mechanic. he had on a sports shirt and pants, but he had dirty fingernails. afterwards it didn't ring true, but at the time we were so pressed for time.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{yet all secret servicemen in dallas that day are accounted for. none were on foot in dealey plaza before or after the shooting, till dallas secret service chief forrest sorrels returned at 12:55.}
<A>__{back in the courtroom, liz is totally absorbed. jim exchanges looks with her. the camera movies in for a close up of jim.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(pausing for effect)}
<D>__{what else was going on in dealey plaza that day? at least 12 other individuals were taken into custody by dallas police. no records of their arrests. men acting like hoboes were being pulled off trains, marched through dealey plaza, photographed, and yet there is no records of their arrests.}
<A>__{flashback to: the three hoboes being arrested ... marching across dealey plaza. the hoboes look familiar now.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{men identifying themselves as secret service agents were all over the place. but who was impersonating them?}
<A>__{flashback to: men in suits, ties, and hats moving people out of the parking lot area ... turning a policeman back. flashback to: the cuban, putting away a radio, and the umbrella man, who now rise and leave the area in opposite directions.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{and where was lee oswald? probably in the second floor snack room. eddie piper and william shelly saw oswald eating lunch in the first floor lunch room around twelve. around 12:15, on her way out of the building to see the motorcade, secretary carolyn arnold saw oswald in the second floor snack room, where he said he went for a coke...}
<A>__{in the second floor lunchroom of the book depository we see carolyn arnold, a pregnant secretary, crossing past oswald, who is in a booth.}
<C>__{carolyn arnold }
<D>__{he was sitting in one of the booths on the right hand side of the room. he was alone as usual and appeared to be having lunch. i did not speak to him but i recognized clearly. i remember it was 12:15 or later. it coulda been 12:25, five minutes before the assassination, i don't exactly remember. i was pregnant and i had a craving for a glass of water.}
<A>__{on the sixth floor of the depository, bonnie ray williams is eating a chicken lunch, alone.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(vo)}
<D>__{at the same time, bonnie ray williams is supposedly eating his chicken lunch on the sixth floor, at least until 12:15, maybe 12:20 ... he sees nobody.}
<A>__{on the street, arnold rowland and his wife look up at the sixth floor windows and we see, from their point of view, two shadowy figures...}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{down on the street, arnold rowland was seeing two men in the sixth floor windows... presumably after bonnie ray williams finished his lunch and left.}
<A>__{we see footage of j.f.k. coming up houston waving. oswald walks into the second floor lunchroom as policeman marrion baker runs in, gun at his side. he is about 30 feet from oswald. roy truly, the superintendent, runs in a moment later.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{kennedy was running five minutes late for his appointment with death. he was due at 12:25. if oswald was the assassin, he was certainly pretty non chalant about getting himself into position. later he told dallas police he was standing in the second floor snackroom. probably told to wait there for a phone call by his handler. the phones were in the adjacent and empty second floor offices, but the call never came. a maximum 90 seconds after kennedy is shot, patrolman marrion baker runs into oswald in that second story lunchroom.}
<C>__{baker}
<D>__{hey you!}
<P>__{(to truly)}
<D>__{do you know this man? is he an employee?}
<C>__{truly}
<D>__{yes he is.}
<P>__{(as baker moves on)}
<D>__{the president's been shot!}
<A>__{oswald reacts as if hearing it for the first time. truly and baker continue running up the stairs. oswald proceeds to get a coke and continues out of the room.}
