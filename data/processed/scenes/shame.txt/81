<D>__{you wanna drink?}
<A>__{he pours a drink from the mini bar.}
<C>__{brandon }
<D>__{what are you looking at?}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{the view is amazing.}
<A>__{brandon approaches nervously, standing next to her.}

<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{marianne leans up and kisses brandon.}
<C>__{marianne}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<A>__{marianne takes brandon's hand and leads him to the bed. we see both of them slowly discovering each other through tender touches. marianne caresses brandon's face and kisses both his eyes. brandon attempts to do the same to marianne, slowly but surely. this ritual becomes more aroused, clothes start to fall away, revealing for the first time both each other's flesh. brandon rolls up her skirt, laughs at her panites. marianne giggles.}
<C>__{brandon}
<P>__{(laughs) are they vintage?}
<C>__{marianne}
<P>__{a little bit. (laughs)}
<A>__{the ritual begins to get more passionate, as they feel for each other's breasts and thighs. at the height of this passionate encounter, brandon's attention strangely, slowly starts to fade. it's as if the intimacy that he has discovered starts to frighten him. he recoils, unable to continue. both lie on their backs silently, in frustration, breathing heavily. marianne's face is one of puzzlement and hurt. she looks at brandon for some kind of answer. he gets up. marianne, unsure what to do, sits up and pulls down her skirt, adjusts her hair.}
