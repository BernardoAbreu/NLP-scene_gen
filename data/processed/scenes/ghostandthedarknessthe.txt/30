<A>__{the river in the distance as they walk toward it. and here is as good a place as any to explain just what the spot where the movie takes place was like. there were five hundred men working for patterson. and they lived in a spread out area. a bunch of indian coolies who might have come from the same town back in their country might choose to live in one cluster of tents. a group of natives might be in another cluster. what we have then, as far as living places are concerned, are dozens of clusters of tents. (eventually, as the terror began, these areas all got surrounded, each with its own thorn fence.) the places we'll come to know best are, among others, patterson's living area, the hospital tent area, the area by the river where the bridge is to be built, etc., etc. as they move, samuel points out various camps. a sect of indians is getting ready for prayer. another sect of indians is eating. a group of africans are cleaning their tent area. anyway, you get the idea. just remember that the place covered a wide expanse, maybe a mile square, maybe more. okay, back to the story.}
