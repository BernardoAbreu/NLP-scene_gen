<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i will get you through. move and smile.}

<C>__{martin klein}
<D>__{the italians serve the second best things right after the chinese...i could do an article comparing embassy food...gourmet free loading...sell it anyplace. i'm sure not getting the assignments.}

<A>__{and now he sees that it's tom.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{is god testing me or something?}
<C>__{martin klein}
<D>__{paul loves him. i heard him give him the most poetic compliment in his command. 'he's hot.' sometimes groups of executives get together just to say that work back and forth...'he's hot, oh, she's hot. oh, he's really hot.' hot hot hot hot hot hot hot...}
<P>__{(looking at aaron)}
<D>__{and here we are.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{martin, you're not allowed to use the word 'we' or i'm moving.}
<C>__{martin klein}
<P>__{(sudden thought)}
<D>__{maybe jane would like my food idea as a spot...try the one in the middle.}
<A>__{he moves off to intercept jane as he stops her... tom is stranded then sees aaron and moves over to his side.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{hi, aaron...what's doing?}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{same old stuff. i'm watching a man who won three overseas press awards pitch an hors d'oeuvre idea.}
<A>__{a man stops and introduces himself to tom shaking his hand:}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you want to go out there }
<P>__{(indicating balcony)}
<D>__{get out of this for a second?}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{why don't you lead? i will just follow the flurry you cause.}
<A>__{tom turns the sharpness of the tone unsettles him.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{what did i do to you?}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{you've made my dreams silly.}
<A>__{tom decides not to deal with the remark. he's jolted by the hostility. he leads the way out french doors to a ground floor terrace, where aaron joins him, closes the door and the two men stare at the party.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(gesturing at the party)}
<D>__{heavy hitters.}
<A>__{aaron nods. they look inside.}
<C>__{aaron}
<P>__{(several beats; then)}
<D>__{how you doing?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(warming)}
<D>__{great. network news, washington... i love it. what do you do when your real life exceeds your dreams?}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{keep it to yourself.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you know the other day i really wanted your reaction to how we did with the libyan report i was going to ask but i guess i feel a little intimidated with you.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{oh, stop it.}
<A>__{on tom's reaction.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{you can't talk about feeling intimidated when you're on top of the world. it's unseemly.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i'm not buying into any of that. i have a load to learn. i'm not going to act as if...}
<C>__{aaron}
<P>__{(finishing for him)}
<D>__{you have the job you have...}
<A>__{the sudden debate is important to tom but it's moving too fast for him.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{shut up a second...}
<C>__{aaron}
<P>__{(amiably)}
<D>__{okay. pretty petty party, isn't it, pal?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(picking his words)}
<D>__{i made one rule for myself when this started and i realized i was going to take a lot from you people because of being from sports...}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{and the rule was...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{never to pretend to know more than i did.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{can you name all the members of the cabinet?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(flustered)}
<D>__{okay, let's drop it. i didn't mean i'd take a test for you i mean if that came up in conversation i'd...}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{we're conversing...oh my, the names of the entire cabinet has slipped my mind. what are they?}
<A>__{tom is getting pissed.}
<C>__{aaron}
<P>__{(compromising)}
<D>__{don't name them. just tell me if you know.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{yes, aaron. i know the names of the cabinet.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{aaron }
<D>__{all twelve?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{there are only ten.}
<A>__{aaron's suddenly a good deal happier damned if it isn't a little infectious.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you're feeling good, aren't you?}
<C>__{aaron}
<P>__{(sincerely)}
<D>__{i'm starting to... we may do the capitols of the states.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(dry)}
<D>__{fifty, right?}
<A>__{aaron almost smiles. tom enters the party leaving the door open.}
<B>__{long shot}
<A>__{aaron in the f.g. his back to camera... beyond him tom being approached... then joining jane.}
