<A>__{a snarling werewolf rushing at us. chase jumps back, frightened out of his wits and we realize... the werewolf is part of a group of costumed kids out trick or treating. the kids laugh at chase's reaction and hurry on, dragging their candy loot bags behind them. chase sighs and turns to lock the office door. he's closing up for the night. he climbs into his mobile vet van. we hold on the new sign in the back window: "a halloween treat. free kittens." beneath that is a pencil sketch of a black arched back kitten.}
