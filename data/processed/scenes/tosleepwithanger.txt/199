<L>__{interior kitchen night}
<A>__{harry's body lies there motionless.}
<L>__{interior front room day}
<A>__{the preacher is snoring violently. babe brother is asleep on the floor. sunny is asleep sitting on linda's lap. linda's feet rest on babe brother's chest. junior and pat are looking at the baby pictures. pat is holding her hand across her stomach feeling the baby kick. rhonda is asleep in a chair. suzie and gideon are sitting at the dining room table. suzie is cutting the dead leaves off of a small potted plant.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{it feels like a storm has passed... hattie read some of harry's letters to a woman he had a child by. the child had died and he was writing to give her some comfort. hattie didn't know that deep down at the bottom of harry's hate, there was some love.}
<A>__{the sound of rodney's trumpet is heard but is no longer irritating.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{did i ever tell you the story about the man who wanted to make his own mind up about heaven and hell? he didn't want nobody's opinion but his own.}
<A>__{suzie doesn't pay any attention; she is involved with her potted plant. gideon looks over at the preacher, who is still asleep.}
<C>__{gideon }
<D>__{he's going to check out heaven first. he gets a round trip ticket to heaven. he gets in heaven and finds it just like back home. people dripping with sweat, working in the fields, hardly surviving. he asked a man who was getting a drink of water, "i thought the streets were paved with gold." "they are but you won't see them," he said. "boy, you got to work day and night cause idleness is sinfulness." so he takes the other half of his ticket and takes the express to hell. he sees people stretched out on their backs kicking back, picking their teeth. "man, this is a dream." he asked, "what's you'll doing?" they all hollered back, "sinning." the devil was shaking hands with everyone and came up to him and said, "please to meet you." he asked, "i thought you'll was supposed to be burning in fire." someone said, "man, ain't no fire down here except under that pot of chitlins." the man was going go ask the preacher back on earth...}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{i don't want to hear any joke about colored people being in hell. you're being irreverent.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{i'm almost finished. i'm about to come to the punch line.}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{i don't want to hear any tales about colored people...}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{but these are white people, anybody. the punch...}
<C>__{suzie}
<D>__{i don't care to hear any jokes about people being in hell. this cut on my hand reminds me that it is nothing to laugh at.}
<C>__{gideon}
<D>__{it's only a tale.}
<A>__{the rattling of pots and dishes starts suddenly. harry's body starts to sway gently as if he were about to get up. everyone is frozen. babe brother and linda remain asleep. the rocking caused by the earthquake doesn't wake them. m.c., herman, okra and hattie and marsh enters the dining room. harry's feet are seen in the kitchen still swaying.}
<C>__{m.c}
<D>__{is that an earthquake?}
<C>__{herman}

<C>__{herman}
<D>__{hattie, your true colors are unbearable. you got some mean ways. don't worry about the boy getting a burial. he still has some friends left on this earth.}
<C>__{hattie}
<D>__{his winter has come and gone and i know right now he is answering for a lot of things.}
<A>__{m.c., okra and herman move away from hattie.}
