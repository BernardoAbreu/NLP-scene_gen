<T>__{smash cut to:}
<L>__{interior stranded oldsmobile night}
<A>__{suddenly, jarringly, the kids are seated back inside the car. as if someone hit reset.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{what just... out there...?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(unsure)}
<D>__{but it did happen, right? or not...}
<A>__{our guy winces in pain. tilt down to reveal:}
<B>__{his hands}
<A>__{frostbitten, still clutching the crowbar. she tries to take it out of his bloody, blackened hands and he gasps in agony.}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{oh jesus. ok. hold on.}
<A>__{she pours water from a plastic bottle over his palms to try and break the seal between the fused skin and metal.}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{ok, hold on, this is going to hurt.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{do it.}
<A>__{she fights her own gag reflex as she pulls the crowbar free. it comes away with several long black strips of dead skin still attached. his palms are bloody pulps. he fights to hold himself together as she ministers to him. the pain is so bad it brings tears to his eyes. his teeth chatter; he's teetering on the edge of shock.}
<C>__{guy }
<D>__{how bad?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{frostbite, second and third degree.}
<C>__{guy}

<P>__{(off his look)}
<D>__{don't make fun. what else do you have going on when you're thirteen?}
<A>__{she stretches herself out alongside him in the back seat. tugs up her layers of sweaters to expose her stomach.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(weak)}
<D>__{i'm kinda not in the mood anymore.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{we have to rewarm your hands. you have ice crystals in your blood. if we don't get circulation restored you could lose your fingers.}
<A>__{she takes his frostbitten hands and gingerly as possible presses them against the warm skin of her belly, rewarming them. they lie there in silence for a beat, faces inches apart.}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{what just happened to us out there?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{what do you mean? you were there.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i know, but who was he? where'd he go? it's like one minute there's a, a gun to my head and the next all the lights go out and he's gone, like a, like a }

<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i don't want to!}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{you think i do?! jesus. i'm just as freaked by what's happening as you. but we have to deal with it, `cause like it or not, it is happening...}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{then how do we make it stop?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{i don't know. they don't cover this in philosophy 101.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(casting for ideas)}
<D>__{what about that book, in the back?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{what book?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{something book of the dead.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{tibetan. it's not a how to manual. it's an 8th century buddhist guide on death and dying.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(despairing)}
<D>__{god. why is this happening to us?}
<A>__{he doesn't have an answer. they fall silent for a beat.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(hands on her belly)}
<D>__{i can feel your stomach rumbling.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i know. god, i'd give anything for some of those carr's crackers right now...}
<A>__{trying to take their minds off the grim situation.}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{so what else was in the grocery bag i forgot?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{um, let's see. duck liver pate with truffles.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{oh no...}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{some olives, the normal kind and also some of the little shrivelled black ones. a bottle of white wine...}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{mmmmm...}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{and for dessert, anisette biscotti and a thermos of espresso.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(ecstacy)}
<D>__{ohhhh...}
<A>__{she closes her eyes, imagining the meal that might've been.}
<C>__{girl }
<D>__{that's pretty much the exact meal i'd order for my last day on earth. i swear to god, if we ever get out of here i'm going to have to get a restraining order against }
<A>__{if they ever get out of here. her eyes brim, tears spilling down her cheeks. he tries to sound optimistic.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{can't be too much longer until dawn. someone's bound to come along then. a snowplow or something. right?}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{how are your hands?}

<D>__{yeah, but i mean really burn...}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{hang on. i think i have a few tylenol with codeine in my purse.}
<A>__{she climbs into the front seat and searches through her purse for the prescription bottle. with the poor light and without her contacts she has trouble finding it. she takes out her glasses and, a little embarrassed, slips them on.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{what's taking so long, nurse }
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{i just }
<A>__{she's about to climb back when something catches her eye. insert old newspaper the one used to patch the small gap in the passenger window. there's a faded photograph of a group of elderly priests gathered around a mangled `55 ford crown vic. we recognize one of them, glancing back over his shoulder at the camera, as the leader of the mysterious procession of dark figures from earlier.}
