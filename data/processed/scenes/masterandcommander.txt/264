<C>__{jack }
<D>__{go to your station, mr. blakeney.}
<A>__{blakeney begins to salute, doesn't, and retires, tears burning his eyes. a moment later there's a flash of orange astern as the acheron opens up with her bow chasers. an 18 pound shot screams past the side of the surprise to land with a column of spray just off their bows.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{good shooting. remind me to press her bow gunner, mr. pullings.}
<A>__{the second ball takes down some rigging.}
