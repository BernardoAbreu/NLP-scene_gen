<D>__{you keep running, nick! keep running now! can't keep warm if you don't keep running! we'll just be right back here... keeping track of your trail.}
<A>__{angle to show merlin's striding right in rudy's bootprints. pug fires off two shots. they kick up snow just behind rudy, struggling, panting...}

<D>__{wherever you run... we'll get there. fast as you want... we'll be there. we drive for a living, nick. twelve, fifteen, twenty hour days.}
<A>__{rudy's anguished, ducking behind some pines, trying to brush away his footprints. realizes it's useless. a bullet whistles through the pine branches.}
<C>__{merlin }
<D>__{we got nothing but time.}
<A>__{rudy takes a breath, crashes onward then stops at the sound of a rumbling. getting louder. closer. it's a car's engine. rudy spins for the source, focuses, and manages to make out a snow covered dirt road fifty yards away, down a swale. another bullet smashes treebark. rudy runs for it.}
