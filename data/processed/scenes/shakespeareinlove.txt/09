<L>__{exterior dr. moth's house. day.}
<A>__{will comes out. henslowe is waiting, standing in a horse trough to ease his feet. will walks straight past him, and henslowe follows.}
<C>__{henslowe}
<D>__{now where? will?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{to the palace at whitehall.}
<L>__{interior whitehall palace. backstage. day.}
<A>__{whitehall means nothing yet. we are behind closed curtains on a stage busy with preparations for the imminent performance of two gentlemen of verona. this is not a theatre but a banqueting hall, as we will see. richard burbage is to play "proteus." a boy player will play "silvia," and last minute improvements to his makeup etc. are being applied by burbage's mistress rosaline. "launce," one of the clowns, is the famous comedian will kempe. "launce's" dog, crab is in kempe's charge and is not helping much. there is no set. a helpful placard reading verona an open place, is ready to hand. musicians can be heard tuning their instruments. from the other side of the curtain there is an expectant bubbub. kempe leads the dog into the wings and rummages in a box of proops. he finds a skull. he has one foot on the box, his elbow on his knee, he looks at the skull...in other words he reminds us of hamlet. we see this from the pov of will, who is just entering through a door backstage.}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(approaching)}
<D>__{prithee, mr. kempe, break a leg. you too, good crab.}
<C>__{kempe}
<D>__{crab is nervous. he has never played the palace. when will you write me a tragedy, will? i could do it.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{no, they would laugh at seneca if you played it.}
<A>__{will's attention has been caught by rosaline, burbage's mistress. rosaline is big breasted, dark eyed, dark haired, sexual.}
<C>__{burbage}
<P>__{(to rosaline)}
<D>__{my sleeve wants for a button, mistress rosaline, where were my seamstress's eyes?}
<A>__{burbage kisses her mouth and slaps her behind. he comes over to greet will.}
<C>__{burbage }
<D>__{there is no dog in the first scene, will kempe, thank you. how goes it will?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i am still owed money for this play, burbage.}
<C>__{burbage}
<D>__{not from me. i only stole it. when are you coming over to the chamberlain's men?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{when i have fifty pounds.}
<A>__{rosaline brings over the last elements of burbage's costume and helps him into them.}
<C>__{burbage}
<D>__{are you writing?}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(nods somewhat defensively)}
<D>__{a comedy. all but done, a pirate comedy, wonderful.}
<C>__{burbage}
<D>__{what is the chief part?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{romeo. wit, swordsman, lover.}
<C>__{burbage}
<D>__{the title?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{romeo}
<C>__{burbage}
<D>__{i will play him. bring it tomorrow.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{it's for henslowe. he paid me.}
<C>__{burbage}
<D>__{how much?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{ten pounds.}
<C>__{burbage}
<D>__{you're a liar.}
<A>__{burbage digs under his costume for his purse, which is on a waistband, over his corset.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i swear it. he wants romeo for ned and the admiral's men.}
<C>__{burbage}
<D>__{ned is wrong for it.}
<A>__{will turns to see henslowe approaching.}
<C>__{burbage }
<P>__{(to will)}
<D>__{here is two sovereigns i will give you two more when you show me the pages.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{done.}
<C>__{henslowe}
<P>__{(arriving)}
<D>__{burbage, i will see you hanged for a pickpocket.}
<C>__{burbage}
<D>__{the queen has commanded, she loves a comedy and the master of the revels favours us.}
<C>__{henslowe}
<D>__{and what favour does mr. tilney receive from you?}
<C>__{burbage}
<D>__{ask him.}
<A>__{the master of the revels (tilney) comes through the curtain officiously.}
<C>__{tilney}
<D>__{she comes!}
<A>__{he disappears back through the curtains. the hubbub falls silent, rather dramatically, and all the busy players know what that means: they all crowd to the curtain and find places to peep through.}
