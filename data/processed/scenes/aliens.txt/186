<L>__{interior stairwell}
<A>__{ripley reaches an open grid emergency stairwell and sprints upward. it rocks and shudders with the station's death throes.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{you now have two minutes to reach minimum safe distance.}
<L>__{interior corridor elevators 182 }
<A>__{the lift reaches bottom, the doors rolling open. the queen turns and freezes, as if contemplating the open lift cage.}
<L>__{interior stairwell}
<A>__{ripley stumbles, smashing her knees against the metals stairs. as she rises she hears the lift motors start up. looking down through the lattice work of the station she sees the life cage start ominously upward. she knows there is only one explanation for that. she runs on, the stairwell becoming a crazy whirl around her.}
<L>__{exterior landing platform}
<A>__{ripley, with newt still clinging to her, slams through the door opening onto the platform. through wind whipped streamers of smoke she sees...the ship is gone.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{bishop!}
<A>__{her shouts become inarticulate screams of hatred, outrage at the final betrayal. she scans the sky. nothing.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(hysterical)}
<D>__{bishop!}
<A>__{newt is sobbing. the lift rises ponderously into view. ripley turns, backing away from the doors toward the railing. there is no place to run to on the platform. explosions detonate in the complex far below and huge fireballs swell upward through the machinery. the platform bucks wildly. nearby a cooling tower collapses with a thunderous roar and the shriek of rending steel. more explosions, one after another, rocketing up from below. ripley stares transfixed as the lift stops. the safety cage parts.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(to newt; low)}
<D>__{close your eyes, baby.}
<A>__{the lift doors begin to open. a glimpse of the apparition within. angle on ripley and newt as the drop ship rises right behind them, its hovering jets roaring.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{you now have thirty seconds to reach...}
<A>__{ripley leaps for the loading boom projecting down from the cargo bay and it raises them into the ship. a tremendous explosion rips through the complex nearby, slamming the ship sideways. its extended landing legs foul in a tangle of conduit, grinding with a hideous squeal of metal on metal.}
