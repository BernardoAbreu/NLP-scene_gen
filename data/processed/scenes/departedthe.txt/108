<L>__{interior deserted cafe day}
<A>__{madolyn and billy sit at a table. talking like friends now, emphatically non clinical. billy is zoned out, preoccupied, nervous.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{i'm assuming you want to change things, you know, change the people you know, change the people you meet, change everything, anything. too many choices can see like no choice at all...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{confucius say that?}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{so you do...something radical.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{"something radical," huh?}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{...yeah, you do... sometimes it's just a matter of picking a thing and doing it...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{so how long you been with this guy?}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{oh, four months. about four months.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{you love this guy?}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{it's pretty serious, yeah, it is.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{a head case or anything? i'm just curious...}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{no more than i am.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{then you're lucky. considering the odds, right?}
<A>__{he lifts his cup to drink.}
<C>__{billy }
<D>__{good, give him a shot.}
<A>__{this may not be exactly what madolyn wants to hear. but she nods.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{doctors aren't supposed to have illusions.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{yeah, that's because of vastly superior intelligence. godlike, really.}
<A>__{smiles, called on her shit.}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{ok, i'm in a serious, newly serious, relationship...there are...ups and downs...everybody has doubts, problems i mean doubts.}
<A>__{she realizes she may have glazed and gone a little too far on "problems".}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{what would you do if he was standing right there and saw us?}
<C>__{madolyn}
<D>__{i'd lie. to keep things on an even keel. you know all about it.}
