<L>__{interior cabin day}
<A>__{a knock on the door brings no response no one inside. gabe opens the unlocked door and steps inside.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{maggie?}
<A>__{no answer. gabe takes a look around the living room. his face tells us, without a doubt, this used to be his home. gabe moves inside, pausing at a mantle. two framed photos gabe and maggie sleeping together in a hammock, bolted to a sheer wall over a 2,000 foot drop. gabe, hal and maggie, all younger, all sporting drunken grins, in a mountain cave. gabe smiles for the first time today at this memory a banging at the back of the cabin shakes him out of it.}
