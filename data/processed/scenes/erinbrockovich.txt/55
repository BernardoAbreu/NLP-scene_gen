<L>__{interior the irvings' house, living room day}
<A>__{the house is furnished with little money, but lots of care. erin's on a plaid couch, in a sea of needlepoint pillows. out back, two girls, ages 9 and 11, are playing in a pool.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{this is a real nice place you got here.}
<C>__{donna }
<D>__{well it oughta be, with all the work i put into it.}
<A>__{she comes out from the kitchen with a tray of iced tea.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{i added air conditioning, put in the pool, made all those pillows by hand ...}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{yeah? i should learn to do stuff like that. they make the place feel real homey.}
<A>__{donna corrects the positioning on a couple of pillows.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{thank you. i think so too. that's why i'm being such a stickler on this house price thing. i don't mean to be a pain in pg&e's backside, especially after all they've done for hinkley, but i look around here and i think, if they want this place, they're gonna have to pay for it. and i don't just mean pay for the house; i'd like them to pay me for the trouble of starting over.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{cause first you gotta move, then there's decorating, and if the windows aren't the same size, you know you're making all new curtains. honest to god, i don't know if i have the energy. you know, i've been sick. me and peter both have.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{yeah, i'm real glad you brought that up. i was going through your file here, and i ran into these medical records. they kinda surprised me }
<A>__{this would be the perfect opportunity for many to get self pitying. but not donna. life's handed her a shitload of lemons, and darned if she hasn't made a shitload of lemonade.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{i know. they're more than a bit unusual. see, two years ago, pete got hodgkin's disease. that's a kind of cancer }
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{yeah, i'm real sorry to hear that.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{thank you. it's in remission now, thank the lord, but you never know. and then while that's going on, i end up having to have a hysterectomy. plus a whole mess of lumps removed from my breasts. all benign so far, but still, no matter how positive you stay, an operation can still take it out of you.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{i will say. holy moley.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{so the whole idea of selling the house don't get me wrong, i'd be glad to move to some better place, but if they aren't gonna pay us properly, i just don't see the pointerior}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{yeah, i can see that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i guess the only thing that confused me is not that your medical problems aren't important, but how come the files about them are in with all the real estate stuff?}
<A>__{donna tops off their iced teas.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{are you kidding? with how our lives are, if i start subdividing files, i will be sunk. i just kept all pg&e correspondence in one place.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{right, but i'm sorry, i don't see why you were corresponding with pg&e about it in the first place.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{well, they paid for the doctor's visit.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{they did?}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{you bet. paid for a check up for the whole family. and not like with insurance where you pay, then wait a year to be reimbursed, either. they just took care of it. just like that. we never even saw a bill.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{wow. why would they do that?}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{cause of the chromium.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{the what?}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{the chromium. well, that's what kicked this whole thing off.}
