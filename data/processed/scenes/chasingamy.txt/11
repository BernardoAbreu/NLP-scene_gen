<L>__{interior studio day}
<A>__{there is a door. there's a knock at the door. holden opens it and alyssa is standing there.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{somebody told me that they make comic books here, and i've got an idea for this story about a guy who comes to a club and high tails it when he finds out this girl is pay. any interest in a story like that!}
<A>__{holden smiles.}
<L>__{exterior riverfront park day}
<A>__{alyssa and holden walk through the park, eating hot dogs.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{m tv?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{twelve episodes.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{that's great, isn't it?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{banky seems to think so.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{but you don't.}
<A>__{they come to a swing set and sit down on the swings.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i don't know if that's the perception i want people to have of our stuff. i know this sounds pretentious as hell, but i like to think of us as artists. and i'd like to get back to doing something more personal like our first book.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{well when are you going to do that?}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{as soon as we have something personal to say.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{do you know how pretty you are?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{you're a pretty man.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{uh... thanks.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{oh. i get it. i'm into girls, so i have to find all men repulsive or something.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i didn't say anything.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{aren't there some men that you find attractive? granted, not enough to sleep with, but still just handsome or something!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{sure. harrison ford. and our mail man.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{well it's the same thing. i look at you and just find you really handsome. and you know, it has very little to do with your look, per se. your look is fine, don't get me wrong. but it's more your outlook. the things you say, the way you see things. it's... i don't know... attractive,}
<A>__{holden looks away, embarrassed,}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i weirded you our the other night}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{huh! no, not really.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{come on.}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's just that we've.., i mean, i've never seen that kind of thing up close and personal. it just took awhile to process, longer than usual.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{do you want to talk about it!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{um. if you want to.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i like you. i haven't liked a man in a long time. and i'm not a man hater or something. it's just been some time since i've been exposed to a man that didn't immediately live into a stereotype of some sort. and i want you to feel comfortable with me, because i want us to be friends. so if there are things you'd like to know, it's okay to ask me.}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{why girls?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{why men?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{because that's the standard}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{if that's the only reason you're attracted to women because it's the standard..}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{it's more than that.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{so you've never been curious about men?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{curious about men? well... i always wondered why my father watched 'hee haw'.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{you know what i mean.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{why not!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{no interest.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{because...?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{girls feel right.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{and that's how i feel. i've never really been attracted to men. i'm more comfortable with the idea of girls.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{wait, wait, wait you're still a virgin?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{but you've only been with girls.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{you're saying a person's a virgin until they've had intercourse with a member of the opposite sex?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{isn't that the standard definition?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{again with the standards. i think virginity is lost when you make love for the first time.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{with a member of the opposite sex.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{why? why only then?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{because that's the standard.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{so if a virgin is raped, then she's still a virgin?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{of course not.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{but rape is not the standard. so she's had sex, but not the standard idea of sex. hence, according to your definition, she'd still be a virgin.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{okay, i will revise. virginity is lost when the hymen is broken.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{then i lost my virginity at ten, because i fell on a fence post when i was ten, and it broke my hymen. now i have to tell people that i lost it to a wooden post i'd known my whole young life?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{second revision virginity is lost through penetration.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{physical penetration or emotional?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{emotional?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{well, i fell in love hard with caitlin bree when we were in high school.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{physical penetration.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{we had sex.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{yeah, but not real sex.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{i move to have that remark stricken from the record. on account of it makes you come off as completely naive and infantile.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{well where's the penetration in lesbian sex.}
<A>__{alyssa holds up her hand.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{a finger? come on. i've had my finger in my ass but i wouldn't say i've had anal sex.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{did i hold up a finger?}
<P>__{(waves her hand)}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(beat; then he gets it)}
<D>__{you're kidding?!?!}
<P>__{(she nods)}
<D>__{how...?!?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{our bodies are built to pass a child, for christ's sake.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{but doesn't it hurt?!}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{sure. but in a good way. and it's only a once in awhile thing reserved for really special occasions.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{what about not so special occasions?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{tongue only.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{but how can that be enough? i mean, let's be real how big can a tongue even get?}
<A>__{alyssa swallows what she's chewing and releases her tongue, which is just huge. holden is transfixed. alyssa wraps it back up and smiles, standing.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{she exits. holden remains in the swing. alyssa comes back in.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{come on.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{just...uh... just give me a moment.}
