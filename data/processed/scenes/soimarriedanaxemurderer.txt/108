<L>__{interior charles and harriet's room}
<A>__{charlie & harriet are all alone. the voices trail off down the hallway until they disappear. charlie and harriet stare at each other. harriet blocks the door. charlie looks around the room. the axe. the corkscrew. the letter opener. the fountain pen. at this point, everything in the room looks like a potential weapon. harriet takes the axe.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{i heard you on the phone before, charlie. there's something i've got to tell you.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(frightened)}
<D>__{harriet, i...}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{i've been married before.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i already know.}
<C>__{harriet}
<D>__{about my husbands?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yes. and i was meaning to have a word with you. we could get an annulment.}
<C>__{harriet}
<P>__{(screams)}
<D>__{aaahhhhhhh!}
<A>__{suddenly the power goes off again. they're both in the dark. a scuffle. charlie has restrained harriet, throws her in a walk in closet and locks it. from behind the door, we hear harriet wailing. which continues. charlie picks up the axe, looks at it, relieved at his lucky escape. he rushes to the door to escape. he opens it and standing there is rose.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{aaaaah, rose, i never thought i'd be so glad to see you.}
<A>__{rose smiles. charlie puts down the axe. the lights flicker back on.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(going to the phone)}
<D>__{maybe the phones are working again by now.}
<A>__{he listens for a dial tone. beside the phone he sees a note. he starts to read is:}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{'dear, harriet. i just can't handle the commitment. i'm leaving you.' signed, 'charlie.'}
<A>__{and behind him rose approaches with the axe raised.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what the hell is this? i didn't write this?}
<A>__{and at that moment he turns to find the axe being flung through the air at his head. he ducks just in time.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what the fuck?!}
<A>__{she takes another swing and she hits the lamp off the desk and the room is in complete darkness.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{charlie. why did you marry harriet? i warned you not to marry her, didn't i? i warned all of them. but none of them listened to me. they all went ahead and married her. she's the pretty one. where's harriet? what have you done with my sister, harriet?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{nothing, rose.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{if you've done something to my sister, harriet, i swear to god i will kill you.}
<A>__{we stay in charlie's hip pocket as he tries to get away from what he can't see. he stays very silent.}
<C>__{harriet}
<P>__{(from the closet)}
<D>__{where are you, charlie? what's going on?}
<A>__{then rose strikes a match. she lights a candle and comes toward him. he looks around. the window is open. and charlie is gone.}
