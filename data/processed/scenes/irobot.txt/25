<L>__{interior mainframe day}
<A>__{spooner and calvin enter the mainframe of u.s. robotics. this is the nerve center of the whole operation. walls lined with computers, screens, and thousands of controls.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{this is victor's home.}
<A>__{victor appears on a wall sized screen broken up into beehive like components.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{i will now play you the last thirty two seconds of dr. hogenmiller's life.}
<A>__{as we watch the screens. the elevator opens and doctor hogenmiller steps into the metal corridor. in countless angles. high, low, close up, wide. hogenmiller's face composed but tight. spooner watches the lab doors open to admit him. hogenmiller steps in. the doors slide closed behind him. nothing for a few moments. then a muffled gunshot. calvin jumps, startled. that's it. the cameras, still trained on the corridor.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{where's the tape from inside?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{dr. hogenmiller did not permit cameras to observe him while working.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{that was only within the last year.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{so we can throw paranoia into the mix.}
<P>__{(to victor)}
<D>__{fast forward.}
<A>__{a hundred plus screens all fast forward. police officers appear and force open the doors. now technicians appear and rush through in a blur...}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{um. i hate to be a stickler...}
<A>__{on screen, we see spooner and calvin enter the lab.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{but don't killers usually have to enter and exit the scene of a crime?}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{stop the recording.}
<A>__{spooner turns away from the footage. stares at calvin.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{they do, doctor. unless they've always been there and never left.}
<A>__{calvin looks at him. trying to understand.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{you think the murderer was in the lab the entire time?}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{if i'm right, it's still there...}
<A>__{spooner turns back to the screens. the image paused at the exact moment the mechanical guard rolled in front of the lab door.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{we just locked it in.}
