<L>__{exterior little goat farm night}
<A>__{the moon is full and fireflies dot the air as zoe and stan walk the grounds of the farm. nuts trots rolls ahead of them in a different wheelchair. this one is more rugged, with mountain bike type wheels.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{i can't believe that nuts has an off road wheelchair.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{he's got one for snow, too. with little skis on the bottom.}
<A>__{stan smiles and shakes his head.}
<C>__{zoe }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{you're really something.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{are you making fun of me? do you think i spoil him?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{no, i really think you're amazing. i mean, that story you told tonight. you just quit your whole professional life because of this little dog? started your own business, just like that?}
<A>__{zoe shrugs.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{you're very...unique.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{well, you're a dime a dozen. i can't tell you how many banjo playing, cheese makers i've been with.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{i keep waiting for the other shoe to drop. like, how can you be so perfect? why are you even still single? i can't believe no one's snatched you up by now.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i drive them all away, i guess.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{yeah, right.}
<A>__{stan takes her in his arms.}
<C>__{stan }
<D>__{look, i know this is all going fast...the time we're spending together, meeting my parents and everything...but, i'm okay with that. i want it to go fast.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{it is going fast.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{but isn't that okay? aren't we old enough to skip all the bullshit? what are we waiting for? i...want to be with you.}
<A>__{zoe opens her mouth. she's got to tell him. before this goes any further, she has to tell him.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{stan.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{come on. there's something i want to show you.}
