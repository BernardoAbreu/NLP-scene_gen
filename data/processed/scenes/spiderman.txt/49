<L>__{interior hospital room day}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{you have a visitor, doctor...}
<A>__{she leaves ock and thorkel alone.}
<C>__{thorkel}
<P>__{(enjoying this)}
<D>__{octavius, i'm afraid i have bad news for you.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{the cyclotron is damaged...}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{what used to be the cyclotron was permanently shut down this afternoon.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{but my work!}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{your work is a disaster! look at yourself!}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{myself? i don't matter. nobody matters anymore. to enter a new dimension we must first destroy our own...}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{what are you saying?}
<A>__{ock gets off his bed throwing away his sheet waving with his 4 waldos and 2 arms.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{destroy life. life is... insignificant. bags of sleepy, sluggish flesh. what would you say?}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{oh, my god, what are those horrible things sticking from your body?}
<C>__{ock}
<P>__{(gets more and more excited)}
<D>__{thorkel, if i told you that for one moment in time i broke all the laws! for one brief glorious moment, i broke through to the other side. i saw... i felt... i became creation.}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{what on earth are you rambling about?}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{destiny!!! my destiny! i see it all so clearly now. universal destruction, yes. all i need is the power... then i can destroy this illusion you call life. it is my destiny to lead us to the light!}
<C>__{thorkel}
<D>__{you're a madman.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{and you are a fool. i will end the universe as you know it. and in that final moment... i will laugh my ass off while you're kissing yours goodbye!}
<C>__{thorkel}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{goodbye is right, octavius... you're fired... sacked... canned. you are history, doctor octavius. and i couldn't be more pleased to be the first to tell you this good news...}
<A>__{a waldo shoots up and grabs thorkel by the throat. he gasps and screams silently as the telescoping waldo lifts him off his feet. he rises until his head is just inches from the ceiling.}
<C>__{thorkel}
<P>__{(his last words)}
<D>__{let me down ock... you crazy... monster! let me down!}
<A>__{then ock smiles and slams thorkel's head through the ceiling. plaster rains down. thorkel's legs scissor and kick and then go limp. ock throws his dead body on to the bed, and covers him with the white sheets.}
<C>__{ock}
<D>__{okey, dokey.}
