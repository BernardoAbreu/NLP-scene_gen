<L>__{interior labyrinth chasm}
<A>__{a deep chasm spanning the corridor. it is over fifteen feet wide. lex and sebastian see the chasm. they turn back to see the shadow of the alien behind them.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{we're gonna have to jump it.}
<A>__{she nods. the fact that there's no other way doesn't make it any better. they step back to get a running start. lex and sebastian attempt the impossible jump side by side but sebastian's slightly taller body is ahead of lex and he lands first on the far side. the edge of the ledge sebastian lands on begins to give way from the weight of his impact. lex lands a second later but because of the weakened ledge, the edge lex lands on gives way. lex almost makes it. almost. she hits the wall on the far side of the chasm. the impact smashes her ribs she grimaces in pain. but she manages to hang onto the ledge above her.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{hang on!}
<A>__{sebastian reaches down and grabs lex with his right hand, stopping her from falling.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{hang on!}
<A>__{he holds her there and begins to pull her up. suddenly lex's face fills with terror. sebastian just looks at her.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{lex pov: unfolding from the shadows is a fully grown alien! close on sebastian as he is snatched by the alien and violently yanked into the air. lex is horrified.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{sebastian!}
<A>__{lex doesn't even get a second to mourn as sebastian is yanked upward, his grip on her hand is pulled away and lex almost falls but she manages to hang on and pull herself over the edge. lex takes a moment to absorb what she has just witnessed, knowing full well what is in store for sebastian. she lies on the ground, bruised and heartbroken. close on the bottle cap: the pepsi cap that sebastian wears around his neck. it falls in slow motion right past lex.}
