<A>__{john walks in the front door, takes off his coat... the house looks different. cleaner, furnishings less ragged. john moves through his home, taking in the subtle changes. he reaches the study. and there, beside the desk, is something that makes him stop: a photograph on the wall beside the desk frank, julia & fourteen year old johnny sullivan.}

<A>__{the picture changed. john aged from 6 to 14. julia's hairstyle and clothes changed from 60's to 70's. frank's hair receded and grayed. jon is staring at evidence of a history that didn't exist before. john grabs the old family scrapbook he found in frank's trunk. opens it, unfolds "fireman killed" clipping. the main headline still reads: "october 13, 1969. amazin's take game 2. 2 1 lead. see sports." but the sub headline now reads: "fireman rescues runaway from inferno" john turns, stares at the radio questioningly. he starts to sit down at the desk when he spots something on the front edge of it. words carved into the wood, 29 years ago by fire fighter frank sullivan. the day john saved his father's life: i'm still here chief the last letter is missing. but then a patch of wood starts to morph as if it were being carved by an invisible knife.}
