<D>__{ok, dotty. everything else seems to be fine. now if it gives you any trouble at all, any sharp pain, any unusual discharge, you come and see me right away. they can be tricky sometimes.}
<A>__{dotty nods. ok, you can get dressed. we're all through. the girl starts to get dressed. st. luc scribbles something in her file and then takes it with him into the adjoining office, closing the door behind him.}
