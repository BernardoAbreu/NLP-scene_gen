<A>__{bleary eyed, macready is in the process of blowing up some strange inflatable object. as he puffs away, he still keeps an eye on the norwegian video tapes. his balloon begins to take shape. it blossoms into a life size replica of a full breasted woman. something on the tape catches his eye. he rewinds, then starts it forward again. the screen shows the norwegians on the surface of what appears to be an enormous, flat glacier. they are spread out on the ice around a large odd oval shape; their arms outstretched. it fades to black and then a norwegian comes on mugging childishly in front of the camera, apparently quite pleased with something. the tape fades to black again and the picture reappears. this time they have marked off the large oval area with flag sticks. closer shots show three of the men digging a deep hole into the ice. there is a small patch of something dark and metallic at the bottom. macready leans forward, intrigued. the men are now sinking something deep into the ice at various points around the markings. macready squints and mumbles to himself.}

<A>__{the tape jump cuts again showing a long shot of the markings. no norwegian in sight. an explosion kicks up the ice. a beat as the ice sprays to the ground. then the camera appears to shake as the ground beneath it quivers. another immense explosion follows. an earthquake like force throws the camera to the ground.}

<D>__{what in...}
<A>__{the tape continues, distorted, unviewable. a distinct crack in the lens. macready lets go of his companion and quickly rewinds. the deflating mannequin is sent sputtering around the room.}
