<C>__{margot}
<D>__{you know i can't speak in front of people. i'm doing this "conversation" at the bookstore in town on friday and i totally regret having said i'd do it.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{you're doing a "conversation?"}

<D>__{what? say it.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{it's nothing. it's just...i would come...i want to come. i get a kick out of it. it's just weird, you know... so, you're not here for...}
<P>__{(she stops herself)}
<D>__{okay, i get it. when did they ask you?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{a while ago. i'd said, no, but then when i was coming here anyway and...i guess it helps sales and...so...so.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i see.}
<A>__{we catch a quick glimpse of people walking ahead in the path.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{did i tell you, becky got her tubes tied.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{why? is she seeing someone? she's still obese, i assume.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i think it's symbolic.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i bet mom paid for it. we should audit mom.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i considered it in my twenties. you know, when i was fucking everyone. you remember.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i did my share.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{but not like me.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{you want to count?}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{no, margot, i don't want to count.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{what was it about dad that had us fucking so many guys?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i think it was the only time we could really feel unselfconscious and get out of our heads.}
<C>__{pauline}
<P>__{(dismissive)}
<D>__{i don't think that's it. i just think it was something we were good at.}
<A>__{behind, ingrid smacks her walking stick into claude's.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{your mom thinks bruce is gay.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{no, she said she had aspergers.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{i thought that's what that means.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{no, it's like lesser retarded.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{i have adult add.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{you mean child add.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{no, for some reason i have the adult one. maybe i'm retarded.}
<A>__{up ahead in the path is a couple, 40's, with a six year old girl. the back of the man's pants are smeared with dirt and the woman is packed into acid washed jeans. the little girl whines and lags behind. margot and pauline slow down. claude and ingrid catch up.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{come on!}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{i don't want to!}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{come on!}
<C>__{little girl}
<D>__{i don't want }
<A>__{the woman grabs the girl harshly by the arm and pulls her. the girl screams.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{the man and woman turn around sharply.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{be careful!}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{be careful the way you pull on that child's arm. you'll take it out of its socket.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{don't tell us how to treat our child.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i don't care how you treat your child as long as you don't hurt him.}
<C>__{pauline}
<P>__{(under her breath)}
<D>__{it's a girl.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{she threw a rock at me.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{she's a little girl!}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{she knew what she was doing.}
<A>__{she starts suddenly toward margot.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{there is no hitting in our family. do you understand?}
<A>__{margot backs up quickly. the woman stops about ten feet away.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{stay out of it, bitch.}
<A>__{the woman turns back around. she lifts the girl into her arms and they trudge over the incline and out of sight.}
<C>__{ingrid}
<D>__{that was the voglers.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{jesus, margot, what are you doing. they already hate us.}
<C>__{margot}
<P>__{(wiping her eyes)}
<D>__{don't tell me what i can and can't do. that's child abuse.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{mom, she was psychotic.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{stop picking on me. everyone.}
