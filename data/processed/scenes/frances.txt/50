<L>__{exterior west point beach night}
<A>__{frances sits on the old wood jetty staring out at the water, the lighthouse... harry approaches.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{...it's one thing to marry the guy, but did you have to sleep with him?}
<A>__{she cracks up. harry laughs at his mistake.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{shit. i meant the other way around.}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(still laughing)}
<D>__{well, the studio told me not to.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{is that why you did it?}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{who ever thought they'd be right for once? jesus, harry... it's a zoo back there }
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you're telling me.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{dick... and my mother! she acts like she's on mars or something }
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well, she's back to earth now. they're all pretty huffed up about your leaving. i think you better go back, kid.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{forget it.}
<A>__{he looks at her thoughtfully, then sits.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{you know, the funny thing is: it's not a great movie. i mean it could've been, but they screwed it up, gave it a happy ending. and all my friends, i know they're going to smile and say they loved it.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{if they say they love it, they'll probably love it. not everybody lies, you know?}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(warmly, to him)}
<D>__{no, they don't, do they?}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{frances, you're a movie star now. if you give them what they want, you can get anything.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{i don't have what they want, harry.}
<P>__{(stares at the water)}
<D>__{harry, will you tell me something? how can i keep making movies when people in the streets are starving?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{some people starve, kid. until we can do something about it, they might as well see a movie. makes 'em feel better.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{but i don't want to be like that. i want to do something...}
<P>__{(important)}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what're you gonna do, waste your talent? why not use it to make something worthwhile. you can do that, you know?}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{yeah, if i don't make too big an ass of myself.}
<A>__{they start to walk now along the beach. we see harry's car and the chauffeured limousine parked above.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{tell you what. let's ditch the limo. let me drive you up to that red carpet in my beat up chevy.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{the hell you will, harry york.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{come on, cinderella, your pumpkin awaits.}
<A>__{she shakes her head mischievously... moves backward unbuttoning her coat.}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(like a clock striking)}
<D>__{bong... bong... bong...}
<A>__{the coat falls.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{don't start, farmer.}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(dropping her scarf)}
<D>__{it's midnight, harry. my glittering raiments are dissolving.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(nervously)}
<D>__{the chauffeur. he's watching.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{he deserves a show. he missed the movie.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i'm serious, frances. this is important.}
<C>__{frances}
<P>__{(kicking off a shoe)}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{she kicks off another shoe, sailing it into the water. frances is zipping off her dress. harry bends to pick up the first shoe.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{a single glass slipper left glittering on the pearly sands. who was that girl, anyway?}
<A>__{harry watches her, mesmerized. the dress is off.}
<C>__{frances}
<D>__{'come and get it,' harry.}
<A>__{she skips off down the beach, her dress strewn on the sands. after a moment, from the darkness, we see her underclothes fly into view. harry can restrain himself no longer.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{hot damn!}
<A>__{he drops the shoe and runs after her, tearing off his clothes. after a moment, from the darkness, we hear her squeals of laughter.}
