<A>__{trent and mike are looking at menus. they're smoking at the table because the can.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{that was so fuckin' money . it was like that "jedi mind" shit.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{that's what i'm telling you, baby. the babies love that stuff. they don't want all that sensitive shit. you start talking to them about puppy dogs and ice cream. they know what you want . what do you think? you think they don't?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i know. i know.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{they know what you want, believe me. pretending is just a waste of time. you're gonna take them there eventually anyway. don't apologize for it.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i'm just trying to be a gentleman, show some respect...}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{respect, my ass. they respect honesty. you see how they dress when they go out? they want to be noticed. you're just showing them it's working. you gotta get off this respect kick, baby. there aint nothing wrong with letting them now that you're money and that you want to party.}
<A>__{the coffee shop waitress approaches the table. she's cute, but not nearly as hot as christy.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{are you ready to order?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{coffee...}
<P>__{(points to trent, who nods)}
<D>__{two coffees. it says "breakfast any time", right?}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i will have "pancakes in the age of enlightenment".}
<A>__{it goes over like a lead balloon.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{and you?}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{i will have the blackbeard over easy.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{i will be back with the coffee.}
<A>__{she takes the menus and goes.}
<C>__{trent}
<P>__{(genuinely)}
<D>__{nice, baby.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i should've said renaissance, right? it went over her head.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{baby, you did fine.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(disgusted with himself)}
<D>__{"age of enlightenment". shit. like some waitress in a las vegas coffee shop is going to get an obscure french philosophical reference. how demeaning. i may as well have just said "let me jump your ignorant bones."...}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{...baby...}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{... it's just, i thought "renaissance" was too excaliber, it's the wrong casino. she would've gotten it, though...}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{you did fine. don't sweat her. we're meeting our honeys soon. you know christy's friend is going to be money.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i hope so.}
<P>__{(checks watch)}
<D>__{we gotta go soon.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{baby, relax. it's just down the hall. she's gotta change... we'll be fine.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{we didn't do so bad after all.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{baby, we're money .}
<A>__{mike tries to catch the attention of their waitress, who is passing with a huge platter containing a breakfast banquet.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{excuse me. we're in a bit of a hurry.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{hang on, voltaire.}
<A>__{she passes their table and sets the entire feast in front of the bluehair from the casino who sits alone.}
<C>__{bluehair}
<D>__{i said two lox platters. this isn't thirty dollars worth of food. i have a thirty dollar voucher. this isn't my first time in vegas, you know.}
