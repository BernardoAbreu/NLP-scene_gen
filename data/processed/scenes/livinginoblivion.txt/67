<L>__{interior the set. day}
<A>__{the camera reveals nicole now seated in her spot on the bed. she rises as nick and palomino reappear and approach her from behind the set.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{nicole, listen...}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{nick, it's my fault the scene isn't working. i apologize. chad, i apologize to you too. i'm completely unfocused here and i think you're absolutely right; what we need to do is loosen the scene up somehow.}
<A>__{nick and palomino stare at nicole for a moment.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what would you like to do?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i was wondering if we could try improvising the scene. more along the lines of what chad has been doing. maybe that would help me find something.}
<A>__{nick's smile of gratitude to nicole looks almost drug induced.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{that's a fantastic idea. what do you think, chad?}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{hey, that's the only way i can work. let's take it apart, let's cut loose.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{good! and we'll shoot it! hell, why not?!}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{roll that motherfucking camera, wolfie!}
<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{kiss my ass!}
<A>__{although wolf says this quite loud, palomino doesn't hear him because he suddenly yells:}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{yeah! let's go!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{alright, now we're making a fucking movie! call it, wanda!}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{going for picture. lock it up. and roll sound.}
