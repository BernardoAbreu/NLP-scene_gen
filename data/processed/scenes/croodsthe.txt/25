<D>__{hah! it's scared of the dark... wait... we're scared of the dark.}
<A>__{and for good reason, because as the shadow from the setting sun falls across the croods. suddenly, thousands of piranha owls burst from the grasses around the croods and form a huge undulating cloud above them. it's a beautiful sight. the cloud of piranha owls then settle on a massive land}

<A>__{eep breaks a horn from the skull and blows on it loud and long. on guy hearing the horn. he is happy to hear the sound, knowing it's eep calling him. then as guy begins walking towards the sound, guy notices the circling birds in the sky. alarmed, he dashes off. guy appears at the treeline. he spots eep standing alone in the clearing. he sees the birds heading towards her. he runs and leaps off a rock outcropping jumping right over the croods who are huddled near the rock. guy lands and in one fluid motion knocking the horn out of eep's hand to stop the noise then strikes a spark with two stones. the birds close in, blotting out the remaining light. all goes black. then, a tiny leaf of flame flutters to life before guy. he throws two more handfuls of grass on it, and it flares up! the light splits the onrushing red tide of birds like a knife. for a few moments the croods are inside a tornado of the tiny monsters. the mass passes. grug slaps at one last smoldering bird fluttering past. grug turns to see guy, holding his daughter. grug's expression darkens. he snarls.}
