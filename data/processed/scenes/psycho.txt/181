<L>__{interior office of the chief of police (night)}
<A>__{lila is seated in a chair, sam standing close by. a bit apart from them, we see sheriff chambers, in quiet conference with the chief of police, the county sheriff, the district}
<B>__{attorney.}
<A>__{the coffee boy stands in the doorway. sam goes to him, takes a container of coffee from the box, carries it to lila, checking the notation on the lid as he goes.}
<B>__{med. close on sam and lila}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{it's regular. okay?}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(ruefully)}
<D>__{i could stand something regular.}
<A>__{sam smiles encouragingly, hands her the coffee. sheriff chambers enters shot, gives sam a container of coffee he has brought for him. sam takes it, nods a thank you. for a moment no one speaks. lila looks badly shaken, sam disheveled, but contained.}
<C>__{chambers}
<D>__{you two can go on home if you like.}
<P>__{(a sympathetic look at lila)}
<D>__{making that statement was enough for one night.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(to lila)}
<D>__{want to?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{no. i'm all right. i will feel better when all this is explained... if it can be.}
<A>__{sam looks a question at sheriff chambers. chambers shrugs doubtfully.}
<C>__{chambers}
<D>__{if anybody gets any answers, it'll be the fellow talking to him now... the psychiatrist. even i couldn't reach norman... and he knows me.}
<P>__{(to lila)}
<D>__{you warm enough, miss?}
<A>__{lila is about to answer, when she sees someone come into the room and rises anxiously. sam and sheriff chambers turn, follow her gaze.}
