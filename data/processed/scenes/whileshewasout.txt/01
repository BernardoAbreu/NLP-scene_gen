<A>__{from a sign reading "pleasant valley dream homes", a picture postcard boulevard of mini mansions curves into infinity. each home is brand new. each has the same size lawn, the same shrubs, the same satellite dish. each has an indistinguishable car parked in the driveway. all the homes have christmas decorations, christmas trees with baubles, lights and christmas stars sitting proudly at the top. the doors have christmas wreaths. the sheen of a recent rainfall makes all the surfaces glimmer in the lights. we halt outside one house.}
