<D>__{we see peppy on a shoot, sitting in a chair with her name on it, smoking a cigarette. everyone about her is busy preparing a shot. suddenly an assistant brings her a telephone. she takes the receiver with a smile and listens. her expression tightens a little. she hangs up, pensive for a moment. on set,the director gestures to his assistant that the shot is ready and they are good to go. the assistant goes towards peppy to let her know but, as he gets to where she should be, her seat is empty. he looks everywhere for her, but she has disappeared.}
