<L>__{interior stacy's room night}
<A>__{stacy stands there, looking gorgeous in an almost seethrough white robe. the rat pretends not to notice.}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{so... pretty nice house you've got here.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{thanks. so...}
<P>__{(puts hands on hips)}
<D>__{what do you want to do?}
<A>__{angle on the rat's face as he struggles with the memory of damone's words. "always call the shots."}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{do you want to see some pictures? i kept a lot of scrapbooks and pictures and stuff from junior high. how stupid, right?}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{stacy goes to her closet, reaches up to grab the books from the top shelf. the rat watches her robe slip up her legs. then she sits down next to him. her knee grazes his. it is almost too much for the rat. go for it. we see the rat struggle with the action of putting his arm around her. he almost does, but then reacts as she says suddenly...}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{this is me in the eighth grade. did you have mr. deegan?}
<C>__{the rat}
<P>__{(looking pained)}
<D>__{oh, yeah. i had mr. deegan.}
<A>__{her knee grazes him again. does she expect something?}
<C>__{the rat }
<D>__{look, stacy, i want you to know that...}
<A>__{the rat struggles. try as he might, he can't seem to cross the line. he can't make his move. he is woeful as he completes the sentence.}
<C>__{the rat }
<D>__{... i've got to go home.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{do you really have to go?}
<C>__{the rat}
<D>__{well... it's getting kind of late.}
<A>__{suddenly, the rat is seized with ambition. he reaches one hand around her right shoulder and plants the other hand directly on her left breast. it looks something like a wrestling hold. the rat looks at stacy. stacy looks back at the rat. the rat is absolutely frozen.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{i guess it is getting late, mark.}
<A>__{she shrugs him off, walks him to the door.}
