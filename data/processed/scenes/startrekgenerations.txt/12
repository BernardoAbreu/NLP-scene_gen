<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i remember reading about your missions when i was in grade school.}
<A>__{the original enterprise officers all stop and give him a look. harriman looks a little embarrassed he didn't mean to insult them. but kirk gives him a little smile, lets it roll off.}

<P>__{(breezy)}
<D>__{so, captain... this is the first starship enterprise in thirty years without james t. kirk in command. how do you feel about that?}
<A>__{the journalist has unknowingly touched a nerve. kirk's eyes flash for a moment the longer he's on this bridge, the more he realizes he doesn't feel good about it at all. he tries to shrug it off with a smile.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{just fine. i'm glad to be here to send her on her way...}
<A>__{he tries to move away from the journalist, who dogs him.}
<C>__{journalist}
<D>__{what have you been doing since you retired?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i've been... keeping busy.}
<A>__{at this point, chekov approaches with a young, (mid twenties) attractive, asian female ensign named demora.}

<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{your father... hikaru sulu is your father?}
<C>__{demora}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{you met her once before, but she was...}
<A>__{chekov holds out his hand and indicates a very short height.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{but that wasn't so long ago... it couldn't have been more than...}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{twelve years, sir.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{yes... well... congratulations, ensign. it wouldn't be the enterprise without a sulu at the helm.}
<C>__{demora}
<D>__{thank you, sir.}
<P>__{(to chekov)}
<D>__{let me show you the new inertial guidance system.}
<A>__{demora and chekov move off and kirk looks after them for a long beat. the expression on his face changes from shock to sadness... something is clearly bothering him. scotty moves over to kirk, with a smile on his face.}
<C>__{scotty}
<P>__{(to kirk)}
<D>__{damn fine ship if you ask me...}
<A>__{but kirk's mind is still on demora. he watches her as she moves to the helmsman's position.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{you know, scotty... it amazes me.}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{and what would that be, sir?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{sulu. when did he find the time for a family?}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{it's like you always said if something's important enough, you make the time.}
<A>__{kirk nods absently. scotty realizes something...}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{so... that's why you've been running around the galaxy like an eighteen year old. finding retirement a little lonely, are we?}
<A>__{kirk gives him a look.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{with that kind of tact, i'm glad you're an engineer and not a psychiatrist.}
<A>__{harriman interrupts.}
<C>__{harriman}
<D>__{excuse me, gentlemen... if you'll take your seats.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh... of course.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{revealing that three chairs have been neatly arranged to one side. scotty, kirk and chekov all take their seats. the journalists take positions on the opposite side of the bridge. harriman moves to the command chair and the rest of the bridge crew go to their stations.}
