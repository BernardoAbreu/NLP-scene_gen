<D>__{screenplay by david webb peoples and jeb stuart revised draft september 8, 1987}
<B>__{face in on the surface of the ocean}
<A>__{sunny and placid then slowly we begin descending underwater moving down from the bright surface waters, through layers of fish and marine life... a school of vibrantly colored fish move with the current, their numbers are enormous, their movements in unison. suddenly out of the darkness a barracuda cuts through the school, taking out four or five before disappearing into the shadows. the school moves on as if nothing happened, quickly closing ranks where the missing ones swam only seconds before.}
<B>__{we move deeper and deeper}
<A>__{fish disappear, darkness envelopes us. cold and lifeless where light has never penetrated...five thousand feet, ten thousand. deeper, where only strange, self illuminating echoniderms move eerily through the currents. then suddenly we hear static from radio transmission. then voices...}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{burritos...enchiladas...}
<C>__{dejesus}
<P>__{(hispanic voice)}
<D>__{oh, gag, man, how can you eat that stuff?...}
<C>__{bowman}
<P>__{(female)}
<D>__{i can't wait for fresh vegetables...}
<A>__{several voices suddenly break into argument..."vegetables?" "shit," "burgers"...suddenly another voice rises above the others.}
<D>__{beck's voice radio okay, cut the chatter. you're not out of here, yet. who's the hook? seven?...you got a hook on container 22?}
<A>__{a pause, then more voices.}
<D>__{sixpack's voice radio}
<P>__{(redneck drawl)}
<D>__{the man's asking if you're hooked on 22, you dumb shit. jones' voice radio watch your mouth, sixpack. hello, shack, seven, here. i ain't the hook, over.}
<A>__{a light flares out of the darkness, suddenly illuminating an immense shape fifteen hundred pounds of hardened metal nearly seven feet tall. it is a motorized diving suit and we see the stenciled name, willie across the front breastplate. as it pivots we see the stationary worklights around the base of a large underwater mining operation, the shack. then a woman's voice.}
<C>__{willie's voice}
<P>__{(woman's voice)}
<D>__{six to shack. i'm the hook.}
<A>__{inside the shack control room littered with papers, half full coffee cups, and a confusion of wires and very low tech, high tech equipment beck sits at the monitor controls. he is younger than we expected, twenties, clean cut good looks. he'll be a hell of a good looking man at thirty five, he just needs to be hardened. from the looks of the coffee cups around him he's on his way.}
<D>__{beck's voice radio okay, six, let's wrap this container and call it a day.}
<A>__{above him a bank of monitor screens. each one labeled with a crew member's name and providing a video picture from a camera mounted on their helmet. beck reaches above him and throws a console switch which activates another monitor labeled rov. with a joystick he manipulates an outside camera(the rov), its picture we see on the monitor. it is moving.}
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{willie's pov the inside of her helmet is a grid of led gauges monitoring air reserve, body temperature, atmospheres, heart rate, blood pressure. she stops next to a pair of railroad like tracks and removes the tool attached to the end of her arm. the move is practiced and professional, like a cook changing the tool on a set of egg beaters. first, she inserts the existing tool into a lock on her opposite arm which holds it while she disengages the tool. next, she selects the next tool from the storage compartment at her waist and punches it into position. sixpack's voice comes over the radio.}
<C>__{sixpack's voice}
<D>__{hey, willie, you trip on a tit or something? we're all waiting on you, honey.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(under control)}
<D>__{keep your pants on sixpack. i promise you'll be inside before "mr. rogers' neighborhood" comes on.}
<A>__{over the radio we hear other men's voices laughing. they like willie and cheer her on. "tell him, willie," "atta girl," etc... willie clicks in her last tool and turns. expertly she hooks a large dumpster like container, the container to what looks like an underwater parachute a container transporter which when filled with oxygen it lifts the massive container onto the tracks where it can be hauled in by a winch.}
<C>__{willie's voice}
<D>__{six to shack...hook's on. ready to winch.}
<B>__{underwater machinery}
<A>__{halogen lights illuminate bits and pieces of dredges and dumpsters squatting in the gloom. a winch begins grinding and the big, newly hooked container lurches down the tracks. it comes to the end where a winch fits it into place with several others to complete a set. we hear beck's voice.}
<D>__{beck radio ok, that's it. come on in.}
<A>__{more motor suited divers appear, their helmet lights glaring. their breastplate names catch in the dim lights: cobs, bowman, willie. as they approach the underwater lock, where an elevator will transport them up into the shack, we see signs of human life: a basketball goal attached to the side of the building; stickers and signs: "no bozos," etc. a formal sign towers over the entrance. it says: transocean corp. shack 6.}
<B>__{on one of the crew}
<A>__{he moves behind the others. suddenly he freezes in his tracks and slowly rotates his helmet on his shoulder in the glare of his helmet beam we see the a hideous looking sea spider. it's thick legs moving eerily down his arm. carefully, so as not to disturb the creature, a mechanical motor hand moves into position below it, and in one quick movement, snares it. close on metal waist pocket. the latch opens and the writhing sea spider is shoved inside. from the pocket we move up the diver's suit until we see the name sixpack on the breastplate. he looks around to see if anyone has noticed then continues on toward the shack. on two divers(jones and dejesus) they walk together to the shack. a latino voice, dejesus, comes over the radio singing an old miller beer jingle in an exaggerated accent.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{when it's time to relax.... one thing stands clear...}
<B>__{inside on beck}
<A>__{as he listens to the singing over the tinny speaker, we see he aches to be a part of their comaraderie, but is alienated by age and rank. he is the shack boss, management. he listens as a booming black voice joins in off key.}
<C>__{jones' voice}
<D>__{mil ler's tastes too good to hurry through...}
<A>__{as the singing continues, beck looks over at an empty chair in front of a bank of equipment monitors. the vital signs of each miner and his equipment are registered on this console. the chair in front of them sits conspicuously empty. this doesn't please beck, neither does a hand written sign under the console which states: the doctor is out . dejesus' pov inside his helmet we see the grid of led gauges monitoring vital signs.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{...beer after beer...}
<A>__{suddenly a red warning light begins blinking in the bottom corner inside dejesus' helmet. the words to the song freeze in his mouth. his voice becomes edged with panic.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{oh, shit... jones radio}
<P>__{(to dejesus)}
<D>__{hey, hazy, i'm not that bad, man.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<P>__{(rising terror)}
<D>__{jonesy! i'm losing compression... i'm going to blow my suit, man! beck! doc! help me!...}
<B>__{inside}
<A>__{beck grabs his microphone. he tries to remain calm but there is a definite tremble in his voice.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{give me a readout, dejesus.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<P>__{(gripped with panic)}
<D>__{ahhhh!}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{the other divers move quickly to dejesus.}
<C>__{beck }
<D>__{dejesus! a readout!}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{he don't need a readout, man, he needs help!}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(anything but calm)}
<D>__{stay calm!}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{calm!? where's doc?}
<B>__{inside}
<A>__{beck stands in front of the equipment monitors, lost.}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(trying to keep control)}
<D>__{the internal monitors read normal.}
<A>__{on the miners, panicked}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{where's doc?!}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{he's not at his station.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<P>__{(panicked)}
<D>__{oh, mother of jesus, forgive me of my }
<C>__{beck's voice}
<P>__{(making a decision)}
<D>__{get him into the shack.}
<A>__{dejesus' gauges begins a countdown to implosion. "15, 14,}
<L>__{13..." dejesus is grabbed by his co workers and hurried the}
<A>__{last few yards to the shack. inside shack same on beck sweating bullets, turns a dial on the instruments and suddenly, dejesus' gauges jump to life. we see the same countdown in progress on the shack's gauges!..10, 9, 8...}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{on dejesus he is forced into the lock, the underwater elevator room is eerily lit. his readout continues inside his helmet...5, 4, 3...dejesus screams.}
<B>__{on beck}
<A>__{dejesus' scream comes over his radio in the control room. beck hits the elevator switch nothing happens. he hits it again harder and suddenly dejesus voice is drowned out by the screaming vacuum pumps of the elevator. it's moving! beck looks up at the monitor of the interior lift lock. inside lift lock we see dejesus's suit dripping wet. it stands inside the lift lock, ankle deep in greasy bilge water. close on his eyes, for a moment they remain closed, then suddenly they flutter. he's alive! the mess later the blackboard prominently displayed on the wall of the mess features neatly stenciled letters that say: "days till pickup". the number scrawled on the chalk smudged board obviously changes daily. right now, it's a "3"... a clunk, clunk and a coke can rolls out of a compact coke machine. a big, sandy haired man, sixpack, takes the soft drink, pops the top and downs it in one long pull while he looks over an arguing group of deep sea miners: jones, black, athletic, 30's; cobb, 50's, a career miner with a mouthful of gum; bowman, 35, attractive, hardened woman, she has seen more of the world than any of them; willie, twenties, fresh good looks, master electrician, optimist. dejesus, latino, wiry muscles, he keeps his head down, still shaken from his experience. the strain of a month of working two miles beneath the ocean's surface has drawn nerves tight.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{i'm telling you, it's the suits!}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{fuck the suits, it's the people monitoring them. it doc had been there like he's supposed to it never would've happened!}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{and just what the fuck would he have done to stop it, huh?}
<A>__{sixpack looks over the group, then suddenly crushes the empty coke can in his hand, punctuating the action with a huge belch.}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{that would have been you, dejesus...}
<A>__{dejesus keeps his head down.}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{yeah...i was standing next to a guy who blew a suit once in the indian ocean...little tiny hole in the fucking toe of his suit ...ocean came in and the pressure crammed his whole fucking body up into his helmet. they just buried his helmet.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{i know all about implosion, man.}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{yeah, i bet you do.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i bet you were imploding in your pants.}
<P>__{(laughs then imitates a hysterical dejesus)}
<D>__{jonesy! doc!...help me! help me!}
<A>__{dejesus springs for sixpack's throat as we cut to: beck same beck's eyes are blazing with cold authority as he speaks.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{knock it off, sixpack! i know it's been a long month for every one, but we can't let something like this tear us apart...}
<A>__{beck glares, ready for an argument, but as we pull back we see he's talking to the mirror, in his tiny quarters. apparently he fails to convince himself because his hard look fades and he mutters unhappily as he turns away.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{shit...}
<A>__{he turns around to face a smiling picture of himself at college graduation with his eastern establishment looking father. leadership "how to" books like the one minute manager , etc. line his bookshelf with technical manuals on underwater mining. he opens his door to leave when suddenly a loud metallic groaning noise stops him cold. the entire shack seems shifting, like a giant waking from a nap.}
<B>__{mess}
<A>__{the noise stops the fight between dejesus and sixpack cold. all eyes go to the ceiling and walls.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{fuck the suits man...this place is going to kill us first.}
<A>__{just as suddenly as it began the groaning noise stops and in its place we hear an intermittent rattle in the air system. only cobb seems undisturbed by this sound.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<P>__{(listening)}
<D>__{there it is again...}
<P>__{(sitting down again)}
<D>__{two more days. i tell myself 'you can make it two more days '}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{what's the weather like up top?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{clear for pickup.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{let's hope it holds.}
<A>__{cobb looks up disgustingly.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{then what? huh?}
<P>__{(to everyone)}
<D>__{then what? you folks think going up top's the answer to all your problems. well, it ain't.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{give us a break, cobb...}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{a break? you folks don't need a break, you need psychiatrists. 'know what you'd be doing if you were up there, right now?}
<C>__{sixpack}
<P>__{(a boorish leer)}
<D>__{eating pussy and drinking brew...}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{eating pussy my ass. what about lines at the bank: what about getting stuck in traffic?}
<C>__{sixpack}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{wherever i can find it.}
<A>__{everyone laughs but cobb, we see he's serious.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{bullshit! i will tell you what you'd be doing! you'd be watching news on tv that's so fucking bad it makes you nauseous. so you go out and get in your car to get some fresh air and after you've been driving for five minutes you realize the air's so damn dirty you don't dare breath it! that's what you've got to look forward to...}
<B>__{lower ring corridor}
<A>__{beck approaches the mess and as he nears it we hear cobb ranting inside.}
<C>__{cobb's voice}
<D>__{...and if you're lucky enough to make it back home to your house that looks the fucking same as everyone else's, you'll find your wife's just as fat as she was when you left and the only reason your kids ain't strung out on the drugs they were using when you left is that they've found some new drugs which fuck 'em up even more!... you people just don't appreciate how good you've got down here...}
<A>__{beck hesitates at the door to the mess, as though screwing up his courage, then takes a deep breath and enters as we}
<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{inside the mess}
<A>__{everyone looks up as beck enters and the room goes quiet. beck notices doc's empty chair.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{doc eat already?}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{the good doctor hasn't showed yet.}
<A>__{looks are exchanged. sixpack smirks knowingly.}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(to dejesus)}
<D>__{how do you feel, dejesus?}
<C>__{dejesus}
<P>__{(obviously embarrassed to be singled out)}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{better let the doc take a look at you, after dinner.}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{yeah, since he was busy earlier when you needed him.}
<A>__{he cracks up and beck turns on him.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{cut it, sixpack.}
<A>__{sixpack shuts up, but beck notices the others feel the seriousness of doc's absence during the emergency.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{leave the doc to me. i'm going to talk to him.}
<C>__{sixpack}
<P>__{(sarcastically, under his breath to bowman)}
<D>__{'makes me feel better already...}
<A>__{beck gets his tray but it is clear he is thinking about something else. he clears his throat.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{i've been looking at the duty roster...at the shack hours outstanding...}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{uh, oh...i see where this is going...}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(ignoring jones)}
<D>__{...all of you owe time and i thought tonight would be a good time to }
<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(erupting)}
<D>__{no way, mister beck! no fucking way ! we just did a full shift, you can't call shack duty on top of a full shift. it's a contract violation!}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{whooo! right on, cobb! let's hear it for our shop steward!}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{hear that becky, er, mr. beck? company got to abide by the rules.}
<A>__{five faces stare at beck. they're looking for weakness.}
<B>__{this is a challenge to his authority.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{i know all about the contract. the point is you can follow the goddamn contract to the letter and pull your shack duty tomorrow...or you can get it done tonight and call tomorrow a down day. it's up to you.}
<A>__{this leaves the group momentarily speechless. even dejesus comes out of his stupor.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<D>__{you giving us a day off?}
<A>__{beck nods. cobb eyes him suspiciously.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{what about our quota?}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{you're only twenty five tons off quota. barring an unforeseen problem you should reach it easily on the last day.}
<P>__{(he looks at the group)}
<D>__{it's just a day off. you don't have to take it, i just thought it might help.}
<A>__{the others look around for agreement but jones doesn't need anyone else's approval, he's already made up his mind.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{count me in.}
<A>__{bowman nods her head also and the others unanimously agree. buoyed, beck moves ahead, businesslike...}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{cobb, jones, i want you to do something about that damn rattle in the air system...}
<P>__{(to bowman and sixpack)}
<D>__{bowman and sixpack...living quarters...}
<C>__{sixpack}
<P>__{(disgustedly)}
<D>__{shit...}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{williams...get dejesus' suit on the "sick rack" and do a diagnostics.}
<P>__{(to group)}
<D>__{any other suit problems she should know about?}
<A>__{sixpack suddenly looks up as the group disperses.}
<C>__{sixpack}
<P>__{(to willie)}
<D>__{my pocket. check my pocket, will ya, honey?}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{your pocket?}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{the latch is screwed up. or the hinge.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(disgusted)}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{lower ring corridor same on beck he starts out of the mess and by chance finds himself walking with willie. beck is obviously uncomfortable with the crew, even after 28 days together. she smiles, friendly, at ease.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{you did good...}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(a little surprised)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{today...with dejesus. that was smart thinking to get him inside...}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{there probably wasn't anything wrong with his suit...}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{still...you did the right thing.}
<A>__{she turns off toward the swamp, leaving beck with the tiny, but honest compliment. he savors it. the swamp later the "swamp" (where dejesus came up), is ankle deep in greasy bilgewater. the door slides open, willie enters, and switches on a bank of fluorescent lights. the room is spooky even with the lights. the giant machine suits, we saw earlier outside, hang from racks like sleeping monsters. willie straps on a utility belt and checks her tools a motorized screwdriver, a power wrench, a long necked, laser tipped soldering iron(looks like a long necked screwdriver) then splashes through the bilge water to the control switch and hits the start button. nnnnnnnnnn. a motor moves one of the suits along the track toward willie. as it turns the corner toward us we see it says: dejesus. doc's office same beck opens the door to doc's quarters and we see doc putting on a fresh shirt. a man in his 50's, he must have once been quite handsome and intelligent, but has now gone to seed.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i must have dozed off.}
<A>__{beck looks on the cabinet and sees a bottle of old granddad whiskey. he picks it up.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{snakebite medicine...never pack my bag without it.}
<A>__{beck doesn't smile. he puts the bottle back down and doc watches him in the mirror.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{are you planning on working tomorrow?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{well, i will be on the golf course in the morning. then, if i don't have any babies to deliver }
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(cutting him off)}
<D>__{we almost had an accident today. dejesus' suit...}
<A>__{the doc stops buttoning his shirt and locks eyes with beck.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{you got something to say to me, son?...}
<A>__{beck definitely has something to say, but confronted, he falters.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{i...i think it's important to have the second officer on deck.}
<A>__{doc smiles, and goes back to buttoning his shirt.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i will keep it to nine holes in the morning.}
<A>__{the dormitory same small but functional. the bunks can be closed off with a privacy door. photographs and bumper stickers on the walls of the bunks provide the only personal touches in an otherwise sterile environment. willie's bunk is wallpapered in detailed interplanetary maps; sixpack's privacy door has a bumper sticker which proclaims: "i may be fat, but you're ugly and i can diet." dejesus' has posters of the alps, and the rockies; bowman's has clipped pages from "gourmet" of meals she dreams for; cobb's has nothing, as if perfectly content to be where he is instead of somewhere else. inside jones' bunk is an indoor basketball goal. bowman and sixpack scrub down the walls of the dorm with a sponge and pail. sixpack pauses and smirks, his eyes on bowman's chest.}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{christ...what a pair...}
<C>__{bowman}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{what was that? what'd you say?}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{i said, "what a pair" the boy wonder shack boss and his drunken doctor buddy make...}
<P>__{(innocently)}
<D>__{why? what did ya think i said?}
<A>__{corridor "a" same jones and cobb are kneeling in a corridor, unfastening a big plate on the floor with a power wrench. overhead a huge plexiglass conduit flows with water from the desalinization system. the interior wall of the corridor is meshed wire exposing the throbbing machine floor of the shack. cobb removes the last bolt and jones lifts off the floorplate exposing the guts of the shack the bilge dark and wet. without the plate the rattle in the air system is much louder and sinister.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{listen to it for christsake.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{ah, it's just old, like me. you don't see the doc opening me up every time i get a new creak in my joints...i say, as long as it's recycling the air let the next shift deal with it. but, 'long as we're here...}
<A>__{he pulls a retractable ladder from inside the hole and drops it down into the wet darkness, without hesitating he climbs down, stopping at the bottom to look up at jones. jones seems in no hurry to accompany him.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{you gonna sit there on your butt or give me a hand?}
<A>__{jones reluctantly starts down after him. beck's quarters same beck in his quarters. he seems to be talking to himself but as we move around him we see he is talking to a video monitor. on screen we see martin, 30's, a slick bureaucratic executive with transocean corp. whose face is all we see on the video monitor.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{two hundred and fifty two tons of magnesium and 15 tons of sodium.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(taking notes)}
<D>__{sounds like a good week, beck. in fact...i put your folder in front of the vice president of district operations last night...}
<A>__{beck stops. martin notices his concern.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{you're good executive timber, beck. a lot of management trainees wash out when they have to go under for their first tour. but you've done well.}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(smiles, relieved)}
<D>__{thank you, martin.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{don't thank me, yet, but it is important to know where you're going and who your friends are... 'know what i mean?}
<A>__{he stares hard at beck, but doesn't wait for an answer.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{the one thing i've learned in this company is you can't have enough friends. it's the only way to survive.}
<A>__{close on a boom box lower ring corridor same the boom box sitting on a wall pipe is blaring john denver's rocky mountain high. dejesus is singing along loudly in his thick accent as he works on the intercom system. he finishes, closing a metal box which says: onboard communications. swamp same on willie she has connected dejesus' suit to the diagnostic computer and is going through the computerized checkpoints an electronic list of literally hundreds of possible problems.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{probably a short.}
<A>__{suddenly, the computer pauses on one: it says: electrical short.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{good guess, williams.}
<A>__{she types in a "help" command and the computer screen displays an electrical circuit pattern that would leave most electrical engineers baffled. willie hardly bats an eye.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{piece of cake.}
<A>__{she immediately opens the circuit panel on dejesus' suit and pulls the laser soldering iron out of her tool belt. with two quick spot welds she repairs the short, then replaces the panel. finished, willie presses the control switch and the suits begin to move along the track. a new suit rounds the corner toward us. it says sixpack. the bilge same the walls are dark and moist. water drips from the pipes. the rattle in the air system continues loudly as jones leans over and hands cobb another tool. crouched in the humming machinery, cobb spits his wad of chewing gum into a greasy hand, kneads it a couple of times, then grins at jones.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{okay, watch this..}
<A>__{the swamp same the monotonous clatter of the air system is the only sound in the gloomy swamp as the huge suit labeled sixpack stops directly in front of willie. she reaches up to open the pocket latch when she stops...listening. the noise in the}
<B>__{air system has stopped.}
<A>__{the bilge same jones looks incredulously at cobb. he can't believe that's all it took. cobb starts gathering up the tools.}

<D>__{shhhh...don't tell no one.}
<P>__{(winks)}

<D>__{you know that innsbruck has 64 square miles of ski slopes, man? think about that. sixty four square miles.}

<A>__{implosion and suddenly explodes in a huge shudder of energy! underwater later whoosh! a parachute like container transporter zoom toward the surface. a heavy suited crew member flashes past us. its helmet light pierces the darkness, then disappears. a moment later another transporter follows, racing out of the darkness after the first. beck's pov we see the vital signs lit in a ring around his helmet. the depth gauge races past with blinding speed as he moves closer to the surface. willie's pov she tilts her head upwards. she snaps off her light and sees instead of black, a lighter gray, then suddenly faint traces of light in the water above her. at first it seems like her eyes are playing tricks on her, then we see it again a glimmer of light.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{light. beck, i see light!}
<B>__{on beck}
<A>__{he follows her look. light is coming fast, brightening as they rise. the led numbers inside their helmets click off..."125, 100, 75..."}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{wait till you reach thirty five before you blow your suit...}
<C>__{willie's voice}
<D>__{roger.}
<A>__{willie's pov her numbers count down "....70, 60, 50, 40..."}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{ejecting.}
<A>__{she yanks at the handle on the chest plate and whoosh! the plate bursts open and reveals a second interior handle. her hand gropes for it.}
<B>__{sunlight is streaming down through the water as she rushes upward.}
<A>__{whoosh! the helmet and torso of the suit are blown open as she pulls the second lever detaching her from the balloons. no longer oxygen supported or being pulled upward, willie frees herself from the heavy suit and swims to the surface.}
<B>__{suddenly she breaks the surface and catches a glimpse of the}
<A>__{sun, dazzling through a million droplets of water as a huge}
<B>__{swell carries her up even higher.}
<A>__{then she's underwater again, struggling desperately to pull the tab on the life jacket around her neck. suddenly a male hand grabs the tab for her and pulls. she looks up at beck.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{we made it!}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{where's jones?}
<A>__{holding onto each other willie and beck ride a swell. at the crest we see jones in the trough below, face down. beck breaks away from willie and swims through the waves to reach jones. reaching him beck pulls his face out of the water and inflates his life jacket.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{is he okay?}
<A>__{beck lays jones head back against the life jacket. for a moment. jones seems lifeless, then his eyes blink and squint against the sunlight. beck turns back to willie and as he and jones ride the next crest he gives her the "thumbs up."}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(jubilant)}
<D>__{the sun! the sun!}
<A>__{jones looks at beck and grins.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{what happened to that typhoon?}
<A>__{calm sea later beck, willie and jones cling to each other as they search the horizon.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{are you sure you saw something?}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{how many times i got to tell you. i saw a ship.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{well, why haven't they answered our flares?}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{we'll fire one more, that leaves us one last one.}
<A>__{beck pulls the flare off his latex wet suit and fires it into the sky casting a comforting yellow glow over the dark water. the light fades, willie looks at jones.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{are you okay, jonesy?}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{tip top, willie...tip top.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(testing him)}
<D>__{who's the best power forward in the nba...jameson?}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(tired, but with fight)}
<D>__{jameson? who are you trying to con...?}
<A>__{they both manage a weak laugh, then beck sees something.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{i will be damned. look!...a flare!}
<A>__{as a small swell lifts them up we can see a tiny flare just fading against the sky.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{it saw us!}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{answer them and quit kicking me!}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{i'm not touching you!}
<A>__{whoooooooosh! beck fires another flare into the sky. as the flare arcs downward, willie feels another bump and for the first time sees the sharks circling them.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{no...no, no, no.}
<A>__{the sharks tighten the circle as the flare fades.}
<L>__{exterior u.s. coastguard ship's bridge same}
<A>__{a captain watches the flare fade through his binoculars and speaks to someone o.s.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{i thought you said you'd combed this area?}
<A>__{he lowers his binoculars as we widen to reveal martin standing on the bridge. he also lowers his binoculars and smiles coolly as he lies.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{we did....many times.}
<C>__{captain}
<P>__{(looks at martin then to a lieutenant)}
<D>__{initiate rescue.}
<A>__{we hold on martin's face as from}
<B>__{the fore deck of the ship}
<A>__{a rescue chopper with pontoons lifts off the deck and banks off toward the fading flare. ocean same jones, willie and beck stay bunched close together. suddenly willie feels another bump.}
<C>__{willie}
<P>__{(panicky)}
<D>__{it hit me! where are they?!}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{i can't see them!}
<A>__{suddenly he is bumped by a shark. willie sees one only two feet away. they are surrounded. suddenly jones stare to taunt the sharks aggressively.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{all right! i've had enough of this shit! you want meat, motherfucker? come on, eat me, sucker, try some dark meat!}
<A>__{he pushes away from the group despite beck's attempt to stop him.}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(taunting sharks)}
<D>__{what's wrong you snout nosed bastards? my meat too tough for you?!}
<A>__{amazingly the sharks begin to disappear. willie and beck watch stunned. even jones is surprised.}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(to willie and beck)}
<D>__{whoa! did you see those fools run? they know whose boss.}
<A>__{he jabs his arm upward in triumph and for the first time we see a gash across his forearm.}
<B>__{underwater pov}
<A>__{as jones crows triumphantly, we suddenly see his wet suit ripping along his thighs! surface ocean jones is chortling, suddenly his smile vanishes, something is happening... we hear the drone of the approaching helicopter...thump, thump, thump...the blades of the helicopter sound out over the waves. it's lights are visible. willie and beck wave frantically as jones drifts closer to them!}
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{jones' legs his wet suit is now completely split open and we see the black scales spreading!}
<B>__{the helicopter}
<A>__{hovers over the group below and lands on the water. its blades beat the surface into waves. the winch operator hurls out a rescue harness and beck helps willie into the ring. he clicks the fastener and suddenly they both lock eyes. before willie can say anything beck falls back and signals the winch operator who begins hauling her to safety. immediately beck locks back at jones and extends his arm.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{jonesy...give me your hand!}
<A>__{willie reaches the helicopter and quickly climbs out of the harness. the winch operator throws it back across the water where beck grabs the harness.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{c'mon, jones!}
<A>__{jones reaches out his hand. he is almost there when}
<B>__{suddenly rising out of the water behind them is the}
<A>__{sixpack bowman creature in all its hideous glory! huge and gruesome, its long teeth glimmer in the light. it goes for}
<B>__{beck but jones moves between them.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{jonesy, no!}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{get out of here, becky!}
<A>__{the creature grabs jones and pulls him violently under. beck watches horrified as his friend disappears. numbed he clips the rescue harness around him when suddenly, we see a boiling of water where jones disappeared...bubbles rising...and then jones' bloody and tattered life vest bobs to the surface several feet away from beck. beck reaches out for it just as the creature appears again! it turns and focuses on beck. beck keeps going for the life vest as the creature starts for him.}
<B>__{on helicopter}
<A>__{the winch operator and willie watch in horror as the creature bears down on beck.}
<C>__{winch operator}
<D>__{is he in the harness!}
<A>__{close on jones' tattered vest beck reaches it. his fingers wrap around the bicycle pump like, seismic tool in jones' vest pocket. the creature is right on top of him! chunk, chunk, beck cocks it like a pump shotgun as tentacles rise wickedly out of the water and wrap around beck's body in a death grip. it's horrible mouth starts to open.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{c'mon, motherfucker open up!}
<A>__{the creature's mouth widens and as it starts to strike beck thrusts the seismic tool into its gaping maw and is suddenly pulled from behind out of the creature's grasp! the rescue cable is taut! the helicopter is taking off! beck's pov rising shot. beck rises suddenly out of the water, the creature growing instantly smaller below him until boom! the seismic device explodes in the sixpack bowman creature, blowing it to bits across the ocean surface! the shock wave sends the helicopter banking off toward the ship with beck safely attached by cable below it. the winch operator pulls him in.}
<L>__{exterior coast guard ship later}
<A>__{beck, dressed now in crisp white clothes, stands on deck of the ship. he glances occasionally at a door nearby marked infirmary, then looks up as the captain approaches and shakes his hand.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{mr. beck, i understand you passed your physical with flying colors. and ms. williams?}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{i don't know yet, she's still in there.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{well, you'll be glad to know you have a friend onboard.}
<A>__{beck looks up surprised as suddenly martin joins them.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(excitedly)}
<D>__{beck! i told them you'd make it. no one back at transocean believed me, but i never gave up on you once.}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{so, how are you feeling?}
<A>__{beck looks at martin for an instant then hauls off and in one incredibly smooth punch knocks martin on his can across the deck.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{better...a lot better.}
<A>__{just then the door to the infirmary opens and willie appears with a new outfit on. smiles at beck.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{i'm fine!}
<A>__{beck lets out a slight sigh of relief as a steward approaches with a tray of whole cooked fish, hideous looking things like anglers, lobsters, crabs...miniature leviathan. the sight is almost too intense for beck and willie. the captain notices.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{i thought we might have some wonderful seafood. but, if there's something else you'd rather have...}
<A>__{willie stares at the tray of seafood uneasily then looks at the captain and smiles.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{how about a burger and fries?}
<A>__{she and beck laugh as they sit at a finely set table on the deck with the captain. as we pull back the ship becomes smaller and smaller in the distance and we are at the}
<B>__{surface of the ocean}
<A>__{riding the swells, rising and falling before slipping beneath the waves and descending again into the cold depths.}
