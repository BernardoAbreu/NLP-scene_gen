<A>__{the rain has eased off. a local priest with two boy acolytes is standing beside an open communal grave. mozart's body is lifted out of the cheap pine box in a sack. we see that the grave contains twenty other such sacks. the gravedigger throws the one containing mozart amongst the others. an assistant pours quicklime over the whole pile of them. the acolytes swing their censers.}
