<L>__{exterior donna irving's house day}
<A>__{a generic ranch home standing all alone in the middle of nothing. there's a pool out back and a chain link fence hugging the property. no landscaping. dull, but clean. a few bottles of spring water wait by the door. the hyundai pulls into the driveway and stops. erin gets out. as she heads up to the door, her spike heels sink into the dirt. she rings the bell. it has a melody chime. donna irving opens the door. she's 35, petite, with a scrappy, high strung manner. she's wearing tight jeans, and her dark curls are piled on top of her head.}
