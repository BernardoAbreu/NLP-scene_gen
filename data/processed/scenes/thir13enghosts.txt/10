<A>__{suddenly, a squeal of metal as something invisible reaches through the grill of the car and grabs the team member by the waist. he screams as he is folded over, backwards, and yanked into the grill of the car. rafkin rushes toward him. we hear bones break as the team member screams. the breaker, unseen on the far side of the heap of cars, yanks on his victim, over and over, smashing the team member's chin against the grill, trying to pull him through. rafkin does the best he can to pull the man free, but it seems hopeless. the man screams and screams. abruptly, rafkin's efforts seem, at last, to work. with a mighty tug, he tumbles back and falls to the ground. looks down and sees that he holds only the man's foot. the wall of cars begins to move before rafkin. he leaps just as the wall comes crashing down. rafkin scrambles and runs full bore back the way he came. he looks back, speaks into his mike:}
