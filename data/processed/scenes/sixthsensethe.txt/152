<L>__{exterior home afternoon}
<A>__{a modest home sits on a corner. its small lawn, groomed carefully. rows of parked cars spill out from the driveway onto the streets. people in suits and dark dresses move somberly in and out of the front door of the home. cole and malcolm join the visitors as they walk slowly towards the doors. a frail, little girl about four years of age sits in a dark dress on the swings in front of the house. visitors say hello to her as they pass. she doesn't say anything back.}
