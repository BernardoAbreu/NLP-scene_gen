<A>__{malcolm, pauline, margot, claude and ingrid sit with a homosexual couple, alan, 40's, and toby, 30's, and their son, bruce, 8, at an old wooden table eating crab, salad and soup. part of alan's face is paralyzed.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{alan rolled over in bed and looked at me and he said i can't feel my face. it took three doctors before we knew it was bells palsy.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{they say a brush of wind can do it.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{feeling is slowly coming back.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{we're all getting older... which is terrible i don't care how universal it is. i can't remember names anymore.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{i have that. i blank out on certain words now too. like the other day, i couldn't remember the word for...}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i've forgotten it again. the stuff in wine. sediment! that was it.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i know that. i was talking more about not remembering who was the bassist for motley crue.}
<A>__{malcolm lights up a cigarette. he offers one to claude who shakes his head, no.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{ingrid, why don't you show claude and bruce the game trunk.}
<C>__{ingrid}

<A>__{we follow the kids inside. we hear in the background:}
<C>__{margot}
