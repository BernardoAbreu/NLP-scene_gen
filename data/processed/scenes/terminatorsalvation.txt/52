<A>__{the planes are nearing a river, bordered by sickly trees. on the far banks, even from above, we see ominous military fortifications concrete bunkers, anti aircraft guns, etc. marcus meanwhile, is trying to climb up the dead harvester, avoid the engine blast and find a handhold on the transport. the a 10 that shot down the h k comes around for another pass at the transport, but anti aircraft guns at the far side of the river let out a volley of blue plasma fire. the bursts arc toward the a 10, which swerves and climbs, but plasma fire destroys a wing, the a 10 spins out of control. the other a 10 breaks off its dogfight with its h k and speeds away from the river. marcus is tantalizingly close to the upper lip of the transport, he reaches out and the fried harvester suddenly dislodges from the engine pod, taking marcus with it, into freefall. with marcus, plummeting downward toward earth, a hundred feet below, the transport continuing on its way above, crossing the river. marcus' pov the ground and treetops getting closer. at the last moment, his continuing forward momentum takes him over the river and marcus and the dead harvester hit the water, hard, vanishing below the surface with enormous splashes. the surviving h k and the transport continue across the river into skynet territory, vanishing in the distance. camera moves to find a parachute, drifting earthward on the unfortified side of the river.}
