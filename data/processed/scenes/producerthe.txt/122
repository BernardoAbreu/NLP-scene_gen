<T>__{fade out: fade in:}
<B>__{. darkened cellar of theatre. we see the faint glow of a shielded lamp at the end of a tunnel. as the camera}
<A>__{moves through tunnel closer and closer to the light, we make}
<B>__{out the shadowy forms of three men.}
<A>__{camera dollies in to reveal bialystock, bloom and liebkind. bloom is holding a miner's lamp. liebkind is trying brick}
<B>__{loose from wall. bialystock is consulting map. brick comes loose. liebkind removes it.}
<C>__{liebkind}
<P>__{(the surgeon at work)}
<D>__{dynamite.}
<A>__{bloom slaps a neatly taped bundle of dynamite into liebkind's}

<C>__{liebkind}
<D>__{fuse cap.}
<B>__{bialystock reaches into his pocket and hands him a fuse cap. liebkind puts cap in place.}

<C>__{liebkind}
<D>__{thank you.}
<B>__{liebkind ties fuse in place.}
<C>__{liebkind}
<D>__{gut. now for the master connection.}
<B>__{camera follows them as they move back through the tunnel. liebkind trails fuse from spool. they finally emerge into an open area of cellar directly beneath the stage.}
<C>__{liebkind}
<D>__{gut. now vhere's the other fuse?}
<A>__{bloom raises his lamp, revealing a similar tunnel on the}
<B>__{other side of the cellar.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{there it is.}
<A>__{camera insert: close up similar fuse protruding from second}
<B>__{tunnel. back to scene.}

<C>__{liebkind}
<D>__{oh, ve come vit you. all for one and all in the light.}
<B>__{the three of them gingerly tiptoe over to second tunnel entrance. bloom picks up the fuse. they tiptoe back. bloom hands fuse to liebkind.}
<A>__{liebkind reaches into his knapsack, takes out little black}
<B>__{metal box with two terminal caps at either end and sets it down on cellar floor.}
<C>__{liebkind}
<D>__{now ve take the two fuse leads, attach them to the terminals of the conductor and ve're in business.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{you mean out of business. heh, heh.}
<B>__{liebkind begins fiddling with the fuse leads and terminals.}

<D>__{vait a minute. vait a minute. male to male? male to female? female to male? female to female? vait a minute. in people, male to female. but electricity is strange. it's male to male.}
<B>__{he quickly finishes the connection.}
<C>__{liebkind}
<D>__{sehr gut.}
<P>__{(to bialystock)}
<D>__{slow fuse, please.}
<B>__{bialystock reaches into his pocket and hands liebkind a roll of fuse.}
<C>__{liebkind}
<D>__{thank you.}
<B>__{he begins tying slow fuse to conductor.}
<C>__{liebkind}
<P>__{(as he works)}
<D>__{now ve take the slow fuse. tie one end to the master connection and the other ve attach to the detonator.}
<B>__{he finishes connections.}
<C>__{liebkind}
<D>__{come, ve go to the detonator.}
<B>__{they begin to move back as liebkind slowly spools out fuse. they start up the stairs.}
<C>__{liebkind}
<D>__{vait a minute. are you sure this is slow fuse? it feels like qvick fuse.}
<P>__{(to bloom)}
<D>__{shine your light on it.}
<B>__{bloom shines light on fuse.}
<C>__{liebkind}
<D>__{i don't know. i don't know. the markings are so similar. qvick fuse or slow fuse?}
<B>__{liebkind takes a wooden match out of his pocket.}
<C>__{liebkind}
<D>__{i must find out. it is critical.}
<A>__{he strikes the match and lights the fuse. whoosh! it}
<B>__{ignites. the sparks rush toward the master connection. liebkind charges down the stairs and chases after the quick}
<A>__{burning fuse for all he's worth. he catches up with it just}
<B>__{before it reaches the master connection and quickly stamps it out.}
<C>__{liebkind}
<D>__{let's face it. that was dumb.}
<B>__{he trots back.}
<C>__{liebkind}

<D>__{we assumed that.}
<B>__{liebkind reaches into his pocket and shows them a roll of fuse.}
<C>__{liebkind}
<D>__{here. you see. this is the slow fuse. it is much wider. it has more resistance, more density. therefore, it burns slower.}
<C>__{bialystock}
<D>__{you mean you had the slow fuse in your pocket all the time and you forgot to put it on?}
<C>__{liebkind}
<D>__{yes. amazing isn't it?}
