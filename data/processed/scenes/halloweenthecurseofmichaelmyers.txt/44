<L>__{interior pickup}
<A>__{something heavy is thrown from the back of the van right through the windshield! glass explodes! jamie screams, hands going up instinctively to protect her face. swerving wildly out of control. she looks to see a sprawling, mutilated corpse on top of her. wide, cold, lifeless eyes mary!}

<D>__{no!!!}
<L>__{exterior pumpkin patch (continuous)}
<A>__{the pickup rockets at breakneck speed toward the edge of the field. suddenly jamie's p.o.v. the shape stands in the field, tall and unmoving, white mask glowing hideously in the rush of oncoming headlights.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{the truck plows into the shape, dragging it under, slamming headlong into the trunk of a huge oak tree. everything is abruptly and shockingly silent. like a phantom in the night, the van is gone. the shape nowhere to be seen. steam billows from the pickup, engine ticking, a heap of shattered glass and mangled steel. pinned against the base of the tree is a shape in human form a scarecrow! move in on jamie, face down against the steering wheel. coughing on the noxious fumes, she stirs back to life. slowly, painfully, she shoulders the door. falls onto the ground. a spark ignites. blinding flash as the gas tank explodes, setting the truck ablaze. jamie turns, her face a frozen rictus of horror. debris rains down on her. suddenly a grim shadow rises from the field. the shape wielding an enormous butcher knife! jamie rolls onto her back, screaming.}

<D>__{no no!!!}
<A>__{suddenly the knife plunges down and lands with a terrible thud.}
