<L>__{exterior. nockmaar castle day}
<A>__{under gloomy sky a huge fortress looms on a volcanic mountainside. from within we hear the agonizing scream of a woman giving birth.}
<L>__{interior. nockmaar castle day}
<A>__{the scream continues as we move through the grim corri dors of the castle toward stairs leading down to a dungeon.}
<L>__{interior. dungeon day}
<A>__{silhouetted in sadows, three nockmaar minions stand guard. in a jail cell, sex fully pregnant women watch from behind iron bars. the screaming stops. there's a moment of silence. as we move into another jail cell we hear a slap and the first cry of a newborn baby. in the cell a black robed druid watches intensely as ethna, a midwife, leans over the mother and wraps the baby in swaddling.}
<C>__{druid}
<D>__{is it a girl?}
<C>__{ethna}
<D>__{it is a girl.}
<C>__{druid}
<D>__{show me its arm.}
<A>__{ethna peels back the swaddling. on the baby's arm is a small marking.}
<C>__{druid}
<D>__{it's true then. i must tell queen bavmorda.}
<A>__{with great urgency the druid hurries up the dungeon stairs. ethna gently places the baby on the mother's breast. the mother comforst the baby lovingly until it stops crying. then she reaches out and clasps the midwife's wrist.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{ethna, please. help me. they're going to kill my baby.}
<A>__{ethna nervously looks out at the guards, then shakes her head at the mother.}
<C>__{ethna}
<D>__{they'll kill you.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{please save my baby.}
<A>__{ethna hesitates. then decides. she quickly wraps to gether some rags and gives them to the mother.}
<C>__{ethna}
<D>__{pretend this is the child.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{thank you, ethna. thank you.}
<A>__{the mother kisses her baby and hands it to ethna, who hides the baby inside the basket of rags. ethna car ries the basket past the guards and up the stairs. the mother lies back and sighs with relief. then she hears clinking bootsteps and her eyes widen with fear. queen bavmorda sweeps down the dungeon stairs, her black robes flowing behind her. the druid hurries alongside.}
<C>__{bavmorda}
<D>__{we will start the ritual at dusk. you're certain this is the one?}
<C>__{druid}
<D>__{it bears the markings.}
<C>__{bavmorda}
<D>__{i must see for myself! just as the omen foretold!}
<A>__{the guards fearfully move aside as bavmorda enters the cell.}
<C>__{bavmorda}
<D>__{so. you were the one.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{yes. but nothing you can do will stop the prophecy.}
<C>__{bavmorda}
<D>__{this child will have no power over me....}
<A>__{bavmorda grabs the rags away from the mother and anxi ously tears them apart.}
<C>__{bavmorda}
<P>__{(furiously)}
<D>__{where's the baby!}
<A>__{one of the guards looks up the stairs.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{the midwife!}
<A>__{bavmorda flies into a rage.}
<C>__{bavmorda}
<D>__{find that baby! use the dogs! sorsha!}
<A>__{two guards draw swords and charge upstairs. bavmorda grabs the third guard and nods toward the mother.}
<C>__{bavmorda}
<D>__{kill her.}
<A>__{bavmorda storms away with the druid. we see the shadow of the guard move over the terrified mother. war drums begin to beat out an alarm.}
<L>__{exterior snowy mountainside day}
<A>__{titles begin. the midwife hurries through swirling show, clutching the baby.}
<L>__{exterior village day}
<A>__{nockmaar troops on horseback charge into a desolate village, driving ferocious death dogs into huts, violently searching for the baby. the oppressed, poor villagers are yanked into the street. some of them are beaten. one is killed. the midwife hides behind a hut, still holding the baby, then runs away from the village.}
<L>__{exterior grassland day}
<A>__{ethna treks across an open grass field.}
<L>__{exterior woods night}
<A>__{she huddles by a fire, exhausted and hungry, her clothes filthy and torn, and she rocks the crying baby. she hears dogs howling in the distance. she clutches the baby, kicks out the fire, and runs.}
<L>__{exterior ocean cliffside day}
<A>__{she scrambles over rocks on a windswept coastline.}
<L>__{exterior forest dawn}
<A>__{ethna runs desperately for her life. chasing her are two vicious death dogs. she scrambles across a shallow river. she claws at rock and tears away sticks and driftwood matted together with weeds. into this she places the baby and sets it afloat downstream.}
<C>__{death dog}
<D>__{bordak!}
<A>__{the dogs lunge from the woods and splash across the river. the midwife claws her way up a steep bank, lur ing the dogs. as they attack her:}
<C>__{midwife}
<D>__{i don't have her! no! no!}
<A>__{she grabs a stick and tries to defend herself, thrash ing at the snarling dogs. from the baby's view, as it floats down the river, we see the dogs kill the midwife beyond the distant trees.}
<L>__{exterior downriver day montage}
<A>__{the little raft of sticks swirls precariously in the current. it glances off jutting rocks, tumbles over rapids, and scrapes under overhanging trees.}
<L>__{exterior riverbank day}
<A>__{at last the raft catches in some weeks, almost dumping the baby.}
<B>__{title sequence ends}
<A>__{suddenly we hear rustling leaves, possibly another death dog. then we hear giggling. two children, ranon and mims, watch in amazement from the riverbank.}
<L>__{exterior ufgood farm day}
<A>__{holding onto a plow, willow ufgood struggles behind a huge hog. from a heavy sack slung over his shoulder he tosses seeds.}
<C>__{ranon}
<D>__{dada! we found something in the river!}
<A>__{willow beams with joy as his son and daughter race to ward him. they grab his sleeves and tug him away from his plow.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i can't run off and play with you now. i've got work to do. ranon mims but dada, you gotta see it! hurry!}
<A>__{willow drops his sack of seeds. the ugly hog glares at him like a guilty conscience. the children squeal with excitement as their father runs toward the river with them.}
<L>__{exterior riverbank day}
<A>__{we see willow from the baby's view. his eyes pop open. he quickly backs his children away.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{back! don't go near it. we don't know where it's been. it could be diseased.}
<C>__{mims}
<D>__{it's a baby!}
<C>__{ranon}
<D>__{it's not a nelwyn baby.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{no, it's too big to be a nelwyn baby. it looks like a daikini...}
<C>__{mims}
<D>__{ooh, it's so cute...}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{mims! get back here! it might bite you.}
<A>__{willow drags mims away. then the baby starts crying.}
<C>__{ranon}
<D>__{can't we keep it, dada?}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{absolutely not.}
<C>__{burglekutt}
<D>__{ufgood! willow ufgood!}
<A>__{willow, in a sudden panic, sees burglekutt in the dis tance. he splashes into the river, grabs the raft, plunks it on the bank and tries to hush the crying baby.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{shhh, shhh! it's the prefect that's all i need. mims, ranon, keep this thing hidden...}
<L>__{exterior ufgood farm day}
<A>__{burglekutt's beady eyes spot willow making a mad dash for his plow. swinging his fat stomach, he angrily points his walking stick and goes after him.}
<C>__{kiaya}
<D>__{mr. burglekutt! he hasn't done anything wrong!}
<A>__{willow's wife kiaya chases burglekutt across the field, her beautiful long hair flowing behind her. willow quickly gets behind his plow like he's been there all day.}
<C>__{burglekutt}
<D>__{ufgood! what do you think you're doing! i tell the planting seeds in this village.}
<C>__{kiaya}
<D>__{i told him we didn't steal it, wil low.}
<A>__{burglekutt furiously scoops a handful of seeds out of willow's sack and shakes them under willow's nose.}
<C>__{burglekutt}
<D>__{you haven't paid your debts. where did you get these seeds?}
<A>__{with pride, willow puts his arm around his wife.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{in the forest. my family's been gathering them since last fall. there's no law against that, bur glekutt.}
<A>__{suddenly the children laugh in the distance.}
<C>__{kiaya}
<D>__{willow! you left the children alone by the river??}
<A>__{in alarm she runs off before willow can stop her. bur glekutt sweeps the horizon with his walking stick.}
<C>__{burglekutt}
<D>__{too late, ufgood. you'll never get your planting done before the rains start. you're gonna lose this land.}
<A>__{he raises the seeds high above his head, then smashes them down at willow's boots. he waddles away toward two of his men who wait by the road. then: kiaya shrieks from the river. burglekutt stops in his tracks and shakes his head as if to say "the whole family's crazy." off he trudges. willow watches and waits. then runs as fast as he can to the river.}
<L>__{exterior river day}
<A>__{kiaya cradles the baby in her arms. willow runs up, and with patriarchal authority, puts his fists on his hips.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{absolutely, under no condition, is anyone in this family going to fall in love with that baby.}
<A>__{they all fall in love as he speaks. the children fol low kiaya up on the bank, walking right past willow.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{kiaya! we can't keep that baby. mims, ranon. hey! i will not be ignored!}
<A>__{ignored, willow huffs after them across his unplowed field.}
<L>__{interior ufgood house day}
<A>__{willow nervously paces as kiaya pours water in a wood tub and the children entertain the naked baby with sticks and brightly colored cloths, apparatus for a magic trick.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{this is bad. if we're caught with that little daikini it'll be the end of us. careful, ranon, i need that for the festival.}
<P>__{(indicates magic cloth)}
<D>__{kiaya, what are we going to do?}
<C>__{kiaya}
<D>__{we're gonna give this baby a bath.}
<A>__{the baby squeals with joy as kiaya lifts her into the bath.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{burglekutt's right. there's not enough time to finish plowing. we'll lose everything and i will end up working in the mines.}
<A>__{he shudders at the thought.}
<C>__{kiaya}
<D>__{willow, do you think we should take her to the village council?}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{no, no! they'll think it's a bad omen. there'll be a flood or a drought or a plague and everybody'll blame me for it!}
<C>__{ranon}
<D>__{look. what's that?}
<A>__{willow leans forward. on the baby's shoulder is a small branded scar in a circular design. it only adds to willow's fears.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i don't know. this is trouble. i will talk to the high aldwin about it tomorrow at the festival.}
<A>__{the baby kicks and splashes and giggles in the bath.}
<L>__{exterior nelwyn village day}
<A>__{the raucous band plays as nelwyns dance and celebrate amid brochs and wheelhouses garlanded with flowers. a crowd cheers wildly as miners battle farmers in a tug of war, finally yanking the farmers face first into a puddle of mud. on a stage a harlequin dances delight fully. while on a raised platform the five members of the village council sit and observe, mildly amused. the head councilman is burglekutt. the we see willow on another stage. he flourishes his colorful sticks and cloths. in the audience we notice his friend meegosh, who wears a miner's apron, rooting willow on.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{and now! for our final amazing bit of magic, i will make an entire pig completely disappear!}
<A>__{meegosh applauds as mims and ranon trot out lugging a tiny baby pig in a crate. as willow takes the pig out it bites his hand and gets away. willow tackles and squashes it. the crowd laughs and half of them leave, and meegosh covers his face. mims and ranon rapidly wave a bright blanket. willow cleverly whips the pig under his legs and behind his back and suddenly it's gone! impresse, the crowd gasps. then the pig squeals and dashes through willow's legs and leaps off the stage.}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{aaww! booo! sssss!}
<A>__{burglekutt and the council shake their heads as willow, embarassed, picks up his things. meegosh trots up with the pig under his arm.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{meegosh, i'm in trouble.}
<C>__{meegosh}
<D>__{hey, it wasn't that bad. you need a better pig, that's all.}
<A>__{but as they walk past the village council, and bur glekutt sneers down at willow, meegosh catches on.}
<C>__{meegosh}
<D>__{now burglekutt's got you in the squeeze. soon you'll be down in the mines like me.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{mining. i hate closed in spaces. that's the last thing i'd ever do.}
<P>__{(he shudders)}
<D>__{i gotta get my crop planted.}
<C>__{meegosh}
<D>__{you know i will help you as much as i can, willow.}
<A>__{the village council members stand up respectfully as the wise old high aldwin hobbles through the adoring crowd. mims and ranon rush up to willow with several other children who are eating candy.}
<C>__{mims}
<D>__{dada, can we get treacle candy? can we, can we? please?}
<C>__{willow}
<P>__{(preoccupied)}
<D>__{meegosh, can you watch the chil dren? i gotta talk to the high aldwin.}
<C>__{meegosh}
<P>__{(truly amazed)}
<D>__{the high aldwin?? why?}
<A>__{but willow has already wandered into the crowd, leaving meegosh with a dozen sugar charged children and a pig. willow desperately pushes past people and finally reaches the high aldwin.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{sir! i have to talk to you.}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{not today, willow.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{it's a matter of great importance to me!}
<A>__{burglekutt stares angrily from his platform. slightly annoyed, the high aldwin stops and places his hand on willow's shoulder.}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{intuition, willow remember? i know you're eager to be my appren tice, willow. but today is the spring festival.}
<A>__{suddenly a walking stick is pointed at willow's nose.}
<C>__{burglekutt}
<D>__{apprentice? to the high aldwin!! willow ufgood???}
<A>__{his belly shakes as he howls with laughter, encouraging his councilmen to join in. willow shrinks away, em barassed. then a terrified shriek shatters the festivity. music stops and people grab their children and run for their lives. a death dog rips a trail of destruction through the village. meegosh holds onto ranon and mims. but when mims sees willow she runs right out into the open. willow charges twoard her, tackling her and rolling away from the beast's claws.}
<C>__{death dog}
<D>__{bordak! bordak!}
<A>__{a loud war cry distracts the dog. vohnkar, the toughest warrior in the village, leads a charging army of miners and farmers wielding shovels and picks. wil low and meegosh grab sticks. the nelwyns battle the death dog. at last, vohnkar drives a spear through its chest and it dies hideously.}
<C>__{meegosh}
<D>__{what was it looking for?}
<C>__{a villager}
<D>__{it said "bordak"! what does it mean?}
<C>__{councilman}
<P>__{(scholarly)}
<D>__{baby! it means baby! it was look ing for somebody's baby!}
<A>__{mothers grab their children, people look around the wrecked village in terror. there's a haunting silence.}
<C>__{mims}
<D>__{mommy?}
<A>__{suddenly alarmed, willow races towrd his distant farm, his children hurrying behind.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{kiaya! kiaya!}
<L>__{interior ufgood house day}
<A>__{willow bursts in and finds kiaya calmly feeding the baby. relieved, he throws his arms around her.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{we can't keep this baby, kiaya. we must take her to the council.}
<A>__{the children run in and they all huddle together, cher ishing their precious lives.}
<L>__{interior council building day}
<A>__{arguing villagers pack the church shaped room to the open door at the back and into the balconies above. the councilmen sit on a platform at the front, with the high aldwin seated in a special chair above them. tak ing charge, burglekutt stands and pounds the floor with his walking stick.}
<C>__{burglekutt}
<D>__{an evil beast from the outer world has invaded our peaceful village, looking for a baby!}
<A>__{this only adds to the frenzy.}
<C>__{a villager}
<D>__{it's a sign! an omen!}
<C>__{another villager}
<D>__{our crops will die!}
<C>__{burglekutt}
<D>__{silence! one beast we can kill. but there may be more! and they won't give up their search till they've found what they're looking for!}
<C>__{meegosh}
<D>__{whose baby is it!}
<C>__{other villagers}
<D>__{who's to blame for this!}
<A>__{amid the chaos the high aldwin slowly stands up. as if he senses something, he looks over the crowd toward the back. at the back door, holding the baby, willow tries to push his way through the jostling crowd. the high aldwin raises his hand. it flashes magically. he points as he speaks:}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{willow ufgood! come before me!}
<A>__{the crowd stands apart as willow walks the length of the room. kiaya and the children follow part way and then stand aside next to meegosh. burglekutt simmers as willow approaches the platform.}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{earlier today you tried to tell me something, willow.}
<C>__{willow}
<P>__{(bows his head)}
<D>__{my family found this baby in the river, high aldwin.}
<A>__{the crowd stirs but the high aldwin silences them with a simple gesture. he gazes down at the baby mysteri ously.}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{a daikini child...}
<P>__{(his eyes close)}
<D>__{...of some importance, i feel...}
<C>__{burglekutt}
<D>__{that's what the beasts want! give it back!}
<A>__{the crowd rumbles, many agree.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{they'll kill her! we can't let this baby die!}
<C>__{burglekutt}
<D>__{what do we care!}
<A>__{burglekutt whips up the shouting crowd. the high aldwin raises his hands, feeling the air above him. almost in a trance:}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{...importance...yes...this child is special...}
<C>__{councilman}
<D>__{what should we do?}
<A>__{instantly, the high aldwin drops his arms and opens his eyes.}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{this child must be taken beyond the boundaries of our village. all the way to the daikini crossroads.}
<A>__{the room goes silent.}
<C>__{a villager}
<D>__{who will do that?}
<C>__{several villagers}
<D>__{vohnkar! vohnkar!}
<A>__{vohnkar the warrior elbows his way to the front and pounds his chest once with his fist.}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{the outer world is dangerous and corrupt, vohnkar. and this baby is hunted by blood hungry beasts. are you willing to sacrifice your life?}
<A>__{brave vohnkar swallows and shifts his weight doubtful ly.}
<C>__{vohnkar}
<D>__{if i go, who'll defend you if other beasts attack?}
<A>__{the crowd rumbles and shouts, and vohnkar mops his brow and scuttles away from the platform.}
<C>__{burglekutt}
<D>__{he's right! it seems only fair that the man to take this baby to the crossroads...}
<P>__{(walking stick up)}
<D>__{...be the very man who plucked it...}
<P>__{(walking stick down)}
<D>__{...out of the river!}
<A>__{all eyes turn to willow. kiaya gasps and meegosh holds her back.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i can't do it! i haven't put my crop in!}
<C>__{a councilman}
<D>__{you caused this trouble. you found the baby...you get rid of it!}
<C>__{burglekutt}
<D>__{i nominate willow ufgood!}
<A>__{the crowd cheers wildly. the high aldwin steps forward to the edge of the platform. with a flourish he waves his arms.}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{i will consult the bones!}
<A>__{something rattles as he shakes his cupped hands. the crowd jumps away. the high aldwin scatters small bones across the floor below him. he leans down and studies the bones. willow looks at kiaya, who is worried and afraid. the high aldwin speaks softly to him:}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{the bones tell me nothing.}
<P>__{(he eyes willow)}
<D>__{but i must make a decision. is there love in your heart for this child?}
<A>__{willow hesitates. he looks at the baby.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{the high aldwin bolts straight up, broadcasting:}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{the bones have spoken! willow? the security of this village depends on you!}
<A>__{the people shout and cheer and applaud and begin to leave. kiaya and meegosh and the children push their way toward willow, who stands there staring at the baby.}
<L>__{interior ufgood house night}
<A>__{kiaya's hair hangs down her back in a long tight braid. near the fire she packs supplies into a travel sack. on the other side of the fire, willow diapers the baby. the house is quiet.}
<C>__{mims}
<D>__{dada?}
<A>__{willow sets the baby down. he goes around an opne wall an sits on his daughter's bed, straightening her blank ets and toys.}
<C>__{mims}
<D>__{watch out for brownies, dada.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i will, mims. goodnight.}
<A>__{he smiles and kisses her. then crosses over to ranon's bed.}
<C>__{ranon}
<D>__{dada, what's a daikini?}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{daikinis are giant people who live far far away.}
<C>__{ranon}
<D>__{are you scared?}
<A>__{willow shrugs. ranon sits up in bed.}
<C>__{ranon}
<D>__{i could be you rguard! i could carry your spear!}
<C>__{willow}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{what a great son you are, ranon. i wish i could take you with me. now go to sleep...}
<A>__{ranon slides down under his blankets. willow kisses him, looks at him a moment, then quietly withdraws to ward the fire.}
<L>__{exterior sacred hill sunrise}
<A>__{the silhouette of a distant hill with druid stones on top. carrying the baby, willow climbs the hill with his fami ly. he wears a papoose rig, supply pack, and a dagger. he hands the baby to kiaya, then walks through the towering stones. the high aldwin solemnly looks out at the distant forest.}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{now, you know where you're going?}
<P>__{(willow shakes his head)}
<D>__{down there, through those trees, follow the river. you'll know the crossroads by a big daikini struc ture. willow, this is serious business. don't waste any time, the outer world is no place for a nelwyn. give the baby to the first daikini you see, then hurry home as fast as you can.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{if i'm not strong enough to be your apprentice, how can i do this?}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{you're strong enough. but you're going to need courage, willow.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{i don't want courage. i don't want to be a warrior. all i've ever wanted was to do magic, real magic, like you!}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{real magic, willow, is simply the art of controlling the reality of others. you lack faith in your self. you must learn to trust your intuition.}
<A>__{the high aldwin picks up a rock. with intense concen tration he squeezes it in his outstretched hand. then throws it in the air. it changes into a bird and flies away.}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{go in the direction the bird is flying.}
<C>__{willow}
<P>__{(amazed)}
<D>__{oh, if i could do that i'd i'd turn burglekutt into a toad!}
<C>__{high aldwin}
<D>__{waste magic on revenge? you have much to learn, willow...}
<A>__{the high aldwin touches willow's shoulder and turns away. the children are playing tag among the stones. willow hugs them. kiaya places the baby in the papoose.}
<C>__{kiaya}
<D>__{willow, we've never been apart. i miss you already. take this. it will bring you luck.}
<A>__{kiaya, whose head is covered with a kerchief, places a braided necklace on her own hair around willow's neck.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{you cut your hair, kiaya?}
<A>__{he kisses her. the adjusts the papoose and heads off down the hill. the others wave goodbye sadly.}
<C>__{kiaya}
<D>__{willow!!}
<A>__{kiaya rushes down the hill and passionately throws her arms around willow, tears in her eyes. at last they break apart, and willow begins the journey.}
<L>__{exterior woods day montage}
<A>__{willow hikes through strange and wondrous terrain, amazed and frightened. animals rustle in the brush and he stumbles into a thistle patch, jumping out picking burrs off his legs. he hides from a fierce bear. the bear sees him and runs away. willow hurries along, shifting the papoose, getting used to the baby's weight.}
<L>__{exterior road evening}
<A>__{the baby is fussing hungrily. willow impetuously digs a bladder of goat's milk from his sack and struggles to feed her. then he hears something. sensing danger, he clutches the baby and runs down a nearby riverbank. he hides under a bridge. nockmaar soldiers on horseback thunder toward the bridge, led by the knight sorsha whose face is hidden under a black helmet and visor. in the other direction willow sees a lieutenant and two death dogs. they all meet on the bridge. the hideous soldiers are part hu man, part beast.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{we've patrolled the hills. this is where they killed the nursemaid.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{she must have done something with the child. widen the search!}

<A>__{an ugly troll snarls up behind willow. they all scream and race for the other side. another troll pops up to meet them. the trolls slink along like possums. the brownies dive through a hole in the hollow tree trunk. the elves, meanwhile, flint start a fire at their end of the tree. one troll claws at the brownies inside the trunk while the other chases willow across gangling branches. then the baby falls out of the papoose! she tumbles and catches on a low branch and willow races the troll and grabs her just before she plummets into the gorge. one troll catches rool but can't then get his claw out of the trunk. the brownies finally excape. the tree burns and breaks, dangling over the gorge by its roots. a troll howls as he falls to his death. the other scrambles up the tree and grabs willow's foot. willow's boot slips off and down goes the second troll. flames lick at willow as he at last hauls himself to safety, just as the roots snap and the blazing tree goes crashing down in the gorge.}

<A>__{wonder struck, willow walks into a clearing where colorful night flowers bloom. he lowers himself onto an enormous toadstool, testing it with his hand. other brownies stand watching, like courtiers. the tiny fairies fly up to willow's face and giggle: they look like five year old girls, full of mischief and fun. suddenly a strange light begins to throb behind the trees, peircing the forest with helter skelter beams. willow throws up his arms as the bright light stings his eyes.}

<D>__{heeyah! heeyah!}
<A>__{then there's a terrible howl right beside willow. the death dog is leaping alongside the wagon, gnashing and trying to board. willow yanks the reins and swerves the wagon into the dog, which yelps furiously. in the back, madmartigan and the minion are thrown by the swerving jolt.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{oh no!}
<A>__{up ahead willow sees an exposed tree root in the road. the wagon is headed straight for it! the wheel hits the root hard and willow is dumped onto the wagon floor and very nearly goes overboard. in the back, madmartigan and the minion keep fighting as the wagon clatter along out of control. the death dog catches up again and this time spring aboard.}
