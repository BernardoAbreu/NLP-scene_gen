<L>__{interior barn angle past book}
<A>__{beyond book, now at the top of the ladder, we see fergie easing into the barn. book pulls himself up, crawls behind the wall of the mule stalls, opens gate, eases in beside luke, urgently whispering and patting the animal to calm him. he gets to the animal's head, crouches, strokes luke's nose. the mule's huge flanks quiver, his nostril's and eyes widen, but he makes no untoward sound. book closes the gate.}
<B>__{back to fergie}
<A>__{he comes on warily, muzzle first, eyes darting. dollying with him as he reaches the first mule's stall, opens the gate. an edgy mule turns, eyes him, shuffles nervously. fergie backs off, moves on.}
<B>__{book}
<A>__{as he listens, tenses, hearing fergie's feet in the fresh straw. book eases back alongside luke, waits.}
<B>__{back to fergie}
<A>__{as he approaches luke's stall, reaches for the gate latch.}
<B>__{book flash cut}
<A>__{as the gate swings open, book shouts and gives luke a whack on the back. the mule's pent up nerves and feral energy explode in an horrendous scream.}
<B>__{fergie}
<A>__{bowled backwards by the rearing animal as the gate flies open, involuntarily firing, suddenly finding himself under the lethal hooves of a twelve hundred pound beast. staggering backwards, he screams, fires again, the load striking the mule in its heaving chest as a flailing hoof smashes into fergie's head and the other hoof snaps his shotgun in half like a matchstick.}
<B>__{book}
<A>__{as he slips out of the stall, ducks toward the rear of the barn.}
<B>__{fergie}
<A>__{fallen, skull smashed... and now the dying luke's legs buckle and he collapses atop fergie.}
