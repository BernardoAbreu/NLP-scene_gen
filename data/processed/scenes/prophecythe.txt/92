<L>__{interior thomas's car}
<A>__{katherine and thomas drive along in silence. finally,}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{in those... visions... did you ever see... god?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{me either.}
<L>__{interior mary's grandmother's trailer}
<A>__{katherine and thomas open the trailer door and enter cautiously.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{mary?}
<A>__{thomas looks out the window and notices for the first time, parked behind the trailer, gabriel's rambler. he immediately pulls out his pistol, runs for the closed door at the end of the hall and kicks it in. the door flies open, revealing gabriel sitting on the bed beside mary.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{get away from her.}
<A>__{his gun's leveled at gabriel's head. the angel sits there impassively, then smiles.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you know. son of a bitch, the priest wanna be actually figured it out. that's a rare club, son. at least down here.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{back away from the kid, man. now.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{she won't feel anything, honest. i will have to tear her apart of course just the way it goes but it'll be all right in the end. a good catholic boy like you, mr. daggett, you should be on my side.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{goddamn it }
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you're gonna have to watch that profanity.}
<A>__{jerry suddenly leaps out from behind the door and tackles thomas to the carpet. the gun skitters to one side as jerry sinks his rotting teeth into thomas's shoulder. thomas cries out and slams his fist against jerry's head, knocking off an ear. gabriel turns back to mary's frightened face and smiles as he runs a hand through her hair.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{it'll only be a moment...}
<A>__{katherine suddenly hammers gabriel across the side of the head with a chair, knocking him to the floor. as he gets up she hits him again. thomas manages to bring his leg up and kicks jerry hard against the chest, forcing him off. gabriel grabs both of katherine's legs and pulls, crashing her flat on her back. thomas scrambles for his gun, grabs it, and as jerry comes at him again spins and fires twice. the slugs rip into jerry's chest and knock him to his knees. as the putrid, curdled juices pump lumpily out of him, jerry looks up at thomas and smiles.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{thanks man, i appreciate it. you're a sport.}
<A>__{thomas fires a slug into his forehead. jerry's brain winks out as he collapses to the floor, dead. thomas's gun is abruptly wrenched from his hand onto the bed as gabriel nails him with a thrown lamp, vaults the bed between them, and grabs him by the collar, slamming thomas up against the wall. he looks down at jerry's finally lifeless corpse, incensed at thomas's handiwork.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you little pest, do you have any idea how hard it is to get one of those?}
<A>__{he throws thomas down onto a table, splintering it. katherine climbs shakily to her knees.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{you son of a bitch, why? why do this?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{because i'm an angel, you miserable wretch! i kill first borns while their mothers watch! i turn whole cities into salt! i even, when i feel like it, rip the souls from little girls! and from now until eternity, the only thing you'll be able to count on in your pathetic little existence is never knowing why!}
<P>__{(deep breath)}
<D>__{i'm wasting my time here.}
<P>__{(turns to mary)}
<D>__{c'mon petunia, let's get on with it...}
<A>__{gabriel walks over to the bed. the moment he gets close, mary lifts thomas's pistol up from the sheets and shoots him twice, the impact knocking him on his ass. katherine rushes to mary, scoops her up and runs for the door. she pauses beside thomas, still lying in the wreckage of the table.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{go. go!}
<A>__{katherine disappears through the bedroom doorway. gabriel spins around and stands. thomas leaps from a ragged crouch, hitting gabriel low with a body block. it's like butting concrete. gabriel picks up thomas by the scruff of the neck and heaves him through the flimsy room paneling. thomas crashes with a mass of splinters into the kitchen. he stumbles backward hopelessly as gabriel peruses him through the trailer. he desperately throws pots, glasses, anything at gabriel. finally trapped, he scrambles up onto the dinner table, scattering salt and sugar bowls, and dives through the levored window.}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{thomas, in a hail of shattered glass, smacks the red earth, pulls himself up to his knees and tries to stumble and crawl away as gabriel bangs open the trailer door and stomps down the stairs toward katherine, her arms around mary.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{...you...}
<A>__{he eases his gait, measuring the distance to her.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{...can't...}
<A>__{there's just those sunglasses coming. those endless pits of black.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{...have her!!}
<A>__{katherine lifts thomas's pistol and fires. again. again. the slugs bang off the corregated metal, smash a window, kick up some dust, and puncture the propane tank beneath the trailer. wumpp bam! the entire trailer explodes in a fiery cloud of twisting}
<B>__{metal.}
<A>__{katherine huddles mary close to the ground as flaming chunks whack everywhere. gabriel is hammered to the earth and disappears in the rolling fire cloud. thomas, further away, is knocked head over heels in the ruddy dust. the fire cloud dissipates quickly into the sky, leaving behind scorched brush, and little else, crackling softly. gabriel's body looks blackened and still. katherine rushes to thomas, who's pulled himself up to his knees, a ragged slice above his eye bleeding badly. she helps him to his feet and over to the pickup, where he sits down against the tire as katherine pulls out her first aid kit. mary's there, standing with her shaken grandmother.}
<C>__{daggett}
<P>__{(re grandmother)}
<D>__{where...}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{she was coming up the street.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{is gabriel dead?}
<A>__{mary's knelt down beside thomas.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{they're not like you and me. you've got to cut their hearts out. the only thing god gave them.}
<A>__{a sheriff car roars up, the two deputies exiting warily.}
<C>__{deputy}
<D>__{what the hell happened here?}
<A>__{katherine's wiping the blood out of thomas's eye. gasping from the shearing pain, he tosses an id at the foot of the deputy.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{lapd.}
<C>__{deputy}
<P>__{(looks at it, hands it to partner)}
<D>__{that's a start. how about the rest of it?}
<A>__{from somewhere back in town there's the growl of a volunteer fire engine.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{that man over there. he's wanted. murder. i'm taking him in.}
<P>__{(grimaces)}
<D>__{ shit...}
<A>__{the pain's unbareable. katherine dabs his cut with disinfectant.}
<C>__{deputy}
<D>__{i think you're going to the hospital first.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{ no, i have to }
<A>__{again, the pain. the second deputy has walked over to gabriel.}
<C>__{deputy}
<D>__{is he alive? deputy #2 he's alive.}
<C>__{deputy}
<D>__{cuff him. we'll take him to the hospital in our car.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{ no, you don't understand. you have to let me have him }
<A>__{the volunteer fire engine growls up through the weeds, drowning out thomas's words. two firemen kneel down beside him with medical kits. the deputy has walked over to his partner and the two are dragging back between them a cuffed, comatose gabriel.}
<C>__{daggett}
<P>__{(hoarse, faint)}
<D>__{you'll never hold him.}
<A>__{thomas tries to get up, but the pain and a hand from the firemen keep him down. as the deputies pass, he manages to desperately grab the one's pant cuff.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{take off his sunglasses... jesus christ, just take off his sunglasses...}
<A>__{gabriel's head lies low between the shoulders. the deputy looks with concern at the firemen.}
<C>__{fireman}
<P>__{(re thomas)}
<D>__{he'll be all right. just a bad hit.}
<A>__{the deputy nods. as they carry on to the car with gabriel, the angel turns his head slightly and smiles a smile only for thomas.}
<C>__{fireman}
<P>__{(to partner)}
<D>__{let's get a splinterior}
<A>__{the patrol car pulls away. as the firemen walk back to their engine, thomas looks frantically at katherine.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{we have to get out of here.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{but your head...}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{if you want mary to stay alive past sundown we have to leave, and we have to do it now.}
<A>__{they lock eyes. then katherine without a word helps thomas up into the passenger side of the pickup. mary gathers her grandmother into the pickup's bed and climbs up beside her as katherine starts the engine. the firemen turn in confusion as the truck peels out of the lot and up onto the road.}
