<D>__{ok (indifferent) thanks.}
<A>__{cy's voice is barely audible as he rummages in boxes. mo looks in at him. he gets a text, checks it, and responds. with a `ha!', cy pulls something out of a box. mo waits. as he does so, he shifts his weight from his right foot to his left. cy emerges from the storage area looking flushed with effort.}
