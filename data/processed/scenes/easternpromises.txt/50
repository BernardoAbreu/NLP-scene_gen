<L>__{interior trafalgar hospital. s.c.b.u. christine's private room night}
<D>__{in the half lit private room, anna is dancing with christine in her arms. she is singing a lullaby softly to her. the door is open to the rest of the ward and all the other babies are silent. finally she lays a sleeping christine back in her crib. she sits down on the bed where the mother should be. she curses herself silently and gets to her feet, determined to pull herself together. as she starts to leave the private room to enter the ward, she is suddenly confronted by semyon. he is standing in the shadows, a bavarian trilby in his hands. anna gasps with shock. semyon speaks softly...}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{hello anna. i came on tiptoes.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{how did you get in here?}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{there are always open doors, anna ivanovna. anna glances at an alarm button.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you're not allowed in here.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{please anna, let me speak. semyon looks to be almost in tears. he speaks softly.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{i translated the diary... a baby begins to cry and is comforted somewhere across the ward.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{i was shocked to discover... that my son kirill is mentioned many times. semyon appears to be fighting tears.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{i have known for some years that he has strayed from the path i set out for him. his mother died when he was very young. a pause. anna almost begins to buy his sorrow...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what does it say about him? semyon looks up, his eyes filled with tears.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{many bad things. a pause.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{but anna please. let me deal with him. if the diary should find its way to the police... semyon wipes his eyes.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{some of the things my son did are illegal. anna, he is a good boy. a pause.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i don't care about him. i care about the baby.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{of course. of course. and that is the baby? semyon glances over anna's shoulder into the corner where christine is sleeping. anna freezes and doesn't reply. semyon takes her hand.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{anna, i have made some inquiries and i have found out an address for tatiana's family in russia. that's where the baby belongs, no? anna reacts but semyon's face suddenly hardens...}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{so... perhaps we can do a deal. he stares into her eyes.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{do you understand me, anna? at that moment a nurse walks by and hesitates when she sees semyon.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{anna?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it's ok. he's just leaving. semyon puts his hat onto his head.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{you know where i am, anna ivanovna. he turns.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{and i know where you are. semyon disappears into the shadows of the ward. as anna reacts we hear tatiana in v.o.}
<C>__{tatiana }
<D>__{i was thrown down the stairs and fell onto some sacks, like potato sacks...}
