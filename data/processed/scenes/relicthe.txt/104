<L>__{interior secure storage area night}
<A>__{margo shoves frock behind her, slams the door shut. seconds later, the beast throws itself against the storage door. they hear it outside, growling in fury, claws lashing out. margo and frock press back in the darkness, terror in their eyes.}
<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{pendergast runs forward in the echoing hallway, his gun drawn, his flashlight on. a few more steps and he holds hard. his eyes go wide in astonishment as his light illuminates the beast. it's tearing at the steel door furiously with incredible force. as the flashlight beam hits it, mbwun roars and looks up. now we see it clearly for the first time. the monster is massive, putrid, rank. slit reptilian green eyes are rimmed in red. a ridge of stiff black hair rises on the creature's buffalo like humped back. the withers are muscled and covered with plates. a forked tongue licks out as purple lips draw back exposing razor sharp teeth. the claws raise up to fend off the light. pendergast steadies himself with difficulty, takes a few seconds to aim with the greatest care. mbwun makes a move towards him and he squeezes the trigger hard. the gun echoes in the hall. a split second and a white streak moves right up the beast's cranium. a direct hit. the shot echoes and mbwun drops it's claws. the flashlight continues to shine like a high beam right into the beast's eyes. angry and blinded, the creature turns and in a moment, lopes off. pendergast watches, unimaginably relieved. realizing what just happened, his knees start to buckle. he catches himself, wipes one hand across his eyes. a voice comes from the storage room.}

<C>__{margo}
<D>__{wounded?}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{no. a chromium alloy tipped .45 caliber bullet bounced off that thing's skull like a spit ball. i think it was bothered by my light.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{that would fit. it's nocturnal. quick. come inside.}
