<L>__{exterior 15 central park west night}
<A>__{as the cab stops outside of the building...}
<L>__{interior bretton woods's office night}
<A>__{as the thunder claps outside. jacob stares at the goya painting... saturno devorando a sus hijos saturn. the man being eaten alive.}
<C>__{bretton woods }
<D>__{i don't like unannounced visits.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{united bancorp is going under. wells fargo has stepped up but the offer is insanely low.}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{i know all this.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you still have the fund and you still have the leverage that comes with it. you want out of the game... buy a bank.}
<A>__{bretton skeptically regards jacob.}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{why are you doing this?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{because i got you into those insurance companies... because i let you down...}
<A>__{and bretton... biting his lip in thought...}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{i don't like the mortgage toxic waste. it can't be quantified... and it spreads...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i worked it out already. you wouldn't have to take it.}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{how'd you do that?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{well, wells won't insure the zabel institutional money. it's against their policy.}
<A>__{and then...}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{i told them you would.}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{then who would take on the mortgage securities?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{uncle sam.}
<A>__{bretton slowly nods... taking all this in...}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{so, i'd get the bank, the kzi assets including the institutional fund yet none of the mortgage securities.}
<A>__{as jacob leans forward... going in for the kill...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{you could actually own the bank your father toiled away at his whole career. think about that, bretton.}
<A>__{bretton just shakes his head.}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{we're going to lose our credit. i'm facing margin calls.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{so in order to stay in the game... we need fresh money.}
<A>__{bretton nods...}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{oleg }
<C>__{bretton woods}
<P>__{(not going to work)}
<D>__{oil's crashing.}
<A>__{jacob thinks for a moment, then...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{and how much do we need?}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{fifty, sixty million minimum... and that's just to hold off the current margin calls.}
<A>__{and bretton just sighs...}
<C>__{bretton woods }
<D>__{god, de leveraging is a bitch.}
<A>__{standing...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{sit tight. i'm going to get us the money.}
<A>__{and jacob goes... bretton calling out after him...}
<C>__{bretton woods}
<D>__{from who... ?}
