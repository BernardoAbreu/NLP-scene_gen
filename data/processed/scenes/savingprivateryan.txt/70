<C>__{the americans}
<D>__{desperately trying to cover him.}
<C>__{the germans}
<D>__{open up with a volley.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{is almost there.}
<B>__{all the americans stand and fire}
<A>__{as best they can. right past sarge. it's not enough.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{five feet from the sandbags, his back is torn apart by germans fire. he looks down, stunned at his chest. amazed to see gaping holes. an instant of surprise, more than fear.}
<A>__{he looks to miller. takes two more stumbling steps. falls onto the sandbags. dropping the b.a.r. over the edge. dies. the americans fire madly, continuously}
<C>__{the germans}
<D>__{who killed sarge are killed. the others back off for now.}
<A>__{reiben, upham, jackson, ryan fire at the retreating germans.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{grabs sarge and pulls him over the barricade. sees that he's dead.}

<D>__{watch, start to gather.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{goddamn it...goddamn it...goddamn it...}
<C>__{miller}

<A>__{they hesitate.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{go!}
<A>__{they follow the order. all except ryan, who doesn't move. he can't take his eyes off sarge.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{doesn't move. he just stares at sarge's body.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{looks at miller, sees him growing weak, starting to sway. he gently tries to move miller aside.}
<C>__{ryan}
<D>__{i will take care of sarge...}
<A>__{miller looks up at ryan, then back at sarge's body. miller grows cold, making the same startling transformation he made as he kneeled over wade's body.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{sarge? who's sarge?}
<A>__{but this time it doesn't work. he can't make it stick. the hard expression, disappears. he drifts, utterly lost. he's called his own bluff.}
