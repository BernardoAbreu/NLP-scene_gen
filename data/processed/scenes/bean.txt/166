<L>__{interior living room. day}
<A>__{another game. jennifer's super nintendo game on tv in the lounge area. it is a gothic game where he man types attack vampires and bats with swords. david is in the kitchen setting out the roses in a vase. the door opens enter alison. some tension.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{hi,}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{hi..... (pause ) roses.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yes. and i have a wine for dinner that will kill you.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{great. ( she settles a little ) you said you'd ask grierson about putting our guest somewhere else. did you?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{sort of half.....}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{meaning?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i was sort of half way through the sentence in which i would have asked him when it suddenly seemed like a mistake.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{honestly david, you're so spineless.}
<A>__{pause. jennifer looks around. she can't help but hear. not a happy experience.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{roses. wine.}
<A>__{he is asking her for softness. pause. at which moment bean enters wearing pointy hat. he helps himself to a melon from a bowl. he grins and exits. alison looks at david sadly.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{but no real change.}
<A>__{almost instantly, bean is back. he rummages through a drawer and takes out some large elastic bands. and leaves.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{i really do need some time on my own. away from here.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{look, bean's history. i swear to you, he's packing as we speak. and you can't leave. ( he picks up the bambi ) i've got bambi. you never go anywhere without him. please let's just talk.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{okay. ( ghost of a smile ) put bambi down, and we'll talk.}
<A>__{he puts bambi down on the side table, on the flat surface of his cd player. bean appears again behind her, now looking even madder. pointy hat, large pointy ears made from melon peel, held in place by the rubber band stretched round his face huge front teeth also cut from the melon. he grins gleefully. david and alison just stare. bean is followed by kevin who wears the same ears and teeth.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{look, you guys, could you just give us a moment to ... jennifer could you turn that damn thing down.}
<A>__{it is quite loud. jennifer looks for the remote control. bean helpfully picks up a remote control from the sofa and points it across the room.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{no, that's not for the tv. that's for the ...}
<A>__{too late! bean punches a button and the lid of the cd player launches the bambi into the air. david sees it. in slow motion he dives dramatically and just misses it. it smashes on the floor. bean raises his eyes heavenwards, shakes his head and tuts. he thinks david is a real butter fingers. jennifer, upset, has found the tv remote and unintentionally switches from the vampire game to a tv channel. it's very loud. alison gives david a tearful look, and shakes her head.}
