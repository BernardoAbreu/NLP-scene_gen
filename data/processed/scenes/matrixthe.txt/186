<L>__{interior "el" station (matrix) day}
<A>__{a metal gate is locked, the sign reading, "station closed." neo looks around, takes out a gun and blows off the lock. in the moist underground distance they hear the muted ring of a telephone. the phone is ringing inside a graffiti covered booth. across from it, sitting hunched against the red concrete wall, is an old man. he stares at the ringing phone, taking a final pull off his t bird. no one is around. it continues to ring. determined, he stands and walks to the booth. he is about to answer the phone, when neo sees him.}

<D>__{don't!}
<A>__{the old man stops, neo rushes at hin, gliding smoothly over the turnstiles.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{i'm sorry i didn't mean!}
<A>__{the old man is shaking, terrified. neo looks at his gun. he glances over his shoulder, then eases back the hammer.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{get outta here. okay? run! go!}
<A>__{the old man nods, turns and hurries deeper into the urban cave, disappearing into the shadows as trinity and morpheus arrive.}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{what happened? was that }
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{it was nobody.}
<A>__{neo turns to the ringing booth.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{let's go! you first, morpheus.}
<A>__{morpheus gets in and answers the phone. lost in the shadow, the old man turns back and watches as morpheus disappears, the phone dropping, dangling by its cord. his eyes grow wide, glowing white in the dark.}
