<A>__{shane is on the floor, sliding forward, nervously.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{wriggle like a snake `til you can't no more. then better jump quick, like there ain't no floor.}
<A>__{shane jumps up just as the floor under him drops away, revealing a pool of liquid. shane has wedged himself in the corner. a bead of his sweat falls into the liquid, and sizzles in a cloud of smoke. it's acid.}
<C>__{shane }
<P>__{(to himself, to calm down)}
<D>__{almost done, almost done... "just hold your breath, and jump to the left."}
<A>__{he jumps, to the left of the hole. he lands in front of the safe. he's relieved then nozzles spray yellow gas at him. he holds his breath just in time. still holding his breath:}
<C>__{shane }
<D>__{and that's the peter panda dance.}
<A>__{he flips the switch to disarmed. the safe's red light turns green. immediately, the flamethrowers and blowguns retract! the gas gets sucked into grates. the whole room goes silent. whew. bill looks around. he nervously steps forward he waves his hand over the floor, and jumps back. nothing happens. bill signals for mrs. chun to go first. she gestures back: you go. it's a stand off. finally, bill takes a breath and walks across the room. the booby traps are disarmed. mrs. chun follows, pulling julie along.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{thank you, shane. you were always my best man. i knew you'd figure it out.}
<A>__{shane scowls, disgusted.}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{you know, if you're willing to join up, i'd be happy to cut you in on the proceeds. what do you say we make a good team?}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{i was devoted to you, sir. and you betrayed all of that. all that we stand for.}
<A>__{beat. bill shrugs.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i will take that as a "no."}
<A>__{bill turns to the safe. he starts to reach for the dial... then catches himself. something's not right.}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{... i think you better open it.}
<A>__{shane reaches for the safe, before he reaches the dial }
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{wait. that's just what you want isn't it?}
<A>__{bill thinks, trying to read shane's poker face. shane shrugs. bill gestures to mrs. chun.}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{you open it.}
<A>__{mrs. chun doesn't budge.}
<C>__{bill }
<D>__{oh come on. i walked the floor first.}
<A>__{reluctantly mrs. chun reaches out, and touches the dial. nothing happens. relief. she turns it, and zappppp!}
