<A>__{the guard removes the blindfold. billy, adjusting to the light, stares around. the cell is spartan, with a series of pulleys and primitive bondage devices hanging from the cobwebbed ceiling.a door opens and: hamidou steps in, lowering his head to get through the door.chief of the guards. a clean uniform. four stripes. the only guard to carry a holstered gun. very frightening man. he is about six two, two forty, and muscular, and moves lightly like a fighter on his feet. his skull is bullet shaped and completely shaven like billy's, enhancing this effect, he has no eyebrows, and his pale blue eyes (suggesting a trace of indo european stock in his ancestry) are set deep in his skull somewhat like turtle eyes, giving nothing away. his nose is a beak of skin his neck broad, his mouth a small crescent that moves as lightly as his feet between anger and amusement. he approaches billy, looks into his eyes, drawing out the moment for himself, enjoying the tension and the fear he instils in others. billy meets his eyes respectfully, then realizing this is perhaps not the thing do to, looks away. but, fascinated by the man's features beyond his self control, he looks back. hamidou, amused by eye actions, smiles thinly. the sort of smile that could imply friendship such is its hint of charm.}
