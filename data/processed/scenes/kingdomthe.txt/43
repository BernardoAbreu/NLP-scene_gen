<L>__{interior attorney general gideon young's office noon}
<A>__{fleury, grace and mayes enter. handsomely decorated, expansive: a lifetime of notable handshakes framed in black and white. the biggest is a picture of young and billy graham that could be titled, `lucky for you, we have all the answers.' gideon young sits behind his federalist era oak desk: a marathoner's build, a smile too bright perfect for his age. two others in attendance. a pear shaped 54 year old man with a midwest honest, ruddy oval face: ellis leach, assistant secretary, bureau of near eastern affairs, department of state and a 51 year old hispanic woman in conservative chanel: enough femininity without diminishing toughness: maricella canavesio, deputy national security advisor, white house}
<C>__{director grace}
<D>__{i apologize if we're late }
<C>__{gideon young}
<D>__{they were early.}
<C>__{director grace}
<D>__{you know special agent fleury?}
<C>__{gideon young}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{director grace}
<D>__{this is agent janet mayes, she's one of our arabic experts.}
<A>__{janet stares at young, looking mildly in over her head.}
<C>__{gideon young}
<D>__{ok. the latest.}
<A>__{grace sits, nods to fleury: you're up...}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{two suicide bombers. rumors they were dressed as saudi police. we believe this is the work of saudi terrorist named abu hamza.}
<A>__{young just stares at fleury kind of odd like a kid staring at a mushroom flavored popsicle.}
<C>__{gideon young}
<D>__{go on.}
<A>__{fleury continues:}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{a shooter crew served as distraction. after the initial attack there was a lull to allow saudi emergency teams...and our own attaches...to collect. then a secondary blast was triggered, aimed at those first responders. so they targeted families and rescuers with one attack.}
<P>__{(mildly sarcastic:)}
<D>__{i think that's a clear signal that their definition of `enemy' is expanding.}
<C>__{maricella canavesio}
<D>__{my god.}
<C>__{gideon young}
<D>__{let us never forget how cheap life is over there. now...i have seven minutes before my next meeting, so who's talking first?}
<P>__{(to fleury and grace, slow}
<D>__{like a kindergarten}
<P>__{teacher:)}
<D>__{you two digested the memo?}
<A>__{stoic nods from each. ellis leach raises his hand, a tone that's worlds away from young's.}
<C>__{ellis leach}
<D>__{i will go first if that's okay maricella?}
<P>__{(off her `yeah, sure' nod)}
<D>__{first, i'm sorry about fran manner.}
<A>__{gideon young remembers, nods along solemnly.}
<C>__{director grace}
<D>__{as we are about rex burr.}
<C>__{ellis leach}
<D>__{i met with prince thamer at the saudi embassy fifteen minutes after i heard this morning's news. after speaking with thamer, i advised we withhold additional us personnel because a big part of the religious justification for these bombs is the presence of current us personnel. more boots on saudi soil make an already combustible situation more so. i know that's not the answer you want, but...}
<A>__{motions to maricella: the floor is yours.}
<C>__{maricella canavesio}
<D>__{my two cents: the saudis haven't asked for fbi help. sounds like they've done just the opposite. if we force the issue, that could further anger an utterly important ally that shares a 1000 mile long border with iraq.}
<C>__{gideon young}
<P>__{(to grace and fleury)}
<D>__{it's all rock solid logic.}
<C>__{director grace}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we would just like to be on record as saying we think we should go asap }
<C>__{gideon young}
<D>__{that's not going to happen}
<A>__{young stands: we're done. fleury's look: that's it? young's already collecting his briefcase, jacket }
<C>__{gideon young }
<P>__{(mock sincerity to the room:)}
<D>__{ so as we present this to the public, let's as best we can try to view this through an fbi agent's eyes.}
<P>__{(beat...to grace:)}
<D>__{and please let me know if there's anything else we can do for you.}
<A>__{meeting seems over. not quite. fleury can't keep his mouth shut.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{sir, how would you imagine it looks viewed through an fbi agents eyes?}
<C>__{gideon young}
<D>__{pardon me?}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{i'm interested in how you think this situation is viewed through our eyes.}
<A>__{young, eyes on a republican gold rolex, instantly perturbed the meeting isn't ending.}
<C>__{gideon young}
<D>__{it's some variation on vengeance... when one of your own is killed, agents lose their analytical powers kind of a greatest strength, greatest weakness thing...}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{if i wanted vengeance, i'd have whispered `rex burr' into ellis's ear right when we walked in.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<A>__{eyes migrate to fleury }
<C>__{ronald fleury }
<D>__{this isn't terrorism, ma'am. it's just serial murder.}
<C>__{maricella canavesio}
<D>__{what's the distinction?}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{to call this massacre an act of terrorism... that implies a specific political agenda. to me, these killings are so futile and unbalanced that they feel utterly sociopathic more like charles manson than osama bin laden...}
<A>__{fleury looks to mayes. she clears her throat. delivers the following with utter precision.}
<C>__{janet mayes}
<P>__{(beat, fuck it: go)}
<D>__{al qaeda lost the first phase of this war, so a new, zero sum phase has begun: if you won't join us, we'll let loose the truly talented murderers... abu hamza. he will kill so many of you that the resulting humiliation of the saudi royal family will cause an exodus, a rebellion, both. because the royal family simply cannot protect you or yours any longer.}
<A>__{fleury studies janet with solid respect. he gives janet a subtle nod: "nice work."}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{when she says talented, she's not talking about the walking bombs who can sneak past any and all security, nor the hi jackers tough enough to take an airliner. we're talking about the man who teaches them how...}
<C>__{janet mayes}
<D>__{ the operational commander who organizes, trains, plans, encourages. that is who we're fighting.}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{if we don't get inside saudi arabia within 36 hours, there is no chance we catch the killer responsible for al rahmah. none.}
<C>__{ellis leach}
<D>__{okay. i believe it all. so doesn't your team in that country represent the kind of target one of these `masters' would die for? trade ten of their own for one of you?}
<C>__{ronald fleury}
<D>__{to not engage these criminals out of fear for our personal safety is just another way of saying `uncle.'}
<A>__{fleury takes another deep breath.}
<C>__{ronald fleury }
<D>__{i will say it another way: evidence starts to go cold after twenty four hours. if we can't get in now, we will not find the man or men responsible for this crime. we couldn't do it at khobar; we couldn't do it in yemen; we have barely scratched the surface in iraq. and we are on verge of not doing it here. they are getting stronger, we are getting weaker. i just lost a very good friend and i would very much like to go and do my job.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{gideon young}
<P>__{(chuckle)}
<D>__{that was spirited... let's all thank god special agent fleury doesn't make policy decisions. he'd turn the fbi into patton's third army.}
<A>__{young stands. fleury contemplates career ending violence.}
