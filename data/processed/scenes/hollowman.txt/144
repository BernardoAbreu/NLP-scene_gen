<L>__{exterior dr. kramer's house potomac md night}
<A>__{the stately stone house sits on a finely manicured lawn in one of the nicest neighborhoods in town. linda's car is parked on the curb in front. we break from a typical establishing shot and as the camera tracks closer to the house, we realize that we are sebastian's pov we hear breathing and footsteps as we push through some bushes and head toward a bay window which looks into the kramer living room. through the glass we see linda and matt seated across from dr. kramer. we can't hear what they're saying but it certainly looks serious. kramer puffs on a pipe and strokes his beard, shaking his head. kramer rises and shakes hands with linda and matt, and the three of them head toward the front door. we move away from the window and track toward the front door. as the door opens we begin to hear the tail end of the conversation.}
