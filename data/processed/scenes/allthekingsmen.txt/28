<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what are you afraid of?}
<C>__{stanton}
<D>__{i thought they were very good. i was proud of you, jack. i was particularly interested in stark's ideas on health and medicine. you know the conditions at the hospital i work in. they're intolerable. i'd like to meet this willie stark. he sounds like an honest man.}
<C>__{mcevoy}
<D>__{honest man? this state is full of these log cabin abe lincolns with price tags on them. the louder he yells the higher his price.}

<D>__{you think you can buy anything, don't you?}
