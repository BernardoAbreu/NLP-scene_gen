<L>__{interior corona club main room day}
<A>__{the old dude bursts into the room with a roll of toilet paper in his hand, and a sheet of sweat sliding down his face. the bartender rises up from behind the counter. the camera dollies slowly by the dead dudes. their blood bathed faces twisted into odd shapes and expressions. the camera continues to dolly to the one dead dude still holding the guitar case. his face is a bloody pulp. the camera stops dollying to the old dude's mixed drink. a hand is stirring it with a straw. the camera pans up the arm to reveal azul, standing expressionless with his gun sling over his shoulder. shot at 16fps the old dude quickly drops the toilet paper and runs back inside the bathroom. azul turns to his guitar case and carefully chooses another weapon. he grabs the drink and tosses a napkin over his arm like a waiter, then casually follows the old dude into the bathroom. the bartenders glance at each other. one pours a shot glass full of tequila and raises it to his lips to drink it. shots ring out and the bartender spills the drink over himself. without warning azul bursts from the bathroom and walks calmly to his case. he replaces the weapon, picks up the case and leaves. a few seconds pass before the bartender grabs the phone and furiously dials.}

<A>__{the door bursts open as azul reenters, storming to the bar. the bartender is so petrified he doesn't think to drop the phone. azul walks right up to the bartender. the bartender shuts his eyes. the sound of the beer bottle popping open canbe heard, along with the sound of thirsty guzzling. the bartender opens his eyes to azul. closeup of the empty bottle slamming to the counter. the bartender glances down at the bottle. closeup of azul tossing a few coins near the bottle as payment. azul leaves. a few seconds pass as the bartender is standing there. you hear moco yelling into the receiver asking what's going on.}
