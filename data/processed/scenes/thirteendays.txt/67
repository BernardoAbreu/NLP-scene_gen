<L>__{interior oval office night}
<A>__{the camera picks up the darkened windows: the meeting has gone long. the camera moves past kenny and sorensen standing in the doorway to kenny's office, finds the president in his chair across from gromyko on the sofa. rusk, ambassador anatoly dobrinyn, and two interpreters around them.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{so that there should be no misunderstanding, the position of the united states, which has been made clear by the attorney general to ambassador dobrynin here, i shall read a sentence from my own statement to the press dated september 13th.}
<P>__{(beat, reading)}
<D>__{should missiles or offensive weapons be placed in cuba, it would present the gravest threat to u.s. national security.}
<A>__{the president stares at gromyko as the translator finishes translating. gromyko sits there, enigmatic, cold, unreadable. the translator finishes, and gromyko stops him with a gesture so he can answer in his own accented english.}
<C>__{gromyko}
<D>__{mr. president, this will never be done. you need not be concerned.}
<A>__{the president hides his fury masterfully, and gazing over his glasses, asks:}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{so i do not misunderstand you: there are no offensive weapons in cuba.}
<A>__{a beat. and gromyko's response is flat, sure, steady:}
<C>__{gromyko}
<D>__{no, mr. president. we have sent defensive weapons only to cuba.}
<A>__{kenny's blazing eyes could drill holes in the back of gromyko's head. his gaze swings to the president's desk. beneath the desk sit the briefing boards with the evidence.}
