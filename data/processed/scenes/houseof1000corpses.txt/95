<L>__{interior farmhouse basement tiny's room late afternoon}
<A>__{water drips down from the leaking pipes above. scavenging rats scurry across the concrete floor. in a far corner a single light burns, a child's humpty dumpty lamp, illuminating denise is strapped to an old wooden bed. she has been stripped of her own clothes and is now wearing a blue checked little girl's dress. her hair is tied in pigtails. she is cold and shivering. boom. the basement door opens, heavy footsteps lumber down the creaking stairs. it is tiny. tiny is wearing an orange t shirt that reads, "this is my halloween costume". for the first time we see the skin on his arms, it is severely deformed from burn scars. he is holding a small tray. on the tray is a box of cereal, milk, a bowl and a spoon. tiny goes over to denise, sets down the tray, and proudly displays his t shirt.}

<P>__{(hoarse and dry)}
<D>__{please... tiny, please. let me go... help me.}
<A>__{tiny sits down on a stool next to the bed, he stares down at denise like a confused dog.}
<C>__{denise}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{please, god please.}
<A>__{tiny begins preparing her food, carefully pouring the cereal and milk into the bowl. he stirs it with the spoon. tiny gently lifts denise's head and feeds her like a baby. denise swallows the food, trying not to choke. after a few spoonfuls tiny stands up and walks over to a dark corner of the room. he pulls a string and turns on a swinging ceiling light. in the light we see a rusty cage, inside are three rail thin female bodies. tiny throws the remainder of the cereal into the cage. one of the bodies moves to eat the scraps, the others do not. they are dead. tiny turns off the overhead light.}
