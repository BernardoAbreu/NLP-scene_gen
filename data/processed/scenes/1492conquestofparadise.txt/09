<L>__{exterior cloister la rabida day}
<A>__{as they dismount and walk into the quiet cloisters, fernando suddenly spots a familiar figure, standing under the roman arches.}
<C>__{fernando}
<D>__{diego!}
<A>__{he rushes over, full of joy, to kiss his brother an adolescent dressed in the novice robe, with a solemn, delicate face. diego's response is constrained.}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{diego! aren't you going to kiss your brother?}
<A>__{diego smiles a little, and kisses fernando who is immediately distracted by a procession of hooded monks, hurrying to the refectory, as a bell begins to chime. the monks all turn to greet antonio de marchena, a white haired, elderly man and a monk cosmographer. marchena's gesture is broad and elegant as he opens his arms to greet columbus. he pats fernando's head and turns to diego.}
<C>__{marchena}
<D>__{diego, take fernando to the dining hall. he must be hungry.}
<C>__{diego}
<D>__{yes, father.}
<A>__{both children leave under the arched roof. columbus and marchena begin to walk across the cloister.}
<C>__{marchena}
<D>__{diego is a bright boy a pleasure to teach but so serious... brothers should be raised together, colon. even brothers from different mothers...}
<C>__{columbus}
<D>__{father, i am doing what i think is the best for him. and he has the teacher i would have chosen for myself.}
<A>__{marchena laughs at the compliment.}
<C>__{marchena}
<D>__{just be careful you don't lose him.}
<A>__{they have crossed the cloister. marchena pushes open a door.}
