<L>__{interior emily's house night}
<A>__{tense dinner. emily barely touching hers. lucy, absently, but with an almost surgical precision, is cutting peas in}
<B>__{half on her plate and eating them one by one off the tip of}
<A>__{the knife. weird. she stops, self conscious, looks at emily across the table.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{are you mad at me?}
<C>__{emily}

<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{want me to brush your hair?}

<P>__{(stands up)}
<D>__{it will make you feel better. i will get the brush.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{i said no, thank you.}
<A>__{lucy stares at emily for a moment then sits again. and it's strange, her posture seems subtly different, stiffer, bonier, as if all her muscles have drawn taut under her clothes. in a voice at once innocent and menacing:}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{doug said something, didn't he?}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{no. doug? he says you're doing great.}
<A>__{tense silence.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{what did he tell you?}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{lucy stares at her, seeing through the facade. then, oddly bright, taking a bite of food:}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{you're funny.}
