<LOC>__{INT.. NOCKMAAR CASTLE - DAY}
<ACTION>__{The scream continues as WE MOVE THROUGH the grim corri- dors of the castle TOWARD stairs leading down to a dungeon.}
<LOC>__{INT.. DUNGEON - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Silhouetted in sadows, three Nockmaar MINIONS stand guard.  In a jail cell, sex fully pregnant WOMEN watch from behind iron bars.  The screaming stops.  There's a moment of silence.  As WE MOVE INTO another jail cell WE HEAR a slap and the first cry of a newborn BABY. In the cell a black-robed DRUID watches intensely as ETHNA, a midwife, leans over the MOTHER and wraps the baby in swaddling.}

<DIAL>__{It is a girl.}

<CHAR>__{DRUID} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's true then.  I must tell Queen Bavmorda.}
<ACTION>__{With great urgency the druid hurries up the dungeon stairs.  Ethna gently places the baby on the mother's breast.  The mother comforst the baby lovingly until it stops crying.  Then she reaches out and clasps the midwife's wrist.}
<CHAR>__{MOTHER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ethna, please.  Help me.  They're going to kill my baby.}

<DIAL>__{Pretend this is the child.}
<CHAR>__{MOTHER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thank you, Ethna.  Thank you.}
<ACTION>__{The mother kisses her baby and hands it to Ethna, who hides the baby inside the basket of rags.  Ethna car- ries the basket past the guards and up the stairs. The mother lies back and sighs with relief.  Then she hears clinking bootsteps and her eyes widen with fear. QUEEN BAVMORDA sweeps down the dungeon stairs, her black robes flowing behind her.  The druid hurries alongside.}

<CHAR>__{BAVMORDA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Kill her.}
<ACTION>__{Bavmorda storms away with the druid.  WE SEE the shadow of the guard move over the terrified mother.  War drums begin to beat out an alarm.}

<ACTION>__{TITLES BEGIN.  The midwife hurries through swirling show, clutching the baby.}
<LOC>__{EXT. VILLAGE - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Nockmaar troops on horseback charge into a desolate village, driving ferocious DEATH DOGS into huts, violently searching for the baby.  The oppressed, poor VILLAGERS are yanked into the street.  Some of them are beaten.  One is killed. The midwife hides behind a hut, still holding the baby, then runs away from the village.}

<ACTION>__{Ethna treks across an open grass field.}
<LOC>__{EXT. WOODS - NIGHT}

<LOC>__{EXT. FOREST - DAWN}
<ACTION>__{Ethna runs desperately for her life.  Chasing her are two vicious DEATH DOGS.  She scrambles across a shallow river.  She claws at rock and tears away sticks and driftwood matted together with weeds.  Into this she places the baby and sets it afloat downstream.}
<CHAR>__{DEATH DOG} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Bordak!}
<ACTION>__{The dogs lunge from the woods and splash across the river.  The midwife claws her way up a steep bank, lur- ing the dogs.  As they attack her:}
<CHAR>__{MIDWIFE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't have her!  No!  No!}
<ACTION>__{She grabs a stick and tries to defend herself, thrash- ing at the snarling dogs. From the baby's view, as it floats down the river, WE SEE the dogs kill the midwife beyond the distant trees.}
<LOC>__{EXT. DOWNRIVER - DAY - MONTAGE}
<ACTION>__{The little raft of sticks swirls precariously in the current.  It glances off jutting rocks, tumbles over rapids, and scrapes under overhanging trees.}

<ACTION>__{At last the raft catches in some weeks, almost dumping the baby.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{TITLE SEQUENCE ENDS}

<LOC>__{EXT. RIVERBANK - DAY}
<ACTION>__{WE SEE Willow from the baby's view.  His eyes pop open. He quickly backs his children away.}
<CHAR>__{WILLOW} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Back!  Don't go near it.  We don't know where it's been.  It could be diseased.}
<CHAR>__{MIMS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's a baby!}
<CHAR>__{RANON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's not a Nelwyn baby.}
<CHAR>__{WILLOW} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, it's too big to be a Nelwyn baby.  It looks like a daikini...}
<CHAR>__{MIMS} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{WILLOW} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Mims!  Get back here!  It might bite you.}

<DIAL>__{Ufgood!  Willow Ufgood!}
<ACTION>__{Willow, in a sudden panic, sees BURGLEKUTT in the dis- tance.  He splashes into the river, grabs the raft, plunks it on the bank and tries to hush the crying baby.}
<CHAR>__{WILLOW} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Shhh, shhh!  It's the Prefect -- that's all I need.  Mims, Ranon, keep this thing hidden...}
<LOC>__{EXT. UFGOOD FARM - DAY}

<DIAL>__{Mr. Burglekutt!  He hasn't done anything wrong!}
<ACTION>__{Willow's wife KIAYA chases Burglekutt across the field, her beautiful long hair flowing behind her.  Willow quickly gets behind his plow like he's been there all day.}

<DIAL>__{Ufgood!  What do you think you're doing!  I tell the planting seeds in this village.}
<CHAR>__{KIAYA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I told him we didn't steal it, Wil- low.}
<ACTION>__{Burglekutt furiously scoops a handful of seeds out of Willow's sack and shakes them under Willow's nose.}
<CHAR>__{BURGLEKUTT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You haven't paid your debts.  Where did you get these seeds?}
<ACTION>__{With pride, Willow puts his arm around his wife.}
<CHAR>__{WILLOW} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{In the forest.  My family's been gathering them since last fall. There's no law against that, Bur- glekutt.}

<CHAR>__{KIAYA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Willow!  You left the children alone by the river??}
<ACTION>__{In alarm she runs off before Willow can stop her.  Bur- glekutt sweeps the horizon with his walking stick.}
<CHAR>__{BURGLEKUTT} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Too late, Ufgood.  You'll never get your planting done before the rains start.  You're gonna lose this land.}
<ACTION>__{He raises the seeds high above his head, then smashes them down at Willow's boots.  He waddles away toward two of his MEN who wait by the road.  Then:  Kiaya SHRIEKS from the river.  Burglekutt stops in his tracks and shakes his head as if to say "the whole family's crazy."  Off he trudges.  Willow watches and waits. Then runs as fast as he can to the river.}
<LOC>__{EXT. RIVER - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Kiaya cradles the baby in her arms.  Willow runs up, and with patriarchal authority, puts his fists on his hips.}

<DIAL>__{Kiaya, what are we going to do?}
<CHAR>__{KIAYA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We're gonna give this baby a bath.}
<ACTION>__{The baby squeals with joy as Kiaya lifts her into the bath.}
<CHAR>__{WILLOW} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Burglekutt's right.  There's not enough time to finish plowing. We'll lose everything and I'll end up working in the mines.}
<ACTION>__{He shudders at the thought.}
<CHAR>__{KIAYA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Willow, do you think we should take her to the Village Council?}
<CHAR>__{WILLOW} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, no!  They'll think it's a bad omen.  There'll be a flood or a drought or a plague and everybody'll blame me for it!}
<CHAR>__{RANON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Look.  What's that?}
<ACTION>__{Willow leans forward.  On the baby's shoulder is a small branded scar in a circular design.  It only adds to Willow's fears.}

<ACTION>__{The baby kicks and splashes and giggles in the bath.}
<LOC>__{EXT. NELWYN VILLAGE - DAY}
<ACTION>__{The raucous BAND plays as NELWYNS dance and celebrate amid brochs and wheelhouses garlanded with flowers.  A crowd cheers wildly as MINERS battle FARMERS in a tug- of-war, finally yanking the farmers face-first into a puddle of mud.  On a stage a HARLEQUIN dances delight- fully.  While on a raised platform the five members of the VILLAGE COUNCIL sit and observe, mildly amused. The head councilman is Burglekutt. The WE SEE Willow on another stage.  He flourishes his colorful sticks and cloths.  In the audience WE NOTICE his friend MEEGOSH, who wears a miner's apron, rooting Willow on.}
<CHAR>__{WILLOW} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And now!  For our final amazing bit of magic, I will make an entire pig completely disappear!}
<ACTION>__{Meegosh applauds as Mims and Ranon trot out lugging a tiny baby pig in a crate.  As Willow takes the pig out it bites his hand and gets away.  Willow tackles and squashes it.  The crowd laughs and half of them leave, and Meegosh covers his face. Mims and Ranon rapidly wave a bright blanket.  Willow cleverly whips the pig under his legs and behind his back and suddenly it's gone!  Impresse, the crowd gasps.  Then the pig squeals and dashes through Willow's legs and leaps off the stage.}
<CHAR>__{CROWD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Aaww!  Booo!  Sssss!}
<ACTION>__{Burglekutt and the Council shake their heads as Willow, embarassed, picks up his things.  Meegosh trots up with the pig under his arm.}

<DIAL>__{Meegosh, I'm in trouble.}
<CHAR>__{MEEGOSH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey, it wasn't that bad.  You need a better pig, that's all.}
<ACTION>__{But as they walk past the Village Council, and Bur- glekutt sneers down at Willow, Meegosh catches on.}
<CHAR>__{MEEGOSH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Now Burglekutt's got you in the squeeze.  Soon you'll be down in the mines like me.}
<CHAR>__{WILLOW} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Mining.  I hate closed-in spaces. That's the last thing I'd ever do.}

<CHAR>__{MEEGOSH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You know I'll help you as much as I can, Willow.}
<ACTION>__{The Village Council members stand up respectfully as the wise old HIGH ALDWIN hobbles through the adoring crowd.  Mims and Ranon rush up to Willow with several other children who are eating candy.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(truly amazed)}
<DIAL>__{The High Aldwin??  Why?}
<ACTION>__{But Willow has already wandered into the crowd, leaving Meegosh with a dozen sugar-charged children and a pig. Willow desperately pushes past people and finally reaches the High Aldwin.}

<DIAL>__{Apprentice?  To the High Aldwin!! Willow Ufgood???}
<ACTION>__{His belly shakes as he howls with laughter, encouraging his councilmen to join in.  Willow shrinks away, em- barassed. Then a terrified SHRIEK shatters the festivity.  Music stops and people grab their children and run for their lives.  A DEATH DOG rips a trail of destruction through the village. Meegosh holds onto Ranon and Mims.  But when Mims sees Willow she runs right out into the open.  Willow charges twoard her, tackling her and rolling away from the beast's claws.}
<CHAR>__{DEATH DOG} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

Suddenly the wagon wheel wobbles and the rim flies off. The jolt throws the minion off balance.  Madmartigan kicks him.  The minion hurtles off the taligate but holds on, dragged by the wagon. Rool and Teemo grab hold of a rope securing a large wooden keg.  Together they yank it.  Untying the keg and sending it tumbling off the back.  The minion looks up in horror as the heavy keg crushes him. But the danger is far from over.  The wagon rocks along with one wheel half-destroyed.  Willow whips the reins and looks over his shoulder.  Steam-rolling toward them is the war chariot! The Nockmaar CHARIOT DRIVER stands up and stuffs the reins in his mouth.  He rasise his arm and begins to twirl a deadly weapon, a kind of bolo-blade, over his head. Madmartigan defends himself with a wooden wagon-post. The chariot driver hurls the whistling blade:  CHONK! It lodges in the post.  Madmartigan tugs.  So does the chariot driver.  Back and forth, the wagons smashing up each other.
