<L>__{interior registrar's office}
<A>__{sealed from the corridor by a pair of doors, two clerks sit in an office mostly cleared of employees. brenna hands the slip to a clerk.}
<D>__{clerk #2 i will be right back.}
<A>__{she disappears into the rear area.}
<C>__{brenna}
<P>__{(to other clerk)}
<D>__{do you have a drinking fountain? clerk #3 around the corner.}
<A>__{brenna steps around and takes a drink. she looks into her reflection on the stainless steel and spends a moment fiddling with her hair.}
<B>__{the clerk}
<A>__{still hasn't returned. brenna drums her fingers on the counter top and looks around the office. the second clerk is also gone. brenna sees something unfamiliar on the second clerk's desk. she steps over to it. it is a large blood stain. brenna shoots a glance to the double doors. they're closed. brenna rushes to the doors. someone's locked them. she struggles with the handles, then turns to see the knight walking to her with his stained sword. with a scream she kicks a rolling office chair into him and runs down an opposite corridor.}
<B>__{the knight}
<A>__{flings the chair aside and knocks open the door with a slam of his palm.}
<B>__{brenna}
<A>__{has run out of corridor. she looks back at the knight closing the distance. crying in fear, she frantically searches for a way out. the knight is nearly upon her. in desperation she runs into a janitorial closet, closing its heavy door.}
<B>__{the closet}
<A>__{is dark and full of old paint cans and mops. her breathing is at a panic.}
<B>__{the knight}
<A>__{tries the door handle. stepping back, he lifts his sword and hammers it deep into the wood.}
<C>__{brenna}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{oh god...}
<A>__{he strikes again. and again. splinters smack against surround ing walls.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{go away! oh god, go away!}
<A>__{crying hysterically, brenna presses herself against the far wall, sliding to the floor in a crouch.}
<B>__{the knight}
<A>__{steps back and gives the door a last two fisted swing. brenna screams. the door collapses.}
