<L>__{interior taffey's bar night}
<A>__{crowded in here. bongo music. deckard is at the bar sitting next to a big bellied man in a black beard who's looking through a viewer. on the small stage in the background amazing rama is eating razor blades, a part of her juggling routine. deckard leaves the bar and walks down a hall towards a door at the rear.}
<L>__{interior taffey's office night}
<A>__{taffey's what's referred to in the trade as a "chicken hawk" collector of young girls. it must be so, there's one in the bed. thin, pale, about thirteen years old, eyes rolled up under her fluttering eyelids, wires attached to her forehead, lying flat on her back in taffey's crowded little room. taffey's a little fella with wide hips and narrow shoulders, wears a jet black toupe and has a face like a seal. but at the moment he's not present. there's a knock at the door, then the sound of a toilet flushing. taffey comes out of the bathroom, heart pounding under his polyester bathrobe, and approaches the door like the guilty fucker he is. he looks through the peeper. deckard is out there holding up his i.d.}

<D>__{taffey lewis?}
<C>__{taffey}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{can i come in?}
<A>__{there is a pause lasting the time it takes taffey not to think of a way to say no. the door opens and deckard enters. except for the drool coming out of the corner of her mouth, and the fluttering eye lids, venus doesn't move a muscle.}
<C>__{taffey}
<D>__{excuse my niece there... she's studying for an exam.}
<A>__{deckard takes the identikit hard copies our of his pocket and pushing some junk out of the way, fans them out on the table.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i'd like you to take a look at these pictures.}
<C>__{taffey}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{taffey bends down really close, peering at the pictures from about two inches away.}
<C>__{taffey}
<D>__{you see i lost my contacts a couple of days ago around here somewhere and my sight is a little... what am i supposed to be looking for?}
<C>__{deckard}

<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{book the good ones for where?}
<C>__{taffey}
<D>__{lots of places. the tours, the clubs, the silicone shows, private parties.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{what shows?}
<C>__{taffey}
<D>__{silicone valley. lots of these science guys never leave that place. we book two shows a month in there. those big time techs and bio guys might be real high zoners up here, but when it comes to the arts, they like it loud and lewd.}
<A>__{it's starting to get a little gooey. deckard tips his head good night and backs out of the door.}
