<L>__{46 exterior zowie's dog run night}
<A>__{moving through zowie's enclosed pen, we see no sign of the dog. reaching the door, we find that the wood around the bottom hinge has been chewed through. the base of the door is ajar, just enough for a dog to have slipped through.}
<L>__{exterior rabbit cages night}
<A>__{in the still of the night, gus' rabbit pens sit unattended. and then we hear the tinkling of dog tags. snoozing rabbits awaken as zowie lumbers into frame. zowie rises on his hind legs, pressing his paws to a cage. blue sparks fly as zowie is jolted with the electrical charge.}
