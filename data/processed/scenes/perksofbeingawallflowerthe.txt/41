<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{charlie... this is a party.}
<A>__{the music blasts. charlie's eyes are our guide. as they walk through the crowd, you can smell it. stale beer and cigarette smoke. high school parties. the room is packed with kids playing quarters. others pouring vodka into a watermelon.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{this is what fun looks like.}
<A>__{patrick smiles when he spots two friends.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{you ready to meet some desperate women?}
<A>__{mary elizabeth and alice (both 17) sit on the sofa together. mary elizabeth is smart, a little overweight, and extremely bossy. alice will figure out that she's a lesbian in college. right now, she just likes movies and is mary elizabeth's "beta female."}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{here, have a seat. hey, ladies, meet charlie. charlie, meet ladies.}
<A>__{they shake hands and say their hellos.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{this is charlie's first party ever. so, i expect nice, meaningful, heartfelt blow jobs from both of you.}
<C>__{mary elizabeth}
<D>__{patrick, you're such a dick.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{where the hell did you go?}
<C>__{mary elizabeth}
<D>__{the dance was a little boring, don't you think?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{you're so selfish. we looked everywhere for you. you could have told someone.}
<C>__{mary elizabeth}
<D>__{cry me a river.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{how is it that you got meaner since}
<C>__{mary elizabeth}
<D>__{just lucky i guess.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i think you're doing something wrong.}
<C>__{mary elizabeth}
<D>__{or something very right.}
<A>__{patrick and mary elizabeth laugh at their banter, just as sam calls out from the other side of the room.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{hey! look who's here!}
<A>__{the party turns, and charlie sees brad hays, the quarterback, enter with sam and bob. patrick approaches them. charlie sits on the beat up couch next to the girls. he's shocked.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{is that brad hays?}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{yeah. he comes here sometimes.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{but he's a popular kid.}
<C>__{mary elizabeth}
<P>__{(offended)}
<D>__{then, what are we?}
<A>__{charlie tries to think of something, but he can't. the girls turn, ignoring him. bob approaches with a tray.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{charlie, you look like you could use a brownie.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{thank you. i was so hungry at the dance. i was going to go to king's, but i didn't really have any time. thanks.}
<A>__{bob smiles. mary elizabeth gives alice a knowing glance. charlie bites into the brownie. the icing gushing between his teeth. the image goes up into the smoke like an inhale as he chews and chews and chews.}
