<L>__{exterior office cabin night}
<A>__{alice and bill are on the porch of one of the cabins. to the left of the door is a small sign that reads: "office." bill tries the door, but cannot open it.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{sucker's locked. who's got the key?}
<A>__{alice ignores the question, bends down beside the cabin and comes up with a short 2x4. she crosses to the door and smashes through one of the window panes. she puts her arm through the broken glass, unlocks the door and enters. bill follows. the camera continues to watch them from outside the cabin. they turn on a light and cross to a phone on steve christy's desk. bill picks up the receiver, listens, clicks the switch on the desk set several times.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{it's dead. try the pay phone.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{do you have a dime? a quarter?}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{no. there must be some in the desk somewhere.}
<A>__{they fumble through the desk to find some change. bill finds some in the postage drawer. he then crosses over to a pay phone mounted on the wall. the camera moves to the cornice of the building where the phone line exits. it follows the link up the side of the cabin to the junction where the power and phone lines come in from the pole. here we see a dangling phone cable which has been recently cut. over, we hear the sound of a quarter dropping in the dead telephone.}
<C>__{alice }
<D>__{hello? hello? this damn thing's dead, too.}
