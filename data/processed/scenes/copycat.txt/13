<L>__{interior rifle range day}
<B>__{muzzle of semi automatic pistol blasts nine shots almost directly into camera. a beat of silence...}
<A>__{the target: it is a silhouette of a man's head and torso; centered in the right side of the upper chest, near the shoulder, is a small red circle. still smoking, the holes from the bullets are scattered all over the chest, and none in the circle.}
<C>__{m.j. }
<D>__{my third grade teacher at the convent shot better than that.}
<A>__{the shooter, ruben goetz, and partner m.j.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{yeah, but she had divine guidance.}
<A>__{we now take in the shooter, ruben, and his companion m.j. halloran. m.j. is a small, deceptively vulnerable looking young woman. she is neat, buttoned down, crisp. m.j. appears to be about twenty five. she is, in fact, thirty four and a homicide inspector with the rank of sergeant. she is usually dressed in slacks and a loose sweater or an oversize jacket that helps make her appear even smaller and younger than she is. ruben goetz is also in homicide, about twenty six and junior in authority to m.j. ruben is good looking, good humored and laid back. he has a cellular phone attached to his belt. m.j. pulls the line that dollies the target back to them,}
<B>__{and ruben replaces it with another as they talk.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{i'd feel a whole lot safer with sister loretta for my backup. look at this guy: you shredded him!}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{well, he's dead, he can't hurt me now.}
<A>__{the target is rigged; they pull the line that dollies it back to shooting position.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{it's sloppy shooting. it's in character, ruben, but unnecessary. and bad for your career.}
<A>__{ruben lets off three quick shots: they cluster nearer the circle. m.j. looks at him in surprise.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{i've been practicing. now can i kiss your tummy?}
<A>__{m.j. hides her smile as she prepares her weapon for her turn.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{perp's holding a hostage, the shoulder on his gun hand is gonna be exposed.}
<A>__{sound: a cellular phone (on rubens' belt). m.j. holds her fire.}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{answer it.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{i'm sure she thinks it is. aren't you at least interested in which one it is?}
<A>__{she's lost her concentration lowered the gun; now as he answers, she raises her gun and aims...}
<C>__{ruben}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{i'm here, where are you?...}
<A>__{heeeeyyy ! what a surprise! no. on}
<D>__{duty, have to call you back... you, too, you too. my god, you made my day.}
<A>__{he hits the "end" button...}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{you hit the brachial nerve...}
<A>__{she fires! the shots make a perfect heart around the circle, inside his looser pattern. one final shot strikes exactly in the middle!}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{you're good enough you'll never have to kill anyone. i joined the cops to save lives, not waste them.}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{you know, m.j., when i watch you shoot, i realize i've got a little problem with my stance... could you just move over here and critique my legs?}
<A>__{he slaps his thigh where he indicates the trouble might be. she is unloading her weapon...}
<C>__{m.j.}
<D>__{the problem is between your legs. you told your shrink about that?}
<A>__{she is unloading and cleaning up. ruben doing the same...}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{i tell my shrink about you , sergeant. i tell him you're the top cop of my dreams.}
<A>__{ruben has been gathering up his box of doughnuts, from which he has nibbled during the preceding... he drops them, picks one up off the floor and sticks it in his mouth...}
<C>__{m.j.}
<P>__{(putting away her gear)}
<D>__{don't take that mess in the car.}
<A>__{they're on the move; as they go away from us...}
<C>__{ruben}
<D>__{he's in love with you already...}
