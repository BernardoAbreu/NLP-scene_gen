<A>__{as peter (now called dyle) leaves reggie's room and closes the door. he pauses for a moment, listening, hears nothing, then bends down and starts pulling at a loose thread in one of his socks. as usual, the thread unravels and unravels and unravels some more until it seems that the entire sock has come unknit. now, taking the long thread, he bends down near the door and, taking his tie pin, attaches one end of the thread to the bottom of reggie's door. he then runs the thread along the floor to his door (next door) and works it underneath.}
