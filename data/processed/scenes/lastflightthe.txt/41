<L>__{exterior avenue casimir perier later that day}
<A>__{passerbys carry umbrellas on this rainy day. a taxi cab pulls up to a sidewalk cafe la regence, according to the awning that covers the little iron tables. cary emerges from the cab and pays off the driver as nikki hurries under the awning. cary joins her and, after a word to the driver ("restez ici."), looks at the rain.}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(to nikki)}
<D>__{perhaps we'd better stay here a while till it clears up.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{could we sit down here, do you suppose?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{i think so. would you like something to drink?}
<A>__{they move toward the cafe. as cary hangs up his hat, a waiter arrives.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{what should i drink now, do you suppose?}
<A>__{cary orders the drinks as nikki moves to sit at a table.}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(to the waiter)}
<D>__{deux picon citrons.}
<A>__{the waiter acknowledges this and heads inside, calling out the order to his bartender. cary joins nikki at the table and sits down. she removes her gloves and fixes her face while he takes out a cigarette and lights it under the following:}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{picon citrons?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{very refreshing. make you laugh and play.}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{that's what you always promise.}
<P>__{(suddenly serious)}
<D>__{cary, why does shep lambert go on drinking so desperately?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{don't we all?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{not like shep.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, shep has that tic under his eye, you know. takes a lot of drinks to keep that quiet.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{but isn't there some kind of treatment or something?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{shep could never stand a long course of treatment. drinking's the only corrective so far as he's concerned. he's found out the tic doesn't work when he's tight. so he stays tight.}
<A>__{the waiter arrives with the drinks. as he spritzes seltzer water into their glasses, cary leans over to light a cigarette for nikki. the waiter leaves and they drink.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{seems such a pity. how did he get the tic?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{in the war.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i know. but how?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, it's not very romantic.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{well, don't tell me if you don't want to.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, you see, a tic is a nervous habit.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{lice under his bandages.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{he had the devil of a time. he nearly lost his mind. so you'll have to excuse him a little.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{i'm so sorry for shep.}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, don't let him know it.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{well, isn't he going home? not ever?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{not ever. not in his dark glasses anyway.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{can't something be done for him?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{he'll have to be reborn.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{how's he going to end?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{well, how are you going to end? how am i going to end? how is anyone going to end? how's your picon citron go?}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{it goes fine. but doesn't anything make any difference to you?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{not now. a long time ago, perhaps, when i was a little boy.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{tell me, where were you little?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{in minnesota. on a farm.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{were you happy then, cary?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{i think so.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{tell me, what was there to be happy about on a farm in minnesota?}
<C>__{cary}
<P>__{(lost in thought)}
<D>__{ohhh, thorn apple trees in blossom. the smell of burning leaves in the fall. the sound of horses' hoofs on the road.}
<P>__{(looks at nikki)}
<D>__{did you ever dig up an indian mound or uncover a nest of baby field mice? or explore old trunks in an attic? listen to the moaning of the telephone wires in the winter wind? see a gypsy caravan?}
<C>__{nikki}
<P>__{(enthralled)}
<D>__{so that's why you were happy. on account of apple blossoms and field mice and telephone wires and gypsy caravans and old trunks and things?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{that's right.}
<A>__{nikki exhales, drinks, looks at cary and shakes her head.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{but aren't you going back? not ever?}
<C>__{cary}
<D>__{would you like another picon citron before you go? the rain is lifting.}
<A>__{nikki finishes the last of her drink.}
<C>__{nikki}
<D>__{no. i'm ready now.}
<A>__{cary leaves some money, nikki gathers her things. they rise and walk off.}
