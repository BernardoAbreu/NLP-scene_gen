<L>__{interior sofia's house (dominican republic) night}
<A>__{sofia on the phone. we intercut : between her and miguel in his bedroom, his injured ankle elevated on a pillow.}
<C>__{sofia}
<D>__{how'd you play tonight?}
<C>__{miguel}
<P>__{(hesitant)}
<D>__{good, good.}
<C>__{sofia}
<D>__{i bet you have lots of groupies waiting for you after your games.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{i have a few.}
<C>__{sofia}
<D>__{a few?}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{just kidding. i mean i would, but none of these white girls speak spanish. marcos plays in arizona. lots of mexicans; everyone speaks spanish. he has like fifteen girlfriends.}
<C>__{sofia}
<D>__{shut up!}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{he's probably lying though.}
<C>__{sofia}
<D>__{i bet he's lying.}
<A>__{a beat, as miguel shifts gears...}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{jorge went to new york.}
<C>__{sofia}
<D>__{to the yankees?}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{no. our team cut him loose. he's got a cousin there... i don't know what he's going to do...}
<C>__{sofia}
<D>__{shit... what about his family?}
<C>__{miguel}
<P>__{(his mind somewhere else)}
<D>__{it's not right. he got injured playing for them. they owe him another chance. he's worked too hard for too long... i mean he's not a horse.}
<A>__{miguel drifts off, and they sit in silence for a beat.}
<C>__{sofia}
<D>__{but you can't let it get to you. you've got nothing to worry about. just keep playing well, and things will be okay.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{yeah... i know. things will be okay.}
<A>__{miguel looks off, not so sure.}
