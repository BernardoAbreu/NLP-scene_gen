<A>__{louis and eleanor approach a set of double doors.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{we are facing imminent disaster.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i take full responsibility if you hyperventilate or fainterior}
<A>__{they enter the room.}
<L>__{interior meeting room continuous}
<A>__{at a lectern, behind which a banner reads "league of women voters," the chairwoman sees them and waves them forward.}
<C>__{chairwoman}
<D>__{ah, here she is now. ladies, mrs. franklin roosevelt.}
<A>__{a small crowd of about two dozen women offer up polite, but scant applause for eleanor.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{good afternoon. i am so pleased to be invited here today.}
<P>__{(looking down at her cards)}
<D>__{too often....}
<A>__{a photographer snaps a picture which throws eleanor off.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{too often...}
<A>__{she stops. the pause is deadly. louis looks ready to jump out a window. eleanor continues, her voice still pitched too high.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{too often the great decisions are originated and given form in bodies made up wholly of men...}
<A>__{slowly, she begins to find her voice.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{so that whatever political value women have to offer is shunted aside... without expression. this is a mistake.}
<A>__{she looks up from her cards and stares at the audience... and for the first time speaks spontaneously.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{i think this might be the reason i am having such a difficult time giving voice to my own thoughts here today.}
<A>__{the immediacy of her self effacing comment charms the room.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{i'm reminded of what someone once said about looking at an elephant. that it is impossible to ever see an entire elephant from one place you must walk around it. if our elected leaders are to be truly effective then they must be willing to go out of their way to look beyond what is right in front of them. to see the entire elephant. and for that... they need our help.}
<A>__{the ladies applaud her, much to her relief. louis beams.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{at a reception following the speech, eleanor and the chairwoman are drinking tea.}
<C>__{chairwoman}
<D>__{that was so moving, mrs. roosevelt. the child welfare amendment could use someone with your passion. you must consider being our spokesperson.}
<A>__{eleanor looks to louis who nods.}
<C>__{eleanor}
<D>__{oh. it would be an honor.}
<C>__{chairwoman}
<D>__{wonderful.}
