<L>__{exterior freeform swimming pool jackie and george night}
<A>__{lie side by side on deck chairs at the end of the pool. the house and upper grounds are obscured by neat rows of hedges and all sorts of random shrubbery. jackie and george watch the twins splash and flounce around in the jacuzzi with a couple of androgenous men. the twins stand up in the jacuzzi, arm in arm and half move, half throw themselves to another end of the jacuzzi. jackie smiles. she stretches, yawns.}

<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{well of course. who loves a big fanny on a man?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{not me, pal.}
<A>__{jackie laughs. the twins have gotten onto some sort of splashing contest with the boys. water hits george and jackie. they're hit again. they shrug, george rises, takes jackie's hand. they walk on around the pool, beside and along a maze of hedgerows.}
