<L>__{exterior street (matrix) day}
<A>__{the phone booth is obliterated. miraculously, choi and the woman are still under the cover of the jacket. throwing the smoking jacket off them, choi screams in agony as he grasps the smoldering stump of his right shoulder. the arm is history. the woman looks on, her eyes as wide as dinner plates. shaking, she falls back, still staring.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{you werent lucky.}
<A>__{morpheus, niobe, and trinity rush to him, picking him up on his feet. choi is screaming and laughing. someone grabs his smoldering coat, dragging it along. choi stares at the ex flame as they cart him away. his eyes are crazy.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{you still want me to call you? ha ha ha!}
<A>__{as they struggle down the street, choi starts to walk more on his own. people run from the scene, screaming.}
<D>__{cu the four of them.}
<A>__{morphues looks at something off screen and frowns. he pulls to the left.}
<C>__{morpheus}
<D>__{this way.}
<A>__{tanks and troops are filling into the street ahead of them, coming from around the corner. they turn onto a different street. this street, too, is filling with troops. worse, its being lead by agent brown.}
<C>__{niobe}
<D>__{tanks, or agents?}
<C>__{trinity}
<D>__{tanks.}
<C>__{choi}
<D>__{yeah, tanks a lot.}
<A>__{they break. choi stands on his own, and they run back onto the street with the tanks. cu: tanks three abrams stop in the street. their turrets swing into place with terrifying quickness and precision. at once, they open fire with their main cannons and machines guns. fire flowers blaze from the death machines, sending a typhoon of lead down the street. troops filed between the tanks pull their triggers and dont let go. everything in the street is shredded and blown away, as though it was hit by a high power pressure hose. with unearthly speed, everyone breaks for the sides of the street, except for choi. he stands amid it all as the tracers come closer to his body. he raises his machine gun with his good arm, and lays into the enemy. tracer rounds kick away from his gun, ripping straight back into the wall of soldiers. his rounds deflect off the sloped armor of the tanks, recoils pile into the flesh of troops. he rakes his fire into the enemy bodies. cu: choi tracers zoom in on him. a tank round blasts by, and the wall of air kicks him to his side. he continues to fire even as a bullet, followed by another, blasts through the middle of his body. more and more bullets smack into him, blasting chunks of meat and viscera out the back.}
