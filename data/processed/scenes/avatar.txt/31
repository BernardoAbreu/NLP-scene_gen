<L>__{interior ops center dusk}
<A>__{it looks like an air traffic control tower, with lots of screens and bay windows showing the whole complex. administrator parker selfridge takes a ball from a newly opened case of titleists and sets it on the floor. selfridge is young, charismatic, focused. some would say ruthless. he assumes the stance and lines up his putt, toward a practice cup across the control room floor. he glances up as grace strides toward him.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{parker, i used to think it was benign neglect, but now i see you're intentionally screwing us.}
<C>__{selfridge}
<D>__{grace. you know i enjoy our little talks.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i need a research assistant, not some jarhead dropout.}
<A>__{selfridge looks down and hits the ball. grace kicks the practice cup aside, and the ball rolls past. selfridge looks at her with a sigh.}
<C>__{selfridge}
<D>__{actually, we got lucky with him.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{lucky? how is this in any way lucky?}
<A>__{as selfridge saunters over to retrieve the ball }
<C>__{selfridge}
<D>__{well lucky your guy had a twin brother, and lucky the brother wasn't an oral hygienist or something. a marine we can use. i'm assigning him to your team as security escort.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{the last thing i need is another trigger happy asshole out there!}
<C>__{selfridge}
<D>__{look, you're supposed to be winning the hearts and minds of the natives. isn't that the whole point of your little puppet show? if you look like them, if you talk like them, they'll trust you?}
<A>__{selfridge crosses to his office, behind a glass wall nearby. grace follows.}
<C>__{selfridge}
<D>__{but after how many years? relations with the indigenous are only getting worse.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{that tends to happen when you use machine guns on them.}
<A>__{on selfridge's desk is a magnetic base, and hovering in mid air, in the invisible field, is a lump of metallic rock. pure unobtanium. he grabs it and holds it up between thumb and forefinger, in front of grace's eyes.}
<C>__{selfridge}
<D>__{this is why we're here. unobtanium. because this little gray rock sells for twenty million a kilo. no other reason. this is what pays for the party. and it's what pays for your science. comprendo?}
<A>__{he places it back in the magnetic field.}
<C>__{selfridge}
<D>__{those savages are threatening our whole operation. we're on the brink of war and you're supposed to be finding a diplomatic solution. so use what you've got and get me some results.}
