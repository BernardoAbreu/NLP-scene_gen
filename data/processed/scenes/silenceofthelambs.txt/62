<L>__{interior funeral home back corridor day}
<A>__{a young deputy, several state troopers, and a sheriff are all waiting, as crawford and clarice enter. the dim, cluttered corridor doubles as storage space there's a treadle sewing machine, a soft drink machine, a tricycle. the music is closer. crawford shakes hands with the sheriff.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{sheriff perkins? jack crawford, fbi... this is officer starling. we appreciate your phoning us.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<P>__{(grim, unsociable)}
<D>__{i didn't call you. that was somebody from the state attorney's office... 'for you do a thing else, i'm gon' find out if this girl's local. it could just be somethin' that outside elements has dumped on us.}

<D>__{sheriff, this, ah this type of sex crime has some aspects i'd rather discuss just between the two of us. know what i mean?}
<A>__{he indicates clarice with his eyes. the sheriff hesitates, nods, then lets crawford guide him into a small office, closing the door behind them. muffled words from there.}
<B>__{clarice}
<A>__{burning at this slight, is left alone with the troopers, who peek at her with shy curiosity. she pulls her blazer a bit tighter, self conscious about her bulging shoulder holster.}
<B>__{angle on the office door}
<A>__{as, after a few more moments, the sheriff and crawford emerge. the sheriff, still not very happy, addresses his deputy.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{oscar, run fetch dr. akin from the chapel. and tell lamar to come on when he's done playin' that music.}
