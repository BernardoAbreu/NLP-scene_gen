<L>__{exterior movie theater 1980's night}
<A>__{a brightly lit marquee reads, "revenge of the nerds." the doors to the theater open and a crowd pours onto the street. harvey, joyce and toby are among them. toby proudly wears a "genuine nerd" button on his striped shirt.}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{i agree with toby. i think it's a story of hope and tolerance.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{yes. it's about time that the people who get picked on get to be the heroes.}
<A>__{harvey scrunches his face in disbelief.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{it's an entertaining flick an' i can see why you like it toby, but those people on the screen ain't even supposed to be you! they're college students whose parents live in big houses in the suburbs. they're gonna get degrees, get good jobs and stop being nerds.}
<A>__{joyce hits harvey.}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{harvey, what did i say about loud talking? use your inside voice.}
<C>__{harvey}
<P>__{(whispering loudly)}
<D>__{look toby, the guys in that movie are not 28 year old file clerks who live with their grandmothers in an ethnic ghetto.}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{that's enough, harvey.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{they didn't get their computers like you did by trading in a bunch of box tops and $49.50 at the supermarket.}
<A>__{joyce folds her arms in disapproval. toby starts to laugh.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{you're funny harvey.}
<A>__{harvey looks at him, disappointed. he shakes his head.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{sure, toby. go to the movies and daydream, but "revenge of the nerds" ain't reality. it's just hollywood bullshit.}
