<A>__{in the background we hear jay leno s monologue from the tonight show. a small lamp and the glow from a computer screen illuminates sebastian caine, late twenties with the shabby good looks of a perpetual grad student. wiry framed and wearing only boxer shorts, sebastian sips coffee from an einstein coffee mug. he peers at a complex computer rendered molecule displayed on his screen. he pecks a few keys and the molecule shifts slightly, then falls apart. sebastian pulls a twinkie from a hostess box, unwraps the cellophane and sucks it down. he attacks the keyboard with renewed vigor. another molecule appears on the screen. sebastian s fingers fly across the keyboard. the molecule blinks on and off, it trembles and twists apart.}
