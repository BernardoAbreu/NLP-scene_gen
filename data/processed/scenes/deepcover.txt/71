<A>__{on the pyramid chart there's a black border around ivy's photo, as around eddie's. a photo of hull is now on the board beside the one of elias. hull stares out the window, lost in thought.}

<P>__{(dismissive)}
<D>__{synthetic shit?? sounds like a 20 20 segment...}
<A>__{hull shrugs: it's not that important. carver turns to his real interest.}
