<D>__{what're you now, a desperado? put the guns down.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i told you, i'm not going back.}
<A>__{he raises the guns hip high and we hear sounds behind karen, but she's quick to raise her hand, though she doesn't turn or look around.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{don't do this. please.}
<A>__{they stand there staring at each other.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{no more time outs.}
<A>__{he raises the guns. she sadly shakes her head.}

<D>__{karen, i told you not to }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{wait, i know him okay?}

<D>__{i wish things were different. i'm sorry, jack.}
<A>__{foley looks like he's in pain. he watches as she walks back down the stairs. as a couple of uniform cops rush past her and pick up foley, a shaky ripley staggers into the foyer.}
<C>__{midge}
<D>__{richard!}
<A>__{she comes running down the stairs into his arms. they embrace. he looks at foley over her shoulder...}
