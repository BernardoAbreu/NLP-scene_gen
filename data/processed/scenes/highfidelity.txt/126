<A>__{rob and laura walk the cement breakfront.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{... like mexico. or jamaica. or new york, even.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{hey, great idea. what i will do is, tomorrow i will get a hold of a box full of mint elvis presley 78s on the sub label, and i will pay for it that way.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i will pay for you. even though you owe me money. we have to do something with the money i earn. i need to. i deserve it. you can just think of it as winning the lottery.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{fantastic. the girlfriend lottery.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{money does not matter. i do not care how much you earn. i'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{but it wasn't supposed to be like this. when i met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{how? how were we the same people?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{well, you were the kind of person who came to the artful dodger and i was the kind of person who deejayed at the artful dodger. you wore jeans and t shirts, and so did i. and i still do, and you don't.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{because i'm not allowed to. i still do, after work. so, what? should we just break up? is that what you're saying? because if you are, i'm going to run out of patience.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{no, but...}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{but what?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{but why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years i've known you. if we've grown apart, then i'm the one who's done the growing, and all i've done is change jobs.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{and hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i can't go to work with my hair dyed pink. and i can afford to go shopping more now, and i've met a couple people i like over the last year or so.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{you're tougher.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{more confident, maybe.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{harder.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{less neurotic. are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i'm alright.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{yeah, you're alright. but you're certainly not happy. so what happens if you get happy? and yes i know that's the title of an elvis costello album, i use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. should we split up because i'm used to you being miserable? what happens if you, i don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? time for a new girlfriend?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{you're being stupid.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{how? what would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice?}
<A>__{rob is silent.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{all i'm saying is, you have to allow for things to happen to people, most of all to yourself. otherwise, what's the use?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{no use.}
