<L>__{215 216 close on logan and jessica}
<A>__{as jessica takes the ankh from her neck fumbling with the chain.}
<C>__{jessica}
<P>__{(breathlessly)}
<D>__{every key only works once...and only a lastday key must open this door.... they said it would fit but....}
<A>__{she tries to fit the ankh into the glowing one, but her hand shakes. logan tries to steady her and in helping, she drops it into the dark pool of water. they fall to their knees, searching desperately. then logan remembers.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{wait i have the one i took from the runner.}
<A>__{sound: the same as before as logan searches his pockets for the runner's ankh. logan finds it just as the whirring sound has stopped again...and the light has gone out again in the center of the wheel. as logan and jessica wait for the sound, etcetera to repeat again another tremendous explosion is heard rocking everything. in the distance, jessica can see the shadow of a figure approaching. as the sound, etcetera, repeat s once more...logan pushes the ankh into the lighted center of the wheel. the ankh fuses and the lighted center becomes brighter as the door opens. there is a hesitation...in which logan turning his head back... realizes what he has done and is shaken. as the shadowed figure looms larger:}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{there's no turning back, is there?}
<A>__{logan turns and pushes jessica through the door... following her... as the door closes and they are:}
<B>__{on the other side}
<A>__{now, they can still hear the sound, etcetera for the last time. beyond the lock is the ruins of a vast undersea complex in which food was raised and harvested. what we see is an endless shadowy labyrinth of breeding pens which stretch off into the green darkness a kind of mammoth aquarium with catwalks and ramps intersecting the huge tanks. the levels are multiple and everything is slimed, rusted, rotted and wet. in the tanks themselves are shoals of fish, gardens of seaweed, etc. the machinery for harvesting and winnowing has long since gone to rust and visible in the great tanks are the wrecks of vessels and gear the kind of stuff cousteau and co. are using now. footing is dangerous a slip from any catwalk means a plunge into water and some of the walkways are well under water anyhow. from an invisible ceiling comes a steady dripping and everything is crusted and smells of salt and decay and life in the darkness.}
<B>__{with francis}
<A>__{as he arrives at the door, the ankh glowing as before. but francis has a light. he examines the door with it, and as it lights the pool of water on the ground, it picks out jessica's ankh. francis stoops, gets it and looks from it to the one glowing}
<B>__{logan and jessica}
<A>__{bewildered uncertain, as their eyes adjust to the dim light. finally, logan gestures ''this way" and sets out. (note: the action of the sequence is the action of people groping through a labyrinth. they go along, gripping a rail where possible, sometimes sinking deep into water, sometimes rising above it. they run into blind endings and retrace to the last junction always trying for what looks driest and seems to stretch farthest along the great wall...)}
