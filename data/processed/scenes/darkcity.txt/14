<A>__{a large faded billboard advertisement on a building facade. a portrait of a smiling woman clutching a product called, "lump o" a cereal box carton. the camera moves in steadily, rises upwards, closer on the womanis face, finally enters a hole at the centre of her}

<L>__{interior stair well}
<A>__{a raftered room on the other side of the billboard. camera tilts to a convoluted staircase at the base, the shadow of a man runs. feet pace rapidly. tilt up to reveal white. camera follows as he tries to lose himself from possible pursuers. he steps through a low archway into a back alley, rounds a corner. a dead end. white stops, looks around, then up. heis breathing heavily, trying to catch his breath. he starts to shake. above, the walls stretch into darkness. an opening way up there he can see stars. something dark crosses the gap of sky. a rushing noise in the distance. wind starts to pick up. trash is being kicked up. a sheet of newspaper wraps around whiteis leg. he tries to kick it away repeatedly but it wonit come off. he bends down, grabs it to throw it away, but something grabs his eye. he stares at the page for a moment then his legs slip from under him and he falls to the ground. he holds his head like itis going to explode. a whimper deep in his throat. his body is trembling violently. push in tight on the paper on the ground. a front page headline: man hunt continues for serial killer! white looks up terrified. the rushing noise o.s. again.}
<B>__{his p.o.v.}
<A>__{on the wall facing him, a door has appeared where moments before there was nothing. the door creaks open to reveal another door within. this one extends outwards on the end of a lengthening wooden shaft. white, stands quickly, thrusts the newspaper into a pocket. tries to side step the advancing door but itis too late, he can only open it and step through, to avoid getting pinned to the wall.}
