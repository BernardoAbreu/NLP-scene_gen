<A>__{nick and carol are walking away from the pizza hut, across a huge parking lot, toward a large mall. cars circle past them, searching for close spots.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(doggedly)}
<D>__{it was the drive that killed us. san antonio to seattle is just too many hours in a car. if we'd have flown, we would've made it.}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{no...}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{things were all right in bed.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{but the rest of the time they were... awful.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(hurt)}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(flatly)}
<D>__{nick. we couldn't stand each other. we stopped in enfield and just stayed.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{why didn't you go on to seattle? it was your car.}
<A>__{carol stops. on her face, the answer to his question is clear she was stuck on nick then and she's still stuck on him now. but she'd never let him know that.}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{big trees scare me.}
<A>__{she starts walking. nick hurries up beside her. they walk side by side for a few paces before the shotdown nick comes up with a new ploy to win favor.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(casually)}
<D>__{i'm thinking about stealing a t.v.}
