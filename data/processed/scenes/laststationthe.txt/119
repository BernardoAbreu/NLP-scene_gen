<L>__{interior astapovo. stationmaster's house. night.}
<A>__{she steps into the room. for a moment, she seems overwhelmed at the sight of him. she looks at valentin, who nods at her as if to say go on. sofya walks past chertkov without acknowledging him. dushan lets go his hold of tolstoy's wrist and gets out of the chair, out of her way. she approaches her sleeping, husband, the love of her life, her cross, her everything.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{lyovochka!}
<A>__{there is no response. she throws her arms around him.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{please forgive me, my darling!}
<C>__{sasha}
<D>__{mother...}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{i'm a fool.. i'm a selfish woman. but i love you. please believe me. please understand me. please forgive me for all my weakness and badness. please! please! love me!}
<C>__{sasha}
<D>__{mother!}
<A>__{sasha takes her hand, whispers.}
<C>__{sasha}
<D>__{control yourself.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{was i shouting?}
<C>__{sasha}
<D>__{you have to control yourself.}
<A>__{sofya looks around and sits back. strangely, she does control herself. she becomes very still. she takes her husband's hand, begins quietly to speak to him.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{you don't speak, but i hear you.}
<A>__{she carries on two sides of an impossible conversation.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{"do you love me, lyovochka."}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{"never stopped, my little bird."}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{"and you will never stop"}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{"never."}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{"nor ever leave me again."}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{"never, ever again.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{"good...good... let's go home"}
<A>__{she sits very still holding her husband's hand. then, it seems she feels the slightest of movements, the slightest squeeze of her hand. she looks down to see tolstoy open his eyes. he looks at her for a moment, the hint of a smile, then closes his eyes again. valentin sees it, glances at sasha. then, he begins to fight for breath.}
<C>__{dushan}
<D>__{first cessation.}
<A>__{a general sense of panic at the proximity of death. tolstoy fights for a last breath.}
<C>__{dushan}
<D>__{second cessation.}
<A>__{sofya whispers quietly to her dying husband.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{please forgive me if i cry a little now.}
<A>__{tolstoy continues to struggle, then silence, silence. sasha starts to sob. sofya reaches out to her daughter. sasha comes to her mother who holds her. she feels someone next to her. she looks up. it's chertkov.}
<C>__{chertkov}
<D>__{i am sorry, sofya andreyevna.}
<A>__{the most unlikely thing, she pats his hand.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{it's alright. what happens from now on... it will never really matter. not really. everything's finished.}
<A>__{chertkov sits beside them. she turns to dushan.}
<C>__{sofya}
<D>__{dushan, could you tell them your great friend is gone?}
<C>__{dushan}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{he nods, walk out into the dawn light to tell the world leo tolstoy is dead.}
