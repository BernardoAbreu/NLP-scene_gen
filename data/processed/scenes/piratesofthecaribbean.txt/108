<A>__{jack goes to the rail and waits, pretending to look out at the sea. elizabeth, dressed in sailor's clothes to excellent effect, joins him.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{you didn't tell commodore norrington everything.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{nor did you, i noticed.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{he might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{exactly.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{these men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i have a plan. if it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one sided.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{what's your plan?}
<C>__{lookout }
<D>__{land ho!}
<A>__{isla de muerta lay dark and menacing on the horizon.}
<C>__{norrington}
<D>__{elizabeth below decks. i will not compromise your safety..}

<C>__{norrington }
<D>__{lieutenant, escort elizabeth to my quarters, and make sure she stays there.}
<A>__{norrington gazes through his spyglass, at the island. jack watches with some amusement as elizabeth is escorted away.}
<C>__{norrington }
<D>__{i don't like the situation, mister sparrow. the island is riddled with caves. i will not put my men at a disadvantage.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{funny, i was thinking along those lines. how about you let me go in alone, and while you're setting up an ambush, i will trick the pirates out to you.}
<C>__{norrington}
<D>__{you would do that?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{they left me stranded. twice. what have you got to lose?}
<C>__{norrington}
<P>__{(looks at him)}
<D>__{nothing i wouldn't be please to be rid of.}
