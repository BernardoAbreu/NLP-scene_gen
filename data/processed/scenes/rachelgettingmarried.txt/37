<D>__{he had thrown away his shoes and i was like "mom's going to kill me" because i had no idea where his shoes were but he was so happy about it. and he had his red socks and he was running around kicking up the leaves. you know in movies where they show a person's high or whatever and the camera careens all around? it was like that. but fun. you know. we were having so much fun. we were leaping around in huge piles of leaves. he buried me. i buried him in a big pile. i was on baby sitting detail. he was pretending he was a train. so he was charging through the leaf pile, making tracks, you know? i was the caboose. and he kept going "coal, caboose! coal caboose!" so it's time to go and we're driving home and he's in his car seat still demanding coal, and i couldn't focus and i drove off the bridge. the car went into the lake. i couldn't get him out of his car seat. he drowned.}
