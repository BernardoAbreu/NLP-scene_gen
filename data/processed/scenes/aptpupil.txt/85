<A>__{a series of shots showing todd cleaning up the mess. he is on the stairs sponging up the blood. then we see him skimming the area where the pool of blood was with the shovel. the next shot has him sprinkling fresh dirt over the same area. then, on his knees, he carefully picks up bits of broken glass from the light bulb and drops them into a bucket. in the final shot, todd stands on the steps as his eyes comb the cellar. the shovel has been cleaned and replaced. the floor looks smooth and even. satisfied, he goes upstairs.}
