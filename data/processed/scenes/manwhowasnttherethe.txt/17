<T>__{fade out:}
<B>__{underwater}
<A>__{light glimmers in water. we are drifting down, down, down. we bring in languidly waving arms the arms of a child, waving to keep himself submerged. it is a ten year old boy staring, wide eyed, at something in front of him. bubbles intermittently stream from his open mouth.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{the pansy. a kid diving at a waterhole outside of town had found his car...}
<A>__{the reverse shows the car, also submerged, with creighton tolliver inside, also wide eyed, his hairpiece attached at only one corner, the rest of it waving free.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...they'd winched it out...}
<B>__{tracking}
<A>__{we are tracking laterally across a line of faces: seated men. the men rise.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...and found he'd been beaten, just like big dave said beaten to death...}
<A>__{we arc around a judge entering the chamber through the small door behind his raised bench.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...inside the briefcase were the partnership papers i'd signed...}
<A>__{the judge seats himself and we resume out lateral track on the jury, now reseating itself.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...showing that i'd given him ten grand. for the district attorney...}
<A>__{in response to a prompt from the judge the district attorney rises to read the charge. his voice plays distantly, muted, the words not discernible under the continuing voice over.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...that made it fall into place: i'd gotten doris to steal the money, the pansy had gotten wise somehow, and i'd had to kill him to cover my tracks. i was in a spot. i called in freddy riedenschneider...}
<A>__{riedenschneider rises into frame at the defense table. as he listens to the charge:}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...and signed the house over to him. he said he didn't ordinarily work that cheap, but he figured he owed me something since the last one hadn't played out...}
<A>__{the drone of the d.a. has ended and riedenschneider's echoing voice drops into the hole:}
<C>__{riedenschneider}
<D>__{not guilty, your honor...}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{i tried to tell him the whole story, but riedenschneider stopped me. he said the story made his head hurt, and anyway he didn't see any way of using it without putting me on the hot seat for the murder of big dave...}
<A>__{riedenschneider claps ed reassuringly on the shoulder as he sits next to him. ed still wears a cast on one arm and one leg.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...he told me not to worry, though, said he'd think of something, freddy riedenschneider wouldn't let me down.}
<B>__{jail}
<A>__{we are tracking in on ed, lying on the bunk in his cell.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...they put me on twenty four hour deathwatch...}
<A>__{a reverse track shows a guard on a tilted back straightbacked chair, outside the cell door, staring at ed.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...so that i couldn't cheat justice like they said my wife had done...}
<B>__{courtroom}
<A>__{the district attorney is rising again, this time to address the jury.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...but in front of the jury they had it that doris was a saint; the whole plan had been mine, i was a svengali who'd forced doris to join my criminal enterprise...}
<A>__{the district attorney is pointing at ed.}
<C>__{district attorney}
<D>__{...cynically used his own wife as a cat's paw in a scheme of diabolical cunning...}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{on and on it went, how i'd used doris and then let her take the fall. that stuff smarted because some of it was close to being true...}
<A>__{the district attorney seats himself. the jury's eyes turn to freddy riedenschneider, who studies the tabletop in front of him, either digesting the d.a.'s opening statement, or seeking inspiration for his own.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...and then it was freddy riedenschneider's turn.}
<A>__{riedenschneider rises, paces, begins to talk.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...i gotta hand it to him, he tossed a lot of sand in their eyes. he talked about how i'd lost my place in the universe...}
<C>__{riedenschneider}
<D>__{...a puny player on the great world's stage...}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...how i was too ordinary to be the criminal mastermind the d.a. made me out to be, how there was some greater scheme at work that the state had yet to unravel, and he threw in some of the old truth stuff he hadn't had a chance to trot out for doris...}
<C>__{riedenschneider}
<D>__{...who among us is in a position to say...}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...he told them to look at me look at me close. that the closer they looked the less sense it would all make, that i wasn't the kind of guy to kill a guy, that i was the barber, for christ's sake...}
<A>__{we pan the jury, solemnly listening to riedenschneider.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...i was just like them, an ordinary man, guilty of living in a world that had no place for me, guilty of wanting to be a dry cleaner, sure, but not of murder...}
<A>__{riedenschneider is striding energetically into the foreground to point a finger directly at ed's face.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...he said i was modern man, and if they voted to convict me, well, they'd be practically cinching the noose around their own necks. he told them to look not at the facts but at the meaning of the facts, and then he said the facts had no meaning. it was a pretty good speech, and even had me going...}
<A>__{a tap on the shoulder turns ed around.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...until frankie interrupted it.}
<A>__{frank socks ed, sending him clattering to the floor. a bailiff immediately restrains him, but frank looms over ed, bellowing through tears:}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what kind of man are you? what kind of man are you?}
<A>__{riedenschneider interposes his body between frank's and ed's, loudly protesting:}
<C>__{riedenschneider}
<D>__{move for a mistrial, your honor! move for a mistrial! this outrageous display cannot help but prejudice...}
<A>__{ed moves to get up, but riedenschneider, with a sidelong glance and furtive gesture, motions for him to stay on the floor.}
<C>__{riedenschneider}
<D>__{...and inflame the passions of these twelve fine men and women...}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...well, he got his mistrial, but the well had run dry. there was nothing left to mortgage; riedenschneider went home and the court appointed lloyd garroway...}
<A>__{ed is now standing next to a distinguished older gentleman who enters the plea in the new trial:}
<C>__{garroway}
<D>__{your honor, we plead guilty, with extenuating circumstances.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...who threw me on the mercy of the court. it was my only chance, he said. i guess that meant i never had a chance...}
<A>__{the judge starts droning the sentence:}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{...a menace to society... a predator on his own wife, his business associates, on an innocent young girl... social contract... line crossed... the offender forfeits the right to his own life... i hereby order that you be taken to a place of confinement...}
<B>__{prison hallway}
<A>__{we are tracking down the hall.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{he wasn't buying any of that modern man stuff, or the uncertainty stuff, or any of the mercy stuff either. no, he was going by the book, and the book said i got the chair...}
<A>__{ed is in the cell at the end of the hall, lying on his bunk, hands clasped behind his head.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...so here i am. at first i didn't know how i got here. i knew step by step of course, which is what i've told you, step by step; but i couldn't see any pattern...}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{ed sits at the little table next to his bunk, writing.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...now that i'm near the end, i'm glad that this men's magazine paid me to tell my story. writing it has helped me sort it all out. they're paying five cents a word, so you'll pardon me if sometimes i've told you more than you wanted to know...}
<A>__{recent issues of the magazine, gent, and its sister publication nugget lie on the little desk. their lurid covers depict feature stories like i was abducted by aliens and after ten years of normal life, i discover i am an escaped}
<B>__{lunatic.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...but now, all the disconnected things seems to hook up.}
<A>__{ed sets aside the pen, lies down on his bunk, and closes his eyes.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...that's the funny thing about going away, knowing the date you're gonna die and the men's magazine wanted me to tell how that felt...}
<A>__{we hear a pulsing treble hum. ed opens his eyes. the door to his cell is open. he rises and goes through the door.}
<B>__{prison hallway}
<A>__{ed, alone, walks down the hallway. the pulsing treble hum is louder.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...well, it's like pulling away from the maze. while you're in the maze you go through willy nilly, turning where you think you have to turn, banging into dead ends, one thing after another...}
<B>__{prison yard}
<A>__{ed emerges into the empty prison yard ringed by high stone walls. a hard spotlight shines down from above. ed squints into it.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...but get some distance on it, and all those twists and turns, why, they're the shape of your life. it's hard to explain...}
<A>__{the spotlight is from a hovering flying saucer. we see its revolving underside and, as it irregularly cants, a bit of its top bubble. after spinning briefly, it tips and flies away, carrying the tremolo hum with it.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...but seeing it whole gives you some peace.}
<A>__{ed turns and re enters the prison. ed's cell ed is lying on his bunk, eyes closed, hands clasped behind his head. a hand enters to shake him awake. three men loom over him: two guards and another man wearing a surplice and holding a bible.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...the men's magazine also asked about remorse. yeah, i guess i'm sorry about the pain i caused other people...}
<B>__{prison hallway}
<A>__{he is walking the last mile.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...but i don't regret anything. not a thing. i used to. i used to regret being the barber.}
<A>__{a door at the end opens: an electric chair. straps open, and waiting:}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...i dont know where i'm being taken.}
<A>__{ed is placed in the chair.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...i don't know what waits for me, beyond the earth and sky. but i'm not afraid to go.}
<A>__{a man stoops at his feet. he has a bucket of water and a straight razor. he waggles the razor in the water and starts shaving a patch of ed's calf.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...maybe the things i don't understand will be clearer there, like when a fog blows away...}
<A>__{ed watches as the razor makes the trip from his leg to the bucket of water, which begins to spot with small floating hairs.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...maybe doris will be there.}
<A>__{they are strapping him in, connecting the electrodes.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...and maybe there i can tell her...}
<A>__{the men withdraw.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...all those things...}
<A>__{a thin man in a dark suit and fedora stands by the switch. as he reaches for the switch, ed looks up into the light.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...they don't have words for here.}
