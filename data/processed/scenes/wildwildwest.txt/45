<L>__{interior wanderer parlor car day}
<A>__{the car is like a classy victorian men's club. bar stocked with crystal decanters, a pool table, decorative pistols on the wall, books, etc. gordon, seated in a club chair, looks over as west falls from the ceiling into a seat. he's hot, dusty and very pissed off. he glowers at gordon murderously.}
<C>__{gordon}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{thanks for dropping in.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{forget the bikes, the beards, the fake boobies. put down the needlepoint and let's settle this like men!}
<A>__{he takes off jacket, starts rolling up his sleeves. gordon remains remarkably cool, continues sewing.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{as a matter of clarification, this isn't needlepointerior this is.}
<A>__{he shows him some real needlepointerior}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{right now, i'm putting the final touches on a new invention of my creation. i call it... the impermeable. it's a vest that, when worn under the clothing, can stop any modern bullet fired even at close range.}
<A>__{west draws his gun, aims it at gordon's stomach and cocks the trigger.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{gordon quickly pulls the vest away from his stomach.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{but it hasn't been really tested empirically yet.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{get up!}
<A>__{west takes off his guns and puts them on the table.}
<C>__{gordon}
<P>__{(yawn, yawn)}
<D>__{guns. i find them so primitive and unnecessary... if one has done one's proper planning.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{yeah? how do you feel about a fist?}
<A>__{gordon puts down the impermeable, stands with a weary sigh.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{i must tell you, mr. west, i've always felt that allowing a situation to degenerate into physical violence is a failure on my part.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{well then, 'mr.' gordon, you failed.}
<A>__{whap! west unleashes a lightning punch that drives gordon across the train car. he dabs at his bloody lip.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{i'm sorry, mr. west, you brought this on yourself.}
<A>__{then to west's utter amazement, gordon puts his hands together as if praying while at the same time, crooking his right leg stork like. is this some kind of martial art? then, he bends at the waist, and like a ballet dancer, extends his leg out to the wall and flips a switch. it immediately triggers a leather hammer to swing down from the ceiling. it whacks west on the side of the head, and sends him spinning back onto the pool table. angle on pool table west shakes it off and is about to attack again. gordon calmly pokes a hidden button. suddenly the pool table revolves. west is gone.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{i love this train!}
