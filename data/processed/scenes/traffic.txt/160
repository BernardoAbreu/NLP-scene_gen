<L>__{interior upstairs hallway night}
<A>__{robert walks down the hallway. he steps into caroline's bedroom.}
<L>__{interior caroline wakefield's bedroom continuous}
<A>__{robert stands outside her closed bathroom door. there is nothing, then from the other side of the door, the faint sound of a lighter clicking. again and again, then a}
<B>__{cough.}
<L>__{interior caroline wakefield's bathroom night}
<A>__{caroline sits on the toilet. glamour magazine on her lap. she's wild eyed and paranoid. the exhaust fan is running. the aluminum foil is on the sink. the last little bit of heroin in a wax paper bundle sits beside it. she's listening hard for any sound in the house. what she's wondering is if someone is outside the door listening. she puts a piece of crack on the foil and listens hard once more before lighting it. she does the hit. and seems to feel better. suddenly there's a pounding on the door. the voice of her father muffled through the solid wood.}
<C>__{robert }
<P>__{(muffled by the door)}
<D>__{caroline. open this door immediately.}
<A>__{caroline is up like a shot. she looks around. the pounding on the door gets stronger. she crumples the foil and drops it in the toilet. the bathroom door sounds like it's about to cave inward.}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(faking the best she can)}
<D>__{who is it? i'm going to the bathroom.}
<A>__{she's coping now, full parallel process mode: she dumps the last heroin on the back of her hand and snorts it, checking her nose in the mirror as she reaches for a can of air freshener which she sprays into the air.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{one minute.}
<A>__{she takes the remaining crack, lighters, tubes, little smudgy druggy bits of paraphernalia and carefully places it all in a hiding place above the bathroom cabinet. she pauses a beat, then opens the door, and tries to brush by her father while avoiding his eyes.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{excuse me }
<A>__{robert grabs her by the arms. he pushes her against the wall and looks at her pupils. he looks at her fingernails. the blister on her thumb from working the lighter is red and irritated.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{you're not going anywhere, young lady.}
<A>__{she stands there; she's very high. robert sniffs the air. he throws open cabinets, searching for drugs. he sees the smudge mark on the counter left by the charred aluminum foil.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{where is it? where are the drugs?}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{where are they?}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{fuck you. i wasn't doing anything. you're like the gestapo.}
<A>__{robert kicks the cabinets.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{fuck me? oh, okay. fuck me. fuck you.}
<A>__{robert is losing it. he throws stuff around the bathroom and then, for the first time, looks up. he sees the long light in the box atop the medicine cabinet and it dawns on him.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{i'm going to ask you one time to tell me the truth so that i can help you.}
<A>__{she just stares.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{okay, young lady, that's it.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{like i give a fuck.}
<A>__{robert reaches above the medicine cabinet and pulls out a charred spoon. it confuses him. he throws it into the sink. he pulls out another spoon. he pulls out crumpled bindles, rolled up, encrusted dollar bills, exhausted lighters, a pill bottle, an empty pint of vodka. the detritus of drug addiction keeps on coming, filling up the sink. robert stares at it, the amount and complexity has him momentarily baffled.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{what is wrong with you? what?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you're going away. you're getting help somewhere.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{you can't make me.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{oh, yes i can.}
