<C>__{theo}
<D>__{you know who i am?}
<C>__{kastle}
<D>__{nobody sticks a finger into a bowling ball in this town without miles kastle knowing about it. you don't mind if i have a word with theo, do you bunny? kastle takes theo by the elbow and pulls him away.}
<C>__{kastle}
<D>__{i heard you've been having a little trouble with the congress.}

<C>__{theo}
<D>__{what's with the bad air between you two, mr. kastle?}
<C>__{kastle}
<P>__{(dismissive gesture)}
<D>__{it's nothing, just a slight business imbalance.}
<P>__{(to a seated mother)}
<D>__{how's gloria's thumb?}
<C>__{mother }
<D>__{the blister's worse than last week.}
<C>__{kastle}

<C>__{theo}
<D>__{that's some pinfall. almost a 133 average. her ball's flat, she needs to work on her spin control.}
<C>__{kastle}
<D>__{that's right, didn't you have a slight control problem in a recent tournament,champ?}
<P>__{(to carmelita)}
<D>__{now go take out your "big four", darling.}
<P>__{(to theo)}
<D>__{come on, we're making her nervous.}

<D>__{i get them while they're young. builds loyalty.}
<C>__{mrs. jackson }
<D>__{she hit it, mr. kastle!}
<C>__{kastle}
<P>__{(waving over his shoulder)}
<D>__{four or five years when a girl like that's bowling on the pro tour for team kastle, she'll pay a handsome profit on my investment.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{and the dwarf bowling?}
<A>__{they stop, and kastle pulls theo over to an enormous aquarium near the lounge.}
<C>__{kastle}
<P>__{(making sweeping gesture)}
<D>__{think of this business like a big aquarium. you gotta have some sharks to eat the dirt at the bottom so the guppies can swim free at the top.}
<P>__{(more)}
<C>__{kastle}
<D>__{profits down there, philanthropy up here.}
<P>__{(looks at theo)}
<D>__{besides, it beats the pants off bingo.}

<C>__{kastle}
<D>__{if it springs a leak, it'll be because buzz is making waves.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{what if he wants to get out?}
