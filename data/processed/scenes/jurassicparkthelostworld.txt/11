<L>__{interior hammond's apartment foyer night}
<A>__{in the foyer, ludlow hands malcolm his coat, just a trifle rudely, and shepherds him to the door.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{so, you two were just, uh, telling old campfire stories, were you?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{do me a favor. don't pretend for a second that you and i don't know the truth. you can convince time magazine and the skeptical inquirer of whatever you want, but i was there.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{you signed a non disclosure agreement before you went to the island that expressly forbade you from discussing anything you saw. you violated that agreement.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you cost me my livelihood. that on which i relied to support my children.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{if your university felt you were causing it embarrassment by selling wild stories to hard copy, i hardly see how i am to }
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i didn't tell anything, i told the truth.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{you version of it.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{there are no versions of the truth! this isn't a corporate maneuver, it's my life.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{we made a generous compensatory offer for your injuries.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{it was a payoff and an insult. ingen never }
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{ingen is my livelihood, dr. malcolm, and i will jealously defend its interests. people will know what i want them to know when i want them to know it.}
<A>__{ludlow tosses something to malcolm, hard. it sails across the foyer, upright, and malcolm reaches out and catches it with one hand. it's his cane.}
<C>__{ludlow }
<D>__{don't forget that.}
<A>__{malcolm stares at him for a long moment. finally, he turns and walks away. but he does not out of the apartment. instead, he walks directly past ludlow, crosses the living room, and steps back into hammond's bedroom, closing the door behind him with a determined click.}
