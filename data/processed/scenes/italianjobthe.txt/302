<L>__{interior car carrier night}
<A>__{our camera moves past the three minis parked inside... and stops at the last car in the carrier the jeep wrangler. its rear hatch rises and steve creeps out. looks around. it's safe. he walks over to stella's mini. pops open the trunk revealing a silver haliburton suitcase. he unzips the case. it's filled with stacks and stacks of gold bricks, the exotic face of a balinese girl on each one. steve pulls out a brick, embraces it. he knows his gold. these bricks are real. but as he has a moment with his gold, behind him, the trunks of the other two minis rise in unison. then mashkov rises out of the trunk of the white mini. another ukrainian rises out of the trunk of the blue mini. four more ukrainians slide out from underneath the minis. they cock their m lls.}
<B>__{click click click click click click.}
<A>__{steve hears the sound from behind him. he turns around to see the weapons pointed at him.}
<C>__{mashkov}
<D>__{take out your gun and drop it on the floor.}
<A>__{steve has no choice.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{mashkov}
<D>__{you knew my cousin. yevhen.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i never knew anyone named yevhen.}
<C>__{mashkov}
<D>__{get in the trunk. not that trunk, this one. that gold is for us. a gift from some old friends of yours. they said to tell you that they didn't mind sharing the box of cracker jack, as long as you didn't get any. not even the toy surprise.}
<A>__{the ukrainians force steve into the trunk of the white mini. and for the first time, he's scared. looking up at mashkov, he begs.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{please. don't shoot me. please...}
<C>__{mashkov}
<D>__{don't worry. that wasn't the deal. i'm not going to shoot you.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{thank you. thank god.}
<C>__{mashkov}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{he really thought i was going to shoot him.}
<A>__{the ukrainians laugh. steve tries to laugh.}
<C>__{mashkov}
<D>__{no. no. i'm not going to shoot you. i'm going to hack off your limbs and bury you while you're still alive.}
<A>__{and with that, he closes the trunk. thud. like the lid of a coffin. and for steve, the world falls into blackness.}
