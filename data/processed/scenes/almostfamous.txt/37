<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{yes, you're 15. "and here's that money i owed you."}
<A>__{she reaches in a small box near the door, gives him twenty bucks. it's their routine.}
<C>__{elaine }
<D>__{your dad's favorite joke. i don't do it as well.}
<C>__{william}

<D>__{ha ha. very funny. see sense of humor. have fun at the dance. i'm glad you're making friends.}
<A>__{they move to the door, and he steadies her, as if to remind her she's not going. he opens the door. she's a wreck, and she knows it.}
<C>__{william}

<D>__{oh... okay.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{i love you bye.}
<A>__{he opens the door. neil young. "sugar mountain." watching him leave is always a killer. she's not getting any better at it either. she folds her arms tightly across her chest.}
