<A>__{charlie stands before a mirror in a private room, as a tailor fits him. a salesman enters holding a grey pinstripe. rothstein, sitting to one side, doesn't approve.}
<C>__{rothstein}
<D>__{that's a suit for a man grubbing for money, not one who has it.}
<A>__{the salesman nods and exits. rothstein turns to charlie.}

<D>__{i have exclusive deals with four distillers in scotland, and ships under contract to bring ten thousand cases a month onto the jersey coast. i need distribution, but i won't do business with maranzano or masseria. all their talk of honor only indicates their misplaced interest in power rather than money.}

<D>__{don't worry. i got friends to take care of that.}
