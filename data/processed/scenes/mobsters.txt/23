<A>__{frankie, clad only in a pair of shorts, races down a pier and leaps out over the water, howling as he sails through the air then crashes into the river amidst a pack his jeering pals.}
<B>__{charlie luciano climbs onto the pier}
<A>__{and spies meyer lansky standing on the next pier. bugsy siegel and a few other jewish kids frolic off the pier. lansky waves. close on the face of mike shane as he watches lansky dive into the water from behind the second pier. his once perfect nose now listing to the left. his skin scarred and discolored. he turns and nods to his gang. facing toward the dockside warehouses charlie limbers up as he turns to make his run down the pier, he spots shane and his gang stripping behind the next pier. he shouts and waves to the jewish kids. they look over, puzzled.}
<B>__{shane and his gang}
<A>__{race down the next pier, diving in after lansky. charlie dives into the water. the other italians follow.}
<B>__{off the other pier}
<A>__{siegel struggles to escape from three irish kids who restrain him, as shane and two others surround meyer. as they move in on him, lansky dives underwater.}

<A>__{charlie scans the scene looking for lansky.}
<B>__{charlie swims}
<A>__{under the wildly kicking legs of the surface combatants. close on mike shane's enraged face underwater as he uses a choke hold around lansky's neck. meyer's legs kick listlessly as life drains out of his body. suddenly shane's head jerks back and his mouth widens in a silent scream. charlie pulls a knife from shane's back with a violent twist, drops it into the void, and grabs lansky.}
<B>__{charlie gasps for breath}
<A>__{and lansky throws up water as they surface in the middle of melee. shane's body surfaces beside them. the fighting quickly dies out, and everyone falls silent. then, as if a starter's gun had sounded, everyone swims like hell for the pier.}
<B>__{as the others disappear into the night}
<A>__{siegel, costello, and luciano lift the comatose lansky up onto the pier. lansky regains consciousness, kicking his legs and flailing his arms. the guys struggle to hold on to meyer, to little avail. exasperated, they toss him back into the water.}
<B>__{lansky surfaces in the river}
<A>__{cursing and sputtering as he comes to. as meyer climbs up onto the pier, bugsy breaks out laughing. charlie and frank join in. mad as a wet cat, meyer goes nose to nose with charlie.}

<A>__{bugsy, charlie, and frank exchange a look, then, as one, push lansky backwards off the pier.}
