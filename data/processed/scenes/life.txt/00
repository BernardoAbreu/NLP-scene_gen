<L>__{exterior prison cemetery day}
<A>__{a handful of people are gathered in an open field under a fierce mississippi sun. a couple of young inmates, jake and leon, lean on their shovels. they are waiting to bury two identical caskets with inmate numbers stenciled on the pinewood lids. a guard rests the butt of his rifle on the ground and takes a long, healthy pull from his canteen. he offers it to the prison chaplain, who is much obliged. superintendent bill burke, a 40 year old black man, glances at his watch and loosens his tie. sure is hot. mary humphries, an elderly white woman in a nurse's uniform, stands behind willie long, an ancient inmate sleeping peacefully in a wheelchair. she readjusts an umbrella to shield the old black man from the blistering sun. burke dabs his forehead with a handkerchief. he gives the nod to the chaplain, who steps forward and cracks his bible. the men remove their hats.}
<C>__{chaplain}
<D>__{in accordance with the regulations of the state of mississippi, we gather here today to lay to rest the remains of inmates r. gibson, number 4316, and c. banks, number 4317. ashes to ashes, dust to dust. may god have mercy on their souls.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{go ahead, fellas.}
<A>__{the young inmates plunge their shovels into the dirt. one by one, the mourners head back toward a prison van parked on a nearby dirt road.}
<C>__{nurse humphries}
<D>__{i will come back for you in a little while, willie...}
<A>__{she leaves willie alone with jake and leon. he rolls his chair up to the edge of the graves and gazes at the pinewood caskets.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{these two guys friends of yours, old man?}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{we spent some time together.}
<C>__{leon}

<C>__{willie}
<D>__{sixty five years ago. they always said the farm couldn't hold 'em forever. looks like you're finally free, boys.}
<A>__{willie pulls a bottle of moonshine from his jacket and takes a swig in their honor.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{hey, the dude's holdin'.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{come on, old timer, hook the brothers up.}
<A>__{willie passes the bottle to leon, who takes a swig and winces from the unexpected kick.}
