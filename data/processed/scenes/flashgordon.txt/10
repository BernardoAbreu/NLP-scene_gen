<A>__{(munson, tv newsman, zarkov) the man is dr. hans zarkov: big, bearded, feverish looking and seemingly half mad with exhaustion. in striking contrast to the antique greenhouse exterior, here there are all kinds of computers and displays connected together in a slapdash fashion. quantities of neglected plants, most brown and dead or dying, hide the works in here from outside view. as zarkov runs around throwing switches and eyeing displays, a grim voiced tv. newsman is appearing and speaking from a good sized television screen above the main control console:}

<D>__{the extraordinary weather disturbances reported from africa this morning are now crossing the atlantic, and are expected to reach the east coast of the united states by noon. according to scientists at nasa, the earth is being struck by an immense stream of cosmic energy, apparently the result of some catastrophic stellar accident beyond the reaches of }
<A>__{zarkov whirls, slams the tv sound off and yells at the silently mouthing newsman on the screen.}

<D>__{fools! can't you understand? this is no accident it's an attack! an attack planned by a mind! this is attack!}
<A>__{munson, a scared looking assistant, comes running up the stairs with a computer print out sheet.}

<C>__{zarkov}
<D>__{what the hell do i care? i tried to warn him he called me mad, like all the others.}

<D>__{go where?}
<C>__{zarkov}

<A>__{stunned, munson turns his head and glances at something big and mirror bright gleaming behind foliage in center of tower.}
<C>__{munson}
<D>__{you're crazy!}
<A>__{perfectly calm except for the maniacal glint in his eyes, zarkov pulls out a revolver and points it at munson.}
<C>__{zarkov}
<D>__{i can't handle the capsule alone get your toothbrush.}
