<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{as bobby steps out into the glaring sun, he notices down at the other end of the town, grace's jeep parked right outside the sheriff's office, empty. presently, grace and the sheriff walk out talking, and she gets in, says a few last words and drives away. bobby backs around a corner into a sidestreet. is she selling him out? he's very confused, turbulent.}
<L>__{interior bus depot later day}
<A>__{bobby enters the bus depot. the interior is poorly lit. there are a few benches for people to wait on, but they sit empty. old, faded travel posters hang on the wall. a bored female clerk is behind the counter.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i need a ticket.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{where to?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{out of here.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{but, in particular?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i ... mexico. you got a bus that goes to mexico? that's where i have to go.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{mexico is a large country. where in mexico would you like }
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i don't care, just get me there.}
<A>__{the clerk is a little put off by bobby. he seems delirious. she goes through her schedule looking for a bus.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{how about ciudad juarez? you could take a local, arrives in two hours, and transfer in albuquerque. it'll get you across the border.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{how much?}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{one way, or round trip?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{one way.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{30.55. twenty more will get you back.}
<A>__{bobby counts his money.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{twenty seven, fifty. that's all i got.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{the ticket is 30.55.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{i bought a beer. that was a dollar something. then i gave that girl 25 cents for the juke box. and the blind man...the soda...i..i'd have 30 if...if...}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{i'm sorry, sir. it's $30.55 for the ticket.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{yeah. just a little short. figures. i just wanted to get out, that's all.}
<A>__{bobby starts to walk away. suddenly he turns, runs back at the clerk, proffers his money, half crazed, near tears.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{please, ma'am, you don't understand! i have to get out of here. they're going to come looking for me. they're going to kill me . if i can't get this ticket then i'm going to have to do things to get out of here. you know what i mean ! i don't want to hurt anybody, i just want to leave. please . i can't...i can't.}
<A>__{he's so desperate and in her frightened but neutral expression, bobby experiences the only compassion he ever finds in this whole town.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{okay, i will give you the ticket, sir, but...just...just, please calm down, please!}
<A>__{her sane tone reminds bobby of how far down he's come. he shrinks, suddenly ashamed of himself. she takes the cash on the counter, hands him a ticket.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{keep your change. bus three twenty three. leaves at seven fifty two, tonight.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i'm sorry. it's just ... you know ...}
<A>__{she nods, puts a "closed" sign in the ticket window, disappears.}
