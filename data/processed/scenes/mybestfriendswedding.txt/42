<L>__{interior lobby, ritz carlton night}
<A>__{michael and a disconsolate julianne board the elevator. he presses}
<L>__{15, she pushes 11. michael carries a handful of messages slips and}
<A>__{an envelope. as the car starts up, she folds her arms across her chest, at the edge of tears. he doesn't know what to do.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{listen up, huh? even if you blow this deal, how big could it be?}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(voice nearly cracking)}
<D>__{you're right. easy come, easy go.}
<A>__{he's really concerned, can't bear to see her so upset.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{jules?}
<A>__{she won't look at him. she wants to die. the bell rings, the doors open to her floor. she just walks out. and he follows. they stand now, she with her arms crossed, lip trembling. she can't believe how close she is to losing it.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{this thing means that much to y...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{it means a lot.}
<A>__{he nods. okay.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i will call the house, walter's probably not even asleep...}
<A>__{her mouth drops. she can't believe this.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i will drive you out there, we'll get the key, we'll go back to the office...}
<A>__{she throws her arms around his, hugging him so hard, so close. he laughs, she is so weird. she pulls back, beaming, glowing.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{come on, we'll call from your room.}
<A>__{she claps his hand. as they head down the hall...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{if i fall asleep on the altar tomorrow...}
<A>__{he's trying to flip through the message slips in his free hand...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{... you better be there to... funny, these are all from ben.}
<A>__{she's at her door, turning the key. he looks at the envelope.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{the fax is from ben, too. man, it's my wedding, and my boss can't leave me alone...}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(entering her room)}
<D>__{... maybe it's congratulations.}
<A>__{he follows her in, opening the envelope. stops. reads. and his face suddenly... freezes. to stone.}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(turning to him)}
<D>__{michael? what ha...}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{mike. i can't believe i'm doing this to you on the night before your wedding. but i think you need and deserve to know...}
<A>__{and he looks up to her.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{... what you're marrying into.}
<A>__{he hands it toward her. she takes it, hesitantly, and he walks past. toward the phone.}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{i received the following e mail this afternoon... "ben, i need a favor. my daughter's every happiness... "}
<A>__{her eyes bug out of her head. holy shit! we can hear him dialing the phone. she keeps reading, it's all there. how did this happen?}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{isabelle? i need to talk to kim...}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"mike, the funny thing is, he's offering you a gig you'd be stupid to turn down..."}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{i'm just tired. please put her on? thanks.}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"maybe you should take the job. and dump the girl."}
<A>__{and when she turns...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{jules. could you give me a minute?}
<A>__{he looks more sick than angry. as if the heart has just been cut out of him. she doesn't know what to say or do, so she just stands, staring dumbly.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{please?}
<A>__{she nods, stumbles out of her room, closing the door behind her. now she's in the empty corridor, clutching her big jumbled bag, sinking down to sit on the carpet, her back against the door. she doesn't look elated. she seems frightened, distraught, and most of all, confused. because she can't understand why. she digs absently through her bag. cigarettes. box of matches. she lights up. draws deeply. somehow, she seems near tears, and laughs bitterly at that. shakes her head at how fucked up she finds herself. squeaking wheels approach, but she is too lost to hear them.}
<C>__{bellman}
<D>__{miss, are you locked out, or something?}
<A>__{she looks up. a small, wiry man of nearly 60, in a slightly faded but neatly kept uniform. on his cart, a ton of bags.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{no, i just stepped out, because... it's a non smoking room.}
<A>__{and inhales deeply. leans back against the door, to look up at him more comfortably.}
<C>__{bellman}
<P>__{(politely)}
<D>__{well, it's non smoking floor, too. maybe you could go to the...}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(seriously)}
<D>__{why don't you have me arrested?}
<A>__{that wasn't sarcastic. he doesn't know what to say.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i mean that. arrested, convicted, put in solitary.}
<A>__{another puff.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{see, i'm a dangerous, criminal person. i do bad things to honest people. this, see, this smoking? tip of the iceberg.}
<A>__{waves her hand.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{make a citizen's arrest, i won't struggle. it'll be like getting al capone on tax evasion.}
<A>__{now she seems angry. but not at him. her eyes fill with tears.}
<C>__{bellman}
<D>__{can i... can i help you, miss?}
<A>__{she squints at his nameplate.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{do you smoke, richard?}
<C>__{bellman}
<D>__{yes, ma'am, i do, but it's...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{... a non smoking floor, yeah. well, you know what?}
<A>__{and she takes the cigarette from her lips. turns it around, holds it out to him. go ahead. he doesn't move. please! and so... ... he reaches down, takes the cigarette from her hand. staring in her eyes, he takes a deep drag. savors an expert nostril inhale of his exhaled smoke. hands the cigarette back to her...}
<C>__{bellman}
<D>__{my grandmother always said, "this, too, shall pass."}
<A>__{she swallows. wipes at her eyes. finds a smile.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{thanks, richard. if you weren't on duty, i'd buy you a drink.}
<A>__{he just nods. she waves. he waves back, pushes his cart down the hall. as she watches him go, the door behind her suddenly opens, and she... ... falls through it, flat on her back at michael's feet. staring up at him, seeing that he looks as bad as she feels, she takes raw, deep drag.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{it's over.}
<A>__{and crouches down. close beside her. the cigarette drops from her hand, unnoticed on the carpet. so he lifts it, crushes it on the heel of his shoe.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i want you to quit this shit, it'll kill you.}
<A>__{she just nods, obediently. okay, i will.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{she denied it. said i was crazy and paranoid.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{a bad combination.}
<A>__{he tries to smile. it's really hard.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{there's this big brunch tomorrow morning? at her place.}
<A>__{he lets the air out. slow. so he won't cry.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{she said "how can i call everything off, what do i tell everybody?"}
<A>__{shakes his head. can you imagine that?}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{michael...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no, it's for the best, it really is. we were so wrong for each other.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{maybe tomorrow, you'll feel dif...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{the job thing would have broken us up, eventually, anyway. she couldn't have lived with it. i know that now.}
<A>__{julianne nods. maybe that part is right. maybe it would have ended anyway. maybe she can pretend she's not a monster.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{and she's right, i'm crazy to fall for someone. i hardly knew.}
<A>__{looks deep in her eyes. he's so glad she's there.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{hey. you still got that ring?}
<A>__{she holds up her left hand, the flapping sleeve falls away. the ring is on a finger that is swollen and raw.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i tried it on. but it won't come off.}
<A>__{he smiles at that. a sad smile of friendship. then takes her finger gently... ... into his mouth. it is something like a kiss. and when he removes her moistened finger... ... he pulls the ring off. nothing to it. she blinks.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{it's mental, you know.}
<A>__{he doesn't understand that.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{should we take a walk? or maybe some food sent up, or something...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i just want to be alone. is that okay?}
<A>__{she nods, sure. he kisses her cheek. stands up.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{maybe i will go back to new york. hang with you for awhile, huh? ben'll understand.}
<A>__{she nods again. whatever you say. he steps into the open doorway...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{or we'll go somewhere. if you have the time.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{if san antonio sweeps sacramento...}
<A>__{they smiles at each other. for real.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i've never been to texas.}
<A>__{imagine that. the look holds. just above a whisper...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{thanks for coming to my wedding.}
<A>__{and then he's gone. in.julianne's bathroom late night julianne brushing out her hair in the bathroom mirror, eyeing her image with evident dissatisfaction, as she listens to the receiver}
<B>__{ringing.}
<C>__{digger }
<D>__{digger and george are with family in the hamptons until monday morning. brevity is even more in order than usual.}
<B>__{beep.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{hey, handsome. brevity this...}
<A>__{her eyes find the pack of cigarettes. next to her toiletries kit.}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{i won.}
<A>__{her fingers touch the pack. as if an object of significance. takes it up.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{amazing, huh? i didn't do things quite your way. but... i got it down.}
<A>__{cradling the phone against her shoulder, she carefully tears the top of the pack completely open.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{and forty years and nine grand children later, when i sit with michael on some rustic porch, slogging through our sweet swamp of nostalgic memories...}
<A>__{reaches the pack toward the toilet.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{no one is going to sweet the details...}
<A>__{turns it upside down, emptying a dozen cigarettes into the john.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{of one weekend in chicago.}
<A>__{drops the lid with a clatter. hits the flush.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{talk about celebration...}
<A>__{she lifts a tube from her toiletries kit. stares at it, real close.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i'm gonna brush my teeth with actual toothpaste.}
<A>__{turns it over, reads all the writing. yep.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i guess i'm too exhausted to feel the elation i so richly undeserve...}
<A>__{squeezes some paste onto her brush. carefully.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{so i'm gonna hold calls at the desk... while i get my...}
<A>__{start brushing.}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(around, her mouthful)}
<D>__{god, it is toothpaste, they should sell this stuff commercially! anyway, a girl does need her...}
<A>__{squints at her image. laughs, spewing a little foam.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{... well, we're a bit past worrying about beauty sleep. let's just settle for not frightening small animals.}
<A>__{she spits. tells digger's machine...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{anyway, i couldn't have done it without you. even though i did, if you follow that.}
<A>__{wipes her mouth. stares off. the eyes a little dreamy.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{three words: happily. ever. well, you know.}
