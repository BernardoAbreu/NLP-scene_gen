<A>__{it is all light and for fun. we get a wide angle shot now and see that bourke white is shooting one of her favorite subjects again. she is enjoying the banter, as is mirabehn, who is spinning quietly to one side of the room, and patel, who sits cross legged like gandhi on the floor. pyarelal is working on papers with him but grins at this.}
<D>__{bourke white don't worry, with luck you may not be.}
<A>__{and she shoots him again, as he hands the cloth back to manu. abha is sitting next to manu, looking at a collection of pictures of gandhi, obviously bourke white's.}
<C>__{patel}
<D>__{no, he'll be remembered for tempting fate.}
<A>__{it is wry, but waspishly chiding. abha suddenly holds a picture up for gandhi to see. it's one of him, ears wide, eyes round.}
<C>__{abha}
<D>__{mickey mouse.}
<A>__{gandhi taps her on the head with his finger as she smiles. but bourke white has looked from patel to gandhi, clearly shaken by the implication in patel's words.}
<D>__{bourke white you really are going to pakistan, then?}
<P>__{(gandhi shrugs, and she chides too)}
<D>__{you are a stubborn man.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<P>__{(a grin, in the mood of their "flirtation")}
<D>__{i'm simply going to prove to muslims there, and hindus here, that the only devils in the world are those running around in our own hearts and that's where all our battles ought to be fought.}
<A>__{abha has signaled to the cheap watch dangling from his dhoti. he glances at it, and holds his arms out. the two girls help him.}
<D>__{bourke white and what kind of a warrior have you been in that warfare?}
<A>__{she is photographing his getting up and leaning on the two girls.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{not a very good one. that's why i have so much tolerance for the other scoundrels of the world.}
<A>__{he moves off, but has a sudden thought and turns to patel.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{ask panditji to to consider what we've discussed.}
<A>__{patel nods soberly and gandhi starts for the door, bourke white moving with him.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<P>__{(of the photographs)}
<D>__{enough. bourke white}
<P>__{(a plea)}
<D>__{one more.}
<A>__{he has passed her, he's in the doorway. we see the crowd at the end of the garden, where the light of the day is beginning to soften. he turns, teasing in his slightly flirtatious way with women.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{you're a temptress.}
<A>__{she shoots him against the door the crowd milling distantly, waiting then she lowers her camera.}
<D>__{bourke white just an admirer...}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{nothing's more dangerous, especially for an old man.}
<A>__{he turns; the last words have betrayed the smile on his face; they have a painful sense of truth about them. bourke white watches as he moves into the garden toward the crowd in the distance. she turns to mirabehn.}
<D>__{bourke white there's a sadness in him.}
<A>__{it's an observation and a question. mirabehn accedes gravely.}
<C>__{mirabehn}
<D>__{he thinks he's failed.}
<A>__{bourke white stares at her, then turns to look out at him.}
<D>__{bourke white why? my god, if anything's proved him right, it's what's happened these last months...}
<A>__{mirabehn nods, but she keeps on spinning and tries to sound cynically resigned but her innate emotionalism keeps breaking through in her voice and on her face.}
<C>__{mirabehn}
<D>__{i am blinded by my love of him, but i think when we most needed it, he offered the world a way out of madness. but he doesn't see it... and neither does the world.}
<A>__{it is laced with pain. bourke white turns and looks out at gandhi so tiny, so weak as he walks between his "props." he has now reached the end of the garden and is moving among the crowd assembled there. the garden birla house exterior twilight gandhi is moving forward in the crowd, one hand resting on manu, the other on abha. he makes the pranam to someone, the crowd is bowing to him, some speaking, and we also see the crowd from his point of view "bapu," "god bless you," "thank you thank you." he turns to a very old woman, who makes a salaam to him. gandhi touches her head.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{allah be with you.}
<A>__{smiling, he turns back. a jostling, the sound of beads falling.}
<C>__{manu}
<P>__{(to someone)}
<D>__{brother, bapu is already late for prayers.}
<A>__{gandhi turns to the person; he makes the pranam. full shot. godse is making the pranam to him and he suddenly, wildly draws his gun and fires. the camera closes on gandhi as he staggers and falls, the red stain of blood seeping through his white shawl.}
<C>__{gandhi}
<D>__{oh, god... oh, god...}
<A>__{manu and abha bend over him, silent in their first shock. the sound of panic and alarm begins to grow around them, they suddenly scream and begin to cry.}
<D>__{manu abha bapu! bapu!}
<A>__{funeral pyre exterior day blackness. silence. a moment we sense the blackness moving like dark smoke. the camera is pulling back very slowly and we can tell the blackness is smoke rising from a fire. and now we see that it is a funeral pyre. and all around that pyre a mass of silent humanity. through the smoke, sitting cross legged near the rim of the flames, we see nehru... and azad and patel, mirabehn and kallenbach, the drawn faces of lord and lady mountbatten, manu and abha... the river exterior day a helicopter shot coming slowly up the wide river, low, toward a barge and a mass of people in the distance. and now we are over the barge, and it is covered with flowers. flowers flow downstream around it. an urn sits on it containing gandhi's ashes and nehru stands near it, azad and patel a little behind him. and as the barge floats down the river, nehru bends and lifts the urn... featuring nehru. he swallows, restraining his own emotion, and slowly, ritualistically, sprinkles the ashes over the water. and as they spread, we hold on that stretch of the river, the flowers swirling languidly around it as the dark, timeless current moves them toward the sea.}
<C>__{gandhi's voice}
<P>__{(weak, struggling, as}
<D>__{he spoke the words}
<P>__{to mirabehn)}
<D>__{...there have been tyrants and murderers and for a time they can seem invincible. but in the end they always fall. think of it always... when you are in doubt that that is god's way, the way the world is meant to be... think of that.}
<A>__{and slowly the camera begins pulling back, leaving the flowers, the brown, rolling current as though leaving the story of gandhi, going far out, away from the great river, reaching higher and higher, through streaks of clouds as end titles begin. and through them, once more we hear, dimly, reminiscently, through the rushing wind: "at home children are writing 'essays' about him!"... the croaky voice singing, "god save our gracious king"... dyer: "sergeant major ," the sergeant major: "take aim!," dyer: "fire!," the sound of massed rifle fire, screams... "you are my best friend... my highest guru, and my sovereign lord." "who the hell is he?," "i don't know, sir." "my name is gandhi. mohandas k. gandhi."... the sound of rioting, women's screams, terror... "find a child a child whose mother and father have been killed. a little boy... about this high."... "he thinks he's failed."... "long live mahatma gandhi!... long live mahatma gandhi!"}
