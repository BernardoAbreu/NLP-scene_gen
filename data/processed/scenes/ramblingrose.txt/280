<A>__{a shot of buddy coming with great furtiveness from the living room out into the front hall. very cautiously, he tiptoes across the hall and bows down and listens at the door of his mother's bedroom study. he crouches down, peeps through the keyhole.}

<A>__{a "keyhole shot" of daddy and mother in the bedroom. mother sits in her study chair, a handkerchief to her eyes. daddy sits in a chair nearby. he looks depressed.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{i'm sorry, darlin', i hate it as much as you do.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(wanly)}
<D>__{well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, i admit. but she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{it's because of the children she's got to go. i don't want to be holier than thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{who is to say our morals are better than hers?}
<P>__{(frowns, sighs)}
<D>__{but maybe you're right. she could... influence dolly...}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{that is exactly what i'm afraid of.}
<P>__{(pauses, and firmly)}
<D>__{the girl has got to go, darlin'.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{but morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. and in her heart rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. therefore, she's not immoral. not really.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{but what i said is the simple truth. and now i see something else, i see more deeply into it...}
<A>__{mother has a slightly "other worldly" look on her face. daddy glances at the door of the bedroom, he suspects something.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{just a moment, darlin'.}
