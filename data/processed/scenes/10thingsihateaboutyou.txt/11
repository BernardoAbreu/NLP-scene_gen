<A>__{a frog is being torn asunder by several prongs and picks. michael and cameron go for the spleen.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you're in school for one day and you ask out the most beautiful girl? do you have no concept of the high school social code?}
<A>__{cameron grins away}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{i teach her french, get to know her, dazzle her with charm and she falls in love with me.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{unlikely, but even so, she still can't go out with you. so what's the point?}
<A>__{cameron motions with his head toward patrick, a few lab tables away. he's wearing biker glasses instead of goggles as he tries to revive his frog.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{what about him?}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{you wanna go out with him?}
<A>__{the others at the lab table raise their eyebrows}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(impatient)}
<D>__{no he could wrangle with the sister.}
<A>__{michael smiles. liking the intrigue.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{what makes you think he'll do it?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{he seems like he thrives on danger}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no kidding. he's a criminal. i heard he lit a state trooper on fire. he just got out of alcatraz...}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{they always let felons sit in on honors biology?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i'm serious, man, he's whacked. he sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.}
<C>__{cameron}

<C>__{michael}
<D>__{did she actually say she'd go out with you?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{that's what i just said}
<A>__{michael processes this.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you know, if you do go out with bianca, you'd be set. you'd outrank everyone. strictly a list. with me by your side.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{i thought you hated those people.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{hey i've gotta have a few clients when i get to wall street.}
<A>__{a cowboy flicks the frog's heart into one of the coffee kid's latte. cameron presses on, over the melee.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{so now all we gotta do is talk to him.}
<A>__{he points to patrick, who now makes his frog hump another frog, with full on sound effects.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i will let you handle that.}
