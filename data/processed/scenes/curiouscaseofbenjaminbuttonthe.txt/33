<A>__{the boarders eating dinner. queenie, in a white uniform... along with tizzy, wearing a chef's hat and apron, helping her serve. we move across the ancient faces... until we come to one particular face... wearing eyeglasses now... but the same wrinkled face we've come to know... the face of a very old man... the face of benjamin button, when he should normally be a six year old. he's sitting in a wheelchair now... small, shrunken, hunched with age, legs and hands crippled with arthritis... eyeglasses are just one addition... a hearing aid... a bulky apparatus of its time, is in one ear... but if we look even closer we can see there are sprouts of hair... wisps of white... what would be the last hair for some... seem to be growing in... as we watch him eat, he uses his fork like a child might, banging it just for the hell of it making noise...}
