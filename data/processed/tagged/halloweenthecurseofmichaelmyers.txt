<A>__{a group of white coats, led by wynn, usher loomis off an old service elevator, leading him through the dark passageway. wynn turns around, surveying the tunnel. as he walks on, we see something fall from his back pocket. as they disappear down another tunnel, a wooden door slowly creaks open. tommy appears, cautiously stepping out into the catacombs. edging along the dank, torch lit walls. wind moans. rats scamper past his feet. wynn has dropped his security key card. tommy swipes it.}
