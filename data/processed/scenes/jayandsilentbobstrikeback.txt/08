<A>__{jay and silent bob mosey past the front door of the building and knock.}
<L>__{interior potzer's inc day}
<A>__{holden mcneil, opens the door and smiles.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{well! i have been waiting years to do this.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{look at these morose motherfuckers right here. smells like someone shit in their cereal. bunngg!}
<A>__{jay and silent bob enter. holden closes the door, following them.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{what the fuck took you so long answering your damn door? you trying to talk another girlfriend of yours into some of that gay ass three way action with your buddy?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{no, i was just showering your mother's stink off me after i gave her a quick jump and sent her home. but now that you mention it }
<P>__{(to bob)}
<D>__{thanks, you know. you could've made the moral of that story you told me a bit more clear.}
<A>__{silent bob shrugs.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{so what brings you two dirt merchants to my neck of the woods?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{oh, i will tell you what our necks are doing in your woods }
<A>__{silent bob holds up the wizard article.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{where's our motherfucking movie check?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{you heard about that too, hunh? well, i've got nothing to do with it. that's banky's deal. he owns the property now. i signed my half of the bluntman and chronic right over to him years ago.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{why the fuck would you do a thing like that?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{because i'm almost thirty, for god's sake why on earth would i want to keep writing about characters whose central preoccupations are weed and dick and fart jokes? you gotta grow, man. don't you ever want more for yourself?}
<P>__{(off silent bob)}
<D>__{i know this poor, hapless sonovabitch does. i look in his doe eyes and i see a man crying out, "when, lord? when the fuck can your servant ditch this foul mouthed little chucklehead to whom i am a constant victim of his folly, and who bombards me and those around us with grade a foolishness that prevents me from even getting to kiss a girl? fuck! when?!}
<A>__{silent bob nod like he's finally understood. jay looks at him, hurt, and bob tried to downplay the comment's truth.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i'm the chucklehead? fuck you you're the dumb ass who gave away his comic, and now you ain't got no fat movie check neither.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{when you're right, you're right. i wish i'd broken off a little piece for myself. because if the buzz is any indication, the movie's gonna make some huge bank.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{what buzz?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{the internet buzz.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{what the fuck is the internet?}
