<L>__{interior hotel dining room that night}
<A>__{eli is at the head of a long table, camera pulling back to reveal a dozen members of the company dining with him. nina sits beside eli listening with rapt attention to sam's monologue, her dessert fork sensuously lingers at her lip.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{two years ago you were all charged up to make a great big anti war statement and they wouldn't let you. now they let you, but you haven't got a war. what you've got is egg on your face because vietnam's long gone and it's too late!}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{our picture's not about fighting wars...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{oh?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{...it's about fighting windmills.}
<A>__{the truth in eli's statement registers on sam. cameron sits farther down the table, watching nina watch eli...and wishing she were watching him.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{war isn't the disease...it's only one of the symptoms.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(hooked)}
<D>__{what's the disease?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{that's the big question, sam. name the disease and you've licked the screenplay.}
<P>__{(indicating cameron)}
<D>__{ask him. 'cause he knows what the film is about. right lucky? tell 'em...how'd you like vietnam?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{how'd you like bubonic plague?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you drafted?}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{see, sam? here's another one who hates war...but he enlisted.}
<P>__{(to cameron)}
<D>__{you fought in vietnam for two years? ...i mean actually were out there killing people...}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{...hey, i didn't kill that many people...}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{don't be modest, lucky. everybody digs a little violence...what was that you said on the beach?}
<A>__{cameron is starting to bristle at eli's needling, particularly with nina watching.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{about getting home for thanksgiving?}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(tentatively)}
<D>__{...that you better figure the guy coming at you is trying to kill you...?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{yeah. see, sam?...that's what the disease is about...being scared shitless. inventing enemies. whistling in the dark. i wish you'd talk to the kid, sam, i mean it. you know, really, you guys should room together.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(getting the last word)}
<D>__{hey, lucky, give me your cot by the window and i will let you read a great madhouse sequence.}
<A>__{they all laugh.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(surrendering)}
<D>__{all right, eli. i will write you another scene. what difference does it make? the studio will cut it all out anyway and what you got left is a lot of swell battle scenes, which, when i was back there they said were "just terrific."}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{no, they won't.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yeah, what makes you different?}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{because they know if they cut my picture, i will kill 'em.}
<A>__{the deadly in eli's voice was more than intended and there is suddenly an awkward silence at the table. cameron eyes eli with a wry smile.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{you mean, bang? kill 'em, just like that?}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(matter of fact)}
<D>__{no. i will kill 'em and eat 'em...i hate to waste anything.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{they call him "eli the terrible..."}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{sam, my picture is the only kid i've got! if the studio said your daughter, jennifer, would look better with her fingers chopped off, what would you do?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{being an insecure writer, i'd call my agent...and get another opinion.}
<A>__{everyone laughs. jake, the chief of police, is seen in the background approaching the table. cameron spots him and starts to rise.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{...if you'll excuse me...}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(arriving)}
<D>__{don't go away, burt. i want you.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(broad welcome)}
<D>__{jake! long time, no see. you taken care of my problem with the beach?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i'm not talking to you.}
<P>__{(to production manager)}
<D>__{i understand you got that film out of the duesenberg...}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(cutting in)}
<D>__{it's at the lab, jake.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i'm talking to this gentleman.}
<P>__{(to production manager)}
<D>__{we want to see it.}
<A>__{cameron, realizing the film might disclose his presence on the bridge, reacts with alarm, which increases as eli says...}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{tell the chief it's our pleasure. soon as it gets back...but ask him why.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(choked up with its importance)}
<D>__{you can tell your mr. cross this inquiry comes from a source so high it is not his to question...}
<P>__{(now at a loss for proper words)}
<D>__{...it is his to do it, or else. someone they're looking for may have been on that road when the car went off.}
<P>__{(to cameron)}
<D>__{burt, you see anybody?}
<A>__{then, suddenly noticing something different about cameron's appearance...}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{hey, did you have red hair before?...}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(indicating denise)}
<D>__{she sprays it every day so i look like raymond...i didn't see a soul.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(to the rescue)}
<D>__{tell the chief that burt was so busy being brilliant, he wouldn't have noticed jesus christ walking on the water.}
<A>__{jake pulls a photograph from a manila envelope and hands it to cameron.}
