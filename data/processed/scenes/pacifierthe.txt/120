<L>__{interior the gym moments later}
<A>__{shane enters. zoe sits in a folding chair, mortified. she is holding a broken off side view mirror. murney stands, principal claire next to him. they look concerned.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{don't worry. so, she wrecked a driver's ed. car she'll pay for the damage...}
<C>__{murney}
<D>__{that? lady drivers, what do you expect. no, it's not that it's the boy...}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{red two? i mean todd?}
<A>__{claire nods. shane gives zoe a look. zoe shrugs.}
<C>__{principal claire}
<D>__{ordinarily i would wait for his mother to return... but i'm a bit concerned, and i'm not sure what to do...}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{has he been skipping class?}
<C>__{principal claire}
<D>__{well yes. he does always miss sixth period. but this...}
<A>__{murney calls into the hallway. todd enters. shane stops, in shock: todd's long hair is all shaved off, he now has a bleach blonde buzz cut, giving him a "skinhead" look.}
<C>__{murney}
<D>__{this is how he showed up to practice. and that's not all. i was doing a little re con in his locker... and i found this:}
<A>__{murney hands shane a book and shane flips through it. it's a book of photographs of nazi uniforms. shane scowls.}
<C>__{murney }
<D>__{if he'd had hustler or something, boys will be boys but this is just sick.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{he's not a nazi.}
<C>__{principal claire}
<D>__{it's certainly not normal.}
<P>__{(pulls shane aside.)}
<D>__{see if you can talk to the boy. find out what's going on.}
<A>__{shane shakes his head: todd is worse than he thought. todd and zoe stand to go, and shane walks them out. the wrestling team is assembled, stretching. they snicker and shake their heads at todd, as he passes. shane walks the kids out, and murney chases after him.}
<C>__{murney}
<D>__{hope you won't go light on him that whole family's no good, if you ask me.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{i will talk to him.}
<C>__{murney}
<D>__{you're a good man, shane. bet you're a hell of a fighter on the mats, huh?}
<P>__{(shane ignores him, and keeps walking.)}
<D>__{maybe sometime we oughta strap up, we'll give these boys a treat.}
<A>__{he "fake punches" one of his boys who flinches like murney has maybe hurt him a couple times. murney laughs.}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{another time, maybe...}
<C>__{murney}
<D>__{it's a date then. i will show you a couple moves. i promise i won't hurt you.}
<A>__{shane walks away. without warning, murney lets out a kung fu scream, and leaps at shane, kicking him in the back, shane trips forwards to his knees. murney tells his team:}
<C>__{murney }
<D>__{see that? you never know when your adversary is going to strike!}
<C>__{shane}
<D>__{did you kick me in the back? is there a footprint on my jacket?}
<A>__{shane dusts off his back, and leaves.}
<C>__{murney}
<D>__{come on frogman! don't be a sissy!}
<A>__{shane turns back. it looks like shane might fight, but instead he takes a deep breath, and leaves. murney shakes his head, and snickers to his team.}
