<L>__{intercut d:}
<A>__{ave childress at the front counter as the librarian (late fifties) photocopies a page from a history book for him. childress scrutinizes trevor and rita as he waits. satisfied now, rita slides the page to trevor...}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{... finished.}
<A>__{trevor blinks himself back to reality...}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{... let's hava look..}
<A>__{he adjusts his glasses. pores over the paper...}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{... good.}
<P>__{(deliberating)}
<D>__{... i was just thinking, since your essay's about gangs and getting away from their influence, you probably could've left some of those double negatives you like so well.}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{so now you wan' me to use bad grammar.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(explaining)}
<D>__{only if it suits your topic.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{i know. we're all products of our environment 'n' shit.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{no, i think that's just an excuse.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i say if we're strong, we can rise above adversity.}
<P>__{(lets it sink in)}
<D>__{but it's like rap or hip hop... correct all the grammar and it loses its impact.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{so you like hip hop, mr. g?}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{... i hate it.}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(reacting)}
<D>__{what kinda black man are you?}
<A>__{trevor bursts forth a laugh. childress perks up at the front counter. trevor's laugh evokes a smile from rita. now she pries a little further...}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{why you here anyways? don't you got nothin' better t'do?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{... everything i wanna do is right here.}
<P>__{(back on track now)}
<D>__{it's a good essay, rita. you put a lot of effort into it, it shows.}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(a laconic grin)}
<D>__{comes from the heart, maestro. i'm a writer... not a fighter.}
<A>__{trevor returns a cognitive flicker.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(hinting now)}
<D>__{... ms. quinn was telling me she picks two seniors each year to read their essays at graduation.}
<C>__{rita}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{she ain't gonna pick my paper. anyway, i don't wanna get up in fronna all those people and make a fool outta myself.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{why not? it'd be a pyrrhic victory.}
<C>__{rita}
<D>__{what's dat?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{... in your case, irony. refers to king pyrrhus. never mind. look it up sometime.}
