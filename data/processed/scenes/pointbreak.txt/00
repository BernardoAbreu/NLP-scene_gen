<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{we are in the belly of a wave. light refracts in a constant collision of water. slow motion, the hallucinatory prisms, like liquid diamonds taking flight, dreamlike...}
<L>__{exterior ocean dusk}
<A>__{backlit against a flaming sun a solitary surfer glides across the green glassy peak. time is stretched until his movements gain a grace and fluidity not of this world. total zen concentration. body weight centered, eyes forward and on the next section.}
<L>__{exterior urban street dusk}
<A>__{slow motion on a black sedan. creeping along store fronts. past a winchell's. people splash steps down rain washed sidewalks in dream motion. the sedan turns past the first virginia bank and into an alley.}
