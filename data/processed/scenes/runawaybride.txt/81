<L>__{exterior main street beauty parlor next day}
<A>__{it's early morning. mrs. pressman hands peggy a cup of coffee to go. peggy walks to the beauty parlor, unlocks the front door and goes in.}
<L>__{interior beauty parlor day}
<A>__{peggy enters and starts about her opening duties. she turns on the lights and turns and sees her friend, maggie.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{do you think i flirt with cory? peggy stops in her track. maggie is sitting curled up in a salon chair. she looks like she hasn't slept.}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{good morning to you, too. you look good.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{thank you. do you think i flirt with cory?}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{yes. maggie looks miserable.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i don't mean it. peggy moves to the salon mirror near maggie with her cup of coffee.}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{i know. i think sometimes you just sort of spaz out with random excess flirtation energy and it just lands on anything male that moves.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{on anything male that moves? as opposed to anything male that doesn't move? peggy pours her coffee out of its styrofoam cup into a ceramic mug.}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{like certain kinds of coral. peggy sits in the salon chair next to maggie.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i'm going to kill myself.}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{why?}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{because you think i'm all like... "hey man, check me out".}
<C>__{peggy}
<P>__{(friendly)}
<A>__{no, i don't think you're like, "i'm charming and mysterious in a way that even i don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you". very hard to compete with. especially to us married women who have lost our mystery.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{but you haven't lost your mystery! you're very mysterious!}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{no. i'm weird. weird and mysterious are two different things.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{but i'm weird.}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{no. you're quirky. quirky and weird are two different things.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{peggy, there's distinct possibility that i might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up. despite that, i love you and i can promise that i will no longer flirt with cory, and i beg your forgiveness. maggie looks ready to cry.}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{i'm not worried about you and cory or cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up. but, maggie, you've been like this since we were kids. and i think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like bob, if he's the one.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i think you're right.}
<P>__{(then)}
<A>__{is there anything i can do to make it up to you?}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{something that brings warmth to my heart.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<A>__{duckbill platypus.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{it's only funny at camp birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. it's not anymore. maggie makes her funny face. peggy doesn't laugh.}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{you're right. it's not funny now. maybe we both grew up.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{thanks. will you fix my hair?}
