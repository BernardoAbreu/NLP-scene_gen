<A>__{sheldon is in the back seat. the smoochy costume is next to him. behind the wheel is randolph. he's in disguise.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{don't be silly. the chance to have smoochy the rhino perform at our little soiree? i'd carry you piggy back through a bed of hot rusty glass if i had to.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{well, it's always a pleasure to help out a worthy cause. and believe me, i've learned lately that it's not all sunshine and daffodils in the land of non profit.}
<C>__{randolph}
<D>__{i just looove your show, by the way. it's such a refreshing change of pace from that dreadful embezzler... what's his name again? rainbow something or other?}

<D>__{no, i would never take pleasure in someone's downfall. you know the old expression about walking a mile in another man's shoes? well, that really holds water. just try to imagine }
<C>__{randolph}
