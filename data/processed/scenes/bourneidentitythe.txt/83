<A>__{marie's face a passport photo she's eighteen she's smiling really alive and fresh and conklin behind his desk. abbott staring grimly at the picture }
<C>__{abbott}
<D>__{who is she?}
<C>__{zorn}
<D>__{marie helene kreutz. she's twenty six. born outside munich. father was a welder. he died in '91. we don't have the mother. there might be a step sister, we're trying to track that down.}
<P>__{(apologetic)}
<D>__{it's tough. she's a wanderer. she pops up on the grid here and there but... i mean, the last time she paid an electric bill in europe was '94. no taxes. no steady employer. she's got three arrests. two shoplifting cases, one in spain, one in germany. and she actually did three months in an italian detention center for credit card fraud.}
<C>__{abbott}
<D>__{no political affiliations?}
<C>__{conklin}
<D>__{she's a gypsy. if it's a cover, it's a great one.}
<C>__{abbott}
<D>__{i'm assuming we're exploring that possibility.}
<C>__{conklin}
<D>__{we're exploring every possibility.}
<P>__{(tighter by the moment)}
<D>__{we are in pursuit. how much more do you want me to tell you?}
<C>__{abbott}
<D>__{pursuit would indicate that you know exactly where he is.}
<C>__{conklin}
<D>__{no. pursuit ends when we know exactly where he is.}
<C>__{abbott}
<D>__{yes, well, i think we need some fresh eyes on this problem. i'm bringing in some people from upstairs.}
<A>__{conklin hesitates. inside he's screaming.}
<C>__{conklin}
<D>__{we've been down here for two weeks banging our heads against the wall. we've been sleeping down here. we just got our first lead fourteen hours ago, and now? now that we finally have something to work with you want to bring planning personnel down here?}
<P>__{(real steam)}
<D>__{i'd rethink that.}
<C>__{abbott}
<D>__{i want a second opinion.}
<C>__{conklin}
<D>__{this is an operations desk.}
<C>__{abbott}
<D>__{i'm not asking.}
