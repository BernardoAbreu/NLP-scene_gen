<A>__{the room is faded and cold with bare windows looking out on rain and gray. the floor is strewn with moving boxes, a few pieces of furniture, charlie's old nordic track. a few garden tools lean against one wall; a cardboard mattress box leans against a corner wall. coraline enters, counting windows and doors to note in her pad. she sets the doll on a low table beside an open moving box and smiles. the box is filled with her mom's collection of snowglobes. she takes out her favorite the bear fountain at the detroit zoo and shakes it. she studies the globe and sighs with homesickness. she sets it carefully on the fireplace mantel, then unwraps the rest of the snowglobes and places them beside it. over the mantel hangs a painting of a crying boy in blue a scoop of ice cream melting on his shirt, his hand holding an empty cone. coraline takes up pad and pen and adds to her list, muttering aloud.}

<D>__{all right, little me, where are you hiding?}
<A>__{scanning the room, she spots the doll looking out from behind the mattress box leaned against the corner wall. perplexed, she walks over and kneels down to grab the doll when she notices something on the wall behind the box. she shoves the box aside, and discovers the outline of a small door that's been wallpapered over.}
