<A>__{the face of the baby thirty four years later, still crying. truman burbank, thinning hair, a body going soft around the edges, appearing older than his thirty four years sits at the wheel of his eight year old oldsmobile cutlass supreme. he cries without shame, making no attempt to wipe away the tears. pausing at an intersection in a quiet, working class suburban street, a spherical glass object suddenly falls from the sky and lands with a deafening crash on the roadway, several yards in front of his idling car. truman exits the oldsmobile to investigate. amidst a sea of shattered glass are the remains of a light mechanism. he looks around him but the street is deserted. he checks that all the surrounding streetlights are accounted for, even though the fallen fixture is far larger. he looks up into the sky but there is no plane in sight. with some effort, truman picks up what's left of the crumpled light, loads it into the trunk of his car and drives away.}
