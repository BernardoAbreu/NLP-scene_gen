<L>__{interior statuary hall night}
<A>__{nell walks through the row of dark statues. carved faces watch her pass.}
<L>__{interior hall outside locked room night}
<A>__{nell stands before the threshold of the horrific doors, once locked, now inexplicably open. the mythological frieze on the door split in half, a world cut in two, a seal broken. like something has come out of its tomb. nell steps into the blackness.}
<L>__{interior theo's room night}
<A>__{marrow comes out of the bathroom, joining theo by the window next to her bed. luke stands in the doorway.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{was sure she'd be in here.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{where in the hell can she be.}
<A>__{marrow remembers.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{oh no...}
<L>__{interior greenhouse night}
<A>__{marrow, luke and theo enter the greenhouse, the heavy growth forbidding in the darkness. they spread out on the parallel walkways.}
<C>__{theo}
<D>__{nell?}
<A>__{they reach the transept, turn down it toward the statue of crain at the end looming white in the dusk. dead silence. then marrow screams. under a thin layer of ice underneath the giant hand that protrudes from the pond we find watt's body, as if the hand wants to keep him there forever. marrow did find his watts, a horrifying sight.}
<C>__{marrow}
<D>__{oh my god it's watts.}
<A>__{as at the same time out of the mouth from the sculpture erupts a river of blood, scaring the hell out of them. their clothes splattered with blood, marrow quickly leads them out of there.}
