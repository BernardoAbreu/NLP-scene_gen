<L>__{interior uncle bob's pancake house morning}
<A>__{eight men dressed in black suits, sit around a table at a breakfast cafe. they are mr. white, mr. pink, mr. blue, mr. blonde, mr. orange, mr. brown, nice guy eddie cabot, and the big boss, joe cabot. most are finished eating and are enjoying coffee and conversation. joe flips through a small address book. mr. pink is telling a long and involved story about madonna.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{"like a virgin" is all about a girl who digs a guy with a big dick. the whole song is a metaphor for big dicks.}
<C>__{mr. blue}
<D>__{no it's not. it's about a girl who is very vulnerable and she's been fucked over a few times. then she meets some guy who's really sensitive }
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{ whoa...whoa...time out greenbay. tell that bullshit to the tourists.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(looking through his address book)}
<D>__{toby...who the fuck is toby? toby...toby...think...think... think...}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{it's not about a nice girl who meets a sensitive boy. now granted that's what "true blue" is about, no argument about that.}
<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{which one is "true blue?"}
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{you don't remember "true blue?" that was a big ass hit for madonna. shit, i don't even follow this tops in pops shit, and i've at least heard of "true blue."}
<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{look, asshole, i didn't say i ain't heard of it. all i asked was how does it go? excuse me for not being the world's biggest madonna fan.}
<C>__{mr. brown}
<D>__{i hate madonna.}
<C>__{mr. blue}
<D>__{i like her early stuff. you know, "lucky star," "borderline" but once she got into her "papa don't preach" phase, i don't know, i tuned out.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{hey, fuck all that, i'm making a point here. you're gonna make me lose my train of thought.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{oh fuck, toby's that little china girl.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i found this old address book in a jacket i ain't worn in a coon's age. toby what? what the fuck was her last name?}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{where was i?}
<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{you said "true blue" was about a nice girl who finds a sensitive fella. but "like a virgin" was a metaphor for big dicks.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{let me tell ya what "like a virgin"'s about. it's about some cooze who's a regular fuck machine. i mean all the time, morning, day, night, afternoon, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick.}
<C>__{mr. blue}
<D>__{how many dicks was that?}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{a lot.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{then one day she meets a john holmes motherfucker, and it's like, whoa baby. this mother fucker's like charles bronson in "the great escape." he's diggin tunnels. now she's gettin this serious dick action, she's feelin something she ain't felt since forever. pain.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{chew? toby chew? no.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{it hurts. it hurts her. it shouldn't hurt. her pussy should be bubble yum by now. but when this cat fucks her, it hurts. it hurts like the first time. the pain is reminding a fuck machine what is was like to be a virgin. hence, "like a virgin."}
<A>__{the fellas crack up.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{wong?}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{fuck you, wrong. i'm right! what the fuck do you know about it anyway? you're still listening to jerry fucking vale.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{not wrong, dumb ass, wong! you know, like the chinese name?}
<A>__{mr. white snatches the address book from joe's hand. they fight, but they're not really mad at each other.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{give me this fucking thing.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what the fuck do you think you're doin? give me my book back!}
<C>__{mr. white}

<C>__{joe}
<D>__{whaddaya mean, give it to me when we leave, give it back now.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{for the past fifteen minutes now, you've just been droning on with names. "toby...toby...toby... toby wong...toby wong...toby chung...fuckin charlie chan." i got madonna's big dick outta my right ear, and toby jap i don't know what, outta my left.}
<C>__{joe}

<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{when you're annoying as hell, i care a lot.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{give me my book.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{you gonna put it away?}
<C>__{joe}

<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{well, then, i'm afraid i'm gonna have to keep it.}
<C>__{mr. blonde}
<D>__{joe, you want me to shoot him for you?}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{shit, you shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.}
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{have you guys been listening to k billy's super sounds of the seventies weekend?}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{yeah, it's fuckin great isn't it?}
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{can you believe the songs they been playin?}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{no, i can't. you know what i heard the other day? "heartbeat it's lovebeat," by little tony defranco and the defranco family. i haven't heard that since i was in fifth fuckin grade.}
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{when i was coming down here, i was playin it. and "the night the lights went out in georgia" came on. now i ain't heard that song since it was big, but when it was big, i heard it a million trillion times. i'm listening to it this morning, and this was the first time i ever realized that the lady singing the song, was the one who killed andy.}
<C>__{mr. blue}
<D>__{you didn't know vicki lawrence killed the guy?}
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{i thought the cheatin wife shot andy.}
<C>__{mr. blonde}
<D>__{they say it in the song.}
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{i know, i heard it. i musta zoned out whenever that part came on before. i thought when she said that little sister stuff, she was talkin about her sister in law, the cheatin wife.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{no, she did it. she killed the cheatin wife, too.}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<D>__{you know the part in "gypsies, tramps and theives," when she says "poppa woulda shot his if he knew what he'd done?" i could never figure out what he did.}
<A>__{the table laughs. the waitress comes over to the table. she has the check, and a pot of coffee.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{can i get anybody more coffee.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{no, we're gonna be hittin it. i will take care of the check.}
<A>__{she hands the bill to him.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{here ya go. please pay at the register, if you wouldn't mind.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{sure thing.}

<A>__{they all mutter equivalents. she exits and joe stands up.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i will take care of this, you guys leave the tip.}
<P>__{(to mr. white)}
<D>__{and when i come back, i want my book back.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{sorry, it's my book now.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{blonde, shoot this piece of shit, will ya?}
<A>__{mr. blonde shoots mr. white with his finger. mr white acts shot. joe exits.}
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{okay, everybody cough up green for the little lady.}
<A>__{everybody whips out a buck, and throws it on the table. everybody, that is, except mr. white.}
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{c'mon, throw in a buck.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{uh uh. i don't tip.}
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{whaddaya mean you don't tip?}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{i don't believe in it.}
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{you don't believe in tipping?}
<C>__{mr. pink}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{i love this kid, he's a madman, this guy.}
<C>__{mr. blonde}
<D>__{do you have any idea what these ladies make? they make shit.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{don't give me that. she don't make enough money, she can quit.}
<A>__{everybody laughs.}
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{i don't even know a jew who'd have the balls to say that. so let's get this straight. you never ever tip?}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{i don't tip because society says i gotta. i tip when somebody deserves a tip. when somebody really puts forth an effort, they deserve a little something extra. but this tipping automatically, that shit's for the birds. as far as i'm concerned, they're just doin their job.}
<C>__{mr. blue}
<D>__{our girl was nice.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{our girl was okay. she didn't do anything special.}
<C>__{mr. blonde}
<D>__{what's something special, take ya in the kitchen and suck your dick?}
<A>__{they all laugh.}
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{i'd go over twelve percent for that.}
<C>__{mr. write}
<D>__{look, i ordered coffee. now we've been here a long fuckin time, and she's only filled my cup three times. when i order coffee, i want it filled six times.}
<C>__{mr. blonde}
<D>__{what if she's too busy?}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{the words "too busy" shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary.}
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{excuse me, mr. white, but the last thing you need is another cup of coffee.}
<A>__{they all laugh.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{these ladies aren't starvin to death. they make minimum wage. when i worked for minimum wage, i wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tipworthy.}
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{ahh, now we're getting down to it. it's not just that he's a cheap bastard }
<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{ it is that too }
<C>__{nice guy eddie}
<D>__{ it is that too. but it's also he couldn't get a waiter job. you talk like a pissed off dishwasher: "fuck those cunts and their fucking tips."}
<C>__{mr. blonde}
<D>__{so you don't care that they're counting on your tip to live?}
<A>__{mr. white rubs two of his fingers together.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{do you know what this is? it's the world's smallest violin, playing just for the waitresses.}
<C>__{mr. blonde}
<D>__{you don't have any idea what you're talking about. these people bust their ass. this is a hard job.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{so's working at mcdonald's, but you don't feel the need to tip them. they're servin ya food, you should tip em. but no, society says tip these guys over here, but not those guys over there. that's bullshit.}
<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{they work harder than the kids at mcdonald's.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{oh yeah, i don't see them cleaning fryers.}
<C>__{mr. brown}
<D>__{these people are taxed on the tips they make. when you stiff 'em, you cost them money.}
<C>__{mr. blonde}
<D>__{waitressing is the number one occupation for female non college graduates in this country. it's the one jab basically any woman can get, and make a living on. the reason is because of tips.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{fuck all that.}
<A>__{they all laugh.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{hey, i'm very sorry that the government taxes their tips. that's fucked up. but that ain't my fault. it would appear that waitresses are just one of the many groups the government fucks in the ass on a regular basis. you show me a paper says the government shouldn't do that, i will sign it. put it to a vote, i will vote for it. but what i won't do is play ball. and this non college bullshit you're telling me, i got two words for that: "learn to fuckin type." cause if you're expecting me to help out with the rent, you're in for a big fuckin surprise.}
<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{he's convinced me. give me my dollar back.}
<A>__{everybody laughs. joe's comes back to the table.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{okay ramblers, let's get to rambling. wait a minute, who didn't throw in?}
<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{mr. white.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(to mr. orange)}
<D>__{mr. white?}
<P>__{(to mr. white)}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{he don't tip.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(to mr. orange)}
<D>__{he don't tip?}
<P>__{(to mr. white)}
<D>__{you don't tip? why?}
<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{he don't believe in it.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(to mr. orange)}
<D>__{he don't believe in it?}
<P>__{(to mr. white)}
<D>__{you don't believe in it?}
<C>__{mr. orange}
<D>__{nope.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(to mr. orange)}
<D>__{shut up!}
<P>__{(to mr. white)}
<D>__{cough up the buck, ya cheap bastard, i paid for your goddamn breakfast.}
<C>__{mr. white}
<D>__{because you paid for the breakfast, i'm gonna tip. normally i wouldn't.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{whatever. just throw in your dollar, and let's move.}
<P>__{(to mr. blonde)}
<D>__{see what i'm dealing with here. infants. i'm fuckin dealin with infants.}
<A>__{the eight men get up to leave. mr. white's waist is in the f.g. as he buttons his coat, for a second we see he's carrying a gun. they exit uncle bob's pancake house, talking amongst themselves.}
