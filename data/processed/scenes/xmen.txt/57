<L>__{interior magneto's lair cell later night}
<A>__{a cell with bars, but no visible door. kelly is hunched over his toilet, heaving. his suit is rumpled and dirty, showing signs that time has passed. there is a television just outside the door: we see several news helicopters circling a platform built against the backdrop of the main entrance to ellis island. we see massive security measures, the likes of which have never been attempted, being prepared. (voice plays over the rest of the scene)}
<C>__{newscaster }
<D>__{is there such a thing as too much security? a possible complication adding to the united nations anniversary is the sheer number of security personnel for what will be the largest single summit in the history of the planet.}
<A>__{he walks towards the cell and tries to look down the hall, pressing his face to the bars.}
<C>__{newscaster }
<D>__{while the secret service has never had difficulty handling one or even several world leaders, it has never had to handle the daunting task of watching over all of them.}
<A>__{it is only then that he hears a slight crack and his head squeezes between the bars like a soft shelled egg. he gasps in pain, but more from shock. he pulls his head back with some difficulty and pop, it squeezes right back through.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{what have you bastards done to me?}
<A>__{kelly is horrified. disgusted. he paces the cell, unable to comprehend what has happened to himself. it is only when he hears the sound of a helicopter in the distance that he reacts. he starts to panic, then collects himself. then he goes over to the bars again. he pauses, afraid... then: he pops his head through again. he turns his shoulder toward the bars and begins to push. his feet slip in the floor and his fingers stretch and crack inside, then his ribs begin to pop one by one with the brittleness of undercooked spaghetti. it is agonizing, but kelly finally manages to pull his horribly altered body through the bars.}
