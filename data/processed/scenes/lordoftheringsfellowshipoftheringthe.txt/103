<A>__{frodo, sam, and merry and pippin tumble head over heels down a bank, onto a dark, wooded road. close on: a winded pippin, his face inches away from a large pile of horse droppings...}

<D>__{mushrooms!}
<A>__{close on: small, brown mushrooms growing amongst the loamy undergrowth. sam, merry, and pippin race toward the mushrooms! frodo is tense and watchful. he realizes they are on a wooded road. scattered leaves rise into the air whirling down the road as if blown by an invisible wind...}
<B>__{suddenly... the sound of horses hooves...}
<C>__{frodo}
<D>__{i think we should get off the road.}
<A>__{a long drawn wail comes down the wind, like the cry of some evil and lonely creature.}
<C>__{frodo }
<P>__{(more urgency)}
<D>__{get off the road!}
<A>__{sam grabs merry and pippin as the hobbits quickly scramble down the bank, hiding under a mossy log. the sound of hooves is close... a sinister mounted ringwrath steps into view...hooded and faceless, mounted on a huge snarling black horse with insane eyes ! frodo freezes in terror. the ringwraith pauses right beside their hiding place...he sits very still with his head bowed, listening. from inside the hood comes a sniffing noise as if he is trying to catch an elusive scent; his head turning from side to side. close on: frodo beads of sweat gather on his brow. the ringwraith suddenly slides off his horse, leaning over the mossy log, peering suspiciously into the woods. close on: frodo he is drawing the ring out of his pocket, with trembling hands...his face fevered and sweating as if in the grip of some terrible internal struggle. the sound of sniffing intensifies as the ringwraith darts his head from side to side like a bird of party. close on: frodo squeezing his eyes shut... quick psychic blasts! and evil dark tower...a great eye...a}

<A>__{angle on: sam looking at frodo with concern}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{frodo?}
<A>__{merry desperately hurls the mushrooms across the road...the ringwraith spins around at the sound, and darts to the far side of the road with frightening speed. frodo instantly slumps...as if a psychic link had been broken}
<C>__{merry}
<D>__{what was that?}
<A>__{frodo is staring, a look of shock on his face at the ring lying in the palm of his hand.}
