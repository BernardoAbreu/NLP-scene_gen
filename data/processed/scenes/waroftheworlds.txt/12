<C>__{friend 4}
<D>__{solar flare, that's what this guy told me.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{a solar flare?}
<C>__{friend 4}
<D>__{yeah, the sun shoots off blobs of plasma, they turn into solar flare flashes. it's the only thing that can kill all of the electronic stuff.}
<C>__{friend 3}
<D>__{can i say something?}
<C>__{friend 4}
<D>__{what bro?}
<C>__{friend 3}

<C>__{friend 4}
<D>__{bro, i'm just telling you what that guy said he heard.}
<C>__{friend 3}
<D>__{i know but it just sounds dumb saying that...}
<A>__{ray and his friends walk up to this hole in the ground where everyone else is gathered around.}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{i never seen anything like this before. that many strikes of lighting in one spot.}
<A>__{the cops start ushering people to stay back away from the hole.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{is this the only place?}
<A>__{ray picks up a stone that is white next to all the black asphalt crumbs. he switches it from hand to hand because it is too cold to hold in one hand.}
<C>__{friend 4}
<D>__{is it hot?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{no. it's freezing.}
<A>__{the police officers and the other people gathered around feel a vibration under their feet.}
<C>__{cop 2}
<D>__{what is that?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you feel that?}
<C>__{friend 3}
<D>__{yeah, i feel that.}
<C>__{friend 4}
<D>__{what is it the subway?}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{there's no subway here.}
<C>__{friend 4}
<D>__{path train maybe?}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{that can't be the water main.}
<C>__{cop 2}
<D>__{there's nothing else down there.}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{the water main doesn't run through here.}
<C>__{cop 2}
<D>__{well, there's something down there and it's moving.}
<A>__{the pavement starts to crack into a wider circle. people start running away from the crack as it gets bigger and bigger. windows start to crack under pressure as the pavement separates even more. entire sheets of road split into pieces causing everyone on the road to loose their balance. shots of more shattering windows. busting pipes. the church starts cracking apart and moving with a giant circle of pavement that moves. the pavement lurches up and then caves down. a few cars go tumbling in. something throws the last car that tumbled in back out flying through the air as a leg of the robot makes a lurch out of the hole. the police continue trying to move people away. the engines of the ship start coming out as they power up. the entire ship comes out and begins dusting it's self off. ray and his friends hide behind a building.}
<C>__{friend 4}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<A>__{ray begins walking out from behind the building.}
<C>__{friend 4}
<D>__{ray, no, stay man.}
<A>__{the machine makes a large vibrating noise as if calling out to other robots. it arms it's disintegrator beams and opens fire. people can be seen to disintegrate as they are struck with the beam. the beams, when fired make a zap sound. people start exploding into dust and their clothes are blown away. ray misses numerous beams by a foot or two as he goes into a convenience store. again ray runs out the back door and misses another beam by inches. he runs his ass off trying to escape the robot. disintegrator beams strike off rooftops to clear a walking path. ray hides behind a building as the machine walks by.}
