<A>__{hazel pushes gus, now confined to a wheelchair, to their spot on the hill overlooking "funky bones." a second picnic, this time with champagne. hazel pours some for them both into little winnie the pooh cups. she's trying to be upbeat but it's difficult. gus watches the kids play on the bones.}

<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i know it's kid's stuff but... i always thought i'd have a grand story to tell, you know? something that would run in all the papers. i always thought i was special.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{you are.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{yeah but... you know what i mean.}
<A>__{hazel, annoyed finishes her cup, tosses it to the side. gus can tell he's said something wrong.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i do know what you mean, i just... i don't agree.}
<A>__{hazel stands up, anger building.}

<D>__{hazel }
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{you think the only way to live a meaningful life is for everyone to love you, for everyone to remember you. well guess what, gus, this is your life. this is all you get. you get me, and your family, and this world. and if that's not enough, well i'm sorry, but it's not nothing. cause i will remember you, i will love you }
