<L>__{exterior the heights late afternoon}
<A>__{carter comes through a wooded area. he pauses by a lake, now overgrown with weeds. a big man stands tossing stones into the water. carter silently picks up a dead branch then runs at the man. carter whacks him on the head and he collapses unconscious into the lake. carter moves on towards the house. marty and ray the two men previously seen in the land rover, are playing with an alsatian on the spacious lawn fronting the house. it's a victorian building surrounded by acres of woodland. carter breaks from the trees and darts for the side door. one of the men notices and shouts after him.}
