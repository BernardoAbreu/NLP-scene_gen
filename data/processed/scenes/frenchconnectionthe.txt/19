<L>__{int exterior doyle's car night}
<A>__{the view from the back seat of doyle's car. doyle is at the wheel, russo packed uncomfortably into the corner at doyle's right. seventy five yards away on the other side of the street the canopied entrance of the club. a continental is parked in front of the club. the driver leaning on a fender talking with the doorman. doyle frisks his own pockets for a cigarette, coming up with a collection of laundry slips, crumpled notes, toothpicks and matches. one of the slips of paper catches his eye as he is going through the ritual of the cigarette mooch, a slip bearing the name of a girl. his attention is really on the entrance of the club and both his conversation and the cigarette business are detached and incidental to the art of waiting through the stakeout. he stuffs the cards back into his pocket.}

<A>__{as soon as doyle has finished lighting the cigarette sal and his party come bubbling out of the club noisily, a little drunkenly. sal waves to the attentive doorman. doyle close, leaning forward over the wheel to put his hand on the ignition key. he does not turn it. he is waiting for the cover of noise from the starting of sal's car. russo is turning the opposite corner of the car into a bend, his head back, arms across his chest.}

<D>__{i'm telling you, popeye, he owns a bagel mine in the bronx.}
<A>__{a long view of the club entrance. sal and angie, a well built "classy" blonde with good legs, get into their black mercury sedan. the mercury takes off towards first avenue. we hear doyle's car start and we move off after them on the last blink of tail lights at the corner.}
