<A>__{he unrolls a satchel full of different gardening tools. suddenly shrek's arms and legs are strapped into a chair. a man stands with his back to the camera and pulls on a rip cord as if he's holding a chain saw. vroom! vroom! he turns around to reveal a circular sander and starts to grind away at shrek's gruesome toenails. shrek cringes. we see a close up of shrek's eye. a mascara brush comes into frame and pulls at shrek's eyelash. fiona gets her nose hairs plucked.}

<A>__{lipstick is applied to some lips. the camera pulls back to reveal that the lips are shrek's. a hand tries to tighten a zipper on shrek's back. it keeps snagging on the skin until they finally rip it past and tighten up the zipper all the way. a small sock is placed onto shrek's foot. with a shoe horn, shrek's foot is shoved into a small shoe. pop! a collar is placed around fiona's neck and her corset is tightened. a drill comes into frame and tightens the rivet on shrek's belt. a mole is placed on his cheek.}
