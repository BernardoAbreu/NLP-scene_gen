<L>__{exterior the town of orange day}
<A>__{orange, pronounced "au ronge", is a mid sized town of fifty thousand souls. it is small, charming, quaint, and it has one particular thing that no other town in france can claim an ancient roman theater that has been painstakingly restored. we see this roman theater from the outside, as we move through the streets of the town, to the town square. it's packed every seat in every outdoor cafe is filled with a tourist having breakfast. this normally quiet place explodes one month out of the year, when an internationally famous music festival is held in the roman theater. we come upon a table of american tourists: a family. dad is angry at mom.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{opera? this is an opera festival?}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{i told you that, henry.}
<C>__{dad}
<D>__{i thought you meant phantom of the opera. you know, andrew lloyd weber, cats, that kind of thing.}
<A>__{mom and dad continue their discussion, but we've left them behind, moving through the seats and cafes until we get to a cafe on the outskirts of the town square. here, in the most removed table in the entire square, we find gregor sitting in the shadow of the trellis. unless you're on top of him you can't see him, but he can see everything perfectly. his cell phone sits on the table in front of him he picks it up and starts to punch in a number.}
