<L>__{interior medical clinic later}
<A>__{carrie sits in sullen silence, the room dark around her. the only light bounces in from a sterile, draped area where doc works on her hand. she can't watch as his curved suture and thread, rises and falls with every stitch he makes. carrie has her attention on bloody gauze piled up in a tray }
<T>__{smash cut to:}
<A>__{carrie's memory hit: an image she saw earlier: the well defined chest of a man wearing a t shirt. a bullet hole oozes dead center. this time we stay there a little longer, watching the t shirt absorb the blood around the wound. as the stain widens, so does the camera... slowly... bringing into picture the man carrie shot. he's wearing a marshal's badge around his neck.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{there, finished.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{carrie looks at him, sullen, afraid to look down. then slowly lets her eyes drift to her hand.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{it's going to be an adjustment.}
<A>__{he rises. goes to a medicine cabinet. selects a pill bottle. shakes it. only a couple inside. he returns with the pill bottle.}
<C>__{doc }
<D>__{should ease the pain. i will look around, dig some more up for you.}
<A>__{she stares at the vacant spot where her fingers used to be.}
