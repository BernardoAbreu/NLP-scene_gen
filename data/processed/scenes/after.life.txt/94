<L>__{interior jack's house. kitchen evening}
<A>__{jack opens the fridge. it's almost empty. he takes out a carton of milk. sniffs it. recoils from the smell. from the living room we hear the loud sound of a tv.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(shouts)}
<D>__{mom! we're out of milk.}
<A>__{there's no reply. jack grabs his jacket.}
<L>__{interior funeral home. prep room evening}
<A>__{anna's still sitting on the floor. the place is clean and ordered again. she watches eliot unzip a garment bag. he lifts out a plain black dress.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{it's your dress. for your funeral. your mother brought it round this morning.}
<A>__{as eliot takes out a pair of shiny black shoes from a plastic bag, anna moves haltingly over to the dress. she touches the material puzzled.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{this isn't my dress.}
<P>__{(realizes with shock)}
<D>__{this is my mother's dress! it was supposed to be for her funeral. why has she given it to me?}
<A>__{eliot starts folding the plastic bag. he notices something else inside. he opens the bag. hesitates then takes something out. on eliot's hand an old fashioned wooden rosary.}
<B>__{prep room}
<A>__{eliot looks at it for a moment. then glances over at anna. she's still staring at the dress. he opens a drawer beneath the counter. it's full of rosaries and printed holy cards. he quickly drops the rosary into the drawer. closes it. then turns back to anna.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it should have been her not me.}
<P>__{(turns to eliot)}
<D>__{she was the one dying. not me.}
<A>__{eliot unlocks the door. jams it open with a door stop. slips his keys back into his jacket pocket. takes off his jacket and hangs it up. he moves over to a collapsible gurney folded on the floor. bends down and snaps open the side rails. anna looks at the open door.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i'm not ready to die.}
<A>__{eliot looks up at anna sadly.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{why are you still struggling?}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(plaintively)}
<D>__{i'm not ready to die. not yet.}
<A>__{she glances at the open door again. eliot follows her look.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{there's nothing out there for you anymore.}
<A>__{as eliot turns back to the gurney, anna notices eliot's jacket hanging beside her. realizes the keys are in the pocket. she quickly glances back at eliot. he's still busy adjusting the gurney. she leans over to his jacket.}
<B>__{on eliot}
<A>__{as he gets up and turns to anna.}
<B>__{prep room}
<A>__{anna looks at him calmly. we can't tell if she managed to get his keys or not. eliot pulls on his jacket and wheels the gurney through the door. he steps back into the room. nudges the door stop away with his foot.}
<C>__{eliot}
<D>__{i will be back soon.}
<A>__{the door locks behind him with a click.}
