<A>__{we are close on ray now as we hear the sound of a reverend reading wedding vows. ray holds the ring, and waits for his cue to offer it. but he has forgotten the cue. and every time the reverend pauses, he starts to offer the ring. dorothy's leg and hand are visible in frame. she calms him with a hand on the shoulder. and finally the cue comes and he offers the ring.}
