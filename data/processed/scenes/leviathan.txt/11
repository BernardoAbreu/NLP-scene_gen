<L>__{interior infirmary same}
<A>__{close on sixpack's eye. we pull back to see it is being examined by doc who frowns.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{let's see your tongue.}
<A>__{sixpack obliges as beck enters.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{pretty good imitation of a hangover and i ought to know.}
<C>__{sixpack}
<D>__{well, it ain't! it feels a thousand times worse.}

<D>__{i...i dunno. i just feel... wrong.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{take off your shirt.}

<C>__{doc }
<P>__{(concerned)}
<D>__{how long...how long have you had these?}
<C>__{sixpack}
<P>__{(surprised, scared)}
<D>__{shit, doc...i didn't know i had them.}
<A>__{doc peers closely at the skin where it's discolored. it's a different texture. beck watches as doc touches a spot and sixpack screams in agony. doc and beck lock eyes. beck's quarters same close on martin on beck's video monitor. he is drinking a cup of coffee.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{...as long as you know it's not in your contract.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{i know that.}

<C>__{beck}
<D>__{how's the weather for pickup tomorrow?}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(looking at a report, then up at beck)}
<D>__{beautiful.}
<A>__{the swamp morning the crew members climb into their suits.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{bad as he is there's no way we can make our quota with out his sad self out there. you just can't do it.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{he's tanking on us...}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{no...he's really sick. i heard him last night. the company will take that into consideration...}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{honey, the company don't give a flying fuck about "whys," they just look at the numbers and the contract says if we miss our quota they only got to pay us half pay for the entire month.}
<C>__{dejesus}
<P>__{(convinced)}
<D>__{'cocksucker's tanking on us...}
<A>__{suddenly all eyes go to the door, beck enters.}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(to dejesus)}

<A>__{the crew increases its bitching...}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{there goes our quota...}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{thirty days, right down the toilet...}
<A>__{beck ignores them and goes to the control rack which sends the suits around the room and pushes number 8 his suit. dejesus and jones share a look. bowman and willie watch him carefully. as beck's suit stops in front of him the room is quiet, they can't believe their eyes. awkwardly, beck tries to get into his suit. cobb breaks the silence.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{excuse me, sir...}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{is this a contract violation, mr. cobb?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{no sir...i just wanted to know if you needed a hand?}
<A>__{beck sees he's sincere, then looks at the others and willie. she nods slightly. beck turns back to cobb.}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{thanks...}
