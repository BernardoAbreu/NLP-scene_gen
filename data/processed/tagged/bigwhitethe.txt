<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i understand mr. barnell, but here's the thing. with no actual body, under alaskan statutes a person must be missing for seven years before he or she can be legally declared dead and that's not withstanding an investigation period where concerned parties can take up to another year to file interventions concerning the motion. so, even though your brother's status is undetermined at this point, there's really very little we can do for you.}

<D>__{ok then. ok.}
<A>__{he packs in the remaining space with beer and pop bottles. then, just before he shuts the door, paul reaches in and sets the fridge temperature from 1 to 9 (the coldest setting). a padlock and chain come from the base of a propane bbq. it goes around the fridge, the lock snaps it in place. paul spots some leftover drink cans. he kicks them to the corner and walks into the house, trying to sound casual.}

<C>__{gary }
<D>__{so what'd you collect?}
<C>__{paul}

<D>__{hello brother.}

<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{in certain lines of quasi legal employment, using your actual id can be a hinderance. but despite the reliance on aliases, it's nice to have your actual birth certificate to fall back on. gotta tell ya, paul, i was pretty pissed.}

(cont'd) paul, you ready?}
<A>__{paul looks up to see margaret. dressed in a coat, she is standing in the middle of the living room, now empty save for a few boxes and a very ugly floor lamp. paul flips margaret's letter over, and we now see it is the faded hawaiian hilton postcard from the box in his den. paul puts the postcard in a shoe box full of keepsakes, and tucks it under his arm. margaret picks up jodie, whose in his carrying case, and walks over. a car horn sounds from outside. it's their cab. as they walk to the door...}
