<L>__{exterior rock ridge night}
<A>__{conan watches the great wall silently, absently playing with a dagger in his hand as he gauges the many guardposts along the wall. the archers. the barrels of oil. the cavalry. he feels eyes upon him and looks down at tamara, still bound and gagged, her eyes burning holes in his forehead. conan pulls out her gag.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{you will keep quiet.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{what use is talking? you won't believe a word i speak. i only want to know this how will you kill khalar? you are too big to play the assassin.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{you will be the lure that will draw me close. then i will scale the wall and cut him down where he stands.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{and the archers and cavalry? they will be napping?}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{they will not be a problem.}
<A>__{tamara thinks about it.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{no. not good enough.}
<A>__{conan is shocked by her brazen response.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{did i ask?}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{should you fail, i will be left without a weapon, helpless in my enemies hands. let me help, conan.}
<A>__{conan responds by putting the gag back in her mouth.}
<C>__{conan}
<D>__{i will not fail.}
<A>__{but still tamara glares at him and we can see the hint of conan's resolve bending.}
