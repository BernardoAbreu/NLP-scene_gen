<L>__{interior lecture room. law school. day}
<A>__{the group is back in the big hall. but the atmosphere is grim. it's a while before dieter speaks.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{i don't know. i don't know what we're doing any more.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{don't you?}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{you keep telling us to think like lawyers, but there's something disgusting about this.}
<A>__{rohl is very still, like an analyst who is finally leading his patient to the heart of things.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{how so?}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{this didn't happen to the germans. it happened to the jews.}
<A>__{everyone is shocked at his violent passion.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{what are we trying to do?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{we're trying to understand.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{six women locked three hundred jews in a church, and let them burn. what is there to understand? tell me, i'm asking : what is there to understand?}
<A>__{michael can't answer. dieter gets up, outraged now.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{i started out believing in this trial, i thought it was great, now i think it's just a diversion.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{yes? diversion from what?}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{you choose six women, you put them on trial, you say `they were the evil ones, they were the guilty ones'. brilliant!}
<C>__{dieter }
<D>__{because one of the victims happened to write a book! that's why they're on trial and nobody else. do you know how many camps there were in europe?}
<A>__{dieter turns, furious.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{people go on about how much did everyone know? `who knew?' `what did they know?' that isn't the question. the question is `how could you let it happen?' and better `why didn't you kill yourself when you found out?'}
<A>__{one of the group walks out.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{thousands! that's how many. there were thousands of camps. everyone knew.}
<A>__{dieter's passion is so great that everyone is shaken.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{look at that woman...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{which woman?}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{the woman you're always staring at. i'm sorry but you are.}
<A>__{michael is white. the atmosphere is electric.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i don't know which woman you mean.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{you know what i'd do? put the gun in my hand, i'd shoot her myself.}
