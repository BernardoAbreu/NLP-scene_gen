<L>__{exterior forest day}
<A>__{bobby is leading the horse and hector walks on ahead. the going is easy through the ferns and grasses. bobby for a moment forgets his apprehensions and starts to sing loudly.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i see her in the dewy flowers i see her sweet and fair...}
<A>__{his voice rings sharply around the forest. hector far ahead turns around, taken by surprise. bobby has frightened himself too. he eyes the forest all around as the echo of his voice fades. chastened, he begins to sing again, quietly this time, under his breath.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{there's not a bonny bird that sings but minds me o' my jean...}
