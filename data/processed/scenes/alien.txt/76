<L>__{exterior top of pyramid night}
<A>__{the dust blows and howls as standard and melkonis arrive at the top, lights bobbing in the darkness.}
<C>__{standard}
<P>__{(puffing with exertion)}
<D>__{here's his line. we can haul him out of there if we have to.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{it'll yank him right off his feet if he's not expecting it. the line could get tangled in something.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{but what can we do? he's out of radio contact.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{maybe we should just wait a few more minutes.}
<A>__{standard hesitates, clinging to the lip of the hole.}
<C>__{standard}
<P>__{(making up his mind)}
<D>__{no, i told him to be out in ten minutes. it's been much longer. let's get him out of there.}
<A>__{standard pulls himself up and crouches precariously on the edge of the tunnel. he begins to fiddle with the winch mechanism from which broussard's line dangles.}
<C>__{standard }
<D>__{the line's slack. christ, do you think the idiot unhooked himself?}
<A>__{he switches on the winch motor. with a whine, it begins to reel the line in. after a moment, the line tightens with a jerk and the motor slows down, laboring under the added weight.}
<C>__{standard }
<D>__{there, it caught!}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{is it still coming up, or is it hooked on something?}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{no, it's coming.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{can you see anything?}
<A>__{standard shines his light down into the hole.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{no, i can't see far enough. the line's moving, though.}
<A>__{for a moment, the two men hang to the narrow top of the pyramid, saving their strength, while the line reels in and the wind howls. then standard shines his light back down in.}
<C>__{standard }
<D>__{i can see him! here he comes!}
<A>__{the winch begins to labor heavily.}
<C>__{standard }
<D>__{get ready to grab him!}
<A>__{broussard appears at the top of the pit, dangling limply from the wire. standard reaches for him then recoils sharply.}
<D>__{standard (cont'd) look out ! there's something on his face !}
<A>__{melkonis attempts to come to his aid.}
<D>__{melkonis what is it ? standard don't touch him, watch it !}
<A>__{in their panic and confusion, the men teeter momentarily, finally regain their balance. they shine their lights on broussard. he appears to be completely unconscious and the octopus thing is still wrapped around his face, motionless.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{oh god, oh god no.}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{help me i'm going to try to get it off.}
<A>__{with his gloved hands, standard grasps the tentacled mess and tries to pull it from broussard's head.}
<C>__{standard }
<D>__{it won't come it's stuck.}
<C>__{melkonis}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{how the hell should i know? come on, give me a hand, let's get him out of there!}
<A>__{the two men grapple with broussard's limp body, lifting him from the hole.}
