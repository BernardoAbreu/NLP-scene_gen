<L>__{interior diner night}
<A>__{a brightly lit hopperish place. lilly sits alone in a booth eating a bowl of chili and reading a newspaper folded beside the bowl. a drunk with a great deal of faith in his own charm sits with a male friend at the counter, drinking coffee. the drunk keeps looking toward lilly, grinning, commenting playfully to his friend, who's bored by it all. lilly doesn't seem to be aware of him. the drunk rises from his stool, turning toward lilly, staggering slightly. his friend makes a small move to stop him, then shrugs and lets him go. the drunk makes his way to lilly's table, leans on it.}
<C>__{drunk}
<D>__{pretty woman like you shouldn't eat alone. whadaya wanna eat alone for?}
<A>__{lilly gives him a flat look.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{go away.}
<A>__{she looks past him toward the waitress behind the counter.}
<C>__{lilly }
<P>__{(calling)}
<D>__{could i have some coffee, please?}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{right away.}
<C>__{drunk}
<D>__{we could have coffee together. my name's kenny.}
<A>__{lilly looks over at the drunk's friend, who pointedly ignores the situation.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{your pal wants you.}
<A>__{the drunk could turn mean; his gesture brushing away the idea of his friend is stronger than necessary.}
<C>__{drunk}
<D>__{let him find his own pretty woman.}
<A>__{the waitress arrives, with the coffee pot and a mug. she puts the mug on the table, pours coffee.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{this fellow bothering you, ma'am?}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{waitress}
<P>__{(to the drunk)}
<D>__{why don't you go sit down?}
<C>__{drunk}
<D>__{i will sit here. move over.}
<A>__{the drunk wants to sit beside lilly, who looks to the waitress to solve the problem, but the waitress stands there with the coffee pot, looking helpless. the drunk bends to slide onto the seat. lilly, exasperated, rabbit punches him in the throat. the drunk, astounded and in pain (and not breathing), staggers back, flailing, hitting the waitress's arm so that she slops coffee on him as his feet tangle and he falls heavily onto the floor. lilly, suddenly concerned, slides out of the booth.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{oh! are you all right?}
<A>__{she goes to one knee beside the drunk, who clutches his own throat with both hands, retching as he tries to inhale. lilly looks up at the astonished waitress.}
<C>__{lilly }
<D>__{i shouldn't have hit him that hard. i guess i don't know my own strength.}
<A>__{the drunk's friend arrives and helps lilly get the drunk to his feet. the drunk is breathing now, but shaken. he looks at lilly with reproachful eyes. his friend transfers his annoyance at the drunk to lilly.}
<C>__{friend}
<D>__{you didn't have to do that.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(matter of fact)}
<D>__{i thought i did. you should take better care of your friend.}
<C>__{drunk}
<P>__{(mumbled)}
<D>__{outta here.}
<A>__{the drunk and his friend head for the exit, as lilly turns to the waitress.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{i'm sorry a lady can't eat in here without being bothered.}
<A>__{the waitress is apologetic, and also in awe of lilly.}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{it won't happen again, ma'am, i promise. dinner's on the house. more chili? dessert? we have lovely pecan pie, my husband makes it himself.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{that sounds nice. pecan pie. thank you.}
<A>__{lilly sits down as the waitress goes back behind the counter. an angle on the waitress, as she puts down the coffee pot, brings out the pecan pie, prepares to slice it, pauses, looks with wonder toward lilly.}
