<A>__{with ray driving like a maniac, crow horse is turned around in his seat, watching the federal cars spreading out, the chopper moving in.}

<D>__{ray. can you hear me? you are fucked. there's no way out of this. if you won't listen to your own laws, then listen to this:}

<D>__{yellow bird committed suicide at three o'clock this morning. some gung ho agent from d.c. pushed him into a corner. you're playing a losing game. pull over.}
<A>__{ray takes the mic and for some reason, he's putting it inside his jacket near his shoulder where he keeps his leather. crow horse looks at him, puzzled. and then the sound comes forth, the static crackling of a micro cassette recorder.}
