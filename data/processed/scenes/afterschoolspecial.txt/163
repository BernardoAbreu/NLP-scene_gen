<L>__{interior william wall high school hallway day}
<A>__{deacon walks down the hallway with matt and fred, and holding rachael's hand. the four of them run into wendy and kelly.}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{hey, guys. hey, deacon. i heard naomi broke up with you.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{yeah. but i think it worked out better this way.}
<A>__{rachael smiles.}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{hey, fred. i hear you know a thing or two about giving women pleasure.}
<A>__{fred freezes. he steels himself, trying to build up the nerve to say what he wants to say. then,}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{no, i don't.}
<A>__{she's disappointed. the whole gang hangs their heads. then,}
<C>__{fred }
<D>__{matt knows a thing or two about pleasuring women. i know everything.}
<A>__{fred smiles ear to ear. wendy laughs, duly impressed.}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{we should go out some time.}
<A>__{kelly looks at matt seductively.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{maybe all four of us could go out.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{that could work, you know, depending on my schedule.}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{cool. so call me.}
<A>__{they walk off just as jake pushes deacon from behind.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{watch where you're going, sphincter boy.}
<A>__{but he's dealing with a totally new and improved deacon now.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{i thought i told you not to call me that anymore.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{what are you going to do about it?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{some people never learn.}
<A>__{matt pulls out a funky remote control. he hits a button and all the monitors come on up and down the hallway. students stop to look up at them.}
<B>__{on the monitors}
<D>__{plays a specially edited version of the infamous first attempt at making the porno, aptly titled, "william h. wall high school presents: the premature e jake ulator."}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i've got a tiny pee pee? i'm a premature e jac u la tor?}
<B>__{hallway}
<D>__{jake is horrified.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{stop it! stop the video!}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you probably shouldn't have mailed that tape back to us. the video starts repeating in continuous loop, but has been edited to sound like a rap song.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{tiny pee pee. tiny pee pee. e jac u la tor. e jac, e jac, e jac u laaaaaaa tor. students point and laugh at him, while deacon and the guys continue on down the hallway, dancing to the beat. deacon kisses rachael goodbye.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{you know, guys, i've been thinking about something.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{about how making the movie didn't turn out to be so fun. i think i figured out why. they stop at their lockers.}
<C>__{deacon }
<D>__{sex is like a comic book, still in the original wrapper. once you open it up and read it, it loses its value.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{deep.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i think he's got something there. making that movie felt like we were tampering with forces we couldn't possibly understand.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{exactly. the fun part about high school is unravelling the mystery of what's going to happen nexterior the guys smile and dial the combinations on their lockers. in the background, jake is still on the ground crying. we track through the hallway, outside...}
