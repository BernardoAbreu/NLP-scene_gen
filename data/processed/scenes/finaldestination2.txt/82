<A>__{the wood chipper roar s loudly. suddenly, some forgotten stray chunk shoots from the spout the airborne chunk of wood cracks the white van's windshield. steve veers out of control. kat sees the white van ahead swerving into her lane. she quickly jerks the wheel to the right. kat's left front tire blows! it sends rubber flying and the entire suv pulls hard to the left, spinning her out of control into the oncoming lane of traffic toward the white van! isabella screams! steve jerks the wheel to the left! the white van has a close near miss with the expedition, and goes off the road toward a lake!}

<B>__{the expedition}
<A>__{the dust settles in the silent car. the only sound is a quiet, wet wheeze. clear, dazed, looks around carefully, avoiding the metal spike that skewers the vehicle. rory holds his trembling hand before his eyes as if amazed to see it. kimberly shakes her hair, spilling glass onto the floor. kat tries to open the door, but it won't budge.}
