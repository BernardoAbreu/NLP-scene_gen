<L>__{interior wavey's kitchen later}
<A>__{close on quoyle. he is happily washing a mountain of dishes and cups.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{so the newfie drills another hole in the ice, aways off from the first one. once again, the voice booms, no fish down here!}
<A>__{pull back to see wavey beside him. she's drying what he washes.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{so he moves way down the ice. drills another hole. voice comes again, i said, no fish down here!}
<A>__{they don't look at each other. poker faced, just alike, working side by side.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{the newfie looks around. still nobody. hollers, who are ya? the voice o' god? voice comes back, no! the arena manager!}
<A>__{he can't help but snort out a chuckle of his own. sneaks a look over at her, and she... ...laughs out loud. healthy. sexy, even. but from the delay, he guesses...}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{heard it before, huh?}
<A>__{she looks over at him. her eyes dance a little.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{sometimes, passion in performance. beats the element of surprise.}
<A>__{and he is lost in those eyes. knows it's showing. glances away to where... ...bunny sits in a corner. reading to a rapt herry.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{you guys hungry?}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{shhh. i'm teaching herry to read. just like i did warren.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{is he learnin'?}
<A>__{bunny looks over at him. he is so dumb.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{first is the teaching part. the learning comes later.}
<A>__{herry nods. later. and out of the blue...}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{wavey? now are the berries ready to pick?}
<A>__{quoyle looks over to the woman. but instead of wavey, he sees petal, staring at him with slow predatory heat.}
<C>__{petal}
<D>__{want to pick my berries, do you. should i climb right up on this sink?}
<A>__{and then, once more she is...}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{almost. almost ready. you know, it's all about timing.}
<A>__{quoyle. takes note.}
