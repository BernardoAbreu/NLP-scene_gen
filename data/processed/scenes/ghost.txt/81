<L>__{interior livingroom night}
<A>__{carl, in shirt sleeves and molly in her robe, are sitting on the couch drinking coffee. we notice that carl is wearing yellow suspenders. sam is beside himself, watching them.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{are you alright? you look nervous, upset.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(glancing at her thighs)}
<D>__{what can i tell you. it's been tough. hell, you know. it still hurts so much.}
<P>__{(he poses sadly)}
<D>__{then on top of it all... it's the responsibilities. they've given me my own accounts, but i've had no time to adjust. my mind has been reeling.}
<A>__{molly reaches out and pats his arm. there is an awkward pause.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{where were you this morning? i thought you were coming to the bank to sign those papers.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i didn't have time.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i went to the police, carl.}
<A>__{sam looks at her, amazed. carl, on the other hand, stiffens. he laughs nervously.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{you're kidding. you really did it? i don't believe... what did you tell them? what did they say?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{you were right, you know. i felt like such a fool. they brought out a file on this psychic woman ten inches thick. it was awful.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{a ripoff artist, huh?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{molly, no.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{the sad part is that i believed her. i believed her, carl.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{it was all a sham.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(relaxing)}
<D>__{sometimes we need to believe.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{why?... i was a fool. i don't believe anything anymore. why would people do such things?}
<A>__{sam is devastated.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(milking it)}
<D>__{it's hard to face reality, moll, the hard cold facts of it. what you have to remember is the love you felt. that's what's real. you have to remember how good sam was. how much he loved you.}
<A>__{molly holds back tears. carl reaches out tenderly and strokes her hair.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you were everything to him, molly. you were his life.}
<C>__{molly}
<P>__{(finally crying)}
<D>__{i feel so alone.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{you're not alone. you're young. you've got so much talent. you're fantastically gorgeous.}
<C>__{molly}
<P>__{(appreciating his words)}
<D>__{oh god, i don't know what's real anymore. i don't know what to think.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{just think about sam. think about what he meant to you, the years you had together, how wonderful they were.}
<A>__{carl glides his hand slowly, lovingly across her cheek.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{let your feelings out.}
<A>__{almost imperceptibly, his hand moves down to the nape of her neck. as she moves, her robe opens slightly. carl notices, glimpsing her nakedness beneath it. sam notices, too. he freezes.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{life turns on a dime, moll. people think they have forever, that they'll always have tomorrow. but it's not true. sam taught us that. we have to live for now, for today.}
<A>__{molly can barely contain her tears. carl moves toward her moist cheeks and kisses them gently. slowly, he guides his lips to her neck and kisses it, too. it is all hateful and sensual at the same time. sam turns away. molly feels carl's tenderness, needs it. she does not notice his hand reaching for the cord on her robe and slowly pulling it toward him. with a little tug the cord unravels and the robe falls open. molly is confused, aroused, not sure what to do. she starts to pull it closed. he holds her hand. for a moment they do nothing. then his fingers reach for her thigh. her body quivers. carl feels her openness and pulls closer, his hand rising gently up her naked body. molly's eyes close. she says nothing.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no!!!}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{sam charges wildly at the couch and begins flailing uncontrollably at the two of them. unexpectedly his foot kicks out and hits a framed photograph of him and molly that's sitting on an end table. the picture crashes to the floor, the glass shattering. molly jumps up, the mood suddenly broken. she sees the photo and recoils. carl reaches for her. she backs away. sam is stunned by what has happened. he jumps up and tries kicking over another picture but nothing moves. his foot goes right through it. molly looks at carl, drying her tears.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i can't. i'm sorry. i can't. it's too soon... you've been great carl, but... i need you to leave. please. i need you to.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{sure. it's okay. i understand. i really do.}
<A>__{she reaches out and takes his hand.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{look, what if we have dinner tomorrow night? just talk. can i interest you in that?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no!!!}
<A>__{molly hesitates a moment and then nods her head "yes". carl smiles.}
