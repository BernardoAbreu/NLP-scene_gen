<A>__{driving along the highway. lilly concentrates on traffic. bobo heavily watches her profile, finally speaks.}
<C>__{bobo}
<D>__{bluebell.}
<A>__{lilly's eyes briefly close, her shoulders sag. then she goes back to the silent alert person she'd been. bobo nods.}
<C>__{bobo}
<D>__{how'd you figure you were gonna get away with that?}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{i'm not getting away with anything, bobo.}
<C>__{bobo}
<D>__{you're fuckin right you're not. how much did your pals cut you in for on that nag, huh? or did they give you the same kind of screwing you gave me?}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{i was down on that horse, bobo. not as much as i should have been, but there was a lot of action on those }
<A>__{bobo taps a fingertip against the side of her head to shut her up. she shuts up.}
<C>__{bobo}
<D>__{one question. do you want to stick to that story, or do you want to keep your teeth?}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{i want to keep my teeth.}
<C>__{bobo}
<D>__{now i will ask you another. you think i got no contacts out here? that nag paid off at just the opening price. there wasn't hardly a flutter on the tote board from the time the odds were posted. there ain't enough action to tickle the tote, but you claim a ten grand win! you send me ten thousand dollars, like i'm some mark you can blow off!}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(terrified, broken)}
<D>__{bobo, no, i }

<A>__{it's time for lilly to show tough, and she knows it.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{you do buy it, bobo. i cost you, and i'm sorry.}
<A>__{bobo thinks this over.}
<C>__{bobo}
<D>__{i got a lot of people work for me, lilly. i can't have shit like this.}

<D>__{you're calling the shots.}
<C>__{bobo}
<D>__{you got any kind of long coat in the car? anything you can wear home over your clothes?}
