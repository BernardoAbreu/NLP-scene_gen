<L>__{exterior swamp day}
<A>__{orlean walks through alone, panicked. all the vegetation is greener and crazier looking than we've seen before. things slither by in the water, brush up against her. she tenses, steps into a sinkhole, flails, gets tangled in a vine, which wraps around her leg as she attempts to extricate herself. she falls face forward into the black water.}
<L>__{interior hotel room continuous}
<A>__{orlean snaps awake, bedcovers tangled around her legs. she heaves, looks at the clock. it's 3:30. she stares at the ceiling. she looks at the clock again. it's 3:30. she looks at the clock again. it's 4:10. she closes her eyes. she opens them, looks at the clock, the room is filled with murky water, the bed an island of dryness. an alligator pokes its nose out of the water, begins to climb onto the bed. orlean jumps back, hits her head on the headboard. the room is back to normal. the clock reads 4:23. she closes her eyes. the alarm goes off.}
