<A>__{the english instructor goes over baseball related vocabulary off screen, while miguel glances through his "english for baseball players" notebook. he finds a page with pictures of different foods along with their english names. he looks at all the foods, stops at an image of a fried egg. he circles the word "egg." the instructor finishes up class, and the exhausted latino players get up to leave. marcos stands, leans over to miguel.}
