<L>__{exterior mckenna house later night}
<A>__{the light in the bedroom window is low candlelight, but we sense something watching them. grace's silhouette moves across a window. bobby now comes out of the house, cautious, walking down the driveway. he stops, thinks, and walks back to open the hood of grace's jeep. he reaches into the engine and disconnects something, then closes the hood and walks on.}
