<L>__{129 sue close}
<A>__{seeing this; feeling it all about to lurch out of control and turn against her. the bottom's falling out.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{i will see you around, chris.}
<L>__{130 two shot sue and chris}
<A>__{featuring chris prominently a bloodhound now sure of the scent.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{no. wait. you stopped, remember? so just stop again.}
<P>__{(uglier)}
<D>__{why didn't you walk out? why didn't you walk out, sue?}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{okay, chris. that's enough.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{you didn't walk out, sue... little suze... little suzy creamcheese... because you didn't want to miss a moment of your precious prom.}
<A>__{bulls eye. sue fights back the tears and fury, trembling now. but she tries to muster up some dignity.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{and you don't?}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(not about to be put off)}
<D>__{you're goddamn right, i don't. but we're on your case now.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i will bet you've got your dress all picked out, too. what color is it? yellowguts?}
<A>__{she's about to break, holding it in as best she can. chris just as quickly as she spots the weakness, shuts it off, bottling up all the rage into he cruelest stainless steel smile she can muster.}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{okay.}
<P>__{(dismissively)}
<D>__{see you around, sue.}
<A>__{and that's it shut up, shut down, shut out. sue turns and starts to walk out of the cavalier. in the background behind her, it's all out of focus, an incoherent babble of snickering and clucking laughter. she's crossed the line.}
