<A>__{lynch is sleeping. his head is leaned to one side in a position that is sure to give him the worst stiff neck he's ever had. parker is ancy. she looks all around. thinking. finally she squeezes her eyes shut...embarrassed. her snow pants turn dark around her bottom. slowly a puddle of urine forms on the chair between her and lynch. below them, the urine falls into the snow and disappears. parker's eyes swell as she begins to cry what's left of her tears. she is emotionally degraded and devastated. as her nose begins to run, she instinctively wipes her hand across it...taking a small piece of the dead flesh off of her cheek with it. she doesn't even feel it.}
