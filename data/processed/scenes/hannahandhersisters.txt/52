<A>__{as mickey finishes his speech, the "real" dr. brooks is seen walking into the office. the previous scene had been a figment of mickey's imagination, a nightmare fantasy only. holding mickey's x rays, the "real" dr. brooks walks past the same row of books to the light panel.}

<D>__{i must admit, i was concerned, given your symptoms.}
<P>__{(turning to look at the offscreen mickey)}
<D>__{what caused this hearing loss in one ear, i guess we'll never really know for sure. but whatever it was, it's certainly not anything serious at all.}
