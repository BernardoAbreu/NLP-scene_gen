<L>__{interior upstairs bathroom. night.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{i will.}
<A>__{nancy's in the tub, so drowsy she can hardly rinse without falling asleep. the water in the tub is opaque with suds. luxurious. closer angle, at water level on nancy. her eyes droop. she slides closer to the surface of the water, letting its heat sooth her nerves. her eyes stare straight up, glazed; her breathing deepens. reverse, across to her legs, crooked, one knee on each side of the tub. there's a ripple in the water between. then something tiny and shiny breaks the surface between them. it pops up with a slithering music cue and catches a sliver of light. then it begins to rise. higher and higher it rises, soon accompanied by another, then two more shining, gleaming blades, and then the full glove and dark hairy hand and then the wrist and arm, straight up light an evil sapling between the girl's knees, the knives bloosoming into a bright flower of razor sharp steel in the air, moving over the girl's belly. the hand rears back, the claws arch to strike.}
<P>__{marge (os approaching)}
<D>__{nancy?}
<A>__{marge raps on the door. the instant she does nancy jerks up, opening her eyes groggily. the dark wet arm, hand and knifes are gone.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{marge }
<P>__{(through the door)}
<D>__{you're not falling asleep, are you? you could drown, you know.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{mother, for petesakes.}
<C>__{marge }
<D>__{it happens all the time.}
<P>__{(brighter)}
<D>__{i've got some warm milk all ready for you. why don't you jump into bed?}
<P>__{(fading)}
<D>__{i'm gonna turn on your electric blanket, too. c'mon, now.}
<P>__{(then she's gone into another room)}
<C>__{nancy}
<P>__{(low)}
<D>__{warm milk. gross.}
<A>__{she slides down to water level again, and sings softly, thoughtfully to herself.}
<C>__{nancy }
<D>__{one, two, freddie's coming for you, three four, better lock your door, five six, grab your crucifix, seven eight gonna stay up late, nine ten, never sleep again...}
<A>__{the next instant she's jerked with incredible violence straight down beneath the surface of the tub as if the bottom had suddenly dropped out and she was in a bottomless well!}
