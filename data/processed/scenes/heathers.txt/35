<L>__{exterior cow pasture night}
<A>__{a cow stands sleeping. giggling and drunk, kurt and ram scramble around the cow. uncomfortable and sober, veronica and heather mcnamara look on.}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{is it sleeping, dude?}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{i think so, man.}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{then get over on my side. oh shit, cowtipping is the fucking greatest.}
<C>__{ram}
<D>__{punch it in!}
<A>__{kurt and ram slam their knuckles and then lean against the cow, poised to shove. heather mcnamara manages a smile but veronica glares it away.}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{count of three, guy.}
<C>__{kurt and ram}
<D>__{one. two. three!}
<A>__{an o.s. moo and the jocks' laughter is heard as mud splashes against the mortified faces of veronica and heather mcnamara. deeper in the pasture later in the night kurt stumbles after a more annoyed than scared veronica.}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{"when i get that feeling, i need sexual healing....."}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{yeah, right, asshole.}
<A>__{veronica makes her way up a hill, pausing to compassionately stare at ram on top of a dispirited heather mcnamara. kurt's intoxicated brain has trouble dealing with the incline. majestically, j.d. appears at the top of the hill. kurt squints up the hill and falls over backwards.}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{what is this shit?}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{i'm doing a favor for heather. a double date. i tried to tell you at the funeral but you rode off.}
<C>__{kurt}
<P>__{(still face down)}
<D>__{"feel like making bah da dah bah da dah, feel like making love."}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{another fucking heather.}
<P>__{(harshly laughs)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm feeling kind of superior tonight. seven high schools in seven states and the only thing different was my locker combination. we've broke through the peer pressure cooker. so what if we had to kill miss popularity..}
<A>__{veronica clumsily high heels it up the hill.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{so what? don't smile like that, jesus!}
<C>__{j.d.}
<D>__{our love is god. let's get a slurpee.}
<A>__{j.d. solemnly reaches toward veronica. she, less solemn, takes his hand. their bodies disappear over the hill.}
<C>__{kurt}
<D>__{"and she's buying the stairway to heaven.."}
