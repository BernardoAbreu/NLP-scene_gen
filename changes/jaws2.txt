<ACTION>__{UNDERWATER - DAY Dramatically lit by sunlight filtering down from the surface. A dim shape, massive, threatening, swims towards us from the distance. Then it divides -- what was one is two, and the shape becomes reality; two divers in Scuba gear swimming side by side. They are wearing minimal rubber, considering the cool New England waters: "Farmer John" wetsuits with cut- off legs, assorted sport-diving paraphernalia, including an expensive camera with a flash attachment. One motions "Down there," the other signals "OK, I see it," and they dive deeper, into darker waters, where the shafts of sunlight pour into the depths, broken up by seaweed and floating vegetation into cathedral-like columns of illumination. SEA BOTTOM - DAY The wreck of the working fisherman's boat "ORCA," formerly under the command of the late Captain Quint, deceased these four years. Buried in the sand near it, still connected by rusting strands of cable, the mangled remains of a shark cage, glimmering with stainless steel highlights. A fitful flash of yellow from under a mossy beard -- a battered barrel, similarly tangled. The divers, Bert and Ernie, appear. They're fascinated by the find, and Bert, with the camera, snaps a few flash shots. The rapid sequence of flashes signals the presence of a motor drive camera.}

SEA BOTTOM, THE ORCA Ernie is exploring the abandoned cabin; doors open and shut, moved by invisible currents stirred by his passage. An occasional "Flash!" lights up the bottom as Bert continues snapping away souvenir shots of this local landmark. BERT'S POINT OF VIEW - CAMERA VIEWFINDER (PROCESS) Ernie floats up out of a hatch, sees the camera, and strikes a pose, clowning for the photographer's benefit. A big hand, f.g., motions him up into clear water for a formal portrait. He obliges. Now he floats in front of us, gently paddling his flippers to maintain vertical stability. One flash. Another. Then a large, dim movement in the b.g. Something's out there, moving towards us. Flash. It's bigger, bearing down like a train in a tunnel. Flash! It's on us. Flash! Teeth? Blood? Flash! Blackness, Death. OCEAN BOTTOM, INSERT The camera floats gently down and settles in the sand. A dark red mist eddies by. A last weak flash.}

The jeep slows to a stop, and he takes a flight of stairs leading to a concrete patio two at a time. A classical trumpet solo is playing in the background. Brody charges through a door, then abruptly slows and starts moving warily through a hotel interior: The Holidome, a three-story extravaganza of a motel, where some sort of formal ceremony is already in progress. A banner announces: "Grand Opening Ball -- Amity Scholarship Fund Benefit." Brody crosses under a High School band, arranged dance-band style on a balcony; the trumpet player, Polo, is finishing his solo, the assembled crowd applauds politely. Brody is taking his place with some dignitaries on the dais, as the presiding authority, Amity Mayor Larry Vaughn, begins speaking.}

<ACTION_ALT>__{THE SHARK}
<ACTION>__{surfaces, and moves purposefully towards the gap that separates the police boat from the raft. It lunges at Brody as it passes the launch; the fin hits the taut rescue line, snapping it. ANGLE ON BRODY'S BOAT Brody recoils in horror as the beast rushes past, he spins the wheel and hits the throttle, sending the launch hard to port. Out of control, it runs up on the rocks of Cable Junction.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{INSIDE THE BOAT}

<ACTION_ALT>__{ABOARD THE RAFT}
<ACTION>__{the Kids find some line. Andy coils, and throws. CABLE JUNCTION - THE RAFT Brady catches the Kids' line. He heaves on it with all his might. Nothing. Jackie is hysterical, some of the other Kids are screaming. The Shark's fin catches the taut line, it slides up and over, Brody and the Kids are nearly pulled into the water. The raft doesn't budge.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{UNDERWATER}
<ACTION>__{the mast bends under the strain, but holds the raft stuck fast. CABLE JUNCTION - BRODY AND THE KIDS He sees the winch and hooks on his launch, and makes the towline fast to the steel winch cable; puts it in neutral. The Kids haul their line, trying to bring the steel cable to them. The shark rams their raft, impatient now. Screams and scrambling as they let go their line and try to avoid the beast. Brooke huddles with Sean, Jackie cowers alone. Larry is lashing his big buck knife to a pole, an improvised weapon.}

<ACTION_ALT>__{THE RAFT}

The huge bulk of the Shark, fin cutting the water as it closes in on the confusion.}

<ACTION_ALT>__{THE SHARK}
<ACTION>__{dying. Leaping and convulsing as hundreds of thousands of volts surge through its body, grounded in the salt sea. Hot white fire shimmers like a halo, the fish smokes and stinks, sputters, and dies.}
