<L>__{interior bathroom}
<A>__{it's spectacular. immaculate. and not only spacious, but appointed. the shelves are stacked with jewel like bottles of perfume. kathy's wet dream. as we view her from beneath the glass shelves, she begins inspecting her own found treasure. everything seems to be unashamedly brand new.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{we've struck gold.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{what she also doesn't notice is a pair of ghost glasses lying on the sink. the camera zooms in through the lenses, so that we're now looking at the scene...}
<B>__{through ghost glasses}
<A>__{and a figure passes behind kathy, jolting us. the figure heads for the tub. the camera turns towards the figure, revealing a new level of hell. there's blood spattered everywhere in the bathroom. we pan. the gore is overwhelming. still lost in her personal nirvana, kathy nonchalantly strolls over to the bathtub, drawing back its bloodstained curtain. in a tight shot, she runs the water, which is blood red. on the cut, she brings it up to her face where it's warm, clear and perfect. when she leans back a bit, we see the naked female suicide ghost lying in the bloody tub, wrists slashed, eyes staring at kathy, wickedly. kathy doesn't see her, because she's not wearing the glasses. two words are written in blood on the glass walls surrounding the tub: i'm sorry kathy's oblivious of the suicide, lost in the possibilities of her bathroom. running her hand around the bloody water. she turns the water off... and as soon as she does, a knife pierces the surface of the water.}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{it doesn't get any better than this.}
<A>__{suddenly, the suicide rises up with the rest of her knife, reaching for kathy, when there's banging on the bathroom door. kathy bolts upright.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{we snap out of the ghost glasses, and the bathroom's back to normal. all clean glass block. an empty tub. kathy opens the locked bathroom door... and arthur's standing there, pissed. he yanks her out of the bathroom, into the hall.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what the hell're you doin' up here? didn't i tell you to stay downstairs?}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{yeah, but }
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{where's your brother?}
<C>__{kathy}
<D>__{with maggie...}
<C>__{maggie }
<D>__{he was with me.}
<A>__{they turn to see maggie walking up to them.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{but he scooted off. he's around here somewhere.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you're supposed to watch him, that's what i pay you for!}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(starts yelling)}
<D>__{bobby!}
