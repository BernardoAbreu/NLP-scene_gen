<A>__{the somebody screaming is mr. orange. he lies in the backseat. he's been shot in the stomach. blood covers both him and the backseat. mr. white is the somebody else. he's behind the wheel of the getaway car. he's easily doing 80 mph, dodging in and out of traffic. though he's driving for his life, he keeps talking to his wounded passenger in the backseat. they are the only two in the car.}
