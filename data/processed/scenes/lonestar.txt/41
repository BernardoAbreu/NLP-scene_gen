<A>__{we start on a two foot high statue of a cowboy made from old bullets and shell casings. we pan past a few others, the poses lifted from frederic remington paintings, till we see mikey, gluing together a work in progress, a remington book propped open in front of him. cliff sits at the worktable playing absently with the old bullets spilled out from mikey's bag}
