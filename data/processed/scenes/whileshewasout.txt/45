<L>__{exterior mall parking lot evening}
<A>__{della squints in the blinding headlights. the front of the car looks familiar. it's the gold plymouth! two unseen car doors click open and clunk shut again. the lights abruptly go out. della blinks, her eyes try to adjust to the dim mercury illumination from a pole lamp a few car lengths away. she uneasily turns back to her car.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{i got a gun.}
<A>__{it's a young male voice. the statement stops della dead in her tracks.}
<D>__{chuckie (o.s.) (cont'd) how's about i aim it at your pussy first?}
<A>__{the words are emphasized by another boy's shrill giggling. della freezes. this can't be happening! her eyes are adjusting. the glare phantoms drift out to the limit of her peripheral vision and vanish. she sees three boys in front of her, then a fourth, but she doesn't see any gun.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{what the hell are you playing at?}
<C>__{huey}
<D>__{trust the nigga, we not playin'.}
<A>__{huey is a sweet faced african american decked out in a hip hop style. he's small and skinny and can't be more than eighteen. he's playing to chuckie who's twenty one and looks like a marine gone awol. bracketing them is vinh, a nineteen year old asian punk and tomas, twenty, a latino runaway in an american idol t shirt. della's eyes drift across the group. she suppresses a hysterical giggle but can't resist smarting off.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{what are you? the world's first homeless united nations boy band?}
<C>__{huey}
<D>__{hell, yeah. we just wanna do shows and bone hoes.}
<A>__{huey messes with his zipper.}
<C>__{huey }
<D>__{we got a song fo' yo. it's called "shut up bitch and eat a dick".}
<A>__{huey and tomas snigger. vinh stares at the asphalt.}
<C>__{tomas}
<D>__{and when yo done eating we gonna staple that bitch mouth closed.}
<A>__{chuckie nudges huey and tomas, steps towards della.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{now, now, my little brothers.}
<A>__{the boys fall silent. vinh lights a cigarette. huey shivers.}
<C>__{huey}
<D>__{it gitting cold, chuckie. game's not worth the dime.}
<C>__{della}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{chuckie? at least your parents have a sense of humor.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{parents? i ain't got no parents. i named myself.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<P>__{(to huey)}
<D>__{grab my parka from the back seat.}
<A>__{he pinches huey's cheeks.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{and smile, playa. the dopes game and the game's dope.}
<A>__{chuckie leads huey a few steps to the plymouth. huey ducks into the back seat. chuckie keeps his eyes fixed on della.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{you got a beef with us, mrs. podunk?}
<A>__{della looks defiantly back without answering. chuckie runs his fingers along the hood of the rusty gold plymouth.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{first you put yo hands on my ride! now, i don't know how you was raised but, in my world, laying your hands on someone else's shit is crossing their line! then, you go slipping an incendiary note up under my windscreen wipers.}
<P>__{well, that'd uckie(cont'd)}
<D>__{ch be an invitation to war to me and my ghetto soldiers.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{what? if you hadn't parked like an asshole, we wouldn't be arguing about it right now.}
<A>__{vinh inhales sharply from his cigarette.}
<C>__{vinh}
<D>__{whoah lady!}
<C>__{tomas}
<D>__{keep right on talking that gang a shit, chinga. yo crimes against the click are digging yo grave deep.}
<A>__{della's eyes quickly scan the group for sign of the gun. she can't see one so she gambles they're just mouthing off and makes her move.}
<C>__{della.}
<D>__{go to hell!}
<A>__{della turns towards her car. huey steps out of the shadows wearing chuckie's parka hood up covering his face, startles della.}
<C>__{huey}
<D>__{we already in hell.}
<A>__{della sidesteps him, reaches the back of her car.}
<P>__{rent a cop (o.s.)}
<D>__{any trouble here, ma'am?}
<A>__{everyone turns to see a rent a cop, puffed up like a pigeon in his fur trimmed jacket and russian style cap. it's the same guy della approached earlier when she was looking for spaces except this time his hand is laying casually across the unsnapped holster flap at his hip.}
<C>__{della}
<D>__{not if these delinquents move their barge so i can back up. rent a cop how about it, boys?}
<A>__{chuckie smiles and nudges tomas who starts dancing in a real mocking manner imitating the rent a cop. chuckie pulls a gun from deep in his army jacket pocket and points it straight at the rent a cop's face.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{nah. we not in the mood.}
<A>__{chuckie looks at his friends for approval. huey laughs again, shrill. tomas grins. vinh hunches and looks around. the rent a cop backs away.}
<D>__{rent a cop for jesus' sake.}
<A>__{tomas takes off a small crucifix from around his neck and dangles it in front of the rent a cop.}
<C>__{tomas}
<D>__{say yo prayers old man.}
<A>__{chuckie grins at della while keeping the gun pointed straight at the rent a cop.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{these rent a pig companies are too lame to give their foot soldiers any ammo. liability laws and all that. tough shit!}
<A>__{the rent a cop goes for his pistol anyway. chuckie shoots him in the face.}
<B>__{this moment changes everything.}
<A>__{we thought della was in trouble but now we know she is. the bullet hits the rent a cop in the forehead. blood spurts from the exit wound. he slumps to the asphalt like a marionette whose strings have just been cut. bullet smoke hangs in the air where he once stood. smoke too blackens the bullets entry wound. blood puddles out from the back of his head.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{fuck!}
<A>__{it's clear that chuckie's been acting harder than he is. the hand that holds the gun is trembling. the color drains from his face. all stand riveted in shock. a deathly silence follows. the carol singers can be heard in the distance faintly finishing up silent night.}
<C>__{carol singers }
<D>__{sleep in heavenly peace. sleep in heavenly peace.}
<A>__{chuckie looks to his friends for support but none is forthcoming. the rent a cop's body twitches. chuckie hesitates then raises the gun. he aims and fires. the shot shatters the top of the rent a cop's head. chuckie flinches, closes his own eyes in reflex. della swallows. if she started screaming now, she may never stop. she spins instead and makes for her car door. she's dead if she doesn't get out of here and she knows it.}
<C>__{vinh}
<D>__{she's busting a move!}
<A>__{chuckie opens his eyes. vinh points to della. chuckie looks over and sees della disappear through the door of her explorer. agitation overwhelms him.}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{she ain't going nowhere. we got her ford blocked in, right?}
<A>__{he looks at vinh who nods then at huey.}
<C>__{huey}
<D>__{i don't know nothing.}
<A>__{chuckie looks back at vinh then over at tomas.}
<C>__{tomas}
<P>__{(muttering)}
<D>__{dar candela por el culo!}
<C>__{chuckie}
<D>__{i can just put one through her windshield, right?}
<A>__{no one answers. chuckie turns once more to the rent a cop whose body still twitches in some final death throe.}
<C>__{chuckie }
<D>__{will you just die ?!}
<A>__{he raises the gun. another shot explodes into the night.}
