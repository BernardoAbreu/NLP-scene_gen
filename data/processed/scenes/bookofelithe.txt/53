<L>__{exterior desert town main street day}
<A>__{metal garage doors roll back to reveal darkness within. a pair of headlights fires up. full beam right at us. a vehicle roars out of the darkness onto the street. heavily modified with plate armor and turret mounted weapons. but its original form still recognizable underneath. it's a honda odyssey minivan. once the #1 choice of soccer moms, transformed now into an armored personnel carrier. another minivan roars from the garage behind it. a dodge grand caravan, similarly customized and armed to the teeth. three more cars follow. as eclectic an assortment as you could imagine. a mini cooper. ford explorer. a prius. each adorned with plate armor and weapons. in the lead minivan is redridge, heavily armed. he nods to the driver, who guns the engine. the fleet of armored vehicles moves out, kicking up a great funnel of dust in their wake as they roar out of town.}
