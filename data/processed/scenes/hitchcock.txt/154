<L>__{interior central state hospital ward day}
<A>__{it is a utilitarian institutionalized dining room. several nonviolent inmates eat at different round tables around the room. an attendant watches, and an orderly mops the floor (there are no female patients nor staff members.)}
<B>__{the real ed gein}
<A>__{is at a table with two other patients, including a soft spoken older man, chet. ed is heavier, his hair is whiter, and he is much more at ease than we've ever seen.}
<C>__{orderly}
<P>__{(to the attendant)}
<D>__{guess what i'm doing this weekend?}
<C>__{attendant}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{orderly}
<D>__{claudine and i are driving to chicago with her folks to see that psycho movie.}
<A>__{the attendant pulls the orderly aside, and whispers to him, nodding toward ed. the orderly's jaw drops! it is the coolest thing he's ever heard. he looks at ed like he's a movie star. meanwhile, ed yawns, content. utterly oblivious.}
<C>__{chet}
<D>__{i think you're the happiest guy i've ever known, ed. how you do it?}
<C>__{ed gein}
<D>__{i will tell you. you live your life, and it's unbearable sometimes but there's this secret, chet; a big secret no one else knows or wants to tell...}
<P>__{(he leans a little closer)}
<D>__{... there is a god and he's so big and powerful, he doesn't always remember you're there...}
<A>__{he takes a huge bite blueberry pie.}
<C>__{ed gein }
<D>__{... but if you can get his attention and he sees you're suffering, he'll notice and he'll take care of you. my mother used to tell me she's passed, god bless her the one thing god truly loves and understands is suffering.}
<A>__{he takes a long drink of milk.}
<C>__{ed gein }
<D>__{after all, he invented it.}
<A>__{we pan to discover hitchcock has been watching all this. he turns to the camera.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{and so, gentle viewer, psycho the picture everyone predicted would bring me to wrack and ruin was such a hit that alma and i got to... well, let's just say that we got to keep our house and the swimming pool. and the same critics who despised it went on to call it one of my greatest achievements.}
<A>__{he produces a cigar and wanders towards the exit doors.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock }
<D>__{of course for me, it was just another "moo vie."}
<A>__{as he strolls through the door }
