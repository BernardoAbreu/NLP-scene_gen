<C>__{sam}
<D>__{put her in the truck.}
<A>__{and sam continues with the group... assessing each child's health... tenderly running his hands over their broken, starved bodies... somehow calculating which ones are worse off and pulling them out of line... ... and he reaches the last child and we see that the suv is now packed with children... huddled into every available corner... 10 children in total. there's no more room.}
