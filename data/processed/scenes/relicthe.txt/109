<L>__{into the stairwell, descending two floors! it lands, pounces on bailey}
<A>__{and the marble walls echo with a roar.}

<D>__{bailey!!!}
<A>__{bailey screams in terror as mbwun pins him down!}
<C>__{bailey}
<D>__{nooooo!}
<A>__{close on bailey... three claws close on his neck and wrench hard! there's a horrifying snap as bailey's head comes off! blood spurts all over and drips down the stairs. d'agosta levels his shotgun at the monster and fires, with no apparent effect. when the shots stop echoing we hear screams and frantic barking from the hall. mbwun's green eyes look up and it's forked tongue licks out. the monster leaps past bailey's body and heads for the door! d'agosta, seeing what's happening, screams at the top of his lungs.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{jonathan! don't let it get into the hall!}
<A>__{on jonathan... frozen in the doorway, kawakita by his side. both of them are rigid with horror. disbelief in their eyes. the beast leaps up directly at them as they jump to try and close the door. d'agosta keeps firing until he's pumping an empty chamber. plaster is falling all around. screams resound in the hall of the heavens as d'agosta stumbles up the stairs.}
