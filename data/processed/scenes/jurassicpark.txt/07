<L>__{int ext helicopter in sky dawn}
<A>__{on the helicopter tail is a little blue logo that reads: isla nublar. inside, grant, ellie and gennaro are in the right back row. ellie dozes, her head occasionally dropping onto grant's shoulder, to his discomfort. gennaro looks at papers, trying not to look through the clear plexi bubble at their feet. next to the pilot, nedry chews a candy bar. he offers candy to the back row. grant loses himself, looking out the window. grant's pov the aquamarine blue of the ocean. below the waters there are the shadows of ample marine life. dolphins leap in the air. suddenly the clear scene becomes obscured by clouds. there is turbulence. ellie wakes, glances at grant, then out the window. there is mist and she absently traces her finger in it, shaping a dinosaur figure. now land comes into view and for a moment, the island below them eerily fits right into her doodling.}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{that's isla nublar. buckle up, the descent is a little hairy.}
<A>__{gennaro cinches his belt tightly and half shuts his eyes. nedry takes out a sandwich and cockily loosens his belt. ellie looks every way.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{this is exciting!}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{what is, ellie? where are we going?}
<A>__{grant looks out his window. the helicopter rushes forward, low to the water. ahead, grant sees the island, rugged and craggy, rising sharply}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{looks like alcatraz.}
<A>__{the pilot coughs and rubs his goggles with the back of his hand.}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{there's bad wind shear on this peak.}
<A>__{grant nods. gennaro sweats, watching the pilot tighten his own belt. ellie smiles excitedly as the helicopter starts down. now, a blanket fog. grant can't see a thing out his window. ellie's startled.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{how the hell is he landing this thing?}
<A>__{no answer. grant dimly discerns green branches of pine trees through the mist. some are very close. ellie's hands grasps her seat cushion.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{this is not fun.}
<A>__{grant looks through the plexi bubble at his feet. he sees the giant glowing fluorescent cross below. lights flash at corners of the cross.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{relax, ellie. i'm sure they wouldn't land if it weren't safe.}
<A>__{the copter suddenly shakes violently. ellie grabs grant's hand. gennaro sits straight up, eyes squeezed shut.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{gennaro? this guy knows what he's doing, right? hey, gennaro? i'm talking to you!}
<A>__{another violent shake. grant squeezes ellie's hand back. closeup nedry's hand crushes a packet of crackers. gennaro is soaked. he opens one eye and looks about, very frightened. he speaks a mantra.}
<C>__{gennaro}
<D>__{no problem. relax, relax.}
<A>__{the pilot whispers to himself and corrects slightly. the copter sails sharply the other way.}
<C>__{grant and ellie}
<D>__{whoa!!!!}
<A>__{close on the pilot jerks back the stick. the copter zooms upward. grant's beverage flips to the ground, pours across the floor. nedry's lunch does flying. sandwich, candy, and cracker crumbs hang suspended in the air. now it all free falls onto nedry's lap. grant and ellie lean tightly into each other,}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{i don't like this feeling ...}
<A>__{the pilot swings his gaze, left then right, looking at the pine forest. trees are close, then far, then close. the helicopter drops rapidly. ellie and grant shut their eyes. they brace themselves for the worst. in and out of the mist, the copter descends. tail raised high, nose low, fo r a moment it looks like a strange bug eyes prehistoric animal bucking in its pen. in a flash, it corrects itself. the copter touches down on a heli pad. the sound of the rotors fades and dies. for a second, no one moves. grant lets out a great sigh of relief. gennaro mouths a silent prayer. the pilot stretches his fingers. grant and ellie self consciously shake their hands free of each other. nedry unbuckles and laughs as he brushes off his lap. he turns:}
<C>__{nedry}
<D>__{just think, gennaro }
<P>__{(laughs harder)}
<D>__{ you gotta agree it's funny! these two, they dig up dinosaurs! it's wonderful, isn't it?}
<A>__{nedry pats grant on his shoulder.}
<C>__{nedry}
<D>__{dr. bones, you're going to love this place.}
<A>__{nedry bursts out laughing again as he heads out the helicopter door. a smile comes across gennaro's face. as he smiles he motions with his hands he doesn't mean any harm. grant and ellie stare at him.}
<C>__{pilot}
<D>__{come on folks. gotta get back, there's a storm alert.}
<A>__{rotors turn. outside, a man reaches the copter. he wears a baseball cap over short red hair and he's dressed in phony safari garb. he shakes gennaro's hand. this is ed regis, 35, head of public relations. he throws open the copter door next to grant. big, cheerful smile.}
<C>__{regis}
<D>__{hi! ed regis. real big welcome to isla nublar, dr. grant, dr. sattler. little tough landing here, i know. but you did it! come on down, we're so happy to have you. now, watch your step.}
<A>__{ellie and grant jump into the world of jurassic park.}
