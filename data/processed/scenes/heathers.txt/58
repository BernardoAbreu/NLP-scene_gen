<A>__{heather duke paces the room holding an icepack to her jaw. veronica is on the ground wiping off her bloodied feet.}

<D>__{i said i was sorry.}
<C>__{heather duke}
<D>__{you are out of control. heather and kurt were a shock, but martha dumptruck, get crucial! she dialed suicide hotlines in her diapers.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{you're not funny. ouch!}
<A>__{veronica rubs her feet. heather duks shakes her head.}
<C>__{heather duke}
<P>__{(heather chandleresque)}
<D>__{what. a. martyr. understand; martha couldn't take the heat so she got out of the kitchen. just think what a better place the world would be if every nimrod followed her cue.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{just shut up and turn on the radio. hot probs is on.}
<C>__{heather duke}
<D>__{oh shit, yeah.}
<A>__{heather duke hastens to the radio and flicks it on. ripping open a bag of corn nuts, she sets herself down next to veronica as a troubled male voice cuts the air.}
<C>__{troubled male voice }
<D>__{i know it's supposed to be funny that they never get off the island, but still, sometimes i feel like i'm on that island and gilligan can be just so stupid sometimes.}
