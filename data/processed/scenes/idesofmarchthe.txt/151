<A>__{a wide shot of the darkened gymnasium. stephen sits on a stool in front of a camera lit by a single television light. we're now in tight one person is putting a mic on stephen while the other is applying make up. no one speaks. the sound man then puts and earwig into stephens ear.}
<C>__{sound man}
<D>__{you should be able to hear them...do you hear them?}
<A>__{we hear the buzzing in his ear of the broadcast from new york.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{yeah i can hear them.}
<C>__{sound man}

<C>__{sound man}
<D>__{coming to you in five...four...three...two...}
<A>__{through the earwig we hear an john king.}
<C>__{john king}
<D>__{we now have governor morris's new senior campaign advisor, stephen myers, coming to us from xavier university where senator thompson has just endorsed governor morris, essentially ending this primary race. (to stephen) stephen, can you give us some insight into how this whole thing unfolded?}
