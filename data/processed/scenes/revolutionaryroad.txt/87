<L>__{interior wheeler dining room late afternoon.}
<A>__{frank and the givings' sit with cocktails. it's painfully awkward. moving boxes are everywhere.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{i'm sorry dinner's late. can i get anyone a refill?}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{oh, don't worry. it's nice just to sit for a bit and socialize...you really didn't need to go through all the trouble of cooking. i can see you have a lot to do with packing and what not.}
<A>__{frank looks at april. she avoids his look.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{actually, there's been a change of plans.}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{oh?}
<A>__{john looks up. frank looks at april.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i thought maybe it was obvious... april's pregnant.}
<A>__{april manages a forced smile.}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{oh, april! i can't tell you how pleased i am. oh, but i expect you'll be needing a bigger house, now, won't you?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hold it a second, ma.}
<A>__{john gets to his feet.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{i don't get this.}
<A>__{he fixes frank with the stare of a prosecuting attorney.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{what's so obvious about it? i mean okay, she's pregnant; so what? don't people have babies in europe?}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{oh john, really. i don't think we need to }
<A>__{john holds up a hand.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i'm asking the man a question. if he doesn't want to give me the answer, i'm assuming he'll have sense enough to tell me so.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{suppose we just say that people anywhere aren't very well advised to have babies unless they can afford them.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(nods slowly)}
<D>__{okay. okay; it's a question of money. money's always a good reason...}
<A>__{john paces the room, with his hands behind his back like a detective at a murder scene.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{but it's hardly ever the real reason. what's the real reason? wife talk you out of it, or what?}
<A>__{he turns the force of his smile on april.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{little woman decide she isn't quite ready to quit playing house?}
<A>__{she walks across the room and stabs out her cigarette. then immediately lights another.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{nah, nah, that's not it. i can tell. she looks too tough. tough and female and adequate as hell.}
<A>__{he swings around to face frank.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{okay, then; it must've been you.}
<A>__{frank stares back defiantly. rage bubbling.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{john, please, you're being very }
<A>__{john holds up his hand.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what happened, frank? you get cold feet, or what? you decide you're better off here after all? you figure it's more comfy here in the old hopeless emptiness after all, or }
<A>__{frank's face.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{wow, that did it! look at his face! what's the matter, wheeler? am i getting warm?}
<A>__{frank stares at john, his rage increasing. mr. givings gets to his feet.}
<C>__{mr. givings }
<D>__{all right, son. i think we'd better be }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{boy!}
<A>__{he lets out his braying laugh. april starts to laugh.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{boy! you know something? i wouldn't be surprised if you knocked her up on purpose just so you could spend the rest of your life hiding behind that maternity dress. that way you never have to find out what he's made of.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{now look, i think that's just about enough out of you. i mean, who the hell do you think you are? you come in here and say whatever crazy god damn thing comes into your head and i think it's about time someone told you to keep your god damn }
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{he's not well, frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{not well, my ass! i don't give a damn if he's sick or well or dead or alive, he should keep his fucking opinions in the fucking insane asylum where they belong!}
<A>__{april stares at frank.}
<C>__{mr. givings}
<D>__{let's go, son.}
<A>__{mr. givings moves john towards the door. mrs. givings slowly stands. april is the only one left seated.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{big man you got there, april.}
<A>__{he winks at april and puts his hat on.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{big family man, solid citizen. i feel sorry for you. still, maybe you deserve each other.}
<A>__{april's face.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{matter of fact, the way you look right now, i'm beginning to feel sorry for him, too. i mean, you must give him a pretty bad time, if making babies is the only way he can prove he's got a pair of balls.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you... fucking..!}
<A>__{frank lunges at john. mr. givings tries to hold frank back. mrs. givings leaps between them. she's crying.}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{he's not well, frank!}
<A>__{silence. mr. givings slowly releases frank. he is breathing heavily.}
<C>__{mr. givings}
<D>__{all right, john. let's get on out to the car now.}
<A>__{he guides him from the room.}
<C>__{mrs. givings}
<D>__{i'm sorry april, i'm so sorry...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{right... sorry, sorry, sorry! okay ma? have i said `sorry' enough times? i am sorry, too. damn; i bet i'm just about the sorriest bastard i know. course, get right down to it, i don't have a whole hell of a lot to be glad about, do i?}
<A>__{he takes another step towards the door, then stops and turns back, laughing again.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{hey, but i'm glad about one thing, though.}
<A>__{he points a yellow stained finger at april's stomach.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{you know what i'm glad about? i'm glad i'm not gonna be that kid.}
<A>__{they go out. frank goes to the liquor cabinet, pours a whiskey and drinks it. april watches him from across the room.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{okay, okay, don't tell me. don't tell me; let me guess. i made a disgusting spectacle of myself. right?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{he turns to april.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{and everything that man said is true. right? isn't that what you're going to say?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{apparently i don't have to. you're saying it for me.}
<A>__{he comes towards her.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{but you're wrong.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{why am i wrong?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{because the man is insane. he's fucking insane! do you know what the definition of insanity is?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{what is it, frank?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{the inability to relate to another human being. it's the inability to love.}
<A>__{she looks at him. then she begins to laugh.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{the in the in; the inabil; the inability to }
<A>__{she reels around the room, her laughter increasingly out of control.}
<C>__{april }
<D>__{oh. oh, frank, you really are a wonderful talker! if black could be made into white by talking, you'd be the man for the job. so now i'm crazy because i don't love you right? is that the point?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no. wrong. you're not crazy and you do love me; that's the pointerior}
<A>__{he takes a step towards her. all the laughter goes out of her face. she backs away.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{but i don't. in fact i loathe the sight of you. you're just a boy who made me laugh at a party once and if you come any closer, if you touch me or anything i think i will scream.}
<A>__{he takes her by the arms.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{oh baby listen }
<A>__{she screams. high and shrill. her eyes wide open, cold and perfectly calm.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{fuck you, april. and fuck all your hateful, snotty little }
<A>__{she slips past him. he goes after her. she pulls a chair into his path. he slings it against the wall.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{what're you going to do now? are you going to hit me? to show how much you love me?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{oh, no, don't worry, i can't be bothered! you're not worth the trouble it'd take to hit you. you're not worth the powder it'd take to blow you up. you're an empty }
<A>__{he begins to shake with anger.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{you're an empty, hollow fucking shell of a woman. what the hell are you living in my house for if you hate me so much? huh? will you answer me that? why the hell do you fuck me? what the hell are you carrying my child for?}
<A>__{he points at her belly.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{why the hell didn't you just get rid of it, when you had the chance? because listen. listen: i got news for you. i wish to god you had.}
<A>__{he strides out of the room.}
