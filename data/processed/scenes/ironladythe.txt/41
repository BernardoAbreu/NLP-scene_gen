<B>__{night.}
<A>__{margaret now on all fours, struggling with her glasses. a pile of dvd's on the floor, the king and i amongst them momentarily catching her eye until a dvd with hand written scrawl that we can't quite read. margaret flicks open the box, struggling to get the dvd out. fiddling with the dvd player, margaret puts in the disc and considers, squinting at the remote, trying to make the dvd player work until, suddenly... super 8 footage 1959 children on a beach in wind swept, grainy super 8. denis with a golf club and ping pong balls practicing his drive from a tee, sending ball after ball skying into the sea. mark and carol charge into the water to retrieve them.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{there they are, my little twins. mark...}
<A>__{denis approaches the camera laughing and appears to take hold of it. margaret is seen sitting on a wobbly camping stool, hardly dressed for the beach, surrounded by papers weighed held down by pebbles. she merrily returns to her work.}
<C>__{denis}
<D>__{cornwall, wasn't it? bloody hell... look at `em, little imps. you never really got golf, did you?}
<A>__{denis sits behind her on the sofa in a dressing gown, watching the footage. she sips her whisky.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{you look happy.}
<C>__{denis}
<D>__{yes, i do, don't i? you're drinking too much.}
<A>__{margaret ignores him.}
<C>__{denis }
<D>__{whatcha doing?}
<A>__{denis looks at margaret, unwavering. she resumes a search }
<C>__{denis }
<D>__{not like you. looking back.}
<A>__{margaret suddenly presses rewind on the remote, clutched in her hand.}
<C>__{denis }
<D>__{don't want to dig around too deep, m. don't know what you might find.}
<A>__{the rapid rewind of denis swinging his golf club.}
<C>__{denis }
<D>__{you can rewind it, but you can't change it.}
<A>__{she freezes the image of him turning to camera, laughing.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{they grow up so fast.}
<A>__{margaret turns with something to say, but denis doesn't seem to be there anymore.}
