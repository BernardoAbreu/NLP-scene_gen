<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{int apostolic palace day}
<A>__{the camerlengo walks briskly through the hallways of the apostolic palace, deep in thought. he reaches the top of the royal staircase, and can hear the rumbling of activity in the sistine chapel below. looking down the stairs, he sees the doorway open, and the gathering of cardinals inside. as he reaches the base of the stairs, cardinal mortati, who has been summoned, steps outside to meet him, flanked by his aide, father simeon. vincenzo, leading them, turns up via sentinel and starts up the hill toward the archives. they follow, quickly. they speak in english, their common language.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{you've been informed of the new situation?}
<C>__{mortati}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{may god's mercy be upon us.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{and the other cardinals?}
<C>__{mortati}
<D>__{await your word.}
<A>__{the camerlengo thinks, feels the weight of this decision on his young shoulders.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{may i ask your guidance, padre?}
<C>__{mortati}
<D>__{my belief is we should proceed with the sealing of conclave.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{at this hour? that would be highly unorthodox.}
<C>__{mortati}
<D>__{and yet within church law. it's in my power, i've been chosen great elector.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{the cruelest honor in christendom.}
<C>__{mortati}
<D>__{the only ambitions i have are for my church. st. peter's church, which is under attack at its most vulnerable moment. this is not a coincidence. is it possible our enemies hope to distract us from our sacred task?}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{the church will not fall in a day. we may be wise to consider evacuation.}
<C>__{mortati}
<D>__{that is exactly what they want, publicity and panic. we must not give them oxygen for the media fire.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{what of the safety of the cardinals?}
<C>__{mortati}
<D>__{surely there is not an elector present who values his physical being more than the unbroken leadership of the holy see.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{and the people in st. peter's square?}
<C>__{mortati}
<D>__{they care as deeply about their church as we do. their faith will sustain them.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{but if their faith does not protect them from an explosion?}
<C>__{mortati}
<D>__{we're all bound for heaven eventually, are we not?}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{spoken like one who has enjoyed the blessings of a long and full life.}
<A>__{mortati bristles at the thinly veiled insult.}
<C>__{mortati}
<D>__{signore, do not confuse the power of the office you temporarily hold with your true place here in the vatican. you were a favorite of his holiness, but his holiness is with his father now.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{mea culpa.}
<A>__{satisfied, mortati looks back over his shoulder, at the anxious faces in the chapel. then turns back to the camerlengo.}
<C>__{mortati}
<D>__{seal the doors.}
<A>__{with a heavy thud, the huge doors close and bolts slam into place. an ancient key grinds in an ornate lock, two heavy chains rattle into place, four swiss guard take position in front of the doors and at that very moment }
