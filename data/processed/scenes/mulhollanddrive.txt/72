<A>__{mr. roque, in his wheelchair is still in the center of the huge softly lit, windowless office. his manservant standing silently behind him. the small built in wheelchair phone rings. mr. roque pushes a button on a small intricate remote device he holds in his right hand. a slender streamlined microphone rises from the arm of the chair.}
<C>__{mr. roque}
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{he listens through a high tech earplant which we now see.}
<C>__{mr. roque }
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{he pushes two buttons, one after another on the remote device. we hear a small click, a dial tone, a number being dialed, and a phone ringing.}
