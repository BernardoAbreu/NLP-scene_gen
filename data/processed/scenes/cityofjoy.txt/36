<L>__{interior hotel room day}
<A>__{the room is utterly utilitarian. the porter turns on a ceiling fan, sending an army of cockroaches scurrying for calmer terrain. max clearly doesn't care for cockroaches.}
<C>__{porter}
<D>__{it pleases you?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{no fruit basket? no mini bar?}
<A>__{max hands the porter several rupees.}
<C>__{porter}
<D>__{bar? of course many, many. but make care, sahib. please, for me. if it is lady you like to know yes? you let me. huh? very sweet girl, good nature, very sweet. or boy, very good...}
<A>__{max puts a finger on the porter's head, turns him for the door.}
<C>__{porter}
<D>__{no like boy? something then for smoke mmmh, very good for smoke!}
<B>__{at door}
<A>__{max eases the porter out. as the door is closing...}
<C>__{porter}
<D>__{maybe you like two girls look a little chinese, but very great pleasure.}
<A>__{max smiles his smile and disappears the porter behind the closed door. the smile disappears and the fan gets his attention; it has an annoying rhythm and sound. he flicks the switch, but the fan continues to snap around. he stares at it... and startles us by suddenly flicking out a hand and grabbing the blade, stopping the fan. he lets go. the fan is still. he carries his knapsack to the tub; it has brown stains along the middle and the water has a brown tinge as it flows out of the tap. he sits on the edge of the tub, dumps his knapsack on the floor, picks up a half dozen pamphlets from the ashram.}
<B>__{close on pamphlets}
<A>__{guides to inner peace.}
<B>__{resume}
<A>__{he wings the pamphlets at the trashcan.}
