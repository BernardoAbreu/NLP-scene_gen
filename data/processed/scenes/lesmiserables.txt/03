<L>__{exterior toulon dock day}
<A>__{storm lashed sea and driving rain. a great wave rises up and hammers down. as it recedes we see the figures of men heaving on great ropes, the sea water streaming down over their faces. the harsh storm light catches glints of metal: these men are convicts, chained by manacles, heads shaved, wearing red shirts with prison numbers crudely stitched onto them. now we see that the ropes run up to a ship that is being hauled ashore a storm damaged man of war, its masts broken, rising and falling on the surge. as yet another great wave rolls over the convicts, we follow the straining ropes down into the base of the slipway, and find the convict jean valjean, up to his waist in water, chained by two sets of manacles, as the rain and spray and wind scream round him. a great brute of a man, he seems to feel nothing. the convicts sing in time with the rhythmic pulls on the rope }

<D>__{look down, look down there's twenty years to go.}
<A>__{the camera rises up to find javert, the officer in charge of the convict workforce, looking on, his face rain lashed and expressionless. he stands above the men on the top of the dock, as lines of convicts labour beneath him on the steep steps of the dock wall. behind javert, through the storm rain we glimpse a forest of half built ships, their ribbed frames like great skeletons in the mist. foreground convicts are at work on another ship that is almost completed, labouring in the crashing spray.}

<D>__{look down, look down you'll always be a slave. look down, look down you're standing in your grave.}
<A>__{with a last great heave the lines of convicts haul the damaged ship onto the slipway. crack! the stern flagpole of the ship snaps in a vicious gust of wind and crashes down into the shallow water near valjean. javert sees and points his stick at valjean in silent command. valjean stares back for a beat, defying him. then he drops down into the seething water and re emerges with the great mast in his hands, held over his head. his head breaks water with his bitter gaze still on javert, as he throws the mast ashore in a deliberate display of strength. javert nods to the guards, and they begin to form the chained men into lines to return to their prison. the storm is passing now, blown by the driving wind. javert approaches jean valjean.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{now prisoner 24601. your time is up and your parole's begun. you know what that means?}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{yes. it means i'm free.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{no! it means you get your yellow ticket of leave.}
<A>__{he hands valjean a folded yellow paper.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{this badge of shame you'll show it everywhere. it warns you're a dangerous man.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{i stole a loaf of bread my sister's child was close to death and we were starving.}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{you will starve again unless you learn the meaning of the law.}
<C>__{valjean}
<D>__{i know the meaning of those nineteen years a slave of the law!}
<C>__{javert}

<D>__{my name is jean valjean!}
<C>__{javert}
<D>__{and i'm javert! do not forget my name. do not forget me 24601!}
<A>__{he strides away to command the lines of convicts as they're marched away. valjean walks away, hardly able to take in that he is free at last. the convicts sing as he goes.}

<D>__{look down, look down you'll always be a slave. look down, look down you're standing in your grave.}
