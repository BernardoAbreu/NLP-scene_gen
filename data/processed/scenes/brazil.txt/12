<L>__{interior buttle sitting room night}
<A>__{crash! it's a raid! battle dressed security troops smash trough the door. another one, swings from a rope, kicks in the window from the outside and enters that way. most alarmingly of all, a shower of plaster comes down from the ceiling in which a fairly neat round hole appears and through the hole comes a fireman's pole down which slide two more security troops. the whole thing is short, brutal and violent. buttle is grabbed violently and stuffed into a baglike canvas device that covers him from head to waist. a metal clamp goes round his neck, a metal bar slides up the back of the bag. his hands are handcuffed to the metal bar. in seconds he has become a canvas parcel. meanwhile, girl buttle has been carried out of her bedroom and dumped into the lap of her screaming mother. boy buttle has his toy machine gun knocked out of his hands by a trooper who we see is identical in dress to the action men boy buttle has been playing with. he rushes to his mother as guns are viciously trained on them. troops are kicking open the doors of other rooms and generally doing a good job. an official, wearing plain clothes, now enters from the front door and during the turmoil is reading aloud from an official document. it goes something like this:}

<A>__{... and more of the same, most of which is part of the audible wall paper while the chaos reigns. as the front door slams behind the captive relative peace returns, broken by mrs buttle's anguished sobbing.}
