<L>__{exterior suburban home backyard moments later}
<A>__{in the backyard is a swimming pool. nicole and tj stand looking in the pool. it's a nice pool with a diving board. hesher walks up behind them and pushes them in. nicole comes up for air.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{what the fuck!?}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{what? you're dirty.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{yeah, and now i'm wet.}
<A>__{hesher smiles wide.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{you're dirty and wet. i'm coming in...}
<A>__{he throws his t shirt off and does a huge bomb into the pool.}
<C>__{hesher }
<D>__{now i'm dirty and wet too.}
<A>__{he splashes water at her. he dives under the water. suddenly tj is pulled under. nicole can't see them under all the motion. then tj and hesher come bursting up for air.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{cut it out.}
<C>__{hesher}
<D>__{r2! shut down all the fucken' trash compactors on the detention level!}
<A>__{hesher dives under the water again. nicole squirms. hesher has her leg. he doesn't drag her under. he just tugs her leg. she slaps at the water. he tugs her leg again. pretty soon she's laughing. hesher's head appears above water momentarily.}
<C>__{hesher }
<D>__{...all the fucking trash compactors...}
<P>__{(underwater, then up again)}
<D>__{...on the detention level!...}
<A>__{he dives again. he pulls her leg. she laughs hard. tj watches feeling a little left out. hesher jumps up and climbs out of the pool. he goes to a garden table nearby.}
<C>__{hesher }
<D>__{oh, shit. more trash coming in!}
<A>__{he heaves the table over and into the pool. he grabs a banana lounge.}
<C>__{hesher }
<D>__{oh shit!}
<A>__{he throws it in the pool. nicole and tj have to dive out of the way. they go to the sides of the pool and climb out laughing, while hesher continues heaving garden furniture, a barbecue and anything else in reach into the water. tj and nicole sit on the edge of the pool with their legs dangling in the water. they're fully clothed and soaking wet. he walks off, around the side of the house, looking for more things to break. there is an awkward silent moment between tj and nicole. tj looks down and notices a small army of ants marching along the side of the pool. he manages to get one to crawl onto the his finger.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{so, how do you know this guy?}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{i don't know, he's sort of moved into my grandma's house with us.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{what, like he's renting a room or something?}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{no, not really, i don't know, it's kinda a long story.}
<A>__{tj flicks the ant off of his finger, then another one that's climbing up his arm.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{do you realize that the equivalent to you flicking that ant would be like one of us getting hit in the face by a giant wrecking ball at 100 miles an hour and getting thrown into the next yard?}
<A>__{tj stops mid ant flicking.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{sorry, i...}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{do you think the other ants are gonna wonder where that ant's gone? do you think their gonna miss her?}
<A>__{tj doesn't know how to answer. hesher reappears with a container of lighter fluid and goes to the diving board. he climbs on and squirts the lighter fluid through his lighter, sending streams of flames into the pool. hesher douses the diving board with lighter fluid and ignites it with his lighter. the diving board erupts into flames.}
<C>__{nicole }
<D>__{jesus christ.}
<C>__{hesher}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{jump in the fi re.}
<A>__{hesher takes a few steps back then runs toward the board. he springs through the flames into the air. he does a messy sideways flip.}
<C>__{hesher }
<D>__{fuck you bitches!!!}
<A>__{he lands in the pool splashing tj and nicole. he pulls himself out and shakes his hair around like a wet dog. he looks over at the flaming diving board.}
<C>__{hesher }
<D>__{shit, look at that.}
<A>__{hesher grabs his shirt on his way toward the fence. he doesn't look back.}
<C>__{hesher }
<D>__{i got a doctor's appointment.}
<C>__{tj}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{hesher hops over the fence.}
<C>__{hesher }
<P>__{(yells)}
<D>__{it burns when i urinate...}
<A>__{hesher disappears over the fence. we hear his van start and peel away. the flaming diving board pours black toxic smoke into the sky as it crumbles into the pool.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{did he just leave us? i think we should get out of here.}
<A>__{nicole stands and heads for the gate, tj tags behind. they jump the side fence and head out into the street, dripping wet.}
