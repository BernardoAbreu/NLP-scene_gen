<A>__{they're sitting at the dining table, having coffee. marian is listening sympathetically to marika's tale of woe.}
<C>__{marika}
<D>__{and there was this number on my phone bill that i didn't recognize. calls made at three and four in the morning. so, i called the number ... and a woman answered. and i ... i hung up.}
<P>__{(leans forward)}
<D>__{so, then i followed him. just like in the movies. and i found out that he has a wife and a little girl living in brooklyn. we had been going together for almost a year.}
<C>__{marian}
<P>__{(shaking her head in disgust)}
<D>__{men ... they're all the same.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{our pastor in sioux falls was caught with his wife's sister.}
<C>__{marika}
<P>__{(brightening)}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{oh, it was such a big scandal.}
<C>__{marika}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{poor man had to leave town.}
<P>__{(marika laughs)}
<D>__{and i hear that other women came forward.}
<A>__{this makes marika laugh even harder. marian's story seems to have assuaged her own grief in some parallel way.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{you know, you ought to come out to south dakota some time and meet my son, steve. he's single.}
<C>__{marika}
<D>__{what does he do?}

<D>__{oh. well, that would be a ... change.}
<P>__{(smiles warmly)}
<D>__{thank you, mrs. peterson. you have a very reassuring voice.}
<A>__{the disciple's motorcycles growl off screen, interrupting their tete a tete. marian and marika both rise simultaneously from the table and amble over to the window together.}
<C>__{marika}
<D>__{i wish they wouldn't come and go in packs, then they wouldn't be so loud.}
<A>__{they reach the window.}
