<A>__{epps enters the dim passageway from the bright daylight. she moves down the passage, coming finally to the stateroom where greer was found, room 400. she holds there a beat, then reaches for the door, hesitating. she opens it.}
<L>__{interior chimera stateroom continuous day}
<A>__{the door comes open and epps steps in. it is dark, though spacious. it is divided into two rooms. beyond the sitting room in the front, is a bedroom. epps steps in. a dressing table sits against the far wall. a large bed is unmade. suitcases lie open on stands at the foot of the bed, still half full as if they were in the process of being unpacked. from one, she pulls back a woman's gown, a blouse. the other contains shirts, trousers, socks, and underwear. across the room a smaller suitcase can be seen lying open on an ottoman in the corner. epps crosses to it. she finds a few shirts, and a red print dress, some books. she takes one of the books, opening it. inscribed on the inside of the cover is: "this book belongs to:" and then written in by hand: "katie nichols." a page is marked with a purple ribbon. she opens it to see a children's poem "the rooster and the crow" and a drawing of a rooster and a crow and a stanza of a poem: "'cock a doodle doo,' said the rooster to the crow. 'where are you now? i know, but won't say so.'" she puts it down. a tin penny whistle sits on the table. she picks it up, examining it. she opens a small picture book, thumbing through to see photos of a family, a young mother and father at the beach, the mother and a girl of about 9 years, the girl and an older girl of about 16, the girl she saw at the swimming pool, katie. epps holds on this picture, when a music box sounds. she looks up to the dressing table. on it a music box slowly plays "daisy."}
<B>__{at the table}
<A>__{epps crosses to it, looking on at the music box as it slowly winds down, then finally stops. a beat. she picks it up, looking at it, when she looks up to see greer standing there. a beat. the dirty white light falling into the room through the windows falls on him as he looks off at something we cannot see. his expression is empty, hollow.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{greer?}
<A>__{he does not hear her as he stands there. she approaches, stepping up.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{another beat, as he looks off, into the light, when he slowly turns to see her. a long beat as she looks back. he holds there, the same empty look about him, when he grabs her by the throat and squeezes hard. she is stunned, breathless, but raises her hands to grip his wrists, fighting him.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{greer!}
<A>__{his grip tightens. he is much stronger and her efforts make little difference.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{let go!}
<A>__{she hangs on, starting to choke. she drops one hand, searching with it.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{oragishlaoomnudrasadrafantoshviska getofedobrodijotosiantosg.}
<A>__{he speaks nonsense, his face distorted in an ugly grimace, eyes bulging as epps fumbles over the table, a tray of glass and silver crashing to the floor as he pushes her back, still choking her. he backs her to the wall, pushing in, closing her windpipe the rest of the way. her hand searches behind her, knocking over a small vase, a basket, some books. it comes to a brass desk lamp. it falls, a little out of reach. she is going to black out any second, as greer strangles her. her hand comes to the desk lamp, grabbing it. she raises the lamp, swinging with all her might, connecting with greer's head. he stumbles back, a gash laid into his face, as epps sucks in air, gagging and coughing, her neck purple with finger marks. she fumbles her radio up.}
<C>__{epps}
<P>__{(into radio)}
<D>__{murphy! i'm on c deck, cabin 400! get down here now!!}
<A>__{blood is running down his face as greer comes for her again. she throws down the radio. a bed stands between them. she feints right, then left. he's dazed and has blood in his eyes. she manages to slip by, but he dives, taking her down. he drags her back along the floor, spinning her around. he raises a fist to ram into her face when wham! epps has shoved the butt of her flashlight into his crotch and he comes up screaming. he grabs her face, striking her with his other hand. she swings the flashlight again and cracks him across the head. he swings yet again and connects, knocking her across the floor. she lies in a heap as greer climbs to his feet, enraged and bleeding. he unbuckles his belt as he approaches, pulling it from his waist to do god knows what. epps looks around to see him approaching. and we see that she has unhinged her gill knife. as his foot steps near, she lets go and drives the knife with all her might into his boot, plunging the blade through his foot and into the floor. he screams. after a moment he stops, looks to her. he is a bloody, wretched, enraged mess. he starts toward her as murphy appears in the doorway. just as greer is upon her, murphy blind sides greer from behind at full speed, knocking him down. greer and murphy struggle as epps climbs unsteadily to her feet. she staggers to them and raises the flashlight over greer, bringing it down on his head.}
