<L>__{77 terminator, the shot gun held in his teeth, astride the roaring}
<A>__{harley twenty feet away. terminator twists the throttle and pops the clutch. the back tire screams on the concrete. the front wheel lifts off the ground and the heavy bike launches in a thundering wheelie. terminator gets off just before the bike hurtles into the elevator. the harley slams the t 1000 square and smashes it right through the back wall of the elevator. terminator rolls to his feet. johns strikes the flare on the concrete. tosses it. terminator catches the life flare with one hand. levels the shotgun with the other. with his last round he blows a big hole in the bike's gas tank. gas splashes everywhere, covering the struggling t 1000. terminator tosses the flare. ka vooom! the explosion knocks terminator backward off his feet, enveloping him in the fireball. he gets up, smoking, and runs after john and sarah toward the exit ramp.}
