<A>__{changed in seven years, softer. his shaggy hair is manicured in a sleeker, longer length and he wears a smartly short, perfectly trimmed beard. we glimpse, on storm's chart, the identifying label: "john doe 461z." angle beds of other patients trapped between sleep and death. a spectral, haunting scene, full of pathos. beside storm's bed andy works, full of beauty and youth like a beacon of life and hope in this silent still world. she runs a physical therapy regimen on storm and seems quite expert at this delicate work. the "workouts" are electronically induced by sophisticated impulse equipment.}

<D>__{besides ... you've got so much to live for.}
<A>__{as andy replaces the sheet, her wristwatch alarm beeps a reminder. checking the watch, she leans over and smooths storm's sheet, touching him tenderly.}
