<A>__{as eric shoves the door open from the outside. the lock, popped from the frame, spins on the wooden floor. the barrier tape whisps and dust roils. dark, chilly, damp. a rat's nest of disuse.}

<A>__{as eric enters. glass blown out. shards poking. jagged. new angle as eric walks in he scans the loft. sees reflecting golden eyes near the floor. eric's pov floor near window a white, long haired cat walks into a pool of night light. angle eric and the cat he kneels. extends his hand. the cat nears; likes eric. close up eric's hand. as the cat makes contact. sudden white jolt a flash. flash: we hear eric strumming his strat o.s. we see what he saw: shelly, holding the cat.}
