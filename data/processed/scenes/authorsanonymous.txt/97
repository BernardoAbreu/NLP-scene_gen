<L>__{interior piper office day}
<A>__{lois plops down behind her desk. stacks of manuscripts cover her desk. dr. xiroman sits quietly in one chair. colette sits next to him.}

<P>__{(sighing; distraught)}
<D>__{look at my desk, dr. xiroman. look at all this. do you know what it is? crap. it's all crap. crap. crap. crap. i hate my job. i hate my life.}
<A>__{dr. xiroman nods: i understand.}

<D>__{know what i feel like doing?}
<A>__{she looks at the camera.}
<C>__{lois }
<D>__{come in closer. i want you to get this. closer. c'mon. more. closer.}
<A>__{satisfied, lois takes her free hand and shoves all the manuscripts off her desk, sending them flying on the floor.}
<C>__{lois }
<D>__{wheeeeee!}
<A>__{colette looks aghast. lois seems free at last.}
<C>__{lois }
<D>__{that was so...liberating. i haven't felt this good since that night in paris with salman rushdie.}
<A>__{lois growls like a tiger at the memory.}
<C>__{lois }
<D>__{i envy you, dr. xiroman. know that? look at your life. your work. you helped my sister. you've helped so many people. you have such a positive message to share.}
<A>__{the camera picks up on lois as the light goes on, the wheels start turning in her head.}
<C>__{lois }
<D>__{wait a minute. wait a minute. wait a minute. a positive message to share. helping people. that's it!}
<C>__{colette}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{lois}
<D>__{of course. dr. xiroman, you should write a book. this could be a whole series.}
<C>__{colette}
<D>__{but }
<C>__{lois}
<D>__{ it's perfect! television. your own blog. personal appearances.}
<C>__{colette}
<D>__{but }
<A>__{dr. xiroman has no reaction. colette can't believe what she is hearing.}
<C>__{lois}
<D>__{getting from xiro to one by doctor xiroman. oh, i like that.}
<C>__{colette}
<D>__{but }
<C>__{lois}
<D>__{ in fact, as long as you're here today, why don't we just get you under contract? i know just who to call in new york.}
<C>__{colette}
<D>__{but but. what about me?}
<A>__{lois shoots her a look: what about you? colette backs down not wanting to spoil the moment. lois yells for her assistant. finally a slight smile crosses dr. xiroman's face.}
