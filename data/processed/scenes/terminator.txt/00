<A>__{silence. gradually the sound of distant traffic becomes audible. a low angle bounded on one side by a chain link fence and on the other by the one story public school build ings. spray can hieroglyphics and distant streetlight sha dows. this is a los angeles public school in a blue collar neighborhood. angle between school buildings, where a trash dumpster looms in a low angle, part of the clutter behind the gymnasium. a cat enters frame. camera dollies forward, prowling with him through the landscape of trash receptacles and shadows. close on cat, which freezes, alert, sensing something just beyond human perception. a sourceless wind rises, and with it a keening whine. papers blow across the pavement. the cat yowls and hides under the dumpster. windows rattle in their frames. the whine intensifies, accompanied now by a wash of frigid purple light. a concussion like a thunderclap right over head blows in all the windows facing the yard. c.u. cat, its eyes are wide as the glare dies.}
