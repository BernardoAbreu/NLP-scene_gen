<A>__{the first rays of sunlight streak the sky from beyond the horizon, promising a hot and sunny summer's day. the birds are up, foraging for food. as the camera scans the peaceful scene, we see the sky reflected in the calm waters of crystal lake. the canoe holding alice is drifting in big slow circles across the surface of the lake.}

<A>__{alice lies, in mcu, in the canoe, sleeping. she has not changed her position since collapsing a few hours before. the water laps gently against the side of the canoe. very slowly, she wakes. she opens her eyes. the canoe has drifted into the shade of some enormous tree boughs that overhang the edge of the lake. they shade alice from the bright rays of the sun. the canoe rocks gently. alice is still, listening to the sound of the lapping water. suddenly there is a blood curdling scream, a musical stinger, and the screen is filled with the flying, whirling form of mrs. voorhees, who leaps from the overhanging boughs into the canoe, barely missing alice's slumped form! the canoe immediately overturns and both mrs. voorhees and alice try to find their footing in the shallow water. mrs. voorhees is covered in mud and blood. she sees alice struggling to get up and move toward her, brandishing her blood spattered machete. alice turns, sees mrs. voorhees coming. alice grabs a paddle floating near her. mrs. voorhees pushes the canoe to one side, wading through the waist high water as fast as she can. she screams with rage. her face goes through a horrifying transformation. from her mouth comes the voice of jason.}

<A>__{alice can't move fast enough to get away from mrs. voorhees, who is slashing the air with her big knife trying to hit alice. alice slips, falls in the water, gets her footing back and has to turn and block the blow of the machete with the paddle, using it like a staff to ward off the blow. the machete cuts the paddle nearly in half. mrs. voorhees raises the knife for another blow and alice lunges for her knees and succeeds in throwing mrs. voorhees into the water. the machete flies out of her hand and lands in the water. the two women roll in the water. mrs. voorhees is trying to strangle alice, her hands stretching to reach around her throat. they roll over and under the water. we cannot see who is winning. suddenly mrs. voorhees finds her footing and stands up, looking for alice. she is screeching madly.}

<A>__{alice shoots up out of the water holding the machete, and in one, wild swing, decapitates mrs. voorhees, whose head flies off into the water. the body stands for a minute, then falls heavily into the lake. alice drops the machete into the water and starts to wade to shore.}
