<D>__{you alright?}
<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{yeah. i'm thinking about michael's franco harris fixation. you know how michael was always harping "immaculate reception?" i've seen that play. a lot of times... and i have to say this... franco was lucky. flat out, right place, right time. that's it. he was where the ball bounced. you get me?}
<C>__{moore}
<D>__{i guess.}
<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{i'm saying it's luck. all luck. you work your entire life, all the training, focus, all the dedication, all irrelevant. where does the ball bounce? my father spent his whole life trying to start a company, practiced every day, worked like a dog, finally got enough money. he's paid the dues, he's ready, does all the market research, picks his shot "pup corn."}
<C>__{moore}
<D>__{pup corn?}
<C>__{fisher}
<D>__{that's right, "pup corn." doggie treats. little snacks for dogs. he's figured it out. there is a hole in the market and he's going to fill it. spends all out money, works himself into not two but three heart attacks getting this shit up. after fifteen months, the big day arrives, the first box of "pup corn" pops off the belt. he comes running home with that box, pulls us out of school. we all pile into the living room, must be fifty of us, and in comes "shelmer," our 8 year old mutt. "here shelmer," my dad cries. he's got that little fucking pup corn in his hand, "here girl." this dog will eat anything, she eats rocks, anything. she walk's up to my dad's hand, looks down at the little pellet, licks it once, turns around, walks out of the room. shelmer rejected the "pup corn." fifteen months of my dad's life, right there. not one dog ate pup corn. not one. three months later, "pup corn" shuts down. chapter eleven. my father never got over it. never.}
