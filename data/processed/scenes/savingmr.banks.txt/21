<L>__{exterior goff house allora day}
<A>__{ arid heat, dazzling sunlight. travers, margaret and the children climb stand in a line at the top of a pathway. from their perspective all there is to see is a cloud of swirling red dust; it obscures and then gradually reveals her new home. the surrounding land yellow and burnt unlike the lush greens of maryborough. the house is ramshackle and meagre. a swayback white nag wanders near a solitary tree and a few skinny chickens strut about the porch.}

<D>__{oh }
<A>__{travers puts an arm around her shoulder.}
<C>__{travers}
<D>__{we'll build beautiful memories here my angel.}
<A>__{margaret offers him a trusting smile.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{travers takes ginty and biddy's hands and they run towards their new home. the chickens scatter.}

<P>__{(in the distance)}
<D>__{ in this house you get to share a bedroom!}
<A>__{margaret looks at the surrounding area, there's simply nothing but barren land and red dust for miles.}
