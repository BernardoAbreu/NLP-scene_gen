<L>__{exterior mall day}
<A>__{heavy metal music. a group of anarchist skaters rages through the mall parking lot tearing up everything they see. a couple of them smoke cigarettes. one skater grinds over a bench. one kid ollies onto the hood of a car. another slams into an old man and knocks him over. meanwhile, ronnie sits in his golf cart waiting. he looks eerily like mel gibson at the beginning of mad max. the skaters ride past a set of construction cones. one skater picks up the cone and tosses it across the parking lot. the skaters soar past ronnie, who flips on the silent orange siren and gives chase. as the skaters ride through the parking lot, ronnie pulls up and drives alongside of them.}

<P>__{(cop authority voice)}
<D>__{pull over to the sidewalk, now!}
<A>__{stevie, the leader of the skaters, yells back.}
<C>__{stevie}
<D>__{fuck off, ronnie, it's just a parking lot.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{sir, pull over to the sidewalk, now!}
<A>__{hector, another skater, joins in.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{leave us alone.}
<C>__{stevie}
<D>__{yeah, skating's not a crime, dick.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{skateboarding is not allowed on mall premises. pull over now!}
<C>__{stevie}
<D>__{we're not leaving.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{yeah, fuck you!}
<A>__{the skateboarders flip ronnie off and push hard to get away from him. ronnie guns it and an all out chase ensues. ronnie pulls up alongside of a slow skater. ronnie side swipes the skater, forcing the skater to run into a trash can and fall. ronnie catches up to another skater. this time, ronnie tries to hit the skater on the side again, but he is too fast. ronnie swerves trying to get him, but he dodges and ducks. ronnie hits the brake. the skater thinks he has escaped, but looks up and sees that a car is in his way. the skater nails the car and is thrown over the hood. ronnie is back in the chase and only hector and stevie are left. ronnie guns the golf cart and zooms up closely behind the two kids. ronnie rams hector over and over from behind. hector wobbles. ronnie rams him again. hector goes swerving off and falls down hard. ronnie doesn't break his pace and guns it toward stevie. stevie is good. he turns and rides through cars, ollies over parking blocks, and through pedestrians. ronnie burns down the lane beside him. stevie looks behind and ronnie is nowhere in sight. he's in the clear. stevie turns back around and sees ronnie, driving in reverse straight towards him. ronnie rams into the skater and knocks the poor kid on his ass.}
<C>__{stevie}
<D>__{what the fuck are you doing?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i was driving in reverse and trying to get you to flip into the back seat.}
<C>__{stevie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{that way i could handcuff you smoothly and take you in. you know, never mind, just get in the goddamn golf cart.}
<A>__{stevie picks himself up slowly and hobbles toward the golf cart.}
