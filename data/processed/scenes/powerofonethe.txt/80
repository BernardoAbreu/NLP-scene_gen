<D>__{let's just start out nice and easy now.}
<A>__{he hits the bell. the fighters circle. pk's opponent starts punching, jabbing, probing. after two feints he comes after pk in earnest. pk steps left and peppers him with three quick blows to the face. solly's interest is suddenly piqued. again the fighters circle. again the opponent sets up with jabs and again he attacks. this time pk dodges, hits him hard and spins him around, hitting him twice more. a smile appears on solly's face. the opponent, angered now, gets more aggressive. pk keeps bobbing and weaving, sticking and slipping punches. the opponent unloads, banging away at pk with everything he has. pk backs up two steps, then shifts positions. the opponent's momentum carries him into the ropes. as he comes off the ropes pk throws him an eight punch combination, demolishing his opponent. pk steps back. the opponent sags. solly hits the bell, clearly excited.}
