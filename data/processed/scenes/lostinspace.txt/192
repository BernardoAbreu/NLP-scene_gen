<L>__{interior briefing room}
<A>__{the crew gathers at the table. (over) a rumbling. the ship shakes.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{what are those rumblings? they've been happening all morning.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{how can half the landscape have grown up overnight?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{okay, let's get settled. maureen?}
<A>__{maureen's monitor close. a geothermal analysis shows the giant plates that make up this world appear mismatched.}
<C>__{maureen}
<D>__{it's impossible. but this planet's geothermic plates don't match up.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i was afraid of this.}
<A>__{al1 eyes turn to john.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i think these tremors are the result of opening and closing doorways.}
<C>__{penny}
<D>__{doorways to where?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{the future.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{perhaps the professor was hit on the head when we landed.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{remember the portal that lead us to the probe ship? what if we crossed a into a time years after earth sent a rescue mission.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{you're not serious? time travel is impossible.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{no it's not. it's just improbable. like hyperdrive was a hundred years ago. nothing's really impossible.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{this world could be riddled with doorways to the future.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{so if we walk into that forest outside, we're really just walking into this crater years from now.}
<C>__{maureen}
<D>__{geological plates from different times wouldn't fit together. that would explain the tectonic mismatch. but doorways in time, john?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{if these portals are opening and closing, part of some cascading, natural phenomenon, they could be tearing this planet apart}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{these portals are exactly what i predicted my time machine would do. what if the doorways aren't natural? a machine that bends space, like our hyperdrive, could be modified to bend time as well. what if someone on this world has built a device?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{son, i appreciate your input but now isn't the time for flights of fancy.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you never listen to me. not ever.}
<A>__{and with that will storms out. john stares after him a beat, sorely wanting to follow. (over) another rumble.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{there's no telling how long before this planet breaks up entirely.}
<P>__{(rising).}
<D>__{don and i are going to locate the radioactive material for the core. get the ship ready to go. we may have very little time.}
