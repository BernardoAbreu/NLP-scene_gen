<L>__{interior minivan day}
<A>__{the van is parked. dwayne sits behind the wheel. metallica's "ride the lightning" begins to play loudly.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{you really fucked up this mix tape.}
<A>__{dwayne ejects the tape, tosses it at jay in the passenger seat.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{we're not speed freaks knocking off a 7 eleven. we're masterminding a heist here.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{sorry, dwayne. that song just means a lot to me.}
<A>__{dwayne shakes his head. he turns and looks out the windshield: they're parked in the walmart lot, watching the store entrance.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{i wish he would hurry his shit up.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{you worried about that other guy he's with?}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{no, man. he picked him up at a school. so long as there ain't any cops, he can take the whole town with him. i just want my money.}
<A>__{dwayne surveys the area. something catches his attention: the bland strip mall across the street. there's a blockbuster, subway, and an empty space in between. dwayne smiles.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{what? you want me to run over to subway, get us a couple sandwiches?}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{if you had any vision, jay, you'd know exactly what i'm thinking about right now. and it's not a sandwich.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{look how well trafficked that shopping mall is. it's the perfect place for the tanning salon.}
<A>__{jay checks it out, nods.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{oh, you're totally right.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{i've been thinking about it, and i want you to start off working the counter. sounds like a demotion, i know, but it's an important position. because we're gonna be using code words and shit. for example, if a customer walks in and says he wants a tan, that just means he wants a tan. but if he says he wants a "deluxe tan," that means a blow job and you gotta get one of the girls in there to suck him off. you with me?}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{so far. but what if he wants a fuck?}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{there's gonna be codes for everything: missionary, anal, black chicks. i got it all written down back home in my files.}
<C>__{dwayne }
<D>__{i'm not gonna bother getting into it with you right now, because you're supposed to be on lookout and you're no good at multitasking.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{okay. 'cause they're about to get away.}
<A>__{dwayne spots the mustang pulling away.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{fuck.}
<A>__{he throws the van into gear.}
