<A>__{anne marie scurries by on her way to the airstrip. suddenly, the hot springs door bursts open and lemalle lunges at her. stripped of his wet clothes, he's wrapped in blankets and furs, his feet protected by sacks lashed to them. his wet body and hair steams in the frigid air. anne marie lets out a startled cry and springs away from him. she falls hard on her back, knocking her wind out. scrambling for footing in the snow, lemalle drops his rifle. he comes at her again. anne marie moves away and pulls the .44 magnum out. lemalle stops and glares at her.}

<D>__{don't make me shoot.}
<A>__{she gets up, keeping the magnum pointed shakily toward him. lemalle glowers menacingly.}

<D>__{we're going to sam's cabin. you can stay in the jail until this is over.}
<A>__{lemalle slowly crouches down for his rifle. anne marie wields the handgun at him, but he doesn't stop.}
<C>__{lemalle}
<D>__{want to chance it with that hog leg? you can't even hold it up. better drop me first shot, bitch, or i will rip your fuckin' lungs out.}
<A>__{taunting, sneering, lemalle stares her down. anne marie is paralyzed. feeling that he's won, lemalle wraps his bony fingers around the stock of the remington. anne marie closes her eyes and fires. pulling the rifle close, lemalle tucks and rolls and jumps to his feet. anne marie fires again, and again. shot, lemalle hobbles away, leaving a trail of blood in the snow. numb, anne marie lets her arm fall.}
