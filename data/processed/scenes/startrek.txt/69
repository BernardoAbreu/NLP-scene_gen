<L>__{interior vulcan science academy council ante chamber day}
<A>__{quiet. a waiting area. amanda, spock's mother, stands alone in a passageway. she looks off camera to her son:}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{spock, come here, let me see you.}
<C>__{spock }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{spock.}
<A>__{reluctantly, spock walks into frame. she begins adjusting his collar. this is our adult spock. gripped by anxiety but trying like hell to look impassive.}
<C>__{amanda }
<D>__{there is no need to be so anxious. you'll do fine.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{i am hardly "anxious", mother.}
<P>__{(beat, then, anxiously)}
<D>__{and "fine" has variable definitions. "fine" is unacceptable.}
<A>__{she just smiles as she works his collar. he sees this and it annoys him. he tries to move her hands away, to stop with his collar his annoyance, her love for him, all sweet but he doesn't let go of her hands. a meaningful silence between them.}
<C>__{spock }
<D>__{may i ask a personal query?}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{... anything.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{should i choose to complete the vulcan discipline of kolinahr... and purge all emotion... i trust you will not feel it reflects judgement upon you.}
<A>__{she stares at him, moved. touches his face.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{as always... whoever you choose to be... you will have a proud mother.}
<A>__{hold on mother and son, worlds apart but forever bonded:}
