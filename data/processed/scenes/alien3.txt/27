<D>__{death...}
<L>__{interior ripley's cell night}
<A>__{darkness. somewhere water drips into a puddle. ripley lays on her side on the floor with her head resting near the hole in the floor. her eyes are closed.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{wherever i go.}
<A>__{a hand pushes a crust of bread through the hole. she opens her eyes to look at the food. the white haired man's head appears }
<D>__{white haired man take it.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{thanks, but no thanks, anthony.}
<A>__{she knows his name.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{you waiting for meat? they don't bring me meat because they know i'm an android. really don't need it. bread's better for you anyway. harder to digest, so it makes you feel fuller than you are.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{not hungry.}
<A>__{anthony takes a bite.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{mmmm. just a little crunchy.}
<A>__{ripley twists onto her back until she's staring up at the ceiling.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{waste of time.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{you don't eat, you'll starve to death, girl.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{that was the plan when they put me down here. and why should you care?}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{because i'm a synthetic person you don't think i can care?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{believe me, that's a discussion you don't want to have with me.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{you told me you had a bad experience and a good one with androids }
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{that's one of each. that means you could go either way. i'm tired of talking about this.}
<A>__{he pushes the bread towards her again.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{you've still gotta eat. you gotta fight the bastards }
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i'm tired of fighting. maybe i will be dead before he finds me. maybe he won't get the satisfaction.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{he? you make it sound like this alien has a personal score to settle with you. the biology you describe: queen laying eggs, larvae, drone that's very insectoid. insects usually don't bear grudges.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{and androids usually aren't the prisoners of lunatics that believe they're ancient greeks.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{medieval monks.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{whatever.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{and they've only chose to live the life style, they don't believe they're }
<P>__{(hears something)}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{ripley strains to listen. in the distance: knocking. someone is knocking on the walls. a voice calls out }
