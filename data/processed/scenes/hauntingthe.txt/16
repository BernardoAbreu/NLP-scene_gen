<L>__{exterior gas station day}
<A>__{nell is pumping gas at a country station. she is alone at the pump. as she finishes, she hears a baby crying. she looks up. she is immediately drawn by the sound. she moves to a car at another pump. the car is empty. the windows are rolled up. she peers into the car, through the window, and sees a toddler in a car seat. the child is crying. nell looks around, no one is there. she makes faces at the baby, coos to it.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{hello baby...}
<A>__{she does a peek a boo game, and the baby stops crying, the baby even starts to giggle. a voice from behind.}
<C>__{mother }
<D>__{what's going on, what happened?}
<A>__{nell turns. the mother is a busy country mom, arms filled with stuff from the gas station's market.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{she's okay. she woke up and she saw she was alone.}
<A>__{the mother has the car open and the baby is smiling now.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{say thank you, spencer.}
<P>__{(too much of an explanation)}
<D>__{i was getting her something to drink. she's been crying all day...}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{that's all right.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{of course you know, how many children do you have?}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{none.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{then you're a teacher. nursery school.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{you just... you seem like someone who takes care of children, lots of children.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{maybe... maybe someday. i'd like that.}
<A>__{the woman smiles in something like sympathy, and gets in her car. when she does, we see a friendly gas station attendant appear behind nell.}
<C>__{nell }
<D>__{umm, i'm a little lost.}
<C>__{gas station attendant}
<D>__{where you going?}
<A>__{nell takes out her computer drawn directions and an old map.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{they sent me directions and i've got a map, but it's kind of confusing. here... it's a place called hill house?}
<A>__{his helpful attitude changes dramatically.}
<C>__{gas station attendant}
<D>__{hill house.}
<A>__{he takes the map book and tears out the page and crumples it up.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{gas station attendant}
<D>__{you don't want to go there.}
<A>__{he turns abruptly and walks away.}
<C>__{nell}
<D>__{did i say something wrong to you?}
<A>__{nell slams the buick door, and breathing hard, starts the engine. she gets control, and puts the car in gear. she's shaken. badly.}
