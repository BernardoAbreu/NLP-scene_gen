<A>__{a man sits behind the wheel of a plain looking ford. stanley, the new tin man, pulls up in his car behind him, gets out and walks to the other man's car. he kneels down and talks to the driver of the car. there seems to be a serious exchange but with the sound of traffic and the cars passing through frame, we're un able to hear what is taking place. stanley nods, taps the side of the car, car drives off. stanley goes back to his car and drives off.}
