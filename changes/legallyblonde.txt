<ACTION>__{"HEAD OVER HEELS" by the Go-Go's plays as we wind through a flock of abstract, silky, golden strands — PULLING BACK, to discover that the strands are hair on a BLONDE GIRL's head. But not just any blonde girl, a girl in Delta Gamma, the blondest, most beautiful sorority at USC. We PULL BACK further to see that she's signing a handmade card. She holds it up ~ OVER HER SHOULDER, we see hearts and glitter surrounding and "Good Luck Tonight!" and "Elle and Warner forever!." She carries the card out of her room and we FOLLOW HER across the hall, into the room of — THREE BLONDE CHEERLEADERS, who stop practicing their pom-pom routine to sign the card. As they finish, we follow the Card Girl out and into the room of — A BLONDE GIRL IN A TANK TOP and shorts, working out on a Stairmaster as "General Hospital" plays on a tiny TV. She signs the card while continuing to exercise. We move on, to the room of— A BLONDE GIRL MAKING OUT WITH HER BOYFRIEND who stops long enough to sign the card, as her boyfriend nibbles on her neck. She hands the card back and we head into the room of — A BLONDE PARTY GIRL who pours a pink frozen margarita into a glass from the blender, then passes it down to ANOTHER BLONDE GIRL, assembly-line style. The card goes one way, being signed, as the drinks go the other. Once the card arrives back in the Card Girl's hands, we follow her out of the room and down the hall until she reaches the very last and biggest door — She puts a kiss mark on the card, then kneels down and slides the card under the door.}

An equally perfectly manicured hand with a "Sisters Forever" charm bracelet dangling from the wrist, scoops up Underdog. As he rises, we RISE WITH HIM, passing toned, waxed, tanned legs in pink Prada pedal pushers and a pair of perky boobs encased in a spaghetti-strap top — until we finally reveal a magnificent head of long blonde hair and a sweet, beautiful face. This is ELLE WOODS, 21, the Goddess Queen of Delta Gamma. She talks on a pink, fuzzy phone.}

<LOC>__{EXT. HARVARD LAW SCHOOL QUAD - DAY}
<ACTION>__{"Welcome Law Students Class of 2004" banners hang over orientation tables. Nervous first year students stand in line. We PAN ACROSS a row of club tables — passing "Harvard Law Journal" and "Environmental Law Association" •— until we reach a table that proudly bears the banner of "Blonde Legal Defense Club". Elle, in a red 2L t-shirt, stands behind the table, straightening some flyers. UNDERDOG is plopped down on top of the stack. Elle turns to see EMMETT next to her.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(continuing; re the crowd)}
<DIAL>__{Looks like you're pretty popular.}
<ACTION>__{Elle smiles, turning back as A NERVOUS 1L GIRL steps up.}
<CHAR>__{NERVOUS 1L GIRL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{ELLE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Only blonde at heart.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to the girl next to her)}
<DIAL>__{Right?}
<ACTION>__{Elle smiles and looks down at — the NEWLY BLONDE SARAH. Sarah returns the smile as we PULL BACK to see a CROWD of first year girls gathered around Elle's table, rushing to sign up. Ready to be as blonde as they can be.}
