<A>__{where a wide radius of steam rises from similar and regularly spaced holes in the ice sheet, defining a circular structure beneath. the white domed tents of the ice station are in the center of this, dwarfed by the enormity of the melting radius.}

<A>__{mulder pulling her up the softened and collapsed snow. the hot steam blasting up with hideous force behind them. the sound deafening.}
<B>__{new angle over mulder and scully}
<A>__{pulling her to the surface of the ice sheet where behind them in the distance the ice station can be seen through the atmosphere of condensed air. when suddenly the ice beneath it gives way and the ice station falls away, caving in to the center of the radius. which is what begins to happen to the rest of the ice sheet that spreads out to where mulder and scully are standing. causing mulder to realize:}

<D>__{we've got to run!}
<A>__{she is weak, but is able to find her footing. dragged behind mulder as the ice behind them begins to break away, falling down into an ever expanding center and sending up magnificent geysers of steam created by the superheated surface below.}
<B>__{wide on scene}
<A>__{mulder and scully running at camera just ahead of the collapsing center. the mass of ice around them beginning to break up. steam vents erupting instantaneously everywhere.}
