<L>__{ext raptor pit day}
<A>__{a big hole in the ground, covered with a think wire mesh. suddenly, a dark claw pushes against the wire web. a shower of sparks. a screech animals growl and snarl. an animal slams its face into the mesh. sparks illuminate a set of razor sharp teeth. muldoon stands next to the pit, carefully loading an assault rifle. hammond comes in a hurry. muldoon sees hammond and puts down the rifle. he walks to hammond, talking before he gets there.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{these raptors are too damn dangerous. one of them tunneled out this morning. he ripped a boy's arm off before i could get a bullet in him.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{a bullet? muldoon no! now what? i have five left?}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{john, they're mean as scorpions and smart as chimps. their little fingers make them natural cage breakers. we should terminate the raptor program. they're just too smart. too damn smart.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{oh balls. i will not terminate the raptors just because they're behaving normally. they're hunters. why can't we contain them properly?}
<A>__{hammond starts to walk away. muldoon follows, he's not finished at all.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{john, remember back in '88, when we started to build the containment devices?}
<A>__{we ordered cattle prods, tasers, guns}
<D>__{that blow out electric nets. they're all too slow for these guys. if we're going to keep the raptors, i want tow missiles and laser guided devices.}
<A>__{hammond laughs warmly. he pats muldoon on the back.}
<C>__{hammond}
<D>__{it's just a zoo, muldoon. a zoo. figure out a way to contain them. and we'll sit down and have a nice long discussion about raptors after my guests leave, okay?}
<A>__{hammond walks away. muldoon stares after him, jingling keys in his hand. muldoon lumps over to a worker.}
<C>__{muldoon}
<D>__{okay! get a 'dozer, start digging round the pit. we're gonna bury some fence. and wear your rifle when you're working!}
