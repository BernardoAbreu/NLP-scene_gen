<A>__{andy and lynne stand in the ring. she scornfully watches him preen about. zmuda is in a referee's uniform.}
<C>__{zmuda }
<D>__{will you please shake hands, go to your corners, and come out wrestling.}
<A>__{lynne extends her hand. andy fakes a shake then snidely refuses and struts away. the crowd hisses. ding! it's the bell. the match begins. lynne barrels at him, craving a victory, but terribly unprepared for this experience. andy immediately grabs her by the legs and flips her over. whump! she's down. andy has trained for this. zmuda gets on his knees, watching, trying to look official. lynne struggles and slithers away. she grabs andy's arm and forces him down. people cheer. his torso hits the mat. louder cheers. but suddenly he rolls over and pulls her hair! her head snaps back. the crowd is incensed. zmuda hurries over and pantomimes a stern warning. andy nods, and they separate. they do a little dance around the ring, lynne looking for a hole. suddenly, andy spins her into a half nelson. her arms are pinned. they struggle, then he throws her down on her stomach. one! two! three! and ding! it's over. andy jumps up and sneers at the crowd.}

<D>__{now baby, don't fight nature! get back in the kitchen where you belong!!!}
<A>__{lynne glares. out of the blue, and old recording of bouncy piano music starts playing. a chicken clucks to the music, and andy lip syncs along, doing an obnoxious cock o' the walk around the ring.}
