<A>__{we see cheryl from the breasts up. we hear violent coughing from down below.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{i'm choking}
<A>__{cheryl moves away. we realize she has been perched astride his face, more or less. the coughing continues. mark looks a bit panicked.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{the mouth piece.}
<A>__{cheryl locates the mouth piece to his oxygen supply and puts it between his lips. after a few breaths he is relatively relaxed. she lies down beside him.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{i guess that one's off the menu until further notice.}
<A>__{mark finally lets go of the mouth piece. he looks melancholy. she does not fail to notice.}
<C>__{cheryl }
<D>__{come on, lighten up, will you.}
<A>__{mark smiles. he seems to be lost in some memory.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{pony girl, pony girl, won't you be my pony girl?}
<A>__{he looks at cheryl.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{that was what my father used to sing to my little sister, karin. that was before she died. she was kind of a sad little girl. it didn't do much good. i'm really sorry that the last time i saw her, i fought with her. i made her cry.}
<A>__{mark's eyes begin to look teary.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{my parents could have left me in the nursing home, you know. they found out the average life expectancy for polios in nursing homes was 18 months. so they took me home. they gave me a life.}
<A>__{cheryl props herself up on one elbow.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{mark, i'm just going to go the bathroom for a quick pee. when i come back, we're going to achieve full penetration. but before i go, i want you to close your eyes.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{is this a game?}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{no, it's not a game. just do as i say. close your eyes.}
<A>__{he closes his eyes.}
<C>__{cheryl }
<D>__{picture yourself as a six year old boy at the beach. can you do that?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{yes, very easily.}
