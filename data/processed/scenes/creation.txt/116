<L>__{interior treatment room. day}
<A>__{darwin sits with a blanket draped over his shoulders, under the merciless glare of a heat lamp. sweat pours off him and forms puddles at his feet.}
<L>__{exterior terrace. day.}
<A>__{a bright sunny day. darwin, looking weak but purged, sits on the terrace, sipping a glass of foul tasting mineral water and looking out over the stone houses, fields and valleys of malvern. gully sits with him, interviewing him.}
<C>__{gully}
<D>__{what action do you most associate with the symptoms. eating? strong emotion? strenuous excercise?}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{does the exercise of memory count as an action.}
<C>__{gully}
<D>__{memory of what.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{my eldest daughter. you remember her.}
<C>__{gully}
<D>__{of course. of course. you must accept there was nothing more we could do.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{i know that. i know.}
<A>__{a long, awkward silence, neither of them wants to recapitulate the events of annies death.}
<C>__{gully}
<D>__{you say you were writing about her.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{no. it is a scientific texterior but i had reached a point, beyond which it was impossible to progress. she had been my companion throughout. now it seemed she was ahead of me in a place i could not follow.}
<C>__{gully}
<D>__{of course. plainly she is in heaven.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{that is what my wife believes. it is a great consolation to her}
<C>__{gully}
<D>__{but not to you.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{emma and i have become ...divided on it.}
<C>__{gully}
<D>__{does it affect your marital relations.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{we have none ...to speak of.}
<C>__{gully}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{are you familiar with the writings of dequincy."there is no such thing known to the mind as forgetting."}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{i don't know what it means.}
<C>__{gully}
<D>__{he suggests we have thoughts which do not actually enter the realm of consciousness. nervous fibres exist after all throughout the whole body. is it not possible that certain primal feelings manifest in some physical way. eczema. boils. a fever. might some blocked passion imitate a gall stone? or even manufacture one.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{well, until someone devises a machine to read nervous impulses, or a telescope to look inside the body i suppose we can only guess at it.}
<C>__{gully}
<D>__{we can mr darwin. we can look inside you. if you find yourself open to it, there is a way of seeing.}
