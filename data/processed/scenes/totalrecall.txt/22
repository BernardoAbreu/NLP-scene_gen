<L>__{interior basement car park day}
<A>__{the two men lead quail past a number of cars to their own vehicle.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{where are you taking me? 1st agent you told everyone at rekall about you trip to mars. where you went, who you worked for, what you did }
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{but i didn't... are you telling me... i did go to mars? i don't remember? 1st agent you've remembered too much. the sphinx project, for a start....}
<C>__{quail}
<P>__{(confused;}
<D>__{remembers only}
<P>__{fragments)}
<D>__{sphinx?... no, no, i don't, i... what about the people at rekall? i don't recall rekall but you said if they know what i did? why don't you ask them? they'll tell you i didn't... 1st agent they've been taken care of.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<A>__{neither man bothers answering. they arrive at their car and open the door for quail. he hesitates.}
<C>__{quail}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{what are you going to do with me? 1st agent get in the car.}
<A>__{he slaps quail hard across the face. quail is terrified. he is tearful with fear.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{my god! no! you're going to kill me!}
<A>__{he cringes. his hands across his face.}
<D>__{1st agent no one's going to kill you if [you do what you're told.] we're visiting e.i.o. for some new tests. now get in, or do we start playing rough?}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{no! it's not my fault! you can't do it!}
<A>__{they start to force him into the car physically. suddenly, quail stops cringing. the fear disappears from his face, and is replaced by an odd, thoughtful expression.}
<C>__{quail}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{wait a minute, i remember 1st agent what, quail? what do you remember?}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{on mars... they tried to kill me... and....}
<B>__{quail transforms into a highly skilled killing machine.}
<A>__{in an instant, he karate chops both agents across the windpipe, and they crumple to the ground. quail steps back. he stares at the two bodies, incredulous; then stares at his own deadly hands. it is as though they belong to someone else. then, leaving the two agents sprawled across the alley, he races back into the basement door of his building.}
