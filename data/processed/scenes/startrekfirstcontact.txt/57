<L>__{interior borg hive}
<A>__{the environmental control room seen earlier has now been transformed into the inner sanctum of the borg. the room has a dark, moist, organic feel a tropical jungle of cybernetic equipment. the borg are altering the room, converting starfleet technology and materials into the living, bio mechanical look of the borg. we see one borg drone attach a small pod to a starfleet console and activate it. the pod immediately sends out a complex web of borg technology which covers the starfleet console inside and out. it's like weeds overpowering a flower bed within seconds the console has been borgified. the walls, ceiling and floor are now honeycombed with the alcoves that make up the borg collective. borg drones are motionless in their alcoves, cabling and other conduits connecting them to various equipment... while other borg are moving about the room, carrying out various modifications to the room. at one point, we see ensign porter. he's been completely borgified. his skin pale, expression blank. no hint of humanity left.}
<B>__{data}
<A>__{still strapped to the table, which is twisting and rotating, giving him frightening new glimpses of the room. a new image appears six borg drones are clustered together in one section of the room, each with an elaborate series of hoses and conduits connected to its face. through the tubes we can see an exchange of fluid and energy pulsing back and forth some sort of bizarre "feeding" or "renewal" is going on. the tubes all seem to lead toward the ceiling. data is now horizontal on his back and the table locks into position. a borg drone opens a panel on the side of data's head, and begins connecting a thick bundle of optical cabling to it.}
<C>__{data}
<P>__{(to borg)}
<D>__{your efforts to assimilate me will be unsuccessful.}
<A>__{the borg ignores him, activates a console... and the cabling connected to data's head lights up with power. they're trying to connect him to the collective. data thinks for a moment, tilts his head slightly... and then suddenly there's a shower of sparks from the cabling he's been connected to. the lights on the cable go out. data has thwarted their attempts.}
<C>__{data}
<P>__{(to borg)}
<D>__{it would appear that resistance is not always futile.}
<A>__{suddenly a new voice is heard echoing through the room a woman's voice, low, seductive, deadly:}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{brave words. i've heard them before from thousands of species across thousands of worlds... since long before you were created.}
<A>__{data looks up toward...}
<B>__{the ceiling}
<A>__{a rustle of movemnet somewhere in the cyber tangle... almost like a snake slithering beneath the weeds. and for a brief instant we get a glimpse of a face unlike any borg we've ever seen. the face of a woman. pale skinned... piercing eyes...raven hair slicked back... a hauntingly beautiful image in a sea of nightmarish technology. and then it's gone.}
<B>__{data}
<A>__{frowns. he saw it, too, but he's not sure what to make of it.}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{but now... they are all one with the borg.}
<C>__{data}
<D>__{i am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. as an android, i am in complete control of my neural net. the information contained there cannot be forcibly removed.}
<C>__{woman's voice}
<D>__{you are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. finding your weakness is only a matter of time.}
<A>__{suddenly three borg drones converge on data with various wicked looking borg devices. one of the borg has a specialized cybernetic arm, which extrudes a series of stiletto tipped drill spikes. as the six inch spikes begin to bore into data's head...}
