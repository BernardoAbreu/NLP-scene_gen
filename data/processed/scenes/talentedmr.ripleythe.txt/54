<L>__{interior dickie's house. late afternoon.}
<A>__{later, dickie is slumped in an armchair at the open window overlooking the slipway. he's playing sax. a forlorn, keening phrase from you don't know what love is. ripley appears, begins tidying the mess in the living room. he picks up empty bottles, an abandoned bikini top.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i know why you're upset.}
<P>__{(dickie continues playing)}
<D>__{i know about silvana, dickie. about you and silvana.}
<A>__{dickie stops playing.}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{what about us?}
<A>__{he now has an armful of dishes and glasses and bottles.}
<C>__{dickie }
<P>__{(losing his temper)}
<D>__{you don't have to clean up! really!}
<A>__{ripley disappears into the kitchen.}
<C>__{dickie }
<P>__{(as ripley returns)}
<D>__{she was pregnant. did you know that? do you know what that means in a place like this?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i'm prepared to take the blame.}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{you've been so good to me. you're the brother i never had. i'm the brother you never had.}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{she came to me for help, she needed money, and i didn't help her. i didn't help her. now she's dead and it's my fault.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i'm not going to say anything to marge, or anybody, the police it's a secret between us and i will keep it.}
<A>__{and he disappears again, leaving dickie to resume the sax, somehow in thrall to ripley.}
<P>__{ripley (o s)}
<D>__{dear tom, i think the time has come to discontinue your expense checks...}
