<L>__{exterior elevator dusk}
<A>__{the doors open and ted and athena emerge upon the third floor. ted follows athena with the cart down the hallway to her room.}
<B>__{at the honeymoon suite door}
<A>__{ted opens the door, then lifts the easiest bags first. in the center of the room is a jacuzzi with hokey plastic cupids poised with urns on each side. a dormant fireplace looms beyond the still hot tub. ted stares at the heavy bag with anxiety then looks in front of him to athena as she rubs the round plastic head of a little cupid and mumbles, "perfect." then, arms open wide, chin lifted to heaven, eyes closed, she mumbles a faint incantation. then she does a belly dance wiggle and turns to ted, who is truly perplexed.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{well the other bag i need it.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{he starts to lift it, again straining and turning purple. he laughs sickly.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what the hell you got in here, lady? nuclear weapons?}
<A>__{she relieves him of the task and effortlessly picks up the bag.}
<C>__{athena}
<P>__{(dryly)}
<D>__{the white cliffs of dover.}
<A>__{ted is stunned as she slings the bag over her shoulder and pauses to pull a 10 spot out of her cleavage. she hands it to him. ted is grateful and disoriented.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{the others will be coming soon. send them, pleeze.}
<A>__{ted nods, confused by "the others," and walks off with the cart. then he turns from outside the doorway.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{oh i forgot to show you how to turn on the jacuzzi.}
<A>__{but athena is ahead of him she flips a switch and water begins to flow from the baby cupids' urns into the hot tub.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{i been in dis' place many new year's. so... you send the others to me, huh. go now.}
<A>__{as she says this, the door closes with a strange force, shutting ted out. athena takes the bag to the bedroom of the suite.}
<B>__{in the suite bedroom}
<A>__{a round bed with pink tuck'n'roll headboard. it's impossible to imagine having an orgasm in this room unless it were achieved by laughing. athena carefully removes a large, beautiful white slab of stone from her tapestry bag. she caresses it and carries it like a baby to the bed and places it in the very center, the head of the rock resting on dusty heart shaped pillows. then she removes from her bag a pink negligee and matching high heeled slippers. and these she places with reverence on the bed.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{on this night, oh great goddess diana, we restore your virgin flesh and bring you back to real life.}
<A>__{close on the rock slab. we hold the artifact.}
<C>__{athena}
<D>__{soon i take you to the pond for a cleansing. well, it's a swimming pool, but it will be under the setting sun, okay?}
