<A>__{as the big hydraulic jib swings one of the mir subs out over the water. lovett walks as he talks with bobby buell, the partners' rep. they weave among deck cranes, launch crew, sub maintenance guys.}
<C>__{buell}
<A>__{the partners are pissed.}
<C>__{brock}
<A>__{bobby, buy me time. i need time.}
<C>__{buell}
<A>__{we're running thirty thousand a day, and we're six days over. i'm telling you what they're telling me. the hand is on the plug. it's starting to pull.}
<C>__{brock}
<A>__{well you tell the hand i need another two days! bobby, bobby, bobby... we're close! i smell it. i smell ice. she had the diamond on... now we just have to find out where it wound up. i just gotta work her a bit more. okay? brock turns and sees lizy standing behind him. she has overheard the past part of his dialogue with buell. he goes to her and hustles her away from buell, toward a quite spot on the deck.}
<C>__{brock}
<A>__{hey, lizzy. i need to talk to you for a second.}
<C>__{lizzy}
<A>__{don't you mean work me?}
<C>__{brock}
<A>__{look, i'm running out of time. i need your help.}
<C>__{lizzy}
<A>__{i'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and}
<C>__{lizzy }
<A>__{one year old grandmother. i came down here to tell you to back off.}
<C>__{brock}
<P>__{(with undisguised desperation)}
<A>__{lizzy... you gotta understand something. i've bet it all to find the heart of the ocean. i've got all my dough tied up in this thing. my wife even divorced me over this hunt. i need what's locked inside your grandma's memory.}
<P>__{(he holds out his hand)}
<A>__{you see this? right here? she looks at his hand, palm up. empty. cupped, as if around an imaginary shape.}
<C>__{lizzy}
<A>__{what?}
<C>__{brock}
<A>__{that's the shape my hand's gonna be when i hold that thing. you understand? i'm not leaving here without it.}
<C>__{lizzy}
<A>__{look, brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. don't forget, she contacted you. she's out here for her own reasons, god knows what they are.}
<C>__{lovett}
<A>__{maybe she wants to make peace with the past.}
<C>__{lizzy}
<A>__{what past? she has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the titanic until two days ago.}
<C>__{lovett}
<A>__{then we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time.}
<C>__{lizzy}
<P>__{(looks at him hard)}
<A>__{you think she was really there?}
<C>__{lovett}
<A>__{oh, yeah. yeah, i'm a believer. she was there.}
