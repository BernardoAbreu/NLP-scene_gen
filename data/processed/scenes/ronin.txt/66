<L>__{exterior the highway later night}
<A>__{a car we haven't seen before, a citroen, hums up the french highway in the night, along on the road. it's a postcard moment, but only for a moment.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{i'm telling you...}
<L>__{interior the citroen same time}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{that i could be dead and i'd drive better than you.}
<A>__{deirdre is driving, and larry much to his chagrin is in the passenger seat, watching her every move.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<P>__{(very curt)}
<D>__{oh shut up...}
<A>__{in the back seat sam and vincent have a map spread out. vincent is tracing gregor's route so far, and we follow his red magic marker as it traces a line up the highway.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{he's going north.}
<P>__{(circles something on map)}
<D>__{that's aix en provence, where he used the phone.}
<A>__{sam runs his finger along the length of the highway on the map. destination: paris.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(making up his mind)}
<D>__{he's going back.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{not necessarily. he could go off road at any number of places. he might not even be in the country anymore.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it's paris. the route's too indirect for anything else. a guy like gregor, he doesn't waste time on this road unless he has to be on it in the first place. otherwise, he'd be out of the country by now. he's going to paris.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now i just hope we can find him before he gets there.}
<C>__{deirdre}
<D>__{if somebody else doesn't find him first.}
