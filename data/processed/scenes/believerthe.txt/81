<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{danny's face sweating, haunted, as if he's just woken from the previous. he's still walking down the street, but now, as if to flee his thoughts, he steps through a door into...}
<L>__{interior bookstore day}
<A>__{a jewish bookstore. he grabs the first book that comes to hand, reads for a moment, throws it down in disgust. picks it up again, is still reading when...}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{hey, danny...danny...}
<A>__{he looks up at a young man about his own age; wearing a yarmulke, but otherwise normal, hair clean, beard neatly trimmed.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{it's stuart. stuart schoenbaum.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{shlomo?}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{yeah...}
<A>__{danny puts down the book, trying to conceal that he's been reading it. he offers a hand. stuart manages to restrain the impulse to embrace him, but takes the hand warmly.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{jeez, it's been since, what, kenny's wedding.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{yeah, uh... so how are you? what's going on?}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{i'm in the rabbinic program at jts...}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{jts...?}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{what about you? what are you doing? something strange, i bet.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i'm in a kind of...underground...thing.}
<C>__{stuart}
<P>__{(impressed, excited)}
<D>__{are you an artist?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{no, no... not that kind of... underground. more a private... business. private.}
<A>__{meaning he can't talk about it. stuart nods. danny notices a young woman: dark, curly hair, sharp eyes.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{you remember miriam....}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{yeah, hey, how're you doing...}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{hey...}
<A>__{an irony to her. they certainly remember each other.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{she's at yale law interning with the district attorney...}
<P>__{(miriam makes a face)}
<D>__{we're getting married next spring. in israel.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{wow, that's uh...great...}
<A>__{he glances at miriam; but she has picked up the book he'd been reading, is leafing through it. it makes him uneasy.}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{it's great seeing you....}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{maybe danny'd like to come to the minyan for the holidays....}
<A>__{danny gives her a dirty look, but stuart's thrilled:}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{oh, good idea. we're davening with this group from the seminary. interesting people, very open minded, you might like them. and guess who comes...avi! you guys could go at it again like the good old days.}
<A>__{as stuart scribbles an address...}
<C>__{stuart}
<D>__{danny and avi used to argue about everything. torah, talmud, politics, girls. it always ended in a fistfight.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{i remember.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i always won.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{the arguments, anyway.}
<C>__{stuart}
<P>__{(hands danny the address)}
<D>__{it's a k.i. on 101st. in the little chapel. try to make it. it'd be fun.}
<A>__{danny smiles. he has no intention of going. once they leave, he picks up the book and resumes reading.}
