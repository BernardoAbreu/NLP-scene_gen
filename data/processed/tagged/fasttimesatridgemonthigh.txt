<D>__{hey, mon. sign my annual.}
<A>__{spicoli slips the annual into the kid's crotch. the stoner winces in pain, but still opens the book and lingers on all the signings in spicoli's annual. they are all drug related messages from fellow stoners. after a moment, spicoli's friend signs: "thanks for the reds. todd."}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{hey, mon, good thing we're going to mexico this summer. 'cause you're gonna get kicked out of your house when your parents read your annual.}

<A>__{brad hamilton pushes both doors open, and makes his entrance into the last dance. there is a lot of activity going on, but all nearby eyes turn to brad as he walks into the dance. fifteen kids immediately gravitate towards him. they all want brad to sign their annuals, to talk about the 7 11 incident. onstage, the t birds play the beatles' "it won't be long". we see brad's old girlfriend lisa push up to him. her new jock boyfriend holds a protective arm around her.}

<A>__{lisa's boyfriend pulls his arm tighter around her.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{will you sign my annual, brad?}
<A>__{brad smiles, nods. he signs, and gives her his. we then see brad's three buddies from carl's jr. come up, pat him on the back and grab his shoulder. brad studies them warily.}
<D>__{buddy #1 fuckin' manager of 7 11! buddy #2 get us jobs over there, brad! you can do it!}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{since when do you guys want to work at 7 11? buddy #2 come on, brad! it would be great! all of us together!}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{well, 7 11 is a tremendous operation. it's really changed, man. they've got great food, great magazines, videogames... it's class. total class. buddy #3 as soon as you can get us in there, we're gone from carl's, brad. buddy #2 yeah, man, all the little punks from junior high have taken over the place.}

<C>__{brad}
<D>__{hey, thompson! wendell! get a job!}

<D>__{hamilton!}
<A>__{brad turns around, seen spicoli sitting on the bottom rung of the bleachers. spicoli looks back with true respect.}
