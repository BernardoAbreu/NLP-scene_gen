<L>__{interior hotel parking structure night}
<A>__{his footsteps echo in the parking structure as he walks along a row of parked cars. a faint jangling sound stops him dead in his tracks. he turns and scans the garage behind him. it's quiet, eerily still. he continues onward, but hears the faint jangling sound again a moment later. spins, trying to place it. there it is again. closer this time. something moving, hiding, behind the rows of cars over there. he bends, trying to get a look under the cars. can't see anything. unnerved, he moves on, clicks the button on his keychain remote. the lights flash on his car fifty yards away. but as he continues toward it they reveal themselves, trodding into view from between the cars, choke chain collars jangling around their necks...}
<B>__{three pit bulls}
<A>__{battle scarred. vicious. the dogs from diego's house. they sit down right in front of barron's car. it's a surreal moment, a trio of attack dogs sitting at quiet attention, square jawwed, black eyed, the kinetic calm before a predator strikes. barron draws his gun. fires a warning shot over their heads. bang! deafeningly loud, it echoes through the garage like a thunderclap. but the dogs don't move, just sit there staring. barron lowers his gun. it's time to get the hell out of here. he backpedals, making no sudden movements, gun still trained on the dogs. they watch him, eyes livening with excitement, one of their back legs twitching in anticipation. barron quickens his step and that's their cue. all at once, with explosive speed, the dogs spring into motion, vicious and muscled and smelling blood. barron fires an errant shot and takes off running. but he can't match their pace, the deadly trio race along the row of police cruisers, closing the gap with ease. at the last second barron jumps the partition. the pit bulls crash skull first into the concrete, but continue their pursuit unfazed as barron takes off up the adjoining ramp. he jumps up onto the row of cars and runs across the hoods, denting the metal. the dogs jump up behind him, relentless in their pursuit. jaws snapping at his heels, barron takes to the car roofs, the pitbulls leaping from car to car behind him. he looks back just in time to see the dogs launch themselves. they hit him at chest height, sinking teeth in his flesh. stumbling forward, struggling to keep their jaws from his throat, barron doesn't see what's coming. the last car. the edge of the parking garage. he's over the edge before he even understands, flailing his arms for a handhold that doesn't exist. the ground, far below, flies up at him in a rush of acceleration. we hear a sickening thud and find barron lying face down on the pavement below, blood pooling around him. clinging to life, he opens his eyes and sees the trio of pit bulls sitting obediently beside him, unharmed, watching. but from a distance we see there is only barron. dying alone between the parked cars. no dogs anywhere in sight.}
