<L>__{interior trailer home day}
<A>__{much progress has been made on the trailer. rose and norah work on the last remaining piles of trash.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{it seems wrong though doesn't it... to throw everything away.}
<A>__{rose tosses a tattered fanny pack onto the heap in the garbage can. norah plucks it out and opens it. norah pulls out a photo id. she holds it up. the woman on the id looks street worn and crazy.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{i bet this is her.}
<A>__{rose sweeps. norah digs deeper into the fanny pack and pulls out a small packet wrapped in satin ribbon. norah unties the ribbon and finds a stack of old school photos. each photo is of a different grade. norah flips through the stack and the girl appears to grow up.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{wow, look at this.}
<A>__{norah holds the senior photo next to the id. the resemblance between the two is clear.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{think it's her daughter?}
<A>__{rose looks. shrugs.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{shouldn't we do something? try to find her or something?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{that's none of your business, norah.}
<A>__{rose picks up a bag stuffed with cans and fast food wrappers. she screams and drops the bag. a giant ball of maggots writhes at her feet.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{hand me that.}
<A>__{norah grabs the dust pan and hands it to rose.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{what if she doesn't know? wouldn't you want to know if this was mom?}
<A>__{norah looks closely at the i.d. as rose deposits trash and maggots into the garbage bin. the comparison angers rose.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{mom was never like this. mom would never have been like this.}
<A>__{norah thinks about that and looks back at the i.d.}
<C>__{norah}
<D>__{i wonder how she died?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{damnit norah, we still have a lot of shit to do here. are you just gonna talk?}
