<C>__{man}
<D>__{why do i have to put up with you? what a tramp. you call this a home? i work all day for this?}
<A>__{he marches away, leaving josh standing alone. josh keeps going, whirling around. he reaches a set of stairs. the stairs descend into darkness. josh squints into the dark, afraid.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{dalton? where are you?}
<A>__{the low rumble of this place is the only reply. josh turns to walk away. a distant voice stops him.}
<C>__{dalton }
