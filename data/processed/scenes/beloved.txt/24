<A>__{paul turns back to find the red light in the hall is gone.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i thought you said she died soft as cream.}
<C>__{sethe}
<P>__{(busying herself in kitchen)}
<D>__{oh that's not baby suggs. that's my daughter. the one i sent ahead with the boys before i run off.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{she didn't live?}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{the boys too?}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{no, they alive they run off before baby suggs died. the one i was carrying when i left sweet home is all i got left.}
<A>__{still affected by the light, paul eases himself down at the table, finding something to say.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{well, probably best..if a negro boy got legs he ought to use them. sit down too long, somebody figure out a way to tie them up.......}
<P>__{(the image disturbs sethe)}
<D>__{you by yourself then?}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{me and denver... my daughter.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no man?}
<P>__{(sethe shakes head "no")}
<D>__{and that's all right by you?}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{it's all right by me...i cook at a restaurant in town. sew a little on the sly....}
<A>__{she places a bottle and a glass on the table before him. the light jarred him. he snatches the bottle to drink and calm himself down. she jokes.}
<C>__{sethe}
<D>__{you look more done in by a walk through my front hall than all those eighteen years of walking put together.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{got that right.}
