<C>__{holden}
<D>__{aren't you at least going to comment?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{here's my comment fuck you.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{that was so unfair. you know how unfair that was.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{it's unfair that i'm in love with you?}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{no, it's unfortunate that you're in love with me. it's unfair that you felt the fucking need to unburden your soul about it. do you remember for a fucking second who i am?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{so? people change.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{oh, it's that simple? you fall in love with me and want a romantic relationship, nothing changes for you with the exception of feeling hunky dorey all the time. but what about me? it's not that simple, is it? i can't just get into a relationship with you without throwing my whole fucking world into upheaval!}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{but that's every relationship! there's always going to be a period of adjustment.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{period of adjustment?!?}
<P>__{(hitting him)}
<D>__{there's no 'period of adjustment' holden! i'm fucking gay! that's who i am! and you assume i can turn that around just because you've got a crush?!?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{if this is a crush... then i don't know if i could take the real thing if it ever happens.}
<A>__{she looks at him, rain drenching the pair. she shakes her head ruefully.}
<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{go home, holden.}
<A>__{she walks away. holden stands there, at a loss. then he turns and heads back to his car. as he reaches the door and turns to look back at her, alyssa pounces on him, grabs his face and locks lips with him, big time. he drops his keys and embraces her. and there they stand, by the side of the road, drenched kissing.}
