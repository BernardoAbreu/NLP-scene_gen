<L>__{interior lily's apartment night}
<A>__{lily stands at a hot plate in her "kitchen" frying an egg. heavy footsteps from the hall catch her attention, growing louder, then stopping at her door. a knock.}
<C>__{harlin }
<D>__{lily?}
<A>__{lily frantically rumages through drawers. she pulls a knife, but it's only a butter knife. she tosses it aside. lily moves to the door and looks out the peep hole.}
<C>__{harlin }
<D>__{.jake sent me.}
<A>__{lily moves to the closet.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{jake? hold on. i just got out of the shower.}
<A>__{more knocking. lily rumages in the closet and a baseball bat. she hefts the bat and takes a stance in front of the door. more knocking.}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{hold on!}
<A>__{another knock. lily slowly reaches for the doorknob. then the door flies open with a crash. harlin fills the doorway.}
<C>__{harlin}
<D>__{the king would like to have a word with you.}
<A>__{lily, wide eyed, stands frozen with the bat still cocked..}
<C>__{lily}
<D>__{uh, right now?}
<C>__{harli}
<D>__{please. i have a car waiting.}
<A>__{lily takes a swing. harlin easily grabs the bat and backhands lily. she goes flying back into the far wall, bounces off and lands with a thud at harlin's feet where she finds the butter knife. harlin reaches down and pulls lily up by the hair. the egg sizzles in the pan. lily takes a stab at harlin, but the knife just bounces off his coat. harlin slaps lily again, sending her flying into the stove. smoke starts to rise from the burning egg. harlin steps closer, but lily throws her hands up in surrender. a spoon rattles in a cup as the rumble of a subway train grows louder.}
<C>__{harlin}
<P>__{(drowned out by rumble)}
<D>__{i apologize for the }
<C>__{lily}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{harlin}
<P>__{(yelling back)}
<D>__{i said, i apologize for }
<A>__{lily shakes her head and points to her ear and mouths, "can't hear you." harlin moves closer and they lean into each other.}
<C>__{harlin }
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{i said, i apologize for }
<P>__{(the subway passes)}
<D>__{ the door.}
<C>__{lily}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{no problem.}
<A>__{she grabs the smoking pan from the stove and whacks harlin across the head. the burned egg lands on the floor. lily watches as he sways and teeters on his feet, like a drunk. she raises the pan again... but before she delivers the final blow, harlin steps on the egg, causing his leg to shoot out from under him. he lands flat on his back, out cold. the wood floor creaks with his weight. lily wipes the blood from her nose and turns the hot plate off.}
