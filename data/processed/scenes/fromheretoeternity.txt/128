<B>__{medium shot}
<A>__{prew comes toward camera, laboriously struggling up the road. his side is hemorrhaging steadily, his shirt and trousers blood soaked. he stops close to camera. he wads his handkerchief, sticks it inside his shirt near the knife wound. he smiles wearily, crookedly.}
<C>__{prew}
<P>__{(mumbles to himself)}
<D>__{gonna have an awful bad scar there...}
<A>__{he lights a cigarette, his fingers shaking. the flame from the match illuminates his left wrist. there is a deep scar on it. it seems to fascinate prew as he stares at it, rubs his fingers across it.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{... scars...}
<A>__{he turns, moves on up the road; camera moves close behind him, as if overhearing his thoughts which come over on sound track.}
<C>__{prew's voice }
<D>__{... got that one fallin off the barn back home... gashed it on a spike... dad laughed... dead now... uncle john+s dead, too...}
<A>__{prew moves away from camera out of shot.}
