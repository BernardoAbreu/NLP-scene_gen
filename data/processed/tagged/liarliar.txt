<D>__{oh! i see you mean he's a lawyer.}
<A>__{max shrugs.}
<L>__{interior courtroom . day}
<A>__{fletcher reid, early 30's, stands before the judge. his manner is utterly genuine and convincing.}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{a dark street. . . a stormy night... two desperate men struggle... one man is taken to the hospital, the other to ja il. the prosecutor wants you to believe this is an open and shut case of a poor man, brutally victimized.}
<A>__{he nods at the victim a fragile old man in his 70's.}
<C>__{fletcher }
<D>__{well, for once i agree with t he prosecutor. this is an open and shut case but the true victim is my client.}
<A>__{fletcher's client is a 250 pound brute in a suit.}
<C>__{fletcher }
<D>__{put yourself in his shoes for a moment walking home from church, alone, in a frightening part of the suburbs.}
<A>__{as he describes his client's movements, fletcher acts them}
<T>__{out:}
<C>__{fletcher }
<D>__{you're nervous, timid, looking over your shoulder when suddenly, you encounter him }
<P>__{(pointing at the old man)}
<D>__{pouncing from the shadows. you quiver in fear. the streetlight flashes on something shiny in his hand a knife?}
<A>__{suddenly fletcher becomes the attacker, brandishing a weapon. the jurors recoil.}
<C>__{fletcher }
<D>__{and in that terrifying instant you do what any respectable citizen would you defend y ou rse lf. only after you shatter his arm and collarbone do you realize it's all a mistake... the man was merely walking away from an atm machine, the apparent flash of metal caused by his bank card.}
<A>__{he reveals the weapon in his hand is only a credit card.}
<C>__{fletcher }
<P>__{(concerned)}
<D>__{as you stand over his crumpled, though potentially still dangerous form, your he art goes out to him. you want to help. first, you gather up the many bills he dropped, to stop them from bl owi ng away. second, in an effort to get the name and number of someone to notify, you take his wallet. finally, you leap into the man's lexus to head for assistance, when suddenly a police car speeds up. you breathe a sigh of relief: "someone to look after the injured man! oh joy!" but do the police applaud your initiative? do they hail your heroism? no they arrest you and throw you in the slammer!}
<A>__{he walks along the jury box:}
<C>__{fletcher }
<D>__{and why? why does the state turn its massive power against this individual?}
<P>__{(takes an impressive moment, then answers his own question:)}
<D>__{discrimination,}
<P>__{(to a black juror)}
<D>__{but this time it's not based on race.}
<P>__{(to a female juror)}
<D>__{not based on gender.}
<P>__{(to a man wearing a crucifix)}
<D>__{not based on religion,}
<P>__{(to a heavy set juror)}
<D>__{no this time it's discrimination based on size! i know what the prosecution wants you to think i t ' s always the big guy's fault. is that what we've come to as a society persecuting people because they're large?}
<A>__{fletcher points accusingly at the opposition.}
<C>__{fletcher }
<D>__{shame on you, mister prosecutor! shame on you!}
<P>__{(turning back to jury)}
<D>__{the state is trying to barbeque my client on the spit of justice. only you can douse the flames. the decision is your s. and please...don't let your emotions run away with y ou . the fact that my client is a family man, raising his sons alone after the tragic death of their mother, has absolutely no bearing on this case.}
<A>__{in the front row we see two sad faced young children.}
<C>__{fletcher }
<D>__{instead, let cold reason be your guide as you decide the fate of this church going, orphan rasing widower!}

<A>__{max nods. fletcher's at a loss for how to begin. then:}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{you wanted me to stop lying. but lying isn't the problem. .. why we lie that's the problem. sometimes we lie to make someone else feel better. but sometimes we lie because the truth gets in our way...}

<D>__{what?}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{max, you made the wish at 9:15. i've been able to lie for the last seven minutes.}

<C>__{max}
<D>__{so then, you were...}
<C>__{fletcher}
<D>__{no! it wasn't a lie. i just wanted to be honest with you and tell you there was no wish to guarantee it anymore. you just have to believe me.}

<A>__{fletcher winds up in an exagerated super fast motion, then instantly shifts to super slow motion. max cracks up. audrey laughs. jerry can't help but smile, too. there may be better things in life... but at this moment, it's hard to think of a single one. honestly.}
