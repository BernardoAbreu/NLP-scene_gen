<C>__{lack}
<D>__{thanks, charlie. that was useful.}
<A>__{the wind shifts and black smoke envelopes them.}
<C>__{manolete}
<D>__{i can't see!}
<A>__{riley pulls out a flashlight and shines it under the dash. he team fans out around the t bird. the smoke is so thick they can't make out anything. including each other. harlie peers into openings that shift on the breeze. what he doesn't see, what he can't see, is what's behind him... ..a female walker, wearing the soiled and tattered remnants of a bridal gown. the fabric seems to glow in the smoke. the bride shuffles toward charlie. we see it coming. no one else does. just as it opens its mouth to bite... blam! slack shoots! her bullet cuts closer than the one charlie fired, clipping off the top of his ear before}

<D>__{i got it! let's get out of here!}
<A>__{riley leads the team into the t bird. manolete starts to get out from under the dash. as teahouse settles into a seat by the door... ...something heavy and wet smacks his shoulder. it's a forearm! it drops onto teahouse as if thrown at him.}
<C>__{teahouse}
<D>__{god! oh, god, what's this?!}
<A>__{teahouse hurls the bloody thing onto the asphalt. shockingly, the arm springs back, thumping against teahouse's face! a twist of torn muscle, no thicker than clothesline, is keeping the limb loosely attached to... ...a dead thing that has crawled beside the t bird. lifting itself, it bites a large filet out of teahouse's arm. charlie}
<B>__{m}
<A>__{shoots it. anolete climbs up behind the wheel and...vrooooom!...pedal to the metal he pulls out of the depot. slack glances at teahouse, then, wind in her hair, leans in close to riley.}
