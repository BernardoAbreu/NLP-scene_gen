<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{we are close on the dude, upside down. as the picture fades in the bowling noises continue, but filtered and fainterior they come from the dude's walkman, the headset of which is now askew, with one arm off his ear. as the dude opens his eyes we spiral slowly upward to put him right side around. his head is now resting against hardwood floor, not rug.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{oh man.}
<A>__{he raises himself onto his elbows and massages the red lump on his jaw. the beeper on his belt is blinking red in sync with the continuing irritating beeps.}
<B>__{wide on the room}
<A>__{an end table is upset, but otherwise the furniture is in place. the rug is gone. the dude looks around. the bowling sounds continue. the beeps continue. the phone starts to jangle.}
<B>__{track}
<A>__{we push brandt down the familiar marble hallway. again there is a distant aria. brandt throws out a wrist to look at his watch.}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{they called about eighty minutes ago. they want you to take the money and drive north on the 4 5. they'll call you on the portable phone with instructions in about forty minutes. one person only or i'd go with you. they were very clear on that: one person only. what happened to your jaw?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{oh, nothin', you know.}
<A>__{they have reached the little desk outside of the big lebowski's office; brandt opens its bottom drawer with a key and takes out an attache case. he hands this to the dude along with a cellular phone in a battery pack carrying case.}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{here's the money, and the phone. please, dude, follow whatever instructions they give.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{her life is in your hands.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{oh, man, don't say that..}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{mr. lebowski asked me to repeat that: her life is in your hands.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{shit.}
<C>__{brandt}
<D>__{her life is in your hands, dude. and report back to us as soon as it's done.}
<A>__{dude's car we pan off the dude, driving, to his point of view through the front windshield. the headlights play over walter standing waiting in front of the storefront of sobchak security. though he is wearing khaki shorts and shirt, the fact that he holds a battered brown briefcase makes him look oddly like a commuter. he also holds an irregular shape bundled in brown wrapping paper. the car stops in front of him and he opens the dude's door and hands in the briefcase.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{take the ringer. i will drive.}
<A>__{the dude takes the briefcase and slides over.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{the what?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{the ringer! the ringer, dude! have they called yet?}
<A>__{the dude opens the briefcase and paws bemusedly through it as the car starts rolling.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{what the hell is this?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{my dirty undies. laundry, dude. the whites.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{agh }
<A>__{he closes the briefcase.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{walter, i'm sure there's a reason you brought your dirty undies }
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{thaaaat's right, dude. the weight. the ringer can't look empty.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{walter what the fuck are you thinking?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{well you're right, dude, i got to thinking. i got to thinking why should we settle for a measly fucking twenty grand }
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{we? what the fuck we? you said you just wanted to come along }
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{my point, dude, is why should we settle for twenty grand when we can keep the entire million. am i wrong?}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{yes you're wrong. this isn't a fucking game, walter }
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{it is a fucking game. you said so yourself, dude she kidnapped herself }

<A>__{a highway sign: simi valley road it flashes by in the headlights of the roaring car.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{that was the sign.}
<A>__{walter wrestles the car onto the two lane road.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{yeah. so as long as we get her back, nobody's in a position to complain. and we keep the baksheesh.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{terrific, walter. but you haven't told me how we get her back. where is she?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{that's the simple part, dude. when we make the handoff, i grab the guy and beat it out of him.}

<C>__{walter}
<D>__{okay, dude. no time to argue. here's the bridge }
<A>__{there is the bump and new steady of the car on the bridge. the dude is twisting around to pull the money briefcase from the back seat. walter reaches one arm across dude's body to grab the laundry. and there goes the ringer. he flings it out the window.}

<C>__{walter}
<D>__{fifteen! this is it, dude! let's take that hill!}
<A>__{walter rolls out with his parcel, giving a loud grunt as he hits the pavement. the car swerves and lurches and the dude, cursing, takes the wheel.}
<B>__{outside}

<A>__{as the dude struggles out holding the satchel of money. the front of his car is crumpled into a tree. the car body saps back to the left, where the rear wheel has been shot out. walter is just rising from the ground massaging an injured knee. the dude runs up the road toward the bridge, frantically waving the satchel in the air.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{we have it! we have it!!}
<A>__{there is a distant engine roar. a motorcycle bumps up onto the road from the ravine under the bridge and, tires squealing, skids around to speed away in the opposite direction. it is closely followed by two more roaring motorcycles.}
<C>__{dude}
<D>__{we have it!!. . . we have it!}
<A>__{the dude and walter stand in the middle of the road, watching the three red tail lights fishtail away.}
