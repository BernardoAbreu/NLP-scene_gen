<L>__{interior mother' s corridor night}
<A>__{sam rings the doorbell to his mother's flat. he is wearing. an unstylish tuxedo and bow tie obviously his only dress outfit. the door is opened by a liveried flunky who's about to speak when an attractive 40 year old woman's face appears over his shoulder and addresses sam over the threshold.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{sam, i'm so glad you came. do come in.}
<L>__{interior mother's flat night}
<A>__{sam steps inside, where the flunky proceeds to search him. the place is full of sleek people smartly but less formally dresses than sam. it is an elegant baroque room lavishly appointed but still violated by the ubiquitous central service ducts that thrust through antique tapestries and gilt mirrors with little regard for aesthetics or the interior decorator's feelings.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(bewildered)}
<D>__{mother? is that you?}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(taking his arm looking}
<D>__{slightly askance at his}
<P>__{clothes)}
<D>__{of course. isn't it wonderful? the bandages came of this afternoon. come and join the fun. everybody's here.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{is mr helpmann here?}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{yes he is he wants to talk to you.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i want to talk to him.}
<A>__{sam pushes away the flunky who is by now passing a metal detector over him.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{it seems you're the first person ever to turn down a promotion. he thinks you should see a doctor.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{actually, i've decided ...}
<A>__{dr jaffe hoves into view.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{oh, louis! you know sam.}
<A>__{dr jaffe is no longer suave. he has been transformed by drink and success. mostly by drink.}
<C>__{dr jaffe}
<P>__{(as high as a kite)}
<D>__{can you believe it?! just me and my little knife! snip snip slice slice can you believe it?}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(repelled)}
<D>__{congratulations ...}
<C>__{dr jaffe}
<D>__{and this is just the beginning!!}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{dr jaffe}
<D>__{chirst yes, you've seen her with her clothes off. faces are a doddle compared to tits and arse.}
<P>__{(explains)}
<D>__{no hairline.}
<C>__{mother}
<P>__{(primly)}
<D>__{really, louis.}
<A>__{a handsome young piece of beefcake delivers a drink to}
<B>__{mother.}
<C>__{beefcake}
<D>__{i've been looking everywhere for you, ida.}
<A>__{the beefcake takes mother away.}
<C>__{dr jaffe}
<D>__{ah, dear boy ... and what do you think of your mother now?}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{it will never last.}
<A>__{sam and dr jaffe turn to see who is speaking. it is dr chapman a tall, pipe smoking, professional looking gent.}
<C>__{dr jaffe}
<P>__{(a trifle haughtily)}
<D>__{excuse me, dr chapman, did you say something?}
<C>__{dr chapman}
<D>__{that technique ... i've tried it. a nice effect. but highly unstable. in six months she'll look like grandma moses.}
<A>__{sam wishing to escape from this bitchery turns away but suddenly freezes the reflection in the large wall mirror next to him is not that of the party guests but of the grey prisoners in his dream they are massed in the room looking pleadingly towards him.}
<C>__{dr jaffe}
<P>__{(unsuave again)}
<D>__{now see here, chapman. at least mine don't look like they've been mugged.}
<A>__{through the grey prisoners pushes mrs terrain.}
<C>__{mrs terrain}
<P>__{(calls)}
<D>__{sam!}
<A>__{sam turns around to see her pushing through the party guests. mrs terrain is limping and is even more heavily swathed in bandages than the last time. dr chapman hastily moves away as mrs terrain comes up. she claims sam, taking his arm.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(looking at her worriedly)}
<D>__{whatever happened to you?}
<C>__{mrs terrain}
<D>__{there was a slight complication. dr. chapman says it often happens with a delicate skin like mine. nothing to worry about. he's promised me i will have these bandages off in a ...}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(trying to disengage)}
<D>__{actually, there's someone i want to meet ...}
<C>__{mrs terrain}
<P>__{(roguishly)}
<D>__{i know, i know ...!}
<A>__{she drags sam through the party and we arrive at her daughter, shirley, who is, of course, a wallflower.}
<C>__{mrs terrain}
<D>__{here we are! i'm going to leave you two lovebirds in peace.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i ... uh ...}
<A>__{but he is alone with shirley, standing at the entrance to his mother's embarrassingly rampant boudoir style bedroom. in amongst the diaphanous curtains enclosing the bed mother is playing hide and seek with a young stud.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{can i get you a drink, shirley?}
<A>__{shirley looks at him terrified.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{look ... shirley ... your mother ... and my mother ... they seem to have got the idea ... i mean, i'm terribly flattered, of course, but, um, the thing is, i don't want you to be under any false ...}
<C>__{shirley}
<D>__{{struggling into speech}
<P>__{shyly)}
<D>__{it's ... it's ... all right ... i don't like you either ...}
<A>__{this isn't what sam expected. he smiles weakly at her.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{sam!}
<A>__{sam turns round, to see jack lint a few paces away.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{hello, jack!}
<C>__{jack}

<D>__{she doesn't like me telling anyone but she's pleased as anything really.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{er, i knew you looked different.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{remember how they used to stick out?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what? oh, yes vividly. i used to wonder if they were real.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{what, my ears?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{your ears?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{dr. jaffe has pinned her ears back.}
<C>__{sam}

<D>__{quite, absolutely i always thought they were false.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(looking past sam)}
<D>__{mr helpmann!}
<A>__{sam spins round and sees a very pleasant looking distinguished old man moving in their direction. he is in a wheelchair.}
