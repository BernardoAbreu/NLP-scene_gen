<L>__{exterior shorehaven pool day (1942 43)}
<A>__{the shorehaven pool, spic and span in the summer sun is the closest thing to a country club in the bronx. an eight foot fence stands between the pool and the street. jake, wearing slacks and a sportshirt, hangs out with the "boys" near the bar area. older, "made" men play cards. a young fan walks by and says:}
<C>__{fan}
<D>__{hey, jake.}
<A>__{at the opposite end of the pool where the girls gossip, and sunbathe, joey swaps small talk with vickie, a school girl, about 15. vickie is a knockout. salvy, frankie and junior are with vickie and her friends. they joke with joey. jake watches salvy and vickie. jake's p.o.v.: joey is talking (pan) to vickie. vickie giggles. joey stands and walks over to jake.}
