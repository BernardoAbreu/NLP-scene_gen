<L>__{interior mills' apartment, living room night}
<A>__{mills sits down at his desk. he starts looking through police paperwork. the radio in the other room goes off in mid song. insert title card}
<B>__{tuesday}
<L>__{interior autopsy room early morning}
<A>__{the room is cold, clean. stainless steel. white tile. many pathologists work at slabs. mills and somerset are with doctor santiago, 35, who stands over the mostly dissected obese corpse.}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{if you take a look here, buddies... i can tell you, it was not a poison. if you can see... i have emptied all of everything out of the stomach. but, look at it, now that i took away the liver.}
<A>__{santiago reaches into the belly of the cavernous corpse. mills moves closer beside somerset, but not too close, trying to hide his disgust. we hear squashy sounds as santiago works, but we don't see in.}
<C>__{santiago }
<D>__{i move the lungs over. first, see how big this fat son of a bitch stomach is. now... here is the strange thing, on the stomach. stretches.}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{and, here is it distended. look at the size of that, because of the foods.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{i can see what you're pointing at...}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{on the stomach. the lines of distention.}
<A>__{somerset's looking in, not believing what he sees.}
<C>__{somerset}
<D>__{doctor, are you saying this man... ate till he burst?}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{yes, well, he didn't actually burst. he was bleeding, inside of himself. and, there's a hemotoma on the outside... on the belly.}
<A>__{somerset walks around the slab, looking the body over.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{he died by eating?}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{someone punched him, or kicked him.}
<A>__{somerset notices something on the partially shaved head. he leans close to look at five or six small bruises on the back of the dead man's head; circular bruises, some darker than others, all about the same diameter as a dime.}
<C>__{santiago }
<D>__{oh, and there is this here... something else you have to look at and see.}
<A>__{somerset stands straight, realizes something about the bruises.}
<C>__{santiago }
<D>__{most of his stomach contents are in the lab now... but, this. i found these in the fat man's stomach.}
<A>__{santiago looks amongst tools, buckets and jars of liquid. he picks up a glass jar and shows it to mills. in the jar: many little bits of blue plastic. like scrapings.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{plastic?}
<A>__{mills gets somerset's attention, hands him the jar. somerset looks at it a long time.}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{why these were in a fat man's stomach, i don't know.}
