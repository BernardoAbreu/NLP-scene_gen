<L>__{interior hypersleep vault}
<A>__{lit up, white and sterile. the canopies of the row of capsules are raised. ripley sits up. rubs her arms briskly. next to her gorman and burke are stirring and beyond them the troopers, wearing shorts and dog tags. they are:}

<D>__{arrgh. i'm getting too old for this shit.}
<A>__{spunkmeyer says this sincerely, though he must have enlisted underage not long ago. looking surly, drake sits up. he's young as well but street tough. nasty scar curling his lip into a sneer.}

<C>__{dietrich}
<D>__{not enough to have to wake up to your face, drake.}
<C>__{drake}
<D>__{suck air. hey, hicks...you look like i feel.}
<A>__{hicks, an older lifer type who keeps his own counsel, just snorts good naturedly. ripley scans the group as they shuffle past her to a bank of lockers. though not supermen they are lean and hardened...tough, capable, jaded. they combine the specialized techno combat training of the twenty first century fighting man with those qualities universal to "grunts" through the ages. sergeant apone moves down the row of freezers.}

<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{would you, sir?}
<A>__{ripley steps back as the troopers shuffle past nodding cursory hellos. she feels isolated by the camaraderie of this tightknit group. vasquez eyes her coldly as she passes. like drake, vasquez is younger then the rest and her combat primer was the street in a los angeles barrio. she is tough even by the standards of this group. hard muscled. eyes cunning and mean.}

<D>__{hey, vasquez...you ever been mistaken for a man?}
<C>__{vasquez}
<D>__{no. have you?}
<A>__{she slaps drake's open palm and it clenches into a greeting which is part contest. it gets rougher. painful. until she cuffs him hard and they break with vicious laughter. dobermans playing. conscripted from juvenile prison, the two of them were trained to operate the formidable "smart guns." that is part of their bond. bishop is helping everyone like a valet. as he passes close to her ripley notices a strange tattoo across the back of his left hand...an alpha numeric code.}
