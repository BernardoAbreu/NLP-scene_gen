<A>__{he steps out onto the fourth floor. he looks. there are merely empty corridors. he takes out his scrap of paper; checks it. "room 4a." now he hurries, trying to follow the code of hospital rooms; following the right arrows, quicker and quicker they flash by him. now he stops, looks up "4a corleone". there is a special card table set up there with some magazines...and some smoking cigarettes still in the ashtray but no detectives, no police, no bodyguards.}
