<A>__{buffy sits fidgeting. playing with her fingernails. merrick stays in the position, listening. a low, almost inaudible moan come from under the ground. buffy sits up straight, holds the cross to her. the moan becomes louder, almost a scream. the sound is followed by the sound of fingers scrapping wood of wood splintering of digging. the moaning continues, becoming eerier, somewhat more articulate. buffy and merrick wait. angle the grave finally, fingers break through the ground and hold stiff in the open air. the moan becomes a triumphant hiss. the fingers clutch at the ground. robert berman pops halfway out of his grave like a jack in the box, his face dirty and dead white. he sees buffy in front of him, and he bobs toward her with a crazy grin, stretching as to a mother's tit. merrick drops down behind robert and grabs him, raising the stake. buffy watches, immobilized. a pair of arms shoot up from the ground right under buffy. they grab her and pull her to the ground. next to her face, the face of another vampire, a young woman, emerges grinning from the crumbling earth. buffy screams lustily, and struggles to break free. merrick is momentarily distracted by this, and robert throws him off, and pulls himself out of the grave. merrick falls to the ground, and his stake goes flying. buffy pulls herself out of the girl's grasp, starts running away, but the girl grabs her. buffy remembers the cross in her hand, spins and holds it to the vampire's forehead. it burns and the lady lets go, screaming and falling to the ground.}
