<ACTION>__{Helium3 is a gas ejected from the surface of the sun and blown through space by solar winds. It plays an essential role in Cold Fusion, often toted as the solution to humanity's future energy needs. There is one major problem... Helium3 is extremely scarce on Earth. The gas does, however, exist in abundance on the Earth's only natural satellite: The Moon. Should we turn to Cold Fusion in the future, it is conceivable that man will mine the Moon for Helium3 and bring the precious gas back to Earth...}
