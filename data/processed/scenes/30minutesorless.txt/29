<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{blurry vision coming into focus. two gorillas.}
<L>__{exterior radio tower day}
<A>__{whereas the masks looked scary at night, they look ridiculous now. will is propped up on the hood of his car, staring at his captors. his mouth is duct taped, hands bound behind his back. he wears his "giorgio's" cap and a buttoned up olive green army jacket.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{you thought we were gonna rape you.}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{idiot.}
<A>__{will mumbles something through the duct tape.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{just shut up. the tape is there for a reason. 'cause this next part is gonna take a measure of calm. are you with me? can you be calm?}
<A>__{will nods. dwayne holds up his driver license.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{will dixon, of 112 north whatever the fuck street, right now you are wearing an explosive vest.}
<A>__{will looks down at the jacket he is wearing, tries to get his hands loose so he can tear it open.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{calm the fuck down!}
<A>__{will stiffens. for emphasis, dwayne reveals the gun tucked down the front of his pants like a big metal cock.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{now stay still and my associate will show you.}
<A>__{jay carefully unbuttons the army jacket. will is, in fact, wearing an explosive vest. it is a cobbled together but intimidating looking contraption, crisscrossed by multicolored wires. there is a thick lock at the hinge, with a digital display and a keypad. will begins to hyperventilate.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{take it easy, man. you're fine. i built this thing. it's pretty stable.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{for a fucking bomb. so don't trip over your shoelaces or anything. that thing's full of c 4. and the c is for chaos.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{actually, the c stands for "composite." but, yeah, i'd try not to slam into stuff.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{can i take that tape off now, pizza boy?}
<A>__{will nods. dwayne rips the duct tape off his mouth.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{help!}
<A>__{dwayne chuckles.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{you know where you are? you might as well be in space, motherfucker. nobody can hear you scream.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{why are you doing this to me? i don't have any money.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{not yet. but you're gonna go get us some.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{okay. sure, man. whatever you say. i will go sell my car. i will get you like a thousand bucks.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{i want 100 thousand.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{where the fuck am i supposed to get that much money?}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{the donner wells national bank on charles road.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{across the street from the olive garden.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{yeah, the one across the street from the olive garden.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{do you guys have an account or something?}
<A>__{dwayne shakes his head like will is an idiot.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{no, i don't have an account! you're gonna rob it!}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{how the fuck am i supposed to rob a bank?}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{figure it out. you got a bomb strapped to your chest. that's a start. it'll scare the fuck outta people. maybe use your brain and go get a gun. borrow one from a friend for all i care. it ain't rocket science.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{then do it yourself.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{i would, but i'm already wearing this gorilla mask and you're already wearing that bomb.}
<P>__{(to jay)}
<D>__{tell him about the vest.}
<A>__{jay turns to will.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{you seem like a pretty trustworthy guy. i mean, you got a job and all. but just in case you were gonna try to take the vest off, we booby trapped it to shit. there's also a remote detonator on the back, so we can trigger it by dialing a number.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{and it's on speed dial. so do what you gotta do, but we'll be watching.}
<C>__{dwayne }
<D>__{you go anywhere near a police station, and fourth of july comes early this year.}
<A>__{dwayne nods at the timer on the side of the vest.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{it's 9:00 am. you got 8 hours.}
<A>__{he hands will a slip of paper.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{once you have the money, call this number and you'll be given instructions on where to drop it. you do good, we give you the six digit combination that stops the timer and opens the lock. tomorrow morning, you can go back to delivering pizza, the mail, whatever the fuck you want.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now let me demonstrate what happens if you don't get us the money.}
<A>__{dwayne looks over to where an oversized stuffed bear, rigged with its own bomb vest, sits on a tree stump 20 yards away. dwayne mimes answering a phone }
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{hey, teddy ruxpin...what's that? you don't have the money? it was too tough to rob the bank, so you just went back to your bear cave and cried like a bitch? well, guess what my stuffed friend...time is up.}
<A>__{jay pushes a button on a detonator. teddy ruxpin explodes. all that remains is a cloud of stuffing. will is frozen in fear.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{i liked that bear. i don't even know you.}
<A>__{dwayne throws will his car keys.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{go on. get outta here.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{guys, can we please just talk about this?}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{yeah, of course we can.}
<A>__{dwayne pulls out the gun and fires two shots at will's feet. jay jumps backward, as does will, who hits the hood of his car, slides across it and onto the ground by the driver side.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{be careful!}
<A>__{will awkwardly gets to his feet and arranges himself in the car, adjusting to the weight of the bomb. as he starts the engine and backs away }
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{that's right! get the fuck out of here! you're wasting time!}
<A>__{once the car is gone, jay yanks off his gorilla mask. dwayne stays primate.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{what the hell, dwayne? you told me that was a replica gun.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{it was. then i paid a mexican 50 bucks to put a firing pin in it. now it goes boom.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{we didn't discuss a loaded gun! especially not with the bomb around!}
<A>__{dwayne gets right in jay's face. the plastic eyes of his mask betray no emotion.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{don't you ever question me. i'm fucking this bitch. you're just holding the camera.}
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(voice falters)}
<D>__{sure, dwayne...whatever you say.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{good. 'cause this ain't the marines. this is cash money. you hesitate, you fuck up...and i will leave you behind.}
<A>__{a tense beat. dwayne pulls his mask off. he looks oddly calm.}
<C>__{dwayne}
<D>__{let's go get some breakfast.}
