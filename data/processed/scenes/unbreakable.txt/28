<L>__{interior back of church afternoon}
<A>__{david and the priest who conducted the mass are alone in the mass preparation room. the priest looks in his fifties, eyes tired, blood shot.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i used to play football in college. in my first year as quarterback, we went on this winning streak. it just went on and on. it didn't matter who we played... i'd always win.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you get superstitious when something like that happens. you give things meaning. like you wear the same color socks each game or you listen to the same b.b. king song before you leave the apartment. i wouldn't even untie the shoelaces on my cleats. i'd just slip them on and off so nothing would change... i gave things meaning that had no meaning.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm here to make sure i'm not making shoelaces into something they're not again.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i was the only person to survive that accident. the only one... it feels like it means something.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{are you a religious man, david?}
<A>__{david nods, "no." the priest removes the sacred stoll from his around his neck and kisses it before folding it carefully.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{good. because i'm going to talk to you as a man. not as a man of the cloth.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{beat. the priest turns to david.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{it was luck.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{luck... random... without meaning.}
<A>__{david just sits awkwardly.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{three years ago, my cousin died on a plane that crashed on take off at philadelphia international airport. do you remember that crash?}
<A>__{david nods, "yes."}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{i prayed and prayed and finally found some meaning in the event. it gave me peace... and then not quite a year later, an entire family from my parish burned to death in a hotel fire downtown...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{again i prayed. again i found meaning.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{just two days ago, my nephew rode with you on that train back from new york. he was traveling alone for the first time.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{i'm sorry if i can't react to your survival with the appropriate 'it was the hand of god. it was a miracle.' kind of answer... i'm fresh out of those right now.}
<A>__{david is shaken. beat.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{the metal of the watch i was wearing was crushed like a sledge hammer hit it.}
<A>__{beat. the priest's eyes fill with emotion.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{my twelve year old nephew's neck was broken in four places... what's your point? you were chosen?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<A>__{the priest turns and continues putting away artifacts from the mass. silence fills the back room.}
