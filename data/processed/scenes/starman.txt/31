<A>__{the sound of a powerful slow speed drill greets bell and shermin as they enter. the extraterrestrial is still on its back with its helmet lights shining straight up. a hose that extends from a portable gas chromatograph has been suction sealed to a corner of the faceplate. a scientist is making adjustments at the chromatograph while his companion is monitoring the progress of the drill into the faceplate. both are wearing contamination suits. a foam lined coffin shaped metal box is on the ground next to one of the walls. bell and shermin approach the body. shermin's first look is at the faceplate, but all he can see is his own reflection. his eyes travel down the body.}

<D>__{look at the hands.}
<A>__{the gloved hands of the figure have only three fingers and a thumb. shermin takes bell's flashlight. he angles it at the faceplate. as he leans in to follow the beam, the pitch of the drill rises. he shifts the light. the drill breaks through and the faceplate explodes out of the helmet. the men throw themselves back in panic. when they turn back to look, distorted impressions of the face inside the helmet reflect on the glass of their contamination hoods.

<D>__{we better get it into the box. come on...}
<A>__{the other men approach the body but before they can bend to it a burst of percussive language, followed by a low buzz, comes from inside the extraterrestrial's helmet. the men freeze. there is another burst of percussive language and a projection beam shoots out of the helmet throwing the image of the escaped star man onto one of the scientists. he jumps aside and the beam falls out of focus and indistinct on the tent wall behind him.}
