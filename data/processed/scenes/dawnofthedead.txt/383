<A>__{roger clicks off the radio. they listen. they hear slight sounds coming from the fire stairs. the end of the room with the barricade of cartons looks surreal in the blue glow of the tv screen which still shines. roger crawls over and clicks the tv off as well. the electronic whistle slowly dies. silence. steve steps out from behind the wall of cartons. fran peers around the corner to look, but she still sits on the floor. another noise. the faint squeaking of the door to the bottom of the steps. then footsteps on the metal stairs. slow... lumbering. the faces of the humans all tighten. peter and roger pull their rifles. roger makes his ready. some thumping in the hall. steve squats down and holds fran. the sounds are closer now. the door behind the cartons clicks but does not move. more pounding... then silence. after a time, the footsteps recede down the stairs.}
