<D>__{... i will take her to a small restaurant... we'll have lobster and drink lots of wine... i will get her drunk... we'll drive home... i will carry her inside... i will kiss her... and then, i will screw her in my bed...}
<A>__{the suburban pulls up next to a house. there are armed guerrilla guards outside.}
<C>__{felix}
<D>__{... and when i am done screwing her, she'll never want to look at another man again...}
<A>__{gordy drives past the house as the beaten man and the guerrilla with him get out of the suburban and start carrying the beer inside. and a moment later... felix comes around with a start.}
<C>__{felix}
<D>__{what the fuck are you doing?!}
<A>__{he unholsters the 9mm and points it at gordy.}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{hey, easy... what's the problem?}
<C>__{felix}
<D>__{you're going the wrong goddamn way!}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{i am?... looks different in the dark...}
<C>__{felix}
<D>__{turn around!}
<A>__{gordy turns the car around. felix keeps the gun on him.}
<C>__{felix}
<D>__{you drive where i say... or the supervisor will have us both shot.}
<A>__{gordy drives back. they approach the suburban and the house once more. this time it's on felix' side. felix gives the guerrilla guards a wave as they go by, and... gordy's eyes go to something he couldn't see coming the other way: a large propane tank next to the house.}
