<C>__{margie}
<D>__{hey over here, lover.}
<A>__{bud stops in his tracks, suddenly aware of her.}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{what's all this running around? you're going to wear yourself out.}
<A>__{bud strides over to her purposefully, yanks her up to her feet.}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{not so rough, honey.}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(taking the glass out of her hand)}
<D>__{good night.}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{good night?}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(thrusting the fur coat at her)}
<D>__{the party's over.}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{what's the matter? did i do something wrong?}
<C>__{bud}
<P>__{(easing her toward door)}
<D>__{it's an emergency see you some other time.}
<A>__{dr. dreyfuss comes hurrying in, carrying his medical bag. he stops, bewildered by the sound of music and the sight of a wide awake girl in the apartment.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{not this one }
<P>__{(pointing to the bedroom)}
<D>__{ in there, doc.}
<A>__{dr. dreyfuss proceeds into the bedroom.}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{say, what's going on here, anyway?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{nothing.}
<P>__{(propelling her toward the door)}
<D>__{just clear out, will you?}
<C>__{margie}
<P>__{(pointing back)}
<D>__{my shoes.}
<A>__{bud reaches under the coffee table, where she left her shoes, retrieves them.}
<C>__{margie}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{some lover you are. some sexpot!}
<A>__{bud shoves the shoes at her, takes a bill out of his wallet, hands it to her.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{here find yourself a phone booth and call your husband in havana.}
<C>__{margie}
<D>__{you bet i will. and when i tell him how you treated me, he'll push your face in.}
<P>__{(he shoves her through the open door)}
<D>__{you fink!}
<A>__{bud slams the door shut, starts toward the bedroom. halfway there, he becomes aware that the cha cha record is still on. he detours to the phonograph, switches it off, continues into the bedroom. in the bedroom, the overhead light is on, and dr. dreyfuss is working on the unconscious fran. he has removed her coat, and is shining a flashlight into her eyes, examining her pupils. bud approaches the bed worriedly.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{she going to be all right, doc?}
<C>__{dr. dreyfuss}
<D>__{how many pills were in that bottle?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{it was half full about a dozen or so. you going to have to take her to the hospital?}
<A>__{dr. dreyfuss ignores him. out of his medical bag, he takes a stomach tube with a rubber funnel at the end. then he starts to lift fran off the bed.}
<C>__{dr. dreyfuss}
<D>__{help me, will you?}
<A>__{between them, they get fran into an upright position.}
<C>__{dr. dreyfuss}
<D>__{into the bathroom.}
<A>__{they half carry, half drag fran's limp form toward the bathroom.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{what are you going to do, doc?}
<C>__{dr. dreyfuss}
<D>__{get that stuff out of her stomach if it isn't too late. you better put some coffee on and pray.}
<A>__{bud starts away as dr. dreyfuss takes fran into the bathroom. bud loses no time getting into the kitchen. he fills an aluminum kettle with water, strikes a match, lights the gas burner, puts the kettle on. then he takes a jar of instant coffee and a chipped coffee mug out of the cupboard, shakes an excessive portion of coffee into the mug, sticks a spoon in it. he watches the kettle for a moment, mops his brow with a handkerchief, then starts back toward the bedroom. bud crosses the bedroom to the half open door of the bathroom, looks in anxiously. from inside come the sounds of a coughing spasm and running water. bud turns away, undoes his tie and collar, paces the bedroom floor. something on the night table attracts his attention resting against the base of the lamp is a sealed envelope. bud picks it up on it, in fran's handwriting, is one word, jeff. he turns the letter over in his hand, trying to decide what to do with it. dr. dreyfuss emerges from the bathroom, carrying a pale, still unconscious fran. bud quickly conceals the suicide note behind his back.}
<C>__{dr. dreyfuss}
<D>__{bring my bag.}
<A>__{he lugs fran into the living room. bud stashes the letter in his back pocket, picks up the medical bag, follows them. in the living room, dr. dreyfuss lowers fran into a chair. her chin falls to her chest. dreyfuss takes the bag from bud, fishes out a hypodermic syringe, draws 2 c.c.'s from a bottle of picrotoxin.}
<C>__{dr. dreyfuss}
<D>__{roll up her right sleeve.}
<A>__{bud does so. dr. dreyfuss hands the hypodermic to bud, searches for a spot for the injection.}
<C>__{dr. dreyfuss}
<D>__{nice veins.}
<A>__{he swabs the spot with alcohol, takes the hypodermic back from bud.}
<C>__{dr. dreyfuss}
<D>__{want to tell me what happened?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{i don't know i mean i wasn't here you see we had some words earlier nothing serious, really what you might call a lovers' quarrel }
<C>__{dr. dreyfuss}
<P>__{(making off scene injection)}
<D>__{so you went right out and picked yourself up another dame.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{something like that.}
<C>__{dr. dreyfuss}
<D>__{you know, baxter, you're a real cutie pie yes, you are.}
<A>__{bud just stands there, taking it. fran stirs slightly, and from her parched lips comes a low moan. dr. dreyfuss grabs her by the hair, lifts her head up.}
<C>__{dr. dreyfuss}
<D>__{if you'd come home half an hour later, you would have had quite a christmas present.}
<A>__{with his free hand, dr. dreyfuss slaps fran viciously across the face. bud winces. dreyfuss, still holding fran by the hair, takes a box of ammonia ampules out of his bag. he crushes one of the ampules in his hand, passes it under her nose. fran tries to turn her head away. dreyfuss slaps her again, hard, crushes another ampule, repeats the process. bud is watching tensely. from the kitchen comes the whistle of the boiling kettle, but bud pays no attention.}
<C>__{dr. dreyfuss}
<D>__{get the coffee.}
<A>__{bud hurries into the kitchen. he turns off the gas, pours the boiling water into the mug with the instant coffee, stirs it. from off, come the sounds of more slapping and some moaning. bud carries the coffee out. in the living room, dr. dreyfuss is working another ammonia ampule under fran's nose. her eyes start fluttering. dreyfuss takes the coffee mug from bud, forces it between fran's lips, pours coffee into her mouth. fran resists instinctively, half the coffee dribbling over her chin and dress, but dr. dreyfuss keeps at it.}
<C>__{dr. dreyfuss}
<D>__{let's get some air in here. open the windows.}
<A>__{bud complies promptly pulls up the shades, opens the windows wide.}
<C>__{dr. dreyfuss}
