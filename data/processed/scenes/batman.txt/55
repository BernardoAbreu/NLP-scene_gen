<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{loud music. kids in punk regalia stand outside a rock club as jack stalks past. the wind knocks his hat off.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{nice hair, dude!}
<A>__{jack ignores them as he bends to retrieve his hat. then he gazes up at the steel and glass facade of a skyscraper and strides deliberately across the street.}
<L>__{interior grissom's penthouse night}
<A>__{the spectacular gotham skyline, seen through the plate glass window of grissom's conference room. the doors to the private elevator hiss open and jack wanders in. he plops in the big plush swivel chair behind grissom's desk.}
<C>__{grissom }
<D>__{that you, sugar bumps?}
<A>__{grissom waddles in unsuspectingly from the adjoining room. he's fresh out of the shower, a towel wrapped around his impressive girth. he's using a smaller towel to dry his hair, and so it's a moment before he sees the bundled up figure at his desk.}
<C>__{grissom }
<D>__{who the hell are you?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's me. "sugar bumps."}
<C>__{grissom}
<P>__{(recognizing his voice)}
<D>__{jack?}
<P>__{(advancing cautiously)}
<D>__{thank god. i can't believe it's you. i heard you'd been }
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(standing up)}
<D>__{is that what you "heard"?}
<A>__{jack gestures him over to the empty chair. grissom doesn't move until he sees the gun pointed at his belly.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{you set me up!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{over a girl. you must be insane!}
<A>__{grissom surreptitiously reaches for a desk drawer.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{keep your hands on the desk.}
<C>__{grissom}
<D>__{sooner or later you would've tried to take me, jack. you may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i've died once already. it wasn't so bad. in fact i recommend it.}
<A>__{grissom is beginning to panic now. it's obvious that jack is utterly, hopelessly deranged.}
<C>__{grissom}
<D>__{jack, listen we'll cut a deal }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{jack? jack? do i look like a jack??}
<A>__{and now, for the first time, he flings away the hat. rips the muffler from his face. and as grissom gasps in shock stands revealed in his full horrendous glory. his flesh is bleached bone white. his hair is a luminous seaweed green. and his cheeks are torn and puckered from the bullet wound, twisting his mouth into a hideous, perpetual harlequin's grin.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{i'm not a jack any more.}
<P>__{(pause; cackling)}
<D>__{you made me a joker!}
<A>__{the cackle builds into furious, hysterical laughter. grissom, revulsed, terrified, pushes himself away from the desk, back toward the window which overlooks the city.}
<C>__{grissom}
<D>__{jack i'm warning you. wipe that lunatic grin off your face.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{ha! that's the best part. i can't!!}
<A>__{and with that jack pulls the trigger. and fires. and fires again until the clip is empty.}
