<A>__{he is walking along the side, watching the floor, a drink in his hand. the song ends and it seques right into the stones's "miss you." he sees her. her black leather jacket is off. she wears a very tight, flimsy top, the short skirt, the heels. she is dancing with roxy and the black guy. he watches her move... watches her body. she turns, sees him, dances, watches him... gets between roxy and the black guy... they sandwich her with their bodies... keeps moving, turning... eyes on him... playing to him with her body. he watches. a long beat, and he goes up to them. his movements are almost trance like. they look at each other. a long beat. catherine stops dancing. he reaches for her. she moves away. a beat their eyes are on each other. she moves a step towards her. a beat, as they look at each other... and they start to move together. their eyes are on each other as they move, the eyes burning... the movements tighter, hotter... and he suddenly grabs her and kisses her... as they keep moving... the song seques into the stones's "gimme shelter." she is melting into him now, kissing him... tex watches, expressionless... the black guy is gone... he holds her by the back of the neck, kissing her... their bodies pressed into each other... his hands are on her butt now, pulling her into him now, almost holding her up now... and then under her skirt, under her panties... as he kisses her neck. people around them stare... he moves his hands under her top as she keeps moving with the song, her head back, her back almost arching... cups her breasts now... she keeps moving... the song sweeping them into its rhythm "it's just a shot away, it's just a kiss away, a kiss away..." they devour each other. right there on the floor. barely able to hold it back. as tex watches expressionless. as people stop dancing and stare.}
