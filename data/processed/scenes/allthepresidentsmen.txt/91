<D>__{papers glancing at}
<P>__{the top bill)}
<D>__{i suggest you either pay this immediately or lay in a large supply of candles.}
<P>__{(studies another bill)}
<D>__{you'd give a stranger the shirt off your back except it wouldn't be paid for.}
<A>__{he smiles, gently begins massaging her shoulders as she studies his finances.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{hey... very tense.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{lot of pressure at the star.}
<P>__{(looking at the bills)}
<D>__{carl, when we got married, you were four thousand dollars in debt; when we split, you were solvent. that may prove to be the outstanding single achievement of my life, and now look at this.}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{how much did the damn bike cost?}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{five hundred; six maybe.}

<D>__{i think.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{give me your checkbook then.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{it's right under that pile.}
<A>__{he indicates a mound of papers. she pulls it out as he continues to massage her, more sensually now. she reaches back, puts her hand on his.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{i thought you had to get to miami.}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{there's always a later plane.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{you're a sex junkie, you know that, carl?}
<C>__{bernstein}
<D>__{nobody's perfect.}
<P>__{(more rubbing now)}
<D>__{i'm glad you're out of it, hannah you're a terrific reporter and i turned you into a bookkeeper.}
<A>__{hannah looks at bernstein a moment; then she smiles gently, shakes her head.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{aw baby, you can get it up... i just wonder if you'll ever be able to get it together.}
<A>__{and quickly from that }
