<A>__{a vending machine stands in silence. the eerie strobing glow of defective neon. pull back as... ishmael thinks it over. drops in his dime. pulls the plunger, to watch a snickers fall. scoops the candy from the tray, pins it between his body and the machine. ...tears the wrapper.}
<L>__{interior courthouse corridor}
<A>__{back to the reporters. the crowd of onlookers has grown.}
<D>__{reporter #3 ...can we get some background on your handsome family? i understand you two were childhood sweethearts...}
<A>__{and brings his parker pen to his notepad. his subject smiles easily...}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{well, no sir, not exactly. we met in the manzanar camp, you see, so i guess that was the most beautiful place i've ever been.}
<A>__{there is gentle laughter. and as kabuo looks up, he sees something in the rear of the crowd. something we do not. and softly...}
<C>__{kabuo}
<D>__{no, her first love was another fella...}
<A>__{which brings hatsue's eyes up, following his gaze. and there, in the back. a man watches. eating a candy bar.}
<C>__{kabuo }
<D>__{i was the lucky one.}
<A>__{no one sees their eyes lock. it is only an instant. it is enough.}
<D>__{reporter #4 it all sounds very romantic, ma'am. falling in love under those circumstances...}
<A>__{and as she looks to the reporter, ishmael begins to walk away...}
<C>__{hatsue}
<D>__{he went off to the army, right from manzanar. and that last night, we danced alone in the desert...}
<A>__{and somehow, ishmael catches the eye of hatsue's 4 year old daughter. so he pulls a coin from his pocket...}
<C>__{hatsue }
<D>__{i told him. if you don't come back alive, i will kill you.}
<A>__{...ishmael rolls the coin across his knuckles. and the child responds... with her mother's smile.}
