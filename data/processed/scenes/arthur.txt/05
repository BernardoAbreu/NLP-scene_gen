<L>__{exterior club night}
<A>__{the car pulls up outside a very rough looking dive club. out falls arthur, laughing his head off, along with champagne bottles, footballs and rich boy's toys. following him are his crook friends, the jogger, two middle aged tourists and a dancing man in a leotard twirling a big sign reading `cheap apartment rentals!' like the pied piper, arthur leads his disciples into the bar.}
