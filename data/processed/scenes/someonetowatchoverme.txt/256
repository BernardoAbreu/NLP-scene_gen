<L>__{interior milton gregory banquet hall evening}
<A>__{overhead, chandeliers gleam. a small orchestra comprised of students of the school plays a variety of tunes. mirrors reflect a profusion of flowers, carved gilt and candlelight. gloved service personnel wait to be of service at the sides. the room is quite large yet intimate. the tables set perfectly. guests continue to move toward their places engaged in animated chatter. another angle: claire moving through the crowd, plainclothesmen flanking her as anonymously as possible (koontz among them), her eyes anxious, scanning the crowd. she's spotted by the principal of the school (giddings), who approaches, surprised to see her.}
<C>__{giddings}
<D>__{hello, claire. how extraordinary that you came.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{it was something my father always liked me to do.}
<C>__{giddings}

<D>__{you're planning to speak?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{not if you don't want me to.}

<P>__{(a brief hesitation)}
<D>__{well, of course, we'd be... honored...}
<C>__{claire}
<P>__{(understands; gamely)}
<D>__{just putting in an appearance then.}
<A>__{she glances around, her "escorts" mistaking it for anxiety, one of them taking her arm and escorting her in.}
