<L>__{exterior road night}
<A>__{headlights swing into view around a curve in the road.}
<L>__{interior truck same}
<A>__{a brawny driver squints at the road ahead. a hawk faced gunman rides shotgun. the railroad grading looms into view. the warning signal flashing and clanging.}
<B>__{outside the truck}
<A>__{as the gunman, shotgun in hand, moves cautiously up the grading, his breath blowing white in he cold. he slips on the ice that has formed. the blast of his gun echoes through the night. he waves sheepishly to the driver.}

<A>__{the driver shouts to the men in the back of the truck.}
<C>__{driver}
<P>__{(in italian)}
<D>__{it was only an accident!}
<B>__{in the woods}
<A>__{costello and luciano struggle to topple a tree. unable to do so, they pick up their axes and slash desperately at the trunk.}
<B>__{shooting through the truck windshield}
<A>__{the gunman limps toward the truck, rubbing his ass. another blast shatters the night, and the gunman's chest explodes, splattering his guts across the windshield. as he falls, we see siegel, a wool scarf wrapped across his face, scramble up from the ditch at the side of the road, his shotgun smoking.}
<B>__{the panicked driver}
<A>__{slams the truck into gear, running over the body of the gunman.}

<A>__{where its rear wheels spin helplessly on the ice.}
<B>__{the driver sees siegel climb back out of the ditch}
<A>__{and calmly pull a pistol from his coat. he struggles to get the truck into reverse. as siegel levels his gun, the truck lurches backward, bumping sickeningly over the body of the gunman.}
<B>__{on luciano and costello}
<A>__{as they push mightily against the tree trunk. it cracks, and crashes across the road, cutting off the path of the truck.}
<B>__{lansky and luciano}
<A>__{scarves pulled across their faces, race toward the truck from opposite sides of the road. they beat their pistols on its sides, and order the men to throw their guns out.}
<B>__{siegel rips the top off a bag of rock salt}
<A>__{and pours the contents across the grade. he trots toward the front of the truck, his pistol leveled at the driver. costello also masked moves out of the woods toward the rear of the truck, as siegel roughly drags the driver around to the back of the truck. costello shoves his pistol under the driver's chin.}

<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(in italian)}
<D>__{throw out your guns and coats!}
<A>__{the guards comply, and step off the truck, hands raised over their heads. luciano, lansky, costello, and siegel surround them, all still masked, all with guns leveled. siegel pats the first guard down. he pulls an antique gold watch from the man's vest pocket. the guard grabs for siegel's hand.}
<C>__{first guard}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{luciano and lansky move in closer to bugsy.}
<C>__{luciano}
<D>__{forget it.}
<C>__{siegel}
<D>__{fuck 'em.}
<A>__{siegel jerks his hand away, gripping the watch in his fist beside his face. the guard grabs at the watch, catching bugsy's scarf, and pulling it from his face.}
<B>__{siegel}
<A>__{knocks the guard to the ground, beating him viciously with his pistol. as the guard begs for mercy, siegel slams the barrel of his pistol into the guard's mouth, and fires. siegel stands up and looks to the second guard.}
<B>__{truck horn blasts}
<A>__{a pair of headlight beams swing across the scene, as a second truck, identical to the first, screeches to a halt just short of the fallen tree. the second guard makes a run, but siegel cuts him down.}

<A>__{and dives into the foliage of the fallen tree.}
<B>__{gunmen}
<A>__{pour out of the second truck and open fire. shots ring out from both sides, with the driver caught in the middle.}

<B>__{on the roof of the second truck}
<A>__{a gunman draws a bead on siegel as he advances on the tree. as if by instinct, siegel looks up at the gunman on the roof and blasts him away. tossing the pistol aside, he pulls another from his coat. as the truck roars to life costello and lansky climb into the back, shouting for siegel to join them.}
<B>__{siegel continues to blast away}
<A>__{at the fallen tree, when another gunman jumps out from behind the truck, and wings bugsy on the right hand.}
<B>__{bugsy retreats to the departing truck}
<A>__{looking back as meyer and frank pull him aboard. the driver crawls out of the branches of the fallen tree, and on toward the second truck.}
<B>__{outside the truck}
