<L>__{interior ronnie's house bathroom night}
<A>__{ronnie's mom takes a bath and swigs on a bottle. she's drunk and passing out in the tub. ronnie scrubs her back with a sponge.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i'm telling you, mom, this police thing could be good for both of us. not just the fact that i will be making the streets safer for you, but they have health insurance and a pension plan so i don't have to worry about your medical bills as much.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{i don't care about that bullshit. all i need is a little nip of this good shit right here and i'm ready to walk through the pearly gates.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{mom, i know, but maybe you should stop drinking so much. you're getting up there and you know what the doctor said about your liver.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{i don't tell you how to party, don't tell me how to live my life. i've taken care of you since you were born.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i just worry about you is all.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{ronnie, don't get your hopes up about this police thing.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{why would you say that?}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{you know why. i just don't want to see you get hurt. it's my job to protect you from the bullshit.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{mom, i appreciate it, but i'm going to make it as a police officer. i'm tired of coming in second all the time. everybody in life gets to go for their goals, why should i be any different?}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{i know. just be careful is all. you've got a good heart and i don't want to see it broken.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{okay, mom. i hear you.}
<C>__{mom}
<D>__{and, ronnie, one more thing.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{what's that, mom?}
<A>__{in the tub, a bunch of bubbles plop to the surface.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{mom! that's gross!}
<C>__{mom}
<P>__{(drunk laughing)}
<D>__{that's right! now you got to smell it!}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{mom.}
