<D>__{the band plays various norteno songs. everyone waits for the music to start. after a while a couple starts to timidly dance. then another, and another, until the dance floor becomes a sway of heads moving to the same rhythm. amelia dances with mike and debbie with santiago; both amelia and santiago show them a few steps.}

<P>__{(to debbie, in spanish)}
<D>__{like this, look... he kicks his heel back, then forward. debbie watches, entertained. jacinto (55), overweight and with a good natured face, moves closer to amelia and watches her dance for a while, she notices and stops, embarrassed.}
<C>__{jacinto}
<P>__{(both in spanish)}
<D>__{amelia, will you let me dance with you? amelia remains unperturbed, without answering him.}
<C>__{jacinto }
<D>__{i've been asking you for a dance for 30 years. does it really cost you that much? amelia stares at him.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{i don't think your wife would have liked that.}
<C>__{jacinto}
<D>__{c'mon amelia, she's been dead for 10 years. amelia looks around and then turns to him.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{okay, just one. jacinto chivalrously takes her by the waist and they begin to dance. santiago watches them, amused, and continues to dance with mike and debbie. jacinto draws amelia closer and they kiss gently.}
