<D>__{tom, what do i do now?}
<A>__{the light is beginning to turn reddish as the sun falls.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history. i remember you talking about hitler back in '43. we were young then.}
<C>__{pentangeli}
<D>__{yeah, i still read a lot. they bring me stuff.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{you were around the old timers who dreamed up how the families should be organized, how they based it on the old roman legions, and called them 'regimes'... with the 'capos' and 'soldiers,' and it worked.}
<C>__{pentangeli}
<D>__{yeah, it worked. those were great old days. we was like the roman empire. the corleone family was like the roman empire.}
<C>__{hagen}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{yeah, it was once.}
<A>__{they both puff on their cigars. pentangeli lets himself be carried away by thoughts of old days of glory; hagen thinks of other days too.}
<C>__{hagen}
<P>__{(very gently)}
<D>__{the roman empire... when a plot against the emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes.}
<C>__{pentangeli}
<D>__{yeah, but only the rich guys. the little guys got knocked off. if they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the emperor. if they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{yeah, that was a good break. a nice deal.}
<A>__{pentangeli looks at hagen; he understands.}
<C>__{pentangeli}
<D>__{they went home and sat in a hot bath and opened their veins, and bled to death. sometimes they gave a little party before they did it.}
<A>__{hagen throws away his cigar. pentangeli puffs on his.}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{don't worry about anything, frankie five angels.}
<C>__{pentangeli}
<D>__{thanks, tom. thanks.}
<A>__{they shake hands. the fbi agents come out to let hagen out the gate. pentangeli is led back to the house.}
<D>__{fbi man #1 your lawyer tell you he can get that 600 years reduced to 500?}
<A>__{pentangeli puffs on his cigar and reflects.}
<C>__{pentangeli}
<D>__{you boys sure you can't get me a broad for tonight? give me a little party? fbi man #2 we got some nice books.}
<A>__{pentangeli puffs on his cigar and gives the agent a smile an old man gives a child. he starts upstairs.}
