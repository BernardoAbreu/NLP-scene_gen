<A>__{kelly comes out of the kitchen with a glass of water in pajama bottoms and a t shirt. the tv's on static. he sees a figure sleeping on the couch and starts to walk through the room. then he stops, sighs, and backtracks. he turns off the tv. then he sees the empty bottle of wine next to the couch.}
