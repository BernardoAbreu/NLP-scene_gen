<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior lassiter building corridor minutes later}
<A>__{jack and alan walking side by side down the hallway... employees passing them by, greeting mintz, mintz waving back...}
<C>__{alan}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{...thats our war room. we did seven major deals last year, three of them hostile.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(not particularly impressed)}
<D>__{seven. really.}
<A>__{they turn a corner, coming into a deserted section of the corridor. mintz stops, turning to jack. jack returns mintzs gaze with a quizzical look.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{lets cut the shit, huh campbell? what, did you go through his wallet or something?}
<A>__{jacks a little taken aback.}
<C>__{alan }
<D>__{no matter. that circus act back there may have dazzled lassiter momentarily but it doesnt do shit forme. even if you get this job, which i highly doubt, let me warn you, lassiter loses interest in his pet projects very quickly. im in the big office because ive proved myself to him year after year and nobody is going to come in here and start turning the old mans head. especially not some tire salesman from new jersey. so you watch yourself and stay away from lassiter, and maybe, just maybe, ill keep you on after he gets tired of you. do we understand each other?}
<A>__{jack stands there, staring at mintz, silent, expressionless.}
<C>__{alan }
<D>__{do we?!}
<A>__{then, a broad smile from jack.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{god, you really are different, arent you...}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{i mean...wow...i am impressed.}
<A>__{now its mintzs turn to look quizzical.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{good for you. why shouldnt you protect whats yours.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{i dont think youre hearing me.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, im hearing you, alan. thats not the problem. the problem is that what you think is yours, is really mine. and i dont care how low on the totem pole i start, i will get it back...}
<P>__{(poking him in the chest)}
<D>__{so do yourself a favor and dont get too attached to that view because sometime soon, maybe very soon, you and your french country antiques, your chintz sofa, and your little play pen are gonna be moving out of that office.}
<A>__{jack smiles at alan one more time, then turns...}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{oh, and by the way, you try selling tires for a living. i promise you, youd starve.}
<A>__{jack heads down the corridor, whistling a happy tune, leaving mintz standing there, bewildered. chapter fourteen a perfect life?}
