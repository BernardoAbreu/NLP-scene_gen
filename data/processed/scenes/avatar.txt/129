<L>__{interior commons hometree night}
<A>__{the central space is lit by a bonfire, around which the hunt festival is in full swing. wild dancing. people gnawing on massive sturmbeest ribs. a bowl of some kava like intoxicant is passed around. neytiri dances in a flowing costume as the banshee spirit. norm is dancing seductively with his own tail. jake, surrounded by young hunters, acts out the leonopteryx attack with his hands. the leaping fire light plays across the eye sockets of the toruk skull, bringing it to life. it seems to watch jake. tsu'tey squats next to jake, the usual scowl on his face. jake braces himself and tsu'tey holds up the kava bowl, offering it to him. a challenge or an olive branch? jake takes a long, hearty drink as some of the young hunters hoot and clap hands in a fast rhythm.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{watch that stuff. it'll knock you into next week.}
<A>__{jake offers the bowl back to tsu'tey. they lock eyes. tsu'tey drinks. later an empty bowl drops, landing on a pile of empty bowls near the fire. wider on jake and tsu'tey, sitting amid the rowdy hunters. tsu'tey looks a little blearily at jake. finally, he grins.}
<C>__{tsu'tey}
<D>__{i thought enough drink you would not be so ugly.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{tsu'tey looks deep into the fire.}

<D>__{your warriors hide inside machines fight from far away.}
<P>__{(he looks at jake)}
<D>__{i did not think a sky person could be brave.}
<A>__{before jake can answer, neytiri's lithe shape runs through the circle of silhouetted dancers toward them. she takes jake by the hand and pulls him up }
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{you must dance! it is the way.}
<A>__{tsu'tey watches as she leads him away, his face darkening the moment of connection to jake lost to anger. the hunters whoop and cheer as jake joins the circle of dancers. jake takes grace's hand and pulls her up, protesting. jake lets the drums and chanting flow through him. he lets himself go, dancing from the inside, channeling the primal energy. grace is rocking out, grinning. we see the young girl, so repressed, who lives within her. jake and neytiri flow amongst the dancers, but they are looking only at each other. a couple of the young girls watching from outside the circle are giggling and talking about them. mo'at and eytukan follow their look, seeing the obvious connection.}

<D>__{we cannot let this seed grow. her path is with tsu'tey.}
<A>__{on jake, dancing with abandon to the primal beat, eyes locked with neytiri.}
