<L>__{int papal offices day}
<A>__{a spectacular view of st. peter's square, through the windows of the papal offices. moving down, we find a figure dressed in a simple black cassock, his back to us, staring out at the crowd. father sebastian guttierez, the camerlengo, speaks with a soft spanish accent.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{his holiness once told me that a pope is a man torn between two worlds... the real world and the divine.}
<A>__{assembled in the grand office are langdon, rocher, olivetti, and vittoria. the camerlengo's back is still turned.}
<C>__{camerlengo }
<D>__{he warned that any church that ignored reality would not survive to enjoy the divine.}
<A>__{he turns around. he's younger than we thought, in his mid thirties, deep, dark eyes. the kind of priest who often inspires, before the years of dogma catch up with him.}
<C>__{camerlengo }
<D>__{it seems the real world is upon us tonight.}
<P>__{(to langdon)}
<D>__{i'm familiar with llluminati lore, and the legend of the brandings. la purga is a dark stain on the church's history; i'm not surprised this ghost has come back to haunt us.}
<A>__{he sits behind the massive desk, and if he seemed young before, he seems like a child now, overcome by the position he's in. but when he speaks to rocher, he's in command.}
<C>__{camerlengo }
<D>__{commandante, have you begun a search for this explosive device?}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{of course, but it could be anywhere, and the safety of the cardinals is my primary concern at the moment.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{the sistine chapel is a fortress, as long as the cardinals are in conclave, your security concerns are at a minimum. devote as much of your resources as possible to a search for }
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{signore, if you're about to suggest we make a naked eye search of all of vatican city, i must }
<C>__{camerlengo}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{commander. though i am not his holiness, when you address me, you are addressing this office. do you understand?}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{yes, padre,}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{good. now you said the image on screen was illuminated by artificial light. may i suggest methodically cutting the power to various sections of the city. when the image on your screen goes dark, you'll have a more specific idea of the device's location.}
<A>__{rocher looks at olivetti gotta admit, that's a pretty damn good idea.}
<C>__{camerlengo }
<D>__{ms. vetra. besides yourself and your research partner, who knew about your antimatter project?}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{only the director of cern. but leonardo kept detailed journals; if he told anyone else about what we were doing, he would have made a note of it.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{do you have these journals?}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{i can have them flown here from geneva in an hour.}
<A>__{he pauses, thinking, then turns the phone on his desk to face her. while she picks it up to dial, the camerlengo comes around his desk to speak privately to langdon.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{mr. langdon. you're correct that i may grant you access to the archives.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{thank you, padre.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{i said you're correct that i may, not that i will. christianity's most sacred codices are in that archive. given your recent entanglement with the church i need to ask you a question first.}
<A>__{langdon looks at him fire away.}
<C>__{camerlengo }
<D>__{do you believe in god, sir?}
<C>__{langdon}
<P>__{(delicately)}
<D>__{father, i simply believe that religions can often }
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{i didn't ask if you believe what man says about god, i asked if you believe in god.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{i'm an academic. my mind tells me i will never understand god.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{and your heart?}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{tells me i'm not meant to.}
<A>__{the camerlengo looks at him that's not quite good enough.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{i believe that faith is a gift, which i have not been fortunate enough to receive.}
<A>__{the camerlengo looks at him for a long moment. pretty damn good answer. he puts a hand on langdon's shoulder and leans in.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{be delicate with our treasures.}
