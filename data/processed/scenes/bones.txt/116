<A>__{at the top of the stairs, leading up out of the sub basement, bones smashes the bulb of the hanging light. then flips the light switch the spark ignites the gas behind him. it causes a fiery explosion in the lower basement. the fire's light seems the very glow of hellfire behind bones as he marches up the stairs, razor in his hand.}

<A>__{patrick, trying to stay low, crawls his way to where his sister and cinnabar are trapped. fire begins to burn through from the kitchen and up through the floor. the room is filling with smoke. bill's helping those trampled in the rush to get out. bill himself bleeds badly from his neck. patrick runs with cinnabar and tia toward the door. and as the smoke fills the room, through the haze we see: bones step into the room. his arm raised with the razor. and he flings it out, like a boomerang, the razor flies around the room. it swoops down through the smoke at the remaining kids, hacking at them through the smoke, like some savage bird, though it doesn't seem intent on slaughtering them, but rather herding them out. bill and patrick pull cinnabar and tia out the door they're the last in the room. suddenly the razor stops, freezes in mid air and zips back into bones' waiting fist just like a boomerang. razor held high, bones advances on them, steadily, cool as ice amidst the now fully burning house.}
