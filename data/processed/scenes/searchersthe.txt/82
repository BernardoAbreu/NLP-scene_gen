<A>__{the camera slowly pans from a sun touched butte or crag to the file of men slowly walking their horses. an occasional shred of mist drifts by. everything about the little cavalcade bespeaks tension, watchfulness. suddenly and every man sees it at the same time we see a file of eight comanches ride slowly out of a canyon at a distance, walking their horses at the same pace and on a course roughly parallel with, but slightly converging on, our group.}
