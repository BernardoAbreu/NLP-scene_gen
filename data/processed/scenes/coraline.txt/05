<C>__{coraline }
<D>__{magic dowser, magic dowser: show... me... the well!}
<A>__{angle on coraline from high bluff. the spy moves into frame, astride some kind of motor bike. he presses a button on the handlebars and blasts a loud air horn. startled, coraline spins around. up angle on spy. as lightning flashes and thunder rolls, coraline sees him for the first time. with his turret lensed skull mask and skeleton gloves and black fireman's coat flapping in the wind, he looks like a psycho killer!}
<C>__{coraline }
<P>__{(freaked out)}
<D>__{ahhhhh!}
<A>__{he revs his motor, pops a wheelie, then swoops down the bluff towards her. she hollers in fear, then tries to whack him with her forked stick.}
<C>__{coraline }
<D>__{get away from me }
<A>__{he snatches it from her as he passes, knocking her to the ground. he side skids his bike, hops off and jumps up onto the stump. looking ten feet tall from the ground, thunder and lightning at a peak, the spy turns his three eyed turret lens and studies her like a predatory alien. and then, the thunder and lightning just fade out : and this psycho killer, three eyed spy pulls off his mask and coraline gasps he's just a short kid in a costume. shoulders hunched, neck bent, the spy real name wybie lovat aged 12 examines coraline's forked stick, aims it around.}
<C>__{wybie}
<P>__{(oblivious)}
<D>__{hoo! let me guess, you're from texas or utah; someplace dried out and barren, right? i heard about water witching before but it doesn't make sense; i mean, it's just an ordinary branch.}
<A>__{coraline, snatches it from his gloved hands.}
<C>__{coraline}
<P>__{(enraged)}
<D>__{it's a dowsing rod!}
<A>__{coraline smacks wybie.}
<C>__{wybie}
<D>__{ow!}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{and i don't like being stalked, not by psycho nerds or their cats!}
<A>__{he crouches, nervous, to scratch the cat behind his ears.}
<C>__{wybie}
<D>__{he's not really my cat; he's kinda feral you know, wild? of course, i do feed him every night and sometimes he'll come in my window `n bring me little dead things.}
<A>__{the cat purrs like a diesel.}
<C>__{coraline}
<P>__{(tough)}
<D>__{look, i'm from pontiac.}
<C>__{wybie}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{michigan? and if i'm a "water witch", then }
<P>__{(points stick, stomps foot)}
<D>__{ where's the secret well?}
<C>__{wybie}
<D>__{you stomp too hard and you'll fall in it!}
<A>__{coraline reacts, hops out of the springy circle. the boy scrapes at the ground, revealing a circular covering made of wooden planks. he wedges a fallen branch under one side, and, using a rock for the fulcrum, pries up the covering.}
<C>__{wybie }
<D>__{see? supposed to be so deep if you fell to the bottom and looked up, you'd see a sky full of stars in the middle of the day.}
<C>__{coraline}
<P>__{(softens)}
<D>__{huh.}
<A>__{her frown relaxes and the black cat tilts his head, noticing her change in tone. he steps off the branch, and the well cover thumps in place.}
<C>__{wybie}
<D>__{surprised she let you move in...}
<A>__{jerks his head toward the pink house in distance.}
<C>__{wybie }
<D>__{... my gramma. she owns the "pink palace"}
<P>__{(indicates house in distance)}
<D>__{won't rent to people with kids.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{wybie}
<P>__{(suddenly worried)}
<D>__{uh... i'm not supposed to talk about it.}
<A>__{changing the subject, he lifts a gloved hand to shake.}
<C>__{wybie }
<D>__{i'm wybie, wybie lovat.}
<C>__{coraline}
<P>__{(skeptical)}
<D>__{wybie?}
<C>__{wybie}
<D>__{short for wyborne. not my idea, of course. what'd you get saddled with?}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{i wasn't saddled with anything. it's coraline.}
<C>__{wybie}
<D>__{caroline what?}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{coraline. coraline jones.}
<C>__{wybie}
<P>__{(confused, not hearing it)}
<D>__{hmmm... it's not real scientific, but i heard an ordinary name, like caroline }
<A>__{her face goes as dark as the rain clouds above.}
<C>__{wybie }
<D>__{ can lead people to have ordinary expectations about a person }
<C>__{wybie's grandmother }
<P>__{(calling from afar)}
<D>__{wyborne!}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{i think i heard someone calling you, wyborne.}
<C>__{wybie}
<D>__{what? i didn't hear anything }
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{oh, i definitely heard someone, why were you born.}
<A>__{a distant dinner bell clangs.}
<C>__{wybie's grandmother }
<D>__{wyborne!}
<C>__{wybie}
<P>__{(under his breath, nervous)}
<D>__{grandma!}
<A>__{he holds up his hands in surrender, nodding with eyes closed, forcing some laughs.}
<C>__{wybie }
<D>__{heh. well, great to meet a michigan water witch.}
<A>__{he picks up his bike, wheels it around, then holds up his gloved hands.}
<C>__{wybie }
<D>__{but i'd wear gloves next time.}
<C>__{coraline}
<P>__{(skeptical)}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{he points to her dowsing rod, nods.}
<C>__{wybie }
<D>__{`cause that dowsing rod of yours? uh, it's poison oak.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{ehh!!}
<A>__{coraline drops the stick as he zooms away and wipes her hands on her clothes. the cat merows at her, shaking his head with a pitying look, then trots away after wybie. she sticks out her tongue at him. she looks down at the covering to the well. coraline finds a pebble and drops it through a small knot hole. ear at the knot hole, she counts until there's a watery "plop" far below. fat raindrops start to fall around her.}
