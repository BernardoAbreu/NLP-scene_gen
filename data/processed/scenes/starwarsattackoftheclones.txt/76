<A>__{jango fett comes in from the bedroom. he wears a jumpsuit. he is unshaven and mean looking, his face pitted with scars of old wounds. there are a couple of weird tattoos on his muscular forearms. he eyes obi wan with suspicion.}
<C>__{taun we}
<D>__{welcome back, jango. was your trip productive?}
<C>__{jango fett}

<D>__{obi wan your clones are very impressive. you must be very proud.}
<C>__{jango fett}
<D>__{i'm just a simple man, trying to make my way in the universe, master jedi. obi wan aren't we all?}
<A>__{obi wan eyes the half open bedroom door, through which a couple of pieces of body armour can be seen on the floor. jango fett registers obi wan's look. he moves in front of him, blocking the view.}
<D>__{obi wan}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{ever made your way as far into the interior as coruscant?}

<C>__{jango}
<D>__{boba, close the door.}
<A>__{boba fett moves to close the bedroom door. jango fett smiles thinly at obi wan.}
<C>__{jango}
<P>__{(continuing)}

<C>__{taun we}
<D>__{sido dyas told us to expect him. and he showed up just when your jedi master said he would. we have kept the jedis involvement a secret until your arrival, just as your master requested. obi wan curious...}
<C>__{jango}
<D>__{do you like your army? obi wan it seems to me it's your army being that they are all clones of you.}

<C>__{jango}
<D>__{always a pleasure to meet a jedi.}
