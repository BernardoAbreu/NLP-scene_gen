<B>__{dark room}
<A>__{den and korg silently enter. across the dark room, the glow of the green ball casts a pale light.}
<C>__{korg}
<P>__{(whispers and points)}
<D>__{loc nar.}
<C>__{dan}
<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{wow! it was just like the ball i dug up in my back yard.}
<A>__{they tip toe towards it.}
<C>__{dan}
<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{as i saw the loc nar's glow i had this real funny feeling. all by themselves, my hands reached forward to touch it. but the loc nar moved out of the way. instead, my hands felt something else warm flesh. then the lights came on.}
<A>__{in the brightly lit room, den is standing before the beautiful semi clad queen, and holding her firm, naked breasts in his hands. looking around, he sees that he and kong are surrounded by a brigade of the queen's ugly guards, swords raised.}
<C>__{dan}
<P>__{(v.o.)}
<D>__{talk about embarassing!}
<C>__{queen}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{kill them.}
<A>__{the queen's guards attack with battle axes, clubs and swords. as den knees one in the groin and swings his gun into another's face, four of the guards surround korg and club his brains out. but den, still going strong, throws two guards into the wall and heaves a third out the window. as the queen watches with glee, more guards rush into the room and den is finally over powered and held down. the captain of the guards places a long knife against den's throat.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{can i slit his throat, your majesty?}
<A>__{the queen, eyeing den's magnificent body, sighs.}
<C>__{queen}
<D>__{yes, slit his throat.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{thank you, your majesty.}
<A>__{as the captain presses his knife against den's flesh, the queen suddenly raises her hand.}
<C>__{queen}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{stop! i have, ah, something better in mind.}
<A>__{she takes den's hand and leads him into an adjoining room, as the guards grumble to one another.}
<D>__{guard #1 jeez, not again. guard #2 this}
<A>__{always happens.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{look, she's the queen. she can do whatever she wants. guard #2 yeah, sure. guard #1 sure.}
