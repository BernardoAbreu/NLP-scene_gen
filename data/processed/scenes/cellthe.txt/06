<L>__{10' x 8' room features a shower head, toilet, and a push}
<A>__{button spigot for drinking water. two walls are solid, the other two mirrored, the glass covered by thick clear plastic. the floor is littered with empty food wrappers candy bars, juice boxes. in the center of the floor is a drain and above her, on the ceiling, a fluorescent lamp, also encased in clear plastic. there is no door. a mechanism clicks. then a rumbling... anne seems to know what's coming. she presses against the wall, removes her arms from the sleeves of the sweater, hunches down, and raises the garment over her head, forming a tent. water erupts from the shower head. there is no steam, so this water must be cold. shaking, anne whispers a count to herself "one one thousand, two one thousand, three..." and so on. the spray hits everything in the room mirror, toilet, floor and a food wrapper drifts toward the drain.}

<D>__{thirty.}
<A>__{she peeks up from the tent, but the water has not stopped, and that isn't what she expected. we hear a soft sucking noise and a click. the wrapper rises on a puddle of water. anne pounds her fist on the wall.}
<C>__{anne }
<P>__{(angry, scared)}
<D>__{thirty!}
<A>__{a puddle forms around her feet and she realizes the drain has somehow been sealed shut. her panic intensifies as we hear another click and the water pressure increases.}
