<D>__{thank you. my parents always wanted me to be a doctor, or stockbroker, and gave me a first class education...but to no avail. my brothers are the success stories. i get bored easily. i have a hot head, an inability to tolerate discipline. i fall out with people left and right. i'm quick to settle matters with my fists. the only creatures i've ever loved and treated well, are budgerigars. in any normal area of life, i'd be...or am...a total liability. all i've got going for me is i'm quick in a car.}
