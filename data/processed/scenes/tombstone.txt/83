<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{wait... wait... steady...}
<L>__{75 yards and the first shots ring out, richochetting off the}

<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{now!}
<A>__{they whirl around and disappear into the cut. the cowboys keep coming. wyatt's group reaches the little trail leading up the wall of the cut he used to avoid josephine. they clamber up the side of the cut at a bounding gallop, unseen, as moments later the cowboys gallop by and continue through into the desert on the other side. wyatt's group careens up and around the high mountain wall as if on a roller coaster, following the tiny, narrow path at a breathtaking clip, the trail finally plunging them back into the draw behind the cowboys. they speed up to the opposite mouth of the cut, drawing their pistols as the cowboys gallop into the desert before them, unaware.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{lay on!}
<A>__{they charge forward. seeing the empty desert ahead, the cowboys pull up, looking around in confusion. suddenly a volley of gunfire hits them from behind, knocking several from the saddle. they spin around just as wyatt's group slams into them head on, guns blazing, cowboys tumbling from the saddle left and right, horses rearing and toppling over backwards.}
<C>__{pony deal}
<D>__{run!}
<A>__{the remaining cowboys turn and dash into the desert. wyatt shouts:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{come on!}
<A>__{wyatt's group charges, the thoroughbreds closing the distance in seconds. vermillion stands in his stirrups, roaring like an animal as he plunges into them, swinging his quirt like a saber and lashing a cowboy across the face, making him tumble to the earth and bounce over the rocks like a rag doll. mcmasters closes with another, throwing an arm around him and jerking him from the saddle, snapping his neck. doc overtakes a 3rd, jams his pistol into his face and fires point blank, blackening his face with soot and blowing out the back of his head as he falls. reins in his teeth, shotgun at his shoulder, johnson comes up behind a 4th and fires. the cowboy's head disappears in a cloud of pink vapor, the body dropping like a stone.... wyatt bears down on pony deal at a dead run. pony deal turns in the saddle and fires at him. we feel a surge of breathless exhilaration as wyatt swings out of the saddle like a commanche and ducks his body down against the side of his horse, hiding in its lee. pony deal turns for another shot only to see an apparently riderless horse overtake him. but in the next instant wyatt darts around under his horse's neck and fires, blowing pony deal head over heels off the back of his horse. wyatt bounds back into the saddle as mcmasters rides by, drawing a bead with his rifle on the lone survivor, the 1st cowboy. only a few yards in front of them, he whips his horse frantically, trying to get away. mcmasters is about to fire when wyatt rides up, deflecting the shot. the cowboy makes it over a rise and disappears.}
<C>__{mcmasters}
<D>__{what'd you do that for?}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{so he can tell the story.}
