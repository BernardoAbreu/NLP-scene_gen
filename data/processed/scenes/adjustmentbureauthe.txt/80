<L>__{exterior east village morning}
<A>__{the bus stops. david jumps out on broadway. follow him as he takes off across the street and runs down 12th. he catches up to her at university place.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{elise!}
<A>__{the woman turns around. and it's her...}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{david?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{wow... how are you?}
<A>__{reeling from the adrenaline; david takes a moment, then:}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(from the heart)}
<D>__{i rode the ml to work every day for the last three years hoping one day i'd run into you again.}
<A>__{she's amused, rather than moved, because she doesn't buy it.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{calling would have been easier.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i couldn't.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{girlfriend wouldn't let you?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{no girlfriend.}
<A>__{she looks at him with continued skepticism. but his expression is dead serious.}
<C>__{david }
<D>__{can we go somewhere and talk?}
<A>__{she hesitates. it hurt when he didn't call. she's angry at herself for that, but it's the truth.}
<C>__{elise}
<P>__{(re: his suit)}
<D>__{don't you have to get to work?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i just got sick.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{"i haven't seen you in three years you make me sick" is not an ideal come on. for the record.}
<A>__{david smiles. she's softening. a little. his phone vibrates. he pulls it out of his pocket.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{one second.}
<P>__{(picking up)}
<D>__{charliet can't make breakfast.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{and...i might have to push the speech.}
<C>__{charlie }
<D>__{what? are you crazy?!}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i just ran into elise.}
<A>__{he hangs up.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{you just hung up on your best friend.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{we've known each other since we were kids. we have a shorthand.}
<A>__{he's not being flip or clever or smooth. he's being matter of fact. serious.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{what speech?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{doesn't matter. let's take a walk.}
<A>__{his focus on her is absolute. but she's wary of getting reeled in again.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{somewhere far. we have a lot to talk about.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{i don't think you should cancel your speech. what if i don't like you at the end of our walk?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i will take my chances.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{seriously, my number hasn't changed. just call me like you didn't last time.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{my speech will always be there, you might not be.}
<C>__{elise}
<P>__{(amused indignant)}
<D>__{i was there, david. you didn't call me!}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{walk with me and i will explain that.}
<A>__{she's still dubious. his phone vibrates. this time he turns it off .}
<C>__{david }
<P>__{(a statement of fact)}
<D>__{i'm not losing you again. i'm not letting you out of my sight.}
<C>__{elise}
<D>__{stalker.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{can we walk?}
<A>__{the moment she finally relents, cut to:}
<C>__{following shot}
<D>__{polished black shoes running down a corridor on an impossibly shiny black floor with inlaid decorative silver borders.}
