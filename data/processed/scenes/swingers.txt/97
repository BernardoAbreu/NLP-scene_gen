<C>__{trent}
<P>__{(pulling him aside, dead serious)}
<D>__{now when you talk to her, i don't want you to be the guy in the pg 13 movie that everyone's pulling for. i want you to be the guy in the rated r movie who you're not sure if you like.}
<A>__{mike nods and, energized by the bombardment, crosses back to the bar and right into the fray. trent and sue rejoin the other swingers. swinger's p.o.v. of mike decisively engaging her in conversation. she laughs. out comes the pen and the cocktail napkin. bingo. mike crosses back to the swingers' table and, using his body to shield nikki's view, pretends to rip the napkin. this breaks the guys up. mike sits down and, after admiring the blotchy numerals, delicately folds the napkin and pockets it.}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{see, baby. it's not that hard.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{818?}

<C>__{sue}
<D>__{definitely. two days. that's the industry standard...}
<C>__{trent}
<P>__{(to sue. shop talk)}
<D>__{... i used to wait two days. now everyone waits two days. three days is kinda money now, don't you think?}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{... yeah. but two's enough not to look anxious...}
<C>__{trent}
<D>__{yeah, but three days is kinda the money...}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(interrupting sarcastically)}
<D>__{why don't i just wait three weeks and tell her i was cleaning out my wallet and found her number...}
<C>__{charles}
