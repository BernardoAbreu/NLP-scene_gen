<L>__{128. main deck night}
<A>__{the sky a great canopy of stars, the ship racing onwards through the warm night. crew men and the recovering wounded have come up on deck. now they sit around in groups, supping their grog. someone produces a jaw harp, someone else a drum. a guitar is passed from hand to hand, stopping with black bill who sings a ballad in an african dialect. there's an effortless integration of race and rank, of age and nationality bonds forged by battle and hardship. old sponge gets up and dances a greek dance: obviously a favorite among the crew. cheering and cat calls. lanterns coming up from below. more dancing, insults in many languages, and a song.}
