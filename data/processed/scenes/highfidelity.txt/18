<A>__{rob is on his knees, opening boxes with a razor knife. he talks to us as he works.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i'm sick of the sight of this place, to be honest. some days i'm afraid }
<A>__{dick sticks his head in the door, looks at rob, looks where rob is looking (camera), and retreats back through the door. rob continues.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i'm afraid i will go berserk, rip the elvis costello mobile from the ceiling, throw the "country artists male a k" rack out onto the streets, go off to work in a virgin megastore and never come back }
<A>__{he hears the bell on the front door ring, and he stops and listens, looks a bit worried.}
<C>__{customer }
<D>__{i'm looking for a record for my daughter. for her birthday. "i just called to say i love you." do you have it?}
<C>__{barry }
<D>__{oh yeah. we got it.}
<A>__{rob relaxes and goes back to work.}
<C>__{customer }
<D>__{great. can i have it then?}
<C>__{barry }
<D>__{no, you can't.}
<A>__{rob deflates, shaking his head.}
<B>__{store floor}
<A>__{barry leans back, elbows up on the counter behind him, talking to the customer, a middle aged graying man in a raincoat.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{because it's sentimental tacky crap, that's why not. do we look like the kind of store that sells "i just called to say i loved you?" go to the mall and stop wasting our time.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{what's your problem? what did i... why are you }
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{do you even know your daughter? there is no way she likes that song. or is she in a coma?}
<A>__{the customer throws up his hands and starts out of the store.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{okay, okay, buddy. i didn't know it was pick on the middle aged square guy day. my apologies. i will be on my way.}
<A>__{he steps out of the door.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{b'bye!}
<A>__{outside, anger catches up to the customer. he turns and throws up a middle finger }
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{fuck you!}
<A>__{ and bolts. barry smiles and turns to see}
<B>__{rob}
<A>__{standing in the doorway of the stock room. he feigns applause.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{nice, barry.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{rob. top five musical crimes perpetrated by stevie wonder in the '80's and '90's. subquestion is it in fact unfair to criticize a formerly great artist for his latter day sins? "is it better to burn out than to fade away?"}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{you just drove a fucking customer away, barry.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{we didn't even really have it. i happen to know for a fact that the only stevie wonder single we have is "don't drive drunk." i was just goofing on the straight, and it never cost you a penny.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{not the pointerior}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{oh, so what's the point then?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i don't want you talking to our customers like that again.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{"our customers?" you think that mr. l.l. bean out there is going to be a regular?}
<A>__{rob's face begins to redden with anger.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{barry, i'm fucking broke! i know we used to fuck with anyone who asked for anything we didn't like, but it's gotta stop.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{bullshit. the guy was going to buy one record which we didn't even have and leave and never come back again anyway. why not have a little fun? big fucking deal.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{what did he ever do to you?}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{he offended me with his terrible taste.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{it wasn't even his terrible taste. it was his daughter's.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{oh, now you're defending that motherfucker? you're going soft in your old age, rob. there was a time when you would have chased him out of the store and up the street. now all of a sudden i'm offending your golf buddy.}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{you're right, rob. i am so sorry. how are we ever going to make enough money to get you and laura into the country club?}
<A>__{rob is red and seething.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{and by the way, i tell you this for your own good: that's the worst sweater i've ever seen. i have never seen a sweater that bad worn by anyone i'm on speaking terms with. it's a disgrace to the human race.}
<A>__{rob springs on barry, grabbing him by the lapels and jerking him up against the wall. rob is so mad he can't say anything.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{hey, guys... hey.}
<A>__{rob runs out of steam and drops barry, who backpedals fast.}
<C>__{barry}
<P>__{(extremely shaken)}
<D>__{what are you, some kind of fucking maniac? if this jacket's torn you're gonna pay big.}
<A>__{barry stomps out of the store. rob turns and goes back to the stockroom, and sits on the stepladder. dick appears in the doorway, terrified.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{are you all right?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{yeah. i'm sorry... look dick, laura and i broke up. she's gone. and if we ever see barry again maybe you can tell him that.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{'course i will, rob. no problem. no problem at all. i will tell him next time i see him.}
<A>__{rob nods. dick sets out into the uncharted conversational territory of interpersonal relationships.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{i've ah... got some other stuff to tell him anyway, so it's no problem. i will just tell him about, you know, laura, when i tell him the other stuff.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{fine.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{i will start with your news before i tell him mine, obviously. mine isn't much, really, just about marie lasalle}
<P>__{(flashes cd of pretty woman)}
<D>__{playing at lounge ax tonight. i like her, you know, she's kind of sheryl crowish... but, you know, good. so i will tell him before that. good news and bad news kind of thing.}
<A>__{dick laughs nervously.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{or rather, bad news and good news, because he likes this person playing tonight. i mean, he liked laura too, i didn't mean that. and he likes you. it's just that }
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i understand, dick.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{sure. 'course. rob, look. do you want to... talk about it, that kind of thing?}
<A>__{rob looks up at dick, who is so nervous that his brow is wet.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{no. thanks though, dick.}
<A>__{dick sighs with relief, and smiles his way out of the stock room.}
