<L>__{interior lowrey's condo night}
<A>__{burnett and julie are sitting at the computer looking at mug shots dialed in from the police database. she fiddles with, but does not eat her salad, while stealing sideways glances from the computer screen to the nasty, bologna sandwich burnett is eating.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{the shooter said four days until he makes the deal. what else did he say?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{somethin' weird. sounded like three angels... he wasn't worried because he had three little angels on his shoulders tellin' him something. i didn't get the rest.}
<P>__{(back to the mug shots)}
<D>__{i'm getting tired of looking at ugly people.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{just a few more and we can take another break.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i don't wanna take a break. then we'd have to talk and i got nothing to say to a cannibal.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{a what?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{that was a living, breathing consciousness. it felt joy. sadness. maybe it even had a name.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{what had a name.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{that flesh you're shoveling into your mouth.}
<C>__{burnett}
<P>__{(stops chewing)}
<D>__{it's just bologna.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{it was alive. some farmer fed it. got it to trust him. then blew its brains out, dumped it in a cement mixer with a ton of carcinogens and now you're eating it.}
<A>__{burnett never looked at it that way. he starts to put it down.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{no. at least finish it so i won't have to look at it.}
<P>__{(back to the screen)}
<D>__{let's look at some more ugly people.}
<A>__{angle computer screen it's a photo of noah along with his extensive rap sheet.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{wait. hold it. go back... that's him! that's one of 'em.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{you sure?}
<A>__{julie nods. she's certain.}
