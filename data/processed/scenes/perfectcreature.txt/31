<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{sit, sit.}

<C>__{anderson}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you've done well lilly. the reporter is more of a problem. we have 2 days by law before we have to release her. then it's out.}
<A>__{anderson lays down the medi kit and stares at it as he motions for her to sit. she does.}

<D>__{i hate these things. i'm like a pin cushion.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{it's better than the alternative, sir.}

<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{you have a problem with it?}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{not particularly.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{good. i think they can help. and i don't want someone working on this whose got something against the church.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{how do you know i don't?}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{lilly, you're the least prejudiced person i know. in fact, you're the only one i know. that's important. the church is powerful, but more than that, people's faith in the brotherhood is about all they've got these days. and the government knows it. even the queen herself is involved. this is political.}
