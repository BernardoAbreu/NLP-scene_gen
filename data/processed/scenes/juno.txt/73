<A>__{mark and vanessa stand silently in the nursery. the walls are primed slate gray. a single antique rocking chair sits in the corner. vanessa beams proudly and holds two paint samples up near the wall.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{what do you think? custard or cheesecake?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{they're yellow.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{well, i wanted to pick something gender neutral for now. once we get the baby, god willing, we can create a more decisive palette.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{why do people think yellow is gender neutral? i don't know one man with a yellow bedroom.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{i think i'm leaning toward custard in this light. i don't know. i should paint a small area...}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{or you could just wait a couple months. it's not like the baby's going to storm in here any second and demand dessert colored walls.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{what to expect says that readying the baby's room is an important process for women. it's called "nesting."}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{nesting, huh? are you planning to build the crib out of twigs and saliva?}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{you should read the book. i even flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i just think it's too early to painterior that's my opinion.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{and i disagree.}
<A>__{mark shrugs, resigned. vanessa points to the nursery's largest wall.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{that wall is going to need something. maybe we could put our first family picture there.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{hm.}
<C>__{vanessa}
<D>__{can you see it?}
<A>__{mark stares at the wall, looking lost.}
