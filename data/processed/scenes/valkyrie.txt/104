<L>__{interior conference hut hallway day}
<A>__{freyend steps into the hall. no sign of stauffenberg. sergeant adam approaches, looking confused.}
<C>__{freyend}
<D>__{where the hell is stauffenberg?}
<A>__{but adam shrugs, holding out stauffenberg's hat.}
<L>__{exterior wolf's lair communications building day}
<A>__{fellgiebel and haeften watch anxiously as stauffenberg clears the security checkpoint and walks toward them, slow and deliberate eerily calm.}
<L>__{interior conference hut briefing room day}
<A>__{hitler at the far end of the room, bent over the conference table, leaning on his elbows. a massive, ear splitting explosion lifts the table up, throwing hitler back and simultaneously vaporizing the men standing on either side of him.}
<L>__{exterior wolf's lair conference hut day}
<A>__{the hut explodes outward like a house of cards. bodies are thrown clear. everyone hits the deck except stauffenberg. he just keeps walking. a great cloud of smoke billows from the ruins. the sky is alive with a swirl of burnt paper scraps and ash. stunned officers are running about. shouting. screaming. absolute chaos. even knowing it was coming, haeften is stunned. stauffenberg walks up to the communications building and takes him by the arm, turning to fellgiebel.}
<C>__{stauffenberg}
<D>__{contact general olbricht in berlin. tell him hitler is dead. proceed with operation valkyrie. then sever all communications.}
<A>__{fellgiebel nods and rushes to make the call. stauffenberg leads haeften to their waiting car still driven by young lt. kretz. he too is stunned by the explosion so much so that he does not think to get out and open the door for his passengers. stauffenberg climbs in next to kretz, pushing haeften in the back.}
<C>__{stauffenberg }
<P>__{(to kretz)}
<D>__{drive.}
<P>__{(kretz lingers)}
<C>__{lieutenant.}
<A>__{kretz snaps out of it and jams the car in gear, speeding off down the forested trail. stauffenberg and haeften look back for a clear view of the total destruction. bodies are carried out of the demolished hut the grounds littered with the wounded. surly there is no way the fuhrer could have survived.}
