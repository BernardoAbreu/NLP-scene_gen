<ACTION>__{Beneath a jawdroppingly storybook castle, a small Renaissance Fair with florid awnings, demented ACROBATS and roaring puppets is unfolding. RUSTIC FARMERS and their families rumble with enjoyment at the Sabbath afternoon entertainment. Encircled by children, A JUGGLER WITH AN UNFORGETTABLY ETCHED FACE elegantly plucks the red balls from a pouch on his mule.  As he begins to juggle, a LOUD EXPLOSION is heard, causing him to ungracefully drop his balls and collapse in a heap. Everyone at the fair, including the puppets, looks up.}

He turns and loses his smile, something extraordinary reflecting off his glasses.  Removing his shades, Da Vinci moves to the Something, a gloriously incredible machine.  The opening CREDITS REVEAL its dazzling idio- syncrasies. TWO COUGHING APPRENTICES haplessly try to disperse smoke from the still billowing, mysteriously spectacular Machine.  Mirrors attached to parts of it reflect beams of light which cut through the smoke like a Renaissance laser show.}

<ACTION>__{The apprentice throws a lever.  A shunt near the furnace turns.  Steam escapes upwards.  The machine immediately slows down.  Da Vinci oh-so-gently coughs and moves for- ward with tongs. A LITTLE TROUGH - IN THE MACHINE'S INNARDS comes to a trembling, mystical halt.  Right behind this trough is a CONPLEX POLYHEDRON CRYSTAL as intricately modulated as any Rubik stocking stuffer, but much more dazzling in beauty.  It gleams like a jewel in the yellow glow which pours from a PLEASANTLY GRINNING DEMONHEAD into a trough--a glow of heat--and something more than heat. The tongs enter the frame. Da Vinci brings the object closer to his face.  A murmur goes up from the awestruck apprentices as the Master peers at the smoking yellow bar.}

<ACTION>__{With an accompanying blast of smoke, Da Vinci bursts through some double doors into his workshop, sadly reflecting upon the crystal in one hand and the tonged bar in the other. His workshop is a spendiferously enigmatic blend of laboratory and studio; On a table in the foreground is a fresh clay equestrian statue; a large VOLUME of sketches, the inkwell nearby; a MODEL of what looks like a HELICOPTER; Da Vinci flings the tonged bar on the table among these goodies. Pocketing the crystal, Da Vinci meanders through his work- shop casually tinkering with various experiments.  He snaps his fingers at a BATHING SUITED APPRENTICE, wearing a diving helmet prototype.  The Apprentice jumps into a pool of water. Leonardo next stops at an easel displaying a finished- except-for-the-mouth portrait of Mona Lisa, who happens to be seated in a stool before the easel.  She broadly smiles, revealing the worst dental work of her epoch. Da Vinci shakes his head and moves out onto a}

He quickly folds the surprisingly shapable geometric pieces. Calming down, Da Vinci looks from the three components of the crystal to each of the three unfinished works on the table in his workshop.  He ponders then looks back out to the Vinci vista. The bat winged glider DISSOLVES into:}
