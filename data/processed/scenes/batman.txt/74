<L>__{exterior halliday plaza day}
<A>__{a sunny, landscaped quad surrounded by corporate skyscrapers: trees, grass, marble fountains, flags of many nations. amid the pedestrians we catch bruce and vicki, all smiles, cutting through the plaza on the way to lunch.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{... to tell you the truth, i'd just about given up waiting.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{i said i'd call you the minute i got free. and i did. and here we are.}
<C>__{vicki}
<P>__{(teasing him)}
<D>__{hm hmm. lunch. not even dinner.}
<A>__{he stops in his tracks, takes her by the shoulders.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{vicki. do you want the whole truth? all coyness aside?}
<P>__{(long pause)}
<D>__{i wish i had more time to give you. every day i don't see you, i miss you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now. are you going to waste this lovely afternoon being all mad at me?}
<A>__{all this, of course, is delivered with devastating sincerity. vicki finds herself totally disarmed.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{okay, i'm a sucker. you sound so much like someone i used to...}
<P>__{(stopping suddenly)}
<D>__{bruce? i know this is silly, but you're not married, are you?}
<A>__{he stops and laughs. she smiles crookedly, takes his arm. another angle across plaza that moment philly ricorso another crimelord from the boardroom enters the plaza flanked by a cadre of paid bodyguards.}
<B>__{on bruce and vicki}
<A>__{a painted street mime walks alongside them, feeling his way along an imaginary wall. vicki groans.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{all street mimes should be executed.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{... looks like a convention.}
<A>__{and indeed, there are half a dozen street mimes converging on the center of the plaza. ricorso and co. approach the mirrored glass entrance of a skyscraper. in the lobby, a mime who's been annoying the passersby throws a bolt, locking the doors from inside. a bodyguard bangs on the glass. nearby, another mime reaches into a trash bin and pulls out a machine gun. sudden screams of terror from the onlookers. vicki turns to bruce. before she can get his name out, he's hoisted her bodily and thrown her behind a marble fountain.}
<B>__{series of shots}
<A>__{bruce's eyes darting birdlike around the plaza intercut : with the following pov shots, all in slow motion: two mimes with machine guns. one of them lining philly}
<D>__{and co. up against the glass doors, the other holding the crowd at bay;}
<A>__{ a woman in the crowd fainting. a third mime gleefully}
<D>__{imitating her swoon, to no one's amusement;}
<A>__{ philly and his goons, cowering, hands in the air, as}
<D>__{other mimes cruelly mimic their terrified poses...}
<A>__{... and suddenly bruce is running frantically, looking for a secluded spot, an alleyway, anything. no go. he's out in the open, with onlookers everywhere. in his civvies, he's just another citizen... totally impotent. he darts around a corner, backs against a wall. women, children, grown men race past. no privacy. he's practically quaking now, in the throes of some terrible anxiety. he looks up at the sky overhead, terrified. a brilliant sun bears down on him as machine guns chatter.}
<B>__{angle on philly and bodyguards}
<A>__{bodies jerking as glass rains down in shards.}
<B>__{angle on bruce}
<A>__{his back arched, his mouth agape, his face drained of blood as the sounds of carnage echo through the plaza. it's almost as if the bullets are striking him. a moment later, it's all over but the screaming. vicki emerges from the crowd and finds bruce slumped against the wall, nearly catatonic. she moves to touch him. as if by reflex he reaches out and grabs her by the arms with a grip so strong it could crush bone. she gasps, looks up and sees, in his traumatized eyes, a look so raw, so desperate, that it virtually defies comprehension.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{bruce!!}
<A>__{he blinks rapidly. he relaxes his grip. before vicki's eyes, he's changing... becoming the bruce she knows.}
<C>__{bruce}
<D>__{oh my god... are you all right?}
<A>__{he reaches for her. involuntarily, she steps back. he sees her reaction and his face goes slack frightened, pleading. this time she lets him embrace her... but her face is full of bewilderment and doubt. insert television screen}

<D>__{... live from halliday plaza, where a gangland style execution claimed the life of racketeer philly ricorso. ricorso's death is the third in a rash of underworld killings...}
