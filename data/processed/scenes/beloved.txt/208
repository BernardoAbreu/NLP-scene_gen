<A>__{the sun shines on a warm april day..a day abundant with growth and renewed hope. but a shadow appears to be hovering over 124. it looks more worn than before...neglected, abused. a broken window...the front door off it's hinge...a front step splintered and dangerous.}

<A>__{dirty pans, crusted food on the table, window curtains hanging askew... sethe sits hunched over, asleep, in a chair against the wall. she wears a dirty, torn dress that hangs on her body which seems withered, frailer since we last saw her...in her lap lies a clean pretty dress she was in the process of sewing when she fell asleep from fatigue. a loud crash wakes her up. followed by a loud frustrated yell. her face registers fear. she realizes where she is, what time it is...and begins organizing breakfast... she places the dress neatly on the chair, then grabs a cloth and wipes away the crumbs and dirty plates from supper, placing them in the sink... she opens a pantry cupboard to reveal bare shelves except for a single egg and a bowl of hominy grains about 1 4 full. she searches in a panic for more food anywhere opening cabinets, doors places that never stored food. she realizes there is none left.}
