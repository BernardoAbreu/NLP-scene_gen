<A>__{ripley is washing newt's tiny hands with a cloth, pink skin emerging from black grime.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i don't know how you managed to stay alive but you're one brave kid, rebecca.}
<A>__{newt's voice is almost inaudible.}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{n newt.}
<A>__{ripley leans closer. feels like she's breathing on coals. the sound was incomprehensible.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{newt. my n name's newt. nobody calls me rebecca except my dork brother.}
<A>__{ripley grins inanely, not wanting to move or speak... or break the spell.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{well, newt it is then. my name's ripley...and people call me ripley.}
<A>__{ripley picks up her tiny limp hand, shaking it formally.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{pleased to meet you. and who is this? does she have a name?}
<A>__{newt glances at the disembodied doll, still clutched in one filthy hand.}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{casey. she's my only friend.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{what about me?}
<A>__{newt's reply is flat, neutral.}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{i don't want you for a friend.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{because you'll be gone soon, like the others. like everybody. you'll be dead and you'll leave me alone.}
<A>__{ripley gazes at her, chilled both by the ominous statement and by the situation which could have produced this outlook in a child.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{oh, newt. you mom and dad went away like that, didn't they?}
<A>__{newt nods, staring at her knees.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(soothingly)}
<D>__{they'd be here if they could, honey. i know they would.}
<C>__{newt}
<P>__{(with cold certainty)}
<D>__{they're dead.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{newt. look at me...newt. i won't leave you. i promise.}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{you promise?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{cross my heart.}
<C>__{newt}
<D>__{and hope to die?}
<A>__{ripley smiles grimly at the inadvertently macabre expression.}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{and hope to die.}
<A>__{and because she's a child, the darkest terrors, even the ones seen and not imagined, can still be banished by a smile and a single promise. newt's eyes brim as she gazes at ripley. her lower lip starts to tremble, and her face slowly deforms into an abject mask. she sobs as she clamps her arms around ripley's neck. the sobs come in waves as ripley rocks her, tears of suppresses terror and grief and hurt rolling down her face. it is a breakthrough. ripley closes her eyes, hoping that this promise can be kept.}
