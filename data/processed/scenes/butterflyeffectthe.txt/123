<L>__{interior frat house attic hall night}
<A>__{it's peaceful now. evan covers kayleigh's eyes with his hands as he leads her through the attic hallways. both are dressed to the nines.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{i don't understand, where are you taking me?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{you'll see.}
<L>__{exterior frat house roof continuous}
<A>__{the wooden door to the rooftop swings open, revealing kayleigh and evan. kayleigh is dazzled by what she sees: the entire roof is decorated with fairy lights, chinese lanterns and hundreds upon hundreds of candles. and elegant romantic table for two awaits them, flanked by twelve formally dressed servants (previously seen pledges) who respectfully stare ahead with the utmost class. two pledges immediately pull out two chairs and stand by. kayleigh applauds and laughs with delight.}

<D>__{i don't know what to say. it's beautiful.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{go on. sit down.}
<A>__{as she takes a step toward the table flower petals shower down on her. she looks up to see two more pledges standing on ladders, delicately tossing pedals. kayleigh looks overwhelmed as she sits down.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{why are you doing all this for me?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{simple math. when i woke up this morning and saw your smile... i knew that i wanted to spend the rest of my life with you.}
<A>__{her hand reaches out to his and grabs it fiercely. her eyes tell him she feels the same way. a magical moment. and they lean into each other for a kiss so enchanted it might as well be their first ever hunter bolts up the stairs, two at a time.}
<C>__{hunter}
<D>__{we been lookin' all over for you, man.}
<C>__{senior brother}
<D>__{someone trashed your car.}
<A>__{the moment's gone. evan and kayleigh exchange worried looks.}
