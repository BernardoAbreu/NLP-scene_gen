<A>__{travis speaks intensely into a wall pay phone.}
<C>__{travis }
<D>__{i tried to call her several times.}
<A>__{we hear travis' voice on the phone.}
<C>__{travis}
<P>__{(smoking a cigarette)}
<D>__{you feeling better? you said you didn't feel so good...}
<C>__{travis }
<D>__{but after the first call, she would no longer come to the phone.}
<A>__{travis holds the receiver in his hand. the other party has hung up. tracking shot across interior lower wall of travis' apartment. against the stark wall there is a row of wilted and dying floral arrangements. each one of the four or five bouquets is progressively more wilted than the one closer to the door. they have been returned.}
<C>__{travis }
<D>__{i also sent flowers with no luck. i should not dwell on such things, but set them behind me. the smell of the flowers only made me sicker. the headaches got worse i think i've got stomach cancer. i should not complain so. "you're only as healthy as you feel."}
<A>__{a drama is acted out at palantine headquarters: travis, groggy and red eyed from lack of sleep, walks into the campaign headquarters about noontime. betsy is standing near the rear of the office; she ducks from sight when she sees travis enter. travis' path is cut short by tom's large framed body. there is no live sound.}
<C>__{travis }
<D>__{i realize now how much she is like the others, so cold and distant. many people are like that. they're like a union.}
<A>__{travis tries to push his way past tom but tom grabs him. travis says something sharply to tom and the two scuffle. tom, by far the taller and stronger, quickly overcomes travis, wrenching his arm behind his back. travis kicks and protests as tom leads him to the front door.}
<B>__{on the sidewalk}
<A>__{travis' efforts quickly subside when tom motions to a nearby policeman. travis quiets down and walks off.}
