<L>__{interior tina's bedroom. night}
<A>__{camera moves across the room of the original nightmare to find nancy alone in tina's bed, staring at the slanting ceiling above the bed. thinking. we can just hear her heart beating. she sighs and turns on her side. immediately the wall above her head turns a faint reddish hue, with a broad yellow smear across its center. all unseen by nancy, the wall begins to pulse in exact time with her heart's beat. close on nancy's face. she closes her eyes.}
<B>__{angle back up on the ceiling just above her head. something}
<A>__{presses against the surface from the inside. the plaster buldges out as if suddenly elastic, taking the shape of the thing pressing from inside taking the shape of a man's face . the face opens its mouth. the knives rake through the surface. angle on nancy as plaster dust snows down on her. she jerks awake, sitting bolt upright. the face retracts suddenly the wall is normal. angle down on nancy as she looks up to the ceiling, touching her hair and feeling the plaster dust. reverse in her pov to the ceiling. there are three parallel cuts in the plaster there. about eight inches long. as if cut by sharp knives. nothing else. back on nancy. she draws the covers around her and shivers. eyes wide open.}
