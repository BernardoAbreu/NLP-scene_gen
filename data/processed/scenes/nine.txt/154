<L>__{exterior beach cafe, anguillara afternoon}
<A>__{it's the end of the season. only a few customers left in the cafe, as the waiters close up for the day, pulling down umbrellas, stacking tables. guido's changed, bearded, hair longer and unkempt. haggard. he looks out to sea, alone, as the waves crash to and fro. a newspaper sits open in front of him. scribbles and heavy markings circle an ad for a theater production in rome. guido gets up at this moment, starts to leave, hesitates, takes the paper, folds it under his arm, and exits the restaurant. he heads up the steps towards the promenade and we catch a glimpse of the profound regret in his eyes }
