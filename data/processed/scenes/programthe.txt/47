<A>__{as it plops down onto a wide ledge not visible from the road, three feet below the top of the bank. joe lands it, skids to a professional stop, breaks into raucous laughter. camille jumps off the bike, scared stiff and livid with anger.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{how could you do that, you stupid punk? it isn't funny, god dammit, you coulda killed us! you're crazy, you know that...}
<C>__{joe}

<D>__{oh, yeh? then why are you shaking?}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{i don't know... i guess cause i've never done it with someone else on the bike.}
<C>__{camille}
<D>__{you just wanted to scare me. are you happy now?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yeh, pretty much. and the scream was even better than i thought it'd be. every dog within hearing distance wants to mate with you now.}
<A>__{camille's ready to throttle him, then something catches her ear. sure enough, there are several dogs barking in the distance. joe smiles at her. she looks away, still angry, but amused in spite of herself.}
