<L>__{exterior the ocean afternoon}
<A>__{the orca is drifting in neutral. the ocean is like gelatin, the sun sucking heat waves from its surface. brody at the stern, handkerchief on his head to protect from further sunburn, has been handed the slimiest job on a shark hunt: the ladling out of chum. there are several empty chum barrels. a flag buoy bobs in the wake of the boat, another waits to be tossed over the side. brody is reeling with nausea. he opens his overnight kit and takes out a handkerchief and some old spice after shave. he pours the after shave into the cloth, presses it to his nose. hooper is also in the stern.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{keep that chum line going we've got five good miles. don't break it.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{who's driving the boat?}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{nobody. we're drifting with the current.}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(using the fish finder)}
<D>__{nothing. nothing, nothing, nothing.}
<C>__{quint}
<P>__{(to hooper)}
<D>__{hell, in the old days we went out with good charts, good sounding lead, and a damn good compass. nowadays, these kids are afraid to go out without depth finders, radar, radio, electric toothbrush, every stupid thing...}
<A>__{quint opens a can of beer and drains it in one long pull, crushing the empty and throwing it over the side. hooper drains his coffee from a styrofoam cup, and cracks it in his hand with a silly "plup." he stows the pieces in an empty chum barrel.}
<C>__{quint}
<P>__{(to brody)}
<D>__{get a fresh barrel.}
<A>__{brody goes to unlash a fresh barrel, but can't figure out the knots. he finally tugs on a piece of rope, and it all comes loose... barrel, shark cage, and, most important, hooper's tanks, clattering and rolling on the deck.}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(jumping up)}
<D>__{watch it! compressed air you screw around with one of those and boom! careful, huh?}
<C>__{quint}
<P>__{(mutters)}
<D>__{real fine stuff but it won't mean a thing to mr. whitey, of course... he didn't go to schools in electronics. he was born with what he does best. eat. he's a swimming appetite. 'course he might eat this stuff, but then i've seen him eat a rocking chair, too.}
<P>__{(to brody)}
<D>__{next time, ask me.}
