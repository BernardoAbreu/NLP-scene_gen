<DIAL>__{Pardon the interruption, but I'll just be getting back to work now.}
<CHAR>__{BENJY MOUSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That won't be necessary, Slartibartfast.}
<CHAR>__{ZAPHOD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(cracking up, like he's stoned)}
<DIAL>__{Smarty fart blast? BENJY/FRANKY Eat!}
<CHAR>__{ZAPHOD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Right.}
<CHAR>__{BENJY MOUSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It looks like we won't be needing the new Earth after all, now that we've found the only living native of the planet.}
<CHAR>__{SLARTIBARTFAST} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But...they've nearly finished the oceans.}
<CHAR>__{FRAHKY MOUSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That will be all, Slartibartfast. Slarti, slightly hurt, backs away out of sight.}
<CHAR>__{ARTHUR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm sorry, when you say "the only living native" -- do you mean me? What about her? Benjy holds up a strand of hairs, same color as Trillian's.}
<CHAR>__{BENJY MOUSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We performed some rudimentary DNA tests on the ship. She's half-native. Her real father was a Blahardid, the hyper- intelligent yet carelessly nomadic race native to the planet Olbed, who apparently popped in to Earth for a one-nighter with a one Ms. Francis McMillan.}
<CHAR>__{TRILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(looking up, mouth full)}
<DIAL>__{Which explains a lot. She goes back to eating.    Arthur is taking this all in.}
<CHAR>__{ARTHUR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So -- mostly harmless and me.    That's it.}
<CHAR>__{BENJY MOUSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We're sorry to have stage managed you so shamelessly, but once we learned you were the only full-blooded Earthling in the universe, it was important that we get you here by any means necessary.}
<CHAR>__{FRANKY MOUSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We've spent a considerable amount of time on your planet trying to find this wretched Ultimate Question, and the thought of doing it all over again on account of those idiotic Vogons sickens me to no end. Which is why you're here.}
<CHAR>__{BENJY MOUSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sit, Earthling. Sit. Arthur goes to pull out the chair beside him. BENJY/FRANKY NOT THERE! Arthur jumps. The others look up.      Benjy and Franky cover their outburst with a smile.}
<CHAR>__{BENJY MOUSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{This chair is much more -- comfortable. Benjy makes a motion. The chair he pushed out before slides over behind Arthur's knees, making him sit.}
<CHAR>__{BENJY MOUSE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Drink. He slides the cup of tea over.     Arthur takes a sip.}
<CHAR>__{ARTHUR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Mmmm.    This really is delicious.}
<CHAR>__{BENJY MOUSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Good. Glad you like it.      Now -- to business. Ford and Zaphod raise their glasses like drunken sailors. FORD/ZAPHOD To business! Benjy and Franky fire them a look.}
<CHAR>__{ZAPHOD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sorry.    Thought you were proposing a toast. BENJY/FRANKY EAT! Ford and Zaphod eat. Benjy turns to Arthur. Smiles. No one notices, through the window, a row of Vogons cresting the hill.}
<CHAR>__{BENJY MOUSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{About this Ultimate Question. You see, we've been offered a quite enormously fat contract to do the 5D TV chat show and lecture circuit, and quite frankly, we're very much inclined to take it.}
<CHAR>__{FRANKY MOUSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But - and here's the point - we have to have product. Which means we still need an ultimate question.}
<CHAR>__{BENJY MOUSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Or at least, one that sounds ultimate.}
<CHAR>__{FRANKY HOUSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes.     Got to sound good.}
<CHAR>__{ARTHUR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{An Ultimate Question that sounds good... From a couple of mice...for a chat show.}
<CHAR>__{FRANKY MOUSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And as it turns out, the chances are astronomically high that the structure of the question is encoded in your brain. Which is why we need it. More tea? Franky tries to pour more tea. Arthur stops drinking, a little woozy. Did he hear them right?}
<CHAR>__{ARTHUR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm sorry -- did you just say you need my brain?}
<CHAR>__{BENJY MOUSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes.     To extract the question.}
<CHAR>__{ARTHUR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You can't have my brain. I'm using it.}
<CHAR>__{FRANKY MOUSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Barely.}
<CHAR>__{BENJY MOUSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We can replace it if you think it's important. An electronic brain maybe.}
<CHAR>__{FRANKY MOUSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{A simple one should suffice. Who would know the difference?}
<CHAR>__{ARTHUR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I would!}
<CHAR>__{FRANKY MOUSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, you wouldn't. We could program you not to. Arthur tries to get up. Clamps spring up from the chair and wrap around his arms. A dome flips over from the back and slams down on his head. Arthur struggles.}
<CHAR>__{ARTHUR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ford!    Zaphod!   TRILLIAN!! They're gorging on the food, half-lidded, out of it.}
<CHAR>__{ARTHUR } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{What are they-- what's in the food?! WHAT WAS IN THAT TEA!? The platter the mice are standing on rises up, moves toward Arthur, ominous surgical instruments spring from it.}
<CHAR>__{BENJY MOUSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Don't worry. You won't feel a thing. The mice on the platter move ominously toward Arthur. Arthur, still attached to the chair, backs away. Scythes and rotating arms with circular saw blades shoot out -- ominous surgical equipment to remove his brain.}
<CHAR>__{ARTHUR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Wait a minute, JUST WAIT A SODDING MINUTE!! The scythes and arms stop spinning. Arthur stumbles backwards and sits down in the chair. The others stop eating and listen.}
<CHAR>__{ARTHUR } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{You want the question that goes with the answer "42" How about "What's six times seven?" Or "How many Vogons does it take to screw in a lightbulb?" Or here's one, "How many roads must a man walk down?"}
<CHAR>__{BENJY MOUSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey, that's not bad. Through the opposite window (in much the same way bulldozers arrived in the opening) we see more Vogons arriving.}
<CHAR>__{ARTHUR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Fine. Take it. There's plenty more where that came from because my head is filled, with questions, and I can assure you mate, no answer to any of them has ever brought me one iota of happiness. Confusion? Yes. Indecision? Loads. But happiness...? He shakes his head.}
<CHAR>__{BENJY MOUSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We don't want to be happy.   We want to be rich.}
<CHAR>__{FRANKY MOUSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Take his brain. Benjy steers the platter toward Arthur. He jerks his arms up. They break free of the shackles and hit the platter. The mice fly through the air and land on the table -- right beside the POV gun. They scramble to their feet.}
<CHAR>__{BENJY MOUSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Shoot him!! They try to lift the POV gun but it's way too heavy. Arthur, his butt still strapped in the chair, leaps over to the table and grabs the first thing he sees -- a leg of mutton. He raises it high. Benjy and Franky look up.}
<CHAR>__{FRANKY MOUSE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, shit. Arthur brings the mutton down, squashing them flat. The others instantly snap out of their food induced haze, Zaphod suddenly clutches his gut.}
<CHAR>__{ZAPHOD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ohhhh, I think I'm gonna be sick. Arthur looks up and now he sees the Vogons marching down the hill toward the house. He leans over the table, bumping his teacup. IT SHATTERS TO THE GROUND.}
<ACTION>__{ON THE HILL JUST BEYOND --}
<DIAL>__{An ARMY OF VOGON POLICE march over it.    Amongst them... MARVIN -- marches as well, a gun held to his head.}
<CHAR>__{MARVIN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to the Vogon)}
<DIAL>__{I must warn you, I'm feeling very depressed.}
<CHAR>__{KWALTZ} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Mr. President!     We are here for your protection! Zaphod appears at the front door and waves Presidentially.}
<CHAR>__{ZAPHOD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thank you!}
<ACTION>__{The Police open fire. Zaphod and the others flee as the}
<DIAL>__{barrage of fire continues. Trillian drops the POV gun, goes back for it. Arthur stops her and pulls her behind the truck. Marvin catches a bullet in the back of his head - sparks fly and he is thrown forwards! Is he dead? BEHIND THE TRUCK -- FORD looks at MARVIN lying face down in the dirt - his head emitting smoke.}
<CHAR>__{FORD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Okay -- that thing I said about not saving my life because we're even? Scratch that. Save at will.}
<CHAR>__{TRILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We need that gun.}
<CHAR>__{ZAPHOD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(campaign sound-byte)}
<DIAL>__{We need tighter gun control!}
<CHAR>__{FORD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We need his other head.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(an idea)}
<DIAL>__{Okay -- I'll create a distraction.}
<ACTION>__{He holds up his towel.}
<CHAR>__{ARTHUR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(sarcastic)}
<DIAL>__{Brilliant plan. I'm certain it will work.}
<CHAR>__{FORD} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(squinting at Arthur)}
<DIAL>__{You know -- I think sometimes you say things that mean something other than what you're actually saying.}
<ACTION>__{More gunfire erupts. Ford spins his towel until it's twisted and taught. He leaps up and runs towards... ...THE VOGON POLICE FORCE -- who see him coming, his towel held like he's going to whip someone on the ass.}
<CHAR>__{FORD } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{AHHHHHHHH!!!!}
<ACTION>__{The Vogons are so caught off guard, they back away.}
<CHAR>__{TRILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Now!}
<ACTION>__{She and Arthur both run out toward the gun.}
<CHAR>__{ARTHUR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{TRILLIAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{It's a towel! It's only a TOWEL!!     GET HIM!!}
<ACTION>__{The Police stop their retreat, raise their guns, move forward. Ford skids to a stop and runs back toward Arthur and Trillian, both clinging to the gun, running back toward the truck. GUNFIRE ERUPTS. A and T TRIP. The POV gun goes flying and lands in... MARVIN'S ARMS. The Vogon Police run in formation toward the gang.       Ford looks back, sees the Vogons approaching. He looks forward, sees Marvin raising the gun.}

<DIAL>__{Where?}
<ACTION>__{He looks to the skies just as Ford fans out his towel and uses it to bring Z, A & T to the ground just as... MARVIN FIRES THE POV GUN, Questular ducks. CLICK. The entire Vogon Police force is hit. They instantly stop. Their shoulders slump.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(in unison)}
<DIAL>__{Oh what's the point?}
<ACTION>__{They turn their weapons on themselves and... ANGLE ON FORD, ZAPHOD, ARTHUR AND TRILLIAN -- turning their heads as we hear the weapons fire. They look up. All the Vogon Police lie motionless on the ground including Kwaltz. Questular is the last man standing. He marches toward them, patches of clump baldness on his head. He drops to his knees.}
<CHAR>__{QUESTULAR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Shoot me. Please Zaphod. Shoot me.}
