<A>__{junior is running at breakneck speed through the thick brush. bloodhounds bark. junior slows down and drops to his knees, gasping for breath. he looks up to the sky. the camera pushes up to his sweaty, tortured face.}

<D>__{sheila!}
<L>__{interior babylon lanes, buzz's office}
<A>__{miles kastle lounges in a cheap chair behind buzz's desk toying with one of those motorized wire balancing sculptures they have in airport souvenir concessions. he is a carefully groomed middle aged low budget version of hugh hefner in an acrylic sweatsuit with 'miles 'o' lanes' embroidered on the front. sid and breeze push buzz into the room. buzz is poker faced.}

<D>__{buzz.}
<A>__{buzz nods.}
<C>__{kastle}
<P>__{(to breeze)}
<D>__{you got my whip?}
<A>__{breeze pulls the third whip out of a bag and gives it to him.}
<C>__{kastle}
<P>__{(motions to sid and breeze)}
<D>__{lose yourselves.}
<A>__{sid and breeze leave the room. buzz goes to a locker and begins changing into a flashy mc outfit.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{what's on your mind, miles?}
<C>__{kastle}
<D>__{we've been partners a long time now, haven't we buzz?}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{seven years.}
<A>__{kastle pokes a straw into the whip and takes a long drag.}
<C>__{kastle}
<D>__{this scam we got going here was your}
<P>__{(more)}
<C>__{kastle}
<D>__{brainstorm, buzz. i admit, i thought it was a rotten idea, but i put up the scratch.}
<P>__{(pulls a smile)}
<D>__{and now we got a beautiful thing.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{it's a beautiful thing.}
<C>__{kastle}
<D>__{a beautiful thing. and you know why buzz? you know what we got? buzz raises an eyebrow as he buttons his shirt.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{we got balance.}
<A>__{kastle flicks the little wire man. it bobs and sways.}
<C>__{kastle}
<D>__{a partnership is a very delicate balance. but let's say something tips the scales, maybe one partner takes more than his share, then... kastle tips the wire man off his perch. the little motor squeals pathetically.}
<C>__{kastle}
<D>__{... oops. we got no more balance.}
<A>__{buzz looks on with narrowed eyes as he adjusts his cravat.}
<C>__{kastle}
<D>__{and look at that; both partners go down together. kastle shoves the sculpture onto the floor, stands up, and crushes it under his heel. he goes over and puts his arm around buzz.}
<C>__{kastle}
<D>__{simple math, buzz.}
<P>__{(he holds up his fingers)}
<D>__{two plus two does not equal three.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{miles, i've always been on the square with you.}
<C>__{kastle}
<D>__{i'm sure you have buzz.}
<C>__{buzz}
<D>__{wish me luck.}
<A>__{buzz jogs out into a spotlight.}
<C>__{kastle}
