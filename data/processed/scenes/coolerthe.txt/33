<L>__{interior casino blackjack tables night}
<A>__{close on a skyline of black chips neatly positioned on the felt. we see the owner of the chips strike a match. his last one. it fizzles out quickly. tilt up to the player's face with an unlit cigarette hanging from his lips. a hand quickly reaches in, lights the cigarette with a zippo. pull back to reveal bernie.}
<C>__{player}
<D>__{thanks...}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{don't mention it.}
<A>__{bernie sits at the table.}
<C>__{dealer}
<P>__{(he knows the routine)}
<D>__{hundred dollar minimum here, sir.}
<A>__{bernie peels off a hundred from his billfold. lays it on the felt.}
<C>__{dealer}
<D>__{money plays one hundred.}
<C>__{player}
<P>__{(to bernie)}
<D>__{no offense, pal, but there's twenty other tables. what do you wanna come sit on my head for?}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{just wanna play one hand. feeling lucky tonight. i got this voice in my head, says this is the table...}
<C>__{player}
<D>__{i know this is the table. i'm already doing good here. it's my fucking table }
<C>__{bernie}
<P>__{(touching him)}
<D>__{hey, heard the one about the fella walks into a bar and says, "hey, who owns that big great dane outside?" a man at the end of the bar raises his hand. "i do." the fella says, "yeah? well, my dog just killed it."}
<A>__{the dealer finishes shuffling, begins to deal.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{"whaddya mean your dog just killed my great dane? what kinda dog you have?" the fella just shrugs and says, "a chihuahua." "you tellin' me your chihuahua just killed my great dane? how?"}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{"i dunno," the fella says, "i think he got stuck in his throat."}
<A>__{bernie starts laughing. the player is less than tickled. just then the dealer interrupts them.}
<C>__{dealer}
<D>__{insurance?}
<A>__{we see the dealer's got an ace showing.}
<C>__{player}
<D>__{god damnit!}
<A>__{the player waves off the insurance, as does bernie. the dealer checks. nothing. as the hand plays through the dealer busts out. bernie glances over at the dealer. what the hell? bernie places his chips again.}
<C>__{player}
<D>__{you said, one hand.}
<C>__{bernie}
<P>__{(agitated; to dealer)}
<D>__{keep going.}
<A>__{the dealer plays. bernie and the high roller win again. bernie glances around him uncomfortably. we see shelly approaching. shelly just has a nose for when things aren't running smoothly. larry is lurking behind him. the dealer turns up some cards. and again, bernie and the high roller win. bernie looks absolutely perturbed. shelly gestures something with his head. bernie cashes out.}
<C>__{player}
<D>__{hey, stick around, pal. you and me, we make a great team.}
<A>__{bernie strolls over to shelly. shelly guides him away from the table under larry's watchful eye.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{what was that?}
<A>__{bernie shrugs, still confused.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{well, what fucking gives? is it mcgann? he's been with us twelve years. the man's as standup as my dick.}
<P>__{(thinking to himself)}
<D>__{maybe he's got money problems. i'm gonna pull him. he wasn't counting 'em, was he? the mook with the streak?}
<A>__{bernie shakes his head. larry sidles over.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{is there a problem?}
<C>__{shelly}
<P>__{(zero tolerance)}
<D>__{no, there's no problem. fella's on a streak, is all.}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(re: bernie)}
<D>__{let me guess? this is one of your "coolers?"}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{why don't you announce it to the whole fucking joint?}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(lowers his voice)}
<D>__{man, they told me you were a stickler for the old ways. but coolers? what is this guy, some kind of degenerate gambler? reformed card shark? he doesn't look too effective to me.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{he's the best. take it from me.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{sure. whatever. but there ways subtle ways to keep things in our favor. i'm talking more forward thinking methods.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{that right? i suppose you got a whole fucking prospectus on the subject.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{as a matter of fact i do. like, right off the bat, i can tell you this wallpaper isn't going to cut it. it's too uplifting. i would go with more muted tones.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{yeah? wallpaper?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{and personally, i think the waitresses can all pop another button or two. myself, i wouldn't hire anything less than a c cup.}
<A>__{shelly looks to bernie. you believe this mook? larry extracts a cd from his jacket...}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{know what this is? music to be sure. pleasant, non intrusive. but blended in at a subsonic level is a mantra. "lose... lose... lose." and that's just skimming the surface. we really need to talk, shelly.}
<A>__{shelly is close to losing it. when morrie, the manager of the paradise, comes running up...}
<C>__{morrie}
<D>__{shelly, you better come quick.}
