<A>__{bowman checks the gauges. eight liters was burned.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{hell, what's eight liters?}
<P>__{(answers herself)}
<D>__{it'll either save their lives or i've screwed up getting home and i will spend the next three hundred years circling this planet.}
<L>__{exterior hab night}
<A>__{burchenal pokes at the flames. they're spread out and low. flickering yellow and blue.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{i think we'll make it through. there's so little o2, this is gonna burn real slow.}
<A>__{gallagher picks up a piece of scrap, about to feed it into the flames, then stops, examines it by the light of the fire. it looks like someone took a rasp to it. he gets up, turns on a suit light and looks over the remaining ribs of the structure.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{what happened to this place? everything but the titanium supports were just chewed up. could a dust storm've done this?}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{no prevailing pattern to the damage. i don't know what could've done it.}
<A>__{nor does it matter right now. they sit back around the fire and relish the warmth. out in the darkness, past a rise, something catches robby's eye. a flash, a reflection. of the fire? on what? and then it's gone. he doesn't bother to mention it. writes it off.}
<B>__{two hundred yards away}
<A>__{behind a hill, amee crouches in the dark. pops up again, looks over, sees the three men and the fire. lowers back down you'd swear she was thinking then silently ambles away.}
<B>__{back around fire}
<A>__{the weird tableau of three men in spacesuits around a campfire on mars. a moment then }
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{you still think we had any business coming to mars? screwing with stuff? trying to spread life? you think maybe god's teaching us some hardass lesson?}
<A>__{pettengill just makes some kind of weird gulping noise and turns away. they let him be.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{god? you talked to chantilas too much on the trip over. i don't mean to burst your bubble, but god's the retreat of the ignorant, the weak and the hopeless.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{i bet you don't believe in santa. and you're no fun at all at christmas.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{not everything gets an explanation you can write down as a formula.}
<C>__{burchenal}
<D>__{son, i'm a scientist. a geneticist, as good as they come. i write code, just like a hacker. four elements, a.g.t.p., in different orders, back the genome. and your kidneys work or you grow a sixth finger. i line up unconscious atoms and they give rise to conscious beings. it's like if i stacked up a bunch of rocks in the right order and they become a dog. i do that. i chose when, i chose where, i chose how many fingers. i just don't hold with mystical explanations for science, with organized religion, buildings with different symbols on 'em. you spot god, you lemme know. till then, i put my trust in my three ph.d's.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{but i think life's an amazing thing. and i believe that when you get it you should grab it with both hands and live as much of it as you can. which is why i am not happy about losing it on this damn ugly planet.}
<A>__{burchenal shuts his eyes. we push in on gallagher looking rueful and... flashback interior ares hygiene sphere day superimpose: mission time: day 32 gallagher comes in. his timing, depending how you look at it, is very good or very bad. bowman steps out of the shower. to dry off. it's too late for robby to stop or recoup. he has to tough it out and try to act like an adult. bowman sees his discomfort. she's amused.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{it's okay. i had brothers.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{i have two sisters.}
<P>__{(gives up)}
<D>__{neither of them were this fine.}
<A>__{now she colors.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{the only way this works, is if we both make believe it doesn't matter.}
<C>__{gallagher}
<D>__{i tried. i really tried.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{maybe i should go fix something.}
<C>__{bowman}
<P>__{(laughing now)}
<D>__{maybe you should.}
<A>__{he hesitates, leaves. she starts to vacuum dry her hair.}
