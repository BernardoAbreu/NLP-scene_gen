<L>__{exterior city street night}
<A>__{passing traffic reveals the storefront of a tv showroom. inside, behind the reflections of the city lights, all the tv sets are showing the same picture, the glittering image of a woman singing. (we will recognize the woman as rachel marron.) we cut tighter and tighter on the image until it is almost broken up into its scanning lines. through the city noise comes the sound of her song "i have nothing."}
