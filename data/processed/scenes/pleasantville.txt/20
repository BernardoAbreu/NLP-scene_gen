<D>__{i know how i'd feel if mine went out. almost like losing a friend.}

<C>__{dick van dyke }
<D>__{say why don't you take this remote instead. it's got a little more "ooomph" in it.}

<D>__{sure. big beautiful set like this you want something that'll put you right in the show.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{we'll take it.}
<B>__{closer.}
<A>__{he flashes them a big smile and holds out a weird looking contraption that seems more primitive than space age. it's a strange combination of an early transistor radio and flash gordon ray gun. dick van dyke extends it with pride, while jennifer and david stare at him warily ...}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{how much does it cost?}

<C>__{dick van dyke }
<D>__{well, i better get going. your show's almost on, and ...}
<P>__{(smiling at jennifer)}
<D>__{it's almost time for your date.}
<A>__{he places the remote control gingerly on the coffee table and smiles at them. dick starts across the living room when he suddenly catches his foot on the leg of the ottoman and tumbles end over end. he rolls on the carpet, executes a perfect somersault and comes right back to a standing position. david and jennifer stare at him stunned when he looks back at them and smiles.}
<C>__{dick van dyke }
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{take care now.}
<A>__{there is another flash of lightning as he reaches for the doorknob. david and jennifer look at one another while the front door shuts with a thud. it's quiet for a second or two before there is another clap of thunder. david cocks his head.}
<B>__{different angle.}
<A>__{david glances down at the strange contraption sitting on the coffee table. it looks a little scary. slowly, very slowy, he reaches down and touches it. nothing seems to happen so he picks it up.}
<B>__{closer.}
<A>__{david points the remote toward the tv set with an apprehensive look on his face. he winces a little, then pushes one of the buttons.}
<B>__{different angle.}
<A>__{the tv set turns on. oprah's face fills the screen as an angry housewife screams at a transvestite!}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{hunh.}
<A>__{it ail seems normal as he pushes another button. this time the channel changes.}
<C>__{david }
<P>__{(relaxing)}
<D>__{great.}
<A>__{he continues to press the button, flipping through the channels. jennifer sees that everything is fine and reaches for the remote.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{lemme see that.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{no way.}
<A>__{he continues to flip through the channels, coming to rest on the pleasantville marathon. bud's voice fills the room.}

<P>__{(on tv)}
<D>__{gee whizz, mary sue why can't i borrow your transistor radio?}
<C>__{mary sue }
<P>__{(on tv)}
<D>__{i promised betty jane she could use it over the weekend.}
<A>__{full shot. tv set. "pleasantville" (black and white) bud and mary sue clutch either end of a small transistor radio. they seem to be in the exact same position as david and jennifer, who are struggling over the remote control.}
<B>__{angle. david and jennifer.}
<A>__{she tugs the remote while david yanks in the other direction.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{do you mind. this is like the most important moment of my whole life.}
<C>__{david}

<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{you get lost!}
<B>__{wider. living room.}
<A>__{she tugs at the remote trying to wrestle it out of his hands. david pulls in the opposite direction as they point it}
<B>__{directly toward the tv. different angle. special effect.}
<A>__{a huge white light emanates from the contraption, like their own atomic blast wave. the entire room is filled with a blinding aura for a second or two, before it actually gets sucked into the tv.}
<B>__{wide angle. living room.}
<A>__{it is suddenly empty illuminated only by the soft glow of the picture tube. david and jennifer are nowhere in sight.}
