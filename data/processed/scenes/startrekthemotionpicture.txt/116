<A>__{where we see, behind the translucent stall door, what is unmistakably the form of the nude female.}
<L>__{interior ilia's cabin kirk}
<A>__{entering, spock slightly behind him and one security guard. kirk glances around the room, now glances at the shower area and reacts as he sees the naked form. the others react similarly, even spock cannot help re pressing an expression of surprise. a moment's uncer tainty as kirk peers at them, then he steps to the stall door, hesitates another instant then slides the door open . (note: arrange lighting for bizarre, mysterious effect.) kirk's eyes cannot believe what he is seeing: "ilia" standing in the sonic mist , naked but for a small multi colored button embedded in her throat . as she looks at kirk and the others the men peer back at her, speechless.}
<D>__{"ilia" i have been programmed by v'ger to observe and record normal functioning of the carbon based units infesting uss enterprise.}
<A>__{kirk peers at her another nonplussed moment, then leans into the shower to touch a control, his eyes fixed on the lovely body behind the mist. he punches in a three digit code. immediately a humming sound emanates from the shower stall, kirk closing the door, but 'ilia" remaining inside.}
<B>__{across kirk and the others to the shower stall}
<A>__{the humming sound just now reaching a gentle crescendo through the translucent door you can see colors enveloping "ilia's" form. and now the sound stops. "ilia", attired in a leisure robe, steps from the stall, into the room. she stands facing kirk, her face impas sive, eyes unblinking. he looks her back a moment, then glances at spock, who is gazing at "ilia" in abso lute fascination. kirk addresses her:}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{who is...'v'ger'...? "ilia" v'ger is that which programmed me.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{is v'ger the captain of the alien vessel?}
<A>__{angle on the door mccoy rushing in, concerned:}
<D>__{mccoy jim, what's }
<A>__{at the sight of 'ilia", mccoy's words die in his throat and his trained eyes have instantly told him some thing is awry. he unslings his tricorder, aims the sensor unit at "ilia". as he reads his instruments, his face reveals the results (incredulity, fascination). meanwhile, from the start:}
<D>__{"ilia" v'ger is that which seeks the creator. mccoy}
<P>__{(of "ilia")}
<D>__{jim, this is a mechanism...!}
<A>__{kirk stares at mccoy, then at "ilia" and realizes that "ilia" is indeed non human. and quickly:}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{where is lt. ilia? "ilia" that unit no longer functions. i have been given its form to more readily communicate with the carbon based units infesting enterprise.}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{"carbon based units"...? mccoy}
<P>__{(drily)}
<D>__{humans, ensign lang: us .}
<P>__{(continues tricorder}
<D>__{exam, increasingly}
<P>__{impressed)}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(to "ilia")}
<D>__{why does v'ger travel to the third planet of the solar system directly ahead? "ilia" v'ger travels to the third planet to find the creator.}
<A>__{stunned, disbelieving reactions as all four attempt to digest this spock gazing at "ilia" with even more rapt fascination. kirk, bewildered, addresses the others:}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{find the creator? what creator? whose ...!?}
<P>__{(to "ilia")}
<D>__{what does v'ger want of the 'creator'... ? "ilia" to join with him.}
<B>__{favoring spock}
<A>__{suddenly alert, addressing "ilia":}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{join with the creator... ? how? "ilia" v'ger and the creator will become one.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{who is the creator? mccoy}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{mr. spock, be careful. "ilia" the creator is that which created v'ger.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{who is v'ger? "ilia" v'ger is that which seeks the creator.}
<A>__{another moment of total exasperation, frustration, during which "ilia" seems to be waiting politely, patiently for any further questions. when none are forthcoming:}
<D>__{"ilia"}
<P>__{(continuing; pleasant, bland)}
<D>__{i am ready to commence my observations.}
<C>__{spock}
<P>__{(fast; to mccoy)}
<D>__{doctor, a thorough examination of this probe might provide some insight into those who manufactured it, and how to deal with them. mccoy let's get her to sickbay.}
<A>__{and he grasps "ilia's" arm to escort her. but is as though he has seized cast iron: immovable. mccoy is thrown off balance merely by 'ilia's" remaining sta tionary. she ignores mccoy, addresses kirk:}
<D>__{"ilia" i am programmed to observe and record normal functioning procedures of the carbon based units.}
<A>__{kirk glances at mccoy, who is totally bemused, but then kirk quickly responds to "ilia":}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{the examination is a normal function. "ilia"}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{you may proceede. mccoy}
<P>__{(carefully)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{close shot of examining room viewer (o) scanning a "body". pull back to show mccoy, chapel, kirk, spock and chekov standing over "ilia" who lies prone on the table, the physicians moving the scanner over her.}
<D>__{mccoy}
<P>__{(from the start; indicating)}
<D>__{... micro miniature hydraulics, sensors, molecule sized multi processor chips... and look at this ...}
<A>__{in the b.g., decker enters , grimly observes the proceed ings.}
<C>__{chapel}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{an osmotic micro pump... here and here. even the smallest body functions are exactly duplicated.}
<P>__{(traces with finger on screen)}
<D>__{and every exocrine system is here, too }
<A>__{chapel breaks off abruptly, noticing "ilia" is peering intently almost with a glimmer of recognition at decker . slightly disconcerted, chapel continues:}
<C>__{chapel}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{ even eye moisture. "ilia"}
<P>__{(peering at decker)}
<D>__{deck er.}
<B>__{favoring spock}
<A>__{as everyone reacts to "ilia's" utterance of decker's name. it seems to make the deepest impression on spock, confirming something he has suspected.}
<C>__{spock}
<P>__{(to "ilia")}
<D>__{interesting. not 'decker unit'?}
<A>__{"ilia" continues peering at decker with just a hint of a puzzled frown, a glimmer of distant recognition. it's the first time we've seen her expression look anything but cool and bland. this results in the quizzical rising of one of spock's eyebrows.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{mccoy's examination now turns "ilia" away from the others. spock quickly catches kirk's and decker's attention, indicates an adjoining door they fol low him out of the room.}
