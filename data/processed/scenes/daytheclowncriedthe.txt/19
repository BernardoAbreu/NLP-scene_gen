<L>__{interior the apartment night}
<A>__{standing at the window looking out is a beautiful woman, simply dressed, no make up and clean; she has the look of a woman who has just bathed and one could almost smell the fragrance of bath oil on her body. she is tense and concerned. she sees something and moves toward the door and opens it. there is a beat and finally the o.s. sounds of feet scuffling get to the door. it is helmut, fairly crocked at this pointerior}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{helmut, darling, are you all right?}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(nastily)}
<D>__{do i look like i'm not all right?}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{i was so worried about you... your dinner is cold and i couldn't imagine what happened to you...}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{were you really worried about me or your stupid dinner was getting cold?}
<A>__{ada is hurt by this, but knows something is really chewing away at him... and deals with it even more tenderly, which only digs in deeper on helmut.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{sweetheart, i care about you... i love you... i worry about you... i can't help those feelings...}
<A>__{during the above helmut is at the small bar in the living room pouring another "blast" and gulps it down... he hears the words but tries to ignore them.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{if there is anything i don't need right now... it's your super sentimentality...}
<A>__{he flops down in the armchair and stares straight ahead... again, ada is hurt by his blasting her, but she's wise enough to know this isn't the man she loves... she has to get what's eating him out of there.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{helmut... what's tormenting your soul? please let me help you... talk to me... i don't care what it is... i love you... i'm your friend... you can trust me to understand...}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{i can't trust anybody... i don't know how to trust anybody...}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{i'm not anybody! i'm your wife!}
<A>__{helmut, hearing these words, looks up at her and sees the beauty in her eyes, and he is affected by this. he stands up and takes her in his arms... almost breaking her in two.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{i'm sorry, my love... i'm so sorry... you're right! you're not anybody. you're my wife and i love you, too... so very much i just have no one to fight back at... i'm lost and alone, i can't handle the disgrace of failure... the pain of being a has been is more than i can bear...}
<A>__{ada knows now what's happened.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{schmidt again? gustav again? when will you learn they fear you and they know how vulnerable you are now... if they can beat you down then they needn't worry about you coming back to haunt them.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{they worry about me? don't be ridiculous... they just took the last comic bit away from me... because of a silly accident... i'm now down at the bottom, just a stooge assisting a not so funny clown.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{but they can't take your talent away... that's your strongest force!}
<A>__{walking away from her, getting angry again...}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{what the hell are you talking about? what talent? and if i had any it's being suffocated into nothing... and that's just what i am now... nothing... no one... just empty... a prop to be used and mis used... how does my great talent stand up to those odds?}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{by not quitting... you must fight! creative survival is even more difficult than human survival... you must fight!!!}
<A>__{helmut gets quiet and listens, and it makes sense... ada knows she's got him now.}
<C>__{ada}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{go to schmidt... force a confrontation... don't let gustav win... make schmidt see what an injustice they are imposing on you... please, my love, fight! make your world better by fighting for it... you can do it... i know you can...}
<A>__{helmut hears it all and it sounds so good and right.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{i will go now and see schmidt... i will tell him i won't take any more degradation... i will tell him i am a "clown" not a stooge... a "clown"... a special person... a special clown...}
<A>__{ada happily gets his hat.}
<C>__{ada}
<P>__{(placing the hat on his head)}
<D>__{go, my love... go and fight for what you know is right... i will warm your dinner and wait for you to come home.}
<A>__{she kisses him, opens the door for him and he goes.}
