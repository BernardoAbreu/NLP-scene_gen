<A>__{close angle on norman standing by the window. he has pulled the curtains very slightly apart, is staring out and down at the motel, his eyes studying the lone figure of lila, who is standing by the truck and looking up at the house. norman studies her, and as her eyes look up at this very window he closes the curtains, turns away. we see the suspicion and fear in his face, the surge of panic and his struggle to contain it. then he goes away. camera remains on window, shooting out and down, and through the frail curtains we can see sam as he comes out of the motel office and joins lila.}
