<A>__{a silent image of young rose walking away from pier 54. the photographers' flashes go off like a battle behind her. she has her hands in her pockets. she stops, feeling something, and pulls out the necklace. she stares at it in amazement. back on keldysh, rose smiles at brock's incomprehension.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{the hardest part about being so poor, was being so rich. but every time i though of selling it, i though of cal. and somehow i always got by without his help. she holds it out over the water. bodine and a couple of the other guys come up behind lovett, reacting to what is in rose's hand.}
<C>__{bodine}
<A>__{holy shit.}
<C>__{lovett}
<A>__{don't drop it rose.}
<C>__{bodine}
<P>__{(a fierce whisper)}
<A>__{rush her.}
<C>__{lovett}
<P>__{(to bodine)}
<A>__{it's hers, you schmuck.}
<P>__{(to her)}
<A>__{look, rose, i... i don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, i know that... but please... think about this a second.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{i have. i came all the way here so this could go back where it belongs. the massive diamond glitters. brock edges closer and holds out his hand...}
<C>__{lovett}
<A>__{just let me hold it in my hand, rose. please. just once. he comes closer to her. it is reminiscent of jack slowly moving up to her at the stern of titanic. surprisingly, she calmly places the massice stone in the palm of his hand, while still holding onto the necklace. lovett gazes at the object of his quest. an infinity of cold scalpels glint in its blue depths. it is mesmerizing. it fits in his hand just like he imagined.}
<C>__{lovett}
<A>__{my god. his grip tightens on the diamond. he looks up, meeting her gaze. her eyes are suddenly infinitely wise and deep.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{you look for treasures in the wrong place, mr. lovett. only life is priceless, and making each day count. his fingers relax. he opens them slowly. gently she slips the diamond out of his hand. he feels it sliding away. then, with an impish little grin, rose tosses the necklace over the rail. lovett gives a strangled cry and rushes to the rail in time to see it hit the water and disappear forever.}
<C>__{bodine}
<A>__{aww!! that really sucks, lady! brock lovett goes through ten changes before he settles on a reaction... he laughs. he laughs until the tears come to his eyes. then he turns to lizzy.}
<C>__{lovett}
<A>__{would you like to dance? lizzy grins at him and nods. rose smiles. she looks up at the stars.}
