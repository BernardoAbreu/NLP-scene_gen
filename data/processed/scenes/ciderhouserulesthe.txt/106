<L>__{exterior cider house rainy day}
<A>__{the rain beats down on olive's car. homer gets soaking wet as he leans in to talk to candy, who's behind the wheel. mr. rose calls to homer from the doorway of the mill room.}
<L>__{interior mill room rainy day}
<A>__{mr. rose is instructing homer as they stand bottling cider in their yellow slickers and rubber boots. rose rose is hosing down the pressboards; muddy and hero and peaches are operating the grinder and the press. jack is stirring the vat. in a defiant, contemptuous way, jack keeps flicking the ash of his cigarette into the vat. this make everyone uncomfortable; only mr. rose doesn't appear to notice.}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{cider don't have no taste till later in october it's too watery now, when we're usin' just them early macs and them gravensteins. you don't get no good cider till you're pickin' them golden delicious and them winter bananas, them baldwins and them russerts...}
<C>__{homer}
<D>__{what about the worms? most of these apples are the drops off the ground, right? there have to be worms.}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{of course there's worms, homer! and what is them worms, really? they just protein, them worms! they is good for you!}
<A>__{everyone but jack laughs. he takes a last drag on his cigarette, then deliberately drops it into the vat.}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{that just ain't right, jack your cigarette's gonna end up in nine or ten gallons of this batch of cider! that ain't right.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{them people drinkin' that cider, they don't know there's a cigarette in there!}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{it's not that hard to find it in there, jack it'll take you just a minute. you just gotta go fishin'.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you mean swimmin'. i ain't goin' in that vat to fish out no cigarette!}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{what business is you in, jack? just tell me what your business is...}
<A>__{jack looks for a translation from the other men, who are nervous.}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{just say you're in the apple business, man. that's the only business you wanna be in. just say it.}
<A>__{jack pulls a knife on mr. rose.}

<P>__{(whispers excitedly to jack)}
<D>__{you don't wanna go in the knife business with mistuh rose just say you're in the apple business, jack!}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to mr. rose)}
<D>__{what business are you in?}
<A>__{we never see mr. rose's knife. we see the men circle each other: jack takes a swipe at mr. rose's head then he steps back, his yellow slicker slashed open. his slicker is opened up, right up the middle. his shirt underneath the slicker is slashed open, too he feels his bare chest and stomach, feeling for the cut. but there's no cut jack's not bleeding, he's not even scratched. just his clothes have been slashed.}
<C>__{mr. rose}
<D>__{i'm in the knife business, jack. you don't wanna go in the knife business with me.}
<A>__{muddy turns jack around and views his slashed clothes.}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{you're lucky he didn't cut your nipples off, man.}
<C>__{peaches}
<D>__{the good news, jack, is you're half undressed for swimmin'...}
<C>__{muddy}
<D>__{yeah, that cigarette ain't hard to find when you're properly undressed.}
<A>__{jack starts to undress for the vat. mr. rose ushers homer and rose rose outside.}
