<A>__{roxanne talks as john cusack listens to her every word intently.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{i did have a boyfriend until fairly recently.}
<A>__{she suddenly begins to feel the stares around her as passers by being to notice who she's with.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{i'm sorry this is so surreal! "john cusack" yeah, they charge way too much at these places now back to your boyfriend. i'm interested and compassionate. i want to know about you.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{things were complicated. he was a man married to his work. there was...there was a lot of competition in his line of business. i'm sure you know what that's like. "john cusack" sure. in my business, one thing i have is rivals. for example, mine is...uh...lou ferr...igno.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{...the body builder who used to play the hulk on tv? "john cusack" did he? well, we're always up for the same roles. did your boyfriend have someone like that? a particular rival that was always getting his goat so to speak?}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{well...one rival in particular seemed to get more of his attention than i ever did. but enough about my problems. "john cusack" no, tell me more!!!}
<A>__{suddenly realizing his outburst, he begins coughing to mask it.}
<P>__{"john cusack" (cont'd)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i got a whooping cough. had it ever since serendipity. i wonder where our refills are!!!}
<P>__{(fakes cough) see, there it goes}
<D>__{again. please, go on.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{right, well, he seemed to need him more than he needed me. "john cusack" how do you mean?}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{it was conflict he thrived on. he always said he wouldn't know what to do with himself if master i mean, this guy were gone. it was like he needed it, like oxygen.}
<A>__{the answer to his mental funk hits him like a bolt of lightening. he turns away from her as if for private time.}
<D>__{"john cusack"}
<P>__{(almost to himself)}
<D>__{i think i finally understand...the only logical answer is to recreate that rivalry or if that's impossible, create one of equal structure. that's it!}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{john cusack snaps out of his dream like haze realizing she's heard every word.}
<D>__{"john cusack" oh, sorry, sorry. just rehearsing for a part...where i play a man who talks to himself at inappropriate times.}
<A>__{in a sudden rush, he rises out of his chair.}
<D>__{"john cusack" i have to go right now, but i'd really like to see you again if that's alright.}
<A>__{roxanne looks up at him she can't help but laugh at the craziness of the situation.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{i'd love that.}
