<D>__{for the time being we are very confident we will apprehend the fugitives in the next forty eight hours. the bureau, local law enforcement and the texas rangers have all joined forces in forming a dragnet to snare seth and richard gecko.}

<D>__{agent chase, does it appear that they are heading for mexico.}
<C>__{stanley chase}
<D>__{yes, it does, kelly. we have already alerted the mexican authorities. they intend to cooperate every way possible in bringing these fugitives to justice.}

<D>__{are you optimistic about the safety of the hostage they took in abilene, gloria hill?}
<C>__{stanley chase}
<D>__{we've received no news one way or the other. we can only hope for the best.}

<D>__{what about the report from an eyewitness at the liquor store who said one of the brothers was shot?}
<C>__{stanley chase}
<D>__{this can't be confirmed at this time, but we do believe it to be true. we have reason to believe it was the youngest brother richard, and he was shot in the vicinity of his neck and shoulders by the store's clerk.}
<C>__{kelly houge}
<D>__{is it safe to assume that because the death count involved and the loss of life of law enforcement officers, that the bureau, the rangers and the police force are taking this manhunt personally?}
<C>__{stanley chase}
<D>__{i would say that's a very safe assumption.}
