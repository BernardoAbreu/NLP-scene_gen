<L>__{interior marsellus wallace's home night}
<A>__{the front door flings open, and mia and vincent dance tango style into the house, singing a cappella the song from the previous scene. they finish their little dance, laughing. then... the two just stand face to face looking at each other.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{was than an uncomfortable silence?}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{i don't know what that was.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{music and drinks!}
<A>__{mia moves away to attend to both. vincent hangs up his overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i'm gonna take a piss.}
<C>__{mia}
<D>__{that was a little bit more information than i needed to know, but go right ahead.}
<A>__{vincent shuffles off to the john. mia moves to her cd player, thumbs through a stack of cds and selects one: k.d. lang. the speakers blast out a high energy country number, which mia plays air guitar to. she dances her way around the room and finds herself by vincent's overcoat hanging on the rack. she touches its sleeve. it feels good. her hand hoes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch. like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco on some rolling paper. imitating what he did earlier, licks the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. maybe a little too fat, but not bad for a first try. mia thinks so anyway. her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out his zippo lighter. she slaps the lighter against her leg, trying to light it fancy style like vince did. what do you know, she did it! mia's one happy clam. she triumphantly brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up, then loudly snaps the zippo closed. the mia made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she takes a long, cool drag. her hand slides the zippo back in the overcoat pocket. but wait, her fingers touch something else. those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder inside, the madman that vincent bought earlier from lance. wearing a big smile, mia brings the bag of heroin up to her face.}

<P>__{(like you would say bingo!)}
<D>__{disco! vince, you little cola nut, you've been holding out on me.}
