<L>__{interior oval office night}
<A>__{kenny enters from his office, finding bobby, rusk and sorensen talking with the president. the president gives him a brief, meaningful look.}
<C>__{rusk}
<D>__{whatever response we send, it will take several hours for the wire to be received by our embassy and delivered to the kremlin. so we're looking at early tomorrow morning at the earliest before khruschev could respond.}
<A>__{as rusk talks, kenny passes close by bobby. bobby whispers:}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{he gets it, but he's pissed.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{that's all well and good, but what do we say to 'em?}
<C>__{sorensen}
<D>__{it depends on if we really believe there's been a coup.}
<A>__{that strikes a cord with kenny.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{i agree. if there has been a coup, and there's a hard line government in power now, then it doesn't matter what we say. the end of the day we'll either agree to their terms, they'll agree to ours, or we'll go to war. but what if there hasn't been a coup? what if... what if what is happening is a series of accidents?}
<C>__{sorensen}
<D>__{the second letter is an accident?}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{no. the letter is an intentional, but it's having an effect far greater than its authors intended.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what if our jupiter missiles are just a last minute haggle to salvage something? maybe a bone khruschev is throwing to the hard line, not really caring if we reject it or not?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and then these accidents have happened.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{making the second letter and the overall picture look worse than it really is.}
<C>__{sorensen}
<D>__{the guns of august.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{exactly.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{if they're sane and human like we are, then maybe we just refuse, and they'll let it slide, like we've been letting things slide.}
<C>__{sorensen}
<D>__{so we reject the second letter.}
<A>__{and kenny looks at bobby. the world stops.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{no. we don't reject it...}
<A>__{it hits bobby like a lightning bolt.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{... we accept the first letter and pretend the second doesn't exist.}
<A>__{the president, rusk and sorensen stare at him, mute.}
<D>__{interior cabinet room night}
<A>__{hold on the exact same mute reaction from the entire assembled excom. finally mccone breaks the spell.}
<C>__{mccone}
<D>__{it won't work }
<A>__{bobby, kenny and sorensen start to object, but mccone raises his voice over theirs.}
<C>__{mccone }
<D>__{ because it's wishful thinking! it's the same wishful thinking that blinded us all these months while the soviets were sneaking those missiles in under our noses!}
<A>__{mcnamara shakes his head, intrigued but skeptical.}
<C>__{mcnamara}
<D>__{ignore the second letter, agree to the conditions of the first...}
<C>__{general taylor}
<D>__{there's no reason to believe the soviets will let it go.}
<C>__{rusk}
<D>__{max is right. why will they accept it?}
<C>__{mcnamara}
<D>__{it can work. if, if they believe we'll hit them.}
<A>__{kenny, bobby and sorensen look at mcnamara, grateful.}
<C>__{mcnamara }
<D>__{we've only got time for one more round of diplomacy. the first airstrikes start in less than 36 hours.}
<C>__{rusk}
<D>__{but we have to make them agree to it. so how do we do that?}
<A>__{the president leans forward. sensing he's about to speak, all eyes turn to him.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{we give them something. we tell them we'll remove the missiles from turkey say, six months from now so that there appears to be no linkage. we also tell them if they go public about it, we deny it and the deal is off.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{and we do it under the table so we can disavow any knowledge of it.}
<C>__{mccone}
<D>__{it's transparent. the press'll be all over it.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{six months from now, i'm not going to care. are you? we'll deal with it.}
<C>__{mcnamara}
<D>__{at least it will expose whether khruschev has been overthrown. we'll know what we're dealing with.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{and if this is a move to appease the hard line, then it may just be the bone he needs to regain control of his own house.}
<A>__{most excom is nodding, agreeing. mccone shakes his head in disgust. taylor sits in silence.}
<C>__{rusk}
<D>__{whoever carries the message has to hit the nail on the head. come across as too soft, they'll push us. too hard, they'll be cornered and even more dangerous.}
<C>__{mccone}
<D>__{they could pre empt.}
<A>__{it's a terrible responsibility to bear. the room is silent. at last bobby looks up from his folded hands to his brother. the president stares back. there is nobody else who can do this. only bobby. his brother.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{bobby. you know dobrynin best.}
<A>__{bobby nods, taking up the gauntlet.}
<C>__{the president }
<D>__{ted, you get working on the draft.}
<A>__{sorensen and bobby rise as one, head for the doors.}
<C>__{the president }
<D>__{and make sure he knows we have to have an answer tomorrow.}
<P>__{(beat, final)}
<D>__{because on monday we begin military action against cuba.}
<A>__{bobby and kenny exchange a look.}
