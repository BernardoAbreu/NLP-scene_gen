<A>__{camera tracks up the seemingly endless length of the hypnospire up, up, through a heavy layer of clouds, to the rotating penthouse dome of the building... ...which is festooned with oodles of 18 inch dss satellite dishes.}
<L>__{interior hyp's hideaway night}
<A>__{elevator doors open, and we glide into the swank, swingin', space age bachelor pad of hypnos, god of sleep. a giant flying cupid welcomes us, tiny bumblebee wings somehow keeping his vast bulk aloft. hyp's hideaway occupies the entire penthouse floor, and there's always a party in full effect. a rotating disco ball flashes colored light on walls, floors, and ceilings covered with shockadelic op art patterns.}

<A>__{of course, a party needs party animals and the darktowners on the scene are in fine fettle, working up a sweat on the dance floor. dj sleepy zzz's has three turntables spinning at once. as stu wanders through, he gets a big surprise. reproductions of his old nightmare paintings are hanging on the walls! they've been turned into one sheets for the coming attractions at the morpheum.}

<D>__{y'call that art? why, my three year old can paint better than that.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{like you'd know. you started out on the back of a napkin, you little...doodle.}
<A>__{scowling at each other, the boys turn their backs and part ways. we follow monkeybone to the wet bar, where he almost immediately bumps into a statuesque gorgon with a full head of writhing snakes.}

<D>__{hey! like the do. so tell me, are you a, uhh... natural snakehead?}
<C>__{gorgon}
<D>__{only fifty dollars to find out.}
<C>__{monkeybone}
<D>__{fifty dollars?! bite me!}
<C>__{gorgon}
<D>__{you got it, big boy.}
<A>__{he grins and shrugs: what the hell. as they head for a back room, the bartender hands him a snakebite kit. a look of apprehension crosses monkeybone's face. but before he can change his mind, the gorgon's hand yanks him out of frame. stu, meanwhile, is crossing the dance floor, moving among glittering animal people who dance in their bizarre, uninhibited way. a five legged woman the bottom half of her body a big human hand smiles at stu as he passes. he tries to talk to her, but she's dancing, and with five constantly moving legs it's difficult to get in close.}

<C>__{hand woman}
<D>__{hyp? he was here a while ago. aren't you stu miley? the nightmare guy?}
<A>__{stu grins meekly, nods yes. she pulls him over to dance.}
<C>__{hand woman}
<D>__{i heard you were going to be here tonight. this is so cool!}
<A>__{jumbo the elephant god is dancing in ungainly fashion nearby. his trunk swings out and hits one of the hand woman's arms which snaps off like marble statuary. before she can let out a squeal, he does it again. now she's armless a regular venus de milo!}

<A>__{she leads him over to the sunken living room. among the other guests, we see a cyclops, a yeti, a bbq pig. a number of sofas and lounge chairs are arranged around a big crystal orb in the center of the room. the orb is where nightmares happen. although the perspective shifts and the locales change abruptly, as in a movie, all the nightmares have a}
