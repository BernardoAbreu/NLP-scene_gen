<L>__{interior lab later night}
<A>__{jean, storm, beast and cyclops talk while the news plays silently on the tv in the background.}
<C>__{beast}
<D>__{it appears as though magneto has built a machine which somehow triggers the mutator gene in normal human beings. and he is using adamantium as its core.}
<C>__{cyclops}
<D>__{its core?}
<A>__{beast grabs a wax pen and draws a lightbulb on a glass drawing board.}
<C>__{beast}
<D>__{thomas edison knew how to make the light bulb. he had the energy source. he had the vacuum. but he didnit have the filament. he tried metal after metal but nothing would hold to power.}
<C>__{storm}
<P>__{(nods now understanding)}
<D>__{... until he found tungsten.}
<A>__{beast finishes his lightbulb by drawing the filament.}
<C>__{beast}
<D>__{correct... apparently, adamantium is the only metal strong enough to hold the energy this machine produces. he used the adamantium in logan's dog tag to test it on the senator. and i assume now he plans to use the rest of logan's skeleton for a larger demonstration.}
<C>__{cyclops}
<D>__{for what purpose?}
<C>__{beast}
<D>__{yes only thereis a problem. the mutator gene is not responding to the radiation the way it would in mother nature. itis forcing the bodyis cells to replicate thousands of times faster than theyire accustomed to. the senatoris body is literally burning itself out. scott this machine kills people and i donit think magneto realizes it.}
<C>__{cyclops}
<D>__{so where do you think heis planning this larger demonstration?}
<A>__{jean looks down and sees xavier pointing with a trembling hand, trying to speak. xavier is pointing to the television.}
<C>__{xavier}
<D>__{there...}
<A>__{he is looking at yet another report on ellis island. cyclops and jean walk over. all they see on the tv is an aerial shot of manhattan, slowly coming around toward the harbor. the television image is from the p.o.v. of a helicopter circling ellis island, taking in all the security and construction. the grand main hall to ellis island and finally, what the helicopter sees as it comes around for one more pass. suddenly the sound of kellyis heart monitor begins to pick up speed. jean rushes to kelly and touches his pale neck. she draws her hand back quickly as if burned. the heart monitor keeps speeding up until it is racing faster than a human heart could possibly produce. jean backs away helplessly. the sheet that covers kellyis body begins to flatten out. the sweat covering the hapless senatoris body thickens into a viscous, clear liquid and begins to run off the table. kelly is literally melting away. cyclops holds jean as she turns away. angle on: the tv the gathering leaders of the world, the water clogged with boats, and the thousands of onlookers on manhattan island. all well within range.}
