<L>__{interior orphanage night}
<A>__{the children huddle in their cots under tattered, thin blankets. anya is fully dressed, illuminated by the light of a full moon, she ties a dull gray sheets together and anchors the "rope" to an ice cold radiator and throws the other end out of the window. she is about to climb out when she looks at the sleeping children and smiles sadly. she walks over to gregor's bed and puts one hand lovingly on his head and then reaches over and takes the hand of a sleeping little girl, who opens her eyes and smiles.}
