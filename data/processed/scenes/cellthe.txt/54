<L>__{interior campbell center laboratory day}
<A>__{cooperman guides novak and ramsey into the lab. the fbi men are impressed, but neither is quite sure what to make it all. the fbi escort team leader gets ramsey's signature and novak undoes the cuffs from stargher's wrists and ankles. following miriam's direction, the escorts guide the gurney carrying stargher into the procedure room. as cooperman shows them out, henry seals shut the door. miriam assumes responsibility for stargher's care and checks his pulse, iv, pupil dilation, and vital signs...}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{shouldn't we get a catheter in him?}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{they took care of that, thank you, henry.}
<P>__{(getting him out of her hair)}
<C>__{miriam }
<D>__{why don't you give our guests a little tour?}
<A>__{proud of his computer, but uncomfortable around strangers, henry directs novak and ramsey to the console.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{gentlemen, you stand before the one and only neurological cartography and synaptic transfer system.}
<A>__{although he's listening, novak's eyes never really stray from his prisoner as miriam uses safety scissors to cut away stargher's clothes.}
<C>__{henry }
<D>__{it provides a highly detailed map of the human mind. not the brain any mri can do that. the mind.}
<P>__{(self impressed)}
<D>__{it reads and processes electronically allowing information to be transferred and interrupted.}
<P>__{(for the laymen)}
<D>__{let's say your thoughts could be stored on dvd. if someone had the right kind of player, they could watch and listen to what you're thinking.}
<A>__{novak observes miriam as she "undresses" stargher and ramsey pokes around the lab.}
<C>__{henry }
<D>__{but we can't record or store the data. the connections between nerve cells are constantly being modified.}
<A>__{miriam needs a moment to fully take in the scars. henry continues, eager to focus attention back to him, but even he is fascinated by stargher's skin.}
<C>__{henry }
<D>__{it's like the early days of television. the subject sends out a live feed and you receive it during time of broadcast. whatever happens, happens. all you have to do is "tune in."}
<A>__{miriam gives stargher an alcohol bath, the clinical procedure taking on the quality of ritual. her wash cloth moves under stargher's chin and over his face. she's careful around the eyes and finds herself unable to look at them for long.}
<C>__{henry }
<D>__{but you do more than tune in... you become part of the snow.}
<A>__{catherine enters from a dressing area wearing the bodysuit. filled with curiosity, novak watches miriam and catherine fit stargher into his suit.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{i still don't understand why i can't do this... this isn't some "troubled kid" you're dealing with.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i realize that...}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{how hard could it be...?}
<A>__{catherine and miriam try to hide their laughter.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{the first... what? six or seven times i went in. remember what happened?}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{disorientation, nausea, migraines, hallucinations, insomnia, paranoia.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{like a new year's day hangover.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{he needs to be turned over.}
<A>__{novak and catherine roll stargher onto his stomach.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{this man is deeply disturbed, he...}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{you don't know the procedure.}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{i know him.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{that may be true, but you don't have catherine's gift. she...}
<P>__{(distracted by stargher's back)}
<D>__{what happened here?}
<A>__{we see a series of eight bandages.}
<C>__{ramsey}
<D>__{we removed eight metal rings.}
<A>__{miriam peels away a bandage and examines the flesh.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{then he should like this.}
<A>__{catherine connects stargher to the suspension apparatus and it hoists him off the table.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{they're comforted by the feeling of weightlessness. like floating in water.}
<A>__{henry catches ramsey poking his nose near a third suit and apparatus in the dressing area.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{don't touch that, please.}
<C>__{ramsey}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{miriam prepares a series of chemical cartridges and loads them into a container connected to the iv like tubes linked to the suspension device.}
<C>__{miriam}
<P>__{(intimate, quiet)}
<D>__{this isn't your responsibility. remember that. don't let them use guilt as a tool. if you want to stop, say so.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i will be fine.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{she said convincingly.}
<A>__{catherine focuses on the procedure and makes the necessary connections. reluctantly, miriam retreats to the monitoring station. she "locks down" the procedure room and joins henry, novak, and ramsey at the console.}
<C>__{novak}
<P>__{(eyes on the chemical drug monitors)}
<D>__{that's the stuff?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{about twelve years of research, right miriam?}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{don't remind me.}
<C>__{ramsey}
<D>__{what is it are they exactly?}
<A>__{that's like asking her to explain the rules of cricket.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{psychostimulants, serotonin, stabilizers, meprobamate, neurontin, lithium carbonate. and my baby. it duplicates and expands upon the effects of a chemical called oxytocin, forcing a break in the neuron connections that hold experience. so new experience can form.}
<A>__{ramsey is utterly lost and just sort of nods, but novak is fascinated. catherine presses the bump on her hand. a red indicator light flashes on.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{there's a touch sensitive microchip implanted in her hand. if she becomes frightened, disoriented, or simply wants to end the session, she signals us to abort.}
<A>__{catherine presses again and the red light shuts off.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{although none of what she experiences is real, she can be tricked into thinking it is. the mind is awfully gullible, so she needs to monitor herself.}
<A>__{catherine and stargher are suspended from the ceiling. henry types and the lights dim to a more somber, tranquil level. various screens flicker to life, displaying the vital signs of both "feed" and receive." miriam initiates the injection program.}
<C>__{miriam }
<D>__{catherine? i'm about to start. if you want me to wait, or...}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{no. no.}
<A>__{in the procedure room, we see chemicals mix with her blood, then feed the iv. at the console, as henry types furiously at the computer keyboard, novak asks miriam:}
<C>__{novak}
<D>__{you said she has a "gift."}
<A>__{overhearing, henry interrupts, pointing at a section of catherine's "mind map."}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{not a gift. a highly evolved area in her cerebral cortex, that's all. a genetic fluke.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{catherine has a tremendous capacity for empathy.}
<P>__{(clarifies)}
<D>__{when we started, there were a number of test subjects other therapists who acted as "receivers." all they did was observe and report. nothing more. but catherine, she had the ability to feel what was happening. she understood. and the patient responded. edward engaged her in dialogue, took her places, showed her things. he knew she cared.}
<A>__{a hopeful, solemn novak gazes through the window, watching catherine's body as it becomes parallel to stargher's... in the procedure room, catherine takes a deep breath and as the drugs take effect, feels herself losing consciousness. she glances at stargher, a man who tortures and kills women, then looks up as the cloth mask descends from the ceiling.}
<D>__{miriam (o.s.) (cont'd) intravenous administration complete.}
<C>__{henry }
<D>__{initiating connection.}
<A>__{we follow fibrous wires running from catherine's mask to stargher's. their blood mixing with chemicals in the iv like containers. the computer system humming.}
<D>__{henry (o.s.) (cont'd) transfer begins 1100 hours, 34 minutes, 12 seconds.}
<A>__{catherine's eye focuses on the mask. as it comes closer, we see the lining is laced with thread like wires and microchips forming hyper miniature circuit boards. catherine's eye blinks. the mask covers her face. catherine's eye shuts. vision fades. darkness. a faint light. microscopic veins in the eyelid become wires connected to chips. and we're moving, into the circuitry.}
