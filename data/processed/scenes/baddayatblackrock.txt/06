<L>__{exterior station platform}
<A>__{with the train stationary before it. a sleek steel door of a pullman clangs open. a colored porter carrying a suitcase walks down the wrought iron steps. he is stately, gray haired and lean, with the almost finical tidiness travelers associate with trainmen. the man behind him is big shouldered, a granite like wedge of a man with calm, piercing eyes. there is about him an air of monumental dependability and quiet humor, but his eyes are those of a man who has lately lived in somber familiarity with pain. his left arm hangs from his shoulder with that lifeless rigidity of paralysis, while the hand is hidden in his pocket. another angle macreedy and porter the porter puts the suitcase on the platform. in the distance the town and its people are seen staring silently, motionlessly. the big man glances toward them. he smiles a sad, distasteful greeting to the town, its wretched dust. its mean, modest buildings. the porter disappears into the train as the conductor enters scene. he turns slowly, following macreedy's gaze...}
<C>__{conductor}
<P>__{(softly, staring at the towns people)}
<D>__{man. they look woebegone and far away.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{i will only be here twenty four hours.}
<C>__{conductor}
<D>__{in a place like this, it could be a lifetime.}
<P>__{(turning to face macreedy)}
<D>__{good luck, mr. macreedy.}
<A>__{macreedy nods his thanks. the conductor signals the engineer (o.s.) and steps on the train. the diesel's claxon blasts the torrid air ominously. the train slowly, smoothly, begins to move, picking up speed. the cars slip past until, quite suddenly, the streamliner is gone. for a moment macreedy watches it. then, quite unconsciously, he takes a package of cigarettes from his left hand pocket, taps the last one free of the pack, sticks it between his lips and, crumpling the empty pack, drops it beside the tracks. he takes a cardboard book of matches, flicks it open, bends a match in half with agile fingers, and with a sure frictional motion scrapes the head against the sandpaper guard. the match flares, the cigarette is lit. macreedy inhales, exhales deeply, and turns to pick up his suitcase. then he sees hastings, who walks slowly, almost painfully, to him. his adam's apple grapples protestingly with his collar. after a moment he controls it sufficiently to talk...}
<C>__{hastings}
<D>__{you for black rock?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(easily)}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{hastings}
<P>__{(uneasily)}
<D>__{there must be some mistake. i'm hastings, the telegraph agent. nobody told me the train was stopping.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(with a ghost of a grin)}
<D>__{they didn't?}
<C>__{hastings}
<P>__{(upset)}
<D>__{i just said they didn't, and they ought to. what i want to know, why didn't they?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{probably didn't think it was important.}
<C>__{hastings}
<D>__{important?! it's the first time the streamliner stopped here in four years.}
<P>__{(swallowing nervously)}
<D>__{you being met? you visiting folks or something? i mean, whatd'ya want?}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{i want to go to adobe flat. any cabs available?}
<C>__{hastings}
<P>__{(as if he hadn't heard}
<D>__{right; as if he wanted everyone in town to}
<P>__{know)}
<D>__{adobe flat?!}
<P>__{(he gulps, recovers slightly)}
<D>__{no cabs.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{where's the hotel?}
<A>__{hastings looks at him blankly. the thousand yard stare of a hypnotic glazes his features.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<P>__{(patiently)}
<D>__{i asked where's the hotel?}
<A>__{hastings points.}
<C>__{macreedy}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{with his suitcase, he cuts across a weedy path, running into black rock's single street. for a moment, hastings stares after him; then he breaks hurriedly, entering telegraph agent's shack.}
