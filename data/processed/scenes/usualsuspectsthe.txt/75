<D>__{that was how i ended up in a barber shop quartet in skokie, illinois.}
<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{this is totally irrelevant.}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{oh, but it's not. if i hadn't been nailed in illinois for running a three card monte in between sets, i never would have took off for new york. i never would have met keaton, see. that barber shop quartet was the reason for everything.}
<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{can we just get back to kobayashi?}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{the quartet is part of the bit about kobayashi. the quartet was in my file, along with every other thing i had done since high school, see? aliases, middle men. they knew me better than i did. they knew all of us.}
<A>__{kujan looks at his watch.}
<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{you're stalling, verbal.}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{give a guy a break, huh?}
<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{what happened?}
<A>__{verbal slumps a bit. he realizes his stalling tactic has failed.}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{we woke up the next morning and fenster was gone. he couldn't handle the idea of slumming for soze. he left a note wishing us good luck and took a chunk of the money we'd scraped together.}
<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{then what?}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{mcmanus was furious. he was talking about tracking him down and ripping his heart out and all sorts of shit. that night we got the call.}
<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{what call?}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{kobayashi told us where we could find fenster.}
