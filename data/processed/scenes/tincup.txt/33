<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{am i early?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{mr. mcavoy, i can appreciate that you have a fairly laid back, relaxed lifestyle but i have hours to keep.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{a former paramour once ascribed my fluid sense of time to being born under the sign of pisces something about floating through the universe }
<A>__{he tees a ball for her and steps back. she's staring at him, half amused.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{you amuse me, roy. but i'm the only woman in america born after world war ii who thinks astrology is a crock of shit.}

<D>__{waggle.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{i'm waggling...}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{set up to the ball like i showed you last time.}
<A>__{molly addresses the shot. her stance is rigid, overly mechanical. tin cup winces. but she looks terrific.}

<D>__{quit trying to wring that club's neck, molly. show it a little warmth and compassion...}
<A>__{he moves around behind her to reposition her shoulders.}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{remember, this game's about trust and touch and letting go. so while i'm subtly enhancing your technical prospects, why don't you tell me all about your personal life...}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{it's none of your fucking business, roy.}
<A>__{tin cup's hands move down to square her hips. he's discreet and professional.}

<C>__{molly}
<P>__{(to simms)}
<D>__{hi, sweetie...}
<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{not him...}
