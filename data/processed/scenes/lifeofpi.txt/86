<A>__{pi removes all of the lifejackets from under the life ring, stacking them onto his latest raft structure. the empty banana netting now drapes beneath the raft; pi notices that dorado are attracted to the net and gets an idea. one of the dorados gets very close to the net pi realizes his opportunity. he hauls in the netting and wrestles the dorado onto the raft, flailing against the creature's strength and throwing his full weight onto the creature to keep it from sliding back into the ocean, riding it like a bucking bronco. pi grabs a hatchet from the raft and strikes the fish over and over again. as the fish begins to die, it flashes all kinds of colors in rapid succession blue, green, red, gold and violet flicker and shimmer neon like on its surface. pi starts back, watching this colorful display in terrified wonder. finally, the fish ebbs to grey, lifeless.}

<A>__{pi is devastated. he weeps, bringing his hands together, pressing them against his forehead, murmuring a prayer to himself and bowing over the dead fish in abject grief.}

<D>__{thank you, lord vishnu. thank you for coming in the form of a fish and saving our lives. thank you...}
