<L>__{interior cathy's office day}
<A>__{we hear the strains of the theme of a past hit movie coming from cathy's cassette player. a rack of soundtracks clearly visible. cathy is frowning as she reads the last of the galley pages. she overhears some conversation in the adjoining room which begins to disturb her concentration.}
<C>__{female d person }
<D>__{i'm not supposed to read tv pilots. don't call us d girls. we're development persons!}
<A>__{cathy closes the door, shutting her off. she now begins to fill out a form with a felt tipped pen. as she does so, the pad is supered on the screen action seen through it. as she writes, we see the notations on the super. it is marked coverage confidential from: cathy breslow. to: burke adler. subject: (the pen writes out) "little dick" genre category (the pen writes out action adventure). then there are columns to check excellent, good, fair, poor for the story. characters, dialogue... the pen checks fair for story, poor for all else, character, dialogue, etc. the form then states check one of the following sentences:}
<B>__{i do not recommend this project i recommend this project i strongly recommend this project}
<A>__{i'd stake my all on this project i'd gladly stake my all on this project the phone rings. as she picks it up and reaches to turn down the volume of the motion picture soundtrack she's listening to.}
<C>__{cathy}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{hi. i just finished. i will have my coverage right over. it's past derivative... it's photocopying. what a hoot! you're kidding, right? there is truly active bidding for this book? really? 2.3 million? okay, see you.}
<A>__{she hangs up and begins to alter the form changing the story poor to story excellent, and all the other poors to good... and now the recommend section.}
<B>__{insert}
<A>__{the pen is poised.}
<B>__{on cathy}
<A>__{her soul is poised. a beat and she allows "i do not recommend" to stand, the source music theme "chariots of fire" coincidentally celebrates this considerable act of heroism. cathy takes the sheet and walks to the door.}
