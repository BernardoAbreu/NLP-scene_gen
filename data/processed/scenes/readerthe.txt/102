<L>__{interior courtroom. mannheim. day}
<A>__{rohl is leaning forward, attentive. hanna is standing, opposite the judge, who holds up a book called mother & daughter : a story of survival.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{miss schmitz, you're familiar with this book...}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{yes...}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{parts of it have already been read out in court.}
<C>__{judge }
<D>__{it's an american publication, which has been translated. it's by a survivor, a prisoner who survived, ilana mather...}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{yes i know. i know ilana mather.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{she was in the camp, wasn't she, when she was a child? she was with her mother.}
<A>__{the judge waits. hanna seems arrogant, defiant.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{in the book, she describes a selection process. at the end of the month's labour, every month, sixty inmates were selected. they were picked out to be sent from the satellite camp back to auschwitz. that's right, isn't it?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{yes, it's right.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{and so far, each of your fellow defendants has specifically denied being part of that process. now i'm going to ask you. were you part of it?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{there is a stir among the other defendants and in the court. they start talking to their lawyers.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{so you helped make the selection?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{you admit that? then tell me, how did that selection happen?}
<A>__{hanna shrugs slightly, as though it were obvious.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{there were six guards, so we decided we'd choose ten people each. that's how we did it every month. we'd all choose ten.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{are you saying your fellow defendants took part in the process?}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{we all did.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{even though they've denied it? but you admit it. you're saying you took part in the process.}
<A>__{the other defendants stir with animosity, but the judge is intent, following his own line.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{did you not realise you were sending these women to their deaths?}
<A>__{he waits. hanna nods slightly.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{yes but there were new arrivals, new women were arriving all the time, so of course we had to move some of the old ones on.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{i'm not sure you understand...}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{we couldn't keep everyone. there wasn't room.}
<A>__{the judge frowns, genuinely surprised that she doesn't seem to understand his pointerior}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{no, but what i'm saying : let me rephrase : to make room, you were picking women out and saying `you you and you have to be sent back to be killed.'}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{well, what would you have done?}
<A>__{hanna is looking at the judge a perfectly straight question. michael smiles slightly, proud of her. everyone in the court waits for the judge to answer. silence. rohl is impassive. but hanna follows her own thoughts. she quietly asks herself a question.}
<C>__{hanna}
<D>__{so should i never have signed up at siemens?}
