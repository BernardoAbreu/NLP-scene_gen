<C>__{keating}
<D>__{there it is.}

<A>__{mr. nolan looks out at them from his office as keating joins the boys and begins marching with them.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{left, left, left right left. left, left, left right left. left, halt!}
<A>__{the boys come to a halt.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{thank you, gentlemen. if you noticed, everyone started off with their own stride, their own pace.}
<A>__{keating begins walking very slowly.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{mr. pitts, taking his time. he knew he'll get there one day. mr. cameron, you could see him thinking, "is this right? it might be right. it might be right. i know that. maybe not. i don't know."}
<A>__{keating begins walking with his groin pushed forward.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{mr. overstreet, driven by deeper force. yes. we know that. all right. now, i didn't bring them up here to ridicule them. i brought them up here to illustrate the point of conformity: the difficulty in maintaining your own beliefs in the face of others. now, those of you i see the look in your eyes like, "i would've walked differently." well, ask yourselves why you were clapping. now, we all have a great need for acceptance. but you must trust that your beliefs are unique, your own, even though others may think them odd or unpopular, even though the herd may go, "that's baaaaad." robert frost said, "two roads diverged in a wood and i, i took the one less traveled by, and that has made all the difference." now, i want you to find your own walk right now. your own way of striding, pacing. any direction. anything you want. whether it's proud, whether it's silly, anything. gentlemen, the courtyard is yours.}
<A>__{the students begin walking about, some walking casually, others making up silly walks. keating notices that charlie is still leaning up against one of the pillars.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{you don't have to perform. just make it for yourself. mr. dalton? you be joining us?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{exercising the right not to walk.}
<C>__{keating}
<D>__{thank you, mr. dalton. you just illustrated the pointerior swim against the stream.}
