<C>__{vic}
<D>__{fuckin asshole, won't let me leave the halfway house.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{never ceases to amaze me. fuckin jungle bunny goes out there, slits some old woman's throat for twenty five cents. fuckin nigger gets doris day as a parole officer. but a good fella like you gets stuck with a ball bustin prick.}
<A>__{joe walks back around his desk and sits in his chair. vic swallows some remy.}
<C>__{vic}
<D>__{i just want you to know, joe, how much i appreciate your care packages on the inside.}

<A>__{vic gets out of his seat and hugs eddie.}
<C>__{eddie}

<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{that i should've picked you up?}
<C>__{vic}

"i'm ruined! he's ruining me! my son, i love him, but he's taking my business and flushing it down the fuckin toilet!"}
<P>__{(to joe)}
<D>__{i'm not tellin tales out of school. you tell 'im joe. tell 'im yourself.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{eddie, i hate like hell for you to hear it this way. but when vic asked me how's business, well, you don't lie to a man who's just done four years in the slammer for ya.}
<A>__{eddie bobs his head up and down.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{oh really, is that a fact?}
<A>__{eddie jumps vic and they fall to the floor. the two friends, laughing and cussing at each other, wrestle on the floor of joe's office. joe's on his feet yelling at them.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{okay, okay, enough, enough! playtime's over! you wanna roll around on the floor, do it in eddie's office, not mine!}
<A>__{the two men break it up. they are completely disheveled, hair a mess, shirttails out. as they get themselves together, they continue to taunt one another.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{daddy, did ya see that?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{guy got me on the ground, tried to fuck me.}
<C>__{vic}
<D>__{you fuckin wish.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you tried to fuck me in my father's office, you sick bastard. look, vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home, go do it. but don't try to fuck me. i don't think of you that way. i mean, i like you a lot }
<C>__{vic}
<D>__{eddie, if i was a pirate, i wouldn't throw you to the crew.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{no, you'd keep me for yourself. four years fuckin punks in the ass made you appreciate prime rib when you get it.}
<C>__{vic}
<D>__{i might break you, nice guy, but i'd make you my dog's bitch. you'd be suckin the dick and going down on a mangy t bone hound.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{now ain't that a sad sight, daddy, walks into jail a white man, walks out talkin like a nigger. it's all that black semen been shootin up his butt. it's backed up into his brain and comes out of his mouth.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{are you two finished? we were talkin about some serious shit when you came in eddie. we got a big problem we're tryin to solve. now eddie, would you like to sit down and help us solve it, or do you two wanna piss fart around?}
<A>__{playtime is over and vic and eddie know it. so they both take seats in front of joe's desk.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{now vic was tellin me, he's got a parole problem.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{really? who's your p.o.?}
<C>__{vic}
<D>__{craig koons.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{koons? oh shit, i hear he's a motherfucker.}
<C>__{vic}
<D>__{he is a motherfucker. he won't let me leave the halfway house till i get some piece of shit job.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you're coming back to work for us, right?}
<C>__{vic}
<D>__{i wanna. but i gotta show this asshole i got an honest to goodness job before he'll let me move out on my own. i can't work for you guys and be worried about gettin back before ten o'clock curfew.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(to eddie)}
<D>__{we can work this out, can't we?}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{this isn't all that bad. we can give you a lot of legitimate jobs. put you on the rotation at long beach as a dock worker.}
<C>__{vic}
<D>__{i don't wanna lift crates.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{you don't hafta lift shit. you don't really work there. but as far as the records are concerned, you do. i call up matthews, the foreman, tell him he's got a new guy. you're on the schedule. you got a timecard, it's clocked in and out for you everyday, and you get a pay check at the end of the week. and ya know dock workers don't do too bad. so you can move into a halfway decent place without koons thinkin "what the fuck." and if koons ever wants to make a surprise visit, you're gone that day. that day we sent you to tustin. we gotta bunch of shit you needed to unload there. you're at the taft airstrip pickin up a bunch of shit and bringing it back. part of your jab is goin different places and we got places all over the place.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(to vic)}
<D>__{didn't i tell ya not to worry?}
<P>__{(to eddie)}
<D>__{vic was worried.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{me and you'll drive down to long beach tomorrow. i will introduce you to matthews, tell him what's going on.}
<C>__{vic}
<D>__{that's great, guy, thanks a bunch.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{when do you think you'll need me for real work?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well, it's kinda a strange time right now. things are kinda }
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{ nuts. we got a big meeting in vegas coming up. and we're kinda just gettin ready for that right now.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{let nice guy set you up at long beach. give ya some cash, get that koons fuck off your back, and we'll be talking to ya.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{daddy, i got an idea. now just hear it out. i know you don't like to use any of the boys on these jobs, but technically, vic ain't one of the boys. he's been gone for four years. he ain't on no one's list. ya know he can handle himself, ya know you can trust him.}
<A>__{joe looks at vic. vic has no idea what they're talking about.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{how would you feel about pullin a heist with about five other guys?}
<C>__{vic}
<D>__{what's the exposure like?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{two minutes, tops. it's a tough two minutes. it's a hold up, daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd. but you have the fellas to deal with the crowd. it's a jewelry store. they're getting a big shipment of south african diamonds on a certain day. they're like a way station. it's gonna get picked up the next day and sent to hamburg. when you walk through the door, you'll know right where to go for the rich stones. the fellas are good, me and nice guy picked em. nobody knows anybody else. nobody's connected. i don't use connected guys for this shit.}
<C>__{vic}
<D>__{what's the cut?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{juicy, man, real juicy.}
<A>__{toothpick vic smiles. so does nice guy eddie.}
