<LOC>__{EXT.    LATE 1942.    THE SAHARA DESERT.    DAY.}
<ACTION>__{SILENCE.  THE DESERT seen from the air.  An ocean of dunes  for mile after mile.  The late sun turns the sand every color from crimson to black. An old AEROPLANE is flying over the Sahara.  Its shadow swims over the contours of sand. A woman's voice begins to sing unaccompanied on the track.  Szerelem, szerelem, she cries, in a haunting lament for her loved one. INSIDE the aeroplane are two figures.  One,  A WOMAN, seems to be asleep.  Her pale head rests against the side of the cockpit.  THE PILOT, a man, wears goggles and a leather helmet.  He is singing, too, but we can't hear him or the plane or anything save the singer's plaintive voice. The plane shudders over a ridge.  Beneath it A SUDDEN CLUSTER OF MEN AND MACHINES, camouflage nets draped over the sprawl of gasoline tanks and armored vehicles.  An OFFICER, GERMAN, focuses his field glasses. The glasses pick out the MARKINGS on the plane.  They are English.  An ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUN swivels furiously. Shocking bursts of GUNFIRE.  Explosions rock the plane, which lurches violently.  THE WOMAN SLUMPS FORWARD, slamming her head against the instruments.  The pilot grabs her, pulls her back, but she's not conscious.  The fuel tank above their heads is punctured.  It sprays them both, then EXPLODES. THE MAN FALLS OUT OF THE SKY, clinging to his dead lover.  The are both ON FIRE.  She is wrapped in a parachute silk and it burns fiercely.  He looks up to see the flames licking at his own parachute as it carries them slowly to earth.  Even his helmet is on fire, but the man makes no sound as the flames erase all that matters - his name, his past, his face, his lover...}

<ACTION>__{THE PILOT HAS BEEN RESCUED BY BEDOUIN TRIBESMEN.  Behind them the wreckage of the plane, still smoking, the Arabs picking over it.  A SILVER THIMBLE glints in the sun, is retrieved.  Another man comes across A LARGE LEATHER-BOUND BOOK and takes it over to the Pilot.  The Pilot is charred.  His helmet has melted into his head.  He's oblivious to this, cares only about the woman who crashed with him.  He twists frantically to find her.  Two men pick him up and carry him across to a litter where they carefully wrap him in blankets.}

<ACTION>__{The Pilot sees a man squat down beside him, takes a date from a sack and begin to chew it.  Carefully, the Bedouin eases the mask from the Pilot's face, leaving bandages of cloth and oil, but revealing a mouth. He stops chewing and passes the pulped date into the Pilot's mouth. Mouth to mouth.}

<ACTION>__{The SOUND OF GLASS, of tiny chimes.  A music of glass. AN ARAB HEAD APPEARS ON A MOVING TABLE IN THE DESERT.  It floats in darkness, shimmering from the light of a fire.  The image develops to reveal a man carrying a giant wooden yoke from which hang DOZENS OF SMALL GLASS BOTTLES, on different lengths of string and wire.  He could be an angel. The man approaches the litter which carries the Pilot.  He's still in the protective reed mask, wrapped in blankets.  The MERCHANT DOCTOR stands over the burned body and sinks sticks either side of him deep into the sand, then moves away, free of the yoke, which balances in the support of the two crutches.  He puts some liquid in the Pilot's tongue, whose eyes almost instantly begin to roll.  Then he slowly sets about peeling away the layers of oiled cloth which protect the Pilot's flesh. The Merchant Doctor crouches in front of the curtain of bottles and MAKES A SKIN CUP with the soles of his feet, then leans back to pluck, hardly looking, certain bottles, which he uncorks and mixes in the bowl he'd made with his feet.  This mixture he uses to anoint the burned skin.  Next he finds green-black PASTE - ground Peacock Bone - and BEGINS TO RUB IT on to the Pilot's rib cage.  All the while he us humming and chanting.  The bottles continue to jingle.}

<ACTION>__{The sand gives way to trees, the jingling bottles to distant church bells, as A CONVOY OF TWENTY TRUCKS - Red Cross vehicles and some supply vehicles - snakes along a bumpy hill road.  The war in Italy is largely over and the Allies are moving up the country, the wounded and supply lines slowly following.}

<ACTION>__{A young CANADIAN NURSE, HANA, sits in a truck full of patients.  Hana pays special care to the PATIENT lying in the stretcher alongside her. This is the PILOT - now known as THE ENGLISH PATIENT.  A web of scars covers the Patient's face and body.  They have the quality of a livid tattoo, magenta and green-black.  The hair has largely gone and the effect is curious, lassoing his features, the strong nose, the eyes liquid.  It's a warrior's face.  But he has no physical strength.  He coughs violently as the trucks shudders along the road.}

<ACTION>__{A JEEP pulls out of the line and approaches the Red Cross truck containing Hana and the Patient.  The horn blows and Hana looks out to see it contains her best friend, JAN.  TWO YOUNG SOLDIERS sit up front, one driving, both grinning.  Jan signals for Hana's attention.}

Kip is young, lithe, contained, utterly focused as they inch along the debris-strewn road.  He stiffens as he registers metal.  With a bayonet he carefully scrapes at the mud-caked surface.  Something GLEAMS.  Suddenly, A PAIR OF FEET walks across his vision as HANA HURRIES PAST, walking carelessly up the road.  It's so surreal that neither man registers at first, and then Kip is shouting.}
