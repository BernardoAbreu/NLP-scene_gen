<A>__{corbett and eric sit under the nylon shelter. the storm rages outside. eric empties his pockets of eskimo potato, reindeer lichens, bistsort sorrel and other plants for his dinner. corbett has fashioned a snare from his boot laces and a tree branch, and placed some crushed roots as aromatic bait next to a small animal burrow outside the shelter. a squirrel sticks his nose out of the burrow to investigate. corbett sits catlike, ready to pounce. eric grimaces as corbett yanks on the snare and the squirrel's squeals (os) abruptly cease.}
