<L>__{exterior hunters' camp night}
<A>__{back in the camp, sarah, malcolm, and nick have finished with all of the vehicles except the badly battered one, which is parked some distance away, undergoing repairs. the motor pool area is now a soggy lake of spilled gasoline. the saboteurs walk casually across the camp, unnoticed in the drunken revelry. they pass several tents, the shadows of the partiers visible as they move inside. they continue across the camp and arrive at the other side to face the caged animals. the carinthosaur that was tranquilized earlier stands there dully, eyes heavy and glassy, still under the effects. they pass a stegosaur, its row of fine bristling. and finally they reach the largest cage, which houses a triceratops the size of a pickup truck, nick pulls out his trusty bolt cutters. he looks at them, a glint in his eye.}
