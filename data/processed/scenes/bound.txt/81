<A>__{close on gino's hand holding the gun barrel as caesar fires. from behind the gun we watch gino's grip yanked free, time melting away as he falls, blood bubbling from his chest, his eyes wide in disbelief. his body hits the floor and the room erupts. roy dives, drawing his gun as caesar continues to fire, pumping the trigger. violet drops behind the bar as jobnnie screams, falling towards his father. blood spurts from roy as two bullets hit, his gun clattering and sliding across the floor. johnnie lunges at caesar as caesar turns and fires, hitting johnnie everywhere; blood and meat spray and speckle everything around him.}
