<L>__{exterior garage door}
<A>__{tatum is half in half out of the pet door. she beats and jerks wildly, unable to see the figure on the other side... a true fighter, tatum kicks hard, making direct contact with the figure, knocking him away. she takes the moment to pull herself through further...but she stops...stuck. she pulls and tugs but can't move. she listens but hears nothing. where did he go? an agonizing silence. and then... crr brrrm! the garage door is activated. it begins to rise upward, taking tatum with it. she screams madly.}

<D>__{noooooooo.....}
<A>__{tatum's arms and legs fly about violently as she tries to free herself from the door, but it moves too fast, carrying her up... she looks above to see where the door rolls back into garage rafters just as her neck hits the first beam, snapping instantly.}
