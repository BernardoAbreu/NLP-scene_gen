<L>__{interior enclosed office second floor day}
<A>__{walter and brandon enter. it's spacious. nicely appointed. a glass partition overlooks the sales room.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{i had three guys who picked games. i fired one last weekend. i'm giving you his job. this is your office. from here out your picks are going straight to our biggest customers. how do you like it?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{what's not to like? jerry sykes appears at the door. fast glance at brandon, attention to walter }
<C>__{jerry}
<A>__{the miami new york point spread shifted a half tick up to 10.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{jerry}
<A>__{miami's still a lock. the win loss ratios and rpi ratings are off the charts. i'm keeping it on my sheet.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{jerry's our top handicapper, came to me straight out of grad school. jerry, meet the new kid in town.}
<C>__{jerry}
<A>__{whoa, phone guy makes good. big jump from the 900 numbers. watch out you don't get a nose bleed. just kidding, best of luck, i gotta get back to work.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{pleasure meeting you. by the way, jerry, new york's gonna win straight up. they always play the fish tight. tonight it's foregone, they win outright.}
<C>__{jerry}
<A>__{really? listen up, stick to college, sonny. you have to work up to pro ball around here. nice try though.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{(watching jerry walk away) i got three guys who can handicap and 20 who can sell but i never had one who could do both, not really, not until now.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{you mean me?}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{not you. john anthony.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{john anthony doesn't exist.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{that's a shock 'cause i'm standing in his office and you're sitting in his chair!}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{look, making predictions is one thing but pushing people to bet, it's not me.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{pushing people? get real, this country was built on gambling. look at wall street one big casino. the state spends millions hawking the lottery. if people want to pay for advice on who to bet, who are we to say no? stop being selfish, spread the word! check your bible, brandon, tis better to give than receive.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{you got a whole room full of salesmen.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{big bettors don't want to talk to a middle man, they want to speak to the guy making the picks and you're picking 80 percent winners.}
<C>__{walter con'd}
<A>__{what's the matter? gonna lose your purity? c'mon, what do you think selling is? we're just talking a few well timed phrases. let's start with an easy one. a throw away. "i don't want your money, i want your bookie's fucking money?"}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{i don't want your money }
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{ jesus, don't start that shit again. sell me.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{i don't want your money, i want your bookie's money!}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{what happened to the fuck?}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{nothing, i just don't talk like that.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{i can't have someone working for me who can't say fuck.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{it's not that i can't. why do i have to?}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{because there's no other fucking word that can convey the precise feeling and fucking flavor of life's various predicaments and certain concepts the way a well placed fuck can. fuck is your friend. fuck can be your best friend.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{i'm happy for you and your friend, walter, but i'm not using it.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{chaucer used it 600 years ago. it was good enough for him. c'mon (calling out to the salesmen) this fucking guy has a problem saying fuck! a chorus of "fuck yous" fill the air.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{c'mon, repeat after me fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck. fuck he, fuck she, fuck me, fuck them, fuck me try it.}
<C>__{brandon}
<A>__{it's not me. let it go.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{backbone. almost as good. we'll keep working on the other thing... so, you really like new york in tonight's game?}
