<L>__{interior gertrude stein's place night}
<A>__{they enter.}
<C>__{hemingway}
<D>__{this is gil pender. he's a young american writer. i thought you two should know each other.}
<C>__{stein}
<D>__{i'm glad you're here. you can help decide which of us is right and which of us is wrong.}
<A>__{she leads them into other room, introduces gil.}
<C>__{stein }
<D>__{this is gil }
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{pender.}
<C>__{stein}
<D>__{pablo picasso.}
<A>__{they ad lib greetings. picasso speaks french and is with a beautiful girl adriana.}
<C>__{stein}
<D>__{i was just telling pablo that this portrait doesn't capture adriana. it has universality but no objectivity.}
<C>__{pablo}
<D>__{vous ne le comprenez pas correctment. vous ne connaissez pas adriana mais c'est tout ce qui la represente.}
<C>__{stein}
<D>__{no tu n'a pas raison. look how he's done her dripping with sexual innuendo. carnal to the point of smoldering and yes she's beautiful but it's a subtle beauty an implied sensuality.}
<P>__{(to gil)}
<D>__{what is your first impression of adriana?}
<C>__{gil}
<P>__{(very taken)}
<D>__{exceptionally lovely.}
<C>__{stein}
<D>__{belle, mais plus subtil plus implicite, pablo.}
<C>__{hemingway}
<D>__{you're right gertrude of course you can see why he's lost his objectivity.}
<P>__{(flirting with her)}
<C>__{stein}
<D>__{you've made a creation of place pigalle, a whore with volcanic appetites.}
<C>__{pablo}
<D>__{mais c'est comme elle est, si vous la connaissez.}
<C>__{stein}
<D>__{yes avec vous en prive because she's your lover but we don't know her that way so you make a petit bourgeoise judgment and turn her into an object of pleasure.}
<C>__{stein }
<D>__{c'est plus comme une nature morte qu'on portrait. it's more like a still life than a portrait.}
<C>__{pablo}
<P>__{(waves her off and goes to get a drink)}
<D>__{je ne suis pas d'accord.}
<C>__{stein}
<P>__{(turning to gil)}
<D>__{and what about this book of yours i've been hearing about?}
<P>__{(to hemingway)}
<D>__{have you read it?}
<C>__{hemingway}
<D>__{no, this i leave to you. you've always been the best judge of my work.}
<C>__{stein}
<P>__{(thumbing first page, she reads)}
<D>__{"out of the past was the name of the store and its products consisted of memories. what was prosaic and even vulgar to one generation had been transmuted by the mere passing of years to a status at once magical and also camp. "}
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{i love it. i'm already hooked? hooked.}
<C>__{stein}
<D>__{i will start it tonight. but first we have something to talk about.}
<A>__{she collars hemingway and they huddle to one side. picasso has busied himself at a distant spot with a drink, sulking. this leaves gil off with adriana to chat.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{did my opening lines really get to you that strongly?}
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{the past has always had a great charisma for me.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{me too. i was born too late.}
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{oui, exactement. for me belle epoque paris would have been perfect. the whole sensibility, the street lamps, the kiosks the horse and carriages. and maxims then.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{you speak very good english.}
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{no, not really.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{yes and how long have you been dating picasso? my god, did i say that?}
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{pardon.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{oh i no, i didn't mean anything you know to pry born in paris?}
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{i was born in bordeaux i moved here to study fashion and you don't want to hear this }
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{no, i do.}
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{i came here to study with coco chanel and i fell in love with paris and also a very dark eyed, haunted, jewish italian painter and i knew amedeo had another woman but still i couldn't resist moving into his apartment when he asked and it was a beautiful six months.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{not modigliani? was it modigliani? you lived with modigliani?}
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{you asked me so i'm telling you my sad story. with braque also there was another woman many and now with pablo i mean pablo is married but every day it's on again, off again i don't know how any woman can stay with him he's so difficult.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{my god you are a whole different level of art groupie.}
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{pardon.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{nothing i'm }
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{but tell me about yourself. have you come to paris to write because these days so many americans feel the need to move here. isn't hemingway attractive? i love his writing.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{actually i'm visiting.}
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{oh you must stay here. it's a wonderful city for artists and writers.}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{believe me, i want to but it's not that simple.}
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{and i did fall madly in love with the start of your book so i want to hear the rest of it.}
<A>__{hemingway and stein return.}
<C>__{hemingway}
<D>__{come, let's all go for a drink up at montmartre.}
<C>__{stein}
<D>__{we'll discuss your book as soon as i finish it. where can i reach you?}
<C>__{gil}
<D>__{oh that's okay i will drop by it'll be easier for you if that's okay.}
<C>__{stein}
<D>__{we run an open house.}
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{you sure you won't come?}
<C>__{gil}
<P>__{(checks watch)}
<D>__{i only wish i could but i can't but hopefully i will see you again }
<C>__{adriana}
<D>__{that would be nice.}
<A>__{hemingway, picasso and adriana are going off hemingway flirtatious with her.}
<C>__{hemingway}
<P>__{(teasing picasso)}
<D>__{one of these days i plan to steal you away from this genius who's great but no miro.}
