<A>__{smiley and guillam reach a flat near the shadowy top of the building. smiley studies the door. he runs his fingers over the door frame and there it is a little wedge at the top.}

<A>__{guillam, followed by smiley, pushes in against a mound of dead mail. they advance cautiously into the dirty flat, the windows fogged out with windowlene. their p.o.v. tracking towards the door guillam has reached the door and disappears into the room beyond...}

<A>__{a green velvet armchair sits at the centre of a room. beside it an ashtray over loaded with stubs. the rest of the room is mounded with piles and piles of papers files, document boxes, maps and charts, something insane in the sprawl of it all. guillam stands with his back to us staring at a chess set laid out before the chair, as if in mid game. four of the chess pieces have had photographs of faces added to them roy bland. toby esterhase. percy alleline. bill haydon all wearing paper party hats. the effect is ridiculous and a little disturbing, like some surrealist objet d'art. guillam hears smiley and turns, almost guiltily, and as he moves we see there is a fifth photograph on a piece and it is of smiley himself. smiley stares at his image.}
