<A>__{inside parker's cramped prison cell it's night. light is dim. his bed is empty. the wall next to it is completely bare, except for the five christmas cards sent each year by chief cox. the other two walls in the cell, however, look very different. they are completely covered with primitive paintings darkly colored, surreal images. imagine the lascaux cave paintings as worksinprogress. painted by dali. except these images were created by parker barnes. he kneels in a corner, working intensely on another image. completely lost in concentration. his hands, his clothing, covered in painterior he almost appears to be part of the art work. the work is intricate. it clearly takes parker a very long time. which gives him something to do during the nights he is unable to sleep. which is most of them. he is so absorbed in his task that he seems oblivious to the constant taunts echoing throughout the cell block. threats of the ugliest, most vile kind. the kind parker has had to live with every night for the last five years. pausing to admire his work, parker finally hears the taunts. his face becoming a mixture of frustration, guilt, and anger. parker immediately resumes painting.}
