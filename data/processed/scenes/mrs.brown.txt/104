<L>__{interior balmoral castle, upper servant's table night}
<A>__{that night. brown is standing at his place, drinking steadily. he has a sheet of paper and a pen and is ticking off a list. lined up in front of him, trying desperately not to laugh, are five or six upper servants including the pretty assistant dresser and bertie's valet. they each step up, one at a time, to make their report.}

<A>__{folding up the paper, brown downs his glass of whiskey and sits. on his nod, dinner is served by under servants amid a clatter of cutlery and chat. archie looks across at his brother but brown is hunched over his plate, pecking at his food. someone titters and archie looks up. bertie's valet coughs. brown slowly lifts his head. his eyes have the slightly unfocused look of too much drink. it is clear to archie that he is about to be sent up.}

<A>__{he stops. archie has come across to his brother's chair and pulls gently on his arm. brown stares at the servants. everyone is about to burst out laughing. keeping his dignity, he pushes back his chair and lets archie lead him away. as brown reaches the double doors, the laughter hits him in the back like a wave. archie holds him steady.}
