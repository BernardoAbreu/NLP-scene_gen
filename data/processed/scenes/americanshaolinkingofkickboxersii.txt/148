<L>__{exterior mountainside same day}
<B>__{establishing shot of drew climbing up the side of the mountain.}
<A>__{it is much steeper now, and the going is much tougher.}
<B>__{angle on drew}
<A>__{as he comes up onto a rope bridge over a deep gorge, the way to the arhat. drew smiles, stashes the map and starts across the rope bridge, hand over hand. he looks down once, at the drop, then forces himself to look straight ahead. he just starts across when the rope bends and jumps. drew turns around to see a man right behind him.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{is this rope strong enough for both of us?}
<A>__{no answer from the man, who is now pushing drew to go faster. he is inching up closer to him, and occassionally kicking him to go quicker.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{ok, ok, i'm going!}
<B>__{angle on the rope behind them}
<A>__{which is starting to fray from the weight.}
<B>__{angle on drew}
<A>__{who sees that and is hurrying. the rope is fraying more, and when drew is almost there, the rope snaps and they both go swinging into the side of the mountain.}
<B>__{angle on drew}
<A>__{who slams into the wall hard. when he hits, the scroll pops out of his pocket and goes up in the air. drew, groggy from the impact, manages to lash out and pin the scroll to the cliff wall with the back of his hand.}
<B>__{angle on man}
<A>__{who is barely hanging on, just below drew. he has his hand out to drew for help.}
<B>__{angle on drew}
<A>__{who doesn't know what to do. if he tries to save the scroll, the man might fall. if he goes for the man, the box will certainly fall.}
<B>__{angle on the man}
<A>__{screaming for help.}
<C>__{drew }
<D>__{hold on...}
<A>__{drew hears the headmaster's voice.}
<C>__{san de }
<D>__{the scroll that is in this box is more precious than life. guard it well.}
<A>__{he looks down at the man, who is about to lose it.}
<C>__{drew}
<D>__{what the heck...}
<A>__{drew reaches down for the man's hand, letting the box fall. their hands meet, and drew pulls him up.}
<B>__{angle on box}
<A>__{as it spins down into the abyss.}
<B>__{angle on drew and man}
<A>__{as drew pulls him up onto his back, and carries him up the rope to the other side of the gorge.}
