<A>__{holmes is out cold, lying on his tiger skin rug. crack! his eyes fly open. crack!!}
<C>__{irene }
<D>__{london's so bleak this time of year.}
<A>__{reveal: irene adler sits on the stairs near holmes' lab, cracking walnuts. she stands and holmes watches her every move as she crosses to him. she leans down, putting the walnuts in front of him and flashes him a smile.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{not that i'm pining for new jersey.}
<A>__{irene gets up to cross the room. only once her back is turned does holmes lever himself upright, stunned by this intrusion. as soon as she clears he quickly moves over to a concealed safe. he tests the door to make sure it's still locked.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{i prefer to travel in the winter.}
<A>__{as she passes a small table that has been outfitted with tea, dried fruit, olives, etc...}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{i brought a few souvenirs. dates from jordan, tea from ceylon and olives from cyclades. i thought we'd have a little tea party to cheer us up.}
<A>__{irene grabs a file from holmes' desk.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{i came across this as i was setting up.}
<A>__{irene opens the file, flips through newspaper clippings and police reports, her back to holmes.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{theft of velasquez portrait from the king of spain... missing naval documents lead to resignation of bulgarian prime minister... scandalous affair ends engagement of hapsburg prince to romanov princess.}
<A>__{holmes stealthily turns down a photo of irene, just before she turns back to face him.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{simply studying your methodology for when the authorities ask me to hunt you down.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{i don't see my name anywhere.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{but your signature is clear.}
<A>__{holmes reaches for irene and pulls on a chain around her neck, revealing and enormous diamond.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{ah, the maharajah's missing diamond. another souvenir?}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{he has a palace full of them. let's not dwell on the past.}
<A>__{they move to sit at the table.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{by the looks of things you're between cases at the moment.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{and you, husbands. no ring?}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{he snored. i'm irene adler again and i need your help to find someone. there's nobody more brilliant or who knows london better than you. plus, it's a wonderful opportunity to see you again.}
<A>__{track into irene's hypnotically beautiful eyes. holmes almost melts. then, irene reaches for something inside her jacket and holmes grabs her hand.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{why are you so suspicious?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{should i answer chronologically or alphabetically?}
<A>__{irene pulls out an envelope.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{this is all the information you need.}
<A>__{she hands him the envelope.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{who are you working for?}
<A>__{just for a brief moment, she can't hide the anxiety in her eyes.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{i'm my own man.}
<A>__{she stands and pulls out a large bag of coins.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{keep your money. i didn't say i'd take the case.}
<A>__{she ignores him. holmes examines the envelope. on it is stamped the letterhead of the grand hotel. she pauses behind him as she exits.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{they gave me our old room.}
<A>__{as she walks out she puts her photo back upright.}
