<L>__{interior castle main building day}
<A>__{petra sits at a desk working on a laptop. yorgi enters with xander and kirill.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{look who we found playing outside.}
<A>__{petra looks up. she can barely hide her shock.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{petra, my sweet dove, do you notice anything strange about x? he looks slightly less than dead.}
<A>__{kirill aims his gun at petra.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{yorgi, i thought he was }
<A>__{yorgi slaps her.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{do you think i didn't know about you all along? my contacts in the kgb told me you were coming. you show up undercover and, i must admit, you play your part to the hilt. when it's time to be cruel, you are cruel. when it's time to be passionate, you are very very passionate indeed.}
<A>__{petra is devastated by this revelation.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{i could have killed you, but i thought this would be so much more fun. to twist you and use you how i see fit. and to be honest, you went much farther than i ever expected you would for your country.}
<A>__{he runs this fingers through her hair and moves on to xander.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{and you. why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? did you miss us that much?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i wanted to get the hell out of prague before silent night falls.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{not bad, man, not bad. you put things together quick. prague it is.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{the peace conference...}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{nice place to start, don't you think?}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{what's the gimmick, yorgi? that's the part i don't get. you gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? i didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{you think i'm after money? i told you, my friend. anarchy. time for a change. money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{so all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{easier than that, buddy. i will get them to destroy each other. you kill an entire peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. then our friend ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. london, cairo, beijing... pretty soon everyone's involved. these guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. soon the whole world is like your wild west cowboy days. no rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{including rape, pillage, murder.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{sure, if that's what you want. why not? it's all human nature. so we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{and here i thought "anarchy" was just something cool to put on a tshirt.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{come on, xander. you used to stand for something. what happened to you, man? i thought you'd get it.}
<C>__{petra}
<D>__{don't you see, x? for the betterment of humanity, he's going to start world war three.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{he's a regular humanitarian. and all this time i thought he was just a tool.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{you both could have been a part of it. you could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of }
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{oh just shoot us already. i'm sorry i asked.}
<A>__{yorgi's eye twitches.}
<C>__{yorgi}
<D>__{screw you too, buddy.}
<A>__{he raises his gun and suddenly booooom! a massive explosion rocks the whole castle. shrapnel shatters the windows, spraying glass, and yorgi's shot goes wide.}
