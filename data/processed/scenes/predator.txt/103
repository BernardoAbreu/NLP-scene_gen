<L>__{exterior hunter day}
<A>__{moving. a piece of shrapnel cuts his shoulder. a splash of orange blood spatters across the leaves of a nearby tree, bullet holes ripping through the surrounding foliage. back to scene mac more firing. mac, his weapon expended, continues to thrust the mini gun forward, still squeezing the trigger. suddenly, as quickly as it started, the firing stops. the men move catlike into the jungle, reloading, searching, their nerves taut, stretched to the limit, ready to fire again at any second. mac is frozen, eyes wide, unblinking, his breath coming in rapid gasps as he stares into the jungle, still squeezing the trigger of the weapon, its breech locked open, gunsmoke wafting from the chamber and barrel. schaefer moves in front of mac, still staring into the jungle. dillon pushes anna into the clearing, moving towards the body. anna looks at the body and then up to mac. schaefer sees a terrifying moment of recognition flash in her eyes as she continues to stare at mac. he turns to mac.}
<C>__{mac}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{i...saw it.}
<A>__{at these words, anna reacts in shock, drawing a slight breath. schaefer turns, sees her staring at mac. he turns back.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{you saw what?}
<C>__{mac}
<P>__{(still dazed)}
<D>__{i saw it.}
<A>__{schaefer turns back to see anna, staring fixidly at mac, watching his lips. schaefer turns quickly to blain's body and kneels alongside dillon.}
<B>__{schaefer}
<A>__{is at blain's side, shocked at the sight of the mutilated body. he is joined by dillon.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{blain...}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{...just like the others...no powder burns, no shrapnel.}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{the wound all fused, cauterized...what the hell did this?}
<A>__{schaefer stands, looking at the body. in the b.g. anna drifts away from the group.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<P>__{(to mac)}
<D>__{...mac!}
<A>__{mac stares ahead, dumbly, not hearing. he grabs mac by his shoulders, shaking him violently back to awareness.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<P>__{(demanding; angry)}
<D>__{mac! mac! look at me!}
<A>__{mac turn to face schaefer, a shocked expression on his face.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<P>__{(urgent)}
<D>__{mac, who did this?}
<A>__{mac is suddenly angry and frustrated, he has no explanation.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i don't know. goddamn it, something...i saw something .}
<A>__{ramirez runs from the jungle, breathing hard, shaking his head.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{nothing. the same thing. not a fucking trace. no bodies, blood, anything.}
<A>__{mac stands. instinctively the team has now grouped around schaefer, their weapons pointing into the jungle, ready, their nerves on total edge. schaefer looks upward at the darkening sky.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{we're losing the light. mac, i want a defensive position above this ridge, mined with everything we're got.}
<A>__{man is again the hardened professional.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{yessir.}
<A>__{schaefer looks down at blain's body. he turns to ramirez and billy.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{put him in his poncho and liner and carry him back. we'll bury him in the morning.}
<C>__{mac}
<D>__{i will take him.}
<B>__{anna}
<A>__{as they leave approaches the brush, her attention focused on something clinging to the leaves, well off to the side of where mac saw the hunter. she draws closer, reaching out, hesitant, as if drawn magnetically to the leaves.}
