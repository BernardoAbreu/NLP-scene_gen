<L>__{interior margo's lab night}
<A>__{margo and frock stand in the darkness. through a high window we can see lightning flash.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{some kind of power failure. maybe it's the storm. do you have a flashlight?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{i think so.}
<A>__{she gets one from a cupboard.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{greg's been gone over a half hour. we'd better get out of here. get the crate.}
<L>__{interior hallways night}
<A>__{frock wheels his chair as fast as he can. margo runs beside him carrying the crate with the fibers inside. a peel of thunder ends and distant screaming is heard. margo stops, appalled.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{dr. frock. did you hear that?}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{don't stop now.}
<A>__{up ahead they hear metallic rumbling and a crash! they round a corner and come up against a huge steel door.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{it's one of the fire doors. good lord, margo. we're trapped!}
