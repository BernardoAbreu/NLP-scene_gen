<A>__{morning sunlight is streaming in.}
<B>__{the poker table}
<A>__{the kid, facing the sun, wears his eyeshade. the shooter has resumed the deal and now hands out last cards to sokal, the kid and himself.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{bet the pot. four hundred and twenty dollars.}
<C>__{sokal}
<D>__{fold.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{it's yours.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{thanks, gents. makes me exactly even. this kind of a game, that's a smart place to quit.}
<P>__{(takes his money off the table)}
<D>__{just do the dealing, if that's all right with everybody.}
<A>__{(time lapse)}
<B>__{the poker table}
<A>__{it is later in the morning. three players are left in the hand on the last card: yeller with nothing higher than a jack, lancey with a king queen showing and sokal with an ace king.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{ace king is the high man.}
<C>__{sokal}
<D>__{shoot the works.}
<P>__{(counts it out)}
<D>__{nine hundred and thirty bucks.}
<C>__{yeller}
<D>__{i'm over.}
<C>__{lancey}
<P>__{(putting out the money)}
<D>__{what have you got?}
<C>__{sokal}
<P>__{(unhappily)}
<D>__{doesn't matter. if you can call me, you beat me. ace king high.}
<C>__{lancey}
<P>__{(turning an ace)}
<D>__{ace king queen high.}
<C>__{yeller}
<P>__{(to the kid)}
<D>__{i had them both with a pair of fives.}
<C>__{sokal}
<D>__{winds it up for me, men. and i can't say it's been a pleasure.}
<P>__{(despairingly)}
<D>__{that one i was sure i could steal.}
<C>__{yeller}
<D>__{lancey has a built in burglar alarm. i'm also withdrawing from the field of battle, gentlemen. settle for the seventeen hundred i've already dropped.}
<A>__{yeller pulls in the money in front of him. there is now about $19,500 left on the table, $11,500 in front of lancey, $8,000 in front of the kid.}
<C>__{lancey}
<P>__{(to the kid)}
<D>__{well, just the two of us.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{yeah, just the two of us. deal them, shooter man.}
<A>__{(time lapse)}
<B>__{the poker table}
<A>__{there is around $1,500 in the pot. shooter deals an unhelpful card to lancey's pair of aces, and a nine to the kid's king queen ten.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{cost you a grand.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{compulsory call, kid.}
<A>__{the kid turns up a jack and pulls in the money. (time lapse)}
<B>__{the poker table}
<A>__{the last bet has been made and there is about $3000 in the pot. lancey exposes his hole card.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{two pair, jacks up.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{kings up.}
<A>__{he takes in the money. (time lapse)}
<B>__{the poker table}
<A>__{there is $2500 in the pot. lancey shows a pair of kings, the kid an ace and three odd cards. the shooter deals a nine to lancey.}
<B>__{the kid}
<A>__{he is watching the shooter intently. featuring the shooter's hands kid's p.o.v. the dealing motion looks perfectly legitimate as the shooter gives the kid an ace. lancey's hand reaches into the shot to turn over his up cards.}
<C>__{lancey's voice }
<D>__{studded again.}
<B>__{the kid}
<A>__{he takes the money in slowly, his eyes on the shooter. now the distribution of money has been reversed. the kid has something under $12,000, lancey something under $8,000.}
<B>__{the shooter}
<A>__{he avoids meeting the kid's gaze. (time lapse) the poker table from behind the kid on the fourth card lancey shows a pair of sevens, the kid a pair of eights and a ten.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{two thousand dollars.}
<A>__{the kid lifts his hole card and we see it is a ten.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{call two thousand.}
<A>__{he turns to watch the shooter. featuring the shooter's hands kid's p.o.v. again there is no indication of improper dealing as the shooter gives lancey an odd card and the kid a ten, completing his full house.}
<C>__{lancey's voice }
<D>__{two thousand more.}
<B>__{the poker table}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{take it. i can't beat three sevens.}
<P>__{(then as the shooter's}
<D>__{eyes flicker with}
<P>__{surprise)}
<D>__{i'd like a break to get some food and sleep i'm winners so it isn't up to me to say it but i'm saying it anyway.}
<A>__{he exits. after a moment the shooter follows. lancey watches them go then rises, apparently still fresh and strong. lady fingers joins him.}
<C>__{lancey}
<P>__{(pleasantly)}
<D>__{my dear, that young man is a stud poker playing son of a bitch.}
<C>__{lady fingers}
<D>__{gettin' to you, lancey?}
<A>__{lancey looks at her a moment, then smiles.}
<C>__{lancey}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{not yet he isn't.}
<A>__{he moves through the crowd, then exits.}
