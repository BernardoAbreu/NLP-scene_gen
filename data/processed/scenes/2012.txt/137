<L>__{exterior yak la monastery tibet day}
<A>__{an ancient monastery built atop a solitary mountain rock. in the distance, the sun glistens off the peaks of the himalayas. neng pang, a young monk, 20, sits with his superior and teacher lama yak la, 65. they have tea beneath a huge bronze bell.}
<C>__{lama yak la}
<P>__{(in chinese)}
<D>__{do not believe in anything simply because you have heard it, neng.}
<C>__{neng}
<D>__{but lin is my brother. he is working inside the big tunnels, where the ships are made.}
<A>__{the lama remains silent.}
<C>__{neng }
<D>__{what is in your wisdom for us to do, great lama... if lin is right, if our world is indeed coming to an end?}
<A>__{instead of answering, the lama serves him more tea. when the cup is full, the lama doesn't stop pouring. neng watches the tea overflow until he can no longer restrain himself.}
<C>__{neng }
<D>__{it's full, great lama. it can hold no more!}
<A>__{the lama stops pouring and looks at neng.}
<C>__{lama yak la}
<D>__{like this cup, neng, you are full of your own opinions and speculations. how can i show you wisdom unless you first empty your cup?}
<A>__{neng bows his head in embarrassment. the lama smiles to himself and takes a chain from around his neck. on it hangs a set of rusty car keys.}
<C>__{lama yak la }
<D>__{be careful with the clutch. it tends to slide.}
<A>__{the lama throws him the keys and the young monk catches them, smiling from ear to ear. they bow to each other and neng runs off. lama yak la looks after him as a father would. he gets up and strikes the bronze bell with a wooden mallet.}
