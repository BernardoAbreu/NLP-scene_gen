<L>__{exterior freeway pit day}
<A>__{the racer pulls off her helmet as the pit crew surrounds her. of course, the racer is natalie, aka betty lou hobert, the texas tornado.}
<C>__{pit boss}
<P>__{(yelling over the engine noise)}
<D>__{nice racing!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{can't believe you've never raced this track before!}
<C>__{natalie}
<P>__{(texas accent)}
<D>__{back where ah'm from, we race in swamps and back roads! this all's a piece a cake!}
<A>__{natalie shakes out her hair, winks at the pit boss. the pit crew races in to make repairs. dylan, dressed in a pit suit, kneels by natalie's front tire. natalie crouches down next to her so they can talk.}
<C>__{natalie }
<D>__{i nicked him. should give you enough time to do the deed.}
<C>__{dylan}
<D>__{i'm on it.}
<A>__{dylan steals away, heading for... corwin's pit crew corwin is seething mad as he pulls into his pit.}
<C>__{corwin}
<D>__{let's go! we're losing time here!}
<A>__{the pit repairs his car as corwin is approached by another racer, also wearing a red star racing suit. he leans into corwin's car and now we see that's it's... the thin man.}
<C>__{thin man}
<D>__{you okay, boss?}
<A>__{charlie's angels 8 18 99}
<C>__{corwin}
<D>__{no thanks to you! you're supposed to be my head of security! who is that bitch?!}
<A>__{the thin man peers over at natalie, but she's got her back to him.}
<C>__{thin man}
<D>__{don't know. i will keep an eye out.}
<C>__{corwin}
<D>__{yeah. you do that.}
<A>__{corwin peels out onto the track again, almost crushing the thin man in the process.}
<B>__{as corwin pulls out}
<A>__{dylan sneaks in. in all the cacophony, no one notices as she grabs corwin's suitcase out of the back seat of his regular car, a bitching mercedes. she checks both ways to see if she's being watched.}
<C>__{bosley }
<D>__{coast is clear, dylan.}
