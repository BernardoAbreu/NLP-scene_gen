<L>__{interior the faithful bride day}
<A>__{jack and gibbs sit at a table in the shadows, a single candle illumining them, speaking in hushed voices. will is away from them, at the door, hand on sword, keeping a look out. a tankard is set down. gibbs lifts it to take a swig }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{just the one.}
<A>__{gibbs pauses. he takes a dainty sip.}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{make it_ast, then. now, what's the nature of this venture of yours?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{first have you found me a crew?}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{oh, there's a hard tale, jack. most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you seem to think you're a jinx.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{now where, i wonder, would they have gotten that idea?}
<A>__{gibbs evades answering by taking a long sip. jack leans forward. gibbs leans forward.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{i'm going after the black pearl.}
<A>__{gibbs straightens up like he's been hit. he stares. he reaches for the drink as if to down it but then sets it back down. he leans forwards again. jack has not moved.}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{say again?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{ilm going after the black pearl. i know where its going to be, and i'm going to take it.}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{jack, it's a fool's errand: you've heard the tales they tell about the pearl.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{aye, and that's why i know where it's going to be, and that's why i know what barbossa is up to. all i need is a crew.}
<C>__{gibbs}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{a fool's errand.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{not if the fool has something barbossa wants. something he needs.}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{and you've got that, have you?}
<A>__{angle on: jack, as he smiles enigmatically, and shifts his eyes' behind him, will, still on guard, glares a sailor away from the table.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{back there, guarding the door is the son of old bootstrap bill turner.}
<A>__{gibbs' eyes widen over the edge of the tankard. peers at will. then smiles, with more missing teeth than good ones.}
<C>__{gibbs}
<D>__{well, lookee there. i will allow you may be onto something, jack.}
<P>__{(considers, nods)}
<D>__{there's bound to be sailors on this rock crazy as you. i will find some men.}
<A>__{gibbs downs the drink, slams the tankard on the table. will reacts to the sound, draws both sword and dagger, kicks over a table for cover, and whirls on anyone who moves.}
<C>__{gibbs }
<D>__{kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{that he is.}
