<L>__{interior security office day}
<A>__{once he closes the door behind him, jason shows his fatigue. linga is feet up on the sofa, sucking on a cup of coffee. three more bodyguards sam, kwezi and winston slump in chairs. jason grabs coffee, sits at his desk, puts his feet up with a groan.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{we need more men.}
<C>__{linga}
<D>__{did you talk to barbara about it?}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{yesterday.}
<A>__{a knock at the door.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{that's jessie, with the schedule.}
<P>__{(loudly)}
<D>__{come in, beautiful.}
<A>__{the door opens but what enters is not beautiful. four big white cops in suits enter, special branch written all over them. etienne van eck, hendrick booyens, george and}
<B>__{willem.}
<A>__{the bodyguards stand up like junk yard dogs protecting their territory.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{etienne}
<D>__{mr. jason tshabalala?}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{that's me. am i under arrest?}
<A>__{etienne snaps out a crisp salute.}
<C>__{etienne}
<D>__{captain van eck and team reporting for duty, sir.}
<A>__{hendrick, george and willem snap out salutes. their military deportment contrasts strongly with the less rigid body language of the black bodyguards.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{what duty?}
<C>__{etienne}
<D>__{we're the presidential bodyguard. we've been assigned to this office.}
<P>__{(holding out a sheet of paper)}
<D>__{here are our orders.}
<A>__{jason takes the orders, studies them, face increasingly angry.}
<C>__{linga}
<P>__{(to hendrick)}
<D>__{you're special branch, right?}
<A>__{hendrick nods, sternly. linga, sam, kwezi and winston react to that there is a long and brutal history between them and the special branch.}
<C>__{etienne}
<D>__{you'll see that they've been signed.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{i don't care if they're signed or }
<A>__{jason does a double take when he sees the signature on the orders: nelson r. mandela.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{wait here.}
<A>__{jason storms out, holding the orders. the four black bodyguards seethe with hostility. the four white bodyguards stare straight ahead, refusing to give ground.}
