<L>__{interior lewis and clarke quarters}
<A>__{weir sits huddled in a blanket. miller takes a seat next to him. starck and smith enter. starck sits next to miller.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{30 hours to neptune orbit.}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{all boards are green, everything's five by five.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{that's good to know. justin, you wanna stow that?}
<A>__{justin catches the ball, holds onto it.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{okay, listen up. as you all know by now, we have an addition to our crew. dr. weir, this is: starck, navigation; smith, pilot, justin, ship's engineer }
<C>__{cooper}
<D>__{you can call him baby bear, he loves that...}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{this is cooper, what the hell do you do on this ship, anyway?}
<C>__{justin}
<D>__{ballast.}
<C>__{cooper}
<P>__{(to weir)}
<D>__{i am your best friend. i am a lifesaver and a heartbreaker...}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{he's a rescue technician. peters, medical technician. dj...}
<C>__{dj}
<D>__{trauma.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{and this is mission specialist dr. william weir. we all know where we're going. dr. weir is going to tell us why.}
<A>__{miller and the crew look at weir, waiting. weir clears his throat.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{what i am about to tell you is considered code black by the nsa.}
<A>__{the crew look at each other: they haven't heard that in a mission briefing before.}
<C>__{justin}
<D>__{that means top secret, cooper.}
<C>__{cooper}
<D>__{i heard it.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{the usac intercepted a radio transmission from a decaying orbit around neptune. the source has been identified as the event horizon.}
<A>__{stunned silence. then everyone talks at once:}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{that's impossible! she was lost with all hands, what, seven...}
<C>__{justin}
<D>__{seven years ago, the reactor blew...}
<C>__{peters}
<D>__{how can we salvage...?}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{let the dead rest, man...}
<C>__{cooper}
<D>__{...cancel our leave and send us out on some bullshit mission...!}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{everybody shut up! let the man speak.}
<A>__{in the quiet that follows:}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{what was made public about the event horizon, that she was a deep space research vessel, that its reactor went critical, that the ship blew up... none of that is true.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the event horizon was the culmination of a secret government project to create a spacecraft capable of faster than light flight.}
<A>__{the crew stares at weir: he has just dropped another bomb on them.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{you can't do that.}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{the law of relativity prohibits faster than light travel...}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{relativity, yes. we can't break the law of relativity, but we can go around it. the ship doesn't really move faster than the speed of light; it creates a dimensional gateway that allows the ship to instantaneously "jump" from one point in the universe to another, light years away.}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{well, in layman's terms, you use a rotating magnetic field to focus a narrow beam of gravitons; these in turn fold space time consistent with weyl tensor dynamics until the space time curvature becomes infinitely large and you have a singularity...}
<C>__{cooper}
<D>__{laymen's terms.}
<A>__{weir thinks of another way to explain it. he rips a pin up from smith's locker.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{hey...}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{say this paper represents space time, and you want to get from "point a" here...}
<P>__{(marks it on the photo with a pen)}
<D>__{...to "point b," here.}
<P>__{(marks point b)}
<D>__{now: what's the shortest distance between two points?}
<A>__{the crew stares at him. starck decides to play.}
<C>__{starck}
<D>__{a straight line.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{wrong. the shortest distance between two points...}
<A>__{weir folds the paper, lining up point a over point b... then thrusting his pen through both, skewering the pin up.}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{...is zero. that's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point a and point b coexist in the same space and time. after the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal.}
<P>__{(hands the ruined pin up back to smith)}
<D>__{it's called a gravity drive.}
<C>__{justin}
<D>__{how do you know all this?}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{i built it.}
<A>__{even cooper is impressed.}
<C>__{cooper}
<D>__{i can see why they sent you along.}
<C>__{justin}
<D>__{so if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{it was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. the event horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. they received the go ahead to activate the gravity drive.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and the ship vanished from all our scopes. no radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. they disappeared without a trace.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{until now.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{where has it been for the last seven years?}
<C>__{weir}
<D>__{that's what we're here to find out.}
