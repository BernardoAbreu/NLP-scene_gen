<L>__{exterior diner, back lot day}
<A>__{pedro is driving nonchalantly toward the back lot. a song is playing on the car radio. wide on a parked mustang, a couple empty parking spaces on the passenger side of it. pedro's tow truck backs up into the frame so that it's back end is almost touching the front end of the mustang. pedro climbs out of his tow truck, leaving it on, and starts walking around to the back of it. suddenly remembering, he doubles back and sticks his head in through the driver side window, checking the gas gage. it's more than 3 4 full. satisfied, pedro proceeds toward the rear of the tow truck and hitches the mustang to the back of it. an older couple pulls into the parking lot and parks one car length from the mustang. older man and older woman climb out of their car. the older man has taken an interest in what pedro is doing.}
