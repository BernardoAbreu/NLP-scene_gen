<A>__{when he rejoins the circle, marshall is there to greet him.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{you're such a fucking hypocrite. if you were honest you would step out there and say 'hi, i'm earl. i killed two people last night and i really got off on it, but i need your help to be cured.'}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{i'm different marshall, i won't argue that with you. this is the only place that has ever helped me be normal and i've been straight up until last night for the past two years. i'm not going to kill again and i'm not going to quit coming here because it upsets you.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{yeah but for the next 29 days you're going to have to step out there and say 'hi, i'm earl, i'm an addict.' and everybody will know you fell off the wagon. don't you feel stupid doing that?}
<C>__{mr. brooks}
<D>__{no. i feel good.}
