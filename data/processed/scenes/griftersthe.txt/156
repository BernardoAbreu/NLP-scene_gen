<L>__{interior living room night}
<A>__{lilly stares across the room, breathing hard, reliving the experience.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{i sat in there with her, i thought, what do i do now? run and i've got bobo and the law after me. stay, and how do i explain?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{this way's perfect.}
<A>__{lilly sits back, showing that relief again.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{it is, isn't it? and maybe it's a break for me after all. i've been wanting out of the racket for years, and now i'm out. i can make a clean start, and }
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{you've already made a start. doesn't look that clean, though.}
<A>__{here's the awkwardness. lilly looks guilty and embarrassed.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i hated to take your money, but }
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{don't be sorry. you're not taking it.}
<A>__{lilly reacts as though he's slapped her. but then she gets her determination back. she splays out both hands, palm down, on the attache case on her lap.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{i need this, roy. i can't run without money, and if i can't run i'm dead.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{you must have some money.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{just a few bucks.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{and myra's stuff?}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(scornful)}
<D>__{her credit cards. how far am i gonna get with that?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{far enough. maybe up to san francisco. or st. louis, someplace new. start over.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{at what?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{you're smart, lilly, and you're good looking. you won't have any trouble finding a job.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(appalled)}
<D>__{a job? i've never had a legit job in my life!}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{well, you're gonna start, if you hope to live through this. a square job and a quiet life. you start showing up at the track or the hot spots and bobo's boys will be all over you.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{roy, i know what to do with myself! it's a big world out there.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{not any more. lilly, listen, i'm giving you good advice. i'm following it myself.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(doesn't get it)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i thought it over, and you were right. you wanted me out of the rackets, and now }
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(bedeviled, aggravated)}
<D>__{roy, that's fine, but i don't have time for this. bobo }
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i thought you'd be happy for me. after all, you }
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{bobo isn't after you! bobo's after me, and he's goddamn good! but so am i. i'm a survivor, roy. i survive.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i know you do, so that's why }
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{and to survive, my way, i need money. bobo knows about the stash in the car, so i didn't dare touch it, not if lilly dillon's dead. so that leaves this.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{lilly sits back again, brooding at roy, trying to think how to get to him, how to get through him or around him. she sighs, licks her lips.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{you want a drink?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i don't think so. you probably shouldn't either.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{no, but i'm goddamn thirsty. ice water?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{yeah, sure, that sounds nice.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{i will get it.}
<A>__{she stands, putting the attache case on the sofa next to where she was sitting. roy, with a faint smile, watches her leave the room.}
