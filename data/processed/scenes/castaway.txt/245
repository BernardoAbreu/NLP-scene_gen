<L>__{exterior raft next morning}
<A>__{chuck splashes sea water on his face. adjusts the water still.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{please don't leak. please.}
<A>__{chuck picks up the smallest fish. it's half digested. he washes it in the ocean, trigger fish come up and nibble at his fingers.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{don't look at me. it was that dorado.}
<A>__{he cuts the small fish and hangs it on the stays.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{you know, wilson, every now and then we should say thank you. thank you god.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{thank you for fucking up my life.}
<A>__{suddenly something bumps the raft. hard. then again.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{not again.}
<A>__{fins cut the water. sharks. a big hammerhead bumps the raft. badchuck hums the theme from "jaws." chuck takes his spear stabs at the shark.}
<C>__{badchuck}
<D>__{he's going to get you, going to get you...}
<A>__{another one circles in, bumps the raft.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{get away from me!}
<A>__{the shark circles again, that big hammerhead like a nightmare.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{get him get him get him.}
<A>__{he stabs at it with his spear. he might as well have stabbed concrete. the shark circle, chuck stabs again. but the shark is gone.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{where are you? where are you?}
<A>__{stabs again and again at the empty ocean.}
<C>__{goodchuck}
<D>__{stop! you're using energy. move slowly. be patient.}
<A>__{chuck kneels, wavering, on the raft. the ocean is calm. suddenly, bump. the raft tilts. chuck hangs on. then a shark appears, just out of spear range. its lifeless black eyes seem to stare right through chuck. if the dorado was a gift from god, this is a message from hell. then the shark is gone.}
