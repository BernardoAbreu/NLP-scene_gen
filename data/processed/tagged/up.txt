<C>__{gamma}
<D>__{i'm getting prunes and denture cream! who are they?}
<C>__{beta}
<D>__{ah man, master will not be pleased. we'd better tell him someone took the bird, right alpha?}
<A>__{alpha, a doberman pinscher, sits with his back to them.}
<C>__{alpha}
<P>__{(high pitched voice)}
<D>__{no. soon enough the bird will be ours yet again.}
<A>__{alpha's voice is high and squeaky, as if he's breathed in helium.}
<C>__{alpha }
<D>__{find the scent, my compadres and you two shall have much rewardings from master for the toil factor you wage.}
<A>__{beta and gamma look at each other.}
<C>__{beta}
<D>__{hey alpha, i think there's something wrong with your collar. you must have bumped it.}
<C>__{gamma}
<D>__{yeah, your voice sounds funny!}
<A>__{beta and gamma laugh. alpha turns. they stop laughing.}
<C>__{alpha}
<D>__{beta. gamma. mayhaps you desire to squirrel!}
<A>__{all three dogs look for the squirrel. false alarm.}
<C>__{alpha }
<D>__{mayhaps you desire to challenge the ranking that i have been assigned by my strength and cunning?}
<C>__{beta}
<D>__{no no. but maybe dug would. you might want to ask him.}
<A>__{beta and gamma snicker derisively.}
<C>__{gamma}
<D>__{yeah, i wonder if he's found the bird on his very special mission.}
<C>__{alpha}
<D>__{do not mention dug to me at this time. his fool's errand will keep him most occupied, most occupied indeed. ha ha ha. do you not agree with that which i am saying to you now?}
<C>__{beta}
<D>__{sure, but the second master finds out you sent dug out by himself, none of us will get a treat.}
<C>__{alpha}
<D>__{you are wise, my trusted lieutenant.}
<A>__{alpha powers up a video screen on beta's collar.}

<C>__{alpha}
<D>__{impossible! where are you?!}
<C>__{dug}
<D>__{i am here with the bird and i will bring it back and then you will like me. oh, gotta go.}
<A>__{on the collar screen, the dogs get a fleeting glimpse of a boy's face. it's russell.}
<C>__{russell}
<P>__{(on video screen)}
<D>__{hey dug! who you talking to?}
<A>__{the video screen goes blank. the dogs bark excitedly.}
<C>__{beta}

<C>__{gamma}
<D>__{why's he with that small mailman?}
<C>__{beta}
<D>__{where are they?}

<C>__{muntz}
<D>__{"kevin?"}

<A>__{carl glances around nervously. out the window, sitting on the roof of his house, sits the bird!}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{well! it's been a wonderful evening, but we'd better be going.}
<A>__{carl gets up and pulls russell from the table.}
<C>__{muntz}

<C>__{carl}
<D>__{we don't want to take advantage of your hospitality. come on russell.}
<A>__{carl leads russell toward the door.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{but we haven't even had dessert yet.}
<A>__{muntz follows behind them slowly, menacingly.}
<C>__{muntz}
<D>__{no, the boy's right. you haven't had dessert. epsilon here makes a delicious cherries jubilee.}

<A>__{dug points to a tunnel opening deeper inside the cave. carl and russell run toward him. the cave leads to a steep incline. the dogs are getting closer. there's no choice but to jump. the lift from the overhead balloons allows carl and russell to leap down the incline, like astronauts.}
<C>__{dug}
<D>__{go toward the light, master!}
<A>__{dogs climb down the rocks, closing in on carl and russell. the bird sees the dogs. she jumps off the house and lifts carl and russell on her back. she runs through the cave, towing the house behind her. russell and carl hang on for dear life. bang bang bang! balloons pop as they scrape across the ceiling. the house lowers. ahead, a giant rock sits in their path. carl tugs at the house but it crashes against the rock, pulling russell onto the ground.}

<A>__{the dogs run around dug. alpha bites dug by the neck and throws him out of the path. the bird carries carl, russell dragging along behind. she rounds a corner. russell swings out over the abyss. the bird jumps from rock spire to spire. russell swings back and forth wildly in the air.}

<C>__{carl}
<D>__{gimme your hand!}

<C>__{russell}
<D>__{hang on to kevin!}
<A>__{carl grabs onto kevin and picks dug up by the collar. just as the dogs reach our gang, the house's momentum carries them across the chasm. alpha bites the bird on the leg but is kicked loose and falls into the river below. carl lands hard but safely across the river chasm. the dogs are stuck on the other side. carl painfully gets up. he looks up at his house. it's still intact. he breathes a sigh of relief.}
<C>__{russell }
<D>__{kevin!}
<A>__{the bird tries to stand but squawks pitifully and falls back to the ground. russell rushes to her side. the bird's leg has been injured badly by the dog bite. she can't stand. russell applies a bandage. from the distant labyrinth of rocks, the bird babies call. kevin calls back to them. she tries to stand, but can't. russell runs to her side.}

<D>__{no no no! kevin! stay down.}
<P>__{(to carl)}
<D>__{she's hurt real bad. can't we help her get home?}

<D>__{no, my pack is not following us! boy they are dumb.}

<C>__{dug}
<D>__{hey, i know a joke. a squirrel walks up to a tree and says i forgot to store acorns for winter and now i am dead. ha! it is funny because the squirrel gets dead.}

<C>__{russell}
<D>__{and afterwards we'd go get ice cream at fentons. i always get chocolate and he gets butter brickle. then we'd sit on this one curb, right outside, and i will count all the blue cars and he counts all the red ones, and whoever gets the most, wins. i like that curb.}
