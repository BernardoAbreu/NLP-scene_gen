<P>__{(to martha)}
<D>__{i called my dad today to ask for money.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{does patrick know?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{he asked me to. sometimes, if there's something we really need i will call.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{how was it?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{fine, they're not bad people.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{did he give you the money?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{yeah. he thinks i'm on drugs.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{do you tell him you're not?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{no, that's why he gives it to me. i guess he'd rather pay for it than think i'm sucking dick for it.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i've done drugs. not a lot but i've tried everything pretty much, except heroin.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{it's good to try everything at least once. you find out who you are that way. what about drinking, do you drink?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i have, but i don't.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{good, we don't drink. it just makes you angry and less focused.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{don't get the wrong idea sarah. we don't talk to our old families.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i wouldn't call my dad anyway, no matter how much he paid me.}
<A>__{patrick and watts walk out of the woods.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{martha}
<D>__{hi patrick, did you meet sarah yet?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{sally, yeah.}
