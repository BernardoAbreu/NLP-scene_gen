<L>__{1994}
<B>__{credits over}
<A>__{wind on the water. soaring gulls and sand pipers glide over the pilings and sagging bulkheads.}
<C>__{older chuck }
<D>__{though i hadn't seen or spoken to sheldrake in over thirty years, it seemed impossible that his heart was the thing that had finally failed him...}
<L>__{interior late model car same}
<A>__{chuck gieg, 49, thin, windswept and handsome, is behind the wheel. he pulls down a narrow cobble stone street that leads to the wharf.}
<C>__{older chuck }
<D>__{i never got close to him, nobody did. but by the time we made tampa, i was sure i knew who he was, that i understood what he saw, what nourished his soul and tested his faith...}
<L>__{exterior wharf day}
<A>__{chuck stares out across the harbor. in the distance, the echoes of singing masts. shrouds and canvas softly ping. the small boats of mystic tug restlessly at their moorings.}
<C>__{older chuck }
<D>__{he had taken us to worship, where, what was for him, the holiest of holies. and, for us too by the end...}
<L>__{exterior doctors office later}
<A>__{chuck stands silently on the periphery of a gathering of people. they surround a small building, a neighborhood clinic. a worn gray stone, long in the earth, dedicates the structure. in memory of natalie "alice" sheldrake m.d., captain's wife and ship's surgeon of the brigantine albatross may 2, 1961 next to the stone a funeral urn. a young minister gropes for meaning.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{i didn't know richard sheldrake personally, but his many friends who knew and worked with him, wanted to make sure that he was returned home, here, to be remembered with his beloved wife...}
<A>__{chuck gazes out at the sleepy harbor, the minister's voice fading away. the afternoon wind is coming up with the tide. he quietly heads towards the water. drifting, drawn, lost.}
<C>__{older chuck }
<D>__{though he had moved on with his life, now even for the years, to hear him eulogized by strangers, seemed strange. he had been a hewner of stones, a pilot by the silent stars. like me, alone among many. but most of all for us, the crew of the brigantine albatross, he was always and would forever be... our skipper.}
<A>__{a ship's bell turns him around. ding ding. ding ding. a beautiful three masted schooner steady on the water slips into port. a picture out of another time, another place. it takes him away...}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior forest water tower day}
<A>__{a towering monolith, surrounded by tall oaks and sycamores. the tower is immense. a single ladder runs up to the top.}
<B>__{at the top}
<A>__{just above the tree tops, the view is spectacular. chuck gieg, 16, sits thin and unsteady. chuck's gaze is drawn upward to the building spring cumulus clouds. chuck's older brother will, 18, stout, self assured, pulls himself to the top.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you gonna jump? or are you just having a last look?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i was just thinking that i never had a new pair of shoes till i was twelve.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{it's no my fault i was born first. besides, nobody ever sent me on an eight month vacation, so ease up on the sad sack stuff.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{it's not a vacation, it's private school.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i thought this was your dream come true.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{that's not why he's sending me.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{why then.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{because it looks good.}
<A>__{chuck looks out, yearning. will considers him, troubled.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i'm just not like you. ya know? i'm never going to go to yale. i'm never going to be "william".}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{nobody says you have to be like me.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{he does.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you don't give him enough credit chas.}
<A>__{chuck takes a last look at the building clouds. the sky rumbles. distant thunder.}

<A>__{will shoves out a hand at chuck.}
<C>__{will}

<L>__{interior car day}
<A>__{chuck sits in the drivers seat. middy is in the back. charles slams the trunk and gets in. before chuck turns the ignition...}

<C>__{middy}

<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{no, i didn't.}
<C>__{middy}
<D>__{it says she was originally schooner rigged, but captain sheldrake turned her into a brigantine. i think square rigs look so much more romantic.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{me too.}
<C>__{charles}
<D>__{appearances aren't everything. keep your mind on the road.}
<A>__{chuck pulls over to the side of the road.}

<D>__{i don't feel like driving. okay?}
<A>__{charles regards him oddly.}
<L>__{exterior airport gate day}

<L>__{interior plane day}
<A>__{chuck settles into his seat next to the window. he watches as the world slips away beneath the wings of the}
<L>__{exterior airport customs bermuda day}

<L>__{16, thin and blonde, is in a heated argument with one of}
<A>__{the agents about his spear gun. rick march, 17, wise cracking and confident, shakes his head, smiling. he spots chuck, moves through the line and shoves out a hand.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{albatross?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{rick march. who the hell are you?}
<C>__{chuck}

<C>__{rick}
<D>__{look, meet us out front when you're through. if they try to take anything away from you like johnny quest up there, just make a list and we'll have 'em send it down to the boat.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{whatever.}
<A>__{one of the agent starts pulling things out of rick's duffel bag. he finds a dive knife.}

<D>__{hey, hey!! that's my stuff!!}
<L>__{exterior austin cab moving day}
<A>__{the car whizzes through the narrow streets of bermuda. calypso music sings from the radio. the streets are lined with small coral houses and exotic palms.}

<A>__{the boys are jammed inside with their things. in addition to chuck, rick and tod, is charlie stratton, also sixteen.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{well ricky boy, spear gun or no, it's sweet to be back in the world of rum and honey.}
<C>__{rick}

<D>__{me and skipper had a meeting of the minds.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{how's that?}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{i begged.}
<C>__{chuck}
<P>__{(warming a little)}
<D>__{what the "bowsprit affair"?}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{well, romeo here was on harbor watch and managed to sweet talk one of the local girls to have a go in the bowsprit.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{not just any 'local' girl.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{the 'local' mayor's 'local' daughter.}
<A>__{tod smiles, reminiscing.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{thing is, the net in the basket isn't very comfortable, so tod o wraps them up in the jib. after the deed was done...}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{he says they did the deed...}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{trust me, we did the deed.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{after the "alleged" deed was done, they fell asleep. big daddy lawford comes on deck at four bells and hears casanova sawing logs.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{believe me, i needed the rest...}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{he gets the whole crew on deck, gets us on the halyard, and orders the old "heave ho...".}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{up goes the jib and out roll tod o and the mayor's daughter, naked as pilot whales...}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(to tod)}
<D>__{i don't know who was more surprised, you or big daddy.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{to tell you the truth, i think it was her father.}
<A>__{at the top of a hill, the harbor comes into view.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{well gentlemen, there she is.}
<A>__{the cab stops. besides many colorful fishing boats, is the albatross. at ninety two feet, she dwarfs everything in the harbor. her white hull glows like ivory and her twin masts and yard arms tower above her deck. breathtaking.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{home sweet hell on the water.}
<L>__{exterior dock day}
<A>__{the boys pile out of the taxi. what seemed like a pristine ship from the hill looks like a rust bucket up close. the white paint is streaked and barnacles cover the hull. looks of disappointment.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{what happened to it?}
<A>__{a voice from behind turns chuck.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{she cleans up. we'll have her ship shape before we shove off.}
<A>__{this is bill butler, 15, removed, the youngest of the crew and... first mate. bill gives chuck a friendly slap on the back and climbs aboard. he is greeted by a viking giant of a man, lawford, 37, and bearded, the ship's english professor. puffing on a huge havana cigar, he stares coolly down at tod and the others. he speaks with the voice of moses.}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{"that this same child of honor and renown, this gallant hotspur, this all praised knight, and your unthought of harry chance to meet. for every honor sitting on his helm, would they were multitudes, and on my head. my shames redoubled! for the time will come...}
<A>__{chuck feels something and looks up where he meets the intense stare of a man standing between the deck cabins. their eyes lock.}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{... that i shall make this northern youth exchange, his glorious deeds for my indignities."}
<A>__{then, the man is gone. haunting. only chuck has seen him. tod smiles back at lawford impishly.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{would you be addressing me, sir?}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{i would.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{lawford}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{henry the iv part i act i scene ii. i suggest you read it.}
<A>__{lawford sneers and walks away. it's all a show.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it means shakespeare. b o r i n g.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{it means if he catches anybody basket napping on watch this passage, he's gonna use their lizard for 'cuda' bait.}
<C>__{rick}
<P>__{(lightly)}
<D>__{well that's a hell of a how do you do.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{drop your gear, go below and pick yourself some bunks.}
<A>__{chuck and the others climb aboard.}
<L>__{interior main cabin day}
<A>__{chuck makes his way down the companionway into the main cabin. other crew members are already unpacking. the sleeping arrangement is pullman style with two rows of bunks on each side of the cabin. in the middle of the room is a gimbaled table. this is where the crew will eat and study.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{listen up. this is chuck gieg.}
<A>__{among the crew feature robin weathers, 16, a cherub with soft puffy cheeks and terry lapchick, 17, skinny and rodent like. robin approaches with a hand extended. he carries a 8x10 photo of a young man in a football uniform.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i'm robin.}
<A>__{chuck regards the photo.}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(flat)}
<D>__{that's my brother. he's dead.}
<A>__{apprehensively chuck shakes and retreats to a lower bunk. robin tacks up the picture above his bunk. terry unpacks in front of one of the lower berths. a loud "thud!" turns everyone around. a duffel bag lies at the bottom of the companionway. a large imposing figure climbs into the cabin. this is john goodall, 17, over six feet, big and broad. his hair is slicked back "dean" style and wears a full day's growth of bread on his face. compared to the others, he looks all man. everybody clears from his path. he stops in front of the lower, center bunk (terry's bunk) and drops his bag.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i will take this one.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{you probably didn't notice, but this bunk has been taken.}
<A>__{john just glares at him, then dumps all of terry's things onto the blanket on the bunk, gathers it up and tosses it into the remaining upper berth. terry watches, intimidated.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{anybody gotta problem with that?}
<C>__{rick}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{absolutely not.}
<A>__{john climbs into his bunk and closes his eyes. bill enters, followed by several adults. dr. alice sheldrake, 30, smart, attractive and tough, is ship's surgeon and skipper's wife. lawford appears with george pascal, 30's from brazil, dark, and fit.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{alright, listen up. this is dr. alice sheldrake.}
<A>__{the guys stumble over only half listening.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{i'm ship's surgeon. i'm in charge of aches, pains, biology, math and science.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{george pascal here is ship's cook.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{if you want to keep all your fingers, stay the hell out of my galley unless you're invited.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{some of you already know mr. lawford.}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{i have been charged with the dubious task of insuring your literary education.}
<A>__{lawford puts a hand on bill's shoulder.}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{bill butler is your first mate. but don't let his size fool you.}
<A>__{bill gives a half reluctant wave.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{so when the hell do we get to meet el capitan?}
<A>__{snickering.}
<C>__{terry}
<P>__{(aside)}
<D>__{maybe he's getting his wooden leg waxed.}
<A>__{laughter. a sound stops the laughter. almost on cue, the sound of slow methodical footsteps, pace the deck above them. then a shadow falls across the skylight, blocking the light. ominous. they all notice and look up.}
<C>__{lawford}
<P>__{(mysterious)}
<D>__{you'll meet him. soon enough.}
<L>__{interior main cabin sunrise}
<A>__{dawn glows orange in the skylights above the cabin. the only sound is the heavy, even breathing of slumber. suddenly, a booming voice rumbles down the companionway.}
<C>__{lawford }
<D>__{arise, arise, arise...}
<A>__{chuck wakes, disoriented. terry bolts upright and hits his head on the low ceiling. ouch. tod, rick and charlie are up instantly. lawford's voice echoes through the ship.}
<C>__{lawford }
<D>__{exultation is the going of an inland soul to sea past the houses past the headlands into deep eternity bred as we, among the mountains can the sailor understand the divine intoxication of the first league out from land?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{but i suppose we'll answer that question soon enough gentlemen. soon enough.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{what question?}
<A>__{chuck tries to assimilate lawford's words. robin swings his feet over the side of his bunk with a tortured look. john rolls over and pulls his pillow over his head.}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(foggy)}
<D>__{what the hell is going on?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{maybe it's an air raid.}
<A>__{in crisply pressed shorts and shirt, bill butler steps through the aft bulkhead. he raises a bowswain's whistle and blows. ooowwweeeeooo!!!! chuck and robin grab their ears. it's a nightmare. terry jumps and hits his head again.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{roll out sailors! all hands on deck! sixty seconds. sixty seconds.}
<A>__{he blows the whistle again. this time it brings even john to his feet, staring down at bill in a blind rage. bill looks up and casually notices him.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you gotta problem goodall?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you blow that thing again i will shove it so far up your ass, you're gonna need dental floss to get it out.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{just get on deck.}
<A>__{bill turns and disappears topside.}
<L>__{exterior deck dawn}
<A>__{the sun has barely cracked the horizon as the crew staggers onto the deck, shirtless and shivering.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{line up! single file. single file.}
<A>__{the crew lines up. john is the last one through the hatch and he lets us know his boundaries are being pressed.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{everybody swims.}
<A>__{the boys are aghast.}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{don't think people, just go! go, go, go, go, go!!! swim you win, stay you pay!!}
<A>__{rick is the first one through the gunnel door, followed by tod and charlie. they howl and scream as they hit the water. the rest follow like lemmings. but john stands defiantly with his arms folded.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{now what's the problem, goodall? everybody swims.}
<A>__{the crew are piling back on deck. george stands in the open galley door. the smell of fresh bacon is intoxicating.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't.}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{you will if you wanna eat. right george?}
<A>__{george nods, wielding a butchers knife. the crew stand shivering, waiting on john.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(to bill)}
<D>__{you gonna swim for your breakfast?}
<A>__{bill gives john a long look then strips to his shorts, swings into the rigging and climbs up to the first yard arm. he looks down at the water some twenty five feet below. it's a long way. robin turns away. lawford booms in a voice that echoes across the harbor.}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{"down, down beneath the deep, that oft in triumph bore him, he sleeps a sound and peaceful sleep, with the salt waves dashing over him." lord byron gentlemen.}
<A>__{with that bill leaps and hits the water with a huge kersplash! he swims to the boarding ladder, pulls himself up and gets in john's face.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{everybody swims. now, i've been in twice. so i guess i will be eating your breakfast too.}
<A>__{john considers him, then strips off his shirt. but instead of walking over to the gunnel door, he jumps into the ratlines, climbs to the foretop and looks down. he manages a thin smile then climbs to the second set of ratlines past the third yard and continues to the top yard arm the topgallant. it's a pissing contest and everybody knows it.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i got five bucks says he doesn't.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i got five that says he doesn't live.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{i will take a dollar of that.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{this is crazy!}
<A>__{robin refuses to watch. the others share a look. john makes his way along the foot ropes and stands at the end of the yard. he tosses a look towards bill but with no way to back down, he launches into the air. everyone gasps as he thunders through the air in a broad swan dive. falling, falling, falling...}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{jesus.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i can't watch this.}
<A>__{john hits the water like a bullet. the crew run to the side waiting for him to come up. nothing. finally, he breaks the surface. easy. he climbs up waiting, somehow, to claim victory. suddenly, they all feel it. a presence. he has appeared silently on top of the chart house, like a phantom gazing down at them, back lit by the sun the boys must squint to see him. richard sheldrake, (skipper), ageless and windswept, casually reaches up to a block and tackle with one arm and glides to the deck. he is powerfully built and bronzed from the sea and sun. he carriers the burden of command like a cross. soft spoken and remote, he is a man to be reckoned with. the crew know they are in the presence of someone larger than life.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{skipper on deck!}
<A>__{the crew line up clumsily. skipper has a gaze that blazes right through them. he looks out to sea. searching, ominous. he waits until the silence is filled with everyone's attention.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{you know what's out there? wind and wave and rain. endless glassy pools that'll hold a sailing ship for weeks and then spit her out into the eye of the kind of hurricane. a blow that could knock the bridge off a battleship. reefs and rocks and sandbars that'll tear the belly from her and enough fog and night to hide it all.}
<A>__{he spits into the water. the crew sheepishly throw glances to the horizon.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{so look out there... and explain to me why any man in possession of any sense at all, would take on the sea with sail?}
<A>__{skipper turns his gaze back to the boys. there is a fire in his eyes. nobody dare answers.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{because there's something else out there. it beckons in the wind and sings in the shrouds. voices. whispering...}
<A>__{his ear to the wind.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{they're voices of men. calling. men you don't even know. men you can't even imagine. it's a seed, a wish, that part of you and i that aches to be alive, that was banished by everything we've ever been taught or told. it's a part of us that can only be found on mountain tops and deserts, in the deepest caverns, smoking battle fields and... across oceans.}
<A>__{he turns back to the sea, dark.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{out there, is where it all waits.}
<C>__{older chuck }
<D>__{he was everything i had expected, part ahab part queeg and even bligh. he spoke in whispers and answered all queries with efficiency and directness. he had gone to sea for the first time at fifteen, the same age as bill butler. and as he looked upon us that first day it must have been as though he were staring into a mirror.}
<A>__{skipper manages a sobering look and climbs on top of the chart house. he pats a small brass sign that is welded to the main mast and reads the inscription.}
<C>__{skipper}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{"where we go one, we go all."}
<A>__{with that, he disappears below. nobody moves. this is exactly the kind of man you want around when the shit hits the fan.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{this is gonna be a long eight months.}
<L>__{interior main cabin day}
<A>__{the boys devour a hearty breakfast. tod is the 'galley slave' and fills glasses with orange juice.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{chow down boys. the milk and eggs are the first things to go once we put out.}
<A>__{john enters balancing two plates heaped with food.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{you know we gotta dumbwaiter for that.}
<A>__{john looks over to the dumbwaiter mounted in the wall.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{not that one. tod o here.}
<A>__{the guys groan.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{har, har, har...}
<A>__{john approaches the full table, glaring down at terry who doesn't notice him. finally he looks up, startled.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i'm done. i'm finished...}
<A>__{he scrambles to get up and clear his plate. john sits down without a word. the others notice the two plates of food.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{hungry, goodall?}
<A>__{he just grunts and starts eating. robin watches him.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what's your problem?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{why'd you jump?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{because i felt like it.}
<P>__{(sharp)}
<D>__{what do you care?}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(aside)}
<D>__{i couldn't do it.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{well, as soon as you grow some balls, let me know.}
<A>__{robin bristles.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{screw you!}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{he's right. it was a stupid stunt.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you heard me.}
<A>__{john grabs charlie by his private parts and hoists him into the air. charlie gasps, the air sucked from his lungs.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{don't ever call me stupid.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{come on, he didn't mean anything.}

<D>__{it seems we're short on singers.}
<A>__{skipper walks amid ship and addresses the crew.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{everyone sings aboard a wind jammer gentlemen. it lets everyone know you're in sync. it shows unity, that all thoughts are one. a crew that sings together stays together. besides, i like it. so, pipe up and be sailors.}

<P>__{(in a whisper)}
<D>__{everybody swims, everybody sings... what's next? tap dancing?}
<A>__{lawford and rick leap up onto the line pulling it down with their body weight. they sing out the chorus. the crew returns the song, somewhat reluctantly as the great mainsail starts to rise.}

<A>__{the newcomers watch bill with new found respect. george, john and the others climb to the forecourse, and out onto the footropes. it's unsteady work and there's confusion everywhere. but through it all, they continue to sing. lawford moves to the mainsheet on the port side while the others move into their positions. when bill sees the yardarm crew is in place...}

<A>__{as the tops are released, the giant forecourse drapes into a scalloped pattern. as the bow falls off the wind the snapping main and jib billow. stiffening to the wind, the ship heels and surges forward. before her awakening power, everyone changes their stance and grabs for a handhold. lawford slowly pays out the mainsheet while the forecourse crew move up the ratlines releasing the stops on the other squaresails.}

<P>__{(in a whisper)}
<D>__{ah... northeast... sir.}

<D>__{northeast sir!}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{unfurl the squares!}
<A>__{tod's group first uncleats the clewlines and buntlines and the great squaresail drops and billows to fullness sending a shudder through the rig. the bow's wake sizzles with the added surge. as each of the squares fall, alice and lawford move to their sheets, setting each sail's position. chuck looks up, amazed at the sheer magnitude and beauty of the canvas that the albatross carries.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{raise the inner jib! raise the forestaysail!}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{watch the tell tales chuck. if we jibe now we'll have a lot of people in the water.}

<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{behold gentlemen. the power of the wind!}
<A>__{as the sails billow the albatross seems transformed. everyone stops and looks up. the vessel heels and with a powerful surge, launches into the waves. white foam splashes over the bowsprit as the hull thunders through the water. chuck's face is full of wonder. it is a magical moment. then the crew begins to cheer.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{did we lose anybody?}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{not yet.}

<D>__{that low passed through last night. may be a little bumpy out there.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{it's time these boys saw some real blue water.}
<L>__{exterior the open sea later}
<A>__{the bow of the albatross explodes through the top of a fifteen foot swell. the sky is clear but the wind is fierce. in spite of the seas the ship is trimmed and sailing well. the crew has never seen mountains of water like this. disaster seems imminent. bill has assembled them in front of the wheel house. they are all holding on for dear life. even john seems shaken. skipper magically stands effortlessly before them on the rolling deck. he remains perfectly dry.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{well... now that i have your undivided attention... i'd like to take this opportunity to make a few points...}
<C>__{terry}
<P>__{(aside)}

<A>__{caught, terry and phil button up.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{second, the next one of you who doesn't jump like a bunny when mr. butler gives an order is gonna spend the rest of this trip scrubbing bilges. he's a better sailor today than any ten of you will be when this is all over.}
<A>__{skipper directs the next comment directly at john.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{and if i catch anybody, ever, jumping off a yard arm again i will personally break what bones are left and send you home in a wheel chair.}
<A>__{a wave explodes over the bow. a wall of water crashes over the deck knocking down several of the boys. terry can't take it anymore and explodes.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{we're gonna die!!! we're all gonna die!}
<A>__{he lunges at skipper but lawford one arms him.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{excellent pointerior as you might have noticed, being out here pretty much puts you in the moment. if you panic, if you lose your head, you die. maybe you take your mates with you. how'd you like to have to bet on terry here getting us home today? each one of you is responsible for the rest. "where we go one, we go all". if your buddy is asleep at the switch we're all fish food.}
<A>__{he's making his point which is lost on no one.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{the ship beneath you is not a toy and sailing is not a game. the albatross will take us far gentlemen, but she demands constant attention. respect her, and we'll do fine. oh, and one more thing. there is nothing that goes on, on this boat that i don't know about. she speaks to me in the night. so don't test me. not even a little.}
<A>__{skipper walks over and puts an arm around terry who is fighting sobs.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{nothing like experience to put things in perspective. huh son?}
<P>__{(to bill)}
<D>__{alright. let's go home.}
<L>__{interior chart house day}

<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{shit?!!!}
<A>__{he slams a text book into john's hands.}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{read for me please the words of mr. keats at the bottom of the page.}
<A>__{john stares back, simmering. robin interrupts the potential confrontation and reaches for the book.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i will read it. i mean i don't mind.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{shut up donut.}
<A>__{john pushes robin's hands away and studies the page for a moment. he begins reading but struggles with the cadence.}

<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{brilliant, seasoned, wise, of the mind; "... ruled as his demesne." he commands the voyage of the imagination, like a god.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{that is what one of the greatest literary minds of modern times, mr. boutillier, has to say about homer.}
<A>__{he snatches the book back.}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{you think the odyssey is dull? i will tell you something, it's about each one of you right now. doubt and expectation. friendship, community, self sacrifice and accountability.}
<A>__{he holds up the texterior}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{this isn't just a story!! it's history made allegory. it is a philosophical handbook for life! it holds the secret of this very voyage.}

<C>__{robin}
<D>__{bill!! skipper!!}
<A>__{robin freezes. skipper leaps into the rigging like a spider and, in a few seconds, wrestles chuck free and carries him down to the deck. chuck coughs, catching his breath. the color is gone from skipper's face. this was a close call.}

<D>__{you all right?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{it was my fault. i slipped.}

<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{he's been beyond the reach. to the edge of the abyss and back. he'll do well by us all george. he's a real salt. there's no malice in him and there's nothing more dear to him than his boys. so sleep well my friend.}

<C>__{older chuck }
<D>__{the storm lasted sixteen hours and it set us all on equal footing. it was the first time that we shared an episode on an even plane. as we stood our watches we were equally out of control of our situation, regardless of our physical abilities or social backgrounds. and though our real feelings lay hidden beneath bravado and defiance, we were no longer strangers.}

<C>__{tom}
<D>__{land ho!!! land ho!!!}
<A>__{everyone turns around to look. the guys at the stern let go of george and he nearly tumbles overboard. in that instant, the shark slips off of the gaff, and disappears back into the sea. robin and george share a stunned look.}

<A>__{without warning. john lunges at phil. phil screams, trying to defend himself. the guys all dive in. suddenly it's an all out brawl. john out of control pounding phil's head against the seat of the boat. suddenly, from behind, comes a blistering "thwack!!" as chuck breaks an oar over the back of john's head. stunned, john lets go of phil and turns, blood dripping from the back of his head.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{nobody calls me an idiot.}
<A>__{he weaves, then passes out, falling face down in the sand. the guys stagger to their feet, trying to recover.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{god damn it man. i think he broke my nose!}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{shut up, phil.}

<C>__{george}
<D>__{i got a live one!}
<A>__{skipper, alice and bill watch the shoreline as the boys launch the long boat into the surf. george is struggling. a beautiful tarpon leaps out of the water, but skipper never takes his eyes off of his boys.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{the thing about fishing george, is you need to let 'em run some. give 'em just enough slack so they don't break the line. but at the same time you've gotta keep enough tension to wear 'em down, bring 'em in slowly so they don't really know they're hooked.}
<A>__{suddenly george's line goes slack. he nearly falls over backwards.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i will try and remember that.}

<A>__{hound dog and hung over, bloodied and burned, the boys stand before skipper and the others. skipper looks dark and angry.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{you know what a loose cannon is? 'bout the worst thing that could happen to a wooden ship. all it took was one, crashing around the deck in a storm... it'd smash everything in its way, maybe take out a mast or punch a hole right through the hull. think about it, just one cannon not tied down, not anchored, could take a whole 'man of war' straight to the bottom.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(aside)}
<D>__{but we don't have any cannons?}
<A>__{chris jabs him in the ribs.}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(hushed)}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{skipper turns and faces them.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{now, if the skipper were smart, if he could see a storm building, why he'd cut loose every gun on his boat. even though it would leave him at a disadvantage in battle, he'd push 'em into the sea. better chance running for port than risk the entire ship, his crew.}
<A>__{he takes a pause making sure he has their attention for this part.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{people are like that sometimes. they cut loose and before you know it, they're knocking holes in everything. so you gotta ask yourself if it might not be better to just put 'em off before they sink the whole thing. i mean after all, you can always get new cannons.}
<A>__{he walks back to his place at the rail.}
<C>__{skipper}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i want a tight ship, everybody shaved and in clean clothes when we make curacao. if it goes well, if your mid terms are acceptable, i may reconsider my decision about the rest of the trip. that's all.}
<A>__{dejected, the crew goes below.}
<L>__{exterior deck day}
<A>__{under sail. skipper stands at the wheel overseeing the crew taking exams. each writes furiously as alice scribbles problems on the blackboard which hangs from the chart house door. as the boys scratch out the problems, john seems paralyzed. he looks over at phil and copies down his answer. he checks crib notes hidden in his shorts. chuck and robin both see this and exchange looks.}
<L>__{interior aft cabin day}
<A>__{john makes his way down the narrow corridor towards the head. robin follows. chuck drops down the aft companionway, intercepting john.}

<D>__{to take a piss.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{really?}

<D>__{you've gotta be kidding. get the fuck outta my way!}
<A>__{chuck throws open the engine room door and they shove john inside.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what the hell!!!}
<A>__{chuck manages to pin john. robin checks his pockets and comes up with the crib notes. chuck lets go. john snatches them, ashamed.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{takin' a piss?}
<A>__{john turns away.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{why, man?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't have to listen to this.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{yes you do, stupid. because if you don't, i'm gonna go right up there and have a heart to heart with skipper and you'll be on the first plane back to idiotville.}
<A>__{john lunges at chuck, sending them both sprawling. robin leaps on top of john.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{cut it out man!! stop it!!! what's the matter with you? if phil had caught you he'd have ratted you out in a second. you get caught cheating, you'll get kicked off the boat.}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{i cheated to get on the boat!!! all right?!}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{he lets go of chuck and stands up trying to hide his emotions.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i doctored my grades so i'd make the cut. i'm a moron, okay? you satisfied?!}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{you're not a moron.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{wanna bet? takes me half a day to get through one chapter of lawford and i still don't have any idea what the hell he's talkin' about. you know why it takes me so long to write papers? because i can't spell. while everybody else is sleeping, i'm in the rack with a flashlight and a dictionary.}
<A>__{john chokes back a sob.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hell, they even kicked me outa vo tech 'cause i couldn't read a slide rule.}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{they were gonna put me into special ed this year. i stole a copy of my transcript, changed all the grades. shit, who am i kidding. i will never pass the boards.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{listen, you don't cheat, and we'll make sure you get the grades. we'll start a private study group. nobody knows. you'll ace that test.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i'm in.}
<A>__{they turn and look to phil, who still shows the tell tail signs of their fight.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{me, too.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{why would you do that?}
<C>__{chuck}

<L>__{exterior curacao harbor dusk}
<A>__{as a blazing sun sizzles into the western sea, the albatross rounds a point and heads towards the docks several hundred yards away. on the dock, the students of the school wait. as soon as the ship is in view, they start to cheer. chuck squints.}

<D>__{good morning, ladies.}

<D>__{you've gotta be kidding?}

<D>__{she's gone... she's gone.}
<A>__{there is something remarkably touching about this young man trying to take care of him. he puts a hand on skipper's shoulder. it almost makes him crack. he pats bill's hand gently.}

<A>__{lawford nods sullenly. chuck looks out at the floating wreckage around them, silent, lost. suddenly, there is a 'thump' on the hull of the boat. the survivors share a confused look. then it comes again. chuck looks out at the surface of the water. it's suddenly alive... with sharks.}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{hands and feet inside the boats.}
<A>__{they come by the dozens. ramming the boats and rummaging through the debris. they swarm around the boats until it seems as if the water is boiling. chuck picks up an oar and starts beating wildly at the sharks.}

<D>__{aaaahhhh!!!!}
<A>__{the others take up the cause and in a moment they are all screaming and cursing the sharks. it's a frenzy of grief and anger.}
<C>__{older chuck }
<D>__{we slashed at the sharks as if striking out at the finger of god. and we all begged silently for the ability to understand what had happened. but, if there was a god that day, his answer came only in the moaning wind and our questions were left to drift unanswered, in the titanic ocean of our deepest grief.}

<D>__{is that what you were trained to do?}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{downing}
<D>__{then what do you think he was trying to do.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{let the blow drive the boat down wind. neutralize our canvas.}
<A>__{skipper is becoming uneasy. he sees what is coming.}
<C>__{downing}
<D>__{so when the captain gave you an order contrary to your training, you thought he was making a mistake?}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{then why son, why didn't you follow his order?}
<A>__{tod meets skipper's eyes.}
<C>__{tod}
<D>__{because i panicked.}
<A>__{the room is suddenly buzzing. tod's father stands up.}
<C>__{tod's father}
<D>__{that's not true tod.}
<C>__{terry}
<P>__{(to mike)}
<D>__{what the hell? what is he doing.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{son of a gun. he just sent skipper a life boat.}
<A>__{tyler turns to skipper.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{if this young man had responded instantly to your command, do you believe the ship might have been spared?}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{i don't know that anything could have prevented what happened.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{then what are you trying to say then?}
<A>__{skipper stands.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{maybe you can't see what's happening here, but it's clear to me.}
<P>__{(to tod)}
<D>__{i appreciate what you're trying to do tod. maybe you could live with it, but i couldn't.}
<P>__{(to tribunal)}
<D>__{if you think i'm going to let a sixteen year old take responsibility, then you underestimate me. the albatross was my ship. the ocean academy was my school. her loss is mine and mine alone.}
<P>__{(to others)}
<D>__{i can't bring your sons back. if you want my ticket, if that will ease your loss, it's the least i can do. this...}
<A>__{skipper pulls out his wallet and takes out his license.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{this is easy. living with it, that'll be hard.}
<A>__{skipper turns and lays his license down in front of tyler. then he turns and begins walking towards the back of the room. the room erupts. crew members and their families hurl accusations and blame. cameras flash. tyler tries to regain control. suddenly chuck stands, tall.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{no!!! don't you walk away! not now. not after all of this!!!!}
<A>__{skipper keeps walking. his head slumps. tyler pounds his gavel.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{that enough son!! order!! please!!}
<A>__{tears begin to stream down chuck's face. his father, charles, slowly stands meeting his sons eyes. go for it.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{tell me skipper, was it all just a lie? "where we go one, we go all". we listened to you. we believed it. and we're still here!!}
<A>__{skipper keeps moving.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{shame on you then skipper. shame on you.}
<A>__{skipper reaches for the door. suddenly a sound stops him cold in his tracks. phil slowly rises. tears streaming down his face. tightly in his hands he grips the ships bell. ding ding. ding ding. ding ding. it is the ringing of the truth. the tolling of their unity.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{sit down!}
<A>__{phil ignores him. skipper slowly walks over, his eyes never leaving phil's. he stops, facing him. he gently takes his hands and silences the bell. then he smiles and puts a hand on the back of phil's head fighting his own emotions. he turns to chuck.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{tell them the truth. make them understand.}
<A>__{the room grows silent.}
<C>__{skipper}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{you tell them chuck.}
<A>__{chuck suddenly feels the eyes of the room.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{it's simple. bad things happen sometimes. it wasn't skipper or tod. it was all of us. everyone in this room. because we all knew the risks.}
<P>__{(to parents)}
<D>__{you sent us... you paid our tuition, you allowed us to go. so to invent a reason for why this happened, to pin it on one person, well that won't change anything. it'll just make our experience meaningless.}
<A>__{he turns to the tribunal.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{if you want to judge this man, judge him by his crew. judge him by alice and george. chris and john and robin. in one way or another each one of them gave their lives saving one of us. this may sound crazy but the albatross wasn't just a ship, or even a school. it was something that we made, that's inside us. that's who skipper is. that's what he taught us. i guess what it really was about was... the privilege of sacrifice.}
<A>__{chuck turns to skipper.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{isn't that right?}
<A>__{skipper nods.}
<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{that's right.}
<A>__{the room is silent. then, a voice. a golden tenor singing like the wind. everyone turns. it's bill.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{when the sun came up, there was whisky in the cup, and not a one of us was sober...}
<A>__{one by one the crew members stand and begin to sing. chuck turns, surprised to see his father rise and stand with him. words or not.}
<C>__{crew together}
<D>__{jenny thought she saw a picture when it really was the sun, then we knew the party was over.}
<A>__{they all stand facing skipper and sing. the voices build, sweeping over everyone like a wave.}
<C>__{crew together}
<D>__{oh my heart is sad, for leaving you today, but i know we'll meet again, when the moon is in the valley and the leafs are on the trees, we will come to clearly in the glen...}
<A>__{skipper meets chuck's eyes and those of his mates. only now is his job finished. he beams back. the music swells like an anthem, building, like a swell lifting a small wooden boat over a jagged reef, until it rests safely in the calm waters beyond. the crew come together around skipper one last time. they embrace.}
<L>__{exterior mystic seaport harbor day}
<A>__{older chuck has returned to the small building where the funeral services were held earlier. the people have gone but the funeral urn remains.}
<L>__{exterior pier day}
<A>__{chuck walks to the dock. he has the funeral urn in his hands. he steps aboard a small sailboat and begins untying her. the harbor master notices and steps out of his office.}
<C>__{harbor master}
<D>__{what do you think you're doing.}
<A>__{he walks over to the dock.}
<C>__{harbor master}
<D>__{all right friend, out of the boat.}
<A>__{he tries to board the boat but chuck greets him with the sharp end of a gaffing hook.}
<C>__{older chuck}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{stand away.}
<A>__{he looks into chuck's eyes and sees that he means business. he backs off. chucks pushes away and raises the sail. the harbor master watches, perplexed as the small boat moves off for open water.}
<L>__{exterior open sea sunset}
<A>__{bathed in the orange glow of the sun, chuck stands naked against the ivory sail.}
<C>__{older chuck }
<D>__{they didn't take his ticket that day. but why he never returned to the sea, i'd never know. perhaps he hadn't been able to free himself from the anchor of grief that had driven him to his knees aboard the gran rio, or that he no longer cared for the solitude and isolation of command without his alice. or maybe it was just that the waves that had spoken to him for so long, had grown silent. whatever it was, that thing, it had always troubled me. because, fate offers up no reasons. and maybe that's what i have traveled these thirty four years to say. maybe that is all i really know... and, that one man cared.}
<A>__{chuck turns to the sea and speaks.}
<C>__{older chuck}
<D>__{rest easy old salt. for together again, we'll sail.}
<A>__{with a powerful heave, he hurls the skipper's remains at the sinking sun and into the arms of neptune.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior beach sunset}
<A>__{the same sunset, but from another time. four young men walk along a deserted beach. a small boat has beached and rocks gently in the shallows. the boys run up and look at it. on the stern are painted the words: brigantine}
<B>__{albatross.}
<A>__{slowly pull back to reveal endless white sand, blue water, the young men and the boat.}
<C>__{older chuck }
<D>__{some time later we learned that one of our long boats had been recovered. several young men found it washed up on a nameless beach somewhere on the island of hispaniola. no one seemed to know who they were or where they came from, but they seemed to know of the albatross.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{sometimes in my dreams those faceless young men reveal themselves as my lost companions, and on the twilight coral sands of forever, between my slumber and conscious state, we race naked again, so open and in love with those precious moments, running, ever laughing, ever young, ever free.}
<T>__{slam cut to:}
<L>__{exterior galapagos dusk}
<A>__{young again, their hair sun bleached and skins brown, chuck, john, robin, rick, chris and tod, pound through the surf in a grinning footrace. brothers all. music builds.}
