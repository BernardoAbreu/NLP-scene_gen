<L>__{ext allen street day}
<A>__{the wagon bearing morgan's pine coffin waits in the street, hitched and ready. virgil is up front with the women, arm in a sling, pale. doc and kate wait on horses nearby. finished loading, wyatt looks around. people line the street, watching in silence. clum and his wounded wife turn away from the window of their lodgings next door, unable to meet his gaze. the very air feels charged with paranoia and recrimination, as if the whole town has suddenly become morally radio active. bystanders gape as josephine steps out of the hotel, regal and impervious as a queen, wearing a gawking scorn like a mink coat, her little white dog scampering after her. passing behan, he gives her nasty look and spits. she doesn't even break stride. lounging in front of the crystal palace with the other cowboys, stillwell gives curly bill an enquiring look.}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{naw, she's nobody. wyatt junked her.}
<A>__{passing wyatt, she doesn't even glance at him. doc sighs:}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{and so she walked out of our lives forever.}
<A>__{without a word wyatt climbs onto the wagon and shakes the reins, driving off. he pulls up in front of the cowboys. they make a show of pretending to hide their guns. wyatt looks straight ahead:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{i want you to know it's over. we're leaving and we're not coming back.}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{well... 'bye.}
<C>__{ringo}
<P>__{(sniffs)}
<D>__{hey, you smell that? smells like something died.}
<C>__{curly bill}
<P>__{(stifling a laugh)}
<D>__{oh, jesus, johnny...}
<A>__{allie's eyes flare, louisa stifles a sob. the cowboys snicker. wyatt clenches his teeth, still staring straight ahead, and drives on. a few beats then curly bill turns to ike:}
<C>__{curly bill}
<D>__{take frank and finish it.}
