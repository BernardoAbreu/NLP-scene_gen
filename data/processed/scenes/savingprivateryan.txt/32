<L>__{exterior st. mere late afternoon}
<A>__{a small town has been reduced to rubble and is still an active battlefield. heavy small arms fire. grenade and mortar explosions. medium artillery beyond. american soldiers crouch in doorways, firing at well placed germans. some french civilians dash across a street. a man and a couple of women, one carrying a child. they make it across and disappear into the remains of a building. miller runs up and flattens himself against a wall at a corner. sarge and the other men follow in leap frog, spread out down the block behind him. miller glances around the corner, taking a quick mental picture of a gathering of g.i.'s crouching in the cover of an alley across the street and down the block. they are captain hamill, about miller's age, and his men. as miller ducks back behind the corner, a german bullet smashes into the bricks where his head was an instant before. miller motions jackson across first.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{stay low.}
<A>__{jackson gathers himself, takes off. german bullets blast, kicking up the cobblestone behind him. jackson zig zags and makes it to the cover of the far side.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{dang! that was close!}
<A>__{miller nods to upham.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{your turn.}
<A>__{upham, scared shitless, doesn't move. miller speaks to him very gently.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{zig zag, change your pace a couple times, you'll be alright.}
<A>__{upham's frozen. he can barely breathe. miller sighs.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{okay, i'm going to draw fire for you.}
<P>__{(sternly)}
<D>__{but if i do, you goddamned well better go.}
<A>__{upham nods. miller gathers himself, takes a deep breath. close shot: miller's hand quivers.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{looks to upham}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{ready?}
<A>__{upham nods, still terrified.}
<B>__{miller steps into the open}
<A>__{stands motionless, presenting himself to the german snipers.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{go.}
<A>__{upham runs.}
<B>__{a german bullet hits the bricks near miller.}
<A>__{he doesn't budge. upham tears across the street very, very fast. reiben watches upham run.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{hey, that guy can move.}
<A>__{a german bullet whizzes past miller's ear. upham gets to the far side. miller ducks back around the corner. reiben and wade don't even react to what miller has just done. sarge is pissed. he shakes his head at miller, like an irritated parent.}
<C>__{sarge}
<P>__{(under his breath so only miller can hear)}
<D>__{damn fool.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{sir.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{captain, he's fast!}
<C>__{miller}
<P>__{(glances at sarge, speaks to reiben)}
<D>__{glad of it.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{on the other side of the street, crouches in a doorway with jackson. upham is a bit in shock, less from the nearness of the bullets than from what miller just did for him.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{dashes across the street.}
<A>__{german bullets trail him, shattering the cobblestones, inches behind him. he makes it across. calls back to sarge.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{bring 'em over.}
<A>__{upham, tries to thank miller.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{captain, i...}
<A>__{miller ignores him, motions to sarge, reiben and wade.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{one at a time.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{ducks out of the doorway and crouch runs down the block. he passes a:}
<B>__{bombed out building}
<A>__{out of the line of fire. a dozen dead american soldiers lined up on the ground. the battered, bloody bodies, only partially covered by ponchos. some badly wounded g.i.'s are being treated next to the dead. blood puddles have spread out onto the sidewalk.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{sees the dead and wounded, shows no reaction. runs to:}
<B>__{an alley}
<A>__{captain hamill and his men are bunched there, out of the line of fire. he's sending off a squad to continue their door to door. captain hamill fundamentals, short runs, double up at the corners, one man close, one man wide. be careful. go. the squad takes off. captain hamill sees miller. the two captains glance at the bars on their shoulders, then speak familiarly. captain hamill how was the road in?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{we had a jeep until a few hours ago, a nice one, it had a cute little flag with a couple of stars on it.}
<A>__{captain hamill oh, what a shame. one by one, miller's men join them in the alley.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{we called in a strike on the eighty eights that took it out, but it's the kraut spotter that counts, wherever the hell that bastard is.}
<A>__{captain hamill points across a wide field toward a distant chateau that has a private chapel with a fifty foot steeple. captain hamill that's where your boy is. we've been trying to get him since this morning. he killed two of my men trying to get close enough for a shot. miller eyes the distant steeple.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{jackson.}
<A>__{jackson steps up. miller points to the steeple. jackson knows what he's supposed to do. he puts down his m 1 and takes off the long, zippered, leather sheath, strapped to his back. he spits a massive bullet of tobacco juice, then calmly and methodically unzips his leather case and pulls out a very unusual, long barrel, rifle. miller and his men give him some room. hamill and his men, along with upham, watch curiously. jackson opens a two foot tripod with a flick of his wrist, sits down and carefully attaches the rifle to it. then he takes a scope from a narrow wooden box and mounts it. he adjusts the eye piece and clicks in the bolt action. upham is fascinated.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{what is that?}
<A>__{jackson pulls back the bolt and loads a single, over sized shell.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{thirty ought six, norton long barrel with dual groove, parallel rifling, elevated three glass scope and a single throw hammer.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{the army gave you that?}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{yep.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{you must be a hell a shot.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{not where i come from.}
<A>__{jackson sights on a tree about a thousand yards away and fires. evaluates. calibrates the scope. he re loads. jackson fires again. evaluates. perfect. he wipes the dirt and sweat from his forehead, puts his eye to the sight and waits, absolutely motionless.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{that must be four thousand yards.}
<C>__{jackson}
<P>__{(without taking his eye from the scope)}
<D>__{forty two hundred, i figure.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{you take account of the wind?}
<A>__{jackson doesn't dignify that with an answer but he looks back with an expression that clearly says, "what are you, some kind of fucking idiot?" reiben puts himself between upham and jackson.}
<C>__{reiben}
<P>__{(put on southern accent)}
<D>__{dang right, he take 'count of the wind, ain't ya'll ever heard a kentucky windage?}
<A>__{jackson keeps his eye to the scope and his finger on the trigger.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{reiben, how many time i got to tell you, i'm from tennessee.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{they got squirrels there, too, right?}
<A>__{jackson fires. waits. a tiny smile. he starts taking apart the rifle. a very impressed captain hamill barks to his radioman. captain hamill get a hold of command, tell them the st. mere road is open. the radioman cranks up his radio. captain hamill turns to miller. captain hamill how far back is the rest of division?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{very far, they're not coming this way, they're going to take caen first.}
<A>__{captain hamill goddamn it, i was afraid of that. we're in a lot of trouble up here, and it's gonna get worse before it gets better. how many men did you bring?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{five, but we not staying, we're on our way to ramelle.}
<A>__{captain hamill shit, are you the guys going up to find private ryan?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{yeah, you know about that?}
<A>__{captain hamill command radioed, wanted to know if he came in with the early wounded or dead. several of captain hamill's men, among them a gentle faced private, prick up their ears at the mention of private ryan. captain hamill we're supposed to tell you, they intercepted a german transmission after you left. the krauts have two companies on their way to ramelle to take back that bridge, they'll be there sometime late tomorrow.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{wonderful.}
<A>__{captain hamill if ryan's alive, you'd better get him the hell out of there before those krauts show up.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{how do we get out of here?}
<A>__{captain hamill you don't, until tonight, we're hemmed in real tight. after dark you try to slip out to the east. if you tip toe, stay off the main roads and roll a few sevens, you've got a fair chance of making it up to ramelle by tomorrow night. miller processes the information. captain hamill shakes his head. captain hamill tough, huh? three brothers? miller shrugs. captain hamill we sure as hell could use your help here, but i understand what you're doing?}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{yeah?}
<A>__{captain hamill good luck.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{captain hamill i mean it. find him. get him home. miller is a bit taken aback by captain hamill's forceful sincerity. then he shakes it off and motions to his men.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{let's find someplace to hole up.}
<A>__{miller nods to captain hamill, then, as he moves to the head of the alley, miller passes upham.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{sir, i'm sorry about what happened, i...}
<C>__{miller}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{it was nothing.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{but you could have gotten killed and i...}
<C>__{miller}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{like i said, it was nothing.}
<P>__{(to the men)}
<D>__{don't bunch up.}
<A>__{he takes off, crouch running back down the block. upham watches him go.}
<C>__{upham}
<D>__{did you see what he did, back there? he stepped right into the open, so i could get across.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{shit, that was no big deal.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{they can't kill him.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{like hell they can't.}
<C>__{reiben}
<D>__{wade's right, it's some kind of scientific, magnetic thing, i can't explain it, but i've seen it.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{we all have, he's got nine lives, or he's bulletproof, or some damn thing.}
<A>__{the men are equal parts joking and admiring. sarge is neither.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{no one's bulletproof. no one.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{c'mon, stay low.}
<A>__{sarge takes off after miller.}
