<L>__{exterior prague night}
<A>__{on a hill above the city is an old cathedral. the night is spooky, with harsh shadows playing across the cobblestones and medieval walls. a nervous young hacker makes his way down an alley. there is a door at the end of the alley. music can be faintly heard from inside.}
<L>__{exterior rooftop night}
<A>__{high above the street an intruder dressed all in black spies from the roof. he's watching with night vision goggles. he pulls out a crossbow and fires. a bolt flies, trailing cable. thunk! it sticks into the alley wall below.}
<L>__{exterior the alley night}
<A>__{as he passes by the ominous cathedral, the hacker spins, sure he's heard something. but there's nothing there. he continues on. then the intruder comes sliding down the zip line from above. wham! he kicks the hacker into the wall, knocking him out. the intruder pulls off his mask, revealing the chiseled features of a dashing british secret agent. his name is}

<D>__{i hate to drop in unexpectedly.}
<A>__{sterling searches the hacker and pulls a small black case from his coat. inside the case is a data chip. sterling tucks it away. sterling unzips his black jumpsuit, revealing a crisp tuxedo underneath. he pulls out car keys. in a quick insert we see the "aston martin" logo. as he strolls back out the alley, he hears something and flattens against the wall. a blacked out suv screeches to a stop, blocking his exit. the suv's headlights illuminate the slumped hacker. bad guys get out to investigate, pulling out weapons. cornered, sterling heads deeper into the alley, staying in the shadows. he gets to that door the hacker was heading towards. as he picks the lock sterling can hear music from inside. he smooths his hair and prepares to "blend in" with the crowd.}
