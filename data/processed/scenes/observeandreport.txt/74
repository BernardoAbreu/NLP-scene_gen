<L>__{interior psychological evaluation day}
<A>__{ronnie sits across from a female psychologist.}
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{okay, ronnie, today i will be giving you a psychiatric evaluation to determine if you're competent to enter into the police academy. it's really just a formality. don't want any serial killers working for us, now do we?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{no, ma'am, we don't.}
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{okay, ronnie, so let's start with your background. where are you from?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{born and raised right here.}
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{local boy. okay, and, ronnie, have you ever been convicted of any crimes?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{no, ma'am. my record is totally clean.}
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{do you now take any illegal drugs or have you taken any in the past?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{no, ma'am. i believe drugs are the path to self destruction and should be purged from the face of the earth with ruthless vengeance.}
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{any prescription medications?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{yes, for my nerves. a man in my line of work has a lot of stress to deal with. if you've seen the bloodshed i've seen, you'd be on the meds too. i where are you going with this?}
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{are you presently or have you ever been affiliated with the communist party?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i can't believe you'd even ask me that.}
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{have you ever been in the military?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{what branch of the military were you in?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{the kind of branch that doesn't exist on paper.}
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{okay, here's a real world scenario. you have a gun }
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{finally.}
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{that wasn't really the question, never mind, i think i got that one. um... here's one. do you feel like you would work well on a team?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{would i? yes. would i be more useful working alone, i would say definitely. i see myself more like a rambo kind of guy. a man who rolls solo. taking care of business on his own terms. kind of like a superhero or something.}
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{why do you want to become a cop?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i want to become a cop to help people. the world is a scary place with lots of evil everywhere. see, i have this vision of evil trying to get at the world from every angle and there i stand at the top of it all with my gun, just kind of blowing it away. just me and my weapons, cleaning up this whole town. i know i could do some good if i was just given a chance and everybody would be a lot better off.}
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{uh huh. so, what do you feel is the greatest danger facing a police officer today?}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{maybe russian gang activity, but you know what? i think i'm gonna have to go with evil on that one too.}
<C>__{psychologist}
<D>__{okay, i think we're good here. it's been a pleasure, ronnie.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{thank you, ma'am.}
