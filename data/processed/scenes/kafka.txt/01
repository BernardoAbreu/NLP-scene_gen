<A>__{a man's face his eyes filled with terror, beads of sweat crawling on his brow. he stands in the middle of a murky courtyard, perfectly still. waiting. watching. the balconies overlooking on successive floors, looming all around him, are empty. all is quiet. the man's name is eduard. he dares not move for fear of missing a single sound. and then he hears it. a small noise of movement nearby. he runs.}
<B>__{tiny alleyway}
<A>__{he runs alone in the dim light of the deserted morning.}
<B>__{crooked passageway}
<A>__{running for his life.}
<B>__{narrow lane}
<A>__{running on sheer pumping fear, long after the verge of collapse.}
<B>__{black tunnel}
<A>__{coming out into the light, but by no means out of danger, he allows himself a brief pause, gasping for air, just for a moment looking back into the gloom, starting to retreat again even as he does, then turning running ...}
<B>__{winding street}
<A>__{he runs on, past boarded up houses and shuttered inns, strange relics of the middle ages casting frightening shadows.}
<B>__{around a corner}
<A>__{eduard appears suddenly, quickly flattens himself back against the large notice board that covers the wall here, layers of expressionistic theatre and film posters pasted on it. he breathes painfully in short bursts, as silently as he can. he watches the corner he's just come from, the ornate archway through which any pursuer must emerge. nothing there. but then a shadow moves. eduard's shoulders tense. his eyes widen. he holds his breath. the shadow ... spreading ... eduard edges away ever so slowly, keeping his unblinking gaze on the archway, backing off, one arm brushing the notice board as he feels his way along it, macabre images on the posters, some torn and incomplete, revealing other fragments behind, eduard's eyes staring constant, no noise here at all and a hand! clamps over his face from behind. all of a sudden and out of absolutely nowhere and not a thing he can do about it. but he tries, his hands coming up to grip the arm that grasps him, an arm of iron. the hand is huge. it covers eduard's face almost entirely, only one eye gaping bloodshot through the fingers, ghastly fingers that, just for a second, seem almost inhuman, perhaps even fingers that seem incompatible on the same hand, a hand covered in scar tissue, starting to squeeze as it pulls eduard swiftly away.}
