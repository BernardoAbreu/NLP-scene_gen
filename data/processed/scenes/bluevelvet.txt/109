<L>__{68. interior dorothy's apartment day}
<A>__{jeffrey goes all around the baseboards, spraying. all the while he's getting a good look around the apartment. there is a window above the kitchen sink out to the fire escape. jeffrey looks around to see what dorothy is doing and she is watching him spraying. the apartment is smaller than he thought, so he sprays the kitchen very slowly and makes believe the sprayer is jammed. suddenly, there is knocking at the door.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{what is this. grand central station?}
<A>__{she opens the door. jeffrey looks. it's not sandy. a man, with a yellow sports coat, is standing there. jeffrey begins to sweat, because the man looked around dorothy to see him. dorothy says something to the man which jeffrey cannot hear. the next time jeffrey looks up, the man is gone. the whole thing looks to be turning out badly when jeffrey spots a key on the counter. on a long shot, he steals it just as the front door shuts. he wraps things up and gets out.}
