<L>__{interior palapa room day}
<A>__{schaefer is staring out the window, his weapon slack in one arm, still holding the paper. dillon enters, obviously excited about what he has found. he sees the papers on the floor. he reads through them quickly, growing even more excited.}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{this is beautiful! more than we ever thought. we got the bastards!}
<A>__{revised "hunter" 4 17 86 schaefer turns, striding slowly to dillon, handing him the paper he is holding.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{i think this is the one you want.}
<A>__{dillon reads it.}
<C>__{dillon}
<P>__{(reacting)}
<D>__{two days...that's all we had. in two days, three hundred of these bastards would have been equipped with all this. after they crossed the border, it would have taken a year to stop them.}
<P>__{(looks up)}
<D>__{we've averted a major guerrilla invasion, dutch...}
<A>__{schaefer moves in close to dillon, face to face, anger flaring in his eyes.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<P>__{(slow; deliberate)}
<D>__{it was all bullshit. all of it. from the start...you set us up, got us in here to do your dirty work.}
<C>__{dillon}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{that's right, i set you up. you're a veteran at this, dutch, i had to.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{why us?}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{because i told you, you're the best. i knew you could do it but i couldn't get you in here without a cover story.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{what story did you give to davis?}
<A>__{revised "hunter" 4 29 86}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{we've been lookin' for this place for months. the chopper must have gotten close when they got shot down. hopper was sent in to get my men. he was just doing his job. when he disappeared i had to clean this up, i had to stop there bastards. we were so close, we couldn't quit. we couldn't sleep through this one. i needed you, dutch, can't you see that?}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{to invade a foreign country, illegally? you lied, dillon. stacked the odds against us. set us up. you could have gotten us all killed.}
<P>__{(pause; looking at him)}
<D>__{you used to be one of us, dillon, someone i could trust with my life...}
<C>__{dillon}
<D>__{we've been through a lot together dutch. when we were together, no one could stop us, the hottest goddamned team the army ever saw. but things changed, i woke up. we're fighting them in a dozen goddamned countries. it's a fight we can't lose, dutch. we're all expendable assets, can't you see that?}
<A>__{schaefer takes the paper from dillon's hands.}
<C>__{schaefer}
<D>__{that's your problem, dillon. you always did put ambition before the lives of your men.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{my men are not expendable. i don't do this kind of work.}
<P>__{(crumples up paper in fist)}
<D>__{this is your dirty little war, not mine.}
<A>__{revised "hunter" 4 17 86 he stuffs the crumpled paper into dillon's shirt pocket. anna, regaining consciousness, groans, a heavy flow of blood running down her face from her head wound. hawkins appears at the door.}
<C>__{hawkins}
<D>__{major!}
<A>__{schaefer turns away from dillon and steps through the doorway into the palapa as anna moans again, mumbling something in spanish. dillon kneels, beside her.}
<C>__{dillon}
<P>__{(quietly; in spanish)}
<D>__{are you all right?}
