<A>__{suddenly the door of the hearse flies open and larry runs out. phil holds the phone away from his ear as barbara's shouting can be heard coming out of the receiver. he watches as larry just makes it to a cactus and is violently sick. he glances across to where the old melon woman watches, expressionless, from her stall. after a moment, larry wipes himself down and walks back to the car.}

<D>__{sorry barb, gotta go.}
<A>__{he goes to replace the receiver, and then pops in a last comment.}
