<A>__{betty and rita are moving down the corridor. they pass a small room and look in at a couch, wardrobe and make up table. they move on down the corridor to a door which is almost closed. betty touches the door and it seems to swing open on its own. they enter the room and stop cold. a scream starts to build inside rita. before them is a dead woman lying on a bed. great chunks of mattress are standing upright having been ripped and torn by shotgun blasts. a dried sea of blood surrounds the bloated, gray body of the woman. the scream comes out of rita as a force propelling her to look closer. betty lunges after rita, her eyes also not able to leave the sight. she covers rita's mouth with her hand and brings her close. the scream is stifled by betty's hand. in the silence that follows, knocking can be heard. betty freezes and keeps rita quiet with her hand still placed over her mouth, but she can't stop rita's violent shaking nor the horror in her eyes.}
