<L>__{exterior mark's house back yard night}
<A>__{naomi is out on the patio.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{what was that all about?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{he really pisses me off. jake is such an asshole.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{tell me about it.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{when we were going out, he was so mean to me all the time. i think he's compensating for his little dick that never even gets hard.}
<A>__{deacon chokes on his drink.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{well at least you were smart enough to dump him. i mean, you deserve someone who will treat you ... i don't know. really well.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{you know what you are?}
<A>__{deacon gets a little nervous.}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{you're a nice guy.}
<A>__{she kisses him on the cheek. deacon looks at her, then steels himself to make a decision. he kisses her! she's surprised, but not unwilling.}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{deacon?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{i've been wanting to do that for a long time.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{so why didn't you?}
<A>__{most guys would look away at this point, with a fabulous babe with pouty lips staring you down. but deacon passes the test: he stands his ground and kisses her again. she likes it. at a window, jake sees them kissing. he doesn't like it. at another window, fred sees it, too. and for a completely different reason, he doesn't like it either.}
