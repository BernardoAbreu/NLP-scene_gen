<L>__{exterior aboard hooper's boat night (tank)}
<A>__{we see brody, looking sick and nervous, holding on anxiously as the "fascinatin' rhythm" moves slowly ahead trolling at night. his glasses are already flecked with the white salt of dried seawater. he is wearing a life preserver. hooper is at the wheel, a chart spread in front of him, his eyes scanning the sea restlessly, checking the dials and gauges in front of him as well as the electronic depth finding and "fish finder" gear mounted in the cockpit. a green glow shines from the instruments on his face. two closed circuit tv cameras mounted below the hull flash their pictures onto monitors in the dash. in the aisle between the seats is a large container filled with unpleasant looking bait; hooper is long lining for signs of shark, and chumming.}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(indicating distant flashing beacon)}
<D>__{that's the cape light we're on the stretch where he's feeding, if he's still here.}
<A>__{brody, bored, tired, and slightly queasy, is trying to concentrate on anything but the motion of the boat. he stares at the sophisticated electronics displays.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{what is all this stuff?}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(ticking them off)}
<D>__{depth finder, fathometer, sonar, closed circuit tv fore and aft rdf, single side band...}
<P>__{(points to themselves)}
<D>__{and two loose nuts behind the wheel.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{can you tell from that if a big man eater is around?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{sometimes.}
<P>__{(indicates display)}
<D>__{look here something big, probably a school of mackerel clumped together. and staying right with us.}
<A>__{insert electronics screen it's blipping and peeping.}
<B>__{close on the two men}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{where'd you get all this?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{i bought it. both sets of grandparents set up trust funds for me; stocks went up, so i don't have to touch my principal.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{you're at the institute full time? or do you have a job?}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(a nerve has been touched)}
<D>__{it is a job. i'm not fooling around like some amateur. it's my life!}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{we gotta get back soon...}
<A>__{wide on the "fascinatin' rhythm" as it swings around the two men looking very small and vulnerable in the open sea, the low hanging mist obscuring their visibility in the night.}
<B>__{close on brody}
<A>__{he hears something, his eyes widen. it is the "bump thump" of something scraping the hull.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{hooper looks up and cuts the wheel hard, as the same time dropping the engines into neutral, and then reverse. the sudden change throws brody to his knees.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{what the hell?}
<A>__{angle from hooper's boat: gardner's boat "flicka" awash and}
<B>__{floating dead in the sea}
<A>__{it's what they've just run into flooded to the gunwales, loose debris floating around, a tangle of lines and gear looking like floating garbage in the cockpit. hooper's light sweeps across it.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{that's ben gardner's boat! it's the flicka! ben? ben!}
<A>__{hooper cuts his engines and drifts in; he scampers out to the bow of his boat and makes a line fast to the flicka. inside the cockpit of hooper's boat the electronic display is showing increased activity, but only brody, who is clinging to a support for dear life, can see the blips and hear the chatter. hooper is leaning out to look at the flicka.}
<B>__{the two boats}
<A>__{hooper is examining the flicka, tying a towline to it.}
<B>__{insert his point of view}
<A>__{the light picks its way across the ruined boat. the rail where a cleat once was is broadly scarred down to the raw timber, and the heady cleat has been torn bodily out of the hull, ripped out screws and all. hooper's boat something he has seen moves hooper.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{i want to check something. hold my feet.}
<A>__{he sticks his head over the side, into the black water.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{don't they have lifejackets or something? an extra boat?}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(surfacing)}
<D>__{they must've hit something.}
<A>__{insert, electronics display blip, chatter, blip, chatter.}
<B>__{brody and hooper}
<A>__{hooper moves to get a better look, the boat rocks in the swell and from his movement, brody clutches the rail in a death grip. hooper goes below decks, getting into his wet suit, buckling on a weighted belt, holding a mask and hot flashlight.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{he didn't have a dinghy aboard. i'm going down to take a look at his hull.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{why don't we just tow it in?}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(hyperventilating)}
<D>__{we will. there's something i've got to find out.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{be careful, for chrissake.}
<A>__{hooper takes a last few breaths, orients himself, takes a long, hard look at the quiet, open ocean, and falls into the sea.}
<B>__{close on brody}
<A>__{he is studying the surface, trying to follow hooper's movements. brody is forcing himself to stay at the edge of the boat by sheer willpower and grim determination. brody is fascinated by the sea like a bird facing a cobra. he is very much alone. he grasps a flashlight or boathook as a fragile defense against the unknown. past brody's back to the electronics beep, chatter, blip. underwater sequence hooper hooper descends in a froth of bubbles. warily he turns a full circle with his hotlight. at first we see nothing out of place about the flicka except that it is lying so low in the water. but as hooper travels the bottom looking for damage, he comes across a jagged hole two thirds of the way forward. the hole is about the size of a basketball, and the wood around it has been bashed and splintered. hooper explores the hole with his hands, then takes the knife from its sheath and begins to dig at something. whatever it is comes free in his hand. as he studies his find, his light wanders upward, pointing directly into the dark hole. hooper looks up... close hole ben gardner's dead face stares out through the hole in the flicka, eyes and mouth gaping in frozen horror, his skin pinched like a prune. close hooper bumps his head in trying to get away, seems to yell through escaping bubbles. we hear the gasping shout as a bubbling roar in the ears. his mask fills with water as he flails for the surface. miscalculating, he bumps into the hull of his own boat, shocked, dismayed, his system jangling with adrenaline shock, his hands open, and the object he pried loose from the hull drifts down and out, falling into the eternity of the ocean bottom. he finally bursts through the surface.}
<B>__{end of underwater sequence}
<A>__{the boat, hooper emerging from the water he is gasping for breath, his whole body vibrating with urgency. the salt water in his lungs combines with the adrenaline in his blood to deprive him of speech.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{you all right?}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{a white! a great white, i found a tooth buried in the hull. he must've attacked... i knew it... gardner's dead in there. i didn't see the mate...}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{no shark did that to a boat!}
<A>__{hooper, despite his shock and surprise, is strangely elated, almost giddy with the wonder of his discovery.}
<C>__{hooper}
<D>__{jesus christ! a great white! who'd believe it! we're not talking about a shark, we're talking about a shark!}
<A>__{brody sinks weakly into a chair. brody huddles in the stern, hooper kicks the engine in with a roar, and still a shiver with excitement, turns the boat and its grim tow back to port.}
