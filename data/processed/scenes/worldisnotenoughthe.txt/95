<L>__{interior snow hole moments later}
<A>__{darkness. the rumbling ceases... light emanates from bond's watch. in the shadows he pulls a knife, punctures the air bag. it deflates, leaving them cocooned in an icy tomb. elektra looks around, staring, unbelieving.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{oh my god...we're buried alive...}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{we're alright.}
<A>__{but her breath is coming in short, irregular bursts.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{i can't stay here.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{you're not going to.}
<A>__{bond takes a knife from a sheath around his ankle. flicks open the small blade. he starts to cut a hole in the snow above their heads. she stops him.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{no! it will cave in!}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{it's the only way out...}
<A>__{the snow creaks eerily, she gasps, terror mounting.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{i can't breathe, i can't breathe...}
<A>__{bond grabs her, holds her tight. she resists, bucks.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{elektra, look at me, look in my eyes!}
<P>__{(she does)}
<D>__{you're alright. everything will be alright. trust me.}
<A>__{finally, arrested by the strength in his eyes, she calms...}
