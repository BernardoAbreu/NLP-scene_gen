<A>__{mcconnell and luke watch as woody starts up his corvette. mcconnell has regained his composure.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{hey, woodrow, isn't it about time you donated this thing to a museum?}

<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i will see what i can do. just make sure you bring some fresh beer.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{you got it.}
<A>__{with a final glance at mcconnell, woody slips the car into gear. mcconnell and luke watch as he drives away. a silence. luke glances at his old friend, growing more serious. we sense he's been waiting all night for a chance to say this.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{should've been your mission, jim. yours and maggie's.}
<A>__{mcconnell, looking after woody's car, becomes very still.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{none of us ever wanted mars the way you two did. not even woody. twelve years of hoping for this assignment, training for it }
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{that's all over now.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{if maggie hadn't gotten sick if you hadn't pulled yourself out of the rotation to take care of her }

<D>__{i wanted mars one. hell, i battled you for it every step of the way. never wanted to beat anybody so bad in my life. but not like this... jim, i'd give this all up in a second, if it would bring maggie back to us.}
<A>__{mcconnell is deeply moved, and for a moment doesn't trust his own voice.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{i know that, luke. you don't have to say it... mars is yours now. go get it.}
<C>__{luke}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{take care of yourself.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{yeah. you too.}
<A>__{luke nods. they grab hands for a second, then let go. luke walks back towards his house. mcconnell watches him for a moment, then turns, walks over to his jeep. he opens his door, then pauses. he turns. looks up at }
