<A>__{under the noise: rusty leans in and whispers in saul's ear. saul's eyes widen, then glaze over as all around him people are standing and shouting. rusty places an envelope in saul's lap, then gets up and walks out as, on the track, the #4 dog crosses the finish line... last by several lengths. saul considers his options. in one hand: a fan of losing tickets. in the other (courtesy of rusty): a ticket to las vegas.}
