<L>__{interior coffee shop later}
<A>__{we see the morning bustle as business men and women stand in line waiting for their morning coffee. adam and seth stand at the end of that line watching the young couple in front of them who can't keep their hands off of each other.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{i don't get it, that guy is clearly a total douchebag...he's wearing capris!}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{rachel and i used to be like that; like two wild animals in heat...}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{i guess it is only natural though, as we get older, more mature, things begin to slow down.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{sex every three weeks is normal? right?}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(in shock)}
<D>__{you haven't had sex in three weeks?}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{you think maybe she's mad cause i haven't asked her to move in?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{what the fuck are you talking about? i don't think she's waiting for you to ask anything. you're using her shampoo. next thing you'll be using her tampons.}
<A>__{seth laughs at his own joke.}
<C>__{seth }
<D>__{but seriously, let me get this straight she has her own place, yet she spends every night with you, in your bed, but she won't sleep with you?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{it's not that big a deal.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{so when does it become a big deal? five weeks? six weeks? a year? my cut off...4 days. that's when i begin to worry.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{do you realize how lucky i am to be with rachel?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{look around, there are like a million rachel's in this city alone...well, she's kind of hot, so maybe half a million.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{but they're not rachel. i don't know how to explain it, but being with her just feels right. and i'm not going to overlook that just cause we're in a lull.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{my parents are in a lull, which is what happens after 35 years of marriage. you've only been dating her four months. at our age sex is all we have. every time she refuses to sleep with you a small piece of every man's soul dies. she's killing us adam...you're a semi smart, semi successful, semi average looking dude. just based on that you could get with at least one third of the female population.}
<A>__{adam and seth step up to the counter. they're greeted by the super gay barista, who loves his job way too much.}
<C>__{barista}
<D>__{morning gentlemen.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(to barista)}
<D>__{would you sleep with my friend.}
<C>__{barista}
<D>__{like, right now?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{no just in general.}
<C>__{barista}
<D>__{yeah, i'd fuck him.}
<A>__{the barista yells to demetri, the other barista.}
<C>__{barista }
<D>__{hey demetri,}
<P>__{(re: adam)}
<D>__{fuckable?}
<A>__{demetri examines adam. he's not impressed with what he sees.}
<C>__{demetri}
<D>__{i'd let you blow me.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(to adam)}
<D>__{see this is what i'm saying.}
<A>__{the barista hands seth and adam two cups of coffee, they each leave a dollar.}
