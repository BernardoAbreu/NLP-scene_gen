<L>__{interior hospital hallway day}
<A>__{bursting through the doors }
<C>__{young dr. bennett}
<D>__{grab that baby!}
<A>__{a nurse finally scoops up the slippery baby. everyone lets out a collective sigh of relief.}
<C>__{will }
<D>__{my father's birth would set the pace for his unlikely life. no longer than most men's, but larger. and as strange as his stories got, the endings were always the most surprising of all.}
<L>__{interior half dark paris apartment (present) day}
<A>__{over the sound of rain, a phone rings on a chair. by the tone of the ring, we know we're not in the u.s. it has that insistent european sound. as it keeps ringing, we look to see the apartment is mostly empty, just a few half unpacked boxes. a cradle is still in its carton. keys in the lock. laughter in the hallway. the door swings open to reveal a drenched will (29) carrying four sacks of groceries, the bottoms collapsing from the rain. his wife josephine (28) pushes past him to get the phone.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{allo oui?}
<A>__{will begins stripping out of his wet clothes, each layer unleashing a new drizzle. he plays it up, trying to get a reaction out of josephine.}
<C>__{josephine}
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{yes, he's here.}
<A>__{she hands the phone to will, concerned.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{it's your mother.}
<A>__{half stripped, will takes the phone. this won't be good news.}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{hi. uh huh. uh huh.}
<A>__{as josephine takes off her rain coat, we see she is very, very pregnant. she listens carefully to will's side of the conversation, trying to gauge how bad the news is.}
<C>__{will }
<D>__{what does dr. bennett say? okay. no, sure, let me talk to him. i will wait.}
<A>__{he covers the mouthpiece. looks over to josephine.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{it's bad.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{it's more than they thought. they're going to stop chemo.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{you need to go.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{probably tonight.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{josephine}
<D>__{i'm going with you.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you don't have to.}
<C>__{josephine}
<P>__{(a simple fact)}
