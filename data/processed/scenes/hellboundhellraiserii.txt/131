<A>__{there is a slightly awkward pause.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{well ... g'bye.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{it's been hell.}
<A>__{they share a rueful knowing smile, like the smile of soldiers back from a war who say goodbye on a dockside and know they will never meet again. tiffany turns and walks down the long path to the hospital gates. kirsty watches her for a few moments and then turns and re enters the institute. the camera tracks back to the window of the recovery room and we watch through the window as kirsty enters the room. she bends to kiss her father's cheek. larry slips an arm around her shoulders and they embrace. the camera moves away again.}
