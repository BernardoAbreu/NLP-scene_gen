<D>__{hey boy. you are a handsome fellow.}
<P>__{(over shoulder to the girl)}
<D>__{beautiful dog.}
<C>__{the girl}
<D>__{thank you.}

<C>__{chris}
<D>__{go on, boy. go on.}
<A>__{and the dog obeys him. as he sorts through the various rice selections, brown, white, wild, we notice a man peering over the opposite shelf at chris. this is ron franz, between 70 and 80 years old, six feet, thick arms, barrel chest, and large ears. he wears old jeans, an immaculate white t shirt, a decorative tooled leather belt, white socks, and scuffed black loafers. his deeply pitted nose demonstrates a purple filigree of veins which unfold like an finely wrought tattoo. and on either side of it, the wary blue eyes of a soldier. he is the archetypical american man. chris has caught his sympathetic eye. chris moves to the counter to pay for rice.}
