<A>__{as tamara finishes off her line, wiping her nose with a sniffle.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{oh yeah. ready to party and then some.}
<A>__{she rolls up her baggie, stuffing it into her purse.}
<B>__{stalking point of view}
<A>__{as we come down a corridor, turning into the service area, stomping right up to tamara and eva. they both gasp; tamara drops her mirror, which shatters on the ground.}
<B>__{reverse angle}
<A>__{they are facing mcculloch.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{what are you doing in here?}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{he eyes the broken mirror. he wasn't born yesterday.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{are you girls using drugs?}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{do you think i would use drugs, mr. mcculloch? we were just exploring the ship.}
<A>__{he doesn't want to believe eva is a druggie. but tamara is a different matter. he levels his eyes on her.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{i'11 be coming around your stateroom in exactly fifteen minutes, miss mason. you'd better have your biology project ready or i'm phoning your parents.}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{they're out of town.}
<C>__{mcculloch}
<D>__{then i will make sure you remain on board while your classmates see the sights.}
<A>__{he's gotten to her with that one. mcculloch storms away.}
<C>__{eva}
<D>__{what are you going to do?}
<C>__{tamara}
<D>__{relax, i've got mcculloch covered... but that little narcing bitch niece of his is a different matter.}
<P>__{(calculating)}
<D>__{rumor has it she's a teensy bit afraid of the water...}
<A>__{splash! as a body pierces the surface of the deck swimming pool. it's miles, having just completed a dive from the high board. miss van deusen and several others stand at poolside, giving him some applause.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{poetry in motion, miles.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{a half twist short. i will hone that dive yet.}
<A>__{he swims to the side, leading us to a view of rennie. she's very cautious about getting too close to the pool edge as she approaches miss van deusen.}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{rennie i was just on my way over to your room}
<C>__{rennie}
<D>__{have you seen my dog anywhere?}
<C>__{miss van deusen}
<D>__{no, but i'm sure toby's fine. the ship's only so big and there's certainly no way off it, is there?}
<A>__{she smiles reassuringly, but her words are less than comforting.}
