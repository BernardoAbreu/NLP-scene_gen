<A>__{the men in place, singing, the water sparkling towards the horizon, the stars twinkling above. the sound of a distant whale in distant counterpointerior}
<L>__{exterior the orca dawn}
<A>__{brody is at the wheel on the flying bridge, while hooper and quint have a hatch up on the stern, and are working together to repair the damaged rudder controls torn loose by the shark. hooper is bucking the steel rod, while quint is hammering away at the joint, trying to drive a new pin. the engine is idling. bits of iron clutter the deck, along with a few rough, outsized tools and greasy rags and gaskets.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{more left rudder! more! left hand down now, chief.}
<A>__{brody tries to comply.}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(shifting his grip)}
<D>__{lemme get a better angle on it. now.}
<A>__{quint hammers again.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{he's bent the housing. you can hear it.}
<A>__{and we can. the orca's diesels are no longer smooth. brody suddenly sees something, and points. brody's point of view the water the barrel is surfaced directly ahead of them, just off the port side. they are drifting up to it.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{the barrel!}
<A>__{the strobe light winks at them. quint holds up a hand: "quiet!" everything stops as they watch the barrel coming slowly up on them.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{it's him.}
<A>__{he takes a killing lance from the rack. hooper gets a boathook.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{he's under the keg. careful }
<A>__{hooper leans out gingerly, snagging the barrel with the hook. it bobs lightly in the water, an innocent bystander. hooper shifts his pole, takes hold of the rope, poling it in.}
<C>__{quint}
<P>__{(suspicious)}
<D>__{easy just want to goose him up. the minute he runs, drop it or you'll lose your hands.}
<A>__{hooper gets the line and starts hauling it up. no resistance. it comes easily over the transom into a coil on the deck. he and quint exchange looks.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{here gimme. i don't see what he's been doin'.}
<A>__{water angle both men are draped over the side, their chins almost touching the water on the aft side. from the opposite starboard direction, fully unfastened from the barrel, comes the great white. first the fin, then the conical nose and the upper border of wide, grinning teeth. it knifes through the water in absolute silence, propelling itself with tremendous speed toward the unsuspecting men. close brody his instincts shine as does his newly acquired sense of direction.}
<C>__{brody}
<P>__{(top of his lungs)}
<D>__{shark! starboard!}
<A>__{close hooper and quint they turn just in time, and a long spine stretch saves them from instant decapitation. the great white passes the transom, the harpoon still in its side and trailing five feet of chewed off cable. it rolls on its side and looks at them as it passes. past the stern the huge tail lashes out, ripping the rope out of quint's hands, shearing a huge swath through the paint, peeling it off like a plane, taking one of the bronze letters out of "orca." the shark begins an arc to sea, its fin cutting the water, and starts circling the boat. quint notices his cut hand, palm bleeding, realizing how close he came to losing it.}
<C>__{quint}
<P>__{(to hooper)}
<D>__{haul in that rope it'll foul us!}
<P>__{(then to brody on the bridge)}
<D>__{start the engine!}
<A>__{the diesels start with a terrible grinding.}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{easy! it'll tear right out!}
<C>__{hooper}
<P>__{(hauling)}
<D>__{the shaft is giving.}
<A>__{hooper slams the hatch, kicks the tools to one side, clearing the deck for action once again.}
<C>__{brody}
<P>__{(on bridge)}
<D>__{that's it! radio in for help!}
<C>__{quint}
<D>__{shut up! just pump her out!}
<C>__{brody}
<P>__{(coming down off the bridge)}
<D>__{yeah, captain, as soon as i make a call.}
<A>__{brody heads for the radio in the pilot house. quint close a perfectly terrible look comes over him. he raises up and starts after brody. brody disappears into the cabin. quint pauses outside and sees: insert quint's lead centered baseball bat his calloused hand grabs it up fiercely.}
