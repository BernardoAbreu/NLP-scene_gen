<L>__{interior george's office, new york day}
<A>__{alone by the window, he gazes at the city. a powerfully built man in a perfectly tailored suit. the face at once strong and elegant, capable of every emotion. yet just now, there are none to be seen. even as... ...a door opens. a pretty secretary enters soundlessly, sits respectfully. waits, her pen suspended above her steno pad. does he know she's there? superimpose: new york, later 1937.}

<P>__{(without turning)}
<D>__{the first time i met her she sat in that chair.}
<A>__{the secretary doesn't know whether to write that down. and still with his back to her...}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{you may as well write it down, mary. write it all down. even the parts that are confused or graceless or boring.}
<A>__{he turns with a soft smile to put her at ease.}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{we'll see if i remember how to edit.}

<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{i'd kept her waiting two hours. she hated me on sight, but she thought i couldn't tell.}
<A>__{his gaze drifts to a bookcase crammed with volumes. and one object, oddly out of place. a stuffed cat, with boots and a green frock coat. it wears a confident ironic smile.}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{she was a person who cherished her privacy and was devoting her life to social work. and there i was...}
<A>__{his smile is kind. and honestly self mocking.}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{self obsessed. wallowing in the glory of my authors and celebrity acquaintances. a vain, fast talking, manipulator. but then i guess you know all that, don't you?}
<A>__{she looks up reproachfully. nothing of the kind, and you know it.}
<P>__{george (cont’d)}
<D>__{oh, yes. and the kind of man who fishes for compliments.}
<A>__{he's made her laugh.}
