<A>__{delacroix is a guest on the gary byrd show. wlib is the number one black talk radio station in the nation.}
<C>__{gary byrd}
<D>__{our guest today is pierre delacroix. he is the creator of the highly controversial tv show mantan. let's get right into it. you have been called by some in the community a traitor, a sellout, an uncle tom. why does your show generate such feelings?}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{because race has always been a sensitive issue in this country. gary, i have no problem with people disagreeing with the show, it's when folks start trying to mess with my inherent right as an artist, that's when i get mad. no one, in any way, shape or form should be censored.}
<C>__{gary byrd}
<D>__{no matter how sexist or racist the material may be?}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{yes. and i say yes because who is to judge? who is to stand before us and say this is righteous and this is not? who? who can play god?}
<C>__{gary byrd}
<D>__{but the line has to be drawn.}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{don't you people get it? we're in the 21st century. slavery was over four hundred years ago. all that stuff people talked in the old days, it's over. folks always crying, white man this, white man that. let's all grow up.}
<C>__{gary byrd}
<D>__{are you trying to excuse our holocaust?}
<C>__{delacroix}
<D>__{can i finish? thank you. i had a great aunt, we called her sister. she went to her grave not believing man had walked on the moon.}
<C>__{delacroix }
<D>__{when i was a little kid, i would argue with her, "it's on tv." she would answer "i don't care what's on that idiot box. no man is on the moon." well, there are a lot of your negroes just like my aunt sister. face up to it. the world has changed and if you don't adapt, change with it, you will be left behind. this show is a parody. are you telling me that nobody can use some humor, have some laughs in their lives? is that what you're telling me?}
