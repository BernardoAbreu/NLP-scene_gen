<L>__{exterior mandy brown's house night}
<A>__{the mercedes and a truck are parked out front.}
<C>__{pete }
<D>__{there's something about this whole thing i don't quite understand, mr. masry.}
<L>__{interior donna irving's house, living room night}
<A>__{donna and pete irving, and mandy and roy brown are all seated, sipping iced tea. while they talk, erin hands them all information packets on chromium. ed is standing in front of them, a little stiff.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{if pg&e messed with our water, why would they bother saying anything about it to us? why not just keep quiet about it?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{to establish a statute of limitations. see, in a case like this, you only have a year from the time you first learn about the problem to file suit. so pg&e figures, we'll let the cat out of the bag tell the people the water's not perfect; if we can ride out the year with no one suing, we'll be in the clear forever.}
<C>__{donna}
<D>__{but it was more than a year ago that they told us }
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{it's okay. we're not suing. all we're doing is using this information to get you a real nice purchase price on your house, and get you two }
<P>__{(to the browns)}
<D>__{ a comparable retroactive bonus added to your sale price. this way, and pg&e can still look good to their shareholders, cause they're not involved in an ugly lawsuit; all they're doing is buying a little property.}
<A>__{roy looks up from his retainer agreement.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{it doesn't say here how much this whole thing's gonna cost us.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{my fee's forty percent of whatever you get awarded.}
<A>__{erin watches them look around at each other, stunned by the figure.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{boy, do i know how you feel. first time i heard that number, i said you got to be kidding me. forty god damn percent?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{erin }
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{i'm the one who's injured, and this joker who sits at a desk all day is gonna walk away with almost half my reward?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{erin }
<A>__{erin's enjoying ed's discomfort almost too much to stop. but just almost. she shifts gears.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{then i asked him how much he makes if i didn't get anything.}
<A>__{they look at ed. well?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{then i don't get anything either.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{and i realized, he's taking a chance too.}
<A>__{when they hear this, and realize he's in it with them, they all reach for their pens and sign. they hand the agreements over to erin, who takes them across the room to ed. he stuffs them in his briefcase and closes it up. that's that.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{all right, then. let's hit the road.}
<A>__{boy. cold as ice. erin stares at him, stunned by his brusque manner, then leans in to him, close.}
<C>__{erin}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{mr. masry, if you don't mind my saying, you got a lot to learn about being friendly. these people just hired you as their lawyer. the least you could do is make a little pleasant conversation.}
<A>__{she gives him a stern look, then turns toward the women.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{donna, let me help you clean all this up.}
<A>__{she picks up a tray of iced tea and cookies and heads to the kitchen. donna and mandy follow, leaving ed alone with pete and roy. he stands there, awkwardly. then, finally:}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{so, what's, uh ... what's new?}
