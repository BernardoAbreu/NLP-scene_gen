<B>__{an audience}
<A>__{watching, laughing. a great sea of grinning teeth and teary eyes. except one. kafka sits grimly alone near the back. but suddenly he's not alone the bearded anarchist has sat down in front of him and now turns round, startlingly.}
<C>__{bearded anarchist}
<D>__{we have another theory.}
<A>__{and the pockmarked anarchist is suddenly sitting beside him.}
<C>__{pockmarked anarchist}
<D>__{we may have attached too little importance to the reason eduard was summoned to the castle to begin with.}
<A>__{and the youthful anarchist is behind him, thrusting his head suddenly forward.}
<C>__{youthful anarchist}
<D>__{ to correct a small discrepancy, you may recall.}
<A>__{the solemn anarchist is on kafka's other side but he just watches the movie.}
<C>__{pockmarked anarchist}
<D>__{ ah, but what if it wasn't ?}
<C>__{bearded anarchist}
<D>__{ small.}
<C>__{youthful anarchist}
<D>__{ what if it was a large discrepancy?}
<A>__{kafka's head keeps turning around as they speak.}
<C>__{pockmarked anarchist}
<D>__{yours is a very powerful and important firm it has a lot at stake.}
<C>__{bearded anarchist}
<D>__{perhaps eduard was closer than he knew to discovering it and so had to be silenced.}
<C>__{youthful anarchist}
<D>__{ or he was even more an innocent victim than that he was chosen to bear the blame if the crime was uncovered by anyone else.}
<C>__{pockmarked anarchist}
<D>__{ the crime so scandalous that the poor young clerk committed suicide rather than own up to it.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{that's mad .}
<C>__{pockmarked anarchist}
<D>__{ oh, yes, it's mad.}
<A>__{the solemn anarchist suddenly laughs probably at charlie chaplin.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{ you said so yourself the firm is large and powerful. if the discrepancy really was something big, eduard's responsibility would still have to be small. no poor young clerk could find himself in such a fix.}

<P>__{(sarcastic grunt)}
<D>__{when a scapegoat is needed, my friend ...}
<C>__{bearded anarchist}
<D>__{we have to know what he was working on at the time of his death.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{he worked on routine claims. his visit to the castle was probably as minor a mission as he said it was.}
<C>__{pockmarked anarchist}
<D>__{why are you so aggressively unimaginative? eduard is no longer the only casualty.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{then why haven't i been }
<C>__{youthful anarchist}
<D>__{ kidnapped or murdered? because your connection with eduard was obvious and above board not as easily misconstrued.}
<C>__{bearded anarchist}
<D>__{ not secretive, therefore not suspicious.}

<C>__{bearded anarchist}

<A>__{storage section day kafka follows the keeper of the files along labyrinthine alleys between shelves packed with files. walls are obscured by columns of documents tied together, piled on top of each other. there's hardly room to move. stacks of files are everywhere, balancing precariously, even falling from time to time, from sheer pressure in all directions.}

<D>__{yes. isn't it there?}

<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{he's the clerk who died last week. from the insurance department}

<P>__{(follows anxiously)}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{keeper}
<D>__{why would we keep files on dead employees? all old files are sent up to the castle. do you think we have room for two hundred years worth personnel records?}

<P>__{(dodges another paper landslide)}
<D>__{it's gone out so quickly?}
<C>__{keeper}
<D>__{whenever an employee departs, shall we say, it's up to the head of his department to requisition his file, reassign any outstanding claims, and send it off.}

<D>__{ you mean my chief has it.}
<A>__{documents come crashing down and we can't see kafka and the keeper anymore.}
