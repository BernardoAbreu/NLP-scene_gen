<L>__{exterior mine pit day}
<A>__{a wide shot of the terraced crater of the unobtanium mine. a quiet beat, then k whoooom! the entire face of one terrace is blown skyward in a chain of explosions. the "shot" blasts hundreds of tons of rock loose. long lens angles of enormous wheel loaders shovelling up ore rich rock and dropping it into dump trucks.}
<L>__{exterior rainforest day}
<A>__{a wall of steel fills frame. the dozer blade crushes everything in its path, reducing trees to kindling. wider, showing the clear cutting operation near the mine, as a road is cut through the jungle. remotely operated dozers three stories tall rip into the tree line. one of the dozers has rotating slash cutter, a vicious spinning head, mounted on a hydraulic arm, that hogs through the enormous tree trunks in a spray of wood shrapnel. the heavy machines are escorted by ampsuits. colonel quaritch, on foot, leads a squad of troopers wearing breathing masks and carrying almighty big automatic weapons. a banshee a fearsome aerial predator hurtles from above, diving toward them on wings 3 meters across. we get a glimpse of glassy fangs before p p poom! quaritch cranks off three rapid shots with his massive sidearm, and the creature drops with a shriek. it crashes near them and quaritch fires two more well placed rounds. the newbies stare at the thing's barracuda teeth.}
<C>__{quaritch}
<D>__{for you pogues, this is a banshee. a small one. see, they like it when i bring fresh meat out here. and this clearcutting really stirs up the hornet's nest. so keep your head on a swivel. if it moves, shoot it. if you're not sure it's moving shoot it! if it looks like a bunch of flowers you want to take home to sally rottencrotch shoot it! what're you gonna do?}
<C>__{troopers}
<D>__{shoot it, sir!}
<C>__{quaritch}
<D>__{outstanding. let's roll.}
<A>__{quaritch leads his squad into the gloom of the forest, his eyes scanning. flanking the squad, lyle wainfleet drives an ampsuit, his massive feet crashing through the underbrush. as his gaze comes down, he sees something ahead of him on the trail an intricate totem of woven sticks, bones and feathers hanging across the trail like an orb weaver's web. he tears it down with the barrel of his rifle, and stomps it into the mud as he moves on.}
