<L>__{exterior metro bus night}
<A>__{with a hydraulic hiss the bus releases its brakes and diesels off down the empty street. emily stands alone. rain soaked. shivering. staring at her house down the block. the silhouette of a child in the window.}
<L>__{interior child services department night}
<A>__{wayne and his boyfriend shake rain off an umbrella as they cross the darkened office.}
<C>__{boyfriend}
<P>__{(re: the office space)}
<D>__{no, i like it. it's like those things they put baby cows in to make veal }
<A>__{the boyfriend slows as they go past a cubicle. saw something weird.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{he points. freaked. wayne comes over, pokes his head in a cubicle.}
<C>__{emily}
<A>__{head down on her desk, rain soaked, sleeping in her chair.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{em...?}
<A>__{no reply. wayne's face darkens. is she dead? he comes over, puts his hand on her shoulder.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{emily...?}
<A>__{she awakens with a jolt. expecting to see margaret. she looks terrible.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{jesus are you okay?}
<C>__{emily}
<P>__{(hoarse whisper)}
<D>__{i... i had some things to catch up on...}
<A>__{she fumbles unconvincingly at some loose paperwork.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{you look like shit, you need to see a doctor.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{i saw a doctor.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{what did they say?}
<C>__{emily}
<P>__{(loses it)}
<D>__{they said mind your own fucking business!}
<A>__{shocked by the outburst, by her general appearance, he walks away, muttering to his boyfriend. emily puts her head in her hands, pressing down at her temples. wayne steps into his office in the b.g. and grabs something then they exit. and the office is quiet again. emily closes her eyes. just then, she hears a faint cyclical squeaking noise in the cubicle right next to hers. goes rigid. recognizes the sound. calls over the partition without moving.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{wayne...?}
<A>__{no reply, but the squeaking continues. rising slowly from her seat, scared as hell, she leans over her desk and peers over the partition into the adjacent cubicle. it's empty. but the office chair is turning as if someone were just playing there. emily steps slowly back. and now hears the same cyclical squeaking behind her. the opposite row. she spins.}
