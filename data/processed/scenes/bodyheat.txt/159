<L>__{exterior parking lot behind shiller, hastings (west palm}
<A>__{beach) day matty, racine, roz, lowenstein and hardin stand talking in a little cluster near the building. they say their good byes with much handshaking. matty lays a reassuring hand on roz's arm and kisses her on the cheek. as she breaks from the crowd, racine walks with her. the others stand talking a little longer. racine takes off his jacket in the blazing heat. he is very aware of the little group behind them as he walks with matty to her mercedes. when they are out of earshot }

<D>__{you've really done it, matty. you really have.}

<C>__{racine}
<D>__{i hope you haven't done us in.}
<A>__{matty gets into her car. at the far end of the parking lots lowenstein has been watching them as he makes his way to his car. now, as he moves between two rows of cars, he executes a few nifty dance steps, just like fred astaire.}
