<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior city street night}
<A>__{blade's olds cruises to a stop. we're in a low end commercial district junky heaven. blade climbs out, pulling an automatic rifle from the back seat, then heading into an alleyway.}
<L>__{exterior back alley night}
<A>__{blade makes his way down the alley, cautious he sees mountains of trash, boarded up windows, overlapping layers of gang graffiti a rat crouching on a trash dumpster, gnawing on a dead pigeon then a sound behind blade, the scuffle of feet blade whirls, drawing his sword, charging at an approaching shadow, stopping mere millimeters from decapitating karen, who's been backed up against the wall, her eyes wide with fright. blade's sword vibrates from the tension in his forearm, having drawn just the slightest taste of blood.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing?! i could have killed you!}
<A>__{blade lowers his sword. karen remembers to breathe. she slumps, tracing her fingers over the line where her head almost parted with her body.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i remembered the address. i followed you }
<A>__{blade shakes his head, amazed.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{do you have a death wish or are you just stupid?}
<A>__{karen pushes away from the wall, angry }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{look, if what you say is true, if there's a chance i could turn into one of them, then i've got no choice, do i? i have to work with you. i need to learn everything i can about them. it's the only way i will be able to find a cure for myself.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{there is no cure.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(defiant)}
<D>__{you don't know that.}
<A>__{blade turns and moves to the end of the alley, studying the graffiti covered wall intently }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what are you looking at?}
<C>__{blade}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{what do you see here?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{graffiti }
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{look closer.}
<A>__{blade indicates a design amongst the various gang banger tags that looks something like a post modern hieroglyphic.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{this isn't a gang tag, it's a vampire marking. it means there's a safe house nearby. a place they can go if dawn is coming.}
<A>__{blade points to a building across the street the holliston clinic, your basic inner city blood barter establishment where desperate transients parley their plasma into cash.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(recognizing it)}
<D>__{i know this place it's a blood bank.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{owned by vampires. there's one of these in every major city, and just like domino's, they always deliver.}
<P>__{(looking to karen)}
<D>__{you telling me you're ready to walk through that door?}
<A>__{karen nods. blade continues to stare at her, taking her measure there's a strength in this woman's eyes, she has the soul of a fighter and blade recognizes it.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{all right, then, listen up, vampire anatomy 101. crosses and running water don't do dick, so forget what you've seen in the movies.}
<A>__{blade enumerates the following on his fingers:}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{you use the stake, silver, or sunlight, got it?}
<A>__{blade holds up one of his casulls.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{know how to use one of these?}
<A>__{karen takes the weapon from him, eyes all over it.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{blade takes the gun back, snorting derisively.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{safety's off, round's already chambered }
<P>__{(cocking it)}
<D>__{silver hollow points filled with garlic. you aim for the heart or the head, anything else is a one way ticket to a pine box.}
<A>__{blade hand it to her again, then starts across the street towards the clinic. karen follows }
