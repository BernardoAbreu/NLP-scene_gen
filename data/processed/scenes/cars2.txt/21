<D>__{it is my absolute honor to introduce to you the competitors in the first ever world grand prix. from brazil. number eight...}
<A>__{on finn mcmissile. he appears from the shadows, keeps a careful distance from the stage. he zeroes his gaze on the world grand prix tv cameras which roll, catching miles axlerod's speech for publicity and posterity. finn's onboard computer analyzes each one, compares to the photos we saw him snap on the oil platform. each one is "not a match." his view is suddenly disrupted by a beautiful sports car. she approaches finn. meet holley shiftwell.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{a volkswagen karmann ghia has no radiator.}
<C>__{finn}

<C>__{finn}
<D>__{so the lab boys analyzed the photo i sent? what did they learn about the camera?}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{it appears to be a standard television camera. they said if you could get closer photos next time, that would be great.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{this was london's message?}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{oh no, no. no sir. um, the oil platforms you were on? turns out they're sitting on the biggest oil reserve in the world.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{how did we miss that?}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{they'd been scrambling everyone's satellites. the americans actually discovered it just before you did. they placed an agent on that platform, under deep cover. he was able to get a photo of the car who's running the entire operation.}
<A>__{the doors open and they exit onto the mezzanine.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{who is it? has anyone seen the photo yet?}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{no, not yet. the american is here tonight to pass it to you. he'll signal you when he's ready.}

<A>__{finn suddenly stops cold.}
<C>__{finn}

<A>__{professor zundapp is visible below them. he talks with a few pacers and gremlins. finn quickly retreats into the shadows. holley follows suit.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{change of plan. you're meeting the american.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{what, me?}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{those thugs down there were on the oil platform. if they see me, the whole mission is compromised.}
<C>__{holley}
<D>__{no, no. i'm technical, you see. i'm in diagnostics. i'm not a field agent.}
<C>__{finn}
<D>__{you are now.}
