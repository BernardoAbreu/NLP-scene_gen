<L>__{exterior indian village day}
<A>__{lieutenant dunbar's arrival this day is different from the ones which have gone before. young mounted warriors have ridden out to swarm around him, but they're full of good cheer reserved for a special friend. there's much backslapping and a few of them lean in to shake hands as they have seen him do. but some of the men have chosen to remain in front of their lodges. their expressionless faces anything but friendly. none of this is lost on wind in his hair. he has the look of a secret service man watching a president, as the parade moves through the village.}
