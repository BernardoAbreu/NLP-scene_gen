<L>__{interior washington post staff room night}
<A>__{courtney heads a meeting of his four staffers. one man, kinney, a research assistant, sits behind a stack of paperwork, has a downcast expression as he listens to courtney.}
<C>__{courtney}
<D>__{... gardiner is laconic, matter of fact. the scuttlebutt is that he's a strong candidate for one of the vacant seats on the board of first american. but before we can do any sort of a piece on the man, we're going to need facts on his background...}
<P>__{(turns to kinney)}
<D>__{... kinney, what did you come up with?}
<C>__{kinney}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{... nothing.}
<C>__{courtney}
<P>__{(sighs, taps pencil on table)}
<D>__{... skip the levity, kinney what have you got?}
<C>__{kinney}
<P>__{(another pause)}
<D>__{... i realize this sounds banal but there is no information of any sort on gardiner. we have no material on him zilch...}
<A>__{the room is quiet except for the tapping of courtney's pencil.}
