<A>__{joan, staring grimly out the windshield as she snails along in the right hand lane. harry begins shifting fitfully around, grumbling:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{this is just nuts, what you're doing.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{will you stop trying to undermine me every inch of the way.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(gesturing out the window)}
<D>__{look at this goddamned traffic.}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{anyway, i didn't ask you to drag along with me.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you're the one that's dragging along.}
<P>__{(gesturing at a semi in front of them)}

<D>__{don't talk to me, harry. i mean it, just don't say another word to me!}
<A>__{he angrily folds his arms across his chest, assuming a sullen silence for a moment. the traffic has come to a grid lock stop, raising their anxiety levels:}
<C>__{joan }
<D>__{i was doing just fine until you started in on me...}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(gesturing at the ax)}
<D>__{driving around with a goddamned ax stuck in your car...}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{and now look at me. i've got purpose tremors...}
<A>__{he suddenly opens the door, gets out and moves to the ax handle. joan watches as he makes several unsuccessful attempts to pull the ax out of the hood of the car.}
