<A>__{killick and black bill.}
<C>__{killick}
<D>__{he's been at it again.}
<C>__{black bill}
<D>__{who's that then?}
<C>__{killick}
<D>__{the jonah.}
<C>__{black bill}
<D>__{what jonah?}
<L>__{160. the great cabin night}
<A>__{jack sits at his desk. the model of the acheron that warley helped make sits accusingly in front of him. stephen pours him a glass on wine, and one for himself.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{the deaths in actual battle are the easiest.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{for my own part those who die under the knife or from some consequent infection: i have to remind myself that it is the enemy who killed them, and not me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{warley was a casualty of war, as surely as if a french ball had taken him.}
<A>__{jack nods. obviously the death still weighs on his conscience.}
<C>__{stephen }
<P>__{(offering the wine)}
<D>__{at the same time....}
<A>__{he breaks off}
<D>__{jack at the same time, what?}
<A>__{stephen hesitates, aware that he has to proceed carefully}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{you know that i wear two hats on every voyage. i am the captains particular friend and supporter, but also i am the ships doctor in which later capacity i am party to....}
<A>__{he catches a steely glint in jacks eye and breaks off.}
<C>__{stephen }
<D>__{you don't want me to continue.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(stiffly)}
<D>__{on the contrary. i insist on it.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{there is talk below decks of turning back. or rather that we should have turned back some weeks ago. of course the men would follow "lucky jack" anywhere, and usually in the confident expectation of victory. but that of course is the problem.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what is the problem?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{that you are not accustomed to defeat jack. that you have taken it too personally. that chasing this larger, faster ship, with its long guns, is beginning to smack of pride 'which goeth before destruction'?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's not pride nor anything like it, it's a question of duty.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{'duty', ah yes. the naval signal for end of discussion.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you can be as 'satiric' as you like, stephen, but i have my orders. she is attacking our whalers. for why? without whales we have no boot polish, nor any soap, nor oil for our lamps, not to oil our sabres and muskets. destroying our whalers could win the war for napoleon. which is why we must catch this acheron. as a man of learning surely you can see that.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{at whatever the cost?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{any whatever cost i choose to pay. and i will calculate that myself, stephen without reference to your friends in the ward room.}
