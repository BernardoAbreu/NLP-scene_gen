<L>__{exterior east 77th street day (later)}
<A>__{dana walks down the street with venkman, retracing the path of the runaway buggy. spengler and stantz follow, monitoring pke valences from the pavement and the buildings.}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(to dana, nostalgic)}
<D>__{brings back a lot of sweet memories, doesn't it?}
<P>__{(pointing out familiar neighborhood sights)}
<D>__{there's our old cash machine. and the dry cleaners we used to go to. and the old video store.}
<P>__{(he wipes away an imaginary tear)}
<D>__{we really had some good times, didn't we?}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{we definitely had a moment or two.}
<A>__{dana stops at the intersection and points to the middle of the street.}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{that's where the buggy stopped.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{okay, let's take a look.}
<A>__{venkman walks right out into the middle of the street, completely oblivious to the cars honking and whizzing past him and starts motioning like a traffic cop, bringing traffic to a standstill. then he signals for dana, stantz and spengler to join him in the middle of the street.}
<C>__{stantz}
<P>__{(reading the pke meter)}
<D>__{is this the spot?}
<C>__{dana}
<D>__{a little to the left. right there! that's where it stopped.}
<A>__{stantz reads the pke meter.}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{nothing. not a trace.}
<C>__{spengler}
<D>__{why don't we try the giga meter?}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{egon and i have been working on a gauge to measure psychomagnetheric energy in gevs giga electron volts.}
<C>__{spengler}
<D>__{that's a thousand million electron volts.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{i knew that.}
<A>__{spengler switches on the giga meter, the device he was testing in the lab, and passes it over the spot on the street where the buggy stopped. the indicator goes right into the red zone and the device starts clicking}
<B>__{wildly.}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{i think we hit the honeypot, boys. there's something brewing under the street.}
<C>__{dana}
<P>__{(worried, to venkman)}
<D>__{peter, do you think maybe i have some genetic problem or something that makes me vulnerable to these supernatural things.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{you mean like the time you got possessed and turned into a monster terror dog? no, not a chance. total coincidence.}
<P>__{(to stantz and spengler)}
<D>__{am i right?}
<A>__{stantz and spengler look at him skeptically, not convinced by the coincidence theory.}
