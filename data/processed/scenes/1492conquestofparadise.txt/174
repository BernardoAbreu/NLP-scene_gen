<A>__{all is dark. we can just make out columbus' face as he lies on the hard bed. he is sweating heavily; his beard is filthy and matted, like his hair. he looks feverish. a key turns in the lock. the jailer lets in two fashionably dressed young men. columbus, blinking in the light, turns his head to stare at them. his eyes are reddened with infection at the corners. the young men come forward into the light.}
