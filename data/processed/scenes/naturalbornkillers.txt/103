<D>__{we talked with dewight mcclusky, chairman of the california state prison board, about this curious turn of events in the mickey and mallory case.}
<L>__{interior mcclusky's office day}
<A>__{wayne's interviewing mcclusky.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{why are mickey and mallory being moved to an asylum? and who made the decision?}
<C>__{mcclusky}
<D>__{the prison board made the decision. a board of which i belong. we're the who. the why is simple. mickey and mallory are mentally ill and need to be under a doctor's care, where hopefully they'll receive the help they need.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{mickey and mallory were deemed competent in a mental examination before their trial. i'm confused. what's changed?}
<C>__{mcclusky}
<D>__{well, since that time, they've killed one person during their trail. and since their incarceration, they've killed one psychologist along with several guards and inmates.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{when they were found competent before, they had already killed fifty people. other than the fact they're a disciplinary problem, which frankly shouldn't surprise anyone, i still don't see where this situation is any different then it was before. so, i ask you again, mr. mcclusky, what's changed?}
<C>__{mcclusky}
<D>__{what's changed, mr. gayle, is our minds. we felt they were competent a year ago. a year has passed, sir, a year where they were under close observation, day in and day out, and their behaviour has led us to believe we were wrong.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{who is we?}
<C>__{mcclusky}
<D>__{the prison board and the doctors who examined them.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{were any of the doctors who made the first evaluation on the knoxs mental state asked to re examine them?}
<C>__{mcclusky}
<D>__{using the same doctors is not common practice.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{i take it by your answer it was a whole new team?}
<C>__{mcclusky}
<D>__{now that you bring it up, yes. they were different men. i hadn't really thought that much about it. since many psychiatric opinions are, by a rule, sought out for this kind of situation. what do you think normally happens? the knoxs are assigned a family psychologist that takes care of them throughout the rest of their lives? the state doesn't work like that.}
