<A>__{wesker has come down off his rampage. he looks exhausted. he also looks staunchly heroic as he speaks to his troop.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{you guys were hand picked. a special unit. most of you have been sitting on your asses, drawing pay checks for more than two years. well... it's time to repay those... government loans.}

<D>__{bull shit. i'm not...}
<A>__{wesker lifts his automatic. speyer flinches. the action wasn't meant as a threat. wesker is just checking his ammo.}
