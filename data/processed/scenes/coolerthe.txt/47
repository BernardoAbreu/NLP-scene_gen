<L>__{interior casino receiving area night}
<A>__{slot machines everywhere some on the way out, some on the way in. crates of casino supplies. bernie rushes in with natalie behind him. heading for an aural beacon of blows landing on flesh... grunting,}
<B>__{pleading...}
<A>__{...arriving to find tony and lou kicking the shit out of mikey on the floor. charlene lies clutching her belly a few feet away. shelly swings a baseball bat, warming up for some blood sport. larry watches from the sidelines at once appalled and enthralled.}
<C>__{charlene}
<D>__{oh my god... i can feel the contractions coming on...}
<A>__{bernie rushes over to shelly...}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{shelly, stop them! don't do this!}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{get lost, bernie, this got nothing to do with you.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{it's got everything to do with me. he's my son.}
<A>__{everyone stops dead. freeze frame. shelly gets a weird look in his eye. a fuse has just been lit...}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{i said, he's my }
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{who? this little prick?}
<A>__{shelly smashes mikey across the shoulder with the bat. aarrrgggghhh!!! shelly raises the bat to cream mikey again... bernie grabs shelly's arm. shelly shoves him back. raises the bat again...}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{pop, help me...}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{shelly, don't you fucking do it!}
<A>__{shelly freezes. he lowers the bat, throws it aside. grabs bernie by his collar...}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{were you in on this? jesus, you better come clean with me.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{no! god, no! i didn't know nothing about it.}
<A>__{shelly releases bernie. there's a strange look in shelly's eye. we see the wheels turning...}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{how much you think their lives are worth, bernie? myself, i don't think they're worth piss. but, hey, it ain't my kid...}
<A>__{bernie sees where shelly's going with this. we can almost hear the cell door slamming in his head.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{let me see: they were up almost a hundred and fifty grand. that's 150 g's someone's gonna have to account for. what do you say, bernie, seventy five grand a piece?}
<A>__{bernie glances over at natalie. she has tears in her eyes. he looks to shelly pleadingly. please don't do this...}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{hey, i know you don't have that kind of cash. but, since you're a friend of the house, i'm willing to front you.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{shelly, they didn't get away with the money... you didn't lose anything...}
<A>__{shelly glances over at lou, nods. lou kicks mikey in the face. his nose snaps like a twig.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{oh jesus... yes! all right. it's on me. 150 g's.}
<A>__{charlene clutches her belly, moans...}
<C>__{charlene}
<D>__{oh god, oh god... you gotta get me to the hospital... contractions...}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{shelly, please help her. that's my grandson...}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{hey, why don't we all break out the champagne? lootz is about to become a granddaddy.}
<P>__{(walks over to her)}
<D>__{how you doin' there, sweetheart? must hurt like crap, huh?}
<C>__{charlene}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{hurts so bad...}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{yeah?}
<A>__{suddenly shelly kicks charlene in the belly! wham! she screeches out.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{oh god...}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{jesus nooooo!!!}
<A>__{even shelly's goons can't believe what they've just witnessed. larry is aghast. bernie rushes shelly, starts raining blows on him. shelly swats him off. he drops down next to the squirming girl, rips her sweater and blouse up over her stomach... ...to reveal a mound of fake padding. he tears the padding away from her, throws it at bernie.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{here! it's a fuckin' boy. anyone got a cigar?}
<A>__{the muscle start laughing it up. relief. larry emits a nervous giggle. natalie's jaw hits the floor. bernie takes a step back. he's about to go into serious shock. charlene curls over, sobbing.}
<C>__{shelly}
<P>__{(to bernie)}
<D>__{you sure you still want to be good for it? because if you want to change your mind, i don't blame you.}
<A>__{bernie looks over at mikey. he stares up at his father, trembling.}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{i will make it up to you, pop, i swear...}
<A>__{bernie holds his son's gaze for a beat. he's almost tempted to... he just shrugs and nods at shelly.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{it's on me.}
<C>__{shelly}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{that's the worst fucking call you ever made in your life.}
<A>__{on natalie at that moment. we can tell she agrees with shelly... but thinks all the more of bernie for it. that might even be love in her eyes. shelly snatches his baseball bat up off the floor. walks over to mikey, and brings it down full force, pulverizing mikey's left kneecap. oh man, the scream...}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{what are you doing?! i thought we had }
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{150 g's buys their lives. this is just a little slap on the wrist to remember me by.}
<A>__{natalie turns her head. she's about to throw up. larry watches, unflinchingly. charlene is making with some serious pleading now.}
<C>__{charlene}
<D>__{oh god... it wasn't my idea.}
<A>__{shelly steps up to charlene, tapping the base of the bat in the palm of his hand. he smiles reassuringly at her.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{you know, motherhood is a beautiful thing. this... you made a mockery out of it. maybe you'll get to experience it for real one day.}
<C>__{charlene}
<P>__{(nods, sobbing)}
<D>__{i want... to be a mother... please don't hurt me...}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{i'm not going to hurt you.}
<A>__{shelly turns his back on her. charlene starts sobbing relief. they're not going to hurt her. it's going to be all right. wrong. shelly throws the bat to lou. the heavy steps up to the plate (as we rack focus to shelly walking away) crunch!!! followed by the girl's shrieks. natalie buries her head in bernie's shoulder.}
<C>__{shelly}
<P>__{(to tony and lou)}
<D>__{get 'em outta here. you ever see them in this joint again, kill 'em.}
<C>__{shelly}
<P>__{(to bernie and natalie)}
<D>__{you two, you're still on shift.}
<A>__{shelly catches larry's eye: i hope you were taking notes.}
