<D>__{we'll say the cow is the primary guard outside the bunker. we pull up fast, and stop short.}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{got it.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{and go.}
<A>__{the cow stares as the humvee pulls up to it fast. troy and doc jump out, pistols drawn, flank the cow the cow steps back, and explodes. troy and doc stand splattered with cow entrails. the cow's head lands with a}
<D>__{thud on the hood of the humvee.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{who's hurt?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{it's all cow, i think.}
<C>__{vig}
<D>__{yeah, it's all cow.}
<A>__{he picks cow entrails off himself.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{they said this was swept for mines.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{mines are forever, doc. they never get all of 'em.}
<C>__{troy}
<P>__{(low murmur)}
<D>__{'if you could, help me rhonda, help help me rhonda '}
<A>__{archie watches troy.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{did you guys see any action at all?}
<C>__{vig}
<D>__{only night bombing on cnn, except for troy's supercool shooting that guy in the neck }
<A>__{archie takes vig's big pistol and empties the shells and puts them into his pocket.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{is sepsis cool?}
<C>__{vig}
<D>__{what's sepsis?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{infection of the blood.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{as in septic tank, because that's what happens when a bullet hits you. the lead tears in there }
<A>__{fantasy interior stomach muscle and tissue slow motion, a bullet pierces flesh, makes a cavity }
<C>__{archie gates }
<D>__{makes a cavity of dead tissue that closes down in a convulsive motion typical of all gunshot wounds. the cavity fills up with bile and bacteria and you're fucked.}
<A>__{bile fluid fills the cavity.}
<B>__{back to the scene}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{but other than a wound that blinds, paralyzes, or castrates, the worst wound i've ever seen is something called tension pneumo thorax }
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i heard something about that }
<C>__{vig}
<D>__{tension pneumo what?}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{a bullet, or a blade doesn't kill you, but makes a little hole in the lung, so every time you breathe, a little air leaks into the chest cavity, which starts to fill up like a balloon. and that balloon starts to push your organs to the side, crushing your lung, your liver, your heart. your own breathing kills you, one breath at a time kinda like a job you can't stand or a bad lie you once told.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{that's not fatal, they can stop it.}
<C>__{archie gates}
<D>__{if you know how to make another little hole in the chest to let the air out, just like you would with an overinflated tire.}
<A>__{they look at archie, scared by this.}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{can we play the beach boys when we go in?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{the goddamn beach boys.}
<C>__{troy}
<D>__{i'm not ashamed of liking the beach boys. it calms me down. better than mozart.}

<D>__{bach.}
