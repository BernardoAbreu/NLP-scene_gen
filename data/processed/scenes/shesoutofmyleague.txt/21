<L>__{interior broadcast booth}
<A>__{the radio announcers are calling the game.}
<C>__{announcer}
<D>__{forty five seconds left on the power play and the sharks are knocking at the door.}
<L>__{interior hockey arena}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{so, after the game, you wanna party?}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{you know my policy on players, bobby. and you might have noticed we've already got dates.}
<A>__{the penalty ends and the ref opens the box but reese is not paying attention.}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{come on, molly. just give me a chance, eh. i'm a great guy ask any of these assholes.}
<A>__{the crowd is booing reese.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{reese, you'd better...}
<C>__{reese}
<D>__{you can't seriously be blowing me off for these two hosers.}
<C>__{stainer}
<D>__{hey! fuck you reese! you suck this year anyway!}
<A>__{reese raises his squirt bottle over the glass and squirts stainer.}
<C>__{stainer }
<D>__{you dick!}
<A>__{stainer is immediately on his feet, climbing the glass and trying to pummel the huge player. security is on him in a flash and dragging him, kicking & swearing, out of the arena. reese wakes up and skates out of the box but it's too late. the sharks score and the crowd revolts. a red haired redneck woman, sitting two rows back, calls out to molly and company.}
<D>__{red haired woman you idiots just cost us a goal! i hope you're happy!}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{you'd better check that tone, reba! you do not want me comin' up there!}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{patty! stop it! i will go see what i can do about stainer.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no, this is my fault, i will take care of it.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{no, it's okay. i know the head of security. i will be right back.}
<A>__{molly exits and patty sits back down next to kirk.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{god, i'm really embarrassed.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{that's okay, if reese did that to me i'd have gone over the glass too. but i would have landed a few before they got me. reese has been all over molly ever since she dumped her boyfriend. i tell you, that girl has nothing but trouble when it comes to men.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{what? how is that even possible? she's so...}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{tell me about it. i'm no lezbo but sometimes she makes me want to strap on if know what i'm saying.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{yeah. i think i do.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{it's a curse, looking like that. who has the balls to hit on her? just the most arrogant a holes like reese out there.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{yeah, i suppose.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{listen, molly brought me along tonight because, you know, she thought i might be 'interested.'}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh. oh yeah?}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{but, just for honesty's sake, i'm not interested. no offense.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{no! hey! none taken. i don't blame you. i know i'm no brad pitt. that's cool.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{what? you? no, i'm talking about your pal, stainer. i know he's your friend but he seems like kind of a dumbshit. (then) wait. why would you think i was talking about you?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i didn't mean to assume anything.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{oh my god. you don't have a clue do you? molly's really into you.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{oh, yeah right!}
<A>__{kirk laughs hard until he realizes that patty isn't laughing. patty's nod says, "i'm serious."}
<C>__{kirk }
<D>__{but... why would...}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{a knockout like molly be interested in a spud like you?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{well, yeah.}
<C>__{patty}
<D>__{got me. again, no offense. but listen, kirk, your dream girl just showed up. try not to blow it.}
<A>__{close on kirk's terrified expression. the sound of a bowling ball demolishing ten pins...}
