<D>__{you seem surprised. did you really take me for a man who could be dispatched like a truculent servant? i see before me a conspiracy of arrogant old men puffed up by the illusion of their own vainglory. in your hands this once great parliament has become nothing more than a drunken satyr, stumbling about the world's stage seeking nothing more than to satiate your own lust and gluttony; your britches stained by the incontinence of your hypocrisy. i will not sit idly by and watch you violate the innocence of the public trust as you drag this great empire into the quagmire that your pride has dug and filled with the excrement of your corruption. i am here to change all this.}
