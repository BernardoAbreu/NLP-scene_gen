<L>__{exterior truck long beach streets day}
<A>__{(chopin prelude over:) the truck slows and comes to a stop at a signal. bobby jumps out and moves to the sidewalk. following with him as he wanders, boozed and aimless, along the dispirited cheap streets of the city.}
<L>__{interior diner late night}
<A>__{rayette clears some plates from an empty table and, crossing the diner, sees... ... bobby entering. as he takes a seat at the counter, she goes about her tasks, ignoring him. he watches her as she moves to the only other customer and totals his bill. another waitress appears with a coffee silex. she gestures it at bobby and he nods. as she pours him a cup, rayette moves to the register, deposits some bills, then turns and exits to the kitchen.}
