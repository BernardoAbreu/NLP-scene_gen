<A>__{enjolras re enters the barricade through the secret gate. he has been on a reconnaissance. he looks at the street. no one is stirring, but for a single shutter which opens a crack a face peeps and it closes again. below him the students are up and getting ready.}
<C>__{enjolras}
<D>__{the people have not stirred.}
<C>__{courfeyrac}
<D>__{yet we will not abandon those who still live in fear.}

<D>__{so you'd better run for cover when the pup grows }
<A>__{crack! a musket shot. gavroche falls face down onto the barricade.}
<C>__{courfeyrac}
<D>__{no o!}
<A>__{he runs up the barricade, seizes gavroche's body in his arms, convulsed with grief, and brings it back through the gate in the barricade. at the other end of the street javert has appeared. he sees this gate. and talks to the army officer. as the smoke from the muskets clears horses are revealed drawing field artillery into position. the army officer is lining up the big guns carefully.}
<C>__{army officer}
<D>__{you at the barricades listen to this! the people of paris sleep in their beds! you have no chance, no chance at all! why throw your lives away?}

<C>__{courfeyrac}
<D>__{make'em pay for every man!}
<C>__{enjolras}
<D>__{let others rise to take our place until the earth is free!}
<A>__{the sun now appears above the rooftops of the city. and the big guns fire boom! boom! boom! the bombardment hits the barricade, rocking it. in its wake a massive barrage of musket fire. the big gun has been lined up with the gate and has burst right through in the first hit. bullets fly, and every few moments another cannon ball smashes into the piled debris. javert is glimpsed among the attackers. enjolras and the students throw themselves onto the barricades, firing at the attackers, handing their rifles down to others to be re loaded, firing again. valjean moves among them, tending to the wounded, lifting down the dead, regardless of his own safety. marius takes a bullet, and crumples and falls. valjean runs towards him crash! the latest cannonade bursts a hole in the barricade and now the soldiers are storming through. the hard core of student fighters retreat, firing as they go, into the cafe musain.}
