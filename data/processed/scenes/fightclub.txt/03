<A>__{men are paired off, hugging, talking in emotional tones. near the door, a sign on a stand: "remaining men together."}

<D>__{this was a support group for men with testicular cancer. the big moosie slobbering all over me was bob.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{we're still men.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yes. we're men. men is what we are.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{six months ago, bob's testicles were removed. then hormone therapy. he developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen. that was where my head fit into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of god's as big.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{they're gonna have to open my pec's again to drain the fluid.}
<A>__{bob hugs tighter; then looks with empathy into jack's eyes.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{okay. you cry now.}
<A>__{jack looks at bob.}
<C>__{jack }
