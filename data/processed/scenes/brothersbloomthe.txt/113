<L>__{interior curators apartment bedroom later}
<A>__{penelope and bloom wander into the bedroom, looking at an array of beautiful paintings on the wall.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{gin is slow death, man.}
<A>__{stephen and the chink poke their heads in, leaving. the curator strolls in.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{we'll see you back at the hotel.}
<P>__{(glances at the curator)}
<D>__{soon.}
<A>__{they go, leaving bloom and penelope, who squints at an unframed oil on canvas, of a lonely stone well in a primeval forest clearing. it sits at the foot of an unmade bed.}
<C>__{the curator}
<D>__{from a private collection on the island of ikaria. that one.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{who painted it?}
<C>__{the curator}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{why is it the last thing you see every night, and the first thing you see every morning?}
<C>__{the curator}
<D>__{that's a story. you have a minute?}
<A>__{he closes the blinds and sits on a stool in front of the painting. setting the stage.}
<C>__{the curator }
<D>__{my daughter travelled with me when she was very young, and i'd show her the places and the art, all the most joyous and terrifying things in the world.}
<A>__{memories of his daughter's hand in his, flashing against the sun.}
<D>__{the curator (cont'd) (cont'd) i wanted that the world was alive in the most fantastic way for her. to built her a pair of wings. make these things real. but maybe more than any other objet d'art, she loved to hear she'd ask to hear the story of the stone golem. from a painting in a small private collection on the island of ikaria.}
<A>__{he motions to the painting, and we move into it. as he tells the story the scenes are shown in the painting, just as still images, which we move across like a picture book.}
<D>__{the curator (cont'd) (cont'd) well rachel, like most monsters the golem was once a human. a boy, about your age. the curator (cont'd) (cont'd) and one day the boy was walking home, and he quarrelled, he fought, with a good friend of his. they got very angry and his friend pushed him a certain way and the boy fell and struck his head and died. the boy's friend was very sad but also very frightened. so instead of telling the boy's parents, he did something awful. he pulled the body into a quarry, a pit of broken rocks, and hid the boy beneath a pile of large stones. well. years went by, and the boy's friend became a young man, and one day while drinking in town (which}
<P>__{in his guilt he did quite a lot of)}
<D>__{he heard that a well was being built near the forest... with the stones from the quarry. he ran to the quarry to find it nearly empty... no stones, no body. he ran to the well where the masons were finishing their work. `did they find anything strange in the quarry?' he asked, expecting, maybe hoping they'd arrest him for the awful crime on the spot. but no, they said, motioning to the well. nothing strange. just stones. they left him alone there at the well, and he stood looking into it as the sun fell behind the mountains and twilight set the world in a deep, still silence.}
<A>__{the last image we land on is the well, alone in the clearing. its dark innards loom ominously in the long pregnant silence that follows. then, with a piercing roar, a living monster of stone lunges out of the well, animated and terrifying, grabs the friend by the throat and with a crunching of bones and one last roar pulls him back down into the depths of the well. silence again. we pull out of the painting, back to the curator, sitting very still.}
<C>__{the curator }
<D>__{my daughter died nineteen years ago today. she was six. she went out to play one afternoon and vanished.}
<C>__{the curator }
<D>__{the next morning we found her, in a stone well on a neighboring property. i climbed down to her, but slipped and broke my leg, and while we waited for the rescue team to pull us out she died in my arms. if you've had a child... my whole everything just focused down to one thing, to hold her and make her feel safe. but no matter what i said to her, i couldn't stop her shaking, crying. her last moments on this earth were filled with terror. of a stone golem.}
<A>__{he stands, opens the blinds, pours another drink.}
<C>__{the curator }
<D>__{it was the first painting i `acquired.' i keep it maybe hoping some night the golem will come for me.}
