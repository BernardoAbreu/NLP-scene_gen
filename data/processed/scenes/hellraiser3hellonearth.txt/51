<A>__{joey sitting up in bed, eyes wide, still screaming.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{nooooooooooo!}
<A>__{the cry cuts off abruptly as joey realizes where she is. she catches her breath and then freezes as she realizes that the buzzing sound from her dream is present in her bedroom. are the flies still feeding? she glances around her room. angle on bedroom tv joey's pov her tv set is on. the buzzing sound comes from white noise. joey is puzzled and scared.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{is somebody here? is somebody here!? terri ... ?}
<A>__{she half gets out of bed and then stops, transfixed, as the tv screen's white noise is replaced by an image.}
<B>__{angle on tv}
<A>__{as in the editing suite, the image is grainy black and white. the buzzing continues, now joined by hissing and whistling that fades in and out as if unseen hands are trying to tune into an impossibly distant station. somewhere in the sound montage we can almost hear ghostly voices whispering; "joey, joey, joey ... " on the screen, an english officer elliott is sitting cross legged on the floor of a quonset hut. on the floor in front of him is something at which he stares something that the image is not sharp enough to show. wider angle joey and tv fear vies with fascination in joey's expression.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{what ... what's going on? what's happening?}
<B>__{angle on tv}
<A>__{the image disappears in a burst of static which in turn is replaced by another image, still monochrome and grainy; a head and shoulders of elliott, staring directly out of the screen.}
<C>__{elliott}
<D>__{you have to help me, joey.}
<A>__{a burst of static and the image disappears completely. the tv is obviously not turned on. the room is silent. joey stares at her dead tv in numbed silence. she falls back into bed, pulling the covers protectively around her, staring at the ceiling.}
