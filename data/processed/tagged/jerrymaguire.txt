<A>__{(the movie, which plays simultaneously with the conversation, is a hi 8 confessional of jerry's former girlfriends. michael jordan is cut into this, nodding, as if he were actually interviewing. the effect is funny, but the confessions are brutally honest. there is the one he was too good for, the one he wasn't good enough for ("he hated being alone.") the still in love girlfriend, the punk rock girlfriend ("sports makes me ill"), the now married with kids girlfriend, the cynical girlfriend ("beneath the cute exterior, more cute exterior.") the purely sexual girlfriend, the brainy girlfriend, ("great at friendship, bad at intimacy") and even the girlfriend who does a great jerry imitation (rubbing her face, she does a flawless jerry on his way to the airport). all seem to agree on some basic points (and if necessary maybe jordan narrates the following information to underscore it.) jerry always has a girlfriend, and many met him on the first day he'd broken up with the last one. the relationship always competes with his job, and the job always wins. the final confrontation happens somewhere around the 18 month mark. sequence ends with avery in character, wielding a blowtorch, threatening to burn all these old phone numbers.)}

("i will either surf or ski.") jerry admires his fiancee. there is nothing more attractive than a person burningly efficient at their job. shot drifts off this media bubble to find tidwell watching at the outskirts. he turns and exits unnoticed.}

<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{come on. come with me. we're going to take a walk through this lobby. i want every media guy, every player rep, everybody to see you for what you are. the best kept secret in the nfl. the biggest wide receiver in the game. let 'em see ya, rod. and whatever you do, don't sit down. let 'em see how big you are. you ready? let's do it.}

<A>__{maguire and tidwell move through the brightly lit lobby, past the reporters, the competing agents, the team representatives, the already blasted jets fans, past even a nike crew filming an nfl spot in the lobby. portable phones everywhere, in every hand. there is a heavy white media light bathing everything as if life had become a t.v. show, and everything within it concerned making other t.v. shows. jerry works hard, introduces tidwell around. and tidwell is natural, polite and charming, as they move through the pre draft crowd. he does not sit down. music continues.}

<D>__{sorry. uh, let me see, have a seat. i will get you some aloe vera for that cut too.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{do you have something to drink?}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{sure }
<A>__{she moves to the kitchen door. she is about to exit, when jerry begins to unburden.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{my brother works for the white house. he pretends he's an intellectual. he pretends he's from the east coast.}
<A>__{she turns, not quite sure what his point is. she waits politely for jerry to finish before exiting into the kitchen.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i was supposed to be the successful one.}
<P>__{(more)}
<C>__{jerry }
<D>__{but i don't want to talk about it. and yet! my family. i grew up with repression as a... a religion you don't bitch. no moaning! head down. do it, whatever "it" may be. my dad... he worked for the united way for 38 years! you know what he said when he retired? he said, "i wish i'd had a more comfortable chair." 38 years he sat in it! do you know what i'm saying, dorothy? repression as a religion. i'm almost as old as his chair.}
<A>__{he rubs his face. she looks at him, and the situation slightly overwhems her. here he is, wide open, ripe for the taking.}

<D>__{beer okay?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{yeah, thanks.}
<L>__{interior kitchen}
<A>__{laurel smokes a cigarette and blows it out the window. dorothy goes for the refrigerator, finds a couple beers.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{i heard.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{no kidding. i looked over and saw the shadow of two curious shoes in the doorway of the kitchen.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{this guy would go home with a gardening tool right now if it showed interest.}
<P>__{(off dorothy's look)}
<D>__{wait. use the frosted glasses.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<P>__{(surprised)}

<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{that's the girl i love.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{but you just gotta hear me out on one thing. you're very responsible with ray and you know it's not right for a little boy to hear some strange man's voice in the house.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{as opposed to twenty angry women?}
<A>__{dorothy turns quickly and the beer, sisters and chicken collide in the small kitchen. dorothy deftly catches the food in her t shirt, and dumps it back onto the plate. but her shirt is now stained. she starts to quietly implode, and laurel takes command. they know each other well.}

<D>__{come on, let's get you another top }
<A>__{they exit to nearby laundry room.}

<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{all i'm saying. you don't have the luxury of falling for some drowning man. be practical. now. which top?}
<A>__{she holds up two tops. one is sexier with a dipped down front. the other is striped, cute, functional.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{okay, you want to talk about practical? let's talk about my wonderful life. do you know what most other women my age are doing right now? they are partying in clubs, trying to act stupid, trying to get a man, trying to keep a man... not me. i'm trying to raise a man.}
<A>__{she grabs the sexier top, and puts it on.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i've got a 24 hour a day reminder of roger, for the rest of my life. i have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self sufficient all friends of yours i might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath. look at me, laurel, look at me. i'm the oldest 26 year old in the world! how do i look?}

<D>__{truth?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{dorothy turns to see that laurel's two shoes are still very visible at the kitchen door. decides to ignore them. she gets closer.}

<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{well, good evening.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{good evening.}
<A>__{he stands, returns the fireplace poker to her, and exits. stumbling slightly on the first step leading down from the front porch, he recovers with style.}

<D>__{we'll be okay. and i'm going to take my... one client and we're gonna go all the way.}

<A>__{jerry maguire surrounded by well wishers and backslappers and sportswriters. success has returned, in all of it's superficial grandeur. he is a star again, by association. we catch the look on maguire's face. try as he might, he can't manufacture the joy of the moment. there is a void. over the heads of the heatseekers we see dennis wilburn nodding, holding a thumbs up. he tries to get to maguire, but cannot. and then a commotion behind them all.}
<C>__{reporter}
<D>__{it's tidwell!}
<A>__{tidwell exits the locker room. press and media surround him. even the grizzled old time stadium workers reach in to squeeze him, to slap him, to touch him. he works his way to maguire. they hug. cameras flash. tears roll down from beneath his purple shades.}
<C>__{tidwell}
<D>__{we did it.}
<A>__{and now, in the middle of this emotional union, a portable phone rings. both men reach for their porties. it's maguire's. with anticipation, he answers.}

<D>__{hello.}

<D>__{it's marcee. she says she couldn't get through on your phone.}
<A>__{tidwell grabs the phone, and joyously shares the moment with his wife. jerry watches, as tidwell leans on his shoulder. on sugar and swenson (watching them) bob sugar watches from the nearby wall where he stands with his client, quarterback john swenson.}

<D>__{why don't we have that kind of relationship?}

<P>__{(indicates kicker)}
<D>__{i wondered if you would sign this for me. because it inspired me.}
<A>__{he withdraws a well thumbed copy of jerry's mission statement. the blue cover is ripped along one edge. it clearly has served as a manifesto for this younger man's career.}
<B>__{on jerry maguire}
<A>__{he feels the cover, flips through it a little. memories flood with the passing pages. shot holds on jerry's face, as tidwell continues singing in the background. suddenly, an odd feeling. a shiver runs up and down his spine. his forehead tingles. he rubs his face. all he can do is think of dorothy.}

<P>__{(off jan's guilty look)}
<D>__{i've not been fair to you. women need to stick together, and not depend on the affections of a man to "fix" their lives. maybe you're all correct. men are the enemy.}
