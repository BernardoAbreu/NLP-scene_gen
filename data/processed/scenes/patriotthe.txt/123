<A>__{charlotte steps out of the shadows, watching the reunion as marion covers the children with kisses, trying to hug all of them at once as they cling to him as if they'll never let go. marion and charlotte lock eyes over the heads of the children.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{charlotte smiles. then marion notices susan peeking out from behind charlotte's patched and mended skirt. he kneels down and opens his arms to her but she doesn't move. he smiles to her and speaks softly:}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{susan...}
<A>__{she looks coldly at marion, tightens her grip on charlotte's skirt and retreats further behind her. marion looks to charlotte who nods with guarded reassurance. then his attention is drawn away by the demanding embraces of his other children.}
