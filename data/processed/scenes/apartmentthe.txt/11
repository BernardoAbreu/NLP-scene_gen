<L>__{interior the apartment evening}
<A>__{bud, loosening his tie, goes into the kitchen, opens the oven, turns off the gas. he takes a coke out of the refrigerator, uncaps it, gets a knife and fork from a drawer, and using his handkerchief as a potholder, pulls the hot aluminum tray out of the oven. he carries everything out into the living room. in the living room, bud sets his dinner down on the coffee table, settles himself on the couch. he rears up as something stabs him, reaches under his buttocks, pulls out a hairpin. he drops it into an ashtray, tackles his dinner. without even looking, he reaches over to the end table and presses the remote tv station selector. he takes a sip from the coke bottle, his eyes on the tv screen across the room. the picture on the tv set jells quickly. against a background of crisscrossing searchlights, a pompous announcer is making his spiel.}

<D>__{but first, a word from our sponsor. if you smoke the modern way, don't be fooled by phony filter claims }
<A>__{bud, still eating, automatically reaches for the station selector, pushes the button. a new channel pops on. it features a western cockamamie indians are attacking a stagecoach. that's not for bud. he switches to another station. in a frontier saloon, gower street cowboys are dismantling the furniture and each other. bud wearily changes channels. but he can't get away from westerns on this station, the u.s. cavalry is riding to the rescue. will they get there in time? bud doesn't wait to find out. he switches channels again, and is back where he started. on the screen, once more, is the announcer standing in front of the crisscrossing searchlights.}

<P>__{(unctuously)}
<D>__{friends, do you have wobbly dentures ?}
<A>__{that does it. bud turns the set off in disgust. the tv screen blacks out, except for a small pinpoint of light in the center, which gradually fades away. in the bathroom, bud, in pajamas by now, is brushing his teeth. from the shower rod hang three pairs of socks on stretchers. bud takes a vial from the medicine shelf, shakes out a sleeping pill, washes it down with a glass of water. he turns the light off, walks into the bedroom. in the bedroom, the single bed is made, and the lamp on the night table is on. bud plugs in the electric blanket, turns the dial on. then he climbs into bed, props up the pillow behind him. from the night table, he picks up the magazine that arrived in the mail, slides it out of the wrapper, opens it. it's the new issue of playboy. bud leafs through it till he comes to the piece de resistance of the magazine. he unfolds the overleaf, glances at it casually, refolds it, then turns to the back of the magazine and starts to read. what he is so avidly interested in is the men's fashion section. there is a layout titled what the young executive will wear with a sub head reading the bowler is back. illustrating the article are several photographs of male models wearing various styles of bowlers. bud is definitely in the market for a bowler, but somehow his mind starts wandering. he turns back to the overleaf again, unfolds it, studies it, then holds the magazine up vertically to get a different perspective on the subject. by now the sleeping pill is beginning to take effect, and he yawns. he drops the magazine on the floor, kills the light, settles down to sleep. the room is dark except for the glow from the dial of the electric blanket. three seconds. then the phone jangles shrilly in the living room. bud stumbles groggily out of bed, and putting on his slippers, makes his way into the living room. he switches on the light, picks up the phone.}
