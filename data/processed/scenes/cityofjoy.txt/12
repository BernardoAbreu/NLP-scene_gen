<L>__{interior 180 four seater day}
<A>__{max is crammed into the back seat with the plump ravi.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{we see now that, contrary to our assumption that veejay would be in the left seat, it's manubai who's flying the plane. the noise of the engine forces them to speak somewhat loudly.}
<C>__{veejay}
<D>__{we were among the fortunate back in '48. we got out of east bengal before partition destroyed so many. we make mattresses. the rajah double spring.}
<A>__{veejay has an old flask out.}
<C>__{veejay}
<D>__{we don't have a flight attendant on this flight...}
<P>__{(passing the flask)}
<D>__{are you a musician, mr. loeb?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{unattached trumpet player and recently certified associate guru.}
<A>__{as he takes a hit on the flask, max's eye focuses on the little mirror on the dash. in it he can see manubai's eyes. if we were to judge by what he sees in them, she doesn't find him the least bit amusing. he smiles his smile at her.}
