<L>__{interior emily's house (continuous) night}
<A>__{bella hesitantly enters behind jared and embry. she sees emily, 20, at a counter, popping fresh muffins out of a tin. see only one side of emily's beautiful face, draped by long black hair.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{you guys hungry? like i have to ask...}
<A>__{emily looks toward them now revealing the other side of her face: a scar runs from hairline to chin, three red lines that pull down her eye and twist her mouth.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{who's this?}
<A>__{as jared and embry beeline for the muffins }
<C>__{jared}
<D>__{bella swan. who else?}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{so you're the vampire girl.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{and you're a... you're all...}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{werewolves? i'm just engaged to one. but these animals }
<P>__{(slaps embry's hand)}
<D>__{save some for your brothers.}
<A>__{bella cautiously approaches the counter, keeping an eye on the door for jacob.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{leave it to jacob to get around sam's gag order.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{he didn't say anything, or... couldn't.}
<C>__{embry}
<D>__{that's a wolf thing. alpha's orders get obeyed whether we want to or not }
<C>__{jared}
<D>__{how `bout you shut up now, embry?}
<C>__{embry}
<D>__{you know jacob's gonna fill her in.}
<C>__{jared}
<D>__{yeah, i know every stupid thought he has.}
<P>__{(to bella)}
<D>__{wanna know what he thinks of you?}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{like you need special powers to know that.}
<C>__{embry}
<P>__{(to bella)}
<D>__{it's another wolf thing. we hear each other's thoughts. good for hunting. embarrassing for everything else.}
<A>__{jared leans to bella, challenging.}
<C>__{jared}
<D>__{freaking out yet?}
<C>__{bella}
<P>__{(meets his look)}
<D>__{you're not the first mind reader i've met.}
<C>__{embry}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{jake's right. you are good with the weird.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{but i don't get how? why? }
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{ because there are bad things here.}
<A>__{she spins sam is now standing behind her, the front door open behind him.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{and they're getting worse.}
<A>__{bella is chilled. sam moves past her to emily the sight of her instantly warms his face.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{hey, em.}
<A>__{he kisses emily's scarred face adoringly. bella has to look away. their utter devotion is a painful reminder of what she has lost. fortunately, she's distracted by jacob and paul's arrival. they laugh and jab one another. bella is relieved to find jacob unscathed. jared and embry crowd them, finding a scar on paul's arm }
<C>__{embry}
<D>__{ha! pay up.}
<A>__{as jared reluctantly hands embry five bucks, jacob's eyes find bella's. he nods solemnly to the door; we should talk.}
