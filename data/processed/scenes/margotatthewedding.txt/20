<A>__{margot strides toward the tree. the group follows behind. she grabs hold of a branch and lifts herself. claude grins, impressed. with brisk dexterity, margot scales the tree. claude, pauline, malcolm and ingrid watch with glee from below.}

<A>__{margot reaches a perch near the top and looks down at the gang. they wave. she waves back. the sun is hot. she sweats, flushed. she takes a deep breath and relaxes against the bark. trees for miles. the neighbors' house is faded and grey. in the far distance, toxic white smoke comes out into the sky. an earwig walks across her arm. she flicks it off, slips for a moment and catches herself. her breathing grows more rapid. a bug buzzes around her head. she swats at it. her family has stopped watching. claude and malcolm throw a baseball. pauline's gone back inside. ingrid clears the table.}

<A>__{she wipes her face, her shirt is almost entirely soaked. the buzzing continues. close on margot's ear. a small black gnat lands on the lip of the lobe. it hesitates and darts inside the hole. margot gasps. she jams her pinky in her ear. pauline comes back out with an ice tea.}
