<L>__{int cadillac afternoon}
<A>__{they are driving along, both a little dishevelled, one of cass' hands cuffed to the passenger door. they pass casinos as they head out of atlantic city.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{your windshield's cracked.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{thanks, captain obvious.}
<A>__{cass turns to inspect him more closely.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{and you look like shit, milo. what have you been doing, sleeping on the floor?}
<A>__{milo has been sleeping on the floor.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i enjoy sleeping on the floor. matter of fact, i love sleeping on the floor. i love everything about my life. great job, good friends, hot girlfriend...}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{you have a girlfriend?}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(he does not)}
<D>__{yes i do.}
<A>__{cass is skeptical:}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{really? what's her name?}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(the first name that pops into his head:)}
<D>__{teresa. rocking hot body. likes to cook pasta for me and perform strip teases.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{wow. is she missing a chromosome?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{oh, she has all her chromosomes, believe you me.}
<A>__{cass thinks this over, then counters:}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{well, my life is great, too.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i can tell. you and stewart make a great couple, by the way. you and me made a terrible couple. but you two? like peas in a pod.}
<A>__{about to deny that she and stewart are a couple, it occurs to cass: milo seems a little jealous. she jumps on this:}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{you know what i like about stewart?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i can't imagine.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{he's not you.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{not even on his best day.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{or his worst.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i will bet he has a lot of those.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{still betting, huh?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{you can't win if you don't play.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{or, in your case, even if you do.}
<A>__{he shoots her a sharp look. she stares back, waiting.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i win all the time.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{really? i hadn't noticed.}
<A>__{ok. that is definitely a challenge.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{you know what? seeing as how i'm about to come into five grand...}
<A>__{milo makes a sudden turn off the highway and pulls into the parking lot of bally's casino.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i think i will do a little betting right now.}
<C>__{cass}
<D>__{don't you have to take me back?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{please. i have two days. a monkey could get you back in two days.}
<A>__{again: famous last words. milo exits the car. cass smiles to herself. this is obviously what she hoped would happen. she glances around, spots the duffle in the back seat. peeking out of the top of the duffle is the taser gun. hmm...}
