<A>__{close on phone, connected to the answering machine. the outgoing message trigger after the second ring.}

<P>__{(machine v.o.)}
<D>__{hi there.}
<P>__{(long pause)}
<D>__{ha ha ha, fooled you. you're talking to a machine, but don't by shy, it's okay. machines need love too, so talk to it and ginger, that's me, or sarah will get back to you. wait for the beep.}
<A>__{as the message plays, camera dollies off the phone machine and down the corridor of the dark apartment. as the bedroom door draws near, ginger's recorded voice fades and is super ceded by cries and moans.}
