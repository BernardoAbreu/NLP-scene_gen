<A>__{claude hurries toward the back and finds a window seat. he puts his bag next to him and looks out the dirty glass. claude's pov: margot, her back to him, puts her finger in her ear and shakes her head. the sweater around her waist loosens and drifts to the pavement. she starts walking. the bus hisses and lurches forward. claude strains to see: margot looks back. the bus groans as it picks up speed. margot sprints.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{wait!}
<A>__{she's runs full speed, waving her arms wildly.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{wait! wait!}
<A>__{she pants, breathless. the bus brakes. she passes claude's window. we stay on claude. he waits. finally, she appears next to him, covered in sweat, and panting. she kisses him on the head. the bus starts moving.}

<P>__{(almost euphoric)}
<D>__{did you see me running out there?}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{margot cranes her neck to see outside.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{good. that was a lot of running. i'm out of breath.}
<A>__{claude turns away from his mother and looks out the window.}
