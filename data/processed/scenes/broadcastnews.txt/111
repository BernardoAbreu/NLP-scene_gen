<P>__{(on tv)}
<D>__{good evening...in mood and language better suited to an espionage novel than the delicate world of the western alliance, the british foreign secretary today pounced on what he termed, 'the nest of profession spies and amateur traitors who were turning nato headquarters into an instrument whose only true function is folly.' we begin our coverage with edward towne in london.}
<A>__{aaron looks up takes a breath. he's done well he's punched his words and his one thought for the story. his gaze has been steady, his voice firm but he has begun to perspire. he dabs with his finger at the first trickles from his brow brushes some more prominent sweat from his upper lip... he beckons nervously to the makeup woman who comes in and dabs then dabs again as aaron feels himself under his arms...}
