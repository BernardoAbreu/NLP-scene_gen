<A>__{mom, beverly, a trim, fortyish, pretty betty crocker of the 90's, grabs the toast as it pops up and butters it. she waves cheerfully out the kitchen window to the passing garbagemen on the back of a baltimore county garbage truck and then turns to her husband and children and expertly begins to serve breakfast. dad, eugene, the ultimate nice guy and a dentist by trade, divides the morning paper up between himself and son chip, a cute semi hip kid who is still in high school. daughter, misty, a pretty and slightly overweight college student, frantically prices the junk she plans on selling at the flea market after classes while gulping down a light breakfast.}

<A>__{as mom serves the cereal, she spots a lone fly as it lands on the butter dish. without letting on to her family, she grabs a flyswatter and begins stalking the fly with a terrifying intensity, its buzzing enough to make mom's head explode.}
