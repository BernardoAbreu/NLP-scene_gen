<L>__{exterior alien landscape night}
<A>__{the moonless sky is filled with an utterly alien starfield. the jupiter two sits near the wall of the crater, its tiny lights fighting the otherworldly darkness.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{you violated a direct order.}
<L>__{interior engine room}
<A>__{cavernous. john and don stand by the giant drive engines. don is holding a cylinder containing a mixture of power chips, some glowing with radioactive fire, others dull and charred as coal.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{about half the core material is burned out. we'll never generate enough power to break orbit.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i told you not to blow that ship's reactors and you did it anyway.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{come on, professor, give it a rest. i was technically still in command.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{don't hand me that. i'm commander of this mission.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{look, no offense, but you're an egghead with an honorary rank. no one ever intended you to handle combat situations. you're spouting some nonsense about time travel while those spiders posed a continuing threat. i made a judgement call and if i have to i will make it again. hell, you of all people should understand that. if your father were here }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{my father is not here. my father is dead, killed in one of his combat missions you so admire. my family is on this ship and you're going to follow my orders. whether you agree with them or not. is that clear, major?}
<A>__{don's face is right up in john's.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{save the speeches. i like you. but the fate of the earth is at stake here. i'm going to do whatever i think it takes to ensure the success of this mission. with or without your help. is that clear, professor?}
<A>__{the two are too close to do anything but kiss or fight. kissing seems less than likely.}
<C>__{maureen }
<D>__{am i interrupting something?}
<A>__{wider. maureen stands in the doorway.}
<C>__{maureen}
<D>__{no. really. i think you two should go ahead and slug it out. i mean, here we are stranded on an alien world and you boys want to get into a pissing contest. so please, go for it. i will have judy down here in a heartbeat to declare you both unfit and i will take over this mission. now i don't want to hear another word from you two until you can play nice. is that clear?}
<C>__{john west}
<D>__{maureen listen }
<C>__{maureen}
<D>__{not another word.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{better. now if you've finished hosing down the decks with testosterone, i suggest you come with me. i may have found a way to get us off this planet.}
<A>__{maureen turns on her heal and exits. the two men exchange a look.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{wow.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{tell me about it.}
<A>__{they head after her. chapter 18: danger will! (out of sequence in screenplay.) }
