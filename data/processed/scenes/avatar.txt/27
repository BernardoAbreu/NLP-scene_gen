<L>__{interior bio lab day}
<A>__{jake and norm enter the bio lab a large lab complex with many adjoining rooms.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{me and norm were out here to drive these remotely controlled bodies called avatars. they're grown from human dna mixed with dna from the natives here.}
<A>__{a scientist, doctor max cullimore, is supervising the uncrating of two shipping containers. the nearer has the sides removed, revealing a ceiling height acrylic tank. norm stops to stare, and jake rolls past him as if drawn by some unseen force, toward the amnio tank. there is a figure floating lanquidly inside, which looks like a man. a very large, very blue, man. blood circulates through a synthetic umbilical in the abdomen. as the figure turns in the amniotic fluid, we see that it has a lemur like tail. the skin is cyan blue. long black hair drifts, graceful as seaweed.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{damn. they got big.}
<C>__{norm}
<D>__{yeah, they mature on the trip out.}
<P>__{(to max)}
<D>__{so the proprioceptive sims worked pretty well.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{yeah, they've got great muscle tone. give us a few hours, you guys can take them for a spin.}
<A>__{the figure's sleeping face turns toward us, and the features are despite feline ears and a long feral snout definitely jake's.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{it looks like him.}
<C>__{norm}
<D>__{no, it looks like you. this is your avatar now, jake.}
<A>__{on jake, mesmerized as he stares into the tank.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{the idea is every driver is matched to his own avatar }
<A>__{stereocam video shot of jake facing the camera, talking directly to the lens. jake's voice over up until now has been part of this videolog.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{ so their nervous systems are in tune. or something. which is why they offered me this gig, because i can link with tommy's avatar, which was insanely expensive.}
<P>__{(looking off camera)}
<D>__{is this right? i just say whatever in these videologs?}
<A>__{wider, showing norm working nearby with max.}
<C>__{norm}
<D>__{yeah. you just need to get in the habit of documenting everything what you see, what you feel it's all part of the science. good science starts with good observation.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{right.}
<P>__{(to camera)}
<D>__{so, whatever. here i am. doing science.}
<P>__{(looks around)}
<D>__{never been in a lab before.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{log off. it's time to meet your boss for the next five years.}
<A>__{he leads jake and norm through the short corridor to the }
