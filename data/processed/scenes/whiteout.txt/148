<A>__{carrie opens the door. illuminates the interior with her light. storage racks of frozen science samples line the three walls. lying on the floor are the bodies of mooney, rubin, weiss and keller. carry goes to weiss' body. kneels next to him. goes to unzip the bodybag, but sees that it's been locked with a plastic cinch. pulls out her knife. holds the light steady in her mouth as she cuts the cinch. unzips the bag. her light travels down his body to his left leg. she rolls it slightly for a better look. the truth hits her like a sledge hammer. there it is, like standing center stage in her light, the row of stitches holding a deep gash tight together. she's about to stand and walk out, but she stops herself. thinks about that leg, those stitches. the fact that doc lied to her. pans her light over at the other bodies on the floor. her light pans back, explores the rest of weiss' upper body sees a dried river of blood that's run out from under his armpit.}
