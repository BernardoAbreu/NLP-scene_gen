<A>__{the postman lies on a cot below the window. he's conscious, but pale as a ghost. abby brings him a bowl of soup. very thin soup. stirring it with a spoon, the postman smiles at abby.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{she turns her back on him without a word. the postman tries an exchange just the same.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i don't think i ever had water soup before. maybe next time we could try it with a little sand?}
<P>__{(as she doesn't respond)}
<D>__{dirt? wood?}
<P>__{(as she doesn't smile)}
<D>__{a twig garnish?}
<A>__{she goes about her business in silence.}

<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{you were with bethlehem. does that make you one of them?}
