<A>__{ruffling his hair; johan pulling away and glaring at him.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what now, captain?}
<C>__{stolz}
<D>__{word came to me that you were asking after your very good friend, miss bruwer. you know, subersives come in all guises and can be very resourceful. now let's take your friend, she has been using her privilege as a journalist to endanger the security of this country. but you know something else? she has been secretly holding a british passport. a south african passport and a british pasport. now you tell me, where is her patriotism? her allegiance? the minister telexed to the immigration officers here declaring her an undesirable immigrant. so she is being put on the first available plane to london. this must be heart breaking for you. good afternoon, meneer du toit, johan.}
<A>__{stolz walks back.}
<C>__{ben}

<C>__{ben}
