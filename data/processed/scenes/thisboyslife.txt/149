<L>__{interior drugstore afternoon}
<A>__{toby is sitting in a booth with mr. howard, a man in his late thirties. toby has made a real attempt to look good. his hair is modified, and he wears a tie and a suit.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{... yeah, i enjoy my classes, especially the ones that are advanced, but i've been feeling a little restless lately. it's hard to explain.}
<C>__{mr. howard}
<D>__{well, you're probably bored. not being challenged. your application was very good, toby, but we have many boys who want to go to hill. not everybody is comfortable at a prep school.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i think i would be. my father and brother went to prep schools.}
<C>__{mr. howard}
<D>__{is that right? where?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{deerfield and choate.}
<A>__{mr. howard is impressed.}
<C>__{mr. howard}
<D>__{i see. well, maybe you'd like it. hill was difficult for me, though classes were hard, and the boys seemed cold interested in money and social position.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{and i hated those snowy pennsylvania winters! but then in my last year, something changed. the guys in my class grew close, so close that i still think of them as a second family.}
<C>__{toby}
<P>__{(honest)}
<D>__{i want that. i do, and }
<A>__{he stops talking as we hear, o.s., "ag h h h!" psycho and arch have entered the drugstore. toby's back is to the door, and he slouches deeper into the booth, praying that he won't be seen. arch and psycho buy cigarettes.}
<C>__{arch}
<D>__{... so she said, 'no, i don't want you to do that,' and i said 'oh, baby, let me get down and grovel on it.' i mean, i ate her pussy 'til my tongue was calloused, and then...}
<A>__{arch moves toward the back of the store toward the area where toby sits. toby inches down a bit farther into the booth. arch stops at a sunglass rack five feet from toby and tries on a couple of pairs.}
<C>__{arch}
<D>__{... so anyway, she went off like a roman candle i mean that woman can scream. i said, 'you liked that, didn't you, baby?' i said, 'you liked the old arch cook special, didn't you?'}
<A>__{arch decides to let the sunglasses go. he and psycho move toward the front of the store, he talks about pussy. toby exhales.}
<C>__{mr. howard}
<D>__{toby, boys at hill talk roughly sometimes too you'd have to be ready for that. i can see you've had sort of a sheltered life.}
<A>__{toby nods his head.}
