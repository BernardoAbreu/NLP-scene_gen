<L>__{interior southwest bank conference room}
<A>__{carl walks into the conference room. the bank president, chris parker, motions to a seat.}
<C>__{chris parker}
<D>__{carl kendall? i'm chris parker. president of southwest bank.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i actually met you when i was just a teller.}
<C>__{chris parker}
<P>__{(no recollection of it at all)}
<D>__{of course!}
<P>__{(reading from a binder)}
<D>__{pet a puppy day. free cookie day. free half hour on the bank's punching bag day. you've upped walk in traffic by 35%. not only that you've also taken charge of corporate day care. i like a team player.}
<A>__{carl's phone buzzes. the caller id says lucy.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{chris parker}
<D>__{but then i got suspicious. what drives a man in his mid to late thirties who's still at the absolute lowest level of our corporate family? generous helpfulness? or raging revenge?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{generous helpfulness?}
<C>__{chris parker}
<D>__{which is when i got the numbers from your loan desk.}
<A>__{carl turns white. carl's phone buzzes again. the text says lucy: "where are you?"}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{chris parker}
<D>__{you've given out over 682 below minimum loans. one of them was literally for fifteen dollars and eighty seven cents.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{janice peabody's ant farm rental business.}
<C>__{chris parker}
<D>__{how do you explain yourself?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i've started a microloan project. i figure that if someone needs less than ten grand why should they go to a loan shark when they can come to a legitimate banking institution?}
<C>__{chris parker}
<D>__{because the paperwork makes any profit moot. unless you're raiding our coffers.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{no. i wouldn't do that.}
<C>__{chris parker}
<D>__{i would if i could, so why wouldn't you?}
<A>__{chris laughs. carl laughs. chris abruptly stops laughing. so does carl. carl's phone buzzes again. the text says lucy: "i thought we were meeting at one. please call back."}
<C>__{chris parker }
<D>__{but then i looked closer at the numbers. 85% of the loan recipients have been paying them off according to the bank's schedule. not just that, but 72% of that group have returned as regular full loan customers. this is both a moneymaker and good for the community. that like never happens!}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{chris parker}
<D>__{you're the kind of person we want in corporate. we're taking some clients on a golfing trip. you golf?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{chris parker}
<D>__{you free tomorrow?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{chris parker}
<D>__{of course you are. i better watch my back around you, carl kendall. soon you'll be taking my job. see you on the links.}
<A>__{chris parker grabs carl's hand and shakes it. carl runs out of the office.}
