<L>__{exterior truck wash day}
<A>__{jeff peers out from behind a parked mini van as trucks emerge wet and dripping from an immense truck wash. across the way, trucks are filling up on diesel at the gas islands. jeff's eyes narrow. is that red's peterbilt among them? he quickens his pace, then falls back, slumping. the rig's black driver is getting in the cab. jeff glances to the side, frowns. an older vacationing couple is eyeing jeff warily. jeff looks down, cops to it instantly. his clothes are ripped, caked with blood. he ducks between two parked cars, using a side view mirror as he hastily wipes blood off his face. he checks to be sure no one is watching. something catches his eye.}
