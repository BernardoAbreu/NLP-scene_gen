<ACTION_ALT>__{READER NOTE}
<ACTION>__{One thing that will be obvious to viewers, but not to readers, is that the nine principal parts in this film are played by only three actors:}
<LOC>__{1) Gary, Gavin, Gabriel 2) Sarah, Susan, Sierra 3) Margaret, Melissa, Mary}
<ACTION>__{It'll make more sense in context. Promise. A MAN'S HAND unwinds a short length of green string. We're extremely close, with a shallow, blurry focus. It's like the first moments after a dream -- just fragments. Scissors cut the string. The man wraps it around his left wrist. A loop. A bracelet. We see the man's teeth, the edge of his chin as he pulls the knot tight. His fingers pull against the string.   Solid.   It won't break easily.}

<ACTION>__{There's no music. No sound at all, really, except for some distant birds CHIRPING. Then a SQUEAK.   A SQUEAL as rusty springs engage. A GARAGE DOOR LIFTS, revealing GARY BANKS in silhouette. He's 30, effortlessly fit, with movie-star good looks. (Although for now, he's merely a TV star.) Like most Laurel Canyon garages, this one has never held a car. Instead, it's the resting place for all the detritus of bachelordom: shitty Ikea furniture, a drum set, a styrofoam snowman, and the Harley he always meant to get running. Gary spots what he was looking for.}

<ACTION>__{Gary drags a beaten Weber kettle. One of its wheels is broken, SCRAPING against the deck. WIDER, we see Gary's house has an incredible view of the city. He couldn't fucking care less. He yanks the circular grill out of the Weber and throws it down the canyon. He empties a garbage bag into the barbecue: mostly women's clothes, but also some stuffed animals and photos still in their frames. There's too much to fit, so he tries stomping it down with a flip-flopped foot. He cracks open a container of lighter fluid and begins drenching everything inside. He sprays until the container is WHEEZING air. He shakes it, making sure it's really empty. Then he cracks open a new container and keeps spraying.   And spraying. We follow the dripping fluid as it runs across a photo of Gary and a BLONDE WOMAN. Her eyes are scratched out, making her unrecognizable. Under the grill, lighter fluid is dripping in a stream, soaking into the wooden deck. Finally satisfied, Gary throws the lighter fluid aside. He takes five steps back and pulls a box of matches from his pocket.}
<LOC>__{EXTREMELY CLOSE as the match SCRAPES, erupting in flames.}
<ACTION>__{On Gary's left wrist, we see a green string bracelet. MUSIC STARTS: a pounding, hypnotic track that will carry us through these MAIN TITLES. In EPIC SLOW-MOTION, we follow the burning match as it sails through the air, tumbling end-over-end. Just as it's about to reach its target, we...}
