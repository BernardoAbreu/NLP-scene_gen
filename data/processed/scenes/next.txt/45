<D>__{i swear, i can't figure you out.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{believe me, the feeling is mutual.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{sometimes you seem mindlessly impulsive. but other times i feel like you're utterly calculating, saying exactly what you think'll push my buttons.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{don't you think it's kind of an amazing coincidence that neither of us can have kids?}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{you want to talk to my doctor? i will get him on the phone. no, really, i mean it. i will have him send you my records. because i want you to trust me.}
<A>__{he seems so sincere that she dismisses her concerns.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{then open up. talk to me. where are you going with your life?}
<A>__{cris seems unprepared for the question.}
<D>__{cris wherever it takes me. liz you never think about the future?}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{all the time. but mainly how to stay out of trouble.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{no goals? dreams? ambitions?}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{there's only one thing i've ever wanted.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{cris}

<C>__{cris}
<D>__{well, i was, as they say, left on a doorstep when i was two.}
<P>__{(makes light of it)}
<D>__{never found foster parents who could put up with me. so to me, a family sounds like plenty.}
<A>__{that certainly pressed her buttons again.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{you've got to be making this up.}
<C>__{cris}
<D>__{i wish.}
<A>__{she rests her head on his shoulder.}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{you poor guy.}

<D>__{i say we get the whole department up here and bust his ass. ferris and by that time, his ass'll be long gone.}
<C>__{cavanaugh}
<D>__{then why won't he see through your trap?}
<A>__{ferris takes a deep breath.}
<D>__{ferris let's try this one more time.}
