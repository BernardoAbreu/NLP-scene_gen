<L>__{interior property room county morgue day}
<A>__{two large plastic packets are dumped of their contents onto a formica counter. sykes looks through the dead alien's effects while jetson goes through the human's. ortiz, the college girl working the property counter, sits nearby doing homework. jetson holds up a little foil packet with a puzzled frown.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{sykes}
<P>__{(looks, then)}
<D>__{a rubber. a condom. you know... coney island whitefish?}
<P>__{(jetson doesn't know what one is)}
<D>__{men, human men, put them on their, uh penises to protect against having babies.}
<P>__{(jetson still doesn't}
<D>__{get it; sykes turns}
<P>__{to ortiz)}
<D>__{you need this for anything?}
<C>__{ortiz}
<D>__{nope, got my own. anything you guys don't use gets stuffed away in storage.}
<A>__{sykes tears open the packet, unrolls the condom, dangles it before jetson.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{get the picture?}
<C>__{jetson}
<P>__{(frowning)}
<D>__{and that fits?}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{well... yeah, it's rubber. it stretches.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{and still it fits?}
<A>__{sykes looks at jetson's serious expression. he tosses the condom and packet back into the counter and continues searching. a beat, then he can't stop himself he steals a glance at jetson's crotch. still searching, sykes picks up one of the dead alien's well worn heavy work boots. he grimaces... the sides and soles are painted with a viscous black substance. he very tentatively sniffs it... and is grateful that it's not what he thought it might be.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{what is this stuff?}
<A>__{sykes gets some on his hands, doesn't know where to wipe it. jetson glances over.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{it is a resin.}
<A>__{sykes looks at him... surprised that he knows.}
<C>__{jetson}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{newcomers working near methane gasses at oil refineries must paint it on their boots to protect against sparks.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{how the hell do you know that?}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{a large number of my people were hired by refineries because the methane fumes are not harmful to us. my spouse's brother is one.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{so the slag they're cutting into upstairs worked at a refinery just like hubley worked at a refinery.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'd say that "possible" connection between the two cases just got a hell of a lot more possible.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{okay, next step i gotta go talk to the wife of the slag store owner blown away last night.}
<C>__{jetson}
<D>__{i believe i should interview the widow alone.}
<C>__{sykes}
<D>__{why the hell ?!}
<P>__{(realizes it's}
<D>__{because of his lack}
<P>__{of "bedside manner")}
<D>__{great, fine. you talk to the wife.}
