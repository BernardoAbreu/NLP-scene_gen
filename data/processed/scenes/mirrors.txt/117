<L>__{interior day midwich monastery vestibule}
<A>__{ben is losing his calm. time is running out. the nun reappears behind the wooden screen }
<C>__{sister}
<D>__{sister anna has agreed to talk to you, you may proceed to the parlor next door.}
<A>__{ben crosses the hall and opens the door that the nun gestures him to. he enters the parlor alone. in the spare room, a chair stands by a wooden screen, fencing him off, once again. behind the screen, a silhouette awaits him.}
<C>__{sister anna}
<D>__{st. john's closed down in 1952. who are you?}
<A>__{ben sits down. even at a short distance he cannot discern the face of anna esseker, who is now sister anna.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{my name is benjamin carson. i work as a night watchman at 1229 west 38th street in new york city, what used to be st. john's hospital.}
<C>__{sister anna}
<D>__{what is it you want mr. carson?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i need your help.}
<C>__{sister anna}
<D>__{my help? i don't quite see how i could possibly be of any help.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{my wife and children are in danger. what is threatening my family is asking for you...}
<A>__{for a split second, ben makes eye contact with anna behind the screen. she has understood...}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{if you don't help me i may lose the only thing that matters to me.}
<C>__{sister anna}
<D>__{i cannot leave the precincts. it's impossible.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{tell me why are the mirrors from the old hospital so determined to find you?}
<A>__{sister anna remains silent }
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{i must know, sister.}
<C>__{sister anna}
<D>__{it is not the wish of the mirrors to find me, but of what is imprisoned inside them. the mirrors are merely windows on our world...}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{a window... for what? for whom?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{at the time that i was at st. john's, dr. kane's therapy for personality disorders consisted of locking the patient up in a mirrored room for several days on end, in order to force him to confront his own image. i spent the darkest days of my life in that room. on the 6th day the nurses found me lifeless, almost dead. since that day, i have never had another fit. but deep down inside i've always known the truth.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what truth?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{there is no cure for schizophrenia, it was something else, mr. carson. and whatever it was, it entered the mirror.}
<A>__{we can feel the emotion in her voice.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{i thought that after fifty years, this would have all gone away. they would have disappeared from the mirrors. i didn't know.... i'm sorry but if i agree to go with you and return to that place, i will make it possible for them to cross the threshold back into the real world.}
<A>__{everything is now making sense for ben }
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{it entered with you and they need you to get out.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{the consequences of such an act, mr. carson, would be more devastating than letting them suffer where they are now. i'm going to pray for you and your family. that's all i can do right now, mr. carson. god bless you...}
<A>__{she stands to leave.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{wait... please, listen to me terence berry, gary lewis and many others before me... those are the people who died trying to find you. because they failed, their families died too. my sister was murdered two days ago... my wife and kids will next if you don't come with me. look }
<A>__{from his wallet ben takes out a wrinkled photograph of michael, as a baby, in amy's arms. daisy stands next to them in the picture. ben presses the photograph against the grating for anna to look at it.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{my wife and two children. they're all i've got. they're innocent... please.}
<A>__{anna stays quiet a moment behind the screen and leaves.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{i know you are scared of going back there. it's easier to keep hiding but this is not the house of god anymore. while you're praying people are dying on your time!}
<A>__{anna doesn't respond and disappears in the distance. ben failed. he's desperate and lost. he has a hard time containing his anger.}
