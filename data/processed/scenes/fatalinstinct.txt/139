<A>__{we see lana's silhouette on the window as she raises the big power screwdriver and turns it on. whirr r r r r r r r r r! the camera whips around and pushes in to...}
<B>__{lola}
<A>__{watching the murder from her car. there is a... flash! then another! and another! we are...}
<L>__{interior the garage later}
<A>__{a police photographer takes flash pictures of the crime scene. the coroner, cops, forensic men... all do their thing. ned and arch amble in, looking around. arch is eating nachos.}
<C>__{forensic man}
<D>__{watch your step, guys. there's a lot of blood.}
<A>__{throughout this scene, in the b.g., the milling cops and investigators slip on all the blood, as if on slick ice, and fall out of frame, their arms and legs flailing helplessly! one of the coroner's investigators approaches arch and ned.}
<C>__{investigator}
<D>__{looks like a suicide. we found a note.}
<A>__{he holds up a rolled piece of paper with a pair of tweezers. ned takes it, trying to unroll it.}
<C>__{investigator}
<D>__{it was stuck up his nose.}
<A>__{ned hands it off to arch, who casually unrolls it. the investigator slips, arms waving, and falls out of frame.}
<C>__{arch}
<P>__{(reading it)}
<D>__{"i can't take it anymore. i'm a mediocre mechanic... and a lousy lover."}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{he's sure got that right.}
<A>__{arch gives ned a very strange look. ned feels his stare.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{the "mechanic" part, i mean.}
<A>__{in the b.g., various cops pair up to have their pictures taken by the police crime scene photographer... posing, grinning.}
<C>__{ned}
<P>__{(stares at the body)}
<D>__{i don't know why, arch, but i just can't shake this crazy hunch it wasn't suicide.}
<B>__{the camera moves}
<A>__{behind ned on his line, revealing frank... pinned to the wall by the power screwdriver stuck in his back! it's still running... vibrating with a grinding hum. ned reaches out and turns the screwdriver off.}
