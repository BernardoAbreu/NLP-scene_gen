<L>__{interior halllway to indoor pool night}
<A>__{rudy creeps down the darkened hall, past a sign that reads "pool closed. open 9 am to 9 pm, no lifeguard on duty." rudy steps closer, back to a wall, standing in shadow. the small pool becomes visible, flickering blue water. from an unseen end, a figure splashes backwards into view it's ashley. hair wet, naked beneath the surface. smiling and splashing someone offscreen }
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{...and he's saying "we're not gonna help him just to walk away. if we're gonna help him... we're gonna get it all...}
<A>__{she splashes again. taunting }
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{...he wants to help now, he wants to rob it now we could probably stay right here, he'd go on and rob it by himself }
<A>__{as gabriel steps into view, also undressed, moving toward her in the pool.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{he wants the money.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{no, baby. he wants me.}
<A>__{gabriel reaches her, puts his arms around her. she smiles.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{he wants... your "sister"...}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{...whoever she is.}
<A>__{and they kiss, entwining together, reflections and ripples. a steamy embrace.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{nick mason's gonna help us more than we ever dreamed.}
<B>__{angle on rudy}
<A>__{in the shadows, hearing them. staring into darkness.}
<B>__{in the pool}
<A>__{gabriel turns with ashley, wrapped together. moving slow.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{all those letters are about to pay off, baby... all those letters...}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{to all those cons...}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{searching for a money man...}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{we musta written what, twenty of 'em? and they were before this guy. one, two letters apiece, ten to the racetrack guy in leavenworth }
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{ till he fucked his parole }
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{ plus the forty to mason... how many letters is that?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{that's a book, baby.}
<P>__{(presses closer)}
<D>__{that's a book of love.}
<A>__{they kiss again. gabriel strokes her wet hair:}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i can't take watching you touch him. i can't take his hands on you.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{one more day, baby. one more day to christmas.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i've been doing good, though.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{didn't have to hit me so fucking hard. didn't have to throw me outta the goddamn truck.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{didn't have to send me down a fucking mountain.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{what, he should see me help you catch him?}
<B>__{on rudy}
<A>__{still in the shadows, welling with betrayal.}
<C>__{ashley }
<D>__{he's shown us the setup, he's drawn us the map, he's helped us do the plan. he wants a gun, give him a gun. take the bullets out, whatever, but give him the gun. the more manpower we've got in there, the better. he won't try and make his move till the money's in hand.}
<C>__{gabriel }
<D>__{he'll be dead when he does.}
<B>__{back in the pool}
<A>__{gabriel and ashley rock slowly, coupled, in the water.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{y'know something, baby? if you were my sister? i'd still want to wake up christmas morning with you...}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{mmm, baby. and i'd still want to be the tinsel round your tree...}
<A>__{and as their words turn to moans and murmurs...}
<B>__{in the shadows}
<A>__{rudy is gone.}
