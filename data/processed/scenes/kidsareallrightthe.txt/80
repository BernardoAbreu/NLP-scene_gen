<C>__{paul}

<C>__{nic}
<D>__{no, it's perfect. juicy. tender. exactly what rare's supposed to be.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{good. a lot of people in the restaurant order a steak rare and they freak out at the slightest sight of red.}
<C>__{nic}
<D>__{ugh, isn't that annoying? that happens to me all the time when i'm grilling.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{don't people know that rare means red?}

<A>__{jules, paul and the kids watch, open mouthed as nic soldiers on, skipping ahead to another verse.}
<C>__{nic }
<D>__{i want to talk to you i want to shampoo you i want to renew you again and again applause, applause life is our cause when i think of your kisses my mind see saws...}
<A>__{nic takes a breath. just as paul's about to say something, nic resumes her unfortunate solo.}
<C>__{nic }
<D>__{do you see do you see do you see how you hu urt me baby so i hurt you too then we both get soo ooo ooo blue...}
<A>__{nic stops, eyes still closed. she's connected to a part of herself she rarely lets herself visit. the moment is punctured by her smart ass 15 year old son.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{don't quit your day job, mom.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{hey. it's hard enough to open your heart in this world. don't make it harder.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{you're right.}
<P>__{(to nic; contrite)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, mom.}
<A>__{nic looks at paul. stunned. then looks at jules and points to paul.}
<C>__{nic}
