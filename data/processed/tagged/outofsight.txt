<C>__{foley}
<D>__{loretta, you see that guy talking to your manager, has his case open?}

<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i'm looking at him, for christ's sake!}
<A>__{okay now foley raises the metal cross, steps in and lays it smack against the side of pup's head. drops him clean with one swing, bouncing him off the window frame and down without a sound coming from him.}

<A>__{as karen grabs the court papers off the seat, opens her car door, glances at the fence and pauses as she sees a figure there, crouching down. karen turns on her headlights. no, not crouched. the guy is coming out of the ground . on this side of the fence. head and shoulders appear and another guy comes out of the ground. right in front of her. karen leans on the horn, holds it down and sees the two guys by the fence chino and lulu look into her headlights, poised there for a moment before taking off into the dark. karen gets out of the car...}
<L>__{interior buddy's car same}
<A>__{as buddy watches a spotlight from the tower come on and follow the two cons as we then hear the sound of rifle reports before the men disappear into the dark. then buddy sees karen in his headlights, whistles softly as he gets a good look at her long legs as she raises the lid to her trunk...}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{what's she doing?}
<A>__{he watches her duck her head in the trunk and come out with a holstered pistol.}
<C>__{buddy }
<D>__{uh oh.}
<A>__{but then she throws the pistol in the trunk, ducks in there again and comes out this time racking a shotgun.}
<C>__{buddy }
<D>__{uh oh .}
<A>__{and now buddy watches her hurry to the front of her car and raise the shotgun as we hear a whistle blow in the compound. buddy gets out of the car...}

<A>__{as karen puts the shotgun on two more cons, both filthy dirty, standing by the hole they just crawled out of.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{get your hands in the air!}
<A>__{buddy watches the two cons, both latins, make up their minds, start edging away shit, they've come this far. they look out at the spotlight sweeping around in the dark, then look the other way, along the fence towards the main gate, to see armed hacks coming out on the run, and that decides it for the cons. they take off running... now buddy watches as karen puts her pump gun on them, but doesn't fire... the hacks running from the gate with rifles beat her to it, open up all at once and keep firing until the two convicts are cut down as they run. the hacks glance at karen, but don't bother with her, more interested in the hole the convicts had come out of. now they're standing by it peering in, edging closer with their weapons ready, then they all step back at once, bump into each other as... a head appears wearing a guard's baseball cap, the guy now saying something to the guards, his face smeared with muck, excited, pointing towards the orange grove. they run off, pausing briefly to kick the convicts they shot to see if they're alive, then keep going. the man in the hole, foley, climbs out. he takes his time, puts on a show, standing with his hands on his hips like an honest to god hack, that serious cap down on his eyes. buddy waves to foley to come on and karen turns and puts the shotgun on buddy. buddy raises the palm of his hand.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{it's okay, honey, we're good guys.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what're you doing here?}
<A>__{not so much asking, but putting it to him the way cops do when they're already pretty sure what you're doing. she glances around to include foley, now coming at her like some creature out of the swamp, giving buddy time to take her around the neck. she fights him, jabs him in the gut with the butt end of the shotgun before foley wrenches it from her grip. they drag her to the rear end of her car, the trunk lid still up, and crouch there as some hacks come running along the fence, past the dark gun tower and cross the road towards the orange grove. a moment later, they hear bursts of gunfire, then silence.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i bet that's all the hacks they send out. otherwise nobody's left to mind the store.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{why don't we talk about it later?}
<A>__{he turns to see foley and karen staring at each other in the headlights from buddy's car; karen not at all afraid.}

<D>__{why you're just a girl. what do you do for a living you pack a shotgun?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest, both of you guys.}

<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{listen, you hop in the trunk and we'll get out of here.}
<A>__{karen looks at him, then gets up, climbs into the trunk. she's reaching around, trying to find her pistol, when... foley gives her a shove and gets in with her, wedging her against the wall of the trunk, pressing against her back like they're cuddled up in bed. he holds her to him, giving her no room to turn and stick the gun in his face. buddy reaches for the trunk lid and then everything goes...}

<D>__{if i could have a little more room.}
<C>__{foley }
<D>__{there isn't any. all this shit you got in here. what is all this stuff anyway? handcuffs, chains... what's this can?}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{for your breath. you could use it. squirt some in your mouth.}
<C>__{foley }
<D>__{you devil, it's mace, huh? what've you got here, a billy? use it on poor unfortunate offenders.}
<A>__{a beam of light appears as he finds a flashlight and turns it on. he plays the beam along karen's leg, calms down some as he looks at all of her now and finally says...}
<C>__{foley }
<D>__{where's your gun, your pistol?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{in my bag, in the car.}
<A>__{they go over some bumps. we hear men's voices from somewhere far off, outside.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{you know you don't have a chance of making it. guards are out here already, they'll stop the car.}
<A>__{he runs his hand down her thigh, looking for her gun, but also, just, well, looking.}

<C>__{karen}
<D>__{the idea of going after guys like you appealed to me.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{guys like me, huh. well, listen, even though i've been celibate lately, i'm not gonna force myself on you. i've never done that in my life.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you wouldn't have time anyway. we come to a roadblock, they'll run the car, find out in five seconds who it belongs to.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{if they get set up in time, which i doubt. and even if they do they'll be looking for a buncha little latin fellas, not a big black guy driving a ford.}

<C>__{karen}
<D>__{how many was that?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{tell you the truth, i don't know. i started when i was eighteen, driving for my uncle cully and his partner, gus. they go into a bank this one time in slidell, gus jumps the counter to get the tellers and breaks his leg. all three of us ended up in angola.}
<C>__{karen}

<D>__{you must see yourself as some kind of clyde barrow.}
<A>__{and for a few moments, all we hear is the sound of the car on the road. then...}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{oh, you mean of bonnie and clyde? hm. you ever see pictures of him, the way he wore his hat? you could tell he had that don't give a shit air about him.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i don't recall his hat, but i've seen pictures of him lying dead, shot by texas rangers. did you know he didn't have his shoes on?}

<D>__{we may as well leave her, we're leaving the car and we gotta leave her some place anyway, what's the difference where?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{she's coming with us.}

<D>__{we went out there, full swat, two choppers, the whole bit, but linares started shooting anyway. we put him down, but somehow chirino got away.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{did you pay the guy the reward?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yeah, as soon as we got back.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{foley hadn't been there?}
<A>__{her father gives her a look.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{this place was strictly cuban. if foley had a ride he must have his own agenda. he seems to be the only one knows what he's doing.}
<A>__{the phone rings. marshall moves to it.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{hello?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{yeah, she is. just a minute.}

<D>__{hello?}

<C>__{foley}
<D>__{hi.}
<L>__{intercutting karen & foley day}
<A>__{karen just stands there, sees her father looking at her as ray drones on.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{you know who this is?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{she walks out to her father's balcony now.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i just wanted to see if you're okay, make sure glenn didn't hurt you or, you know, anything.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{something i've been wondering, ray...}
<A>__{marshall picks up the newspaper...}
<C>__{marshall }
<D>__{it says in the headline, "i slept with a murderer, says shaken miami woman." she lives in little havana, her husband's out of town working when one of the escapees shows up at her door...}
<A>__{she closes the glass door, so that they won't hear her.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{how'd you get this number?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{who was it answered the phone?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{none of your business.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i'm just worried maybe i'm not old enough for you.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{that's my dad.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{really. he has a cop's face.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{how do you know? wait you have my wallet.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{and your gun.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{think i could have them back?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{how do we do that?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{let's see. you could come on by my dad's place, drop 'em off.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{sure. i will just leave 'em with the s.w.a.t. guy answers the door.}
<A>__{foley stops flipping through the magazine, stares at what he's been looking for: an ad for defiance perfume.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{there's a guy here on the task force right now. maybe i should put him on the phone, let you two work it out.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{you won't do that.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{because you're having too much fun.}
<A>__{she doesn't know what to say to that. foley smells the ad.}
<B>__{inside the house}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{...she fixes him pork chops and rice, the next thing you know they're making love on the sofa. she says he was very gentle.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i spoke to her. the guy told her he missed his little girl and she felt sorry for him.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{that's how you score now?}
<T>__{on the patio:}
<A>__{karen looks inside at her father talking with ray nicolet.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{my dad's retired. he was a private investigator. forty years. i used to work for him.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i can just picture that, a cute girl like you following slip and fall and whiplash cheaters.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{something i've been wondering, what ever happened to your uncle cully?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{why? you think he might tell you where i am?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{unless you wanna tell me.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{he's dead. he did twenty seven years before he came out and died not too long after in charity hospital, i think trying to make up for all the good times he'd missed.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{that's not gonna be me.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{one last score, that the idea? move to some island.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i'm partial to mountains myself. but if you like islands, we'll make it an island.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{whatta you mean we'll make it an island?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i just thought maybe you and me could }
<A>__{buddy opens the door, sticks his head out, startles foley.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{who you talking to?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{is that buddy?}
<A>__{foley's caught off guard, hangs up the phone. he looks at buddy.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{you better come see this.}
<L>__{interior marshall's condo day}
<A>__{as karen stands on the balcony another moment, then hangs up, opens the sliding door and walks back into the living room.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{the woman also said he stole her husband's gun, a twenty two pistol, and some of his clothes.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{so the woman's married. she goes to bed with this prison escapee because he misses his little girl and then tells the world about it. but you don't reveal her name, you protect her. it sounds like you're saying it's okay as long as her husband doesn't find out about it. like the guy who cheats on his wife, saying what she doesn't know won't hurt her.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{dad.}
<A>__{he looks over at her now. gives her an innocent look.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{what?}
<L>__{interior buddy's apartment day}
<A>__{as foley and buddy watch a news report on the earlier events at the hobo camp. we catch a glimpse of ray nicolet, gun in his waistband, sticking his chest out for the camera. foley shakes his head as they show a shot of lulu's body covered with a sheet.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{chino's gonna wanna talk to me.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{he's running for his life, he doesn't give a shit about you.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{he's gotta know by now that i gave him up back at glades. he does, he's gonna try to find me. maybe go see adele, see what she knows.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{he knows where she lives?}
<A>__{foley doesn't answer. buddy mutes the set. turns to foley.}
<C>__{buddy }
<D>__{jack?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{we were talking one time, drinking rum. i may've mentioned adele, how she worked for a magician. chino got interested. he's like, yeah? how does he saw the woman in half? he wanted to meet her. or get a look at her if she ever came to visit.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{so call her up. tell her don't talk to any cubans.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{her phone's probably tapped.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{and you know they're gonna have some people watching the hotel.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{shit.}
<L>__{exterior marshall sisco's boat day}
<A>__{karen stands there with her car keys and purse as marshall paints the trim on the boat.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{remember, pay attention to how she talks about foley, her tone. do it right, she'll tell you things she wouldn't tell burdon. tell her you think he's a nice guy. no, first tell her about being in the trunk with him, in the dark for half an hour, and see how she takes it. if she's in on it, what does she get for all the aggravation; cops breathing on her? i bet nothing. so she still likes him enough to stick her neck out. you think that's possible? what kind of guy is he?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{he's pretty laid back, confident.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{he remind you of that guy, tillman?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{not at all.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{but you know he's dirty and you still wanna see him again.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i want to bust his ass, put him in shackles.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{maybe. but you're also curious about the man. twice last night you asked your married boyfriend nicolet about him. you were concerned, but you didn't want to show it.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{my married boyfriend setting him up with that news story so you could talk about infidelity. i couldn't believe it.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{you like the wild ones, don't you? tillman, nicolet and now foley. you know, i've always said there's a thin line between the cowboy cops and the armed robbers, all those guys that love to pack.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{foley kid napped me.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{yeah, but you talked all the way from gci to the turnpike. it sounds more like a first date than a kidnapping.}
<A>__{she gives him a look. he goes back to his painting.}
<C>__{marshall }
<D>__{go talk to the ex wife.}
<L>__{interior adele delisi's apartment day}
<A>__{as adele comes in, drops a stack of her cards on the glass topped dining table and turns on the window air conditioner when the phone rings. she grabs it...}

<D>__{hi, this is adele speaking.}
<L>__{exterior payphone day}
<A>__{adele's neighbourhood. near the beach. chino on the phone. he wears a painter's cap and a white jumpsuit...}
<C>__{chino}
<D>__{oh, is this adele?}
<C>__{adele }
<D>__{yes, it is.}
<C>__{chino}
<D>__{uh sorry. wrong number.}
<A>__{he hangs up, glances about, then checks the little .22 stuck in one of his pockets. as he then starts off down the street, we can see the name "color my world housepainting" on the back of the jumpsuit.}
<L>__{interior buddy's car day}
<A>__{buddy drives. foley in a bright orange and ochre beach outfit is beside him. buddy looks at him, shakes his head.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{nice disguise.}

<D>__{i'm a tourist.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{you at least bring the gun?}

<P>__{(lifts straw bag)}
<D>__{in here with my suntan lotion and beach towel.}
<P>__{(points)}
<D>__{that's her place.}
<A>__{as they drive past, buddy indicates a man on the steps out front, obviously fbi...}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{there. you see the guy sitting on the porch? the old ladies and one guy? you know they'll have a couple more in a car somewhere.}
<C>__{foley}
<P>__{(watching something else)}
<D>__{uh huh...}
<A>__{buddy follows foley's gaze to...}
<B>__{across the street}
<A>__{as a car door opens and karen sisco gets out, rifles her purse for change. she drops a quarter, foley now watching as she bends down to grab it, her skirt hiking way up her thigh...}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{oh, my.}
<A>__{foley watches, her hair in her face as she tries to reach under the car and grab it.}
<C>__{buddy }
<D>__{okay, you saw her. that's all you get.}
<A>__{they watch as she walks to the normandie and shows the young agent her id...}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i guess adele's in good hands.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{sure looks that way.}

<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{let's go to detroit.}
<C>__{buddy}
<D>__{now you're talkin'.}
<L>__{interior hallway outside adele's apartment day}
<A>__{adele has the chain on the door, talks to karen through the narrow opening.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{you were both in the trunk? together?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{from glades to the turnpike. then i left with glenn.}
<A>__{karen watches adele's face in the opening, freshly made up, heavy on the eye shadow and lip gloss.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{the fbi didn't tell you i was with them?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{they didn't tell me anything, they asked questions.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{but you know what i'm talking about, don't you? about glenn, don't you, and the second car?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{i know a glenn.}
<A>__{she thinks a moment. the door closes and opens again, all the way. adele stands there in a robe, hanging partly open, panties, but no bra.}
<C>__{adele }
<D>__{i'm getting ready to go out. you can come in if you want, sit down for a minute. would you like a diet coke?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{no, thanks.}
<A>__{she comes in, checks out the place. she turns a chair from the glasstop table and sits down as adele comes out of the kitchenette with a diet coke and packet of cigarettes.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{those are cute shoes. the kind of jobs i get, i have to wear these killer spikes, they ruin your feet.}
<A>__{she walks away, comes back with an ashtray.}
<C>__{adele }
<D>__{when you were in the trunk with jack...}
<A>__{karen waits, watches her light her cigarette.}
<C>__{adele }
<D>__{he didn't hurt you or anything, did he?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you mean, did he try to jump me? no, but he was kind of talkative.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{he gets that way when he's nervous sometimes.}
<A>__{adele sits down at the other end of the table.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you didn't visit him in prison.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{he didn't want me to.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{i don't know. he was different after he was sentenced, looking at thirty years. said it depressed him every time the younger cons called him an old timer.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{but you spoke to him on the phone.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{he'd call every once in a while.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{he called the day he escaped.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{he did? i don't remember. did he say about me? in the trunk?}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(beat, lies)}
<D>__{he said he wished the two of you could start over, live a normal life.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{huh. problem is, jack's idea of a normal life is robbing banks. it's all he's ever done.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{did you know that when you married him?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{he said he was a card player. i could live with that. i never knew he robbed banks till he got busted with that car that caught fire if you can imagine something like that happening, comes out of the bank and the car's on fire. i did go see him in jail to tell him i was filing for divorce. he said, "okay." jack's so easy going.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{he was fun, but never what you'd call a real husband.}
<A>__{adele looks out the window. karen waits, looks to an end table where she sees a photograph of jack and adele on a boat somewhere ten years back.}
<C>__{adele }
<D>__{i will say one thing for jack, he was never ugly or mean, or drank too much. he was very considerate, lights on or off, if you know what i mean.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{really.}
<P>__{(looking at the picture)}
<D>__{hm.}
<A>__{she realizes adele is looking at her.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{adele, sooner or later, he's gonna get caught. i'd like to get him before he does something else, makes it worse on himself.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{buddy'll take care of him. keep him out've trouble. he's jack's conscience. always has been.}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{he tell you how they met?}
<A>__{karen shakes her head.}
<C>__{adele }
<D>__{jack came out of a bank he just robbed in pasadena, couldn't get his stolen car to start. battery was dead. he looks over, sees buddy sitting in a burgundy bonneville, goes up, offers him a thousand dollars for a jump. turns out, buddy was casing the same bank and saw the whole thing. buddy says, i will take the thousand, but we're leaving in my car, not that piece of shit you come in.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{they musta robbed fifty banks together.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{till they got busted.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{that wasn't jack's fault. no, that was on account of buddy, for some reason, decided to call his sister and confess to a job before they'd done it instead of after. she called the fbi and they both went down, ended up at lompoc.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i think buddy felt kinda bad about that.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{any idea where i could find buddy? or glenn?}
<A>__{adele looks at karen, then jumps at the sound of three quick raps on the door.}
<C>__{chino's voice}
<D>__{adele? you in there?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{chino}
<D>__{i want to speak with you, please.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{who is it?}
<C>__{chino's voice}
<D>__{i talk to the guy you work for, emil. he tole me your number and where you live. see, i'm looking for an assistant and would like to speak to you.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{oh. uh huh.}
<C>__{chino's voice}
<D>__{you did work for emil, right?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{yeah, i was emil's box jumper for almost four years.}
<C>__{chino's voice}
<D>__{you were his what, his box?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{his assistant.}
<A>__{karen looks at the door. something's wrong... through the glass bricks that line one side of the door, we see blurred movement on the other side, someone doing something ...}
<C>__{adele }
<D>__{you say you perform in the miami area?}
<C>__{chino's voice}
<D>__{yes, around here. i was a mayishan in cuba before i come here. manuel the mayishan was my name.}
<A>__{and now karen and adele look at each other.}
<C>__{chino's voice }
<D>__{can you open the door?}
<A>__{karen shakes her head "no."}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{i'm not dressed.}
<C>__{chino's voice}
<D>__{listen to me.}
<P>__{(lowers his voice)}
<D>__{i'm a good friend of jack foley.}
<A>__{boom. karen gets to her feet, brings her bag to the edge of the table, sees adele staring at her.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{ask him his name.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{chino's voice}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{jose chirino.}
<A>__{karen brings her beretta out of the bag.}
<C>__{chino's voice }
<D>__{or maybe you hear jack foley call me chino. i'm the same person.}
<A>__{karen moves along the table to adele...}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{tell him to wait in the hall, you have to get dressed. say it loud.}
<A>__{as adele speaks, karen racks the slide on her 9mm.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{wait in the hall! i have to get dressed!}
<C>__{chino's voice}
<D>__{tell me where is jack foley, i don't bother you no more.}
<A>__{karen motions for adele to keep talking as she takes a position beside the door, where we now see chino's silhouette in one of the three glass panels in the centre of the door.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{i don't know where he is.}
<C>__{chino's voice}
<D>__{listen, i'm the one help jack escape from prison. he tole me, i can't find him to see you. so why don't you open this fucking door. okay? so we can speak.}
<C>__{adele}
<P>__{(staring at karen)}
<D>__{go away, or i will call the police.}
<C>__{chino's voice}
<D>__{why you want to do that, to a frien'?}
<A>__{adele says nothing. then...}
<C>__{chino's voice }
<D>__{okay, you don't want to help me, i'm leaving.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{i'm going now. i see you maybe some time, okay? bye bye.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(low)}
<D>__{go in the bedroom and }
<A>__{suddenly, chino's fist wrapped in his shirt explodes through one of the glass panels. adele and karen both jump as chino pushes his arm through, reaches for the door knob... ...but karen grabs the knob first and, using all of her weight as leverage, pivots and flings the door open with chino's arm still sticking through the glass... ...the force of which slingshots the man into the room where he bangs against a wall and falls to the floor. dazed, chino reaches for his .22 as he now tries to get to his feet. karen brings up her beretta in two hands, cocks it and puts the front sight on his chest.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{leave it where it is.}
<C>__{chino}
<P>__{(frowning)}
<D>__{wait. you not adele?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i'm a federal marshal and you're under arrest. put the gun on the table. i mean, now.}
<C>__{chino}
<D>__{oh. then this must be adele...}
<A>__{he now aims the gun point blank at adele.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{put it down or i will shoot.}
<C>__{chino}
<D>__{you wouldn't shoot me, would you?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what do you want to bet?}
<C>__{chino}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i could walk out of here.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{if you move, if you look at her again, you're dead.}
<A>__{chino doesn't move. keeps his gun on adele. karen starts walking towards him...}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{you can live or die, it's up to you.}
<C>__{chino}
<D>__{oh, is that right? you going to shoot me? nice girl like you?}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you don't, huh?}
<A>__{and with that, she kicks him in the knee. chino buckles over and she hits him on the side of the head with her gun...}
<C>__{adele }
<D>__{on your knees.}
<A>__{he does as he's told. karen raises his jacket, feels around his waist from behind.}
<C>__{adele }
<D>__{lie face down on the floor.}
<C>__{chino}
<P>__{(hurting)}
<D>__{what?!}
<A>__{she kicks him over onto his stomach and stays there. she puts her foot to his back as she reaches for the phone, dials. she sees adele staring at her.}
<C>__{chino }
<P>__{(to adele)}
<D>__{excuse me...}
<A>__{karen looks at adele a moment, then says into the phone...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{daniel burdon, please. karen sisco.}
<C>__{chino}
<D>__{excuse me, adele?}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{yes.}

<D>__{you do the sawing of the box in half trick with you inside?}
<C>__{adele}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{chino}
<D>__{tell me, how do you do that?}
<A>__{adele looks at karen, who shoves chino's head to the floor with her foot.}

<D>__{what we already talked to her. that's a dead end.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(looking at chino)}
<D>__{yeah, i know. i was just leaving. why were you trying to reach me?}
<C>__{burdon }
<D>__{there was a buddy bragg at lompoc around the same time foley was there. we got an address for him at the adams hotel in hallandale. i want you to go there, see if you can get the manager to i.d. him as the other guy. if he does, you call me right away...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{all right, but...}

<C>__{burdon }
<D>__{now. what is it you wanted to tell me?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{oh, i was just wondering, if i were to bring in chirino, would you put me on the task force?}

<D>__{i have a hunch you're the new sales rep and your customer isn't exactly knocked out by the idea of a young lady, even one as stunning as you, handling the account. am i close? hi, i'm andy.}
<A>__{she says nothing to him.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{we're ad guys. we flew in from new york this morning to pitch hiram walker distillery, present this test market campaign for their new margarita mix. what we do, we show this guy who looks like a mexican bandido, you know, with the big chihuahua hat, the bullet belts }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{andy? really. who gives a shit?}
<A>__{he gives her a sympathetic expression.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{want to tell me what happened?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{beat it, will you?}
<A>__{she stares at the guy until he turns away. she sips her drink, stares once more out at the blizzard. after a few moments, another dark suit appears, reflected in the window.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{can i buy you a drink?}
<A>__{boom. not one of the executive guys. she stares at the reflection for a moment, then slowly turns, looks up at jack foley now standing there in his new navy blue suit.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{yeah, i'd love one.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{would you like to sit down?}
<A>__{he pulls the chair out, looking at her. the three guys at the other table now staring as he sits down. foley offers his hand...}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i'm gary.}
<A>__{she hesitates, then shakes his hand...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i'm celeste.}
<A>__{she smiles with him. when she lowers her hand to the table, his hand comes down to cover hers. she watches his expression as she brings her hand out slowly, his eyes not leaving hers, and lays her hand on his. the tips of her fingers brush his knuckles, lightly back and forth.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{it takes hours to get a drink around here. there's only one waitress.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i can go to the bar.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{don't leave me.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{those guys bother you?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{no, they're all right. i meant, you just got here.}
<A>__{she picks up her drink and places it in front of him.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{help yourself.}
<A>__{she watches him take a sip, smack his lips.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{you like bourbon?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{love it.}
<C>__{foley}
<P>__{(passes the glass back)}
<D>__{well, we got that out of the way.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{tell me, celeste. what do you do for a living?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i'm a sales rep. i came here to call on a customer and they gave me a hard time because i'm a girl.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{is that how you think of yourself?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what, as a sales rep?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{a girl.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i don't have a problem with it.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i like your hair. and that suit.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i had one just like it well, it was the same idea, but i had to get rid of it.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{you did?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{it smelled.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{having it cleaned didn't help, huh?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{what do you do for a living, gary?}
<C>__{foley}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{how far do we go with this?}
<A>__{this stops her, throws her off balance.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{not yet. don't say anything yet. okay?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i don't think it works if we're somebody else. you know what i mean? gary and celeste, jesus, what do they know about anything?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{it's your game. i've never played this before.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{it's not a game. something you play.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{well, does it make sense to you?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{it doesn't have to, it's something that happens. it's like seeing a person you never saw before you could be passing on the street you look at each other and for a few seconds, there's a kind of recognition. like you both know something. but then the next moment the person's gone, and it's too late to do anything about it, but you remember it because it was right there and you let it go, and you think, "what if i had stopped and said something?" it might happen only a few times in your life.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{or once.}
<A>__{they look at each other a moment, then...}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{why don't we get out of here.}
<A>__{they both get up. the ad guys at the table watch as she follows foley to the elevator. karen winks at them.}
<L>__{interior elevator night}
<A>__{as they ride down to karen's room. she looks at him, looks away. the doors open and they exit.}
<L>__{interior her hotel suite}
<A>__{as he follows her in. she walks to the bar, fixes them each a drink. he checks out the room, takes in her view.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{how'd you find me?}
<A>__{he comes over to her, takes out the newspaper clipping with her picture and shows it to her.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{oh, god...}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i called your room from downstairs.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{if i had answered, what were you gonna say?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{well, i'd say who i was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{if i remembered you. i came looking for you. i would've said sure, let's do it. but for all you knew i could show up with a swat team. why would you trust me?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{it would be worth the risk.}
<A>__{she looks at him, touches his face with her hand...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you like taking risks.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{so do you.}
<A>__{he kisses her now, puts his arms around her.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what's the hurry, jack? you have to be somewhere?}
<A>__{she hands him his drink. they both drink, then...}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{sooner or later...}
<A>__{she stops and he looks at her over the rim of her glass.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{you really wear that suit.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{that's not what you were about to say.}
<A>__{she shrugs, lets it go. he puts down his drink, kisses her. she lets him, then moves to the couch.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{remember how talkative you were? in the trunk? adele said you do that when you're nervous.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{she did, huh.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you kept touching me, feeling my thigh.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{yeah, but in a nice way.}
<A>__{he sits down and they kiss again. this time she peels his jacket off. he does the same with hers. he's starting to unbutton her blouse when }
<C>__{foley }
<P>__{(unbuttoning)}
<D>__{i might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell i was a gentleman. they say john dillinger was a pretty nice guy.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{he killed a police officer.}
<A>__{he stops. looks at her.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i hear he didn't mean to. the cop fell as dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you believe that?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{why not?}
<A>__{she looks at him, decides to get off this subject. anyway he's finished unbuttoning her blouse and is now putting his hands inside her shirt. she closes her eyes.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you know that sig .380 you took was my favourite. my father gave it to me.}
<A>__{as he kisses her on the neck.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{what were you gonna do with me?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i don't know. i hadn't worked that part out yet. all i knew was that i liked you, and i didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you waved to me in the elevator.}
<A>__{she's loosening his tie, unbuttoning his shirt.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i wasn't sure you caught that.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i couldn't believe it. i was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet. like if we could take a time out...}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{really? i was thinking the same thing. if we could call time and get together for a while.}
<A>__{they look at each other a moment.}
<C>__{foley }
<D>__{you know i saw you on the street.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{outside adele's.}
<A>__{he starts to kiss her again, but }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you were going to see her?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{to warn her about chino.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{so she did help you?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i don't think we should get into that.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{no, you're right. or buddy. i won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in detroit. or if you've run into glenn michaels yet.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{don't talk like that, okay? you scare me.}
<A>__{and he moves to kiss her, but she stands up, holds out her hand.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{he gets up and she leads him across the room...}
<L>__{interior bedroom same}
<A>__{jack sits on the bed to take off his shoes, stands up to take off his pants.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{are you gonna leave your tie on?}
<A>__{he looks at her, down to her bra and panties, watches as she gets out of the rest of her clothes and comes over to him, standing close to help him with the tie...}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{my god, look at you.}
<A>__{when her clothes are off, she loops the tie around his neck again and then as she turns off the light... she kisses him. he sits down on the bed, drawing her back with him, the only light now coming from the sitting room.}
<C>__{foley }
<D>__{you having fun?}
<A>__{she smiles and then they start to make love as we then...}

<C>__{karen}

<C>__{foley}
<D>__{why are you mad?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{or i did it for some kind of kinky thrill. score with a bank robber the way some women go for rough trade.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{what about my motive? now i can say i fucked a us marshal. you think i will?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{he raises the covers, but she just stands there.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i know of a guy he goes in the bank holding a bottle he says is nitroglycerin. he scores some cash off a teller, he's on his way out when he drops the bottle. it shatters on the tile floor, he slips in the stuff, cracks his head and they've got him. the nitro was canola oil. i know more fucked up bank robbers than ones that know what they're doing. i doubt one in ten can tell a dye pack when he sees one. most bank robbers are fucking morons. to go to bed with a bank robber for kinky thrills, as you say, you'd have to be as dumb as they are. i know you're not dumb, so why would i think that? why would you think i might think that?}
<A>__{she comes over and sits down on the bed.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you're not dumb.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i don't know about that. you can't do three falls and think you have much of a brain.}
