<A>__{mills stands with the blase dr. beardsley, who reviews a medical chart on a clipboard. zero lies inside an oxygen tent with tubes running into him. the room is dark.}
<C>__{beardsley}
<D>__{a year of immobility seems about right, judging by the deterioration of the muscles and spinal cord. blood tests show a whole smorgasbord of drugs in his system. heroin... crack... even an antibiotic which was administered to keep the bed sores from infecting.}
<A>__{mills looks into the oxygen.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{he hasn't said anything, or tried to express himself in any way?}
<C>__{beardsley}
<D>__{even if his brain were not mush, which it is... he chewed his own tongue off a long time ago.}
<A>__{mills winces, moves away from the bed.}
<C>__{mills}
<D>__{there's no way he'll survive?}
<C>__{beardsley}
<D>__{detective, he'd die right now of shock if you were to shine a flashlight in his eyes.}
