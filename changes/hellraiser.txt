<LOC>__{1    TITLE SEQUENCE}
<ACTION>__{In darkness, a blood-curdling cacophony:  the squeal of unoiled winches, the rasp of hooks and razors being sharpened; and worse, the howl of tormented souls.  Above this din one particular victim yells for mercy - a mixture of tears and roars of rage. By degrees his incoherent pleas are drowned out by the surrounding tumult, until without warning his voice pierces the confusion afresh - this time reduced to naked scream. And with the sound, an image. A house:  NUMBER 55, LODOVICO STREET, an old, three storey, late Victorian house, with gaunt trees lining its overgrown garden.  Its curtains are drawn, there is newspaper over its top window.  The titles begin to run, as we approach the house down the driveway. We move inside, to the hallway.  The cries are louder now. Room by room, we explore the empty house, while the titles continue to run.  It has been left empty for many years, though much of its furniture remains, covered in dust-sheets.  On the mantelpiece of one room, a plaster saint.  In the kitchen, evidence of life here.  Opened tins; bread; bottles of spirits; a glass. We move upstairs, gliding along the corridor of the lower landing.  The din is furious now.  On the floor of one room, a makeshift bed: blankets strewn; an open suitcase; more liquor. We move up a flight and approach a room off the upper landing, the door of which is ajar.  The light within swings backwards and forwards, spilling into the passageway. As we reach the door, the screams from within halt abruptly. We can hear a bell now, which has been pealing steadily throughout this opening sequence. As we move through the door, the titles end.}
<LOC>__{INT.   TORTURE ROOM   NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The bare bulbs in the room we've entered swing violently, disorienting us.  There are chains - dozens of them - disappearing with the darkness of the ceiling: all are swinging back and forth.  Some end in hooks, with pieces of skin and sinew adhering; some are serrated, others simply drip blood. The bell tolls on. On the blood-spattered floor, a box, some six inches square, which resembles an elaborate Chinese puzzle box.  Later, we'll learn its name and function. It's called the Lament Configuration, and it's a way to raise Hell.  LITERALLY. For now, it remains an enigma. A hand, its flesh systematically pierced with needles, reaches down and picks the box up. In close up we see just what an elaborate construction it is, made up of sliding panels and mysterious chambers.  It is open at present, its polished innards exposed.  Out of it, a banal melody, played on a hidden mechanism.  The hands, which belong to one of the demons - a CENOBITE - move over the box.}

<DIAL>__{It's over ...}
<ACTION>__{Delicately, the hands begin to reconstruct the box, sliding the well-oiled parts back into place, the tune simplifying with each manoeuvre. The room is getting darker.  The chains are disappearing into the gloom. We see tantalizing glimpses of other figures, turning from the light and fading into the darkness.  We catch sight of monstrous faces, but only for the briefest of moments.  Then they're gone. The box is almost returned to its unopened condition. The last sounds to fade are the tune from the box, and the bell. It tolls on as the final panel of the box is slid into place. The light stops swinging. The panel clicks.  The tune stops. At last, a long shot of the room.  At the far end the window is covered with yellowed newspapers.  There is dust settling through the air. Otherwise it is empty. The bell fades. It's as if nothing ever happened here. Except ... Somewhere, very quietly, a creaking that could be the sound of floorboards, or the low, agonized gasp of a thing barely alive.}

<ACTION>__{We see the pair on the doorstep.  LARRY is an American in his early forties, an attractive man who has lost his edge in recent years.  He looks harassed; he smirks too much.  A little, but significant, corner of him is utterly defeated.  JULIA, his wife, is English: and looks perhaps ten years his junior.  She is beautiful, but her face betrays a barely buried unhappiness.  Life has disappointed her too, of late: and LARRY has been a major part of their disappointment.}

Besides clothes there's a lot else that speaks of its owner: bric-a-brac picked up in a lifetime of adventuring; handful of bullets; Fragments of an erotic statue; coins and notes from a dozen countries.  Amongst the stuff, some photographs. LARRY peers at them.  One pictures a good-looking intense man in his mid to late thirties, in bed with a naked Chinese girl.}

She lights the cigarette, draws on it, and as she does so she seems to make up her mind that she's not the equal of it.

She starts towards the sobbing child, bare feet on the impacted earth of the passageway. The sobbing gets louder as she advances, her form disappearing entirely as she passes through the intermittent darkness. Once, she glances back towards the Hospital Room, to reassure herself that it's still there.  It is, though it's no more than a sliver of light at the far end of the passageway. She advances a few more paces.  The atmosphere is growing denser; smoke thickens the air. Then, a light glows at the other end of the corridor. The sound of the sobbing child ceases. She stops walking. Ahead, the smoke clears and the light brightens, and we see a creature - THE ENGINEER - hanging in the space between the walls.  It is in silhouette against the light, but we can see enough to know that it resembles no earthly animal.  Its vast black limbs hold it suspended above the corridor, clinging to the stone. Its front limbs, vestigial by comparison, hang down from beneath its vast head.  Its tail is curled over its back. KIRSTY's expression registers this horror.  THE ENGINEER moves into the light.  Its irises narrow to slits. From the tail a vast sting, oozing pus - like venom, glides into view. And then - - it comes at her, advancing along the corridor by bracing its legs against the walls.  Its breath is a growl in its belly, until it moves into darkness, when all sound from it ceases, only to erupt  again as it finds the light. KIRSTY turns, and starts to run. It comes after her at speed.   Darkness, light, darkness, light; roars and silence - Its jaws spill its thick saliva; its eyes gleam. KIRSTY runs blindly down the corridor, back towards the safety of the Hospital Room.   But it's very close on her heels, lingering - As she comes within a few yards of the Room it closes on her.}

Standing across the room from her, lit by a strange phosphorescence that has no visible source, are four extraordinary figures. They are CENOBITES.   Each of them is horribly mutilated by systems of hooks and pins.  The garments they wear are elaborately constructed to marry with their flesh, laced through skin in places, hooked into bone. The leader of this quartet has pins driven into his head at inch intervals.  At his side, a woman whose neck is pinned open like a vivisection specimen.  Accompanying them is a creature whose mouth is wired into a gaping rectangle - the exposed teeth sharpened to points, and a fat sweating monster whose eyes are covered by dark glasses. When the lead CENOBITE speaks, we recognise the voice as that of the creature from the beginning of the film. KIRSTY stares in amazement.}
