(one photo is of annie's father martin. a british ambassador with his young daughter on his lap, her arms affectionately around his neck. her mother stands right behind them, posing like a member of the royal family.) annie sits and takes a breath. the only photo on her desk is a family portrait, taken when annie was given the crystal award robert, grace, herself and the award. she checks her watch it is almost 9:30.}

<A>__{grace, directly behind judith, tries to turn pilgrim to avoid being hit by the errant horse. what follows, we see from grace's perspective. the details that form the images and sounds of grace's mind are fast, disembodies, almost surreal as judith's horse bulldozes into pilgrim, taking his legs out from under him, sending both horses careening down the icy slope. grace hangs onto pilgrim's neck. judith, her leg helplessly tangled in the stirrup, is dragged, her head bouncing on the frozen ground. they slide all the way back down to the country road. pilgrim is the first to find his legs and stand. grace manages to sit up in the saddle. she sees judith's horse stumbling back onto its feet, one of his legs broken at the ankles, walking in confused circles, dragging judith her face bleeding, her leg hanging from the stirrup.}

<A>__{... the horses turn apart. the driver starts furiously downshifting, trying to brake... he seems to get it under control when suddenly the truck skids on some ice. it begins to slide, out of control, the truck bed and the cab jack knifing. the truck literally plows over the helpless judith and her horse the horse going down on the pavement, judith disappearing under him. the truck's cab, like a mythic monster, heads right for grace and pilgrim... grace looks right into the driver's helpless, frightened eyes... suddenly, pilgrim rears up at the truck, sending grace flying, bouncing her off the pavement and under the wheel of the truck. pilgrim instinctively jumps onto the hood of the truck, his hooves caught between the rear view mirrors like some grotesque ornament. his head and chest slams into the window, shattering through the glass. and then it is still. the truck has stopped halfway in the road. judith's horse lies in the road, motionless. pilgrim, on the truck's hood, his legs splayed, stuck, his head and chest, bleeding. he shrieks, struggling to get to his feet. he manages to free his legs and, stepping off the cab onto the road, walks off, wounded, in pain, into the sanctuary of the woods... the driver stumbles out of the cab, his head bleeding, in shock. he sits on the ground. all we hear is the sound of the river and the wind in the trees. grace, halfway under the truck, frozen, stares up at the beautiful morning sky.}

<C>__{annie}
<D>__{well... you're closest anyone's gotten.}
<A>__{he walks straight towards them veering more to grace. he stops in front of her and they look into each other's eyes in a way that reminds us of how tom looked at pilgrim. except, grace is made even more uncomfortable by the intimacy. she turns away and walks to the corral, to lean on a post as if she doesn't care. tom turns to annie.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i have to be honest. i still feel you made a long trip for nothing.}
<A>__{he looks at annie. annie has no more words just an ever present pleading in her face. tom watches as grace makes a small, naked movement putting her hand on her cheek, like a hurt child. he can't help but see these three being connected by one wound.}

<A>__{grace reacts anew to tom's remark. she likes her mother being dis empowered. annie keenly understands the importance of tom putting it this way to grace. grace has all eyes on her just what she wants. all waiting for her response. she turns away, flicks her head and says:}

<D>__{hold onto it, go on...}
<A>__{she's forced to catch it. he turns and rides away, chasing down pilgrim, trying to edge him toward the herd. for a moment, he has him breaking to the left with the horses. but as soon as he's clear of tom, he separates himself and comes to stop on his own. tom rides back to grace, taking back the flag.}

<D>__{we'll get there, grace.}

<C>__{annie}
<D>__{is this mr. booker? tom's grandfather?}
<A>__{diane looks at a faded photo circa late 1800's.}

<C>__{annie}

<C>__{diane}
<D>__{always did. i think she favored him a little. you tend to when you have more than one, even though you love 'em all the same.}
<A>__{she studies the old faces of tom's parents although 20th century people, there is still a pioneering strength in their visage... a stoicism and power.}
<C>__{diane}
<P>__{(putting away forks)}
<D>__{ha, she loves telling this story about how when he was two years old, he ran off. they found him in the barn, sleeping between two giant hooves of a percheron stallion. she said that horse was protecting him and nobody could convince her otherwise.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i got a little confused though. the ranch ellen was talking about that's not this one?}
<A>__{diane is sorting silverware throughout the following:}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{no. see, frank and tom were raised near the clark's fork river, right between the pryor and beartooth mountains. beautiful piece of land. but they had this uncle ned useless man, never interested in ranching. and when the grandparents died, he left for the city and sent word through lawyers he wanted his claim to the land so he could sell it. three years of legation broke their father. frank took it all in stride, but tom... tom loved that land. i don't think he ever got over it his home being sold out from under him. seeing his father like that. once he and frank got their folks set up in a new place, tom left... went off. we didn't see him for years...}

<D>__{because it fits my head. you want to try it on?}

<C>__{tom}
<D>__{all right, al right. hold out your finger.}
<A>__{annie takes a seat nearby and watches as tom holds out the first finger of his right hand. the twins holds out his. tom splits his focus between annie and the twins as he takes a small piece of rope out of his back pocket. he ties the ends together making a loop. he puts the loop over the twin's finger. and holding the other end of the loop taut with his left hand, he draws one side of the cord over the other with the middle finger of his right hand. then he rolls his hand over so it's under the loop, and back over it again, so that his finger is tip to tip with the twin's. the loop seemingly knotted around their touching fingertips, and can only be removed if their touch is broken.}

<D>__{the loop's knotted, right.}

<D>__{well... it's beautiful country, i will give you that. and i could see having some kind of vacation place. retreat. but i don't know how you do it full time. don't you miss the rest of the world?}

<D>__{what's that to miss?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{ha... if you've never lived in a city with museums, theater, music, restaurants, uh... god, a million things, then it's something i can't explain.}

<A>__{the sound of self pity was so obvious for both of them, so robert quickly re groups, resorting to something he knows is important to her;}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{well, uh the real reason i called, actually, was to tell you i saw lucy at jo jo's tonight and she seems very worried.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{apparently, gottschalk's been seen around town lunching with some very prominent magazine editors. lucy said she tried to call you, but no one answered so she faxed you the list of names. she said one of them have contracts up fairly soon.}

<D>__{oh. i didn't look at my faxes today. we left before sunrise.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{honey, i hope you're not endangering your position. listen, if you need to come back and you want me to come take over, for a while, i will work it out. i mean, the firm's got other lawyers, but the magazine's got only one of you.}

<A>__{annie is awake reading the faxes lucy sent. one after other. as she flips through them, one falls to the floor near the bed. she gets down on all fours to retrieve and sees something under the bed. an old, battered cello case. she pulls it out to find the initials r.b. carved on the top. she opens it to find papers, receipts, bills all from tom's married life.}

<D>__{i thought you were an editor, not a reporter?}
<A>__{annie smiles and nods, realizing she's asking too many questions. she tries to casually reach out to touch the horse's head, but it's too abrupt and the horse tosses his head away, taking a couple of steps back. annie is embarrassed.}

<D>__{i have a way with animals.}

<D>__{yeah. i haven't seen him in a while. he used to come to the ranch over summers, but then he started having friends and was going off to college, so... good boy. hal. lives in new york near his mom.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{how did you meet her?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{college. in illinois. she was playing the cello. i hadn't heard cello music growing up. she had the reddest hair, the bluest eyes. when she played, it was...}
<A>__{tom can't find a beautiful enough word. but annie understands.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{she was the most beautiful thing i'd ever seen.}
<A>__{annie sees tom as if with new eyes his love for this woman he lost.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{why didn't it work out?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{she was never really happy here. she did the best she could.}
<A>__{annie looks at him and for the first time senses a kinship an understanding they both have of being torn between two worlds... a desire for home...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{grace told me you have a country house in connecticut. sounds like a beautiful place.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{it is. it's lovely.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{ever think of moving there full time?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{we did at one pointerior when we thought we'd have more children. and we after tried. we tried everything, but... wasn't meant to be.}
<A>__{there is an awkward silent beat for a moment. annie is momentarily self conscious. tom helps by speaking of himself;}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i hear that! see, i knew she was never going to be a ranchest, but i wanted to try i thought maybe she'd give music lessons to the kids in town or at the school, maybe even recitals. my son would grow up here. maybe have one or two more. i'd teach 'em what i could. they'd play with my brother's kids. all grow up together. and even if they all decided to go out into the world, they'd always know where home was cause we'd keep it for 'em...}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{that's very important to you, isn't it? home.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{yeah, i think it is. and i don't mean everybody's got to be married, have kids it's more like, knowing where you're from, where you belong, what feeds you, where you can go no matter what happens... knowing what you're supposed to be doing while you're here.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{how did you find out all that?}

<D>__{you sure?}
<A>__{angry, determined, grace tries to swing her leg onto the horse. she can't do it. tears of frustration on her face. she tries again. she manages to pull herself halfway on, her prosthetic leg buckles and she falls. frightened, joe runs to her.}

<D>__{you okay?}
<A>__{she gasps to catch her breath. he reaches to help her up. she pulls her hand away. embarrassed, she "runs" off. joe remains still. he hears a little voices. he turns and sees the twins having been watching the whole thing from a small hill. as they run off, he yells, threateningly.}

<D>__{hey. you stop that kind of talk at the table.}

<A>__{annie is so pleased and is about to reply, but grace, noticing tom smiling at annie:}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{it's from a jar.}
<A>__{there's an odd silence as a deflated annie serves frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{finally, diane saves it.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{well, i tried jar sauce once wasn't this good. ya gotta know which brand to buy. i'd like to get the name of this one.}

<D>__{oh, god i think it was the fourth or fifth time i'd been there, so all i remember was the heat and how incompetent the photographer was...}
<A>__{she laughs as she directs this last line to diane, who just smiles. and annie realizes that's not what she meant at all. this woman is starving for glimpses into this other life.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{but, uh, egypt is, well, it's like nothing else. it's like going back in time.}
<P>__{(diane listens)}
<D>__{i remember as a kid trying to imagine what a kid my age, centuries ago, walking over that same ground, was wondering about or, if they had the same problems as me... and i felt, connected to... to time itself, almost. ha, i never realized how hard it was to describe.}

<P>__{(at a loss)}
<D>__{i'm sorry if my friendship with tom bothers you so much, but i happen to value having someone to talk to, especially when my own daughter ignores me night and day because no matter what i say, it's wrong and no matter what i do, it's wrong... i'm sorry i'm such a disappointment to you.}

<D>__{well, now you know what it feels like.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{annie}
