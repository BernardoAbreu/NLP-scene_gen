<A>__{tim sits in his chair, still staring sightlessly at the whiskey bottle. smith enters. he looks from tim to the bottle on the table, then back to tim.}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(after a beat, disinterestedly)}
<D>__{what did he want the stranger?}
<C>__{tim}
<P>__{(abstractedly)}
<D>__{he asked about komako.}
<P>__{(looking up at smith)}
<D>__{you think he'll kick up a storm?}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(easily)}
<D>__{a storm? about what?}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{i don't know. all i know, i don't want trouble around here.}
<P>__{(pauses awkwardly, then)}
<D>__{never again.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{trouble? you don't know anything about komako, now do you, tim?}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{i do not. that's the pointerior}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{the point is, what you don't know can't hurt you.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{maybe there's something i ought to know. maybe i ought to ask you... before the stranger comes back and starts breathing down my neck.}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(a faint smile)}
<D>__{tim, you're a lost ball in the high weeds. i told you a long time ago, nothing happened for you to worry about.}
<C>__{tim}
<P>__{(stands up, facing smith)}
<D>__{thing is, i do worry. maybe i ain't much else, but i'm sure a worrier.}
<P>__{(beat, then with soft emphasis)}
<D>__{and i'm still the law.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{then do your job, tim.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{what is my job, mr. smith? maybe i'd better find out before macreedy does it for me.}
<C>__{smith}
<P>__{(evenly)}
<D>__{macreedy'll do nothing, tim. and neither will you.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{suppose i decide to try?}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{that would be dangerous. you got the body of a hippo, tim, but the brain of a rabbit. don't overtax it.}
<A>__{he stares harshly at the sheriff. tim tries unsuccessfully to meet his gaze. then, slowly, he sits down.}
<C>__{tim}
<P>__{(lowering his eyes, mumbling)}
<D>__{yes, mr. smith.}
<A>__{smith slowly walks behind tim's chair and silently, patronizingly pats the sheriff's slack shoulder...}
