<L>__{exterior caveman village the paleolithic era day}
<A>__{a small caveman community made up of five large caves, all facing out towards a crackling fire. slack jawed, yet strong and confident cavemen stumble about, dragging haunches of meat, pounding the dirt with sticks, dragging the women. we pan over to a small cave. not even really a cave at all, but a crack in the rocks barely large enough to sleep in. stepping out of this "cave" is a small, weak, nerdy looking caveman. the chief caveman, set apart by the large mallet he wields, steps towards the fire and grunts loudly to mark the beginning of a caveman meeting. "loser caveman" steps forward apprehensively, only to be met with laughter from the other cavemen. "loser caveman" sighs and shrinks back into his sad, little cave, watching them from the shadows.}
