<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior level six, shock corridor night}
<A>__{alex steps out of a doorway into a long, narrow hallway. the hallway is mirrored on one side. it has no doors or windows, and up ahead, it branches off to the right and the left. alex turns and looks behind her. the doorway she came through is gone now. a mirrored wall stands in its place, with her own reflection staring back at her.}
<B>__{the reflection}
<A>__{there are subtle changes. they shouldn't be noticeable at first, but the reflection seems somehow more threatening. alex starts down the hall, her reflection keeping pace with her. up ahead, she hears a buzzing noise, drawing closer. light flickers in the hallway to the left, presumably whatever it is that's buzzing. suddenly a streak of light, running along the floor, turns the corner and heads down the hallway towards alex. the light hits her feet and sparks fly. alex screams and is thrown back against the wall, shocked. the streak of light continues past her and disappears into the mirror at the hall's end. it's like a moving electrical pulse.}
<B>__{alex}
<A>__{she's been given a pretty good jolt. her hands shake for a moment, an after seizure of sorts, and she stands...}
<B>__{her mirrored reflection}
<A>__{is watching her, arms crossed. this wouldn't be a problem were it not for the fact that alex currently doesn't have her arms crossed!}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(to her reflection)}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<A>__{the reflection grins and its her eyes glow with fractals.}
<C>__{alex reflection}
<P>__{(in arcade's voice)}
<D>__{any time, bitch.}
<A>__{spooked, alex continues down the hallway, reaching the end and turning left...}
<B>__{new corridor}
<A>__{alex moves quicker now, glancing left as her reflection follows. buzzzzz!!! here comes another streak of light, rushing in along the floor from a side corridor... alex leaps over it, and it passes harmlessly under her. now she's getting the hang of it. she starts forward again. buzzzzz!!! here come two at a time from opposite directions... alex has to jump left to avoid the first streak and lands directly in the path of the second. then she jumps back to the right again...}
<B>__{the two streaks}
<A>__{pass by, zipping away from each other.}
<B>__{another corridor}
<A>__{the pace quickens, with alex racing down the corridors. she turns corner after corner. it's become a virtual maze. we cut back to alex's "strength" and "time elapsed" meters again and again. both are shrinking away to nothing. and all the while, her reflection keeps pace with her, growing increasingly more nightmarish in appearance. as alex tires, the reflection seems to gain more strength. buzzzzz!!! buzzzzz!!! the streaks are shooting towards her with more frequency, and now they're racing along the walls too. alex is jumping left and right, with sparks exploding around her.}
<B>__{the reflection}
<A>__{seems to be metamorphosizing. each time we see it her, she looks a little different. what's gradually happening (as time elapses) is that alex's reflection is turning into the screamer. alex moves with increasing urgency as the streaks converge on her. the corridors are filled with a constant buzzing and flickering of light. sparks fly and alex is shocked over and over. she stumbles, falls to the floor, and rolls to the right, just missing a streak. it cuts past her face, centimeters away. beep! beep! beep! off goes her wrist display! alex is up and running now, desperate. we cut faster and faster alex running, the streaks of light, the reflection until...}
<B>__{end corridor}
<A>__{she's back where she started. and the corridor dead ends in a mirrored wall... behind alex, dozens of light streaks are dogging her heels, literally just behind her. they're so thick that she couldn't possibly leap over all of them. seconds before they reach her. ahead of alex, the mirror shows her own reflection, rushing closer. her wrist display indicates that time is up with a prolonged beep and her own reflection vanishes. it's the screamer in her reflection's place. only it's rocketing towards her in the mirror. it's in front of her this time, instead of behind her. rock and a fucking hard place. light streaks or screamers? it's really no choice at all. her guts says "screamer". alex leaps and smashes into the mirror at full speed. the world is filled with shattering glass and a shower of infinite reflections and then we...}
