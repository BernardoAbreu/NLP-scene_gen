<L>__{interior cathedral a moment later night}
<A>__{ancient and creepy. a huge pipe organ, shattered stained glass windows, row after row of mahogany pews... all forgotten, covered with dust and cobwebs. the joker wanders about, staring at the statuary, the rusted icons. dick enters silently behind him. he kneels behind a rear pew, brings up the gun, and squeezes off three quick shots at the joker. the joker dives, takes cover, and returns dick's fire. then: silence. in a crouch, groping his way along the wall, the joker finds what he wants: a small door opening on a wooden stairway, leading to the belltower. he ducks inside and starts up. dick's gun drops with a thud. his hand slips from the back of the pew. in the second before he slumps to the floor, unconscious, he sees a curious sight: a tiny black ninja wheel, imbedded in the flesh of his leg. behind him framed in the arched doorway a ragged black ghost begins his final unholy march down the center aisle of the old cathedral.}
