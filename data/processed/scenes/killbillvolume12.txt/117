<A>__{...more dirt. she reacts again.}
<B>__{bam...}
<A>__{the dirt just keeps falling, the bams becoming softer with each new shovelful. the bride is starting to perspire...her breathing becoming more rapid and panicked...her heartbeat begins to echo inside the pine box. we've never seen her like this before. she's starting to lose it...she lets out a scream...she screams again...her bound at the wrist hands move to the lid...she pounds on it...her bound feet kick up at it...she starts to cry...she's getting hysterical...her fingers begin clawing at the wood lid...}

<C>__{the bride }
<D>__{no! i can't turn off the light. yes you can. the darkness will have a calming effect. now turn off that fucking light.}
