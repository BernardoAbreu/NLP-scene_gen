<D>__{... don't ...}

<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(behind kirsty)}
<D>__{jesus christ.}
<A>__{they start down to the half landing. there stands the cenobite in the dark glasses, carrying the hooked rod he threatened steve with in the hospital. again, kirsty manipulates the box. again, the cenobite howls and is claimed by the darkness.}
