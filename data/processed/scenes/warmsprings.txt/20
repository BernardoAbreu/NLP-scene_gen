<L>__{interior democratic convention hall san francisco night}
<A>__{conventioneers shout out franklin's name holding up placards emblazoned with:}
<D>__{"cox roosevelt in '20!"}
<A>__{franklin bolts, running vigorously down the center aisle of the hall lit by the circle of a spotlight. the crowd goes wild over this unconventional entrance. when he reaches the edge of the stage he leaps onto it. this final act of daring pushes the crowd into frenzy. close up franklin smiling for no one. for everyone.}
<C>__{franklin}
<P>__{(breathless)}
<D>__{i humbly accept your nomination for vice president!}
<A>__{the crowd roars back in reaction to his less than humble stance.}
<C>__{franklin}
<D>__{they say the best way to get rid of a man is to have him run for vice president.}
<P>__{(he holds for the laugh)}
<D>__{you might well have asked my cousin teddy if that's how they got rid of him!}
<A>__{franklin stands on the stage, the music rising, the crowd cheering. slowly, the sound of the convention fades to something far more delicate...}
