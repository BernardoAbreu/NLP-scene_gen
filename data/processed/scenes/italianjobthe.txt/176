<L>__{interior ago restaurant night}
<A>__{a posh restaurant. as our camera finds stella and steve, she is laughing at something he said, faking her way through the date. they're sitting at an intimate table.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{you really make laugh.}
<A>__{he takes the lie like the compliment she wants him to think it is.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{so here's what i have lined up for after dinner. we'll go to club deep. the ferrari always gets me to the front of the line. we'll do a little dancing...}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{not tonight. i don't want to be out late.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{why the curfew?}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{let's just say i've made some wrong calls in the past. i like to take things slow, cautious. next time...}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i understand. you have nothing to worry about. you can trust me.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{i trust everyone. it's the devil inside them that i don't trust.}
<A>__{that saying strikes steve.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{that's an interesting saying.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{he looks at her closely, really closely.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{there's only person i've ever heard say that. used to say it all the time.}
<A>__{this worries her. because of course, she used to hear it from her father.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{who was that?}
<A>__{under the table, he grabs her by the wrist, squeezes it like a vise.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{a man named john bridger. where did you pick up that phrase?}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{ow. i don't remember. you're hurting me.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{john bridger was a thief. and he had a daughter. about your age. he told me that she took over a safe and lock company that he used as a front.}
<C>__{stella}
<D>__{let go of my wrist. what is wrong with you? it's just a saying.}
<A>__{steve's voice is calm, so at ease that watching them you'd think this was pleasant dinner conversation.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{no wonder i liked you right away. just like i liked your old man, right up until the moment i shot him in the head. now tell me who you're working with and tell me the plan. do it now or we'll go for a ride and i will break every bone in your body.}
<A>__{stella intentionally knocks over a glass of wine. it shatters on the floor. an emergency signal... charlie, half ear, handsome rob and lyle appear around the table. steve is shocked to see the men he left for dead three years ago standing before him, very much alive. they pull up chairs from another table, encircling him for a tense and pointed talk.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{something wrong, steve? you look like you want to call ghostbusters.}
<A>__{half ear furtively slides the switchblade out of his boot.}
<D>__{half ear she's coming with us. you got a problem with that?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{fine by me. but it's you that has the problem.}
<C>__{lyle}
<D>__{how do you figure?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you've just blown the one thing you had going in your favor, the element of surprise. and i was surprised.}
<P>__{(he laughs unpleasantly)}
<D>__{jesus christ when i saw all you guys come out of the woodwork. for a minute i thought maybe you were ghosts. but you're screwed now.}
<P>__{(an arrogant sneer a half ear)}
<D>__{did you figure out how to take care of my security guard? i will hire five more.}
<P>__{(at lyle)}
<D>__{you know how to bypass my alarm system? i will have a new one installed tomorrow.}
<P>__{(at handsome rob)}
<D>__{does it tear you up inside seeing what car i drive? i will buy a matching one in red.}
<P>__{(at stella)}
<D>__{you think you can crack my safe? you'll end up the same way as your dad.}
<P>__{(then to charlie, all smiles)}
<D>__{looks like good time charlie's got the blues.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you can wear that shit eating grin on your face, but i know under that versace shirt you're in a cold sweat. and you're not going to sleep a minute tonight. cause you thought you'd gotten away with it free and clear. you thought you'd gotten rid of us. you're the one who's screwed. right to the wall.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{give it your best shot. i will outsmart you every step of the way. and this time, i will bury you myself.}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(taking the challenge)}
<D>__{get more guards. change the alarm. buy a dozen ferraris. we'll still be here. sleep tight.}
<A>__{charlie grabs a bread stick off the table and goes. the others follow.}
