<L>__{exterior empty army base yellowstone national park day}
<A>__{at the entrance to the airstrip a huge crevasse forms, cutting the rv off from reaching the plane. lilly sticks out her head.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{mommy!}
<A>__{jackson swerves wildly to miss the crack, sending lilly flying out. without thinking, he lets go of the wheel, lunging after her and pulling her back inside.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{stay down darling.}
<A>__{jackson races the rv alongside the forming crack. spotting a narrow point in the crevasse, he makes a decision. slamming the accelerator down, he races towards it at full speed. moments later the rv is airborne! kate watches, too shocked to scream. a few drawn out seconds. then the rv touches down, crashing 200 feet from the plane. kate runs towards the wreckage of the camper. lilly jumps out, racing into her mom's arms. jackson turns and sees the cloud approaching.}
<C>__{jackson }
<D>__{you guys go! i will be right there!}
<A>__{kate pulls lilly back to the plane. jackson jumps into the back of the rv scavenging through the shelves, looking for charlie's map. kate lifts lilly onto the wing of the plane. gordon revs up the engines.}
<C>__{noah}
<D>__{give me your hand, lil'.}
<A>__{noah pulls his little sister into the cockpit. fiery rocks rain from the sky, detonating to the right and left of their plane as kate climbs in.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{we have to take off!}
<C>__{noah}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{where's daddy?!}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{kate, i'm sorry but if we wait we'll all die!}
<A>__{gordon pushes the throttle. the plane starts to move. kate screams.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{gordon! wait!}
<A>__{back in the rv, jackson is frantically going through the masses of books and papers on the shelves. finally, a map. he unfolds it. but it's only of the london underground system. he throws it to the ground and finds another. this time he's lucky! there are markings everywhere. as he races to the door, the ground gives way beneath the rv. kate and the kids watch it disappear from sight.}
<C>__{kate }
<D>__{jackson! no!}
<A>__{noah begins to cry and lilly clings to her mom. gordon just stares, paralyzed. the ash cloud is almost upon them! gordon takes action and accelerates the plane. kate turns back. a hand emerges from the crevasse. then another, holding a map. her face lights up.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{it's daddy!}
<A>__{jackson pulls himself up and sprints towards them, the map in his hand.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{jackson! here!}
<A>__{kate leans out of the cockpit reaching for him.}
<C>__{noah}
<D>__{faster dad. you can make it!}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{kate, grab him for god sake. we're almost out of runway.}
<A>__{using every last ounce of energy, jackson leaps onto the wing and is yanked into the plane by kate. just at that moment, the plane lifts off. jackson falls into the cockpit, completely out of breath. lilly crawls over and hugs him.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{thanks for waiting guys.}
<A>__{now all eyes are glued to the speedometer. 180... 190... the violent ash cloud is hitting their tail rudder. the plane swerves wildly! gordon gets it back under control. the speedometer finally creeps towards 200 mph and the cloud slowly falls back. everybody breathes a sigh of relief.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{so, now that you got your map, where are we going?}
<A>__{jackson unfolds it and takes a look. hundreds of markings clutter the map. in the left corner he discovers a large letter c followed by h i n a. he looks up.}
<C>__{jackson}
<D>__{we're gonna need a bigger plane.}
