<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(interrupting, sniffing)}
<D>__{just think about it. that's all i ask.}
<A>__{they walk offscreen and the film cuts to hannah and mickey's living room. the room is brightly lit; it's cluttered with pillows and plants. norman and carol, his wife, sit on the couch drinking coffee.}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(putting down her cup)}
<D>__{oh, that was a wonderful show. i think that's the best show you two ever wrote.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(holding his cup, pointing emphatically)}
<D>__{no, the funniest show that mickey and i ever did was the one we won the emmy for.}
<A>__{mickey walks from the kitchen into the living room, holding a half eaten chocolate cake on a serving plate. the sun pours through the windows he passes. hannah is briefly seen in the background, preparing more coffee in the kitchen.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{yeah...i i think as, i think as far as laughs, i mean just plain laughs, you know, that was probably the best thing that we ever did.}
<A>__{mickey puts the cake down on the coffee table, which is already crowded with assorted plants, plates, and a bamboo tray holding utensils and napkins.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(agreeing)}

<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(overlapping, her}

<D>__{yeah, it was funny, it was very funny. but the show was about the two frenchmen, now that was funny and it was warm.}
<A>__{mickey sighs and flops down on an adjoining couch. he rubs his forehead.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(to carol, gesturing with his cup)}
<D>__{we got that idea on that trip to paris.}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{hmm?}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(to the offscreen hannah)}
<D>__{do you remember that summer in france? hannah, you had jet lag for six straight weeks.}
<A>__{norman chuckles.}

<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(standing up and gesturing)}
<D>__{jeez, this is, this is, this is very delicate and and i only bring this up amongst friends, you know.}
<A>__{he starts to pace. hannah, her hands clasped near her face, glances briefly at carol.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(turning to the group}
<D>__{as he paces behind}
<P>__{the couch)}
<D>__{i mean...}
<P>__{(grunting)}
<D>__{this is, uh... this should not go any further than this room.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(sipping his coffee)}
<D>__{i'm all ears.}
<A>__{hannah sighs. mickey pauses for a moment, collecting his thoughts.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(gesturing and pacing)}
<D>__{hannah and i...can't have any children. now i i i don't want to get into whose fault it }
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{it's my fault that we can't and and and the details are too embarrassing to }
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(interrupting,}
<D>__{nervously picking at}
<P>__{her fingers)}
<D>__{w w we we've decided after a lot of discussion that we we'd try with artificial insemination.}
<A>__{mickey stops his pacing and looks at the group.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(putting his hands on his hips)}
<D>__{yeah, i'm not so sure that i, that i like that idea myself, anyway }
<A>__{he starts to pace behind the couch anew.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{um, i i didn't really want to, you know, go to a sperm bank or something, have some anonymous donor.}
<P>__{(gesturing at norman and carol)}
<D>__{i i just, you know, i i i wouldn't want that.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(pacing)}
<D>__{right. we felt that if we were gonna do it, that we would like somebody who we knew and who we liked and who was warm and bright and...}
<A>__{norman and carol remain silent.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{and you can say no... you know. feel free to say no. w we realize it has all kinds of implications.}
<A>__{mickey stops pacing and leans on the couch behind norman.}
<C>__{mickey}
<D>__{yeah, but the the point that, uh, that we're making here is that we need some sperm.}
<A>__{mickey, rubbing his hands on his knees, leans back against the wall. norman and carol turn to each other, reacting.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{gee.}
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<D>__{well... my first reaction after the initial shock is, uh, flattered that you would ask me.}
<P>__{(chuckling nervously)}
<A>__{carol glances at norman.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(pointing at himself)}
<D>__{yeah, well, i would be the father.}
<P>__{(pointing to norman)}
<D>__{you would just have to masturbate into a little cup.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{i can handle that.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(scooting closer to}
<D>__{carol and norman on}
<P>__{the couch, gesturing)}
<D>__{obviously we wou wouldn't have intercourse.}
<A>__{she chuckles nervously.}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(to hannah, chuckling nervously briefly)}
<D>__{gosh, listen.}
<P>__{(rubbing her nose)}
<D>__{i've gotta tell you the truth here. i'm a little uneasy about this.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(putting her hand on carol's shoulder)}
<D>__{carol, i know it's a lot to ask.}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{well...i feel for you. i do. i...i'm gonna cry. you want my husband to have a child with you?}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{ye d d d don't answer now. just, you know, take it home and think about it for a while.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(holding his coffee cup, thoughtful)}
<D>__{i gave blood before and, uh... clothing to the poor.}
<C>__{carol}
<P>__{(to norman, scratching her ear)}
<D>__{okay, norman, listen, i really want to talk about this at home.}
<P>__{(nodding as hannah}
<D>__{looks briefly}
<P>__{offscreen at mickey)}
<D>__{i think it's a matter for your analyst...and mine.}
<C>__{norman}
<P>__{(emphatically)}
<D>__{and maybe my lawyer.}
<A>__{he takes a sip of coffee.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{you know, we we understand completely if, you know, if you feel you'd you'd rather not.}
<P>__{(chuckling nervously)}
<D>__{i didn't mean to spoil the evening.}
<P>__{(rubbing her hands)}
<D>__{now let's move on to another topic.}
<A>__{hannah reaches for the cake as carol and norman exchange glances, reacting. the flashback ends. mickey is back in the present in his darkened living room, illuminated by a glow from a window behind the couch. a coffee table sits in front of the couch. papers are scattered on the floor. mickey gets up from the couch where he'd been sitting. he paces back and forth as he talks over the screen.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{so you had my ex partner's baby. twins. maybe that did cause some trouble, but}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{i think we were drifting apart anyhow. now instead of man and wife we're just good friends. boy, love is really unpredictable.}
