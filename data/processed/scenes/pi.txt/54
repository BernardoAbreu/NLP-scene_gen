<A>__{max charges into the room. sot is looking at his go board. sol looks up when max comes in.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{you're early. i was just studying our...}
<P>__{(noticing ,max's head)}
<D>__{what did you do to yourself?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you lied to me.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{i thought you were going to take a break.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you found the two sixteen number in pi, didn't you? you saw it.}
<A>__{sol doesn't respond.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i saw it, sol. i don't know what happened, but i know things. the market is going to crash. it's going to crash. it hasn't yet, but i know it will. i saw it, sol. what is it, sol? what's the number?}
<A>__{sol sighs. he looks down at the board and collects himself.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{you have it?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{it's in my head!}
<C>__{sol}
<P>__{(leveling with max)}
<D>__{okay, sit down.}
<A>__{max does.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{i gave up before i pinpointed it. but my guess is that certain problems cause computers to get stuck in a particular loop. the loop leads to meltdown, but right before they crash they... they become "aware" of their own structure. the computer has a sense of its own silicon nature and it prints out its ingredients.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{the computer becomes conscious?}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{in some ways...i guess...}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{studying the pattern made euclid conscious of itself. before it died it spit out the number that consciousness is the number.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{no, max, it's only a nasty bug.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{a door in front of a cliff. you're driving yourself over the edge. you need to stop.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{stop? how can i stop? i'm this close.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{the bug doesn't only destroy computers.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{what are you saying?}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{look what it did to your computer. look what it's doing to you.}
<A>__{max doesn't respond.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{it's killing you. leave it unknown.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(clarity)}
<D>__{you were afraid of it. that's why you quit.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{max, i got burnt.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{c'mon, sol.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{it caused my stroke.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{that's bullshit. it's math, numbers, ideas. mathematicians are suppose to be out on the edge. you taught me that!}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{max, there's more than math! there's a whole world...}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{that's where discoveries happen. we have to go out there alone, all alone, no one can accompany us. we have to search the edge. we have to risk it all. but you ran from it. you're a coward.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{max, it's death!}
<A>__{max stands up and screams down at sol.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you can't tell me what it is. you don't know you've retreated to your goldfish, to your books, to your go, but you're not satisfied.}
<A>__{sol grabs his cane and whacks the go board.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{get out! max, get out!}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i want to understand it. i want to know!}
<A>__{sol swings his cane as max heads for the door.}
<C>__{sol}
<D>__{out!}
