<L>__{interior whale's house living room night}
<A>__{whale stares out impassively.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{we saw him at morning stand to and evening stand to. "good morning, barnett," we'd say each day. "how's ole barnett looking this morning?" "seems a little peaky. looks a little plumper." his wounds faced the other way and his hat shielded his eyes, so one could imagine he was napping on bedsprings. he hung there until we were relieved. we introduced him to the new unit before we marched out, speaking highly of his companionship.}
<A>__{clay's eyes are filled with pity.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh, but we were a witty lot. laughing at our dead. telling ourselves it was our death too. but with each man who died, i thought, "better you than me, poor sod."}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{a whole generation was wiped out by that war. millions and millions of young men.}
<A>__{whale begins to hum, a tune we have heard before:}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh death where is thy sting a ling? grave where thy victory?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you survived it. it can't hurt you now. it's no good to dig it up.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh no, my friend. it's digging itself up. there is nothing in the here and now to take my mind off it. all my diversions have abandoned me. parties. reading. painting. work. love. all gone to me now.}
<A>__{whale remains perfectly still, staring out the window. clay deliberates a moment, then puts down his drink next to the decanter of scotch. he stands and yanks the neck of the sweater over his face, then tosses it on the sofa. whale blinks at the reflection in the glass, not yet understanding.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you wanted to draw me like a greek statue. all right, then.}
<A>__{clay pulls at the knot, lets go of the towel. he defiantly parks his hands on his hips.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{there. not so bad.}
<A>__{whale continues to stare at the reflection, his back to clay, his eyes wide and expressionless. he turns slowly, fully expecting the vision to evaporate. when he sees that clay is truly naked he mutters softly under his breath.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{so it is going to happen after all.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{what'd you say?}
<A>__{whale doesn't respond. finally he opens his mouth to take a breath.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{no. it won't do.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{what won't do?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{you are much too human.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{what did you expect? bronze?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{don't move.}
<A>__{whale moves abruptly across the room. he walks past clay.}
