<D>__{to the star and new executive producer of the smoochy show! may your reign be a long and healthy one!}
<A>__{they clink glasses.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{i'm still in shock. complete creative control, part ownership of the show, discretion over merchandising and a dressing room with a toilet! am i dreaming or what?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{and don't forget the corporate penthouse. it took me six years to get that for randolph.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{boy, imagine... me, living in a penthouse. who'd a thunk it.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{it's called the high life, kid. get used to it. pretty soon you'll be burnin' one hundred dollar bills just to see franklin break a sweat.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{jeez, i hope not. i have a deep respect for money. not to mention ben franklin who had some remarkable achievements in his lifetime.}

<C>__{burke}
<D>__{that's your graduation present. something you're gonna need now.}

<D>__{think of it as a tool of the trade.}

<D>__{i've never owned a gun, i've never touched a gun, and i don't believe in guns. when i played cowboys and indians as a kid, i was always the chinese railroad worker.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{trust me, shel. it's a handy accessory in this business. even if you don't load it, have it for show. sometimes that's all you need. especially with a creep like randolph lurking around.}
<A>__{burke and sheldon look up and notice the hulking, grinning figure of spinner dunn standing over them. spinner has the smile of a little boy despite his crooked nose and scarred face. he extends his hand.}

<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{hi there.}
<C>__{spinner}
<D>__{i'm so excited to meet you! i'm spinner!}
