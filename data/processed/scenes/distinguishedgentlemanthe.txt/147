<D>__{yesterday, at chairman dodge's courageous suggestion, i taped the whole conversation. it's all there. mr. chairman, i thank you. the people thank you. america thanks you.}
<A>__{audience applauds dodge. the clapping is considerably sweetened by the panthers and the rest of tommy's claque. dodge gauges their reaction, gets an inspiration. the storm leaves his face, and becomes a smile, which he beams on tommy.}
