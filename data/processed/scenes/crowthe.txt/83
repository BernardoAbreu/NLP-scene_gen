<A>__{albrecht pants, hysterical but calming down. eric waits.}
<C>__{albrecht }
<D>__{i told you cops don't say "freeze".}

<P>__{(beat; regret)}
<D>__{i saw it and couldn't do jack for her.}
<A>__{eric has grown increasingly distraught over albrecht's lines. now he turns to albrecht and, holding albrecht's temples with his fingers, puts his thumbs over albrecht's eyes. tight on eric albrecht against wall we see eric react to a brutal flash... but we don't see the flash. new angle eric and albrecht and eric tears from albrecht; staggers back, now holding his own head. his crow face slacked in realized horror.}
<C>__{albrecht}
<D>__{you okay, man? i mean, what just happened.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{the venom of bad memories. you were there; you saw her. i saw you seeing her.}
<A>__{understandable nervous, albrecht lights up a cigarette.}
<C>__{albrecht}
<D>__{you gotta understand i was hoping she'd talk, give me a lead, a clue, something to work with. but she only said one thing to me before she died.}
<A>__{eric lowers his head, penitent.}

<C>__{albrecht}
<D>__{i should be trying to stop you.}

<D>__{thank you. for giving a damn.}
<C>__{albrecht}
<D>__{my pleasure.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{don't smoke these.}
<A>__{as a bus grumbles past on the street, eric pitches the butt and simultaneously ducks out of frame. angle albrecht turns to see a blank building wall. fire escape. darkness. no eric. he does a full 360 degree turn. eric is gone again.}
<C>__{albrecht}
<D>__{damn, i wish he wouldn't do that.}
<A>__{moving angle from bus roof coat flapping, eric is standing on the bus roof as the bus moves away from albrecht's position.}
