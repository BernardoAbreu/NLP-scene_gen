<L>__{interior shack morning}
<A>__{the sun has just pushed itself well above the horizon as jaeger comes awake. the second he does he sees a man arab, wearing white robes peering through the window. jaeger gives a start, and the man disappears. jaeger quickly shakes epps awake.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{epp...epps! there's someone at the window!}
<A>__{this wakes epps up quick.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{an iraqi?}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{i don't know. he didn't have a uniform on. he...he had on white robes, like the guys who killed wes.}
<A>__{epps does some quick figuring, then staying low, scrambles across the floor to one of the dead iraqis and grabs up his weapon. he grabs another one tosses it to jaeger. carefully, still low, epps creeps over to the window. slowly he raises up and looks out.}
<C>__{jager}
<D>__{see anything?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{nothing.}
<A>__{epps lowers himself back down and does some thinking.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{what do we do?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we can't stay here. even if that wasn't an iraqi soldier it's only a matter of time before some show up. get all the water you can carry, and we'll head out on foot.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{to where?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{sun rises in the east. we go the opposite direction. may not find anything, but at least we'll know we're heading towards saudi arabia.}
<A>__{as jaeger gathers up what water he can find, creeps for the door. with the muzzle of his gun he pulls it open a crack and peers out. still nothing. it's like the man vanished into thin air. jaeger, stocked up on water, comes over with the gold and epps' pack which epps shoulders.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{ready?}
<A>__{jaeger nods. epps opens the door, and the two men carefully snake their way out weapons at the ready. it seems, though, there is nothing to be ready for. there is no one around. suddenly the man appears from around the shack. epps and jaeger turn on him targeting with their assault weapons, but they do not fire. the man just stands. he doesn't say anything, he makes no threatening moves. the three stay still as statues for several beats until epps jerks his head indicating to jaeger they should move on. that they do, weapons still on the man, until they are beyond his range. they walk on a little ways. jaeger spots something, and thrusts a finger in its direction.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{look!}
<A>__{mounted on a horse, riding on a dune that runs parallel to them, is another arab man. he makes no effort to draw nearer to epps and jaeger, but nor does he lose them.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{what do we do?}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{we keep going, that's what we do. we ignore them, maybe they ignore us.}
<A>__{as if to be contrary to epps' statement another two arabs on horse back appear up over a dune before them.}
<C>__{jaeger}
<D>__{jesus! how many of them are there?}
<A>__{epps doesn't know, and he doesn't want to find out. they change direction heading away from the arabs. but again more arabs ride up over a dune. epps gets the feeling he and jaeger are about to be boxed in.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{i don't like this. let's go.}
<A>__{epps breaks into a run. jaeger is only steps behind him. like something out of an old john ford western dozens of mounted arabs suddenly appear over a dune. they ride fast and hard for epps and jaeger like apaches heading for a wagon train. they easily overtake our two, momentarily swallowing them amongst the thundering hoofs, and ride on a bit as if playing with them. epps and jaeger stop, then bolt in the other direction. the arabs ride back, again past epps and jaeger swiping them to the ground; the horses kicking up a spray of lose sand over them. it looks like a cattle round up, and our two are the cattle. epps and jaeger get up to make another run of it, and again the arabs bear down on them. this time they mean business. they completely surround them, cutting off all means of escape. the arabs start screaming something back and forth in arabic. we don't know what, but it sounds unpleasant. epps and jaeger come skidding to a halt. they turn in their tracks digging in the scene. it goes like this: they are completely outnumbered and out gunned by a mounted force. doesn't get any simpler. epps and jaeger drop their weapons. their hands go in the air.}
