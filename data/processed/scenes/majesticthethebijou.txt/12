<A>__{the bottle is in front of pete, who sits at the bar, quietly getting stewed. the frolic room is a classic hollywood dive, dimly lit and full of character and characters. it's a quiet night and getting quieter, as several patrons are just leaving, waving goodbye to the bartender, jerry, early 40s. jerry turns to pete, eyes him suspiciously from the end of the bar. pete picks up the bottle and pours another shot. good boy, he got most of it in the glass.}
