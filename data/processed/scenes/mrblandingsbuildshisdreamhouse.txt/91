<L>__{exterior at the well rig}
<A>__{tesander, a stolid new england well digger, the soul of industry and candor, attacks the earth. jim, followed by muriel and bill, walks into scene, stands by, watching him. after a moment:}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{oh mr. tesander }
<A>__{the motor is making too much noise.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{mr. tesander!}
<A>__{tesander looks up, shuts off his motor.}
<C>__{tesander}
<D>__{yep?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{how's it coming?}
<C>__{tesander}
<P>__{(considers a moment; then:)}
<D>__{it's comin'.}
<A>__{with a nod he turns on his motor, resumes work. jim exchanges a look with muriel and bill.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{no no i mean }
<A>__{but he's drowned out by the motor.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(shouts)}
<D>__{mr. tesander!}
<A>__{tesander patiently stops his motor, looks up.}
<C>__{tesander}
<D>__{yep?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what i meant was how far down are you?}
<A>__{tesander looks at his equipment, considers.}
<C>__{tesander}
<D>__{oh 'bout a hundred and ninety feet.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{well isn't that pretty deep?}
<C>__{tesander}
<P>__{(thinks it over; he's}
<D>__{not one for snap}
<P>__{judgments; then:)}
<D>__{yep.}
<A>__{he's about to turn on his motor, but jim detains him.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{do you think maybe you'd better try another spot?}
<C>__{tesander}
<D>__{up to you.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i mean well, have you hit anything yet at all?}
<C>__{tesander}
<P>__{(thinks it over)}
<D>__{hit some limestone yesterday.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{is that good?}
<C>__{tesander}
<D>__{that's bad.}
<A>__{jim looks at bill who shakes his head with mock commiseration.}
<C>__{tesander}
<D>__{and right now it looks like we're coming into some shale.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{that's bad?}
<C>__{tesander}
<D>__{that's good.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{oh...}
<A>__{jim looks at muriel for comfort which isn't forthcoming.}
<C>__{tesander}
<D>__{'course it might turn out to be sandstone.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{that's bad?}
<A>__{tesander shakes his head, "no."}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{that's good?}
<A>__{tesander shakes his head, "no."}
<C>__{tesander}
<D>__{can't tell. might be good. might be bad. one thing you know you got plenty of shale, sandstone and limestone.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{...i see.}
<A>__{he turns a little helplessly to muriel and bill.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{on a hot day there's nothing like a nice cool limestone shower.}
<C>__{muriel}
<P>__{(sweetly)}
<D>__{mr. tesander, just for the record, of course, what ever happened to water?}
<C>__{tesander}
<D>__{oh, it's there, all right.}
<P>__{(he smiles, nods, tips his hat to muriel)}
<D>__{just got to be patient.}
<A>__{he turns on his motor, goes back to work. jim, muriel and bill start to move off.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{if you ask me, this project's getting a little out of hand.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(defensively)}
<D>__{nothing's getting out of hand at all. i've made a chart of the whole operation, and }
<P>__{(indicates tesander)}
<D>__{with a few minor deviations, i know exactly what every penny's going to cost.}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{two pennies.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(coolly)}
<D>__{and just what does that mean?}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(drily)}
<D>__{meansa we gotta blast.}
<A>__{there is a loud dynamite blast o.s. as a shower of dirt and rocks cascade down and they run for cover:}
