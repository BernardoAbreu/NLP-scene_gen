<L>__{exterior phelan plantation night}
<A>__{skeeter stands next to the barn smoking a cigarette reading the harper and row offer for the hundredth time. tires crunch gravel down the drive. skeeter sees a car moving toward her with the headlights off. worried, skeeter looks toward her home. charlotte can be seen in an upstairs window. skeeter soon recognizes the car as hilly's. hilly parks, lights a cigarette and gets out of her car. skeeter charges toward her.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<A>__{hilly screams and throws her lit cigarette at skeeter.}
<C>__{hilly}
<D>__{don't you get an inch closer!}
<A>__{hilly's a mess. her shirt is half tucked. her shorts strain to contain a newly developed layer of fat. a horrible fever blister burns hot on hilly's upper lip.}
<C>__{hilly }
<D>__{i've contacted my lawyer, hibbie goodman. he's the best libel attorney in mississippi. you're in big trouble, missy. and you're going to jail.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{you can't prove anything, hilly.}
<C>__{hilly}
<D>__{i one hundred percent know you wrote it `cause nobody else in town is as tacky as you. those nigras of yours are in a lifetime of trouble.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{exactly who are you talking about? you don't know anything.}
<C>__{hilly}
<D>__{i don't, do i? you tell aibileen, the next time she wants to write about my dear friend elizabeth...uh huh. remember her? had you in her wedding? let's just say, aibileen ought to've been a little bit smarter before putting in the l shaped crack in poor elizabeth's dining table. and that nigra, minny? do i have plans for her.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{careful, hilly. don't give yourself away now.}
<C>__{hilly}
<D>__{that was not me who ate that pie!}
<A>__{hilly storms up the porch steps. skeeter follows.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{i did not invite you here!}
<A>__{skeeter yanks hilly's arm hard.}
<C>__{hilly}
<D>__{i've come to tell your mother what a hippie you've become. she's gonna be disgusted by you.}
<A>__{skeeter can't help but laugh.}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{you're telling my mother on me?}
<A>__{hilly opens the door. skeeter grabs her. they struggle.}
<C>__{skeeter }
<D>__{you get out of here!}
<A>__{charlotte suddenly appears. skeeter lets go of hilly.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{why, hilly...it's been such a long time, dear. everything okay, you two?}
<A>__{hilly is shocked by charlotte's frail appearance.}
<C>__{hilly}
<D>__{missus phelan, i'm...i'm here to }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{hilly, you're a mess. are you ill?}
<A>__{hilly self consciously licks her fever blister.}
<C>__{hilly}
<D>__{well, i...i didn't have time to get fixed up before }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{darling, no husband wants to come home and see this.}
<A>__{charlotte peers closely at hilly's cold sore.}
<C>__{charlotte }
<D>__{and that...that is horrendous.}
<C>__{hilly}
<D>__{missus phelan, i'm here }
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{you know, hilly. if i didn't know any better, i'd say you've been eating too many...sweets?}
<A>__{hilly's face turns purple with embarrassment. charlotte moves in for the kill.}
<C>__{charlotte }
<D>__{in fact. i'm sure of it. now get out of my house...before we all get one of those on our lip.}
<A>__{hilly looks back and forth between skeeter and her mother, not knowing what to say. hilly runs out of the house as charlotte sashays quietly into the living room. shocked, skeeter stands alone in the foyer. hilly sprays gravel across the phelan yard as she speeds away.}
<D>__{charlotte (o.c.) (cont'd) eugenia?}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{yes, ma'am.}
<C>__{charlotte }
<D>__{come in here, please.}
<A>__{skeeter gulps as she heads toward the living room.}
