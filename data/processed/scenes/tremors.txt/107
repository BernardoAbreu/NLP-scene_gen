<L>__{exterior pham van's store roof day}
<A>__{the men are disappointed. that's not what they wanted to hear from burt. then earl perks up and grab the cb mic.}
<C>__{earl}
<P>__{(into cb)}
<D>__{okay, burt, listen. forget shooting them. tell me this: can you get to your truck?}
<C>__{burt }
<D>__{no problem.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{good. you've got the only truck in the valley that can make it up that damn jeep trail. so, here's the plan: you and heather go for help. get to the mountains...}
<A>__{but rhonda interrupts, pointing urgently from the water tower.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{hey, guys! they're up to something.}
<A>__{val, earl and miguel rush to the edge of the roof and look down where she's pointing a creature is running its tentacles along the building's foundation. it's a strange, more studied movement than we've seen before.}
<C>__{val}
<P>__{(to rhonda)}
<D>__{what's it doing?}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{why do you all keep asking me?}
<A>__{they all stare nervously down as the tentacles feel their way along the wall, moving toward a corner of the building. suddenly miguel spots something down the next wall.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{hey, there's another one coming!}
<A>__{another set of tentacles is feeling along the adjacent wall. the two creatures meet at the corner, their tentacles touch ing rather like ants' antennae. they they submerge; tenta cles zipping into the earth. nothing happens for a moment. then the corner of the building suddenly heaves up a couple of feet. clapboard siding splits. a warped window shatters. (we don't see the creatures, only the effect of their shoving from below). the men nearly lose their balance. then the corner sinks back down.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{what the hell was that all about?}
