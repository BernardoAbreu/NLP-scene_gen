<L>__{interior grand central station platform day}
<A>__{we see beefy and todd waiting by the place where nicky usually comes up. it is hot down there. steam and smoke comes out of the tunnels. todd is nervous.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{where is he? he's late.}
<C>__{beefy}
<D>__{he'll be here. just keep your cool, kid.}
<A>__{they hear footsteps. they turn and see the chief of police backed up by the huge police force.}
<C>__{beefy }
<D>__{we've been ratted out.}
<A>__{beefy and todd turn to see john and peter looking sheepish.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{you guys. that was so uncool.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{we thought the son of satan would understand a move like this.}
<A>__{peter and john high five.}
<C>__{chief of police}
<D>__{okay, take these two outside. i can handle this.}
<A>__{the police grab todd and put a leash on beefy. the cops lead their prisoners away down the tunnel, leaving john and peter alone with the chief.}
<C>__{chief of police }
<D>__{wanna see something cool?}
<A>__{the chief inserts a finger into his nostril. then he fits his hand up there. soon his whole arm is up his nostril as he searches for something. john and peter are impressed. the chief grabs something and starts to pull. then out of his nose comes adrian, who fully forms as the shell of the chief's body slumps to the ground.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{ta da. so what time is my brother expected back?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{noon...}
<A>__{they look at the clock. it's noon.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{...ish.}
<A>__{peter is sweating, kinda nervous.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{so even though you're not really the chief, we still get the rest of the cash, right bro?}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{you know what you'll get? an indescribably horrific torture administered by demons for the rest of eternity.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{but what about the cash? can we keep it or what?}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{sure, why not?}
<A>__{they high five. adrian smiles and waits. it is real hot down there. we hear a train coming in the distance. a fan circles slowly. they all wait for him.}
<C>__{lady}
<P>__{(mumbling to herself)}
<D>__{food stamps? they should call 'em "dude stamps." cause ever time i get one, some dude takes it away...}
<A>__{we see the homeless lady down the platform stumbling her way towards them, drunk. adrian scowls at her.}
<C>__{lady }
<D>__{hey, studs. i will let you make out with me for a dollar!}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no thanks...but we'll take that bottle of booze.}
<P>__{(grabs the bottle, laughs)}
<C>__{lady}
<D>__{hey...that's mine.}
<A>__{peter pushes her away.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{beat it, ya freak.}
<A>__{john and peter high five and john swigs from the bag.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{schnapps...}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(takes the bag, swigs)}
<D>__{pepperminterior..alright.}
<A>__{adrian raises his eyebrows. we see that the homeless lady is actually valerie in disguise. she looks back, tense. john offers adrian the flask.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{wanna hit?}
<A>__{hands it to him. he takes it.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{drink up. here's to fifty million clams.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{to the defilement of earth and the corruption of its people.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{whatever. knock it back, grab nicky and let's get outta this hell hole.}
<A>__{adrian smiles at john, then raises the bag. he stops just before it hits his lips. he looks at john curiously.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{it is awfully hot down here. how do you manage to stay so cool?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{weed lowers the body temperature.}
<P>__{(stuttering)}
<D>__{i read that...in, uh...er, science magazine.}
<A>__{adrian stares at john. he raises the bag again.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{this liquid will probably quench my thirst. cool me off.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{definitely.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{and give you a good buzz.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{or maybe it will trap me inside for all eternity.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{uh. no it won't?}
<A>__{john starts to tremble a bit.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{oh, nicky, i've missed you. come on out and say hello...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{urr...uggg...errr...}
<C>__{adrian}
<P>__{(eyes getting red)}
<D>__{i'm calling you out, brother...}
<A>__{adrian is mentally pulling nicky out of john. nicky john wages an epic battle with himself as adrian smiles.}
<D>__{john nicky urrr...uggh...}
<P>__{(as nicky)}
<D>__{oww. adrian, this is very painful.}
<A>__{nicky comes flying out. john's body slumps to the floor next to the chief's. adrian looks in the "schnapps bottle" to see the flask wrapped in paper. he peeks inside.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{hello, cassius.}
<C>__{cassius }
<D>__{all right. let me out.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{you know, new hell really only needs one new satan.}
<C>__{cassius }
<D>__{you mother...}
<A>__{adrian hands nicky the flask.}
<C>__{adrian}
<D>__{but cassius could use some company for the rest of eternity. so get in the flask.}
<A>__{he puts the flask in nicky's hands.}
