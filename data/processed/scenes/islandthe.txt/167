<L>__{exterior. the platform mound night}
<A>__{a blazing fire. figures in silhouette, moving around, chanting. the platform mound is situated just beyond the heritage park. an ancient ceremonial site, stepped in ruins, dusted with caliche. pima and maricopa, descendants of the hohokam, are congregated for a solstice ceremony. off to the side, a group of horses are tethered, shuffling, snorting. lincoln approaches, cautiously, but somehow like a moth to the flame. he stops at a distance, watching. the curiosity of congruent sound and movement.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{you look a little lost, my friend.}
<A>__{lincoln turns to a figure emerging from the night. a tall man swarthy skin, mist colored eyes. his tribal name is grey dove }
<C>__{grey dove }
<D>__{or did you come here for a reason?}
<A>__{lincoln examines the tall man. the face seems as deep and gentle as the voice. his sense of danger, unstirring, he concedes }
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i was looking for water.}
<C>__{grey dove}
<D>__{not the best place to look.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{my transport... it stopped working.}
<C>__{grey dove}
<D>__{i see. and where were you going?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{out of state...}
<A>__{lincoln sighs, the destination seeming very far away. grey dove considers him. this bruised, weary outsider is somehow childlike.}
