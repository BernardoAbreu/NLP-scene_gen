<A>__{so do i. go put your dress on. julia runs off to her room when toni suddenly spies a tacky, woman's jacket draped on a chair. toni regards it and the camera tracks toni through the apartment. down the hall. voices heard. a man and woman as walter emerges from his office with a call girl. he's pulling bills from his wallet.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{easy 200, huh? here's something extra for a cab.}
