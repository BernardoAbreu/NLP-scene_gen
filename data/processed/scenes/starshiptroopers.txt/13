<L>__{interior carl's house basement day johnny}
<A>__{is hard wired to the stacks of processing units that comprise carl's basement workshop. carl concentrates on the image of a playing card, the six of diamonds, displayed on a monitor.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{don't think about it... go on instinct.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{ace of spades.}
<A>__{the ace of spades appears, and the computer indicates "no match". carl puts another card up, the jack of diamonds.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{in addition to "psychic dolt" this test also proves i'm unlucky ? two of hearts.}
<A>__{wrong again.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{luck is not a factor. no one really knows why some people are sensitive and some aren't. federal studies like this might provide a clue.}
<A>__{the next card up is the nine of clubs.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{i wouldn't want to know what everyone was thinking. four of spades.}
<A>__{suddenly, a giant yellow frog jumps onto the keyboard, fritzing the monitor. johnny removes the blindfold.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{cyrano, you big yellow turd !}
<A>__{johnny knows this frog, scratches him on the neck.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{he just wants attention. you don't play with him like you used to.}
<A>__{carl concentrates for a moment.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{go bug mom, cyrano.}
<A>__{cyrano's eyes widen. he hops off the table and up the stairs two at a time. carl clears the screen.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{how do you make him do that ?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i gave him the impression that there was a fly crawling up my mom's leg. he is going to go eat it.}
<A>__{from upstairs, carl's mom shrieks.}
<C>__{mom }
<D>__{get out ! get out ! carl...!}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{carl, promise me you won't ever do anything like that to me.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{don't be afraid. can't do humans... yet. c'mon let's go.}
<A>__{carl, puts up more cards, johnny misses them all.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{ten of clubs. you still gonna sign up for starside r&d ?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{passport to the universe. who wouldn't want that ?}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{i've been thinking about applying for federal service, too. fleet, maybe.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{your father will never let you.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{i'm eighteen. it's my decision, i think i'd make a pretty good pilot. i've good great reflexes. you need that for maneuvering, you know.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{only 1 in 14 male applicants make it through stellar navigation. so what do you think your chances are ?}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{eight pointerior.. no, uh, seven...}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{if you can't do those numbers, you haven't got a chance.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{all i know is carmen's going to be a citizen, and i don't think it'll work out for us if i'm not.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{love... how excruciatingly pathetic. now try and pay attention.}
<A>__{carl puts a card up.}
<C>__{johnny}
<D>__{queen of hearts.}
<A>__{the computer indicates a match. johnny peers around at the monitor. it is the queen of hearts.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{well, what do you know about that !}
