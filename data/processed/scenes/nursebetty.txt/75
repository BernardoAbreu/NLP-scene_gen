<L>__{interior canyon ranch bar later}
<A>__{there are two empty beer bottles in front of betty. the theme music and closing credits of "a reason to love" are playing. betty pushes the phone back across the bar.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{where you headed, betty?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{los angeles, california.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{and you called your friend, and she's telling you not to go?}
<P>__{(betty nods)}
<D>__{when i went to europe my friends told me i was crazy.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{europe? the europe?}
<P>__{(laughs)}

<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{i should call you dorothy.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{when i left here i went straight to italy. everybody told me not to go. but i wanted to go to rome ever since i saw audrey hepburn in "roman holiday," and goddamnit, i went.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{did you love it?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{sure i loved it! it was great.}
<A>__{ellen rinses a few glasses as she talks to betty.}
<C>__{ellen }
<D>__{let me tell you something. i got groped by these tunisian guys who thought i was a slut for wearing shorts, it was hotter than stink the whole time, and i got some kind of weird gum disease from the water. plus, it ended my marriage }
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{that's horrible!}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{no, he was a toad. even more of a toad than merle... i just wear the ring to keep the flies away. rome was the best thing i ever did, because i did it! and i swear to you, it changed me. i've been to rome, italy! i sat every morning at the cafe sistina and had my cappuccino, and watched the pilgrims walk to mass, and no one can ever take that away from me.}
<A>__{betty leans across the bar conspiratorially. she looks at merle to make sure he won't hear her.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i left my husband two days ago.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i'm getting back with my ex fianc. he proposed to me right around here, so i guess this is just sort of a sentimental stop...}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{wait, i thought you said you'd never been outta kansas...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{oh. i mean, except for that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{yep. i'm trading in a car dealer for a heart specialist, so that's pretty good...}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{nice move. cedars sinai?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{no. loma vista.}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i s'pose his name's david ravell.}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(truly shocked)}
<D>__{how did you know?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{what's his real name?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{dr. david ravell.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{you mean... george mccord, the actor?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{no, i mean david ravell. he's a surgeon.}
<A>__{ellen looks at betty.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{yeah, i know, we just watched him together, remember? up there on the tv.}
<P>__{(off betty's earnest look)}
<D>__{good god almighty ... you're serious. i've heard about people like you.}
<A>__{ellen whistles, wipes the bar down to buy a few seconds. merle looks over at betty, then catches ellen's eye.}
<C>__{ellen }
<D>__{piss off, merle.}
<P>__{(to betty)}
<D>__{so how you gonna find him, betty?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{i will go to the hospital.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{what if you can't find him? what if you get out there, and nothing's the way you thought it was gonna be?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{like rome?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{worse.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{you made out alright.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{yeah, but at least i knew rome was gonna be there when i arrived...}
<A>__{ellen walks to the end of the bar and starts rinsing glasses. after a beat, betty gets up and moves down close to her.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{ellen, this is the biggest thing i've ever done, but i've gotta do it.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{you take care of yourself then, betty, and don't let anybody stop you...}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{to tell you the truth, i can't believe i've made it this far. it may not be europe, but i just know there's something special out there for me...}
<A>__{ellen looks into betty's eyes sees the innocence, the hope and enthusiasm and has to look away. betty takes it as her cue to leave. she smiles, puts two dollars on the bar near the phone and leaves. ellen stands perfectly still, watching the door.}
<C>__{merle}
<D>__{what planet is she from?}
