<L>__{interior projection booth night}
<A>__{never taking his eyes off the screen, harry watches as the film comes to an end and flap! falp! falps! out of the projector. he kills the motor and cranks the carbon arcs apart, and the bright beam dies. it's not the end of the movie, but it is the end of the only fragment they have. harry moves to the house lights rheostat, and slowly fades them up. this done, he pulls a handkerchief from his back pocket and blows his nose loudly. he crosses back to the projector, unlatches the full take up reel and takes it down. he's about to move away, when he senses that he's not alone. he looks over the projector to see luke, standing there. their eyes meet. someone should say something both men search for words. suddenly, luke feels very out of place, almost embarrassed as though he's interrupted a very private ritual. harry senses this. clutching the precious reel of film tightly to his chest, he searches luke's face and smiles warmly.}

<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{yes.}

<D>__{ha!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{... what?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you know, since you've been back, that's the first time you've called me "dad."}
<A>__{father and son look at each other for a long moment searching each other's eyes. harry smiles a sort of half smile at luke, and, still clutching the reel, crosses to the rewind bench. methodically, he mounts it and threads the end of the film onto an empty reel. slowly, he begins to turn the crank, rewinding the film. he stops and looks to where luke was standing... but he's not there. angle projection booth door luke is leaning up against the wall just outside of the projection booth.}
<B>__{one luke}
<A>__{as he closes his eyes...}
