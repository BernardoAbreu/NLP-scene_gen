<L>__{interior airport car park day}
<A>__{the car winds its way slowly up the rampways leading to higher and higher parking levels. james finds the rhythm soothing and begins to calm down.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i've found that i enjoy burying myself in heavy traffic. i like to look at it. yesterday i hired a taxi driver to drive me around for an hour. 'anywhere,' i said. we sat in a massive traffic jam under an off ramp. i don't think we moved more than fifty yards.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i'm thinking of taking up a new job with the road research laboratory. they need a medical officer. the salary is larger something i've got to think about now. there's a certain moral virtue in being materialistic, i'm beginning to feel. well, it's a new approach for me, in any case.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{the road research laboratory? where they simulate car crashes?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{isn't that rather too close...?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{that's the pointerior besides, i know i can give something now that i wasn't remotely aware of before. it's not a matter of duty so much as of commitment.}
<A>__{they have now reached the top level of the multi story car park, and james pulls into a parking spot overlooking a major runway. an immense jumbo jet is maneuvering into its take off position. james turns off the car and puts his arms around helen. she offers no resistance, as though the whole scenario were well understood and agreed upon. james kisses her mouth, her eyelids, unzips her dress. with the jet engines screaming for accompaniment, helen lifts her right breast from her brassiere, pressing james's fingers against the hot nipple. helen now straddles him and, awkwardly meshing with the technology around them, they make love in the driver's seat of the car.}
