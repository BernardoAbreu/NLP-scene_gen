<A>__{dj enters, checks justin's display.}
<C>__{miller }
<D>__{any change?}
<A>__{dj turns, surprised. miller sits, barely visible in the dark.}
<C>__{dj}
<D>__{no. no change.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i've analyzed justin's blood samples. there's no evidence of excessive levels of carbon dioxide. or anything else out of ordinary.}
<A>__{a grim laugh from miller.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{of course not. justin just climbed into the airlock because he felt like it. just one of those things.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i swore i'd never lose another man. i came close today. real close.}
<C>__{dj}
<D>__{"another man?" who?}
<A>__{miller nods, pulls his service medal from beneath his jumpsuit.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{it was on the goliath. there was this bosun, corrick, a young guy, a lot like justin. edmund corrick, from decatur, georgia. he got caught when the pressure doors sealed, one closed on his arm. severed it at the wrist. the pain of that must have been... he passed out and...}
<A>__{miller trails off. dj waits patiently. finally:}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i, i tried to go back for him, to save him, but i couldn't get to him in time. the fire... have you ever seen fire in zero gravity? it's like a liquid, it slides over everything. it was like a wave breaking over him, a wave of fire. and then he was gone.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i never told anyone until now. but this ship knew, dj. it knows about the goliath, it knows about corrick. it knows our secrets. it knows what we're afraid of.}
<P>__{(beat, wan smile)}
<D>__{and now you're going to tell me it's carbon dioxide.}
<C>__{dj}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{miller sees something in dj's expression.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{dj}
<D>__{i've been listening to the transmission. and i think houston made a mistake in the translation.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{go on.}
<A>__{dj plays the recording again. stops it abruptly.}
<C>__{dj}
<D>__{they thought it said, "liberatis me," "save me," but it's not "me." it's "tutemet:" "save yourself."}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{it's not a distress call. it's a warning.}
<C>__{dj}
<D>__{it gets worse.}
<A>__{miller stares at him.}
<C>__{dj}
<D>__{it's very hard to make out, but listen to this final part.}
<A>__{he plays the recording again.}
<C>__{dj}
<D>__{do you hear it? right there.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{hear what?}
<C>__{dj}
<D>__{it sounds like "ex infera:" "ex," from; "infera," the ablative case of "inferi." "hell."}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{"save yourself. from hell."}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{what are you saying, are you saying that this ship is possessed?}
<C>__{dj}
<D>__{no. i don't believe in that sort of thing.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but if dr. weir is right, this ship has passed beyond the boundaries of our universe, of reality. who knows where this ship has been... what it's seen...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and what it's brought back with it.}
<A>__{dj looks at miller. he does not have an answer. the intercom}
