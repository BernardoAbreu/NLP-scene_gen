<A>__{he takes another step, and another. each soft as a falling feather. he is a third of the way across the floor his body gleaming with sweat when he steps wrong and the floor sings beneath him. raizo stops, a flash of panic in his eyes. then he subdues the emotion and obediently lifts the offending foot, holds it out as ozunu rises and approaches. ozunu lays open raizo's foot with a bamboo rod. slashing blows that leave deep cuts. raizo's expression hardly changes. ozunu returns to his place, and raizo starts walking again, making no noise, and leaving no trace of his passage... ...except for a trail of small, bloody footprints. flashback interior orphanage dormitory night the same evening. most of the children in this place sleep on mats in the same room. they are exhausted, silent, motionless. we find raizo and though he makes no sound, his eyes show silent tears of pain, his feet still bleeding and bruised. kiriko looks on from her mat for a long, silent beat, knowing the agony he is in. then, as if coming to an inner decision, she reaches under her mat for a leaf into which a thick salve has been folded. she crosses the few feet to raizo's mat and, as he watches in silent agony, she puts her finger to her lips, then kneels down and begins applying the salve to his feet. within moments, we can see the pain leaving his eyes. finishing quickly, she folds the remaining salve back into the leaf, exchanges a quick, furtive glance with raizo, then heads back for her mat. he lays there for a beat, confused as to whether his diminishing pain is a good thing. then he turns to look at kiriko, but she lays with her back to him, apparently asleep. he regards her silently for a moment, then rolls over himself to sleep as we come around to the other side of kiriko, and see that she is very much awake, almost smiling. she closes her eyes.}
