<L>__{interior foster home kitchen day}
<A>__{jacob is feverishly eating a sandwich at the table while karen finishes putting the rest of the food away.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i guess the sandwich is alright, huh?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{it's incredible. best i've ever had.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you're not from around here, are you?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no. i've been on the road for a couple of days.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{do you need a place to stay?}
<A>__{footsteps are heard from below and a couple in their mid thirties enter from the basement door. they're david and mary ross, both greasy and frustrated.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{so, we have to get it fixed.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{we don't have the money to get it fixed.}
<A>__{they both start washing up at the sink, not really noticing the teenagers in the room. karen speaks up.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{our plumbing has a bad case of hardening of the arteries. who's your friend?}
<A>__{david gives jacob a wary glance as the boy stands shakily.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{this is jacob.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{jacob johnson.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{david ross. my wife, mary.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{they run this house. they're helping me and three other ids get a footing in reality before they kick us out of the nest to make room for the next batch.}
<A>__{david is looking out the window at the now dissipating crowd. he lets out a weary sigh.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{if there is a next batch. i see the welcome wagon is back. was there any trouble?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{a little. jacob came to my rescue.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(pleasant)}
<D>__{where you from, jacob?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{springwood.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{springwood? where's that?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{upstate about a hundred miles.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(suspicious)}
<D>__{i know this state like the back of my hand. i've never heard of springwood.}
<A>__{there is an uncomfortable pause. then karen suddenly breaks in.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{jacob's a little down on his luck. i told him he could stay here a few days.}
<A>__{jacob gives here a surprised look.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{are your parents in springwood?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{my father died before i was born. my mother, she's dead, too.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you have a legal guardian?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{been in any state or federal program?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{just for a little while. so he can get his bearings.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{got any id?}
<A>__{jacob reaches for his back pocket it's empty. he shakes his head "no".}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(to david)}
<D>__{i think we can help him out, honey. the budget's tight, but we can't turn down someone in need.}
<A>__{david doesn't acknowledge his wife, he just stares at jacob sternly. karen bites her nails. then david sits down and starts to lecture.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{okay. you got three, maybe four days to rest up while we try and find a more permanent arrangement for you. but his isn't going to be a free ride. we're part of a community summer work project and eighty percent of the money you make goes to the house. everybody works and that includes you. are you on drugs?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{good. if i catch anything stronger then an aspirin on you, you're outta here. no arguments. you got that straight?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{okay. dinner in two hours. why don't you go meet the rest of the gang.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{thanks, david.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{i will go fix up the spare bed in wesley's room.}
<A>__{david gets up. he gives jacob a final once over.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{and take a shower, for chrissakes.}
<A>__{david leaves the room. karen gives jacob a huge grin.}
