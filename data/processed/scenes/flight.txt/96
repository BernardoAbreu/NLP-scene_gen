<L>__{exterior crash site observation scaffolding day}
<A>__{whip joins hugh on a rectangular platform on top of a two story scaffolding frame. the platform provides a perfect view of flight 227's final resting area. we see the awesome devastation that 50 tons of metal flying at 140 miles an hour can do to a hillside.}
<C>__{hugh}
<D>__{you can see the initial impact sheared the right wing clean off. if only the left wing had come off at impact, i think everyone would have walked off that plane.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{the left wing partially pulled away }
<C>__{hugh}
<D>__{it snapped but stayed connected to the airframe. so it whipped back towards the plane, hit the fuselage in front of the tail. if you were sitting in the last 6 or 7 rows on the left side, it was like being hit by a train.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{i drank a lot the night before that flight. i drank that morning too and i used coke to straighten up.}
<C>__{hugh}
<D>__{i know, it's in the toxicology report.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{but that's not the reason this happened.}
<C>__{hugh}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{whip looks at hugh expecting him to finish his thought. hugh holds his look for a beat before changing thoughts.}
<C>__{hugh }
<D>__{the john the baptist pentecostal mission.}
<A>__{we hear voices; a low murmur that gets louder, chanting. whip looks to the top of the hill to see...}
<B>__{pentecostal mass in progress}
<A>__{a minister in a dark purple cloak calls from the new testament as the congregation responds in unison.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{"he will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away." revelation 21:4}
<A>__{there are at least 50 people sitting in white folding chairs at the foot of the hill. a small brook babbles behind them. whip continues to take in the bizarre scene.}
<C>__{hugh}
<D>__{they helped pull survivors out of the wreckage. now they come out here every day and have a mass 30 minutes prior to the crash. and then they sit in silent prayer for 10 minutes at 9:42...which is when you went down.}
<A>__{whip is overwhelmed by the magnitude of the crash field and the worshippers. whip looks back at the crash site to see...}
<C>__{ntsb investigators}
<A>__{inside the crash site, a small group of investigators with ntsb jackets following the lead of a confident woman. hugh answers the question in whip's mind...}
<C>__{hugh }
<D>__{ellen block, she's the head of the investigation for the ntsb. she's the one that's gonna ask the tough questions.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{why'd you bring me here?}
<C>__{hugh}
<D>__{i needed you to see this.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{you trying to scare me?}
<C>__{hugh}
<D>__{i need to know that you can handle all this.}
<A>__{whip continues to stare at the awesome dent in the earth.}
<C>__{hugh }
<D>__{listen clearly. there was a mechanical issue with the plane, but what you and i know? is that this was an act of god. i'm gonna fight to get the ntsb to place "act of god" on the probable causes list.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{who's god would do this?}
<A>__{it's quiet before hugh makes his case.}
<C>__{hugh}
<D>__{so here's the deal. avington carr, the owner of the airline, is on our side...and he's got big friends in washington. he wants to sit down with us. 10 o'clock tomorrow morning.}
<A>__{whip's had enough. he starts to walk away. hugh stops him.}
<C>__{hugh }
<D>__{you can't drink. you're under the microscope. you can't be out buying liquor. no bars, no drugs.}
<C>__{whip}
<D>__{i will stop. i can stop.}
<P>__{(hugh stays quiet)}
<D>__{i told you i can stop. i won't drink.}
<C>__{hugh}
<D>__{10 o'clock tomorrow morning with mr. carr, the owner of the airline.}
