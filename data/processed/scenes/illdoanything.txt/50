<L>__{interior bathroom day}
<A>__{nan uncertainly enters this decidedly masculine bathroom. she is wearing an evening gown. the sun streams through the lush foliage outside a wall sized window. music as she opens her purse and removes a pillbox; at one point lightly singing a snatch of lyric concerning the conflicts of being a single woman and a single mother this while totally focused on the pills. insert pill box a major movie shot of this compartmentalized box. each burrowed nest clearly labeled for the pill it contains: vitamin b, vitamin a, oscillococcinum, prozac, calcium, test drug, aspirin, xanax, etc.}
<B>__{on nan}
<A>__{music continues. she dials a phone number while arching her neck and swallowing one pill after another with little swigs of water. this process continuing, even as she speaks into the phone.}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{monica is leslie up yet? good. i didn't want you to get worried when you realized i wasn't there. i'm still with that man. i will tell you about it later. but it's sure nice to have wobbly legs again. look, today's recycling day for leslie at school, so give her some empty cans... well, then dump some out for her! tell her i had to leave real early for work and i will pick her up at school myself to make up for it and we'll rent any cassette she wants for tonight. thank you... take good care.}
<A>__{she hangs up. another snatch of lyric as she bends to brush her teeth with her finger; prepares herself and opens the door to greet her new lover.}
