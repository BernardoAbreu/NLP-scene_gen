<L>__{interior exterior land cruiser country road day}
<A>__{felix turns off at the entrance to a lane leading to the plantation. the entrance is guarded by a 4x4 "rat patrol" assault truck and four heavily armed elc guerrillas.}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{the e.l.c. guards your coffee beans?}
<A>__{felix thinks he's joking. until he looks over and sees gordy's actually being sincere.}
<C>__{felix}
<D>__{... coffee beans? shit. armstrong didn't tell you much...}
<L>__{interior exterior land cruiser plantation day}
<A>__{they approach a hacienda and outbuildings. the accoutrements of agriculture are present tractors, sheds, cats, etc. but clearly, this is no family farm. there are lots of serious looking men around. more elc guerrillas stand guard.}
<B>__{felix}
<A>__{stops the car. he and gordy get out. felix begins leading gordy toward two rows of long, open walled sheds.}
<C>__{felix}
<D>__{the problem's with the diesel generators. the sons of bitches keep breaking down.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{they pass four very large pits, where green leaves steep in a thick, foul smelling liquid.}
<C>__{felix}
<D>__{we're using portables to keep production going, but they don't supply enough power to the heat lamps, and we have to dry a lot of... 'coffee beans.'}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{they're now walking between the two rows of sheds, where portable gas generators thrum, and... gordy can see long, wide platforms inside. above the platforms are multiple arrays of powerful heat lamps. spread out and drying beneath them is a half acre or two of converted cocaine.}
<B>__{in another shed}
<A>__{workers pack and wrap one kilo bricks of coke for shipment.}
<B>__{gordy and felix}
<A>__{approach the two giant diesel generators.}
<C>__{felix}
<D>__{we can fix anything, but these keep dying on us... you'll start now. i will have tools brought to you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{armstrong's a magician with them. let's hope you have his skill.}
<A>__{felix walks over to a guerrilla with an ak 47 and speaks to him. then goes. whereupon the guerrilla crosses to gordy and takes up a sentry position over him. same scene later gordy has the diesels partially dismantled. the guerrilla sentry is still right there. felix returns.}
<C>__{felix}
<D>__{well?}
<A>__{gordy has to think of something fast. beat. he throws a machine part against a wall angrily.}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{i can't work with these pieces of junk.}
<C>__{felix}
<D>__{junk? these generators cost a fortune.}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{then treat them that way.}
<C>__{felix}
<P>__{(beat, then)}
<D>__{armstrong always fixes them.}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{armstrong wants your money. he makes them work, but he doesn't fix them... to do this right, we gotta order parts from europe. in the meantime, i can make something temporary. there must be a machine shop in town.}
<C>__{felix}
<D>__{... yes.}
<A>__{gordy stands.}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{off felix, forced to acquiesce...}
