<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i put a memo on your desk about the christmas party this friday.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{is it that time already?}
<A>__{derek picks up the memo and scans it.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{why don't they invite spouses?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{how's that?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{to the christmas party. it says "for employees only."}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{it's like that in most companies. they think people are more inhibited in front of their spouses, less likely to kick back and enjoy themselves and mingle with co workers, which is what the party is about.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{so, does this party get pretty wild?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{just the opposite.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{well that's no fun.}
<A>__{derek notices a container of starbucks coffee.}
<C>__{lisa }
<D>__{icalled patrick. he said you like it black with two sugars.}
<A>__{derek is impressed. he opens the container.}
<C>__{lisa }
<D>__{if it's cold, i can run down and nuke it in the break room.}
<C>__{derek}
<P>__{(takes a sip)}
<D>__{no, it's perfect.}
<A>__{lisa is pleased. she raises her pad and pencil.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{fire away.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{well, it's monday and first thing on monday...}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i took care of that.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{took care of what?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{on mondays you always send your wife a dozen long stemmed red roses.}
<P>__{(off derek's look of surprise)}
<D>__{i called to confirm they've been delivered.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i think that's incredibly sweet. how long have you two been married?}

<D>__{and you still send her flowers every monday morning? lucky girl.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{it's kind of a tradition.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{patrick said you started sending them back when beth worked here as your assistant. is that how you won her heart?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{well, it took a little more than roses.}
<P>__{(getting down to business)}
