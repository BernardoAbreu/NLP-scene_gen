<A>__{kathy works, angry, urgent now. on her desk... closer: report: photo id line up. kathy matches circled id photos of iptf alongside testimony and polaroids of girls. she works fast. circling the photos, slapping files closed. when a... mail boy slides in a cart, and places a stack of reports on kathy's in box. she pulls the first one off the top... a sticky note on the first page: insufficient evidence. kathy grabs another... sticky note: unreliable witness. she sees the name nadia at the top of the statement. she grabs... another: unreliable witness. and another... transferred to internal affairs. kathy flies through the rest of the files. one after another: insufficient evidence insufficient evidence transferred to internal affairs unreliable witnesses insufficient a photo falls out of one of them: raya. kathy stares at it. her eyes wander over the room, and fall on her predecessor's battered old file boxes, still waiting for archives. she moves to them. cuts the string on the top box. rips the top off. inside... report files. slotted in tight. she grabs one. sticky note: insufficient evidence.}
