<L>__{interior dupea home staircase day}
<B>__{on bobby}
<A>__{quickly descending the staircase, and following with him as he moves to the music room and goes inside, leaving the door open.}
<L>__{interior music room day}
<A>__{he crosses to one of the grands, seats himself and rubs his hands together to warm them. then, scanning his mental repertoire, he places his hands on the keyboard and begins to play a chopin etude. presently, catherine appears in the doorway. she stands listening for a moment, then places the shopping bag and flowers on a settee near the doorway and crosses to a chair near the pianos and sits down. bobby glances at her, then returns his eyes to the keyboard.}
<B>__{on catherine}
<A>__{her features intensely concentrated, as she listens to his playing.}
<B>__{on bobby}
<A>__{apparently deep into the music. on the wall behind him are the series of photographs seen in the opening and the present angle favors an 8 year old bobby in his dress suit, playing a recital. the camera moves down to his hands... ... then to catherine, profoundly moved.}
<B>__{angle including both}
<A>__{as bobby plays the concluding chords of the etude. he lets his hands linger on the keys until the last overtones fade, then he removes them to his lap. after a brief silence:}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{that was beautiful, robert. i'm surprised...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i was really very moved by the way you...}
<A>__{unable to keep up the "serious" musician pose, a brief, derisive laugh issues from him.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{is that funny?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{it wasn't supposed to be, it just struck me that way.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{nothing. it's just that... i picked the easiest piece i could remember. i think i first played it when i was 8 years old and i played it better then.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{it doesn't matter. it was the feeling i was affected by.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i didn't have any.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{you had no inner feeling?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{none.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{then i must have been supplying it.}
<A>__{she gets up and crosses toward the settee.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{wait...}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{well, at least you're accomplished at something...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{at being a fake.}
<A>__{and as she picks up the flowers and the shopping bag:}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{catherine...}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{no, you're very good at it. i'm really impressed.}
<A>__{she goes out the door. bobby looks down at the keyboard. he closes the cover and softly utters:}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{shit.}
