<A>__{heroin in a spoon.) another photo depicts an 8 year old girl's birthday party. (in the reflection of this photo see wee nicole tying off.) a last photo shows nicole (30)and her mom (54). they are both wearing kerchiefs. we can see that her mom is gaunt and has no hair under her kerchief. (in the reflection of this photo we see the needle injected into her arm.) a hypodermic needle is placed in front of that picture. next to the photos is a small cd station that nicole taps to life and turns up. the opening bars of michael fitzpatrick's "medication" begin to play. we pull wide to see nicole pull the bra from her arm that she used to tie off with. her face is pure happiness. clothes and a peach crate filled with camera equipment join a suitcase on its side that acts as a coffee table. nicole picks up her camera and admires it before putting it down. she picks up the cigarette she had staged pre dope fix and reaches for the lighter. she laughs and hums, pulls out gum, a brush...she's holding the brush when the first heavy wave of narcotic death washes over her. she leans back and uses the wall for support. "medication" is hitting its chorus...}

<D>__{oh man...}
<A>__{she puts her arms out at her sides, euphoria. a slow, sloppy smile breaks across her face. she exhales slowly. she reaches for the now burning cigarette when the second wave of heavy drugs hits. nicole looks up with fear.}
<D>__{nicole (cont'd) (cont'd) oh no, oh no, oh no...}
<A>__{she reaches for the little bag of coke that kip gave her. next she grabs her phone, flipping it open. as she tries to dial it, she crumbles to her knees. nicole somewhat controls her fall to the ground, but her eyes are fading. the little bag of coke falls from her fingers. there's no way to stem the tide of the oncoming overdose. nicole's arms stretch out in a frozen reach as her body sinks to the floor. on her back like a girl making angels in the snow as her eyelids flutter, she slips away. we hear a pounding on the door. fran is on the other side...}
