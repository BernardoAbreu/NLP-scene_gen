<L>__{exterior. the green mountains day}
<A>__{w h i t e rock blanketed by stands of fir and ponderosa pine. a whisper skims over the treecaps, circling in on a high shelf. here, remotely nestled in a clearing, stands a glass villa.}
<L>__{interior. the glass villa day}
<A>__{the flood of light, the majestic view lend an air of beatitude. the decor is minimalist with native american accents, kokopelli spirits in carved silhouette. dr. sanger stands at a glass wall, looking out across the green mountain valley. on the sofa sits merrick, now in civvies, still gaunt from worry. the air stirs as a maid ushers in a woman 30's, all business, sharp blue eyes, a severe, mannish coiffure. her name is ellen crowne.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{good morning, gentlemen.}
<C>__{sanger}
<D>__{bernard, this is ellen crowne from our legal department. ellen, this is bernard merrick, director of products.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{thank you for coming out here.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{well when henry called me i got the sense it wasn't for a social visit.}
<A>__{they settle at a table. a jug of icewater a n d glasses laid out.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{i understand there was an incident?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{first, let me stress there's no way we could have anticipated what happened...}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{we're on the same team, mr. merrick. just give me the facts down and dirty.}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(uneasy, clears his throat)}
<D>__{we'v e lost two of our products. they escaped containment last night.}
<A>__{crowne casts a troubled look at sanger. merrick quickly adds }
<P>__{merrick (cont'd)}
<D>__{however, we have all available resources dedicated to the search.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{how exactly did this happen?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{we'r e still piecing it together.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{do we expect more products to escape?}
<C>__{dr. sanger}
<D>__{don't be so alarmist, ellen.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{i'm sorry, henry, but you asked me here to assess our liabilities.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{to answer your question, we condition our products with a deterrent. a fear of contamination. and thereby of the outer environment. so to escape, they first have to escape their conditioning.}
<A>__{crowne pauses to absorb this and to light a slim black cigarette.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{containment is one of the terms of our state health license. the fact it was compromised could put us in violation.}
<C>__{dr. sanger}
<D>__{bureaucracy.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{henry , it was a bloody battle getting our license through in the first place.}
<C>__{dr. sanger}
<D>__{they're not going to pull our license, ellen. we have a lot of friends on the commission. not to mention the goodwill we earned in dc when we took over the facility; a bunker complex for a bio chemical war that never happened... we relieved them of a costly embarrassment.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{i'm not sure we can rely on that.}
<C>__{dr. sanger}
<D>__{alright . what do you suggest?}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{first, i need you to level with me. what are our chances of finding them?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{well, in our favor, they've never been outside containment. they'd have no coordinates, no sense of direction.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{i don't see how that's in our favor.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{they're in the middle of the desert. food and water become an issue.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{so they might return to the trough?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{possibly.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{and if not? how long could they last?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{a few days maybe. but there is another variable. we maintain the products in a sterile environment. so basically their immune systems are untested. toxins, pathogens, environmentals t h e rest of us overcome routinely, to them...}
<C>__{dr. sanger}
<D>__{that's a little drastic. some immune systems are more adaptive than others.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{let's take the drastic case. what then?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{well . . . the male, we could cover. fast track another generation before the sponsor ever needed access. the female comes under the maternity plan. she's three months pregnant. even if we fast tracked another generation, we couldn't fast track the pregnancy. we'd miss the delivery date, the sponsor would wonder why and there would be... difficulties.}
<A>__{crowne looks worried. sanger pours a glass of icewater.}
<C>__{dr. sanger}
<D>__{even so, the worst may not happen.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{we haven't even touched on the worst. if these products reach a populated area, there's the problem of scrutiny.}
<C>__{dr. sanger}
<D>__{ellen , we operate under state license on a lease from the federal government...}
<C>__{crowne}
<P>__{( c u t s him off, harshly)}
<D>__{we slipped through a loophole in the clone laws, henry. and they only let u s through because they smelt money. and they gave us a government basement to cover their own a s s e s not ours. it's at the core of our license why we screen potential sponsors, why we make them sign discretion agreements, why containment is such a critical factor to limit the extent of public scrutiny.}
<C>__{dr. sanger}
<D>__{e i t h e r way, it's unlikely they'd get that far. it's at least twenty miles to the next settlement. right, bernard?}
<A>__{merrick hesitates before nodding his assent. crowne pounces on it }
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{something to add, mr. merrick?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{i just don't think we should under estimate them. especially the male.}
<C>__{dr. sanger}
<D>__{and i don't think we should panic.}
<A>__{he cautions merrick with a discreet look, then shakes a pill from a bottle. crowne looks forward to both men. very serious.}
<C>__{crowne}
<D>__{gentlemen, whatever happens we need t o keep one thing clearly in mind. as far as the world at large goes, we are just another medical services company. anything that alters that perception puts us at risk. and we cannot rely on the sanction of the law to protect us. whenever and wherever and in whatever condition we recover these products, we have to stay beyond reproach. all it takes is one nudge to put us in the spotlight. then you'll see how fast politicians can run for cover.}
<A>__{merrick shifts, uneasy. sanger takes the pill with a bitter smile }
<C>__{dr. sanger}
<D>__{i n other words we need to find them o r else. that's very astute, ellen.}
