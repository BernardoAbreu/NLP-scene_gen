<A>__{tom and chrissie are separated from the others, silhouetted against the fire, she pauses and looks at the ocean, he is plodding along in the sand, winded. chrissie runs down the slope of the dune towards the water, leaving tom reeling atop the dune. as she runs, she is shedding her clothes. tom is trying to trail her by her clothes, like hansel following bread crumbs through the woods. but chrissie is way ahead of him.}

<D>__{c'mon!}
<A>__{she runs headlong into the inviting sea, plunges cleanly into the water with a light "whoops!" as the cold water sweeps over her. behind all this, we continue to hear the sentimental, beery chorus of alma maters. then we see it a gentle bulge in the water, a ripple that passes her a dozen feet away. a pressure wave lifts her up, then eases her down again, like a smooth, sudden swell.}
<C>__{chrissie}
<D>__{tommy? don't dunk me...}
<A>__{she looks around for him, finds him still on the beach, his feet tangled in his pants, which have dropped around his ankles. she starts to swim back in to him.}
