<A>__{pamela sits by the pool, arms clasped around her, looking at the stars. the pink and green of the hotel shimmers in the water making it look like a chalk painting.}

<L>__{exterior goff house allora late afternoon}
<A>__{ginty sits on the front step of the porch, arms clasped around her body, face to the sky. the sounds of the evening closes in crickets, the last deafening chorus of the birds. travers walks up the path to their home, trailing his suit jacket over his shoulder, his shirt and tie loosened. his shirtsleeves are marked with sweat. his face is a study of something close to despair. he looks up to see pamela sitting on the front step and immediately arranges his features into a bright smile of greeting.}

<D>__{don't leave yourself always searching for something }
<A>__{he coughs to stop a crying jag and leaves her alone on the porch. ginty is unnerved by her travers' demeanor, she creeps around to the side of the house where she watches her father appears in the window of the washroom. she doesn't know what to do as he leans his head against the wall and breaks down sobbing.}
