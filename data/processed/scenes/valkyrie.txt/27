<A>__{stauffenberg and nina dance with one another to the delight of the children. we gradually push in tight on their faces, watching an entire conversation take place without dialogue. each has a secret the other can guess. stauffenberg looks at nina, then her belly, first realizing and then questioning. nina smiles and nods. stauffenberg hugs her, delighted, but his delight is tainted with worry. then the tables turn. nina looks at stauffenberg, as if divining his secret. his face never changes a statue with that same tainted smile. in her face we see slow, grim realization. she may not know exactly what is going on, but she knows it is something. she does her best to keep smiling for the children. after the longest of moments, she nods. "all right." then she puts her head on his shoulder, hiding her fears. it is an important moment. read it again, taking the time to picture it in your mind. then leave it alone. done right it's a beautiful scene about a man, his family and the fate of the world.}
