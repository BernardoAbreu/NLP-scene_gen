<L>__{exterior grounds later}
<A>__{amelia and sam walk a wooded path beside the grounds. through the chain link fence, they watch other social workers playing with groups of children.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{and it's a secret.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{has to be. competition, you know. millionaire heiresses, hot shot girl pilots. if george knew i told you, he'd have me publicly flogged.}
<A>__{she looks over.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{so long as he could sell tickets.}
<A>__{he's not smiling.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{and no one else knows.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{marion. she's giving me a leave of absence.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i would think so. your name will be in all the papers, and not just boston. denison house stands to come in for funding, national attention.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{specially if i don't make it.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{don't joke about that.}
<A>__{she wasn't joking at all.}
<P>__{sam (cont’d)}
<D>__{you'll make it. and then you'll have opportunities to work in aviation. anywhere you want.}
<A>__{she laughs.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{well, i’ll have impressive credentials as a long distance passenger. that’s not exactly a career in aviation.}
<A>__{she looks up at his eyes.}
<P>__{amelia (cont’d)}
<D>__{i'm not going anywhere, social work is my life. after all the years of false starts, i found the thing i'm meant to do.}
<A>__{keep walking. she gives him time to say...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{and where does that leave us?}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{you do love to look on the dark side. whatever did you see in a sunny character like me?}
<A>__{she gives him a sweet playful smile. it doesn't reassure him.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it's not as if i'd been putting pressure on you.}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{what love means to you. what it requires. is the pressure.}
<A>__{he stops walking.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i love you. is that such a terrible problem?}
<A>__{she gazes at him. can he even hear this?}
<C>__{amelia}
<D>__{the problem is what it's always been. the problem is me.}
