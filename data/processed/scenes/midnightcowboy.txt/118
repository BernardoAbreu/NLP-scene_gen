<D>__{shuttle. follow the green light.}
<A>__{automatically,checking the trough of a gum vending machine, joe unexpectedly faces himself in the mirror, the eyes staring at him tired and hopeless. his hand reaches unconsciously for a cigarette, the package is empty. he crumples it in his fist but holds it.}
