<L>__{interior pyramid sacrificial chamber}
<A>__{lex leads the team into the next chamber. their flashlights illuminate a large chamber with an impressive vaulted ceiling and bizarre ancient imagery chiseled into the walls. seven mummified cadavers lay on}
<B>__{seven long stone slabs.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{these are...}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{sacrificial slabs.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{just like the aztecs and the egyptians. whoever built this pyramid believed in ritual sacrifice.}
<C>__{miller}
<P>__{(studying cadaver)}
<D>__{it's almost perfectly preserved.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{this is where they offered the "chosen ones" to the gods.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{those that were chosen would lie here. they weren't bound or tied in any way. they went to their deaths willingly. men and women. it was considered an honor.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{lucky them.}
<A>__{she runs her fingers around a circular, bowl like indentation at the base of the slab.}
<C>__{lex }
<D>__{what's this bowl for?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{some think it's where the heart was placed after it was torn from the body.}
<A>__{weyland's flashlight illuminates a stone grate on the bottom of the floor with small holes in it. max strikes a flare and drops it in one of the holes. it falls but hits something below.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{what have you found max?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{it's a shaft to another level. looks like another room down there.}
<A>__{weyland illuminates a huge pile of human bones. many of the skeletons are still intact.}
<C>__{weyland}
<D>__{there must be a hundred people there.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{at least.}
<A>__{the others cluster around the mountain of bleached bones. thomas examines some hieroglyphics written on the edge of a sacrificial slab.}
<C>__{thomas}
<P>__{(translating)}
<D>__{they gave their lives ... so that the hunt might begin.}
<C>__{rousseau }
<D>__{what happened here?}
<A>__{rousseau is examining the ribcage of a skeleton. a hole has been punched through the bones.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{it was common in ritual sacrifice to take the heart of the victim.}
<C>__{rousseau}
<D>__{that's not where your heart is. besides, it looks like the bones were bent straight out. something broke out of this body.}
<A>__{everyone reacts to rousseau's words. thomas finds something amongst the bones.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{incredible. the entire skull and spinal column removed in one piece.}
<A>__{he holds it up for everyone to see.}
<C>__{miller }
<D>__{the cleanness of the cut... remarkable. straight through bone. no abrasions.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{did you hear that?}
<A>__{the entire team looks around and then looks at lex. mystery pov: sebastian and thomas can be seen isolated in a pool of light. they suddenly look very small and vulnerable as they stand away from the rest of the team. we hear a noise. faint, nearly imperceptible, but there.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{air... moving through the tunnels.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i don't know. maybe.}
<A>__{sebastian moves forward. cautiously edging his way toward the source of the noise. the team shines their flashlights, they cut through the gloom like lasers as they illuminate the chamber. sebastian casts multiple shadows on the walls around him. if anything, the lights are making it even creepier. miller starts to handle one of the spinal columns hanging on the wall.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<P>__{(to miller)}
<D>__{be careful with that.}
<A>__{sebastian has to crouch as the ceiling of the back of the chamber slopes down dramatically. around sebastian, everything is claustrophobic and dark. something falls from above and lands on sebastian. it's a creature with multiple legs and a long tail. sebastian fights it away from his face. he falls to the ground, and the creature is gone. lex spots it on the ground. sebastian and lex walk up and kneel by the creature. it's an alien "face hugger".}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{whatever it is, it's been dead a while. the bones have calcified.}
<A>__{he tests the legs of the face hugger. they are rock solid.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{you must have dislodged it from a crack in the ceiling.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{no idea how long it's been here but the temperature has kept it preserved. looks like some kind of scorpion.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{no. climate's too hostile for a scorpion.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{ever seen anything like it?}
<A>__{she turns the face hugger over in her hands, studies it and shakes her head.}
<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{maybe it's a species that's never been discovered.}
<A>__{lex looks at it again. concerned and unsure.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{maybe.}
<A>__{lex illuminates another passage. now inside and overdressed, lex takes off her jacket.}
<C>__{lex }
<D>__{the ambient temperature in here is a lot warmer than ground level. you can take off your jackets.}
<A>__{sebastian, miller, weyland, connors, max, rousseau and thomas begin to remove their jackets.}
<C>__{weyland}
<P>__{(to max)}
<D>__{time to move on. let's move to that lower room max.}
<A>__{max turns to the group.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{time to move out everybody. ms. woods?}
<A>__{max motions to lex to take the lead. sebastian, miller, weyland and connors follow lex down a tunnel. hanging back momentarily, max gives instructions to thomas and rousseau.}
<C>__{max }
<P>__{(to thomas)}
<D>__{you, stay here.}
<P>__{(to rousseau)}
<D>__{rousseau, stay with him. keep a team with you.}
<P>__{(to thomas)}
<D>__{catalog everything.}
<P>__{(to everyone)}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{max leaves thomas and rousseau behind and joins the others. thomas takes out his digital video camera.}
