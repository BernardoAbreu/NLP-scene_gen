<A>__{the bike riding vamps cut across traffic, then scream down an on ramp to a busy street below. back to blade, sprinting from the parking lot to the sidewalk. he touches a hand to his ear. we see a tiny receiver tucked within.}

<D>__{got it! heading eastbound, i'm just beneath you }
<A>__{blade dodges past a honking car, stepping onto and over the trunk, then leaps atop the safety rail of the overpass as a big rig cab hauling a semi trailer thunders beneath the overpass, sounding its air horn. it has safety cables running along the perimeter of the trailer roof, like an aircraft carrier.}
