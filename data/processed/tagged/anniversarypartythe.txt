<A>__{"the anniversary party" by alan cumming & jennifer jason leigh}
<T>__{fade in:}
<A>__{tight close joe therrian morning he's in his mid thirties, his face relaxed in sleep, childlike. nestled soundly a tangle in the arms of his wife. the camera stays close. slightly blurred, soft, slowly}
<B>__{swings round}
<A>__{tight close sally therrian she's in her mid thirties, with large deep eyes. she watches her husband unguarded in sleep. her pretty face, alert, she's barely breathing. traces the just visible lines around his eyes, and mouth. brushes fingertips against his eyelashes. tight close sally's hand pulls the bedroom shade. it retracts with a loud whack, sun, sky, trees.}
<C>__{steven }
<D>__{and breath...and chataronga...}
<L>__{exterior pool area day}
<A>__{we're in the middle of a yoga lesson. joe and sally stand on their mats. steven, their instructor, wanders around the couple issuing soft spoken instructions. a large room with hard wood floors, dominated by a huge fireplace. the dining room on one side, living room on the other. floor to ceiling windows overlook the back porch garden pool... the house is classic neutra. all glass and}
<B>__{smooth lines.}
<A>__{the calm is broken by the telephone. joe and sally ignore it until the answering machine picks up. they break their yoga poses and listen. the camera hovers over the answering machine.}
<C>__{lucy }
<P>__{(over answering machine; sweet, british, slightly desperate)}
<D>__{joe, it's lucy. remember me? it's the black sheep here. bah...not funny. haven't heard from you, need you, call me. love you madly. hi, sally. joe, i'd love to talk to you before i go...}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{go where?}
<C>__{lucy }
<P>__{(over answering machine)}
<D>__{it's a damn nuisance you aren't here, big brother. sorry i drone on. i miss you. i lo }
<A>__{the machine cuts her off.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{joe and sally have resumed their positions. this wasn't the call they were waiting for.}
<B>__{wide shot}
<A>__{america, forty one, and rosa, fifty, struggle up the steps of the back porch carrying grocery bags and packages, come through the sliding glass door...}
<B>__{the camera follows them}
<A>__{through the dining room and into the kitchen, watches the two unpack groceries, flowers, etc., and start to dress the dining room table. they speak quietly to each other in spanish.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{america, could you just...}
<A>__{america closes the sliding doors between the kitchen and the dining room, giving the couple their privacy.}
<C>__{joe }
<P>__{(calls out)}
<D>__{thank you, america!}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{okay, let's just take a deep breath, let your ribs expand and relax. and reach up and into downward dog.}
<A>__{otis, the bisenji sheperd mix, sleeping on his leopard pillow, stirs, stretches and groans.}
<C>__{joe and sally}
<D>__{good boy, otis.}
<A>__{the phone rings again.}
<C>__{voice }
<P>__{(over answering machine)}
<D>__{hello, i have dr. harmon calling for sally therrian.}
<A>__{sally jumps out of the down dog position and runs to the phone, all angles.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{hello, hi, hi...and? thank god.}
<A>__{sally stands with the phone to her ear, her back to joe.}
<L>__{exterior pool area continuous}
<A>__{joe watches her from his position, not concentrating on the teacher waiting a sign. sally returns to the lesson. they do their handstands against the wall, on either side of the front door.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{no luck.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{oh, well, we'll just have to try again. sound like a plan?}
<A>__{sally nods, she and joe, at steven's instructions, come out of their handstands and lie on the floor in a stretched relax, facing one another.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{happy anniversary, baby.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{happy anniversary.}
<A>__{they smile.}
<C>__{steven}
<D>__{and change sides...}
<A>__{america slides open the dining room doors. the dining table is covered with bundles of freshly cut flowers. rosa is singing in spanish.}
<C>__{america}
<P>__{(with the authority of long years of service)}
<D>__{mr. joe, we have to have the house. if you please now...}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{it's yours.}
<A>__{the camera glances off photos of the couple: portraits and candids, their wedding day, with friends, on vacation, tumbling on the lawn, and the like. some framed and hung, some taped to the fridge or simply leaning on a shelf. it's clear that at least a handful are by the same photographer, black and whites, grainy and beautiful. there are lots of photos of joe and his sister lucy, documenting their relationship from childhood. there's an annie leibowitz photo shoot of sally carelessly displayed somewhere.}
<L>__{interior bedroom later}
<A>__{joe stands behind sally in front of the full length mirror, his arms around her, stroking her belly.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i love you. most beautiful woman in the world.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{hardly...}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{accept a compliment.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.}
<A>__{they move toward the bed.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what did you get me?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{in the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us.}
<A>__{she pushes him on the bed.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{kiss my eyes.}
<A>__{she does.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{my wrists.}
<A>__{he does.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{kiss the back of my knees.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{through the sweats or not?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{not.}
<A>__{she pulls down his sweats. she kisses the back of his knees. he turns, stares up at her.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?}
<A>__{sally shakes her head.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{no. did you?}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{no. i missed that.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i missed all of you. we're okay, aren't we?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{we're great.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i mean, you're really back.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{for good.}
<A>__{they begin to make love...the phone rings.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{don't get it.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{well, it might be clair. they're threatening not to come...}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{they can't find a sitter...}
<P>__{(into the receiver)}
<D>__{hello? excuse me? yes, uh, hold on.}
<P>__{(she looks at joe)}
<D>__{just a moment.}
<P>__{(puts the call on hold)}
<D>__{it's skye davidson. she needs directions to the house. you invited skye fucking davidson to our anniversary party?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{okay. i'm sorry, look, i meant to tell you. it was the only chance i had to meet her.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{you invited her to our anniversary party? i didn't even invite my mother.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{she goes on location tomorrow. sally, i'm sorry. look, i can't keep her on hold.}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(pissed)}
<D>__{no, no of course not. it's skye fucking davidson, for fuck's sake.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(regards her)}
<D>__{you want me to uninvite her?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{no, no of course not. how old is she? twenty fucking two?}
<A>__{she gets out of bed, starts into the bathroom. the camera is with her.}
<C>__{sally }
<P>__{(into the bathroom mirror)}
<D>__{and she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(into the receiver)}
<D>__{skye!}
<P>__{(his face lights)}
<D>__{i'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.}
<P>__{(flattered)}
<D>__{you read the book again? well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. we tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again. if you're coming from laurel, you want to take sunset west, we're just past will rogers state park. three blocks west of that, you want to hang right. it's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.}
<A>__{sally's started the bath, and is watching him from the doorway. he meets her eyes mid sentence.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{oh? i don't think tonight. i'm sure they're well behaved. all our friends have dogs, and they always want to bring them. we'd be outnumbered, you see? so we sort of put a ban on it. sorry.}
<A>__{he rolls his eyes. sally walks back into the bathroom, she isn't buying it.}
<D>__{joe (o.s.) (cont'd) i'm looking forward to meeting you, too. and skye, i'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. eternally grateful, really.}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(into the bathroom mirror)}
<D>__{i'm going to throw up.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{i can't imagine anyone else playing genna.}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(sanguine)}
<D>__{really?}
<L>__{interior bedroom later}
<A>__{the doorbell rings. there are two closed doors on either side of the room. the bed shows no sign of consummated sex. joe comes through the left hand door, nearly dressed.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{who the fuck can be here at this time? it's not even seven!}
<A>__{sally comes through the other door, one shoe off, one on.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{oh jesus, who else is always early for christ's sake?}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{sally kisses his cheek on her way to the door.}
<C>__{sally }
<D>__{promise you'll be nice to the neighbors.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i will say as little as possible.}
<A>__{sally exits the bedroom.}
<B>__{hold on joe}
<A>__{for a moment, then sally re enters, kisses him deeply.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i love you.}
<L>__{interior foyer early evening}
<A>__{the house is filled with exquisite flower arrangements, candles everywhere. jerry and judy adams are on the porch, just beyond the glass of the front door. their argument is inaudible. they're in their mid thirties, conservatively dressed. she's stunning, genetically nervous. jerry carries a briefcase. she's got the gift. sally opens the door. hugs and buses them, hello.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i know we're early, we're so early. sorry.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{you have to sign your taxes anyway.}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(a grin)}
<D>__{of course we do.}
<P>__{(to judy)}
<D>__{we have to sign our taxes.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(kisses judy; all charm)}
<D>__{you can never be too early or too thin.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{happy anniversary, buddy! six months ago, who would have thunk it?}
<A>__{jerry hugs joe.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{well, not me, to be honest.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{don't fuck up again. it's got a ripple effect. sally suffers, we all suffer.}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(offers)}
<D>__{we have a gift?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{thanks, i will take that. champagne?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{lovely.}
<A>__{joe moves toward the kitchen.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(a moment, to sally)}
<D>__{we closed.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{fantastic.}
<P>__{(takes his hand)}
<D>__{out here.}
<A>__{they step out onto the porch. judy's left alone, unsure whether to follow or not.}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(finally, to no one, and to no response)}
<D>__{the house looks beautiful, are those hydrangeas?}
<A>__{she stands awkwardly in the middle of the foyer.}
<L>__{exterior porch continuous}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{joe officially owns no. 4, cheyenne walk, chelsea, london, england. no small doing.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i love you, you're a genius.}
<A>__{behind them, in the foyer, judy wanders aimlessly.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i suppose. sally, that's quite a gift. i'm not sure it's in your best interest.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i adore him.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{the realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning. the house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the london flat.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i know. i know that. don't spoil it.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{what you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in london, it's an outrageously expensive city.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{we've only been over this how many times?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{you only made half your quote this year.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{well, you're a tower of support.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i worry because you don't. it's my job. i'm feeling guilty. i would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground.}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(direct, simple)}
<D>__{we couldn't be on more solid ground.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{whatever you say. listen, i love you.}
<A>__{otis is barking.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{otis! no barking!}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(touched)}
<D>__{and joe's huge in europe. he's like a rock star in london. his novels sell millions.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{not millions.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{he's directing now.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{they're paying him scale.}
<A>__{the camera catches sight of joe behind them. he moves through the foyer and into the living room with a tray of glasses and judy in tow.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{he gets huge advances on his novels. he's going back to that. you know how he hates it here.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{there's still time to undo this.}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(kisses his cheek)}
<D>__{we'll be fine.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(re: barking dog)}
<D>__{did you invite them?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{the roses? and of course they said yes.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{that was the plan. and you're thrilled to have them.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{whatever you say.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{did you tell joe to behave?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{did he promise?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{scout's honor.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{before i forget.}
<P>__{(pulls a novel from his briefcase)}
<D>__{put it on the bookshelf.}
<A>__{she flips the book on the back is a full page picture of}
<B>__{ryan rose.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{you're out of your mind.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{just do what i say, alright?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{how much bowing and scraping do you want us to do?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{beats a lawsuit.}
<L>__{interior living room continuous}
<A>__{joe and judy sit on opposite sides of the sofa slightly uncomfortable with each other.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(to fill the silence, conspiratorial grin)}
<D>__{i love gifts. what did you guys get us?}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(chokes on the champagne)}
<D>__{nothing that can't be exchanged.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{oh. well. good.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{congratulations on the deal. how exciting. is sally doing sally? i mean it's sally. the character that's based on sally. the character that's based on sally in the book.}

<D>__{the novel. no, skye davidson is playing the lead.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{oh my god, i'm a huge skye davidson fan. she's very beautiful.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yes, she is.}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(trying harder)}
<D>__{but i am right, yes? she's based on sally.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{it's a novel.}

<D>__{still. well. let's drop it.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yes.}

<D>__{i'm not much of a reader, but i do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes. mostly non fiction. did you read the new styron?}

<D>__{it's very good.}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{i understand you won the booker prize.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{yes i did.}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(another moment)}
<D>__{is your script much like the novel? jerry says it's very good. but you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie and most of the time you say, "what's this?" you know? i sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all. because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going. don't you find?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{don't i find what?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i don't know why joe, we've known each other how long...}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{not long.}

<D>__{oh fuck you, and fuck monica while you're at it. but i guess that's what i interrupted.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{jesus, sally. you are a medical miracle. the only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{yeah, let's talk about that. you seem to be rather an expert. i don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.}

<C>__{joe}
<D>__{sally, so i took a few pills. i went out dancing. i tried to forget how upset i was about splitting up with you. i haven't lied to you. i told you about the people i've slept with. i just didn't mention the few occasions i took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental i knew i'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me. sally, we're back, i love you. trust that. please let's not do this.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{otis! come! good boy! come!}
<C>__{joe}

<C>__{joe}
<D>__{do i want anyone else? no. do i want to be with you for the rest of my natural life? i'm trying.}

<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i don't look my age, joe.}

<D>__{sally, i have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it. and you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{it's a shit novel anyway.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well there you go. i let you off the hook. you're one goddamn lucky actress.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{not really. i mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch. that's what all our friends think, anyway.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{okay. if we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. because i don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore. and the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in. that you don't have... oh christ, sally.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{who? who? who thinks that?}
<C>__{joe}
