<A>__{gib comes out first with helen. she struggles like a wildcat, frankly surprising the hell out of harry. simon is brought out, dazed and compliant. helen whips around, kneeing gib right in the balls. gib oophs and doubles over, and helen runs for it. harry leaves simon with the other agents and runs after helen. she sprints through the trees, harry pounding after her. he grabs her and gets her in a headlock. she bites the hell out of his arm. harry yells and lets her go, just as keough runs up and matter of factly clips her on the head with his weapon. standard operating procedure. which is why he can't understand why harry punches him, knocking him down. harry supports a sagging helen, gesturing sharply to the other agents and going rrrrr rrrr to make his point (since he can't talk without her recognizing his voice). they head for the cars.}
