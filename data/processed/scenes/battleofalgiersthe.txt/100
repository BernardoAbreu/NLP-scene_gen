<L>__{99 commissioner's office. press room and stairway. inside. day.}
<A>__{noise, confusion in the commissioner's office press room, ticking of the teletype machines, throngs of journalists in the telephone room. they are trying to transmit the first news.}
<B>__{varied voices.}
<A>__{shouting in every language is heard.}
<C>__{a journalist}
<D>__{we are now in the fourth day and the strike continues, with total support by the arab population. the city is very calm. however calm ... are you deaf? the city is peaceful. in the moslem quarters, in the outskirts of the city, in the casbah ... bye, will call again, i'm busy.}
<A>__{through the open door, mathieu can be seen passing, accompanied by another officer. some journalists see him, and rush behind him. some others follow, four or five in all, trying to stop him.}
<C>__{journalists}
<D>__{colonel, colonel ... excuse me, colonel, a statement ... we don't know anything ... you promised us a press conference ... now there is a meeting with the commissioner.}
<C>__{first journalist}
<D>__{will you tell us what is happening?}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{nothing. absolutely nothing. we are still weighing the situation.}
<A>__{they move to the landing and begin to ascend the stairway that leads to the second floor. the journalists have difficulty keeping up with mathieu.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{look around. i've put everything at your disposal. go take a look with your own eyes. 2nd journalist the strike is a success; but ...}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{no. it has failed in its objective. 1st journalist insurrection?}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{insurrection. 2nd journalist but the nlf has always spoken of a strike as a demonstration ...}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{and you believe the nlf? 2nd journalist they seemed to be plausible this time. a general strike is a good argument for the un.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{the un is far away, dear sir. it is easier to make oneself heard with bombs. if i were in their place, i would use bombs. 1st journalist armed insurrection ... but what is it exactly?}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{it is an armed insurrection ...}
<A>__{they have arrived at the second floor landing, hurry along, and stop in front of a large door, where there is a written sign: prefect. mathieu, at the same time, has continued speaking.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{it is an inevitable stage in revolutionary war; from terrorism, one passes to insurrection ... as from open guerrilla warfare one passes to real war, the latter being the determining factor ... 3rd journalist dien bien phu?}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{exactly.}
<A>__{mathieu glances at the journalist, as if to see if there were any irony in his remark, but the journalist's face is expressionless.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{in indochina,}
<A>__{they won.}
<D>__{3rd journalist and here?}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{it depends on you. 4th journalist on us? you aren't thinking of drafting us by any chance, are you, colonel?}
<A>__{mathieu leans his hand on the door handle and smiles at the journalists.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{no! we have enough fighters. you have only to write, and well, if possible. 1st journalist what's the problem then?}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{political support. sometimes it's there, sometimes not ... sometimes, it's not enough. what were they saying in paris yesterday? 5th journalist nothing ... sartre has written another article ...}
<A>__{mathieu gestures and makes an expression as if to say: "see what i mean?" at the same time, he opens the door. but before entering, he turns again to the journalists.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{will you kindly explain to me why all the sartres are always born on the other side? 5th journalist then you like sartre, colonel ...}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{not really, but he's even less appealing as an enemy.}
