<L>__{exterior woods night}
<A>__{the figure thrashes over on its back and tries to close a shoulder to hip tear in its life support suit. by the faint identification light that flickers on and off inside its helmet, we see a man from the stars. his skin is translucent coral. he is gasping as our atmosphere mixes with his and threatens to suffocate him. under his translucent skin a maze of veins and arteries extend from a white mass that sits in the upper half of his head. he is hairless. underneath a graceful fore head, transparent eyelids droop over black pupilless eyes. the thin lips that delineate his mouth are chalk white. he tries to clutch the edges of the tear together but is too weak. his hands drop limply from the suit, allowing the rent to gape open and reveal the translucent body underneath.}

<D>__{how about if i drive now?}
<A>__{behind the faceplate a piece of white light breaks off from the shining mass in the star man's head and moves down his neck. through the hole in the suit we see it arrive at the top of his single lung. the white light spreads throughout the organ like a phosphorescent tide. the star man lapses into unconsciousness as we hear the truck pull away.}
