<D>__{how ' s lincoln six echo today?}
<A>__{lincoln shrugs, noncommittal. merrick eyes him thoughtfully.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{e v e r y t h i n g going okay?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i guess not.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{why do you say that?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i f i'm here.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{i'm not sure i deserve such a negative association. my job's only to see that you're happy. that everything's okay.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{i t sounds like you don't believe me.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{why wouldn't i?}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{( s i t s back, smiling)}
<D>__{i t ' s part of your makeup. to challenge things. to question what's around you.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{ah.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{p e r h a p s you can utilize that facility by helping me solve a little puzzle.}
<A>__{lincoln shifts, feeling uneasy. merrick consults the etherboard }
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{you're doing well in most areas pro f i c i e n t a t work, exercising rigorously, your last medical puts you in excellent condition. but screening's picked up some deviations. trace levels, changes in your sleep pattern... i see you've also been burning up your quotas...}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{a r e you saying i'm contaminated?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{the n what's the problem?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{the r e are parameters, lincoln. when someone starts straying from those parameters, we need to find out why.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{because you not just you, all of our residents are special. because people like me don't get to go to the island.}
<A>__{he smiles. lincoln stays deadpan, wondering where this is going.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{s o tell me, have you noticed any changes in yourself?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{what about your sleep pattern? you feel you've been sleeping properly?}
<A>__{lincoln shrugs, refractory.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{l e t me put it another way, when you wake up, do you feel... disrupted?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{disrupted?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{r e s t l e s s , disoriented, uneasy...}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{they're all words in your vocabulary. i know you understand what they mean.}
<A>__{lincoln ' s jaw clenches, patronized. merrick notes this, resumes }
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{quotas . . . nutrition. do you feel like you want more than you're given?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{do you have any difficulty staying focused? at work, for instance?}
<A>__{lincoln ' s jaw twitches. merrick notes this, proceeds with care }
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{h a v e you been experiencing feelings, sensations you don't quite understand?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{do you sometimes feel agitated for no apparent reason? frustrated, angry...}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{that's it.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{an g r y ? you feel angry?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{when exactly do you feel angry?}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{now...}
<A>__{lincoln leans forward as if to assert this. merrick slowly nods like he's just revealed something. he taps the etherboard }
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{i'm going to order some tests at the medical center. in the meantime, i'd like you to stay away from stimulants protein, sugar, caffeine...}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i already burned up my quotas.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{but i know you can get around them.}
<A>__{he levels a knowing look. lincoln stiffens again, unsettled.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{i'm asking you to cooperate. not for my sake, lincoln, but for your own.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{is that it?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{the r e is one other thing. you have a female friend. "ester". your file shows you've been interacting regularly.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{the r e ' s no law against friendship.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{o f course not. we encourage interaction in the hope it'll be of mutual benefit. but given these deviations... let's just say proximity becomes an issue.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{i know the rules of proximity.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{the rules of proximity apply to sexual contact, lincoln. in this case it goes deeper than that. ester is entering h e r second trimester. a time of change and emotional confusion. further inter a c t i o n might be... unhealthy for you.}
<A>__{lincoln , patronized, looks away. this pill he won't swallow.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{an d for ester well, she has only six months left to delivery. then she'll move out to the island and whatever ties she has here will be broken.}
<C>__{merrick }
<D>__{a s a friend, shouldn't you make her t r a n s i t i o n as painless as possible?}
<A>__{lincoln ' s deadpan falters. this one, a bitter pill, he swallows.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{g o o d . now i'm also going to refill your pleasure quota. it may help to settle you down a little.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{thank you. i feel much better now.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{i'm not sure you do. but i think you'll do what's right, lincoln. you may not trust me. but i trust you.}
