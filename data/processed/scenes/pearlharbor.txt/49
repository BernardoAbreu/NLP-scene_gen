<D>__{red, peeping tom stuff can get us court marshaled.}

<A>__{anthony and billy are hysterical, trying to keep their laughter hidden. but then they see the effect this is having on the women especially on betty. she's smitten. red repeats the verse, really getting into it; when he finishes, betty runs out and hugs him, as all the nurses applaud. they move off into the darkness, arm and arm. the nurses go back to their primping. anthony and billy are changed men. anthony stands up; billy's baffled. anthony moves out and starts singing.}
