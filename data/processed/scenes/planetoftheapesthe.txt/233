<L>__{278 close group shot the defendant's table}
<A>__{taylor has begun to write something on a sheet of paper. zira and cornelius remain attentive to:}
<C>__{honorius' voice}
<P>__{(o.s.)}
<D>__{these sacred truths are self evident. the proper study of apes is apes. but certain young cynics have chosen to study man yes, perverted scientists who advance on insidious theory called 'evolution.'}
<L>__{279 full shot the inquiry room}
<A>__{as the prosecutor continues:}
<C>__{honorius}
<D>__{there is a conspiracy afoot to undermine the very cornerstone of our faith}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{come to the point, dr. honorius.}
<C>__{honorius}
<D>__{directly, mr. president. this wretched man, the accused, is only a pawn in the conspiracy. we know that he was wounded in the throat at the time of his capture. the state charges that dr. zira and a corrupt surgeon named galen experimented on this wounded animal, tampering with his brain and throat tissues to create a speaking monster ...}
<C>__{zira}
<P>__{(on her feet)}
<D>__{thatos a lie!}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(pounding gavel)}
<D>__{mind your tongue, madame.}
<C>__{zira}
<D>__{did we create his mind too? not only can this man speak. he can write. he can reason.}
<C>__{honorius}
<D>__{he can reason? with the tribunal's permission, let me expose this hoax by direct examination.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{proceed. but don't turn this hearing into a farce.}
<A>__{honorius crosses to the defendant's table and favors taylor with an evil smile.}
<C>__{honorius}
<D>__{tell the court, bright eyes what is the second article of faith?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i admit, i know nothing of your culture.}
<C>__{honorius}
<D>__{of course he doesn't know our culture because he cannot think.}
<P>__{(to taylor)}
<D>__{tell us why all apes are created equal.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{some apes, it seems, are more equal than others.}
<C>__{honorius}
<D>__{ridiculous. that answer is a contradiction in terms. tell us, bright eyes, why do men have no souls? what is the proof that a divine spark exists in the simian brain?}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(hands paper to zira)}
<D>__{show this to the president.}
<A>__{zira moves toward the dais. honorius returns to his own table.}
<C>__{zira}
<D>__{since the defendant is forbidden to speak in his own defense, he asks that this statement be read into the record.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{read it yourself.}
<C>__{zira}
<P>__{(reading aloud)}
<D>__{'i have come to you from a planet in a different solar system. i am an explorer in space, with no hostile intentions against your civilization. on my planet it was the primate man who evolved into a thinking animal, while the apes remained..."}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(rapping gavel)}
<D>__{stop right there. bring me that paper.}
<A>__{zira crosses to the dais, handing the statement to the president. he glances at it, laughs derisively and passes it to zaius.}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(to zira)}
<D>__{this is a joke in very poor taste.}
<C>__{zira}
<D>__{is it a joke to seek the truth about this man?}
<C>__{zaius}
<P>__{(glancing at document)}
<D>__{dr. zira you state here that a ship from outer space sank in an inland sea of our eastern desert.}
<C>__{zira}
<D>__{i do not state it, sir. the prisoner does.}
<C>__{zaius}
<D>__{do you believe him?}
<C>__{zira}
<P>__{(uneasily)}
<D>__{like you, i find it difficult.}
<C>__{zaius}
<D>__{but how convenient that the proof of his arrival has vanished?}
<P>__{(glancing again at document)}
<D>__{you also state that bright eyes had two intelligent companions at the time of his capture.}
<C>__{zira}
<D>__{this is his assertion.}
<C>__{zaius}
<D>__{where are they now?}
<C>__{taylor}
<P>__{(blurting it out)}
<D>__{one is in a museum!}
<C>__{president}
<P>__{(pounding gavel)}
<D>__{dr. zira! silence that man!}
<A>__{returning to her table, zira gestures to taylor to remain silent.}
<C>__{zaius}
<D>__{how sad. stuffed and mounted, eh? dead men, like sunken ships, can tell no stories. and his other companion?}
<C>__{zira}
<D>__{he doesn't know.}
<C>__{zaius}
<D>__{mr. president, i believe the prosecutor has reassembled all he surviving humans captured in the hunt along with bright eyes.}
<C>__{honorius}
<D>__{that's true, dr. zaius. my witnesses correction my exhibits are on display in the amphitheater.}
<C>__{president}
<D>__{very well. i suggest we go and look at them.}
<A>__{the president rises, starts out, followed by the others. taylor is last, being led on a leash by the bailiff.}
