<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{mr. mcallister? mr. mcallister! wait up}
<C>__{i}
<A>__{jim, his tie loose and his sleeves rolled up, looks up from unlocking his car. tracy runs toward him holding out a term paper folder.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{i got all my signatures. one hundred and fifty eight way more than i need!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{hey, that's super}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{here they are.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you can put those in my box. i will look at them tomorrow.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{could you approve them now? i'd like to kick off my campaign right away, you know, in the morning.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(resigned)}
<D>__{right}
<A>__{he cursorily flips through the bound pages and offers them back to tracy.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{looks good to me.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{aren't you supposed to keep them?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{no, that's fine}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{i thought you were supposed to keep them.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{okay, fine. sure}
<A>__{jim throws his briefcase and tracy's folder into the backseat.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{thanks for everything.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you bet.}
<A>__{tracy stays put as jim climbs in, shuts the door and fastens his seat belt.}
<C>__{tracy}
<P>__{(cheery, awkward)}
<D>__{i can't wait to start campaigning.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{should be easy. so far no competition.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{hell, you know, coca cola's the world's number one soft drink, but they spend more money than anybody on advertising. i guess that's how come they stay number one.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{yeah. okay. well, good luck tracy}
<A>__{they exchange a long, curious stare. there's a tone at once confrontational and vaguely sexual about this moment.}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{you know, mr. m., when i win the presidency, that means you and i are going to be spending a lot of time together next year. and i for one would like that time to be harmonious and productive. wouldn't you?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{sure}
<C>__{tracy}
<D>__{okay. that's good. i just wanted to make sure.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{good luck, tracy.}
<A>__{jim pulls away and heads for the parking lot exit.}
