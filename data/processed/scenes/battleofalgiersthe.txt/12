<L>__{12 prison cell. inside. morning.}
<A>__{in one of the cells there are about twenty prisoners. the cell is huge; there are two very high windows that almost reach the ceiling. a prisoner is standing on the urine bucket, and looks outside through the barred window. on the ground there are some mats which serve as beds. nothing else. about ten prisoners are in a group, seated on the ground, and they are speaking in whispers.}
<B>__{ad lib dialogue in lowered voices.}
<A>__{two of them are playing with some stones on a chessboard drawn in the dirt; others are speaking among themselves. one is reading a mickey mouse comic book and laughing to himself. but all of them, in appearance and behavior, are distinguished from those who make up the more numerous group. these solitary men are different in some way, they are not ordinary delinquents. ali la pointe is alone, withdrawn from the others, seated on the ground, his shoulders propped against the wall, his knees raised. he is barefoot. on his left ankle, directly above his foot, are tattooed two words in print: tais toi. his shirt is unbuttoned and on his chest are other tattoos in a strange design. ali looks at the group and seems to listen to their murmured words absent mindedly. his expression is taciturn, reserved, and indifferent. ali turns to the prisoner at the window.}
<C>__{prisoner at window}
<D>__{look at them!}
<A>__{ali jumps to his feet. everyone moves toward the two windows. ali moves away two yards at a quick pace, then runs toward the window, and grabbing hold of the bars, heaves himself up to it. the condemned man turns and looks up toward the windows. he seems to smile although his face is motionless. in a soft voice, he speaks to those faces which appear behind the bars:}
<C>__{condemned man}
<D>__{tahia el djez air! [long live algeria!]}
<A>__{the political prisoners take up the phrase and recite it gutturally, keeping time to the steps of the condemned man.}
<C>__{political prisoners}
<D>__{tahia el djez air!}
