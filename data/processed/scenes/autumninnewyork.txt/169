<A>__{a couple walks down the same walkway. they are deep in subdued conversation. all around them spring is in full glory. melted snow. trees exploding with green. birds singing. the man is wills keane, but he has markedly changed. his dress is not so impeccable, his hair has gone grey at the temples. his face, though still beautiful, has gracefully turned the corner into middle age. walking at his side is his daughter, lisa, now well along in her pregnancy }

<D>__{he said it's the first time since we got married that he's actually realized what marriage is. that it's forever. that he can't just pick up and run away to nepal or something if we have a fight. that he's part of the cycle of things now. that he's gonna die some day. that it's the next generation's turn to take the stage.}
