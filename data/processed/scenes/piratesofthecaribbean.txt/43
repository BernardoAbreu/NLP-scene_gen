<L>__{exterior black pearl main deck night}
<A>__{lit by lanterns; no moon is visible beneath the fog. smoke hangs heavy above the deck. elizabeth's longboat is raised above the deck rail pirates spot her, and stare. one polite fellow steps forward to offer his hand. she takes it and steps down. she huddles, self conscious in her nightgown and dressing robe.}
<C>__{bosun}
<D>__{i didn't know we was taking captives.}
<C>__{pintel}
<D>__{she's invoked the right of parlay... with captain barbossa.}
<A>__{on the poop deck an imposing figure in silhouette stands by the wheel, too far away to have heard pintel's words. but his head turns at the mention of his name. the silhouetted figure moves toward the stairs. a cloud of smoke obscures him and then, as if he skipped the stairs, he strides out of the smoke on the main deck this is barbossa. despite the bright colors of clothing, definitely not a man you'd want to meet in a dark alley or anywhere, for that matter. elizabeth, more terrified than ever, cannot look away from his eyes. but she musters her courage }
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i am here to }
<A>__{the bosun slaps her.}
<C>__{bosun}
<D>__{you'll speak when spoken to!}
<A>__{his wrist is grabbed painfully by barbossa.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{and you'll not lay a hand on those under the protection of parlay!}
<C>__{bosun}
<D>__{aye, sir.}
<A>__{barbossa releases him. turns to elizabeth, smiles it shows both silver and gold teeth.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{my apologies, miss. as you were saying, before you were so rudely interrupted?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{captain barbossa ... i have come to negotiate the cessation of hostilities against port royal.}
<A>__{barbossa is both impressed and amused.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{there was a lot of long words in there, miss, and we're not but humble pirates. what is it you want?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i want you to leave. and never come back.}
<A>__{barbossa and the pirates laugh.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{i am disinclined to acquiesce to your request.}
<P>__{(helpfully)}
<D>__{means' no. '}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{very well.}
<A>__{she quickly slips the medallion off, darts to the side rail, dangles it over the side of the ship. the pirates go quiet.}
<C>__{elizabeth }
<D>__{i will drop it!}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{my holds are bursting with swag. that bit of shine matters to me ... why?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{because it's what you're searching for. you've been searching for it for years. i recognize this ship. i saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from england.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<P>__{(interested)}
<D>__{did you, now?}
<A>__{elizabeth glares at him. she's getting nowhere.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{fine. i suppose if this is worthless, there's no reason to keep it.}
<A>__{she flips the medallion up, off her finger }
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{she catches it by the chain, smiles at him triumphantly.}
<C>__{barbossa }
<D>__{you have a name, missy?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{elizabeth }
<P>__{(stops herself from saying "swann"; then:)}
<D>__{turner.}
<P>__{(embroidering)}
<D>__{i'm a maid in the governor's household.}
<P>__{(curtsies)}
<D>__{barbossa reacts to the name turner: it confirms what he has suspected. the other pirates surreptitiously exchange glances and nods.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{you've got sand, for a maid.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<P>__{(curtsies again)}
<D>__{thank you, sir.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{and how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that? a family heirloom, perhaps?}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{of course.}
<P>__{(offended)}
<D>__{i didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{no, no, nothing like that.}
<P>__{(comes to a decision)}
<D>__{very well. you hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{can i trust you?}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{it's you who invoked the parlay! believe me, miss, you'd best hand it over, now... or these be the last friendly words you'll hear!}
<A>__{elizabeth hesitates, but she has no choice. she holds out the medallion. he grabs it, clutches it in his fist like hope.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{our bargain. . ?}
<A>__{barbossa grins devilishly but then nods to the bosun.}
<C>__{bosun}
<D>__{still the guns, and stow 'em! signal the men, set the flags, and make good to clear port!}
<A>__{for the first time since the attack began, the booming of the guns ceases. elizabeth is surprised and relieved. the pirates hustle to follow orders. barbossa turns away.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{wait! you must return me to shore! according to the rules of the order of the brethren }
<A>__{barbossa wheels on her.}
<C>__{barbossa}
<D>__{first. your return to shore was not part of our negotiations nor our agreement, and so i 'must' do nothing. secondly: you must be a pirate for the pirate's code to apply. and you're not. and thirdly...}
<A>__{the code is more what you'd call guidelines than actual rules. (grins gold and silver) welcome aboard the black pearl, miss turner. elizabeth stares in speechless terror }
