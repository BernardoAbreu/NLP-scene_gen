<C>__{slave}
<D>__{they want to make a visit here... with their king... he will bring gifts, and will receive gifts. they said not to sacrifice anymore men for them... they don't like that...}
<A>__{dom paulo and the others laugh.}
<L>__{exterior bay day}
<A>__{the tide is sweeping more wreckage into the bay. barrels and boxes and timber bob in the waves. people make their way to the shoreline to retrieve these new gifts from the sea. the whole of the camp is eager and shouting. they bring in the boxes and barrels. a whole harmonium is man handled ashore. some boys drag it up onto dry sand and start to work its bellows. at first only water spurts from it, but then a watery note or two is emitted. the mood soon becomes festive. dom paulo makes his way down to the shore to make the celebrations official. by now the first of the newly arrived crates are being opened. inside are eggs, many, many large eggs, in crate after crate. an officer brings the first of the eggs to dom paulo.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{turtles' eggs, sir... doctor correa was shipping them to the royal zoo... i think they hoped some of them would hatch.}
<C>__{dom paulo}
<D>__{well... it's eggs for supper tonight... for everyone...}
