<L>__{interior dwight and caroline's bedroom night}
<A>__{caroline enters, looks down at the sleeping dwight. she gets back into the bed and dwight throws a sleepy hand over her. caroline hesitates, but forces herself to put a hand over dwight's.}
<L>__{interior dwight and caroline's kitchen morning}
<A>__{through a window, dwight, dressed in his coveralls, leaves for work. caroline is sewing on a machine whilst toby leans against the kitchen sink.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{... but ask him again, why don't you? i hate it so much.}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(never stops sewing)}
<D>__{i asked him a week ago, i asked him this morning he wants you to keep the paper route.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{then make him give me the money. it's mine, i earned it. it's $220.00 already.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{he won't. he says he'll keep it for when you really need it.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{that's not fair. i ought to be able to have my own money.}
<P>__{(as caroline shrugs)}
<D>__{but it's mine.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{you remind me of a baby bird you know those frantic little things with their mouths wide open, wanting, wanting.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{well, at least ask him about my gym shoes again. i can practice barefoot but for games i gotta have shoes.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i'm not a referee. i won't do it.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{oh, we know, we know: the bride won't argue. the bride won't raise her voice.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{well, i will tell you what the bride will do: the bride will get up and walk over there and slap hell out of the bride's son. now does the bride's son want his face slapped?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{oh, i hate it here! i wish we could just get up and go.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i don't have another 'get up and go' left in me! you understand? i'm telling you i've hit a god damn wall. i can't run anymore. now this whole thing isn't perfect for me, either... let me impress that on you real strong, okay? i don't wake up singing every morning. but i'm going to make this marriage work i won't join in any fights, you got that? i won't even raise my voice!}
<A>__{caroline points to the sink.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{see those two roses? he picked them for me on his way home last night.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{big deal.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i'm trying to concentrate on the good stuff.}
<A>__{norma appears in the kitchen door, wearing her cap and gown. she strikes a pose.}
<C>__{norma}
<D>__{what d'ya think? i think i look like a fool.}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{who cares? six weeks to graduation, and california, here i come!}
<A>__{norma snaps her fingers and goes back to her bedroom.}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(lamely)}

<A>__{caroline turns her attention back to the curtains.}
