<L>__{interior hospital emergency room day}
<A>__{a short time later. cochrane is being lifted onto an operating table. picard and beverly step back from the table as a doctor and two nurses look him over. the doctor is in his early fifties and has a weathered, tired look to him. the hospital itself is like the rest of the town a futuristic setting fallen on hard times. the light in the room is provided mostly from the sunlight streaming in through the windows. light bulbs and other gear flicker dimly around the hospital we get the feeling they have very little power.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{how long has he been unconscious?}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{at least four hours.}
<A>__{he checks cochran's head injury as beverly takes out her tricorder and scans him.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{it looks like he has a cranial fracture, but i will need x rays to be sure.}
<P>__{(to nurse)}
<D>__{get ruby in here.}
<A>__{one of the nurses runs off.}
<C>__{beverly}
<P>__{(off tricorder)}
<D>__{he has a severe fracture of the left occipital plate. he's not hemorrhaging... but the radiation has damaged his kna and his apr cell count...}
<A>__{he looks at her curiously.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{"apr cell count?" what the hell are you talking about?}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{doctor crusher has been... studying some advanced medical theories.}
<C>__{nurse}
<P>__{(re: tricorder)}
<D>__{what is that?}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{it's a... new medical scanner. it's a little more precise than an x ray machine.}
<A>__{the doctor eyes it.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{is it japanese?}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{um... yeah.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now he's going to need a respirator. do you have one?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{we have two... but we don't have the juice to run them.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{juice?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{power. there hasn't been a lot of wind through here for the last couple of weeks. most of the batteries are depleted.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{don't you have any generators, or other fuel sources?}
<A>__{the doctor throws her an irritated look.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{maybe you'd like to take your patient to the hospital in bozemen... it's only two hundred miles away.}
<A>__{cochrane wheezes breathing becoming labored and ragged. beverly scans him, urgent.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{his automatic reflexes are fluctuating. we've got to get him on a respirator.}
<C>__{doctor}
<P>__{(to nurse)}
<D>__{bag him.}
<A>__{the nurse picks up a portable respirator sack puts it on cochrane's face and squeezes the bag, forcing air into cochrane's lungs. picard has been thinking through this scene, finally has a solution.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{beverly your tricorder.}
<A>__{she hands him her tricorder.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(to doctor)}
<D>__{where's the battery room for the hospital?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{i told you, there's no }
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{outside, around back. next to the water tank.}
<A>__{picard rushes out the doors. beverly checks cochrane's pulse.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{his heartbeat's irregular...}
<A>__{beverly climbs up on top of cochrane, straddling him, begins giving him 24th century cpr. she takes charge.}
<C>__{beverly}
<D>__{adrenaline ten cc's!}
<A>__{as they rush to save him.}
