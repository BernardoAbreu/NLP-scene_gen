<L>__{int: hospital, various continuing}
<A>__{we see silus. staring through a window into an office. in there we can see jones. jones is talking in a very animated manner to someone who is obviously a reporter. the reporter stares, like jones, through the window towards silus. jones turns away, looking guilty. cut to bedlam in the hospital corridors. people screaming, being restrained. what is clear is that the virus steph had has now broken out into a plague of biblical proportions. we see a doctor standing in the middle of the hospital corridor, blood over his smock, in a state of pure shock. and we see silus there. a perfect creature observing the chaos. as he stands there he can see a small child; a girl, maybe around five. silus stares at the child. the girl is holding her mother's hand. her mother lies on a cot, strapped down; there are many other cots filling the crowded hallway. her mother is dead. the girl's dirty face is stained with tears. for a moment silus wavers. then he moves over to the girl. she stares up at him with her tear stained grimy face. silus goes to place his hand on her forehead as blessing, but the child cringes, then jumps up and escapes down the hallway. silus can only stare at the horror of it all. cut to}
