<L>__{interior tunnel continuous}
<A>__{...drops down into a dark, dank tunnel. water dripping. footfalls echoing. will cocks his head. left or right? starts sprinting down towards the lighter end of the tunnel, his own footsteps bouncing against the tunnel walls. he rounds a curve. sound recedes...}
<L>__{exterior tunnel continuous}
<A>__{...he exits the tunnel onto the rocky beach. stops short.}
<B>__{fog}
<A>__{has enveloped everything obscuring all vision, dulling all sound. like a strange dream. eerie. will blinks against the thick whiteness. strains to hear any sound, anything. there's only the distant lapping of the water. he tightens his grip on his gun and plunges into the fog. quick, careful steps. stumbles over a rock. waves his gun in defense. eyes wide open like a blind man...}
<B>__{suddenly}
<A>__{a gunshot. off to the right. will whips his head around.}
