<L>__{interior nancy's living room. night.}
<A>__{nancy barrels down the stairs and across the darkened living room to the front door. it takes her a moment of tugging and fumbling to realize the deadbolt is locked from inside. and there's no key in it now. she races to a porch window and throws it open, shaking and banging on the bars like a mad woman. but there's no getting through. she staggers back, stymied and furious. then somebody moves behind her in the dark.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{locked.}
<A>__{nancy jumps around in shock. her mother has posted herself on the couch with her bottle.}
<C>__{nancy}
<P>__{(furious)}
<D>__{give me the key, mother.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{i don't even have it on me, so forget it.}
<A>__{the word is final. nancy runs past the woman to the back door, to one window after the other, shaking bars and slamming locks and screaming in teenage fury. but it's no good. the house is her prison.}
<C>__{marge }
<P>__{(drunk satisfaction)}
<D>__{paid the guy damn good to make sure you stayed put. you ain't goin' nowhere, kid. you're gonna sleep tonight if it kills me.}
<A>__{nancy clenches her fists and screams at the top of her lungs, a heart wrenching, eardrum breaking cry of love in despair }
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{gleeennnnnn!}
