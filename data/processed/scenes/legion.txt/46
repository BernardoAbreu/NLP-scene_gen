<A>__{percy just stares at him, penetrating. finally:}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{when i was a kid my father would sit by my bed every night before i'd go to sleep and he'd say to me, percy, if you don't wake up tomorrow, if it turns out that today was your last day on earth, would you be proud of what you've done in this life? cuz if you ain't, then you better start gettin' square.}
<A>__{kyle looks at percy, fear in his eyes, then he turns back to the darkness...and the evil that surrounds them.}
