<T>__{scene:}
<A>__{aboard the yacht, which is circling the island, sandro, patrizia, raimondo and one of the sailors are peering out over the side, scrutinizing the banks and rocky slopes in hope of finding some trace of anna. the jagged cliffs appear enormously tall and ominous, harboring tiny grottoes in which someone could easily hide.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{perhaps she wasn't feeling well... maybe a cramp or something...}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{anna is an excellent swimmer. even with a cramp, she would have managed to reach shore somehow.}
<C>__{patrizia}
<D>__{but you have to consider all possibilities, sandro.}
<A>__{incensed by her remark, which he considers to be absurd, sandro moves away from patrizia and goes towards the stern of the boat where he notices corrado signaling to them from a remote section of the beach.}
<C>__{corrado}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{there are some footprints around here...}
<A>__{but he stops in the middle of the statement, and throws up his arms to indicate that the discovery is really of little significance. so he proceeds to climb back up along the pathway from which he descended, and the yacht continues on its way.}
<C>__{sandro}
<P>__{(calling from the stern, excitedly)}
<D>__{patrizia!}
<A>__{both patrizia and raimondo come rushing over to the stern and look towards where sandro is pointing at something dark and obscure afloat on the water up ahead.}
<C>__{raimondo}
<P>__{(to the sailor)}
<D>__{mario...steer the boat that way.}
<A>__{the yacht heads in the direction of the black object in the water, but as they come up close, they realize it is nothing more than some wooden piece of furniture. the turn has taken the boat slightly away from lisca bianca and they now find themselves closer to the little island of basiluzzo.}
<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{shall i turn back?}
<C>__{sandro}
<D>__{no. now that we're here, let's have a look around basiluzzo.}
<P>__{(then turning to patrizia)}
<D>__{when we were swimming, she swam out in that direction.}
<C>__{sailor}
<D>__{it won't be easy to find a place to go ashore.}
