<L>__{exterior van nuys boulevard night}
<A>__{pete rides up the boulevard with the "cruisers". he spots "v's" car parked at "tops". he pulls in beside "v's" car and shuts down the engine. the usual crowd is at the drive in, including sheila. pete goes up to "v" and carl and says hello. he lights a cigarette and leans up against a steel pole supporting the awning above. "v" and carl both notice that pete is in a bad mood. sheila is over with her girlfriends. she hasn't seen pete arrive. suddenly sheila looks over in pete's direction. she looks like she's seeing something, yet not seeing anything. she keeps looking staring. sheila's pov she sees "v", carl and a lot of people, but pete is not there. pete looks at sheila. he's unsettled and confused by her staring, but not seeming to see him. he watches her turn away and take one of her girlfriend's hands leading her out to dance to the loud music. pete watches her dance. suddenly, he can't see her. he thinks maybe she may be dancing on the other side of the building out of view. he moves to look and his head is struck by a violent pain. he grabs his head with his hand and leans forward. "v" grabs his arm.}
<D>__{"v" you okay, man?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{what? "v" you okay?... what's wrong7}
<A>__{pete looks up at "v". he doesn't seem to recognize him "v's" head is a featureless blur. pete shakes his head trying to drive out the pain. he looks over again for sheila. he sees her there dancing with her girlfriend.}
<D>__{"v" pete... you okay?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{pete stands back up against the post turns to "v" recognizing him.}
<C>__{pete }
<D>__{i'm, okay... you okay? "v" sure, i'm okay.}
<A>__{some drunk guys move over to sheila and her girlfriend. they cut in on the girls. the guy with sheila puts his hand around her waist and pulls her against her will into a grind. she tries to push him away, but he holds on tighter laughing with his buddy. "v" and carl look at pete as he pushes off the post. pete crosses quickly to the man dancing with sheila. he slams his fist into the man's nose almost snapping the man's neck in the process. the man goes down bleeding. pete attacks the other man who is turning toward him ready for a fight. he hits the man in the gut the man's head goes down and pete brings his knee up cracking the man's face. the man's torso flies up with pete's knee then continues on as the man falls to the floor. pete picks him up, ready to hit him again, but the crowd pulls him off. pete stands and turns pulsating with anger. sheila is there beside him.}
