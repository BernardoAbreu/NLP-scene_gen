<A>__{truman ruefully examines the broken car aerial on his freshly washed oldsmobile. in the background is the warning sign he has just ignored, "close windows, lower aerials". truman removes the metal coathanger from beneath the lavender cardigan and forces the bent wire into what's left of the severed aerial.}

<A>__{truman readjusts the radio as it starts to fade out. suddenly there is a piercing blast of feedback. he looks up and, as far as the eye can see, every pedestrian, motorist and shopkeeper along the street suddenly winces in pain and holds their right ear at exactly the same moment.}

<D>__{...something's wrong. change frequencies...}
