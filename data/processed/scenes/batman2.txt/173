<A>__{sirens blare and red lights flash in the distance as the cop cars spread out along the winding roads that run through the park. batman reins the horse in suddenly as a black and white whips past on an access road just ahead of him, no more than twenty yards away. he turns the horse in a circle. more red lights appear in the distance; another contingent of squad cars has just entered from the opposite side of the park. it's going to be tough getting out of here... then: his eyes fall on the statue of his great grandfather, general wayne two waynes on horseback, not twenty feet apart. he thinks back to his earlier conversation with vicki and gets an inspiration. he rides past general wayne to the stone bridge which spans the little frozen creek. there he finds the drainage tunnel vicki described, obscured by the wire mesh grate. this must be where the boy vigilante holes up... he dismounts, ties his cape to the pommel of the horse's saddle and sends it off with a slap. he pries the grate loose and crawls inside.}
