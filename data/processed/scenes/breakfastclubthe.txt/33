<D>__{why are you here? they stop walking and andrew leans against the wall.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{um, i'm here today...because uh, because my coach and my father don't want me to blow my ride. see i get treated differently because uh, coach thinks i'm a winner. so does my old man. i'm not a winner because i wanna be one... i'm a winner because i got strength and speed. kinda like a race horse. that's about how involved i am in what's happening to me.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{yeah? that's very interesting. now why don't you tell me why you're really in here.}
<C>__{andrew}
