<L>__{interior 99 cent store night}
<A>__{`i'm too sexy' by right said fred playing loudly on speakers. the space is huge, garish and piled high with countless cheap household cleaners, candies, foodstuffs and toys. arthur's fascinated, a tourist in austerity.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{everything is 99 cents?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{yip. a whole penny less than those bourgeois assholes at the dollar store.}
<A>__{arthur reads a doll's label.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{`warning: this product contains chromium, which may be linked to chronic bronchitis and reproductive hazards."}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{that one was on the news. everyone else recalled them, the pussies. not my 99 cent!}
<A>__{arthur turns the doll over: a sticker reads `china'.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{maybe china's trying to wipe out the west's children one by one.}
<A>__{he gazes around in wonder.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{oh, i love this place.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{well, i'd like you to believe it's because i'm a poor girl reduced to buying `depressed chef' burgers in a can to right said fred because i don't know where my next paycheck is coming from. but the truth is bargains get me hot. got it from ma. drives my dad crazy. the tour?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{yes please.}
<A>__{she takes his arm.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{looking west, the ladies' hygiene products. note that the more natural sounding the name, e.g. this 'vermont breeze' feminine spray, the more lethal chemicals it contains. watch out for the products cunningly labelled to make the dumber consumer think they're getting the real thing: 'special j', 'crampbell's soup', ''aunt janina's' maple style syrup...}
<A>__{arthur holds a tin with a coffee mate style logo, reading `friend of coffee'. the store music changes to ricky martin: `livin' la vida loca'}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{and ah, the music: dated sounds for lonely people to buy cheap shit to.}
<A>__{they pass an old woman who is going through a stack of identical tins of cheap beans.}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{i once watched a woman shoplift an 8 pack of toilet scrubbers down her panty hose to 'everything i do, i do it for you'.}
<A>__{arthur just stares at naomi.}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{why are you staring at me?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{just fascinated.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{you're good at fascinated.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you're good at fascinating.}
<A>__{a crash. the old woman has knocked over all the beans.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{are you okay? let me help you.}
<A>__{he hands her a tin.}
<C>__{old woman}
<D>__{not that one.}
<C>__{arthur}
<P>__{(offers her another)}
<D>__{this one?}
<C>__{old woman}
<P>__{(shaking the tin)}
<D>__{no. there's less beans in it.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{this one?}
<C>__{old woman}
<P>__{(sniffs the tin)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{this one?}
<A>__{she stares and thinks. arthur puts the tin to his ear.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{no. i think i hear a mouse inside.}
<A>__{arthur shakes and sniffs another tin.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{oh my g d. this is a good one. no rodents. packed.}
<A>__{he slips her a dollar and whispers to her.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{quick, before someone gets it.}
<A>__{naomi gazes at a different arthur to the fool who nearly got her killed.}
<C>__{old woman}
<P>__{(to naomi)}
<D>__{you got a good one here, honey.}
<A>__{she hurries away.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{look. us in a year's time.}
<A>__{another old couple push a cart past. the old woman sneezes. the old man produces a tissue and gently wipes her nose.}
<C>__{arthur }
<D>__{if you got ill, i'd care for you.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{i will get ill.}
<A>__{the music changes.}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{oh, man, phil collins. gotta get out when they start playing phil collins. want to see how to get a quarter from a shopping cart?}
