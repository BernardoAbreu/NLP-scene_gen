<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior between floors continuous}
<A>__{lotte searched the floor for some sign of the portal. it is nowhere to be found. there is a noise behind her. she turns with a start. it's craig, ragged and ill shaven.}
<C>__{lotte}
<D>__{my god!}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{i'm so glad you're safe. you look really wonderful.}
<C>__{lotte}
<D>__{i'm in love. for the first time. it's funny, but when it happens to you, there's no question.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{he's a lucky man.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{do i know him?}
<C>__{lotte}
<D>__{it's elijah.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{the iguana?}
<C>__{lotte}
<D>__{the monkey.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{oh, right. as long as you're happy. i'm sure he's a better lover than i ever was.}
<C>__{lotte}
<D>__{a better friend.}
<C>__{craig}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm sorry for everything.}
<C>__{lotte}
<P>__{(pecking him on the cheek)}
<D>__{it's okay, craig. it all worked out, in an odd sort of way.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{you came up here looking for the portal?}
<C>__{lotte}
<D>__{yeah. i was going to kill him from the inside.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{and yourself too in the process. god, you're so beautiful. why couldn't i see that before?}
<C>__{lotte}
<D>__{you saw it once. now you see it again. that's life, isn't it? and you were up here to try the same thing, weren't you?}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{i suppose. but they got here first, the lousy bastards. so now it's all over, i guess.}
<C>__{lotte}
<D>__{i don't know. there's a small community of us. we have a place they don't know about. we're happy. we'll keep trying to figure out a way. come stay with us. join the struggle.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{you'll have me, after all i've done to you?}
<C>__{lotte}
<D>__{people make mistakes.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{i'm through with puppets, lotte. i just want you to know that.}
<C>__{lotte}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{i'd like to be a farmer. i want to help things grow, to encourage life. do you and your friends need a farmer?}
<C>__{lotte}
<D>__{sure. we could really use a farmer. we'd be grateful for the help.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{also, i think, you know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly, a little puppet show every once in a while, would do a lot to lift our spirits. you know, if you wouldn't mind too terribly.}
<A>__{craig's eyes well up with tears. lotte looks at him sweetly.}
<C>__{lotte }
<D>__{oh honey. it's gonna be okay.}
<A>__{she puts her arm around him and leads him toward the elevator.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{i love you, lotte.}
<A>__{we come on very close to craig's arm as he lifts it to put it around lotte. we see a thin almost invisible filament. we follow it up, and discover that craig is now a marionette being controlled from above by an emotionless mantini in a gray jumpsuit.}
<C>__{mantini}
<P>__{(in craig's voice)}
<D>__{i can't wait to see where you and your friends live, lotte.}
<C>__{lotte }
<D>__{it's beautiful, craig, like eden.}
<A>__{now we see filaments attached to mantini's arms, and w follow them up to find that flemmer is controlling mantini.}
<C>__{flemmer}
<D>__{one serpent, coming up.}
<A>__{flemmer throws his head back and laughs. the camera moves into his mouth and down his throat, which, oddly enough, looks exactly like the membranous john malkovich portal tunnel. music in: "put your hand inside the puppet head" by they might be giants. it plays throughout the credits.}
