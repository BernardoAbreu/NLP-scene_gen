<L>__{exterior the command tent day}
<A>__{three armed nazis stand guard around the wooden crate containing the ark. it is sitting near the flopped open entrance to the command tent and there is furious activity going on here. belloq, shliemann, gobler, belzig and assorted aides are packing up all the papers and personal items in preparation for a hasty departure. a large crowd of arab diggers is milling about among the tents. they all want to get a look at the ark. sallah is among them. all at once, there is a earthshaking explosion. al eyes turn toward the rise that hides the airstrip. a huge fireball floats into view over there. everyone starts running toward it. shliemann yells at belzig and the armed nazis.}
