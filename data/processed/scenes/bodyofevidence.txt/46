<L>__{interior courtroom later day}
<A>__{joanne braslow is on the stand. she is wearing a smart business suit and large framed glasses. her hair is pulled back tight. cardenas stands before her.}

<C>__{cardenas}

<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{tell the court about that, please.}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{i opened the bathroom door one day and saw miss lawson pouring cocaine out of a vial.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{did you see mr. marsh the day before his death?}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{how did he look?}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{horrible. he was tired and pale.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{did you talk about miss lawson?}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{what did mr. marsh say?}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{he was worried. he said that she was acting stranger and stranger. he said that if this kept up she was going to kill him. that his heart couldn't take it.}
<A>__{there is an audible buzz from the crowd. for the first time rebecca's confident exterior seems to fade and is replaced with genuine concern.}
<C>__{cardenas}
<D>__{thank you.}
<P>__{(to dulaney)}
<D>__{your witness.}
<A>__{cardenas sits down. dulaney gets up slowly and walks towards joanne.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{how do you know it was cocaine that miss lawson had in the bathroom?}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{what other kind of white powder do people keep in a vial?}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{do you remember the date when you saw miss lawson in the bathroom?}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{yes }
<P>__{(thinks a moment)}
<D>__{it was on a friday. i remember because i was going to visit my sister for her birthday. it would be october twenty eighth.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{could you repeat the last part of what mr. marsh said to you the day before his death?}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{he said that if it kept up she was going to kill him. that his heart couldn't take it.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{didn't mr. marsh also tell you that miss lawson felt bored here and was thinking about going back to chicago for awhile?}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{yes he mentioned it.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{so, the woman he loved passionately was thinking about leaving. that must cause tremendous anxiety. sleepless nights. incredible stress.}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{i suppose.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{so, isn't it possible that he was confiding in you about the pain he was feeling about losing what might be his last chance for love? that what he really was saying was that the uncertainty of her leaving was driving him crazy and if it didn't stop it was going to kill him. that if she did leave his heart couldn't take it.}
<A>__{the jury waits anxiously for her answer. joanne fidgets in his chair as she thinks. she appears confused.}
<C>__{joanne}
<D>__{i don't know. i'm not sure.}
<C>__{dulaney}
<D>__{well, think about it. isn't it possible?}
<C>__{joanne}
<P>__{(begrudgingly)}
<D>__{yes. i suppose it's possible.}
<A>__{cardenas leans back in his seat frustrated. rebecca breathes a sigh of relief.}
