<A>__{the e.s.u. defensive line digs in. lattimer tries to suck up his remaining strength. iowa runs a blast to lattimer's side. he fights through one block, the ballcarrier coming right toward him. they meet in a titanic collision at the goal line. the back keeps driving, twisting. lattimer tries to hold him, but weaker than he was on steroids, is unable to. the back falls over the goal line. touchdown. iowa 13 e.s.u. 10. as the iowa players celebrate all around him, lattimer sits where he fell, a beaten and humiliated young man.}
