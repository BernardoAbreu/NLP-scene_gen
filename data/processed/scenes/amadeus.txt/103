<L>__{interior music room day 1780's}
<A>__{a forte piano is open and waiting. all the dogs follow him. after them come mozart frau and fraulein schlumberg. to mozart's dismay, husband and wife seat themselves quite formally on a little narrow sofa, side by side.}
<C>__{schlumberg}
<P>__{(to the dogs)}
<D>__{now sit down all of you and behave. zeman, mandi, absolutely quiet!}
<P>__{(to a young beagle)}
<D>__{especially you, dudelsachs not one sound from you.}
<A>__{the dogs settle at their feet. husband and wife smile encouragingly at each other.}
<C>__{schlumberg}
<D>__{come on, then. up and at it!}
<A>__{mozart gestures to the music bench. reluctantly, the girl sits at the instrument. mozart sits beside her.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{now, please play me something. just to give me an idea. anything will do.}
<C>__{gertrude}
<P>__{(to parents)}
<D>__{i don't want you to stay.}
<C>__{frau schlumberg}
<D>__{that's all right, dear. just go ahead, as if we weren't here.}
<C>__{gertrude}
<D>__{but you are here.}
<C>__{schlumberg}
<D>__{never mind, strudel. it's part of music, getting used to an audience. aren't i right, herr mozart?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{well, yes! on the whole. i suppose.}
<P>__{(to gertrude)}
<D>__{how long have you been playing, fraulein?}
<C>__{frau schlumberg}
<D>__{just one year.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{who was your teacher?}
<C>__{frau schlumberg}
<D>__{i was. but she quite outgrew the little i could show her.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{thank you, madame.}
<P>__{(to gertrude)}
<D>__{come on now courage. play me something you know.}
<A>__{in response the wretched girl just stares down at the keyboard without playing a note. an awkward pause.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{perhaps it would be better if we were left alone. i think we're both a little shy.}
<A>__{husband and wife look at each other.}
<C>__{schlumberg}
<D>__{nonsense. strudel's not shy. she's just willful! you give into her now, you'll be sorry later. strudel play.}
<A>__{silence. the girl sits unmoving. schlumberg bellows:}
<C>__{schlumberg}
<D>__{i said play!}
<C>__{frau schlumberg}
<D>__{michael!}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{perhaps if i were to play a little first, it might encourage the fraulein.}
<P>__{(to the girl)}
<D>__{why don't you let me try the instrument? all right?}
<A>__{suddenly the girl rises. mozart smiles at the parents. they smile nervously back. mozart slides along the bench, raises his hands and preludes over the keys. instantly a dog howls loudly. startled, mozart stops. schlumberg leaps to his feet and goes over to the beagle.}
<C>__{schlumberg}
<D>__{stop that, dudelsachs! stop it at once!}
<P>__{(to mozart)}
<D>__{don't let him disturb you. he'll be all right. he's just a little willful too. please, please play. i beg you.}
<A>__{mozart resumes playing. this time it is a lively piece, perhaps the presto finale from the k. 450. the dog howls immediately.}
<C>__{schlumberg}
<D>__{stop it! stop!}
<A>__{mozart stops.}
<C>__{schlumberg}
<D>__{no, not you. i was talking to the dog. you keep playing. it's most important. he always howls when he hears music. we've got to break them of the habit. play, please. please!}
<A>__{amazed, mozart starts to play the rondo again. the dog howls louder.}
<C>__{schlumberg}
<D>__{that's it. now keep going, just keep going.}
<P>__{(to the beagle)}
<D>__{now you stop that noise, dudelsachs, you stop it this instant! this instant, do you hear me? keep going, herr mozart, that's it. go on, go on!}
<A>__{mozart plays on. suddenly the dog falls silent. schlumberg smiles broadly.}
<C>__{schlumberg}
<D>__{good, good, good! very good dog! very, very good dudelsachs.}
<P>__{(to his wife, snapping his fingers)}
<D>__{quick, quick, dear, bring his biscuit.}
<A>__{the wife scurries to get a jar of biscuits. a servant brings in an open bottle of wine and a full glass on a tray. he puts it down beside mozart as schlumberg addresses the silent dog with deepest affection.}
<C>__{schlumberg}
<D>__{now guess who's going to get a nice reward? clever, clever dudi.}
<A>__{he gives the biscuit to the dog who swallows it greedily. mozart stops playing and stands up.}
<C>__{schlumberg}
<D>__{it's a miracle, herr mozart!}
<C>__{mozart}
<P>__{(barely controlling himself)}
<D>__{well, i'm a good teacher. the next time you wish me to instruct another of your dogs, please let me know. goodbye, fraulein, goodbye, madame! goodbye, sir!}
<A>__{he bows to them and leaves the room. they look after him in puzzled astonishment.}
<C>__{frau schlumberg}
<D>__{what a strange young man.}
<C>__{schlumberg}
<D>__{yes. he is a little strange.}
