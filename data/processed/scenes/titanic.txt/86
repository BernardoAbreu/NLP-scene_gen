<P>__{(disliking the attention)}
<A>__{well, i may have knocked her together, but the idea was mr. ismay's. he envisioned a steamer so grand in scale, and so luxurious in its appointments, that its supremacy would never be challenged. and here she is...}
<P>__{(he slaps the table)}
<A>__{...willed into solid reality.}
<C>__{molly}
<A>__{why're ships always bein' called "she"? is it because men think half the women around have big sterns and should be weighed in tonnage?}

<C>__{ruth}
<A>__{you know i don't like that, rose.}

<C>__{rose}
<A>__{do you know of dr. freud? his ideas about the male preoccupation with size might be of particular interest to you, mr. ismay. andrews chockes on his breadstick, suppressing laughter.}

<C>__{rose}
<A>__{excuse me. she stalks away.}
