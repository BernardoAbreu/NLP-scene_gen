<L>__{interior mounting room night}
<A>__{we see the nymph slowly squirming in the fg, then rack focus to the rain spattered window. suddenly the overcoat man is standing on the windowsill! the window is lifted effortlesly from the outside.}
<B>__{susan}
<A>__{prepares a blue solution and places two drops on each smear slide. reflected in the glass brick behind her we see the man moving across the room.}
<B>__{the overcoat man}
<A>__{seen only through rippled glass and reflections, moves through the lab. his body steams lightly from the rain. his movements are quirky, spastic. the man observes the imprisoned insects with curiosity. he comes to the nymph, pinned and mutilated on the worktable. the nymph clicks and chitters excitedly, as if communicating with the man. he looks up at the worklight. it seems to bother him. whump!!! in a blur of motion, he smashes the light bulb.}
<B>__{susan}
<A>__{watches the smear slide. the blue droplets begin to change color once in contact with the leg section...}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{hold on a second...}
<A>__{...slowly turning a deep green.}
<C>__{siri}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{then, three large beetles fly into the room. siri looks at susan. susan gets up, hesitant, signals for siri to stay. we follow susan into the mounting room. susan's pov she walks in, barely able to see her hand in front of her face. the window facing the street is wide open, rain blowing in. something crunches under her feet. she bends down, looks. she's stepped on the broken glass of the lightbulb. the floor is alive with various insects crawling, hopping, flying away from their displays, which have been opened. the nymph is gone from the board! she looks under the work table the nymph was on. we lower as we track back with her. something is folded up in the corner of the ceiling behind her, camouflaged in the shadows, clinging impossibly to the wall.}
<B>__{the overcoat man.}
<A>__{he lowers himself with silent grace. susan whirls. whoosh! a gust of wind! a fluttering shadow off the window! silence.}
<C>__{siri }
<D>__{susan?}
<A>__{susan gasps, startled. we shift to see siri at the door.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{call security.}
