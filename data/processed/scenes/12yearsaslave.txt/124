<A>__{solomon is picking at the bark off a white maple.}
<L>__{exterior turner plantation evening}
<A>__{in a tin cup, over a fire, solomon boils the white maple bark in just a bit of water.}
<L>__{interior judge turner's plantation slaves cabin night}
<A>__{as others sleep, by the light of dying coals, solomon uses the quill to test the boiled bark. the liquid holds as a form of ink. it is no?t ideal, but it is legible on the page. armed with this, solomon writes his letter.}
<L>__{exterior turner plantation night}
<A>__{solomon sits with celeste. he relates his news to her.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{i have my letter.}
<C>__{celeste}
<D>__{yah has your freedom then?}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{all that remains is to contrive measures by which the letter can safely be deposited in the post office.}
<A>__{when celeste speaks she is quite melancholy.}
<C>__{celeste}
<D>__{i have resolved to return to my massa.}
<A>__{solomon gives an unnerved look. this is not good news.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{is it more food you need?}
<C>__{celeste}
<D>__{i live in fear.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{none will come after you in the swamps.}
<C>__{celeste}
<D>__{it ain't the patrollers i scared of... at all seasons the howling of wild animals can be heard at night along the border of the swamps. at first their calls were welcomin'. dey too was free, 'n i thought dey greeted me like a sistah. lately, dey cries have turned horrifyin'. they mean to kill celeste.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{the solitude plays tricks. it's your impression, nothing more. if you go back to your master you could face the same.}
<C>__{celeste}
<D>__{my freedom been nothin' but a daydream. so was celeste's thoughts of slaves conjoinin' in the bayou.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{better the loneliness. you have been free most of the summer. return now and your master will make example of you.}
<C>__{celeste}
<D>__{it is lonely dwellin' waiting for others who won't never come.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{go north. make your way by night...}
<C>__{celeste}
<D>__{it'll only be worse if'n celeste don't go back of her own will.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{you won't be caught. the dogs won't track you. you are...you are unique. celeste...}
<C>__{celeste}
<D>__{you got alternatives, solomon.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{to return is to die!}
<C>__{celeste}
<D>__{celeste got no one to write a letter to.}
<A>__{as if to punctuate her resolve, without a word more celeste departs toward the swamp. solomon starts on into the swamp after her.}
<C>__{solomon}
<D>__{celeste... celeste!}
<A>__{solomon continues after celeste, wading deeper into the dark night and murky waters.}
<P>__{solomon (cont’d)}
<D>__{celeste, i will guide you north! wait, and i will take you.}
<A>__{celeste is too nimble. she outpaces solomon, continues on and disappears into the night.}
<P>__{solomon (cont’d)}
<D>__{let me take you! let me go with you!}
<A>__{solomon runs on, then splashes to a stop. he stumbles around disoriented, calling into the blackness:}
<P>__{solomon (cont’d)}
<D>__{celeste...}
<A>__{nothing. no answer. not a human one. there are sounds and echoes some in the distance, some perhaps moving closer which, moment by moment, become more and more frightening. soon, solomon realizes he is in quite literally over his head; the water first chest deep, then neck deep. with no way to orient himself, no means to guide him in the dark, solomon's reserve begins to crumble. he thrashes in the water trying to find his way back to shore. no longer trying to save celeste, solomon calls to her desperately for assistance.}
<P>__{solomon (cont’d)}
<D>__{celeste! come to me, celeste!}
<A>__{in that moment solomon is quite certain he is nearly done; that he will not find land, nor aid and that this is his final moment. his panic should be that tangible. it is either force of will, or survival instinct...or maybe just pure luck that carries solomon on until he reaches first muddy ground, then firm footing. hauling himself onto the swamps edge, solomon finally collapses in a drenched, worn heap. his life spared, but celeste never to be seen again.}
