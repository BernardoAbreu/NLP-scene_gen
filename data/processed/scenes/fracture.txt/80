<L>__{interior courtroom soon after}
<A>__{mr. gifford, the crawford's neighbor, is on the stand. willy questions him, standing by the prosecution table. behind him, the court is standing room only. reporters, sketch artists, spectators. nunally, sitting near the front. lobruto, standing at the back. crawford writes intently on a legal pad, filling pages with dense scribble.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{so between the time you heard the first gunshot and called 911, and the time of mr. crawford's arrest you had the crawford house in view?}
<C>__{gifford}
<D>__{yes. i was very concerned about jennifer. she was a lovely woman.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{no one but thomas crawford came in or out?}
<C>__{gifford}
<D>__{that's correct.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{thank you, mr. gifford. no further questions.}
<C>__{judge robinson}
<D>__{mr. crawford?}
<A>__{crawford glances up at the judge. then at gifford, as if he's just noticed him up there. beat. without getting up:}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{did you see the guy run out the back door?}
<C>__{gifford}
<D>__{what..."guy"?}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{the other guy. the one who shot my wife. did you see him run out the back of the house, carrying the gun?}
<A>__{willy closes his eyes. gifford grimaces.}
<C>__{gifford}
<D>__{i couldn't see the back of the house.}
<P>__{(trying to salvage it:)}
<D>__{i believe...the police went around back when they arrived.}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{no further questions.}
<A>__{willy immediately stands:}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{re direct, your honor.}
<A>__{but crawford is standing too with his handful of pages:}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{i've also written a motion to dismiss.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{objection i'm on re direct!}
<A>__{the judge hesitates. both men standing.}
<C>__{judge robinson}
<D>__{on what grounds, mr. crawford?}
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{the prosecutor doesn't have any actual evidence.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{i'm in the middle of presenting }
<C>__{crawford}
<D>__{all of his witnesses are going to testify to the same facts: that my wife was shot and that i was, tragically, in the house at the time ...a witness and, in a way, a victim myself. i will stipulate to mr. slocum's entire witness list right now, a request a directed verdict or dismissal, per california versus collier, 1982, and the appellate court decision, v. watrus, 486.19.}
<A>__{willy stares at crawford, stunned. as the judge reluctantly nods to the bailiff to collect crawford's pages and opens a law book:}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{your legal skills seem to have improved over the long weekend, mr. crawford.}
<A>__{while the judge checks the citations, crawford glances at willy. amused. beat. willy looks down reaches into his briefcase, moves his cell phone out from under some papers. to where he can get it easily. looks back up at crawford. smiles slightly.}
<C>__{judge robinson}
<D>__{mr. slocum?}
<A>__{willy and crawford turn to the judge.}
<C>__{judge robinson}
<D>__{have you got any new evidence?}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{willy}
<D>__{may i have a moment, your honor?}
<A>__{the judge nods. willy nods down. trying to focus. he's got nothing, and everyone in the room knows it. he can hear it, he can feel it. there's a restless, hungry edge to the crowded courtroom. he stares into his open briefcase: the cell phone. next to it: the first class ticket and nikki's note. willy glances back at the gallery. nunally's eyes burn into him. in the back: lobruto frowns, concerned.}
<C>__{judge robinson}
<D>__{mr. slocum?}
<A>__{willy turns back to his briefcase. he breathes. press the menu button selects speed dial. on the tiny screen, a list of names. selected: mona cell.}
