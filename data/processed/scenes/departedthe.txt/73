<L>__{interior a harbor restaurant. boston. day}
<A>__{a lobster bib kind of place. daytime drinkers, micks in bad boat shoes, hyper aware of... costello and billy in a back table. costello, having finished his lunch, is drawing. billy is unused to being the subject of so many stares. he has sort of a coked out nervousness, dirty hair.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{don't look. there's a white van across the parking lot?}
<A>__{we see it through the smeared glass: the white van we always see. this time with a different magnetic business sign.}
<C>__{costello}
<P>__{(lifting and looking at his sketch)}
<D>__{they don't have directional microphones.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{what, do you got x ray vision?}
<C>__{costello}
<P>__{(not taking his eyes off his sketch)}
<D>__{they don't have directional microphones.}
<A>__{billy registers what seems to be inside information. costello looks over his half glasses at billy's untouched food. costello is sizing billy up: has been thinking about him.}
<C>__{costello }
<D>__{people looking at you make you self conscious?}
<A>__{billy shrugs. indicating: yeah, well, who the fuck wouldn't be.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{costello}
<D>__{why? they're minuses. they can't tell the difference between a rock star and a career criminal.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{anyone not a criminal is a minus?}
<C>__{costello}
<D>__{what are you soft? that's not what i said. eat something, jesus christ, we got a nice day by the water. sun's shining, gulls are up...nice smell of ozone...}
<A>__{two priests and a nun are sitting two tables over. an older priest and a younger one. costello notices. the nun gets up and leaves.}
<C>__{costello }
<D>__{you know if your father were alive and saw you, sitting here with me, let's say he would have a word with me about this, in fact, he'd kill seven guys just to cut my throat. and he could do it, which is something you may not know about william costigan, sr.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{he never, ah, i mean never?}
<C>__{costello}
<D>__{he kept his own counsel. he never wanted money. you can't do a thing with a man like that. your uncle jackie needed a lot of money. but even though he got his money from me, he also would kill my entire fucking family if he saw me here with you. and i think about this.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{so what are talking about here?}
<C>__{costello}
<D>__{fact is you're not a guy fresh from the zoo who wants to run a spring water distributor and i don't see you up the dog track as a general manager.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{look at it this way. it's like a tuba. i want to see if i can get something out of it.}
<A>__{costello smiles at this, then looks at his sketch.}
<C>__{costello}
<D>__{you ever think of going back to school?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{with all due respect, mr. costello, school's out.}
<C>__{costello}
<D>__{well that's your problem. maybe someday you'll wake the fuck up.}
<A>__{he gets up and leaves the table, leaving billy sitting there. costello stops to speak to the priests.}
<C>__{costello }
<D>__{good day, fathers.}
<C>__{priests}
<P>__{(terrified and simultaneously)}
<D>__{good morning [day], francis, good morning.}
<A>__{the older priest is very nervous, looking around. the younger priest concerned for his elder but personally not implicated. costello leans over the older priest, a pathetic man.}
<C>__{costello}
<D>__{you recall our chat?}
<P>__{(the older priest nods, terrified)}
<D>__{"i am as god made me", was that what you said? may i remind you, god don't run the bingo in this archdiocese.}
<C>__{young priest}
<D>__{may i remind you, mr. costello, that pride comes before the fall.}
<C>__{costello}
<D>__{what comes before the fall is the summertime.}
<A>__{costello notices that the nun is heading back to the table.}
<C>__{costello }
<D>__{how is sister mary theresa doing? we had a tasty relationship before she took her vows. enjoy your clams, cocksuckers.}
