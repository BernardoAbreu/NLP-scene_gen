<L>__{exterior kingpin bowling day}
<A>__{titan is standing in front of the bowling alley, trying to decide on an appropriate pose for the occasion.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{what pose would be best? the corny folded arms thing?}
<A>__{he demonstrates, arching his chin proudly in the air.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{or maybe on the hips, like this.}
<A>__{it's the classic superman pose, only not as masculine.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{no, makes me look like a flamer pirate.}
<A>__{as titan starts to fix his hair in the window, frank pretends to fix the lens on his camera as he speaks to roxanne.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{shouldn't we be making a run for it right about now?}
<C>__{roxanne}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{the guy can outrun bullets. i don't think either one of us is in that kind of shape.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{she's right, frank.}
<A>__{frank looks up, stunned that titan could have possibly heard him.}
<C>__{titan}
<D>__{also got super hearing. i promise not to keep the both of you long, but you'll thank me when this is all over.}
<A>__{frank and roxanne exchange helpless expressions.}
