<L>__{interior deck 47 corridor}
<A>__{as worf lands on his feet. the light is dim, no power on this deck, hard to see. he looks around warily for a moment, phaser at the ready, then activates his wrist beacon. we immediately notice that we can see worf's breath it's freezing cold down here. he shines the light around the darkened corridor, then silently motions his arm for the others to follow. a beat, then we see the security officers start to drop into the corridor from the hatch above... new angle corridor as worf's squad spreads out along the hall, weapons at the ready, everyone alert with fingers on the triggers. we see that the phaser rifles are equipped with their own light sources, intended to illuminate the target before you shoot at it. the security officers are constantly moving their lights back and forth through the chilly air. worf gives hand signals holds up two fingers, then a fist, and points forward. two guards trot down the corridor about fifteen feet, stop, and take up firing positions... then two more members of the team run down, leap frog ahead of them and take positions further down the corridor. classic military deployment. worf starts scanning with a tricorder.}

<D>__{riker here.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{there's a dampening field in place on this deck. our tricorders are useless.}
<A>__{the team continue to explore deck 47. it's spooky, eerie, a sense of menace around every corner. they open doors, check room by room, section by section, still no sign of the borg in the freezing cold darkness.}
<B>__{angle on security guard}
<A>__{the corridor directly ahead has been stripped of wall, ceiling and deck panels all the normal decorative enterprise sheathing is gone, revealing the circuitry and machinery of the ship itself. unlike the rest of the corridors, there does appear to be power flowing through some of the conduits up ahead, and it gives off an eerie glow. we can also see that some of the machinery has been altered and changed not just the neat and orderly arrangement you'd expect to find behind bulkheads there's a sense of cross circuitry, re wiring, equipment being rearranged. clearly, a lot of work has gone on in this area of the ship. worf steps forward, examines the corridor closely.}
<C>__{ensign hawk}
<D>__{what the hell is going on?}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{borg...}
<A>__{worf signals the team forward, and they slowly begin picking their way down the borgified corridor. it's not easy they have to choose their footing carefully as they walk through the maze of cables, circuits, and machinery... ensign hawk accidentally steps on some circuitry, which gives off a beep. the entire team suddenly whirls their lights and weapons on the unfortunate ensign, who pales at their sudden attention. worf looks irritated, then motions his team to continue their search. they continue making their way down the spooky corridor... and as they turn a corner... new angle another corridor where the machinery is now thicker and more borg like in appearance. tubes and cabling hang down from the ceiling. if anything, it's even colder in here. the deeper they go, the worse it gets. we can now hear a low, sinister hum of alien power. at the end of this corridor is the enviromental control room, as seen earlier. the entire doorway is gone and a weird pulsing glow fills the room. worf stops his team at the sight. from this vantage, we cannot see directly into the room, but clearly something is going on in there. worf signals his men to spread out, and they take up positions around the corridor, all weapons trained on environmental control.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{worf to bridge. we're about to enter the environmental control room.}
<C>__{riker's com voice}
<D>__{any sign of data, or the borg themselves?}
<A>__{as work and riker continue talking, we move to ensign hawk, who is now the last man in the formation, covering the rear. he's shining his phaser beacon into the empty darkness. he can't help looking back over his shoulder at the rest of the team and the distant environmental control room that seems to be where the action is. as he turns, his beacon moves with him, throwing the corridor behind them in and out of darkness.}
<C>__{worf}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{negative. however, they've reconfigured the odn network... and re routed all power on this deck into environmental control.}
<A>__{as worf speaks, ensign hawk turns back, but this time when he shines his beacon into the darkness, something moves in the distance a shadow. the ensign freezes, brings his rifle up. but did he see it, or was it his imagination? a tense beat as he waits, heart pounding... but nothing happens. on the wall next to his head we see what can only be described as a bio mechanistic cable creeping out of the wall... which begins slowly heading for the ensign's neck. just as he begins to sense that something is happening behind him, the cable whips out around his neck and yanks him deep into the bed of circuitry in the blink of an eye the motion so fast we have trouble following it. worf turns his head at the sound.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{stand by, commander}
<P>__{(to team)}
<D>__{where's ensign hawk?}
<A>__{everyone looks around, surprised that he's not there. everyone is alert, keyed up. the tension is thick. utter silence, except for the hum of the machinery and the frosty breathing of the team.}
<C>__{riker's com voice}
<D>__{worf? is something wrong?}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{something is very wrong, commander. we're falling back.}
<A>__{worf gives hand signals for the team to move out. but just as they start to fall back, everything happens at once.}
<B>__{borg drones}
<A>__{explode out of the walls, ceiling and floor! what follows is a blur of action happening so fast and furious we never get a true sense of what's happening. a flurry of violence and motion and images: a snarling borg face half human, half machine, a cybernetic nightmare. strange, bio mechanical weapons extruding from borg bodies, ripping into human flesh. a crewmember pulled into a bed of machinery.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{fire at will!}
<A>__{but the borg are already on top of them. it's a brutal fight in close quarters with no escape. phasers and borg lasers lighting up the corridor, bodies flying through the air... utter chaos and terror. the fight goes hand to hand and worf sees that they don't have a chance...}
<C>__{worf}
<P>__{(throwing off a borg)}
<D>__{fall back!}
<A>__{the team starts backpedaling, firing as they go...but the borg are unstoppable now they put up personal force fields to protect themselves.}
<C>__{worf}
<D>__{go, go, go!}
<A>__{worf pushes his men down the corridor. everyone turns and runs like hell. worf bends down and grabs a frightened lieutenant by the collar, pulling him along.}
