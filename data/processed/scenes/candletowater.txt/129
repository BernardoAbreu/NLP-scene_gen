<L>__{3.76 interior church day}
<A>__{jaden and austen kneel beside paul in prayer. except that jaden only kneels on one knee and austen on neither; and neither of them are really praying. beside them paul prays with worshipers in the congregation of a dozen or so. jaden's hoodie hood is down out of respect. austen has his hoodie hood up. jaden pulls it down. austen throws him a look, kisses his tongue. jaden's eyes darken. austen relents. jaden looks over, sees a man who seems wrong in here. he twigs: plain clothes cop. cops don't pray and this one is.}
