<A>__{a close up of rimgale popping the molding around the door frame of holcomb's burned office. underneath can be seen traces of the same white residue from the other fires.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{i thought 'ol marty was acting a little strange... and he's right.}
<A>__{rimgale rubs the white powder between his fingers.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{backdraft?}
<A>__{rimgale stands at the spot in the short hall where the body lied between two doors.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{the backdraft was set somewhere in there. it fried holcomb when he opened the inner door. but the outer door held... and waited for tim...}
<A>__{brian steps into the inner office.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{so find me the fire.}
<A>__{brian begins searching, probing. he finally stands. defeated.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{you're thinking too much of the building and not enough of the ghost.}
<A>__{brian's eyes don't understand. from rimgale's coat comes a plastic flask. he pours out of it a liquid onto the floor and lights a match.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{in a word, brian, what is this job all about?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{fire.}
<A>__{rimgale drops the match. wump. a small flame explodes to life.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{it's a living thing, brian. it breathes, it eats, and it hates.}
<A>__{the fire's climbing a wall, chewing a corner.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{the only way to beat it is to think like it. to know that this flame will spread this way across the floor not because of the physics of flammable liquids or heat convection, but because it wants to.}
<A>__{fwump. it darts west. licks the ceiling. the fire purrs and hisses. stretches luxuriously and attacks savagely.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{some guys on this job, fire owns them. it makes them fight on its level. but the only way to truly kill it is to love it a little, just like ronald.}
<A>__{brian stares at the flame. a goblin reaching out for him... woosh! rimgale hits it with a fire extinguisher. in an instant the goblin is gone, the genie in the bottle.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{what the hell are you guys doin'?}
<A>__{a young woman's entered.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{we're the fire department, lady.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{well color me stupid, i always thought the fire dept. put out fires.}
<C>__{shadow}
<P>__{(to woman)}
<D>__{you work here?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{till yesterday. what do you think the odds are that a non refundable ticket to paris survived this?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{somewhere between zero and no way.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{shit. what a mess.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{you seem real broken up about mr. holcomb.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{jeff holcomb? the darth vader of tax accountants? he was a sleezeball. hopefully a sleezeball that carried some insurance.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{go talk to the building owner.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{he was the building owner.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{our book lists the owner as dekom trust.}
<A>__{she looks at him like he's the dumbest human she's met all week.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{don't investigators come in adult size?}
