<L>__{interior upstairs hallway moments later}
<A>__{lori walks toward the apartment, but stops as she hears loud music coming from inside. she approaches the door cautiously and opens it, revealing...}
<L>__{interior john and lori's apartment continuous}
<A>__{lori enters a haze of pot smoke, and a very much trashed apartment (empty bottles, wrappers, etc.). ted sits on the sofa with a small group of trashy looking women. they're watching "romancing the stone," which plays very loudly on the tv.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{what the hell is all this?!}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{lori! hey, you're home early! the ladies and i were just watching "romancing the stone." got it on blu ray. came in a two pack with "jewel of the nile," but i don't know that we'll end up watchin' that one.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{this place is a wreck! who are these girls?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{oh, where are my manners? lori, this is angelique, heavenly, cherene, and sauvignon blanc. i love you girls. y'know, somewhere out there are four terrible fathers i wish i could thank for this great night.}
<A>__{the girls ad lib "hello," "nice to meet you," etc. lori glances around the room, then screams as she sees something in the corner.}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{what is that?!!!}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{what's what?}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{there is... a shit in the corner! on the floor! there's a shit!}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(looking over)}
<D>__{oh man, that's what dierdre was doin' over there in the corner for so long. remember, she was crouched over there and i thought she was just makin' a call or somethin' }
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{there is a shit!! on my floor!!}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yeah, she's passed out in the bathroom now, she seemed like she was hopped up on somethin'. i mean, mystery solved, i guess }
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{what the fuck!!!!}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{lori, if i can now this is just speculation, but... is it possible that this is not so much about the stool in the corner, and more about maybe tonight's dinner not measuring up to your expectations?}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{what!!! the fuck!!!}
<A>__{lori is speechless with rage. at that moment, we see the lobster head poke in aggressively from behind the door.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{raaarrrr!!}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{ahaaaaa!}
<P>__{john (v.o., as lobster)}
<D>__{who lives here? i'm comin' to get whoever lives here! you owe me lobster money!}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(to girl)}
<D>__{hahaaa! that's my friend john. not the lobster, the guy runnin' it.}
<A>__{at that moment, john enters, holding his cell phone.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{found my phone.}
<A>__{he stops, seeing everyone there.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{what's goin' on?}
<P>__{(then, noticing)}
<D>__{is that a shit?}
