<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{i haven't had a chance to read it, but i'm sure it goes something like "yahdah yahdah yahdah you mean a lot to me. yahdah yahdah yahdah i hope we can be friends. etcetera, etcetera, etcetera." you see, i expected your sort of bullshit so i took the liberty of phoning ronald and cecile. right now they're having a little get together in my love shack at the grand central hyatt. i'm so sorry he chose cecile over you, but i promised him i would see you through your crisis.}

<C>__{sebastian }
<D>__{what's so funny?}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{silly rabbit. my triumph isn't over her. it's over you.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{come again?}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{you were very much in love with her and you're still in love with her. but it amused me to make you ashamed of it. you gave up on the first person you ever loved because i called you names. don't get me wrong, i'm flattered that you chose me over her, but please understand, i never loved you, sebastian. you're just a toy. a little toy i play with. and now you've completely blown it with her. i think that's the saddest thing i've ever heard.}

<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i'm very sorry about that. i apologize.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{i accept. now get out.}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{get out? we had an arrangement.}
<C>__{kathryn}
<D>__{didn't you hear what i said?}
<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{i don't care what you said, we had an agreement. you've slept with half of the borough so don't tell me you're being choosy.}
