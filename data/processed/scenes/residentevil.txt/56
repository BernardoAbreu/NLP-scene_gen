<L>__{int crawl space timeless}
<A>__{one by one, the members of alpha team wiggle up into the crawl space above the ceiling. chris climbs up behind jill. other troopers are already away, following wesker, who guides them with the help of his chart. jill starts after them. chris grabs her arm.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{jill, i... i'm sorry. i'm just... angry. when i... thought you were gone, i... then... when i saw you. alive. i realized that...}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{that you were still... fascinated.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{stop. stop!}
<A>__{he pulls her into an embrace. she goes willingly.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{come with me. we can get out of here.}
<C>__{jill}
<P>__{(tempted) i...i want to. i want...}
<D>__{nothing more. but... i can't. when i'm in this uniform, i'm more than... just me. try to understand...there's no "i" in team, chris.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{there's no "i" in dead, either.}
<A>__{chris pulls away from the embrace and looks at her.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{i should order you to come with me. you'd never refuse an order.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{you go. you're not part of this.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i'm part of it as. long as you are.}
<C>__{barry }
<D>__{this is very uncomfortable.}
<A>__{barry, having overheard, is halfway up through the grate.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{for me, too, brother.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{i mean this... (indicating the}
<P>__{iron that's pressing his belly.)}
<D>__{it's very uncomfortable.}
<A>__{chris and jill help barry up into the crawl space. start off after the troop. the camera tracks them.}
<C>__{barry }
<D>__{this is gettin' old, man, i swear. i been in this army eighteen years.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{eighteen years?}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{yep. two away from the big re ti.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{desk job, right? nobody lasts that long if they've seen action.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{i've seen action in granada. and desert storm. would have lost it all there... if my buddy didn't bring in a team, against orders, to pull my ass out. buddy named... wesker.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{you've been with this asshole since... ?}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{since before that. we were... kids together. macon, georgia. he's... only an asshole some of the time...}
<A>__{up ahead : wesker reaches a service ladder. he waves his troop on. they start to climb down.}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{who knows what we'll find down there?}
<C>__{aiken}
<D>__{think positive. the farther down we go, the worse it's gonna get. so... until we hit bottom, we're in good shape... relatively speaking.}
<A>__{grrraaaawwwlr.! distant... but distinct... it sounds like the mgm lion.}
<C>__{speyer}
<D>__{what the fuck?}
<A>__{again .grrrrraaaaawwwwllll !}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{whatever it is.. .it can't get us. we're in the ceiling!}
