<L>__{int service corridor timeless}
<A>__{...the corridor. they catch up with the troop which is clustered at a blind alley which has two doors.}
<C>__{wesker}
<P>__{(checking his map) it's not clear...}
<D>__{which way to go.}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{want me to flip a coin?}
<A>__{wesker is annoyed by the remark. decisively, he selects one of the doors and uses his green key card. with a bzzzz, the lock releases. the troop enters...}
<L>__{int systems center timeless}
<A>__{...a vast room, fifty by fifty yards. it's filled with heaters, air conditioners, water pumps. main frames for the internal computer network line one wall, fuse boxes and switcher panels another. this is the systems center for the entire facility. there's an attendant's desk just inside the door. aiken and sullivan drag it over to prop the door open. it makes a frightening sound as it scrapes the floor, echoing, bouncing around in the large space. it prompts a response... another of those animal like snarls from somewhere in the distance.}
<C>__{sullivan}
<D>__{what's that sound like to you? alken a meat eater.}
<A>__{there are thick columns, floor to ceiling, every ten feet. the spaces between them are very dark. it's hard to see. wesker and some of the others click on their flashlights . beams cut through dust. there are electronic hums.. clicks and chatters emit from the switchers, pings from the heaters, all combining to fray everyone's nerves. light beams dance nervously as the commandos start out across the dark and frightening space.}
<C>__{chris}
<P>__{(softly to jill) this is the heart}
<D>__{of the whole place. they've got to have it... protected somehow.}
<A>__{two things happen, almost at once. first.. .chris notices electric eyes... on all of the columns.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{duck! hit the deck!}
<A>__{second. a zombie lurches around a corner and bites a chunk out of marini's face. jill whirls around to shoot at the zombie, but chris grabs her and flattens her on the floor. marini, staggering, screaming in pain, triggers the first electric eye. laser beams shoot in all directions, forming a tight net. chris and jill are barely beneath them. many of the other troopers are hit by the beams... which do no immediate harm... but wherever they make contact, small cylinders above the electric eyes begin to hiss.}
<C>__{chris }
<D>__{for chrissake, get down!}
<A>__{the commandos duck under the laser beams... just in time. jets of steam spout from the cylinders. it's not just hot steam. it's acidic, deadly. marini is hit by it. his clothes ignite. his flesh boils. it's a horrible sight, but for the moment, the jets stop. marini is dead on his feet. when he falls, he trips another of the laser beams. the steam jets spout again. the troop is beneath them, though many are burned by liquid drops that spit from the nozzles. amazingly, the zombie has avoided contact. but as it begins to stumble after commandos, we realize it's going to activate the sensors again.}
<C>__{sullivan}
<D>__{there's no way outta this mousetrap!}
<C>__{rodriguez}
<D>__{so we live here now?}
<C>__{speyer}
<D>__{we gotta run for it.}
<A>__{the zombie hits one of the laser beams. the steam hisses out again. the zombie is melted.}
<C>__{aiken}
<D>__{bad idea, speyer.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{down. through these.}
<A>__{chris has noticed a series of hinged panels in the floor.}
<C>__{vickers}
<D>__{where do they go?}
<C>__{sullivan}
<D>__{does it matter?}
<A>__{sullivan whips out a swiss army knife and goes to work on the screws that hold down one of the panels. other troopers do the same. another zombie lurches out of the darkness. and another. human hands work furiously, loosening screws. panels come up, troopers begin to duck through the openings. a second zombie hits a red beam. steam again. chris and jill are spattered. burned. but jill bravely keeps working with her own issued knife. she gets a panel open. as she drops through, a third zombie triggers a burst of steam. chris ducks and covers. when the jets stop, chris begins to climb into the opening, but one of his legs is grabbed from behind by... ...one of the dead things which has already been melted! its flesh is bubbling. bone is beginning to show. but the acid hasn't reached its brain yet. the creature is still alive. chris cries out. acid from the zombie's hands is burning his leg. the thing's lips have been eaten away, making its teeth look frighteningly skeletal as it leans forward for a bite of flesh. chris jams the stock of his winchester into the zombie's mouth. he's able to hold the thing's head back, but he's stuck. he can't let go. jill pops up out of the floor. she presses the barrel of her own weapon into the zombie's forehead.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{on three...}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{one... two...}
<A>__{chris pulls his rifle away. at the same instant, jill fires. the zombie is propelled through the air. one of its flailing arms triggers another laser beam. chris throws himself in on top of jill as steam hisses over them. twenty yards away, wesker crawls under the cloud of acid. just as he climbs down through one of the openings, he feels pressure...on his ear. a groping zombie has accidentally hooked its fingers onto the wire that runs from the detonator to wesker's ear piece. for a breathless moment, it seems like the sensor will be popped loose. holding the pulse reader in place, wesker twists his body, lifts his hand gun, and pumps three into the dead thing's brain. the zombie flops over, but its fingers cling, entangled, in the wire. wesker plants his pistol barrel on the knuckles of the thing's dead hand. three more shots cut through bone, removing the fingers from the hand. the wire is freed. wesker dives into the opening in the floor.}
