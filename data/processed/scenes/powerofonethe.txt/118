<L>__{interior prison yard night}
<A>__{the guards, all in crisp uniforms, patrol nervously, truncheons at the ready. the towers bristle with guns as hundreds of black prisoners file into the yard.}
<C>__{pk }
<D>__{finally the night of the concert arrived. the prison atmosphere, normally tense, was keening. each prisoner entering the yard is searched. it was prison policy to keep tribal rivalries boiling. divide and conquer. the policy of control. pk (v.o.) (cont'd) this was to be the first time in the history of the south african prison system that the tribes were allowed to mingle. and if trouble came, it would be the last.}
<A>__{all the prisoners are seated on the ground behind doc, who is raised with the piano on a small stage. guards surround the prisoners a solid, edgy border encasing a black center. the front of the yard is filled with seats on which sit the kommandant, his wife, assorted prison brass, politicians, and a smattering of the local afrikaan hierarchy. pk is overseeing the seating of the prisoners when doc comes up to him.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{have you seen my page turner?}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{he asks a prisoner in zulu.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{have you seen geel piet?}
<A>__{the man shakes his head. pk looks worried.}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(reassuring)}
<D>__{he will come.}
<A>__{the kommandant, all medals and polished leather, mounts the stage, signaling a beginning to the festivities.}
<C>__{von zyl}
<D>__{where is bormann? i need bormann to translate to the prisoners.}
<C>__{smit}
<D>__{i don't know, kommandant.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{is there a problem here, kommandant?}
<C>__{von zyl}
<D>__{i want to address these filthy kaffirs but i don't have a translator.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{i will translate.}
<C>__{von zyl}
<D>__{you can speak zulu, pk?}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{von zyl}
<D>__{all right. listen up.}
<A>__{he addresses the prisoners.}
<C>__{von zyl}
<D>__{tell them this concert is the gift to them from the professor who, even though he is in prison, is not a dirty criminal like them but a man of culture and learning.}
<C>__{pk}
<P>__{(subtitled)}
<D>__{the kommandant welcomes you and looks forward to the great singing.}
<C>__{von zyl}
<D>__{for such a man i am happy to do this. but one hair of trouble and it's finish.}
<C>__{pk}
<P>__{(subtitled)}
<D>__{he hopes each tribe will sing its best and bring honor to its people.}
<C>__{von zyl}
<D>__{one wrong move and you get marched back to your cells and don't come out for a month.}
<C>__{pk}
<P>__{(subtitled)}
<D>__{he says tonight let us be one people under the african sky.}
<A>__{the prisoners break into spontaneous applause. von zyl looks at pk, unsuspecting, pleased.}
<C>__{von zyl}
<D>__{you did a good job.}
<C>__{pk}
<D>__{thank you, sir.}
<C>__{von zyl}
<D>__{professor?}
<A>__{he turns the stage over to the professor and takes his seat. the professor sits at his stool, poised. pk, in front of the singers, watches him for a cue. doc drops his head. pk points to a group of singers. music and voice blend spontaneously. "the concerto for the great southland" begins. doc plays magnificently with great style. pk focuses on leading the singers. each section, each tribe singing its own songs with its own distinct cultural imprints on rhythm, pace and tone.}
<B>__{close up on pk}
<A>__{leading the singers in and out of the music.}
<B>__{flash to truncheon}
<A>__{being raised and lowered on a familiar back.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{pk is caught short by the flash. he falters a bit, then regains his concentration.}
<B>__{flash to truncheon}
<A>__{coming down on a familiar head geel peit's.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{instinctively the first four prisoners in each group, the leaders, stand and turn to face their people. they take up the lead. pk, distracted by his inner vision, runs off stage. doc looks after him, worried, but keeps playing.}
