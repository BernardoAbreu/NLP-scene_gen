<A>__{david sits on the porch holding a drink, a bottle of black bush in the chair beside him. he's staring at nothing. constance comes out the open sliding glass door, wearing a turtleneck sweater and wrapped in her afghan. she goes to the chair beside him, picks up the bottle and sits. they silently survey the yard, the sunset. she hugs the bottle, he sips his drink.}
