<A>__{"the whole conviction of my life now rests upon the belief that loneliness, far from being a rare and curious phenomenon, is the central and inevitable fact of human existence." thomas wolfe, "god's lonely man" travis bickle, age 26, lean, hard, the consummate loner. on the surface he appears good looking, even handsome; he has a quiet steady look and a disarming smile which flashes from nowhere, lighting up his whole face. but behind that smile, around his dark eyes, in his gaunt cheeks, one can see the ominous stains caused by a life of private fear, emptiness and loneliness. he seems to have wandered in from a land where it is always cold, a country where the inhabitants seldom speak. the head moves, the expression changes, but the eyes remain ever fixed, unblinking, piercing empty space. travis is now drifting in and out of the new york city night life, a dark shadow among darker shadows. not noticed, no reason to be noticed, travis is one with his surroundings. he wears rider jeans, cowboy boots, a plaid western shirt and a worn beige army jacket with a patch reading, "king kong company 1968 70". he has the smell of sex about him: sick sex, repressed sex, lonely sex, but sex nonetheless. he is a raw male force, driving forward; toward what, one cannot tell. then one looks closer and sees the evitable. the clock sprig cannot be wound continually tighter. as the earth moves toward the sun, travis bickle moves toward violence. film opens on exterior of manhattan cab garage. weather beaten sign above driveway reads, "taxi enter here". yellow cabs scuttle in and out. it is winter, snow is piled on the curbs, the wind is howling. inside garage are parked row upon row of multi colored taxis. echoing sounds of cabs idling, cabbies talking. steamy breath and exhaust fill the air.}
