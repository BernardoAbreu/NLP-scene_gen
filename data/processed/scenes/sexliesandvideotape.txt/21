<L>__{interior graham's apartment day}
<A>__{on a television monitor we see images originating from an 8mm video deck. graham sits naked in a sheet covered chair facing the screen. he watches the tape, which is footage of himself interviewing a girl about her sexual preferences. the photography on the tape is handheld, relentless. as the questions get more detailed, graham becomes more aroused. there is a knock on graham's door. he calmly shuts off the videotape player and stands, wrapping the sheet around himself.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{it's open.}
<A>__{graham walks into the bedroom to put on some clothes. ann opens the door and walks into the apartment.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{hi!}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{ann. hello.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{are you in the middle of something?}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{nothing i can't finish later.}
<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(looks)}
<D>__{i just wanted to see how the place looked furnished.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{not much to see, i'm afraid. i'm sort of cultivating a minimalist vibe.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{somehow i imagined books. i thought you would have like a whole lot of books and be reading all the time.}
<A>__{graham enters.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i do read a lot. but i check everything out of the library.}
<A>__{graham picks up an anais nin diary and opens it to show ann the library sleeve inside.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{cheaper that way. and cuts down on the clutter.}
<A>__{ann walks to the table where the video gear is set up. graham watches her closely. she looks into a large box of 8mm videotapes. on the side of each tape is a label. the labels look like this:}
<D>__{donna 11 dec 86 1:07:36}
<A>__{and so on. there are thirty or forty tapes, total.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{what are these?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{videotapes.}
<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i can see that. what are they?}
<A>__{graham exhales.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{it's a personal project i'm working on.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{what kind of personal project?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{oh, just a personal project like anyone else's personal project. mine's just a little more personal.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{who's donna?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{donna?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{donna. on this tape it says "donna".}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{donna was a girl i knew in florida.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{you went out with her?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{not really.}
<A>__{ann looks in the box again.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{how come all these are girl's names?}
<A>__{graham thinks for a moment.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{because i enjoy interviewing women more than men.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{all of these are interviews?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{can we look at one?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{because i promised each subject that no one would look at the tape except me.}
<A>__{ann looks at graham for a long moment, then back at the tapes.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{what...what are these interviews about?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{the...interviews are about sex, ann.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{about sex?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{what about sex?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{everything about sex.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{like what they've done, what they do, what they don't do, what they want to do but are afraid to ask for, what they won't do even if asked. anything i can think of.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{you just ask them questions?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{and they just answer them?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{mostly. sometimes they do things.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{to you?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{no, not to me, for me, for the camera.}
<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{i don't ...why...why do you do this?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i'm sorry this came up.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{this is just...so...}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{maybe you want to go.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{yes, i do.}
<A>__{ann nods and absently heads for the door. she gives graham a puzzled look before leaving.}
