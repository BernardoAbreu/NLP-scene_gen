<L>__{interior barbizon plaza theatre dressing room night (1964)}
<A>__{jake lamotta, wearing a tux, is shadow boxing. we are unsure of where he is he moves in and out of the shadows. at 42, he's overweight and out of shape, but the balls of his feet still pop up and down like they were on canvas and his tiny fists still jerk forward with short bursts of light. he is rehearsing a nightclub monologue.}

<D>__{good evening, ladies and gentlemen. it's a thrill to be standing here talking to you wonderful people. in fact, it's a thrill to be standing! i haven't seen so many people since my last fight at madison square garden. after that fight, a reporter asked me, 'jake, where do you go from here?' i said, 'to a hospital!' i fought one hundred and six professional fights and still none of them bums figured out how to fight me they kept hitting me in the head! and that's why i'm here tonight...}
