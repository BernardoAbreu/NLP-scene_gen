<T>__{fade to black:}
<L>__{interior main trading floor fifteen minutes later}
<A>__{seth and will walk through the door and into the empty main trading floor. the lights are down and there is a cleaning person vacuuming in the far background. they walk over to peter's desk.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{hey, look who it is, burning the candle at both ends. there aren't anymore cuts planned though, so you can stop kissing my ass, honestly i don't even understand what you guys do.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{will, i am so sorry to call you back but i really think..}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{don't worry about it.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{hey.}
<A>__{will is a bit drunk but seth looks at peter's face and realizes something is up.}
<C>__{seth }
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{look at this.}
<A>__{seth comes around and sits at peter's desk.}
<C>__{peter }
<D>__{eric gave me this file before he left.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{eric?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{dale. and he told me he couldn't quite figure it out, then the last thing he says as the doors on the elevator close is `be careful'.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{be careful?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{so i'm obviously a little curious. so i get into it a bit and i realize that all he was missing was...well it's not good.}
<A>__{seth looks at the screen and starts to scroll through the pages.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{what is he doing here?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{go to model four, and it makes more sense.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{will is now paying closer attention, standing over their shoulder.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{this is basically everything that we have on our books at any given time. but what eric was trying to do here is work it for levels of volatility that fall outside the limits of our standard var model.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{what are those levels.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{well it's a fairly complicated...}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{simplify.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{the volatility boundaries are basically set using historic patterns then stretching them out another 10 15%... roughly.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{so what's happening?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{we are starting to test those historic patterns.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{when?}
<A>__{peter starts scrolling back through the last couple weeks on his screen}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{today.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{tuesday.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{monday, last friday, last wednesday and monday.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{two fridays ago.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{i get it.}
<A>__{seth scrolls the final page on the graph.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{fuck me... once this thing gets going in the wrong direction...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yeah...}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{it's huge.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{how huge?}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{the losses are greater than the current value of the company...?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{projected losses... projected...}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{fuck me.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{wait, and this is just our floor?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{yeah...}
<A>__{they all look at each other long and hard.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{where the fuck is eric dale?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i can't find him, they cut off his phone.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{will starts off towards his office and is suddenly quite sober. peter and seth follow him.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{they turned off everyone's phone who they axed today.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{fucking ruthless. and he's got no other cell?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{will emerson}
<D>__{how does he not have his own cellphone?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i tried, it's been turned off.}
