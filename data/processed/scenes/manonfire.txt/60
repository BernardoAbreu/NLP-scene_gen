<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{please?}
<A>__{her little hand comes over the top of the seat with a pencil. creasy takes it, slows to let the corolla catch up. he squints into the mirror to read the plate. lisa is oblivious, but as pinta looks back over her shoulder... brake lights up ahead. creasy lurches to a stop. the corolla swerves around them disappears ahead.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{the traffic takes some getting used to.}
<A>__{as creasy cranes for a view, another white corolla comes by headed the opposite way. they're everywhere. this relaxes creasy's paranoia. as he laughs to himself.}
