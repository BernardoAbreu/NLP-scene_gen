<L>__{exterior parking lot day}
<A>__{a desolate gas station parking lot. bloom sits in the bug, loading his revolver with shaky fingers. penelope stands outside.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{stephen, god please what's happening. i don't know what to do. i don't know stephen please. please. what's happening. please.}
<A>__{a long black sedan screeches to a halt in the parking lot outside the window, bloom bolts out of the car, pistol ready. but the chink climbs out of the black sedan.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{where does she get all these cars?}
<A>__{bloom motions for penelope to stay back, then goes to meet the chink in the middle of the parking lot.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{if you know what's happening, now would be a really good time to speak up.}
<A>__{she sets a suitcase down beside her. bloom takes this in.}
<C>__{bloom }
<D>__{no, please. not now. i need your help here now, i don't know what to do.}
<A>__{the slightest smile communicates all the compassion in the world. but she's leaving. she hands him a small slip of paper, their fingers touching for an instant. she gives penelope a quick little "call me" gesture, picks up her case and walks off. a truck blocking our view of her car pulls away, and she gets in. bloom looks down at the slip of paper. a short phrase, in chinese.}
<C>__{bloom }
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{the engine turns over, and the chink's car explodes in a dramatic fireball. the paper flutters out of blooms's fingers a moment before he and penelope are thrown to the pavement by the shock wave. bloom and penelope lift their heads, absorbing what just happened.}
