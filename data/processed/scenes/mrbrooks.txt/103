<A>__{it's in an industrial park. mr. smith exits one of the doors and continues on into the parking lot to a moderately expensive foreign car sitting in a space identified by a sign which reads: mr. baffert. he squeezes the 'disarm' button on his key chain. the car chirps twice and he opens the door. bending his knees to get in, he stops. there is a section of newspaper wedged in the steering wheel. when his brain unlocks he straightens up and moving only the top of his body, makes a quick recon of the surrounding area and his back seat. nothing threatening seen, he eases into the seat. slam! the door is closed and locked.}
