<C>__{dan}
<D>__{well ... it's the second one i've had, but they were both the same......they start out that i'm in here but it's not day or night. it's kinda half night, but it looks just like this except for the light, but i'm scared like i can't tell ya. of all people you're standing right over there by that counter. you're in both dreams and you're scared. i get even more frightened when i see how afraid you are and then i realize what it is there's a man...in back of this place. he's the one ... he's the one that's doing it. i can see him through the wall. i can see his face and i hope i never see that face ever outside a dream.}
<A>__{herb stares at dan to see if he will continue. dan looks around nervously, then stares at his uneaten food.}
<C>__{dan }
<D>__{that's it.}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{so, you came to see if he's out there?}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{to get rid of this god awful feeling.}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{right then.}
<A>__{herb gets up, picks up the bill and goes to the cashier to pay. dan just sits. as herb is paying the bill he looks over at dan just as dan is turning to look at him. from dan's point of view herb is standing in exactly the same spot as he stood in the dream. herb gets a strange feeling, turns back and finishes up with the cashier. he motions for dan to follow him. dan rises reluctantly and he and herb make their way outside.}
