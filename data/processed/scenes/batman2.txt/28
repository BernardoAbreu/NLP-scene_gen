<A>__{free time the cell doors are open and the convicts are milling around in the common area. t bone, 220 lbs. of dumb, hulking beef, saunters up to his cell and finds his bunkmate, mr. boniface, staring at a stack of empty cages. boniface whirls on him suddenly, his face beet red, apoplectic with}
<T>__{rage:}
<C>__{mr. boniface}
<D>__{ where are my birds?!? t bone shit, pengy. i let 'em go.}
<C>__{mr. boniface}
<D>__{hermione. my canary. it's the dead of winter!}
<A>__{t bone flops casually on his bunk, obviously enjoying mr. boniface's profound distress.}
<D>__{t bone they were all cooped up. with you leaving and all seemed like the humane thing to do.}
<A>__{boniface's gaze falls on a corner of the cell. he spots a scattering of yellow feathers a patch of fresh blood. with a supreme effort of restraint, he turns and forces a smile...}
<C>__{mr. boniface}
<D>__{i see. you might as well have this. i won't be needing it...}
<A>__{he tosses a sony walkman to t bone, who flicks it on. the dim strains of classical music are audible through the earphones...}
<D>__{t bone well, thanks, pengy. no hard feelings.}
<P>__{(chuckling to himself)}
<D>__{y'know, i'm gonna miss that pudgy little ass of yours.}
<A>__{t bone tunes the walkman to a rock station, slips the headset on, grins from his bunk. two guards arrive. as they escort him out, mr. boniface mutters:}
<C>__{mr. boniface}
<D>__{you won't miss it long.}
