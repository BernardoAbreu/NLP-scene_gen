<C>__{danny }
<D>__{see. no matter how bad things are, there's always someone a little worse off.}

<D>__{nevertheless, i still try to see the glass as half full.}
<A>__{he takes a sip.}
<C>__{danny }
<D>__{problem is, it's usually half full of something that tastes a lot like urine.}
<A>__{he pulls a face. sets the glass down.}
<C>__{colette}
<D>__{could be worse.}

<C>__{danny }
<D>__{quincey. you sure he isn't gonna come looking for you?}
<C>__{colette}
<D>__{don't worry, he's probably passed out with his head in the toilet by now.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{this man sounds like a real catch.}
<C>__{colette}

<C>__{danny}
<D>__{look, it's really none of my business but why don't you just dump this guy?}
<C>__{colette}
<D>__{it's not that easy.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{don't tell me, down deep he's really not a bad person and you don't want to see him get hurt.}

<D>__{is that simple enough for you?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{why don't you call the cops?}
<C>__{colette}
<D>__{why? they don't hold him for more than a day or two.}
<C>__{danny}
