<A>__{the conference room is similar to that of the white house. but this table is low and all the men sit on the floor. and there are no civilians here; japan is now a nation ruled by its warriors. the last man to enter the room and take his place is admiral yamamoto. harvard educated, yamamoto is an object of veneration and suspicion among the men of the war council. yamamoto bows, sits, and looks across the table at his friend genda, who can't hide his fear. yamamoto glances to the far end of the table where nishikura, chief of the war council, sits glowering. (their discussion is in japanese, with subtitles.)}
<C>__{nishikura}
<D>__{so you join us, admiral. some of us thought your education at an american university would make you too weak to fight the americans.}
<C>__{yamamoto}
<D>__{if knowledge of opponents and careful calculation of danger is taken as weakness then i have misunderstood what it means to be japanese.}
<C>__{nishikura}
<D>__{the time has come to strike! or to sit and let the americans cut off our oil and our future. i know what you whisper to the others, yamamoto that the americans are strong. yet look at their leader.}
<A>__{he motions to oyama, an intelligence analyst, who opens a file and lays out pictures of roosevelt.}
<C>__{oyama}
<D>__{franklin roosevelt. born into great wealth. fifteen years ago, he was stricken with polio. now he cannot walk, or even stand without help. photographers will not take pictures of him in his chair; americans do not wish to know how weak their president is.}
<A>__{yamamoto makes a low grunt.}
<C>__{nishikura}
<D>__{you have something to say, yamamoto?}
<C>__{yamamoto}
<D>__{the council knows i have opposed fighting the americans. no matter how great our resolve, they have resources beyond ours. if we must go to war, there is only one way deal them a blow from which it will take them years to recover. in that time we can conquer all of the pacific, and they will have no choice but to ask for peace.}
<C>__{nishikura}
<D>__{you see us as capable of such a blow?}
<C>__{yamamoto}
<D>__{the americans themselves have made it possible. we will annihilate them in a single attack at pearl harbor.}
<A>__{the members of the war council are so pleased with yamamoto that they bow to him. only genda keeps his eyes raised long enough to see the sadness in yamamoto's face.}
