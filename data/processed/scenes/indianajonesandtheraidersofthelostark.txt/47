<L>__{1.) the obvious leader, a short, vile, sadistic german in}
<A>__{spectacles by the name of belzig.}
<L>__{2.) a trenchcoated second nazi. 3.) a ratty looking nepalese and 4.) a mean mongolian. the second nazi and the mongolian both}
<A>__{carry submachine guns.}
<C>__{belzig}
<D>__{good evening, fraulein.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{the bar's closed.}
<C>__{belzig}
<D>__{we are not thirsty.}
<A>__{the mongolian and the nepalese poke around, checking to make sure there's no one else there. down at the end of the bar, the medallion lies partially hidden by surrounding glasses and bottles. the second nazi stops very near it, but turns his back to it to face belzig and marion.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{belzig}
<D>__{the same thing your friend dr. jones wanted. surely he told you there would be other interested parties.}
<A>__{marion shakes her head.}
<C>__{belzig}
<D>__{ah, the man is nefarious. i hope for your sake he has not yet acquired it.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{why, are you willing to offer more?}
<C>__{belzig}
<D>__{almost certainly. do you still have it?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{no. but i know where it is.}
<A>__{belzig's smile fades at this news. he's not a patient sort. marion is chilled by the look. she turns and moves to the shelf of bottles behind her, reaching high for one, very near the large stuffed raven. he hand lingers there a moment and we see from an angle behind the stuffed raven, that the left wing spread hides a baretta automatic pistol. marion's hand is very near it, but withdraws with only a whiskey bottle as the mongolian walks toward her behind the bar. marion opens the bottle before belzig, who watches her intently.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{how 'bout a drink for you and your men?}
<A>__{the second nazi lights up at this suggestion. belzig gives him a withering look.}
<C>__{belzig}
<D>__{we will stick to the business at hand, fraulein.}
<C>__{marion}
<P>__{(tough)}
<D>__{fine. why don't you come back tomorrow when jones is here and we'll have an auction?}
<A>__{belzig gives her a cold look then turns and walks over toward the fireplace. as soon as his back is turned, the second nazi grabs the nearest whiskey bottle and takes a quick pull. in so doing, he leaves the medallion completely exposed. marion is aware of this as she looks at him. but he quickly puts the bottle down again, obscuring the medallion, when belzig speaks from the fireplace.}
<C>__{belzig}
<D>__{i'm afraid an auction is not possible.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{your fire is dying here, fraulein.}
<P>__{(a beat, then threatening)}
<D>__{why don't you tell us where the piece is right now?}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{listen, herr mac, i don't know who you're used to dealing with, but no one tells me what to do in my place.}
<A>__{belzig, still looking in the fire, sneers and shakes his head.}
<C>__{belzig}
<D>__{americans! you're all alike. fraulein ravenwood. i will show you want i'm used to.}
<A>__{he motions with his hand. the mongolian moves up behind marion and lifts her roughly over the top of the bar, knocking over bottles and spilling liquor. he deposits her on the other side, where the nepalese and the second nazi flank her and hold her cruelly, arms behind her back. marion raises a ruckus. belzig turns from the fireplace. in his hand is the poker, its end glowing orange. he advances on marion. marion stops yelling, her eyes widen in terror.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{wait! i can be reasonable }
<C>__{belzig}
<D>__{that time is passed.}
<A>__{the glowing poker point moves inexorably across the room toward marion's face.}
<C>__{marion}
<D>__{you don't need that. i will tell you everything!}
<C>__{belzig}
<D>__{yes, i know you will.}
<A>__{belzig has no intention of stopping now. the glowing tip is approaching marion's face. the nepalese watches with savage glee. the tip of the poker is five inches from marion's nose when there is a loud crack! and the fall of indy's bullwhip wraps around the middle of the poker and tears it out of belzig's hands. the poker sails high across the room, free of the whip, and lands in the heavy curtains that cover one window. the curtains immediately burst into flame. the four bad men look in surprise toward the front entrance. indy is poised there, the whip in his right hand, a .45 automatic raised toward them in his left.}
<C>__{indy}
<D>__{hello.}
<A>__{now everything begins to happen very fast the mongolian had just come around the bar at the end opposite the medallion. he dives back to crouch behind the end of the bar, raising his submachine gun. belzig and the second german dive behind tables near the bar. the nepalese is slower to leave marion, he draws a luger. indy's .45 barks and the nepalese dies spinning against the bar. indy fires in the direction of the mongolian. marion swings up over the top of her bar. belzig fires at her, but his bullets smash bottles behind the bar and thud into the raven. marion flattens out on the floor behind the bar as bullets hit above her. she reaches up, snatches the axe handle from where mahdlo left it, and begins crawling down the length of the bar toward the mongolian, who sticks his submachine gun out and fires blindly in indy's direction. indy is in a crouch behind a table, trying to get a shot at someone. he doesn't notice in the din and confusion when the door bursts open. an incredible, fearsome giant sherpa, almost seven feet tall, soars in and tackles indy from behind. the whip flies from indy's hand as he and the giant sherpa roll across the floor, upsetting furniture. the mongolian, seeing this, stands up confidently. marion rises behind him and bashes him over the head with the axe handle. he goes down and out. fire has completely engulfed the curtains and is working across the ceiling on decorative yak skin bunting. a burning fragment drops to the top of the bar, which immediately lights up, fueled by the spilled alcohol. full whiskey bottles explode like molotov cocktails. rolling on the floor, indy and the giant sherpa are fighting for control of indy's .45. belzig sees this and shouts to the second nazi, who is rising from cover with submachine gun in hand.}
<C>__{belzig}
<D>__{shoot them both!}
<C>__{second nazi}
<D>__{he's our man!}
<C>__{belzig}
<D>__{do as i say!}
<A>__{both the giant sherpa and indy hear this. the giant sherpa exchanges an alarmed look with indy and together they swing the .45 around toward the surprised second nazi. two blasts blow him away. that done, indy brings a brass spittoon down on the giant sherpa's wrist and the .45 slides away. indy jumps up and kicks the giant sherpa, who barely seems to feel it. he grabs indy and flips him effortlessly onto a table. belzig now has a clear shot at indy. he raises his luger. marion, at the end of the bar, finally gets the hand of the mongolian's submachine gun. it roars to life in the general direction of the ceiling. belzig runs for cover as marion gets control of the gun and levels it. belzig dives around the end of the bar opposite marion. when he has set himself, he peeks up over the edge of the scorched bar. the alcohol fire has moved down the bar and now, much to belzig's surprise, he finds himself staring at the fire blackened sun shaped medallion! his eyes widen. he cannot believe his good fortune. without hesitation he picks up the metal medallion, palming it. immediately there is a sickening searing sound and belzig's expression changes from joy to agony. he screams in pain and tries to shake the red hot medallion from his skin. marion opens up and the bar starts to splinter in front of belzig. the medallion comes free of belzig's hand and rolls across the floor. belzig has had enough. in excruciating pain, he turns, sees a window, runs and dives through the glass. an exhausted indy uses his whole body to upend the giant sherpa, who lands hard on his back. they are surrounded by flames.}
