<A>__{acres of yellowing corn surround a dilapidated farmhouse converted into a pool hall. the windows glow from warm lights inside. parked along the gravel driveway are pickup trucks, cars, and luke's semi.}
<B>__{inside pool hall}
<A>__{smoke, rowdy music and the clack of cue balls. keenan and luke snake their way through the pool tables.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{holy shit. it's that lady from the store! grey and black at the bar.}
<A>__{keenan looks over at sydney, finishing off a bourbon.}
<B>__{rental counter}
<A>__{janine and michelle check out a rack of billiard balls from the worldly british owner, polly. she runs the place like a wild west saloon, with such ease and confidence, it suggests there may be a shotgun under the bar.}
<C>__{polly}
<D>__{that boy, keenan, still giving you trouble?}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{actually, i tried exactly what you said.}
<C>__{polly}
<D>__{and...?}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{unbelievable! thanks.}
<C>__{polly}
<D>__{works every time.}
<P>__{(to michelle)}
<D>__{nice to meet you, darling. i hope you'll find not too many rules here, and the drinks not too dear.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{yeah, thanks. it's amazing.}
<A>__{polly moves off.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{isn't she great? guys drive across the state just to buy a beer from her. total loner, though. no one's ever seen her with anyone.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{what did she tell you to try?}
<A>__{janine whispers in her ear. michelle's jaw drops open, scandalized. they laugh.}
<B>__{at the bar}
<A>__{luke hands his keys to jeremy, the handsome bartender, in exchange for a full pitcher of beer.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{thanks, man.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{oh, god. she's eyeing you. i think she's comin' over.}
<A>__{sydney saunters up.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{can i buy you a drink?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{uh, no thanks. we're already here with dates and stuff.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{you are? who? where is she?}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{they're around somehwere.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{luke, if you like this girl, we better talk.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{sydney glances around, talks quietly.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{anything happen since we last spoke? hot flashes? pressure in your chest?}
<A>__{luke pales.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{dr. sydney catchadourian. keenan, right?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you know him?!}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{we exchanged e mail. i came right away.}
<A>__{luke gives keenan the evil eye.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{from philadelphia? why?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{your friend here has an extra chromosome.}
<A>__{the little remaining color in luke's face now drains away. he shakes his head 'no.'}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{someone put mushrooms in my mushroom sauce.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i tested your hair.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you're like some whack job. get the hell away from me.}
<A>__{luke moves off, sloshing beer. sydney sighs.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{denial, denial, denial. always the first step. keep him away from that girl.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{what're you talkin' about?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{chromosomes. most people have forty six: two x if you're a girl, an x and y if you're a guy. he's got forty seven: an x, a y, and a z.}
<B>__{pool table}
<A>__{janine and michelle select pool cues.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{we've only been together six months. and he's such a guy's guy, everyone's buddy, but, alcoholic parents, six months in "juvey."}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{wild past, huh?}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{i think the only reason he's even alive right now, is okay, partly 'cause he's so damn smart, but mostly 'cause there's this one person, he knows, absolutely, no matter what, won't bale on him.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{you.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{no. he doesn't trust me at all. luke. he's a rock.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{so, yes, you can trust him. i'm hoping keenan's the same way. 'cause believe me, i'm not used to rocks, i'm used to pebbles.}
<A>__{michelle laughs.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{grains of sand.}
<A>__{luke rejoins them with the pitcher of beer, glancing back toward the bar. keenan comes too, with a look of concern.}
<C>__{janine}
<D>__{everything okay?}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{sure. i need a drink.}
<A>__{keenan steals glances at luke, trying to sort it all out.}
<C>__{keenan }
<P>__{(aside to luke)}
<D>__{that lady's nuts.}
<A>__{luke nods.}
<B>__{at the bar}
<A>__{sydney sits at a bar stool, keeping an eye on luke and michelle. jeremy lays out a cocktail napkin, speaks with a slight texas drawl.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{another round?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{please. you see that couple over there? i don't get it. what's he see in her?}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{the brunette? you kiddin'? i'd give my left one to be with her.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{yeah? so could he.}
<A>__{pool table later now alone with michelle, luke lines up his cue stick, then catches michelle's admiring eyes. she smiles, glances over at keenan and janine, making out by the jukebox.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{your friends sorta' like each other, huh?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{super glue. thirty seconds together, you can't pull 'em apart.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{how'd they meet?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{keenan sold her a bike. i don't think they've been apart more than six hours since.}
<A>__{luke peers over the corner pocket, and watches michelle shoot and sink the ball.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{i never thought in a million years you'd go out with me, let alone twice.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{you're not s'posed to say that. that's a total pathetic, loser thing to say. but i'm gonna' take it as a huge compliment.}
<C>__{michelle }
<D>__{okay, two word answers only. why'd you ask me out in the first place?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{beautiful. unpretentious. why'd you say 'yes?'}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{gentle.}
<A>__{luke sneers, not his favorite compliment.}
<C>__{michelle }
<D>__{...hot. deep. three words.}
<A>__{he smiles.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{okay, two words. what're you most passionate about?}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{friendship. trust. you?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{hockey. ...hockey.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{so much for "deep."}
<A>__{they laugh.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you.}
<A>__{the electricity between them charges the air. luke maneuvers himself closer.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{okay, i'm gonna' take a wild shot. ricochet off the back, over here, then straight into that side pocket. what are my chances?}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{point zero zero zero one.}
<A>__{luke takes his shot,... and kisses her. the ball ricochets off the back, across the table, and sinks in the pocket at the side.}
<B>__{at the bar}
<A>__{jeremy looks on, aroused. sydney squints, dismayed, barely able to watch.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{damn. will you look at that tonsil hockey?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i'd prefer not. this could get bad.}
<C>__{jeremy}
<D>__{you've been staring at him all night. you got a thing for him, or what?}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{actually, i'm hoping he's got one for me.}
<B>__{pool table}
<A>__{keenan and janine rejoin luke and michelle, all four elated.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{looks like you two are gettin' on okay. should we rack up another game?}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{definitely! i'd like to get good at this pool thing.}
<A>__{luke racks up the balls as michelle lines up the cue.}
<C>__{michelle }
<D>__{okay, i'm gonna' break this wide open!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{go for it!}
<A>__{before keenan has lifted the wooden triangle rack, michelle hammers the cue ball. it cracks off the rack, rockets off the table,... and cannonballs luke in the crotch. keenan, michelle, and janine all gasp. they cringe, poised, waiting for luke to react.}
<C>__{michelle}
<D>__{god. sorry.}
<A>__{luke picks the cue ball up off the floor and sets it on the table. he sees them watching him.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{man, i'd be on the floor cryin' like a baby.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{no, i'm all right.}
<A>__{surprised, they return to the game. michelle lines up the cue ball again, as luke considers,... with a slow dawning realization that something, somehow, just isn't right. he casually touches his hand to his pants. he pales slightly.}
<C>__{luke }
<D>__{would you excuse me a sec'?}
<A>__{he looks to keenan for help.}
<B>__{at the bar}
<A>__{sydney watches as keenan and luke cross the hall toward the back. she flags jeremy.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{jeremy! bourbon. fast!}
<P>__{(a glance at luke)}
<D>__{better give me the whole bottle.}
<A>__{outside men's room luke tries the men's room door, locked.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{in here.}
<A>__{keenan opens another door that leads them into a store room. luke follows, with a look of concern.}
<B>__{inside store room}
<C>__{keenan }
<D>__{i mean, it was like a precision guided missile.}
<A>__{luke unzips and gently digs in his trousers. he looks down, shudders,...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{uh ah }
<A>__{luke's face contorts, terrified.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{i will get some ice.}
<A>__{luke shakes his head "no," points toward his crotch, gasps, barely able to make a sound...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{it's ! look!}
<A>__{keenan gives him a look, repelled, perplexed...}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{then takes a look,... his eyes get huge.}
<C>__{keenan }
<D>__{dude!!!}
<A>__{sydney bursts in with the bottle of bourbon.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i was afraid a' this!}
<P>__{(to keenan)}
<D>__{make sure no one gets in!}
<C>__{sydney }
<P>__{(to luke)}
<D>__{now, will you listen to me?!}
<A>__{luke, slack jawed, keeps checking himself. each time the horror of it grows more intense.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{oh, god!}
<A>__{sydney uncaps the bourbon and drops capsules in from a prescription bottle.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{it's gonna' come back. drink this!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{what're you givin' me?!}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{valium. flexeril. and a shitload of darvon. you gotta' calm down.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{"caaalm down?!!!!!!"}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{here we go...}
<A>__{he and sydney have to yell to hear over luke's escalating}
<B>__{mantra...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{"caaalm down?!!!"}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{what's wrong with him?!}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{he's a zerophiliac.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{a what?! i'm gettin' a doctor! this isn't right!}
<A>__{sydney grabs keenan, shoves him against the wall.}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{i am a doctor! you breathe one word, anyone else sees him like this, and he's fucked! pictures all over the net, tabloids, television!}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{tele vision?!!}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{no! we're gonna' get it back!}
<P>__{(to keenan)}
<D>__{you let me help him, he gets a normal body, lives a normal life. now, you his friend or not?!}
<A>__{keenan nods that 'yes, he is.' sydney releases him.}
<C>__{sydney }
<D>__{hang onto him. so he doesn't get hurt when he passes out.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{now just wait a sec'? is it contagious?!}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{there are no recorded incidents of transmission from physical contact.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{"recorded incidents?!!"}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{oh, please god! what did i do wrong?!}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{nothing. you're a z.}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{"recorded incidents?!" oh my god, i used his deodorant!}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{oh, will you calm down?}
<C>__{keenan}
<D>__{"c a l m d o w n ?!!!"}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{"c a l m d o w n ?!!!"}
<A>__{luke's eyes glaze over... he weaves, losing his balance...}
<C>__{sydney}
<D>__{finally.}
<A>__{sydney helps luke flop down on the floor. he passes out.}
<C>__{sydney }
<D>__{he'll be alright. he didn't go all the way. when you fall asleep or pass out, a z almost always reverts back. it's called a nocturnal remission.}
<A>__{keenan approaches luke, then steps back.}
<C>__{sydney }
<D>__{oh, relax, it's not contagious.}
<A>__{keenan grabs the bourbon darvon concoction from sydney, wipes the rim of the bottle just in case, then takes a big swig.}
