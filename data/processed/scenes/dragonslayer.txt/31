<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{king's castle night carrying torches to light their way, families some with maiden daughters gather from all over the country in the courtyard of the king's castle. simon is there with valerian, and so is galen, disguised in rough farm clothes and a wide brimmed hat. like many others, he carries a stick topped with a bleached skull to all appearances, just another participant in this weird pagan ritual. a barrel decorated with flames and dragon's wings sits on a raised dais in front of the main entrance. horsrik, the king's herald, supervises preparations for the lottery. armed guards appear carrying a sealed chest. horsrik breaks the seal and the guards pour the contents hundreds of wooden tiles, each bearing the name of a potential sacrifice into the barrel. trumpets blare and drums roll and the royal party strolls onstage: the king, his daughter, courtiers and tyrian. valerian nudges galen.}
<C>__{valerian}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{look at her. the princess.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{i know. we've met.}
<A>__{valerian gives galen a sharp look. horsrik unrolls a parchment.}
<C>__{horsrik}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{people of urland: whereas the peace of the kingdom has been disrupted by the mischief of an interloper; and whereas this interloper being fled; now therefore, his majesty the king hereby proclaims the sum of thirty ducats to be paid to anyone producing the miscreant galen bradwardyn, fraud enchanter, to our satisfaction.}
<A>__{galen pulls his hat low over his eyes. as the moment for the drawing approaches, valerian becomes more and more uneasy. she pushes forward through the crowd until she's just below the barrel. she eyes the people around her. some of them seem equally worried, others the better dressed and better fed are smug and complacent. the king and his retinue are serene. a chant goes up from the crowd:}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{stir the tiles! stir the tiles!}
<A>__{horsrik picks up a wooden staff surmounted by a carved dragon's head and stirs up the names. this done, a new chant goes up:}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{bare the arm! bare the arm!}
<A>__{at a signal, a guard comes forward and cuts the sleeve from horsrik's right arm. he holds it high. the crowd surges forward. the atmosphere is full of dread and excitement. valerian looking pale and determined, is jostled and pushed to the edge of the platform.}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{draw the name! draw the name!}
<A>__{the moment has come. down goes horsrik's arm and up it comes, holding one little wooden square, one young woman's fate. an expectant hush falls over the mob. the virgins of urland tremble and wait.}
<C>__{horsrik}
<D>__{now, my countrymen, hear me: behold, for i am chosen. i shall die that many may live. i shall lay down my life for family and fellows. i shall go to my grave for the love of our king and his wise policy. and my name is }
<A>__{he looks down at the tile to read the name, but no sound comes to his lips. he looks back at the crowd, a cold sweat breaking over his face. he swallows, but still can't bring himself to speak. at his feet, valerian is holding her breath. a new chant goes up.}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{the name! the name!}
<A>__{by now horsrik is trembling. he stares down at the tile, his mouth set in a grim line. the king is getting annoyed. he gestures and the crowd falls silent.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{read the name.}
<C>__{horsrik}
<P>__{(mastering himself)}
<D>__{the name is: princess elspeth ulfilas, filia regis.}
<A>__{there is a moment of profound shock. then a low murmur of wonder moves through the crowd. galen looks at valerian; she sags with relief. the king turns to his daughter. she shows nothing. he rises from his chair, comes forward and snatches the tile from horsrik.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{that's not the name. it's been misread.}
<A>__{valerian will not stand for such hypocrisy.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{there's no mistake! the name's been chosen let it stand!}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{no, the good horsrik has misspoke himself.}
<P>__{(he looks at the tile)}
<D>__{in fairness to this individual, whose name i can't make out, we'll destroy this tile.}
<A>__{he quickly tosses the wood chip into a brazier at his elbow. led by valerian, the crowd cries out in protest.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{no! what better name than your own kin? at last we see justice done!}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{silence! we will have a new choosing. i will draw the name myself.}
<A>__{he reaches into the barrel and extracts another tile. he looks at it and his eyes widen. betrayed, he swivels to face his daughter. the din of the crowd reaches a crescendo.}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{let it stand! let it stand!}
<A>__{elspeth takes the tile from her father's nerveless fingers, looks at it with satisfaction and holds it aloft.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{the name is as you heard it and as horsrik read it: elspeth.}
<A>__{the king moils through the tiles, finding his daughter's name again and again.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{the lottery is invalid. another and another. what treachery is this?}
<A>__{valerian, chanting with the rest, falls silent. she looks at elspeth with sudden interest and respect, then awe.}
<C>__{elspeth}
<D>__{hear me, good people! it is true, that my name appears on many of the lots. this does not falsify the drawing, it certifies it! i have learned that my name has been kept from jeopardy in all the drawings in the past. so i have put my name among the rest many times once for each risk that, over the years, you took and i did not.}
<A>__{the crowd is dumbfounded. gradually voices erupt in a cacophony of shouts, whistles and excited conversation. galen sees his chance: there's an unguarded door near the stable. he drifts toward it and slips inside.}
<B>__{throne room}
<A>__{galen pokes his head in: the room is empty. he scurries over to a chest, flings it open and starts rummaging. finding nothing he moves on to a cabinet. he breaks the lock and pries it open. again, nothing.}
<B>__{castle corridor}
<A>__{galen can hear the voices in the courtyard as he rushes down a hall. suddenly he stops short. there in front of him is a guard leaning out a window to watch the proceedings. galen hovers on the verge of panic as the guard abruptly moves. but the man is only headed for another window and a better view. galen manages to fall into step an arm's length behind him and slip by without a sound.}
<B>__{library}
<A>__{galen enters the library, his enormous shadow dancing crazily on the torchlit walls. hurrying through, his attention is drawn to some open books on a table. closer inspection reveals magical writings and symbols. galen paws over everything, suddenly aware that he must be close to the amulet. but where is it?}
<B>__{courtyard}
<A>__{as the crowd disperses valerian watches elspeth walk back in the castle, lofty and composed. she looks for galen and discovers he has gone.}
<B>__{library}
<A>__{by now, the room is in total disarray. galen has opened all the chests and trunks and knocked half the books from the shelves. no amulet. he's feverishly working on a locked drawer when a voice interrupts him.}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{don't go to all that trouble.}
<A>__{galen whirls around to find the king standing in the doorway. the monarch looks shattered. galen edges toward the split in the wall and finds that it has been shored up with timbers. at that moment tyrian comes through the door, sizes up the situation and draws his sword.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{i'm unarmed. if you want a fight, at least give me a weapon.}
<C>__{tyrian}
<P>__{(pushing by the king)}
<D>__{i think not!}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{stop! don't harm him.}
<P>__{(to galen)}
<D>__{and you don't run away... please...}
<A>__{the king's voice is cracking. galen and tyrian are equally taken aback. the king searches through the books remaining on the library shelves.}
<C>__{king}
<P>__{(shaky)}
<D>__{i've always had the greatest admiration for the black arts. you chaps with your mysterious spells... i didn't think it would be necessary, you see. vermithrax is an old dragon. and that, i thought, was the beauty of my plan buying time. we'd wait her out. i'd live to see the end of her.}
<P>__{(firm)}
<D>__{that's still going to happen.}
<A>__{the king finds the book and takes the amulet out. with trembling hands, he passes it to galen.}
<C>__{tyrian}
<D>__{sire!}
<C>__{king}
<D>__{he shall have it.}
<P>__{(pleading)}
<D>__{it's my daughter. save her, i beg you.}
