<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(to willie)}
<D>__{i asked you... how did you find out?}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{this would never stand at law, not for a minute. it happened over twenty five years ago, and you could never get any testimony. everybody is dead.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{everybody except you, judge. you're alive. and people think you're a certain kind of man. and you just couldn't bear for people to think otherwise.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{ever since then i... i've done my duty. i... i'm responsible for many good things.}
<P>__{(looks at the papers again)}
