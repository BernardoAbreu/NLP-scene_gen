<L>__{exterior alley morning}
<A>__{xander is heading to the far end of a dead end alley. the only way out is fenced in. but there's a ramp leading up to a loading dock. xander will have to use that ramp to jump the fence. anders climbs to the second floor of the building. there is a small crane arm loaded with metal. if he pushes it at the right time, it will swing out and knock xander from his bike. he giggles maniacally, blood dripping. xander drops down into the alley and heads towards the jump. anders times it perfectly and swings the crane arm out. in slow motion: the bike leaves the ramp and soars up over the fence. the crane arm swings out, on a collision course with xander. xander sees it and throws himself off the bike, grabbing onto the back in a superman seat grab. he passes right underneath the swinging crane arm. anders's face falls when he sees xander go by, hanging on with one hand. in his other hand xander's got his pistol. blap! xander pulls himself back onto the bike and lands. he stops, sees anders' bloody helmet come bouncing into the alley. he tucks his pistol away and roars off.}
