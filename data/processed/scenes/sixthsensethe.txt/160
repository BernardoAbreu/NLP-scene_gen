<L>__{interior living room afternoon}
<A>__{the room is thick with mourners. most are gathered around the girl's mother, a young woman in her late twenties. as she moves through the room to the kitchen, she receives the many cards, hugs, and flowers that are offered as condolence. mrs. collins leaves the living room. malcolm watches breathlessly from the doorway as cole moves through the many adults across the room. the girl's father, mr. collins, a thin man in his late twenties, is seated on the reading chair next to a t.v. his face is granite. no one in the room dares to talk to him. he stares statue like at an abstract point in the room.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{mister?}
<A>__{the man doesn't react. some of the guests look oddly at the little boy standing before the man.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{excuse me, mister.}
<A>__{beat. the man slowly turns and looks down at the boy standing next to him. cole is very shaky. malcolm watches everything anxiously. cole stares at mr. collins.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{are you kyra's daddy?}
<A>__{the man's face begins to crumble. beat. he nods, "yes" softly. cole holds out the jewelry box. it trembles with his hands. the father just stares at it. beat.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{it's for you...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{she wanted to tell you something.}
<A>__{the father becomes very still. his eyes fill with a storm of confusion and pain. after the longest time, the father reaches and gently takes the box out of cole's small hands. cole begins to back away... the father gazes at cole as he melts into the crowd. cole reaches malcolm and the two then slip out of the house. the father looks down in a daze. he goes to open the jewelry box. his movements are slow and strained. he lifts the latch and open the box. mr. collins stares at an unlabeled video cassette.}
