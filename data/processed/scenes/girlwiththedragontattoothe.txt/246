<L>__{exterior hedeby island night}
<A>__{the honda's single headlight shudders as salander comes across the bridge onto the island. blomkvist comes to on the floor, handcuffed to a chain that runs through a metal eyelet. he sees martin behind a video camera on a tripod, focusing it a shelf full of betamax tapes and a tv monitor on which his own image then appears. note: the steel door if we were close enough to it to notice which we aren't is not locked. it's not even completely shut. satisfied with the framing of the shot of his guest, martin takes a seat on a comfortable armchair upholstered in clear plastic. it squeaks. he regards blomkvist calmly. sips his drink. then almost sighs.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{why didn't you just go home.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i assume you mean the opportunity for that has passed.}
<A>__{martin smiles, appreciating, perhaps, blomkvist's "easy" manner in this dire circumstance.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{how'd you do it? what did you find?}
<A>__{blomkvist doesn't say. martin looks like he has all the time in the world to wait, and does. then }
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{we can talk or we can just get on with it. it's really up to you.}
<A>__{nothing from blomkvist. martin shrugs `okay,' gets up, goes to his workbench and takes a plastic shower curtain from it. as he's laying it on the floor around his victim, blomkvist changes his mind }
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i found a picture no one had seen before.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{of.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{you. in your uppsala prep school blazer.}
<A>__{martin doesn't see the significance, but is pleased blomkvist has decided to "participate." he rewards him by suspending his shower curtain work to return to the chair. it squeaks again.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{what does that say?}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{that you lied about where you were that day. or rather when.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{did i? if i did, so what. people lie all the time.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{it also said that lena andersson was a schoolmate.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{lena ...}
<P>__{(he has to think back to remember her)}
<D>__{lena was a long time ago.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{where's this picture now? with all the other junk on your desk?}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{a print is. digital copies are on a secure photo site.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{that's a lie ... how much does the girl know?}
<A>__{blomkvist isn't sure how to play that question ...}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{let's hope it's as much as you. that'll make it more fun. where is she?}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{stockholm. she went there this morning.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{and that's a lie. she's sitting in our offices looking at more old crap. our archives manager called me very perturbed with this girl. lisbeth. i like that name. lisbeth. when lisbeth leaves i will get a call from security, so i can be at your cottage to greet her when she arrives }
<A>__{he holds up the keys he took from blomkvist's pocket when he was out cold.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i can't thank you enough for bringing her to me.}
