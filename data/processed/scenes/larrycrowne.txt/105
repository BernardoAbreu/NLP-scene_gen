<L>__{interior speech 217 day}
<A>__{mercedes is in the back, wearing the darkest glasses allowed a teacher in a classroom, hiding the fact that mercy is looking at larry. larry is listening to lala with delight.}
<C>__{pinedo}
<D>__{seeing them the northern lights, the aurora borealis should have been beyond me, but i was a little girl in coach class still awake, a window seat, a moonless night somewhere over greenland with a shimmering curtain of emerald, gossamer light dancing just for me.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{that is something i will remember forever.}
<A>__{the speech is over. the class erupts in applause for lala, who has hit a home run. foremost of the fans, larry, who rises in applause for the once quiet classmate. then the applause is over.}
<D>__{the teacher says nothing. dibiasi that was a knockout speech, lala. made the news. caused riots downtown. school's out til 2019.}
<A>__{the students look at each other, shrug their shoulders, and head ou .}
<C>__{mercedes tainot}
<D>__{mr. crowne? a moment please?}
<C>__{calimeris}
<D>__{why doesn't she just throw herself at him?}
<C>__{pinedo}

<C>__{dibiasi}
<D>__{quiet down. i'm watching the tv show...}
<C>__{mack}
<D>__{why doesn't this ever happen to me?}
<C>__{mercedes tainot}

<C>__{larry crowne}
<D>__{how are the triplets? groggy, puffy, and grumpy.}
<A>__{he means the hangover.}
<C>__{mercedes tainot}
<D>__{last night was a confluence of too many things happening in too short a time span.}
<C>__{larry crowne}
<D>__{last i ht? let's see, what was i doing? studying some. working some. can't recall. i've forgotten everything that happened last night as best a gentleman can.}
<C>__{mercedes tainot}
<D>__{i had no right to judge you or your relationships. date who you want.}
<A>__{larry has no idea what that means.}
<C>__{mercedes tainot }
<D>__{but what happened last night between adults was inappropriate. if gossip were to circulate, the problem could be more than just embarrassing. my status as a professor could be tarnished.}

<C>__{mercedes tainot}
<A>__{happened before.}

<C>__{mercedes tainot}
<D>__{thank you, mr. crowne.}
<C>__{larry crowne}
<D>__{i'd better scurry along to dr. matsutani's class. i hope i don't have this same conversation with him.}
<A>__{larry leaves a good mood ruined... mercy watches him go. what is going on behind those dark glasses?}
