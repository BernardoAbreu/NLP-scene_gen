<L>__{exterior lakeside rest area dusk}
<A>__{lake superior shimmers in the dying light. the rig's in the empty rest area lot. on a nearby bank, four men in santa claus suits and one woman without sit scattered at picnic tables, guns at their sides. staring out at the lake.}
<B>__{rudy and ashley}
<A>__{sit apart from the rest. rudy in a red suit, black boots, cap in hand. ashley's head is in his lap, watching the sky.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{where should we go, nick? when we're gone from here... where should we go...}
<A>__{the nova drives into the lot. pug gets out, carrying several fast food bags. hurrying to stay warm:}
<C>__{pug }
<D>__{okay, who had the cheeseburger with bacon; what about a roast beef, i've got two roast beefs here }
<C>__{jumpy }
<D>__{cheeseburger 'n bacon's mine }
<C>__{merlin }
<D>__{i got a bacon too; there another bacon in there?}
<C>__{pug }
<D>__{i got a bacon for him and a bacon for me; there's four cheeseburgers and two roast beefs }
<C>__{merlin }
<D>__{somebody better give me something with some goddamn bacon }
<A>__{as they continue chow dispersal, rudy stares over the lake. distant. not even aware ashley's there.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{this time right now... dad's stacking wood out back, getting ready for tomorrow. little blaze in the fireplace. mom's setting out the good silver, hanging her cinammon sticks, up in the doorways. getting out her scratchy old records... singing along...}
<A>__{rudy smiles to himself. he's got a faraway look.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{i don't know where you're going. but i'm going home.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{we go together, nick. wherever... we go together. remember?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{well. i'm going home.}
<B>__{gabriel}
<A>__{sits by the water, staring over the lake too. with a white cotton santa beard resting on his chin. he unwraps his roast beef sandwich, pulls his beard down to his neck, and takes a savage bite. munches away, stares to rudy and ashley. she meets his eyes. gabriel smiles. and looks again to the water.}
<B>__{on full scene}
<A>__{the snowy rest stop, the glistening lake. and the six figures scattered, watching day turn to night...}
