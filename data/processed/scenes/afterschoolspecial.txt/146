<D>__{the folks are reading.}
<L>__{exterior abandoned warehouse night}
<D>__{close on the aerostar bumper sticker, "my child is on the honor roll at william wall high school." crane shot up to the second floor landing.}
<L>__{interior abandoned warehouse night}
<D>__{deacon, matt, and fred are bound and gagged, and hanging by their pants from meat hooks. mike takes their gags off and they starts whimpering.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{please don't kill us, mr. porno man.}
<C>__{vic}
<D>__{relax. we're not going to kill you. the guys let out a collective sigh of relief. thank god. a beat. then mike pulls out the hedge clippers.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(matter of fact)}
<D>__{we're going to cut your balls off.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{what?!? the guys freak out, but mike's gun keeps them in place.}
<C>__{vic}
<P>__{(re: fred)}
<D>__{start with him.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{why me? it was all deacon's idea!}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{fred!}
<C>__{vic}
<D>__{okay. do the leader kid.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{quit squirming. it hurts a lot more if you struggle. vic starts undoing deacon's belt.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{wait! wait! wait!}
<C>__{vic}
<D>__{come on, kid. take it like a man. vic pulls down deacon's pants. mike brings the blades together in a menacing practice chop.}
<A>__{deacon is crying like a little girl. fred also sobs uncontrollably, creating a cacophony of boyhood terror. mike goes in for the cut...}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{we've got pre orders!}
<A>__{mike stops and looks back at vic.}
<C>__{vic}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{we pre sold copies of our video.}
<C>__{vic}

<C>__{vic}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{that's a lot of product, vic.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{we've got orders from all over the world.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{we'll give you the website if you let us go.}
<A>__{vic looks at mike for a second, then shrugs. mike closes the hedge clippers and they untie the kids and let them down. deacon pulls up his pants.}
<C>__{vic}
<D>__{okay, so what's your cut?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{except...}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{what except? there's no except!}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{except you promise to supply us with quality porn free of charge.}
<P>__{(off deacon's look)}
<C>__{fred }
<D>__{it could come in handy. i mean, until we get girlfriends.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{and...}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{no, matt!}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(emboldened)}
<D>__{and you have to maintain the artistic vision of after school special.}
<C>__{vic}
<D>__{and what's that?}
<A>__{matt puts his arm around around vic's shoulder.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{the key is to try and remember what it was like before you had sex. what did you used to fantasize about? a math teacher who bends over a little too far. the door to the girls' locker room open just a sliver. going over to visit your friend and catching his mother coming out of the shower.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{dude?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{not you. deacon's mom.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{oh yeah. i've been there.}
