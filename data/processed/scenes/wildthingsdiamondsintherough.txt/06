<L>__{exterior clifford mansion afternoon}
<A>__{sickeningly expensive powerboats and de rigged schooners line the inlet leading to the verdant lawns of the clifford mansion... banners and streamers wishing marie a happy birthday decorate the grounds. partygoers soak in the blazing florida sun, sip at non alcoholic punch, and stare out gratefully across the thin stretch of water that separates them from the riff raff on the mainland... marie sits away from it all, lost in thought, as jenny, in cutoffs and a bikini top, sidles up beside her.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{what's the matter, sweetie, pissed that one judge only gave you a 9.7?}
<A>__{marie forces a smile.}

<D>__{denial ain't just a river in egypt, babe. you got diamonds on the mind.}
<C>__{jay }
<D>__{have either of you seen my video camera?}
<A>__{marie looks round to her stepfather, shakes her head, bringing a bemused look to jay's face.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{i had it at the dive meet, i'm sure...}
<A>__{he shrugs, picks up a crystal glass, hits a fork sharply against it, drawing the attention of the assembled partygoers...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{ladies, gentlemen, friends, raise a glass to marie, on her eighteenth birthday.}
<A>__{everyone raises their fine crystal.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{she's become every inch of the woman her mother hoped she'd be. wherever she is now, julie's looking down and smiling.}
<A>__{tears well in marie's eyes...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{and that's why, on your eighteenth birthday, marie, i know your mother wanted you to have...}
<A>__{he notices, out of the corner of his eyes, two well dressed men standing at the entrance to his house. whoever they are, jay's instantly unnerved. he stumbles over his words...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{... she wanted you to have... a wonderful birthday party surrounded by all your friends.}
<A>__{he glances back toward the house, watching the two men enter...}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{please excuse me.}
<A>__{... and hurries after them. marie is left dumbfounded. so close, but so far...}
<C>__{marie}
<D>__{jay! what about my present?}
<A>__{she chases after him...}
