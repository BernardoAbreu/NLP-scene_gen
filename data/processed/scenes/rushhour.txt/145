<L>__{exterior vine and sunset day}
<A>__{carson rushes across the street to javal's body. the teetering copter and geo are right above it. grimacing, carson tries to lift javal's body up off the parking meter, but it's messy, slippery work... unable to move the body, carson quickly searches its pockets. all he finds is the now empty prescription bottle. above, the copter groans... it's about to come loose... carson pulls out his sig 9mm and fires several times at javal's right wrist, then tears the hand off the body. with a loud wrenching of metal, the copter and geo break away from the building. carson grabs the saddlebags and runs like hell across the street, diving for cover behind a car.}
<B>__{behind carson}
<A>__{the copter and geo crash to the sidewalk and explode.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{sooty, covered in javal's blood, carson crosses to the others. he throws walther the saddlebags and sabatini the severed hand.}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{fingerprint it.}
<P>__{(to walther)}
<D>__{he's not gonna tell us where to find the hostages... more }
<C>__{carson }
<P>__{(looks at watch)}
<D>__{meaning we got exactly 80 minutes to figure it out for ourselves.}
<C>__{walther}
<D>__{figure it out?! with what?!}
<C>__{carson}
<P>__{(ignores him; into radio)}
<D>__{miranda! we need a copter, pronto!}
<P>__{(to robbins)}
<D>__{get back to his van. there were no plates, but check the vin, look it over, then meet us at the consulate.}
<A>__{robbins is still trying to process what just happened.}
<C>__{carson}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{go!}
