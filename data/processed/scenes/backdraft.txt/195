<L>__{interior warehouse catwalk night}
<A>__{ and walk right into an axe handle that smacks brian's throat knocking him gasping flat on his back. it's adcox. stephen jumps adcox and tackles him on the edge of a metal platform that extends out from the raised flooring.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{you stupid son of a bitch! what the fuck are you doing!}
<C>__{axe}
<D>__{stevie... i...}
<A>__{adcox struggles against him, heaving and sobbing.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{let it go! goddamn it let it go!}
<A>__{and adcox releases the axe.}
<C>__{axe}
<D>__{i'm sorry... i'm so sorry...}
<A>__{brian's on his feet now, coming toward them, when a chemical drum below explodes, the shock wave buckling the platform and dropping it several feet before it holds. brian, cut off, is hit with a wall of debris. adcox and stephen are flung across the platform and through the shattered railing. stephen grabs a piece of broken, dangling strut and hangs on with one hand. in his other hand is adcox. hanging below him, his grip loosening.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{stephen!}
<A>__{brian's struggling to get out from under the debris. the railing stephen's hanging onto is slick, his hand slipping along it. but he won't let go of adcox. his eyes bore into his best friend's with absolute conviction.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{you go, we go.}
<A>__{the towering shots of flame from below have begun to ignite adcox's pant leg. he's starting to burn. but stephen won't let go. won't let go even as the flames crawl up adcox's back. and stephen's hand is slipping and slipping and then it isn't slipping anymore because it's come off.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{adcox and stephen fall. there's a narrow catwalk half way down. stephen hits with a sickening crunch. adcox falls past it, down into the flames. there's an exposed i beam running from the ruined platform out over the catwalk. brian climbs up onto it, balances across over the fire below and jumps down to the catwalk where his brother lies, battered but still alive.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{you're gonna be all right, man.}
