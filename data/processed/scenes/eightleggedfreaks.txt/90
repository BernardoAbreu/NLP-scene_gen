<L>__{interior abandoned truck stop (desert) day}
<A>__{a dingy collection of buildings surrounded by dunes and rock. the structures have boarded windows. graffiti on the walls. teenagers hang out. off road motorcycles parked nearby. bret hale's monster truck does donuts in the parking lot. ashley hangs out the passenger window shrieking with glee.}
<L>__{interior bret's truck (truck stop) day}
<A>__{bret smokes a phillies blunt as he donuts his truck. ashley laughs hysterically. bret steers them around to the back of the truck stop. he skids to a stop.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{woo hoo!}
<A>__{bret offers his stogie. ashley refuses. bret puffs away.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{haven't you had enough of that?}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{no such thing. norman's bud is da'kine.}
<A>__{he coughs and they both laugh.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{when i medal at the x games, honda will give me full sponsorship. then i will take you with me on the supercross tour.}
<A>__{ashley is silent.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{are you still thinking about going away?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i don't know. i want to do something with my life, bret. help people. maybe med school is still an option.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{not if you keep hanging out with me.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{thanks, mom.}
<A>__{they kiss. things head toward a serious level of "get down." bret slides his hand up ashley's shirt. ashley gets into it. but then bret slides his hand toward the buttons of her 501s. ashley removes his hand.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{slow down...}
<A>__{bret persists. ashley climbs off of him.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{i thought you loved me.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i do!}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{then what's the problem? you want to leave town. you don't want to make out.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i don't feel...}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i don't want to lose my virginity in the front seat of a monster truck.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{why didn't you say so? we can go outside. i've got a blanket in the back.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{no... i guess... i'm just not ready.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{tammy and larry do it every night!}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{then call them! have a menage a trois!}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{come on, ashley. mommy's not around. you don't have to play the good girl. let daddy give you what you really want.}
<A>__{bret goes after her once more. ashley's not into it.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{please, bret... please don't...}
<A>__{but bret won't listen. ashley isn't strong enough to fight him. she reaches into her purse and pulls out her stun gun. she rams it up in bret's crotch and pulls the trigger. bret howls like a baboon in a wood chipper. he spasmodically jerks off of ashley and tumbles out the driver's side door.}
