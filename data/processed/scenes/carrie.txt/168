<A>__{who's also in the office for this interrogation ill at ease, trying to appear cool.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{you mean what good would it do? maybe it'll... bring her out of... make her a...}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{a part of things? oh, come on, sue. none of us are that stupid. and neither is carrie.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{maybe not.}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{and you're not going to go? you're going to stay home and miss your senior prom?}
<A>__{just as this point, norma watson a prissy little pleaser with a mouth whose verbal discretion could make the telephone obsolete enters the room with a sheaf of attendance sheets for the next week. all conversation ceases.}
<C>__{collins}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{yes, norma? what is it?}
<C>__{norma}
<D>__{just the attendance sheets, miss collins.}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{just leave them on the desk.}
<P>__{(to sue)}
<D>__{you understand, you can't come without a date?}
<A>__{sue understands perfectly well, but with norma there, she's not about to say a word. and collins finally picks up on this:}
<C>__{collins}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{is there something else, norma?}
<C>__{norma}
<P>__{(butter could melt)}
<D>__{no, miss collins.}

<C>__{collins}
<P>__{(to tommy)}
<D>__{which brings us to you.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{miss collins, i have to get to practice.}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{that's too bad.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{look, this is between sue and me. if you don't mind...}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{oh, but i do. or would you rather we continue this discussion in mr. morton's office?}
<C>__{tommy}
<P>__{(bluffed; then off handedly like we first saw him in fromm's class)}
<D>__{what's the big deal?}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{because it's a very big deal for carrie white. and you know it.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{anyway, she's already said no.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{you can make her change her mind.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{don't overrate me.}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{just don't try.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{it's not okay.}
<P>__{(to collins)}
<D>__{you can't order anyone not to take someone to the prom.}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{i can make sure you don't hurt carrie.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{we're not trying to hurt her. we're trying to help her.}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{how?}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{collins}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{tommy, when you come to the prom with carrie white, don't you think you'll look a little ridiculous?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{we don't care how we look.}
<A>__{sue looks over at tommy.}
<C>__{sue}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{do we?}
<A>__{tommy says nothing; he's caught between a rock and a hard place.}
