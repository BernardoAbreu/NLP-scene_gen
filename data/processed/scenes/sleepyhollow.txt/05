<L>__{interior watchhouse, jail night}
<A>__{a two tiered prison, alive with moans of agony and cries of insanity. cells are full of wretched men in chains and iron gags. many are against the bars, watching.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{our first night watch is adequate against fire and some violence, but if we were more often able to ensure justice, after the fact, then criminals would truly have something to fear from law enforcement.}
<C>__{high constable}
<D>__{have they nothing to fear presently?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{without disrespect, look around you.}
<P>__{(motioning to cells)}
<D>__{we overflow. as do our courts.}
<C>__{high constable}
<D>__{and, with disrespect, constable, if jails and courts overflow, it is testimony to success, not failure.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{but, how many innocents rot here? and, how many victims are buried without reprisal while guilty men roam our streets?}
<A>__{the high constable reaches a desk, taking a seat. guards wait to process beaten, bloody prisoners.}
<C>__{high constable}
<D>__{very few, if any.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{even though i have seen confessions pried from the lips of the accused, often quite literally?}
<C>__{high constable}
<D>__{for one who calls himself a federalist, your mouth reeks of republican liberalism.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{not liberalism. equanimity.}
<C>__{magistrate}
<P>__{(to high constable)}
<D>__{um, sir... might i suggest...}
<A>__{the magistrate whispers in the high constable's ear. ichabod notices with worry that constables one and two wheel the corpse onwards into another room. the magistrate finishes. the high constable smiles faintly.}
<C>__{high constable}
<P>__{(to ichabod)}
<D>__{there is a farming community upstate, constable... ten days journey north in the hudson highlands. it is named sleepy hollow. within a fortnight, three persons have been murdered there. each with their head lopped cleanly off.}
<P>__{(holds up papers)}
<D>__{the elders of the hollow have sent dispatches to me, requesting assistance, and now, just this very moment, i have chosen you.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{chosen me?}
<C>__{high constable}
<D>__{these "methods" of yours... there has been no practical application.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{not for lack of trying.}
<C>__{high constable}
<D>__{just so. granted. and so you take your experimentations to sleepy hollow and catch the murderer who has tainted the place. bring him here to face our good justice. will you do this for me?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<P>__{(swallowing doubt)}
<D>__{i shall, gladly.}
<C>__{high constable}
<D>__{excellent. then, you are excused till morning.}
<A>__{ichabod moves away, heading to where the corpse was taken.}
<C>__{high constable}
<D>__{oh, and, constable...}
<P>__{(off ichabod's look)}
<D>__{do make certain that you meet with success. otherwise... perhaps you should not come back at all.}
<A>__{the high constable smiles a sardonic smile.}
