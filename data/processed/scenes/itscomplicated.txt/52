<L>__{interior jane and jake's hotel room moments later}
<A>__{jake is under the covers, in his robe, a blood pressure cuff around his arm. jane, still in her robe, paces. the hotel doc sits on a chair next to jake's side of the bed.}
<C>__{hotel doc}
<D>__{your blood pressure's good.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{how's his heart?}
<C>__{hotel doc}
<D>__{do you have a heart condition, mr. adler?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{no. and i just had a check up.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you did? oh, that's good.}
<C>__{hotel doc}
<P>__{(listening to his heart)}
<D>__{deep breath. so, no chest pain?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{none.}
<C>__{hotel doc}
<D>__{when you got dizzy, did you feel your heart was beating funny?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{yes, but i was admiring my beautiful...}
<P>__{(indicates jane)}
<A>__{jane holds up her weak eyelid.}
<C>__{hotel doc}
<D>__{ well that's nice to hear after all these years...}
<P>__{(winds up his stethoscope)}
<D>__{did you forget to take any of your medications today?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{took `em all.}
<C>__{hotel doc}
<D>__{what all did you take?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{uh....lipitor, baby aspirin..}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{flomax.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(sitting on the bed)}
<D>__{flomax?}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(embarrassed)}
<D>__{yes, otherwise i pee 40 times a day.}
<C>__{hotel doc}
<D>__{how long have you been taking the flomax?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{not that long. and i only take it sporadically. i have to sneak it actually.}
<P>__{(explains confidentially)}
<D>__{it reduces semen and that's not good for my wife right now.}
<P>__{(to jane)}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{hotel doc}
<P>__{(looks over at jane)}
<D>__{really..?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{yes, i prefer a lot of semen. always have.}
<P>__{(rises)}
<D>__{okay, well, thank you so much for coming. looks like he's gonna live, so...}
<C>__{hotel doc}
<P>__{(packing up)}
<D>__{yeah, my guess is flomax is probably the culprit here. it can definitely give you a sudden drop in blood pressure so i suggest you stay off it for a few weeks, which apparently your wife will appreciate.}
<P>__{(holds in a chuckle)}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{yeah. really good for me.}
<A>__{the doctor snaps his bag shut, rises.}
<C>__{hotel doc}
<D>__{and i suggest you rest quietly for the rest of the afternoon.}
<P>__{(to jane)}
<D>__{no hanky panky, mrs. adler.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{no chance. i assure you.}
