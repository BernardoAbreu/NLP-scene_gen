<B>__{angle on sedan}
<A>__{as the doors open and two powerful mps, one of whom was driving, emerge. the other opens the rear door for colonel samuel trautman who stands, eyeing the imposing facade of the hospital. trautman is in his early fifties and wears the mantle of command sternly but without arrogance. he takes the stairs with purposeful strides, the mps falling in behind him. hold on the sign above the main door as they go inside:}
<C>__{veterans administration hospital}
<L>__{interior hospital}
<A>__{a gray metal door bearing the sign "neuropsychiatric wing" bangs open and a massive orderly in white passes through. he is followed by the two mps, trautman, and a short doctor who hustles to keep up with the others. low angle dolly preceding the entourage as they stride forward. the mps are grim faced and walk in step. trautman and a doctor singleterry silently walk through the corridor. they pass the open day room where somnambulistic patients sit like statuary watching "the young and the restless" or watching the wallpaper fade. bleak light from an overcast day filters through the barred window. the vets seem older than their years and although some show the physical scars of combat, there is no doubt that the greatest trauma for these men is behind the eyes. as they pass the open doors of the rooms of the "chronic ward", haunted eyes turn toward them. as they approach the nurse's station for the "chronic ward" the orderly nods. the head nurse turns to her console. insert as nurse's hand hits a button on the console.}

<A>__{occasionally faces appear at the safety glass windows set in the doors. men whose souls have fled. their eyes track us as we move past. an emaciated man in an untied hospital smock and bare feet stands as if lost in the center of the corridor.}
<B>__{reverse on group}
<A>__{dollying as they detour around the man, whose clawlike hand catches at trautman's tunic. a hoarse, demented shouting issues from one of the doors, a desperate wailing from another.}
<L>__{interior stairwell}
<A>__{close on door latch as keys rattle and the door opens. wider as the group enters a dark service stairwell. the single fluorescent light flickers stroboscopically, a pulsing twilight.}

<D>__{shit. maintenance never gets down here.}
<A>__{they descend two flights to a door of steel bars on a sliding track. the mps flank lewis as he unlocks the door.}
<C>__{singleterry}
<D>__{so what am i supposed to do? can't transfer him to leavenworth. he's civilian. so i put him in an isolation cell that hasn't been used since the spanish inquisition.}

<A>__{rolling aside on metal tracks. clang.}
<L>__{interior corridor}
<A>__{this area of the hospital's basement has been used for little but storage in recent years. stacks of obsolete equipment gathers dust, leaving only a narrow walkspace. the steel doors of the isolation cells yawn open, except for the last one.}

<D>__{maybe you should have tried cutting him some slack.}
<A>__{lewis opens a cabinet near the single locked cell and removes a small rifle. he feeds a syringe like shell into the single shot bolt action.}

<L>__{interior cell}
<A>__{tight on a hand, dimly outlined, as it twists a light bulb a half turn in its socket. in the sudden light the mps face an imposing figure. john rambo, wearing only a pair of filthy jeans, stands "ready" before them. the single light bulb on the low ceiling sends glistening highlights over his taught body. a nasty piece of machinery. long, matted hair coils onto his shoulders, and an unkempt beard heightens the cheekbones beneath eyes which are deep, reptilian. intense. his position, though not overtly threatening, suggests a willingness to strike without warning which gives the m.p.'s pause. trautman steps forward between the mps.}

<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{mind if i sit down?}
<A>__{rambo motions to the narrow bunk, dropping into an oriental squat himself as the colonel sits. trautman's manner with rambo is familiar, somehow paternal. a bit of an ironic grin twitches briefly.}

<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{i hear you're not enjoying it here.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{i could take it or leave it.}

<D>__{am i out of here?}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{that depends on you.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{christ, look at you. i give you this easy duty until i can get you an assignment... all you have to do is eat ice cream and watch soap operas... and you have to make it rambo's last stand.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{there were treating me like a headcase.}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{hard to believe. you shoot up one little town in oregon with a fifty caliber machine gun... one little dogpatch town... and everybody figures your wrapper's broken. no sense of humor.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{what did you expect? an engraved plague from the chamber of commerce?}
<A>__{rambo looks at his hands. when he finally speaks his voice seems distant, disembodied.}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{in 'nam i flew gunships. million dollar equipment. back here nobody trusts me to park cars. i keep thinking it's going to be okay... but i've been out six years and it's not okay. sometimes i feel like i'm coming right out of my skin.}
<A>__{the colonel nods slowly. he notices a battered shoebox on the floor beside the bed. the cell is absolutely devoid of personal articles otherwise.}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{this your stuff?}
<C>__{rambo}
<D>__{that's it. my life.}
<B>__{tight on shoebox}
<A>__{as trautman flips through a number of worn snapshots of the men in rambo's special forces unit. they are horsing around, in and out of uniform. a younger, cleanshaven rambo is among them. he is grinning broadly in one shot. it seems uncharacteristic of the hardened man we see now.}

<P>__{(haltingly)}
<D>__{i just wanted... i don't know... after all that... i just wanted one person, one person, to come up to me and say "you did good, john." and mean it. that's all.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{after all that.}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{you just picked that wrong war to be a hero in.}

<A>__{rambo and trautman cross the manicured grounds, escorted by the two grim mps. a number of wheelchair bound vets enjoy the sunshine b.g. and a desultory game of volleyball is in progress. still, the impression is of the detritus of war left scattered on a huge lawn like broken toys. as the two approach a conservatively dressed man waiting on a bench under a plane tree, stands.}
<C>__{trautman}
<D>__{jason kirkhill... john rambo.}
<A>__{kirkhill extends his hand in greeting, but rambo coolly half turns to reveal his hands, locked in wrist cuffs separated by a steel bar so that they can hang comfortably at his sides. kirkhill grins affably. drops his hand.}
<C>__{kirkhill}
<D>__{good to meet you, rambo. how are you?}
<A>__{rambo scans kirkhill's face, noting the cold scrutiny all but concealed in the smile lines.}

<B>__{tight on rambo}

<A>__{rolls on its side in a tight turn, despite its bulk. twice the size and power of the huey, and faster at the top end, the high performance assault ship is a formidable opponent. but rambo pits skill against technology, using the agility of his craft as his primary strategy.}
