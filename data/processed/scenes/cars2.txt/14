<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{inside at the bar fillmore and sarge watch as guido mixes drinks, ala "cocktail." mater arrives.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{guido! what's mcqueen's usual?}
<C>__{guido}
<P>__{(in italian, subtitled)}
<D>__{how should i know?}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{perfect! give me two of `em.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{quiet! my program's on.}
<C>__{mel dorado }
<D>__{tonight on "the mel dorado show"!}
<A>__{on the bar tv "the mel dorado show," a cable talk show, begins with file footage of miles axlerod, a sleek suv.}
<C>__{mel dorado }
<D>__{his story gripped the world! oil billionaire miles axlerod, in an attempt to become the first car to circumnavigate the globe without gps, ironically ran out of gas and found himself trapped in the wild!}
<A>__{we see images of newspaper headlines, search crews.}
<C>__{mel dorado }
<D>__{feared dead, he emerged 36 days later, running on a fuel he'd distilled himself from the natural elements! since then he's sold his oil fortune, converted himself from a gas guzzler into an electric car, and has devoted his life to finding a renewable, clean burning fuel!}
<A>__{images of oil derricks torn down; miles axlerod getting converted to electric; lab scientists testing chemicals.}
<C>__{mel dorado }
<D>__{now he claims to have done it with his allinol.}
<A>__{images of fields, rivers, vegetables, and mountains all combining to form the allinol logo.}
<C>__{mel dorado }
<D>__{and to show the world what his new superfuel can do, he's created a racing competition like no other, inviting the greatest champions from around the globe to battle in the first ever world grand prix. welcome sir miles axlerod.}
<A>__{sir miles axlerod arrives, parks across from mel's desk.}
<C>__{miles axlerod }
<D>__{thank you, mel. it is very good to be here. now listen to me: big oil. it costs a fortune. pollution is getting worse. i mean, come on. it's a fossil fuel. fossil. as in dead dinosaurs. and we all know what happened to them. alternative energy is the future. trust me, mel, after seeing allinol in action at the world grand prix, nobody will ever go back to gasoline again.}
<C>__{mater}
<P>__{(to fillmore)}
<D>__{what happened to the dinosaurs, now?}
<C>__{mel dorado }
<D>__{and on satellite, a world grand prix competitor and one of the fastest cars in the world, francesco bernoulli.}
<A>__{across the screen: live from rome, italy. we meet formula race car francesco bernoulli.}
<C>__{francesco }
<D>__{it is an honor, signore dorado. for you.}
<C>__{mel dorado }
<D>__{miles, why not invite lightning mcqueen?}
<A>__{mater, collecting his drinks, looks up, half intrigued.}
<C>__{miles axlerod }
<D>__{of course we invited him. but apparently after a very long racing season he is taking some time off to rest.}
<C>__{francesco }
<D>__{lightning mcqueen would not have a chance against francesco!}
<A>__{mater doesn't like this.}
<C>__{francesco }
<D>__{i can go over 300 kilometers an hour! in miles that is like, uh... way faster than mcqueen.}
<C>__{mel dorado }
<D>__{let's go to the phones. baltimore, maryland, you're on the air.}
<C>__{caller }
<D>__{am i on? hello?}
<C>__{mel dorado }
<D>__{you're on. go ahead.}
<C>__{caller }
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{mel dorado }
<D>__{go ahead, caller.}
<A>__{dial tone.}
<C>__{mel dorado }
<D>__{let's go to radiator springs. you're on, caller.}
<C>__{mater's voice }
<D>__{yeah, that italian feller you got on there can't talk that way about lightning mcqueen. he's the bestest race car in the whole wide world.}
<A>__{fillmore and sarge look around. mater is visible in the back of the bar on an office phone.}
<C>__{sarge}
<D>__{uh oh...}
<C>__{francesco }
<D>__{if he is, how you say "the bestest race car," then why must he rest, eh?}
<C>__{mater's voice }
<D>__{cause he knows what's important. every now and then he prefers just to slow down, enjoy life.}
<C>__{francesco }
<D>__{ah, you heard it! lightning mcqueen prefers to be slow! of course, this is not news to francesco. when i want to go to sleep i watch one of his races. after two laps i am out cold.}
<A>__{audible rxns from the bar. a crowd has been forming ever since mater started talking.}
<C>__{mater's voice }
<D>__{that ain't what i meant.}
