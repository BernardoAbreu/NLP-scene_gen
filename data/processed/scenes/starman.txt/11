<A>__{the police car passes a road perpendicular to the one it is on. a couple of houses down that road a faint glow spills over the sides of an industrial dumpster. as we watch we hear an eerie high pitched whistle, a shaft of light slowly rises out of the metal box and seems to fly off between the houses.}
<L>__{interior finished house night}
<A>__{as a humanoid silhouette passes in front of the picture window, a shaft of light floats by in the fog outside. the silhouette continues around to look at the kitchen. it raises a hand to eye level. there is a sharp "snap" and a hard edged cone of light shoots out of the darkness to capture the inside of the kitchen and pulls back a three dimensional image of stove, sink, cupboards, electrical fixtures and walls to the silhouette.}
