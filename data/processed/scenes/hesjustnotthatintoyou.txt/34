<L>__{interior red maple night}
<A>__{it's late. the bar is nearly empty. alex is totaling receipts and gigi is still nursing a drink.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{look, you seem like a cool girl, so i'm just gonna be honest conor is never going to call you.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{oh really? how do you know?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{because i'm a guy. it's how we do it.}
<C>__{gigi}
<P>__{(hopeful)}
<D>__{he said it was nice meeting me.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i don't care if he said you were his favorite female since his mommy and joanie cunningham. over a week went by and he didn't call.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{but maybe he called me and i didn't get the message. or maybe he lost my number, or was out of town, or was hit by a cab, or his grandma died.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{or maybe he just didn't call because he has no interest in seeing you again.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{yeah but my friend terri once went out with this guy who never called and she totally wrote him off then like a year later she ran into him }
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{your friend terri's an idiot. and she's the exception.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{ok. but what if i'm the exception?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{you're not. you're the rule. and the rule is if a guy doesn't call you, he doesn't want to call you.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{really? always?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{yeah. always. i know what blowing off a woman looks like. i do it early and i do it often. trust me if a guy is treating you like he doesn't give a shit he doesn't. no exceptions.}
<A>__{gigi thinks this over.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{why are you telling me all of this? aren't these man secrets like why men need to watch televised golf?}
<A>__{alex laughs.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i don't know. you looked like you could really use the help.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{thank you. you've given me a lot to think about.}
<A>__{gigi smiles at him.}
