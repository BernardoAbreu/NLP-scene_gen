<C>__{the bride }
<D>__{this pasadena homemaker's name is jeanne bell. her husband is dr. lawrence bell. but back when we were acquainted, five years ago, her name was vernita green. her code name, was "cobra"..... mine was black mamba.}
<A>__{the two combat artists sit at the kitchen table, drinking coffee out of vernita's coffee mugs.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{were you expecting me?}
<C>__{vernita}
<D>__{yes and no. bill got in touch with me right after you woke up, and then again a little later after your episode in japan.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{so i suppose it's a little late for a apology, huh?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{you suppose correctly.}
<C>__{vernita}
<D>__{even if i was sincere?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{oh. i'm quite positive you're sorry, now.}
<A>__{vernita says to the bride across the table furiously but with low volume;}
<C>__{vernita}
<D>__{look bitch, i need to know if you're gonna start anymore shit around my baby girl!}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{you can relax for now. i'm not going to murder you in front of your daughter.}
<C>__{vernita}
<D>__{that's being more rational than bill led me to believe you were capable of.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{well that's a demonstration of bill's complete ignorance when it comes to the subject of me, and what i'm thinking, and what i might do. it's mercy, compassion, and forgiveness i lack, not rationality.}
<A>__{she pauses for effect the ham.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{i will wait for now, but i won't wait for long. i will allow you to choose a time and place for us to meet again, preferably as far away from nikki as possible. i could have just hit you, i didn't, i demand respect for that. since this is not a hit, consider it a duel. and as two former deadly vipers, we will observe viper rules of honor. one on one no help no bushwhackin no treacherous weapons on weapon of choice our skill and our bodies.}
<A>__{vernita says her name;}
<C>__{vernita}
<P>__{(bleep)}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{ i'm not through telling you. failure to keep our date, or duplicity of any kind, will result in me putting a xoxo hollow point bullet into the back of your skull from a window of a building across the street from nikki's elementary school. now, feel free to respond.}
<C>__{vernita}
<D>__{look...i know i fucked you over. i fucked you over bad. i wish to god i hadn't, but i did.}
<A>__{the blonde listens to the black woman with a poker face.}
<C>__{vernita}
<D>__{if i could go back in a machine i would, but i can't. all i can tell you is i'm a different person now.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{i don't care.}
<C>__{vernita}
<D>__{be that as it may, i know i do not deserve mercy or forgiveness. however, i beseech you for both on behalf of my daughter.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{ bitch, you can stop right there.}
<A>__{the b word stops vernita short, almost like a cold handed slap in the face (it should affect the audience that way as well).}
<C>__{the bride}
<P>__{(leans in close)}
<D>__{just because i have no wish to murder you before the eyes of your daughter, does not mean parading her around in front of me is going to inspire sympathy. you and i have unfinished business. and not a goddamn fuckin thing you've done in the subsequent five years including getting knocked up is going to change that.}
<C>__{vernita}
<D>__{you have every right to wanna get even }
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{ but that's where you're wrong, vernita. i don't want to get even. to get even, even steven. i would have to kill you, go into nikki's room, kill her, then wait for your old man, dr. bell, to come home and kill him. that would make us even. no, my unborn daughter will just hafta be satisfied with your death at her mother's hands.}
<A>__{vernita knows no matter what else is said, blood will spill.}
<C>__{vernita}
<D>__{when do we do this?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{it all depends... when do you want to die? tomorrow? the day after tomorrow? that's about as long as i will wait.}
<C>__{vernita}
<D>__{how bout tonight, bitch?}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{spendid. where?}
<C>__{vernita}
<D>__{there's a baseball diamond where our little league has its games, about a mile from here. we meet there around two thirty in the morning, dressed all in black, your hair in a black stocking, and we have us a knife fight, we won't be bothered. i have to fix nikki's cereal.}
<A>__{as they continue to talk, vernita pulls down a cereal bowl for her daughter and lays it on the kitchen counter.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{bill said you were one of the best ladies he'd ever seen with an edged weapon.}
<A>__{vernita moves to another kitchen cabinet, and pulls down a box of the sugar cereal, "kaboom."}
<C>__{vernita}
<D>__{fuck you, bitch, i know he didn't qualify it, so you can just kiss my motherfuckin ass, black mamba.}
<P>__{(snorts to herself)}
<D>__{black mamba, i shoulda been motherfuckin black mamba.}
<A>__{as the two females continue to talk, vernita reaches her hand inside the cereal box.}
<C>__{the bride}
<D>__{weapon of choice? and if you want to stick with your butcher knife, i'm cool with that.}
<C>__{vernita}
<D>__{very funny.}
<A>__{vernita fires a gun from inside the cereal box at the bride.... .... the bullet explodes out of the cardboard box, and hits the coffee mugh directly in front of the bride, blowing it to}
<B>__{smithereens.}
<A>__{the bride throws herself on the floor.... vernita pulls the gun out of the cereal box and firees again... ...the bullet hits the floor of the tiny kitchen... ...the bride moves under the kitchen table, then using her back, lifts the table off the ground, ramming it straight}
