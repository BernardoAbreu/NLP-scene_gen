<L>__{exterior in front of a train station day}
<A>__{some quick shots of a fountain gushing water, pigeons flapping away looking agitated. cut : to ryuji sitting on a bench. hes deep in thought, writing in a notepad. there are multitudes of people about him, and we can hear the sounds of their coming and going. a pair of legs attached to a woman in white dress, hose, and pumps appears, heading directly for ryuji. her pace is slow, rhythmical, and as that pace progresses all other sounds fade : into the background, so that all we can hear is the clomp, clomp as those legs walk to stand just before ryuji. the pumps are scuffed, dirtied with grime. a gust of wind rips by. ryuji fights the urge to look up as in his ears rings the same hollowed, multi voiced babbling heard on the videotape. the sound grows stronger.}
<C>__{ryuji }
<D>__{so, it was you. you did it.}
<A>__{the babbling fades, disappears as slowly the worlds normal background sounds return. ryuji looks up, but the woman in white is nowhere to be seen.}
