<A>__{more deeply asleep than ever. suddenly, from inside, comes the sound of quiet riot singing screaming "bang your head." it's the stereo, and boy, is it cranked. jud straightens up so suddenly he almost falls off his chair. his hands go first to his earphones his first thought on waking is that it's coming from there and then he hurries inside. camera pans down to small muddy tracks on the porch floor.}
