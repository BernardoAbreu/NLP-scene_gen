<A>__{paul (50's) stands on the street under a raised train bridge. he covers his ears in utter disgust at the unbearable noise a train makes as it roars overhead. he bellows to the heavens.}

<D>__{fucking god!!!!}
<A>__{as the train moves on he walks, slowly, despondent. lost in a private world of pain. behind him we see a woman in a fur collard coat and flowered hat walking, gaining on him. this is jeanne (20's). as she passes paul, she turns to glance at him. we read a hint of empathy on her face. he is oblivious to her or anything else for that matter. she walks on, dodging street sweepers as she covers the long walkway, trying to forget the sad man she saw. we see her walk toward a 6 story apartment building. paul, with tears streaming down his face, comes to reality as he also notices the building. he regards it.}
