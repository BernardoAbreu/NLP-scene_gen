<L>__{interior inn, montfermeil end of day}
<A>__{cosette is in the process of sweeping the floor. she's come to a stop, gazing out of the window, mesmerized by the sight of the most beautiful doll in the display, and jealous that eponine can see it and touch it up close.}
<C>__{cosette}
<D>__{there is a castle on a cloud i like to go there in my sleep. aren't any floors for me to sweep, not in my castle on a cloud.}
<A>__{cosette gets out from a hiding place in the wall a knotted grimy rag this is her "doll", the knot is the doll's head.}
<D>__{there is a lady all in white holds me and sings a lullaby. she's nice to see and she's soft to touch}
<P>__{(holding doll to her ear and whispering)}
<D>__{she says, cosette, i love you very much. i know a place where no one's lost i know a place where no one cries. crying at all is not allowed, not in my castle on a cloud.}
<A>__{madame thenardier comes bustling down the stairs in a bad mood. she glowers at little cosette and changes the closed sign from "closed" to "open".}
<C>__{madame thenardier}
<D>__{now look who's here! the little madam herself, pretending once again she's been so awfully good! better not let me catch you slacking! better not catch my eye! ten rotten francs your mother sends me what is that going to buy? now take that pail, my little mademoiselle, and go and draw some water from the well. we should never have taken you in in the first place how stupid the things that we do! like mother, like daughter, the scum of the street.}
<A>__{cosette goes to put the broom away. eponine comes in from outside.}
<C>__{madame thenardier}
<D>__{eponine, come my dear. eponine, let me see you. you look very well in that little blue hat! there's some little girls who know how to behave and they know what to wear and i'm saying thank heaven for that!}
<A>__{madame thenardier sees that cosette far from going is hiding behind the far wall. we see cosette's frightened eyes peering out from a tiny gap in this wall.}
<C>__{madame thenardier}
<D>__{still there, cosette? your tears will do you no good! i told you to fetch some water from the well in the wood.}
<C>__{cosette}
<P>__{(singing through the gap)}
<D>__{please do not send me out alone. not in the darkness on my own.}
<A>__{madame thenardier imitates cosette as she sings.}
<C>__{madame thenardier}
<P>__{(singing through the gap)}
<D>__{enough of that, or i will forget to be nice! you heard me ask for something, and i never ask twice!}
<A>__{the innkeeper's gang posing as customers who have been loitering outside come in, explaining to a fifth man who is a newer recruit a story from monsieur thenardier's past. madame thenardier goes outside to open up the rather pathetic frost fair stall on the porch of the inn.}
<C>__{customer 1}
<D>__{mine host thenardier he was there, so they say, at the field of waterloo.}
<C>__{customer 2}
<D>__{got there, it's true, when the fight was all through but he knew just what to do.}
<C>__{customer 3}
<D>__{crawling through the mud, so i've heard it said,}
<P>__{(more)}
<C>__{customer 3 }
<D>__{picking through the pockets of the english dead.}
<C>__{customer 4}
<D>__{he made a tidy score from the spoils of war.}
<A>__{we suddenly hear the voice of the landlord, thenardier. he has been there all the time, asleep on a bench. he wakes from his drunken slumbers and roars out:}
<C>__{thenardier}
<D>__{my band of soaks, my den of dissolutes, my dirty jokes, my always pissed as newts, my sons of whores, spend their lives in my inn! homing pigeons homing in they fly through my doors, and their money's as good as yours!}
