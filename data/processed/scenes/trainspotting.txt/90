<D>__{swanney taught us to adore and respect the national health service, for it was the source of much of our gear. we stole drugs, we stole prescriptions, or bought them, sold them, swapped them, forged them, photocopied them or traded them with cancer victims, alcoholics, old age pensioners, aids patients, epileptics and bored housewives. we took morphine, diamorphine, cyclozine, codeine, temazepam, nitrezepam, phenobarbitone, sodium amytal dextropropoxyphene, methadone, nalbuphine, pethidine, pentazocine, buprenorphine, dextromoramide chlormethiazole. the streets are awash with drugs that you can have for unhappiness and pain, and we took them all. fuck it, we would have injected vitamin c if only they'd made it illegal.}
