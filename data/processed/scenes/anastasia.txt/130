<D>__{watch me.}
<A>__{vladimir starts to protest. dmitri grabs the invitation and tears it up, tossing the pieces into the air. vladimir sighs.}

<D>__{so where will you go?}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{she found her home. maybe it's time i found one too!}
<B>__{new pov}
<A>__{from outside the window. we do not hear them, but we see vlad and dmitri hug good bye.}
<B>__{pull rack}
<A>__{to see it's rasputin's pov; as he stands on a ladder of smoke, looking into dmitri's window. rasputin watches vladimir leave as dmitri finishes packing.}
