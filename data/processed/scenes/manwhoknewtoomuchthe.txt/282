<A>__{drayton glances down to his bible, opens it a certain page, and as he does so, he looks at his wife who is sitting near the organ. she half turns to look up at him. she seems frightened. drayton fumbles with the pages of the bible, apparently trying to make something out of his wife's attitude. failing, he looks up and begins his sermon. he speaks into a microphone.}

<D>__{brothers and sisters: the subject of my address this evening is adversity. the average life, yours and mine, is often harassed and perplexed by cruelties and disappointments beyond our control.}
<A>__{strangely enough, it is often the things beyond our control which help to make us better beings. pain and tribulation are the testing ground of life and let us be grateful for them. let us bless the disappointments and the frustrations and say a prayer for the agony of the moment. only thus shall we confirm and re confirm our own goodness and therefore the essential goodness of all mankind.}
