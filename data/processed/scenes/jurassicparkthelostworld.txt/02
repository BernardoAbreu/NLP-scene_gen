<L>__{interior board room day}
<A>__{mrs. bowman's screaming face dissolves slowly over the yawning face of a bored corporate executive, twenty other executives sit around a conference table in the boardroom of a monied corporation. all are in expensive suits, most are over sixty. there are rows of backbenchers too, whispering in their lawyers who sit behind their clients, whispering in their ears. empty coffee cups and fast food containers on the table hint that everyone's been here a long time. a familiar voice resounds through the boardroom as we move down the long table, pat the grim faces of the board members.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{the hurricane seemed like a disaster at the time, but now i think it was a blessing, nature's way of freeing those animals from their human confines. of giving them another chance to survive, but this time as they were meant to, without man's interference.}
<A>__{the source of the voice is john hammond, the founder of ingen and creator of jurassic park. but he's not in the room. his image is on a closed circuit tv screen, which has been wheeled up to the end of the table. and he doesn't look good. he's terribly infirmed, propped up in bed, his face pale and drawn, medical equipment beeping around him.}
<C>__{hammond }
<D>__{there are some corporate issues that are not about the bottom line. we have so much still to learn about those creatures. a whole world of intricate, interlocking behaviors, vanished everywhere except for site b. please. let's not do what is good for more men at the expense at what is best for all mankind.}
<A>__{the chairman, seventyish, nods awkwardly to the television.}
<C>__{chairman}
<D>__{thank you, john. mr. ludlow?}
<A>__{he turns to peter ludlow, late thirties, a man with the anxious look of someone who insists the buck stop on his desk. ludlow flips open a file, pulls out a stack of black and white eight by tens, and tosses them on the table.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<P>__{(an accent similar to hammond's)}
<D>__{these pictures were taken in a hospital in costa rica forty eight hours ago, after an american family on a yacht cruise stumbled onto site b. the little girl will be fine, but her parents are wealthy, angry, and very fond of lawsuits. but that's hardly new to us, is it?}
<P>__{(takes a paper from the file)}
<D>__{wrongful death settlements, partial list: family of donald gennaro, 36.5 million dollars; family of robert muldoon, 12.6 million. damaged or destroyed equipment, 17.3 million. demolition, de construction, and disposal of isla nublar facilities, organic and inorganic, one hundred and twenty six million dollars. the list goes on, gentlemen research funding, media payoffs. silence is expensive.}
<A>__{he's warming up. not a bad performer.}
<C>__{ludlow }
<D>__{this corporation has been bleeding from the throat for four years. you, our board of directors, have set patiently and listened to ecology lectures while mr. hammond signed your checks and spent your money. you have watched your stock drop from seventy eight and a quarter to nineteen flat with no good and in sight. and all along, we have held a significant product asset that we could have safely harvested and displayed for profit. enormous profit.}
<A>__{he reaches out to a model on the table and gives it a shove, sending it sliding down the length of the table in front of them. it's a mini mall version of a zoo. cages hold tiny replicas of various kinds of dinosaurs while boy scout troops and tourists look on in wonder.}
<C>__{ludlow }
<D>__{enough money to wipe out four years of lawsuits and damage control and unpleasant infighting, enough to not only send our stock back to where it was but to double it. and the one thing, the only thing standing between us and this asset is a born again naturalist who happens to be our own ceo. well, i don't work for mother nature. i work for you.}
<A>__{two of his backbenchers distribute documents from a stack. ludlow takes one and reads from it.}
<C>__{ludlow }
<D>__{"whereas the chief executive officer has engaged in wasteful and negligent business practices to further his own personal environmental beliefs whereas these practices have affected the financial performance of the company by incurring significant losses whereas the shareholders have been materially harmed by these losses thereby, be it resolved that john parker hammond should be resolved from the office of chief executive officer, affective immediately." mr. chairman, i move the resolution be put to an immediate vote. do i have a second?}
<C>__{board member}
<D>__{i second the motion, mr. chairman, please poll the members by a show of hands.}
<A>__{the chairman signs heavily, feeling like a traitor. he can't bear to look at hammond on the tv monitor.}
<C>__{chairman}
<D>__{all those in favor of ingen corporate resolution 213c, please signify your approval by raising your right hand.}
<A>__{it starts slowly, guiltily, but every hand in the room goes up. ludlow sits back, victorious. hammond, furious, raises his right hand, which holds a remote control, and points it at the tv screen. it goes blank.}
