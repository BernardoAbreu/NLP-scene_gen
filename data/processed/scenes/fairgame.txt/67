<L>__{interior bathroom. day.}
<A>__{paul, the chief analyst, comes out of the stall. analyst 2 is there, throwing up in the sink.}
<C>__{analyst 2}
<D>__{he thinks i don't know how serious it is.. weeks and weeks of fifteen hour days, we've gone back over and over it.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{ok. i will handle this.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{scooter listens patiently to paul, the chief analyst.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{and so apart from all the scepticism surrounding the specification, the analysis from the iaea which i believe is numbered in the report..}
<P>__{(stops. changes tack)}
<D>__{mr libby. energy department nuclear scientists are among the most boring people on the planet. they can talk about gas centrifuges until you want to jump out of a window. and maybe once every ten years someone comes along and says "so, tell me about gas centrifuges". that's literally the only time you should listen to these guys. if they say an aluminium tube is not for a gas centrifuge it's like a fish talking about water. we've been over this data with you now five, six times. and... we don't really know how you want us to play this..}
<A>__{libby listens. he nods. waits.}
<C>__{libby}
<D>__{let me level with you here paul. i don't know what these tubes are for. from everything you're saying, there could be something to this, but very likely not, right?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{exactly.}
<C>__{libby}
<D>__{may i ask a question? when you say we don't really know how to play this, what do you mean?}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(stops. turns white)}
<D>__{i'm just saying i don't know how to say it any other way than that }
<C>__{libby}
<D>__{except you didn't say `i' you said `we'. so you and the others have discussed how to "play" these briefings. why does the cia feel the need to play these briefings?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no. i mean that.. ok. i didn't mean what i just said.}
<C>__{libby}
<D>__{which part. the last part. or other things too.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i'm a getting a little confused }
<C>__{libby}
<D>__{you want me to come back?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no. god no.}
<A>__{the temperature drops five degrees.}
<C>__{libby}
<D>__{you don't know why i'm here do you? in 1991 the united states invaded iraq, and afterwards weapons inspectors discovered saddam was six months off enriching uranium to sufficiently high specification to make a nuclear bomb. he had fissile material. and not a single person at the cia, from the dci down to the janitor had the slightest clue that such a program even existed. so now, one decade on, are you telling me that you're 100% sure these tubes are not intended to create nuclear weapons?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i..sir..ok. with intelligence, nothing's 100 percent.}
<C>__{libby}
<D>__{so. what? are you.. ninety nine percent sure? ninety eight?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you can't put an exact figure. you can't be that precise.}
<C>__{libby}
<D>__{but if you had to say, could you say you're ninety seven percent sure? is there a three percent chance you've got this wrong? or four? or five? still pretty good odds. you like those odds paul? you willing to put your name to that. are you ready to make that call?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i don't make the call, sir .}
<C>__{libby}
<P>__{(fixing him)}
<D>__{yes you do paul. each time you interpret a piece of data. each time you choose a "maybe" over a "perhaps" you make a call. a decision. and right now you're making lots of little decisions adding up to a big decision and out there's a real world where millions of people depend upon you being right. but what if there's a one percent chance you're wrong. can you say for sure you'll take that chance and state, as a fact, that this equipment is not intended for a nuclear weapons programme?}
<A>__{the analyst sits frozen.}
<C>__{libby}
<D>__{do you know what one percent of the population of this country is? it's three million, two hundred and forty thousand souls.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{sir. we're not machines. we.. it.. we look at the evidence, we game it out. not everyone agrees all the time. it's a process.}
<C>__{libby}
<D>__{it's a process.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{libby}
<D>__{and not everyone agrees.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{exactly.}
<C>__{libby}
<D>__{who doesn't agree?}
<A>__{sfx: a volley of gunfire. followed by another. and another.}
