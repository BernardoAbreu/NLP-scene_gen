<L>__{exterior town night at the crater}
<A>__{smoke and dust whirl around a huge hole in the earth. splintered shreds of lumber stick up in the air like giant toothpicks. some of the toothpicks start to move. jacob rises out of the destruction, charred, scraped, battered and, unfortunately, alive. he climbs up to the edge of the crater. he looks back a the remnants of his home. then something starts to happen. something his growing from the crater spreading out. it's not a cloud, it's not smoke it's a darkness. even though it's night, this darkness is darker. it creeps out from the hole fingers of blackness reaching out. what it covers doesn't disappear. it becomes gloomy. the shroud is getting bigger. and it's getting faster. jacob runs. with jacob running he bolts down the streets of the small town in a blind panic. he looks behind him and sees the darkness getting bigger, its gloominess covering houses. then whole blocks. everything it touches seems to fall deeper into shadow.}
<B>__{at the street corner}
<A>__{jacob comes across a woman walking her dog. he stops and yells at her.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{get the hell out of here! it's coming!}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{what's coming?}
<A>__{jacob points down the street. the shroud is swooping down the road browning out street lights in its wake. and the woman doesn't find anything threatening about this. jacob screams at her.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{don't you see it?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{see what?}
<A>__{and it's obvious now: she doesn't see anything. the woman is totally oblivious to the danger. jacob shakes his head stumbles away. the woman watches him go as the darkness passes over her. she sighs. and begins to mutate. her hair gets scraggly, her skin bursts out in sores, her back grows a hump all of which she doesn't seem to notice. she just shrugs her twisted shoulders.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{kids...watcha gonna do?}
<A>__{she hobbles away with her dog which now has six legs and two heads. back with jacob running like a bat running from hell, he tears through the streets passing buildings that turn creepy and people that become passively accepting monsters. a voice booms out from nowhere.}
<C>__{freddy }
<D>__{jacob! you're too old to run away from home!}
<A>__{jacob covers his ears and races out of town.}
