<A>__{scar's dead body has been laid to rest in a place of honor. scar's faceplate is off, displaying the predator warrior scar. he died a warrior's death. the air is heavy with incense and some kind of religious ceremony has just finished. the last of the predator elders is filing out of the room, returning to the cryo stasis tubes, ready for the journey back into deep space. scar's body is left alone in the silent chamber. scar's chest begins to convulse! tearing its way out of scar's dead body is an alien chest burster! the alien that develops inside a predator is bigger and more frightening than anything we've ever seen. a hybrid between alien and predator. an unstoppable killing machine. and its loose on the predator ship, heading for god knows where. close on the alien predator hybrid as it bursts free. covered in predator blood. razor sharp teeth catching the light.}
