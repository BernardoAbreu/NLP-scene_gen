<L>__{interior kitchen, cobb and mal's house moments later}
<A>__{ariadne follows cobb into the kitchen. a thin man is there, standing by the table. he holds a folded piece of paper.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{this is your house?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{mine and mal's.}
<C>__{ariadne}
<D>__{where is she?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{she'd already died.}
<A>__{the thin man offers cobb the piece of paper. a child's shout cobb turns. ariadne follows his gaze to the garden. a small blonde boy faces away from them, crouched on his haunches to look at something on the ground.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{it's james. my boy. he's found something. maybe a worm.}
<A>__{a slightly older girl runs into view.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{and there's philippa.}
<A>__{she crouches beside the boy. their faces are away from us. they point and discuss whatever is on the ground.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{i thought about calling out, so they'd turn and smile those incredible smiles... but i'm out of time }
<A>__{the thin man thrusts the paper into cobb's hand.}
<C>__{thin man}
<D>__{right now. or never, cobb.}
<A>__{cobb nods, turns from the window }
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{then i panic that i will always wish i'd seen them turn, that i can't waste this chance...}
<A>__{cobb turns back to call out but the children race off...}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{but the moment's passed. and whatever i do, the dream's always the same... when i'm about to call... they run.}
<A>__{cobb watches them run off, calling for grandma, faces unseen.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{if i'm going to see their faces again i've got to get back here in the real world...}
<A>__{behind him, ariadne slams the grill shut. cobb turns.}
