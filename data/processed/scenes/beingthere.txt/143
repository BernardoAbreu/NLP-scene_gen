<L>__{exterior rand mansion patio morning}
<A>__{a light snow is failing. eve is in a fur coat, holds a steaming cup of coffee. chance stands next to her, an umbrella in one hand. he holds his other arm out, catching the snowflakes as they fall.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{... and i feel so free now, chauncey. until i met you, i never felt acknowledged by a man...}
<P>__{(chance gazes out at the falling snow)}
<D>__{... i always had the feeling that i was just a vessel for a man, someone that he could take hold of, pierce, and pollute. i was merely an aspect of somebody's lovemaking. do you know what i mean?}
<A>__{chance turns to her, says nothing, presses the cold snowflakes to his face.}
<C>__{eve }
<P>__{(presses close to him)}
<D>__{dearest, you uncoil my wants; desire flows within me, and when you watch me my passion dissolves it. you set me free. i reveal myself to myself and i am drenched and purged.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{that's very interesting, eve.}
<A>__{teresa appears in the doorway.}
<C>__{teresa}
<D>__{mr. gardiner. mr. rand would like to see you.}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes. i would like to see ben.}
<A>__{chance gives eve a warm smile, then follows teresa into the house.}
