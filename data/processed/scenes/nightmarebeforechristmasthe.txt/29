<A>__{jack sits up in the snow bank where he has landed. he looks excitedly around. he marvels first at the miracle of snow. >>>>> what's this?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what's this? what's this? there's color everywhere... what's this? there's white things in the air... what's this? i can't believe my eyes i must be dreaming, wake up, jack, this isn't fair... what's this?}
<A>__{he cavorts excitedly in the snow, slipping and sliding and finally tumbling down a hill into the center of christmastown. he springs up, shakes himself off, and enthusiastically explores the snow blanketed village.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{what's this? what's this? there's something very wrong... what's this? there're people singing songs... what's this? the streets are lined with little creatures laughing, everybody seems so happy, have i possibly gone daffy...? what is this...? what's this? there're children throwing snowballs here instead of throwing heads. they're busy building toys and absolutely no one's dead.}
<A>__{here in christmastown, every tree is a christmas tree and each house is shinier and more beautifully decorated than the nexterior}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{there's frost on every window, oh, i can't believe my eyes, and in my bones i feel a warmth that's coming from inside...}
<A>__{jack peeks into warmly lighted homes... jack uses his consummate halloween trickster skills to see without being seen...}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{oh, look, what's this? they're hanging mistletoe... they kiss why that looks so unique... inspired! they're gathering around to hear a story, roasting chestnuts on a fire... what's this? what's this? in here they've got a little tree... how queer! and who would ever think... and why? they're covering it with tiny little things, they've got electric lights on strings, and there's a smile on everyone, so now correct me if i'm wrong... this looks like fun, this looks like fun, oh, could it be i got my wish...? what's this?}
<A>__{jack enters the childrens' cozy bedroom in one house...}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{oh my, what now? the children are asleep... but look there's nothing underneath... no ghouls no witches here to scream and scare them ... or ensnare them... only cozy little things secure inside their dreamland... what's this?}
<A>__{distracted, jack goes off to leave the child at whom he has been peering suddenly wide awake and terrified... jack is back outside...}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{the monsters are all missing and the nightmares can't be found and in their place there seems to be good feeling all around... instead of screams i swear i can hear music in the air. the smell of cakes and pies is absolutely everywhere... the sights, the sounds, they're everywhere and all around... i've never felt so good before... the empty place inside of me is filling up i simply cannot get enough. i want it, oh, i want it... oh, i want it for my own. i've got to know i've got to know what is this place that i have found? what is this???}
<A>__{jack darts this way and that and runs and runs, trying to get his fill of this strange new wonderful place. he trips and falls and starts to roll and as he rolls he gathers snow he becomes a gigantic snowball barrelling through christmas town, stopping only when he slams into}
<B>__{one of two gigantic candy canes...}
<A>__{between which spans a sign. jack bursts out of his snow ball only to have fresh snow dumped on him which falls from the sign between the two tall candy canes. jack shakes himself free of this fresh heap of snow, looks up at the wide welcoming sign:}

<A>__{and thoughtfully reads...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{.... christmastown? hmmmmmmmm.}
<A>__{jack studies the town from this distance the lights glow heart warmingly.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{incredible. i will need proof...}
<A>__{on his feet again, he slinks quietly back toward christmastown.}
