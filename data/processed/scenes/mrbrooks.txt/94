<A>__{everyone is in the living room. jane is on a couch flanked by her mother and a lawyer. standing behind them is a heavyset lawyer and a young lawyer. we've never seen any of these men before. facing this group from the opposite couch are the two detectives. there are two tape recorders on the coffee table. mr. brooks is in a chair off to one side watching everything. for him the conversation is merely a burble of voices. he studies his daughter while she answers a question. she is unaware of his scrutiny. and finally all he can see are her lips moving. even the burble has faded to silence.}
