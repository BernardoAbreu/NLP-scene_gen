<L>__{interior carnegie hall day}
<A>__{close on the ceiling of carnegie hall, revolving slowly. pull back to reveal this is roberta's pov she stands on the empty stage, gazing at the ceiling as she slowly turns around. she's holding her violin case. she looks at the upper balconies the lower balconies the orchestra seats. her footsteps echo as she walks towards the front of the stage, then stops.}
<B>__{close on roberta}
<A>__{we can see her imagining the audience on the night of the concert. she can't believe her eyes. a beat, and she looks around to make sure she's alone. she takes out her violin, takes a deep breath as she looks out towards her "audience," then starts to play the second violin part of the bach double concerto. suddenly, there's the sound of a stage door opening. roberta stops.}
<C>__{male voice }
<D>__{incredible sound in this room, no?}
<A>__{roberta turns to see isaac stern approaching her. she's completely flustered.}

<D>__{would you believe in 1960, they tried to tear this place down? they wanted to replace it with a bright red skyscraper we called it "the red terror."}
<C>__{roberta}
<D>__{you're kidding.}
<C>__{isaac stern}
<D>__{we had to fight like hell, but with a lot of help, we saved carnegie hall.}
