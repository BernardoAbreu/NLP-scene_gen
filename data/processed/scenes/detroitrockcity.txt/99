<A>__{we can hear the priest's voice as jam hurries to beth. they dash out the door.}

<L>__{exterior alley behind cobo hall night}
<A>__{still trapped by the growling, barking pack of dogs, lex searches nervously through the garbage behind him.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{okay, okay, you're pissed off. i can see this. so... maybe what we need... ah ha.}
<A>__{lex holds up a worn out, old frisbee.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{play some frisbee, poochies?}
<A>__{the pack just glares and snarls. he tosses the frisbee over the packs' heads, but the dogs don't even acknowledge it. they just keep barking and growling. meanwhile, an unnoticed dog at the rear of the pack, a mangy basset hound, turns its flat head to see the frisbee land on the ground behind him. his tail starts to wag.}

<P>__{(exasperated)}
<D>__{alright! i give up! i hearby and forthwith defer my destiny to you mutts. i may be an intelligent, upright, walking, homo fucking sapien, but you fleabags are a force of nature. so, i'm just gonna sit here and wait for you to decide. if you let me live, i thank you. if you bite my head off, i will die knowing i did all i could. it's up to you.}
<A>__{lex waits before the growling, snapping canines. suddenly, the basset hound runs up in front of the pack and drops the frisbee at lex's feet. lex looks down at the floppy, wrinkly dog, who wags its tail and pants furiously.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{well, how do you like that?}
<A>__{lex starts to pet the hound, and one by one the rest of the dogs shut up. shocked, lex picks the frisbee up again and throws it. this time the entire pack bolts after the whammo product. lex smiles, watching them fight for it in the air... in slow motion... as the theme from "chariots of fire" begins. the black shepherd finally grabs the frisbee in its mouth and runs back toward lex. it's soon joined by the rest of the pack. that's right about when lex realizes they aren't going to stop.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{whoa! whoa!}
<A>__{the dogs plow into lex full force knocking him into the garbage. they surround him licking his face. lex bursts into unstoppable laughter. pulling himself up, he pets the dogs as they jump around him wagging their tails and panting.}
<C>__{lex}
<P>__{(baby talk)}
<D>__{you sonsofbitches could tickle a guy to death, y'know that? sure you do... sure you do...}
<A>__{lex stops. he hears talking coming from inside the windowless, brick building on the other side of the alley. he steps in front of the pack and puts his fingers to his lips. they obey, quieting instantly. he then tiptoes to a thin crack in the brick wall. the dogs quietly follow. lex puts his eye to the crack and peers in.}
