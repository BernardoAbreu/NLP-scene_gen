<D>__{no. no.}
<A>__{cates' shot narrowly misses rosalie. the bullet smashes into a mirror above billy's head. cates keeps moving closer, gun pointed straight ahead. billy pushes the pistol against rosalie'temple. for the first time, cates hesitates. they face each other across the length of the lobby.}
<B>__{algren}
<A>__{struggles down the remaining steps into the lobby. he still holds his revolver. dares not raise it towards billy and rosalie.}
<B>__{billy bear}

<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{your gun's just like mine.}
<A>__{he's going to kill cates. but first be glances at algren. then, almost casually, shoots him twice with cates' .44. algren staggers back. dead before he hits the floor. cates twists sideways just as ganz fires. the bullet misses. again frizzy starts screaming and struggling. ganz swipes the woman across the head with the gun. her body slumps to the floor. police sirens can be heard in the distance. cates makes an attempt for algren's gun. a bullet splatters against the floor only inches from his outstretched fingers. the gun skitters out of reach.}
<C>__{cates}
<D>__{you lying son of a bitch...}
<C>__{ganz}
<D>__{what are you talking about? we didn't kill her ...}
<A>__{ganz smiles. with your own gun, cop. how does it feel? cates leaps into a wooden phone booth. ganz leisurely blasts away at the booth with both his and cates' gun. two bullets crash into the booth. ganz moves to check inside the booth but sirens are ominously near. ganz finally retreats out the entrance.}
<B>__{street}
<A>__{billy and rosalie weave their way across street to the cougar. they make a u turn. ganz runs out. car pulls out, then the police cars and vans begin to arrive.}
<B>__{phone booth}
<A>__{chunks of wood on the floor. shafts of light through a dozen bullet holes. shattered receiver dangling from a cord. cates, wedged tight into the very top of the cubicle. he drops to the floor.}
<B>__{lobby}
<A>__{the police arrive. swarm into the hotel. all eyes on cates as he rushes to algren. too late... cates realizes algren is dead. he cradles algren's head as he stares at the arriving tac squad and patrolmen.}
