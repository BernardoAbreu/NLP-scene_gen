<A>__{precious sits at a small kitchen table in a modest but cozy and craftily decorated apartment. fresh flowers adorne her table. she breast feeds abdul and drinks from a tall glass of grape juice. ms. rain clears the table of plates and take out containers. whitney houston is playing loud. katherine, a sexy black woman who it seems has just awoken, descends the stairs. she's not in a good mood.}
