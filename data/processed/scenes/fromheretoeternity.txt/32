<L>__{interior captain's office day}
<B>__{medium shot warden and holmes}
<A>__{it is a gloomy, rainy day and the lights are on in the office. warden is at his desk, working. holmes is buckling on his trench coat. he wears a happy smile.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i won't be back in time to take retreat.}
<P>__{(winks at warden)}
<D>__{or reveille either, probably.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(strides back and forth; jovially)}
<D>__{all work and no play, sergeant. all you do is sit around sweating over this paper and that. there are other things in this world beside work.}

<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(bending over, tying shoelace)}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{you ought to get out more yourself, warden.}
<A>__{warden is looking directly at the picture of karen on holmes' desk.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{i've been considering it.}
<A>__{he turns aside as holmes straightens up.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{well, i'm going.}
<A>__{he claps warden on the back fraternally.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i'm leaving it in your care, sergeant.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{it'll be here when you get back.}
<A>__{holmes goes out. warden turns back to holmes' desk. he is still holding the papers in one hand. he looks at karen's picture, picks it up with his other hand, squints at it, considering the chances very, very carefully.}
