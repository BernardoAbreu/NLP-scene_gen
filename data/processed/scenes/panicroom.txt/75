<L>__{interior living room night}
<A>__{burnham, raoul, and junior are standing in the half darkened living room, in the middle of their argument, when a voice booms around them.}
<C>__{meg }
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{they practically jump out of their shoes, looking around for the source of the voice.}
<C>__{meg }
<D>__{the police are on their way.}
<A>__{only burnham has remained relatively calm. after he gets over the initial shock, he walks toward the tiny camera that's hidden in an upper corner of the living room wall and stares up at it. raoul, who has taken off his ski mask, is careful to move out of the camera's range, and turn his back to it.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{i suggest you leave.}
<A>__{on the monitors, burnham looks up at the camera and shakes his head, wagging a finger from side to side. he raises a hand, makes a gesture like a telephone, then wags his finger again. the message is clear you don't have a phone. in the panic room, meg is puzzled.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{how'd he know that?}
<A>__{she presses the talk button again.}
<C>__{meg}
<P>__{(into speaker)}
<D>__{take what you want and get out.}
<A>__{that sounded fairly tough. she looks at the monitor again. on the monitors, the three of them have an urgent, whispered conference, then they all start patting their pockets for some reason, turning in circles, looking for something. in the panic room, meg and sarah watch them, confused. on the monitors, burnham holds up a finger to the camera wait a second while raoul and junior rush off screen, looking for something. junior returns a moment later holding something and the three of them hunch over a box, working on something. after a moment, they break apart and junior steps up to the camera holding a pad of paper. he shows it to the camera. on the top page, in big block letters, they've written.}
<B>__{what we want}
<A>__{after a suitable pause for reading, he turns to the second page, where four more words are written.}
<B>__{is in that room.}
<A>__{in the panic room, sarah gasps, meg sits back.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{"what we want is in that room."}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{they're coming in here, aren't they?}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{no, i told you, they can't. it's not a possibility.}
<A>__{angry, she sits forward and jabs the talk button.}
<C>__{meg}
<P>__{(into speaker)}
<D>__{what do you know about this room?}
<A>__{on the monitors, there is more frenzied writing, more arguing, and a first draft of a response torn up. finally, junior steps forward with another sign:}
<B>__{more than you.}
<A>__{in the panic room, meg's confidence is ebbing, but she doesn't want to show it. she hits the talk button again.}
<C>__{meg}
<P>__{(into speaker)}
<D>__{we're not coming out. we're not letting you in. get out of my house.}
<P>__{(clicks off)}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{say fuck.}
<C>__{meg}
<P>__{(into speaker)}
<D>__{fuck.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{"get the fuck out of my house."}
<C>__{meg}
<P>__{(into speaker)}
<D>__{get the fuck out of my house!}
<A>__{she clicks off again, looks to sarah for approval, and gets it, sort of, in sarah's half smile. but sarah's eyes go back to the screen.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{answer.}
<A>__{meg follows sarah's eyes back to the screen, where another message is being held up for them. on the monitors, the notepad says:}
<B>__{we will let you go.}
<A>__{in the panic room, meg and sarah speak at the same time.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{oh, please.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{give me a break.}
