<A>__{welles' car moves in the slow flow of traffic into mid town.}
<L>__{interior welles' car continuous}
<A>__{welles is at the wheel. longdale is in the passenger seat, gun held in his lap.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{you were the middleman, am i right? old man christian wasn't about to go shopping for a snuff film himself.}
<C>__{longdale}
<D>__{wouldn't exactly have been possible for a man of his stature.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{so, he sent you, gave you the money, his errand boy. and if you refused, it wasn't like you could tell anyone your pervert boss just asked you to get him a snuff film. that's the beauty of lawyer client privilege.}
<C>__{longdale}
<D>__{that's trust. mr. christian trusted me implicitly.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{must have paid you a lot, for you to risk everything. would've had to have cut yourself a real nice piece of money.}
<C>__{longdale}
<D>__{i was well compensated.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{that's why you got scared when mrs. christian hired me. you knew about the film, figured it had to be in that safe. how'd you find me?}
<C>__{longdale}
<D>__{never mind how i found you.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{followed me... must have freaked out when you saw me closing in on your buddies...}
<C>__{longdale}
<D>__{they're no friends of mine.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{except, you're willing commit murder with them.}
<C>__{longdale}
<D>__{none of this would be happening if you would have left it alone. if you weren't digging up a girl who died six years ago. a girl no one even remembers.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{mary anne mathews, that was her name. her mom remembers her.}
<A>__{welles looks at longdale.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{you found these smut dealers and asked to buy a snuff film, right? wanted them to find you one. well, they didn't find}
<A>__{you one, longdale,}
<D>__{they went out and made}
<A>__{you one...}
<C>__{longdale}
<D>__{shut up.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{mary anne mathews was alive till you paid money to have her murdered.}
<C>__{longdale}
<D>__{shut your mouth and drive!}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{did it get him off, huh, watching them cut her up? tell me, because i really want to understand. did he jerk off to it? you watch it with him, sit there giving him a handjob while you both watched... ?}
<A>__{longdale jams the gun against welles' side.}
<C>__{longdale}
<D>__{you're making me very angry.}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{just tell me. tell me some more of the secrets you and christian shared. what kind of degenerate pervert was he really? what the fuck did he want with a snuff film?}
<C>__{longdale}
<D>__{you're asking me why?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{i'm asking.}
<A>__{longdale sits back, wipes sweat from his face.}
<C>__{longdale}
<D>__{a man like mr. christian, a great man... all his money, all his power... a man who attained everything there was to attain...}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{why did he buy a film of some poor, lost girl getting butchered?}
<C>__{longdale}
<D>__{isn't it incredibly obvious?}
<C>__{welles}
<D>__{enlighten me.}
<C>__{longdale}
<D>__{because he could. he did it because he could.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{what other reason were you looking for?}
<A>__{welles tightens his grip on the wheel, numbed.}
