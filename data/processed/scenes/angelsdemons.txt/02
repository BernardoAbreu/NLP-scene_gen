<L>__{int cern detector room day}
<A>__{ a ring as ornate in its way as the ring of the fisherman, except this one is a mass of technological sophistication. it's twenty five feet across, covered with wires, sensors, gizmos. it's the centerpiece of a massive laboratory the size of a football field. scientists and technicians read off checklists in a variety of languages, none of them english so far. the place is a hive of activity and sound; cooling water whooshes through pipes, the static hum of high levels of current floats in the air. vittoria vetra, an intense woman in her mid thirties with the long stride of an impatient person, makes her way across the floor to phillipe, the project manager, a frenchman around fifty. she follows him as he climbs down a scaffolding that surrounds the detector wheel and heads toward a console across the room.}

<D>__{waste of power, what're you extracting, still ten to the seventh aps a second? how long to produce a gram at that rate?}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{about two billion years. at that rate.}
<A>__{he looks at her sideways, didn't like the sound of that. he hits a few last keystrokes and a series of flashing lights reconnect what looks like a lower laboratory complex to the main grid. she nods her thanks and starts to go.}
