<L>__{interior tunnel night}
<A>__{roadie leads the way and glares at the opposite end. the tunnel slightly curves, so he can't see the whole way down.}
<C>__{roadie}
<D>__{hold up. you hear something?}
<A>__{a scratching sound is heard from above.}
<C>__{roadie}
<D>__{they're trying to burrow through the tunnel walls.}
<C>__{heroine}
<D>__{move.}
<A>__{the scratching sound increases, now heard from the far end of the tunnel as well.}
<C>__{coach}
<D>__{like moles these things.}
<A>__{then, sister beast #1 drops into the tunnel from the far end. she charges. at the last second, roadie spots her.}
<C>__{roadie}
<D>__{duck!}
<A>__{roadie and coach duck into the water, but heroine is unable to avoid a thrust that knocks her back ten yards. sister beast #1 lands and turns, surveying her prey. roadie aims his water dripping gun, but heroine rises and blocks his shot.}
<C>__{roadie}
<D>__{stay down!}
<A>__{from her knees, heroine fires. blam blam blam! the three shots push sister beast #1 backwards. heroine rises, covered in muddy water and bleeding from a cut across the face.}
<C>__{heroine}
<D>__{go! the bitch is mine!}
<A>__{roadie and coach reluctantly turn, leaving heroine to fend with the beast. heroine charges. hissing, sister beast #1 charges as well. heroine pumps and fires. boom! sister beast spins, avoiding the shot. now too close, heroine jams the beast in the mouth with the gun, knocking her back. sister beast #1 responds with a swipe and chomp on the arm. heroine bats her away. sister beast #1 moves to the others.}
<C>__{heroine}
<D>__{look out!}
<A>__{roadie and coach sprint until sister beast #2 bursts through the tunnel walls, stopping roadie and coach in their tracks. roadie fires his weapon, but it sparks and fizzles.}
<C>__{roadie}
<D>__{the shells are wet!}
<A>__{with the two beasts closing in. the men are trapped. coach looks around, seeing a plan.}
<C>__{coach}
<D>__{grab onto ceiling and get out of water!}
<C>__{roadie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{coach}
<D>__{do it!!!}
<A>__{grabbing onto the piping along the ceiling, roadie pulls himself from the water. coach uses the machete to cut a power cord from above. he grabs the exposed, sparking end.}
<C>__{coach}
<P>__{(to heroine)}
<D>__{get out of water!!!}
<A>__{heroine sees what he's doing, sprints back the way they came. as the two beasts charge, coach pulls himself out of the water by holding onto the above piping. he's forced to wait for heroine to get out of the water. the second she does, he jams the cord into the water. zap! the conductive water sizzles. sister beast #1 and sister beast #2 lock up and crash. electrocution. sparks and smoke rises from their cooked bodies. roadie and coach look to each other, victorious. they begin shimmying along the piping to the end of the tunnel.}
