<L>__{exterior police pound night}
<A>__{catherine and james stand at the gatehouse of the police pound, collecting the gate key from the mustachioed, sharp eyed young officer there. they then walk down the lines of seized and abandoned vehicles. the pound is in darkness, lit only by the street lights reflected in the dented chromium. they soon find vaughan's crashed lincoln, massive and charismatic even here, even in death. james manages to wrench open the passenger side rear door enough to allow them both to get inside.}
