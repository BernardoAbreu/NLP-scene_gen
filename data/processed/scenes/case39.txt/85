<L>__{interior conference room night}
<A>__{doug sits opposite lucy at the table, keeps it easygoing despite what he's just been told.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{so how's school?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{fine.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{any of your classmates giving you a hard time?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{no, they've been nice.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{sleeping okay?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{that's not really what you want to talk about, is it, doug?}
<A>__{awkward pause. awkward smile.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{you got me.}
<A>__{opens his file. takes out her cognitive assessment profile. lays it flat on the table.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{question 16a, are you afraid of the dark? you answered `no'. question 16b, are you afraid of being alone? `no'. 16c, are afraid of your parents? `no'. you answered `no' to everything in that section. i think some of those should have been yesses. everybody is afraid of something. working through our fears, conquering them, is how we get better. so i want you to tell me... what scares you?}
<A>__{lucy steeples her fingers and rests her chin on top, regards doug with a look of frank appraisal. it is the face of a child, but behind those eyes there is a keen intelligence.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i will tell you what scares me if you tell me what scares you.}
<A>__{doug did not see this coming.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{fair enough. when i was twelve i was climbing a tree and i accidentally put my hand through a giant hornets' nest. they didn't like it. i got stung over a hundred times. they had to rush me to the hospital. i've been afraid of hornets ever since. don't climb many trees either.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{everybody has fears. now, what scares you?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{me.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{you scare yourself?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{sometimes.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{why, what about yourself scares you?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{i have bad thoughts.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{people.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{people in general or certain people?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{certain people.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{like who?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{you.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{you have bad thoughts about me?}
<P>__{(she nods)}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{lucy}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{i just do.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{was there something i said or did that upset you?}
<C>__{lucy}
<P>__{(shakes her head)}
<D>__{it's just the way you are...}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{how am i?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{facile.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{facile?}
<P>__{(she nods yes)}
<D>__{do you even know what that means?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{easily comprehended. often lacking sincerity or depth. you're smug, too. want me to tell you what that means?}
<A>__{dead silence. doug skewered by a ten year old. a boyish shyness emerges, a relic from his own youth.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{well, if, um, if i seemed `smug' or `facile' i want to }
<C>__{lucy}
<P>__{(girlish laugh)}
<D>__{don't apologize.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{you're a grown up, it's embarrassing.}
<P>__{(then; deadpan)}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{should we talk about school now? my grades are getting a lot better.}
<A>__{doug just stares at her.}
