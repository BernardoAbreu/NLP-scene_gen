<A>__{danny and toulour. a waiter brings them coffee, danny spoons in a lot of sugar, then stirs.}
<C>__{toulour}
<D>__{i don't usually call for a second date. for you i make an exception.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{toulour}
<D>__{i think it's good that we talk. you see, you should stop following me. you're wasting your time. i'm going to let you go first and get caught. then they will increase the security even more, and then i will steal the egg. then lemarc can make his decision.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you sound confident.}
<C>__{toulour}
<D>__{confident? this is a very american word. i am arrogant. there's a difference.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{doesn't matter if you're that good. are you that good?}
<C>__{toulour}
<D>__{i can move objects with my mind.}
<A>__{danny just looks at him.}
<C>__{toulour}
<D>__{you don't believe it?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{do you?}
<C>__{toulour}
<D>__{are you done stirring your sugar?}

<D>__{danny. i'm serious. sit down, please.}
<A>__{danny site down and looks at him.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{you're telekinetic, is that what you're telling me?}
<C>__{toulour}
<D>__{yes. but...it's a curse. a nightmare. everything is too easy. but then lemarc says i'm still not the best. so i take his challenge. and you will fail, and i will win, and so what? what does it prove? what is he trying to show me?}
<A>__{danny just looks at him.}
