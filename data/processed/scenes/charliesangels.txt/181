<L>__{interior luxury boxes night}
<A>__{alex bursts in. it's a crowd of fifteen cocktail drinking}
<B>__{business men.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{charles townsend? anybody, charles townsend?}
<A>__{she ducks back into the hallway.}
<L>__{interior hallway continuous}
<A>__{alex walks out into the hallway, frustrated. then, miraculously, she spots him...}
<B>__{knox.}
<A>__{he walks out of one of the luxury boxes, holding a large, metal briefcase. he heads for the elevator.}
<B>__{alex}
<A>__{immediately goes to intercept him, but...}
<C>__{thin man }
<D>__{don't move.}
<A>__{charlie's angels 8 18 99 it's the thin man, standing behind her, with a gun in her back.}
<C>__{thin man }
<D>__{you move, you say anything, i perforate you. got it?}
<A>__{knox glances back at the thin man, nods to him. then he gets in the elevator. the thin man starts edging alex towards some emergency exit doors, gun still in her back. alex is trying to think of an escape, quickly. she knows that the second he gets her out of this public space, he's gonna shoot her. the door gets closer and closer...}
<C>__{jason }
<D>__{alex?! jesus, what is going on?}
<A>__{the thin man and alex turn around to face jason, who is sweaty and exasperated from chasing her.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{jason, hi, i...}
<A>__{the thin man digs the gun deeper into her back.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{can i talk to you later?}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{no you can talk to me now. i want to know what the hell is going on. first, you disappear with no explanation, not even a goodbye.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i...}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{now, i see you here, but you're with some other guy.}
<C>__{thin man}
<D>__{hey, movie star, do yourself a favor and get lost.}
<A>__{jason double takes. he's not used to someone talking to him like that.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{lemme guess. you must be charlie?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{jason, please...}
<A>__{charlie's angels 8 18 99}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{no, no i'm sick of this shit. i'm sick of this asshole telling you what you can and can't do.}
<A>__{and then, with no warning, he hauls off and punches the thin man. now, jason's just an actor, not an ass kicking super detective, so his punch isn't all that great. in fact, it leaves jason shaking his hand in pain. the thin man, a trickle of blood running from his lip, smiles.}
<C>__{thin man}
<D>__{that was stupid.}
<A>__{first, he pops jason right in the jaw. jason stumbles backward, dazed. then he reaches for his gun, in the process, loosening his grip on alex...}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{jason, get down!}
<A>__{alex spins out of the thin man's grasp and does a full roundhouse kick, knocking the gun out of the thin man's hands. the thin man immediately responds, throwing two quick punches, which alex expertly blocks and then follows with a hitch kick to the chin. jason, dazed and confused, thinks he must be hallucinating.}
<C>__{jason}
<D>__{what the hell is going on?}
<A>__{what's going on is a world class ass kicking, courtesy of his girlfriend. while the action star watches in amazement, alex unloads an arsenal of bad ass kung fu moves that would make jet li green with envy. the thin man doesn't stand a chance. a flying side kick sends him stumbling backwards into the stairwell. we follow the fight...}
