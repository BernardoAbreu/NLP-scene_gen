<A>__{we're seeing a flashback of the night needy slaughtered jennifer. needy plunging through the window. jennifer thrashing. the blood. the struggle. the levitation. the arrival of the police.}
<C>__{needy v.o.}
<D>__{even in her last moments of life, she somehow managed to be cooler than me.}
<A>__{we see, for a moment, jennifer's sly, challenging smile as needy raises the boxcutter to slash her. that signature look of mastery and control.}
<C>__{needy}
<D>__{she left an insanely hot corpse.}
<A>__{we see jennifer's mother holding her again, screaming, though all we hear is silence and static. sure enough, jennifer's bleeding body seems to be artfully, sensually draped in her mother's arms. she almost seems to be smirking at us.}
