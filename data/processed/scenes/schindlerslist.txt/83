<A>__{the galloping horses break through to a clearing high on a hill. the riders pull in the reins and the hoofs rip at the earth. schindler smiles at the view, the beauty of it with the sun just coming up. from here, all of cracow can be seen in striking relief, like a model of a town. he can see the vistula, the river that separates the ghetto from kazimierz; wawel castle, from where the national socialist party's hans frank rules the government general of poland; beyond it, the center of town. he begins to notice refinements: the walls that define the ghetto; peace square, the assembly of men and boys. he notices a line of trucks rolling east across the kosciuscko bridge, and another across the bridge at podgorze, a third along zablocie street, all angling in on the ghetto like spokes to a hub.}
