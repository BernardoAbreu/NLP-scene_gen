<C>__{skipper}
<D>__{would you allow me?}
<A>__{she's sixteen again. there's something about him that still makes her blush. skipper leads her to the dance floor. he hesitates, looking deeply into her eyes. as they begin to dance, the boys notice and exchange looks. lawford and george sit across the quad, sipping punch and smoking cigars.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{if i didn't know better i'd say the old man was acting almost halfway human.}
<C>__{lawford}
<D>__{he is halfway human.}
<A>__{one by one the couples clear for the skipper and his bride. they glide, lost in each others arms. they dance a dance for the ages. as if it might be for the last time. the music swells.}
