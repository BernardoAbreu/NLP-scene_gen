<L>__{exterior neighborhood day semi long shot}
<A>__{we see the man who left his apartment in anger come out of the doorway into the backyard. he is easy to identify through the color of his garish necktie. in one hand the man carries a small garden hoe and rake, and in the other a pair of trimming shears. he goes to a small patch of flowers, perhaps three feet square. they are beautiful, multi colored three foot high zinnias. he kneels down, inspects them, touches them affectionately and with some pride. his anger seems to have left him, replaced by the kind of peace that flowers bring many people. he stands up, carefully hoes the ground, them rakes it. then he snips a few leaves off the lower parts of the plant. finally, he waters them.}
