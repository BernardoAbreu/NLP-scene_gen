<L>__{exterior fence corridor day}
<A>__{we are looking up at rows and rows of fences topped with barbed wire all designed to create a separator for the thousands of jew who pour through each day. then we see the eyes themselves that look up at them. a little boy. a boy who will not die this day. a boy who will live to see the end of the war and the world of the future. he stares at the metal wire with an unusual fascination. the boy looks up at his worried parents a sturdy looking couple who try to smile and comfort him. the corridor comes to a junction where it splits in several different directions. soldiers here push the mob using rifles as pikes, screaming and terrorizing the lot of them. suddenly it is clear what they are doing. they are dividing the mob into smaller groups. soon, the groups themselves become evident. men from women. children from adults. the family tries to stay together, clinging to one another dearly, until finally, they are put upon by a number of gray uniforms and pulled apart. the boy is dragged screaming his feet no longer touching the ground. two soldiers carry him as they follow the back of a large column of children being led through a gate of barbed wire so dense, it resembles wool. the gate closes and the boy looks back to see his parents along with many others being restrained by a number of soldiers. the screaming is deafening. and the boy's can be heard above it all. the soldiers seem to be having a hard time carrying such a frail child. the farther they get from the fence, the heavier he seems to get, until they are literally pulling him as though he were anchored to something. his outstretched fingers claw at the thin air and he screams until the blood in his face is blue. the soldiers are literally pulled back a step and they begin to slip in the mud. they look at one another and then over their shoulders as they hear a sound. a groaning, creaking sound. and then the unmistakable twang of wire stretched to snapping.}
