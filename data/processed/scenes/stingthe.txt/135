<L>__{interior the store}
<A>__{as lonnegan enters, we see the room for the first time in its entirety. overnight it has been transformed into a swank private club, with bar, cigarette girls, upholstered furniture and chandeliers.}
<C>__{singleton}
<D>__{look at that. he's got four apes with him.}
<C>__{gondorff}
<D>__{that's what i like about these guys, j.j... they always got protection against things we'd never do to 'em.}
<A>__{everywhere there is activity. a bank of telephones buzzes incessantly. sheet writers scurry from phone to phone, taking bets of tremendous size from prominent people.}
<C>__{sheet writer}
<D>__{yes, mr. ruth, 20,000 on dancing cloud.}
<A>__{we reveal that the phones are controlled by a master switch, which one of the recruited con men operates from behind a partition. the boardmaker, wearing headphones suspended from a sliding wire, hurriedly chalks up races and odds on a huge blackboard. from the loudspeakers we hear the words "last flash." the odds on bluenote settle down to 8 to 1. lonnegan makes his way through the throng toward the betting line. his bodyguards fan out to various positions in the room. the betting crowd itself (known as the "boost") consists of close to twenty people, none of whom, of course are what they're pretending to be. there are brokers with pasty faces, sportsmen, tanned and casual, and financiers with goatees and highly tailored clothes. large amounts of money are changing hands at the betting window. boodles are in sight everywhere. lonnegan slips into the betting line, feeling somewhat estranged from the general merriment around him. there are two men in line ahead of him. the first, curly jackson, slaps down several bundles of cash in front of niles, who's the cashier, and places a $20,000 bet on war eagle. gondorff appears at the cashier's window and catches sight of lonnegan.}
<C>__{gondorff}
<D>__{never get enough, huh pal? i'd think you'd get tired of losin', honnigan.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<P>__{(piercingly)}
<D>__{the name is lonnegan.}
<C>__{gondorff}
<P>__{(to niles)}
<D>__{make sure you see cash from this guy, eddie. he's got the name for bettin' money he don't have.}
<A>__{the man in front of lonnegan puts $5,000 on dancing cloud. he makes the bet on credit. lonnegan steps to the window.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{two thousand on bluenote.}
<C>__{niles}
<P>__{(writing out a ticket)}
<D>__{is that all?}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<P>__{(pissed)}
<D>__{that's all.}
<A>__{bluenote's race is now up on the board. the race caller comes on the loudspeaker.}
<C>__{caller}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen. this is arnold rowe, your caller for the second race at belmont in new york. a mile and 1 8. four year olds and up. and they're off!}
<A>__{we see that the caller is singleton, and that he's calling the race from a concealed booth next to the cashier's cage.}
<C>__{caller}
<D>__{around the first turn it's a war eagle first by a length, jail bate second by one and a half, dancing cloud third by a half on the outside, followed by lucky lady, mojo, wits' end and bluenote.}
<A>__{lonnegan goes to the bar, orders a drink, and settles down at one of the tables. it happens to be the one the eirie kid is at. gondorff and niles watch it from the cashier's cage.}
<C>__{gondorff}
<P>__{(worried)}
<D>__{that's not where we want him to sit.}
<A>__{eirie tries to ignore lonnegan at first, but realizes he better make some conversation.}
<C>__{eirie kid}
<D>__{c'mon war eagle.}
<P>__{(to lonnegan)}
<D>__{that dancing cloud's a hell of a finisher. war eagle's gonna have to open up a little more on 'em.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<D>__{you know anything about a horse named bluenote?}
<C>__{eirie kid}
<D>__{naw, he's never done much. probably in here just to round out the field. war eagle's where you wanna have your money.}
<A>__{eirie excuses himself and heads for the bar.}
<C>__{caller}
<D>__{into the clubhouse turn, it's war eagle by two lengths, dancing cloud has moved up to second by a half, lucky lady is third by three followed by jail bait, mojo, bluenote and wits' end.}
<A>__{the heretofore chaotic energy of the parlor is now focused on the race. several of the patrons begin to yell for their horses. lonnegan remains seated. he seems bored with it all. hooker comes over to clear some empty glasses from his table.}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<P>__{(out of the corner of his mouth)}
<D>__{you really picked a winner, kid.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{give 'em a little time.}
<C>__{caller}
<D>__{into the backstretch it's war eagle still by a length, dancing cloud closing on the inside, is second by two, lucky lady is third by one and a half, followed by bluenote, jail bait, wits' end and mojo.}
<A>__{lonnegan perks up just a little. bluenote, at least, has moved up. the rest of the people in the place are really rooting now. few of them remain seated. hooker arrives at the bar, with the glasses he cleared from lonnegan's table. eirie is already there, fortifying himself with a scotch.}
<C>__{hooker}
<D>__{you're doin' great, eirie. he loves ya.}
<A>__{eirie nods, somewhat unconvinced, and heads bak to the table.}
<C>__{caller}
<D>__{into the far turn, it's dancing cloud now by half a length, war eagle is second by two, bluenote is third by a half and moving fast on the outside. lucky lady is fourth by four lengths, followed by jail bait, wits' end and mojo.}
<A>__{lonnegan is getting more intent now.}
<C>__{caller}
<D>__{coming down the stretch, it's dancing cloud by one length, war eagle and bluenote are neck and neck by two. now it's dancing cloud, bluenote and war eagle.}
<P>__{(shouting now)}
<D>__{dancing cloud and bluenote head to head...}
<A>__{the place is going crazy. even singleton is standing up to get the necessary excitement in his voice.}
<C>__{caller}
<D>__{dancing cloud, bluenote. dancing cloud, bluenote. it's bluenote by a nose. dancing cloud is second by two, war eagle third by three and a half. time for a mile and 1 8, 2:01 and 6 10 seconds.}
<A>__{most of the patrons collapse into their chairs like spent lovers. eirie slams his racing form to the floor. nobody had bluenote.}
<C>__{curly}
<P>__{(tearing up his ticket)}
<D>__{bloody awful. who in blazes is bluenote?}
<C>__{lonnegan}
<P>__{(to eirie, very self satisfied)}
<D>__{war eagle's where you want to have your money, huh?}
<A>__{eirie doesn't reply. he can't believe bluenote won. lonnegan looks to hooker. hooker gives him a wink. for the first time, lonnegan permits a smile.}
