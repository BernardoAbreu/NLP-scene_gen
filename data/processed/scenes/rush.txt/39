<A>__{clay regazzoni emerges from testing his car. still amazed by the improved performance. talking to his mechanics. in awe. he removes his helmet, then stops. in the distance he sees niki talking to agnes the attractive track manager. they are clearly hitting it off..}

<A>__{niki is in the showers, then getting changed for his date with agnes. he is about to go, when he stops, and sees... clay regazzoni getting undressed, looking at niki. clay speaks english with an italian accent..}
<C>__{regazzoni}
<D>__{i know what you're going to say. that it's none of my business...}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{regazzoni}
<D>__{if it's the track manager you're taking on your date tonight?}
<A>__{niki immediately becomes defensive...}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{it's none of your business.}
<C>__{regazzoni}
<D>__{okay, but if you want my advice...i'd let this one go. i'm not questioning your taste. she's a great girl.}
<C>__{regazzoni }
<D>__{but agnes's last boyfriend was a british formula 2 driver, who has a reputation for two things. for being a suicidal jerk on the track, and for going all night, and all day afterwards...and all night again in bed. he's an ok driver, but an immortal fuck, apparently. i don't know about you, but that's not an act i'd like to follow.}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{but if that doesn't bother you...}
<C>__{niki}
<D>__{what's his name? the driver?}
<C>__{regazzoni}
<D>__{hunt. james hunt.}
<A>__{niki stares. can hardly believe it.}
<C>__{regazzoni}
<D>__{see? you share information, i share information.}
<A>__{clay slaps niki on his back, and goes into the showers..}
<C>__{regazzoni}
<D>__{that's what team mates are for.}
<C>__{niki}
<P>__{(quiet defeated)}
