<L>__{exterior pier night}
<A>__{chuck and bregitta, are at the end of the pier, a full moon hangs above the horizon. bregitta doesn't understand what chuck is saying, but it's clear she's enjoying him.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i can't remember feeling like this about myself, a place, someone like you. we've come such a long way, seen so much. but nothing like this.}
<A>__{bregitta smiles and takes chuck's hand. he's nervous.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{i'm not the best at expressing myself. maybe the only reason i can now is because i know you don't understand me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i like you so much. too much. but how could i? i mean, if we can't even communicate, how could i know you? it's confusing. we sail in an hour and i will never see you again.}
<A>__{bregitta takes chuck's face gently and kisses him tenderly. then, in perfect english...}
<C>__{bregitta}
<D>__{i like you, too.}
<A>__{chuck's eyes widen, astonished. bregitta smiles, takes chuck by the hand, and leads him to a small covered boat moored to the pier.}
<C>__{bregitta}
<D>__{come on. we don't have much time.}
<A>__{blushing deeply, chuck follows her into the boat.}
