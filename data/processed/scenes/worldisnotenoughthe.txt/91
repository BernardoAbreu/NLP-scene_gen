<L>__{exterior forest}
<A>__{he makes it to the woods, finding cover in the trees, whipping in and out of sight as paraski #1 tries to follow, sinking lower and lower until... his skids catch on some over hanging branches...the paraski is catapulted into a tree and explodes...}
<L>__{exterior woods continuous}
<A>__{coming in to pick up the pursuit of bond is paraski #2, firing down at bond, dropping bombs which explode just behind him in the snow. the other two paraskis land and eject their chutes, now racing through the woods on the ground. bond looks behind him, sees them gaining...he zigzags through the trees and suckers paraski #3 to glance off one tree, hit another and wipe out behind. but the remaining predator on the ground, paraski #4, is gaining on him...bond bursts out of the trees and finds himself heading toward...}
<B>__{the edge of a precipice...}
<A>__{he cranks himself right, narrowly avoiding a tumble over the edge. paraski #4 isn't so lucky and sails off the cliff to a hundred and fifty foot drop.}
<C>__{bond}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{should have stuck to snowboarding.}
<A>__{but the smile is wiped off his face as...an emergency parachute deploys from the back... the paraski does a climbing turn and heads straight back for him... bond skis for his life, away from paraski #4 when paraski #2 appears in front of him...guns blazing... one ahead and one behind, bond turns back...he has nowhere to go but...}
<B>__{over the edge}
<A>__{he sails through the air and lands on the paraski #4, slashing the parachute with his ski pole before bouncing off and doing an amazing tumbling hundred foot fall to the snow, where he lands on his skis... paraski four, the chute tangling in the rotors of its propeller, struggles to maintain control, his vehicle inexorably hurtling toward paraski #2: both of them having set their course for bond, they are now on a collision course with each other...}
<B>__{in the gully below}
<A>__{bond meets up with elektra as above them... the two paraskis collide, crashing into the snowy hill above and tumbling down, end over end. bond and elektra huddle together as shards and debris rain down on them. then...silence. an eerie silence.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{are they gone? all of them?}
<A>__{bond nods, ripping from his pole a piece of the parachute he slashed and wiping his face with it...he looks at the piece of fabric in his hand. he sees: cyrillic letters...undecipherable to us...but there is a look on his face, a look of recognition as... an earth rattling rumble grows above them. bond stuffs the parachute fragment in his ski suit as he turns... the exploding paraskis have triggered an avalanche on the slope above.}
