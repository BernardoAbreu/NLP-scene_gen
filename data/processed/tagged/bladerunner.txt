<B>__{the eye}
<A>__{it's magnified and deeply revealed. flecks of green and yellow in a field of milky blue. icy filaments surround the undulating center. the eye is brown in a tiny screen. on the metallic surface below, the words voight kampff are finely etched. there's a touch light panel across the top and on the side of the screen, a dial that registers fluctuations of the iris. the instrument is no bigger than a music box and sits on a table between two men. the man talking is big, looks like an over stuffed kid. "leon" it says on his breast pocket. he's dressed in a warehouseman's uniform and his pudgy hands are folded expectantly in his lap. despite the obvious heat, he looks very cool. the man facing him is lean, hollow cheeked and dressed in gray. detached and efficient, he looks like a cop or an accountant. his name is holden and he's all business, except for the sweat on his face. the room is large and humid. rows of salvaged junk are stacked neatly against the walls. two large fans whir above their heads.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{okay if i talk?}
<A>__{holden doesn't answer. he's centering leon's eye on the machine.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i kinda get nervous when i take tests.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{don't move.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{he tries not to move but finally his lips can't help a sheepish smile.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{already had i.q. test this year but i don't think i never had a...}
<C>__{holden}
<P>__{(cutting in)}
<D>__{reaction time is a factor in this, so please pay attention. answer quickly as you can.}
<A>__{leon compresses his lips and nods his big head eagerly. holden's voice is cold, geared to intimidate and evoke response.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{you're in a desert, walking along in the sand when all of a sudden you look down and see a...}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{what one?}
<A>__{it was a timid interruption, hardly audible.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{what desert?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{doesn't make any difference what desert it's completely hypothetical.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{but how come i'd be there?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{maybe you're fed up, maybe you want to be by yourself who knows. so you look down and see a tortoise. it's crawling towards you...}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{a tortoise. what's that?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{know what a turtle is?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{same thing.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i never seen a turtle.}
<A>__{he sees holden's patience is wearing thin.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{but i understand what you mean.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{you reach down and flip the tortoise over on its back, leon.}
<A>__{keeping an eye on his subject, holden notes the dials in the voight kampff. one of the needles quivers slightly.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{you make these questions, mr. holden, or they write 'em down for you?}
<A>__{disregarding the question, holden continues, picking up the pace.}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{the tortoise lays on its back, its belly baking in the hot sun, beating its legs trying to turn itself over. but it can't. not without your help. but you're not helping.}
<A>__{leon's upper lip is quivering.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{whatcha mean, i'm not helping?}
<C>__{holden}
<D>__{i mean you're not helping! why is that, leon?}
<A>__{leon looks shocked, surprised. but the needles in the computer barely move. holden goes for the inside of his coat. but big leon is faster. his laser burns a hole the size of a nickel through holden's stomach. unlike a bullet, a laser causes no impact. it goes through holden's spine and comes out his back, clean as a whistle. like a rag doll he falls back off the bench from the waist up. by the time he hits the floor, big slow leon is already walking away. but he stops, turns and with a little smile of satisfaction, fires at the machine on the table. there's a flash and a puff of smoke. the voight kampff is hit dead center, crippled but not destroyed; as leon walks out of the room, one of its lights begins to blink, faint but steady.}
<L>__{exterior desert night}
<A>__{the horizon marked by a thin copper line that maybe the end, of the beginning of a day. the train that follows, cuts through the night at 400 miles an hour.}
<L>__{interior train night}
<A>__{no clickitty clack of track bound noise, it's a long, insulated pullman of contoured seats and low keyed lighting, coloured to soothe,and empty, except for the passenger half way down. his eyes closed, head rested against the glass. ten years ago, deckard might have been an athlete, a track man or a welter weight. the body looks it, but the face has seen some time not all of it good.}
<L>__{interior train refreshment dispenser night}
<A>__{deckard comes down the aisle, slips a coin into the mechanism, receives a beer and returns to his seat.}
<L>__{interior train night}
<A>__{tired of the program, he takes off the headset and drops it next to three empty beer bottles and a sandwich wrapper, adjusts his position and winds up staring at his reflection in the window. runs a hand over his face, it could use a shave. he leans closer and peers through the glass. out there in the black a sign flashes past: san angeles, three minutes.}
<L>__{exterior platform night}
<A>__{the train slides in, smooth as an eel, and stops with out a sound. carrying a bag and umbrella, deckard disembarks ahead of the other passengers and into the sweltering night.}
<L>__{interior corridor night}
<A>__{deckard has got his coat swung over his shoulder, his shirt already damp, as he walks down the long, hollow passage under orbs of yellow light.}
<L>__{exterior terminal night}
<A>__{deckard unlocks his car and gets in. turns the ig nition and hits a sensor. the dash console glows and deckard sits back waiting for the air unit to cool things off.}
<C>__{deckard }
<D>__{it was 97 degrees in the city and no hope of improvement. not bad if you're a lizard. but two hours earlier i was drinking acquavit with an eskimo lady in north east alaska. that's a tough change to make. it was so good, i didn't want to leave, so i left a day early.}
<A>__{a little detached, deckard taps another sensor on the panel, lights up a cigarette and watches as his mes sages flash across the viewer stating date, time and caller. the last one is repeated five times. deckard sighs, switches off the viewer and gets on the radio.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{contact. this is blade runner one calling com fast 27.}
<A>__{the sound of a chime precedes the mechanical female voice that answers.}
<C>__{voice}

<D>__{where the hell you been?}

<D>__{next time you go on vacation, do me a favor, let us know where it is.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{what's up?}
<C>__{gaff}
<D>__{holden got hit.}
<A>__{there is a pause. that was bad news.}

<D>__{bad?}
<C>__{gaff}
<D>__{severed spine. you'd better get in here. bryant's waiting for you.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i will see you in a minute.}
<A>__{the engine revs, the wipers rake two weeks of dust off the windshield and deckard jams out of the lot.}
<L>__{interior the hall of justice night}
<A>__{an enormous grey vault of a building. a businesslike deckard strides down a long corridor with his brief case and police id pinned to his coat.}
<C>__{deckard }
<D>__{i x 4 p d referred to as a nexus 6, the tyrell corporation's new pride and joy. holden was administering the voight kampff test when one nailed him.}
<A>__{the door in front of deckard slides open and he walks through.}
<C>__{deckard }
<D>__{the nexus 6 must be fast because holden was as quick as they come. the report said there were six of them. three males and three female. led by a combat model called roy batty.}
<L>__{interior inspector bryant's office night}
<A>__{the inspector is in his fifties. the deep creases in his face, the broken capillaries in his nose say brawler, spoiler, drinker, but the diplomas on the wall say something else. bryant's kneeled at his safe trying to open it. deckard it sitting on the edge of the desk reading the print out.}
<C>__{deckard }
<D>__{they escaped from the colonies two weeks ago. killed twenty three people and jumped a shuttle. an aerial patrol found the ship in the desert. no crew.}
<A>__{bryant gets the safe open and brings out a bottle of whiskey.}
<C>__{deckard }
<D>__{bryant's got a liver problem. a couple years back he handed me a bottle and said have a drink for another man. i been drinking for him ever since.}
<A>__{deckard sets down the report and takes the shot bryant just poured for him.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{six, huh?}
<C>__{bryant}
<D>__{five. three nights ago one of them managed to break into the tyrell corporation. killed two guards and got as far as the genetic sector before he got fried going through an electro field.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{what was he after?}
<C>__{bryant}
<D>__{there wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure. but bio chemical data and morphology records of the nexus 6 were reported missing. going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send holden in to run voight kampff tests on the new employees. guess he found himself one.}
<A>__{a grim pause.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{you got a machine on it yet?}
<C>__{bryant}
<D>__{we're using esper a 231 that picked up holden's alarm. its guess is that all five are in the city.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{where do we start?}
<A>__{bryant's back at the safe locking up his bottle.}
<C>__{bryant}
<D>__{the tyrell corporation has a demo model. check it out on the voight kampff. there's a chance the nexus 6 is beyond out ability to detect. if that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{what was the cover on the one that got holden?}
<C>__{bryant}
<D>__{industrial refuse.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{garbage man?}
<A>__{bryant nods.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{did personnel have an address on him?}
<A>__{bryant fishes a piece of paper out of his pocket, copies down a number and hands it over.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i will go take a look.}
<A>__{deckard stands and holds up his drink.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{like a sick boy looking out of the window, bryant watches deckard down the whiskey. deckard puts down the glass and turns to leave.}
<C>__{deckard }
<D>__{the big incentive to emigrate was still free labor. if the public found out that their door prizes might kill them, they might not be so hot to go up there. this was one of the worst one's we had and bryant was worried. he wanted to tell me to be discrete or something. but i didn't give him a chance.}
<L>__{exterior leon's hotel entrance night}
<A>__{an electrical storm is brewing. deckard stands out side the entrance to an old hotel holding an umbrella, as people scuttle into doorways to avoid the sudden downpour.}
<L>__{interior leon's hotel lobby night}
<A>__{a heavy metal maze of cubicles and perilous iron balconies, peopled with rejects from the surface world; mato grosso indians in white man's clothes and other lower echelon welfare recipients. drop city is crowded, cramped and darkly alive. deckard steps out of an elevator and moves through the crowd. a cloud of steam drifts up through a grating as two old men, clad in towels descend a flight of stairs under a neon sign that says bath house. a musty subterranean wind ripples deckard's clothes as he turns into an alcove. he stops in front of a door that says, manager and pushes the buzzer. it's opened by an emphysema victim with an oxygen tank lashed to his hip. deckard flashes his id and speaks some words which are inaudible due to the tuba music down the hall. the man grabs a key from his wall, hands it over and shuts the door.}
<L>__{interior leon's hotel corridor night}
<A>__{the companion ways below deck of a big ship are no more bewildering than the ups and downs and ins and outs of this establishment. but deckard finds the door he's looking for. he pauses a moment, listens, then knocks. he inserts the key and with a hand on his gun opens it.}
<L>__{interior leon's room night}
<A>__{an empty room. a cot and not much else. he steps in and stands quiet as a hunter sensing the signs. for a place surrounded by greasy hovels it is surprisingly clean. spartan in fact. the towel by the spotless basin is perfectly folded. deckard runs two fingers over a shelf. no dust. he looks in the waste basket. wadded up candy wrappers. the bed by the window is neatly made. deckard looks under it, then runs his hands along both sides of the mattress. the closet. there's one suit in it. he pats it down. nothing. a show box on the floor. he stoops, takes out what looks like a pen from his pocket and care fully traces it over the box. assured of its harm lessness, he lifts off the lid. it contains a little stack of photos bound with a rubber band. deckard removes them, goes to the lamp by the balcony window and turns it on. a touching collection of family snapshots. the kind of anonymous stuff sold by the bunch in dusty junk shops. the family dog. junior on the pony squinting in the sun. uncle ben clowning with the kids. the faded polaroid of christmas morning. simple pictures of simple folks celebrating the family bond. a curious collection for the likes of leon and deckard studies them with interest.}
<L>__{exterior street below night}
<A>__{oblivious to the cloudburst, a blue eyed albino stands in the doorway, peddling candy and artificial flowers looking like he'd never been touched by the light of day. leon is standing behind him, staring up at his room, watching deckard at the window. he's still wearing his coveralls, but he looks different. his face is more intent, smarter and angry.}
<L>__{exterior street below night}
<A>__{for one seething moment it looks like leon might mash something, but suddenly he swings away and disappears into the crowd.}
<L>__{interior leon's room night}
<A>__{deckard pockets the pictures and moves away from the window.}
<L>__{exterior alley night}
<A>__{leon's got a neck like a fire hydrant and legs to match, but he's a graceful runner. looks like he could do it for days. and he could. he's put a lot of alley behind him and he's not out of breath.}
<L>__{exterior chinatown night}
<A>__{slowing down he cuts into an opening and comes out onto a narrow street. the asian quarter.}
<L>__{interior chop suey house night}
<A>__{a seamy as well as steamy little place. counter and small tables. old slant eyed enders humped over their fuming bowls jabbering and slurping. the only voice coming out clear is from the big three d tv on the back wall. as the mellow mouthed tv announcer delivers the message, a latin looking beauty in a well fitted maids uniform does a twirl, flashes a beguiling smile and glides out of frame.}
<C>__{announcer's voice}
<D>__{choose from a variety of seventy nine different personality types. each and every one a loyal trouble free companion given to you upon your arrival absolutely free...}

<A>__{the chinese are paying no attention, but the man and the woman seated at the table by the window are. the woman is pretty, a touch of gray in her hair, kind and blue eyed. mary looks like an american dream mom, right out of "father knows best." the man also resembles a tradition: the gym instructor, short cropped hair with the body of a drill sergeant, but the eyes are grey and chilling. roy batty is a presence of force with a lazy, but acute sense of what goes on around him. leon has just come through the door behind them. try ing not to be the bull in a china shop, he approaches their table and kneels . batty doesn't bother to look at him, which amplifies the note of sarcasm in his quiet voice.}

<D>__{enjoy the view.}
<A>__{from the pot on the table, mary pours tea and they sit so quiet and still in this noisy place that they seem almost invisible. the view they're "enjoying" is through the window. outside the neon side in the win dow directly across the street says: hannibal chew,}
<B>__{members.}
<L>__{interior hannibal chew's shop night}
<A>__{chew is a spindly old man of precision, his veiled eyes are shrewd and chinese, but the rest of him looks like a charles dickens invention. he's got a jewelers' glass stuck in his eye, lurched over a lamp, squinting at something in his hand. after a moment his lips peal back into a sour, belligerent smile.}
<C>__{chew}
<D>__{well, you're right. this little honey has a couple of defective cones.}
<A>__{he snaps off the lamp and swings round to face his client. sebastian's face is almost young, but something has gone too far, too fast. premature old age has made his bones brittle and his co ordination slow. the house may be dark but there's a light on in it. se bastian is a closet genius.}
<C>__{chew}
<D>__{you're a regular perfectionist, sebastian.}

<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{it's gotta be right for my customer.}
<C>__{chew}
<D>__{your customer, eh?}
<A>__{chew snickers and beckons. sebastian follows his down a high narrow hall to a heavy insulated door. there's a moth eaten full length fur coat hanging by it. chew tugs it on and they go through. the big door slams shut behind them.}
<L>__{interior cold storage room night}
<A>__{except for the work table with its sharp gleaming in struments, the room is as barren and sterile as a morgue. the glass doored compartments in the walls look like crypts. some of them small as post office boxes. from one of the chew removes a vacuum, packed box. carefully separating the seal, he reaches into the purple jell and with a pair of tweezers extracts an eye. through the jeweler's glass, which he has not bothered to remove, chew holds the eye up to the light and studies it a moment. his other hand searches through his pockets.}
<C>__{chew}
<D>__{you got a pocket charger, boy?}
<A>__{quick to accommodate, sebastian removes a pencil like device from a row of such things in his breast pocket and steps closer. the back of the eye is touched with the pencil and the pupil moves. suddenly its staring back at them.}
<C>__{chew}
<D>__{is that good enough for your customer?}
<A>__{anxious to leave, sebastian nods. chew reseals the eye taking his time. he can afford to, he's wearing his coat.}

<D>__{how much is he paying you?}
<A>__{in place of an answer, sebastian clears his throat, stares at the bag like he didn't hear.}

<A>__{the spinner gently touches down. the hatch drops open and deckard steps out.}
<C>__{deckard }
<D>__{his claim to fame was making a product more human than human and sometimes the 'more' turned out to be a problem. this wasn't just an escaped andy who broke his owner's arm there were twenty eight people dead and the pressure was on.}

<A>__{the guard hands deckard back his i.d., pushed a button and deckard walks away.}
<C>__{deckard }
<D>__{but what's more american than good old supply and demand? the government needed them, industry made them and the church backed them. the big religious boys said that androids, no matter how human, were objects; only god could make people. i'm not religious, but i was inclined to agree. otherwise i'd be out of a job.}

<D>__{a humanoid robot is like any other machine, it can be a benefit or a hazard. if it's a benefit, it's not our problem.}
<C>__{rachael}

<L>__{interior tyrell corporation air filtered corridor day}
<A>__{they pass into a canopied, air filtered corridor. deckard doesn't answer the question because he's looking at the animals. small northern animals in neat "en vironmental" cages. he looks at the rabbit, the raccoon and the squirrel, but the owl asleep on its perch stops him. the armed guard at the exit never takes his eyes off them.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{you like our owl?}
<A>__{deckard nods. rachael claps her hands. the owl opens its yellow eyes and blinks at them.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{it's artificial?}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{of course not.}
<A>__{hands thrust in her pockets, she strides off towards the exit without looking back. the exit is another tube. just big enough for two. no room for excess. he tries to ignore her cool appraising stare.}

<D>__{are you apprehensive?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{why should i be?}

<L>__{interior inner sanctum of dr. tyrell day}
<A>__{the office is dimly lit, but highlights of resilience reside in the luster of the antique furnishings, like glimmers of gold in a darkened mine. dr. tyrell is a fragile man of power, with that look of "youth" obtained from steroids and surgery. dapper and trim, he leans against the desk looking at an old fashioned pocket watch. the only sound is the insidious perking of coffee brewing in the background. tyrell taps a sensor on his desk. the door in front of deckard and rachael slides open. they enter a vestibule and face another door, this one befitting the decor of the office, tyrell slips the watch into his pocket as they enter.}

<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{have you ever retired a human by mistake?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{but in your profession that is a risk.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{nothing is infallible, but so far the voight kampff scale bas been foolproof.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{like you said, mr. deckard, a machine can be a hazard. the voight kampff scale is a machine, isn't it?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{one that relies on human interpretation. where's the subject?}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{sitting next to you.}
<A>__{deckard stares at rachael, then back at tyrell. delighted, tyrell takes a cup of coffee. accepting the challenge, deckard opens his briefcase and starts fishing out the apparatus. the voight kampff rachael's eye fills the screen, the iris brilliant, shot with light, the pupil contracting.}
<C>__{deckard's voice}
<D>__{ready.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{go ahead.}
<A>__{in the soft green glow of the dials, the needles in both gauges are at rest. dr. tyrell stands silhouetted behind deckard, who sits in front of rachael, a pencil beam trained on her eye. wire mesh discs are attached to her cheeks.}

<D>__{you're given a calfskin wallet for your birthday.}
<A>__{the needles in both gauges swing violently past green to red, then subside.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{i wouldn't accept it. also, i'd report the person who gave it to me to the police.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{you have a little boy. he shows you his butterfly collection, plus the killing jar.}
<A>__{again the gauges register, but not so far.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{i'd take him to the doctor.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{you're watching t.v. and suddenly you notice a wasp crawling on your wrist.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{i'd kill it.}
<A>__{both needles go to red. deckard makes a note, takes a sip of coffee and continues.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{in a magazine you come across a full page photo of a nude girl.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{is this testing whether i'm an android or a lesbian?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{you show the picture to your husband. he likes it and hangs it on the wall. the girl is lying on a bearskin rug.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i wouldn't let him.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{i should be enough for him.}
<A>__{deckard frowns, then smiles. his smile looks a little like a grimace or the other way around.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{you become pregnant by a man who runs off with your best friend, and you decide to get an abortion.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{i'd never get an abortion.}

<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{that would be murder, mr. deckard.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{in your opinion.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{it would be my child.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{sounds like you speaks from experience.}
<A>__{he notes the needles. one goes green and the other remains inert.}

<D>__{last question. you're watching an old movie. it shows a banquet in progress, the guests are enjoying raw oysters.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{ugh.}

<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{the entree consists of boiled dog stuffed with rice.}

<D>__{how many questions did it take?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{thirteen.}
<A>__{rachael sits rigidly in her chair, as the ground crumbles around her, her big mermaid eyes locked with tyrell. his voice is quiet and strong, mesmerizing. she's hang ing by a thread. deckard watches with a bas taste in his mouth.}

<D>__{she didn't know?}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{memory implant. she was programmed. but i think she has transcended her conditioning. i think she was beginning to suspect.}

<D>__{how many questions does it usually take, mr. deckard?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{five, maybe six.}

<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{mr. deckard, i think it would be wise to reconsider my offer.}

<L>__{interior room night}
<A>__{a pleasant place of soft light and domestic charm. the young lady in the short dress is vacuuming the rug. her back to the viewer. as she bends over to vacuum beneath the couch, exposing her beautiful ass, an admonishment from a resonant and slightly tired male voice intercedes.}

<D>__{sorry.}

<L>__{exterior woods day}
<A>__{swift, soft clouds overhead. in the cold shine of the icy light,the viewer walks down an aisle of maples and beeches, their clean hard limbs deflecting the frosty light, and underfoot the crisp, blue white snow, melted through in spots, exposing soggy patches of rich brown earth.}

<D>__{come on, stay with the machine.}
<L>__{interior tunnel night}
<A>__{the dusenberg is going faster now, headlights eating up the road. rushing the corners in gut wrenching four wheel drifts. not a pleasant sensation if you don't like roller coasters. the dusenberg slides out of a corner and faces a couple hundred yards of straightway leading to the next bend. good place for a breather, but the driver shifts into high and screws on.}
<L>__{exterior lake day}
<A>__{cold and gray. the current running strong. the nose of a kayak points through the swells, the viewer paddling for the shore. this is cold remote country, wild and untouched. a sky bluer than the madonna's cloak. the kayak banks and the viewer steps out, moving over the sandy beach towards a little camp.}

<A>__{she's holding out a cassette the size of a cigarette pack. but it's taking deckard's adrenalin time to recede.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{it's the nexus information you wanted.}
<A>__{he takes the cassette, but a man with so many locks must be wondering how they were gotten through so easily. he doesn't even want to ask.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{he realizes he's still got the gun aimed at her and sticks it back in his belt and they're left staring at each other. the situation makes awkward silence. at least for him. she's looking at him like she's got something to say but isn't saying it.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{is there anything else?}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{i know you think it complicates your work, but i'm here to help.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i've already got more help than i need.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{i think you need more help than you've got.}
<A>__{he doesn't, but she's not backing off.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{there's two reasons a man rejects help. either because he's so good at what he does he doesn't think he needs it, or he's so insecure he can't admit it.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{sounds like i'm an ass hole either way, but the answer is still no.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{two of us might be more effective than one.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i work alone.}
<A>__{she smiles.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{no you don't.}
<A>__{she lets it sink in.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{you use your equipment, don't you?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{so, i'm a piece of equipment. use me.}
<A>__{it's a strong look that passes between them a long one. maybe if he were on firmer ground he might do something about such an offer but... deckard's eyes follow her down as rachael bends to the floor and starts picking the food off the rug, put ting it back on the plate.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{that's okay, i will get it...}
<A>__{he bends down to help, but she's already done it. their heads a few inches apart. something in her eyes diminishes the distance even more.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{do i make you nervous?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<A>__{and she is. and suddenly he is too. she hands him the plate and they stand. she's looking at the floor, almost shy, then she looks up and he's watching her. she says it plain and simple.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{it's strange to suddenly realize that what you thought was your life is actually someone else's fabrication.}
<A>__{deckard nods. he feels it, but doesn't know what to do about it.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i can imagine.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{can you? i couldn't.}
<A>__{these are not some of deckard's finer moments. but she doesn't seem to notice.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{a part of me is glad. i think i feel more. i don't like who i was before.}
<A>__{deckard nods, waits the respectable interval and is glad to have a plate to take into the kitchen. in the scrambled sanctuary of his kitchen deckard looks around for a place to put the plate, but things have piled up on him in here. he contemplates the refrig erator.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{so why do you think they were after their records.}
<A>__{he's a lot more comfortable talking shop.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{they probably want to find out when they were made.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{he dumps his dinner in the garbage and comes back out. she's writing something on a card.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{i guess the date of your birth is important if you know you're not made to last.}
<A>__{no way he can keep his foot out of it. she looks up and hands him the card.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{that's my number. if you need me.}
<A>__{she goes to the door, opens it but hesitates before going through.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{you better get better locks if you want to keep me out.}
<A>__{she looks back at him and smiles the smile says she's talking about all kinds of locks. deckard looks like he might ask her to stay, but...}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{good night.}
<A>__{and she's gone.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{night.}
<A>__{he looks down at the number. it's the back side of a snapshot. he turns it over. the picture of a man and a woman. the little girl between them looks like a six year old rachael.}

<C>__{deckard }
<D>__{the possibilities were infinite. they could change their appearances but not their future. like she said, it was short. longevity is what they were after. the garbage man even wanted a past. poor fuck. i'd check it out but i knew she was right. the market worked on turn over. built in obsolescence was the name of the game. that meant her too. it was something i didn't want to think about.}
<A>__{on top of the monitor there's an open can of beans with a spoon stuck in it. deckard puts out his cigarette and reaches for them as the phone rings.}

<C>__{taffey}

<A>__{the old boys in the pit strike up a tinny version of "in a persian market" as salome dances onstage. she's a black haired beauty in a scant belly dancer costume, a couple of pounds overweight but all in the right places. she kneels ceremoniously center stage and sets the basket down before her. carefully removing the lid, she reaches in and lifts out a four foot harlequin patterned python. grinding her hips to the music, she rises, holding the coiling snake out like an offering. sounds of approval from the audience. the gold coins covering her breasts jingle and shimmer, as she weaves sensuously around the floor.}
<L>__{interior backstage night}
<A>__{to scattered applause, hoots and whistles, salome flounces offstage, the snake hung around her shoul ders, looking limp, and makes her way through the narrow corridor to her dressing room. she's about to enter when:}

<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{like to get this position. did you or were you asked to do anything lewd or unsavory or otherwise repulsive to your person?}

<C>__{salome}
<D>__{hey! do your job but don't wreck mine, huh?}

<D>__{little dirty holes the bastards drill in the wall so they can watch a lady undress.}

<D>__{and what if somebody did try to 'exploit' me? who do i go to?}
<A>__{through the hole deckard is looking at a pair of fat legs.}

<D>__{and who do i go to about you?}
<A>__{he looks back. she's some out of the shower dripping nude. she's taken off her black wig. her hair is short and blonde. deckard recognizes her immediately from the identikit. he stares at her a moment too long.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{hmmmmm?}
<A>__{deckard grins and she returns it. she takes a towel off the table and starts to dry her body. the snake noses through the cosmetics, tongue flicking trying to get back to its mistress. absently, she reaches out to stroke the snake and suddenly laughs.}
<C>__{zhora}
<D>__{you ever get the feeling things aren't the way they seem?}
<A>__{her hand closes around the snake's head. deckard sees it coming but can't move fast enough. she strikes him so hard it knocks him off his feet. before he hits the floor, she kicks him in the stomach. the snake whistles through the air again as deckard rolls out of the way. it slams down so hard it ruptures against the floor. he goes for his laser, but she's already out the door.}
<L>__{interior passageway night}
<A>__{deckard bounds out of the room and sees her go through a door at the other end of the hall. he sprints after her, arrives at the door and flings it open. black ness. the sound of her high heels clatter down the metal steps.}

<A>__{it's raining heavily. the front of the opera house is open only to foot traf fic these days. a bizarre place on a friday night, hawkers and whores, the rabble, the poor and the cur ious mill around the randy built platforms and brightly lit stands. zhora, in just a raincoat, is not out of place in this flea market atmosphere. trying not to run, she slices through the mob as quickly as she can. deckard is not far behind, dodging and side stepping, trying to move against the tide of people scurrying for shelter. she comes to an intersection and turns out of the mall onto a less crowded street. she glances over her shoulder as she breaks into a run and runs right into a couple of pedestrians. all three go down. deckard comes out of the crowd in time to spot her get ting to her feet. she sees him and runs. the two ped estrians are in his line of fire. he runs past them and drops to one knee, leveling his laser.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{stop or you're dead!}
<A>__{she doesn't. the beam flashes through the air, but she's already around the corner. with his bottom lip between his teeth, it hurts to move so fast, deckard jack legs it into the street and jumps in front of the first car coming. it screeches to a stop. deckard scrambles for the door, but the guy be hind the wheel has other ideas. he peels out fast. the next car slows down and swerves trying not to hit him. deckard goes for the door and before the old ma tron inside can lock it, deckard's yanked it open and jumps in. she screams as he pushes her into the pas senger seat and jams the car into a wrenching about face. the lady squeals like a pig as the momentum plasters her against the door. deckard slams it around the corner and guns it down the street. it's long and it's empty and it's going by fast. nothing the old lady cares to see she's got her hands over her eyes, whimpering, hoping she'll faint before she dies. deckard takes the next left so hard he almost lays it over. as the car bounces off the curb he floors it. zhora's a hundred yards ahead, halfway down the street, trying to make it back into the crowded mall. she's running fast, but the car is faster. as he passes her, deckard hits the brakes and skids broadside seventy feet. the door flies open and he rolls out firing. zhora's ducking it with no where to go, except... the showcase window on her left explodes as she crashes through. it's a corner shop joined to a series of stores, front ing the mall. deckard runs to the opening she's made and pours fire through the tunnel of her jagged wake as zhora breaks through one window after another, getting sliced, getting shot, trying to get away from deckard's laser. but she doesn't. his last shot burns a hole through the base of her skull. it kills her but doesn't stop her. her speed takes what's left of her through the last two windows and into the street where she runs into a parked car with such force that she embeds herself in the side of it. hunched over, breathing hard, deckard comes slowly for ward. the crowd starting to gather. there's something for everybody and they're coming from all directions. deckard moves through them, edging to have a look. it's not a good thing to see. it looks like salome and the car tries to eat each other. a bloody feast of metal and flesh. deckard bows his head, sick, exhausted. so much commo tion he doesn't notice three cops closing in from behind.}
<C>__{cop}
<D>__{drop it!}

<D>__{i think i have no money.}

<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{prosit.}
<A>__{down the hatch. leon slaps his glass on the bar, reach es into his pocket, brings out a little match box and slaps that down too. it's done with such pride that deckard has to look.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{you want to see my friends?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{sorry, don't have the time.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{no problem.}
<A>__{leon smiles broadly and with ceremonious care opens the box and dumps three live cockroaches on the bar.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{those cockroaches?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{ya.}
<A>__{deckard looks interested. one of them starts to scamp er away, but leon walls off the next with his huge hand.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{how long you had these guys?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{two months. but this one is not guy. it is girl. his girl.}
<A>__{leon leans closer like he doesn't want the cockroaches to hear.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{usually blackie waits until igor is eating; then, when his back is turned, he tries to take advantage of anna.}
<A>__{deckard nods, definitely interested. he signals the bartender for another round. the drinks arrive.}

<A>__{deckard shakes his head, but he'd like to. leon smiles slyly.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{we will try.}
<A>__{leon brings a cube of sugar out of his pocket and puts it on the bar. they both lean down and watch intently. the drinks come and are put away, but the cockroaches are not cooperating.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{it must be that he is not hungry or maybe she is not hot.}
<A>__{leon is catching the roaches and one by one puts them back in their box. he holds up the last and kisses it.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{you like to kiss her goodbye.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{no thanks.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{make sure you take your girlfriends with you when you leave.}
<A>__{what neither of them notices is that between leon's fingers, his stub of his cigarette is burning his flesh. deckard lifts his glass, it is empty.}

<D>__{i like you.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i like you too.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{one more, eh?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i gotta piss.}

<L>__{exterior alley old opera house night}
<A>__{deckard reels out. the door swings shut and he's sober as hell and moving fast. around the big trash dumpster alongside the building, he plasters himself against the wall and his gun is out, aimed at the door. he's in a good spot with a perfect line of fire. moments go by and he's glad for the time to steady himself. the sound of his breathing, the hum of the city and the quiet. suddenly from behind, deckard is swept off his feet and twirled around in leon's bear trap embrace. leon lets go and deckard hits the pavement, skidding hard enough to tear clothes and burn skin, but he rolls out of it and comes up with gun in hand; but leon is so fast he's already there and kicks it out of his hand. leon moves towards him, backing deckard against the wall.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{how come you know where zhora was so quick?}
<A>__{his hand is lightning. it shoots out, grabs deckard's hair.}

<D>__{four years.}
<A>__{he lets go.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{more than you.}

<C>__{leon}
<D>__{painful to live in fear, isn't it.}
<A>__{deckard is doubled over, hugging his thigh.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{but that's how it is to be a slave. the future is sealed off, he grovels, he waits.}
<A>__{even hurt, deckard is fast. he goes for his ankle gun, but leon's got it out of his hand before he can even raise it and throws it down the alley. deckard hurls forward, knocking him off balance, and scrambles to get away. leon grabs him by the foot, drags him back and jerks him off the ground.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{sex, reproduction, security, the simple things. but no way to satisfy them. to be homesick with no place to go. potential with no way to use it. lots of little oversights in the nexus 6.}
<A>__{he slams deckard into the wall.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i tell you, nothing is worse than having an itch you can never scratch.}
<A>__{deckard slides down the wall to his knees and huddles, protecting his head with his arms, waiting for the next one. leon folds his big hands together and raises them over his head, pausing just a second to savor the satisfac tion of smashing deckard's skull. the spasm that runs through leon's face is not from satisfaction. it's the bullet that went through his neck. he hits the ground hard, his big teeth biting the air like a rabid dog. dead. rachael is standing in the alley. deckard lies there looking at her. she comes slowly and quietly forward and drops deckard's gun by his side. deckard gets to his hands and knees and tries to get up, but can't quite manage it. he looks up at her, panting, spits blood and almost smiles.}

<D>__{i knew a cop once who was involved in a high speed chase. they shot out one of his tires and he went over a cliff at hundred and fifty miles an hour. they found him in the morning with a broken skull, six fractured ribs and second degree burns. on the way to the hospital he made a play for the nurse.}

<D>__{hey! i thought you were supposed to be taking care of me.}
<C>__{rachael's voice}

<D>__{there's a lot i haven't done with a man before.}
<A>__{he's got her hand in the water and had begun to soap her arm. starting with her wrist and running the bar to her elbow, up and down, slow and slippery. she watches, not quite sure of the ritual. he pulls her closer, and runs his hand up higher, mould ing and pressing, working around her flesh, up and under her arm into the privacy of her dress.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{you're getting me wet.}
<A>__{oh, yes. for a moment deckard stares at her like some furry legged satyr in rut, the fingers of his other hand rake through her hair and into the water she comes.}

<A>__{the bed looks like it was hit by a storm and deckard looks like something that was washed up in it. he's spread out flat, face creased and puffed. his eyes squint open, but only for a moment. his hands are more reliable. they search over the bed, but find it bare. he edges his head over the side, looking around for signs, but she's all gone. he gets up in two stages, sits and then stands. then sits again, resting his head in his hands.}
<L>__{interior deckard's apartment bathroom morning}
<A>__{deckard's got his face in the mirror shaving it. it's been a long night. nothing a new tongue and a trans fusion wouldn't put right. he moves a couple of inches to the left so his eyes have a view of the tub.}

<C>__{sebastian}
<D>__{mr. deetchum? hello?}
<A>__{nobody seems to be home except his chickens. as sebas tian enters, closing the door behind him, a goose charges out of the bedroom hissing and honking.}

<D>__{hello, wrigley.}
<A>__{he goes to the chickens and collects some eggs, putting them into a bowl he's brought. he puts down the bowl and reaching into his pocket carefully counts out the payment and puts the money on a plate. he's about to leave but notices there's no water in the dispenser.}

<D>__{mr. deetchum isn't taking very good care of you people.}

<D>__{then a repressor protein that blocks the operating cells.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{wouldn't obstruct replication, but it does give rise to an error in replication, so that the newly formed dna strand carries a mutation and you're got a virus again... but all this is academic you are made as good as we could make you.}

<A>__{she lets go, but before he can fall, she rams a foot into his back. he's propelled fifteen feet across the room, slams into a machine and falls to the floor. pris flies off the rings and comes at him. deckard reaches out to pull himself up, but she's al ready there. not too hard and just in the right place, she kicks him in the stomach. he goes back to the floor, gagging for air. oh so precisely she reaches out with a long index finger and flips the switch on the machine. it's a flab eliminator with a vibrator belt. normally an innocuous piece of equipment, but the motor housing on this one is missing. lots of grinding metal. a bad place for flesh and bone. but that's where deckard's hand is going. an eight year old against a full down man. in two more seconds his hand will be ground round. deckard tries to pull his hand loose. it won't come. he yanks hard, but it's welded in hers. his face is twisted and strained as he raises a leg, wedges his foot against her chest and pushes with all his might. the hold breaks. they topple back. deckard hits the floor gulping to catch his breath. pris is up and coming for him again. she hovers over him. deckard rolls out of the way as she comes down like a pile driver. reflexively deckard raises his arm to protect himself. pris just smiles, takes hold of his foot and drags him across the floor. she doesn't like to leave a piece of work unfinished. they're going back to the machine. he goes by a weight stand of dumbbells and grabs hold. it doesn't stop him. he's sliding over the floor like it was ice, weight stand in tow. pris gets to the machine, yanks his foot up and forces it toward the opening. deckard sits up, a five pound dumbbell in his hand, and clobbers her in the back. it knocks her off balance, but she doesn't let go of his foot. she hooks out with a fist but misses. he gets her with a roundhouse in the face. she goes to the floor and deckard's up, the dumbbell over his head, coming down with it. fighting for her life now, pris drives a foot into his chest. it lifts him off the floor. he flies back across the gym and lands in a heap. no more games. pris is furious and moving fast. she rips a steel bar out of the wall and, holding it over head, charges him like a samurai. as she comes down for the kill, she freezes. deckard landed near the laser. he crawls towards it. as in a nightmare, it takes forever. but he gets there. he reaches out and grabs the laser, rolls over and takes careful aim. she charges towards him, screaming her rage. he fires as she comes. the shot amputates her left arm at the shoulder, but her hand doesn't let go of the bar. it dangles crazily in front of her as she charges forward. he puts the next one through her neck. pris hiccups a rope of blood as she flies through the air and crashes next to deckard. dead. he lies next to her, chest heaving. slowly he rolls over and gets to his hands and knees. panting, he stag gers to his feet and stands over her, swaying slightly. the sound that escapes his throat is raspy and dry. it might not sound like a war cry, but it is.}
<L>__{interior corridor night}
<A>__{laser in hand, deckard kicks open the swinging doors and walks into the corridor, a dangerous man.}
<L>__{interior stairwell night}
<A>__{deckard arrives at the main floor landing, checks his loads and continues up the stairs. he's going to shoot the next thing that moves and find out later if he was right or wrong.}
<L>__{interior stairwell second floor night}
<A>__{on the next landing he throws the door open. his eyes move down the hall, looking for prints in the dust. none. he continues up the stairs.}
<L>__{interior ninth floor night}
<A>__{on the ninth floor he finds what he's looking for. footprints coming and going from a door halfway down the hall. he stops to the side of it and listens. silence. deckard fires three quick shots through the door. if somebody were on the other side of it, they aren't now. he kicks the door open and dives through head first and hits the floor in a roll, pouring fire into the far corners of the room but the room is empty. there's a kitchen bar, a closet and a bedroom door, both closed. deckard's breathing is the only sound. no response from either door. maybe it was a sound, maybe intuition, but suddenly deckard twists around and fires several shots into the closet. the smouldering door slowly creaks open. mary is huddled in the rear of the closet. her hand out like somebody about to catch a ball but afraid of it. in her other hand she clutches a button eyed monkey. her face is bewildered, frozen in fear, her body riddled with holes. no recognition gap here. deckard shoots her through the neck to make sure. mary falls to the floor, like a puppet with her strings cut. deckard backs away from the pathetic figure in the closet and sits on the sofa, unable to take his eyes off her. deckard lays the laser down next to him, holds out his hand and looks at it. it's steady. he drops it in his lap, closes his eyes and leans back. a tapping from the ceiling. deckard looks up. a knock with the proverbial double rap at the end. a pause. deckard jumps out of the way as the ceiling gives in. chucks on concrete and plaster hit the couch where he was sitting. the hole is a couple feet in diameter beams cracked through, exposing the apartment above. silence. deckard wipes the plaster dust from his eyes and mouth, then whispers:}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{hello, roy.}
<L>__{interior stairwell ninth and tenth floor night}
<A>__{deckard comes out onto the landing. taking his time, he climbs the steps to the next floor, the last floor. he shoots the hinges out of the big stairwell door, pushes it with his foot and it comes down with a bang. the reverberations turn into silence. the corridor is empty.}
<L>__{interior corridor tenth floor night}
<A>__{moving fast but cautious, he passes each door until he gest to the apartment above sebastian's. slowly he turns the know and pushed open the door.}
<L>__{interior apartment tenth floor night}
<A>__{except for the hole in the middle of the floor, there's nothing to see. back against the wall, he moves to wards the bedroom, but stops at the noise. it sounds like the hooting of an owl and it's coming from the hallway.}
<L>__{interior corridor tenth floor night}
<A>__{deckard looks around the corner of the door down the hall. batty's at the other end. except for jockstrap and gym shoes, he's nude.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{you wanna play?}
<A>__{deckard fires. batty's fast. he ducks into a doorway. pops out again.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{not very sporting to fire on an unarmed opponent. i thought you were supposed to be good. aren't you the man?!}
<A>__{the makeup on batty's face is somewhere between a coman che warrior and a transvestite. the immensity of his insolence awesome the muscles of his body are swol len, trembling from the thrill of it.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{this is how we do it up there, lad! come on!}
<A>__{in a blue of lightning like action, batty whips down the hall, zigzagging off the walls towards deckard so fast that deckard gets only three shots off before the blur crashes through the wall on his left with a laugh. deckard stands there a moment digesting the impact of it, then edges up to the gaping wall. batty is be hind him. he knees deckard in the back and slaps him in the head. deckard goes to his knees, then over on his face. batty kneels next to him.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{not hurt, are you? you better get it up or i'm going to have to kill you. unless you're alive you can't play. and if you don't play, you don't get to be alive.}
<A>__{deckard's eyes are closed, mouth bleeding. he exhales and makes and effort. he slides his hands up even with his chest and starts to push.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{that's the spirit.}
<A>__{like a matador, batty walks away. by the time deckard's on his feet, batty's disappeared through one of the doors. deckard wipes the blood from his mouth, bends down and picks up his laser, reloads and looks down the hall, towards the jeering voice.}
<C>__{batty's voice}
<D>__{come on, deckard, show me what you got! i'm right here on the other side of the door. but you gotta shoot straight 'cause i'm fast!}
<A>__{deckard gets to the door, blasts it, kicks it open and fires at batty. but it's only the reflection of batty.}
<L>__{interior room tenth floor night}
<A>__{the full length mirror on the other side of the room shatters. batty's next to him, grabs deckard's hand and steps in closer.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{straight doesn't seem to be good enough.}
<A>__{they're face to face.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{you don't have a chance, do you?}
<A>__{in an exaggeration of weary disappointment, batty drops his head to the side.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{looks like i'm gonna have to scale it down for you. give you a handicap. i won't run through any more walls. okay? i promise to use the doors. okay?}
<A>__{deckard stares back at him, but doesn't respond. sud denly fury storms through batty. he throws deckard out the door, knocking him down, grabs him by the collar and rams his head into the wall.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{come on, let's use that brain!}
<L>__{interior tenth floor corridor night}
<A>__{he drags him down the hall, on his knees and bangs his head into the wall again.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{think! we need a little resilience around here!}
<A>__{he yanks him further and bashes his head again.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{where are those balls of yours?! let's see a little bravery!}
<A>__{the storm passes. deckard hangs in batty's hand like a bag of laundry.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{that was irrational of me not to mention unsportsmanlike. won't happen again.}
<A>__{he drops him.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{i will be down the hall when you're ready.}
<A>__{betty walks off and disappears through one of the doors. deckard gets to his knees, leans against the wall a mo ment, then punches it with his fist. on his feet he's a little wobbly. holding his breath so he can hear above his own breathing, he listens. no sound. no sign of batty. the laser is laying nearby. he doesn't bother. deckard is backing down the hall, quiet as he can. he had a job to do. he would like to have done it, but he's not insane. he gets to the landing and turns. on the first step down, he stops. batty's on the land ing below, looking up at him.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{where you going?}
<A>__{he wait a moment for deckard's answer.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{no cheating. a promise is a promise. i will honor the handicapped, but we gotta play on the top floor. you go get your laser gun now. and i will give you a few seconds before i come.}

<D>__{two!}
<A>__{deckard darts into the nearest door. the apartment above sebastian's, with the hole in the floor. deckard considers it.}
<C>__{batty's voice}
<D>__{no fair jumping through holes. you might get hurt doing that! three!}
<A>__{deckard dashes back into the hall, chooses another door and goes in.}
<L>__{interior tenth floor apartment night}
<A>__{his eyes skim over everything, looking for an advantage. he throws open a door. the bathroom. the plumbing is dismantled, walls stripped, revealing brick, nails protruding. too small.}

<C>__{batty}
<D>__{five!}
<L>__{interior tenth floor apartment night}

<C>__{batty}
<D>__{six!}

<A>__{batty moves to the nexterior the door to deckard.}
<L>__{interior tenth floor apartment night}
<A>__{deckard's crouched lower, holding his breath talk about a hair trigger... silence. batty's feet are heard creaking away. deckard looks around. runs a hand over the wall behind him. batty's feet come back. a pause.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{ten!}
<A>__{the door explodes! a shape hurtles across the room. deckard pivots, fol lowing it with rapid fire. it's a tv. he spins back. but batty's already on him. he gets one shot off be fore batty's got his hand. there's a hole over batty's right eye. blood running down his face, dripping on deckard. the right side of his face isn't working too good. the corner of his mouth doesn't quite shut his voice comes out slurred, a little hollow.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{one point for you.}
<A>__{the would doesn't minimize his omnipotence, just makes it more malignant. he throws deckard against the far wall. deckard fires. hits batty in the shoulder.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{ho ho! try it again!}
<A>__{he comes at deckard, jerking back and forth, a cobra in fast motion, faking, weaving, yelping with excitement as deckard tries to get a shot, firing away until his laser's empty. bloody and crazed, batty pushes up against him.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{what's wrong? don't you like me? i'm what we've made!}
<L>__{interior tenth floor hall night}
<A>__{he's backing deckard out the door. deckard trips and falls. there's fear on his face. the strength is gone. something is starting to crack.}

<A>__{deckard's pedaling backwards over the floor.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{it's time to die.}
<A>__{deckard throws the laser at him. it misses. batty throws his head back and laughs. a one eyed colossus about to eat the world. suddenly he stops. his eye moves over the wall.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{ah!}
<A>__{he reaches out and pinches something. his lips compress as he yanks it out of the wall. it's a ten penny nail. he holds it out to deckard and drops it. deckard catches it.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{that's for you.}
<A>__{one side of batty's face smiles savagely.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{stick it in your ear and push. if that doesn't work, try the eye.}

<C>__{batty}
<D>__{believe me, it'll be better for you than what i'm about to do.}
<A>__{batty watches him, hoping the stimulus might inspire his victim to more action. it doesn't look like it.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{well?}
<A>__{deckard springs to his feet and bolts. but instead of going for the stairwell he turns in the first available door.}
<L>__{interior tenth floor apartment #2 night}
<A>__{provocation accomplished. batty smiles and walks lei surely towards the door. deckard's terrified scream and the sound of glass crashing stop him. batty speeds up and moves into the room. the window pane is splattered, curtains sucked out, bellowing in the wind.}
<C>__{batty}
<D>__{crap.}
<A>__{he walks up to the window. deckard comes away from the wall, inching up behind him, laser in both hands, aimed at the base of batty's skull. batty starts to lean over, but even before his eyes see the pavement, he knows. he spins... deckard fires again. this one goes home. batty falls like he was poleaxed, hits the floor dead weight. deckard starts to tremble. his arms go limp as his head tilts back and he closes his eyes. he can breathe again. on the floor, batty's hand is crawling toward deckard's ankle. with the unsuspected abruptness of a man slipping on a banana peel, deckard comes down. face knotted in hor ror, he empties the laser in batty's body but the hand holds on. with a screech of frustration he drops the laser and like an animal claws at batty's dead fingers but the fingers are welded shut. deckard starts to crawl, pulling batty behind him. he struggled through the door and stumbles to his feet.}
<L>__{interior tenth floor hall night}
<A>__{deckard plunges down the corridor dragging batty along. he falls, gets to one foot, falls again and crawls the last couple feet to the stairwell.}
<L>__{interior tenth floor stairwell night}
<A>__{groaning, he tugs and pulls, hauls and heaves batty's body to the edge of the landing. he pauses for breath, then lays back, wedging his feet against batty's shoul ders and pushes. inch by inch the body goes over the edge. then all at once it drops. but the hand holds and the weight of the body takes deckard with it. as deckard slides over the edge, he grabs hold of the railing. deckard's hanging three hundred feet over the basement floor, supporting himself and batty's corpse almost four hundred pounds of stress on his fingers. with his free foot he chops away at batty's hand, try ing to break it loose. but it's not working. deckard's fingers are starting to slip. his face is a mask of agony as he wedges his heel over batty's thumb. with the help of gravity and everything he's got in his right leg to push with, he pushes. the thumb breaks loose. batty falls. the sound of his body hitting below sounds good, but deckard doesn't notice. he's in an awkward position. he must reverse the way he's facing to pull himself up. he lets go with his right hand and crosses it over the left. then turns the left around so he's got an over hand grip. like a man doing his last pull up... the one that can't be done, deckard pulls himself up, throws a foot over the edge and grapples and heaves and wiggled himself onto the cold solid steel of the stairwell landing. and lies there, body jerking spasmodically, slowly clenching and unclenching his cramped hand, but it's his burning cheek against the cool metal he's most aware of. dizzy, hot, lungs on fire, he stands and putting one foot in front of the other, deckard descends the stairs.}
<L>__{exterior sebastian's building dawn}
<A>__{slowly the door pushes open and deckard comes out into the morning. the sun isn't yet risen, but the sky has begun to pale. it's a brooding gray stew of a dawn not very pretty, but even though he can't show it, deckard is glad to see it. for a moment he tilts his head back and takes some breath, then walks across the courtyard towards the street, so dead on his feet he hasn't the energy to fall. deckard slumps into the shelter of his car. the col lapses on the front seat.}
<L>__{interior deckard's bedroom dawn}
<A>__{in a corner of the dimness deckard sits slumped on a chair, facing the pearly gray light of the window. the only sound in the room is the soft steady breathing that comes from the bed. quietly he gets up and walks over to her. rachael lies sleeping, one delicate arm exposed from under the sheet. deckard stands there, bettered and grim, staring down at her. moments go by and finally he sits gently on the edge of the bed. rachael opens her eyes, and looks up at him, she smiles.}
<L>__{exterior countryside (montage) day}
<A>__{deckard's car is skimming over the narrow highway. he and rachael in the front seat. except for the occasion al glance, their faces are still and quiet in the cold shine of an icy dream. the clouds overhead are soft and swift.}

<D>__{we had a good time. she told me a funny story and i taught her a song. a song about monkeys and elephants. and it made us laugh so hard we couldn't sing.}
<L>__{exterior woods (montage) day}
<A>__{deckard and rachael walking. the land lays white and hushed before them. down an aisle of maples and beeches. the frosty light slanting through the clean, hard limbs. the crisp, blue white snow underfoot melted through in spots exposing soggy patches of rich brown earth. rachael stops and faces him. her lips are parted, her warm breath turning the cold air to vapor. looking lithe and fragile by these barren rooted trees, she stands in the crisp white snow looking at deckard. nothing in her retreats, even now her eyes insist on knowing.}
<L>__{exterior woods day}
<A>__{deckard walking over the snow. alone. he walks slowly, mechanically through the cold, unaffected by it. his gaunt face, empty of expression except for the tears running down his pale cheeks. but for the squeak of his wet shoes over the crusted snow, there is no sound. and deckard recedes into the silence of the freezing white landscape.}
<L>__{exterior highway night}
<A>__{deckard's car, solid, throbbing, gunning along like some metal animal. headlights piercing the dark of the long, flat road. whistling speed of air and tires spin ning thrum. and then silence. and the silence astounded by the crack of a gun.}

<A>__{deckard is behind the wheel, face in shadow, eyes star ing straight ahead.}
<C>__{deckard }
<D>__{i told myself over and over again, if i hadn't done it, they would have. i didn't go back to the city, not that city, i didn't want the job. she said the great advantage of being alive was to have a choice. and she chose. and a part of me was almost glad. not because she was gone but because this way they could never touch her. as for tyrell he was murdered, but he wasn't dead. for a long time i wanted to kill him. but what was the point? there were too many tyrells. but only one rachael. maybe real and unreal could never be separated. the secret never found. but i got as close with her as i'd ever come to it. she'd stay with me a long time. i guess we made each other real.}
