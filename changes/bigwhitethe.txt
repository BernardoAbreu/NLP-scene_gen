<ACTION>__{Gary and Jimbo look over at Paul, somewhat confused. Raymond's ten yards out, and they can now see he's taken out his gun.  He's aiming it at Paul. Paul looks over his shoulder at Margaret, who's having some trouble making it up a snow covered hill. Gary's hand slips into his pocket, grabbing hold of his gun.  Raymond, oblivious, moves right past.}

<DIAL>__{Raymond... please.}
<ACTION>__{But shooting your brother is tougher than it looks. Paul opens his eyes. Raymond tries to pull the trigger again, but can't. He moves the barrel six inches to the right and shoots Margaret in the back.  She drops face first into the snow. Paul's world ends. Ears RINGING, he rushes toward his wife. Jimbo can't believe it as Gary holds him back.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(meek, apologetic)}
<DIAL>__{Sorry.}
<ACTION>__{Jimbo lunges for cover as Raymond FIRES back.  Gary, truly terrified, closes his eyes as he squeezes off shots on the run -- BANGBANGBANGBANG. One bullet bounces off Paul's car.  One hits Raymond.  With a quizzical look on his face, he drops to his knees.  A large crimson stain forms on his jacket. Everything goes quiet, except for the sounds coming from... Paul, almost crazed with grief, cradles his wife's body.}
