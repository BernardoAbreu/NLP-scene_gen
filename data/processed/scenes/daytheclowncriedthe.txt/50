<L>__{exterior barracks h day}
<A>__{all the men are lined up for inspection, they are all looking straight ahead as the guard walks down the line. all except keltner who can't help but look in the direction of the barracks where he knows helmut is still sleeping. he throws a glance at the guard as if to say... why? why are you doing this? why did he leave helmut sleeping, usually the one thing that would send the guard up a wall... why is he allowing this to happen?}
<C>__{guard}
<P>__{(as he finishes his walk)}
<D>__{you are a sick looking group of things... i can't even call you human... because you're not... you're all lice... dismissed!}
<A>__{the men break up and go about their business, they move in all directions, but keltner starts for the doorway to the barracks and is detoured by the guard who knew he would, as he stands in the way of keltner who has to turn away and go about his business... the guard peeks into the barracks.}
