<L>__{exterior earth ii orbit}
<A>__{suddenly jason's body comes into view. it's racing toward earth ii. brodski riding it like slim pickens.}

<D>__{yeee haaaaa!!}
<A>__{slowly they begin entering the atmosphere. immediately brodski is engulfed in flames and is gone. he was a good man...stay to the end to make sure the job was done right. spread eagle and alone, facing the planet below, jason continues his descent. his fingers wiggle as his chrome mask begins to heat up. it begins to glow. his metallic arm and leg glow. flames build as he rockets towards earth ii. flesh bubbles and oozes. his legs and arms begin to flail as hunks of burning flesh fall from his body!}
