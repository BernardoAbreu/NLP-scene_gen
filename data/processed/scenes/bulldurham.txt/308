<A>__{crash unloads a monstrous home run deep into the trees. he stands at home plate watching it... like reggie or the babe. and doesn't move. for several seconds he indulges himself uncharacteristically until... the opposing catcher shoves him toward first.}

<D>__{get your ass in gear...}
<A>__{crash smiles and takes the home run trot slowly. as he heads toward first, he raises a clinched fist for a brief moment, a tiny gesture of triumph. and then, routinely, he just circles the bases. a hundred fans applaud routinely as he circles the bases.}
