<L>__{exterior city early morning}
<A>__{camera tracks with quail as he walks along the busy modern street towards a subway station. modern cars (out of focus) pass noiselessly between the camera and quail. there is a plaintive tune being played on violin. quail pauses and gives a wad of notes to the aged violinist, then walks on briskly.}
<L>__{interior subway station early morning}
<A>__{quail enters the station. everybody must pass through a weapons check before proceeding to the platforms. two armed guards stand at either side, as commuters pass through an electronic beam. on a screen, the entire body of each person is seen in x ray. all of them are clearly carrying a gun in their inside coat pocket.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{no weapon again, mr. quail?}
<C>__{quail}

<C>__{guard}
<D>__{yeah? well, it's the law, mr. quail. has been since 1990 they tell me. tomorrow ya carry ya gun or ya get reported.}
<A>__{guard gestures to his associate. they've obviously been through this with quail before.}
<C>__{quail}
<D>__{okay. herb, okay.}
<A>__{quail walks on to the track area. the train arrives. signs above each approaching car say "car full", "room for 10 persons", etc. quail goes to a carriage marked "new car".}
