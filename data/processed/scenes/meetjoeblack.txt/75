<L>__{interior parrish's study, country estate night}
<A>__{quince is "on the carpet", sweating through a confession, parrish moroses but philosophical at his desk.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{...what can i say after i say that i'm sorry? i zipped when i should've zagged, i opened my big mouth one too many times, everything got all twisted }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{it's okay, quince. i understand. you've always meant well and i appreciate that. sometimes things just turn out wrong.}
<A>__{a knock on the door, it opens, joe appears.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{excuse me }
<A>__{he starts to step out.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{come in, joe i want to thank you okay, bill?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{as joe enters, quince flashes a warm smile at him.}
<C>__{quince}
<P>__{(to parrish)}
<D>__{joe knew the whole story. i told him. it was his idea that i come clean. i mean i wanted to come clean but he gave me a pair of balls, you know what i mean?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{yes, i believe i do.}
<A>__{quince now drifts off.}
<C>__{quiche}
<D>__{yeah, well i can tell you guys got business }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{no, i'm out of business, right, quince? however i do have some unfinished business with drew. get him out here. get him on the chopper and get him out here to night. i want to tell this guy how i feel about him face to face.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{oh, that could be a tall order, b.p. i doubt that drew's anxious to see you face to face.}
<A>__{joe steps in.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(to quince)}
<D>__{tell drew that bill acknowledges that this was a contest and he's lost. the race is to the swift, but could drew summon a modicum of understanding and allow bill to save face. tell him bill wants it understood in the business community he has merely moved upstairs in his own company, and the executive continuity is unbroken. tonight's the night to do it. he'll introduce drew to his press friends as well as some of his close acquaintances from washington and drew can tell them that everything's sailing along just fine.}
<A>__{parrish is impressed by joe's acumen, a look of grudging admiration. he nods to joe, summarizes:}
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(to quince)}
<D>__{all in all, what bill wants to do is build the golden bridge to drew with no hard feelings.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{you think drew will go for it?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{quince, i've got confidence in you.}
<C>__{quince}
<D>__{sir, i will deliver the package.}
<A>__{he heads out, parrish and joe fall silent.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{not at all.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{how are you doing?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{what the hell do you care?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i was just asking, bill.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{you 'want to know', i will tell you. you're looking at a man who tonight is not about to walk through the valley of the shadow of death, he's galloping into it. and the same time, the business he built with his own hands and his own head is being commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates. and, oh yes, i almost forgot, my daughter's fallen in love with death.}
<A>__{another moment.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{ and i'm in love with your daughter.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{say again?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i'm in love with your daughter, and i'm taking her with me tonight.}
<A>__{parrish is stunned.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{you're what?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i think you heard me, bill.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{you're not taking susan anywhere. and what the hell does that mean anyway?}
<A>__{joe doesn't answer for a moment.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{i thought we had a deal.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i'm sorry, bill }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{susan is my daughter, she has a wonderful life ahead of her and you're going to deprive her of it and you're telling me you're sorry? well, i'm sorry, apology not accepted.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i love her, bill. she is all that i ever wanted, and i've never wanted for anything because i've never wanted anything before, if you can understand.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{how perfect for you to take whatever you want because it pleases you. it's not love }
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{then what is it?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{some aimless infatuation in which, for the moment, you feel like in dulging. it's missing everything that matters.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{which is what?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{trust, responsibility, taking the weight, for your choices and feel ings and spending the rest of your life living up to them. and above all, not hurting the object of your love.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{so that's what love is?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{multiply it by infinity and take it to the death of forever and you will still have barely a glimpse of what i am talking about.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{those were my words, bill.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{well, they're mine now.}
<A>__{joe is silent for a moment, cogitating.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{susan wants to come. she says she's in love with me.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{with you?! who is 'you'? did you tell her who you are?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{does she know where she's going?}
<A>__{joe doesn't answer.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{susan went, in whatever way she did, for that poor sonofabitch whose body you took, and everything else since has been aftermath. you say you love her but you don't know what love is. she 'loves' you but she doesn't know who you are. you make a deal, you're breaking it the bottom line is, joe, you're conducting a great romance under false pretenses.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i don't like what you're saying.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i don't expect you to.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{are you threatening me?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i certainly hope so i loved susan from the moment she was born, and i love her now, and every minute in between, and what i dream of is a man who will discover her and she will discover a man who will love her, who is worthy of her, who is of this world, of this time and has the grace and compassion and fortitude to walk beside her as she makes her way through this beautiful thing called life.}
<A>__{parrish is beginning to reach joe.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{are you telling me i can't be part of it?}
<A>__{a pause, parrish's posture changes.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{why did you come in here and tell me, joe? you are the biggest shot of all, you don't have to ask my permission, but that's what you're doing. you know why? because you've somewhere, somehow, developed into a good guy, and you know this is all wrong... i don't know what you're going to do how can this be love? she doesn't know who you are. why don't you tell her? try it out on her? see what happens. reveal everything there is to know about yourself and let the chips fall where they may.}
<A>__{joe has received what parrish has said.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{okay? i've given it my best shot. i wish i could tell you to sleep on it but...}
<A>__{parrish lets his words drift into silence, he shrugs, joe regards him.}
