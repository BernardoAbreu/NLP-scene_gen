<L>__{interior hospice hallway day}
<A>__{matt and the kids walk slowly through this different, calmer wing of the hospital looking for the right room number. finally they find it and push open the door into }
<L>__{interior hospice room continuous}
<A>__{while still a hospital room, there is no medical equipment present. bucolic colorful paintings on the wall are intended to be uplifting. but unlike the expansive view outside elizabeth's icu window, here the window looks out partially at a cinder block wall. sid and the kings are greeted by dr. johnston and grief counselor dr. herman, who affects a comforting smile.}
<C>__{dr. johnston}
<D>__{hello, everyone. matt.}
<P>__{(off their greetings)}
<D>__{this is dr. herman, whom i told you about. she works with us in counseling.}
<C>__{dr. herman}
<P>__{(locking eyes with all)}
<D>__{hello, everyone. hello. hi. hello.}
<A>__{the two professionals allow the kings to turn their attention to elizabeth, who now lies with no machines at all. around her balloons droop, flowers wilt, get well cards lie in a pile. elizabeth too is wilting and drooping. her skin is pasty, and her cheeks are hollow.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{how come mom isn't on any more machines? is she getting better?}
<A>__{the adults exchange glances. dr. herman approaches scottie.}
<C>__{dr. herman}
<D>__{you must be scottie.}
<P>__{(off her nod )}
<D>__{scottie, i have a present for you.}
<A>__{dr. herman hands her a little squeaky rubber octopus she pulls from her pocket.}
<C>__{dr. herman }
<D>__{that's right. it's an octopus. such a funny creature with its eight legs. but did you know octopi are actually extremely intelligent, like dogs and cats? they have unique personalities, and just like us they have a lot of defense mechanisms. i'm sure you know about the ink sac. she uses ink to confuse her predators. she can camouflage herself. she can emit poison, and some can mimic more dangerous creatures, like the eel. i keep her to remind me of our defense mechanisms our ink, our camouflage, our poison, all the things we use to keep away hurt. the reason dr. johnston invited me here today is to meet you, scottie. i've heard a lot about you.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{dr. herman}
<D>__{i've heard that you're a wonderful and unique and spirited girl.}
<A>__{dr. herman shoots a look at matt before continuing.}
<C>__{dr. herman }
<D>__{and i've heard your mom's not doing too well and that she's going to die very soon.}
<A>__{all watch scottie react to this news.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{dad, is that true?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{yes, scottie. it's true.}
<C>__{dr. herman}
<D>__{you're going to have to be a very brave girl right now, and you're surrounded by people who love you. i came to meet you and tell you that if you ever want to talk about what you're feeling, i would like to talk to you too. i can help you face what's going on without all the silly defense mechanisms that work for an octopus but not for us.}
<C>__{dr. johnston}
<D>__{okay. thank you, dr. herman.}
<A>__{dr. herman looks at everyone with great sincerity before leaving. scottie is left holding the octopus. she drops it, and it squeaks a little.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{what the fuck was that?}
<C>__{dr. johnston}
<D>__{yes, well, they say she's very good one on one.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{so mom's going to die for sure?}
<C>__{dr. johnston}
<D>__{yes. we worked really hard with her, but three other doctors and i agree she's in what we call an irreversible coma. do you know what that means?}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{it means she doesn't have a brain anymore.}
<C>__{dr. johnston}
<D>__{not exactly, but... yes, that's the general idea. so we're doing exactly what she wanted us to do if that ever happened. that's why she's not attached to the machines anymore.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{it's for the best, scottie. look at her. she's not happy like this.}
<C>__{dr. johnston}
<D>__{the purpose of medicine is to heal, and we can't do that now.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{do you understand?}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{yes. what will we do with her body?}
<A>__{dr. johnston looks to matt for this one.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{first mom's going to give some of her organs to other sick people, so she can help save their lives. that's a really neat thing she's doing. then we're going to... we're going to scatter her ashes in the ocean. you know how mom always loved the ocean.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{her ashes?}
<A>__{scottie looks at her mother, picturing her as ashes.}
<C>__{scottie }
<D>__{when will she die?}
<C>__{dr. johnston}
<D>__{any day now, i'm afraid. but you still have some time.}
<C>__{dr. johnston }
<D>__{well. let me know if you have any more questions.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{thanks, sam.}
<A>__{the doctor leaves, and the room is quiet. scottie is in a sort of trance.}
<C>__{alexandra}
<D>__{come here, scottie.}
<A>__{scottie goes to her sister, who takes her in her arms.}
<C>__{scottie}
<D>__{do eyeballs burn?}
<C>__{sid}
<D>__{hey, scottie. don't think about stuff like that.}
