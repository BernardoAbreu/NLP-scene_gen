<A>__{a shot of rose, dave, buddy, doll and waski at a picnic celebration outside the church by a running brook. the scene should be beautiful in summertime. we see a barbecue pit, homemade ice cream in the metal can, other picnic things. a happy rose is kissing first buddy, then doll, then waski. dave smiles fondly, but rather stiffly at her.}
