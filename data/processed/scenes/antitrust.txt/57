<L>__{interior gary's office a moment later}
<A>__{agitated, gary rather compulsively lines up the papers, pens, etc. on his desk; he barely hears the knock at the open doorframe.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{milo. what's up?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{well you sent for me.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{right... right.}
<A>__{still distracted, he finds a page of code on his desk, gives it to milo. once again, milo marvels.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{you really wrote this just today?}
<C>__{gary}
<P>__{(dark, unsmiling)}
<D>__{what're you implying.}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(taken aback)}
<D>__{nothing!}
<A>__{their eyes are locked. gary blinks, sags into his chair.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{everything i do is under scrutiny. the questions they ask, trying to make anything strategic look sordid.}
<P>__{(knits his brow)}
<D>__{i'm confused. doesn't everybody in business try to get ahead?}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(uncomfortable)}
<D>__{i'm sure.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{the purpose of this company isn't to destroy our competitors any more than the purpose of living is to breath. but the software business is binary: you're a zero or a one. being obsessive isn't a crime. it's a character trait.}
<A>__{milo just wants to get out. he studies the code to hide his discomfort. gary watches him.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{it scales, don't you think?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{definitely.}
<A>__{he smiles. for the first time it looks forced.}
