<L>__{interior pool hall. night.}
<A>__{two characters stand, leaning, against a back wall. staring ahead, without purpose. halfheartedly watching a game of pool in progress. just hanging out. strange, threatening characters. one of them is young. lean, hungry looking. stacy is his name. a shrewd, scheming kid. but definitely a little unhinged. weirder is his companion. uncle john. the title isn't one of courtesy. he's an actual blood relative. maybe 25 years older than stacy. but intellectually younger. physically, much bigger. the man is huge. nevertheless, the safer of the two until stacy tells him otherwise. way they're standing next to each other suggests the ease they feel in each other's company. tight bond. they're good buddies.}

<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{come over here.}
<A>__{that was in the way of an order. he nods around the corner where it's less crowded. stacy stops uncle john from following, and goes after avery.}
<B>__{thompson}
<A>__{at the bar. keeping his eye on them.}
<B>__{avery}
<A>__{speaks softly. alone with stacy.}
<C>__{avery}

<D>__{what shit is this. i just do it. i don't prepare it.}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{i will point you in the right direction, but you'll have to take it to the end zone. he's a hit and run gunman i figure he's not cruising the polo lounge.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{this is un fucking professional.}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{see, a successful man like me has limitations i lose touch at a street level. so i have to depend on a smart boy like you who's closer to the nitty and the gritty than i am.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{fuck you, mr. whatever your name is. this is a lifestyle i embrace.}
<C>__{avery}
<D>__{that's why i'm letting you take care of this. i'm the one with appearances to maintain. but who gives a shit about you? not even god.}
