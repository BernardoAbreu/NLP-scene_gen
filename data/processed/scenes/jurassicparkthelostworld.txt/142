<L>__{exterior cemetery day}
<A>__{snow falls in a gray midwinter sky. in a cemetery, a group of fifty mourners is grouped around a gravesite next to a coffin that is festooned with cascades of flowers. on a table, there is an array of framed photographs of john hammond. a minister reads from the bible while the mourners wipe away tears. ian malcolm stands a respectful distance from the group, kelly right beside him. malcolm's face is blank, tired, his sunburn out of place with the white winter setting around him. at gravesite, a young woman turns, looking back over her shoulder. about sixteen, she's lovely, with long blonde hair and an honest, open face. she notices malcolm, recognizes him. she nudges a young man next to her, about thirteen years old. the young man turns and breaks into a smile just as welcoming. as the ceremony breaks up, they walk over to him.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{hello, lex. tim.}
<A>__{lex stands on her tiptoes and kisses malcolm on the cheek. tim extends a hand and malcolm shakes it.}
<C>__{malcolm }
<D>__{this is kelly. my daughter.}
<A>__{they nod their hellos.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{i'm glad you came, dr. malcolm}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i'm sorry about your grandfather.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{we were going to call you, in a few days. tim and i have been thinking, and we've decided we want people to know about the island. about what we all saw.}
<C>__{tim}
<D>__{we think it's something our grandfather would want us to do.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{because it's true.}
<A>__{malcolm looks at her for a long moment.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i know, lex. but even if we're the only ones who ever know, it'll still be true. you see, i've decided that if the world found out about what your grandfather created, it wouldn't be around for very long.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{but it was real. you can't let people go on saying it's not.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{that's the thing about reality.}
<A>__{he looks down at kelly.}
<C>__{malcolm }
<D>__{even when people stop believing in it, it doesn't go away.}
<A>__{kelly smiles and takes his hand, her slender fingers interlocking with his.}
