<L>__{interior truck (moving)}
<A>__{the truck clay is prisoner in is blown into the air by the shockwave... smashing down onto it's side, skidding...}
<L>__{exterior by the warehouse}
<A>__{cougar and jensen destroy the remaining par secs with legs. grabbing cuff keys and freeing themselves.}
<C>__{jensen}
<D>__{shouldn't have gone after the hat...}
<A>__{wham! cougar kicks the guard in the face, knocking him cold. aisha rappels off the oil tower in the distance. various par sec teams fire at her! cougar scoops up two rifles and tosses one to jensen they give her covering fire as she comes! as he shoots, to the wounded pooch:}
<C>__{jensen }
<D>__{can you stand?}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{i've been shot in both legs, what kind of dumbass question is that?}
<C>__{jensen}
<D>__{oh, so we're mr. grumpy now? you're not the only one who's been shot recently, you know!}
<A>__{he empties a full clip into a par sec team and reloads... aisha pinned down forty yards away. almost out of ammo. par sec team, almost on top of her when a figure emerges from an overturned truck. gun in each hand, blazing. the par secs cut down one by one. the figure lowers his guns. desert eagles. walks up to her. underneath the blood, oil, and grime, it's clay. they stare at each other... then, incredibly, aisha raises her weapon at him.}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{did you kill my father?}
<A>__{jensen comes running up, interrupting:}
<C>__{jensen}
<D>__{clay?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{kind of in the middle of something here, jensen }
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{did you kill him?}
<C>__{jensen}
<D>__{there was no drive, clay }
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(eyes on aisha)}
<D>__{i know }
<C>__{jensen}
<D>__{there was no drive and roque's gone and par sec's regrouping and pooch could bleed out }
<A>__{aisha's had enough, thumbing the hammer back:}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{did you kill him?}
<A>__{clay, about to respond when:}
<C>__{cougar }
<D>__{i did.}
<A>__{they turn to see our long tall sniper standing above them.}
<C>__{cougar }
<D>__{he asked us. it was mercy. but you're his family, so i understand.}
<A>__{and then, incredibly, cougar lays his rifle at her feet.}
<B>__{surrendering...}
<C>__{cougar }
<D>__{but only me.}
<A>__{clay and jensen blink, shocked. aisha stares at cougar, equally surprised. she levels her pistol at his head... silence. we cut wide : to see... a gunshot. muzzle flash from aisha's gun. cougar falls... in close again. aisha stands over cougar's body. the others, stunned... and then cougar rises. face bloody. cheek ripped open, from where the bullet creased his flesh. she fires again blam! identical scar on his other cheek. blood runs down his face. he doesn't move to wipe it away.}
<C>__{aisha}
<D>__{wear it. remember him.}
<A>__{cougar nods. leans down, picks up his rifle. debt paid.}
<C>__{jensen}
<D>__{okay, excellent, very tribal we need to go.}
<A>__{as if on cue, bullets kick up dust around them! a new par sec team, incoming. clay, jensen, aisha, and cougar hightail it back to where pooch lies.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{can you stand?}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{this is stupid question day, isn't it? it's stupid question day and someone forgot to tell me...}
<A>__{clay slings pooch over his shoulders fireman carry style. looks across the terminal to where pooch's van is parked. push in on clay's face for:}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{and they do. sprinting across the open space in slo mo, cougar and aisha wasting everything that moves. a full on ballet of fully automatic mayhem... they make it to the van! piling in! cougar behind the wheel guns the engine and they peel out...}
