<A>__{chris is hauled out on a litter. morphined, his eyes watching it all from somewhere deep in his brain. passing: groups of soldiers looking like bowery bums and moving like rats through the smoke and garbage snooping for souvenirs with wheezy tired eyes and grunts of greed. passing a bulldozed pit with heaps of nva bodies in them. a bulldozer pushing another set of bodies in, like photos of a nazi death camp. nearby, two burly soldiers lift a woman nurse and with a once through build for momentum, toss the fresh body into the pit. chris, numb, goes by.}

<A>__{captain harris doesn't respond; at this point he doesn't give a shit, standing apart from the radios looking numbly at the remnants of his boys filtering by on litters. chris intersects him now, harris' eyes looking blankly, then nodding sickly trying to give him encouragement. just coming to the edge of tears, choking it back, and turning back. these are his sons who are lost. a good officer. rodriguez, wounded, is lifted up in his litter and moved out to the waiting medivac chopper, a huge red cross painted on a white square. doc goes by on another litter, then ace, adams, huffmeister, etc. then francis is littered by, bandages around his leg, a big smile on his face.}
