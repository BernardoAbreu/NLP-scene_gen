<A>__{randy sits in the van, staring at the club's rear emergency exit. cassidy emerges, a jacket covering her dress. randy waves. spotting him, she comes over, climbing in the passenger side.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{thanks. i appreciate it.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{that's okay.}
<A>__{she looks at his vulnerable expression.}
<C>__{cassidy }
<D>__{i'm sorry. that's fucked up, dude.}
<A>__{randy nods.}
<C>__{cassidy }
<D>__{when was it?}

<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{yeah, yeah. feelin' much better.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{good, good. what happened?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{it was while i was wrestling. i collapsed in the ring.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{oh, man. that's terrible.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{yeah, it was pretty fucked up.}
<A>__{he chuckles, a little perversely.}
<C>__{randy }
<D>__{tell ya, though, it was a big hit with the fans.}
<P>__{(amused grin)}
<D>__{promoter told me everybody was hanging around wondering if i was okay, they wound up buying up all of his t shirts and shit. whole merch table got cleaned out.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{that's funny.}
<A>__{randy's grin fades. his expression turns melancholy, fearful.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{doctor says i can't wrestle no more.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{damn. what are you gonna do?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{i don't know. i don't know what to do. if i can't wrestle...}
<A>__{he loses himself in some bleak thought.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{it just happened. you don't have to figure everything out this second. give yourself some time.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{time's all i got. i just sit there all day...}
<A>__{he stares off bleakly again.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{you really shouldn't be alone right now.}
<A>__{he turns to her, looking her in the eye.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{that's why i came to see you.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<P>__{(a little unnerved)}
<D>__{randy...}
<A>__{she looks at him with sympathy.}
<C>__{cassidy }
<D>__{i feel bad what happened. but you and me... i can't go there.}
<A>__{randy gives her a sour, disappointed look.}
<C>__{cassidy }
<D>__{you should be with family now. you have a daughter, right? where is she?}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{we don't really get along too good.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{it doesn't matter. you need her.}
<C>__{randy}
<P>__{(bitter chuckle)}
<D>__{she don't need me.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{everybody needs a father. trust me.}
<A>__{randy shrugs, not so sure. cassidy glances at the dashboard clock.}
<C>__{cassidy }
<D>__{i'm sorry. i gotta get back in.}
<A>__{she puts a sympathetic hand on his knee.}
<C>__{cassidy }
<D>__{you take care of yourself.}
<A>__{she gives him a peck on the cheek. he lingers there for a second. a weird, tentative moment.}
<C>__{cassidy }
<D>__{you gonna be okay?}
<A>__{he nods, putting his brave face back on.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{i'm randy the ram. i've taken bigger bumps than this.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{i'm sure.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{maybe i will give my daughter a call.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{you should.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{why the fuck not? i'm her father. a person only gets one father in this life.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{exactly.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{unless you're adopted.}
<A>__{cassidy laughs. she gives him a friendly pat on the shoulder.}
<C>__{cassidy}
<D>__{you're gonna be just fine.}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{definitely.}
<A>__{cassidy climbs out of the van. randy watches as she heads back into the club. his cheery expression fades. he is alone again.}
