<A>__{nick leaps from the lincoln and watches open mouthed as the vehicular ballet unfolds. down the hill the speeding trailer sideswipes a delivery van and goes into a spin. the bohemians sipping espresso at the outdoor cafe look up to see the words god's perfect asshole bearing down on them. the delivery van veers out of control. the bohemians scatter. the truck runs over a fire hydrant and smashes its way through the patio furniture and into the cafe. a geyser of water plumes where the hydrant once stood. the trailer resumes its downward plunge toward the busy cross street below. kwomp! nick turns to see the still restive lincoln part from the fiat and begin to roll down the hill after its partner.}

<A>__{the driver of the fiat bolts after the accelerating lincoln, but as he realizes the futility, slows to a jog. the driver turns to see he forgot to set his own brake, and desperately rolls out of the way of the fiat. motorists slam on their brakes as the speeding trailer crosses four lanes of traffic. it jumps the curb crashing into the plate glass window of a gourmet sausage shop. a cop car lights up and speeds into the intersection, just in time to get clipped by the lincoln. the cop car goes into a tail spin, smashing into a chicken transport. the flock of feathered inmates fly for freedom. the lincoln continues to generate momentum on its slalom run, thundering past the stopped cars and into the wrecked building like a runaway express train. the gas cannisters in the trunk ignite and the sausage shop explodes, the trailer's two propane tanks going off like bombs. the fiat comes flying into the flaming mess and blasts apart, sending shards of metal and sausage links to go raining down on the spectators. the blaze lights the trail of gasoline left by the broken fuel tank and a stream of liquid fire races up the hill, ending at nick's feet. nick takes a moment to watch in horror as dark plumes of smoke billow into the sky, the geyser of water, the storm of dazed chickens. he turns around and does his best to inconspicuously walk out of frame.}
