<L>__{interior viktor's beach house night}
<A>__{viktor dims the lights, plays "mood" music. the doorbell rings. he checks himself in the mirror. in the reflection, he spies an autographed photo of himself with his arm around simone. he hurriedly hides the photo and answers the door. elaine stands there.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{viktor, i'm picking up lainey.}
<A>__{elaine is over dressed for her supposed errand.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{elaine, it's wednesday.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(feigning absent mindedness)}
<D>__{is it wednesday? it's wednesday. how embarrassing. i don't know what i was thinking. with all the excitement lately...}
<P>__{(peering past him)}
<D>__{am i interrupting something? are you expecting company?}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(ushering her inside)}
<D>__{as a matter of fact i am.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{when is she coming over?}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(glancing to his watch)}
<D>__{about now. would you like a drink?}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{i suppose i could stay, just until she arrives.}
<A>__{elaine takes a seat on the sofa. viktor hands her a glass of wine and sits beside her close. they both knock back their wine in one long gulp, both apparently in need of courage.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(trying to make conversation)}
<D>__{is simone back to earth yet?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{not quite.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{i'm sure you'll keep her focussed. she's lucky to have you, viktor.}
<P>__{(blurting out)}
<D>__{is she really having your baby?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{impossible.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(instantly regretting the remark)}
<D>__{i just read somewhere }
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{i know. i know. they'll say anything.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{ and she was positively glowing at the awards.}
<P>__{(making to leave)}
<D>__{i should be going, she'll be here soon }
<A>__{viktor puts his finger to her lips to hush her.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{ she already is. simone's not coming over, elaine. not tonight, not ever.}
<P>__{(holding her)}
<D>__{i want you back, elaine.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(melting)}
<D>__{i want you back too, viktor.}
<A>__{they kiss. elaine breaks the kiss, suddenly consumed with doubt.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{this is crazy. who am i fooling? i can't compete with simone. what woman can?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{i would rather have you than simone. believe me.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{that's sweet, viktor, but i couldn't let you do that make that kind of sacrifice.}
<P>__{(meeting his gaze)}
<D>__{it's strange. i've stabbed people in the back, clawed and slept my way to where i am it goes with the territory but, for some reason, i can't betray simone. there's... i don't know any other way to say it there's a goodness to her.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{no, there isn't. there's nothing to her.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{oh, viktor. you say that now because we're here, alone, like this. but in the morning, you'd go back to her. what man wouldn't?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{no, i will end my relationship with her totally.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{but you don't understand. she'll always be there at some party, on some magazine cover, some song on the radio, up on some screen.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(desperate)}
<D>__{no. she'll never work again retire, never make a movie or a record, or appear ever again.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{of course she will. her public will demand it.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{not if i don't let her.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{you?}
<A>__{viktor knocks back another glass of wine for courage.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{i'm going to tell you a secret now, elaine.}
<P>__{(mustering all his nerve)}
<D>__{simone is not a real person. i invented her.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(misinterpreting his remark)}
<D>__{every actor is an invention, viktor. don't embarrass yourself. no one's denying that you discovered simone. but it's like finding a diamond in the desert. anyone can trip over it, but it's not the finder who sparkles.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(agitated)}
<D>__{ no, no, i didn't trip over her. you don't understand }
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(ignoring him)}
<D>__{ you just got lucky that she's loyal enough to stay with you. maybe she's staying out of pity, who knows? she certainly doesn't need you. some people even say you're holding her back.}
<C>__{viktor}
<P>__{(wounded)}
<D>__{who says that ?}
<P>__{(shaking off the insult)}
<D>__{ never mind. you have to listen to me, elaine. simone is thin air, pixels, molded by me from a mathematical equation. i inherited it from a madman i can show you }
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{how much wine have you had?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{ she's a figment of my own imagination. i, viktor taransky, have perpetrated the greatest hoax, the greatest sleight of hand, sleight of mouth, sleight of sleight in entertainment history! and still no one appreciates me, recognizes what i've done even you.}
<C>__{elaine}
<P>__{(rolling her eyes)}
<D>__{you're drunker than i thought. are you doing that again?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{no! whatever talent simone has comes from me me! me! i swear, as god is my judge. you don't know what i've been through. tens of thousands of mind numbing hours in front of that screen, nights without end, and look what it's cost me.}
<P>__{(producing his spectacles)}
<D>__{why do you think i've been wearing these? i may have done irreparable harm to my eyesight, and why? to extract and refine the infinite nuances of a human being a human soul.}
<P>__{(a final explanation)}
<D>__{don't you see? i made simone!}
<A>__{a pause. his words hang in the air.}
<C>__{elaine}
<D>__{you made simone?}
<P>__{(a trace of pity)}
<D>__{viktor, she made you.}
<A>__{elaine gets up and walks out, leaving the distraught viktor alone in his house.}
