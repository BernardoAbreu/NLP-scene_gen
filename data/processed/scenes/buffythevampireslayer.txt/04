<A>__{the barmaid leads the knight, by candlelight, upstairs to his room. the door opens inward. the knight stands in the doorway, places a hand on the barmaid's hip. she pauses a moment, then breaks free of his grasp, starts down the hall. he laughs a bit, resignedly, and closes the door. a vampire stands behind it. not two feet from the knight, grinning at him. his eyes are skull hollow and dancing in his head, his bloody smile full with teeth. his skin is gray, and peeling. the knight turns slowly and sees him.}

<A>__{the vampire licks his lips. he is on the knight in a second, pushing him backwards into the middle of the small room. the knight struggles but is no match for the vampire, who buries his face in the knight's neck. the knight screams.}
<B>__{angle on door}
<A>__{it suddenly flies open, the lock shattered. the vampire turns like a frightened animal. in the doorway stands the barmaid, a slayer. in her hand is a wooden stake. the vampire drops the knight, who crabs backwards into a corner. the slayer and the vampire come at each other. the slayer spins and kicks; the vampire flies back. snarling, he comes back at the slayer. they struggle; he slips free and is out the door. for a moment, the slayer remains still, crouched on the floor. the knight watches her. she seems to be making a decision perhaps even knows what is going to happen. she runs at the window.}
