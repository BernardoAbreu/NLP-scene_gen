<L>__{exterior sunset blvd. continuous action}
<A>__{lestat and marius sit perched on a giant billboard advertising lestat's concert. down below, sunset strip is filled with goths, club hoppers, honking cars, a traffic jam.}
<C>__{marius}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{impressive. reminds me of mad old druids running around chanting in the forest. very primitive stuff.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{out there. my fans. thousands and thousands. they worship me. millions of arms reach out to embrace, beg me to come into their lives.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{it's what you've always wanted.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{with all my black little heart.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{do you think of anyone but yourself?}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{i only have myself.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{it may be time to get ready for some company.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{your music's woken a very old friend...}
<A>__{lestat looks at marius, trying to understand.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{can't you hear it? or is the applause all you can hear now?}
<A>__{marius becomes eerily still. a deep, somber tone starts to vibrate. the ground rumbles. lestat taken aback, remembers the scope of marius's power. lestat stares at marius, then closes his eyes... close on lestat's eyes as the sounds of the world seem to fade away: , revealing beneath the cacophony of mortals a deep pulse like the beating of a heart the size of a planet.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{lestat suddenly opens his eyes as the sounds of the world rush back in. marius stares for a beat, then }
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{akasha has risen. she has taken her king's blood. absorbed his power. you've done it this time.}
<A>__{lestat stares at marius, letting the knowledge sink in. then he grins.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{good! i'm glad she's risen! let her come.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{don't you understand? you must stop this concert!}
<C>__{lestat}
<P>__{(shakes his head at marius)}
<D>__{200 years and the same broken record.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{no. not the same! you've only known akasha dormant. she too will find you. she is choosing her moment. she has come to destroy you, lestat. and in her wrath, she will devour everything that moves. mortal and vampire alike.}
<C>__{lestat}
<P>__{(smiles at marius, softly)}
<D>__{well then, it's every vampire for himself. just the kind of rules i like. the rules you taught me.}
<A>__{marius is enraged, tries to control himself. lestat gazes at him, speaks steadily.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{do you remember your first words to me, marius? 'i am unknowable.'}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{i'd rather not exist at all than have to live eternally as a ghost.}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{and you're taking everyone with you, you fool! we were once mortals, too. it is our heritage we protect!}
<C>__{lestat}
<P>__{(moving away)}
<D>__{such reverence for mortals! then you should have left me as one!}
<C>__{marius}
<D>__{you're a monster.}
<C>__{lestat}
<P>__{(shakes his head with a dark laugh)}
<D>__{said the vampire to his son.}
<A>__{lestat turns, leaps off the billboard, disappearing into the black night. marius stands alone.}
