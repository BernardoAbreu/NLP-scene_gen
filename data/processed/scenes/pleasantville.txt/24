<B>__{full shot. pat boone.}
<A>__{he stands facing the camera in an actual kinescope from 1958. the backdrop is a painted pastoral landscape and the background singers are all white debutantes. he wears a letterman's sweater and button down shirt ...}
<C>__{pat boone}
<D>__{"... tooty fruity oh rooty. tooty fruity ... oh rooty."}
<A>__{he continues his homogenized version of little richard's nasty hit, (all the nastiness gone). it becomes a slow and lilting melody ...}
<C>__{pat boone }
<D>__{"... tooty fruity oh rooty ..."}
<B>__{series of shots. pleasantville.}
<A>__{the music continues as the camera cuts to image after image of this strange "utopia." the effect is a weird, sanitizied version of mtv as if ronald reagan had shot a music video. there are men tipping their hats and women walking their dogs; cheery gas station attendants and smiling policemen.}
<C>__{pat boone }
<P>__{(slowly ...)}
<D>__{"... a wap bop a loo bop a wap barn boom."}
<A>__{pruned hedges. twin beds. big houses. the camera cranes down in the middle of a beautiful tree lined street to find david and jennifer walking up the sidewalk, holding their stomachs.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i'm gonna hurl, david. i swear to god.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{just take deep breaths.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{all that animal fat. i feel it in my pores or something.}
<A>__{jennifer clutches her stomach, but david's glance darts from side to side totally absorbed.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{i still don't see why we're doing this.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{we're supposed to be in school.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{we're supposed to be at home david! we're supposed to be in color!}
<P>__{(wailing)}
<D>__{oh god ...}
<A>__{a man calls out from across the street.}
<C>__{mr. simpson}
<D>__{hello bud.}
<C>__{david}

<C>__{david}
<D>__{we just gotta play along for a little while ... till that guy shows up again. then i will talk to him and ...}

<D>__{play along?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{well, yeah. i'm ... bud parker and you're ... um mary sue.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(ripping the barette from her hair)}
<D>__{no! i'm not gonna do it! if i don't dress like this for mom i'm sure as hell not going to do it for you!}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{we don't have a choice jen. we're stuck until he comes back.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{why can't we just explain it?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{to who?}
<A>__{jen looks around this cheery little street, and the horror starts to dawn on her. at that moment, they hear a screaming siren and a bright gray fire engine comes racing up the block.}
<B>__{wider.}
<A>__{jennifer and david step back on the curb as the firemen come flying out of the truck, grabbing the ladder on the back. different angle. (following the firemen) they work in perfect precision. two firemen grab the base of the ladder while a third takes the front. they go tearing across one of the lawns, in full "emergency response" anchoring the ladder into the ground and winging it up into a tree.}
<C>__{fireman}
<D>__{c'mere, kitty ...}
<A>__{he emerges a moment later with the cat who was stuck in the tree. jennifer sinks to the curb as he carries the kitten by them, petting it gently as he goes.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{oh god, we are. we're stuck in like "nerdville".}
<P>__{(shakes her head)}
<D>__{i always knew you'd pay a price for this. i knew you couldn't be hopelessly geekridden for this long without suffering some like, really tragic consequences.}
<P>__{(voice wavering)}
<D>__{... but it's just not fair. i mean i'm starting to get really popular. debbi russell transferred to another school and my skin's been great since march and mark davis is starting to come around and ...}
<C>__{boy's voice }
<D>__{hello mary sue.}
<A>__{jennifer turns to see a strapping blonde seventeen year old driving by in his convertible. he is extremely handsome with jack armstrong features and a letterman's sweater. despite her crisis, jennifer's jaw drops open as he slows to a crawl. biff martin flashes a huge pepsodent smile. the guy is a "dreamboat".}
<C>__{biff }
<D>__{what's all the commotion? where's the cat?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{um ... it's ...}
<A>__{biff turns to see the fireman climb into the truck, with the kitty in his arms.}
<C>__{biff}
<D>__{ah, right ...}
<P>__{(smiling at her again)}
<D>__{well guess i will see ya later mary sue.}
<A>__{he takes off down the street with the sun glinting on his really keen convertible. jennifer gapes as he disappears around the corner.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{who's that?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{biff martin. captain of the basketball team.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<P>__{(still gaping)}
<D>__{does he you know like "me"?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{as a matter of fact he does.}
