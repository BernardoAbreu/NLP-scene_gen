<L>__{interior night. thornfield the drawing room.}
<A>__{a box tied with ribbons sits on the table.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{ma boite, ma boite!}
<A>__{rochester is leaning against the mantelpiece, drinking.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{take it away you genuine daughter of paris and amuse yourself with disembowelling it.}
<C>__{mrs fairfax}
<D>__{we'll open it together, shall we?}
<A>__{mrs fairfax kindly leads adele away. jane is about to cross the room with them.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{miss eyre. sit there.}
<A>__{he gestures to a chair by the fire. jane obeys. she studies rochester. he is intent on adele, who is pulling a pink satin dress out of the box.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{i'm not fond of children.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{oh ciel! que c'est beau!}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{nor do i particularly enjoy simple minded old ladies. but you might suit me if you would.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{how, sir?}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{by distracting me from the mire of my thoughts.}
<A>__{adele, irrepressible, runs across the room embracing the dress. she drops on one knee at rochester's feet.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonte...}
<A>__{she looks up, seeking his approval.}
<C>__{adele }
<D>__{that is how maman used to say, is it not?}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{precisely.}
<C>__{mrs fairfax}
<D>__{let's try it on, shall we?}
<A>__{adele skips off with mrs fairfax.}
<C>__{rochester}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{and that is how she charmed my english gold out of my english breeches pocket.}
<A>__{rochester notices how keenly jane is observing him.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{your gaze is very direct, miss eyre? d'you think me handsome?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{no sir.}
<A>__{rochester laughs.}
<C>__{jane }
<D>__{i was too plain; i beg your pardon.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{what fault do you find with me? i have all my limbs and all my features }
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{mr rochester, it was a blunder. i ought to have replied that beauty is of little consequence }
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{now you stick a knife under my ear }
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you have other qualities, sir.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{just so; other qualities... when i was your age i was a felling enough fellow. i might have been insulted then. you're blushing miss eyre.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{not at all.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{and though you're not pretty any more than i am handsome, i must say it becomes you.}
<P>__{(he laughs)}
<D>__{and now i see you're fascinated by the flowers on the rug.}
<A>__{jane senses his mockery.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{i'd like to draw you out. come, speak to me.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{what about, sir?}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{the choice of subject is entirely yours.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{how can i introduce a subject when i don't know what'll interest you?}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{the fact is, miss eyre, i don't wish to treat you like an inferior.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{yet you'd command me to speak?}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{well i probably have a right to be a little abrupt and exacting on the grounds of my superiority in age. there must be twenty years between us and a century's advance in experience.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i don't think you have a right to command me just because you're older. your claim to superiority depends on the use you've made of your time and experience.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{i've made indifferent use of both. and this is why i sit, galled by my own thoughts and order you to divert me. are you very hurt by my tone of command?}
<A>__{jane smiles.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{there are few masters who'd trouble to enquire whether their paid subordinates were hurt by their commands.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{oh yes... paid subordinate; i'd forgotten the salary. well on that mercenary ground, will you consent to speak with me as my equal without thinking that the request arises from insolence?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i'd never mistake informality for insolence, sir. one, i rather like. the other, nothing free born should ever submit to even for a salary.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{humbug. most free born things would submit to anything for a salary. but i mentally shake hands with you for your answer.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{not three in three thousand schoolgirl governesses would have answered me as you've just done.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you've clearly not spent much time in the company of schoolgirl governesses. i'm the same plain kind of bird as all the rest, with my couple of accomplishments and my common tale of woe.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{i envy you.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{your openness, your clear conscience, your unpolluted mind. if i were eighteen i think we truly would be equals. nature meant me to be a good man, one of the better kind and as you see, i am not so.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{are you a villain then, sir?}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{i'm a trite commonplace sinner, hackneyed in all the dissipations that the rich and worthless try to put on life.}
<P>__{(he sighs)}
<D>__{when i was your age, fate dealt me a blow. i was cursed with a burden to carry through life. i lacked the wisdom to remain cool and i turned desperate. dread remorse, miss eyre. it is the poison of life.}
<A>__{rochester takes in her open, compassionate face.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{and since happiness is denied me, i've a right to get pleasure in its stead. and i will get it, cost what it may.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{then you'll degenerate still more.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{are you preaching to me?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i'm reminding you of your own words; remorse is the poison of life.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{but, miss eyre, if the pleasure i was seeking was sweet and fresh; if it was an inspiration; if it wore the robes of an angel of light... what then?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i don't know. to speak truth, i don't understand you at all.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{my heart has long been a charnel house. perhaps it'll transform into a shrine.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{sir, i find the conversation has got out of my depth.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{you're afraid of me because i talk like a sphynx.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i'm not afraid.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{yes you are.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i've simply no wish to talk nonsense.}
<C>__{rochester}
<D>__{if you did it would be in such a grave, quiet manner that i would mistake it for sense. do you never laugh, miss eyre?}
<A>__{this question cuts jane to the quick.}
<C>__{rochester }
<D>__{only rarely, perhaps. but you're not naturally austere, any more than i'm naturally vicious. i can see in you the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close set bars of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute captive. were it but free, it would soar. cloud high.}
<A>__{jane opens her mouth to speak but she cannot.}
