<D>__{alex, why don't you start? scottie, hand her the box.}
<A>__{scottie does so. alexandra takes the box reverently she wants to perform this sad, strange ceremony without messing up. she opens the box and pulls out a scoop of ashes, which scottie looks at unblinking. alex looks to matt, who gives her the go ahead, and without further ceremony pours them into the sea.}
<B>__{the ashes}

<A>__{now matt takes his turn. he looks directly inside the urn at the ashes that were once his wife. angle on the ashes his pov a complex series of emotions passes over his face love, grief, disappointment, resignation. without further ceremony he upends the box over the water and pours the rest of elizabeth into the ocean. all three take a long look as the mass of ashes disappears. matt takes off his lei and places it into the water. the girls follow suit. wide angle of the boat floating as the leis float away.}
