<A>__{vicki looks at him.}
<C>__{vicki}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{she kisses him. hesitantly, he kisses her back. series of shots jumping forward and back in time a) bathroom: walter's hands shake as he splashes water on his face. his shirt is off, and he wears just his jeans. he looks up at himself in the mirror. b) bedroom: walter lies back on his bed. vicki runs her hand up his chest, pulling his shirt over his head. walter looks at vicki, already topless. he tentatively touches her breast. c) bedroom: walter kisses vicki, then more and more rapidly, all over, passionately. they roll so she is underneath him. d) livingroom: vicki walks backwards towards the bedroom door, pulling walter's hand to follow. e) bedroom: walter lies next to vicki, staring up at the ceiling, spent, still breathing hard. f) bedroom: walter gropes vicki's body and urgently pulls her underwear off. g) bedroom: walter and vicki are completely engrossed in each other, making love. h) bathroom: walter breaks his gaze from the mirror and turns the faucet off.}
