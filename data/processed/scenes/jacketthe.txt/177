<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{talia}
<D>__{what is it? lorenson [finding it hard to explain] nothing. [beat] i don't know. i thought of something i could try.}
<A>__{lorenson looks at talia helplessly. talia nods and leads eugene inside. lorenson can't help but look down the hall to make sure no one's there.}
<L>__{interior study office, lorenson's apartment, night, 1992}
<A>__{lorenson sits across from eugene, holding up a picture of a dog. between them is a tray of milk and cookies.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{come on eugene, try to say it with me. this is a "dog".}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{d d d .}
<A>__{but eugene can't hold the sound of the letter long enough to make the word. an absence seizure takes hold of him as he looks out unconsciously into space. lorenson moves closer to him.}
<D>__{lorenson [softly] what's happening to you?}
<A>__{lorenson checks eugene's pulse and leans in close to the boy's unconscious face like the answer is there if she just looks hard enough.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{are you having a seizure? is that really what's going on?}
<A>__{lorenson spots a corner of eugene's eye twitching slightly, and, rushing to get a better look, takes the shade off of the nearby lamp and holds it above his head so she can get a better look at him. just then, talia opens the door, startling lorenson. she knocks over the milk and, as it spills on the lamp cord now on eugene's lap it causes an electric shock. eugene catches it. talia gasps and lorenson watches the boy in fear. the moment passes and eugene more responsive than he has ever been before looks at his mother and lorenson. he doesn't know what's happened but he is aware, and awake, like never before. eugene picks right up where he and lorenson left off.}
<C>__{eugene}
<D>__{dog. [to talia] hi.}
<A>__{talia and lorenson look at him and each other at shock.}
<D>__{starks [o.s., distantly] you're going to...shock the boy and then things will change for him.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{you ok, eugene?}
<A>__{eugene holds lorenson's gaze steadily for a few moments.}
<D>__{lorenson [stunned himself] yeah, you are ok.}
<C>__{talia}
<D>__{what's happening? lorenson [putting the pieces together] he got a little shock. [to himself] and it's reset him. not permanently probably...but at least for a little while. they use it on epileptic patients sometimes...}
<C>__{talia}
<D>__{but he's not epileptic.}
<C>__{lorenson}
<D>__{no, but he is having seizures.}
<A>__{talia looks at lorenson. she's still confused. lorenson's merely surprised.}
