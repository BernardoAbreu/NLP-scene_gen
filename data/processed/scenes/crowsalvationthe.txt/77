<A>__{erlich violently tosses walsh crashing back toward the window, falling by the chess board.}
<C>__{erlich}
<D>__{if you're covering for someone, that's jail time. i got my eye on you.}
<A>__{erlich exits, slamming the door behind him. walsh starts to get up, stops. looking at his own eye level... alex's chess board set up identically to the game in alex's cell, a piece of folded paper protruding from under the board. walsh pulls it out. it says "q >b5" walsh makes the move, queen to bishop five. smiles. looks at... the paper unfolded says "check." walsh sets it down in the chess box next to... the picture of alex and lauren arms around each other in the woods, smiling. walsh sensing something, a presence.}

<D>__{alex?}
<A>__{walsh moves cautiously to the curtains, draws them back. nothing. he leans out the window.}
