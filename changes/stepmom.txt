Back she comes, pulling the sheets OVER her head.  Motionless now, as we hear... ... the DEAFENING SILENCE of the alarm shutting off.  A beat. Rachel SITS BOLTS UPRIGHT.  LEAPS out of the room.  From the back we see that she's dressed only in a pair of men's boxers. She makes it halfway down the hall, does a U TURN back into the bedroom, frantically YANKS a robe hanging from the door, taking the wall hook WITH her.

<ACTION>__{Duncan backs off, charmed by her ballsiness.  The music BLARES just then, and a penguin JUTS forward and NIPS the model.  The FLASH of the camera.  We FREEZE for a second, seeing the photo Rachel just took.  An Avedonesque portrait of a model being GOOSED by a penguin COLLIDING with a maitre'd who SPILLS his tray and the penguins seem to be POINTING and LAUGHING uproariously.  It's an inspired photo.}
