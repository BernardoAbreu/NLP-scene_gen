<L>__{exterior london town square execution day}
<A>__{the crowd is festive; hawkers sell roast chickens, and beer from barrels. royal horsemen arrive, dragging wallace strapped to a wooden litter. as they cut him loose and lead him through the crowd, the people begin to jeer and throw things at him: chicken bones, rocks, empty tankards. we see a former english soldier, one of those who fled in terror at the battle of stirling, lift a stone from the street and hurl it; it cracks against wallace's cheek. wallace's eyes capture the soldier, and hold him, piercing his soul. the soldier looks away in shame, even as the rest of the crowd jeers more. grim magistrates prod wallace and he climbs the execution platform. on the platform are a noose, a dissection table with knives in plain view, and a chopping block with an enormous axe. wallace sees it all.}
<C>__{magistrate}
<D>__{we will use it all before this is over. or fall to your knees now, declare yourself the king's loyal subject, and beg his mercy, and you shall have it.}
<A>__{he emphasizes "mercy" by pointing to the axe. wallace is pale, and trebles but he shakes his head. the crowd grows noisier as they put the noose around wallace's neck...}
