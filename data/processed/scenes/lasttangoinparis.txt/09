<D>__{i thought you'd left.}
<A>__{he studies her for a moment. he takes her hat and drops it on the ground. he picks her up in his arms and carries to the window. he puts her down on the window sill. they start making out ferociously. he rips her panty hose, undoes his zipper and penetrates her. they are lost in animalistic sex as she wraps her legs around him.}

<A>__{they kiss savagely and hit the floor as they climax together.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{oh, jesus... oh... oh, christ.}
<A>__{totally spent, they roll away from each other. her skirt, hiked up is showing her ripped panty hose. we can see her ample bush through the sheer fabric. they writhe on the floor trying to catch their breath.}

<D>__{oh, god.}
