<A>__{peggy enters, trying to be quiet. mr. kelcher stands in the kitchen doorway in his bathrobe waiting for her, steaming. camera tracks peggy into kitchen. she grabs a cup of coffee before sitting down.}

<C>__{peggy}
<D>__{dad.. it's not a big deal. didn't you ever stay out all night when you were young?}
