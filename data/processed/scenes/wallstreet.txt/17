<L>__{interior hallway morning}
<A>__{bud, somewhat nervous, is led down an impressive hallway hung with expensive modern art... past a huge calder mobile and a pool of some 15 traders on phones, quotron terminals and keyboards... into natalie's outer office.}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{hello, natalie, you recognize the voice? i will give you a hint, you're thinking seriously about marrying me...}
<C>__{natalie}
<P>__{(recognizing the voice)}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{...and you're even lovelier than i pictured. i brought a birthday present for mr. gekko.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{first of all, mr. fox, you can't just come barging in here. and what makes you think it's his birthday?}
<A>__{bud takes out an old crumpled fortune magazine cover of gordon gekko, entitled "gekko the great!"}
<C>__{bud}
<D>__{it's in the bible, see. you better go buy him a present. please, natalie. let me give him the gift; cuban cigars davidoff, his favorite and hard to get.}
<C>__{natalie}
<P>__{(sighs)}
<D>__{stay here, i will see what i can do.}
<A>__{she takes the gift and enters gekko's office. bud paces nervously. natalie re appears, stern, but a note of compromise in her voice.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{wait outside.}
