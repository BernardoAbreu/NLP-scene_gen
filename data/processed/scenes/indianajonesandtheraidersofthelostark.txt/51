<L>__{exterior cairo various shots day}
<A>__{first we see the sprawl, the soaring minarets, the ancient skyline. then we're closer, in the narrow, exotic streets, teeming with life: fierce looking men in tattered galabiyas, black gowned women with veiled faces, ragged, barefoot children.}
<L>__{interior dining room sallah's house (old cairo)}
<A>__{indy and marion have been welcomed like family into the crowded home of sallah, his wife fayah, and their nine children (ages 4 18). fayah, a huge, imposing woman, appears, at first glance, to be the power in the house. sallah, a small, cheerful, energetic fellow in his forties defers to his wife in all matters of little importance. suddenly the general liveliness at the children's table escalates into pandemonium, attracting the attention of the adults.}

<D>__{silence!}
<P>__{(there is silence)}
<D>__{why do you forget yourselves?}
<A>__{the gaggle of grinning off spring parts to reveal in their midst a monkey. it is munching some flat arab bread.}
<C>__{fayah}
<D>__{what is this? who brought this animal in?}
<A>__{all the children chatter their innocence at once. the monkey chatters too; it's an entertainer. the monkey jumps from the children's table to the adults' and struts slowly up toward marion, who thinks it's the cutest thing she ever saw. when it reaches her, it takes off its turban and does a deep, grand bow to her. she is delighted and takes the monkey into her arms. the monkey kisses her cheek. the children laugh.}

<D>__{why, thank you. i like you too.}
<C>__{fayah}
<D>__{then it shall be welcome in our house.}

<D>__{all of allah's creatures are welcome here. you please us by letting us please you.}
