<L>__{exterior alley old opera house night}
<A>__{deckard reels out. the door swings shut and he's sober as hell and moving fast. around the big trash dumpster alongside the building, he plasters himself against the wall and his gun is out, aimed at the door. he's in a good spot with a perfect line of fire. moments go by and he's glad for the time to steady himself. the sound of his breathing, the hum of the city and the quiet. suddenly from behind, deckard is swept off his feet and twirled around in leon's bear trap embrace. leon lets go and deckard hits the pavement, skidding hard enough to tear clothes and burn skin, but he rolls out of it and comes up with gun in hand; but leon is so fast he's already there and kicks it out of his hand. leon moves towards him, backing deckard against the wall.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{how come you know where zhora was so quick?}
<A>__{his hand is lightning. it shoots out, grabs deckard's hair.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i showed pictures. somebody recognized her. i went to see.}
<A>__{deckard is pale. the sweat is starting to run.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{how old am i?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{the grip tightens and twists.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{my birthday is april 10, 2015. how long do i live?}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{four years.}
<A>__{he lets go.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{more than you.}
<A>__{deckard's knees come up fast. leon's fist comes down faster, like a hammer.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{painful to live in fear, isn't it.}
<A>__{deckard is doubled over, hugging his thigh.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{but that's how it is to be a slave. the future is sealed off, he grovels, he waits.}
<A>__{even hurt, deckard is fast. he goes for his ankle gun, but leon's got it out of his hand before he can even raise it and throws it down the alley. deckard hurls forward, knocking him off balance, and scrambles to get away. leon grabs him by the foot, drags him back and jerks him off the ground.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{sex, reproduction, security, the simple things. but no way to satisfy them. to be homesick with no place to go. potential with no way to use it. lots of little oversights in the nexus 6.}
<A>__{he slams deckard into the wall.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i tell you, nothing is worse than having an itch you can never scratch.}
<A>__{deckard slides down the wall to his knees and huddles, protecting his head with his arms, waiting for the next one. leon folds his big hands together and raises them over his head, pausing just a second to savor the satisfac tion of smashing deckard's skull. the spasm that runs through leon's face is not from satisfaction. it's the bullet that went through his neck. he hits the ground hard, his big teeth biting the air like a rabid dog. dead. rachael is standing in the alley. deckard lies there looking at her. she comes slowly and quietly forward and drops deckard's gun by his side. deckard gets to his hands and knees and tries to get up, but can't quite manage it. he looks up at her, panting, spits blood and almost smiles.}
<C>__{deckard}
<D>__{like i said, i don't need your help.}
<A>__{after a long moment, she bends down to touch him.}
<C>__{rachael}
<D>__{you look terrible, you know that?}
