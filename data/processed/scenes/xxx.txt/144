<A>__{craggy mountain peaks and perfect turquoise blue water. xander steps out of a hut built over the water. we see petra sprawled out on the deck in a bikini. she's got a bucket of hinano beer chilling down. it's a vision of heaven. he lays down next to her, starts pulling her bikini bottom off.}

<A>__{from underwater we see the two of them dive into the lagoon nude. there's too many bubbles to see any real skin, but we know what they're up to. back on the surface we see bubbles rising and catch glimpses of their outlines beneath the water. the camera pulls back to the deck, where we see xander's communicator on the table next to the beers. we hear them surface and start splashing off camera. then the damn communicator starts to beep.}
