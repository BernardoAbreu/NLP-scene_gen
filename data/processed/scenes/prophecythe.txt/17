<L>__{exterior katherine's house day}
<A>__{showered and changed into her teaching clothes, katherine climbs into a rattling pickup.}
<L>__{exterior the town}
<A>__{katherine drives to work, passing on the outskirts the closed copper mine, vast and abandoned. down beyond the fading main street lies the great crumbling brick pile that is the school. katherine parks her truck, grabs her leather bag, and walks in.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{katherine's lecturing her students. all twenty five of them. there's high school age sons of white ranchers, navaho girls on the edge of puberty, tiny mexican children. all being taught together in one room. it's dinosaur day. katherine has a large fossilized bone on her lap.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{this is "camposaurus". camposaurus was a herbavore, which meant he only ate plants. camposaur stayed mostly to himself and never bothered anyone.}
<A>__{the little girls smile. they like camposaurus. katherine holds up another bone fragment.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{this is a leg fragment that belongs to the killer of the plateau, alosaurus. alosaurus was a vicious carnivore, which meant he'd eat anything that moved, especially nice, juicy camposaurs.}
<A>__{the little boys grin. they like alosaurus.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{both these guys lived together right here on the white rock plateau eighty million years ago, when this area used to be on the banks of a huge, shallow sea. remember how we talked about how sedimentation fossilizes bones? that's also what made the hills out behind our town and put the copper in the ground.}
<C>__{high school kid}
<D>__{lot of good that did us.}
<A>__{katherine lifts off the desk an ancient 1950s gieger counter and switches it on. it ticks softly when she points it at the dino bone.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{it's radioactive! like godzilla!}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{just a tiny bit, alex. do you know why? uranium, that's the rock they use in nuclear power plants }
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{and bombs!}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{and bombs alex, yes, is all through these hills naturally. millions of years ago the dinosaurs here ate plants and drank water which had uranium in it that became concentrated in their bones, which is exactly how, with mr. geiger counter here, we're going to find some.}
<A>__{the class cheers.}
