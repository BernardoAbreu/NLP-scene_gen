<L>__{exterior chad's car afternoon}
<A>__{with trembling hands, elena opens the trunk of chad's crashed car. she pulls out a plastic gas container, sloshing the fuel around inside, then trailing it back across the vine covered ground... she carefully places the empty container down, standing twenty feet back from the wreckage, fumbling in her pocket for a match... she can barely control her hands, her whole body shaking in fear... finally she pulls out a matchbook, still sopping wet from the swamp. she strikes match after match, but they won't light, until, finally, one produces a tiny flame that simmers for a second then smoulders out...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{don't do this to me, please...}
<A>__{in frustration, she runs back to chad's car, looking desperately for a lighter, climbing all the way in. because of the slight slope it's on, the car's flimsy door slams shut behind her. elena pays no heed, continues to rummage through the glove compartment.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{you gotta have a lighter or some...}
<A>__{she's cut off as the wrecked car's horn blares out! deafening, the sound echoes around the dense undergrowth. elena's heart skips a beat. chad's corpse has slumped forward against the steering wheel.}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{jesus...}
<A>__{she struggles with all her might to pull chad's body back off the horn... silence reigns once more. elena takes short, sharp breaths. looks over at chad's body slumped to the side, leaning against the driver's side door...}
<C>__{elena}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm so sorry...}
<A>__{not as sorry as she's going to be... the match she discarded outside only seconds ago continues to smoulder for a second, then reignites!}
