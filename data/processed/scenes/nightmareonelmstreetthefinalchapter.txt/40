<L>__{interior karen's room night}
<A>__{jacob and karen lie in bed, clothes on, cozy. not sexual. she stares at the ceiling while he listens.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{she was great. loving. supportive, caring everything a mom should be. except she had one fatal flow: my father. you see, she was raised at a time when they still had the "obey" part in the wedding vows. he was always jealous. she couldn't talk to another man without him thinking she wanted to go to bed with him. he never hit me. but the things he did to her...and she would always just take it. she never fought back. he'd get drunk and...she'd tell people she just fell down or something. then one night...i was thirteen. something happened. my mom suddenly wouldn't take it anymore. something made her say enough is enough. she hit back. tat only made it worse. i watched as he hit her over and over. then he knocked her down the stairs. she broke her neck. and when y father saw what he'd done he finally became human. he cried over her body for a while, then went into the garage and blew his brains out with a shotgun. to this day i don't remember what that final straw was. the shrinks say i've blocked it out of my memory. there's no one else alive who knows what really happened. i have dreams about it sometimes, but there's always that blank spot. a missing piece.}
<A>__{she stops and closes her eyes. jacob closes his eyes for a second also feeling her pain.}
<B>__{different angle}
<A>__{jacob opens his eyes and touches karen's arm. she finally turns to him.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i know nightmares are real, jacob. i know.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{so did my mom. she taught me a lot about dreams.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{she told me that a lot of people have special dream powers. i inherited some from her and some i have all to myself. she showed me how i could link up with other people's dreams to actually be inside with them.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{that sounds wonderful. but...i don't know...}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{a little hard to imagine, huh?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{yeah. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i can convince you.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{easy. we're doing it now.}
<A>__{jacob smiles, gets up and walks over to the bedroom door. karen is confused.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{i mean we're dreaming. you and me. together.}
<A>__{he opens the bedroom door. and there's a forest outside. karen is a little scared at first, totally blown away by what's happening. but then she stands up and smiles.}
<C>__{jacob }
<D>__{want to go for a walk?}
<A>__{karen steps up next to him and they walk through the doorway into daylight.}
