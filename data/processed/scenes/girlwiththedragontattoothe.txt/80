<L>__{exterior hedeby island dusk 1966}
<A>__{as the search continues, morell, looking like he hasn't slept which he hasn't peers down a rocky cliff to the water. somehow he knows they're never going to find her.}
<D>__{morell v o the fact that i never found a body didn't surprise me. you can't dig up an entire island.}
<L>__{interior cabin lake siljan day}
<A>__{the same face forty years older the man who spoke to vanger on the phone about the dried flowers now speaks with blomkvist as he scrapes out the bowl of his pipe.}
<C>__{morell}
<D>__{but i also couldn't find a motive. was it spontaneous? was it planned? did she know something someone wished she didn't? was it about business?}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{business? she was sixteen.}
<C>__{morell}
<D>__{and very bright. henrik told me he could easily imagine her running the business someday, which would mean someone else wouldn't.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{she was with some friends that day. at a parade. you must have talked to them.}
<C>__{morell}
<D>__{she told them she wasn't feeling well. she left early. but they also said she kept secrets from them, too. the main thing i learned talking to them for hours is that teenage girls are complicated.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i have one.}
<C>__{morell}
<D>__{so you know.}
<P>__{(blomkvist does indeed)}
<D>__{did you bring the last gift henrik received?}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{it's at the national forensic lab.}
<C>__{morell}
<D>__{i can tell you what their report will say now: it's a flower common to europe. all of them are. no prints. no dna.}
<A>__{he lights the pipe. blomkvist watches the tobacco glow.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i wanted to ask you about this.}
<A>__{he produces an old address book from his jacket pocket. of course, morell has seen it before, and handles it delicately. the decades have dried out its pages.}
<C>__{morell}
<D>__{she received this from henrik the christmas before. i studied it more times than i can say. i know every page of it.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{it's the last page i'm curious about.}
<C>__{morell}
<D>__{as was i.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{the only names not alphabetized.}
<A>__{morell nods that he knows that only too well as he turns to that last page. on it, in neat handwriting: magda 32016 sara 32109 r.j. 30114 r.l. 32027 mari 32018}
<C>__{morell}
<D>__{they're local hedestad phone numbers. the first belonged to a woman named margot, whose mother was magda, who claimed she didn't know harriet. the fourth, r.l., belonged to rosemarie larsson, an elderly woman who died a few years before. the other three were unconnected in any way that i could find.}
<A>__{he hands the address book back. it, and everything else about the case, clearly trouble him still.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i've reminded you of things you'd rather forget. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{morell}
<D>__{i can't forget it. it's my rebecka case.}
<A>__{blomkvist isn't sure what that means.}
<C>__{morell}
<D>__{every policeman has at least one unsolved case. back then it was old torstensson. year after year he kept returning to one taking out the files uselessly studying them. as young men, we had to laugh.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{was this also a missing girl case?}
<C>__{morell}
<D>__{no, that's not why i mention it. the rebecka case is something that happened before harriet was born. i'm talking about the soul of a policeman. poor torstensson could never solve it, and could never let it go.}
<A>__{and neither can poor morell with his harriet case.}
