<L>__{exterior open sky island coastline day}
<A>__{(scene 0300 awol part one) a boundless sky. vast. clear. crisp. and from it, a black speck rockets across the horizon. the image of unbridled freedom. tucked into his riding position, hiccup appears to be part of toothless. they dip, roll and dive, over a sea teeming with thunderdrums, pulling off daring maneuvers with honed refinement, making them seem effortless.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{yeah!}
<A>__{they jackknife, heading skyward, rolling and tumbling through the ethereal cloud scapes and joining high flying timberjacks as they soar in formation. hiccup is bound head to toe in a snug, aerodynamic flight suit an asymmetrical, functional design of leather and articulated plates. it has an air of viking bike leather.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{what do you think, bud? wanna give this another shot?}
<A>__{toothless grumbles in protest.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{toothless! it'll be fine.}
<A>__{with a click of a lever, he locks the pedals in the flared tail position. hiccup then unhooks himself from the saddle.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{ready?}
<A>__{toothless snorts unenthusiastically. suddenly, hiccup slides off of toothless, peeling away from him like a skydiver from a plane, yelling as he plummets. toothless dives after him. they spiral through the air, face to face. toothless is having fun, despite himself. hiccup slips his forearms through a pair of tucked leather flaps... and yanks, unfurling sheets of leather as he extends his arms. they catch the wind, snapping open like wings... and sending him gliding out of control, at first, then stabilizing. the turbulence buffets his flight suit heavily. but he's flying! toothless unfolds his wings, too, catching up with hiccup. the freedom is palpable. hiccup and toothless are, for the moment, the same. feeling the same rush of adrenaline. independently together. they plunge past cloud formations, splitting apart then crossing paths again. impressive as it is, hiccup is gliding at a steep angle. toothless launches fireballs ahead of hiccup, boosting him higher with the expanding heat bursts.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{this is amazing!}
<A>__{a cloud layer washes past, exposing a towering rock formation, dead ahead.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{no longer amazing! toothless!}
<A>__{hiccup tries to steer himself away, to no avail. toothless pours on the speed, trying to catch hiccup as he hurtles toward collision. his locked tail makes maneuvering difficult. he's unable to pull up at a steep enough angle.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{oh, no!}
<A>__{at the last second, toothless blasts the jagged rocks just ahead of hiccup, then wraps hiccup in his wings as they fly through it. the obliterated peak rains down around them. toothless emerges through the cloud of debris and hurtles into the trees of a neighboring peak. they tumble down the uneven terrain, coming to rest on a small plateau. hiccup emerges from the cocoon of toothless' wings. he switches his prosthetic riding foot to his walking foot and stows his leather wings.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{that really came out of nowhere.}
<A>__{the blown up sea stack collapses.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{we gotta work on your solo gliding there, bud. that locked up tail makes for some pretty sloppy rescue maneuvers, eh?}
<A>__{hiccup reels in his dorsal fin and removes his helmet, revealing a 20 year old hiccup framed by wild hair, complete with a viking braid. he walks to the edge of the cliff, taking in the new land stretching off into the horizon, its tall cliffs and sea stacks adorned with swaying gold birch trees basking in the dappled afternoon sunlight.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{looks like we found another one, bud.}
<A>__{toothless fusses and snorts, not amused, shaking off dust and pebbles like a wet dog. hiccup flinches as a pebble whacks him on the back of the head. he looks back to toothless, who averts his eyes.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{oh, what? do you want an apology? is that why you're pouting, big baby boo? well... try this on!}
<A>__{hiccup tackles toothless and tries to put him in a headlock.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{ya feeling it yet? huh? picking up on all my heartfelt remorse?}
<A>__{toothless simply stands on his hind legs, lifting hiccup off of his flailing feet and dangling him over the cliff's edge.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{oh, come on. you wouldn't hurt a one legged }
<A>__{hiccup looks down, seeing the precipitous drop below.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{you're right! you're right! you win! you win!}
<A>__{wham! toothless flips him over, pinning him to the ground. hiccup squirms, throwing mock punches. toothless playfully retaliates with feline taps to hiccup's head.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{he's down! and it's ugly! dragons and vikings, enemies again, locked in combat to the bitter urfff!}
<A>__{toothless rests his head on hiccup squeezing the air out of him. toothless then suddenly starts grooming hiccup, lapping at his face and covering him in slobber.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{gaaaaagh!}
<A>__{hiccup fights to get free, finally springing to his feet and shaking off the viscous saliva.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{you know that doesn't wash out.}
<A>__{toothless laughs, pleased with himself. shifting his attention back to the new land stretched out before them, hiccup reaches beneath his chest plate and produces a leather bound book. he unfurls it to reveal an explorers map, modified with added strips in every direction to accommodate their ever expanding world. drawings indicate new lands, new tribes, and many new dragons. hiccup peels a fresh strip of paper from a hidden fold in his flight suit and holds it out for toothless to lick. hiccup affixes the moistened strip to the map's outer edge, then whittles a pencil and consults a compass affixed to his forearm.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{so what should we name it?}
<A>__{toothless gurgles as he gnaws under his wing, preoccupied.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{"itchy armpit" it is.}
<A>__{hiccup carefully draws the new island's outline.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{whaddya reckon, bud? think we might find a few timberjacks in those woods? the odd whispering death or two in the rocks? who knows... maybe we'll finally track down another night fury.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{wouldn't that be something?}
<P>__{(burdened)}
<D>__{so, whaddya say? just keep going?}
<A>__{toothless' ear plates suddenly shoot up. he roars, and his call is answered by a familiar screech. hiccup turns to see...}
