<A>__{chev’s cab is parked illegally. a meter maid is writing it up.}
<L>__{int la county hospital, same time}
<A>__{the sliding doors to the er swoosh open as a gurney is wheeled in by paramedics. chev walks quickly in behind them, a complete wreck, ignoring all the activity, seemingly lost in his own thoughts. he checks a sign on the wall for directions. an arrow points toward the pharmacy. he follows it.}
<L>__{int hospital pharmacy, moments later}
<A>__{chev cuts off an old man with a walker making his way to the counter. he runs his hand through his freaked out hair, trying to straighten it out. the pharmacist, a cynical girl, mid 20s, with thick horn rimmed glasses, regards him blankly.}

<D>__{why?}
<C>__{pharmacist}

<A>__{she walks into the back. through the glass he sees her pick up a phone.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{come on, what is that...}
<A>__{a pimply faced teenager with greasy, shoulder length brown hair has been watching the whole thing from the magazine rack.}
<C>__{teenager}
<D>__{nasal spray, dude.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{teenager}
<D>__{nasal spray.}
<A>__{he gestures to a counter display: nas all, little plastic bottles.}
<P>__{teenager (cont’d)}
<D>__{it’s got epinephrine in it. get you tweaked, man.}
<A>__{chev looks from the kid to the display and back, then through the glass window, where the pharmacist is talking to someone on the telephone, looking out at him suspiciously. he picks up a handful of the little spray bottles and gets out of there. the old man gives him a sour look; chev makes him flinch with a sudden jerk toward him.}
