<L>__{interior dr. evil's main chamber}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{gentlemen, your deadline is in three hours. you have your instructions. good bye.}
<A>__{the screen goes black.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{come join us for dinner, won't you mr. powers?}
<L>__{interior dr. evil's private quarters}
<A>__{austin and vanessa are seated at a table with frau. waiters serve food. music: sexy matt helm type theme}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{i think you'll enjoy the food. i have the best chef in the world. his name is ezekial. he's made of seventy five percent plastic.}
<A>__{scott enters.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{scott my boy, come here. how was your day?}
<C>__{scott evil}
<D>__{well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak english right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause i don't speak french or whatever', and the other guy goes something in paris talk, and i go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and i go 'make me'.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<P>__{(trying to hide contempt)}
<D>__{fascinating. what are your plans for this evening?}
<C>__{scott evil}
<D>__{thought i'd stay in. there's a good tittie movie on skinemax.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{and that's how you want to live your life, is it?}
<C>__{scott evil}
<D>__{yeah. what?}
<A>__{angle on a panel of buttons that has everyone's names on it. dr. evil's hand hovers over the button labeled "scott." frau farbissina slaps his hand away.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{scott, i want you to meet daddy's nemesis, austin powers.}
<C>__{scott evil}
<D>__{why are you feeding him? why don't you just kill him?}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{in due time.}
<C>__{scott evil}
<D>__{but what if he escapes? why don't you just shoot him? what are you waiting for?}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{i have a better idea. i'm going to put him in an easily escapable situation involving an overly elaborate and exotic death.}
<C>__{scott evil}
<D>__{why don't you just shoot him now? here, i will get a gun. we'll just shoot him. bang! dead. done.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{one more peep out of you and you're grounded. let's begin.}
<A>__{a private army soldier grabs austin and vanessa. dr. evil hits a button. one whole wall slides out to reveal a tank.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{mr. powers, vanessa, some friends of mine are joining us for dinner. they're quite delighted you'll be part of the meal.}
<A>__{the soldier takes austin and vanessa to the tank and puts them in the dipping mechanism.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{dr. evil, do you really expect them to pay?}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{no, mr. powers, i expect them to die. even after they pay me the money, i'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma.}
<P>__{(to guard)}
<D>__{all right, guard, begin the unnecessarily slow moving dipping mechanism.}
<A>__{the guard do so. austin and vanessa begin to descend slowly towards the surface of the water.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{release the sharks!}
<P>__{(to the room)}
<D>__{all the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads. i figure every creature deserves a warm meal.}
<C>__{frau farbissina}
<P>__{(clearing her throat nervously)}
<D>__{dr. evil?}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{yes, what is it? you're interrupting my moment of triumph.}
<C>__{frau farbissina}
<D>__{it's about the sharks. since you were frozen, they've been placed on the endangered species list. we tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<P>__{(disappointed)}
<D>__{right.}
<P>__{(to austin)}
<D>__{mr. powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads.}
<A>__{frau clears her throat again.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{what is it now?}
<C>__{frau farbissina}
<D>__{well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are. they actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{i have one simple request sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done? remind me again why i pay you people? what do we have?}
<C>__{frau farbissina}
<D>__{sea bass.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{frau farbissina}
<D>__{they're mutated sea bass.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{really? are they ill tempered?}
<C>__{frau farbissina}
<D>__{please allow me to demonstrate.}
<A>__{frau farbissina throws a leg of lamb attached to a rope towards the tank, where the water bubbles and sea bass arch through the air. the sea bass devour the lamb. she pulls the rope back. the lamb has been eaten to the bare bone.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{fine. whatever. mutated, ill tempered sea bass it is.}
<P>__{(to the room)}
<D>__{come, let's return to dinner. close the tank.}
<C>__{scott evil}
<D>__{aren't you going to watch them? they'll get away!}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{no, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan.}
<C>__{scott evil}
<D>__{i have a gun in my room. give me five seconds, i will come back and blow their brains out.}
<C>__{dr. evil}
<D>__{no, scott. you just don't get it, do you?}
<A>__{dr. evil presses a button; the wall closes back over the tank.}
