<T>__{end track in on:}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{the mean laugh. further track in on norville ends in close shot, his hands clasped on the desktop in front of him, as he finishes his hard, square jawed, man on top laugh, gazing flintily into the camera.}
<C>__{norville}
<D>__{ ha ha ha ha ha!}
<T>__{pull back from:}
<B>__{weeping executive}
<A>__{the pull back from a blubbering executive reveals that we are at a board meeting. all of the board members sit around the table except for mussburger, who, a towel around his waist, is receiving a choppity chop massage on a padded table from a muscular man in a bulging t shirt.}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{pull yourself together, addison.}
<A>__{addison snuffles.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{nobody told me! nobody told me! you sold all of our stock?}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{we dumped the whole load. now quit showboating, addison }
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{i had twenty thousand shares! i'd be a millionaire now!}
<C>__{mussburger}
<D>__{sure, sure, we'd all be millionaires. there's no point in looking back. at the time, stilson thought dumping our position would panic the market, further depress the stock then we'd buy it all back, and more of course, once it got cheap }
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{cheap! cheap! it's never been more valuable! and i'm ruined! ruined!}
<A>__{he climbs up onto the board table.}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{i'm getting off this merry go round!}
<C>__{executive}
<D>__{addison!}
<C>__{another executive}
<D>__{myron!}
<C>__{addison}
<D>__{aaaaahhh!}
<A>__{he runs down the length of the table and hurls himself toward the window and: thwok!}
