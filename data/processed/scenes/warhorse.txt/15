<L>__{exterior lower field. the same.}
<A>__{it is a grey day as they walk across the plowed fields towards the huge lower field. they come to a rusty, primitive plow left in the grass. albert looks around the field it is overgrown, it seems to go on forever even if joey was a plow horse this would be a heavy task. si easton and andrew stroll up the road to watch.}
<C>__{si easton}
<D>__{too large, too rocky, matted with grass roots. even a sturdy plow horse'd never manage it alone.}
<C>__{andrew}
<D>__{yet he will, i say.}
<C>__{si easton}
<D>__{you'd swear he'd sprout wings and fly if albert had told you so.}
<P>__{(smiling at his son:)}
<D>__{it's a fine thing, loyal to your mate. even if he is a bit barmy. a team of two might manage, given a month and good weather.}
<A>__{they're interrupted by the honk of a horn as lyons and david pull up in a car. lyons and david get out. their driver remains inside.}

<D>__{well, you've raised him up a true narracott, ted, picture of his father, he is: not a dollop of ordinary sense but that thick stubbornness that'll lead him to insist on the impossible.}
<A>__{down in the field, albert continues to prep the plow.}
<C>__{lyons }
<D>__{wasn't a farmer in devon didn't admire you, myself among `em, leaving your brothers that fine farm and setting yourself at this stoney patch of unpromising ground. you've fettle enough for twenty men, but with a gimpy leg and the drinking for the pain, isn't it, that you drink?}
<C>__{lyons }
<D>__{ yeah, none of us could have anticipated an ending better than this. makes me question the wisdom of the charity that urged me to rent you this place, not only looking at you, me old pal, but that pretty little wife of yours, thought you were a spark, she did.}
<A>__{ted hasn't acknowledged lyons for a second; he's never taken his eyes off albert. he simply stands and walks away as}
