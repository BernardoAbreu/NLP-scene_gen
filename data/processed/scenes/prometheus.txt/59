<A>__{holloway and watts round a corner and stop in their tracks. kamarov, stillwell, and downs almost run into them. the scientists stand frozen. in front of them lies a dead giant. an engineer. if he were standing, he would be fifteen feet tall. he is roughly human in shape. barrel chested. withered to the bones. there are bulky protrusions fused with his flesh: hard to say whether they are equipment or parts of his body. his head, lolling to one side, is severed from his body. his eyes seem to be covered by goggles; but if so then the goggles are fused with his skull. an elephantine proboscis, severed now, once connected to a protrusion on his hip. the giant lies frozen in a convulsion of agony. his jaw gaping in a silent scream. his corpse is marred by hideous wounds: slashes that cut through bone. the explorers move closer. speechless.}
