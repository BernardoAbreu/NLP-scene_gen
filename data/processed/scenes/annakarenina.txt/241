<L>__{interior hotel suite, moscow day}
<A>__{vronsky comes in, noting the empty trunks and cases stacked up. anna comes from her room to greet him. she is making an effort to be pleasant, but she looks excited, febrile.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i had an inspiration. why do we have to wait here? why can't we wait in the coun try? i don't want to hear any more about a divorce, or think about it.}
<C>__{vronsky}
<D>__{good! i'm bored here. when should we go?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{if i bore you here, i will bore you in the country.}
<C>__{vronsky}
<D>__{i didn't say you bore me. moscow bores me. when should we go? . . . tomorrow?}
<A>__{but anna's mood has turned.}
<C>__{anna}
<A>__{i can't be ready by tomorrow.}
<C>__{vronsky}
<A>__{the day after, then.}
<C>__{anna}
<A>__{if you like.}
<C>__{vronsky}
<A>__{no, wait. that's sunday. i have to see maman.}
<C>__{anna}
<A>__{that's twenty minutes away in the train you could go to see her tomorrow or was it that you wanted to spend sunday with princess sorokina?}
<C>__{vronsky}
<A>__{please don't spoil everything. i can't see maman tomorrow because she won't have read the papers she has to sign. oh, and then there's the bank . . . but we can leave on tuesday.}
<C>__{anna}
<A>__{in that case, let's not bother. i will leave on sunday or not at all.}
<C>__{vronsky}
<A>__{that's absurd!}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it's absurd to you because you have no understanding for my life here.}
<C>__{vronsky}
<D>__{anna . . . anna . . .}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you've stopped loving me. you've given up everything for me, and it's turned you against me. why lie about it?}
<C>__{vronsky}
<D>__{stop. i put off our departure for a day or two, and you tell me i don't love you.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{because i've been living off your love and there's none left, so this is over! finished.}
<A>__{she leaves him, slamming the door.}
