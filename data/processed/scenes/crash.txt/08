<A>__{james studies storyboards for an automotive battery commercial, which are spread out over a broad architect's table. he makes notes on each panel of the boards with a sharp pencil. as we move around him, we reveal his secretary, renata, sitting and watching him intently from the vantage point of her corner chair, her hand poised to write down anything he might say in a small, leather bound notebook. from her point of view, we watch james from behind as he works. every movement he makes bending over to correct a panel, manipulating the pencil, touching the sharp point of the pencil to his lip, straightening up again provokes a different tiny response from renata, so attuned to him is she. but he says nothing to her, and she remains poised and vigilant.}
