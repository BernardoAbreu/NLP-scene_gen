<A>__{a yeti very carefully sets the last of a group of newly painted red robot dolls on a shelf. he breathes a sigh of relief. suddenly, the entire factory begins to shake, knocking the robot doll to the ground. he dives after it, juggles it in the air, and catches it just before it hits the ground. suddenly, streaks of black sand whoosh up into and around the factory. the dark sand snakes its way up and around the globe, causing the yetis and elves to scatter and knocking toys to the floor. the yetis and elves look up in horror as the black sand, now covering the globe, gives rise to pitch, who stands before them cackling.}
