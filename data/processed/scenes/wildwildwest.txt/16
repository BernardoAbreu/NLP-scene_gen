<A>__{west crashes down into the tarp covering the boxes. the only people more shocked than he is are the guards and the rebs he just dropped in on. west picks himself up, smiles coolly at the drenched slack jaws.}

<D>__{okay, who just made a wish? was it you?}
<A>__{he looks up at the freaked out saloon girl, still in the tank. she hangs on with one hand, the other hand clutches his clothes.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{i could sure use those clothes now.}

<D>__{well, we got us a shy nig...}
<A>__{but he never gets that word out. bang! west lashes a lightning martial arts kick to the reb's jaw.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{fought five long years with the union army not to hear that word again. and you boys lost, remember?}
<A>__{as the other reb comes at him, he spins, still holding the hat in front of him... and whap! down that one goes. west looks up at the none too bright water tank woman.}
