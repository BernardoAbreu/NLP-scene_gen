<C>__{county sheriff}
<D>__{ahhhhhh!}
<A>__{the motorcycle cop gets disintegrated, leaving behind a pair of flaming boots (a reference to the movie timerider, which was co written and produced by mike nesmith). parnell watches from side mirror, where we see that the left side of his sunglasses have no lens.}
<C>__{j. frank parnell}
<D>__{oh my darlin clementine, you are lost now gone forever, dreadful sorry clementine.}

<C>__{mr. humphries}
<D>__{you were late again this morning. now normally i'd let it go but it's been brought to my attention that you're not paying attention to the way you space the cans. many young men of your age in these uncertain times }
<C>__{mr. humphries}
<D>__{otto! are you paying attention to me?}
<C>__{louie}
<D>__{hey! he's talking to you!}
<A>__{kevin chuckles otto grabs kevin by the front of his shirt, steps around him, and pushes him into the stack of cans (this has been described as a goof but it's clearly just a case of awkward staging used to make the shot work). louie pulls his gun.}
<C>__{louie}
<P>__{(basta!)}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{you gotta love getting fired from your job in a big way, otto.}

<C>__{louie}
<D>__{come on you worm. get out of here.}
<A>__{louie shoves kevin down aisle where otto is walking out. otto takes off his clip on bow tie and tosses it back towards louie. louie twirls his gun and puts it away. note that the store aisle is lined with nothing but generic products, plain black lettering on white background. all products in movie from now on will have this appearance. punks slamdancing to coup d'etat in the back of a warehouse. otto is there slamdancing and duke walks up, the two of them swing each other around. behind them, the graffiti on the wall says "circle jerks", a band which will appear later in the movie.}
