<A>__{delilah is in her kitchen, humming a gospel song to herself, apron on as she begins to make a pie. she pulls a metal flour cannister down from the shelf, flips the lid off about half full. she starts to scoop flour out from it and something falls out a small cloth purse. she picks it up to put it aside, then frowns at the way it feels. she shakes flour off, unzips it nothing inside.}
