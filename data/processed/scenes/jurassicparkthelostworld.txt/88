<L>__{exterior hunters' camp night}
<A>__{back in the hunters' now demolished camp, members of the two groups combine their diminished supplies. they have half a dozen large plastic containers of water, thirty seven containers of food, ranging from ziploc bags to aluminum tins, a variety of weapons, mot of them borne on the hips or shoulders of the hunter team, the charred and scraggly remnants of several pieces of now useless electrical equipment, a flare gun and several flares, somebody's tattered paperback ("crime and punishment"), a box of hershey bars, and a cartoon of marlboros. roland supervises the assembling of the resources, which are displayed in front of him. ludlow, nick, sarah, juttson, and malcolm, who is still holding kelly close to him, are with him. they hold their discussion in quiet tones.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{if we can't stay in the rex's territory, we have to move tonight.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{move where? our boat's not coming for two days, your airlift is waiting for an order you have no way to send }
<A>__{ludlow refers to the charred and trampled satellite photographs of the island, which are still mostly legible.}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{there's a communication center, here, in the old worker village. hammond put in some kind of renewable power source replenishing. it may still work. if we could get there, we could send a radio call for the airlift.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{how far is the village?}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{i said if we could get there.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{well, how far is it?}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{a day's walk, maybe more. that's not the problem.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{what is?}
<C>__{ludlow}
<D>__{the velociraptors.}
<A>__{malcolm looks up sharply.}
<C>__{ludlow }
<D>__{our infrareds show their nesting sites are concentrated in the island interior. that's why we planned on keeping to the outer rim.}
<A>__{malcolm shepherds kelly away from the conversation and mutters something to her quietly in the background.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{what are velociraptors?}
<C>__{juttson}
<D>__{carnivores. pack hunters. about six feet long, three or four hundred pounds, and very, very fast.}
<A>__{dieter brandishes his weapon.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{i think we can handle ourselves against them.}
<A>__{malcolm rejoins the conversation, alone. he keeps his voice low.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{no. i'm quite certain you can't.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{look, we have two choices. we can hike back down to the lagoon, where we can sit for two days, in the open, next to a heavily used water source while we're waiting for your boat to arrive, or we can head for the village, where we might find some shelter and we can call for help.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{we'd never make it past the raptors. trust me, i have some experience in this matter.}
<A>__{roland looks at him.}
<C>__{roland}
<D>__{that may be. but you weren't with me at the time.}
<A>__{malcolm just shakes his head, then turns and walks back to kelly. roland turns to the others.}
<C>__{roland }
<D>__{load up. let's get this moveable feast underway.}
