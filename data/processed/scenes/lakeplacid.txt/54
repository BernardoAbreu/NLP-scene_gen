<L>__{exterior underwater day}
<A>__{jack and hector, diving together.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior lake two hours later}
<A>__{the boats sit still on the dead calm water. kelly works the radar, keough covertly eats a twinkie.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{it shouldn't be taking so long.}
<A>__{they both scan the surface. dead calm.}
<L>__{exterior underwater continuous}
<A>__{hector moves about. we can hear the hatchling recorder, but he's not seeing anything.}
<L>__{exterior underwater (another area) continuous}
<A>__{jack looks about. he looks up. doesn't see much but he gets an eerie feeling. something's out there.}
<L>__{exterior lake continuous}
<A>__{keough, kelly, and burke, standing idly, scanning the calm surface.}
<C>__{keough}
<P>__{(into headset)}
<D>__{hector, jack, we show you with about twelve minutes of oxygen left, and you're on the last tank. time to go home.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{that was a bust.}
<A>__{a beat. another beat. then... something jerks the boat a little.}
<C>__{kelly }
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{i don't know. it was like a tug. something tugged us.}
<A>__{upon which something really yanks the boat. so hard... kelly flips over the back, into the water.}
<C>__{keough }
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{the boat is moving, being dragged quickly.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{something's got the anchor line!}
<C>__{keough}
<D>__{kelly!!}
<A>__{but kelly's alone in the water, the boat being pulled away.}
<B>__{resume}
<C>__{keough}
<P>__{(into headset)}
<D>__{jack!! hector! we're being dragged!!}
<P>__{(as he starts the motor; to burke)}
<D>__{cut the line! cut the fucking line!}
<A>__{burke goes to work on the anchor line as we angle kelly, treading water, in the middle of nowhere. she's completely vulnerable.}
