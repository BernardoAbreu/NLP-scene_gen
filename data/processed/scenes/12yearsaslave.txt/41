<L>__{exterior norfolk port day}
<A>__{we see a flat overhead view of the port of norfolk. sardines are laid out to dry in rows, glittering in the day's sun as if like silver pennies. a chain of slaves enter the frame and are led one by one on to the docked vessel. more slaves about 15 in all, of various genders and ages are brought on board. chief among them is robert who fights viciously with his captors. "with all haste" is shoved down into the hold. having taken their cargo as far as they care or need to, burch and radburn depart. they do so without a word spoken to solomon or the others. with this new and sizable batch of slaves on board, the crew again casts off, and the orleans makes its way again.}
