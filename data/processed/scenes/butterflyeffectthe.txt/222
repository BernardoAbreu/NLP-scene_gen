<L>__{5, has a birthday party. kayleigh is there.}
<A>__{angle on evan's eyes getting lost in the memory. chaotic noises of children's party bleed into evan's reality. the world shudders uncontrollably.}
<T>__{smash cut to:}
<L>__{exterior lenny's backyard day 1987}
<A>__{evan, 5, comes to at a birthday party. he's unexpectedly gently prodded forward by andrea.}
<C>__{andrea}
<D>__{go on, evan. introduce yourself.}
<A>__{evan slowly approaches kayleigh, only five. she smiles bashfully at him. an old memory comes back to him.}
<C>__{kayleigh }
<D>__{when my folks split, they gave me and tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. i couldn't stand my dad, but i knew if i lived with my mom, i'd never see you again...}
<A>__{evan slowly looks around the yard, taking in the reality of this distant memory. he even inhales the aroma of the place. savoring the moment. he locks eyes with kayleigh.}
<C>__{andrea }
<D>__{he's not usually this shy.}
<A>__{it's time. evan leans over to kayleigh as if he's about to kiss her. then whispers in her ear:}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{i hate you. if you ever come near me again, i will kill you and your whole family.}
<A>__{kayleigh reacts predictably. bursting into tears and runs into kayleigh's mother's arms.}
<C>__{kayleigh's mother}
<D>__{what did you say to her? what happened?!}
<A>__{evan ignores them. he can't take his eyes off kayleigh.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{goodbye.}
<A>__{his eyes well up. flash!}
