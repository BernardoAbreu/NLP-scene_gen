<T>__{smash cut to:}
<L>__{interior tina's bedroom. night.}
<A>__{tina convulses in bed with a scream, looking around wildly. someone is knocking on her door.}
<C>__{woman's voice }
<D>__{you okay, tina?}
<A>__{tina's mother sticks her head in with a worried look. tina sits up and blows out a breath, groggy.}
<C>__{tina}
<D>__{just a dream, ma...}
<P>__{(more to herself)}
<D>__{damn dream, is all...}
<A>__{the woman, once attractive, ventures a step into the room. a man hovers background. tina's mother waves him away without looking, shoving a strand of bleached hair from her eyes. she appraises her daughter.}
<C>__{tina's mother}
<D>__{some dream, judging from that.}
<A>__{she nods at tina's nightshift. tina looks down at her nightgown, only now aware of the chill penetrating it from the room. there are four long slashes up its middle, cleanly cut as if by scalpels.}
<C>__{man }
<P>__{(distant, annoyed)}
<D>__{you coming back to the sack or what?}
<C>__{tina's mother}
<D>__{hold your horses.}
<P>__{(lower, to tina as she stands to leave)}
<D>__{you gotta cut your nails or stop that kind of dreaming, tina. one or the other.}
<A>__{the woman shuts the door behind her. tina looks back to her nightgown.}
<C>__{tina}
<P>__{(low)}
<D>__{oh, shit.}
<A>__{she suddenly snatches up the cross that hangs over her head, her face white as her sheet.}
