<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{full shot. planetarium. moonlight. a lone siren wails in distance. aside from this, all is very still. camera pans past the dome and settles on an isolated mansion set high on a hill nearby. stone balustrades drop down to sunken gardens where the grass has gone to seed around a waterless fountain. closer shot. mansion. night. a mediterranean villa with a large domed solarium which is connected to the main building by a low enclosed arcade. a crash and the falling of splintered glass is heard. long shot. promenade. shooting through pillars of the main entrance portico, down the long promenade outside arcade. two figures, seen in the distance, are disappearing through a window. camera tracks down promenade until it reaches a broken window through which jim is just disappearing. when he gets inside, he reaches back and takes his leather jacket which has been spread on the sill to protect them from splinters, shakes it out and puts it on. running footsteps are heard approaching. jim looks out nervously. plato bursts in, out of breath.}

<A>__{a match flares and lights a candle on an antique spanish candelabra. plato is revealed bending over it. he lights the other candles through the following:}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{we're safe here. i hope.}
<P>__{(holds up candelabra)}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(gazing around)}
<D>__{wow! well now there then!}
<A>__{his wonderment is justified. the floor of the arcade is marble and there are marble benches and neo roman busts lining the walls.}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{isn't it crazy?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{wowee ow wow! let's take it for the summer.}

<D>__{don't give it a thought. only three million dollars a month!}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{oh, we can manage that! i will scrimp and save and work my fingers to the bone...}
<C>__{jim}

<C>__{judy}
<D>__{there's just one thing. what about }
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{children? well, we really don't encourage them. they're so noisy and troublesome, don't you agree?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{yes. and so terribly annoying when they cry. i just don't know what to do when they cry, do you dear?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{of course. drown them like puppies.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{see, we're very modern.}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{shall i show you the nursery? it's far away from the rest of the house. if you have children oh i hate the word! or if you decide to adopt one they can carry on and you'll never even notice. in fact, if you lock them in you never have to see them again, much less talk to them.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{talk to them! heavens!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{nobody talks to children! they just tell them one thing and mean another.}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{it's wonderful that you understand so well and so young too! you know the most wonderful feature about the nursery?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{there's only one key.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{we'll take it!}
<C>__{plato}
<D>__{come on!}
<A>__{plato leads them away from us down the arcade, the candelabra casting wild shadows on the walls. they are laughing as they disappear through the glass doors at the end and their laughter echoes stonily.}
