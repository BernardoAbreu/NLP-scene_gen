<L>__{interior letty's room night}
<A>__{letty, crying, unpacks her duffel bag, laboriously smoothing and refolding every item she puts in the drawer. finishing her task, letty goes to the mirror and stares at her reflection. finally, she fixes her makeup. letty leaves her room. we follow her footsteps down the hallway. in the distance, letty sees the rec room. she hears the clamor of voices. every step is agony. letty stops herself just before entering, trying to collect herself.}

<D>__{fuck, i mean, anyone who color codes her panties has big problems.}
<A>__{letty freezes. michael rounds the corner. he stops when he sees her, falters, recovers his composure.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{hey there. they're showing "groundhog day" if you...}
