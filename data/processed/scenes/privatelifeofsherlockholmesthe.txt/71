<A>__{holmes removes his coat, turns to gabrielle.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{may i have your wedding ring, please?}
<A>__{gabrielle tearfully removes her ring, hands it to holmes. from his vest pocket he now produces valladon's ring the copper has a greenish tinge to it. he crosses to the window, compares the two rings in the light. gabrielle sinks down on the edge of one of the beds.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{just as i thought. there is a distinct difference in color between your ring and your husband's.}
