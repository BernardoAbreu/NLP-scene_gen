<L>__{int ext san simeon night}
<A>__{we float through the estate as we hear the ghostly strains of bunny berigan's recording of "i can't get started." it is a sad journey. by this time many of the ornate antiquities have been removed from the castle and it resembles welles' stark and dreary xanadu all the more.}
<C>__{bunny berigan}
<D>__{"i've flown around the world in a plane, i've settled revolutions in spain, and the north pole i have charted, still i can't get started with you...}
<A>__{we float past the private zoo, now empty, the cages hanging open. we move past the tennis courts, empty.}
<C>__{bunny berigan}
<D>__{"on the golf course i'm under par, metro goldwyn has asked me to star, i've got a house, a show place, still i can't get no place with you.}
<A>__{we float into the castle itself and through the stripped down screening room and the assembly room and the great dining hall. all are mere shadows of their past glory.}
<C>__{bunny berigan}
<D>__{"cause you're so supreme, lyrics i write of you, i dream, dream day and night of you and i scheme just for the sight of you, baby, what good does it do...?}
<A>__{we finally float into the ballroom a record of "i can't get started" spins forlornly on a turntable. and marion and hearst are having a quiet, poignant dance together in the middle of the empty ballroom.}
<C>__{bunny berigan}
<D>__{"i've been consulted by franklin d. greta garbo has had me to tea, still i'm broken hearted cause i can't get started with you.}
<A>__{they finally stop dancing and stand swaying gently. then they stop swaying.}
<C>__{hearst}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{ah, miss davies, the times we have seen}
<A>__{she holds him closely as "i can't get started" concludes}
