<C>__{arnie}
<D>__{she is relentless.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{she wants to have an affair with me.}
<C>__{arnie}
<D>__{she said that?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{pretty much.}
<C>__{arnie}
<D>__{oh yeah...}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{what is it about you?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(pushing over a napkin)}
<D>__{so could you write down her exact address?}
<C>__{arnie}

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it wouldnt really be cheating...}
<P>__{(off arnies doubtful look)}
<D>__{its complicated.}
<C>__{arnie}
<D>__{look, maybe im not as good a consigliere as you are but you have to trust me on this one. a little flirtations harmless but youre playing with fire here. the fidelity bank and trust is a tough creditor. you make a deposit somewhere else, they close your account forever.}

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hey, is that really necessary?}
<C>__{arnie}
<D>__{all im saying it there isnt a guy in union county who wouldnt give his left nut to be married to kate...}
<A>__{arnie takes one last swig of his beer and gets up...}
<C>__{arnie }
