<A>__{kate wraps herself in an old blanket and moves through the house turning off the lights. it is very guiet. all we hear are kate's footsteps and the sound of the clock ticking. she makes her way upstairs, enters her bed room. she sits down by the window at her desk. she sits a long time lost in thought. she slowly pulls open a drawer and from deep inside pulls out an old photo album. she opens it and begins to look through.}
