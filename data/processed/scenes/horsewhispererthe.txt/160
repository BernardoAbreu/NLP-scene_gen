<P>__{(to other twin)}
<D>__{come on. say good night and thank you...}
<A>__{voices everywhere. yelling. "thank you's!!" during which, grace quickly turns and exits. annie eyes follow her out of the room, but with her guests and the chaos, she doesn't know whether or not to leave.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{dinner was delicious. thank you.}
<P>__{(to twins)}
<D>__{say thank you!!}
<A>__{diane and frank usher the kids out. tom holds onto joe until they're gone, then lets him go.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{sorry, ma'am, i thank you for dinner. it was very good.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{did grace try to ride, joe?}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{i expect you should talk to grace about that, ma'am. and if i did anything wrong, then i am sorry.}
<A>__{ever the gentlemen, joe exits. annie looks to tom. he's about to leave, when he stops and says:}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{don't let her turn you away.}
<A>__{tom exits. annie stands and faces grace's closed door. slowly, she lowers herself to her knees and sits on them, thinking... reminiscent of tom, waiting for his moment with pilgrim, in the field.}
