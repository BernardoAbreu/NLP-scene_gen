<L>__{exterior jupiter two}
<A>__{the hull glows with electricity. the spiders fly off into space, their limbs and heads retracting.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{and the crowd goes wild.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{recall your nightmares from childhood, major. monsters are rarely so easily dissuaded.}
<A>__{(over) a thunk. then another. a third. on screen the spiders shoot webs from their bellies, attaching to the jupiter, land on the hull again, re extending their limbs, starting to burrow once more.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{persistent bastards.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{can you hit them again?}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{every time i electrify the hull, i'm draining our systems. once or twice more and we're going to be dead in space.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{a fate i fear may be inevitable one way or another.}
<A>__{maureen emerges from the airlock holding the spider's severed limb in metal tongs. carries it to her life sciences analyzer.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{that's the same expression you had when my mother came to stay with us.}
<A>__{maureen's monitor close. a graphic of the severed spider leg. a small line begins to extrapolate to the rest of the figure. musculature and flesh are drawn in on the screen.}
<C>__{maureen}
<D>__{dna extrapolation coming up. silicone based. admantium shell and lack of respiratory system suggest an ability to live in deep space. tiny front brain implies communal relationships. more like bees.}
<A>__{views creen close. more and more spider are spiraling from the probe ship, all heading toward the jupiter two.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{there are thousands of those things}
<A>__{maureen is working the computer.}
<C>__{maureen}
<D>__{they may be attracted to heat and light.}
<A>__{don begins typing.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{with the right command codes, i can light up the probe ship from here.}
<A>__{monitor close. more spiders are hitting the bull.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{damn. no response.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{command codes are sequenced. try the next series.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{but they won't work until the next fleet of ships are built. that's at least two years away.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{just do it.}
<A>__{don begins entering command codes. the mighty probe ship begins to power up, engines glowing red as they begin their initial burn.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{how did you know?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{think about it, don. the ships's advanced technology. your friend looking old. what if that ship is from our future?}
<C>__{computer}
<D>__{warning. outer hull has been compromised.}
<A>__{screen close. spiders are eating through the outer hull.}
<C>__{maureen}
<D>__{it's not working.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{can you get the fusion drive on line?}
