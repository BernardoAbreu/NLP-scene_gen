<L>__{interior main house servant's stairway morning}
<A>__{an enclosed stairway. chance enters, proceeds up the stairs.}
<L>__{interior main house upstairs hallway morning}
<A>__{chance comes out of a doorway adjoining the main staircase. he moves off down the hall.}
<L>__{interior main house old man's room morning}
<A>__{the furniture in this room is not covered with sheets but the old man is. there is a polite knock at the door, then chance enters the room. as chance moves slowly to the old man's bed, we sense a feeling of respect from chance, as well as a bit of curiosity. chance stands by the side of the bed for a moment, then he reaches down and gently pulls the sheet back from the old man's face. he touches the man's forehead, lightly, briefly, then replaces the sheet. chance moves to the tv (like the one in his own room) and turns it on. he sits in an easy chair next to the old man's bed and watches a movie from the early forties. chance puts an arm out, rests it on the old man's covered body. with the other, he changes the channels with the remote control. he returns to the channel with the forties movie and seems to become absorbed in a scene in which a gentleman tips his hat to a lady. the scene seems to have 'sunk into' his mind.}
