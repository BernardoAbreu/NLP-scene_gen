<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{living room the royal suite rakonin, the waiter, opens the door. ninotchka and leon, both very tipsy by now, enter the room. leon is carrying a bottle of champagne in a napkin. as he passes the waiter he speaks:}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(to rakonin)}
<D>__{all right... you can tell the duchess... you can tell everybody... they know anyhow... it doesn't make any difference... now get out!}
<A>__{rakonin, who seems very interested in the situation, closes the door. leon goes to ninotchka. both sit on a couch.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(moving close to him)}
<D>__{don't tell them where we're going, sweetheart.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{no. nobody will find us.}
<A>__{ninotchka is lyrically tight. through her there shines a great happiness.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{are we going to build our little house?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{yes... a little white house.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{not white, darling.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{all right, we'll make it red.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{no, don't let's have it any color... no color... just a house house... let's form our own party.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{right: lovers of the world unite!}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(delighted)}
<D>__{and we won't stretch up our arms...}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{no! no!}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{...and we won't clench our fist...}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{no! no!}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(tenderly)}
<D>__{our salute will be a kiss.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{yes... a kiss... salute!}
<A>__{she sinks into his arms and they kiss.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(still in his arms)}
<D>__{i am so happy. no one can be so happy without being punished. i will be punished and i should be punished.}
<P>__{(she gets up)}
<D>__{i want to confess, darling.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{i know... it's the russian soul.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(her gaiety mixed with sadness)}
<D>__{everyone wants to confess and if they don't confess they make them confess. i am a traitor. when i kissed you i betrayed the russian ideal. leon, i should be stood up against the wall.}
<A>__{leon gets up.}
<C>__{leon}
<P>__{(sympathetically)}
<D>__{would that make you any happier?}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{much happier.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{all right.}
<A>__{still carrying the champagne bottle, leon leads her to the end of the room and stands her against the wall. he takes the napkin from the champagne bottle and puts it over her eyes. the camera moves with him as he goes away from ninotchka, and as he walks he starts to open the champagne. the cork pops. close shot ninotchka, as she sinks gently into a chair.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(happily)}
<D>__{i have paid the penalty. now let's have some music.}
<A>__{close shot ninotchka and leon}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{let's turn on the radio.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{radio! what is radio?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{it's a little box that you buy on the installment plan and before you tune it in they tell you they have a new model.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(getting up)}
<D>__{oh yes, yes. it has a little knob that turns... a little knob... it must be somewhere around here... yes... here... i see...}
<A>__{confusedly ninotchka starts looking for something, repeating, "a little knob... a little knob." followed by leon she goes toward the safe, opens the concealing door, and both are delighted as they see the safe's dial.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(triumphantly)}
<D>__{here it is!}
<A>__{leon nods approval and starts to turn the dial.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{what shall we get? the news!}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<D>__{no, no news. we don't want to know what's happening in the world. we want to be left alone, don't we?}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{yes, sweetheart... all by ourselves.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(remembering vaguely)}
<D>__{well, then we turn twice to the right and stop at seven...}
<A>__{leon follows her instructions.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(after a little pause, sadly)}
<D>__{it's dead.}
<C>__{leon}
<D>__{well, it has to warm up... you have to give it a chance... just like people... like you and me... first you wanted to fight me and now we belong to the same party... salute!}
<A>__{he takes her in his arms and again they embrace.}
<C>__{ninotchka}
<P>__{(as though she were in heaven)}
<D>__{now twice to the left and stop at seventeen.}
<A>__{leon again follows her instructions.}
