<L>__{interior cinema. night revised on set 5 31 05}
<A>__{dark theater, movie in progress. wobbly porno music. a thin audience of raincoat artists. the door opens and costello enters. he moves slowly down the aisle and sees: colin sitting alone. he sits down in front of colin. costello is wearing the dildo. he watches the movie, moaning.}
<C>__{costello}

<D>__{i have to find the guy you have in the department.}
<C>__{costello}
<D>__{with everybody looking up their own ass and you looking for yourself, i put my money on nobody finding nothing.}
<A>__{we see in colin's face hurt and hatred for costello. his idol doesn't like him.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{frank, for me, you've got to lay low.}
<C>__{costello}
<D>__{laying low is not what i do.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{yeah, big fuckin' daddy frank. lookit, frank, what good am i to you if you don't listen to me? queenan's compartmentalizing. he's fuckin' smart, you know that. i will find this rat if you let me do it my way. if you let me do my job.}
<C>__{costello}
<D>__{okay.}
<P>__{(gives him the envelope)}
<D>__{but colin, i hope i won't have to remind you, that if you don't find that cheese eating rat bastard in your department so we can give him a halo, most likely it won't be me who pays for it.}
<A>__{colin nods, sweat on his lip.}
<C>__{colin}
<D>__{why would you need to remind me of that? i didn't know that would i be any good at what i do? trust me, i know how to do this.}
<C>__{colin }
<D>__{it involves lying, and i'm pretty fucking good at that, right?}
<C>__{costello}
<P>__{(looking at the screen)}
<D>__{maybe it's because it's always been so easy for me to get cunt that i never understood jerking off in a theatre.}
<A>__{costello gets up to go.}
<C>__{costello }
<D>__{who knows what's easy? collie, take care of business.}
<A>__{the door opens again at the back of the theater and we see: billy in a dark back seat. costello, after hesitating as colin sweats, shoves the brown envelope to colin, and goes. billy receives a text message: "get visual id suspect." he slumps in his seat as costello marches up the aisle and out of the theater. he has barely recovered from this when: the dark shape of colin is moving rapidly towards and through the emergency exit beside the screen. billy follows.}
