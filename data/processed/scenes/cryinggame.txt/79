<D>__{and what if i say no?}
<C>__{jude}
<D>__{you know what. go.}
<A>__{down by the brothel, the door swings open. fergus walks like any pedestrian down toward the brothel. there is an old, portly gent in a city suit emerging from it. the car by the pavement kicks into action and the door opens. fergus quickens his pace. jude, by the cafe, watches. fergus, walking. the gent makes his way, with gout ridden slowness, across the pavement, through the passersby, toward the car. a burly security man emerging from the car, walking toward the old gent. fergus reaches the car just before he does, and passes between him and the open door. the old gent's stomach brushes fergus's elbow.}
<C>__{gent}
<D>__{pardon me, young man }
<A>__{fergus walks on. jude, from the cafe, watches fergus walking on, the old man being eased with painstaking care inside the daimler. then the door closing and the daimler pulling off. when the daimler has passed fergus, he turns around and walks back. jude smiles and leaps up as he approaches.}
