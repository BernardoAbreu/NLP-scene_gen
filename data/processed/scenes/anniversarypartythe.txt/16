<C>__{sally}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{panes}
<D>__{she could be playing the role in joe's movie that should be yours.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{fuck you, panes.}
<C>__{panes}
<D>__{you see, that's worse.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i just wanted tonight to be with the people we love.}
<C>__{panes}
<D>__{like your business managers?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{they're not just our business managers, panes.}
<C>__{panes}
<D>__{oh, okay, forgive me. your neighbors are here, for fuck's sake.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{exactly what i mean. it's all ruined.}
<C>__{panes}
<D>__{it's not ruined, for fuck's sake. it's one of your parties.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i don't want it to be just one of our parties.}
<C>__{panes}
<D>__{"how are you really doing, panes?" "lousy, thank you, i'm falling apart."}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{like the last time.}
<C>__{panes}
<D>__{no. no, not like the last time. she was the rest of my life.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{like the last time.}
<C>__{panes}
<D>__{i wasn't finished.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{panes}
<D>__{"we can't stand seeing you like this, panes. i hate you being alone. why don't you stay with us for a while?" "i'd love to, thanks."}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{it's our anniversary, panes.}
<C>__{panes}
<D>__{i didn't hear me say tonight.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{we're just feeling our way back.}
<C>__{panes}
<D>__{"otherwise, we'd insist on your being here."}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{you know it's true.}
<A>__{skye bursts into the kitchen, sally and panes freeze.}
<C>__{skye}
<P>__{(stuck)}
<D>__{oh my god, sorry. i'm interrupting.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i will be right out.}
<C>__{panes}
<P>__{(over sally)}
<D>__{come on in.}
<C>__{skye}
<D>__{i'm in the same room with sally nash. oh my god. you're my icon. i've been watching your films since i was a little girl. like, four years ago i followed you all around the beverly center at least half a day, working up the courage to introduce myself.}
<A>__{joe enters the kitchen, watches.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i don't think i ever spent half a day in the beverly center.}
<C>__{skye}
<D>__{whatever, do you remember? i've seen all your movies. when i was in rehab, the second time, they wouldn't even let us see your drug addict movie. they said you were too real. i worship you. and i couldn't be more flattered, because i know the part i'm playing in joe's movie is based on you as a young woman.}
<A>__{joe winces, uncomfortable, picks up the bottle of wine and leaves.}
<C>__{skye }
<D>__{and i'm overwhelmed. and i want to do it justice. and i hope we can spend time together. and i'm gushing. it's my worst quality.}
<C>__{panes}
<D>__{not at all.}
<C>__{skye}
<D>__{oh my god. i've been so rude. i'm skye davidson. has anyone ever told you, you look like peter sellers?}
<C>__{panes}
<D>__{no, never.}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(overlapping panes)}
<D>__{everyday.}
<C>__{panes}
<D>__{i'm levi panes. will you excuse us, skye? it's time for sally's meds.}
<A>__{panes steers sally out of the kitchen.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{it's nice to meet you... again.}
<A>__{they go. skye is left in the kitchen alone.}
<C>__{skye}
<P>__{(to america)}
<D>__{oh my god, she remembers me!}
