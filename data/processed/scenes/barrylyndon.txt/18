<L>__{exterior road late day}
<A>__{grogan walks with roderick.}
<C>__{captain grogan}
<D>__{a pretty day's work of it you have made, master roderick. knowing your uncle to be distressed for money, and try and break off a match which will bring fifteen hundred a year into the family? best has promised to pay off the four thousand pounds which is bothering your uncle so. he takes a girl without a penny a girl that has been flinging herself at the head of every man in these parts these ten years past, and missing them all, and a boy who ought to be attached to your uncle as to your father.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{and so i am.}
<C>__{captain grogan}
<D>__{and this is the return you make for his kindness! didn't he harbor you in his house when your father died, and hasn't he given you and your mother, rent free, your fine house of jamesville yonder?}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{mark this, come what will of it, i swear i will fight the man who pretends to the hand of dorothy dugan. i will follow him if it's into the church, and meet him there. i will have his blood, or he shall have mine. will you take my message to him, and arrange the meeting?}
<C>__{captain grogan}
<D>__{well, if it must be, it must. for a young fellow, you are the most bloodthirsty i ever saw. no officer, bearing his majesty's commission, can receive a glass of wine on his nose, without resenting it fight you must, and best is a huge, strong fellow.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{he'll give the better mark. i am not afraid of him.}
<C>__{captain grogan}
<D>__{in faith, i believe you are not; for a lad i never saw more game in my life. give me a kiss, my dear boy. you're after my own soul. as long as jack grogan lives, you shall never want a friend or a second.}
<A>__{they embrace.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{poor fellow! he was shot six months afterwards, at minden, and i lost thereby a kind friend. but we don't know what is in store for us, and that's a blessing.}
