<A>__{cyclotron room (credit sequence) day a mighty warning klaxon assaults our ears. a flashing red warning light stabs our eyes. several dials go into the red. a hand pushes aside a yellow thermos and pushes forward a red power throttle. we hear the whining up of a cyclotron. a digital dial climbs to "5% power." a spider crawls across a dial. begin opening credits. the cyclotron room is in an old basement full of peeling paint and plumbing wrapped with tape. leaks are here and there. cobwebs are all around. doctor otto octavius (ock) is a strong but strange featured man in his mid fifties. his assistant, weiner, hovers nearby looking on. he's open mouthed with a mindless kind of curiosity. weiner is a local, small time hood hired by ock to circumvent the school administration and to "procure" whatever ock needs for his experiments. he shades his eyes against a searing blue white beam that erupts from the window. the room is}

<A>__{but ock is already at the throttle. the cyclotron whirls up. the lights go on. louder, brighter than before. ock looks through the broken window into the experimental chamber. the power dial inches upward, "eight, nine..." the blue white light is blinding now. the whine pitch is shattering.}
