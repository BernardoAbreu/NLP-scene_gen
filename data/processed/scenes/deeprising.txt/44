<A>__{a group of tony british passengers is shooting skeet. being night, the clay pigeons are glow in the dark. they explode over the watersports platform, where two jet skis swing from harnesses, and two speedboats are being hoisted up the side.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior crystal pool deck night}
<A>__{rigged for a formal party. chinese lanterns sway in the breeze. a band plays. hundreds of wealthy passengers, the men in tuxedos, the women in drop dead gowns, dripping with jewelry, dance, flirt, gossip, as an endless stream of waiters ply the floor with champagne laden trays. close on: the sexiest pair of spiked heels ever to grace the foot of a woman, stopping at the top of the deck. pan up: a shimmering golden gown, high slit on the sides to reveal a perfect set of legs, a runway model's body, a cover girl's face...and a thief's sharp ferret eyes. trillian. a class act from top to bottom. a head turner for either sex, and knows it. she holds an orchid in her hand. trillian scans the crowd, looking for her prey...and finds him. her pov. the ship's smug captain. jean baptiste delcroix. she fixes the orchid in her hair just so, about to move...}
<C>__{old woman}
<D>__{he said an orchid and a beautiful woman belonged together... it was our first date.}
<A>__{trillian looks down to a petite old woman, dressed impeccably, delicate, frail, her beauty long faded except from her eyes. kindness becomes her, like moonlight does the night.}
<C>__{old woman }
<D>__{he said that it was the orchid i wore that made him fall in love with me...}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{he sounds like a real gentleman.}
<C>__{old woman}
<D>__{the best of the best he was... this cruise was supposed to be our 60th anniversary gift to each other. he died last spring...}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{i'm so sorry...}
<C>__{old woman}
<D>__{i was going to wear one...special for him...like a memory...}
<A>__{the old woman looks at the orchid. and then at trillian.}
<C>__{old woman }
<D>__{but without him here i don't know why i should.}
<A>__{trillian takes the orchid from her hair, and places it in the lapel of the woman's jacket.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{because an orchid and a beautiful woman belong together.}
<A>__{the smile trillian bestows on the old woman is loving, sincere. the moment between them is broken by the keen clear sound of a silver spoon tapping a crystal champagne flute.}
<C>__{canton }
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen...}
<A>__{angle on: the deck where the band stops playing. voices hush. everyone turns to nigel canton, 65, tall, elegant, every white hair perfectly in place, impeccably turned out, with the energy, and enthusiasm of a man half his age. canton stands at the head of the pool, in front of a wall sized aquarium, flanked by his captain.}
<C>__{canton }
<D>__{all my life i had the dream of building the greatest pleasure ship ever to sail the seven seas... tonight, seeing all of you here...so elegant...so beautiful...so rich...}
<A>__{the crowd roars with laughter.}
<C>__{canton }
<D>__{i realize my dream has come true...i thank you all from the bottom of my heart for making it so...}
<A>__{canton lifts his glass.}
<C>__{canton }
<D>__{to the fuji maru! good times forever!}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{forever!! here! here!}
<A>__{the crowd swells around canton. angle on: the captain chatting up some passengers when a woman's voice, seductive, beguiling, turns his head to...}
<C>__{trillian}
<P>__{(french)}
<D>__{is it true what they say about a captain and his boat.}
<A>__{the captain's libido rises as he gazes into trillian's come hither eyes.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{is what true madame?}
<A>__{trillian takes one step closer, until her moist lips are pursed inches from the captain's.}
<C>__{trillian}
<P>__{(french)}
<D>__{madamoiselle...that the bigger the boat...the bigger the man...}
<A>__{his breath catches.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{it is a theory i would be glad to put to the test.}
<A>__{trillian draws even closer. if looks could cause a man to climax.}
<C>__{trillian}
<P>__{(french)}
<D>__{in school, the sisters said testing was my specialty.}
<C>__{passenger}
<D>__{captain...}
<A>__{driven to distraction, the captain turns his attention for a moment to a passenger introducing his wife.}
<C>__{passenger }
<D>__{my wife...}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{enchante...}
<A>__{angle on: trillian, turning from the captain into the crowd. c.u. on her hand by the side of her dress. a man's wallet held surreptitiously. her fingers open the wallet, extract a thin gold card with a black stripe. she discards the wallet, keeps the card, and disappears into the crowd.}
