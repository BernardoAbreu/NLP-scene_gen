<A>__{they walk through the murky darkness of paris' backstreets.}

<D>__{it is good to be out on a mission again... we are out on a mission, aren't we?}
<A>__{aramis grunts non committally, lost in thought.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{you're right. tell porthos nothing. he needs to know nothing, for he is useless.}
<A>__{just as he says this a sinister form steps from the shadows and blocks their way. he holds a knife. another robber with a sword rises from a doorway beside them.}
<C>__{robber}
<D>__{your money or your life.}
<A>__{aramis looks bored; porthos stands blinking in surprise. then a third robber steps up behind them, cocking a pistol.}
<C>__{third robber}
<D>__{make it quick, old man!}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{old? old?! you're all trying to rob us because you think we're old?}
<A>__{the man with a sword steps forward to hack porthos down, but porthos spins, slapping the pistol, making it boom but miss; he kicks the swordsman in the groin, then smashes his head against the alley wall; he backhands the gunman. the robber with the knife tries to run; porthos snatches a barrel from the street and hurls it into the fleeing robber's back; he falls in a heap. porthos' fury has just begun. he picks the fallen gunman up by the throat, slams him stomach down across a broken alley cart, and with one sweep of his mighty hand porthos snatches down the man's pants.}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{old?! i will show you old!!}
<A>__{porthos snatches the pistol from the cobblestones. we see the shock and terror on the robber's face as he feels something shocking happen behind him.}

<D>__{let's see you rob somebody with your pistol there!}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{come on...}
<A>__{aramis, acting as if nothing happened, leads porthos away.}
