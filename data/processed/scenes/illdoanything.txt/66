<L>__{interior apartment building evening}
<A>__{as he leads jeannie briskly down the hall from lucy's apartment and into his own.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{why couldn't you even look at the way i dressed ricky?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{look, i don't want to talk about it. i just had a real rough day... so just let it sit there, okay?}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{but what was it? tellll me... compromise... you sad?}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(through gritted neck cords)}
<D>__{now, i really need to be quiet.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<P>__{(eyes him, then)}
<D>__{you!! i know what will cheer you up.}
<A>__{moving very quickly and with great purpose, she slaps a tape into a pink child's cassette player and music begins... jeannie sings along with the child's chorus on the tape, "you could be wonderful", making, with little hand motions, the last thing matt needs, but, in due course, he starts to actually make a bit of transitional progress out of his own troubles and into the fact that his daughter is beguiling. but, before the mood can fully sweeten, jeannie forgets the lyrics and begins to verbally assault herself as the tape continues to play...}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{i can't even remember the words... i am stupid.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{no, you're not. you're not stupid and i'm not bitter... and you know why? because there's no cure for either one and we've got to believe in some cure for each of us.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{i am stupid. i can't even remember the words to some baby song.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{oh, jeannie... i just can't do this now.}
<A>__{the phone rings... as he goes to answer it...}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{hello? yes. cathy... hey. just a second.}
<A>__{his mood has changed. it's a fine sign that cathy has called him at home. he needs only for his child to take pity and listen to him.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{jeannie, please... be quiet for one second... this is very important for me.}
<A>__{she decides, with some difficulty, to let him continue.}
<C>__{matt}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{so? wow. good for you. congratulations.}
<A>__{jeannie mouths the words, "who is it?" matt holds up a finger asking her to wait.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{me? this is great. i will come right over and pick up the script. okay. if you want to. bring it over. goodbye.}
<P>__{(to jeannie)}
<D>__{we might make it yet, kid.}
