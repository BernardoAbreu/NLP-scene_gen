<L>__{interior joey's living room night}
<A>__{robinson makes his move. his arms are a blur, swinging rapidly but accurately. joey and lenore are suddenly silent.}
<C>__{tv announcer}
<D>__{lamotta's on queer street, but he's still standing. robinson throws a right, a left, a right, a right and a right again! how can lamotta stay on his feet?}
<A>__{on the tv, we see that robinson has jake up against the ropes. he's giving jake a pier six beating. it's the fox fight for real. jake's face is so soaked in blood that it's impossible to pinpoint the cuts.}
<C>__{tv announcer }
<D>__{no man can take this kind of punishment. lamotta is just a rag doll now. god knows what's holding him up. this is an historic beating. sugar rav staggers lamotta with a left and comes across with a blackjack punch to the champion's head. the referee is stepping in, robinson has lamotta on the ropes. that's it! sugar ray robinson, former welterweight champion, has taken the middleweight crown from jake lamota.}
<A>__{as the referee stops the fight, joey sighs with relief.}
