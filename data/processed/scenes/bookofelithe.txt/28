<L>__{interior palladium main lobby continuous}
<A>__{carnegie emerges from the bedroom onto the balcony. looks down over the railing and is stunned by what he sees. chaos in the bar below. eli cutting a one man swath of mayhem through the dozen brawlers. most already lie dead. two more men attack eli and are effortlessly felled by his sword. carnegie rushes hurriedly along the landing, banging loudly on the doors of the upstairs rooms.}
<C>__{carnegie}
<D>__{get your asses out here!}
<A>__{on eli. surrounded by the dead, only one man left standing. hog. he backs away as eli circles him like a predator. sword held ready, the blade glistening with dark red blood. solara re emerges from the back room with eli's refilled canteen. she stops and emits a horrified gasp when she sees the bloody carnage laid out in the bar before her. she watches, mortified, as eli moves toward the helpless, terrified hog, going in for the kill. raising his sword... suddenly, solara steps forward and cries out:}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{stop!}
<A>__{eli freezes. sword hanging in the air, poised to strike. he turns his head to where solara stands behind the bar.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{please don't.}
<A>__{beat as eli considers. he looks back at hog, still completely at his mercy... and then lowers the sword.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{go.}
<C>__{hog}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{...what?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it ain't for me to judge you. your time for that's gonna come. believe me. now go on. get out of here.}
<A>__{hog stumbles backward through the door, into the sunlight. eli moves toward solara, who stands petrified behind the bar. reaches out and gently pries the canteen from her loose grip.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{in the exitway, hog turns back inside, grabbing up a broken bottle from the bloody floor as he goes. hog rushes eli from behind. solara sees him coming and goes to scream but before any sound can come, eli flips his sword backward and hog runs right onto it, skewering himself. beat. hog just stands there for a moment, eyes wide, frozen in shock. his fingers go limp, dropping the bottle. he slides off the sword and collapses to the floor, dead. eli wipes the sword clean and sheathes it. looks around at the bloodied, fallen bodies. then back at solara.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i'm sorry for all the mess.}
<A>__{as he turns and heads toward the door:}
<C>__{carnegie }
<D>__{hold it right there.}
<A>__{accompanied by the sound of multiple guns cocking. carnegie is on the landing, training his rifle down at eli. alongside him, five gunmen do the same. they've got him cold.}
