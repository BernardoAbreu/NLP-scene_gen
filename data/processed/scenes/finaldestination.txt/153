<L>__{interior cabin night crack beneath door}
<A>__{the resulting thunder rumbles. a breeze blows beneath the door, carrying some autumn leaves. camera follows the breeze across the floor to alex's pant legs which slightly flutter. camera rises to alex, sitting in his safe chair. paranoid and obsessively cautious, his eyes move towards the door, anticipating the consequential events. following the path of the breeze, alex turns around... alex's pov trash bag the brown shopping bag tips over. amongst the trash spread on the floor, a can rolls out and across the floor.}
<B>__{alex}
<A>__{tenses. he doesn't look to where the can has been, but where it is going. alex's pov can rolls across the floor and gently hits the end of a fishing pole, propped in the corner. the pole teeters and falls over.}
<B>__{fishing hook}
<A>__{falls, hooking a closet door. the door begins to swing open.}
<B>__{alex}
<A>__{is quickly out of his safe chair, hustling towards...}
<B>__{the door}
<A>__{alex slams the door shut before it can open. behind the door, a crash as something falls. alex cracks a wicked half smile, cocky he has caught death before this attempt has brought to fruition. alex removes the hook from the door and places the pole on the floor. he cautiously opens the door, revealing an old fish scaling knife embedded on the back side of the door, unaware. removing the knife and securing it, his eyes turn towards the floor.}
<B>__{closet floor}
<A>__{a tackle box has spilled thick, rusted old treble and aberdeen fishing hooks upon the floor. alex bends down and examines them.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(as if to death)}
<D>__{rusted. tetanus. nice touch.}
<P>__{(defiant)}
<D>__{i overlooked it. you tried to capitalize. but i caught you, you fuck. i can beat you. not forever, but i got this cabin rigged to beat you now!}
<A>__{o.s., a sound. like a thump near the cabin steps. he freezes, like an animal sensing danger. thunder rumbles. the light around him begins to flicker and sway.}
<B>__{coleman lantern}
<A>__{a draft creeps beneath the glass enclosure. the flame, dancing.}
