<A>__{murnau's office kafka tries not to flinch in the presence of this deadly figure.}
<C>__{murnau}
<D>__{ you seem amused.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{it only amuses me in that it gives me an insight into the ludicrous bungling that in some circumstances may decide the life of a human being.}
<A>__{ekman sighs as if at a difficult child.}
<C>__{murnau}
<D>__{it's merely a matter of expediency. it's imperative that my room to maneuver not be hindered by ... bureaucratic ramifications.}
<A>__{ekman, who doesn't hear very well, directs one ear in particular back and forth between the other two. kafka just keeps looking at the charismatic man pacing around him who's now lighting an expensive cigarette of the kind that was in the ashtray at the lab.}
<C>__{murnau}
<D>__{ if an obscure official up there in the distant mountains so far away from civilizing influences happens to meet with an unfortunate accident and should he tragically die in spite of the district medical officer's strenuous efforts to save him the firm wants to see the next of kin pacified and the disposition of the remains handled with the greatest possible ... efficiency.}

<D>__{i believe we've exceeded his expectations.}

<P>__{(virtually to himself)}
<D>__{i had the grandest of financial plots in mind, the most malevolent of personal motives, conspiracy theories extending to every ... authority i could see.}

<C>__{murnau}
<D>__{life is more than a chinese puzzle, my friend.}
