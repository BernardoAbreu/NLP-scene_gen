<L>__{exterior compound of u.s. outpost #31}
<A>__{a large, almost snow covered building. not far from that a tall, meteorological balloon tower. a scattering of several small shacks at varying distances from the main compound. the smaller hovels are connected by wooden planked walkways and steadying ropes. multicolored pennants stick put of the snow marking pathways and directions to outdoor experiments. a tractor and two helicopters sit idle, covered with mounds of continuously mounting snow. two men, norris and bennings standing some thirty yards from the main building are in the process of letting up a large red balloon. childs, a hefty black man, is twenty yards away tinkering with a snowmobile. their beards are caked with ice. it is winter and it is harsh. the faint sound of the copter turns their attention.}
<B>__{the copter}
<A>__{flying ever lower now. the man with the gun leans dangerously outside and fires away at the dog as it nears the outpost.}
<B>__{the men}
<A>__{outside the compound look to one another, incredulous.}
<B>__{the copter}
<A>__{much too low now, and chastised by the wind, attempts a high speed landing, directly on the heels of the sprinting dog. it bounces violently on the hard packed surface. once. twice. passing the dog. a third bounce sends it skidding. it flips; its blades snapping off like toothpicks. it lands belly up, soundless except for the whine of its engine. the man with the gun rolls out before the explosion.}
