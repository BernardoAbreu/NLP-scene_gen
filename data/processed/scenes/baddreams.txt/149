<L>__{interior cynthia's room a few minutes later}
<A>__{alan comes to. the alarms and bells are still ringing. cynthia and berrisford are gone.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{shit!}
<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{the corridors are run amuck with isolation patients (the worst kind) all escaped from their rooms. alan runs out of cynthia's room. he is surrounded by bizarre looking people screaming, singing, dancing, praying. hettie is by the stairway helping isolation patients exit.}
<C>__{hettie}
<D>__{one at a time! no pushing! please do not use the elevator!}
<A>__{alan is frantically looking for cynthia and berrisford, checking everywhere, pushing open doors. the security guards are at the far end of the hallway. alan goes to hettie.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{where's berrisford?}
<C>__{hettie}
<D>__{this is your fault! these goddamn doors won't re lock!}
<C>__{alan}
<P>__{(furious )}
<D>__{where is he? he's going to kill cynthia! tell me where he is!}
<C>__{hettie}
<D>__{i haven't seen him!}
<A>__{the guards see alan. they come after him. he runs. alan scans every room. he slams into patients. the guards aren't far behind. alan turns a corner, passing a door marked "not an exit: roof access." it is ajar. he goes in without the guards seeing him.}
