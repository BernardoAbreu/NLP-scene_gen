<L>__{interior massive conference room day}
<A>__{a mind blowingly pretentious painting of darwin, minerva, and bunny hangs above a mammoth m shaped conference table. lying atop the table in heels, shades, and a heart stopping dark outfit is minerva. nasty metal riffs semi audibly spew from a headset she wears. surrounding the table is a varied group of old money and new money board members ranging from a nine year old indian prince to a sweet elderly american woman. they converse to the person at their side in businesslike tones, oblivious to minerva.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen of the board...}
<A>__{the board members go into tableau silence. minerva con tinues a brief sing a long before darwin scolds...}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{and min er va. let's give it up for hudson hawk.}
<A>__{the board applauds as alfred pushes hawk inside.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{hello......bunny, ball ball!}
<A>__{minerva lobs a ball in the air. bunny, the annoying dog, scurries beside hawk to catch it. moving down toward the other end of the table, hawk takes in the surreal surroundings with battle fatigue. he sees one board member take a luxurious sip of cappuccino. minerva paces up upon the table.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{hawkmeister, we got you clothes, great hotel, and a 250,000 lira per diem.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{that's two hundred dollars a day? so he can get a hooker and some tequila. veto, darwin.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{guess i know who wears the penis in this family.}
<C>__{minerva}
<P>__{(jumping off table)}
<D>__{for god's sake, chain this convict.}
<A>__{with a yawn, alfred pulls out a pair of state of the art handcuffs.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{alfred, you're a very polite psychopath, but if you...}
<A>__{hawk kicks out at alfred, who nimbly moves slightly and gives a pummel to hawk's body somersaulting him over the edge of the table, into an empty seat. the board members politely applaud. alfred pulls hawk's hands around his back and cuffs him. bunny intensely sniffs his crotch.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{we want da vinci's sketchbook, what do they call it, the codex.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{listen hawk, this might be hard to believe, but i'm a regular joe. i just want to be happy and happiness comes from the achieving of goals. it's just when you make your first billion by the age of 19, it's hard to keep coming up with new ones. but now finally i got my new goal. world domination. with your help...bunny....quit that!}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{bunny, ball ball! bad bunny!}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{think he's already got today's ball balls. five more minutes please, it's been so long...}
<A>__{minerva yanks away the yelping dog.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{anybody have a cigarette? but seriously, do me a favor and concorde me back to prison. i don't care anymore. i hope you have the receipts for the threads.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{you go back, you won't be alone. you'll have a diabetic barkeep cellmate. you're still young enough to have fun shanking child molesters for a pack of smokes, but "alex" will go in knowing that the next time he gets out it'll be to attend his own funeral. depressing.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{you wouldn't risk the dime to call the police. you have no proof.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{ah, the magic word...}
<A>__{alfred plants a slide machine on the table and darwin starts clicking gorgeous images of hawk and alex robbing the auction house, on a bare wall. the board members gush. the elderly woman gives a thumbs up.}
<C>__{darwin}
<D>__{it's veja du, hawkhead. something you wish never happened. we shot the entire operation with hidden cameras behind the hidden cameras. hired the guy who did the last sports illustrated swimsuit issue. excellent work... whoops, damn fotomat assholes...}
<A>__{a slide hits the wall of himself and minerva kneeling in big baby clothes with alfred snarling over them, decked out in leather. he clicks ahead... hawk looks away and sees that the board members have an annual report type booklet in front of them that reads the da vinci alchemy project. minerva leans over in front of him.}
<C>__{minerva}
<D>__{tomorrow, you're going to hit a church.}
