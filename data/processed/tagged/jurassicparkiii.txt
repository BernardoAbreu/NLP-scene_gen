<L>__{exterior boat day}
<A>__{ben and eric clamber onto a makeshift platform that hangs over the back of the board. dangling from ben's neck is a camcorder.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you make sure to get us as close as you can, okay? if it's a good trip, i will give you a little extra.}
<C>__{enrique}
<D>__{don't worry. i take you close. but not too close.}
<P>__{(rubbing eric's head)}
<D>__{you don't want them to eat you.}
<A>__{enrique heads toward the driver's seat and a large second hand winch bolted to the deck.}
<C>__{enrique }
<D>__{ready, amigos?}
<A>__{ben and eric nod excitedly and give the thumbs up. ben lifts the camcorder to the record the action. enrique jams the down the throttle down, and with a loud raor, the speedboat shoots forward. soon the boat is whipping across the rolling ocean. strapped together, ben and eric lean back over the passing water, intently watching for enrique's signal. as the boat picks up speed, enrique eyes the speedometer. ben grabs the end of the ripcord attached to the harness. he and eric braces themselves. enrique finally signals with a pulling motion. he pulls the winch, ben yanks the cord and wooosh! a brightly colored parasail blossoms behind the boat, hoisting ben and eric aloft. in a big block letters on the parasail is stitched "dino soar." the townline unsold rapidly from its enormous reel. ben and eric climb higher and higher. enrique keeps an eye on the clients. when they reach a certain height, he locks off the reel. high overhead, ben and eric are floating in wonderful, quiet splendor. the motor of the boat now sounds strangely distant. down below, the boat enters a think blanket of fog. eric points excitedly at the islands as ben films him with the camera. then, a sudden tug on the thing line cause ben to drop the camera, which now dangles from his neck.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{what was that?}
<A>__{a second tug...and now the faintest of screams. ben and eric look down to find that the boat has disappeared into the low bank of fog. by the time the boat emerges on the far side of the mist...their is no sign of enrique. the deck is splattered with blood. as ben considers the driverless boat...}
<C>__{eric }
<D>__{ben!}
<A>__{ben glances over at eric, staring in horror at something below. following his gaze, ben finds that their boat is only moments away from crashing into a large reef. sticking out of the water, the imposing reef is being battered by waves. as the boat smashes into the reef, it splinters into a number of pieces. a panicked ben turns to eric.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{unclip your line!}
<A>__{eric and ben frantically unclip their lines. catching an updraft, the parasailers float upward. a strong wind sends them wafting over the daunting cliffs of isla sorna...}
<L>__{exterior suburban backyard day}
<A>__{two plastic dinosaurs enter the frame and do battle accompanied by a child's ferocious sounds.}
<C>__{child }
<D>__{rrrrrow! grrrrrr!}
<A>__{winder to reveal charlie, a three year old boy, plays in a sandbox with his favorite toy dinosaurs. alan grant squats next to him and watches with great delight. ellie satler stands over them, an infant in her arms a picture of the perfect family.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{oh, actually, charlie, those two are herbivores. they wouldn't be interested in fighting each other. but these...}
<P>__{(picking up two other dinosaurs)}
<D>__{see, these are carnivores. and this one here see its claws this one here uses its claws to gouge at the throat of its opponent...}
<A>__{as grant demonstrates with some grunt and groans of his own, he only succeeds in frightening the boy.}
<C>__{ellie}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{uh, alan?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{hmm?}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{he's three. why don't you wait till he's a little older?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{oh, right.}
<P>__{(back to charlie)}
<D>__{happy dinosaurs.}
<A>__{he bounces them along the sandbox edge. then, the sound of a car engine turning off and a door slamming is heard.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{that must be mark.}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{mark, were back here!}
<A>__{ellie and grant turn to see mark degler coming through the gate carrying a briefcase. he's their age, handsome but not annoyingly so, with a friendly, balance demeanor. he and ellie kiss tenderly on the lips.}
<C>__{ellie }
<D>__{good day?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{keeping the world safe.}
<P>__{(re: baby)}
<D>__{here, let me take her.}
<A>__{ellie hands off the baby.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{mark, this is alan grant.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{nice to meet you, alan. i've heard a lot about you.}
<A>__{the two men shake hands, and we now realize it is grant who is the stranger in this household. little charlie runs to his father, showing his dinosaur.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{daddy, this is a herbabore.}
<A>__{grant smiles uncomfortably, a third wheel.}
<L>__{interior dining room night}
<A>__{winden to a parrot in a large cage. grant is teasing the bird with a cookie, holding a it just out of reach.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{what's my name? come on, jack, say it. is my name alan? say my name. the bird doesn't respond.}
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{he used to know me.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{sorry, alan it's been six years.}
<A>__{grant shrugs, gives jack the cookie, and heads towards the table. the three adults are finishing their dessert and coffee. the the children have been out to bed. an awkward moment of silence. uncomfortable smiles. then }
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{more coffee?}
<C>__{ellie}
<P>__{(relived)}
<D>__{yes. great.}
<A>__{mark stands and collects their cups.}
<C>__{ellie }
<D>__{so, mark's working at the state department now.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{really?}
<P>__{(to mark)}
<D>__{what do you do there?}
<C>__{mark}
<P>__{(with mock bravado)}
<D>__{i could tell you about it, but than i'd have to kill you.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{indeed.}
<A>__{mark smiles, nodding. then he goes into the kitchen. another uncomfortable silence.}
<C>__{ellie}
<A>__{so what are you working on now?}
<C>__{grant}
<A>__{we have a new site in montana. at least until the money runs out.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{anything good?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{raptors, mostly.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{my favorite.}
<A>__{grant leans forward, realizing ellie's one of the few people he can talk to about this.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{you remember the sounds they made?}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{i try not to.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{we've done cranial scans, and raptors actually had a quite sophisticated resonating chamber. i have a theory that their ability to vocalize is the key to their social intelligence. the way they can work together as a team.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{you think they could talk to each other?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{to a degree we never imagined.}
<A>__{and from the cage in the corner of the room...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{bullshit!}
<A>__{both look back at the parrot. ellie smiles.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{you taught him that.}
<L>__{exterior suburban street night}
<A>__{ellie and grant head toward the rental car parked in the driveway.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{good luck with the fund raising.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{it was never easy, but before jurassic park, you could find money. somewhere. now fossils are out. everyone wants to see a real live dinosaur.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{times change alan. but you're the still the best. i mean that.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{the last of my breed.}
<A>__{a long moment passes between them as both consider where they've ended up.}
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{i'd better get going.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{let me know if i can help, alan. youre bad about asking for help, but please ask me. anything, anytime.}
<C>__{grant}
<P>__{(deep down knowing he never will)}
<D>__{okay. goodbye, ellie.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{goodbye, alan.}
<A>__{not sure what the right thing to do is, they finally end up with a friendly hug. they keep it short. grant gets in his car. starts the engine. he's about to pull off when ellie knocks on the window. he rolls it down.}
<C>__{ellie }
<D>__{when i met you, i thought that one day millions of years ago, all the dinosaurs became extinct. wiped out. but you told me otherwise. when conditions changed, dinosaurs changed. they became other things. they evolved.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{a well accepted theory.}
<C>__{ellie}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{alan don't be afraid to evolve.}
<A>__{grant hears her, but ellie knows it didn't really get through. a forced half smile, than grant waves goodbye. ellie watches as he drives off.}
<L>__{interior auditorium day}
<A>__{the last stop on grant's fund raising tour, it's a public lecture hosted by some foundation. there are scientists and students here, but also a lot of dino fans, some even with costumes. grant finishes his speech to what was a full house some attendees are grabbing their coats and sneaking out. this wasn't the exciting guest speaker they were all expecting. a new slide comes up. just black and white, and indecipherable.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{it's through the painstaking study of the interior chamber in multiple specimens that we can determine this exciting correlation between the larynx and the upper plate. that lets us theorize theorize, mind you that the raptor might have been capable of bird like vocalizations. which as you can imagine, would be a tremendous breakthrough.}
<A>__{he's finished, but no one seems to notice at first. then the sympostum leader stands up, leading a smattering round of}
<B>__{applause.}
<C>__{sympostium leader}
<D>__{thank you very much dr. grant. now does anyone have a question?}
<A>__{nearly every hand goes up. grant doesn't seem surprised.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{does anyone have a question that doesn't relate to jurassic park?}
<A>__{quite a few hands go down.}
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{or the incident in san diego, which i will remind you, i did not witness.}
<A>__{now most of the hands are down. picking one of the few remaining...}
<C>__{male student}
<D>__{your theory on raptors is good and all, but isn't all this conjecture kind of moot?}
<A>__{the student's buddy nods in agreement.}
<C>__{male student }
<D>__{i mean, once the u.n. and costa rica and everyone decides how to handle the second island, scientist will just go in and look for themselves. too clever science reporter isn't paleontology itself in danger of extinction?}
<A>__{recognizing those as fighting words, the symposium leader is about to step in. but grant will take this himself.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{no, and let me be perfectly clear on this pointerior dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago. what's left of them is fossilized in stone the actual scientists spend years to undercover.}
<C>__{grant }
<D>__{what john hammond and ingen created are theme park monsters. nothing more, nothing less. the class clearly disagrees with his assessment.}
<C>__{another student}
<D>__{you're saying you wouldn't want to study them if you had the chance?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{no force on this earth or in heaven could get me on that island.}
<L>__{interior derelict cockpit day}
<A>__{looking through the cracked windshield of a junkyard plane, we see someone spray painting red circles on the outside of the glass.}
<L>__{exterior aircraft graveyard day}
<A>__{nash, a wry, intelligent mercenary pilot and soldier, is painting huge eyes the windows of a wrecked plane. finished, he tosses the paint can through the open windows and walks quickly away from the plane. we now see that red teeth are painted on the craft's nose. it looks absurdly like some angry beast. we are one the edge of a dry lake bed, part of an aircraft graveyard. wrecked planes lie all around. we hear a phone ringing...}
<L>__{interior cargo plane day}
<A>__{a ringing satellite phone rests on a stack of gun cases. udesky, the leader of this crew, answers it.}
<C>__{udesky}
<D>__{udesky.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{yes sir. we're good to go. i will lock it down as soon as you drop me the payment.}
<A>__{with the phone still to his ear, udesky wanders out of the craft...}
<L>__{exterior cargo plane day}
<A>__{udesky looks over at nash and cooper, another mercenary. cooper's the quiet muscle of the bunch, a weapons specialist. he finishes loading a massive gun, essentially a hand cannon. it's aimed at nash's grimacing aircraft.}
<C>__{udesky}
<D>__{that's right, two of the very best i could find. no, i haven't worked with them personally, but they come with the highest recommendations.}
<A>__{then cooper fires at the grimacing aircraft. a projectile rockets into the plane and explodes with a fireball. nash and cooper exchange a satisfied smile.}
<C>__{udesky }
<D>__{you've got nothing to worry about, sir. this is going to be a piece of cake.}
<A>__{pieces of the demolished craft come raining down.}
<L>__{exterior excavation base camp, pt. peck lake, mt day}
<A>__{close on a man's hand, carefully scraping the stone away from a dinosaur fossil. we follow his hand back as he wipes off his sweaty brow, revealing him to be billy brennan, 25, an associate professor and site manager. he's a charmer. looking past him, we see cheryl, 21, a junior at junior of state. she's one of a dozen college students working at the site, and the one most smitten with her supervisor.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{billy? i don't think i'm doing this right.}
<A>__{he scoots over, lying down beside her. checks her work.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{you need to go slowly. see, just take it little at a time.}
<A>__{she's not listening, just watching his eyelashes.}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{i can never tell what's bone and what's rock.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{technically, it's all rock. the calcium in the bones is replaced during fossilization. but you can feel the difference. see? rough, smooth. rough, smooth.}
<A>__{he runs her bare fingers over the two different patches, showing her. after a pause, she runs her finger along his stubbly chin...}
<C>__{cheryl}
<D>__{rough.}
<A>__{...and along his lips.}
<C>__{cheryl }
<D>__{smooth.}
<A>__{billy may not have started this flirtation, but he's not ending it either. it's then that a}
<B>__{shadow}
<A>__{falls across them. billy looks up to see...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{dr. grant!}
<A>__{grant has just returned, a bag over his shoulder.}

<L>__{exterior walking to the main tents day}
<A>__{billy takes one of grant's bags, talking as they go.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{how was your trip? profitable?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{we'll be broke in four weeks.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{three weeks. i had to rent some equipment.}
<A>__{the cross into one of the tents, which only has two "walls". on a dust taped table, a dusty macintosh is feeing data into a strange machine the size of a dorm refrigerator. a mechanical arm sweeps back and forth across a tray of fine sand.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{you rented an automated litter box.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{it's a rapid prototyper. i feed in the scan data from the raptor skull, than the computer breaks it into thousands of slices which this thing prints, one layer on top of the other. it's the future of paleontology.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{not if it can't dig.}
<A>__{the arm stops and suddenly the tray of sand shakes, dropping through holes in the bottom to reveal an object the size of a person's fist.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i give you a raptor's resonating chamber.}
<A>__{grant hates technology, but he can't help but be amazed by the result. he lifts the strange object up, shaking out the remaining sand. billy puts it to his lips and blows through it like a conch shell. the resulting sound is unique and piercing, the cry of an non existent animal. grant is speechless with excitement. and so he uses it again and again, producing different sounds and variations. in the distance, flocks of birds rise to the sky and fly off. billy looks up to see a man and a woman getting out of a cadillac. cheryl is pointing them in the direction of the tent.}
<C>__{billy }
<P>__{(falsely casual)}
<D>__{oh, i forgot to tell you. some visitors wanted to come by and talk to you. i}
<A>__{told them you'd be happy to see them.}
<D>__{maybe even have dinner with them.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{absolutely not.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{they're here.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{only now does grant realize these two people who were walking up to them. putting on a friendly smile, billy goes up to them.}

<P>__{(extending his hand)}
<D>__{paul kirby. kirby enterprises}
<P>__{(reaching into his pocket)}
<D>__{my card.}
<A>__{paul kirby is a talkative optimist with no "off" switch. his wife amanda kirby, just as friendly, is harder to read. there seems to be exhaustion behind her eyes.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{what can i do for you, mr. kirby?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{well sir, i am a great admirer}
<A>__{of yours, and i have an extremely interesting proposition to discuss. would you let my wife and i take you to have dinner tonight? our treat.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{you know, i've been traveling and i'm very tired. maybe some other time.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i guarantee it'll be worth your while.}
<A>__{behind kirby, bill furtively rubs his thumb and fingers together, indicating the guy is loaded. grant musters a weak smile.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{it's be my pleasure.}
<L>__{interior hell creek bar and grill, jordan, mt night}
<A>__{theyre only halfway through the entree, but grant is ready to bolt. it's only billy who's keeping him from being rude. they walk over to paul and amandas table and sit down.}

<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{it is truly, whats the word? inspiring.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{it's everything grant can do just to be polite. he desperately wants to leave and get back to his dig.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{amanda and i, well, we just love the outdoors. heck we've been on pretty much any adventure tour they can come up with: galapagos, k2, the nile...}

<C>__{grant}
<D>__{that's a very nice offer, mr. kirby, but i'm afraid i'm much to busy. if you like i can refer you to a number of highly qualified...}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no, no, see dr. grant, you're the best. you've seen these animals in the flesh. no one else has come close to you.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{i'm flattered, but i've taken this little adventure tour. and with the air restrictions they've imposed after the incident in san diego, you cant fly low enough to see anything of interest.}
<A>__{paul is momentarily stymied, but amanda rallies.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{you see, that's just the thing. paul and i have special permission to fly low.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{how low?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{well, i'm no aviation specialist. but i do know it's hell of a lot lower than anyone else.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{from what i understand, it's pretty much whatever we want.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{that's hard to believe.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{let's just say that through my business imports exports, emerging markets i've made some friends in high places. in this case, the costa rican government.}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{dr. grant, you don't know how important it is for us to have you come along. it would make all the difference.}

<D>__{so how do you know the kirby's?}
<A>__{and we reveal... mercenary cooper, the weapons specialist we met earlier. he's wearing sunglasses so dark you can't tell whether he's staring at you or fast asleep. he doesn't answer. did he even hear? and then }

<A>__{dashing back the way they came, the group suddenly comes face to face with }
<B>__{the first monster.}
<A>__{we now get our first full unobstructed view of the gigantic creature, spinosaurus aegypticus. over forty feet long and twenty five feet high, the dinosaur has a bony sail along its back. its head is crocodilian with rows of long, curving teeth. sinewy six foot arms terminate in three fingers hands with fourteen inch claws. nowhere else to run, the group scatters into the brush as the two behemoth predators rush forward, their roars thunderous. paul and amanda scramble into one direction, billy and udesky in the other. but grant can't go anywhere his foot is stuck between two branches. he manages to free himself as the two dinosaurs approach. they'll have to deal with each other before eating the humans. grant dives down between two fallen trees as the spinosaurus and t rex circle one another like gladiators, each searching for the other's weakness. laying flat on his back, grant lets out a terrified gasp as the giant foot of spinosaurus lands across the two trunks mere inches from his face. spinosaurus lunges forward, powerful jaw open wide. t rex sidesteps the assault, its tail knocking down small trees as it spins out of the way. in the tress, paul and amanda scurry again for cover. between the fallen trunks, grant attempts to get away on his hands and knees. t rex presses the attack, slamming its tail into the flank of its adversary. spinosaurus is knocked back, and grant is again forced to duck for cover. as spinosaurus struggles to regain its balance, t rex dives forward. spinosaurus is driven backwards as t rex tries to grip its throat. amanda yanks paul out of their path. they scramble over to billy. now on its side, spinosaurus fights back ferociously. it slashes at t rex with its long arms and razor sharp claws, then finally kicks the animal with one mammoth foot. tyrannosaurus staggers back, wounded. down below, grant is splashed by the blood pouring from the dinosaur, as he slowly makes his way towards his fellow humans. spinosaurus lunges for the t rex with gaping jaws and manages to topple t rex off its feet and sends the falling dinosaur to the ground. with an earth shuttering crash, the dinosaur lands between grant and the rest of the group. the companions scurry out of the way, but as they do so, the head of the t rex now lands almost directly on top of them. plastered against an immense tree, the group watches in horror as t rex starts to rise but is thrown back down as spinosaurus latches onto its throat. spinosaurus crushes the life out of its adversary, and t rex opens and closes its jaw a mere inches from our terrified friends. finally, grant reaches the others.}

<A>__{letting go of paul, grant takes the photo, a sears style portrait of the boy we saw parasailing at the beginning. he shakes his head, disbelieving. he hands the photo to billy. the group splits into two sides paul and amanda, grant and billy with udesky stuck between. dialogue overlaps in places.}

<A>__{the entire pack is now standing still, watching him. in the center, the alpha male lets out a sort of bark. responding to the cry, the other raptors call back. as terrified as he is, he can't help but be fascinated by their communication. like a hellish bird song, there's a rhythm to it, a structure. they're clearly talking about something. under his breath, grant is able to mimic its patterns.}

<D>__{what does that mean? what are you saying?}
<A>__{of course they can't answer. they just keep using the same "phrase." ready to ditch billy's camera bag in order to climb higher he's had to hold it by the strap grant finds his hand covered with a runny slime. he looks down at the camera bag, and that's the source. it's oozing out the bottom. he unzips the bag to find}

<A>__{he gently drops the bag to the ground. although the raptors are interested, pulling out the unbroken egg, they're still by no means placated. the song may have changed, but they still want grant dead. they begin to jump at him, eventually, hopping up on each others backs. it's only a matter of time till they reach him. grant moves to climb higher, but sees no branches he can reach. and than he hears the low creaking. a crack. the branch he's on is starting to give in. he looks down at the face of his enemies, knowing he'll be their next meal. and then,}

<A>__{he points to a heavy crane assembly, designed for lifting cages off the large boats. now well accustomed to fleeing on command, amanda sends eric up first, climbing the scaffolding like a jungle gym. all the while, they're trying to spot paul. grant is the last to climb, reaching the first section as spinosaurus returns from the water, slamming into the base of the crane. the whole assembly shudders, threatening to rip into the water.}

<D>__{where's dad?}
<C>__{amanda}
<D>__{just hold on.}
<A>__{try as it might, the beast can't climb the crane. so instead it rams it, shakes it, trying to knock them off. eric slips, but amanda catches him. about to shed his bag to climb higher, grant finds one last hope. it's the resonation chamber model. a beat before he decides: it may not be the best choice, but it's the only choice. he blows through it, the same eerie pitch we heard before. on the third try, he's able to approximate the "egg" cry he heard the raptors give. he keeps it up, repeating over and over. spinosaurus stops for a beat, confused how this sound could be coming from a non raptor. but then keeps smashing. we can hear the mounting bolts strain. soon the whole crane will tip. but not before a matching cry is heard in the jungle. grant stops, not certain he heard it. but there it is again. he keeps blowing. the crane is close to tipping when a single raptor appears from the darkness, chirp barking at the spinosaur, who simply bats away. but then more raptors come. and even more. soon there are dozens gathering, circling. grant stops signaling. all three survivors watch with horrified fascination, knowing their fate is perilous no matter which side wins. looking at his adversaries, spinosaurus roars. and suddenly the raptors attack. spinosaurus easily handles the first few, but like ants they just keep coming. they climb up his back, slicing, into him with their razor sharp claws.}

<D>__{jump! swim for the far shore!}
<A>__{all three drop from the crane arm into the water. meanwhile, the fight continues. spinosaurus rallies, shaking off many of the raptors, but they just keep coming. their hooked claws dig in, scraping the meat to the bone. spinosaurus puts up a brave fight to the end, but finally collapses, dead. the raptors continue to shred it to ribbons. then one of the raptors looks over to see the survivors swimming away. but a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. it goes back to its meal.}

<A>__{her hand takes his, gently brushing off the wet sand, fingertips touching. it's a small thing, but it's a start. sensing his cue to leave, grant gets up and starts walking down the beach. eric hurries to follow him. he speaks conspiratorially, not wanting to alarm his parents.}

<P>__{(shouting over the noise)}
<D>__{we have to cut it! find something sharp!}
<A>__{everyone checking the cabin for a knife, anything sharp. finally, eric hands grant the raptor claw. grant uses it to rip the line. the fibers break and fray, but the pteranodon keeps coming closer. paul throws a wrench at the pteranodon, whacking it straight in the head. it felt good, and damn if it didn't slow it down a little. grant has cut through the cord. he started on the second when the pteranodon snaps at him, going for his hand. there's nowhere for grant to cut without the pteranodon getting him. and idea, grant very deliberately places in his hand on the line, pulling away at the last moment. the pteranodon itself bites through the line.}
