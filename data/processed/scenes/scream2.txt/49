<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior student union later}
<A>__{a huge one stop for students. comprised of several open floors, it looks like a mini mall. a cafeteria, book store, movie theatre, arcade, etc. fill the place. gale moves through the lobby area when she sees debbie salt heading her off. she tries to bolt but she's not fast enough.}
<C>__{debbie salt}
<D>__{hi, gale, any leads?}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{tons and tons.}
<C>__{debbie salt}
<D>__{where is sidney's father?}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{home where he lives.}
<C>__{debbie salt}
<D>__{and are the police sure about that?}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{why don't you ask them?}
<C>__{debbie salt}
<D>__{already did. he's the perfect suspect, don't you think?}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{no, i don't.}
<C>__{debbie salt}
<D>__{parents are always responsible. it all starts in the home.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{look, i know you kinda hold me up as your career template and it gives you some anal charge to challenge me but you win. okay? i'm not interested in the scoop anymore. excuse me.}
<A>__{gale charges off, moving to a nearby newsstand. the tabloid papers exploit what's going on. crazy headlines about the murders dominate the newsrack. gale is clearly bothered by this. just then, a phone rings. she pulls it from her pocket.}
<C>__{gale }
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{hello, gale.}
<A>__{it's the killer. his voice is unmistakable.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{who is this?}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{i will give you one guess.}
<A>__{gale knows immediately. she looks around for help. a campus cop is across the lobby.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{that's not the way we play the game.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{i don't play games.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{what if your life depended on it?}
<A>__{gale gets testy with him.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{you're pretty when you're angry.}
<A>__{gale stops cold. she looks around. the place is alive with people. he could be anywhere.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{where are you?}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{i'm everywhere.}
<A>__{she continues moving to the campus cop.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{oh a god complex}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{stay away from the cop.}
<A>__{a deadly warning. gale stops. she plays it cool. she looks above her to the upper floor. students hang over a balcony.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{what do you want from me?}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{it's what you want from me.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{you are writing another book, aren't you? that's why you're here. the story's not over.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{you're getting obvious.}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{no, gale, i'm just getting started. seeya soon.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{no, wait...}
<C>__{man's voice}
<D>__{watch your back.}
<A>__{click. the phone goes dead. gale spins around, doing quick circle to make sure no one's around her. she turns and heads off, right into...}
<B>__{dewey}
<A>__{they both gasp.}
