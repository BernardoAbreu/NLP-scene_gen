<L>__{interior the makawao bar and grill night}
<A>__{bernie seated with natalie.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{this town... you know, natalie, all i want to do is go some place where i can tell day from night. where they got clocks on the wall. i can't breathe around here no more. four days and i'm gone. i'm not even sure i can hold out that long.}
<C>__{natalie}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{so where does that leave us?}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{a week ago, i didn't remember what it was like to have a woman's hands on me. i'm still pinching myself, expecting to wake up from...}
<P>__{(just blurts it out)}
<D>__{come with me, natalie. i want you to come with me.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{god, bernie, that's...}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i didn't mean to spring that on you.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{bernie... i want to be with you. i do. but i don't know if i can leave with you.}
<A>__{bernie's look: why?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{i was working on a compatibility chart for the two of us. and it looks good, really, it does.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{so, what's the problem?}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{that's with us here. in vegas.}
<A>__{bernie's expression: oh.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{maybe i was being presumptuous, 'cause i knew you were leaving... and i tried working it in different ways... it wasn't good, bernie. i got scared. but that's just for now, for the immediate future. once the planets realign, maybe a year from now...}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{natalie... i can't... not another year. not another week.}
<A>__{a somber mood falls on the table. bernie reaches for natalie's hand. instead, he knocks the salt over. it spills out in front of them.}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{i think... we probably shouldn't see each other anymore.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{why, bernie? we only got a couple days left together. why not make the most of them?}
<C>__{bernie}
<P>__{(a long beat)}
<D>__{because if i spend one more night in your arms, i'm not going anywhere.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{and that's so bad?}
<A>__{bernie just stares at her, shrouded in sadness. natalie stubs out her cigarette, rises.}
<C>__{natalie}
<D>__{take care, bernie.}
<A>__{bernie casts his eyes to the mound of spilled salt in front of him. nods. a few beats later he raises his head...}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{natalie, don't...}
<A>__{gone. a waitress appears.}
<C>__{waitress }
<D>__{get you another?}
<C>__{bernie}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{i think you better bring me the bottle. please.}
