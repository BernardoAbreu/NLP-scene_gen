<C>__{gina}
<D>__{oh yeah? how'd you get through the blockade?}
<A>__{another kid, scott, pops into the room. he's sixteen, dark hair, with a tough guy i could give a shit attitude. he doesn't seem to care about anybody in the room, except for karen.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{hey, beautiful. how's it going?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{hi, scott.}
<A>__{scott notices jacob and frowns. karen is a little annoyed.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{who's barney rubble?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{this is jacob johnson. he's a new resident. at least temporarily.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{he better not be rooming with me. i value my privacy.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{no, i believe that honor goes to wesley.}
<C>__{wesley}
<D>__{good. i could use the company.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{so what's your story? divorce? custody battle? your parents just plain assholes?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{they're dead.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{mellow out, scott. give him a chance to settle in.}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{just curious.}
<A>__{scott reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls out a pack of cigarettes. as he lights one up, wesley's cheerful attitude suddenly turns grim. he gets up from the couch and quickly leaves the room. karen gives scott an angry look.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{is he alright?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{he'll be fine. he just has a problem with cigarettes.}
<C>__{gina}
<D>__{his parents used to use them as a sick kind of discipline. that's why he's here.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{if you know that, then why do you smoke in front of him?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{it's not my problem.}
<A>__{this really pisses jacob off. these two are not going to get along very well.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{just what is your problem, then?}
<C>__{scott}
<D>__{i took care of my problem. that's why i'm here.}
<A>__{scott lets out an aloof puff of smoke and leaves. jacob gives karen a confused glance.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{his dad used to beat him. one day he couldn't take it any more.}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{he killed him with his father's gun. self defense.}
<A>__{jacob sits down on the couch and lets that sink in. gina scootches away from him on the couch, then gives him a glum look.}
<C>__{gina}
<D>__{everyone here has a fun tale to tell. isn't that right, karen?}
<A>__{karen is staring out the window. she has that spaced out expression we saw before when she was hiding behind the bush.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{yeah. right.}
<A>__{no one has anything left to say. gina turns the sound on the tv back up as the three sad kids start to watch cartoons.}
