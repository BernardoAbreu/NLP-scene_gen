<A>__{package night from the previous scene. it's on the table with a growing stack of mail. the postman is in bed, trying to sleep. but it's hard coming. he laces his fingers behind his head, stares up at the moon through a hole in the wall. a knock at the door.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{just leave it.}
<A>__{there's a pause. and then, another knock.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i said leave it.}
<A>__{the door opens. surprise. abby stands in the doorway, her hair held up by an old red ribbon. he sits up.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{hello, abby.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you'll be leaving tomorrow?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i guess.}
<C>__{abby}
<P>__{(enters; closes door)}
<D>__{everybody's up late writing letters for you to take. we're not supposed to waste candles like that, but they're so excited.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{how about you? do you have a letter?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i don't have anybody to write to.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i will find you a pen pal. someone with interests similar to your own. dancing, checking for mumps.}
<A>__{abby laughs. the postman is charmed.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{you're funny. hardly anyone's funny around here.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{i guess no one feels much like laughing.}
<A>__{the two of them just look at each other a moment. abby fingers the ribbon in her hair.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{have you decided yet?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{oh, well, i've been thinking about it.}
<A>__{a beat. abby lets her shift drop to the floor, then slides under the sheets alongside him.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{sure. why not?}
<A>__{they lie there awkwardly for a moment. he looks at her.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{god, you're beautiful. sorry, i know you'd probably like to keep things more clinical.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you don't even know my name.}
<A>__{she shushes him, covers his mouth with her hand.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i don't want to.}
<A>__{he nods he understands. she stares into his eyes.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{it would be easier for me if you closed your eyes.}
<A>__{the postman closes his eyes. abby slides her hand away from his mouth. and as they start to make love...}
