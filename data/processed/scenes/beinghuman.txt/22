<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{this is not the grandeur of rome, but the dusty main street of a provincial capital in greece or spain or north africa. it is difficult to tell from the people because they are such a cosmopolitan crowd, faces from every corner of the mediterranean world. it has some thing of the atmosphere of a frontier town in a western, except that here the half finished buildings are made of brick and stone. lucinnius leaves the bathhouse. hector follows three paces behind him, loaded down with the large towel, the scrubber, robe, and the wooden stool. the stool goes with them everywhere, in case lucinnius has to stop in the street and converse with a friend. other notables are among the street throng, their own slaves tagging along behind with their little wooden stools. some have whole trains of slaves shadowing them. human status symbols. lucinnius stops near some street stalls. hector stops beside him.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{bad omens, hector. bad omens. get me something to eat. just a mouse or two.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{hector places the stool at lucinnius's feet and moves off. lucinnius sits down, still absorbed in his problems. hector keeps an eye on lucinnius as he orders the food.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{two mice... and some bread...}
<C>__{stallholder}
<D>__{no mice.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{two chicken legs, then, cold, and the bread.}
<A>__{as hector is given the food and pays for it, he sees another man, julian, approach lucinnius, trailed by two slaves. one of them is carrying a folding chair much more substantial than lucinnius's. julian and lucinnius greet one another and sit down to talk, lucinnius at something of a height disadvantage. the two slaves move off to one side. lucinnius's mood has brightened since the arrival of his friend. their conversation seems open and friendly. hector gives his master his food, and then moves to join the two slaves, hearing a snatch of the conversation as he goes.}
<C>__{julian}
<D>__{of course you're free to call at my house at anytime, but i was receiving nepos... how could i admit you?}
<A>__{hector offers to share his bread with the other two slaves. they easily fall into conversation, inevitably, about their masters.}
<D>__{slave #1 spoiled his day, meeting your man... he's been avoiding him all week. slave #2 his ships have gone too, we heard.}
<A>__{this is news to hector.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{when did you hear? slave #2 last night. nepos knew. pirates. they're sunk, he reckons. that could finish him, eh?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{this is the worst it's been. slave #1 you'll be up for sale before you know it!}
<A>__{this makes them laugh, hector less so than the other two.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{he's finished... you reckon?}
<A>__{the other two nod their heads.}
<D>__{slave #1 yes... at the baths... i could tell... they smelled blood...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{well... if he'd pulled it off he'd be in rome by now... slave #1 and you with him...}
<A>__{hector nods his head thoughtfully.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{and me with him... half way home...}
<A>__{lucinnius and his friend stand and exchange their final words, unaware of the scrutiny they have been under, or so used to it that they are oblivious to it. hector and the slaves hurry to gather up the seats and take their positions behind their masters. the casualness of their conversation has gone, and they resume the formality of their roles.}
