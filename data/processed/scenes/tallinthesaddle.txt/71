<L>__{interior harolday's office day}
<A>__{harolday is standing at the window, looking toward the door, having seen rocklin approaching. the door opens and rocklin enters and resumes his conversation as though it were hardly interrupted.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{ now what was that you were sayin' about caldwell?}
<C>__{harolday}
<D>__{you being hired by red caldwell only confirms what i'd suspected he was getting ready to fight.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(trying to get information)}
<D>__{fight? who?}
<C>__{harolday}
<D>__{organized rustling. well at least that's my belief. red was no friend of mine. too fond of taking the law into his own hands. but he had my sympathy. he'd been harder hit than any of us. and on top of it all, he lost his foreman.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{you mean, he quit on him?}
<C>__{harolday}
<D>__{he was shot in the back with a bullet from the same caliber rifle as got red.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{got any ideas?}
<C>__{harolday}
<D>__{no except that the man you just pistol whipped is in on it somewhere.}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{pity you didn't kill him when you had the chance.}
<A>__{rocklin realizes that maybe harolday is trying to throw a curve trying to get him to talk.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{say it don't sound as if it's goin' to be too easy for them wimmen at the k.c.}
<C>__{harolday}
<P>__{(watching him keenly)}
<D>__{want to go back and work for them?}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{no, sir. and i ain't jumping at this offer o' yours either because i don't hold with working for wimmen.}
<C>__{harolday}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{oh, you mean my step daughter. well don't worry. she won't interfere with you...rocklin i figure we've been losin' cattle over a place called table top it's the back way into the topaz ranch and the perfect route for rustlers i'm going to send you up to the line camp you don't mind working a lone hand do you?}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(measuring)}
<D>__{ i like workin' that way.}
<C>__{harolday}
<P>__{(rising and holding out a hand)}
<D>__{good be ready to move out this afternoon.}
