<L>__{interior glass room u.s. robotics night}
<A>__{a room. made entirely of glass. at the very top of the u.s. robotics building. looking out, 360, across the whole city. spooner and calvin. brought to the room by a couple escort robots. they see a man. standing at one of the glass walls looking out at the twinkling lights.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{i thought this investigation was over, detective spooner.}
<A>__{the man turns. it's lance robertson.}
<C>__{robertson}
<D>__{we have the evidence. we have the suspect. we have a ruling. so imagine my surprise when i was told you were in my building.}
<A>__{shoots a look at calvin.}
<C>__{robertson}
<D>__{and that one of my own employees brought you here.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you can go now, susan.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{dr. robertson, i...}
<C>__{robertson}
<P>__{(cutting her off)}
<D>__{just be thankful i'm not asking you to clean out your office.}
<A>__{beat. calvin, nods. heads out. robertson. watching her.}
<C>__{robertson}
<D>__{you don't seem to be able to let go of this case, detective.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{i'm not satisfied.}
<C>__{robertson}
<D>__{the relentless pursuit of truth. isn't that what cops are known for? to the point of futility.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{there's nothing futile about a man's murder being covered up.}
<C>__{robertson}
<D>__{"covered up?" that's a little dramatic, don't you think? thanks to you, we caught the machine that did this and are destroying it in...}
<P>__{(checks watch)}
<D>__{...three hours.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{is that for the sake of humanity or your stock holders?}
<A>__{robertson. walks across the spooner. looks him. right in the eye.}
<C>__{robertson}
<D>__{believe me i'd like nothing more than to have that robot. if i could have it in ten years, but not today. as you can see from the press, people are struggling to keep up as it is. there's a hunger for progress, detective. but also a fear. today it would bury this company. that's why i've notified the authorities that we're going to end this tonight.}
<P>__{(looks out at the city)}
<D>__{the announcement of heinrich's death at the hands of a robot wiped a billion dollars off our stock. so you tell me. if you were in my position, what would you do?}
<A>__{he looks back at spooner and smiles. that charismatic robertson we saw before.}
<C>__{robertson}
<D>__{now. i believe this conversation is over. i don't want to see you near this building again, detective.}
<A>__{he turns. calling over. to the escort robots...}
<C>__{robertson}
<D>__{get him out of here.}
