<A>__{leeloo watches the diva's arrival. a door opens and two policeman clear the way for diva plavalaguna, her manager, her bodyguards and a gaggle of porters carrying trunks. not wanting to draw attention to herself, leeloo feigns interest in a painting that is obviously upside down. a white chiffon veil covers the face of the diva, she stops in front of leeloo. the diva reaches out and strokes leeloo's face, without touching her. the diva removes her hand making a sound of crackling electricity, then passes on. leeloo is groggy. the diva's assistant comes up to her.}
