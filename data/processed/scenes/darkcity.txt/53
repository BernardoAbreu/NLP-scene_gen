<L>__{interior doctor schreber's office night}
<A>__{schreber is showing white a series of charts. the doctor seems nervous about white's potential for further violence.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{put simply... a penetration of the left parieto occipital area of the cranium... complicated by inflammation that resulted in adhesions of the brain to the meninges. without going into detail... the formation of scar tissue altered the configuration of the lateral ventricles, producing incipient atrophy of the medulla...}
<C>__{white }
<D>__{look. it was a simple question. can someone kill and not remember it?}
<C>__{schreber }
<D>__{i'm sorry. i get carried away sometimes. possible? i'm... ah, afraid so.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{did she drown? the woman you told me about?}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{not exactly. she was found in a canal, disembowelled. throat cut. blood drained. the body wrapped in a bed sheet.}
<A>__{white shakes his head, looking blankly at the doctor.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{horrible...}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{you remember nothing, eh?}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{let me show you something.}
<A>__{schreber turns, points to double doors. he walks towards these. white follows.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{formation of memories is the most important of brain functions.}
<B>__{the doors are opened}
<A>__{they step into a room of living animal experiments.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{we are little more than a sum of memories. from them we reference who we are, where we're going. without a past we are nothing. this is why you are so interesting.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{i'm nothing then.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{anything but , my friend.}
<A>__{the two men look down on a monkey with the top of its head missing, squirming in a mechanical device that restricts its movements.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{it feels no pain.}
<A>__{white turns and starts to pace away. schreber reluctantly follows.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{can i get my life back?}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{maybe.}
<A>__{schreber points dramatically at a wooden structure containing two rats.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{we know of two kinds of memory. firstly, declarative memory.}
<A>__{the rats perform various activities involving mazes and geometric symbols. schreber turns to look at white, eyebrow raised.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{and then there is procedural memory.}
<A>__{tight on his slender finger pointing to a machine also run by rats. the object is to make it through a guillotine device. one rat is successful, the other is chopped neatly in two.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{follow?}
<A>__{white nods.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{research on simple animals can be... useful. to show us where memory storing systems are located, for example. i am building an experiment with hamsters nexterior}
<P>__{(looks at nearby cage of hamsters)}
<D>__{cute little things.}
<A>__{schreber puts a hand on white's shoulder.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{listen to me talk! you must be hungry.}
<A>__{white nods again, extremely troubled.}
