<L>__{exterior train yards of champion city night}
<A>__{letters read "six months later"... as the camera explores the desolate muddy terrain of the train yards, cruising past piles of tires and abandoned train cars... camera picks up a battered van as it drives through the yard, then pulls up beside an old boxcar. the back of the van is thrown open, a ramp is thrown down, and the red eyes, a gang of vicious small time thieves (all of whom wear sunglasses with red lenses) start unloading their night's haul... red eye 1 drives a golf cart, with clubs, down the ramp.}
<C>__{red eye 1}
<D>__{golf anyone?}
<A>__{several more red eyes emerge carrying a sawn off bike rack with bikes still attached, a barber pole, a virgin mary lawn statue, and a top of the line baby stroller... while their leader, big red, stands in the door to the boxcar, watching approvingly.}
<C>__{red eye 2}
<D>__{not a bad night's work.}
<C>__{big red}
<D>__{who said crime don't pay?}
<A>__{the red eyes laugh... as red eye 3 takes the cover off the baby stroller and sees... that there's a baby still in it.}
<C>__{red eye 3}
<D>__{hey, boss, we got a stowaway.}
<A>__{the crooks gather around the baby, a jolly little kid who just laughs at them.}
<C>__{red eye 4}
<P>__{(about to slug him)}
<D>__{who you laughin' at, punk?}
<C>__{red eye 2}
<D>__{he's just a tyke. lighten up.}
<C>__{red eye 5}
<D>__{he's kinda cute.}
<C>__{red eye 3}
<D>__{if you like drool.}
<C>__{red eye 2}
<D>__{hey, why don't we sell him back to his parents? for a million bucks!}
<A>__{the others think that's a great idea, but big red doesn't.}
<C>__{big red}
<D>__{and what if he rats on us?}
<A>__{the others hadn't thought of that.}
<C>__{red eye 3}
<D>__{so what should we do with him?}
<C>__{big red}
<D>__{stick a brick in his pampers and dump him in the lake.}
<A>__{the others think that's a good idea and look around for a brick.}
<C>__{red eye 3}
<D>__{come on, kid, you're goin' for a swim.}
<A>__{but suddenly there is another presence... a man in a blue turban and cape with the initials "br" on his chest has appeared... he is the blue}
<B>__{raja.}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{not so fast, gentlemen and i use the term loosely... unhand that youngster...}
<A>__{another man steps into the light. he wears a construction helmet and mask. there is an "s" on his chest, and he carries an old shovel. he is the shoveler.}
<C>__{shoveler}
<D>__{or you're mulch.}
<A>__{he brandishes his shovel for effect. the red eyes look at these two, highly amused.}
<C>__{big red}
<D>__{what are you guys supposed to be... superheroes?}
<A>__{a third man steps out. his costume is less dramatic than the others. he wears only an old leather jacket and a faded, torn shirt with flames on it, but the fierce look on his face and the atrociousness of his haircut make it very clear that he is the craziest and most dangerous of the three. he is mister furious.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{we are superheroes!}
<C>__{big red}
<D>__{really? did you mother make those costumes?}
<A>__{the crooks howl with laughter.}
<C>__{big red}
<D>__{this is our territory. beat it.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{over your dead body.}
<A>__{big red turns to the others and shakes with pretended fear.}
<C>__{big red}
<D>__{0ooooo, he's scary.}
<A>__{the red eyes laugh, but suddenly, a small silver projectile whizzes through the air and implants itself in big red's backside. he howls with pain, pulls it out and examines it... it's a silver dessert fork.}
<C>__{big red}
<D>__{a fork!}
<A>__{the raja holds up his hands, each of which hold a spread of silver forks.}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{and there's plenty more where that came from.}
<A>__{big red gives a shrill whistle, and a dozen more red eyes step out of an old caboose... including mikey, a four hundred pound behemoth. he is eating a container of ben and jerry's like it was an ice cream cone, taking huge bites out of it, container and all. raja and shoveler, reacting... gulp. this was more than they'd bargained for. but furious just growls; he's game.}
<C>__{big red}
<D>__{get 'em!}
<A>__{the red eyes attack... mister furious goes into a furious face; his hair stands out straight and he rushes right into the oncoming crooks... a red eye takes a swing at the shoveler but he simply puts up his shovel and lets the crook slug the shovel's pan. the crook yelps with pain and shakes his battered hand... as the raja fends off crooks, poking them with salad forks... and the baby sits in his stroller, watching and laughing, really enjoying the show. (there's no real martial artistry or teamwork here; this is a classic back alley brouhaha.) but there's too many of then... the raja goes down under swinging fists... and so does the shoveler... furious holds his own, taking out crooks with powerful lefts and rights until mikey runs him down like a truck, falling right on top of him and crushing him under his massive weight.}
<C>__{red eyes}
<D>__{crush him, mikey!... mash him!... mush him!}
<C>__{furious}
<P>__{(barely audible under all that meat)}
<D>__{is that all you got?}
<C>__{red eyes}
<D>__{he wants more!... squish him!... finish him off!}
<C>__{furious}
<P>__{(faintly)}
<D>__{your mother!}
<A>__{mikey, sweating, bears down... but suddenly, a calm, very authoritative voice is heard.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{is there a problem?}
<A>__{everything suddenly stops, as the red eyes look up and see... captain amazing standing on tap of the boxcar, hands on hips, framed in the light at the moon, his biceps bulging, his state of the art physique sculpted body armor gleaming in the moonlight, his cape wafting heroically in the wind. he is superhero perfection incarnate. on the red eyes as their viciousness turns instantly to panic...}
<C>__{red eyes}
<D>__{it's captain amazing!}
<A>__{big red and a couple others try to run for it, but amazing leaps ca like off the boxcar and is on them in a flash. as the baby claps his hands in delight, and our three heroes watch in beat up awe, amazing deftly takes out the crooks with expert punches and effortlessly delivered elbows and kicks. he is the consumate superhero, and he doesn't even break a sweat. the remaining red eyes drop to their knees and throw up their hands in surrender.}
<C>__{red eyes}
<D>__{we give!... we're sorry!... we had terrible}
<P>__{childhoods! (etc.)}
<A>__{police cars and a tv truck come screeching into the train yard... and the scene is suddenly flooded vith light and swarming with cops and reporters... our three heroes try to approach captain amazing (who still looks fresh as a daisy).}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{nice work, captain.}
<A>__{but amazing just walks past them, ignoring them completely, as if they didn't even exist. he goes to greet dawn wong (champion city's answer to connie chung).}
<C>__{amazing}
<P>__{(turning on the old superhero charm)}
<D>__{hi. dawn.}
<C>__{dawn}
<P>__{(putty in his hands, pudding in his bowl)}
<D>__{looks like you've done it again, captain.}
<C>__{amazing}
<D>__{it's what i do.}
<A>__{our heroes just watch, feeling ignored, humiliated. furious growls. suddenly, two cops are accosting them.}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{okay, show's over. move it. on your way.}
<C>__{raja}
<D>__{wait a minute, officers. you don't understand we're superheroes, and we just busted up this gang.}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{really? let me guess you're towel head and he's...}
<P>__{(meaning the shoveler)}
<D>__{captain pooper scooper!}
<A>__{the cops crack up. furious growls at them. the cops yank out their nightsticks.}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{hey! move it!}
<C>__{cop 2}
<D>__{get a life!}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{and leave crime fighting to the real thing!}
<A>__{shoveler and raja pull furious away before he gets into real trouble... the cops watch as our three heroes disappear into the night.}
<C>__{cop 1}
<D>__{wannabes.}
<C>__{cop 2}
<D>__{pathetic.}
