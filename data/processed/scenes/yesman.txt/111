<A>__{ carl hits the ball straight into a group of trees. seung kim, standing right in front of a pond, delicately taps his ball right into the pond. carl keeps divoting the grass. he divots so many times that he has to move the ball out of the hole's he's accidentally dug. seung kim hits his ball out of the sand trap. it rolls back in. he tries again. it rolls back in. he's about to try again when carl picks up his ball and tosses it over the lip of the sand trap. carl holds his finger up to his lips: "shhh." carl's about to hit the ball when his phone rings. he answers it.}
