<L>__{76 song: "what ever happened to saturday night"}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{whatever happened to saturday night when you dressed up sharp and you felt alright it don't seem the same since cosmic light came into my life and i thought i was divine.}
<A>__{columbia leaps on to the pillion seat.}
<D>__{i used to go for a ride with a chick who'd go and listen to the music on the radio.}
<A>__{the motorcyclists guests remember only too well.}
<D>__{a saxophone was blowing on a rock and roll show and we climbed in the back and we really had a good time}
<A>__{columbia rushes to the switchboard, flicks a lighting switch and all the lights above the stairs start changing colour. the guests go crazy and rock and roll all over the staircase. columbia dances with eddie. even riff raff and magenta step it out.}
<C>__{all}
<D>__{hot patootie bless my soul i really love that rock and roll}
<P>__{(four times)}
<A>__{eddie (more confident, less frozen) leaps onto the motorbike in a legs apart guitar strumming pose. frank is getting furious. rocky is perplexed.}
<C>__{eddie}
<D>__{my head used to swim from the perfume i smelled. my hands kind of fumbled with her white plastic belt. i'd taster her baby pink lipstick, and that's when i'd melt. and she'd whisper in my ear, tonight she really was mine. get back in front and put some hair oil on. buddy holly was singing his very last song. with your arms around your girl you tried to ah sing along it felt pretty good, whoo. really had a good ti i ime.}
<A>__{eddie slips onto the pedal starting the bike. he takes off and roars round the laboratory, even riding up and down the walls.}
<C>__{all}
<D>__{hot patootie bless my soul. i really love that rock and roll. hot patootie bless my soul. i really love that rock and roll. hot patootie bless my soul. you know i love that rock and roll. hot patootie bless my soul. i really love that rock and roll.}
