<L>__{interior police station showers moments later}
<A>__{the deputy ushers meagan into the showers. inside, a naked group of mean, nasty, ugly jail house bitches are showering, washing hairy pits, flabby tattooed skin, and greasy hair. they eye meagan like the dessert bar at denny's as she crosses to the opposite side, sneaking into a corner. meagan turns on the shower and drops the towel the bitches whistle and catcall. just then, the deputy gets called away, leaving meagan to the mercy of the bitches. the head bitch slides over to meagan and says:}
<C>__{head bitch}
<D>__{what's the matter, honey... you don't like our company?}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{i like you... sure. it's just that i usually shower alone, that's all.}
<C>__{head bitch}
<D>__{oh! so you're shy? i like 'em when they're shy...}
<A>__{the head bitch grabs at meagan, who resists. but this bitch is big and tough and holds meagan by the wrists as she tries to kiss her. the other bitches laugh.}
<C>__{head bitch}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{don't fight it, baby! you know you want me...}
<A>__{meagan scratches the head bitch's face. she backs off screaming, wiping blood from her face. then she spits, reaches down (below the frame line) and produces a shiv.}
<C>__{head bitch}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{if you won't give me a piece then i will just cut one for myself...}
<A>__{the head bitch moves in. meagan takes a cautious step back, bumping into tile nowhere to go. she holds up her hands.}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{wait a second... i didn't mean to do that... i'm sorry. it's just that you come on a little strong, that's all. just give me a little time to adjust to my new surroundings...}
<A>__{the head bitch stops, curious.}
<C>__{head bitch}
<D>__{are you saying you want me now?}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{yes... i want you.}
<C>__{head bitch}
<D>__{prove it.}
<A>__{meagan comes up to the woman, raising her arms. in a flash, the head bitch has the shiv to meagan's jugular a warning. meagan carefully puts her arm around the bitch and kisses her full on the mouth. after a long, uncomfortable moment, they break. the head bitch smiles.}
<C>__{head bitch}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{now that's more like it!}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{hey, this bitch is alright!}
<A>__{the other bitches smile as the head bitch slips her arm around meagan's waist and pulls her tight.}
<C>__{head bitch}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you're okay, honey... what's your name?}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{meagan.}
<C>__{head bitch}
<D>__{so... what're you in for, meagan?}
<C>__{meagan}
<P>__{(sniffles a little)}
<D>__{oh, my friend...}
<C>__{head bitch}
<D>__{the bitch that died last night?}
<C>__{meagan}
<P>__{(starts to cry)}
<D>__{yeah... they said she had some disease that made her... explode! oh, god! please hold me!}
<A>__{the head bitch holds meagan tight as she sobs, smoothing her hair. the other bitches share a look of concern as one asks:}
<D>__{bitch #1 what's this bullshit about some killer funk make you explode?}
<C>__{head bitch}
<P>__{(to meagan)}
<D>__{easy... honey. it's goin' be alright. but what i asked you is why you're in here?}
<C>__{meagan}
<D>__{oh... well... the cops? well, they think i gave it to her...}
<A>__{the head bitch suddenly springs back as if meagan were satan himself. she runs for the other bitches but they aren't having anything to do with her. all the bitches race for the exit. the deputy comes to the shower room doorway and shouts:}
<C>__{deputy}
<D>__{what the hell is all the screaming about?!}
<A>__{wham! the bitches run her over, stripping the keys from her belt. they unlock the cellblock door and go running into the police station, screaming butt naked. after the bitches exit, meagan's hand reaches out and drags the unconscious deputy into the shower.}
