<A>__{dock comes careening at them. they're both going to be squashed like bugs. bowman slashes loose the line. and fires everything left in the portable thrust engine at once. blue plasma flares. her arm is wrenched wildly, pulled from its socket. but... the cosmos spins 180 degrees as they plunge through the opening of the port into the ares. they're on the lee side as the cosmos hits the far side of the dock like a freight train.}

<D>__{seal! emergency atmosphere. now!}
<A>__{the docking doors slam shut. the room is buffeted in white mist. she grabs an emergency cutting tool, hooks it into the front of gallagher's suit. rips it open from stem to stern. he's limp, unresponsive.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{no. not after all that, dammit. no.}
<A>__{she checks, he has no pulse.}
<C>__{bowman}
<D>__{dammit, no!}
<A>__{a first aid station is bolted into the wall. she grabs him by the shirtfront, launches them over there. takes out a pair of pre gummed heart paddles, slaps them onto his chest and fires them. gallagher is thrown entirely across the room by the current. slams into the far wall. opens his eyes. starts to breathe.}

<D>__{hey, i knew you wouldn't leave without me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
