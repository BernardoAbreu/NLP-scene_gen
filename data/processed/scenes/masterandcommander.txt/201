<D>__{mr. hollom! you gave me such a start. are you better now?}
<A>__{hollom's breathing does indeed seem easier.}
<C>__{hollom}
<D>__{much better, thank you.}

<A>__{he reaches down, picks up a 12 pound cannonball.}
<C>__{hollom }
<D>__{you've always been very kind to me. goodbye, blakeney.}
<A>__{with a sudden movement he's on the gunwale, then he jumps over the side the cannonball in his arms. blakeney looks down with shock to see hollom's pale face receding from him into the depths. it's a moment before he gathers his wits to shout }
<C>__{blakeney}
<D>__{man overboard!}
