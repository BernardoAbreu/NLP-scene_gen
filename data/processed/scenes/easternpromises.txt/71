<L>__{interior trans siberian restaurant night}
<D>__{the curtains are drawn against the rainy light. the gypsy, valery, semyon and two other russian men are sitting in a line behind a restaurant table, like a judging panel. after a moment nikolai enters, dressed in suit and tie for the biggest interview of his life. the vory behind the table greet him. then nikolai takes off his jacket and removes his tie. he then takes off his shirt, to reveal that his upper body is decorated with elaborate tattoos (details to follow). he carefully places his shirt over the chair then sits down. the panel of the vory study his body, the gypsy pushing a candle across the table to better illuminate the detail of the tattoos. only after the men have studied the tattoos does the interview begin. the following dialogue should not be translated, and can be cut around to suggest a long and grueling interview.}
<C>__{valery}
<D>__{we can see that you were in prison in siberia. and that you were a thief.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{my father was a government worker. he fixed the cars of officials. i began by selling the spare parts when i was fifteen.}
<C>__{valery}
<D>__{you have no forced tattoos?}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{none.}
<C>__{gypsy}
<D>__{you were not co operative?}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i spent two years in the punishment block.}
<C>__{valery}
<D>__{you went through the crosses in st. petersburg?}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i was in solitary confinement fifteen times. i was called 'the stump' because they couldn't shift me.}
<C>__{valery}
<D>__{your father was a bitch and a weak fucker for working with the government, that's right isn't it? nikolai flickers a little.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{that's right. my father means nothing to me. my mother....}
<C>__{gypsy}
<D>__{you have no mother. she was a whore anyway.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{yes. i have no mother and no father. there is only the code, the vory v zakone code which i have always followed.}
<C>__{valery}
<D>__{that is why there is an empty place above your heart. where the stars will go. and why there is an empty place on your knees.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i am dead already. i died when i was fifteen. now i live in the zone all the time.}
<C>__{gypsy}
<D>__{you have never worked for the government? any government?}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i have lived off albanians and georgians. i steal from them within the law. the questions and answers are delivered with great solemnity, making the ceremony feel almost religious. candles burn, the men all sip water. semyon is silent throughout but listens attentively. towards the end of the interview there is the ghost of a smile on the gypsy's face and this pleases semyon.}
