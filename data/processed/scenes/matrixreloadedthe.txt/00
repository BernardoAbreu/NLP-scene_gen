<T>__{fade in on:}
<A>__{dark clouds below the inky remnants of the scorched sky. we hear wind as we sail, like a glider, over the black atmosphere. we dive down into the murkiness, through the clouds, into the darker world of the dead surface of earth, the desert of the real. the rotted skeleton of a massive city is sprawled everywhere. we approach a fissure in the earth's crust, and as we do, we hear the increasing buzz of multiple hovercraft engines. blue flashes grow in intensity from the fissure. radio voices, indistinct at first, grow louder as we approach the fissure.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{six o'clock, 300 meters. we can't outrun 'em.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{i know. can't tow this crate fast enough! we gotta ditch it!}
<A>__{we hear the voices as though we're listening to cops through a police scanner. the woman is niobe, the captain of the lead ship, sephora.}
<C>__{niobe }
<D>__{can't, the core is still good. and they've got 'the one.'}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{oooh, our savior. hed better be worth it.}
<C>__{niobe }
<D>__{shut up and make the exit. hold on!}
<A>__{the azure glow from the fissure is suddenly overwhelming. a tight convoy of three hovercraft explode from the fissure, traveling nearly straight up, like a trio of massive locomotives flying into the sky in tight formation, linked together by tow cables. the blue glow has been emanating from the overworked flare drives of the first and third hovercrafts. between them, suspended by tow cables, is the dark, scorched, and sliced nebachanezzer. they rocket upward, slowing as they reach the top of the arc.}
<C>__{niobe }
<D>__{woo hoooh!}
<A>__{the rush to the ground, pulling up at the last second. the neb flails wildly between them.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{they're still on us!}
<A>__{more vehicles fly from the fissure. a massive army of squiddies pours up onto the surface.}
