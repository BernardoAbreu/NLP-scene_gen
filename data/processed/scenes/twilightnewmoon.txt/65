<L>__{exterior the meadow (continuous) day}
<A>__{ bella steps into the clearing, hopeful... but her face falls. in contrast to the warmth of her memory, the meadow is cold, gloomy, cloudy. and no edward. she closes her eyes, trying to force edward here. nothing. her eyes open on the empty, overcast meadow. bella sinks to her knees. tears threatening. but then she hears a rustling noise. she turns toward it, peers into the woods. another rustling noise comes from another part of the woods. she spins toward it nothing. then she turns and jumps when she finds vampire laurent standing just ten yards away. dreadlocks, chiseled face. bella can't believe it.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{laurent?}
<C>__{laurent}
<D>__{bella.}
<A>__{she beams, realizing he's real.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{laurent!}
<C>__{laurent}
<D>__{i must admit, i didn't expect to find you here.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{i live here. but you i thought you were in alaska with carlisle's friend.}
<C>__{laurent}
<D>__{tanya, i was. it was kind of him to arrange, given my association with james and victoria, "the enemy."}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{you tried to help us.}
<A>__{laurent begins to stroll in a slow arc around her, his eyes assessing her as }
<C>__{laurent}
<D>__{i went to visit the cullens, but their house is empty. i'm surprised they left you behind. weren't you sort of a pet of theirs?}
<A>__{bella's smile falters, fear beginning to dawn on her.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{um... something like that.}
<C>__{laurent}
<D>__{do the cullens visit often?}
<A>__{suddenly, edward's apparition appears between them.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{lie.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{absolutely. all the time.}
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{lie better.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{i will tell them you stopped by.}
<A>__{edward fades (throughout, he'll reappear when he speaks, then fade again). bella tries to look relaxed.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{will they be able to reach you in alaska?}
<C>__{laurent}
<D>__{i don't think so. tanya's "vegetarian" family was pleasant enough. but the dietary restrictions were difficult living on nothing but animals.}
<A>__{suddenly, he's standing inches from her. she now sees his eyes. dark blood red.}
<C>__{laurent}
<P>__{(conspiratorial)}
<D>__{tell me bella. do you ever feel compelled to... cheat?}
<A>__{bella involuntarily takes a step away from him.}
<C>__{laurent}
<D>__{but that's not why i left. i came back here as a favor to victoria.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{... you're still friends.}
<C>__{laurent}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{more or less. she asked me to get the lay of the land with the cullens. because, well... i'm afraid victoria is quite put out with you.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{that's... too bad.}
<C>__{laurent}
<D>__{yes. she feels it's only fair to kill edward's mate, given he killed hers. eye for an eye, mate for a mate.}
<A>__{and now bella knows. terror overwhelms her. edward appears }
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{threaten him.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{edward will know who did it. he'll come after both of you.}
<C>__{laurent}
<D>__{i don't think he will. after all, how much could you mean to him if he left you here unprotected?}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{victoria sent me here for information. she won't be happy about my killing you.}
<C>__{bella}
<D>__{no, laurent...}
<C>__{laurent}
<P>__{(sincere)}
<D>__{no, no, no. don't be upset. i'm doing you a kindness. victoria plans on killing you slowly, painfully whereas i will make it very quick.}
<P>__{(inhaling)}
<D>__{and you smell so... mouth watering.}
<A>__{he faces her, taking in her scent, bloodlust building. her eyes dart around, escape is impossible the only thing she sees is the apparition of edward, looking at her with alarm...}
<C>__{bella}
<P>__{(whispering, barely audible)}
<D>__{edward. i love you.}
<A>__{laurent is milliseconds from biting then abruptly, his expression changes. he sees something in the forest behind bella and it terrifies him.}
<C>__{laurent}
<D>__{i... don't believe it.}
<A>__{he steps back. bella's confused as she realizes he's no longer focused on her... she follows his eyes, slowly turning... to find behind her an enormous black wolf skulking out of the darkness of the woods. it stalks towards them, a low disturbing growl in its throat, sharp teeth gleaming. bella is trapped between the two killers. edward whispers in her ear }
<C>__{edward}
<D>__{don't. move.}
<A>__{the wolf slinks closer to bella, a mere twenty feet from where she stands, then four more wolves soundlessly emerge from the trees, flanking the black wolf. they're the size of small horses, all of different hues: dark silver, chocolate, ash and russet brown. their hackles are up, lips curling, bodies crouched, ready to spring. bella is frozen with fear as they come toward her. the russet brown wolf is the closest and looks directly at her. laurent continues to retreat then suddenly, almost simultaneously laurent bolts across the meadow the wolves spring toward bella and leap right over her in pursuit of laurent! their thunderous snarls and snaps shake her as the pack sprint after the vampire, surrounding him before he reaches the treeline laurent swings at the dark silver wolf, smacking the wolf half way across the meadow. another wolf lunges at laurent he kicks it and it sails into a tree, splintering it. the two wolves recover, lurch back to the pack which closes in on laurent. it's impossible to know who will prevail bella doesn't stay to find out. she races into the woods }
