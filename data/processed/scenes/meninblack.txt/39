<A>__{edwards, thrown for a major loop, sits like a zombie alongside kay on a bench in battery park. kay drinks his coffee while they talk.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{any given time, around fifteen hundred landed aliens are on the planet, the majority right here in manhattan. most aliens are decent enough, just trying to make a living.}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{cab drivers?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{not as many as you'd think. humans, for the most part, don't have a clue. don't want one, either. they're happy. they think they've got a pretty good bead on things.}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{why the big secret? people are smart, they can handle it.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{a person is smart. people are dumb. everything they've ever "known" has been proven to be wrong. a thousand years ago everybody knew as a fact, that the earth was the center of the universe. five hundred years ago, they knew it was flat. fifteen minutes ago, you knew we humans were alone on it. imagine what you'll know tomorrow.}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{so what's the catch?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{what you'll gain in perspective, you'll lose in ways you're too young to comprehend. you give up everything. sever every human contact. no one will know you exist. ever.}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{nobody?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{you're not even allowed a favorite shirt. there. that's the speech i never heard. that's the choice i never got.}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{hold up. you track me down, put me through those stupid ass tests, now you're trying to talk me out of it. i don't get it.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{you got 'til sun up.}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{is it worth it?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{you find out, you let me know.}
