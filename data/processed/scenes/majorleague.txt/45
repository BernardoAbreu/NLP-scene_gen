<A>__{a waiter approaches the table where lynn and her date are sharing a dessert.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{miss wells, there's a telephone call for you.}
<A>__{lynn is somewhat surprised, but gets up to take the call. we follow her to the pay phone in the hall.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{hello, lynn. it's jake.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{jake? how did you know i was here?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{just a hunch. i took you there when you got your masters. i figure you're probably wearing the black velvet dress with the red sash.}
<A>__{she is indeed. lynn is a little unsettled by this display of clairvoyance.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{how did you know that? i didn't have this dress when we were...}
<A>__{sensing that something's askew, she turns and looks across the way to see jake talking to her on the pay phone on the other side of the hall, maybe ten feet away. he gives her his best grin.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{you look great.}
<A>__{lynn, as is often the case with jake, is both charmed and put out. she goes with put out.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{thanks. what are you doin' here? aren't you supposed to be in mexico somewhere?}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i'm playin' with the indians again. back in the bigs.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{that's great. i'm happy for you, jake.}
<A>__{and she is. not so sure about herself, though.}
<C>__{lynn}
<P>__{(starting away)}
<D>__{i gotta get back...}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{wait a minute. what's your number. i tried calling you at home, but you're not listed...}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{my life is different from when you knew me.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{meaning what? that i don't know you anymore?}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{couldn't we talk about this some other time? i really gotta...}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{okay, just gimme your number.}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{i don't think that's a good idea.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{why not? because of the guy you're with? what is he, a banker?}
<C>__{lynn}
<D>__{lawyer. please, jake, he's watching us.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{i'm not leavin' without your number. you still wear those great little tortoise shell glasses? i always loved it when you took them off.}
<C>__{lynn}

<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{the number, lynn...}
<C>__{lynn}
<P>__{(reluctant)}
<D>__{all right. 555 9314.}
<C>__{taylor}
<D>__{thank you. i'm back, lynn, and i'm gonna be around.}
<A>__{she looks at him a beat, unsure what to say, then heads back toward her table. we go to lynn's date. none of this has been lost on him.}
