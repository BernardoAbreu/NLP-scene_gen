<L>__{interior hellboy's den night}
<A>__{clay pushes the cart into a solid concrete bunker, windowless, austere except for a few samurai suits of armor and weapons. dozens of cats wander around; others are curled up on the furniture. there are zippo's everywhere, from every era. on a sofa (made from the bed of a pickup truck) is a heap of blankets and comic books. all in all, a mega bachelor pad.}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(sotto voce)}
<D>__{he gets fed six times a day. he's got a thing for cats. you'll be his nanny, his keeper, his best friend. he never goes out unsupervised }
<C>__{myers}
<D>__{who?!}
<A>__{clay points at a torn comic book: hellboy, the uncanny. myers picks it up, looks at the cover: it shows hellboy in a u.s. uniform, fighting a monstrous ape. myers watches, amazed, as a bright red tail waves in and out of a pool of light about ten feet away. one of the cats playfully paws at it.}
<C>__{myers}
<P>__{(sotto voce)}
<D>__{you're kidding }
<C>__{hellboy}
<D>__{those comics they never got the eyes right.}
<A>__{the voice is a deep baritone, chesty and powerful.}
<C>__{myers}
<P>__{(to clay, sotto voce)}
<D>__{oh, jesus!! hellboy ?? is real }
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(sotto voce)}
<D>__{yup. sixty years old by our count. but he doesn't age like we do think dog years: he's barely out of his teens.}
<A>__{myers gasps, seeing a monumental figure in the shadows, exercising with a 300 lb. stainless steel dumbbell. crimson biceps like cooked hams. chomping an unlit cigar stub.}
<C>__{hellboy}
<D>__{what's with the hair, clay?? finally got those implants??}
<A>__{agent clay blushes as he hides his scalp.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{it'll fill in. where do you want your dinner, red? by the couch?}
<A>__{on a nearby pile of junked tv sets, a loop of fleischer cartoons and home movies cycles endlessly. one subject appears over and over: an attractive young woman with a pale face and raven black hair.}
<C>__{hellboy}
<D>__{who's the squirt?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{agent myers is your new liaison.}
<C>__{hellboy}
<D>__{got tired of me?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{nah. i will be around, red, just back in the field.}
<A>__{bang!!! hellboy lets the dumbbell drop. instinctively, myers jumps.}
<C>__{hellboy}
<D>__{i don't want him.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{manning says i'm too soft on you }
<P>__{(sotto voce, nudging myers)}
<D>__{the candy. give him the candy.}
<A>__{myers remembers he's holding the baby ruths.}
<C>__{myers}
<D>__{oh. uh. hello. i i have these. for you.}
<C>__{hellboy}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{father's back?}
<P>__{(clay nods)}
<D>__{still angry?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{well, you did break out }
<C>__{hellboy}
<D>__{i wanted to see her.}
<P>__{(grunts)}
<D>__{it's nobody's business.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{it is. you got yourself on tv again.}
<C>__{hellboy}
<D>__{"myers", huh? you have a first name??}
<C>__{clay}
<P>__{(sotto to myers)}
<D>__{try not to stare. he hates when people stare.}
<C>__{myers}
<D>__{uh oh john.}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{staring at what?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{his horns. he files 'em. to "fit in."}
<C>__{myers}
<D>__{his what??!!}
<A>__{hellboy finally enters the light. he's awe inspiring, with chiseled features, patterned red skin and deep set golden eyes. involuntarily, myers recoils. in spite of himself, myers is staring at the horn stumps.}
<C>__{hellboy}
<D>__{whatcha looking at, john??}
<C>__{myers}
<D>__{oh n no i }
<A>__{an alarm sounds, and a red light blinks on the wall. myers looks around, bewildered.}
<C>__{hellboy}
<P>__{(to clay)}
<D>__{hey, hey, hey. they're playing our song.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{we're on the move.}
<C>__{hellboy}
<P>__{(to myers)}
<D>__{c'mon, champ! happy halloween!!! you're taking me for a walk!}
