<D>__{maybe the world is a bad place but the captain gone has to be some improvement. and that hope, that tomorrow will be better, is enough to keep me going.}

<A>__{x close. journal. a not too loopy feminine hand, writing the words we are hearing.}
<C>__{erin's voice}
<D>__{when i think of lauren fighting and dying, it tears me apart, but it also reassures me. that lauren and alex were meant for each other.}
<A>__{reveal... erin is writing the journal, but she's a radically transformed wild child. a shock of vividly colored dreadlocks, some of the holes that stitched her mouth shut kept permanently open by studs.}
<C>__{erin's voice }
<D>__{that they're together now. fighters. united by love. and anger. that they've given also to me.}
<A>__{she's leaning up against a new headstone. "alex corvis 1981 1999 always with us."}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{i love alex. as my sister always hoped i would. and i love lauren. and i know, because of this, that love does not die. i'm alive. thinking of them. hoping that, sometimes, they're thinking of me.}
<A>__{erin stops writing, closes the journal, stands. she takes the locket off her neck, drapes it over alex's headstone, like the one already over lauren's. she stares at the two a moment, then puts her index finger to her lips, transfers kisses to the two stones. and leaves.}
