<A>__{as he squeezes the cable release flash the image momentarily freezes on hi beaming, nathan jr. staring, and ed looking at hi with a little bit of concern.}
<B>__{dark field same night}
<A>__{the rolling thunder has built to a thunderclap at the cut, and the flash of the polaroid match cuts to lightning throwing a momentarily harsh glare on the field. rain beats down on the bare patch of ground we are looking at by now just a patch of mud. faraway lightning flickers and we hear the rumble of more thunder approaching, then suddenly: thwack a head pops up out of the mud. it is gale, the con we saw in group therapy. he bellows as lightning and thunder flash and crack nearby. his head is covered with mud, although the driving rain is already starting to wash it away. we are beginning to track in an arc around gale's head, who is now struggling, working to get his shoulders and arms up out of the mud. the end of the 180 degree arc and a flash of lightning reveal, way in the distance, the wire topped walls of a penitentiary. still bellowing, as if in some primal rage, gale has gotten his muck covered arms up out of the earth and is now pushing down to haul up the rest of his body. it comes with much effort, and with the loud sucking popping sounds of the fiercely clinging mud. finally he is free. with a great cry, the mud covered man plunges his right arm straight back down into the earth, all the way up to his shoulder. he gropes intently and then, apparently having grabbed hold of something underground, he starts pulling. his arm comes slowly back up out of the mud. clasped in his hand is a human foot. bellowing with effort he continues to pull, liberating the foot... leg... torso of his companion, and finally his head. as the rain starts to wash the mud off his companion's head we see that it is his friend evelle. both are bellowing. mud sucks and pops. thunder crashes.}
