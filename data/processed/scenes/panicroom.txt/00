<D>__{this film is short. this film is fast.}
<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{exterior manhattan day}
<A>__{the whole island, from the south. for a second. literally.}
<L>__{exterior new york skyline day}
<A>__{closer, just the skyline. for another second.}
<L>__{exterior upper west side day}
<A>__{closer still, the upper west side. for another second. no time to waste admiring the scenery.}
<L>__{exterior west 83rd street day}
<A>__{race across a field of pedestrians to pick up three women hurrying down the sidewalk. lydia lynch, a real estate broker, vaults down the sidewalk, she's got a hell of a stride. meg altman, thirtyish, struggles to keep up with her, she's tall, wafer thin, pale as a ghost. sarah, a nine year old girl, flat out runs to keep up, dribbling a basketball as she goes. the kid's athletic, much tougher than meg, who she resembles. lydia reads from a sheet she carries in her bouncing hands.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{ seventeen feet wide, fifty five feet deep, forty two hundred square feet, four floors with a rentable basement apartment, so five altogether, courtyard in back }
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{could you slow down a little?}
<P>__{(looking back over her shoulder)}
<D>__{or we could wait for the car...}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{no cars. feet are faster.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{how many more do we have after this?}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{none, there's nothing else, you know how tight the market is.}
<C>__{meg}
<D>__{this is it? i told you on the phone, i have to be moved in in two weeks. sarah, please don't bounce that here.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{mom, it's the sidewalk.}
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{oh, that miserable little prick is already leaving.}
<A>__{they approach a row of brownstones, narrow four story townhouses, nice looking buildings, a hundred years old or more. evan, a sour looking man, has just locked the front door of number 26 and is coming down the steps. he sees them coming.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{one day you will learn to respect other people's time, lydia, one day you }
<C>__{lydia}
<D>__{evan, i am so sorry, you were a saint to wait for us!}
