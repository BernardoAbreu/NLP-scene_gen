<A>__{as it parks. jackson gives nico a look: "what are we stopping at this dive for"?}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{i gotta take a quick leak. stay put.}
<A>__{he gets out of the car, starts for the bar.}
<L>__{interior buckshot's liquors day}
<A>__{dim, smoke choked, dangerous characters at the bar. nico enters. his silk shirt and sport coat clash with the druggy, working class attire of the bar's denizens. hard faces check him out subtly, ignore him. nico approaches the bartender, shows a photograph. the bartender (bad dude) shakes his head.}
<C>__{bad dude}
<D>__{why the fuck don't you assholes leave me alone?}
<A>__{he continues mouthing off to nico. nico moves to one stool, then another; the same exchange is repeated.}
<B>__{favor one particularly tough customer}
<A>__{a hulking bruiser with an earring. he watches as }
<B>__{nico}
<A>__{approaches him. three army jackets look up sullenly. beefy arms, tattoos, greasy mustaches.}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{gentlemen.}
<A>__{one jacket treats him like he doesn't exist, and begins to pick his nose.}
<C>__{first army jacket}
<P>__{(to others)}
<D>__{i thought this was a kosher bar. they didn't allow no pork in here.}
<A>__{the two others snicker, then so does the rest of the bar. nico holds out a photo of a young girl (lucy).}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{you seen this girl?}
<C>__{second army jacket}
<D>__{i seen the top of her head.}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{that's witty.}
<A>__{nico takes a step away, as if moving on to the next stool. from behind the bar, the bartender swings a sawed off baseball bat into view. other bodies move ominously toward nico. suddenly he spins and, in a move almost too quick to see, he kicks the entire stool right out of its floor socket. beer bottles fly, bodies crash. nico slams the first jacket in the face so hard it looks like his nose has exploded. blood sprays onto nico's silk shirt. he hauls the second jacket upright, nails him with a shot that crushes three ribs. a savage elbow blasts the third, head over heels, out over the bar and careening into the sink. in three seconds pounds of fat has been put in cold storage. the rest of the bar is on its feet. four huge men confront nico. now five. six. seven. nico's jacket and shirt are ripped, blood spat tered; his eyes are like an animal's, daring the men }
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{come on. show me something.}
<A>__{no one moves.}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{i get it. it's a gay bar. is that it?}
<A>__{the men, led by the bad dude, are shifting to surround nico. but no one attacks. nico has lucy's photo in his hand. he jams it in one man's face, then another's, slap ping each one violently, spitting, raging for them to attack.}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{you seen the top of her head, huh? like i seen your mother's }
<P>__{(to another guy)}
<D>__{or was it yours?}
<P>__{(to a third)}
<D>__{or yours?}
<P>__{(slaps him fero ciously)}
<D>__{i couldn't tell, it looked like her ass }
<A>__{nico rages like a beast.}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{come on, motherfuckers. do it. do it! one man }
<A>__{nico lunges for the bad dude, grabs him like he's about to tear his face off }
<C>__{bad dude}
<D>__{upstairs!}
<P>__{(in terror)}
<D>__{she's upstairs! 4 d!}
<A>__{nico drags the dude from behind the bar. holding him, nico turns, glowering, to all.}
<C>__{nico}
<D>__{you cocksuckers are brave enough with 14 year old girls.}
