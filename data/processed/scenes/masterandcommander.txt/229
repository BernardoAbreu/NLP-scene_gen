<A>__{lying on his bed, in some pain, stephen hears thudding feet, shouted orders. in his weakened state, the sounds tend to merge. his pitching cabin keeps swimming out of focus. there's a knock on the door and jemmy ducks appears with a mug of soup and some biscuit.}
<C>__{jemmy ducks}
<D>__{...sail on the horizon, sir. hull down, running west. it may be a couple of days before we can catch her.}
<A>__{stephen nods, all he wants is quiet. jemmy ducks retreats, as stephen swigs from a little bottle of laudanum, which for a moment brings peace, effectively blocking out the noise from above. a smile to padeen, like a farewell, and he closes his eyes.}
