<A>__{c 1 neff's office night neff sits before the dictaphone. there are four cylinders on end on the desk next to him. he gets up from the swivel chair with great effort and stands a moment unsteadily. the wound in his shoulder is paining him. he is very weak as he slowly crosses to the water cooler. he takes the blood stained handkerchief from inside his shirt and soaks it with fresh water. the office door opens behind him. he turns, hiding the handkerchief behind his back. in the doorway stands the colored man who has been cleaning up downstairs. he is carrying his big trash box by a rope handle.}

<C>__{colored man}
<D>__{whatever you say, mr. neff.}
<A>__{he closes the door slowly, staring at neff with an uneasy expression. neff puts the soaked handkerchief back on his wounded shoulder, then walks heavily over to his swivel chair and lowers himself into it. he takes the dictaphone horn and speaks into it again.}

<D>__{that was the longest night i ever lived through, keyes, and the next day was worse, when the story broke in the papers, and they were talking about it at the office, and the day after that when you started digging into it. i kept my hands in my pockets because i thought they were shaking, and i put on dark glasses so people couldn't see my eyes, and then i took them off again so people wouldn't get to wondering why i wore them. i was trying to hold myself together, but i could feel my nerves pulling me to pieces....}
