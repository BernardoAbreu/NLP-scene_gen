<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior arlington cemetery med. shot day}
<A>__{klaatu and bobby are approaching a bench beside a pathway overhung with trees. bobby leads the way to the bench and they sit down. klaatu's eyes stray out to the myriad crosses.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(reflectively)}
<D>__{did all these people die in wars?}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(somewhat surprised)}
<D>__{sure. didn't you ever hear of arlington cemetery?}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{no i'm afraid not.}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(very serious)}
<D>__{mr. carpenter" you don't seem to know about anything.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{i will tell you, bobby i've been away for a long time. very far away.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{is it different where you've been?}
<P>__{(indicating the cemetery)}
<D>__{don't they have places like this?}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{they have cemeteries. but not like this one... you see, they don't have any wars.}
<A>__{bobby looks at him, puzzled and impressed by this incomprehensible notion.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{gee that's a good idea.}
<A>__{his eyes are drawn subconsciously out to the rows of crosses. then he turns back to klaatu with a slow dawning look of curiosity, and klaatu deliberately changes the subject.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{what would you like to do this afternoon?}
<A>__{after a moment bobby's expression changes and he breaks into a broad grin.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{go to the movies.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{all right.}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(he didn't dare hope for this)}
<D>__{no foolin'? will you?}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{certainly.}
<P>__{(then he hesitates)}
<D>__{tell me, bobby do you have to have money to go there?}
<A>__{bobby gives him a look of amazement, then grins, assuming klaatu was kidding and simply hasn't any money.}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(eagerly)}
<D>__{i've got some money. my mother gave me two dollars.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{no i want to take you to the movies.}
<P>__{(he takes some objects out of his pocket)}
<D>__{do you think they'd accept these?}
<A>__{close shot klaatu's hand sparkling in his palm are eight or ten cut diamonds of various sizes. two shot klaatu and bobby the boy is staring at the stones in wide eyed amazement.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{gee those look like diamonds!}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{some places that's what people use for money. they're easy to carry and they don't wear out.}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(staring at them fascinated)}
<D>__{bet they're worth about a million dollars.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<D>__{would you give me your two dollars for a couple of them?}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(with a nervous, unsure smile)}
<D>__{well, sure, but }
<A>__{the boy studies klaatu's face to see if he's kidding. realizing that he's not, bobby's face takes on a childishly shrewd expression as though he were about to trade a jackknife for an ocean liner.}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{the boy takes out two dollar bills and offers them almost challengingly. klaatu takes the bills and hands bobby two good sized diamonds. they study their new acquisitions with interest. bobby looks up from his diamonds to steal a guilty glance at klaatu.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{let's not say anything to my mother about this, mr. carpenter.}
<C>__{klaatu}
<P>__{(mildly curious)}
<D>__{why not, bobby?}
<C>__{bobby}
<P>__{(gravely)}
<D>__{she doesn't like me to steal from people.}
