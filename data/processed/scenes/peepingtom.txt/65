<L>__{exterior the courtyard. early evening}
<A>__{don jarvis strides across the courtyard. we can almost hear and perhaps we do a cash register ringing up. one of the white clad figures lounging indolently in the doorway glances round, sees the inquisition approaching and freezes. his degree of terror might satisfy mark. the great man strides on.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior entrance to stage e. early evening}
<A>__{vivian pauses in front of the entrance to the set. above the note is a notice: 'no admittance while red light is on'. the light is out. vivian looks round there is no one in sight. vivian slips in quietly, and closes the door behind her.}
<L>__{interior studio early evening}
<A>__{the set is in darkness. close shot of vivian looking round.}
<C>__{vivian}
<P>__{(in a whisper)}
<D>__{mark...?}
<A>__{no reply. vivian hesitates... then edges slowly forward. ahead of her are shadowy counters full of merchandise. beyond them is the door of the lift. close shot of the studio camera and the director's empty chair beside it. close shot of vivian edging forward.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{mark...?}
<A>__{she reaches one of the counters and leans against it, looking around. reverse angle shot of vivian. she is leaning against the counter of the trunk department. trunks and suitcases at 'greatly reduced prices' are piled behind her. close shot of vivian. she starts whistling nervously under her breath. very faintly overlaid is the sound of mark whistling under his. vivian stops whistling and so does mark. she listens intently for a moment then peers at her watch. close shot of the watch on mark's wrist. close shot of vivian. she shivers suddenly... then looks at her watch again. she hesitates... then turns towards the exit, and starts to edge back. she trips over a cable and almost falls. suddenly she is bathed in light. she wheels round. one of the big spots is beating down on her.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{mark...?}
<A>__{no sign of him. overlaid is a gentle purring sound. where are another light comes on, shining through her hair.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{mark!}
<A>__{the sound of his steps is overlaid.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{listen... we must...}
<A>__{his footsteps stop... she looks round.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{where are you?}
<A>__{his voice is quietly overlaid.}
<C>__{mark }
<D>__{here, viv...}
<A>__{she wheels round. close shot of mark sitting in the director's chair. he is holding in his lap his cine camera, and a black bag. close shot of vivian breathing quickly.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{you frightened me!}
<A>__{he looks at her in silence.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{now listen... they're working late on the lot.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i know. they're branched off this stage i'm using their juice.}
<A>__{he nods, staring at her intently.}
<C>__{vivian}
<D>__{we must call it off... someone's bound to see us.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{they might...}
<P>__{(rising slowly)}
<D>__{... but they won't interrupt us while we're filming... i've put the red light on.}
