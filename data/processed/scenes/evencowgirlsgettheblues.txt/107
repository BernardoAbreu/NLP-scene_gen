<A>__{he yells out the window of the moving vehicle.}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{don't ever bet against paradox, ladies...}
<L>__{exterior the rubber rose gates}
<A>__{we hear the chink yelling, and the rubber rose sign is being changed to one that reads el rancho jellybean.}
<C>__{chink}
<D>__{....if complexity doesn't beat you, then paradox will. ha ha ho ho and hee hee.....}
<A>__{and the truck disappears into the prairie land. a long dark pause, until finally we are inside the cave where the chink's clockworks are at work..... poing! it is revealed that sissy is with delores snug in the old hermit's living quarters. she listens to the clinking of the chink's clockworks. and feels her belly. the swell of her belly has forced her to sleep on her back. close view of sissy's belly, and a little foot kicks from inside. or is it a foot? view inside the belly of sissy's unborn baby. it is half japanese, one thirty second siwash and all thumbs. the moving thumbs are hitchhiking you.....}
