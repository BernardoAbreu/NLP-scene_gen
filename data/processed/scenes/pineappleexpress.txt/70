<L>__{exterior pay phone continuous}
<A>__{as dale walks out of his phone booth, we see that saul is on the phone in the next booth and is also smoking from a pipe.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{alrghit, i will see you soon. and i'm sorry again about the clocks.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{ha! what a douche bag.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{yeah, love you too.}
<A>__{saul hangs up and exits the phone booth.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{yo, so before we go on the lamb i gotta go see my grandma, okay? she was worried `cause i didn't show up to help with the locks. but before that i've got to smoke another bowl.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{are you joking? you're actually gonna smoke marijuana?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{how can you smoke marijuana after what we just went through? that clearly happened because we were smoking marijuana.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{no. it happened because those fucking kids didn't keep that shit on the down low. which is weird, `cause they really seemed like cool kids.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{if you haven't noticed, we're not very functional when we're stoned, saul.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{when i saved you with those slurpees i was stoned. what do you gotta say to that? maybe the pot is what gave me the creative capacity to come up with such a great plan! the beatles were high!}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{you didn't save me! she was going to protect us, and now we're wanted for all sorts of crazy shit!}
<A>__{saul lights his bowl.}
<C>__{dale }
<D>__{fine. smoke marijuana. but you know how "scarface" ends. face down, dead, in your own fuckin' water fountain.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{for one thing, i'm done dealing pot. mostly, because i don't know where i would get it now, but still. and "b", fuck you, man. you can't judge me. we're exactly the same, and this whole thing's your fucking fault. you're the one who dropped the roach!}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{it's not my fault!}
<A>__{dale points at saul's bowl.}
<C>__{dale }
<D>__{it's marijuana's fault!}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{stop calling it marijuana!}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{grow up, you fucking two year old.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{see! this is why you're a douche bag, denton. because you think you're better than others, but you're just a dumb pothead burnout, same as me.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{maybe i am a pothead burnout, but at least i'm not the dumbest most annoying guy in the world. the only reason i ever bought weed from you was because you're shit is so good, not because you're cool.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{but you said you bought when you already had a few times, just to hang out?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{bullshit! i just like...liked having lots of different kinds of weed at once.}
<A>__{saul takes out his wad of cash and throws half of it at dale.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{here. buy yourself a good last meal.}
<A>__{he throws fifty more cents at the shocked dale.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{super size it, bitch.}
<A>__{saul walks off.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{saul! i'm sorry, man! i didn't mean all that! saul!}
<A>__{a sad dale starts picking up the money.}
