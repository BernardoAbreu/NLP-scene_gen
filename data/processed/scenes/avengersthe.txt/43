<A>__{steed swivels 'round to face upside down a man hanging like a bat from the ceiling inches before him pommaded hair, fat, dandyish: mother, head of secret services; hands of extendable metal hooks. and brenda, his beautiful leather clad bodyguard. who smiles seductively.}

<D>__{mother. i thought you were burglars.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{brenda and i thought we'd drop in.}
<A>__{mother suits action to the word, drops into his wheelchair.}
<C>__{brenda}
<D>__{see how you're getting on ...}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{something in the wind?}
<A>__{mother wheels himself from the study. taps a barometer. it whirls around.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{weather's turning nasty.}
<C>__{steed}
<D>__{you didn't come to talk about the weather, surely.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{oh yes i did. i want you to meet somebody.}
