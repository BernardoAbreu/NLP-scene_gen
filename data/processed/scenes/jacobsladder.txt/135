<A>__{the dark chamber is filled with mournful creatures being led by demons through a series of corridors. no one fights or struggles. jacob's stretcher is moved through the darkness. he tries to sit up but is forced back down. he is obviously drugged. jacob is wheeled into a tiny chamber. a number of demons are waiting for him. chains and pulleys hang from the ceiling. they are lowered and attached with speed and efficiency to jacob's arms and legs. the devices are manipulated smoothly and jacob is lifted off the stretcher. the chains retract, stretching him spread eagle in the air. he screams loudly.}

<A>__{the demons laugh. there is the sound of a huge door closing. jacob is left in darkness. the darkness is hallucinogenic. fires appear beyond the boundaries of the wall; images of dante's inferno, souls of the dead in endless torment. jacob is but one of countless beings sharing a vastness of torment. his own screams for help are lost in the magnitude of voices crying. suddenly, out of the meancing shadows, a contingent of demons emerges. they are carrying sharp surgical instruments. they surround jacob, their eyes glistening as bright as their blades. jacob is panting and sweating with fear. for an instant, one of the demons looks like jezzie. jacob calls out to her.}
