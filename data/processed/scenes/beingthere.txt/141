<L>__{interior eve's room night}
<A>__{eve turns on a soft lamp, chance goes directly to her tv, turns it on.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i can sense that you've been through a lot, chauncey. but one day, when you feel like it, you'll tell me all about your life...}
<P>__{(chance watches an old movie)}
<D>__{... but, even if you tell me nothing, even if it's too painful for you to reveal your past...}
<A>__{as she talks, chance watches a love scene on tv. the hero gives his lady a passionate kiss and embrace. the scene seems to 'sink into' chance's mind. he abruptly turns, takes eve into his arms and kisses her full on the mouth. just as abruptly, he turns away and changes channels on tv.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(breathless)}
<D>__{oh, chauncey... i do love you so much!}
<A>__{she takes chance in her arms, kisses him wildly. they fall to her bed in an embrace. as she holds him, kisses him, runs her hands over his body, chance watches television, neither resists nor responds to eve's caresses. suddenly she stops, lets her head fall on chance's chest.}
<C>__{eve }
<D>__{... you don't want me, chauncey... you don't feel anything for me... nothing at all...}
<A>__{chance sits up on the bed, then, feeling her sadness, gently strokes her hair as he looks at tv.}
<C>__{eve }
<D>__{i just don't excite you at all... i don't know what you want... i don't know what you like...}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{i like to watch.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(not understanding)}
<D>__{to watch...? to watch me...?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes. i like to watch.}
<C>__{eve}
<P>__{(uncertain)}
<D>__{... is that all you want...?}
<P>__{(a hesitation)}
<D>__{... to watch me...?}
<C>__{chance}
<D>__{yes. it's very good, eve.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{... but i've never done...}
<P>__{(another hesitation)}
<D>__{... you mean...? when... when... when i do it? ... when i touch myself...?}
<A>__{eve slowly gets up from the bed, nervously paces the bedroom as chance watches tv. she makes a decision, moves to chance, kisses him.}
<C>__{eve }
<P>__{(getting aroused)}
<D>__{oh, chauncey...}
<A>__{she steps back, slips off her dress. she does not undress any further, instead, leans close to chance.}
<C>__{eve }
<D>__{one of those little things you don't know about me yet, darling i'm a little shy.}
<A>__{she smiles, gets in bed and pulls the covers over herself. chance divides his attention between eve and the tv, watching both with an equal detachment. eve begins to respond to her own touch, finds a heretofore undiscovered pleasure with her own body. chance changes the channel as she reaches orgasm. as eve's body trembles, chance yawns, gets up from the bed.}
<C>__{chance}
<P>__{(going to door)}
<D>__{good night, eve.}
<A>__{a low purr is heard from eve as chance leaves.}
