<L>__{exterior carter's house, back porch continuous}
<A>__{jessica sees carlos standing against a post on the back porch drinking his beer. he is surrounded by several partygoers, but isn't talking to any of them.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{hey.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{where you been?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{talking to carter.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{is he gonna help?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{he said he would.}
<A>__{carlos pulls a pint of whiskey out of his back pocket.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{look. wanna shot?}
<A>__{jessica accepts the whiskey and takes a long pull. she holds onto the whiskey without saying anything, and carlos does not object. she begins to take in the sights and sounds of the party, and notices corey leaning against a rusty old washing machine near the keg as pedro hands him another beer. jessica's pov as corey spots her standing next to carlos. he continues to stare at jessica, clearly taken by the sight of her, his eyes locking onto hers. the desperation of their individual struggles is lost for a moment.}
<C>__{pedro}
<D>__{you want me to talk to her?}
<A>__{the moment quickly passes as corey turns his attention back to pedro.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{pedro}
<D>__{si. so let's go fix the tire on the mustang.}
<A>__{corey attention is again drawn to the ping pong game, and jessica takes note.}
<C>__{carlos}
<P>__{(to jessica)}
<D>__{you wanna play?}
<A>__{carlos motions toward the large kitchen window. jessica turns to look through it.}
