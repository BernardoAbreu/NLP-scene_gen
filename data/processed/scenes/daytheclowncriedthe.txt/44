<L>__{interior guard's shack night}
<C>__{guard}
<P>__{(annoyed at being bothered)}
<D>__{come in!}
<A>__{the meek and frightened helmut enters the shack and walks over to the guard's desk, and his eyes go immediately to the tray of food. while the guard just stares at him... somewhat shocked at his presence in the shack.}
<C>__{guard}
<P>__{(breaking the silence)}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing here? who gave you permission to leave your quarters?}
<A>__{helmut tries to talk as the guard gets louder and louder.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{are you some kind of privileged character?}
<A>__{helmut nods no...}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{then what are you doing out of the barracks?}
<A>__{the frustration of not being able to answer, and the frustrations of being hungry... and the child like treatment helmut is getting from this pig becomes emotionally too much... as he screams...}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(turning red)}
<D>__{if you'll shut your stupid mouth maybe i can answer one of your questions!}
<A>__{the guard looks at helmut in disbelief... but at the same time a little delighted at this chance to show his german superiority... as he slowly gets up from behind the desk and crosses to helmut, with a sneer that would frighten rommel...}
<C>__{guard}
<P>__{(nose to nose with helmut)}
<D>__{i have a stupid mouth?}
<A>__{helmut backs away towards the door, and the guard moves closer and closer to him... backing him up against the door.}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(meekly)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i didn't mean to raise my voice...}
<A>__{he bows his head in fear, as well as concern for what he might have done to his chances of release.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{the volume of your voice isn't the issue... it's what comes out of your mouth that disturbs me... maybe you need a little lesson in respect and courtesy...}
<A>__{and he smacks helmut across the face with his black glove...}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{... and maybe i've been a little too soft with you...}
<A>__{he smacks him again, harder... the glove now feels like a sword to helmut... and his hands hang limp down by his sides.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{you see, doork, i knew why you came in here... i knew why you left your barracks without permission... it's just that i hadn't heard you mention your release papers for so long i had hoped i could hear you begging once more...}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(in a whisper)}
<D>__{i'm sorry...}
<C>__{guard}
<P>__{(mimicking him)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i'm sorry... you're a sorry specimen of a human being... that's what you are...}
<A>__{and he smacks him this time with all the force he can muster...}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{now, i will help you to your quarters, herr doork, here you will stay, and pray for release papers that may, or may not, ever come...}
<A>__{this wakes helmut's soul and he becomes erect and stonefaced at the words the guards just said... this look infuriates the guard even more... he grabs helmut by the scruff of the neck... like grabbing a wet cat to be thrown out of the house... and he opens the door and pulls helmut by the back of the office... out the door, down the three steps and onto the ground... and pulls him like a sack of potatoes to the barracks doorway...}
