<L>__{interior est room late afternoon}
<A>__{there are four other aides in there, standing around an empty gurney. a doctor is at the head of the gurney, a nurse alongside of him.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<P>__{(as he enters)}
<D>__{hi...}
<A>__{mcmurphy looks around at the six aides.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{you boys can take a cigarette break now...}
<A>__{the nurse smiles at him.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{that's all right, mister mcmurphy, just climb on the bed and lie down...}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{whatever you say, doc...}
<A>__{mcmurphy climbs on the bed and lies down. the doctor moves around to the side of the bed and takes mcmurphy's pulse, while the nurse dips her fingers into a jar of salve.}
<C>__{doctor}
<P>__{(to mcmurphy)}
<D>__{this won't hurt you at all...}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{uh, uh...}
<A>__{the nurse starts applying salve to mcmurphy's temples.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{what's that for?}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{conductant.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<P>__{(smiling up at her)}
<D>__{surely, goodness and mercy will follow this, eh, honey?}
<C>__{doctor}
<P>__{(holding a mouthpiece)}
<D>__{please, put this in your mouth...}
<A>__{mcmurphy takes the bit in his teeth. the doctor moves back to the head of the gurney and places the thongs on mcmurphy's temples. the doctor nods to the six aides, who move in and gently place their hands, in a very professional manner, on mcmurphy's knees, hips and shoulders. once set, the doctor turns to his controls. shot of mcmurphy as he looks around, not nearly as scared as he is mystified by the whole process, when suddenly, without warning, mcmurphy is hit by the shock. his face is a contorted mask of surprise and pain. his whole body caught in a sudden spasm. a moment of rigidity, then mcmurphy passes out and his body relaxes. another moment, then a series of violent body spasms begin flowing down his body. now the aides' function is very clear, as they press down, holding mcmurphy firmly to the gurney, until the last spasm subsides.}
