<A>__{beth and neil's place. neil comes in holding a few messily packed boxes. he is clearly moving back in.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{how did all this stuff fit in here fine before?}
<A>__{beth comes in after him, holding some of his clothes.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{i don't know. it expanded.}
<A>__{neil collapses on the couch. beth sits next to him, a pile of clothes on her lap. she looks down and laughs.}
<C>__{beth }
<D>__{no you are not trying to bring these back in here }
<A>__{beth holds the cargo pants that she protested before.}
<C>__{neil}

<D>__{they're going. i have a bag i'm taking to the goodwill.}
<A>__{neil watches her, smiling, as she walks across the room.}
<C>__{neil}
<D>__{okay, okay. you win. just check to make sure there's nothing in the pockets before we give them away.}
<A>__{beth dutifully puts her hands in the pockets. and then she feels something. her face registers curiosity as she pulls out a black velvet ring box. beth looks at it, and when she looks up neil's down on one knee.}
<C>__{neil }
<D>__{i love you so much. so much. i want to make you happy. i need to make you happy for me to even have a shot at being happy, too.}
<A>__{tears stream down beth's face. neil pops open the box, revealing an engagement ring.}
<C>__{neil }
<D>__{will you marry me?}
<A>__{neil gets up and kisses her. they kiss, passionately, for a long moment. and then:}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{yes. of course, yes.}
