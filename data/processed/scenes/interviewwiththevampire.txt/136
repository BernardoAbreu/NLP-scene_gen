<C>__{louis}
<D>__{but it has. there is no more to tell.}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{but you talk about passion, about longing, about things i will never know in my life! it's still inside you, in every syllable you speak! and then you tell me it ends like that? just empty?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{it's over, i'm telling you...}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{you need a new passion, louis, a new reason to feel... what a story you've told, you don't understand yourself.}

<C>__{louis}
<D>__{do what you want with it. learn what you can. give the story to others.}
<A>__{malloy rises.}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{you have another chance, louis. take me! give me your gift, your power...}
<A>__{louis is slowly horrified, then outraged and angry.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{is this what you want? you ask me for this after all i've told you?}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{if i could see what you've seen, feel what you've felt i wouldn't let it end like this! you need a like to the world out there, a connection... then it won't end like this...}

<D>__{don't say anymore. the reels are still turning. i have but one chance to show you the meaning of what i've said.}
<A>__{he looks at the boy. then suddenly grabs him, lifts him off the floor, bares his terrifying fangs and brings them to his throat. malloy screams, in involuntary terror.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you like it? you like being food for the immortals? you like dying? is it beautiful? is it intense?}
<A>__{malloy, now terrified, whispers}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{no... please...}
<A>__{louis drops him.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{thank god.}
<A>__{malloy, falls on the floor, terrified. when he looks up, louis has vanished.}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{louis... louis...}
<A>__{he looks up at the tape. it is still turning.}
<C>__{malloy}
<D>__{holy shit...}
<A>__{he shakes his head. he gets up, and with shaking fingers gathers his tapes. he runs out of the room.}
