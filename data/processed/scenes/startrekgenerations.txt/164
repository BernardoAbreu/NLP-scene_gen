<L>__{exterior countryside day (vfx p)}
<A>__{kirk is riding his horse hard over the countryside and across a stream... through a thicket of trees... and finally out onto a rolling plain. there is a large ravine up ahead. kirk sees it and smiles tightly. he spurs his horse faster toward the ravine... the horse is tearing along... comes up to the edge of the precipice, and makes a daring leap to the other side. horse and rider land together and kirk spurs the horse on. but as he rides, we begin to see a change come over him a look of doubt crosses his face. something's not right. he slows the horse to a trot... and then to a complete stop. he sits there for a moment and frowns. turns and looks back at the ravine, which is now a fair distance away. something about that jump is nagging at him... he turns his horse around and then digs in his heels. the horse breaks into a gallop, racing back toward the ravine. kirk grips the reins tight in his hands and then the horse makes the leap across yet again. this time when kirk lands, he brings his horse to an immediate stop. we can see on his face that something is very wrong. he turns and stares at the ravine with a mixture of shock and sadness on his face. in the distance, picard can be seen approaching on a horse of his own. he stops next to kirk. there is a long, quiet moment as the two men sit there side by side. kirk is introspective as he sorts through his feelings...}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(re: ravine)}
<D>__{i must have made this jump fifty times. and every time it scared the hell out of me. but not this time.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{because... it's not real.}
<A>__{a quiet beat. kirk turns and looks toward a particular hill in the distance, shading his eyes against the bright sun. picard follows his gaze and we can now see the distant figure of a woman walking her horse.}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(re: woman)}
<D>__{antonia?}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{she's not real either, is she? nothing here is... nothing here matters...}
<A>__{all euphoria is now gone from kirk it's a moment of self revelation. he glances around.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{it's kinda like... orbital skydiving. exciting for a few minutes... but in the end, you haven't really done anything... you haven't made a difference...}
<A>__{kirk takes a beat, then looks at picard. and in a way, he's truly seeing him for the first time.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{captain of the enterprise, huh?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{close to retirement?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i hadn't planned on it.}
<A>__{there is a passion and a fervor in kirk that we haven't seen until now.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{well, let me tell you something don't. don't let them promote you... don't let them transfer you... don't let anything take you off the bridge of that ship...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{because while you're there, you can make a difference.}
<A>__{the two captains face each other for a moment. picard hears what kirk is saying but also knows that's not the whole story. picard gives him a direct look, and there is something in picard's eyes a glint of resolve and determination.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{you don't need to be on the bridge of a starship. come with me. help me stop soran.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{make a difference again.}
<A>__{a long, silent beat as kirk considers picard. and slowly, unexpectedly, a smile spreads across his face.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{how can i argue with the captain of the enterprise?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{what was the name of that planet... veridian iii?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i take it the odds are against us, and the situation is grim?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{you could say that.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(musing)}
<D>__{of course, if spock were here, he'd say i was being an irrational, illogical human for wanting to go on a mission like that...}
<A>__{and for the first time, we can see the twinkle in his eye that tells us jim kirk is back.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{sounds like fun.}
<A>__{the two men turn and walk away from antonia.and as they walk, a roar of color and sound washes out the screen, as seen before.}
