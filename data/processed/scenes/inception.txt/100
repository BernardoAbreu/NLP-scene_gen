<L>__{interior street, mombasa continuous}
<A>__{eames leads cobb down the quiet street.}
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{word is, you're not welcome in these parts.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{there's a price on your head from cobol engineering. pretty big one, actually.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{you wouldn't sell me out.}
<A>__{eames looks at cobb, offended.}
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{`course i would.}
<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{not when you hear what i'm selling.}
<L>__{exterior balcony of a coffee house later}
<A>__{a ramshackle balcony overlooking a bust street. eames pours.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{inception.}
<A>__{eames's glass stops halfway to his mouth.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{don't bother telling me it's impossible.}
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{it's perfectly possible. just bloody difficult.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{that's what i keep saying to arthur.}
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{arthur? you're still working with that stick in the mud?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{he's a good point man.}
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{the best. but he has no imagination. if you're going to perform inception, you need imagination.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{you've done it before?}
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{yeas and no. we tried it. got the idea in place, but it didn't take.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{you didn't plant it deep enough?}
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{it's not just about depth. you need the simplest version of the idea the one that will grow naturally in the subject's mind. subtle art.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{that's why i'm here.}
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{what's the idea you need to plant?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{we want the heir to a major corporation to break up his father's empire.}
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{see, right there you've got various political motivations, anti monopolistic sentiment and so forth. but all that stuff's at the mercy of the subject's prejudice you have to go to the basic.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{which is?}
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{the relationship with the father.}
<P>__{(downs drink)}
<D>__{do you have a chemist?}
<A>__{cobb shakes his head.}
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{there's a man here. yusuf. he formulates his own versions of the compounds.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{let's go see him.}
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{once you've lost your tail.}
<P>__{(cobb reacts)}
<D>__{back by the bar, blue tie. came in about two minutes after we did.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{cobol engineering?}
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{they pretty much own mombasa.}
<A>__{cobb glances over the balcony.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{run interference. we'll meet downstairs in half an hour.}
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{back here?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{last place they'd expect.}
<A>__{eames downs his drink. rises. walks over to the businessman.}
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{freddy!}
<A>__{the businessman looks up, awkward.}
<C>__{eames}
<D>__{freddy simmonds, it is you!}
<A>__{cobb nonchalantly slips over the balcony dropping hard into the midst of the crowd on the street below.}
<C>__{eames}
<P>__{(looks harder)}
<D>__{oh. no, it isn't.}
