<A>__{bean, kevin & david get into the car. it pulls away, as they drive off, bean sticks his hand of the window and waves a last farewell to alison and jennifer. at last a sentimental moment romantic music swelling like liza minelli at the end of "cabaret". until the waving hand viciously cracks against the wooden front gate as the car squeezes past.}

<A>__{bean nods abruptly, picks up his case, checks his watch and goes. he doesn't look back. kevin and david turn and walk away. david does stop to look back over his shoulder at bean, heading off in the distance. but bean doesn't turn, so david walks on. then there is suddenly a tap on his shoulder. it's bean, ,as though he's magically jumped there. he gives david a big bear hug, a big grin, and then a little wave and heads away. in the distance, he treads on the back of ,some one's shoe.}
