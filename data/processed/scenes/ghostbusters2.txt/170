<L>__{exterior museum night (eclipse)(later)}
<A>__{ecto 2 pulls to the curb across the street from the museum. hundreds of spectators are already there gawking at the building as the ghostbusters jump out and gape at the sight that greets them.}
<L>__{exterior museum their pov building}
<A>__{the building is now totally covered in a shell of psycho reactive slime. city workmen and firemen are trying to cut their way in with blowtorches, jackhammers, power tools and the "jaws of life," but they can't even make a dent.}
<B>__{ghostbusters}
<A>__{they size up the situation as they don their proton packs.}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{it looks like a giant jello mold.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{i hate jello.}
<A>__{they stride manfully across the street and approach the main entrance to the museum.}
<C>__{stantz}
<P>__{(to the fire captain)}
<D>__{okay, give it a rest, captain. we'll take it from here.}
<C>__{fire captain}
<P>__{(skeptical)}
<D>__{be my guest. we been cutting here for three hours. what the hell's going on? you know the titanic arrived this morning?}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{well, better late than never.}
<A>__{the workmen and firemen put down their tools and fall back as the ghostbusters draw their particle throwers.}
<C>__{spengler}
<P>__{(monitoring valences)}
<D>__{full neutronas, maser assist.}
<A>__{they adjust their settings and prepare to fire.}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{throw 'em!}
<A>__{they trigger their throwers and spray the front doors of the building with bolts of proton energy, but it has no effect on the hardened slime.}
<C>__{venkman}
<P>__{(to the firemen)}
<D>__{okay, who knows "cumbaya?"}
<A>__{a few of the firemen and workmen tentatively raise their hands. venkman grabs them and lines them up at the entrance of the museum.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{all right. nice and sweet }
<P>__{(starts singing)}
<D>__{cumbaya, milord, cumbaya }
<A>__{stantz, spengler, winston and the firemen sing along, reluctantly holding hands and swaying to the music.}
<C>__{all}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{cumbaya, milord, cumbaya, cumbaya, milord, cumbaya, oh, lord, cumbaya.}
<A>__{stantz inspects the wall of slime with his infra goggles and finds that they have only managed to open a hole the size of a dime.}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{forget it. the vienna boys choir couldn't get through this stuff.}
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{good effort. now what? should we say supportive, nurturing things to it, ray?}
<C>__{spengler}
<D>__{it won't work. there's no way we could generate enough positive energy to crack that shell.}
<C>__{stantz}
<D>__{i can't believe things have gotten so bad in this city that there's no way back. sure, it's crowded, it's dirty, it's noisy. and there are too many people who'd just as soon step on your face as look at you. but there've got to be a few sparks of sweet humanity left in this burned out burg. we just have to mobilize it.}
<C>__{spengler}
<D>__{we need something that everyone can get behind, a symbol }
<A>__{his eyes fall on ecto 2's new york state license plate which features a line drawing of the statue of liberty.}
<C>__{stantz}
<P>__{(he sees it, too)}
<D>__{something that appeals to the best in each and every one of us }
<C>__{spengler}
<D>__{something good }
<C>__{venkman}
<D>__{and pure }
<C>__{winston}
<D>__{and decent.}
