<A>__{stephan sits amongst the remains of a meal. sarah and her husband are on the beach below, playing with their son. stephan watches them. he senses a presence and turns to find rachel behind him. she sits down, stares down at the beach through her dark glasses. stephan watches, almost holding his breath, working through lightning calculations of how to handle her. but rachel is the first to speak.}

<C>__{rachel }
<D>__{she can never find out.}
<A>__{stephan stares at her, knowing that he has her, that it's already decided. he takes out the envelope and slides it across the table towards her. she examines the ticket and passports inside. then he slides her the black case. we've seen this part of the scene before. she stares at it with disgust, knowing what it is. then she takes it and puts it in her handbag.}

<D>__{my car's waiting outside. it can take you to the airport.}
<A>__{she stands up, an elegant woman at lunch, her dark glasses, her suit... she looks down to sarah, raises a hand in farewell. sarah, not understanding, waves a hand in response, calls something which is lost under the sound of the sea.}
<C>__{stephan }
<D>__{go down to her. say goodbye to her.}
<A>__{rachel stands stock still, staring down at her daughter.}
