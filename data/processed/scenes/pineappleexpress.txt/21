<C>__{saul}
<D>__{so...they're not coming here?}
<A>__{dale shakes his head, on the verge of tears. saul shrugs, sits back down, then picks up his joint and re lites it.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{cool. so, what's your game plan? you gonna call the cops? cause if you do, i'd appreciate it if you left my shit out of this shit.}

<C>__{saul}
<D>__{did you see any blood? was it sick?}
<C>__{dale}

<D>__{heh. ted's cappin' the competition. yo, you want some of this?}
<A>__{saul passes dale the jointerior dale takes the joint and frantically smokes as he paces.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{so, like, exactly what was the sequence of happenings?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{i'm sitting across from ted's smoking a massive joint of that weed you sold me }
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{oh, the pineapple express. it's so rare it's almost a shame to smoke it, like killing a unicorn...with, like, a bomb.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{when i threw it...out...the window...}
<A>__{dale stops pacing and stares at saul. he then looks down at the joint of pineapple weed. saul notices wheels turning in dale's head.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{dale continues staring at the jointerior}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{this weed is actually that rare?}
<C>__{saul}
<P>__{(proudly)}
<D>__{yeah, it's like, "the rarest".}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{so, you are actually the only guy in town with this weed?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{fuckin' rights, i am. red told me he was giving me an "exclusive sneak preview".}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{and am i the only guy you gave it to?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{yeah. so, we're the only guys.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{but, like, another dealer, couldn't identify it, the pineapple weed? like, if they found a roach of it, right?}
<A>__{saul thinks for a moment.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{i could. why?}
<C>__{dale}
<P>__{(panicking)}
<D>__{we should go, we shouldn't be here! we should go!}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{no...seriously, why?}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{i left a roach of this weed in front of ted's house!}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{so what? i leave roaches all over fucking town.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{no, listen they could find the roach and say, "this is pineapple weed, saul's the only guy in town who has pineapple weed, therefore he must have witnessed the murder or know who did let's go kill him."}
<A>__{finally, saul understands.}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{mother of fuck!}
<A>__{he springs to his feet and bolts for the door.}
<C>__{saul }
<D>__{let's go!}
<A>__{dale grabs saul and stops him.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{wait!}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{why!?! let go of me! let's get the fuck out of here!}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{saul, wait! grab anything we might need, like your weed and money and stuff.}
<A>__{saul grabs his bag of weed and shoves it in his backpack. they run for the door.}
<C>__{dale }
<D>__{are you sure you're not forgetting anything?}
<C>__{saul}
<D>__{yes! come on!}
