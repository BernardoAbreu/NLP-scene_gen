<DIAL>__{Okay. Okay. Here we are.}
<ACTION>__{She takes off the blindfold. Kristoff opens his eyes. Before him sits the most beautiful, suped-up sled. Sven poses in front of it -- Vanna White-style.}

<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes. And it's the latest model.}
<CHAR>__{KRISTOFF} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No. I can't accept this...}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You have to. No returns. No exchanges. Queen's orders. She's named you the official Arendelle Ice Master and Deliverer.}
<ACTION>__{Sven shows off the Ice-Master-and-Deliverer medal like he's king of the bucks.}
<CHAR>__{KRISTOFF} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What? That's not a thing.}
<ACTION>__{But he can't help but admire her enthusiasm.}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sure it is. And it even has a cup holder.... Do you like it?}
<CHAR>__{KRISTOFF} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Like it?}
<ACTION>__{He sweeps her up high overhead and spins her around.}
<CHAR>__{KRISTOFF } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{I love it.... I could kiss you!}
<ACTION>__{He drops her, suddenly embarrassed.}
<CHAR>__{KRISTOFF } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{...I could. I mean I'd like to. I'd... may I? We me....I mean, may we? Wait, what?}
<ACTION>__{She gives him a quick kiss on the cheek.}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We may.}
<ACTION>__{He smiles and goes for it. It's a true love's kiss, alright. We move past them to find Olaf enjoying the summer. With his snow cloud safely overhead, he's free to smell the flowers, which he does. Then sneezes his carrot nose off. Sven catches it between his teeth. Olaf gasps as Sven sucks the whole carrot into his mouth. It's gone. Olaf's face sinks in sadness. But not to fear, Sven spits the carrot back out and jams it into Olaf's face where it belongs. It's completely covered in reindeer spit, but Olaf doesn't seem to mind. He hugs Sven happily.}

<ACTION>__{The gates to the castle are wide open. In the courtyard, stands Elsa.}
<CHAR>__{ELSA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Are you ready?}
<ACTION>__{Villagers cheer. Elsa stops and creates an ice rink. The people, skates at the ready, hope onto it and twirl about. Elsa then freezes the fountain in a beautiful design and adds some snow flurries for atmosphere. Anna comes slipping in. Elsa catches her.}
<CHAR>__{ANNA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I like the open gates.}
<CHAR>__{ELSA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{What? Oh, Elsa, they're beautiful, but you know I don't ska--}
<ACTION>__{Elsa grabs Anna's hands and pulls her along on the ice. Anna slips and slides, but laughs in delight. Sven goes slipping past. Kristoff runs after him.}

<CHAR>__{OLAF} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's it. Glide and pivot and glide and pivot.}
<ACTION>__{We pull away slowly, into the sky. We arrive at a bird's-eye view to see that where the castle had crumbled has been repaired with a ice. All is right in Arendelle.}
