<A>__{where the towering windmill once stood is now only a crater about 5 feet deep and 10 feet in diameter, with charred bits of wood and metal strewn everywhere. ground water spurts from the broken well seal. a cantaloupe sized meteorite sits in the center of the crater... two firemen haul out the meteorite as sam and o'dell arrive on the scene. there are paramedics, a coroner and other policemen there as well, and a large area has been cordoned off with police tape. corey is there looking on, as well as chris holt, phil coulter, and other local citizens. tom's remains are carried off in a black bag...}
