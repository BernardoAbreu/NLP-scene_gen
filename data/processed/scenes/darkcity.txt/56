<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{grey limbo}
<A>__{objects float underwater. they rise upwards amidst bubbles, break the surface. a storm at sea dismembered body parts float all the way to the horizon. two foetuses in separate jars are talking to each other through the glass.}
<C>__{foetus 1}
<D>__{this is madness. if we're caught...}
<C>__{foetus 2}
<D>__{shut up. help me with these straps...}
<L>__{interior examination room}
<A>__{white wakes strapped to an exantination table. schreber and the nurse loom above him. the nurse hands schreber a long, chrome syringe. the doctor moves towards white.}
<C>__{schreber }
<D>__{now you must relax, anton.}
<A>__{a door bell rings o.s. the nurse makes for the door.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{leave it!}
<A>__{he's tapping the side of the syringe, squirting out air bubbles. the door bell rings again very insistent. schreber looks at the nurse, annoyed.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{damn! whoever it is get rid of them!}
<A>__{she heads to the door turns back.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{keys.}
<A>__{schreber puts the syringe down, fumbles in his pocket, pulls out a huge collection of keys on a ring, walks to the nurse, hands them to her. white manages to wriggle a hand free from the leather strap holding him. the nurse leaves, the doctor shuts the door, locks it. he steps over to white.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{i'm sorry i had to put you through this, anton.}
<P>__{(lowers syringe to white's forehead)}
<D>__{there will be some pain, but things will be easier this way.}
<A>__{white lashes out, punches the doctor in the face. his glasses go flying, and he falls to the floor, blinded, scrambling for the spectacles. a convenient scalpel cuts white from his remaining bonds. he undoes the last strap around his ankles as the doctor replaces his glasses and leaps at him trying to drive the syringe into white's forehead. the struggle continues each man tries to turn the syringe on the other. white pushes the doctor, who falls backwards. schreber leaps onto him, both fall against a tray of medical instruments. a loud thumping on the examination room door. white is grabbed from behind, pinned down with the syringe inches from his face. a crash o.s. splintering wood. the door bursts open. a rotund silhouette is revealed, clutching a police special, flashing a badge. a squeaky, over excited, voice:}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{hold it!}
<A>__{schreber and white freeze in mid struggle, look at the inspector. behind him, the nurse appears in the hallway.}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{police. nobody move.}
<C>__{schreber}
<D>__{he tried to kill me!}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{shut up! everybody stay calm...}
<A>__{bumstead steps into the light, shoves his gun in white's face, handcuffs him. bumstead searches white, finds the revolver, takes this. also takes his wallet. he glances at the doctor, who hides the syringe behind his back.}
<C>__{bumstead }
<D>__{you schreber?}
<A>__{schreber nods blankly. bumstead runs his hand over white's side pocket feels something.}
<C>__{bumstead}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{white says nothing. the inspector opens the pocket and looks in.}
<C>__{bumstead }
<D>__{a fish, huh?}
