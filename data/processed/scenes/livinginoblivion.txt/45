<L>__{interior the set. morning}
<A>__{a small, elegant bedroom set has been constructed in the middle of the huge empty space. one wall has a fake window. the gaffer lies on the bed staring absently at the ac sitting motionless beside the camera a few feet away. neither speaks for a long moment.}
<C>__{gaffer}
<D>__{i think we got nudity today.}
<C>__{ac}
<P>__{(reads from his callsheet)}
<D>__{it just says "scene six: ellen and damian kiss."}
<C>__{gaffer}
<D>__{could be a kiss with nudity.}
<C>__{ac}
<D>__{i like ellen. she's my type.}
<C>__{gaffer}
<D>__{why is that?}
<C>__{ac}
<D>__{she's pretty. smart. kind of kooky.}
<C>__{gaffer}
<D>__{maybe i will give her a part. that's right; i'm makin' my own movie pretty soon.}
<C>__{ac}
<D>__{oh yeah?}
<C>__{gaffer}
<D>__{yup. feature. i brought my script.}
<A>__{the gaffer tugs a thin, tattered script, folded lengthwise, out of his back pocket.}
<C>__{gaffer}
<D>__{palomino's perfect for the lead. i'm going to give it to him right during lunch. maybe right after.}
<C>__{ac}
<D>__{alright.}
<C>__{gaffer}
<D>__{got to be aggressive. you want to shoot it?}
<C>__{ac}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{gaffer}
<D>__{you ever shot anything?}
<C>__{ac}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{gaffer}
<D>__{that's alright; got to start somewhere.}
<A>__{suddenly the gaffer reaches out and warmly shakes the ac's hand.}
