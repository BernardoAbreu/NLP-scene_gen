<A>__{treves and merrick coming down the stairs. merrick is calm now. they go into the sitting room, where anne is just setting the tea tray out. treves ushers merrick to a highbacked sofa and sits him down. merrick is very shy of anne. treves and anne sit on the other side of the table.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{mr. merrick, sugar?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{yes please, two.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{one or two?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{two, please.}
<A>__{anne serves the tea.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{john loves the house.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{do you?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{oh yes. you have so many nice things, and so much room.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{oh?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{yes, we do have a lot of room. but you should see the place on weekends, when i see patients here. sometimes there are so many, we have to set them down wherever we can. in fact, mrs. treves sometimes says that the only room she can call her own is the bedroom.}
<A>__{treves and anne laugh good naturedly. merrick's face, as always, is quite blank.}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(earnestly)}
<D>__{well, it's a lovely bedroom. what do you call that thing above the bed?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{that's a canopy, john.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{ohhh...}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{how is your tea, john?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{it's very good. i'm enjoying my visit with you very much. it's so very kind of you to have me as a guest in your home. i'm sorry i made a spectacle of myself.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{not at all, john.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{i love the way you've arranged your pictures on the mantlepiece. is that the way it's done in most houses?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{oh yes.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{who are they of?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{oh, our relatives... the children.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{the children! may i see?}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{treves goes to the fireplace and takes down a few pictures. he hands a picture of the girls to merrick.}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(as if looking at an icon)}
<D>__{the children. where are your children}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{oh, they're gone for the day... with friends.}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(the word gives him pleasure)}
<D>__{friends. ah yes, friends! how nice.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{and here is one of frederick's mother.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{how lovely.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{and here are my mother and father.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{they have noble faces.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(a cord is struck)}
<D>__{i've always thought that myself.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{oh, yes.}
<A>__{merrick sets the picture down carefully.}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(ever so timidly)}
<D>__{would you... would you like to see my mother?}
<C>__{treves}
<P>__{(startled)}
<D>__{your mother?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{he reaches into his cloak and brings out the small portrait of the beautiful woman. treves is absolutely amazed. merrick gently hands the picture to anne.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{oh... why mr. merrick she's beautiful.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{she has the face of an angel... she was an angel. she was so kind... so kind to me. it's not her fault, for in the fourth month of her maternal condition she was knocked down by an elephant. i'm sure i must have been a great disappointment to her.}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(visibly touched)}
<D>__{oh no, mr. merrick. no. no son as loving as you are could ever be a disappointment.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{if only i could find her. if only she could see me now, here, with such lovely kind friends. you, mrs. treves, and you, mr. treves. then maybe she would love me as i am. i've tried to hard to be good.}
<A>__{at this, anne is so extremely touched that she begins to cry. she tries to hold it in, but to no avail. she reaches a hand out to merrick and he takes it. he tries to comfort her.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{please... please...}
<A>__{but anne goes on, as treves, in wonder, watches her and merrick locked together in the communication of intense sympathy. rear entrance the london merrick, in the dimly lit rear hall, is huddled over a trash can tucked underneath a stairway. he pulls out a discarded drug box. he holds it closely to his chest and goes into his room. merrick's room merrick goes to his table and puts the box down. he hangs up his disguise, then goes back to the window and pulls the curtains aside. moonlight bathes the table, illuminating the portrait of his mother. john seats himself and sets the box in front of him. he reaches for a pencil, and then begins to draw windows on the front of the box. outside merrick's room (morning) nora is coming down the hall with a breakfast tray. she stops at merrick's door and raises a hand to knock. merrick's room merrick, as before, is hunched over the table, pencil in hand. the sides of the box are covered with carefully drawn windows and archways. there is a knock at the door and merrick, startled, looks up. nora enters and puts the tray on the table. she glances at the box.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{good morning, mr. merrick.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{good morning.}
<A>__{she turns and walks to the cabinet for linen and bath supplies. she opens it and takes out a clean towel and a blanket. she pauses, and turns to look back at the table. merrick is concentrated on his work. nora, curious now, walks to the table. merrick, conscious of her presence, leans back in his chair and looks up at her.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{what is this that you're doing?}
<A>__{merrick is silent.}
<C>__{nora}
<P>__{(pointing at the box)}
<D>__{what is it?}
<A>__{merrick points through the window.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{what? oh! i see! it's st. phillips. oh, of course. why... why that's very good, i mean you've gotten the windows and arches just right.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{but it's so good, i mean... it's so very good.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{thank you... very much.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{where did you get this box?}
<A>__{merrick points out toward the hallway.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{the hallway? oh, the wastecan!}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{i meant no harm, it was the only place where i could find cardboard. i thought it has been thrown away.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{it's alright, it was thrown away. no one wants it. it's just that it's a little dirty, that's all.}
<A>__{she sets the towel and blanket down as she leans closer to inspect the box. she points to a circle drawn on top.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{what's this?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{the main spire.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{the... oh, the spire! how silly of me, it's as plain as day... mr. merrick, where did you learn to do this?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{...i learned a long time ago.}
<A>__{nora looks at the box.}
<C>__{nora}
<D>__{oh, but how will you finish it? you haven't any more cardboard.}
<A>__{merrick, at a loss, shrugs his shoulders. the movement makes nora aware of his body, and he is the elephant man once again.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{i will have to find some more.}
<C>__{nora}
<P>__{(uncomfortably)}
<D>__{yes... well, good day, mr. merrick.}
<A>__{she quickly exits. merrick watches her go and then turns back to his work. he sees the towel and the blanket. he turns quickly to call after nora, but stops himself. merrick takes up the towel and blanket, walks into the bathroom, and carefully drapes the towel over the back of the bath. merrick's room merrick is at his table working on his cathedral. there is a knock at the door.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{come in.}
<A>__{treves enters.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{good morning, john.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{good morning.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{john, there's someone here who would like to meet you. would that be alright?}
<A>__{merrick is a trifle apprehensive, but he agrees. treves ushers mrs. kendal through the door. at the sight of her, merrick's eyes go wide.}
<C>__{treves}
<D>__{john, i'd like you to meet one of the brightest lights of the british stage, mrs. kendal. mrs. kendal, john merrick.}
<C>__{kendal}
<D>__{good day, mr. merrick.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{good day...!}
<C>__{kendal}
<D>__{i've brought you some things. i hope you'll like, mr. merrick. i hope you don't think it too forward.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{oh, no.}
<C>__{kendal}
<D>__{i knew you'd understand. here.}
<A>__{she hands merrick a nicely framed picture of herself. merrick is speechless, overjoyed by the gift.}
<C>__{kendal}
<D>__{i want you to know that i don't go about giving my pictures to just anyone.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{oh, no. i would never think it! it's so beautiful. you are so... i will give it a place of honor, here, next to my mother.}
<A>__{he places it, with great care, next to his mother's portrait.}
<C>__{kendal}
<D>__{she's very pretty, your mother.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{treves smiles at them. merrick is a trifle nervous but mrs. kendal smiles at him and he relaxes a little.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{mr. treves says that you are in the theatre. do you live there?}
<C>__{kendal}
<D>__{oh no, mr. merrick. i just work there.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{well, even to work there would be wonderful. is it beautiful?}
<C>__{kendal}
<D>__{you've never been?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{alas, no.}
<C>__{kendal}
<D>__{well you must go. it is one of the most beautiful places on earth. of course, i'm rather partial.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{tell me about it, please!}
<C>__{kendal}
<D>__{it's very difficult to put into a nutshell, but i should say the theater is the shrine of the imagination, where one may suspend disbelief and travel anywhere in the world, to any time you desire. you may look over the shoulders of kings, unobserved, battle with ruthless tyrants, and marry the beautiful princess, all in the space of a few hours. onstage you may be whoever you wish to be, do anything you please, and always, always live happily ever after. the theatre is all the brightest and best things of the world, mr. merrick. it is lights and music, gaiety and joy. it's... well, it's romance.}
<C>__{merrick}
<P>__{(the magic word)}
<D>__{romance!}
<C>__{kendal}
<D>__{that's one thing the theatre has in great store. which reminds me. i have something else for you...}
<A>__{she produces a beautiful leather bound volume of shakespeare's works. merrick takes it with reverence and begins to leaf through it.}
<C>__{kendal}
<D>__{have you read it?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{no, but i certainly shall.}
<A>__{merrick finds a place and begins to read.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{romeo and juliet. i know of this... "if i profane with my unworthiest hand, this holy shrine, the gentle fine is this: my lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand, to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss."}
<A>__{merrick, embarrassed by these last words, starts to close the book. mrs. kendal knows juliet's lines by heart. she looks at merrick for a moment, then replies tenderly.}
<C>__{kendal}
<D>__{good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, which mannerly devotion shows in this; for saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch, and palm to palm is holy palmer's kiss.}
<A>__{merrick pauses, looking at kendal, then continues.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?}
<C>__{kendal}
<D>__{ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{o, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do. they pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.}
<A>__{they both look at each other for a long, silent moment. treves is touched and amazed.}
<C>__{kendal}
<D>__{why, mr. merrick, you're not an elephant man at all...}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{oh no?}
<C>__{kendal}
<D>__{oh no... no... you're a romeo.}
