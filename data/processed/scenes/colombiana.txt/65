<L>__{interior electrical room night}
<A>__{cat stands on a narrow shelf, undoes the last screws on a vent in the ceiling with a screwdriver from the tool board on one wall. cat drops down, opens the electrical control panel on the wall, studies it for a moment, finds the switch she is looking for, then turns to the wall of tools, plucks some wire, a cutter, a spring. cat sets to work on a jury rigged mechanism with the items at hand. when she is finished, she tugs at the waist band of her mini skirt, and little by little she stretches a thin dun colored leotard suit over her whole body. she takes a small plastic vial, fills it with some water from the tap, and sets it, just so, above the device she has constructed. the device is hooked to the switch she selected, a small weight hangs from the bottom of it by a wire. she sets the water container just so over the spoon from her cell. the water begins to drip a drop at a time. she closes the panel door, sets her digital watch. hoists herself up to the vent in the ceiling, and is gone.}
