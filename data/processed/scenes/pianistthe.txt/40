<C>__{the elderly man}
<D>__{they've got my grandson in there. they pick 'em up, they take 'em away. what do they do to them? i've stopped believing in god!}
<A>__{szpilman scans the mob. the jewish policemen using batons and whips to herd the men. no sign of henryk. szpilman becomes alert. he's seen someone he recognises. heller, with his red hair and hitler moustache, wielding a baton, driving men into the building. with difficulty, szpilman pushes his way through the mob and gets nearer to heller.}

<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{yitzchak!}
<A>__{heller doesn't hear.}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{yitzchak!}

<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{here, please! wladek szpilman!}
<A>__{heller shoves someone aside so that szpilman can approach, but he continues to beat and manhandle people.}

<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{yitzchak, they told me you had influence.}
<C>__{heller}
<D>__{who told you?}
<C>__{szpilman}
<D>__{people i know. they said you're an important man.}
<A>__{heller just glares at szpilman and then moves away. szpilman stands, jostled by the crowd, uncertain, forlorn.}
