<L>__{interior cave home, lower cave day}
<A>__{the old crone comes through a passage in the wet walls. ichabod enters, scared, bent under low ceiling.}
<C>__{old crone}
<D>__{i hear him. he rides to the hollow and back.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{the horseman. yes.}
<C>__{old crone}
<D>__{sit.}
<A>__{ichabod sits on crooked stool. the old crone kneels with her back to him, gathers straw in a pile on the floor.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{can you help?}
<C>__{old crone}
<D>__{you want to see into the nether world... i can show you. whatever you see, do not move or speak. i will hold him.}
<A>__{she gathers bowls, putting grass and powder on the pile.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{what... what are you doing?}
<C>__{old crone}
<P>__{(turns, furious)}
<D>__{close your mouth! keep silent.}
<A>__{she takes two jars from a table, pours ashes on the pile from one. she shakes the other roughly, takes the lid off and upends it. a baby bat squirms on the floor, dazed. the old crone holds the bat, using a knife to cut off its head. she soaks the straw with blood, speaking in tongues, guttural. using a wick, she lights the straw. she grasps two metal cuffs with chains attached, slides these onto her bony wrists, then bends to inhale smoke.}
<C>__{old crone}
<D>__{he comes now.}
<A>__{ichabod would like to leave now.}
