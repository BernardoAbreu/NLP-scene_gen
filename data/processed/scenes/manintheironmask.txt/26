<D>__{... and i only say that... the rotten food was... all my fault... and i take... full responsibility... and beg the forgiveness of you all.}

<B>__{the king}
<A>__{who steps to his advisor and shakes his hand, whispering quietly...}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{well done, pierre. it will be good for your soul, that you have taken responsibility for your errors. and don't worry, i will look after your family.}
<A>__{pierre can only nod... he takes two steps, kneels, crosses himself, and places his head between two upright rails of}
<B>__{the guillotine}
<A>__{the king, pierre, and other attendants are standing on a platform before a crowd of parisians. the blade drops, pierre's head hits the basket, the crowd cheers. the king raises his hands to quiet the crowd.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{do not rejoice but know that your king does not tolerate blunders that hurt his beloved people. more food is on its way, and my advisors tell me the new harvests are sure to be bountiful!}
<A>__{he shoots a glance at his advisors, and they are pale from the display they've just witnessed.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{and i have new joys to announce to you! today we decree a fresh glory for paris, and for all of france! the laying of the foundations to expand versailles, and make it truly a palace of the sun!}
<A>__{the advisors all applaud furiously, but from the crowd there is almost no reaction at all; the triple ranks of soldiers surrounding the square discourage any protest, and as the king leaves the platform the crowd begins to melt away.}

<D>__{how goes that favor i asked of you?}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{i grow closer to my target, your majesty.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{you bring me the heart of the jesuit general, and you will have a palace of your own.}
<A>__{the king moves away, followed by his fawning advisors.}
