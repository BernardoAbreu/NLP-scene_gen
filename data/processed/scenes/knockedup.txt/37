<D>__{nice place, huh?}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{it's really nice.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{sorry it took so long to get a table. i didn't realize you needed a reservation. knocked up 38.}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{that's okay.}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{you look very pretty, though.}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{thanks. yeah, i just thought, i don't know, i thought maybe it'd be cool to hang out a little bit and... we didn't really get to talk much last time so i}
<D>__{thought }
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{that we didn't.}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{i thought maybe we'd just talk and get to know each other...better.}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{cool. okay, i will start. i'm canadian.}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{that's cool.}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{from vancouver. i live here illegally, actually. don't tell anyone. but it works out in my advantage, ultimately, `cause i don't have to pay any taxes. so financially that's helpful `cause i don't have a lot of money. i'm not poor or anything but i eat a lot of spaghetti.}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{so the web page is it just something that you guys do for fun? do you have a real job?}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{well, that is our job.}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{oh.}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{we don't technically get money for the hours we put in, but it is our job.}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{so, how do you...?}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{how do i pay rent and shit?}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{right.}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{when i was in high school, i got ran over by a postal truck.}
<D>__{knocked up 39.}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{oh, my god.}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{it was my foot more than anything. but, i got fourteen grand from the british columbia government.}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{right.}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{and that really lasted me until now. it's been almost ten years. i have like nine hundred bucks left. so that should last me for i'm not a mathematician, but like another two years or some shit...i think.}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{yeah. so, i have something i really need to tell you. it's kind of why i called you. here it goes. i'm pregnant.}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{fuck off.}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{what?}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{what?}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{i'm pregnant...?}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{with emotion?}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{with a baby. you're the father.}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{i'm the father.}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{yes!}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{how the fuck could this happen?}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{i don't know. i thought you were wearing a condom.}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{no.}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{what?}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{i wasn't.}
<D>__{knocked up 40.}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{why not?}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{because you told me not to.}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{what am i talking about? you told me not to.}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{i did not tell you not to wear a condom.}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{here's what happened, okay? i will give you a play by play of my memory. i almost had the condom on my dick. it was on the cusp and then you said, "just do it, already."}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{i didn't mean do it without a condom. i mean "do it" like "hurry up," like "get fucking going!"}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{well, i assumed you were wearing a patch, or like a dental dam or one of those fuckin' butterfly clips or something like that.}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{what the hell is a dental dam?}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{it's like saran wrap! it's disgusting, okay? but i thought you had one. why the fuck didn't you stop me once we started?}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{oh, my god! i don't know! i couldn't tell that you didn't have one on! obviously, i was drunk!}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{was your vagina drunk? did you think it's the thinnest condom on earth i have on? i'm a fuckin' inventor? i made a dick skin condom? he hollowed out a penis and put it on? what the fuck?!}
<C>__{alison}
<A>__{you are unbelievable.}
<C>__{ben}
<A>__{okay, you know what? maybe, i've reacted unfavorably. so what happens now? i don't know how this works.}
<D>__{knocked up 41.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{i am going to the doctor next week...and i thought you could come with me to the gynecologist.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{so you haven't seen him, though?}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{so you don't know if you're pregnant.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{well, i'm not a hundred percent sure.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you're not a hundred percent sure. i bet you're not pregnant.}
