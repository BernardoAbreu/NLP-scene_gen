<D>__{just give me a minute.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{is there a problem?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{that guy in green. sometimes people carry weapons in here. then they drink too much. they're team isn't doing so well, bad things happen... we do random pat downs of the crowd to discourage people from carrying.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{if he's carrying, he'll step out of line.}
<A>__{elijah observes as a security team pats down random males as they move through the turnstiles. the green army jacketed man moves forward in the line. his face is blank as he watches the pat down ahead of him. he's twenty people from the turnsstile. david eyes him. fifteen people away... ten... the man coughs and steps out of the line. elijah watches the green army jacket melt into the thick part of the crowd and disappear as it moves away from the stadium.}
