<A>__{gordon turns to see grant gesturing at the horizon. his eyes widen when he sees the flat mesa they are travelling comes to a sudden halt at a 1000 foot cliff.}
<C>__{president grant}
<D>__{let's see how clever you really are...}
<A>__{gordon frantically starts pulling this lever and that. meanwhile...}

<A>__{west approaches loveless. there's going to be some payback.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{for almost four long years i've been trackin' the animal responsible for the massacre at new liberty. and i hear that's you...}
<A>__{but with the hydraulic fluid, the fight has gone out of loveless. his mechanical legs shrivel before our eyes, and loveless sinks helplessly to the deck like the wicked witch. whimpering pathetically, he uncouples his body from the useless contraption and slowly backs up to his wheelchair that's stuck against the railing.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{please, west... show a little mercy to a poor defenseless cripple...}
<C>__{west}
<P>__{(imitating his accent)}
<D>__{now, now, doctor... let's not cloud this otherwise sunny day with that poor ol' me cripple talk. just buck up and say to yourself, 'i am indefatigably hard pumpin' and steely!'}
<A>__{loveless gets to his wheelchair and collapses in it.}
<C>__{loveless}
<D>__{after i kill ya, i swear i'm gonna boil you down to axle grease!}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{now that's the ol' doctor i know!}
<A>__{but the smile fades from west's face when he sees loveless's shotgun armrests pop out leveled at his waist. west has nowhere to go but up as he leaps to grab the i beam over his head just as loveless pulls the triggers on both barrels... boom! boom! the shots almost blow the heels off west's boots. they puncture a pipe behind him. steam spews out. this is going to have an effect on something.}
