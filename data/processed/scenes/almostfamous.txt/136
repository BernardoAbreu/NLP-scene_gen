<L>__{interior dressing room night}
<A>__{william in the dressing room, eyes red with exhaustion, finally interviewing russell. he holds the mike stoically.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{so when you play a great show like tonight...}
<A>__{dick enters with great urgency.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{okay. i need everybody's attention.}
<A>__{the kid shuts his eyes. he knew this would happen.}
<C>__{dick }
<D>__{alright, well, the rumors are true. the record company has sent a big time manager here to try and talk you into replacing me. his name is dennis hope. i know you've all heard of him. he's got all the big bands. he's right outside. he wants five minutes with you right now. i think we gotta do it.}
<C>__{russell}
<P>__{(pissed)}
<D>__{then bring him in.}
<A>__{william shuts off his tape recorder.}
<C>__{jeff}
<P>__{(arrogant)}
<D>__{bring him in! we'll send him out on a rail!}
<C>__{russell}
<P>__{(to william)}
<D>__{we'll finish on the way to boston. you can fly home from boston.}
<A>__{william nods, exhausted, as dick opens the door. in walks a small general of a man in a baseball t shirt, well trimmed beard and bowl cut. he holds the super new halliburton briefcase. he is dennis hope, 25. a man from the midwest, with a vision of the future of rock and roll. already in his head are all the things that will come to pass. higher ticket prices. merchandising deals. greater distribution and accounting of album sales. he shrugs hello to the band.}
<C>__{dennis hope}
<P>__{(completely unthreatening)}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{russell}
<D>__{we already have a manager. he's been with us from the beginning.}
<A>__{hope appreciates the lack of small talk. he strides the room with the joyful enthusiasm of a kid who wants to build a fort. russell watches, dismissive, holding his guitar.}
<C>__{dennis hope}
<D>__{respectfully. we all have our roots. i believe in bands holding onto their roots. but those roots need to be augmented. i'm gonna tell you the truth i may enrage some and enthrall others. i don't really give a fuck. your manager here needs a manager.}
<A>__{example.}
<D>__{if you hadn't run out on the contract in phoenix, you could have sued over russell's hand... but you left, negating the contract, forfeiting the deposit, and you effectively traveled a long way to pay that promoter... to electrocute you.}
<A>__{russell looks at his hand.}
<C>__{dennis hope }
<D>__{we can all work together. your damages have put you way into the hole for this tour. right now you owe the record company more than you've got. but your record's selling, there's money to be made. so i've brought a plane in, we can add more shows to make up the difference. respectfully.}
<C>__{russell}
<P>__{(immediately)}
<D>__{we travel by bus.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{doris is the soul of this band! that bus has been our home since we were the jeff bebe band.}
<A>__{dick watches his loyal band with admiration.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{hey man it's travel on a pogo stick if i thought we'd make more money. you can play more dates with a plane...}
