<L>__{interior azul's hideout day}
<A>__{the camera dollies past the vacant pool table, and over to a rat sitting in a chair, drinking a beer. the other rat is pacing back and forth in front of the sitting rat. azul enters the room. throwing his guitar case onto the pool table as a grand entrance gesture. the sitting rat stands beside the pacing rat.}
<D>__{rat #1 i'm sorry we left... rat #2 ... we didn't know what to do... rat #1 ... we figured you could defend yourself!!!}
<A>__{rat #2 nods in agreement. azul unsnaps one of the latches. snap!}

<C>__{azul}
<D>__{... against three armed men...}
<A>__{snap!}

<D>__{... using this?}
<A>__{he opens the case and the guitar sparkles at them. the rats exchange glances. they look at the guitar then back at azul.}
<C>__{azul }
<D>__{my case got switched with some maricon mariachi! rat #1 where is this mariachi?}

<C>__{azul }
<D>__{leave me a weapon.}
<A>__{both rats take out their guns. azul takes rat #2's gun.}
<C>__{azul }
<D>__{that was disloyal of you to leave me out there. you should be as loyal to me as you are to each other.}
<A>__{the rats exchange glances, then aim their eyes back to the floor. azul turns to rat #2.}

<D>__{why not? rat #1 you said we should be as loyal to you as we are to each other. i couldn't shoot him, for that would be as disloyal as shooting you.}
