<A>__{with janine as the call goes to voice mail. she hangs up, confused. she sits on the edge of the bed, looking around the room, not sure what to do with herself. she notices a pair of pants and jacket thrown over a chair goes to tidy it up. she picks up the jacket, checks the pockets, they're empty. she grabs the pants, takes them both to the walk in closet. she hangs up the jacket. and as she folds the pants over she hears something hit the ground. she looks down to find a pack of cigarettes. her face pales. she stares at it immobile. her face tightens, her eyes well up.}

<A>__{ as she grabs two armfuls of his clothes off the racks and flies out of the closet. staircase she hurtles down the stairs, throwing armfuls of clothes into the foyer. then, she surveys the scene and, not satisfied, rushes back up the stairs. hallway as she flies back into the bedroom, she sees herself in the antique mirror hanging in the hallway. without even thinking she grabs it from the wall and smashes it on the ground. she stands over it, breathing heavily, looking at the shattered glass. she exits frame and we hear her walk down the stairs, the camera holding on the empty wall. after a beat we hear her walking back up the stairs she enters frame again holding a dustpan and broom. she kneels over and begins sweeping up her mess.}
