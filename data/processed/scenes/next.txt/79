<A>__{cris is still trying to get out the front door, but there's one soldier, call him crack shot, who kills cris repeatedly. cris snapsback and tries various tactics, but he can't get past crack shot alive. he gives up. turns and runs back into the heart of the building. cris' mental pov expands to include the entire facility, like a crystal doll house. simultaneously, he is observing every room, present in every room, charting the place, testing possible actions. the facility is a bee hive of activity. a bee hive that accelerates to fast forward until all times are simultaneous. until the simultaneous activity is made even denser by the accumulated layers of possibility. cris 134 spies ferris and wisdom walking together. he follows them for a while, until he is discovered. cris 134 fades out. the ferris and wisdom who saw him fade out. but another ferris and wisdom continue through the building, and their trail gets picked up by cris 62, who has detoured in order to encounter them. as cris' goals are accomplished, superfluous versions of himself fade away. the surveillance of a sequence of ferris and wisdoms is continued by cris 91, then cris 14, who watches as wisdom and ferris approach two guards standing outside an interrogation room. we recognize them as the mp's who are guarding liz, inside. wisdom is let into the interrogation room by the mp's. ferris proceeds into a nearby office alone.}
