<A>__{laz spins around knocking away ronnie's arm. bam! the gun fires into the wall. the guitar cracks on the floor. rae screams.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{ronnie stop! ronnie!}
<A>__{laz lunges at ronnie but ronnie is faster. he spins laz around and slams him to the floor, pushing his gun into laz's face.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{ronnie looks up at rae, his eyes red with sorrow and rage. he pushes the gun to the side of laz's head. rae cries.}

<C>__{lazarus}
<P>__{(cutting him off)}
<D>__{boy! you so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck.}
<A>__{ronnie can't believe what was just said mostly, because it's true. the gun begins to shake in his hand.}

<D>__{test. shit. what kind'a test you thinkin'? you mean like, if you a man or not? if you a killer? only one way to prove that. you just look me in the eye, boy, and you squeeze that trigger back.}
<A>__{ronnie grips the shaking gun. a severe attack is on the rise as he listens to laz.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{ain't that easy, is it? i been in some scraps, son, i know. first there's that loud crack. always louder than you think. like it just come up a cloud and clapped a mess thunder right in ya hand. bam!}

<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{white light. smell of smoke. taste of my blood and brains in your mouth, stingin' ya eyes.}
<A>__{ronnie almost vomits, but he holds it back.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{oh, baby... just let me...}
<A>__{rae moves closer to him, wanting to comfort him but she stops as ronnie points the gun at her. his eyes pleading for her to stay back.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{goddammit, rae!}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{boy! you keep that gun pointed at me!}
<P>__{(ronnie obeys)}
<D>__{you need to kill a man, all you gotta have is a good reason.}

<A>__{a flood of tears are streaming down ronnie's face. the gun is shaking furiously in his hand.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{don't... don't say that to me...}
<C>__{lazarus}
<P>__{(getting fed up)}
<D>__{son, i'm grown. don't got patience to suffer you children and this monkey junk. i'm too old to play house...}
<P>__{(looks at rae and then back at ronnie)}
<D>__{...and cowboys. so let's have it. end me or get out of my face!}
<A>__{ronnie looks like a scared five year old having an asthma attack. laz barks at him one last time.}
<C>__{lazarus}
<D>__{go'on. do it.}
<P>__{(silence)}
<D>__{do it!}
<A>__{the last shout from laz completely destroys ronnie. his shoulders slump. the gun lowers in his grasp. a low sob is heard as he falls to his knees. laz snatches the gun from his hand and stands.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{ronnie?}
<A>__{rae inches closer to ronnie as he kneels over and weeps. she gently touches his shoulder. he turns his anguished face to her and tries to speak.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i can't stop... i can't stop... being scared. what am i gonna do...}
<A>__{ronnie hides his face in his hands. rae throws her arms around him and holds him tight.}
<C>__{rae}
<D>__{i got you, baby... i got you...}
<A>__{laz removes the clip and crosses to the kitchen. he slams the gun on the sink, opens a drawer and removes the wall phone.}
<C>__{rae}
<P>__{(seeing laz plug the phone in)}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<P>__{(laz dials a number)}
<D>__{you gonna call the cops? you think they gonna help this? they ever help you, laz? huh?}
