<L>__{interior fitts house ricky's bedroom moments later}
<A>__{ricky enters, followed by lester.}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{can you hold this for a sec?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{he gives the urine specimen to lester, then locks the door.}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{i don't think my dad would try to come in when somebody else is here, but you never know.}
<A>__{ricky crosses to a bureau and opens a drawer. he takes clothing out and piles it on his bed.}
<C>__{lester}
<P>__{(re: urine sample)}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{urine. i have to take a drug test every six months to make sure i'm clean.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{are you kidding? you just smoked with me last night.}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{it's not mine. one of my clients is a nurse in a pediatrician's office. i cut her a deal, she keeps me in clean piss.}
<A>__{lester picks up a cd case from a shelf and examines it.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{you like pink floyd?}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{i like a lot of music.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{man, i haven't listened to this album in years.}
<A>__{he shakes his head, then puts the cd case down. ricky, having emptied the drawer, now removes a false bottom, revealing rows of marijuana, tightly packed in zip loc bags.}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{how much do you want?}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{i don't know, it's been a while. how much is an ounce?}
<C>__{ricky}
<P>__{(indicates bag)}
<D>__{well, this is totally decent, and it's three hundred.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{wow.}
<C>__{ricky}
<P>__{(indicates another bag)}
<D>__{but this shit is top of the line. it's called g 13. genetically engineered by the u.s. government. extremely potent. but a completely mellow high, no paranoia.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{is that what we smoked last night?}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{this is all i ever smoke.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{how much?}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{two grand.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{jesus. things have changed since 1973.}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{you don't have to pay now. i know you're good for it.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{ricky}
<P>__{(hands him a bag)}
<D>__{there's a card in there with my beeper number, call me anytime day or night. and i only accept cash.}
<C>__{lester}
<P>__{(looks around room)}
<D>__{well, now i know how you can afford all this equipment. when i was your age, i flipped burgers all summer just to be able to buy an eight track.}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{that sucks.}
<C>__{lester}
<D>__{no actually, it was great. all i did was party and get laid.}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i had my whole life ahead of me...}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{my dad thinks i pay for all this with catering jobs.}
<P>__{(off lester's look)}
<D>__{never underestimate the power of denial.}
<A>__{lester smiles. this kid's cool.}
