<A>__{adam ignores him, convinced he can get out this way. a beat later, it dead ends in a chain link fence. zack points to his lips. he didn't say a word. adam slams it in reverse, backtracking. he's doing about 20 when suddenly we hear a loud thump! by instinct, he slams on the brakes. something crashes down on the soft roof.}
