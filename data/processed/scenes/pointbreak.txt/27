<L>__{exterior mulholland scenic turnout night}
<A>__{the diamond field of la glitters below. the small parking area off mulholland is filled with squad cars. red and blue disco. a flock of uniforms milling about a non descript chevy.}
<L>__{interior sedan front seat}
<A>__{flashlight beam prowls the interior, stopping on a small printed card, folded like a pup tent, left upon the bench seat. it reads "sanitized for your protection."}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{cute huh? they love to fuck with us.}
<A>__{utah & pappas pull their heads out of the sedan. forensic expert, halsey, stands behind them.}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{don't tell me, let me guess. the switch car was stolen this morning...}
<P>__{(halsey is nodding his head)}
<D>__{they vacuumed and 409'd the interior, did the windows, emptied the ashtrays...}
<C>__{halsey}
<D>__{yeah, the usual drill.}
<A>__{utah pulls on a rubber glove and lifts the card off the seat. studies it. talks to halsey like halsey's the one that just out of quantico, not utah.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{could've taken their gloves off before setting that card. laser it for prints. maybe held it to his teeth check the edges for saliva.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{today was a scorcher. this chevy doesn't have air conditioning...}
<C>__{halsey}
<D>__{sweat secretions in the seatbacks?}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{you through, mr. wizard? let me know if you find jimmy hoffa under the seat while you're at it.}
<P>__{(looks at his watch)}
<D>__{hell, it's only 7:30. the night's still young... you can solve this case and start on another one.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{well, what're your ideas on these guys?}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{forget about it, kid. they're ghosts. let the goddamn yuppie mormon affirmative action assholes handle it. see i'm almost 55... so i must be senile, right? they better get me out before i start pissing myself in public. drooling. it would look bad for the bureau, right?}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{so you're gonna coast to retirement, when you could nail these guys and go out with come dignity.}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{you watch your fucking mouth!}
<P>__{(pounds his chest)}
<D>__{mr. hoover himself pinned the seal of honor right here!}
<A>__{the two men glare at each other. utah looks away.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{yeah. that was thirty years ago anyway.}
<P>__{(stares out at the bright horizon)}
<D>__{l.a.'s changed a lot since then. the air got dirty and the sex got clean.}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{so you want to nail the ex presidents? be a big hero?}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{yeah. what's your theory?}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{the fucking punks are surfers.}
