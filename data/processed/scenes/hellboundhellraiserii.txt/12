<D>__{can we send it downtown?}
<A>__{ronson throws kirsty a look of exasperation with his colleague. the camera stays on kirsty's face as ronson speaks.}

<D>__{what the hell are you asking me for? tag it. move it.}
<C>__{kirsty }
<D>__{the mattress... the mattress... julia.}
<A>__{without waiting for a reply, ronson switches the radio off and clips it back to his belt.}
<L>__{interior bedroom 55 street night}
<A>__{we are looking at the mattress. kucich has left the room. cortez draws a pad from his packet. the pad is stapled, and the staple has been badly inserted and is not closed property. in the act of tearing a label from the pad, cortez catches his thumb on the staple.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{the label is adhesive backed. cortez licks it and presses it on the mattress. he writes on it 55l e1. as he stands up from doing this, a single drop of blood from his thumb lands on the mattress. (it is important that we see it is only a single drop and nothing like the amount larry spilled on the floorboards.) cortez leaves the room to fetch a colleague to help him move the mattress. we move in to see the drop of blood disappear very quickly into the mattress, as if it is being sucked in. as this happens, we hear on the soundtrack the faintest rumble.}
