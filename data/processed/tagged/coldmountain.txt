<L>__{exterior cold mountain town, north carolina. day}
<A>__{on a black screen: credits. a raucous voice (swimmers) chanting in the cherokee language. a range of mountains slowly emerges: shrouded in a blue mist like a chinese water color. below them, close to a small town, young men, armed with vicious sticks and stripped to the waist, come charging in a muscular, steaming pack. their opponents, also swinging sticks, attach the pack. a ball, barely round, made of leather, emerges, smacked forwards by inman, who hurtles after it and collides with a stick swung by swimmer, a young and lithe american indian. inman falls, clutching his nose. the ball bobbles on the ground in front of him. he grabs it and gets to his feet, the blood pouring from his nose. his team form a phalanx around him and he continues to charge. a pristine cabriolet pulled by an impressive horse, comes down towards the town. it has to pass across the temporary field of play, parting the teams. some of the contestants grab their shirts to restore propriety as the cabriolet and its two exotic passengers passes by. the driver is a man in his early fifties, dressed in the severe garb of a minister, monroe. and next to him, a self conscious girl in the spotless elaborate, architectural skirts of the period, is his daughter, ada. inman, using his shirt to staunch his battered nose, looks at ada, astonished by her. an angel in this wild place. now swimmer stops chanting and begins, more hesitantly, to translate into english:}
<C>__{swimmers voice }
<D>__{you will be lonely. you will howl like a dog as you walk alone. you will carry dog shit cupped in your hands. you will be smeared with dog shit. your spirit will wane and dwindle to blue, the colour of despair...}
<A>__{as the cabriolet passes, swimmer takes the ball an with a whoop starts to run towards the opposing goal. the game resumes. ada looks back as the men swarm into each other, sticks and fists flailing.}
<L>__{exterior cold mountain town. night}
<A>__{a side of beef turns on a huge barbecue. the battered teams eating, drinking hard liquor, rehearsing victory and defeat, illuminated by a roaring bonfire. swimmer is sewing up a gash in inmans cheek as he continues to translate:}
<C>__{swimmer}
<D>__{...this is your path. there is no other. that's a curse you can use on the yankee before battle.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{and that works?}
<C>__{swimmer}
<D>__{you have to say it in cherokee.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{you said it to me in cherokee.}
<A>__{during this, monroe and ada have arrived, escorted by sally swanger, a local woman, middle aged, kindly, and her husband, esco, a glorious curmudgeon. the monroes are introduced to various locals. inamn watches them, on the other side of the crowd. the reverend monroe, his daughter ada. up from charleston, bringing god's word to you heathens! is esco's preferred introduction. building a church. inman watches ada, moves his head to keep her in view as swimmer stitches, and winces with pain.}
<C>__{swimmer}
<D>__{so keep your head still.}
<A>__{sally collects plates for the monroes. hands them to ada and her father, who wait, patiently, for silverware. esco takes a plate, picks up a skewer of meat, bites on it. monroe pluckily follows suit.}

<A>__{a stand of trees. the pastoral lush green virginia. a rabbit surfaces from its hole. peace and beauty. a second rabbit shakes itself from the ground, darts into open ground to confront the forbidding trenches of the confederate and union armies, ranged against each other on the outskirts of petersburg. massive wooden barricades in the shape of crosses, rows of x's, define the two lines. the federals have been laying siege for months. so early and it's already hot. the trees are an oasis of green in a world of mud between the two stark and ugly scars of the trenches. in the confederate lines, the men are rousing, boiling water for coffee or to shave, smoking, stiff from night. there's a large gun emplacement and some men still sleep against the stub nosed cannon. another rabbit is disturbed from its hole. ears pricked up to a distant rumbling.}

<A>__{pandemonium. the confederates are in complete disarray. the federals pour forwards across no mans land, through the peaceful oasis of trees, roaring the roar of attack. they flood towards the crater, hundreds of them, charging into a dense and impenetrable wall of smoke. then they're inside the great gash of crater and can't get out again, arriving at an insurmountable wall of mud. the confederates regroup. orders are yelled. chaos developing into battle. the confederates begin firing into the crater. guns and mortar wheel round and empty into what is becoming a terrible death trap. inman gets to his feet. oakley with him, and rushes through the smoke to the pit, emptying his lemats into the crater. later: a black regiment from the union join the attack. bodies falling on bodies as the federals charge in and pack their comrades even tighter. the confederates make a pincer movement outside the crater, forcing all the federals in. it's medieval. no escape. the confederates jump into the pit to engage the federals. hand to hand fighting. too close for rifles, just bayonets, and guns swung like clubs and inman sliding down into that hell, tiring the nine rounds, then the shotgun charge, which does a terrible damage. primitive. unutterable carnage. men killing each other in embraces, soldier crushed against soldier, desperate to survive, to kill, to live. an oozing layer cake of bodies, dead and frantically alive, drowning in slick. young oakley loses his rifle and picks up a magazine case, clubbing his opponent, then slips onto him and is stuck with a bayonet, the pain of which makes him squeal. inman goes at it. he's a warrior, punching and stabbing and firing. a coldly efficient killer. he's grabbed from behind and crushed, a hand gouging at his face, an almighty struggle. he falls and lands on top of oakley, and he and his federal opponent fight to the death with the wounded boy as their pillow. the slaughter continues over and around them, the sound, the sound of hell and madness. the boy has his arm around inman, like lovers. later: the confederates run after the retreating union soldiers, firing, cavalry riding them down. inman stands, the boy's blood all over him, exhausted and appalled. the crater, behind him, an abattoir of men. the victors are yelling, pumped mad with adrenaline. butcher comes alongside inman.}

<A>__{a wounded black soldier sits up as butcher celebrates. butcher runs over, but can't find a charge for his musket. he looks around in the stack of corpses, pulling out weapons, tries one: not loaded, throws it down, tries another: not loaded. the wounded man can't get up, tries to drag himself like a crab away from butcher. inman yells at him, appalled.}

<A>__{inman turns away, sees another rebel, extravagantly costumed, a strange fiddle head protruding from his knapsack. this is stobrod thewes. he's bent over a dead federal, examining his mouth. he reaches behind his back and roots around in the knapsack, producing a pair of pliers, which he inserts into the corpse's mouth. he's yanking away when a swinging boot connects with his head and knocks him to the ground. startled, he looks up to see inman hovering over him.}

<D>__{i'm reaching cold mountain before you.}

<A>__{a dozen men in the tent. inman has a book, its cover gone, rolled up and tied with a leather strap. his bookmark is a faded tintype photograph of a solemn young woman. he unwraps the book carefully and reads a page by the sickly light next to his bedroll. an officer comes into the tent, approaches inman, who makes a stand.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{don't get up, soldier. you are mentioned tonight in my report. you are a credit to the highlands, to north carolina and to the cause.}

<C>__{inman}
<D>__{sir. it was my understanding the medical corps was desperate for volunteers.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{right now, soldier, it's me who is in need of volunteers. there's a dozen yankees in that stand of trees between us. stuck there from the retreat. come daylight they can shoot us down for sport.}
<L>__{exterior confederate lines. night}
<A>__{a beautiful night. lots of stars. inman and three others, including butcher, slide over the top of the trench, far to one side of the stand of trees. the plan is to cast a wide arc that will bring them around back of the trees, closer to the enemy side than their own. the four men slither over the ground. they pause. inman has arrived at a tangle of corpses. he slithers over them. they work their way towards the trees. there are a half dozen federals crouching in the cover of the trees. they are dozing. only one of them sits with a rifle surveying the confederate lines, the others have their backs to the enemy, sitting against the trunks, grabbing a few minute's sleep. as the four rebels approach, still crawling, one of the federals opens his eyes, sees the attack, shifts for his rifle. inman immediately stands up, firing instantly, killing him and two others, while butcher throws himself at another. the exchanges are brief and savage and one of inman's party and all of the federals lay dead. then the rebels break from the trees. a flare goes up, then another, both from the confederate trenches. inman and his accomplices are picked out in a brilliant green light. shots follow, from both sides, aimed at the three returning men as they zigzag towards their own lines. as they get close, voices cry out, rippling down the trench, joining their own admonitions: don't shoot, hold your fire, they're our boys, hold your fire!!! they're almost home. butcher is laughing, whooping. then just as suddenly he falls, wounded. inman stops, turns back, runs to him. inman collects butcher, drags him, carries him. they're fifty yards from their lines. a bullet catches inman in the neck. he goes down like a tree, blood pouring from his neck. lying on the ground, he watches the phosphorescent lights slowly fade to black, all sound fading with them.}
<L>__{exterior chapel, cold mountain town. 3 years earlier. day}
<A>__{a wooden joist swings across the view of the blue ridge. men are swarming over the roof of an unfinished chapel, below which appears the small town of cold mountain. among the workers, armed with nails and hammer, knees clutching a rafter, is inman, fresh and a whole lifetime younger. rourke and butcher are also there hammering, building, kidding around and oakley, barely a teenager. below them, women are setting up a lunch for the workers, ada amongst them. she has the circumspect air of the blue stocking, uncomfortably aware of the dirt beneath her hem, the men's radar for her every move. inman watches her as sally swanger approaches.}

<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{in fact, if you're going to wimble all night i'm going to sleep in with him.}

<D>__{right.}

<D>__{more a question could she put up with me.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{and you understand she's my friend, she's not a hired hand and she doesn't empty a night jar unless it's her own.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{this war's made some things pointless. it's hard to imagine a wedding. i think even my father would recognize that.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{ada, i want to marry you. if you'll have me.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{isn't there's some religion where you just have to say i marry you, three times, and then you're man and wife.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{i marry you. i marry you. i marry you.}
<A>__{ada laughs, unsettling inman.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{why's that funny?}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{no, i think it's i divorce you three times and then you're not married anymore.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{i can wait for you.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{you waited enough. i certainly did. i marry you. i marry you. i marry you.}

<D>__{you go ahead. i will follow with the horse at a pace your daddy can tolerate.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{we can all go together.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{it's safer this way. no one has quarrel with you.}

<D>__{he's right.}
<C>__{inman}
<P>__{(to ruby)}
<D>__{i gather i need permission if i reckon on living at black cove.}

<D>__{we'll get to you by nightfall.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{you be safe.}
<A>__{she puts her hand to his mouth which creases into a smile.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{your mr. bartram speaks about some category of fly born on the hide of a cow. it flies up into a tree and waits and waits until it smells cow. it can wait a year, two years, i don't know, maybe longer. then a cow comes along and it wakes up, flies down, lays its eggs on the cow. there's purpose for you.}

<D>__{and am i the fly in this story, or the cow?}

<D>__{he's sweet on you, that georgia boy.}
<A>__{he coughs for a long time.}

<D>__{if you say a thing and then cough it's a lie. daddy, stay on that horse, and don't lose him or sell him. we'll need him on the farm.}

<A>__{inman has roped stobrod to the horse which he pulls down a steep slope. behind him, their hooves muffled by the snow, a group of riders join the trail, in slow but steady pursuit. inman walks on, apparently oblivious to who's behind him. he and stobrod are some distance from broken ground, a fringe of trees.}
<C>__{inman}
<P>__{(quietly to stobrod)}
<D>__{don't look round.}
<C>__{stobrod}
<D>__{got it.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{how many men does he have?}
<C>__{stobrod}
<D>__{there were five. you can't reason with that man.}
<C>__{inman}
<P>__{(takes off his gloves)}
<D>__{i got a conversation stopper.}
<P>__{(they're getting closer)}
<D>__{closer we get to that broken ground the better.}
<A>__{inman opens his coat. stobrod looks at the lemats. they're at the edge of the trees.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{you hold on tight, do you hear? when i say three, look round, nice and slow.}
<C>__{stobrod}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{one, two, three.}
<A>__{stobrod looks round. inman doesn't. teague has some new bodies in his entourage but they're all dead. a spare horse has three corpses hung over it, another horse drags a makeshift litter with a couple more, souvenirs of their cave visit. teague waves.}
<C>__{teague}
<D>__{god damn! you're a hard fucker to put down.}
<P>__{(they approach)}
<D>__{good directions to that cave from the fat boy saw the squirrels, sat on the tree made some friends, brought some back with me.}
<A>__{his riders begin, quite casually, to fan out. in one movement, inman slaps the flank of the horse. which careers down the track, then turns and fires, twice, before}
<B>__{pitching himself into a roll towards the trees. his first}
<A>__{shot knocks jo from his horse, the second mo, who falls into the snow, bleeding from the groin and screaming. the riderless horse gets tangled up with the others. inman is in the trees, shots around him. he doesn't move away from, but towards the riders inside the line of trees. grayling charges him, riding into the trees. inman shoots him, then rushes from the trees, firing, missing bosie, who rides away, evidently not relishing the fight, and throws himself at teague, whose horse is bucking wildly. teague's carbine fires an involuntary shot into the air. inman yanks the gun from his hand with his own left hand and lets go the shotgun barrel of the lemats with the other, the big pistol almost leaping from his hand with the recoil. teague's chest opens out as he's thrown off the horse. mo is still screaming. inman walks over and shoots him in the head, then walks to teague, who is saying something, the blood blotting the snow under him. inman studies him, picks up the spencer carbine, turns to look where bosie has gone, steps up onto teague's horse, reins the horse in, and trots it over to the prostrate teague, leans over and shoots him dead. he turns the horse in the direction bosie had headed. he can't see horse or rider, but in the stand of hickory trees ahead, the gusts of steaming breath betray them both. he rides slowly towards the stand of trees.}
<L>__{exterior cold mountain. day}
<A>__{ada and ruby walking. they hear the shots. ada turns and starts to run through the snow, her hat flying from her head.}
<L>__{exterior stand of hickory trees, cold mountain. day}
<A>__{inman's horse is parallel to bosie, who is deep inside the trees but also riding, slowly. it's like a dance.}

<C>__{bosie}
<D>__{no, sir. here's fine.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{i just have to shoot the horse from under you.}

<D>__{shoot her. she's not mine. you riding mr teague's mare?}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{i am.}
<C>__{bosie}
<D>__{he dead?}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{i hope so.}
<P>__{(wearily, as he brings}

<D>__{look, how old are you? give me your gun and ride home, i'm done fighting. i'm sick of it.}
<C>__{bosie}
<D>__{i give you my gun you'll shoot me dead.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{i will not shoot you, but nor am i walking down that mountain looking over my shoulder for you.}
<C>__{bosie}
<D>__{that's what they call a conundrum. i tell you what i've got on my side.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{what have you got on your side?}
<C>__{bosie}
<D>__{the confidence of youth.}
<A>__{and in that second he produces his gun and fires. inman has already fired the lemats and the boy, shot in the head, falls. caught by one stirrup the horse bolting. inman watches, stock still, then makes a cough, as if clearing his throat, and a}

<L>__{exterior ridge, cold mountain. day}
<A>__{ada and ruby running. they reach stobrod, his horse stopped, drinking from the creek. stobrod, barely conscious, hanging halfway down its flank, held on by the ropes. ada hurries on, taking the shotgun from ruby, who tends to her father.}
<L>__{exterior a grove of trees, cold mountain. day}
<A>__{ada runs past the horse dragging the cave corpses. she hardly stops to look at the bodies, just rushes on. the ground simplifies and she's at the bottom of a grove. a steep incline, the sun low and in front of her. she sees a brilliant frame of black trees, and then a sudden flurry of}
<B>__{angry crows flying towards her. at the top of the hill is a small hieroglyph of a man.}
<A>__{finally, the image from the swanger well exactly as she first}
<B>__{saw it.}
<A>__{the figure raises a hand, briefly, then pitches forward into}
<B>__{the snow.}
<A>__{she runs, her heart broken, towards the body of inman. he's dead, the red flag of his life ebbed, away in the snow. ada falls to her knees and pulls him over, the snow crusted on his face, which she wipes away with great tenderness, then sits, his head in her lap, as ruby slowly comes up the hill towards them. a violin plays, quite raucous.}
<L>__{interior kitchen, black cove farm, easter. day}
<A>__{a girl, about five or six, with ada's curls, sits at the table cradling a tiny lamb, which won't feed from the nippled bottle she offers it. she tries again. ada comes in suddenly, takes a knife from the kitchen, and hurries out.}

<D>__{you bring that lamb outside.}
<A>__{the girl gets up, carries the lamb out into the field.}
<L>__{exterior field, black cove farm. day}
<A>__{the sound of the fiddle continuing, joined by a banjo, it's a glorious spring morning, black cove farm at its most luxuriant, the path edged with brilliant flowers. there are more animals in evidence. the girl emerges from the house and sees ada in the field, surrounded by sheep. she hurries over. ada is expertly skinning a stillborn lamb. the little girl is horrified.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{what are you doing!}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{he came out dead, love.}
<A>__{she has the skin off the lamb, which lies like a little pink cat on the ground. she approaches grace, takes the live lamb from her arms, the girl resistant, frightened.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{don't kill him!}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{i'm not going to kill him. but we have to try something or else he's going to die.}
<A>__{she takes the skin and wraps it round grace's lamb. then puts the covered lamb into the pen with the dead lamb's mother. it goes to the sheep and, after a few false starts, starts to feed, accepted as a surrogate.}
<C>__{ada}
<D>__{isn't that a small mercy.}
<A>__{and a voice joins in with the fiddle and banjo.}
<L>__{exterior black cove farm. day}
<A>__{stobrod is playing, on his repaired fiddle. his hair is now completely grey. georgia is playing the banjo and singing, although. a small child with georgia's reddish coloring keeps invading his picking hand trying to join in. ruby has another georgia child in her arms, but is also trying to serve food. she passes georgia and touches the top of his head. sally swanger is pouring water from a jug, ada emerges from the kitchen, with a big pie, racing to the table.}
<C>__{ada}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{hot hot hot hot hot!!!}
<A>__{from behind her, grace appears, carrying a jug of milk, puts it on the groaning board of the table. grace has a full plate in front of her, picks up a fork to spear some meat.}
