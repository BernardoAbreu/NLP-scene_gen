<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{barnyard day outside the castle wall hodge is feeding the chickens and ducks. he straightens up and squints through the early morning mists. on a distant hillock two figures are moving toward the woods.}
<B>__{ulrich and galen}
<A>__{hobbling slowly with the aid of a pair of canes, ulrich guides his pupil across a wooden bridge and along a stream into the forest.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<P>__{(stern and troubled)}
<D>__{this wood, these leaves, the birds, the very dome of heaven, once they all rang with one great chord: and philosophers like me kept it all in tune. now, new voices are singing new songs.}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{have you mastered the threefold transmutation?}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<P>__{(skeptical)}
<D>__{you have?}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{well, almost.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{it's very difficult. have you committed to memory undying the codex de profundis?}
<C>__{galen}
<P>__{(a shrug)}
<D>__{the first two chapters.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{it's long. and what about the ritual of banishment as prescribed by my late master balisarius?}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{to tell the truth, i haven't dared try it. what's the point, anyway?}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{the point? the point is you don't know it, and you're no magician without it. it was my hope to school you, to mold your faculties and wits... i still believe you have some talent. somewhere.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{i hate books. i hate drill. i want a real task.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{there's no time now. when i'm gone, half the powers in the universe will vanish with me. and what's the use of a few lingering skills if they're left in the hands of a child?}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{listen!}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{i don't hear anything.}
<A>__{ulrich gauges the young man standing before him and makes a decision. reaching under his cloak he lifts off a fine silver chain with an amulet dangling from it. he drapes it around galen's neck.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<D>__{here, wear this.}
<A>__{galen instinctively wraps his hand around the jewel. he cocks an ear.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{voices, singing on the road.}
<A>__{he hastens forward to a promontory, eager to have a look. ulrich does not follow. instead, doffing his cloak, he whirls it before him, where it magically floats a few feet off the ground. awkwardly, the old man clambers aboard.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{i don't see anything.}
<A>__{he turns back, but the wizard is gone. a shadow falls over him. he looks up. there, two hundred feet above the tree tops his master is soaring on the wind.}
<B>__{airborne}
<A>__{the old conjurer squints into the distance. miles away and far below a company of drab walkers winds along the margins of the forest. they are singing a mournful round.}
<B>__{galen}
<A>__{he gawks skyward. suddenly, the old man leans down and addresses him.}
<C>__{ulrich}
<P>__{(a shout)}
<D>__{we have visitors!}
