<L>__{exterior car rental agency night}
<P>__{duke (v o)}
<D>__{we had trouble, again, at the car rental agency.}
<A>__{behind the wheel of the red shark: duke grins with satisfaction checking it out. a nervous agent holds out a clipboard. duke signs without looking at the rental papers.}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{say... uh... you fellas are going to be careful with this car, aren't you?}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{duke throws the car into reverse roars backwards past the gas pumps to where gonzo is unloading their rusted out car.}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{well, good god! you just backed over that two foot concrete abutment and you didn't even slow down! forty five in reverse! and you barely missed the pump!}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{no harm done. i always test the transmission that way. the rear end. for stress factors.}
<A>__{gonzo transfers boxes of new sound equipment and a large box of rum and ice into the red shark.}
<C>__{agent}
<D>__{say. are you fellows drinking?}
<C>__{duke}
<D>__{not me. we're responsible people.}
<A>__{he jams the car into low gear and lurches into traffic. the agent runs into the street and helplessly watches them go.}
<C>__{gonzo}
<D>__{there's another worrier. he's probably all cranked up on speed.}
