<L>__{exterior forest day}
<A>__{bobby is a few steps ahead of hector. he dips down over a rise, and instantly returns. he throws himself and hector to the ground. hector tries to struggle free.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{quiet. they're on the other side...}
<A>__{hector ducks lower, hugging the ground. bobby is already sliding up the slope to look over the rise. hector follows him. on the other side, they see the women and children of a small group of indians at the edge of a stream. the women are washing clothes, the children are splashing and playing. we are close enough to hear their laughter.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{we're right in the middle of them...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{does it have to be bad? they might be friendly...}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{they were chased here... they should be on the coast growing corn...}
<A>__{bobby turns to hector to make his pointerior that is when he sees the first of the figures, just the ghost of a shadow moving from tree to rock. his eyes flick across the forest behind them. he sees another figure caught in the act of seeking cover, looking absurdly embarrassed for the fleeting moment that we see it. then bobby sees another. are they teasing them? it looks so much like a game children would play.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{oh oh...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{they're behind us. they must think we're stalking the women...}
<A>__{hector looks and sees nothing. fifty indians hold their breath. the forest seems empty. but hector looks at bobby. he is grey faced, a man who is looking at death. hector knows they are doomed.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{do you want to run?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i will do what you do.}
<A>__{they leap to their feet and run. there is only one way to go, over the rise, through the women and children and across the stream. to the watching indians it looks like a direct attack on their families. from behind trees and rocks they emerge and begin the chase. a tragedy of misunderstanding. hector and bobby scatter the women and children and splash across the stream, burning all their energy in this mad life or death race. although their families are safe, the indians keep up the chase, the moment of confusion compounded in action. they lope easily after them, waiting for the white men to tire. there are no whoops or shouts. they follow hector and bobby into the trees, spreading out on either side, shaping the human net that will soon engulf them. it is a menacing spectacle. death is near. hector and bobby stay close together as they run.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{when they catch up... fight... it'll be quicker... fight like hell...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{they're not going to catch us. we're going home.}
<A>__{hector stretches out an arm to bobby.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{hold my hand, bobby...}
<A>__{they hold hands and run.}
