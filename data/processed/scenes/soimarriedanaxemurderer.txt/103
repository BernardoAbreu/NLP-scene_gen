<B>__{lights are out.}
<A>__{in the dimmest of lights provided from the cloud covered moon outside, charlie runs across the dance floor, fighting for an exit to the outside. he arrives in someone's arms on his way.}

<D>__{i need your help! you have to help me! i've married a...!}
<A>__{the lights go back on and charlie is in harriet's arms again. her face is near menacing now. she smiles a very disturbed grin. he doesn't know what to say.}

<P>__{(much too pleasant)}
<D>__{hello, charlie.}
<A>__{charlie and her are squared off. neither speak. suddenly both of them are lifted into the air. they look down and see the waiters and busboys picking them up onto chairs, throwing them up in the air again and again. the music plays along loudly. harriet watches charlie very closely, as charlie looks scared. then, the people start to carry them out of the room and down the hallway.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{let's take 'em to their room.}
