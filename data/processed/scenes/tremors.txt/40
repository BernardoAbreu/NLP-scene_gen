<L>__{exterior jim and megans's house establish night}
<A>__{in the vast desert night a single floodlight illuminates jim and megan's partially finished house. their station wagon is parked out front. a country and western tune drifts to us from it's radio. as we move closer, we see the floodlight is powered by a small, softly purring generator set maybe fifty feet away. jim and megan, both exhausted, unload a big stack of roofing shingles from their station wagon. jim starts to lift a package of shingles but gives up and sits on the tailgate.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i'm dead. let's finish in the morning.}
<C>__{megan}
<D>__{we have to go into bixby in the morning.}
<P>__{(grins devilishly)}
<D>__{the concrete blocks are in.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{the con...! oh my god.}
<C>__{megan}
<D>__{just keep looking at that beautiful sky.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{megan}
<D>__{that's the sky that's going to be over our roof every night, when we're done.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(joking)}
<D>__{ah, but consider this, if we don't finish the roof, we can looks at that sky all the time.}
<A>__{just then the whirring of the generator becomes strangely muffled. the floodlight flickers. now the generator dies. darkness engulfs them. the car radio music drones on incongruously.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{damn that thing!}
<C>__{megan}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{we could always buy a new generator.}
<A>__{jim digs out a powerful flashlight and heads over toward the generator. megan lies back, taking a welcome breather. after a moment:}
<C>__{megan}
<D>__{well, what's wrong with it?}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{it's...gone...!}
<A>__{angle jim baffled, he sweeps the whole area with the flashlight. megan joins him.}
<C>__{megan}
<D>__{you sure this is where it was?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{am i sure?!}
<P>__{(points with flashlight)}
<D>__{it was right there. there's the cord.}
<A>__{the severed electric cable stops at the edge of a cone shaped depression in the dirt where the generator sat. he hands her the flashlight and kneels. we watch tensely as he probes the loose earth with his hands.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{maybe the ground caved in. there's a lot of old mines and stuff around here.}
<A>__{megan grabs his shirt, trying to pull him back.}
<C>__{megan}
<D>__{well don't then! you don't want to fall in.}
<A>__{suddenly, about ten feet away whoomp!! the generator shoots up out of the ground! jim and megan dive for cover as it sails through the air, and crashes to earth. they stare, transfixed. the generator is dented and bent almost beyond recognition and covered with oozing slime.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what the...?}
<A>__{but megan is all action. she yanks him back.}
<C>__{megan}
<D>__{come on. get away from it!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{god, what a stink!}
<A>__{we again hear that mysterious rumbling sound. jim stops, sweeping the flashlight around them.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{hear that?}
<C>__{megan}
<D>__{never mind ! let's go! let's just go into town or something! jim, please !}
<A>__{she hustles him bodily toward the car during:}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you know, i bet it's geological or something, like natural gas, or a geyser. they stink like that. remember in yellowstone...?}
<A>__{suddenly he drops knee deep into ground! megan is thrown off balance and tumbles to one side. the flashlight falls, lighting them at an eerie low angle.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{something's got me!!}
<A>__{we hear sickening crunches from below the earth. he screams in excruciating agony.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{oh, god! get me out!! get me out!!}
<A>__{he struggles wildly, but just sinks further down! megan slides a 2x4 over to jim. he grabs it like a drowning man, trying to keep himself from being pulled down. but he's pulled with suck power the 2x4 snaps! his head is going under. megan desperately tries to dig the smothering earth away, but she's losing. now only his arms are above ground. she pulls with all her might, but he sinks inexorably down, down. she's pulled flat on the ground. he's gone. the next instant, a vicious hook tentacle erupts through the earth, missing megan's face by inches. she scrambles back frantically. angle station wagon low camera pursues megan toward the car, just missing her as she dives in through the open tailgate. she slams it after her. the talons rake across the car, scratching the glass. megan tumbles into the front seat. thank god the keys are in the ignition. she starts the engine. but outside the "snake things" attack the car in a frenzy, slashing blindly. a rear tire is totally shredded just as: megan floors it. the car lurches forward but the mutilated tire falls apart. the wheel rim digs into the loose earth and the car is stuck. with no other recourse, megan locks the door, rolls up the windows and cowers in the middle of the car, panting, sobbing. the radio is still playing a happy cowboy tune. she peeks out. they gave up? she's safe? nothing happens for a moment, then the car starts to shake and shudder! dust wells up around the windows. outside we see a bizarre sight. the earth around the rear of the car is "boiling," dirt flying in all directions and the car starts to sink into the ground !! megan wildly honks the horn! the car looks just like a ship going down by the stern, hood tilting up gracefully. the back windows shatter, dirt pouring in! megan smashes the windshield with a small fire extinguisher and scrambles out on the hood. but there's no hope. the car keeps sinking, titling now almost ninety degrees, forcing her onto a precarious perch on the grille sinking, sinking. out of her mind with terror, she keeps softly murmuring the same hopeless phrases:}
<C>__{megan}
<D>__{stop it! stop it! somebody stop it...!}
