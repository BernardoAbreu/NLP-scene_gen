<L>__{interior apartment building hallway day}
<A>__{an upper floor. grace, reynaud and the manager cross to a door. the manager studies costa's sketch of the attacker.}
<C>__{super}
<D>__{i never met him. we conducted our business by phone.}
<A>__{they arrive at a door. reynaud about to knock. grace stops him, listening at the door.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i smell smoke. back where i'm from anyone can kick a door if there's a fire. it's the 'citizen's arrest' of search warrants.}
<A>__{then: the smoke alarm inside the apartment buzzes o.s. reynaud and laval trade looks. reynaud cocks a leg... the manager unlocks the door a beat before reynaud kicks it. laval is no danger junkie, he's a little hesitant to enter. grace gets down low, enters carefully, she knows what she's doing.}
