<A>__{jackie and luke sit across from each other in the lovely restaurant. jackie looks beautiful in the warm candlelight.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{...maybe you don't think three years is enough for a person to change but...things are different now jackie. i'm different.}
<A>__{jackie feels her heart beginning to race. they lock eyes for a moment. he unconsciously begins to eat off her plate. he eats her chicken, and in the dance they've done a thousand times she reaches for his uneaten vegetables. the waiter approaches.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{would you and your wife prefer still or sparkling water?}
<A>__{he doesn't correct the waiter.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{still, please.}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(when the waiter leaves)}
<D>__{annabelle showed me the new dress. she's amazing in it.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{getting so beautiful...she looks more like you every day.}
<P>__{(luke downs jackie's wine)}
<D>__{jackie...i've really given this a lot of thought. a great deal of thought...}
<A>__{their eyes lock for a moment. here it comes...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i'm gonna marry rachel. i know you don't think much of her but she's a special person she really is. and i love her. this is a bridge we never wanted to cross but it's not helping her or the kids if i don't really commit to that.}
<A>__{jackie stares at him stonefaced.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i didn't think a phone call was appropriate...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{tell me exactly how you're different from three years ago? the music sounds kind of the same from where i'm sitting.}
<A>__{he shifts in his chair. wants this to sound as authentic as he feels it...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{i grew up, a little. i'm ready for a life that's built around commitm...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{just not to me.}
<A>__{the waiter returns with a bottle of red wine. it's horribly quiet as he pours. waits, obtrusively.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{thank you, it's fine...}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{would you like to taste it?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{can we please have less service, here?}
<A>__{the waiter leaves, taking his attitude with him. luke sighs...}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{it's going to be hard for the kids when i tell them...i'd like you to be there.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{to make it easier for them or you?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{it's a huge moment in their life }
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you can't be an 'us' just when you want to. you can't play that card when it's convenient.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{we...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{we are over.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{we're still their parents for the next hundred years.}
<A>__{on this, jackie looks down at her hands.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{you're still going to have to be dealing with me with us. we should tell them together.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{no. you think this is going to help the kids then you do it. you're on your own.}
