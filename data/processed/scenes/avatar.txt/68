<L>__{exterior rainforest night}
<A>__{long lens polyphemus. the giant planet rises behind the black trees. jake's got a new problem. he sees shapes moving with liquid grace in the night shadows behind him. he is being stalked by a pack of viperwolves. jake catches only glimpses a glint of eyes, a slinking black movement then nothing. darkness.}
<T>__{time cut :}
<A>__{ tight on jake's hands as he knots his t shirt around the butt end of the spear. angle on thick sap trickling down a tree trunk. jake jams the makeshift torch into the sap, soaking the shirt with it. a waterproof match from his survival kit lights the torch. the torch creates a pool of light surrounded by pulsing, leaping shadows. jake turns warily as he moves along the trail. behind him are several pairs of reflective green eyes. another pair flanking him beside the trail. black on black shapes which seem to flow like liquid. he looks up sees one cross a limb overhead. another on his opposite flank. then a hideous sound, like a hyena's psychotic laugh. the viperwolves can run like a dog and climb like a monkey. they are hunting jake from the ground and the trees. jake runs by torch light, on the edge of panic. he reaches a steep banked stream and without thinking runs across it on a horizontal trunk and stops dead on the other side. the torch illuminates green eyes cutting ahead of him across the trail. the viperwolves have him encircled. the psychotic barks become more intense as they signal each other, getting excited. one makes a run at him, angling on his legs from behind but jake whirls, jamming the torch in its face. it yips and goes past, but another moves in he jabs it with the business end of the spear and it snarls, retreating, baring its fangs. now half a dozen are circling him in the open, and he sees what he's up against. the viperwolves are six limbed with shiny chitinous skin, their paws leathery black hands. intelligent eyes. glistening black teeth in dead white gums. jake realizes that he is making his final stand. he whirls the torch in an arc, keeping them at bay and feels a rush of adrenaline. it goes through him like a lightning bolt and the fear is gone.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{i don't have all goddamn night! come on! come on!}
<A>__{with snarls and a blur of motion they attack. jake cracks the spear down on one, then spins as another leaps at him and he plants the spear in it, striking true, but its momentum wrenches it from his hands, and the torch goes flying. left in semi darkness, jake draws his knife as a wolf lunges, sinking its teeth into his arm. he yells in pain and fury, slashing with the knife which cuts deep into the beast's shoulder and it lets go. jake sprints, trying to escape, but a snarling viperwolf leaps, grabbing him by the ankle with its fore hand. jake tears away, sprawling, scrambling to get up as three wolves charge at once. the nearest leaps at his throat just as thunk!! an arrow appears in its chest. the wolf lands on him, already a dead weight. he pushes it off in time to see a blue amazon emerge from the trees, nock another arrow, draw and fire in one fluid motion. an unearthly yowl as another wolf falls. neytiri leaps right over jake, and cracks her bow down on the skull of a circling wolf. another springs at her and she drops under its weight, but rolls, coming up on top of it with a knife in her hand. her knife flashes down, buried to the hilt in its chest. snarling, a wounded wolf attacks jake, and he kicks it away, but it spins and leaps back onto him, and jake barely catches its throat in time to keep the snapping jaws away from his face. meanwhile neytiri swings her bow in a big arc, cracking it across the heads and shoulders of two remaining wolves.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{rrreeyaaah! hyaaaah!!}
<A>__{the wolves slink and circle, yelping as the bow whistles past them. finally they break and run, with neytiri chasing and they bound away through the foliage as she shouts after them }
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{raaaarrrr!}
<A>__{jake has his adversary pinned and is choking it with all his weight. finally it stops thrashing. panting, he releases it and looks up at neytiri. her tail lashes as she scans the forest, listening to the fading yelps of the wolves. satisfied the attack is over, she turns. she regards him coldly for a second, then walks past him. neytiri picks up the torch and extinguishes it in a stream.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{wait, don't }
<A>__{jake blinks around at the darkness realizing he can still see. in fact, with the blinding torchlight gone, the forest is transformed. the jungle has come alive with bioluminescence spots and patterns, ghosts and galaxies of blue green light. jake scrambles to recover his spear. neytiri kneels beside a dying wolf. it's cries are pitiful. it paws the air, trying to raise its head. she pulls her knife from its chest.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<P>__{(in na'vi)}
<D>__{forgive me, my brother.}
<A>__{she cuts its throat, ending the pitiful cries. she touches its head gently, regarding it with sadness. neytiri wipes the knife and returns it to the sheath at her waist. she crosses to another slain wolf and kneels, pulling the arrow from its heart.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{look, um, i know you probably don't understand this. but thanks. thank you. i owe you.}
<A>__{neytiri ignores him, assuming a prayer posture over the dead animal.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<P>__{(in na'vi)}
<D>__{forgive me. may your spirit run with the great mother.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{i would have been screwed if you hadn't come along }
<A>__{she rises and walks away without looking at jake.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{hey, wait. wait! where you goin'?}
<A>__{he crashes through some plants, catching up to her.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{slow down a second will you. i just want to thank you for killing those }
<A>__{he makes the mistake of grasping her shoulder and whack! she wallops him upside the head with her bow in a fierce backhand swing, laying him out flat. he looks up to see a fury standing over him. a fury who speaks english accented, halting, angry english.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{don't thank! you don't thank for this! this is sad. very sad, only.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{okay, i'm sorry. whatever i did i'm sorry.}
<A>__{she gestures at the bodies of the viperwolves.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{all this is your fault! they did not need to die.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{they attacked me. how'm i the bad guy here }
<A>__{she silences him with the tip of her bow at his throat.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{your fault! you are like a baby, making noise, don't know what to do. you should not come here, all of you! you only come and make problems. only.}
<A>__{jake gets up, slowly, facing her.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{okay, fine, you love your little forest friends. so why not just let them kill my ass? what's the thinking?}
<A>__{cu neytiri looking away. finally, reluctantly, her eyes meet his for the first time a riveting gaze with those big gold orbs.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{why save you?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{yes, why save me?}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{you have a strong heart. no fear.}
<A>__{she leans closer }
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{but stupid! ignorant like a child!}
<A>__{she turns away, stalking off, but jake goes after her. tracking with neytiri as she climbs nimbly along a huge root. wider as she trots with perfect balance along the root, which forms an elevated walkway. jake runs to catch up, realizing suddenly that he is far above the forest floor. throughout the following they move through a glowing phantasmagorical forest.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{if i'm so ignorant, maybe you should teach me.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{sky people can not learn. you do not see.}
<A>__{she leaps to another elevated root. jake follows, surprised that he made it.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{whooaa.}
<A>__{he runs to catch up with her easy jogging pace.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{then teach me to "see."}
<A>__{she stops and he almost runs into her.}
<C>__{neytiri}
<D>__{no one can teach you to see.}
<A>__{then she turns and trots on.}
