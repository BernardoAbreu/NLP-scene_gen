<L>__{exterior crime scene, highway, vermont, dusk, 1992}
<A>__{starks and tenny 30s, shifty, a total stranger sit in silence in tenny's car. (we recognize the murder scene.) red police lights flash in the rearview mirror though starks doesn't see them yet. starks and tenny are talking to one another. tenny's voice takes a dangerous tone.}
<C>__{tenny}
<D>__{you ever been to jail?}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{tenny nods, distracting starks long enough to slip a hand down his leg to the gun he's hidden there.}
<C>__{tenny}
<D>__{it's worse than war. it's worse than anywhere you've ever been.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i doubt it. [beat] i don't think prison's so bad you don't want to remember it...}
<A>__{tenny carefully pulls over to the side of the road, assured and cautious with each word, each move.}
<C>__{tenny}
<D>__{well, i've never been to war, but i'm sure as hell not going back to prison. starks [finally spotting harrison] what's he pulling us over for? tenny [still preparing himself] recreation.}
<A>__{officer harrison walks up to their car.}
<C>__{officer harrison}
<D>__{gentlemen, i'm gonna need you to step out of the car, with your hands at your side please.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{why? officer harrison [sternly] step out of the car.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{ok, sir. i was just asking what for.}
<C>__{officer harrison}
<D>__{this is a stolen vehicle you're driving. now put your hands in the air, out where i can see 'em.}
<A>__{that's the second when officer harrison sees where tenny's hand is. as he reaches for his own gun, the situation explodes as two flashes eclipse all else. officer harrison goes down, still holding his own gun and starks jumps out of the car to check on him.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{jesus christ, what'd you do that for?}
<A>__{tenny looks around, still holding the gun. starks swallows, assessing whether to back away or not. tenny waves his gun as he half points it in harrison's direction. then, gun still in hand, he smirks nervously and looks at starks.}
<C>__{tenny}
<D>__{man, if you're so deaf and dumb, you ain't even worth a fucking bullet.}
<A>__{tenny raises the gun, then aims it away from starks and shoots officer harrison once more. from the ground, officer harrison fires back and starks, now lunging at tenny, takes}
<B>__{the hit.}
<A>__{starks falls, clearly unable to get up, let alone pursue anyone. tenny smiles sardonically and slowly puts the gun in his back pocket as he turns to leave. this smile was one of the eerie flashes that haunted starks in the jacket... starks struggles but can't move. that's when he passes out, looking at officer harrison from the ground, as he did in the scene before.}
