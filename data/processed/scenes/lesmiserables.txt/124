<L>__{exterior back alley day}
<A>__{valjean carries marius down a long narrow alley that runs between the backs of tall houses. the alley turns a corner and there ahead is a dead end. behind him, the stamp of soldiers' boots. ahead, no way out. then his searching gaze falls on an iron grating in the ground. a storm drain. on the soldiers as they come round the corner into the end of the alley. they look round. it's empty.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{nothing here!}
<A>__{the soldiers depart. a moment of silence. then into the alley's end steps javert. not so easily fooled. he walks all the way to the end, and looks round. he sees the drain at his feet. he sees the signs that the grating has been lifted. he stoops, and tries to lift it. it's far too heavy for him. he straightens up and looks round, calculating. where does the drain lead?}
