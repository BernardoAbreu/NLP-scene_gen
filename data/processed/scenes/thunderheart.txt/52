<A>__{exhausted, ray lays his head back on the seat, and lets a long, constricted breath free. thunder rolls like the slow, deep roar of some giant bear up in the hills. he opens his eyes, looks out the window. pov: rain is coming down, and maggie is getting the children into the back of her truck. she helps them get a tarp over their heads. then as yellow bird pulls himself into the cab of the truck, she hefts the wheelchair and two boys load it in. she gets in, starts up, and rolls off down the sloping road.}
