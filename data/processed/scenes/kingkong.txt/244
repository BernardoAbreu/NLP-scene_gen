<A>__{looking at manhattan from the harbour ... the empire state building rises from the midtown area like a giant solitary finger, reaching for the heavens. wide shot ... kong climbing the empire state building, silhouetted against the lightening sky. looking down ... ann clings to kong's shoulder, a dizzying 1000 foot drop to the street below. kong climbs onto the observation deck of the empire state building. he gently places ann down ... a chill wind catches at her dress. ann looks up at kong ... blood slowly seeps from his numerous wounds ... kong sits still, staring out across the city ... to the east the sun is rising, casting an soft glow over buildings ... glinting off the waters of the east... ong looks down at ann ... he gestures with his hands ... touching his heart ... ann looks at him confused, he repeats the gesture}

<D>__{no!!!}
<A>__{the six naval planes fly at kong from different directions! machine guns start firing! kong roars ... and snatches at the naval planes as they zoom by ... he flinches as he is hit by bullets! kong clambers onto the side of the building and begins climbing to the upper most level...attempting to draw the planes away from}
