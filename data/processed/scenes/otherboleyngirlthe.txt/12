<D>__{exterior kent countryside coast day the thunder of galloping horses. alf a dozen riders, among them a hooded woman, riding side saddle, tearing across the countryside.. exterior villages day the riders and the woman gallop through villages, spraying mud. villagers stop and stare.. a mother pulls a child out of the path of the riders. exterior countryside night the riders and the woman ride in silhouette against a perfect full moon.. exterior countryside day henry and several of his courtiers return from a hunting trip. several dead stags are carried on horseback. the atmosphere is celebratory. it's been a good day. dogs bark in excitement. interior greenwich palace that night a dinner at court. henry is at one end, in serious conversation with foreign ambassadors. presently, at the other end of the table, loud laughter. henry looks up, then returns to his conversation. it's not long before another loud gale of laughter in the corner of the room. henry looks up again. then returns to his conversation. presently, a third roar of laughter at the other end. this time, henry loses patience..}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{what's the noise? i can hardly hear myself think! at the other end, a courtier gets to his feet..}
<C>__{brandon}
<D>__{it's mistress boleyn, your majesty. her stories about life at the french court. they are particularly amusing. henry's expression changes. the room falls silent..}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i'm only aware of one boleyn girl and she is lying in with a certain child in her belly!}
<A>__{sir thomas boleyn gets to his feet..}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{it's my elder daughter, anne, your majesty. she has returned to court.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{what? that awful girl, thomas? the one that almost killed me?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{you allowed her back?}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{the time abroad has done her good, your majesty. i'm certain you'd find her much improved.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{really..?}
<A>__{henry looks down the table..}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{well, come on. where are you, other boleyn girl? show your face.}
<A>__{anne slowly gets to her feet. henry looks up. when he sees anne's face, his face falls.. anne is a woman transformed. gone are the simple clothes, puppy fat and lack of confidence. anne has become a glorious, head turning siren; dressed in daring french clothes. er hood is half crescent, and reveals the hair. her neckline plunges sexily. her sleeves are long and loose, offering daring flashes of arm and elbow.. like every other red blooded man in the room, henry is utterly mesmerised. speechless..}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{so? what is so amusing, anne? perhaps we might hear and judge for ourselves?}
<A>__{anne dark, intelligent eyes stare back at henry. suddenly, all sound fades, and the world shrinks around them: it's as though they are the only two people in the room..}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i was just giving my thoughts on the new french king.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{which are..?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{that for someone with such great wealth, and power..he has surprisingly little authority as a man.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{hah!}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{and is so consumed by one particular rivalry he can barely think.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{really? and who is this rival?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{a neighbouring king, who's name one is forbidden to mention at court. whose reputation haunts him in his thoughts and dreams.}
<A>__{ipples of laughter, as people guess..}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{whose armies and navy thwart his every endeavour. whose physical and intellectual endowments are known far and wide.}
<A>__{enry laughs too. enjoying this..}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{in order to restore his confidence, this french king spends a fortune on anything that glitters, on building of castles with large towers..}
<A>__{anne artfully gestures the phallic implications..}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{but these symbols of wealth and virility fail to convince. talk among the ladies at court in france suggests..}
<A>__{anne stops herself...}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{that in this department too, the king has his shortcomings.}
<A>__{anne's gesture, (discreetly wiggling her small finger). henry stares for a moment. a deathly silence. has she gone too far?}
<D>__{then henry smiles. delighted. dogs bark in bewilderment. soon everyone in the room laughs too. except for the seymours, (sir john and his sons, edward and thomas), who glower, mute, at the end of the table beside their sister jane.. interior mary's bedroom day sir thomas beams with excitement and satisfaction...}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{you should have seen the seymours! their faces! mary lies in bed. sitting by her side is her father..}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{they must have thought that with you out of the way, they had a real opportunity with that pale faced thing of theirs, jane... sir thomas smiles as he remembers..}
<C>__{sir thomas }
<D>__{but anne put pay to that. last night, the king only had eyes for us boleyns. mary shoots a private, knowing look..}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{or her, you mean.}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{'m wary of any suggestion that anne would serve anyone but herself. france can't have changed her that much.}
<C>__{sir thomas}
<D>__{in this occasion i am quite satisfied she was being loyal to you.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{really? mary stares hollow eyed..}
<C>__{mary }
<D>__{then ask yourself this. if she is really so concerned for my well being...}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{...then why has she not come to see me since she returned?}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{exterior tiltyard day henry and several of his closest courtiers are sparring close combat sword fighting. it's tough, physical, no holds barred stuff.. interior armoury day afterwards: henry and his courtiers, (among them george), are being undressed and washed by their pages and squires..}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{you're a fortunate man, george. to be blessed with two such sisters.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{yes, my lord. there is a powerful physicality, a sexual confidence to henry which he exudes, even among men. he moves closer to george.}
<C>__{enry}
<D>__{tell me. are they as different in temper as they are in looks?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{oh, yes. each has her own, quite distinct virtues. mary for example..}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i'm familiar with mary's. tell me about anne's.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{anne? well, she's strong. some might say `difficult'.}
<C>__{enry}
<D>__{headstrong. with a fiery temper.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{but with it comes great passion, too. it's both the best and the worst thing about her.}
<P>__{a beat)}
<D>__{there are no half measures with anne.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{careful, you'll make me think i chose the wrong boleyn girl.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{oh, no. i'm certain mary is the right choice. you will have a serene, happy, life with her. the risk is with anne, it might be like being caught in a wild summer storm.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{is that so..? george has tried to put henry off. but might just have said the wrong thing.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{a storm, you say..? interior boleyn apartments court following day a small, precious looking gift box sits on a table.}
<C>__{ervant}
<D>__{from the king, madam. anne looks at the box. her heart misses a beat. it carries the unmistakable royal seal.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{open it. a servant stares..}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{i said `open it.' the servant opens it. other servants crane their necks, stand on tiptoes. inside is a large pearl pendant. the servant gasps. anne, too. covers her mouth. it's beautiful.. but from somewhere, she manages to find the strength..}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{now close it again. and send it back. the servant stares in disbelief..}
<C>__{anne }
<D>__{you heard me. the servant bows, and leaves, taking the box. anne watches, a look of mischief in her eyes. she's up to no good. interior king's apartment day the servant nervously stands in front of the king, holding the box.. .}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{she did what?}
<C>__{servant}
<D>__{sent it back, your grace. henry's face. confounded..}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{sent it back? exterior boleyn apartments day a royal messenger, in the king's livery, holding a larger, more expensive looking gift box, walks towards the boleyn house.. interior boleyn apartments day anne shakes her head, and sends the gift back. she looks anxious. knows this is a high risk game she's playing. interior king's apartments day the messenger stands in front of the king, holding the rejected box in his hands..}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{what? again? exterior boleyn apartments day the same royal messenger walks towards the boleyn house. this time holding an even larger, more expensive looking gift.. interior boleyn apartments day again, anne shakes her head, and sends the gift back. interior king's apartment day the king is in a meeting with several ambassadors on an important matter. the doors open. he looks up to see.. .the messenger returning with the latest gift. henry's smile fades.}

<D>__{interior corridors court day `crash', the king, flanked by several of his most intimidating courtiers, bursts through doors, and storms along a corridor. it's an impressive sight.. people scatter to get out of the way. interior boleyn apartments court day the king bursts in. everyone leaps to their feet. servants stop and stare and curtsey. lady elizabeth bows, clearly thrown..}
<C>__{lady elizabeth}
<D>__{your majesty. henry turns full circle, looking for someone..}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{your daughter. where is she?}
<C>__{lady elizabeth}
<D>__{mary..?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{anne! interior boleyn apartments day anne hears the king's voice. her eyes widen. she looks down. sees henry. anne smiles privately it's confirmation that her strategy has worked. t that moment, henry sees her, calls out, `anne!'. anne's smile fades. enry dashes up the stairs.. interior boleyn apartments day anne, who is not properly dressed for the king, rushes back to her room. henry follows. anne closes the door..}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{anne.. a}
<C>__{anne}

<D>__{and? they did not please you?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{on the contrary, my lord. they pleased me greatly.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{then why did you return them? now anne opens the door. she appears wearing a stunning outfit.. interior boleyn apartments day anne steps into the corridor. closes the door behind her.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{ecause my sister lies in bed with your child. if you wish to please me, sir, then send her the gifts you send me.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i have shown mary enough kindness and generosity. it's you i want, anne.}
<C>__{anne}

<C>__{henry}
<D>__{you. don't you see? you have changed.}
<C>__{anne}

<C>__{enry}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{how could i forget that you chose her above me when we first met? you liked her better.}
