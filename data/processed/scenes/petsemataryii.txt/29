<L>__{interior classroom day}
<A>__{mrs. gordon is addressing a room of seventh graders. geoff is doodling in his notebook, feeling acutely out of place as he tries to avoid the curious glances the rest of his new classmates are giving him.}
<C>__{mrs. gordon}
<D>__{people, this is geoff matthews. he'll be joining our class for the rest of the school year...}
<A>__{as mrs. gordon points to him, geoff drops his face even lower. this is the worst embarrassment a boy could ever suffer. he'd like to throttle mrs. gordon. a freckle faced boy, doug, fires off a question.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{hey, what's hollywood like? do you know eddie murphy?}
<C>__{geoff}
<P>__{(annoyed)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{mrs. gordon}
<D>__{why don't we save that for later, doug?}
<A>__{a girl with braces, susan, continues the interrogation.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{what about julia roberts?}
<C>__{mrs. gordon}
<D>__{susan! that'll be enough.}
<A>__{susan shuts up. geoff sinks even lower in his seat. the kids turn their eyes back to the front of the room. but one classmate's eyes are still on geoff. it's clyde. clyde shifts his stare to the squirming lump in geoff's jacket. he catches a glimpse of tiger's bobbing nose popping out.}
