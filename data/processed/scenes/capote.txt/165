<D>__{jack says i'm using perry, but he also thinks i fell in love with him when i was in kansas. how both of those things can be true is beyond me.}
<C>__{nelle}
<D>__{did you? fall in love with him.}
<A>__{silence as they load the bags into the trunk.}
<C>__{nelle}
<D>__{truman? }
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{i don't know how to answer that... it's as if perry and i started life in the same house. one day he stood up and walked out the back door while i walked out the front. with some different choices, he's the man i might have become.}
<C>__{nelle}
<D>__{are you kidding me?}
<A>__{truman shrugs, doesn't answer. nelle kisses him.}
<C>__{nelle}

<C>__{nelle}
<D>__{truman. honestly. are you going back to kansas because you care about perry or because you need information before he's killed?}
<C>__{truman}
<D>__{can't it be both?}
<C>__{nelle}
<D>__{no. i don't think it can be.}
<A>__{she drives away. truman watches her go. he turns back up toward the house, stops a moment to pick a flower from the bushes at the front gate.}
