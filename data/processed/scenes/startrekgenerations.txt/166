<C>__{soran}
<D>__{now, if you'll excuse me, captain, i have an appointment with eternity and i don't want to be late.}
<A>__{we realize we are watching the same events play out again. soran turns and begins to climb up the scaffolding toward the top of the rock face. picard drops to the ground on his back and begins to wriggle underneath the forcefield. picard accidentally touches the field... soran (vfx p) turns at the sound of the field, sees picard, and then draws his weapon. soran quickly fires at picard. the ground (vfx p) is blasted apart, creating a cloud of dirt and debris, obscuring picard and the whole area momentarily. soran jumps down one level, his disruptor still in his}
<D>__{hand, ready just in case picard somehow survived.}
<A>__{soran peers through the cloud of dust and debris. the dust clears... but picard is gone along with}
<D>__{several feet of the ground where he was crawling.}
<A>__{soran (vfx i) soran glances up at the sky and sees the energy ribbon, then begins to climb the scaffolding. suddenly a boot kicks him in the head.}
<B>__{reveal kirk}
<A>__{who is attacking soran in picard's place. the two men begin to fight. new angle (vfx p) as picard rushes to the probe launcher and steps up onto the control platform and desperately begins trying to shut down the launcher... the following happens very quickly: kirk fights with soran, hand to hand, brutal. picard works the control panel, trying to make sense}
<D>__{of it all. it won't respond. the control panel is bizarre and confusing many different screens and alien graphics. the alien countdown graphics continues to race by.}
<A>__{the sky (vfx i) the distant energy ribbon can be seen getting closer...}
<B>__{the mountaintop}
<A>__{soran tries to pull his disruptor, but kirk knocks it to the ground. there's a struggle for the weapon... picard looks helplessly at the control panel.}
<D>__{nothing he does has any effect. he keeps hitting buttons...looking for other control panels, anything to affect the launcher.}
<A>__{angle (vfx p) suddenly, picard touches one particular control and the screen changes to an image of the veridian sun, held in the center of the alien cross hair. picard (vfx p) begins working the control panel... desperate... he looks at the screen... hits a control. suddenly the probe cloaks. picard reacts at his mistake. picard is left standing on an invisible platform three feet in the air a bizarre sight. picard isn't sure what to do he can feel the console, but he can't see any of the controls. kirk punches soran and sends him flying backward.}
<D>__{soran lands heavily on the ground, unconscious. kirk stands over him, breathing heavily. he holds his back in pain that old back pain from the beginning of the movie.}

<P>__{(desperate)}
<D>__{kirk there's a control padd in his right pocket!}
<A>__{kirk (vfx p) sees picard standing in mid air and then reaches down, pulls the control padd out of soran's pocket. he begins working it...}
<B>__{close on soran}
<A>__{his eyes open... he sees what kirk is doing... looks around quickly... sees the disruptor lying a few feet away, just beyond his reach... the probe launcher (vfx p) decloaks. picard goes back to working on the controls. kirk (vfx p) he smiles.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{the twenty fourth century isn't so tough.}
<A>__{without warning, kirk is blasted forward, shot from behind. reveal soran on the ground with the disruptor in his hand. he gets up, whirls around, points the weapon at picard. mountaintop wide the probe is suddenly launched in a roar of flame. soran freezes. his eyes follow the probe as it arcs into the sky. the two men watch the probe as it heads toward the sun... the probe (vfx i) makes a sweeping turn to the right and arcs back down toward the planet. soran watches in horror as the probe crashes harmlessly into the distant jungle. we hear a muffled explosion. soran (vfx i) can't believe his dreams have been shattered. he looks into the sky and sees the distant ribbon streaking overhead. the disruptor falls from his hand as he rushes to the top of the scaffolding.}
<B>__{picard}
<A>__{moves to kirk, checks his pulse. the captain's eyes flutter he's still holding on, but he's badly wounded. soran (vfx i) is standing on the rock ledge. he reaches up toward the sky as if trying to grab the ribbon with his bare hands...but the ribbon passes by and disappears.}
<C>__{soran}
<D>__{no...}
<A>__{his look of shock turns to fury and madness. he turns to picard.}

<D>__{you!!}
<A>__{new angle (vfx p) he jumps down a few levels and then dives off the scaffolding at picard. but picard is quicker. he grabs the disruptor and fires the blast catches soran in mid air . soran drops to the ground a short distance away. dead. the pocket watch has been shattered.}
<B>__{picard}
<A>__{turns back to kirk, cradles the dying man's head in his lap. kirk's eyes flick open, and he takes a ragged breath.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{nice shot.}

<D>__{least i could do...for a captain of the enterprise.}
<A>__{kirk coughs again}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{try to hang on.}
<A>__{kirk looks up at the sky. the sunlight is warm on his face. a quiet moment... then, with a last smile on his face}
<C>__{kirk}
