<C>__{equerry}
<D>__{when we reach the audience room, i will knock. we will not wait to be called, we will go straight inside. standing by the door, we bow. from the neck. i will introduce you. the queen will extend her hand, you go to her, bow again, then shake her hand.}
<A>__{tony shoots his cuffs, `right', clears his throat.}
<C>__{querry }
<D>__{couple of other things. it's `ma'am' as in ham, not ma'am as in farm.}

<C>__{equerry}
<D>__{and when you're in the presence, at no point must you show your back.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{the `presence'?}
<C>__{equerry}
<D>__{yes, sir. that's what it's called, when you're in her majesty's company.}
<A>__{tony turns, shoots a look at cherie, who sticks her fingers down her throat. tony smiles back.. the equerry reaches a grand door, and knocks gently. without waiting for a reply, he enters.. cherie is left in the corridor. alone. she stares at a liveried footman. he stares back. no life behind his eyes. cherie takes a seat on a chair. eyes widen to herself.}
