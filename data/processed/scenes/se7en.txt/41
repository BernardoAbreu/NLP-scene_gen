<A>__{the walls are black. somerset opens the door, enters, walks down the long flight of stairs. as somerset descends, the jazz music fades and is engulfed by the sound of speed metal.}
<B>__{deafening.}
<A>__{at the bottom, somerset opens another door. he enters }
<L>__{interior underground art gallery night}
<A>__{a narrow room. speed metal is even louder. this is a private art party. the people are lizard like, pale. men and women priding themselves on their gauntness. somerset passes canvases on the walls. pointlessly abstract paintings. splatters, smears and blobs of color. party people stand in front of these "works," engrossed. somerset slides past, not interested in the art, jamming the tissue further in his ears. he spots his objective. william mccracken, 42, stands inside a circle of admirers. he is dressed like a pauper, his baggy clothing stained with many colors of painterior he wears dark sunglasses, bored by the bleached blonde girl whispering in his ear. somerset worms his way to stand in front of william. the party goers turn their attention to this intrusion. william looks up, pushes the girl away. he takes off his sunglasses. his eyes are badly bloodshot and listless. he looks somerset over... and then grins, glad to see him.}
