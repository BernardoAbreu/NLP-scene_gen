<L>__{interior bungalow #86 close on venetian blinds later}
<A>__{(after school) as they open revealing the clock and just as suddenly close. tilt down to find trevor working the cords to the blinds he's rigged over the timeplace. a faint knock breaks his spell as he glances up to discover ellen henry standing in the open doorway.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{may i come in?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{yeah...}
<P>__{(points at her)}
<D>__{... ellen.}
<C>__{ellena}
<P>__{(pointing back)}
<D>__{trevor.}
<A>__{he sees her looking quizzically at the blinds he's rigged over the clock.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(explaining)}
<D>__{i'm making time a reward instead of a distraction.}
<A>__{impressed, ellen peruses the room now with a benign gaze.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{clever... listen, i wanted to apologize for jumping up like i did at lunch. i was just feeling a little weird...}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{it's alright.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{for what it's worth, dave childress thinks you walk on water.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{is that a good thing?}
<A>__{ellen flickers a grin, point taken.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{i think it takes a lot of courage to go back into a classroom after something like that.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{not if the only thing you ever wanted to do was teach.}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{now you see, there's our predicament.}
<A>__{whack the noise pulls ellen's attention out the window where the boys play a rough game of basketball.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{i assume you've met benny chacon?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i have.}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(absently)}
<D>__{last week benny and his tagging crew had ms. eskander pinned in the corner over there.}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{... she's seven months pregnant and he's tormenting her with a broom handle... can i help you with those?}
<A>__{trevor is trying to put some books on an upper shelf, but he's having trouble raising his arm high enough. ellen sees he's in pain.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{no thanks.}
<A>__{she watches him struggle, then breaks the awkwardness.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{so anyway, gloria kicks benny... and if the district construes it as assault and battery on a student, she's gone.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{they'd do that?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{in a heart beat. she's non tenured, they don't want to get sued...}
<P>__{(with resignation)}
<D>__{don't be surprised if she files for stress leave by the end of the week. too bad, too. she's a good teacher.}
<A>__{whack... whack... outside, the kids continue to play. the late sun makes their violent shadows swarm over ellen.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{can i ask you a personal question?}
<A>__{trevor glances up. here's what she really wants to know...}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(tentatively now)}
<D>__{why'd that kid attack you?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{because i flunked him.}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(sobered)}
<D>__{is there any way you can see something like that coming?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{when they say they wanna kill you, you'd best take it serious. this kid was an o.t. opportunity transfer but nobody told me until it was too late.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{did you know benny's an o.t.?... in less than a year he's been convicted of felony assault and suspended twice. i even testified against him as a character witness. now i get to see him every day in homeroom. i'm stuck with him. condition of his probation is that he stay in school.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{you talk to the principal?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{many times... three weeks ago, garcia calls benny's mother in for a conference, but she refuses to show up. she's afraid they'll deport her because she's illegal. so she contacts the a.c.l.u. and some attorney tells her she doesn't have to come in.}
<P>__{(still can't believe)}
<D>__{garcia got cold feet and dropped the whole thing.}
<P>__{(fear building)}
<D>__{this kid's threatening me and all he's worried about is a lawsuit.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(intent now)}
<D>__{what'd benny say to you?}
<A>__{tears involuntarily well up in ellen's eyes. hold for an awkward moment as she collects herself.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{that he wanted to hurt me. real bad.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{does he know where you live?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{i think so. someone's been phoning me at night and hanging up... two weeks ago, my car was broken into... and last friday, i think he was inside my house... but i can't prove it.}
<A>__{the shadows of the basketball players rage inside the bungalow.}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(bottom lip quivers)}
<D>__{... i don't know what to do.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{you can quit.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{you didn't.}
<A>__{off trevor's severe gaze...}
