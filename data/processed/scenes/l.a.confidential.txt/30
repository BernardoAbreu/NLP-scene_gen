<D>__{the day he got the medal of valor. a simpler time.}
<A>__{remembering, exley invokes his father's favorite toast.}

<D>__{i saw the test results on the lieutenant's exam. you placed first out of twenty three.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{the youngest applicant by eight years.}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{you'll make lieutenant inside a year. patrol division?}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{i was thinking detective bureau.}
<A>__{we can see dudley doesn't approve.}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{you don't have the eye for human weakness to be a good detective. or the stomach. you're a political animal, edmund.}
<A>__{the criticism stings, but dudley's a straight shooter.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{you're wrong.}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{am i...? would you be willing to plant corroborative evidence on a suspect you knew was guilty in order to ensure an indictment?}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{dudley, we've been over this.}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{answer yes or no.}
<C>__{exley}

<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{would you be willing to shoot hardened criminals in the back to offset the chance }
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{then for god's sake, don't be a detective. stick to assignments where you won't have to make those choices. patrol, internal affairs, but not the bureau.}
<C>__{exley}
<D>__{i know you mean well, dudley, but i don't need to do it the way you did. or my father.}
<C>__{dudley}
<D>__{at least get rid of the glasses. i can't think of one bureau man who wears them.}
