<L>__{interior sean's office day}
<A>__{lambeau stands across from sean, seething.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{this is a disaster! i brought you in here to help me with this boy, not to run him out }
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{now wait a minute }
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{ and confuse him }
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{ gerry }
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{and here i am for the second week in a row with my professional reputation at stake }
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{hold on!}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{ready to falsify documents because you've given him license to walk away from this.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{i know what i'm doing and i know why i'm here!}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{look sean, i don't care if you have a rapport with the boy i don't care if you have a few laughs even at my expense! but don't you dare undermine what i'm trying to do here.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{"undermine?"}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{he has a gift and with that gift comes responsibility. and you don't understand that he's at a fragile point }
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{he is at a fragile pointerior he's got problems }
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{what problems does he have, sean, that he is better off as a janitor or in jail or hanging around with }
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{why do you think he does that, gerry?}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{he can handle the work, he can handle the pressure and he's obviously handled you.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{why is he hiding? why is he a janitor? why doesn't he trust anybody? because the first thing that happened to him was that he was abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most!}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{oh, come on, sean }
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{and why does he hang out with his friends? because any one of those kids would come in here and take a bat to your head if he asked them to. it's called loyalty!}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{oh, that's nice }
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{and who do you think he's handling? he pushes people away before they have a chance to leave him. and for 20 years he's been alone because of that. and if you try to push him into this, it's going to be the same thing all over again. and i'm not going to let that happen to him!}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{now don't do that. don't you do that! don't infect him with the idea that it's okay to quit. that it's okay to be a failure, because it's not okay! if you're angry at me for being successful, for being what you could have been }
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{ i'm not angry at you }
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{yes you are, sean. you resent me. and i'm not going to apologize for any success that i've had.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{ i don't have any anger at you }
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{yes you do. you're angry at me for doing what you could have done. ask yourself if you want will to feel that way for the rest of his life, to feel like a failure.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{that's it. that's why i don't come to the goddamn reunions! because i can't stand the look in your eye when you see me! you think i'm a failure! i know who i am. i'm proud of who i am. and all of you, you think i'm some kind of pity case! you with your sycophant students following you around. and your goddamn medal!}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{is that what this is about, sean? the field's medal? do you want me to go home and get it for you? then will you let the boy }
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{i don't want your trophy and i don't give a shit about it! 'cause i knew you when!! you and jack and tom sanders. i knew you when you were homesick and pimply faced and didn't know what side of the bed to piss on!}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{that's right! you were smarter than us then and you're smarter than us now! so don't blame me for how your life turned out. it's not my fault.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{i don't blame you! it's not about that! it's about the boy! 'cause he's a good kid! and i won't see this happen to him won't see you make him feel like a failure too!}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{he won't be a failure!}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{if you push him into something, if you ride him }
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{you're wrong, sean. i'm where i am today because i was pushed. and because i learned to push myself!}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{he's not you!}
<A>__{a beat. lambeau turns, something catches his eye. sean turns to look, it's will. he is standing in the doorway.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i can come back.}
<C>__{lambeau}
<D>__{no, that's fine, will. i was just leaving.}
<A>__{there is an awkward moment as lambeau gets his coat and leaves.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{well, i'm here.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so, is that my problem? i'm afraid of being abandoned? that was easy.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{look, a lot of that stuff goes back a long way. and it's between me and him and it has nothing to do with you.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{do you want to talk about it?}
<A>__{sean smiles. a beat. will sees a file on sean's desk.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{oh, this is your file. i have to send it back to the judge with my evaluation.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you're not going to fail me are you?}
<A>__{sean smiles.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{so what's it say?}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{you want to read it?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{have you had any experience with that?}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{twenty years of counseling you see a lot of }
<C>__{will}
<D>__{no, have you had any experience with that?}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{it sure ain't good.}
