<A>__{vampire morning. a misty predawn, bled of all color. steel gray tones. the ocean vanishes in the fog a few feet from shore. tyler and johnny, carrying their boards, walk toward the water.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{come on, utah. everybody's out there catchin' all the good rides.}
<A>__{she realizes he has stopped ten feet behind her, like a great weight has dragged him to a halt.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{what's wrong johnny?}
<P>__{(goes back to him)}
<D>__{you're like a different person.}
<A>__{he stares at her. his expression dark... wrestling with something.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{i am a different person, tyler.}
<A>__{he lets out a long breath and looks away, out to sea. johnny's pov... the water receding into a backlit wall of mist. figures appear, faint silhouettes in the fog. shades of gray in the gray. in slow motion they weave hypnotically across the screen, their shapes merging and unmerging as they cross each other. stacked up by the extreme long lens, bodhi, roach, grommet and nathaniel crave and slash toward us with mystical grace. in suspended time we see them hooting and grinning at each other as they cut aggressive moves close to each other. dolphins playing. challenging each other in mock combat. so good, their boards slash past each other with inches to spare. there is an incredible sense of freedom and exhilaration. bonding forged through mastery of this arcane art. for the first time we see the core group of bodhi's tribe, by themselves. it dawns on us... there are four of them. and at that moment nathaniel drops in front of bodhi, laughing at the near miss, and drops his pants in a nasty wig wagging moon. tracking slowly in on johnny staring, mouth open. watching the four horsemen of the apocalypse ride toward him. in slow motion, bodhi grins as he slashes past nathaniel's shining white butt. on johnny, as he reacts to the dawning certainty. he feels weak, dizzy... like the ground is moving under him.}
