<L>__{interior lowrey's condo night}
<A>__{the door opens, burnett gropes awkwardly in the dark for the light switch. finally finds it.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{i forgot i had those switches moved. welcome to casa del lowrey.}
<A>__{julie enters, looking left and right, cautious but impressed by the stylish digs.}

<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{i uh... i invest.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{right. what was your last pick? a horse in the number two race at pimlico? or did a bookie give you an inside tip.}

<A>__{which julie runs her hands across labels. all french.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{ my father invests... listen. you must be tired }
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i will ask you this only once, mike. are you on the take? and if you say no and i discover you're lying to me, i will walk. are we clear?}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{fair enough. i'm not on the take. satisfied? good. so... why don't you make yourself at home? here's the t.v. remote. watch yourself some 'gilligan's island' reruns or somethin'.}
<A>__{hits "on" button. instead of tv, the room immediately becomes a seduction den: lights dim, romantic music.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{heh all these damn things look alike.}
<P>__{(switches it off)}
<D>__{well, gotta run... there's probably a couple of good steaks in the fridge for the dogs. help yourself to whatever.}
<P>__{(starts to go)}
<D>__{i will check on you in the morning.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{where are you going?}

<D>__{and now there's you, so that makes it this high.}
<A>__{to his neck.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{you mean, you're going to leave me alone? in your place. with all your stuff?}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{why shouldn't i? are you a thief or a vandal?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{of course not. and i'm not a call girl, either.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{i didn't ask.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i know you didn't. i just thought you should know.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{okay. important lesson. julie's not a call girl. can i go now?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{just one more thing.}
<A>__{julie steps forward and wraps her arms around burnett. it's a one way hug. uncomfortable, burnett doesn't reciprocate other than a palsy pat on the back.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{thank you. for everything.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{don't mention it.}
<A>__{burnett tries to break toward the door when the phone rings. burnett stares at the phone, not knowing what to do.}

<D>__{miiike... it's yvette... i know i told you i don't date cops. and i know i told you i wouldn't sleep with a man i wasn't going to marry. but i've been thinking and i remember when you said thinking was a dangerous thing so i started feeling... well, lonely. remember when you gave me that key }
<A>__{burnett charges over and shuts off the machine.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{it's uh... it's uh...}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{you don't have to explain.}
<A>__{finally, they've reached consensus. burnett grins and is out the door.}
