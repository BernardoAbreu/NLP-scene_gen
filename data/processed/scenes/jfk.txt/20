<A>__{swald living in a boarding house. it is at night, and he sits in his room alone. the housekeeper, earlene roberts, heavyset, white, in her 60's, comes in and asks him if he wants to watch some tv with her. he declines.}
<C>__{susie}
<D>__{when he's arrested, marina buries him with the public. her description of him is that of a psychotic and violent man.}
<A>__{flashback to marina on tv, a different person from before.}
<C>__{marina}
<D>__{i do not want to believe, but i have too much facts.. tell me that lee shot kennedy.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{yeah, after, they take her to six flags inn in arlington, prepare her for the interviews, teach her how she should answer and after two months and 46 interviews, she has a nervous breakdown.}
<P>__{(flashback)}
<D>__{oswald was no angel, that's clear, but who was he?}
<A>__{back to antoine's restaurant.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i'm lost, boss. what are we saying here?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{we're saying that when oswald went to russia, he was not a real defector, that he was an intelligence agent on some kind of mission for our government and he remained one till the day he died, that's what we're saying.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{and therefore because oswald pulled the trigger, the intelligence community murdered their own commander in chief. that's what you're saying!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i will go you one better! maybe oswald didn't even pull the trigger, bill. the nitrate test indicates he didn't even fire a rifle on november 22nd. and on top of that, they didn't even bother to check if the rifle had been fired that day.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{he had his palm print on the weapon.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{it went to the goddamn fbi and they didn't find a goddamn thing. it comes back a week later and one guy in the dallas police department suddenly finds a palm print which for all i know he could've taken off oswald at the morgue. there's no chain of evidence, bill. and what about the tow guns actually seen in the depository? one an enfield photographed by a newsman and the other a mauser, described by deputy weitzman... maybe, just maybe, lee oswald was exactly what he said he was bill "a patsy". take it at face value. lou, susie, i'm going with my gut here. he's got an alias of hidell to buy the rifle, "o.h. lee" to rent the room, right? what's in a name, right? in intelligence, they're assumed to be fake. a name is sort of like a postbox number, a code several different people can use the same name, right? then why can't somebody be using oswald's name?}
<A>__{we see blank faces around the table.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{but why?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{to frame him, obviously. you got to get in your minds how the hell spooks think, bill! they're not ordinary crooks.}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{i never could figure out why this guy orders a traceable weapon to that post office box when you can go into any store in texas, give a phony name and walk out with a cheap rifle which can never be traced.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{unless he or someone else wants him to get caught. maybe he never ordered the weapon, lou. somebody else did. it was picked up at the post office early morning when oswald's time sheet shows him clocked in at his job. lou, come alive. these things are not adding up.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{i still have to question what the legal basis is that supports this, boss. susie's stuff is colorful, but...}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{let's start making some assumptions about the man. why would he leave a path as big as lee harvey oswald's? this is not a thin trail, gentlemen, it is a very wide one. who found the evidence? who set him up? lou, bill, susie, i want you to go back and check all the sightings of oswald in dallas, new orleans and mexico in the summer and fall of '63 see if it's the same guy.}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{boss, oswald impersonators? sounds like james bond now.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{al, you can't tell a mink from a coonskin unless you see the fur up close. goddamn, sam! if we don't start reading between the lines here! y'all gotta start thinking on a different level like the cia does. we're through the looking glass. here white is black and black is white.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{what do you think, lou?}
<C>__{lou}
<D>__{i'm just an investigator, bill. i leave the theories to you lawyers.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{you, numa?}
<C>__{numa}
<D>__{a week ago i would've said this is nuts, but now ...}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{there's a lot of smoke there, but there's some fire.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{now you guys, come on. you're talking about the united states government here!}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{we're talking about a crime, bill. no one is above the law. reduce it. a crime was committed. let's get to work.}
<A>__{medical unit jail day(1966) jack ruby, thick fudge of an angry face, flu ridden, confronts a doctor and two guards in his cell.}

<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{please relax, mr. ruby. this'll calm you down and clear this up.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{doc, i'm telling you, i don't need any shots.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{mr. ruby, i don't want to involve the guards. it'll just take a few seconds.}
<A>__{ruby looks over at the two guards, who eye him. the doctor gives him the injection. flashback to ruby's jail cell in 1964. ruby talks to men with their backs to us. lawyers and police clutter the cell, making ruby hyper nervous. the chief official's white hair and avuncular voice are all we see and hear of him; his back is to us.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{then do you understand that i cannot tell the truth here? in dallas. that there are people here who do not want me to tell the truth... who do not want me to have a retrial?}
<C>__{official}
<D>__{mr. ruby, i really can't see why you can't tell us now.}
<A>__{ruby catches the stern face of sheriff bill decker from the corner of his eye, the assistant d.a. next to him.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{when are you going back to washington, sir?}
<C>__{official}
<P>__{(looks at watch)}
<D>__{i am going back very shortly after we finish this hearing i am going to have some lunch.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{can i make a statement? if you request me to go back to washington with you right now, that is if you want to hear further testimony from me, can you do that? can you take me with you?}
<C>__{official}
<D>__{no, that could not be done, mr. ruby. there are a good many things involved in that.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{what are they?}
<C>__{official}
<D>__{well, the public attention it would attract. and we have no place for you there to be safe, we're not law enforcement officials, and many things are at stake in this affair, mr. ruby.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{but if i am eliminated there won't be any way of knowing. consequently a whole new form of government is going to take over this country, and i know i won't live to see you another time. my life is in danger here. do i sound screwy?}
<C>__{official}
<D>__{well i don't know what can be done, mr. ruby, because i don't know what you anticipate we will encounter.}
<C>__{ruby}
<D>__{then you don't stand a chance, mr. chief justice, you have a lost cause. all i want is a lie detector test, and you refuse to give it to me. because as it stands now and the truth serum how do you pronounce it pentothal whatever it is. they will not give it to me, because i want to tell the truth... and then i want to leave this world.}

<C>__{andrews}
<D>__{why you keep dancing on my head for, my man? we been thicker'n molasses pie since law school.}
<C>__{jim}

<C>__{andrews}
<D>__{there you go. grain of salt. two sides to every coin.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you tell them the day after the assassination you were called on the phone by this "clay bertrand" and asked to fly to dallas and be lee oswald's layer.}
<C>__{andrews}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{now that's pretty important, dean. you also told the fbi when you met him, he was six foot two. then you tell the commission he was five foot eight. how the hell did the man shrink like that, dean?}
<C>__{andrews}
<D>__{they put the heat on, my man, just like you're doing. i gave'em anything that popped into my cabeza. truth is, i never met the dude.}
<A>__{sudden flashback to andrews' office on a day in 1963. clay bertrand sits, back to us, talking to andrews. he has close cropped white hair. he is the same patrician man we've seen earlier with oswald on canal street and in banister's office. andrews is evidently lying.}
<C>__{andrews}
<D>__{i don't know what the cat looks like and furthermore i don't know where he's at. all i know is sometimes he sends me cases. so one day he's on the phone talkin' to me about going to dallas and repping oswald...}

<P>__{(remembering)}
<D>__{yeah, she was pretty, all right, but not half as cute as you, deano. you shoulda tried a legitimate line of business.}
<C>__{andrews}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{you can't ever say crime don't pay in louisiana, jim only not as good as it used to. good chowder, ain't it?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{when did you first do business with this bertrand?}
<C>__{andrews}
<P>__{(bored)}
<D>__{oh, i first heard these street cats jiving about him back in '56, '57 when i lived down in the quarter.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{street cats?}
<C>__{andrews}
<D>__{swishes. they swish, y'know. young fags, you know. they'd come into my bureau needing help, no bread, and i'd say, hey man, i ain't rockefeller, who gonna back you up? these cornmuffins go to the phone and dial...}
<A>__{flashback to andrews' office on another day in 1963. we catch a glimpse of a young swish sitting in andrew's office talking on the phone. andrews is also on the phone to bertrand, unseen, on the other end.}
<C>__{andrews}
<D>__{the dude on the other end says...}
<C>__{clay bertrand}
<D>__{i'm clay bertrand. whatever they owe, i guarantee.}
<C>__{andrews}
<D>__{hey, suits me fine, daddy warbucks how do i get in touch with you?}
<C>__{clay bertrand}
<D>__{i'm around.}
<C>__{andrews }
<D>__{and that's how i first heard of clay bertrand.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{what was his voice like?}
<C>__{andrews}
<D>__{you knew you weren't talking to some low life fag, you know. he had command of the king's english.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{did he pay?}
<C>__{andrews}
<D>__{always like tits on a pig. i wish i had a million of those bimbettes.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{and oswald?}
<C>__{andrews}
<P>__{(just a slight hesitation)}
<D>__{like i told to the washington boys, bertrand called that summer and asked me to help the kid upgrade his marine discharge...}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{so you saw oswald how many times?}
<C>__{andrews}
<D>__{three, four. he came in with a few cubano swishes one time i remember...}
<A>__{flashback to a third day at andrew's office in 1963. oswald is in the office with two young boys.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{recall any names?}
<C>__{andrews}
<P>__{(in present)}
<D>__{mario, jose they wear names like you and i wear clothes. today the name is candy, tomorrow it's butsie. i wish i could help you, jim.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{did you speak to oswald in dallas?}
<C>__{andrews}
<P>__{(knee jerk reaction)}
<D>__{hell, no! i told this bertrand cat right off, this isn't my scene, man. i deal with muni court, i'm a hack in nigger town, that kid needs a hot dog.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{then how the hell did you get in the warren commission, dean? except through the phone records in the dallas jail?}
<C>__{andrews}
<P>__{(nervous moment)}
<D>__{there were no phone records.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{of course there weren't. 'cause they disappeared. and yet the commission found you, dean.}
<C>__{andrews}
<D>__{i don't know how they got to me. maybe cause i repped him here. the feebees run background checks. on my mama's breasts, man, that's all i got.}
<P>__{(pauses, adjusts)}
<D>__{there wasn't no conspiracy, jim. if there were, why the hell didn't bobby kennedy prosecute it as attorney general, he was his brother for chrissake. how the fuck three people could keep a secret like that, i don't know. it was oswald. he was a nut job. faggot, y'know, hated this country.}
<A>__{as andrews resumes eating his crabmeat louie with gusto, jim reaches over and grabs the fork in mid air.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{dean, i think we're having a communication problem. i know you know who clay bertrand is. now stop eating that damn crabmeat for a minute and listen.}
<P>__{(gets dean's attention)}
<D>__{i'm aware of our long friendship, but i want you to know i'm going to call you in front of a grand jury. i took nine judges on, deano, right here in new orleans, and i beat 'em all. if you lie to the grand jury as you've been lying to me, i'm going to charge you with perjury. now, am i communicating with you?}
<A>__{andrews puts down the fork, shaken, silent for a moment.}
<C>__{andrews}
<D>__{is this off the record, daddy o?}
<P>__{(jim nods)}
<D>__{in that case, let me sum it up for you real quick. if i answer that question you keep asking me, if i give you the name of the "big enchilada", y'know, then it's bon voyage, deano i mean like permanent. i mean like a bullet in my head. you dig? does that help you see my problem a little better? you're a mouse fighting a gorilla. kennedy's dead as that crab meat. the government's still breathing. you want to line up with a dead man?}
<A>__{at a nearby table, a waiter has just poured brandy on crepe suzettes. a blue flame hovers in the air as jim leans forward across the table, speaking deliberately.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{read my lips, deano. either you dance into the grand jury with the real identity of clay bertrand or your fat behind is going to the slammer. do you dig me?}
<A>__{andrews stands suddenly.}
<C>__{andrews}
<D>__{you're just as crazy as your mama. goes to show it's in the genes! do you have any idea what you're getting into, my man? you think jack ruby just up and died of cancer in four weeks after he gets a retrial? that's some kinda new cancer i'd say that's a "going out of business cancer". you got the right ta ta, but the wrong ho ho. the government's gonna jump all over your head, jimbo, and go "cock a doodledoo!"}
