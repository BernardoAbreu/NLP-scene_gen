<L>__{exterior looks twice house night}
<A>__{the front door creaks open, and the subject dashes back out. in the dark we cannot latch onto features. suddenly the junker van comes alive, guns onto the dirt road, racing toward the running indian who gets the door of the truck open but freezes in the van's highbeams as ray leaps out, m 16 in hand.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{fbi, freeze, motherfucker drop it, drop it!}
<A>__{ray maneuvers in quantico fashion, keeping the rifle on the indian's back. the indian drops what he's holding. and turns around. it's not a he. we've seen her before. at the powwow. maggie eagle bear. her hair is pulled back tight, braided. ray moves in toward her, surprised at first, but still cautious}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{turn around, put your hands on the roof of the truck.}
<A>__{she does what he tells her. as ray moves in on her, he notices an indian child sitting in the passenger seat, looking out into the highbeams, frightened. ray toes maggie's legs out wider, frisks her one handed, pats down her boots.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{you're the indian fbi.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{that's right. turn around.}
<A>__{maggie turns around, looks ray in the eye. he looks self conscious in the cowboy hat.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{the people are glad they sent you. they usually send in guys who come at ya with highbeams, screamin' "drop it, motherfucker", stick a gun in your face, frisk ya down. even if ya got a child with ya. no, it's good to have ya. it's gonna be was te times on the res.}
<A>__{ray is looking down at what she dropped. a bundle lying in the grass. he bends down, starts to untie it.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{i was gonna warn ya about messin' with somebody's medicine bundle but i forgot you know all about that stuff.}
<A>__{in the bundle an eagle skull, tobacco strings, sage, sweet grass, and several white eagle feathers.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{this jimmy's?}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{you're not gonna catch him. he can shape shift into different animals. bear. elk. porcupine.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{is that like an hereditary thing, magdelana, or can one take classes?}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{jimmy didn't kill leo. why do you wanna do this?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{he tried to kill him twice before. that's a good place to start don't ya think? leo was on the other side, wasn't he?}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{ leo was an apple, that's right. red on the outside, white on the inside. and jimmy hated him. kicked his ass a coupla times. but he didn't kill him.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{who did?}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{you're the fbi. that's your job, isn't it? ya know how many of our warrior brothers got killed out here? i never saw any investigating then. why now? what's going down here?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{a fugitive alert for a murder suspect. before somebody else gets a shotgun blast in the spine.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{try the fort laramie treaty. all over again.}
<A>__{ray doesn't have a clue as to what this radical bullshit is about.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{look. you and i can stand here in a culture clash til the sun comes up, talking about what's right and what's wrong. you're from the reservation. it's a different world.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{i'm from minneapolis. fifth street. i did four years at dartmouth before i ever set foot on this res. so i know about the other world, ray.}
<A>__{if this information doesn't throw ray, the use of his first name does.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{are you gonna keep that medicine bundle or are you gonna respect its power?}
<A>__{ray is holding the medicine bundle. he deliberates, then hands it over. she takes it with careful hands, casting a somewhat surprised look up at him.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{when you see jimmy, tell him the sooner he turns himself back into a human being and gives himself in... the sooner we back off this reservation. okay?}
<A>__{maggie gets in the truck, starts it up. she looks out at him, studying him. trying to figure him out. headlights are coming fast from down the main road.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{grandpa reaches says you come from heavy indian blood. i used to think grandpa was gettin' senile. now i know he is.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{move it, magdelana.}
<A>__{maggie drives forward, turning down another little wagon road, and bumping into the black night only moments before, cooch's le baron pulls in. sa miles and sherman's vehicle pull in behind it. the regional feds fall in behind cooch, everyone, packing rifles.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{ray, you alright?}
<A>__{ray turns, nodding. an fbi van pulls in from the other direction and four agents empty out, wearing fbi windbreakers and heavily armed.}
<C>__{agent sherman}
<D>__{what do we got, ray?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{it was just eagle bear. i questioned and released her.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{what'd she say?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{she talks a lot of shit. we're not doing our job. jimmy's innocent. "what's the fbi really doing here." some shit about the fort laramie treaty.}
<A>__{cooch nods. the agents form a tight unit out below the upside down flag.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{she took something from the house. what she called a medicine bundle. most likely jimmy's.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{let's see it.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i gave it back to her.}
<C>__{agent sherman}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{if it is jimmy's, she's taking it to him. we'll have a runner. but i borrowed a little mojo...}
<A>__{ray reaches inside his pant leg, down around his boot and carefully removes a white eagle feather. he gingerly tucks it in a plastic bag.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{way to go, raymond. miles, take that to lab. sherman, i want you to go back to base and produce some written material. something that indicates that our girl maggie is leaking information to us. and make sure that material finds its way into the hands of the warrior movement.}
<A>__{sherman and miles, take off. cooch, an impressive master of cointelpro, now turns to the van squad.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{you gentlemen missed that medicine basket. go back through the house, and make sure you missed nothing else. and lay some wire, too. let's do it.}
<A>__{the van squad moves toward the house, leaving cooch and ray alone in the highbeams that light the yard.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{that's good goddamn work, ray. let the salmon run. let 'em run upriver.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{why we setting eagle bear up as an informant?}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{her own people start to suspect her, it creates discord from within. the warriors don't know who to trust, they start infighting, and jimmy loses his support.}
<A>__{ray nods, impressed. cooch bends down near the road, touches the dirt.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{her oil pan is shot.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{cooch. what's the fort laramie treaty?}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{jesus, i don't know. you tell me. you're the indian.}
<A>__{cooch wipes the oil on a handkerchief as he rises, smiling playfully at ray. he starts back toward his car. some sort of bird is cooing in the night.}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{get a tail on her, ray.}
<A>__{ray looks up at the upside down flag. then watches cooch walking way.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{cooch.}
<P>__{(a quiet, tired laugh)}
<D>__{where the fuck did they send us?}
<C>__{cooch}
<D>__{a long way from home. you be careful out there.}
<A>__{cooch, standing there with his glasses on and his right arm bandaged, looks tired, too. he gets in his car. in the yard, ray starts for the van, the res dog, trying to follow. he chases it away. and then as he gets closer to the van, he looks up to investigate the cooing sound.}
<B>__{at the top of the flag pole}
<A>__{there is a shadow. what looks to be a large bird. it just hovers. in the shadows.}
<B>__{down below}
<A>__{ray looks up at the pole, watching. then walking on.}
