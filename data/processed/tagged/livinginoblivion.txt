<C>__{shooting draft}
<A>__{a battered 35mm movie camera stands alone on a wooden tripod surrounded by blackness. opening credits begin. an almost imperceptible dolly in toward the movie camera. the dolly forward continues throughout the credits ending in an extreme cu of the camera's lens, filling the frame like a giant, glass full moon. fade to black. suddenly a door opens directly in front of the camera, wiping the lens and revealing the following scene in black and white.}
<L>__{exterior street. nyc. night}
<A>__{a quiet, deserted industrial street. it is over an hour before dawn and the street is still cloaked in the heavy stillness of night. in the weak light filtering out of their battered van, bert and cybil the craft service managers, finish setting out breakfast supplies on a 6' table. they work in almost complete silence, both nearly paralyzed with sleep. a cheap walkie talkie, lying beside a paper plate of soggy oreos, sputters and buzzes occasionally. other items on the table include a mangled banana, seven grapes, and a box of chocolate covered donuts.}

<C>__{cybil}
<D>__{i don't know. you're the one who said it was bad.}
<A>__{at that moment a large truck grinds around the corner and shudders to a stop in front of the building. bert replaces the carton of milk neatly beside the orange juice.}
<L>__{exterior street. nyc. night. b w}
<A>__{amid low, one word greetings, the crew tumbles out of the trucks and stands in a groggy cluster around the craft service table. wolf the cameraman, assumes a place of prominence. he wears a black leather coat, a black beret, and black leather half fingered gloves.}

<C>__{wolf}

<A>__{she means it. cora glances up at her, seeing for the first time how pain and defeat have drawn the life from nicole's face. on an impulse cora reaches out and gently lifts a strand of nicole's hair from her eyes. a sudden amazed alarm fills nicole. the living room grows strangely quiet.}

<D>__{and action on the run through.}
<L>__{interior set apt. day. b w}
<A>__{ws, the living room set. nick, wanda, the rest of the crew standing quietly. nicole glances over at cora and instantly something unspoken and unexplained passes between them. the run through begins. from the moment nicole opens her mouth it is obvious there has been a remarkable change in her. every word now has the stunning clarity of truth. cora is completely engulfed in the moment.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{dad hit me first and knocked me down. it didn't hurt that much but i started crying anyway, hoping he would leave me alone. he went over and started hitting danny.}

<D>__{god...}
<P>__{(this is not a sigh of relief)}
<A>__{the camera dollies swiftly back away from nick. he stares at it in stunned amazement. just then a door closes right into the lens turning the frame into complete blackness. out of the blackness a door opens away from the camera revealing wanda looking into her closet (the camera is inside the closet). from this point on, the rest of the film is in color except where specifically indicated to be black and white.}

<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{listen, wolf, having chad palomino in this movie will benefit us all. if being there when he checks into his hotel makes him feel better, then i'm happy to do it.}

<C>__{wanda}

<D>__{that's an anxiety dream. are you anxious about something?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i don't know. sometimes i wonder what the hell i'm doing in this business. it's all just one compromise and disappointment after another. i don't know if i have the personality for it.}

<D>__{chad, how would you describe this scene, in one word?}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{great. it's a great scene, man.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{no, i mean it's a love scene. right?}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{definitely.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{these two people really love each other. and we want to see that, especially in the kiss.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{hey, say no more, chief.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{nicole?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i understand, chief.}

<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i've always admired you from afar.}
<A>__{palomino moves immediately to the bed, changing his blocking and causing the camera crew and nicole considerable confusion.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{admired? that sounds rather professional.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{well, then: loved. how does that sound?}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{it sounds like the champagne talking.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i've loved you from the moment we met.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{why didn't you tell me?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{we were working together. i didn't want anything to interfere.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{god. and all this time i thought...}
<A>__{the scene once again is awful. nick gives their listless kiss a few moments then calls cut.}
<L>__{interior the set. day}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{and, cut. very good. wolf?}
<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{chad missed his cue again; the whole dolly is unusable.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{yeah, chad. what happened; i thought you were going to hold back till "me"?}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{the more i thought about it the more it didn't seem right. and i'm thinking, watch me here, instead of coming around the bed, what if i just slip here like this and do the whole scene lying down?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i don't know, that seems a little...}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{hey, i'm just throwing out ideas here. trying to get the juices flowing.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{nicole, how does that feel to you?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{well, i can turn to look at him. but won't you be shooting the back of my head?}
<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{plus chad is completely out of the light down there.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{hey, wolf; i'm not worried about my face, man. it's about the acting; that's all i care about.}
<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{it's your call, nick. his acting or his face.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{for some reason i was hoping we could get both.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i thought that's what we were trying to do here.}
<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{i will have to set another light.}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{we're ahead of schedule, nick. i think we can afford a few minutes to set a light for mr. palomino.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{good, let's do it. ellen, damian; let's talk for a second.}
<A>__{as nick, nicole, and palomino step off the set wanda speaks to the crew in general.}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{we'll pause to set this light and go again right away. how long, wolf?}
<A>__{wolf doesn't answer, though he stands a mere foot away, watching the gaffer set up a light.}

<L>__{interior a corner. day}
<A>__{nick, palomino, and nicole confer, all three smoking.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{ok, let's make sure we know what's going on here. these two people have loved each other for years, each of them not knowing the other was in love with them. and tonight, in this little room it all comes out. it's like a dam bursting. does that make sense? nicole?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{it makes perfect sense. i just haven't found it yet. i will get it though.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what about you, chad?}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{i'm there, man. i got the dam going, the river, everything. you watch, that little change in the blocking is going to open the whole scene up for me.}
<C>__{wanda }

<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i know, i'm sorry. but this feels really awkward; turning all the way around like this.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{yeah, i think the lying on the bed is not quite working, chad. let's try one with the original blocking.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{which one was that? there's been so many damn changes. could somebody help me out please?}
<C>__{script}
<D>__{the cue for the original blocking is "professional."}
<C>__{palomino}
<P>__{(intimate)}
<D>__{thank you. thank you very much.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{ok, right away. call it, wanda.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{nick? could i just have a moment? is that alright?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{of course, nicole; are you kidding? hold the roll, wanda.}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{holding the roll!}
<A>__{nicole remains seated on the bed, lowering her head and closing her eyes as she attempts to generate some emotion for the scene. everyone watches her in complete silence.}
<L>__{interior near the camera. day}
<A>__{palomino tiptoes over to the camera where wanda and the scriptgirl are standing side by side. as he leans between them, checking his lines on the scriptgirl's script, he inhales deeply then exhales with a barely audible sigh.}
<C>__{palomino}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{someone over here smells very, very nice.}
<A>__{thinking he means her, wanda's lips flutter in a brief, involuntary smile. meanwhile, the scriptgirl turns away, blushing furiously.}
<L>__{interior the set. day}
<A>__{palomino tiptoes again back to his spot. nicole raises her head and nods once to nick. she seems to have aroused some real emotion in herself.}

<D>__{hold the roll!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what is it, chad?}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{just stop me if i'm out of line here, but she says "admired from afar," right? doesn't it make sense to see damian up close and her "afar?" you start on a close up of damian, watch me here; as she declares her love, the camera moves with me into this primo two shot that you and the wolfmeister have set up here.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what do you think, wolf?}
<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{i don't like it. this is ellen's scene.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i don't know; it sort of makes sense.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{hey, you did it, man. it's all there in the writing.}
<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{i'd have to relight.}
<A>__{nick pauses, thinking hard.}

<D>__{we're still ahead of schedule, nick; if that means anything to you.}

<P>__{(to the gaffer)}
<D>__{get me a tweenie right here, with diffusion.}

<D>__{get the fucking light!}
<L>__{interior craft service table. day}
<A>__{several members of the crew loiter around the table. the scriptgirl approaches carrying a donut in one hand and a cup of coffee in the other. palomino notices her and moves quietly to her side. without a word he picks up the milk and pours some in her coffee. nicole stands nearby and watches the following exchange.}
<C>__{script}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{my pleasure. sugar?}
<C>__{script}
<D>__{just a bit.}

<D>__{very much.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{maybe we could go hear some tonight.}

<D>__{yo, wolfman. is this my new mark?}
<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{until you change it. where's my fucking eyepatch?!}
<A>__{wolf walks off. the gaffer slips the ac a shrewd wink then walks over and stands next to palomino, giving him a big, friendly grin.}

<D>__{maurice.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{maurice! hey, maurice chevalier! any relation? probably not. hey, smoking crew guys, really.}
<A>__{the gaffer slips his own script out of his back pocket and begins leafing through it.}
<C>__{gaffer}
<D>__{hey thanks, chad. actually i wrote a script.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{oh, yeah?}
<A>__{palomino takes the gaffer's script and holds it up to his eyes, shading them from a light he's looking at across the room. he points to the light.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{hey, bill. see that light over there?}
<C>__{gaffer}
<D>__{uh, yeah.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{lower it about three feet.}
<A>__{palomino hands the gaffer back his script and walks off. the gaffer and ac stand in silence for a long awkward moment.}
<L>__{interior bathroom. day}
<A>__{nick intently scrutinizes himself in the mirror. leaning closer he makes a careful adjustment to the way his hair falls over his ear, then steps back to examine himself.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{would you care to have a drink tonight? hey, nicole, what do you say you and i have a drink tonight?}
<A>__{suddenly the door opens behind him and nicole walks in.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{oh, nick! i'm sorry!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{that's ok, no problem. i'm just slapping a little water on my face.}
<A>__{the two stand in embarrassed silence for a moment. nick looks like he's gathering the nerve to ask her out.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{so, it's going pretty good, huh?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{is it? something feels off.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{yeah, you seem a little tense.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{do i?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{but don't worry about it. just take your attention off yourself and put it on chad. work off him a little more.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{ok, i will try that.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{and listen, i know he's no olivier. but he's got something, don't you think? kind of a natural presence.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{oh yes, he's very natural.}
<A>__{nick hesitates, again gathering his nerves to pop the question.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{so nicole... anything else i can help you with?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{actually there is. could you maybe ask him to brush his teeth?}

<D>__{put your eyepatch on.}
<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{i lost it.}

<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{hey, you're not worried about the time, i'm not worried about the time.}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{oh, i am very worried about the time!}
<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{i know you are.}

<D>__{what do you think it means?!}

<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{you don't understand me, wanda! you have no idea }
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{i don't understand you?!! all i do is take care of you!!!}
<A>__{nick suddenly runs up just as wolf and wanda are on the verge of blows.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{hey, hey, hey! what the hell's going on here?! jesus, wanda. this is a very intimate scene and a lot of tension on the set doesn't help. ok? now, wolf, let's just go through the first part of the move. damian, on your new mark. good. close up, damian; ellen in the background.}
<A>__{nick suddenly sees palomino is wearing a black eyepatch.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{chad, what are you doing?}
<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{hey, that's my fucking eyepatch.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{wolf, could i borrow it? cause i'm telling you, nick; it really feels right. i feel like this guy now, man.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i don't know, chad. i don't think it works.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{you're wrong, man. i'm going to fight you on this one.}
<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{hey, it's my fucking eyepatch and i don't want anyone wearing it. it's insanitary.}
<A>__{palomino removes the eyepatch and tosses it back to wolf.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{fine. i will get my own. nick, send someone out for an eyepatch. i will fucking pay for it myself.}
<A>__{nick pulls palomino aside and whispers to him confidentially.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{listen, chad. i didn't want to say this in front of wolf but it makes you look a little... gay.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{really?}

<D>__{yeah, a little bit.}
<C>__{palomino}

<D>__{admired? that sounds rather professional.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{well, then: loved. how does that sound?}
<A>__{right on his cue, palomino walks to the bed. as the camera moves into the 2 shot he begins stroking nicole's hair with extreme care and concentration.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{it sounds like the champagne talking.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i've loved you from the moment we met.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{why didn't you tell me?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{we were working together. i didn't want anything to interfere god!}

<D>__{that's a cut. hold the work, going again, right away.}

<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{nick, could i talk to you a second?}
<A>__{palomino disappears behind the set, a jerk of his head indicating his wish for nick to follow him.}

<D>__{excuse me, ellen? you were a tad low on that take.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{oh, ok. i will bring it up. actually could i listen to the take before?}

<L>__{interior off the set. day}
<A>__{nick follows palomino behind the set, stopping just beside the fake set window. palomino whirls on nick and whispers fiercely.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{i'm out of here, man!}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what's the matter?!}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{i like you, but i made a big mistake taking this part. have someone call me a cab.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{wait a second, chad. just talk to me. what's going on!?}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{i can't act with this woman. i know she's a friend of yours but i got to tell you: she cannot act worth a shit! i'm giving her everything! the whole thing i just did with the hair; did you see that? i came up with that on my own because i thought it would help her. but no, she's giving me nothing! i'm out of here.}

<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{god, and all this time i thought...}
<P>__{(the muted rustle of the kiss)}
<A>__{the sound man stops the recorder at the end of the take, sets the machine in standby mode, and picks up his crossword puzzle. nicole is just about to take off the headphones when she realizes she can hear nick and palomino talking quite clearly. glancing up, she sees the boom man has left his boom leaning against the wall, the mike pointing out the open set window.}
<C>__{palomino }
<D>__{why did you cast her? she sucked in that richard gere movie!}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{you're right. she is not the best actress in the world. i see that now but you've got to help me, chad. i'm asking you to please help me here. we've got to get through this somehow.}
<A>__{the camera begins a slow dolly in to nicole's astonished face. this will be intercut with a similar dolly in to the microphone leaning against the wall, ending in an ecu of the mike.}
<L>__{interior off the set. day}
<A>__{camera is close on nick and palomino.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{i will tell you what this is about, man. you know why she took a cab this morning?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{something came up.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{no. she was in my hotel room and she didn't want you to know it. ok? i'm sorry it had to come out like this but i told her this morning "thanks a lot, it was a lot of fun last night but let's get something straight it was just a one time deal," and she didn't want to hear that. she wanted more, you see what i'm saying? it's rejection.}
<L>__{interior the set. day}

<C>__{nick}
<D>__{nicole, listen...}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{nick, it's my fault the scene isn't working. i apologize. chad, i apologize to you too. i'm completely unfocused here and i think you're absolutely right; what we need to do is loosen the scene up somehow.}
<A>__{nick and palomino stare at nicole for a moment.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what would you like to do?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i was wondering if we could try improvising the scene. more along the lines of what chad has been doing. maybe that would help me find something.}
<A>__{nick's smile of gratitude to nicole looks almost drug induced.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{that's a fantastic idea. what do you think, chad?}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{hey, that's the only way i can work. let's take it apart, let's cut loose.}

<D>__{well, i am surprised you feel this way, ellen. i always thought you admired }
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{that's not what i meant. you should tell everyone what you just told nick behind the set.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{hey, this isn't part of the scene.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{say it anyway: the reason this scene isn't working is because you and i slept together last night. did everyone hear that?! i fucked chad last night!}

<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{see, nick! i told you this was about rejection!}

<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{you know, you are really starting to piss me off!}

<D>__{oh, does that mean you're not going to come wiggle on the bed anymore, or stroke my hair real soft and concerned, or kiss me like a soap opera acting piece of shit!}

<D>__{now wait a second, chad. there's no reason for hostility.}
<C>__{palomino}
<D>__{shut up, you fucking loser. the only reason i took this part was because someone said you knew quentin tarantino! you're nowhere, man.}

<D>__{you hostess twinkie motherfucker!}
<A>__{palomino suddenly punches nick in the stomach, leaving him bent over and gasping for breath. nicole instantly leaps on palomino's back and begins pounding her fist on the top of his head. palomino spins wildly trying to dislodge her as wanda rushes forward.}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{alright, everyone just stop. stop! stop this right now!}
<A>__{as she tries to separate nicole and palomino, palomino shoves her hard, knocking her down. instantly wolf leaps off the camera and runs up to palomino.}

<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you want to pick my brain?! this is the way i direct hostess twinkie scumbags like you!}
<A>__{as nick continues to pound palomino's head the gaffer notices palomino's eyes are starting to bug out from the pressure of nick's forearm around his neck. he and the boom man rush forward and finally manage to pry palomino free.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{get him out of here! someone take him back to his hotel!}
<A>__{as the gaffer and boom man drag off the almost unconscious palomino, the scriptgirl takes one faltering step after him.}

<P>__{(sniffling)}
<D>__{chad...}
<A>__{suddenly, everything becomes quiet except for nick's labored breathing and the scriptgirl's sniffles. nick leans over and touches nicole's shoulder.}

<D>__{are you alright?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{don't touch me.}
<L>__{exterior day. the street outside the set}
<A>__{the gaffer and ac help the still groggy palomino into the back of the production van. jeff, the driver, watches them in sleepy curiosity. with palomino safely propped in a seat, the ac goes back to the set. the gaffer waits a moment then slips his script out of his back pocket and slaps it into palomino's motionless hand.}
<C>__{gaffer}
<D>__{it's called "tsunami." a japanese tidal wave hits new york. you've an ex navy s.e.a l. frogman, working undercover. you save the city. you'd be perfect for the lead. that's my number; call me, or i will call you. either way it's been great working with you, man.}

<D>__{it's about you. it's about how i feel about you.}
<C>__{nicole}

<C>__{nick}
<D>__{nicole. i've loved you since the day we met.}
<A>__{nicole sits for a long moment in stunned silence.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{why didn't you tell me?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i didn't want anything to get in the way of us working together.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{god, and all this time i thought...}
<A>__{nick and nicole move into a shy, trembling, heartfelt kiss.}
<L>__{interior hotel room. dawn}
<A>__{nicole snaps awake with a jolt. she glances quickly at the clock which reads 4:35. the sound of the shower still running in the bathroom.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{oh, god.}
<A>__{nicole leaps out of bed and races into the bathroom. as the camera follows her, she closes the bathroom door, right against the lens, turning the image to total blackness. the frame is black. the recognizable clatter and clunk of the film crew is heard. wanda's voice is prominent.}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{don't go out that door!}
<A>__{suddenly a door opens away from camera and the ac stops, a foot away from the lens. behind him, wanda and the rest of the crew can be seen through the door, preparing for filming. we see now the door and the plywood walls around it are fake.}

<L>__{interior set building, hallway. day}
<A>__{the ac bursts through a door at the end of the hallway and walks quickly toward the camera. without knocking he pushes open the bathroom door and suddenly stops short.}
<C>__{ac}
<D>__{oh. sorry.}
<A>__{standing on his tiptoes at the sink, straining to turn off the running faucet is, tito a dwarf. he is dressed in a sky blue tuxedo with tails. a top hat and white gloves rest on the closed toilet seat. tito appears extremely annoyed.}
<C>__{tito}
<D>__{what do you want?!}
<C>__{ac}
<D>__{i need to use the bathroom. kind of an emergency.}
<C>__{tito}
<D>__{well, fucking knock!!}
<A>__{tito grabs his hat and gloves and marches down the hall, the ac staring after him in astonishment.}

<L>__{interior wardrobe room. day}
<A>__{camera is close on nicole, her eyes clenched shut as a thin white veil is placed on her head. camera pulls back to reveal sachiko, the costume designer putting the finishing touches to nicole's costume, which appears to be an elaborate white wedding gown. nick stands nearby, smoking.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{just as we pull up to your apartment palomino suddenly says he feels so sick he can't work today.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{god. was it something he ate?}
<C>__{sachiko}
<D>__{stand up, please.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i don't know.}

<D>__{can he work tomorrow?}
<C>__{sachiko}
<D>__{turn around, please.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{don't know that either. but i'm not worrying about it. i had this dream last night where i was on the set. you were in it, and another woman, someone older. anyway, everything was going wrong. the harder i tried to hold things together the more they fell apart. and you know what that dream was telling me, nicole? you just got to roll with it. and that's what i'm doing, i'm rolling with it. so, we'll just shoot the dream sequence today.}
<A>__{just then tito walks in.}

<C>__{tito}
<D>__{put a stool in the bathroom.}
<A>__{tito walks out, followed immediately by sachiko, leaving nicole alone with nick.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{did i just offend him?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{"short notice?"}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{come on; that was nothing. i'm the one who called him "toto." jesus, i'm out of it. i dreamt i was on the set last night too.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{oh yeah?}

<L>__{interior a corner of the set. day}

<D>__{alright, guys; special effects today. could be fun. who knows how to work this baby?}
<C>__{gaffer}
<D>__{it's the old t 160. i used it once in '85.}

<D>__{you're right. it's coming back now.}
<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{i'm going to let you handle this one, bob. this is your baby. and les, if he needs help you give him a hand. ok, guys? we're all working together today.}

<C>__{nick}
<D>__{how are we doing, wanda?}
<C>__{wanda}
<D>__{not good, nick. not bad, but not good. we need to finish this scene and do scene thirty one today.}

<C>__{wolf}
<D>__{we're all lit, the smoke machine is under control; we're ready to go.}
<C>__{wanda}
<P>__{(hard)}
<D>__{what about the dolly?}
