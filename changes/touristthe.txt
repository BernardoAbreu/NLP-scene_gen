<ACTION>__{CRANE DOWN from a view of Paris on a misty day.   Cool, gray and beautiful. A taxi stops by the curb of a wide, cobbled street. All around there is bustle and activity, with cars and people hurrying about their business. The door opens and a pair of exquisitely shaped female legs in Christian Louboutin high heels swing out.}

Her gaze comes to rest on a WELL-DRESSED FRENCH MAN. Medium height, medium build. Standing alone. Examining his ticket. Cara glances at her reflection critically in the polished glass window of the train. Adjusts her hair and dress. Satisfied with what she sees, she turns and starts toward the WELL-DRESSED FRENCH MAN like a cat stalking prey. The CAMERA admiringly FOLLOWS her silky approach. The FRENCH MAN hears the click of her heels and looks up. His mouth falls open... HIS WIFE arrives and shuts it for him.}

Frank looks vaguely out of place, sitting by the window in his casual jeans and pullover sweater. He's wrapped up in a dog-eared paperback spy novel. So wrapped up that he barely notices Cara sit down opposite him. She crosses her legs.   He glances up. Slowly, nonchalantly, she takes her coat off.   Then the headscarf tied around her neck. FOLLOW her sensual movements in TIGHT CLOSE UP. The effect is as if she's performing a tantalizing strip tease. Frank is captivated to the point of being unsettled. She takes off her glasses to reveal stunning eyes. She goes to remove her mock-turtleneck sweater.   The zipper seems to give her trouble.

The zipper keeps going downward. No sign of anything underneath. Frank is practically sweating. Finally he uncovers fabric. He finishes unzipping the sweater and sits back into his seat. Cara slides it off her shoulders, sensuous as ever.}

His body hits the ground next to Frank... his gun skitters across the floor. Demidov looks from the window to Cara with cold fury in his eyes-- she's the one who has called in the artillery. He raises his pistol toward her, point blank. BANG!    The gunshot takes him by surprise.   He turns to see... FRANK holds Scarface's smoking pistol in his hand. Demidov just has time to process the fact that Frank is the one who shot him before the life drains from his eyes and he topples... Demidov's other bodyguard fires out the windows wildly and makes a run for it. Glass flies everywhere. Frank throws his body over Cara to protect her. A short and furious exchange of gunfire as the other plate glass windows explode. Wood splinters fill the air as furniture is torn apart. Finally... One of the sniper's bullets finds its target and the BODYGUARD goes down. Frank remains on top of Cara, shielding her until long after everything has fallen silent.}

Frank crawls across the room and presses a hidden latch on a built-in bookshelf. It swings out of the way to reveal a hidden safe built into the floor. Frank removes the fitted floor boards. There is a sophisticated BIO-METRIC LOCK -- just like the one at the gate in the beginning of the movie. Frank places his finger on the spot and the lock clicks open.}
