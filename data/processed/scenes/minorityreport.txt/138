<L>__{interior room the sprawl night}
<A>__{a small, dreary room, invisible with insignificance. which is just the kind of room you want if you've stolen a precog. the female precog lies on a cot. anderson sits on a metal folding chair watching her. her eyes slowly open and look at him}
<C>__{female}
<D>__{my brothers aren't here.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{you didn't even look around. you knew.}
<C>__{female}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we can sense each other. you must save}
<A>__{anderson cuts her off with a curt shake of his head}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{stop. i saved you. it was the best i could do.}
<A>__{she turns away and looks at the yellowing paper on the wall. there is a fading pink cabbage rose. she traces the outline of it with her thin finger. she turns back to him.}
<C>__{female}
<D>__{thank you, anderson.}
<A>__{it is deeply eerie for him, chatting with a precog.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{what am i going to do with you?}
<A>__{her eyes grow very serious.}
<C>__{female}
<D>__{name me, anderson.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{female}
<D>__{give me a name. i've never had one.}
<A>__{anderson rises, moves around the small room. he is shamed, embarrassed.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{listen.}
<A>__{she turns to the wall.}
<C>__{anderson }
<D>__{listen to me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{listen to me ... rose.}
<A>__{it is heartrendingly touching, the smile she gives him when she faces him again.}
<C>__{female}
<D>__{rose.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{rose. they shifted your precognition so you would locate me.}
<C>__{rose}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{yes. and it hurt us, physically. did you know that? the helmets, the controls. it hurts.}
<C>__{anderson}
<P>__{(guiltily)}
<D>__{i didn't know.}
<A>__{for a long moment he can't say anything. but there are things he needs to understand ...}
<C>__{anderson }
<D>__{when they shifted you to find me, you didn't reveal everything. that i was going to break into precrime.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{we saw our chance. you would need to shut us down, you would have to come. we wanted you to come.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{you used me to save you. rose i have been used all my life, anderson.}
<A>__{anderson can't meet her eyes.}
<C>__{rose }
<D>__{no one cared that we were human. from a human mother. taken at birth. hooked to machines.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{we have been alive, anderson. enslaved, for the greater good.}
<A>__{her words are unbearable, for both of them. she traces the outline of the wallpaper rose again.}
<C>__{rose }
<D>__{but now i have a name. and i know the man who has named me will not allow me to be enslaved again.}
<A>__{anderson looks at her, then goes to the window, carefully watches the street below.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{rose. what's going to happen to us? can you see that?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i'm weak. and away from my brothers. i see glimpses and hints of things nearby. but it's all ... scattered.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm tired of the future, anderson.}
<A>__{she lies on the bed, watching as anderson comes back to her. he sits carefully on the side of her bed. then be reaches out, and gently touches her cheek}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{you didn't know i was going to do that, did you?}
<A>__{she is almost too overwhelmed to speak}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{no. oh, anderson. it was lovely.}
<A>__{and now it is anderson who is overwhelmed}
