<L>__{interior kitchen day}
<A>__{brendan sits at a breakfast table eating cornflakes. the kitchen is on the first floor of the pin's house, or rather the pin's mother's house. she is a soft old lady in a pastel cotton dress, currently bent over the fridge mumbling.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{i thought we had orange juice, brendan, i'm sorry. how about tang, or that's more like soda isn't it, or not soda but it hasn't got any juice in it, it can't be very fortifying.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{water's fine, ma'am, thanks.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{now just a moment, we have apple juice here, if you'd like that, or milk, though you've got that in your cornflakes, i don't know if drinking it as well might be too much.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{apple juice sounds terrific.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{it's country style.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{that's perfect.}
<A>__{she shuts the fridge. tugger and the pin sit behind her, looking comfortably bored. the pin, a sharp black hole against the soft yellow kitchen, eats oatmeal cookies with small delicate bites.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{i will even give it to you in a country glass, how'd that be? boys?}
<C>__{tugger}
<D>__{i'm fine, mrs. m.}
<C>__{pin}
<D>__{thanks, mom.}
<A>__{the pin kisses her on the cheek.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{okay, well i'm going to go, um, do something in the other room now...}
<A>__{she shuffles out.}
<C>__{pin}
<P>__{(to brendan)}
<D>__{so hows bout we take another snap at hearing your tale?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i don't know. it starts out same as before, and this floor ain't carpeted.}
<C>__{pin}
<D>__{we're cooled off.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{yeah well, your muscle seemed plenty cool putting his fist in my head. i want him out.}
<A>__{the pin grins thinly, uncomfortable.}
<C>__{pin}
<D>__{looky, soldier }
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{the ape blows or i clam.}
<C>__{tugger}
<P>__{(stands violently)}
<D>__{so clam! what've you got i can't beat out of you back in the basement?}
<A>__{the pin and brendan are perfectly still, watching each other.}
<C>__{pin}
<D>__{give us a few minutes, tug.}
<A>__{tug turns to him, but pin keeps his eyes on brendan.}
<C>__{pin }
<D>__{i will call you if whatever.}
<A>__{beat. tug stomps off, slamming the narrow door hard behind him. the pin goes back to gnawing his cookie.}
<C>__{pin }
<D>__{so?}
<A>__{brendan sets down his spoon.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{about a year ago i had a small time dealing partnership with jerr madison. know him?}
<C>__{pin}
<D>__{till he took the fall for you.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{yeah well. i didn't ask him to, but he was a straight player. i got out clean almost. nothing on my official record, but the vps play it like i owe them one. when i made it clear i wasn't playing their hound dog, well they didn't like it. they keep calling me in, badgering me.}
<C>__{pin}
<D>__{gee that's tough.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{i don't like being told whose side i'm on. so now they think i'm on your trail, i'm in a nice spot to know their movements and feed them yours.}
<C>__{pin}
<D>__{i gotcha.}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{you haven't got me yet.}
<C>__{pin}
<D>__{what, price?}
<C>__{brendan}
<D>__{considering the benefits my services could yield, i don't think that's unreasonable.}
<C>__{pin}
<D>__{and what are your services exactly, just so i can be specific on the invoice?}
<C>__{brendan}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{whatever serves your interests.}
<A>__{the pin stands.}
<C>__{pin}
<D>__{fair enough. i will have my boys check your tale, and seeing how it stretches we'll either rub or hire you. you'll know which by end of the day tomorrow.}
<A>__{brendan stands but doesn't follow as the pin opens the narrow door tugger went through and descends the dark stairs behind.}
<C>__{pin }
<D>__{we're done.}
<A>__{the moment the pin vanishes into the basement's murk laura comes up out of it. she takes brendan's hand.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i will drive you back.}
