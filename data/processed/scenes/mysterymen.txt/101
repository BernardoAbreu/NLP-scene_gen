<A>__{still climbing as he hears a scream, looks up... and sees anabel go plummeting past him. on our heroes down below.}
<C>__{bowler}
<D>__{heads up!}
<A>__{camera holds on our heroes, wincing as anabel hits with an ugly thud. suddenly they hear invisible boy calling to them.}
<C>__{invisible boy}
<D>__{guys, i did it! i did it! i'm invisible!}
<A>__{they all turn and see... invisible boy, totally visible, but standing on the other side of the arch.}
<C>__{invisible boy}
<D>__{can you see me?}
<C>__{all}
<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{invisible boy}
<D>__{nuts.}
<C>__{shoveler}
<D>__{kid, turn that thing off!}
<A>__{invisible boy turns and sees... a computer screen built into the wall (with the same image of the eye on it that was on casanova's computer), but he doesn't have a clue how to turn it off. suddenly, he hears running feet, turns and sees... the top crooks and the disco boys rushing towards him through the giant sculptures. he gets an idea... and stands right in front of the computer screen.}
<C>__{invisible boy}
<D>__{hey! creeps!}
<A>__{he makes a face at them and a dozen guns are instantly fired at him. he jumps clear behind a pillar as the bullets smash into the wall... one of them demolishing the computer screen. close on the eye as it goes dead. on invisible boy, hiding behind the pillar... realizing he's been shot in the shoulder. back on our heroes }
<C>__{shoveler}
<D>__{this is it! do or die!}
<A>__{the villains form a line, bristling with pistols... as our heroes, led by sphinx, shoveler, and bowler come running through the arch. the threesome go shoulder to shoulder (with our other heroes right behind them) as the villains open fire, laying down a deadly fusillade... on shoveler, bowler, and sphinx, standing together, deflecting their bullets with shovel, bowling ball, and machete... (as they practiced with pebbles at the farm)... with the raja right behind them, hurling silverware... on the villains, rapid firing... but their own bullets ricochet back into them, dropping them... they start to fall back. back to the top of the tower continuous casanova is about to finish monica.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{and the light goes out...}
<C>__{furious }
<D>__{frankenstein!}
<A>__{casanova turns and sees... furious, standing on the balcony.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{roy... what took you so long?}
<A>__{furious starts at casanova, who aims anabel's pistol at him. furious hesitates.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{let me guess... bullets don't hurt you.}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{they hurt... but they don't stop me!}
<A>__{furious lunges at casanova who gets off a shot before furious grabs the gun out of his hand. casanova ducks clear. furious tosses the pistol away... then realizes he's bleeding from a shoulder wound.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{smarts, doesn't it?... shall we dance?}
<A>__{he turns on his stereo and the sound of disco music fills the air...}
