<L>__{interior deejay booth}
<A>__{martin and debi locked in a passionate embrace. they break away.}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{sit.}
<A>__{martin obeys. debi clandestinely flips the "on air" switch as she drops into her chair. the "on air" light bar goes on above and behind martin. unbeknownst to him their conversation is put out over the airwaves.}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{all right mystery man. i want some answers. let's recap. spring of '84. two young lovers with frightening natural chemistry. the girl sits in a seven hundred dollar prom dress at her father's house waiting for the most romantic night of her young life. the boy never shows up, until now. so, what's the question?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{where have i been?}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{more like what happened? what happened, mr. blank?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{i don't know exactly. i could venture a guess but it would sound like a rationalization... i thought you know... maybe seeing you, some friends, my house... of course now a 7 11 }
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{ torn down in the name of convenience }
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{ and i guess, sure, seeing you would be part of that whole equation... i suppose the most important thing, really. i don't know. anyway, this whole thing's my therapist's idea. it's my shrink, really.}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{ohhh. you're in therapy too, marty?}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{you see someone?}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{uh, no. so you're back now, a decade later, and you want to sort things out with me. the question now is, do i allow you... access... to my being?}
<A>__{martin says nothing.}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{all right then. would you like to share any more deeply personal thoughts with our listening audience before we go to our phone poll and see how the folks in radioland come down on this one?}
<A>__{a beat as martin realizes he's been had. he seems about to bolt.}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{should a broken hearted girl give a guy a second chance at love....}
<A>__{debi jabs a phone line on the console.}
<C>__{debi}
<P>__{(hard)}
<D>__{you're on the air.}
<A>__{martin deflates.}
<C>__{old woman's voice}
<D>__{i think this young man has avoided the question completely. has not discussed "what happened" nor if he's sorry for what he has done. therefore, i don't see any reason why you should see him until he fully discloses his intentions and feelings.}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{thank you caller.}
<A>__{stabs another line.}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{you're on the air.}
<C>__{dumb guy voice}
<D>__{are you there?}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{dumb guy voice}
<D>__{no, the guy.}
<A>__{martin looks up, humiliated.}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{yeah....}
<C>__{dumb guy voice}
<D>__{uh... when you guys use to go out... did you guys ever... heh heh heh heh... ever fuckin', ever totally fuckin' heh heh heh }
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{next caller.}
<C>__{guff man voice}
<D>__{i don't know, debi. sounds like bad gas to me. i would not allow him access to your being.}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{grosse pointe michigan, i hear you loud and clear: "if you love something set it free. if it comes back to you it's, well...}
<A>__{she turns to him and shrugs apologetically.}
<C>__{debi}
<D>__{...broken...."}
<A>__{martin has his answer.}
