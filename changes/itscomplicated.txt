<DIAL>__{Oh. Well, anyway, it's better to say these things in person. Adam, the man I was seeing was...}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I think I'm up to speed on that part.}
<CHAR>__{JANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I want you to know it didn't last long and you're divorced, so maybe you understand, when marriages end, there's doubts and hurt, and you've got kids and sometimes you wonder if you did the right thing and when the moment presented itself...}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{-- I get it. I could imagine it...I could...}
<CHAR>__{JANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I told him it wasn't going to work between us but I guess he didn't believe me and unbeknownst to me, he showed up at my house yesterday. He left Agness and...}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{-- Jane. I actually think I understand what happened but...uh...you know I'm not as macho as I appear and I think it's probably best for us not to get any more... involved because your relationship with Jake isn't really done and I know you're saying it is, but he's in love with you and for everyone's sake, that should probably get resolved.}
<CHAR>__{JANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Wow.   So that's how grown ups talk.}
<ACTION>__{Adam smiles.}
<CHAR>__{JANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Please tell me you're not going to quit my job and ask Peter to take over because then I'll never get to see you and...}
<CHAR>__{ADAM} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I was thinking of asking Peter to step back in.}
<CHAR>__{JANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh... I hope you don't...}

<DIAL>__{Thanks.}

<LOC>__{EXT. ROAD TO JANE'S HOUSE - LATE DAY}
<ACTION>__{Jane drives home, when she notices Jake's Porsche in her driveway. She gets out of her car, finds Jake sitting on the bench swing hanging from a large oak in the front yard. Jane crosses to Jake. He moves over. Jane sees the humor in this gesture and sits on the swing with him, letting out a sigh. Side by side, they swing in the late afternoon breeze.}
<CHAR>__{JAKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm sorry.}
<ACTION>__{Jane doesn't answer right away.}
<CHAR>__{JANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How far back does that sorry go?}
<CHAR>__{JAKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How far back do you need it to go?}
<CHAR>__{JANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Way back.}
<CHAR>__{JAKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Consider it an all inclusive apology. From not being the husband you needed to showing up nude on your bed last night.}
<CHAR>__{JANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, what were you thinking with that move?}
<CHAR>__{JAKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That you'd find me irresistible.}
<ACTION>__{Jane turns to him, her eyes warming up to him.}
<CHAR>__{JAKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Never considered the alternative.}
<CHAR>__{JANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Gotta love that about you.}
<ACTION>__{They swing some more.}
<CHAR>__{JAKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, man, can't believe I got up to bat again and blew it.}
<CHAR>__{JANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You didn't blow it. We blew it. We blew it the first time around. This time... we just should've known better. Too much has happened. Too much time has passed.}
<CHAR>__{JAKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And you don't think we could make it right?}
<CHAR>__{JANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Does that mean you didn't feel it was totally right either?}
<CHAR>__{JAKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Being with you Jane is the best I'm gonna be.}
<CHAR>__{JANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But do you agree that it wasn't really...?}
<CHAR>__{JAKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It was complicated.}
<CHAR>__{JANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Begging for an answer.}
<CHAR>__{JAKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I thought it was good.   I wanted it to be good.}
<CHAR>__{JANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Guess that's as close as I'm gonna get.}
<CHAR>__{JAKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Do you always have to be so hard on me?}
<CHAR>__{JANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No.   I don't.}
<CHAR>__{JAKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't regret giving it another shot.}
<CHAR>__{JANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Probably would've been better if you hadn't been married.}
<CHAR>__{JAKE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It may never have happened if I wasn't married.}
<ACTION>__{Jane looks at Jake, knowing how true that is. They sit, side by side, as they sway in the breeze.}
<CHAR>__{JANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't regret it either.}

<ACTION>__{It's raining. Trucks are pulling into the driveway as lumber is being taken off of a truck and covered in tarps. Jane EXITS THE HOUSE in a parka and under an umbrella. A GROUP OF CONSTRUCTION GUYS ARE huddled under a make-shift tarp. Jane crosses toward them and as the group opens to face her she spots Adam, holding blue prints. Jane is stunned he's there.}

<CHAR>__{JANE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
