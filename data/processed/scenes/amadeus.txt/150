<C>__{old salieri}
<D>__{i'm sure i don't need to tell you i said nothing whatever to the emperor. i went to the theatre ready to tell mozart that his majesty had flown into a rage when i mentioned the ballet, when suddenly, to my astonishment, in the middle of the third act, the emperor who never attended rehearsals suddenly appeared.}
<L>__{interior opera house day 1780's}
<A>__{in the background the same recitativo before the march. the emperor steals in surreptitiously with von strack, his finger to his lips. he motions everyone not to rise, and slips into a chair behind salieri, orsini rosenberg and bonno. the three conspirators look at each other wide eyed. the recitativo summons up the march, but instead there is silence. mozart lays down his baton. the musicians lay down their instruments. the celebrants of figaro's wedding come in with a few pitiful dance steps, in procession, only to come presently to a halt, lacking their music. the singers try to go on singing, but they have no cues from their conductor or from the accompaniment. everyone on stage looks lost, though they attempt to go on with the story for a while. consternation grows on the faces of the conspirators. mozart glances back at the group seated in the theatre. finally, the emperor speaks, in a whisper.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{what is this? i don't understand. is it modern?}
<C>__{bonno}
<D>__{majesty, the herr director, he has removed a balleto that would have occurred at this place.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{why? orsini rosenberg it is your regulation, sire. no ballet in your opera.}
<A>__{mozart strains to hear what they are saying but cannot.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{do you like this, salieri?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{it is not a question of liking, your majesty. your own law decrees it, i'm afraid.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{well, look at them.}
<A>__{we do look at them. the spectacle on stage has now ground to a complete halt.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{no, no, no! this is nonsense. let me hear the scene with the music. orsini rosenberg but, sire }
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{oblige me.}
<A>__{orsini rosenberg acknowledges his defeat.}
<D>__{orsini rosenberg yes, majesty.}
<A>__{orsini rosenberg rises and goes down to where mozart sits anxiously with the musicians, watching his approach.}
<D>__{orsini rosenberg can we see the scene with the music back, please?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{oh yes, certainly. certainly, herr director!}
<A>__{he looks back deliriously at salieri, trying to indicate his gratitude. salieri acknowledges with a slight and subtle nod. orsini rosenberg returns to his king.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen, we're going from where we stopped. the count: anches so. right away, please!}
<A>__{the singers scatter offstage to begin the scene again.}
<C>__{joseph}
<P>__{(to orsini rosenberg)}
<D>__{what i hoped by that edict, director, was simply to prevent hours of dancing like in french opera. there it is endless, as you know. orsini rosenberg quite so, majesty.}
