<L>__{exterior sky close on angela}
<A>__{moving in a surreal fashion across an evening sky. below her the city of angels sweep past. her eyes drift open and widen in horror as she sees beyond reality }
<B>__{reflection in her eyes}
<A>__{the city is on fire. it's a repeat of isabel's prophetic vision before she jumped.}
<C>__{midnite }
<D>__{listen to my voice inside...}
<L>__{interior midnite's storage room}
<A>__{midnite kneels in front of john who is now handcuffed to the chair, cables draped from every limb.}
<C>__{midnite}
<D>__{i will try and guide you out.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{try?}
<C>__{midnite}
<D>__{mammon was forced out of that girl when she jumped so unless he found a holding vessel to wait in, he would have fallen back to hell.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no, he's still here. i'm sure of it.}
<C>__{midnite}
<D>__{then watch yourself. he could be in anyone out there.}
<A>__{john nods. midnite lifts a palm of insect wings in front of his face.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{roach wings? what happened to using lilac pedals ?}
<A>__{midnite cranks the juice on the panel as he blows and john reacts as if being hit by a blast of wind. his head slams back against the slats. his skin ripples from the force. stay on his face as the sound of power courses through john.}

<D>__{peter do caelis, deus, misere nobis. fili redemptor mundi, deus, miserere nobis...}
<A>__{a flash turns into a streak behind john's face stretching to infinity.}
<C>__{midnite }
<D>__{find the possessor and the spear will be revealed... find them... find them and follow...}
<A>__{the flash whips back toward us and john is suddenly somewhere else. he looks o.s.}
