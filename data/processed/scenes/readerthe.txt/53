<A>__{seen from outside, a shop full of stamps. michael and a stamp dealer with white hair and a moustache. michael is offering his pyramid stamp, his gestures becoming desperate as the stamp dealer shakes his head, clearly not giving him as much as he hopes. then michael concedes, the dealer concedes, and a bunch of notes are handed across. michael runs exhilarated out into the street.}

<D>__{"danger will only increase my love, it will sharpen it, it will give it spice. i will be the only angel you need. on this arm, luise, you will go dancing through life. you will leave life even more beautiful than you entered it. heaven will take you back and look at you and say `only one thing can make a soul complete, and that thing is love.'}
