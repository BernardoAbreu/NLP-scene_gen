<A>__{close up of sam asleep in bed. he is thrashing at his pillow and moaning. suddenly, a hand reaches out and touches his shoulder. sam jumps straight up in bed and kicks wildly at the sheets.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{sam's p.o.v. molly is sitting on the bed looking at him, afraid. sam stares down at her. he is breathing heavily, not trusting his own senses. his hands clutch at the wall.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what's happening to me?!}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{suddenly, a brilliant white light shoots into the room as a host of glowing forms, radiating an intense inner light, float before us. a blinding tunnel spirals in an infinite vortex behind them. sam is awed and confused. we sense that the light is enchanting him. the entire room begins to disappear in the light. molly screams.}
<C>__{molly}
<D>__{don't leave me. i need you, sam.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{sam turns and sees molly, only she is not in the bed. she is back on the street. to his amazement, he is on the street, too, still bathed in the soothing light. frightened, he calls out to her.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{molly!}
<A>__{she does not hear him. he calls again.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{molly.}
<A>__{there is no response. sam, deeply troubled, hesitates for a moment. he is torn between molly and the light. then, in a painful, but conscious gesture, he turns from the light and walks toward molly. at that instant, the light behind him disappears with the sound of a pneumatic door closing. there is a sense of terrible finality as the tunnel evaporates into the void. sam is left on the dark pavement. he stands there a moment, as if in shock, and then begins running toward molly. an ambulance is rounding the corner.}
