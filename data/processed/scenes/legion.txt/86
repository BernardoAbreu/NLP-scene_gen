<A>__{jeep and bob enter the diner to see michael helping charlie to her feet, while audrey continues to pace, the bundle of bloody blankets cradled in her arms.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{something's happening. they're moving away.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{the possessed can't come near the child, so he sent someone that can. someone like me.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{gabriel. my lieutenant. he's come to do what i wouldn't.}
<A>__{on jeep as the realization hits him.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{your orders...}
<A>__{michael looks at jeep.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{you were the one who was supposed to kill the baby? that was the order you didn't obey.}
<A>__{michael nods grimly. charlie looks urgently at michael.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{what's he talking about?}
<A>__{the baby cries louder.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{michael, what the hell's he talking about?!}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{there was never meant to be a second coming. but we've just changed that. the child lives. the future is unwritten. there's still hope.}
<A>__{charlie, shaken by this revelation, reaches out to audrey.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{audrey...?}
<A>__{audrey moves to hand over the baby to charlie... ...and that's when sandra springs out of her chair and snatches the baby from audrey's arms! sandra backs away from them, moving toward the front door. hers is the face of madness.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{stay away from me! don't come any closer!}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{mom!}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{don't do it, lady!}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{you heard what he said. they just want the baby. maybe if we just give it to them, then they'll let us go!}
<A>__{michael cocks his gun. points it at sandra. the horn blares once more, deafening, shaking everything in the diner. it's right outside the door. charlie squares off with sandra, panic in her eyes.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{give him to me!}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{why?! you never wanted him in the first place!}
<A>__{charlie stares at her in horror, the truth of those words rattling her to the very core.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no... i...}
<A>__{sandra is almost to the front door.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{it's just one baby. just one.}
<A>__{crash! the door is torn off its hinges. a brilliant spectral light pours into the diner. sandra is blinded. she raises a hand to block the light. and that's when michael fires. blam! sandra staggers back, blood dripping from the hole in her forehead, and... ...the baby goes flying out of her hands! charlie screams and the world moves into slow motion... and everything suddenly goes very quiet. michael fires again. blowing sandra's body back through the doorway. jeep watches the baby sail slowly through the air. the time for jeep to act is now! jeep dives for the baby...catching the bundle of rags mere inches from the ground! and then he looks up to see... the dark silhouette of a man approaching from out of the spectral light. a man with wings. jeep's eyes grow wide as the fierce angel steps into the diner. but this looks like no angel we've seen before. this is a creature built for war. rough hewn, battle scarred. his body armor making him appear disturbingly insect like. his wings are not feathery or gentle. rather they are hard, mechanical, an organic machine. the angel's wings retract with clockwork like precision. and now that we see the his face clearly, we notice his striking resemblance to michael. we might even mistake them for brothers. his name is gabriel. gabriel raises a massive, ferocious, strangely mechanical looking mace in his powerful hands. and the world returns to normal speed as gabriel brings the mace arcing down at jeep. jeep rolls! clang! the weapon just misses him, hitting the floor in a spray of sparks, literally cracking the ground. gabriel brings the mace up again. jeep won't be so lucky twice.}
<C>__{bob }
<D>__{sonuvabitch!}
<A>__{bob charges at the creature, sub machine gun blazing. gabriel reacts by instantly unfolding his wings and launching himself into the air. the bullets clawing up the wall behind him. but bob's heroic move has given jeep time to get up and run with the baby for the back of the diner. he thrusts the child into charlie's hands. and without even thinking, she pulls the child protectively to her chest. gabriel drops down in front of bob, whipping his wings around like a deadly, razor sharp fan! bob stops firing, a look of surprise stretches over his face. his gun falling from his hands. blood begins to pour out of the slice across his belly.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{with a sweep of his hand, gabriel sends bob flying across the diner where he crashes down behind the counter near the stove. michael grabs jeep's hand before the boy can rush back into the fray.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no, jeep! you must protect the child now!}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{me?! what about you?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{my path ends here. you are the true protector. you always have been.}
<A>__{jeep shakes his head, panic setting in.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{but i don't know what to do!}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{find the prophets. learn to read the instructions.}
<A>__{michael lets go of jeep's hand and turns away to face gabriel, leaving jeep to contemplate those final words.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{prophets? what prophets? what instructions?!}
<A>__{and that's when jeep opens his hand to find the keys to michael's police cruiser. jeep looks up from the keys to see charlie, audrey and the baby. the responsibility crashing in on him. then he closes his hand around the keys, determination building.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{c'mon!}
<A>__{charlie looks past jeep to see michael returning to the fray.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{wait! we can't leave him!}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{we have no choice! we have to get to red rock!}
<A>__{he pulls charlie past the counter toward the back office. jeep stops when he sees his father's broken body lying on the ground by the stove in a pool of his own blood. bob's half open eyes focus on his son. in his outstretched hand is that goddamn zippo lighter... and next to that, a broken gas pipe leading to the stove. jeep is terrified.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{dad!}
<A>__{jeep tries to help him up.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{leave me, jeep. my place is here, remember?}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{but dad...!}
<A>__{bob smiles weakly at his son and says simply:}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{run.}
<A>__{and so jeep, fighting back tears, does what his father says.}
