<A>__{reed melts down the sides of an awning, like a salvador dali watch. he tries to grab hold of window ledges, but he can't get a grip. his arm streeetches, and snap! he falls like a slinky, out of control. half his body loose, half hard. he drips to the sidewalk, where...doom steps out. he catches reed's face, holds it close.}

<D>__{why the long face?}
<A>__{doom whips reed into the night. as doom turns, people cower, horrified by his face. they clear out, and... doom sees his reflection in a window: scarred skin, metallic veins. a monster. infuriated, he shatters the window with an iron fist, and bounds into the night.}
