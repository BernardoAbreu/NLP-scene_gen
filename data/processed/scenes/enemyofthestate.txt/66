<C>__{blake}
<D>__{we've also been informed that the grand jury is going to call for an investigation into your affairs.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{blake}
<D>__{they want to hold you in contempt for ethics violations.}
<C>__{silverberg}
<D>__{they claim you helped create a shell company for sam vollotti in zurich and that through your continuing relationship, the gambino family's been able to exert influence and provide false witnesses to discredit our case.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{oh, well, that's true.}
<C>__{blake}
<D>__{it is?}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{except for the part about my setting up a company in zurich and knowing anyone named sam vollotti and having any relationship whatsoever with the gambino family.}
<C>__{silverberg}

<C>__{blake}
<D>__{why don't you just call brill directly.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{i don't know who he is.}
<C>__{blake}
<D>__{i'm told you had an affair with rachel banks four years ago.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{told by whom?}
<C>__{blake}
<D>__{considering the enormous exposure to which you've subjected this firm, i'd think you'd do best to simply answer my questions.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{blake}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{well considering what a colossal douche bag you are, david, maybe i'd do best to simply kick your ass all over the capitol.}
<C>__{silverberg}
<D>__{gentlemen }
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{this is bullshit . someone's mixing up a bunch of half truths to ruin me and to ruin my case.}
<C>__{silverberg}
<D>__{who would do that?}
<C>__{dean}

<C>__{silverberg}
<D>__{well until we find, you're gonna have to take a leave of absence.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{you're firing me.}
<C>__{silverberg}
<D>__{a leave of absence. until we've sorted this all out.}
<C>__{dean}
<D>__{put david on it. he seems anxious to clear my name.}
