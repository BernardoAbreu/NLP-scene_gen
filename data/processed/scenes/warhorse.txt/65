<L>__{interior kitchen. late that night.}
<A>__{the sound of shells exploding. a huge bombardment somewhere in the deep distance. but much closer than before. the distant, malicious giants of war growl. it is like a lightning storm on the horizon. the kitchen has been emptied. the war has finally come to them and we can see it on emilie's face.}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{tell me what happened to them. to my mother and father.}
<A>__{grandfather doesn't respond.}
<C>__{emilie }
<D>__{you said you would tell me how they died. on my birthday. and tomorrow's my birthday! they died fighting, didn't they? but when the soldiers come }
<A>__{she finally turns to face him.}
<C>__{emilie }
<D>__{ you do nothing. you are a coward, aren't you?}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{yes. yes. it was your parents who were brave. i make jams.}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{and you've never done a brave thing in your life?}
<A>__{he eases himself into a chair and shrugs.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{maybe there are different ways to be brave. did you know the french have the best carrier pigeons? and this could be the difference in the war our messages getting through.}
<C>__{emilie}
<D>__{i don't want to hear about the birds.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{they are released at the front and told to go home this is all they know. but to get there they must fly over a war. can you imagine such a thing? here you are flying over so much pain and terror and you know you can never look down. you have to look forward or you'll never get home. i ask you what could be braver than that?}
<A>__{emilie sheds a single tear.}
