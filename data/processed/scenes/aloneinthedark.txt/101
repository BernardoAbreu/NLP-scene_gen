<A>__{fischer quietly opens the door to the living room, gripping his revolver tightly. he steps into the room. the lights in the living room are out. a broken lamp lies smashed on its side. fischer comes around the side of the couch. he stops, shocked. sarah fischer's dead body lies in a pool of blood. fischer is suddenly grabbed and slammed into the wall. the impact knocks several framed photos of fischer and his wife off the wall. they shatter as they hit the floor. fischer is punched in the face, hard. he is stunned. fischer is hurled over the couch. he lands heavily on a glass coffee table, shattering the glass tabletop. the impact knocks his revolver out of his hands. fischer lies dazed in the broken glass. he looks up at his attacker. it's hudgens, standing over him. hudgens slams his fist into fischer's face. fischer is now only semi conscious. hudgens pulls out a long, thin spinal worm. its many clawed feet and razor sharp jaws snap away, its segmented, scaled body writhing in his grip.}
