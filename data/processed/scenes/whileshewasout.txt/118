<A>__{she passes the plymouth on her way. sees its wheels lodged deep in the mud. keeps going.}
<L>__{exterior empty housing estate evening}
<A>__{she drives right on through the ghostly housing estate, slowing only to change back into drive as the road improves. empty houses flash past like a movie in rewind. the lights of the mall grow closer.}
<L>__{interior ford explorer evening}
<A>__{she passes that stop sign, sighs. the barrier is open and the road up to the mall stretches freely ahead. she slowly inches out on to the road and commits to her return to "civilization".}
