<L>__{interior small television studio night}
<A>__{aaron is seated behind a desk some old news copy in his hand. an unmanned camera is pointing at him. tom is standing a few feet further back studying him.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{this is uncomfortable for me because, well, i don't mean it as a knock, but we approach this differently.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{we sure do. i don't mean it as a knock either.}
<P>__{(he smiles)}
<D>__{go ahead. i will just say what i think and you can disregard it if you want.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{it just might not work for me because of our different approaches.}
<A>__{tom nods and gestures that he proceed. aaron begins reading the news. barely a sentence in, he is interrupted.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{wait.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{your coat jacket is rising up in back.}
<A>__{aaron ignores the tip.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{when you sit down sit on your jacket a little that gives you a good line. look at yourself in the monitor.}
<A>__{aaron looks but is unimpressed and resumes reading the news. tom, not about to be ignored when he knows it's important, moves behind aaron and begins to force his jacket down.}
<C>__{aaron}
<P>__{(very uncomfortable)}
<D>__{i don't like being handled.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{sit on it! now look.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{just don't physically...}
<P>__{(he sees himself in the}
<D>__{monitor and is suddenly}
<P>__{enthusiastic)}
<D>__{fantastic tip fantastic.}
<A>__{he starts to read again.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{no. that's not going to tell us anything. let's get this prompter going.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{it's not loaded.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i will find some copy. be right back.}
<A>__{tom exits aaron looking after him, clearly taken with the genuine camaraderie... the unmistakable joy tom derives from helping out. several beats and tom comes back with a cameraman in tow.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i got copy, i got ellen to heat up the camera and i got master control taping so you can study it later.}
<A>__{he puts the roll of copy in the prompter.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{hey, tom...}
<A>__{tom turns.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{i'm very appreciative.}
<A>__{same scene later tom totally focused on him down one knee checking him from various angles. he interrupts. aaron reading from the prompter.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{no. no.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that. you don't want to look shifty, do you?}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{oh, god, no!}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{and the left side of your face is the good one. go again. and try to punch one word or phrase in every sentence punch one idea a story. punch come on }
<A>__{aaron does same with the story he is reading...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{good...very nice.}
<A>__{aaron acknowledges the compliment in news mode. punching the first words.}
<D>__{aaronthank you for the compliment, tom.}
<A>__{he draws a laugh from the cameraman as he goes right into the next story.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{try not to move your head or wrinkle your forehead...this is good, very good...}
