<L>__{exterior erin's house night}
<A>__{erin steps out onto her front stoop and looks over at what used to be mrs. morales's house. a few motorcycles are parked on the lawn; a few bikers are drinking beer on the stoop; and one asshole is on his bike, revving his engine.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{but of course he can't hear her. she walks over to him, stands right in his line of vision.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{hey!}
<A>__{he sees her and kills the engine. everything about george halaby is tough his denim, his leather, his bike, his long hair. everything but his eyes, which twinkle like santa's.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{well, hello to you, darlin'.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{what the hell do you think you're doing, making all that goddamn noise?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{just introducing myself to the neighbors.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{well, i'm the neighbors. there, now we're introduced, so you can shut the fuck up.}
<A>__{the guys on the porch chuckle. erin turns and starts back to her house. george hops off his bike and follows her.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{ooh, now, see, if i'da known there was a beautiful woman next door, i'da done this different. let's start over. my name's george. what's yours?}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{just think of me as the person next door who likes it quiet, and we'll get along fine.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{now, don't be like that. tell you what. how about if i take you out on a date to apologize for my rudeness?}
<A>__{erin shakes her head in disbelief and keeps walking.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{come on. gimme your number, i will call you up proper and ask you out and everything.}
<A>__{she stops at her porch, turns to him.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{you want my number?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{which number do you want, george?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you got more than one?}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{shit, yeah. i got numbers coming out of my ears. like, for instance, ten.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{ten?}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{sure. that's one of my numbers. it's how many months old my little girl is.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you got a little girl?}
<C>__{erin}
<D>__{yeah. sexy, huh? and here's another: five. that's how old my other daughter is. seven is my son's age. two is how many times i been married and divorced. you getting all this? 16 is the number of dollars in my bank account. 454 3943 is my phone number. and with all the other numbers i gave you, i'm guessing zero is the number of times you're gonna call it.}
<A>__{she turns and heads inside. he calls out after her:}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{how the hell do you know your bank balance right off the top of your head like that? see, that impresses me.}
