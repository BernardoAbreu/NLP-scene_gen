<L>__{interior suburban extremely well stocked kitchen early morning}
<A>__{rachel, smoking a cigarette and drinking a diet coke, flings open pantry doors, closet doors looking for ben attempting to put stone hard butter on toast at the same time. she glances at the clock 7:55. oh dear. annabelle sits at the table, in a grumpy orangey red mood. rachel hands her what was once a piece of toast.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{no. i told you. i like apple butter not butter butter.}

<P>__{(to the non existent ben)}
<D>__{alright ben you deal with the tardy, you write yourself a note, your daddy told you he had an important case this morning and he had to leave early and we were aaaagggghhhh!}
<A>__{she has opened a cupboard with a lazy susan that turns revealing ben sitting there. rachel screams again!}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{oh my god. that is so not funny. you're late. you're really late. now get out here and have some cereal.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{fine! eat in the cupboard.}
<A>__{she hands him a bowl of sugared cereal puts two spoonfuls of instant coffee in barney cup, and sticks it under the faucet.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no! cocoa puffs on top fruit loops on the bottom.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{rachel grabs the bowl, turn it upside down on the table reversing the order of the cereal. she sweeps it back in the bowl and quickly hands it back to him, the phone rings throughout...}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you touched it.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{then have a donut }
<C>__{ben}

<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(picking up phone)}
<D>__{hello?...duncan...the ad agency's already there?...i'm out the door...}
<P>__{(ben flings a fruit loop at her)}
<D>__{ben! knock it off!}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{it's gonna go beautifully...}
<P>__{(another fruit loop)}
<D>__{damn it ben }
<A>__{rachel runs around absentmindedly loading out leftover pizza, hoho's, and chips. she glances at the clock again 8:00.}
<C>__{annabelle}
<D>__{you swore. you owe me a quarter. did you remember my egg carton? i told you i needed my egg carton for seed planting today.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{absolutely duncan i'm on top of everything.}
<A>__{rachel takes the eggs from the fridge, and dumps them accidentally missing the sink. they shatter onto the floor. she hands the empty carton to annabelle.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{...eggzactly. i'm putting on my coat }
<P>__{(she hangs up, panicked)}
<D>__{we are late. we are seriously late. which means mister ben we've got to get you dressed }
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{ben races away but rachel lunges and catches him. he wiggles in her arms as she struggles to change his clothes. just as she gets his bottoms off she drops his clothes in the pile of gooey eggs when we hear a loud knocking at the kitchen door. holding a half naked ben in her arms, rachel looks up at... jackie harrison. an immaculately dressed, intimidatingly intel ligent, utterly beautiful woman staring at her with extreme disapproval.}
<C>__{annabelle and ben}
<D>__{mommy!}
<A>__{annabelle and ben race into their mother's arms like little angels. jackie shoots a fiercely protective glare at rachel. they lock eyes. enough wattage to light up all of manhattan.}
