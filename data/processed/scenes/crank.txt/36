<L>__{int chev’s car, moments later}
<A>__{speeding along, weaving erratically through traffic, sweating hard, panting with adrenaline. sound: bee dee dee deee dee deee dee dee dum. chev’s cell rings. he picks it right up.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{doc?}
<A>__{in a split screen we see it's verona.}

<D>__{i'm coming for you, asshole, believe me.}
<C>__{verona}
<D>__{yeah, whatever. look, just thought you'd like to know that i'm all about hooking up with that mystery girl you’ve been banging as soon as your ass is underground ... i forgot to say so on that gay james bond tape i left for you...}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{yeah, yeah, then you're going to rape my grandmother, blah blah blah. what do you think carlito is going to think when he finds out what you did? your whole crew is history.}
<A>__{chev checks the rearview mirror.}
<C>__{chev }
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{great.}
<A>__{throughout the conversation his driving has gotten faster, more and more out of control. now a squad car has pulled up behind him, cherry top flashing, broadcasting a warning to “pull over” out of its intercom. chev goes evasive, leading the cop on a high speed chase.}
<C>__{verona}
<D>__{carlito? that's funny, i guess you didn't know... carlito's my boy now, we're tight.}
<C>__{chev}

<C>__{chev}
<D>__{we’ll see.}
<C>__{verona}
<D>__{right, right, and the best part about it is...}
<A>__{chev’s phone beeps incoming call.}
<C>__{chev}
<D>__{sorry, i must take this. see you later.}
<C>__{verona}
<D>__{i doubt it.}
<A>__{chev pushes “answer” and picks up the new call.}
<C>__{chev}
