<L>__{ext vatican archives night}
<A>__{the face of langdon's mickey mouse watch is smeared with blood from a cut on his hand, but we can still read the time. it's 9:41. langdon and chartrand stagger down the front steps of the vatican archives, where they're immediately met by three vatican police cars. olivetti leaps out of one and meets them at the base of the steps, holding his hands up in defense almost before langdon can lay into him.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{are you out of your minds?!}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{please. in the car.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{someone tried to kill me.}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{do you know where the next church is?}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{then get in the car!}
<A>__{langdon jumps in the back seat of the car with olivetti, and they squeal away from the archives. in the car, they continue as the driver tears through the streets of rome.}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{we had no idea that }
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{you heard me ask permission! you assigned me an escort! don't try to tell me you didn't know i was in there!}
<C>__{olivetti}
<P>__{(let me finish)}
<D>__{of course i knew, but we had no idea that portions of our white zones are}
<C>__{olivetti }
<D>__{cross wired with that building. commander rocher was extending the search, if he'd known the archives were on that grid, he never would have killed the power.}
<A>__{langdon looks at him evenly, sees in olivetti's eyes that they may be thinking the same thing.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{or there is the other possibility.}
<A>__{olivetti doesn't answer. but he's thinking about it.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{infiltration is the illuminati specialty why not the head of the swiss guard?}
<C>__{olivetti}
<P>__{(agonized)}
<D>__{perhaps.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{i want to speak to the camerlengo.}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{il camerlengo is unavailable,}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{unavailable? why?}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{he's found evidence that the holy father was indeed murdered. he is seeking guidance.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{from whom?}
<A>__{olivetti looks at him what are you, an idiot?}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{from god.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{oh, right.}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{please. make an effort.}
