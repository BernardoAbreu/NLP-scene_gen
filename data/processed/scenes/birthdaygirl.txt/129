<L>__{exterior dual carriageway night}
<A>__{cars tear through the night along the carriage way, past a happy eater. we pan round, across the motorway to a single storey run down motel.}
<L>__{interior motel chalet 17 night}
<A>__{a crusty motel chalet. yuri and alexei are sitting on a double bed counting the money. the t.v. is on in the corner with the sound turned down and there are empty miniatures from the mini bar scattered around. nadia appears from the kitchenette area. they all seem more relaxed, more themselves, as if what we've seen before was an act. for the first time in the film their conversation appears as english subtitles.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{so?}
<A>__{alexei says "ssshhh" he is counting in his head. he stops.}
<C>__{alexei}
<P>__{(to yuri)}
<D>__{you first.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{fifty thousand. almost exactly.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{sixty four thousand, eight hundred.}
<C>__{alexei}
<D>__{there's over eighty thousand here.}
<A>__{they look at each other, absorbing the moment.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{sweet jesus...}
<A>__{he lies back on the bed and chuckles.}
<C>__{alexei}
<D>__{put it in the cases. split it up. and don't forget you owe me 150.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{alexei}
<D>__{you know what for.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{no i don't.}
<C>__{alexei}
<D>__{i got you those trousers from paul smith.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{i've been buying you stuff all week. i've been buying him stuff all week.}
<C>__{alexei}
<D>__{such as?}
<A>__{nadia is smiling at them as they squabble.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{when we went to the hard rock cafe. who paid? when we went to see 'cats'. who paid?}
<C>__{alexei}
<D>__{those aren't presents. that's normal friendship stuff}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{i paid for those guitar cases.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{what was 'cats' like?}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{it was alright.}
<C>__{alexei}
<D>__{yeah it was okay.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{yeah. it was quite good actually. some bits i really liked.}
<C>__{alexei}
<D>__{the sets were good.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{the sets were excellent. everything was big, you know, all the rubbish, coke cans, sweet wrappers, dustbins, so when you were watching it you felt cat size. it was really clever.}
<A>__{yuri goes into the bathroom, leaving nadia and alexei alone on the bed. alexei runs his hand across nadia's cheek.}
<C>__{alexei}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{so. how many times did you have to fuck him?}
