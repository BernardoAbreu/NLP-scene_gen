<L>__{exterior topaz ranch house day}
<A>__{shelley, a negro servant of the harolday household, is discovered sweeping the front porch. behind him we see clint open the door peer furtively out then cross the porch to its edge when he looks o.s. as though searching for someone. shelley, meantime, has noticed clint, but goes right on with his sweeping. his only reaction is a disparaging glance over his shoulder.}
<C>__{clint}
<P>__{(turning to shelley)}
<D>__{have you seen arly?}
<C>__{shelley}
<D>__{no, suh, ah didn't see miss arly today, but ah seed her las' night, and she shore was mad.}
<A>__{to emphasize his point, shelley puckers his mouth in a whistle.}
<C>__{shelley}
<D>__{plenty mad!}
<A>__{clint's face tightens as he anticipates what is in store for him. over the scene comes the gradually increasing sound of a feminine voice, gayly humming the notes of a popular tune of the period. clint's strained features relax in a can that be arly expression, while shelley stops dead in the middle of a sweep, and now both stare incredulously, o.s.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{from their angle we first see only the corner of the house, while the owner of the voice approaches from the other side. now arly comes into view, entirely oblivious of clint and shelley watching her. she seems more attractive, in a feminine way, this morning. it may be the skirt and blouse she is wearing. then again it may be the flower she is, even now, adjusting in her hair. the presence of the two men suddenly startles her. the song ends abruptly, while her hands fall quickly away from the flower.}
<B>__{arly}
<A>__{as arly moves toward the porch, shelley snaps back to life and resumes sweeping but furiously. clint regards the girl in the vague manner of the puzzled gent he is.}
<C>__{clint}
<P>__{(not too definitely)}
<D>__{'mornin', arly }
<A>__{arly is coming toward clinterior}
<C>__{arly}
<P>__{(pleasantly)}
<D>__{'mornin', clinterior}
<A>__{she steps close to clint, and he slowly backs up a step, for he does not know she came up to him merely to pick up her jacket lying on the ground near the step.}
<C>__{clint}
<P>__{(as arly leans down to pick up the jacket)}
<D>__{you must be feeling pretty good.}
<A>__{arly straightens up with the jacket in her hand, and the corner of her mouth curls in a faint smile. she turns now and starts along the walk, and takes only a few steps when clint comes to her side.}
<B>__{arly and clint walking}
<C>__{clint}
<P>__{(as he joins arly)}
<D>__{say, arly about that poker game, night before last, i }
<C>__{arly}
<P>__{(tossing it off)}
<D>__{forget it.}
<C>__{clint}
<P>__{(did he hear correctly)}
<D>__{forget it?}
<A>__{arly pays no attention to clinterior she is looking o.s. and stops walking.}
