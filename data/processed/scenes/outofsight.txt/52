<D>__{what'd i say?}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{"hey, yourself."}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{huh.}
<A>__{we hear a knock at the door. they look to where special agent daniel burdon black, forties, expensive suit stands in the doorway, file in one hand.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{hello, daniel.}
<C>__{burdon}
<P>__{(to marshall)}
<D>__{daniel burdon, fbi.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{marshall sisco. karen's dad.}
<C>__{burdon}
<D>__{you mind please waiting outside. we have some business to do here.}
<A>__{marshall looks at him a moment. then, to karen...}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{i need to go to the john anyway.}
<A>__{burdon waits for marshall to walk out, then sits down.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i wanna be on the task force, daniel.}
<C>__{burdon}
<D>__{that's nice of you to offer, karen, but i got all the help i can use right now. instead, let's talk about how you got the bump on your head.}
<C>__{karen}
<P>__{(indicates file)}
<D>__{isn't that my report you're holding onto?}
<C>__{burdon}
<D>__{yes, but i want to hear you tell it. starting with when you tried to grab the wheel where was this?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{coming to the okeechobee exit...}
<A>__{and now we see it...}
<B>__{inside the car}
<A>__{going over a hundred miles per hour, blowing past cars...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{take the next exit.}
<C>__{glenn}
<D>__{what am i supposed to do now ?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{glenn, take the exit.}
<C>__{glenn}
<D>__{no way, man, no fuckin' way am i gonna turn myself in.}
<A>__{she reaches over and grabs the wheel.}
<C>__{glenn }
<D>__{the fuck are you doing?!}
<A>__{he hits the brakes. the car goes off the road, down the grade, the abutment coming right at us as we go back to...}
<B>__{the hospital room}
<A>__{as burdon sets the file down, sits back now.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{the next thing i knew, the paramedics were taking me out the car.}
<A>__{burdon looks at karen a moment, then...}
<C>__{burdon}
<D>__{there's a couple of points i keep wondering about have to do with the two guys that grabbed you. buddy is it? and this fella jack foley. i swear the man must've robbed two hundred banks in his time.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{really? huh. he told me he didn't remember how many he robbed.}
<C>__{burdon}
<D>__{you talked to him?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{in the trunk, yeah?}
<C>__{burdon}
<D>__{what'd you talk about?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{oh... different things, prison, movies.}
<C>__{burdon}
<D>__{this fella holds you hostage, you talk about movies?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{it was an unusual experience.}
<C>__{burdon}
<D>__{foley made me think of that fella carl tillman, the one you were seeing, it turns out the same time he was doing banks. you recall that?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{when i was seeing carl tillman, i didn't know he robbed banks.}
<C>__{burdon}
<D>__{yeah, but i had enough reason to believe he did, and i told you. so you had to at least suspect him.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{and what happened to carl?}
<C>__{burdon}
<D>__{the time came, you shot him. but you didn't shoot foley or the guy with him. they're unarmed, you had a shotgun and you let them throw you in the trunk. okay, now you got your sig in your hand. you say in the report you couldn't turn around, he had you pinned down. but when the trunk opened, how come you didn't cap the two guys then?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{is that what you would've done?}
<C>__{burdon}
<D>__{you say in the report glenn didn't have a gun, but you let him get away, too.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{daniel, what do you work on most of the time, fraud? go after crooked bookkeepers.}
<C>__{burdon}
<D>__{karen, i've been with the bureau fifteen years, on all kinds of investigations.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{have you ever shot a man? how many times have you been primary through the door?}
<C>__{burdon}
<D>__{i have to qualify, is that it?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you have to know what you're talking about.}
<A>__{we hear chuckling os. burdon glances at the doorway where we see marshall now standing, enjoying this.}
<C>__{burdon}
<D>__{we'll talk another time, karen. all right? i'd like to know why foley put you in that second car when he didn't need you any more.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you'll have to ask him.}
<C>__{burdon}
<D>__{sounds to me like he liked having you around. i will see you, karen. mr. sisco.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{agent burdon.}
<A>__{marshall waits for him to walk out...}
<C>__{marshall }
<D>__{the white man's burdon. that's what everybody calls him in miami. the metro dade guys. he's got a knack for pissing people off.}
<A>__{she's not listening. he sits down, takes her hand...}
<C>__{marshall }
<D>__{what are you thinking about?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{the sig sauer you got me for my birthday.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{tell you what, you're a good girl, you might get another one for christmas.}
<A>__{she looks at him.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i will get it back when i get foley.}
