<L>__{interior senate building, amidala's apartment day}
<A>__{anakin and jar jar stand near the door of the anteroom to padme's bedroom. padme and dorme move about packing luggage.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{representative binks. i know i can count on you.}
<C>__{jar jar}
<D>__{yousa betchen mesa bottums.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{what?!}
<C>__{jar jar}
<P>__{(coughs, recovers)}
<D>__{oh, pardone ay, senator. i mean, i am honoured to accept this heavy burden. i take on this responsibility with deep humility tinged with an overwhelming pride.}
<P>__{(pompously)}
<D>__{it is not every day that i am called upon to...}
<A>__{padme kisses him on the cheek and gives him a hug. jar jar turns red.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{you're a good friend, jar jar. i don't wish to hold you up. i'm sure you have a great deal to do.}
<C>__{jar jar}
<D>__{of course, m'lady.}
<A>__{jar jar bows and goes out. as he passes anakin, he flashes a dazzling smile... padme is in a very bad mood.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{i do not like this idea of hiding.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{don't worry. now that the council has ordered an investigation, it won't take master obi wan long to find that bounty hunter.}
<C>__{padme}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{i haven't worked for a year to defeat the "military creation act" not to be here when its fate is decided.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{sometimes we have to let go of our pride and do what is requested of us.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{pride?!? annie, you're young, and you don't have a very firm grip on politics. i suggest you reserve your opinions for some other time.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{sorry, m'lady. i was only trying to...}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{annie! no!}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{please don't call me that.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{annie...}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{i've always called you that... it is your name, isn't it?}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{it's anakin. when you say annie it's like i'm still a little boy... and i'm not.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{i'm sorry, anakin. it's impossible to deny you've...}
<P>__{(looks him over)}
<D>__{...that you've grown up.}
<A>__{padme smiles at anakin. he becomes a little shy.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{master obi wan manages not to see it...}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{mentors have a way of seeing more of our faults than we would like. it's the only way we grow.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{don't get me wrong... obi wan is a great mentor. as wise as master yoda and as powerful as master windu. i am truly thankful to be his apprentice. only... although i'm a padawan learner, in some ways... a lot of ways... i'm ahead of him. i'm ready for the trials. i know i am! he knows it too. he believes i'm too unpredictable... other jedi my age have gone through the trials and made it... i know i started my training late... but he won't let me move on.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{that must be frustrating.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{it's worse... he's overly critical. he never listens! he just doesn't understand! it's not fair!}
<A>__{padme cannot surpress a laugh. she shakes her head.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{i'm sorry... you sounded exactly like that little boy i once knew, when he didn't get his way.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{i'm not whining! i'm not.}
<A>__{padme just smiles at him. dorme laughs in the background.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{i didn't say it to hurt you.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{i know...}
<A>__{there is a brief silence. padme comes over to anakin.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{anakin...}
<A>__{they look into each other's eyes for the first time.}
<C>__{padme}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{don't try to grow up too fast.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{i am grown up. you said it yourself.}
<A>__{anakin looks deep into padme's eyes.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{please don't look at me like that.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{because i can see what you're thinking.}
<C>__{anakin}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{ahh... so, you have jedi powers too?}
<A>__{dorme is watching with concern.}
<C>__{padme}
<D>__{it makes me feel uncomfortable.}
<C>__{anakin}
<D>__{sorry, m'lady.}
<A>__{anakin backs away as padme turns and goes back to her packing.}
