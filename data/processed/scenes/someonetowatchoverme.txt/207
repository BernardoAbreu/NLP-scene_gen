<L>__{interior claire's apartment same night}
<A>__{silent, save for classical music as mike quietly enters. he pauses a moment, his eyes filled with unhappiness, then moves in the direction of the music spotting claire, immobile since we last saw her, still gazing out the window. close on mike: as always, affected by her. she becomes aware of his presence and slowly turns. for a long moment, neither seems willing to move or speak. finally, he does.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{t.j. agreed to take my shift. he knows about us.}
<A>__{she absorbs it, without response.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(a beat; with difficulty)}
<D>__{so does ellie.}
<A>__{she nods. thoughtfully. as though willing to deal with it intellectually, but avoiding any encounter with her emotions.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{you told her?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{not exactly.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{what do you want to do?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{her eyes turn to his. she moves toward him and sits. claire pulls him close to her. a soft gershwin tune plays. she sees how drawn mike is.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{you're tired.}
<P>__{(smiles, gently)}
<D>__{let me watch over you tonight...}
