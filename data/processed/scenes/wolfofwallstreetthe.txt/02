<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{watch and learn, people!}

<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{one. two. throw!!}
<A>__{the brokers cheer, and as the screaming dwarf takes flight, hurtling toward camera, we freeze frame:}
<D>__{jordan (v.o.) (cont'd) my name is jordan belfort. no, not him, me. i'm a former member of the middle class raised by two accountants in a tiny apartment in bayside, queens.}
