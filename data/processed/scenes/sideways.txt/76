<L>__{interior saab night}
<A>__{through the windshield trees and bushes lit by the headlights show us we're headed into the woods. inside jack drives. miles blinks heavily as he tries to make a sense of a hand drawn map.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(grabbing the map)}
<D>__{let me see that.}
<L>__{exterior stephanie's house night}
<A>__{the saab pulls into a gravel driveway and comes to a stop outside this wood framed cottage. jack and miles get out and head for the front door. on the way, jack reaches into his coat pocket and produces a string of four condoms.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(tearing)}
<D>__{here. one for you, three for me.}
<A>__{miles wordlessly takes his. just before they climb the porch steps }
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{you sure you want to do this?}
<A>__{jack stops and looks at him for a moment with almost hostile incredulity. the front door is open. jack knocks twice on the screen door before going in.}
