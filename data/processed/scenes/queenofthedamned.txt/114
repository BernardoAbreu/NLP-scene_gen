<L>__{interior backstage night}
<A>__{lestat readies himself as he scans the valley from behind a speaker, and sees... lestat's pov vampires wait here and there in the audience, set to attack.}
<B>__{back to lestat}
<A>__{who smiles to himself.}
<B>__{back in crowd}
<A>__{boom, the torches relight and an enormous chord surges through the crowd louder than a jet on takeoff. the mass surges forward... the stage lights up in a huge halo of blood red light. the band plays a hypnotic tune that would put the devil in a spell, as... we wait for lestat. the band keeps playing the pounding cadence, as... the audience doesn't see lestat anywhere and cheers over the sound, and it seems as if the whole of death valley is shaking, when... lestat appears above the stage, inhumanly levitating and...}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{i'm so glad i decided to rise...}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{after tonight, death valley will live up to its name!}
<A>__{the place erupts into one solid scream as the band kicks it in. he swoops down through the air over the stage and into their very midst. jesse, in the crowd, screams up to him... but her voice is lost in the thousands of screams for him. lestat takes the microphone and leans his lips into it, letting his voice soar into an inhuman note, filling the valley like a demon demanding heaven be replaced with hell. at back of concert mixing board two studio engineers sit dazed.}
<D>__{engineer #1}
<P>__{(cockney accent)}
<D>__{could we turn it down a tad?}
<A>__{the second engineer looks to the mixing panel.}
<D>__{engineer #2 his mic's not even up.}
<A>__{they stare, dumbfounded.}
<B>__{back to concert}
<A>__{the pulsing strain moves into a faster beat as the whole place resonates with the most incredible harmonics, the energy throbbing, the crowd almost genuflecting in front of this papal devil. all move and sway except for... jesse, desperately squeezing through bodies trying to get closer and closer to... lestat, who commands the place with his echoing voice. lestat holds the place in the palm of his hand. lestat's dark soul seems ready to burst as he moves his voice into an even higher unworldly octave, and then... lestat's pov the vampires move through the crowd. goth girls in the front row, weeping... maudy, james and alex off in the clouds, playing the best music of their lives. the place has gone wild, living off its own energy now as waves of sound bounce through the valley band up into the night sky.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you want more?!}
<A>__{the crowd screams...}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{yes!}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{this one's for those who've come for me!}
<A>__{all yell that they have, but the covens know it's for them. lestat launches the band into a new number that makes the previous song seem like a lullaby. he eyes the coven assassins here and there and sings straight to them. his lyrics challenging the assassins, flaunting them with satire. jesse whirls around, spying the assassins in the crowd. she shakes her head no... the covens need no more encouragement as they begin to move through the crowd toward the stage. we rise up over the crowd to see fifty assassins snaking at preternatural speed, unseen to all except us in our inhuman vantage.}
