<L>__{interior libya international airport day}
<A>__{a cold, dreary, oppressive airport. grim looking soldiers and even more menacing security men in dark glasses. in the line of arriving passengers, at the passport control booth, is a limping colombian businessman. scanning the place from behind sunglasses, his heart is pounding, pounding, pounding. this is it. this is real enemy territory now, and he knows it. ramirez's pov the foreboding paranoia that everyone is staring at him. soldiers, security men, airport employees, other passengers. they all seem to know his secret. they're all just waiting for the axe to fall. ramirez heads over to the customs booth. he turns back as a guard pushes him aside to let pass a rich arabic family. a young fat girl holding some toys grimaces at him as she indelicately makes her way with her family through the crowd. in the b.g. we notice a mercedes waiting for them through the glass doors of the airport. ramirez continues on his way towards the customs booth. behind a curtain, he sees a man being searched.}
