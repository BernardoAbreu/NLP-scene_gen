<C>__{daryll}
<P>__{(indignant)}
<D>__{i sent it by private courier, he didn't give it to you? that son of a gun...!}
<A>__{helen looks at m.j., who indicates 'tell you later.'}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i will look for it, daryll lee.}
<C>__{daryll}
<D>__{bet you never figured i'd follow in your footsteps. it's real well written. you should read it you're in it.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i will. i will call you, daryll, and talk to you about it after i've read it. right now i have a question... peter kurten.}
<C>__{daryll}
<D>__{kurten! is he bothering you? i told that son i'd send him what he wanted if he leave you alone.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{ah ha. what did he want?}
<C>__{daryll}
<D>__{something personal. is he bothering you?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i don't know. i'd like to know where he is.}
<C>__{daryll}
<D>__{listen, you want my advice? steer clear. he's writing me he's gonna finish 'my unfinished symphony.' he's gonna give me $550 for some of my cum, he says he's in a position to see that i will be immortal if he has some of my spunk. i'm offended. right away i smell freak . writin' about him and me and you bein' joined and he's gonna finish my symphony ? i didn't care for his drift. i sent some liquid soap in a sandwich baggie with a message from jesus to mend his ways. you hear i found jesus? and what's funny is, now i don't mind bein' inside. if i was out, even born again, i'd probably get restless again. it's maybe better i stay here, what do you think?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i think whatever is best for you, daryll. and maybe you're right, that's the place.}
<C>__{daryll}
<D>__{you come and visit.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{where did you send the message to peter kurten?}
<C>__{daryll}
<D>__{damn! i gave that to conrad, too! that guy! i told conrad deliver to kurten and keep the 500 bucks in return for getting my book to you.}
<A>__{at this mention of conrad, m.j. leaps to another phone...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{how was conrad supposed to find kurten?}
<C>__{daryll}
<D>__{conrad has the phone number. conrad, where is he?}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(from m.j.'s pantomime)}
<D>__{in jail.}
<C>__{daryll}
<D>__{that klutz. they send him back here, i will kick his ass good.}
<C>__{daryll lee}
<D>__{helen, how is life, you okay? come see me, talk to me. i think about you, worry about you all the time. i am so glad jesus didn't let me kill you. you know you're blessed by jesus. that's why you need to come talk to me, because jesus kept you alive for a reason, and i was his sacred instrument... in the moment satan was in my heart raising my hand to kill you, jesus took my hand to spare you. i am both death and life to you...}
<A>__{helen hangs up. m.j. has already left...}
