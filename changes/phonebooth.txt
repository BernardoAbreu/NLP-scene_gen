<ACTION>__{NEW YORK CITY - AERIAL VIEW OF DOWNTOWN MANHATTAN - DAY MULTIPLE STREET SCENES - DAY The sidewalks crowded as usual.  A sea of humanity.  People come and go -- always in a hurry.  Oblivious of one another. A TRAFFIC JAM -- A STREET being torn up by construction workers; A SANITATION TRUCK loading up refuse; VENDORS PEDDLING nuts and salted pretzels; PANHANDLERS blocking a passerby.  Intimidating.  Demanding.  Almost mocking. We're surrounded by the teeming life of the city as we've come to expect it -- complete with a cacophony of sound. MULTIPLE CUTS -- Phone kiosks and phone booths on the East Side and West Side -- uptown and down. One frustrated caller has lost his money in the slot and he takes it out on the equipment -- smashing the receiver violently against the coin box until the instrument splinters into a dozen pieces.}
<CHAR>__{NARRATOR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{There are 237,911 pay telephones in the five burroughs of the city of New York.  Many of them are still in working order.}
<ACTION>__{DOZENS OF QUICK CUTS -- NEW YORKERS on the phone in extreme close up.  We don't hear the words.  Only the facial expressions inform us that these are human beings under tremendous pressure.  Life in the city is wearing them down. MULTIPLE SHOTS - JUST MOUTHS Lips jabbering into receivers.  Cross-cut against one another.}
<CHAR>__{NARRATOR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Despite increased usage of cellular devices, an estimated four and a half million New Yorkers and two million visitors still utilize pay telephones on a regular basis.  At thirty-five cents a pop... for the first three minutes.}
<ACTION>__{ANGLE ON CORNER IN MID-MANHATTAN - DAY There's a phone booth situated on the southeast side of the street.}
<CHAR>__{NARRATOR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're looking at the telephone booth at the corner of 45th Street and 8th Avenue in the heart of the Manhattan theatrical district.  It has been scheduled to be removed and replaced by a kiosk.  It's one of the few remaining phone booths left in the city.}
<ACTION>__{CAMERA MOVES IN on the irate caller in the booth -- a very well-dressed gray-haired lady -- totally conservative in appearance.}
<CHAR>__{WOMAN IN BOOTH} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(into receiver)}
<DIAL>__{You have lied to me for the last time, you lowlife prick bastard!  I don't ever want to hear the sound of your fucking voice again.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(listens)}
<DIAL>__{Yes, well fuck you, too!}
<ACTION>__{She slams down the receiver and exits.  The booth remains vacant for a brief interval.}
<CHAR>__{NARRATOR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{At least three hundred calls daily originate from this booth.  The coins are collected twice a day. This booth has been burglarized forty-one times in the last six months.}
<ACTION>__{Someone is approaching the booth, fishing in his pocket for coins.  This is STUART SHEPARD, snappily dressed, his hair styled and his nails manicured.  Here is a man who clearly takes excellent care of himself.  He sports a Donna Karen suit and silk Armani tie. He's about to step into the booth when he's accosted by a middle-aged man in a soiled apron who's run out of a nearby restaurant and has finally caught up with him.}
<CHAR>__{MARIO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Stu, we got to talk.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Wish I could accommodate you, Mario, but this is my busy time of day.}
<CHAR>__{MARIO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How come you cross the street every time you go past the restaurant?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why don't I stop in later for some lunch?}
<CHAR>__{MARIO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{There's no more drinks or free meals until the restaurant starts showing up in the columns like you said.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm doing my level best for you people.}
<CHAR>__{MARIO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{One lousy mention in the Post and you expect to eat for six months!}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I got the food critic from the Village Voice all lined up to give you a review.}
<CHAR>__{MARIO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's what you tell me last July. And he never shows.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I was allowing you time to expand the menu.  Wallpaper the bathrooms, for God sakes.  You get only one shot with these fucking critics and I don't want you to blow a rare opportunity.}
<CHAR>__{MARIO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You the one blowing it.  How long you think you can fuck everybody?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hold on right there.  I've got a very excellent reputation around this town.}
<CHAR>__{MARIO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So how come you take two nice suits of clothes from Harry and never get his daughter on David Letterman?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hell, I'm not an agent.  I'm a publicist.}
<CHAR>__{MARIO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Mister, you're nothing!}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Believe me, Valerie's on the waiting list to audition.  Harry's got no complaints.  He just let me pick out this tie the other day.}
<CHAR>__{MARIO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That Harry's a damn fool!}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Mario, please let me make this up to you.  How about I arrange for the opening night party for this new off-Broadway show I'm handling -- to be held at your place with local TV coverage on nine and eleven?  I mean I had it promised to another client -- who actually pays me money.  But it isn't firmed up yet.  And I could throw it your way.  Maybe.}
<CHAR>__{MARIO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What is involved?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You'd toss in the buffet for say seventy or eighty.  The producers would supply their own vino, of course.  I'd deliver you a truckload of celebrities.  And if they like the food, they'll all come back, naturally.}
<CHAR>__{MARIO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What celebrities?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You want Liza Minelli?  An Oscar winner.  Or Douglas Fairbanks, Jr.?}
<CHAR>__{MARIO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Is he still alive?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I saw him last night going into the Four Seasons.  I'll bring you over a whole VIP list when we come by for dinner.}
<CHAR>__{MARIO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How come everybody wants to eat but nobody wants to pay?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You can't think small like that. Hey, you still feature musicians Fridays and Saturdays?}
<CHAR>__{MARIO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{At least they work for their meals.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What about Harry's daughter as an extra added attraction?  She'll belt out five or six showtunes -- two sets a night -- and it won't cost you a fucking nickel.}
<CHAR>__{MARIO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How come?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Star Showcase!  Let me handle setting that up.  And when she eventually goes on Letterman, she'll announce I'm currently appearing over at Mario's fine supper club.  Right over CBS she'll say that, Mario.}
<CHAR>__{MARIO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're full of shit.  You know that?  All bullshit!}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's just a vulgar word for PR.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(placing an arm around him)}
<DIAL>__{Mario, you can't hurt my feelings. Even when I was a kid and they hurled certain invectives my way, it never bothered me.  Other kids would fall apart if anybody called them a fucking name.  Me, I just loved the attention!  'Shit-for- brains' -- that's what the bigger kids named me.  And I answered to it.  Hey, 'shit-for brains' reporting for duty.  Everybody loved me for that.  I could take abuse.  After a while, I kind of wore them down.  There was nothing more they could say to me.  So they stopped.  I kind of missed it.}
<CHAR>__{MARIO} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm sorry I even talked to you.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'll bet your loving wife put you up to this.  She saw me pass by and she sent you out in the street. But I don't hold it against you personally -- you still serve up superior veal chop.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(entering phone booth)}
<DIAL>__{Now I got urgent business to conduct, Mario.}
<ACTION>__{He slides the booth closed in Mario's face. The frustrated restaurateur glares at him through the glass before giving up and walking off -- talking to himself as he goes up the block. INSIDE THE BOOTH, Stu inserts his thirty-five cents and dials.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hello, Mavis, sweet creature.}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Where have you been?  Do you think I have nothing to do but wait around for you to call?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm only a few minutes late, loveliest individual on earth.}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Stu, I'm so lonely.  When can I see you?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Good news in that arena.  Kelly goes into rehearsal as of Monday. You know how dedicated she is.  By the time she gets back from dancing her ass off, she goes right to sleep.  We'll have both our days and certain nights.  Not to mention when they take the show on the road.}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How long is that for?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Four to five weeks -- minimum.}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Maybe I should quit my job so we can be together full time.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I wouldn't do that.}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sometimes I think if I have to give one more fucking manicure...}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's how you met me.}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I never saw a worse set of nails. Bit right down to the quick.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm much better groomed since you've been looking after me.}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm glad you admit it.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Even Kelly remarked on it when I first met her.}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{She could care less how you look. She's only interested in pushing her own career.  Some wife you're stuck with!}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The marriage is not without its compensations.  Do you imagine I could afford that apartment on what I'm earning?  Not with everybody cutting back on the publicity.  Not to mention a million college graduates coming into the profession trying to cut me out. And one thing you can't expect from your clients is loyalty.  They get a couple of bad notices, they dump you.  Goodbye.}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Don't go.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I wasn't saying goodbye to you.  I was saying how the clients try to give you the wave off without even a month's notice.}
<ACTION>__{A conservative businessman now stands outside the booth waiting to use it.  He deliberately glances at his watch a few times to demonstrate his impatience.  This bothers Stu who slides the booth open a crack.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(yelling)}
<DIAL>__{What?  Is your watch busted?  It's twenty after eleven and I'm gonna be occupied indefinitely with my transaction.  So get out of my face!}
<ACTION>__{He closes the booth up again and turns his back to the gentleman who gives up and departs.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Sorry, honey.  There will be no further interruption.}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why must you always be calling me from some booth?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{On account of that phone records are regularly subpoenaed in divorce proceedings.  And I don't want some entry showing up on my cellular bill either.  She gets the mail. She looks these items over. Sometimes she even dials up a strange number to see who it is.}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Then she suspects something.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's only because her last husband, the choreographer, ran around on her.  She can't get that out of her head.  That's how she caught onto him.  The phone bills.}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{She hasn't developed much skill at holding a man.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You know what a self-fulfilling prophecy is?  She was so sure I was going to find me a woman that she finally drove me back to you.  I thought I'd feel all guilty about it -- but I guess it hasn't kicked in yet.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(beat)}
<DIAL>__{Still, I wouldn't do anything to hurt her.  Basically, Kelly's a decent individual.}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What about hurting me?  Like last time?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hurt?  You were glad to be rid of me.}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{For a while I was, 'til I took stock of what was around.  You're the lesser of many evils.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's about the nicest thing you ever said.}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'll have it engraved.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We've been up front with each other from the beginning.  Let's keep it that way.  How about a drink?  Say seven o'clock?  The Monkey Bar?}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Meet me in front.  I don't like walking in there unescorted.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, you're great enough looking to be mistaken for one of those thousand dollar a night girls.}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It happens all the time lately.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And wear that short black number I bought you from Bendel's.}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Again?  I don't know if it's me or that dress you like.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Have a good day.  Make plenty of tips.  And leave the whole evening open.  She thinks I've got Knicks tickets.}
<ACTION>__{He hangs up.  Then whips a tiny cellular phone out of his jacket pocket, flips it open and dials.  Someone answers on the first ring.}
<CHAR>__{COLUMNIST } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{Speak!}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(into cellular)}
<DIAL>__{It's your boy Stuart.  When was the last time I called you for a favor?}
<CHAR>__{COLUMNIST } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{The column is already full.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I just need one line.  Anybody you wanna say was seen dining out at Mario's Stromboli restaurant.}
<CHAR>__{COLUMNIST } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{Maybe you don't hear so good?  I got no space for you.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Who's asking any favors?  I'm offering reciprocal information.}
<CHAR>__{COLUMNIST } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{Since when were you ever a reliable source?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Check it out.  Tony award-winning producer Willie Beagle tossed his wife back into rehab again following her third attempt at diving off the terrace at their plush eighteen room residence at the San Remo.  I got it from the doorman.}
<CHAR>__{COLUMNIST } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{I got it from their maid yesterday. It's in the paper today.  Or don't you bother to read my shit?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Louis, my intentions were entirely honorable.}
<CHAR>__{COLUMNIST } <CHAR_PAR>__{(V.O.)}
<DIAL>__{I'll drop your item in sometime next week.  If you promise not to call me for a month.}
<ACTION>__{He hangs up.  Stu looks pleased as he folds the cell phone and tucks it away. Then he starts to vacate the booth.  The phone rings.  And rings.  Curious, he picks up the receiver.  There's a voice on the other end of the line.  A DISTINCTIVE MALE VOICE.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Don't even think about leaving that booth.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Stay exactly where you are and listen carefully.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I've got a heavy day, mister.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You know better than to disobey me.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't know you at all.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Are you absolutely sure?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Who is this?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Someone who's watching you.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Get lost!}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Love the gray suit.  That red and black tie makes a nice combination.}
<ACTION>__{Stu is taken back by the accurate description of his apparel. He looks around nervously.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Where?  Where are you?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Closer than you think.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't see you.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{There are any number of windows. Check them out.}
<ACTION>__{Indeed that street corner is surrounded by high rise buildings and hotels.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Okay, you had your little joke.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm not sufficiently amused.  Not yet.  We have more to talk about.}
<ACTION>__{Stu knows he should simply hang up but something tells him not to.  Perhaps it's the strange tone of the man's voice.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Do me a favor.  Call up somebody else.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But it's you I'm interested in. You know how many people use that booth every day?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why don't you tell me?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Better than two-hundred people on average.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Is that what you do?  Count them?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What else do I have to do?  It's interesting watching people. Trying to guess who they are.  And what they're up to.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What are you -- a shut-in of some kind?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You might say that.  I can't go out.  I might be seen.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Somebody's looking for you?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Desperately.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The cops?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Not yet.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The ex-wife.  What'd you do -- run out on child support?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What kind of man do you think I am?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Frankly, I could care less.  You had your fun.  Now goodbye.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's not in your best interests to hang up on me.  That would make me angry.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Isn't that just too bad?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{For you.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{There's ten million names in the phonebook.  Pester somebody else.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I never talk to people I can't see. I need to study their reactions.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Alright, bullshit artist, what am I doing right now?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Scratching your forehead with your left hand.  Now you're brushing your hair back.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Okay, okay, you got me in your scrutiny.  So what?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So let's talk.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Only I got nothing to say.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, you will.  You'll do a lot of talking before this conversation is over.  And it'll only end when I want it to.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Is that a fact?  Well if you watch closely, you will see me hang up.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't think you will.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why not?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I interest you.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why should I be interested in some creep who gets his jollies spying on strangers in phone booths?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But you're not a stranger, Stu.}
<ACTION>__{The sound of his own name sends a chill through him.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Who put you up to this?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You were my very own selection.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why me in particular?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Because you're so afraid.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Ha!  What've I got to be afraid of?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Just about everything.  You have so much to hide.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How do you figure that?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why else would a man with a perfectly good cellular bother to make calls from a pay booth?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's my business.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I've made it mine.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{All of a sudden I'm required to give explanations to you?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{In explicit detail.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What is this?  Some kind of candid camera gag?  Or like that thing on HBO where the cab driver is taping what goes on in the back seat?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{This is not showbusiness, my friend.  This is reality.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Your reality.  Not mine, you lowlife fuck.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Stu, you'll be made to suffer for your attitude, so let's dispense with the vulgarities.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Now you're threatening me!  Fuck you.  Could that be any clearer?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're only making it easier for me to do you harm.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh yeah.  Right.  Can you see how I'm trembling?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You will be.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Shit, this is a new one.  Fucking threatening calls in a goddam phone booth.  When are you going to start with the heavy breathing.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm not the degenerate.  You are, Stu.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You don't know anything about me.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Infinitely more than you know about me.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Like what?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How would you know that?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm watching through a scope and I could clearly read the buttons you pushed.  I have another extension here by the window.  Shall I dial that same number back for you? Would that convince you?}
<ACTION>__{Stu nervously cranes his neck, looking around at all the tall buildings that surround the street corner. STU'S POV PANNING up at thousands of windows.  The Voice could be coming from anywhere.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{BACK TO STU IN THE BOOTH}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Let's see who's on the other end of the line.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Don't.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Too late.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(beat)}
<DIAL>__{It's already ringing.  I'll hold the receiver up so you can listen in.}
<ACTION>__{Stu can hear the beeping as the other line rings. Then Mavis' voice can be heard answering.  Stu listens helplessly.}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hello?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, hello.}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Who is this?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Someone who's really tight with your boyfriend -- who just called you from his favorite phone booth.}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You know Stu?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Stu?  Oh, I know him better than anyone.  What he does -- how he thinks.  How he lies.}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Who the hell is this?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Stu is listening in.  He knows what we're both saying.}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Stu?  Is that true?  Are you there?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He doesn't feel like talking.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(shouts)}
<DIAL>__{Mavis!  Just hang up the goddam phone.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{She can't hear you, Stu.  Only me.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(a pause)}
<DIAL>__{Mavis, I'm afraid Stu hasn't been totally honest with you.  But then he can't be honest with anyone, can he?}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What's your name?  To whom am I speaking?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You've never heard of me, Mavis. He doesn't want you to know I exist.  He wishes I didn't exist. But there isn't anything he can do about that.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(beat)}
<DIAL>__{Still there, Stu?  All you can do is listen.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Mavis -- the guy is a fucking nutcase!  Hang the fuck up.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{She doesn't want to.  She wants to know all about us.  Don't you, Mavis?}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Did his wife put you up to this? That bitch, Kelly?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh yes, the bitch wife, Kelly.  My very next call.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(yells)}
<DIAL>__{He doesn't know my wife!  Don't tell him anything else.}
<ACTION>__{Outside the booth, a huge, heavy-set black woman in a too tight dress, now appears with the clear desire to use the phone.  Her name is FELICIA.  She taps on the glass.}
<CHAR>__{FELICIA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Could you hurry it along?}
<ACTION>__{Stu ignores her and Felicia glares at him through the glass with hostility. Stu has no inclination to deal with anybody else.  He's too distracted by the madness happening over the telephone.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Can you hear me, Mavis?  Keep your big mouth shut.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Is that any way to talk to a woman you love?}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(beat)}
<DIAL>__{Mavis, is he always that abusive to you?}

<DIAL>__{You're getting me all upset.  I don't know who you are or how you know all this --}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I find out things -- from watching people and listening to them.}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Just what is your relationship to Stu?  That's all I want to know.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, what do you think?}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Answer me, goddam it!}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well alright.  Stu and I are -- longtime companions.  A pair.  Two of a kind.  Closer than close. Peas in a pod.  Spoons in a drawer.}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You pervert!}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That, too.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Don't believe a word of it.  It's all lies.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Too late, Stu.  She already believes it.}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You can tell that scumbag never to bother me again.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He won't care.  He'll still have me.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's not true.  I do care.}
<ACTION>__{From outside the booth, there's a louder rapping on the glass.  Felicia really wants in.}
<CHAR>__{FELICIA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Get done in there, mister.  I got me an important call.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Go away.}
<CHAR>__{FELICIA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Shit I will!  Finish up!}
<ACTION>__{She continues to rap on the glass as Stu tries to focus on the two-way phone call.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why don't you tell me what you think of us?}
<CHAR>__{MAVIS' VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're both disgusting.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's what he said about you. Well, if Stu didn't have the balls to come out and tell you the truth, I felt it was my responsibility to clear the air.  Goodbye now, Mavis. Thanks for your time.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(the phone clicks off; we hear only a dial tone)}
<DIAL>__{Back to you again, Stu.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You total asshole!  How could you do that?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Speaking of females, that woman hovering outside the booth -- may as well tell her that you'll be on the line forever.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Like hell I will.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm ready for you to take out your cellular and phone home.  And this time, I'll listen in.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{There's no chance of that.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Or should I call Kelly and make up something totally outrageous?  You must realize by now I have a vivid imagination.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You don't know our phone number!}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Are you absolutely sure?  I may have been watching you on a regular basis.  Keeping track of all the numbers I see you dial.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And I'm supposed to believe that?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I've put a great deal of preparation into this -- prior to actually saying hello.  Now do you want to dial 832-7165 -- or should I?}
<ACTION>__{The sound of the actual number being spoken shocks him even more than the earlier mention of his name.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What are you going to tell her?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You'll do the talking.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What am I supposed to say?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Try telling her the truth.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Look, I don't want to hurt Kelly. She's always there for me.  It's just my nature to have a little 'strange' on the side.  It doesn't mean shit.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But you still find it necessary?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Kind of like having a beautiful home.  With everything you ever dreamed of.  But you still need that vacation now and then.  Some nice hotel room with a great view. Maybe a pool.  Only you wouldn't want to spend more than a few days in any hotel.  Eventually, you want to go back to your home and all your stuff.  You're real glad to check out.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Kelly is home and Mavis is a hotel? I'm sure they'll both appreciate that explanation.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're ruining my fucking life, you sonofabitch.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Didn't I warn you about calling me names?  It makes me vindictive.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What else can you do to me?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We haven't even begun.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{She's not home.  She went out.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'll bet she's back.  Now hold the cellular up where I can see it -- so I can be certain you don't misdial on me.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(pause)}
<DIAL>__{A little higher and to your left. Now I have it in perfect view. Dial slowly.}
<ACTION>__{More violent rapping on the glass from the persistent black lady outside.}
<CHAR>__{FELICIA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{If you got you a cell phone, how come you taking up the whole fucking booth!  This here's an emergency!}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{There's another booth on the next block.}
<CHAR>__{FELICIA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It's busted.  Every damn phone on Eighth Avenue is busted but this one.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well, I'm not through!  Go in a restaurant or someplace, but get away from me!}
<CHAR>__{FELICIA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm gonna pull you out of that booth and snatch you ballheaded!}
<ACTION>__{She tries to pull open the sliding door to the booth but Stu jams it shut, right on her hand.}
<CHAR>__{FELICIA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You assaulted my person.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Let me hear from your lawyer!}
<CHAR>__{FELICIA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're hear alright.  I'm coming back.  And your ass better not be around.}
<ACTION>__{She stalks off obviously in search of assistance.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Good work, Stu.  Now let me see you dial.  Tuck the receiver under your chin and dial your remote.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm doing it.}
<ACTION>__{He punches in the digits.  The phone rings -- and rings.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I told you she was out.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Let it ring.}
<ACTION>__{Then a girl's voice is heard.}
<CHAR>__{KELLY'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Shepard residence.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hold it close to the receiver so I can hear.}
<CHAR>__{KELLY'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hello?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Honey, it's me.}
<CHAR>__{KELLY'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What's taking you so long?  I thought we were having some lunch at Mario's?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Change of plan.  We're not eating in that dump any more.}
<CHAR>__{KELLY'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How come?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The Health Department gave them a 'C' rating -- that's how come. Here I'm trying to put the place on the map and he fucks it all up with a major roach problem.}
<CHAR>__{KELLY'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's disgusting.  Okay, I'll fix us a sandwich.  Where are you now?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Just in a phone booth.}
<CHAR>__{KELLY'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How come?  The caller ID says you're on your cellular.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh yeah, I am.}
<CHAR>__{KELLY'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But you're also in some phone booth?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Explain that one, Stu.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I only stepped in because the traffic was so loud outside.}
<CHAR>__{KELLY'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well just hurry on back.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Tell her you can't.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Not for a few minutes.}
<CHAR>__{KELLY'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Are you sure you're alone?  I hear somebody in the background.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The guy in the next booth.  He's got a bad connection and he's hollering his fool head off.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You've got an answer for everything.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I love you, baby.}
<CHAR>__{KELLY'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Do you?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You know that.}
<CHAR>__{KELLY'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Stu -- who was that man?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What man?}
<CHAR>__{KELLY'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Some person who phoned fifteen minutes ago -- just after you went out.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't understand...}
<CHAR>__{KELLY'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{This total stranger rang up and told me to wait by the phone -- because you'd be calling me in a few minutes -- from a booth.  And I said what would he be doing in any phone booth?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And what did this guy say?}
<CHAR>__{KELLY'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He said you'd be making phone calls.  What else?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Making calls is part of my business.}
<CHAR>__{KELLY'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{To whom?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Clients.  People.  Planting items like I do.}
<CHAR>__{KELLY'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Women?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Once in a while one of them could be a woman.  I just called "Elaine's" and talked to her to see who was in there last night.}
<CHAR>__{KELLY'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You know exactly what I mean.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're not going to start that shit again?}
<CHAR>__{KELLY'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I just feel something is wrong.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What could be wrong?}
<CHAR>__{KELLY'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The way you sound.  You don't sound like yourself.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah?  Who do I sound like?}
<CHAR>__{KELLY'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Someone who's scared.  There's fear in your voice like I've never heard before.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{See, Stu?  Kelly agrees with me.}
<CHAR>__{KELLY'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I want you to come back home.  Now!}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I told you.  In a while.}
<CHAR>__{KELLY'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No.  I want you here now.  In case he calls back, I don't want to answer again.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why should he call back?}
<CHAR>__{KELLY'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I feel like he's going to.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're the one that sounds frightened.  And of nobody.}
<CHAR>__{KELLY'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He's not a nobody.  He knows about us.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're not telling me all he said. What are you holding back?}
<CHAR>__{KELLY'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I can't discuss it on the phone. Just get over here!}
<ACTION>__{CLICK!  She hangs up.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(into pay phone)}
<DIAL>__{Why did you do that to her?  She never did you any harm.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How would you know?  Everybody does harm to somebody.  And then they try their best to forget it.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Maybe me -- but not her.  Whatever I've done, there's no reason to take it out on her.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Suppose that's the only way I can get to you?  You claim you love her.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah, I do.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You don't even love yourself.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{But Kelly... I would never hurt.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Still you have to uphold your status as an honorary asshole.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Listen, I've treated all my women decent.  I never laid a hand on any of them, even when provoked.  And I always let them down easy.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(beat)}
<DIAL>__{I'm not ready to let Kelly go. Maybe I never will be.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What if she dumps you first? What's the odds she's already taken up with somebody?  One day soon you'll come home and find her gone along with the CD player and the VCR.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm not gonna let you mind-fuck me all day!  That's it.  This call is ended.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Not until I say it is.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What happens if I hang up?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You don't really want to find out.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm dying to hear this!!!  What the fuck can you do about it -- up in your fucking high window with your goddam binoculars?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I never indicated I had binoculars. I said I had a highly magnified telescopic image of you that brought you up so close I could see where you nicked yourself under the chin shaving this morning.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh -- while you're at it, have a look up my ass.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I may very well do that, Stu.  In the meantime, think about what kind of device has a telescopic sight mounted on it.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What?  You mean... like a rifle?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{A high-powered .30 calibre bolt action Remington 700 with a carbon one modification and a state of the art Henzholdt tactical sniperscope. And you're in the cross hairs, Stu.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm supposed to believe that?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{There's only one way I can prove it to you.  Hang up the receiver and find out.  At this range, the exit wound ought to be about the size of a small tangerine.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And you're just going to kill me for no reason?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{For plenty of reasons!  Because you hung up.  For years I hated people hanging up on me.  Ex-girlfriends. Women I didn't even know. Prospective employers.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I get hung up on all the time.  You get used to it.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Or else you don't.  I worked for months getting people to switch to MCI -- being insulted at and being hung up on hundreds of times a day. The ones that cursed me out for invading their privacy never bothered me as much as those that clicked off without even bothering to reply.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Then why didn't you go after one of them?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Maybe you are one of them.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey, I have worked in a boiler room myself peddling "Term Life."  I Would never be rude to a fellow salesperson.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Can you feel it on you now?  The heat of it.  I'm moving the strike zone down to your stomach area. Now I'm raising it up again. Directly above the chest cavity -- sliding up to the forehead just above the left ear.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Shit -- I do feel it.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Tell me where I'm going with it now.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Across my forehead -- now back where it was before.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm amazed how you can do that. You're amazingly accurate.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(beat)}
<DIAL>__{Now I know what you're thinking. If I drop down on the floor of the booth and flatten myself out...}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, I'm not thinking that.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh yes you are.  Can I crawl out using the booth as a shield?  Can I crawl to that Chrysler illegally parked only three or four feet away?  The shattering glass may cut me, but it'll only be superficial. Otherwise, this lunatic will never let me out alive.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No.  You will.  I know you will. If I just cooperate.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Where is it now?  Think and feel for the warm spot.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Below the shoulder?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Which one?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The right shoulder.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Remarkable how we're in tune. You're doing far better than the others.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What others?  What do you mean?}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(no reply)}
<DIAL>__{You said 'others!'}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(finally)}
<DIAL>__{I'm sure you read about the Italian tourist shot dead ten days ago at the corner of Forty-fifth and Eighth?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I saw it on the news.}

<DIAL>__{That your connection on the end of the line?  Or are you dealing?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{Next thing you know you're gonna claim we mugged you -- took your billfold and watch.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No, you didn't.  It was a fair and equitable deal.  You had territorial rights to this booth and I paid a license fee.  Fair is fair.  Now leave me in peace.}
<CHAR>__{LEON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You sure you're alright?}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to Felicia)}
<DIAL>__{He don't look well.}
<CHAR>__{FELICIA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Kind of pale.  Even for a white man.}
<CHAR>__{LEON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Jaundice they calls it.  Probably advanced liver trouble.}

<DIAL>__{If it's cirrhosis, you better find yourself a twelve step program and quick.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thanks for your interest but I'm in perfect health.}
<CHAR>__{FELICIA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So how come his hand is shaking?}
<CHAR>__{LEON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The man is cracking up.}
<CHAR>__{FELICIA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Lookit the sweat pouring off the sonofabitch.  That's one sick mother you started up with, Leon!}
<CHAR>__{LEON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Me?  You're the one that brought me over and exposed me to all his germs.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm terminal, okay?  Now can I close the booth and continue my conversation?}
<CHAR>__{LEON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm worried now it might be catching.  All that money out of your sweaty pocket is probably crawling with some rare and incurable disease.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Fine.  Give it back.}
<CHAR>__{LEON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well go wash your hands.}
<CHAR>__{LEON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Come on now.  Own up to what you're carrying.  Is it some of that sexually transmitted shit?  Cause in that case, we can relax.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm sick of you.  Now get out of my face.}
<CHAR>__{LEON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Here we's being solicitous as to your health and you respond by heaping abuse!}
<CHAR>__{FELICIA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Whip his arrogant ass.}

<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Touch me and I'll throw up on you.}
<ACTION>__{At the suggestion, Leon lets go quickly. It looks like a stalemate.  Stu isn't vacating the booth and Leon and his lady are reluctant to touch him further.  He does indeed look sick.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(into pay phone)}
<DIAL>__{You can see what I'm up against here.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What do you have in mind?}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'll think of something.}
<ACTION>__{Suddenly the red dot reappears on the forehead of the pimp. Leon doesn't realize it's there.  The hooker behind him has no way of seeing it.  But to Stu, there's no way to miss it. He reacts.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{God -- no.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(into pay phone)}
<DIAL>__{Don't.  It's not necessary.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{I'll handle it myself.}
<CHAR>__{VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're not doing too well.  I can settle it in a fraction of a second.  Shall I demonstrate?}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{No.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(to Leon)}
<DIAL>__{For your own safety, mister, just walk away.}
<CHAR>__{LEON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Now the man is turning aggressive... issuing threats upon my person.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're making this happen.}
<CHAR>__{LEON} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{If you don't hang up and step out, I'm about to topple this booth into the gutter with you inside it.}
<ACTION>__{Reluctant to touch Stu again, Leon assaults the booth itself. He begins shaking it violently -- trying to rip it from its foundation.  And the rickety booth is not too sturdy.  It starts rocking back and forth. Stu is thrown around inside it, barely keeping his footing.}
<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(into pay phone)}
<DIAL>__{This isn't my fault.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(shouts)}
<DIAL>__{Stop that!}
<ACTION>__{But Leon continues rocking the booth.  It won't come loose -- so in frustration, he punches in a side pane of glass. The glass shatters all around Stu, who does his best to shield himself from the slivers.}

<CHAR>__{FELICIA} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Don't cut yourself, honey.}

<CHAR>__{STU} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yes.}
<ACTION>__{Stu sees the red dot reappear on Leon's chest as he continues to barrage the booth with punches and kicks. Then Leon recoils, staggers a step backward.  He doesn't realize he's been shot. There's been no sound of gunfire.  Perhaps a silencer was used -- or the downtown traffic drowned out the solitary discharge. Leon looks confused at first.  His ladyfriend has no idea he's wounded -- neither do the derelicts and street people who've assembled on the corner. Even Stu isn't sure -- until the blood starts oozing from the wound on the pimp's chest -- staining his yellow vest. He isn't assaulting the booth anymore.  He's trying to keep his balance.  He slumps forward, hanging onto the booth for support -- only a few inches from Stu's face.  The blood runs down the side of the booth.}

In the distance, we hear the maddening HONKING of uptown traffic that is now being rerouted, creating a huge bottleneck and raising the anger of irate motorists and bus drivers whose horns provide their simplest form of protest.
