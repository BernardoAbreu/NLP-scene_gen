<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{int papal apartment day}
<A>__{inside the papal apartments, robert langdon sits stiffly on a straight backed chair in a hallway. couldn't look more uncomfortable if he tried. a swiss guardsman stands on either side of him. the door to his right suddenly opens, another guardsman nods to him, and langdon gets to his feet, straightening his jacket.}
<L>__{int office of the pope day}
<A>__{langdon is shown into the office, where a robed figure is being dressed by two vatican attendants the clothes he dons are unmistakably papal vestments. the figure, his back to us, gestures to a nearby table. one of the swiss guardsmen goes to the table and picks up an envelope, hands it to langdon.}
<C>__{swiss guardsman}
<D>__{a token of thanks from his holiness.}
<A>__{langdon, puzzled, opens the envelope and lets the contents fall into his hand. it's a thin volume, but a familiar one the only surviving copy of galileo's diagramma. langdon nearly gasps. the figure in the papal robes turn around. it is, of course, cardinal mortati.}
<C>__{mortati}
<D>__{this should help you complete your scholarly work, professor.}
<A>__{langdon is too stunned to speak,}
<C>__{mortati }
<D>__{i ask only that in your last will and testament you ensure it finds its way home.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{i yes, i of course.}
<A>__{mortati takes a few steps forward, studying langdon,}
<C>__{mortati}
<D>__{when you write of us and you will write of us may i ask one thing?}
<A>__{langdon looks at him questioningly.}
<C>__{mortati }
<D>__{do so gently?}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{i will try.}
<C>__{mortati}
<D>__{religion is flawed, mr. langdon, but only because man is flawed. including this one.}
<A>__{he touches his chest lightly. the aides now pick up the miter, the spade shaped papal hat. he stands still while they place it on his head, completing his attire.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{i hear you've chosen the name luke. there have been marks and johns, but never a luke.}
<C>__{mortati}
<D>__{it's said he was a doctor.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{is that a message? science and faith all in one?}
<C>__{mortati}
<D>__{the world is in need of both. science can heal, or science can kill. it depends on the soul of the man using the science.}
<A>__{langdon looks at him. likes the sound of that.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{you'll lead wisely.}
<C>__{mortati}
<D>__{i'm an old man. i will lead briefly,}
<A>__{mortati comes closer to langdon, raises his right hand, and makes a gentle sign of the cross over him, murmuring softly.}
<C>__{mortati }
<D>__{thanks be to god, for sending someone to protect his church.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{i don't believe he sent me, father.}
<C>__{mortati}
<D>__{oh, my son...}
<A>__{he smiles.}
<C>__{mortati }
<D>__{of course he did.}
<A>__{he turns, and his aides part the billowing silk curtains that lead to the papal balcony. we move forward with him as he steps out over st. peter's square and a great roar rises up from below. cardinal mortati, pope luke i, holds his arms out to his sides, an embrace to take in the world and behind him, hidden in the shadows of the papal apartment, just behind the billowing curtains, robert langdon folds his hand in front of him and bows his head.}
