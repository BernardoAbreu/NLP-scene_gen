<L>__{86: interior crime lab. police station. day.}
<A>__{berlin and his dummy wearing a bra and his photographs and his rage are all alone. and that's how they wanna be. but the door opens and here is ross. have to be a friend to survive in here.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{nothing you gotta say do i wanna hear right now. so save yourself saying it.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{i'm not in here to apologize, john. i told you what was gonna happen & it's happened? "good bye, princess," & the same night she gets attacked? that's a tough one to swallow, bro?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i'm already familiar with taylor's opinion.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{you don't really believe this?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{one hundred fucking per cent! .. and you know why? coz i never told her good bye. ok.? is that good enough for the "committee?"}
<A>__{and as long as you like evaporates before ross can speak again.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{well .. i didn't know that ..}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{no .. you didn't know that ..}
<A>__{berlin is drinking whisky. sticks another slug in the cup. now realizes whose bottle this is. slams it somewhere on the bench.}
<D>__{here. you left your booze in here.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{who d'you think it was?}
<A>__{ross gets the kind of smile a smart guy wouldn't give an idiot.}
<D>__{you think it was him?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{that's a very stupid question, ross.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{i'm asking it.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{how the hell do i know who? some jerk off. some peeping tom prick.}
<A>__{his hand has found the switch blade. a nasty click as it opens.}
<D>__{.. but definitely not him. this guy's in the trade. he's not gon na stand there looking at her ass, if he's in the room, she's dead ..}
<A>__{berlin puts the knife in his dummy. if she's alive. she's dead.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{ease off, john ..}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i'm sick of this toy town shit.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{everything you say sounds reason able. but there's also a reason able explanation for the opposite.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{don't give me that! not another word! when you had the fat lady in there, and i asked you if she was lying, you looked me right in the eyes and said yes. so as far as i was concerned, she's ly ing. and if the king of fucking england had walked in & told me different, i wouldn't have bel ieved him because you told me ..}
<A>__{this atmosphere would stretch any friendship to breaking pointerior}
<D>__{and now i'm telling you. i'm looking you right in the eyes and telling ya, there's a "bad man" out there, and i don't know if he's in the next room, or the next state: and i don't know what his trigger is? but if he reads her name in the newspaper, i believe he'll be inclined to do something ab out it. i've got a bad feeling. and i been doing this too long to be wrong.}
<A>__{there are tough eyes to look into. and ross finally looks away.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{i dunno what i can do to help you?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{i dunno what i'd do with your help. i've gotta take her out of there ..}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{what about citrine?}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{screw citrine. he can fire me.}
