<L>__{ext day: genco olive oil co. (summer 1945)}
<A>__{an unimposing little building in new york city on mott street with a large old sign: "genco olive oil imports, inc." next to an open faced fruit market. a dark buick pulls up, and a single small man, whom we cannot see well because of the distance, gets out and enters the building. this is virgil sollozzo.}
<L>__{int day: olive oil offices (summer 1945)}
<A>__{looking toward the staircase we can hear sollozzo's footsteps before he actually rises into view. he is a small man, very dark, with curly black hair. but wiry, and tight and hard, and obviously very dangerous. he is greeted at the head of the stairs by sonny, who takes his hand and shakes it, introducing himself. for a moment, there is a complex of handshaking quite formal, and whispered respectful introductions. finally, sollozzo is taken into the don's glass paneled office; the two principals are introduced. they are very respectful of one another. folding chairs are brought in by freddie, and soon they are all sitting around in a circle; the don, sollozzo, sonny, hagen, freddie, clemenza and tessio. the don is the slightest bit foolish with all his compatriots, whereas sollozzo has brought no one. throughout all that transpires, however, it is clear that this scene is between two men: sollozzo and don corleone.}
<C>__{sollozzo}
<D>__{my business is heroin, i have poppy fields, laboratories in narseilles and sicily, ready to go into production. my importing methods are as safe as these things can be, about five per cent loss. the risk is nothing, the profits enormous.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{why do you come to me? why do i deserve your generosity?}
<C>__{sollozzo}
<D>__{i need two million dollars in cash...more important, i need a friend who has people in high places; a friend who can guarantee that if one of my employees be arrested, they would get only light sentences. be my friend.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{what percentages for my family?}
<C>__{sollozzo}
<D>__{thirty per cent. in the first year your share would be four million dollars; then it would go up.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{and what is the percentage of the tattaglia family?}
<A>__{sollozzo nods toward hagen.}
<C>__{sollozzo}
<D>__{my compliments. i will take care of them from my share.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{so. i receive 30 per cent just for finance and legal protection. no worries about operations, is that what you tell me?}
<C>__{sollozzo}
<D>__{if you think two million dollars in cash is just finance, i congratulate you don corleone.}
<A>__{there is a long silence; in which each person present feels the tension. the don is about to give his answer.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{i said i would see you because i've heard you're a serious man, to be treated with respect...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{but i will say no to you.}
<A>__{we feel this around the room.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{i will give you my reasons. i have many, many friends in politics. but they wouldn't be so friendly if my business was narcotics instead of gambling. they think gambling is something like liquor, a harmless vice...and they think narcotics is dirty business.}
<A>__{sollozzo takes a breath.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{no...how a man makes his living is none of my business. but this proposition of yours is too risky. all the people in my family lived well the last ten years, i won't risk that out of greed.}
<C>__{sollozzo}
<D>__{are you worried about security for your million?}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{sollozzo}
<D>__{the tattaglias will guarantee your investment also.}
<A>__{this startles sonny; he blurts out.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{the tattaglia family guarantees our investment?}
<A>__{sollozzo hears him first, and then very slowly turns to face him. everyone is the room knows that sonny has stepped out of line.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{young people are greedy, and they have no manners. they speak when they should listen. but i have a sentimental weakness for my children, and i've spoiled them, as you see. but signor sollozzo, my no is final.}
<A>__{sollozzo nods, understands that this is the dismissal. he glances one last time at sonny. he rises; all the others do as well. he bows to the don, shakes his hand, and formally takes his leave. when the footsteps can no longer be heard: the don turns to sonny.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{santino, never let anyone outside the family know what you are thinking. i think your brain is going soft from all that comedy you play with that young girl.}
<A>__{two office workers are carrying an enormous floral display with the word "thank you" spelled out in flowers.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{what is this nonsense?}
<C>__{hagen}
<D>__{it's from johnny. it was announced this morning. he's going to play the lead in the new woltz brothers film.}
