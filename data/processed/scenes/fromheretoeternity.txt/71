<L>__{exterior choy's night}
<B>__{medium shot}
<A>__{as prew carves out. choy's is on a wide road across from the entrance to the post. prew looks around for warden, sees him off to one side. camera moves with prew as he goes over to him.}
<B>__{close shot warden}
<A>__{leaning against the building, undergoing a delayed reaction to the fierce moment in choy's. he is white faced, sweating heavily. he looks as if he's going to be sick.}
<B>__{close shot prew}
<A>__{astonished yet appreciative that under warden's confidence and control in choy's there has been a human frailty.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{... that was a near thing.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{... yeah.}
<A>__{prew holds out fatso's knife. warden is beginning to get control of himself; he manages a weak smile.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{you keep it, kid. keep it for a souvenir.}
<A>__{prew puts the knife in his pocket. they stare at one another a few moments, each inarticulate, each wanting to express some deep emotion of respect.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{you ain't enjoying life much, are you, kid?}
<C>__{prew}
<P>__{(thin smile)}
<D>__{they can kill you but they can't eat you, top.}
<A>__{warden studies prew thoughtfully. prew turns to go back into choy's.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{prewitt.}
<A>__{prew stops, turns back.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{could you stand a weekend pass?}
<A>__{prew stares at him for a second, incredulously, unable to find his voice.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{i thought }
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{you thought what, kid?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{how about dynamite?}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{leave dynamite to me. he signs most anything i put in front of him `thout readies it.}
<A>__{though prew is overjoyed he is somehow unable to say "thanks"; warden grins broadly at him.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{i hear you gone dippy over some dame you met at the new congress club.}
<A>__{he slaps prew on the shoulder roughly.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{what'd you say her name was?}
<C>__{frew}
<D>__{lorene...}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{pretty name.}
<A>__{warden walks off across the street. prew stares after him.}
