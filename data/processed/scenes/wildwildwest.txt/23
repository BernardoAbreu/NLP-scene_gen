<D>__{backwards ass bumpkins got a wagon full of nitro...!}
<A>__{west tries to steady the glass vials with his hands... but it's no use. he quickly climbs over the boxes, onto the buckboard seat. but the reins are dragging on the ground beneath the frothing horses. west leaps onto the horses as the wagon careens down the street. he pulls himself over the first one's neck... onto the next horse. and as he tries for the lead horse, he falls between them!}
