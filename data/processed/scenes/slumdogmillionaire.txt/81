<L>__{exterior slum. day.}
<A>__{jamal gets out of a new mercedes driven by an indian man. a middle aged american couple also get out. jamal points them down a lane which opens out on india's largest dhobi where hundreds of women are beating clothes on stone slabs.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{this is the biggest dhobi ghat in the whole of india, mister david.}
<C>__{jamal }
<D>__{they say that every man in uttar pradesh is wearing a kurta that has been washed here at least one time.}
<C>__{clark}
<D>__{is that so? that's amazing. let's get a look at this, adele.}
<A>__{he gets out his video camera and wanders towards the dhobi ghat. behind them a motor rickshaw pulls up. salim, shankar and a couple of the street kids from the taj leap out. within seconds, the mercedes is up on bricks and the wheels are being removed. salim takes a hacksaw to the mercedes badge on the bonnet, whilst urging the others on.}
<C>__{salim}
<D>__{are, sala! formula one, formula one! pit stop ka speed, schumacher ka ishtyle}
<A>__{the crowds in the lane barely notice as the car is stripped of all its parts.}
<C>__{salim }
<D>__{go, go!}
<A>__{a shout from the top of the lane and the boys scatter, bouncing the four wheels at speed down the lane. jamal, the indian driver and the two americans return. they stop in front of the denuded car.}
<C>__{clark}
<D>__{woah. what happened here?}
<A>__{suddenly the indian driver is slapping jamal ferociously around the head with one of his shoes.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{i give you two tight slaps, mader chod!}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{i don't know! i didn't do it, did i...? nothing to do with me...get off!}
<A>__{but the beating continues, the driver kicking jamal down onto the floor. the two americans stare, uncertain what to do.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{do something, clark.}
<C>__{clark}
<D>__{well, i i dunno, i }
<A>__{finally clark intervenes, pulling the driver off jamal.}
<C>__{clark }
<D>__{okay, okay, just cool it. you're insured, aren't you? jesus christ...}
<A>__{jamal sits up. he is bleeding from his nose and mouth.}
<C>__{clark }
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{you wanted to see the `real india', mister david. here it is.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{well, here's a bit of the real america, too, son.}
