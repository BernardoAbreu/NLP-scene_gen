<L>__{interior forsythe's apartment night}
<A>__{in the kitchen, a thick paperbound book called guide to gourmet cooking lies open and face down on the kitchen counter next to the sink. there are a couple of pots and pans heating on the stove. forsythe picks up the book, then opens one of the pots to check something. she is obviously taking a lot of care with st. luc's late supper. she puts the lid back on the pot, reads a bit more, then checks the time on an electric clock on the counter. she opens the oven door, then takes a bone handled carving fork from a carving set and begins to prod at a roast in a ceramic roasting dish. someone knocks on the door. forsythe leaves her oven and goes to answer it, carving fork in hand. she opens the door. kresimir sviben stands in the hallway, eyes wide, insane smile on his face. he looks at forsythe as though she were a piece of steak.}
<C>__{forsythe}
<D>__{yes?}
<A>__{kresimir doesn't answer. he begins to drool, his mouth working as though in anticipation of a meal. forsythe gets a little nervous.}
<C>__{forsythe}
<D>__{can i... can i help you?}
<A>__{kresimir approaches. he is visibly shaking.}
<C>__{kresimir}
<P>__{(speaking with difficulty)}
<D>__{yes... you can... help me.}
<A>__{without warning, he lunges for forsythe, who vainly tries to slam the door in his face. kresimir pushes his way past the door and grabs forsythe by the back of the head, trying to kiss her and drooling. forsythe breaks away and runs toward the bathroom, intending to lock herself in. kresimir throws himself at her legs, managing to grab one of her feet. she doesn't fall, but holds on to a cabinet and tries to pull free. kresimir begins to climb up her body. forsythe, terrified and gasping for breath, plunges the long, curved prongs of the carving fork into kresimir's shoulder. he screams with pain and loosens his grip on forsythe long enough for her to pull away, leaving her apron and part of her dress in kresimir's hands. she runs for the door and is gone. kresimir, still on his knees, holds the apron and the piece of dress to his face, breathing in forsythe's fragrance. he begins to shuffle toward the door on his knees, kissing the clothes in his hands, mumbling and moaning.}
