<A>__{a ferry comes into the dock, as a plank is slowly lowered. as it descends, four rail cars lie in wait in its belly. johana comes off the boat, carrying her suitcase, she wears a light summer dress. she looks around, seeming a little lost. a white fiat taxi screeches to a halt beside her. johana jumps. the driver whose arm loosely dangles from the car window, grins at her.}
