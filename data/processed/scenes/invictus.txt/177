<L>__{exterior township day}
<A>__{the same township where sipho rejected the springbok rugby jersey. at one edge we find what passes for a soccer field. just a littered rectangular expanse of highveld winter dirt. tv vans and a very nervous springbok management crew drive to the edge of the field, stop, get out and are immediately mobbed by threadbare, excited kids, many of them begging for cash and candy. sipho in the thick of things. one of the springbok management crew pulls a rolled banner on two spiked poles out of their van. mallet and banner in hand, the management crew head to the edge of the field, mobbed by shouting, whistling township kids. they hammer one pole into the ground, unroll the banner (seen from the back so that we can't read the words), get set to hammer the second pole into the ground except that there is a smashed beer bottle in the way. broken glass everywhere. they look at the broken glass, then turn and look across the field. broken glass glints in the low sun, all over the field.}
