<A>__{rachel sits in a cubicle. she takes the black case from her handbag and opens it. inside is a pen. she lifts this and the false bottom of the case away to reveal a hypodermic needle and an ampule of a clear liquid. with trembling hands she begins to prepare the injection. she can't quite believe what she is about to do.}

<A>__{rachel enters the room. the curtains are drawn and rachel hesitates for a moment, her eyes adjusting to the gloom. a man sits in a chair, angled towards the window, his back to us. an iv drip hangs on a stand, its tube running into a cannula on the back of a withered hand which hangs from the chair. the only sound is the faint, rasping breath of the man. rachel moves a little closer. on the bottom of the bed hangs a medical chart. the name reads ivan schevchuk. rachel moves closer, carefully taking the hypodermic needle from her pocket.}
