<B>__{speeder lot}
<A>__{ben and luke are standing in a sleazy used speeder lot, talking with a tall, grotesque, insect like used speeder dealer. strange exotic bodies and spindly legged beasts pass by as the insect concludes the sale by giving luke some coins.}

<D>__{he says it's the best he can do. since the xp 38 came out, they're just not in demand.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{it will be enough.}
<A>__{ben and luke leave the speeder lot and walk down the dusty alleyway past a small robot herding a bunch of anteater like creatures. luke turns and gives one last forlorn look at his faithful speeder as he rounds a corner. a darkly clad creature moves out of the shadows as they pass and watches them as they disappear down another alley.}
