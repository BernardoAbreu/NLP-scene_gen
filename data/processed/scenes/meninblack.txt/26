<L>__{exterior farmhouse night}
<A>__{stillness. silence. a loud scraping sound comes from the pit left by the spaceship. the nose of the ship itself rises up out of the pit, wavers, keeps moving, and finally crunches to the ground outside the pit. edgar climbs out of the pit, breathing heavily. he dusts himself off and continues pushing the ship, along the ground, off into the darkness.}

<L>__{exterior mib building day}
<A>__{the next morning. edwards, holding the small mib business card in his hand, compares the address written down by kay to the address on the utterly nondescript building in front of him. it's seven stories high, gray, windowless, perfectly square, squatting on a bridge over a road like a fat guy on the john.}
<D>__{"504 battery drive."}
<L>__{interior mib building tunnel vent room day}
<A>__{edwards steps through a heavily barred metal door and into long, bizarre room. one wall is entirely dominated by the enormous blades of a tunnel vent air intake. there is an elevator at the far end of the room and an old security guard, the rent a cop kind, reading a comic book on a folding metal chair halfway across. edwards walks across the room, his footsteps echoing. the guard looks up.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{help you?}
<C>__{edwards}
<D>__{maybe, i'm not sure, see, i got this card }
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{elevator. push the "call" button.}
<A>__{and he goes back to his comic book. edwards, maybe out of nothing more than curiosity at this point, walks across the room, toward the elevator. as he draws close, the elevator doors whoosh open, expecting him.}
