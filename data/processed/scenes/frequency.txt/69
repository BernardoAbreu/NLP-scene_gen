<L>__{interior buxton warehouse dusk 1969}
<A>__{frank and gibson step into the warehouse. butch behind them. flames haven't reached this area yet, but the roar of the fire above them is deafening, and smoke billows down the stairway before them. they sprint towards it and start up. one floor. two floors. three floors, and suddenly they are face to face with a wall of fire blocking access to the 4th floor. frank and gibson stop and stare into the inferno.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it looks open on the other side.}
<C>__{gibson}
<D>__{don't know what's behind it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{one way to find out.}
<A>__{and he barrels through the line of fire onto the 4th floor. gibson starts to do the same when the 5th floor gives way above frank, sending burning timber and debris cascading around him and cutting off gibson's route. now frank's only way to go is up the stairs toward the 5th floor. he turns to gibson. coming up behind him is butch. across a gulf of flames frank yells and waves at them to get the hell out. and then suddenly, part of the 3rd floor around gibson and butch starts to go.}
<C>__{frank }
<P>__{(screaming over fire)}
<D>__{get out...while you still can...}
<A>__{frank turns and bolts for the 5th floor as a huge flaming beam crashes down onto the stairway behind him, forcing gibson and butch to scramble like hell back down the stairs.}
<C>__{frank }
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{...it's not your time.}
