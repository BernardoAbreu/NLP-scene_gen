<A>__{sam's car is parked on the street in front of an expensive looking house in a tree lined neighborhood }
<L>__{interior living room}
<A>__{sam's ex wife, bunny kincaid, shuffles across her living room in slippers, crossing to turn off a big screen tv playing football highlights. bunny wears shorts, a houston oilers sweatshirt and a dallas cowboys cap. the living room is like a sports museum signed footballs, team posters, a bookcase filled with tapes of texas pro and college football games }
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{the longhorns gonna kick some serious butt this saturday, you just watch. we got a kid at tailback from down your way outta el indio }
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{that's in maverick county.}
<A>__{she brings us to sam, sitting uncomfortably, beneath a full sized blowup of tony dorsett hurdling a tackler }
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{oh. right. and you're in ?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{rio. bunny right. this kid, hosea brown? does tire 40 in 3.4, soft hands, lateral movement the whole package. only a sophomore }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you still going to all the home games?}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{well, daddy's got his box at the stadium, of course, and i will fly to the cowboy away games when they're in the conference. then there's the high school on friday' nights. west side got a boy 6'6", 310, moves like a cat. high school, we're talkin'. guess how much he can bench press?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{bunny, you uhm you on that same medication?}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{do i seem jumpy?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no, you look good. i was just wondering.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{last year was awful rough mama passing on and the whole business with o.j. i mean it's not like it was don meredith or roger staubach or one of our own boys, but it really knocked me for a loop }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you look good }
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{ and that squeaker the aggies dropped to oklahoma sonofabitch stepped in some lucky shit before he kicked that goal }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{yeah, well }
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{ they hadn't pulled me off that woman i would have jerked a knot in her.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you were in a fight }
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{daddy calls it an "altercation." how you doing, sam? you look skinny.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{same weight i always was.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{you look awful good in that uniform, though.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{best part of the job.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{daddy hired a pinhead to take your job. he says so himself. says "even my son in law was better than this pinhead i got now".}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{bunny, is that stuff i left in the garage still there?}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{least he never called me that. with me, it was always "high strung." "my bunny might have done something with her life, she wasn't so high strung." or "tightly wound," that was another one. you seeing anyone?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no. you?}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{yeah. sort of. daddy rounds 'em up. you aren't talking about money, their beady little eyes go dead.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you didn't uhm you didn't have one of your fires, did you? the stuff i left in the garage some of it was my father's }
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{you watch the draft this year? 'course you didn't, idiot question. they try to make it dramatic, like there's some big surprise who picks who in the first round? only they been working it over with their experts and their computers for months. doctor's reports, highlight reels, coaches' evaluations, psychological profiles hell, i wouldn't be surprised if they collected stool samples on these boys, have 'em analyzed. all this stuff to pick a football player for your squad. compared to that, what you know about the person you get married to don't amount to diddly, does it?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{suppose not.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{you kind of bought yourself a pig in a poke, didn't you, sam? all that time we were first seeing each other you didn't know i was tightly wound }
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it wasn't just you, bunny.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{no, it wasn't, was it? you didn't exactly throw yourself into it heart and soul, did you?}
<A>__{she looks at him for an uncomfortably long moment }
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{your shit's still in the garage if that's what you came for.}
<A>__{sam nods, stands. bunny is in tears }
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{350 pounds.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{this boy from west side, plays tackle both ways. bench presses 350 pounds. you imagine having that much weight on top of you? pushing down? be hard to breathe. hard to swallow.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. a spotter.}
<C>__{bunny}
<D>__{"i only got my little girl now," he says, "she's my lifeline." then he tells me i can't be in the box anymore if i can't control myself. sonofabitch don't even watch the damn game, just sits there drinking with his bidness friends, look up at the tv now and then. i do better to sit in the cheap seats with some real football people.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(edging out)}
<D>__{you look good, bunny. it's nice to see you.}
<C>__{bunny}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{thanks. i like it when you say that, sam.}
