<A>__{after dinner, murphy, greer, dodge and epps sit around the galley table.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{then why didn't they take it.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{probably didn't have time.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{or somebody stopped them.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{either way, they must've had a pretty good reason.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{must be a damn good reason to jump ship and leave fifty million dollars aboard.}
<A>__{a beat as they consider it.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{so what're we gonna do. that's the big question, right?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{a salvage claim to a vessel's cargo's as valid as a claim to the vessel itself. it's ours.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{then we're rich. we're damn, filthy stinking rich.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{it looks like it.}
<A>__{a beat as they let this sink in.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{so what? we gonna unload the gold and get a move on?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{we leave it where it is. stick to the plan.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{you gotta be kidding? what the hell we need that tub for, we got fifty million bucks?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{so we get a little more for the boat. besides, the gold'll be safer where it is.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{yeah, but we still gotta haul that big piece of shit all the way back to sitka.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{it's worth the effort. believe me. besides we're gonna need her to prove the salvage.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{why not call for help?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{for now the best thing we can do is to keep quiet about this.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{last thing we want is extra partners.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{or uninvited guests.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{i heard that.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{dodge, you gotta get on those repairs.}
<C>__{dodge}
<D>__{yeah, yeah. i'm on it.}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{the sooner we get under way, the sooner we are to spending what's ours.}
