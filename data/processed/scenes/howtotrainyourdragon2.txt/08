<A>__{a slow motion, sexy pov of eret's glistening biceps, shuddering as he blasts the net cannon, aimed directly at her.}
<C>__{ruffnut }
<D>__{oh, my.}
<A>__{the net unravels in slow motion...}
<C>__{ruffnut }
<D>__{me likey.}
<A>__{... enveloping ruffnut as she yields to it, blissfully.}
<C>__{ruffnut }
<D>__{take me.}
<B>__{back to real time}
<A>__{as hiccup flips upside down in the hookfang's talons and kicks off, pulling his wing suit flaps. eret takes aim, but astrid shoves him, throwing off the shot.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{hold your fire!}
<A>__{hiccup glides unsteadily towards the ship and collides with its sail. he slides down the canvas and drops to the deck. toothless lands behind him.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{what are you guys doing here?!}
<A>__{gobber and grump land on the deck, scattering eret's crew.}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{we're here to rescue you!}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{i don't need to be rescued!}
<C>__{stoick }
<D>__{enough!}
<A>__{the bow dips heavily as stoick touches down on skullcrusher. he dismounts, fuming. eret blocks stoick, cocky and confident.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{well, didn't you just pick the wrong ship, eh? i am eret, son of }
<A>__{stoick shoves his face aside, sending eret slamming into grump. before he can react, gobber clubs eret on the head, sending him collapsing to the deck. grump then sits on him, smothering him into submission.}
<C>__{eret }
<P>__{(panting, suffocated)}
<D>__{get... this... thing... off... me!}
<A>__{gobber turns to the other crewmen, with a smile.}
<C>__{gobber}
<D>__{anyone else?}
<A>__{eret's men eye the vikings, armed and flanked by their dragons. they set down their swords.}
<C>__{gobber }
<D>__{that's what i figured.}
<C>__{stoick}
<P>__{(to hiccup)}
<D>__{you. saddle up. we're going home.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{of all the irresponsible }
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{ i'm trying to protect our dragons and stop a war! how is that irresponsible?}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{because war is what he wants, son!}
<A>__{hiccup glares, frustrated. stoick sighs, realizing that he has to explain.}
<C>__{stoick }
<D>__{years ago, there was a great gathering of chieftains to discuss the dragon scourge we all faced.}
