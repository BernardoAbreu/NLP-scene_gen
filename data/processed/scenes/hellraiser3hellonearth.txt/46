<D>__{back at camera) the box. i don't know where it came from. i don't know who made it or why. i only know what it does. it hurts. it hurts. (looks off to side as if listening.) how? (looks back) i don't know. it kind of opens itself. your fingers move. you learn. it wants to open, that's the thing. and it knows when you want to open it. and it helps. and it opens. and then they come. the cenobites. the demons.}

<A>__{multiple images of kirsty speaking those last few lines. suddenly, one and only one of the monitors suffers a white noise wipe out. joey glances up at the one ghosting monitor, puzzled and then freezes in shock.}
<B>__{angle on monitors}
<A>__{ as, on the one monitor, a new image suddenly appears: a hazy, black and white image (very grainy, like early experimental tv images) of a thirtysomething man in early twentieth century military uniform. the man elliott stares directly out of the monitor screen and, just as kirsty finishes her last line ("the cenobites. the demons."), he speaks (in an english accent).}

<P>__{(on monitor)}
<D>__{she's telling the truth, joey.}
<A>__{another burst of white noise and the image is gone. kirsty is back on that monitor, just like all the others.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{look, you can have me tell this ...}
<A>__{joey remains staring at the haunted monitor, numb with shock. what the hell is going on? kirsty's voice plays off as joey stares.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{... as often as you want. there's not going to be any breakthrough. you might think it's delusion, but it's not. i saw them. i looked into their eyes and they looked back at me. creatures from hell.}
