<L>__{interior casino floor craps tables night}
<A>__{he heads for the crap tables, the sound of raucous cheering becomes audible. a large crowd starting to gather. bernie noodles his way to the front of the crowd. as soon as he gets a look at the heavy hitter at the table, he tenses up. oh shit. it's mikey. with charlene. charlene is making one hell of a racket. playing up her extremely maternal state. just then natalie sidles up to bernie with the chivas regal. without thinking about it, he grabs the glass off the tray, downs it in a single gulp.}
<C>__{charlene}
<P>__{(clutching her tummy)}
<D>__{come on, mikey. this is our future. don't blow it.}
<A>__{mikey throws down a bet for the dealer.}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{put this on the line for the boys.}
<A>__{the stickman thanks him as they place the bet. mikey throws down more money. we can see mikey has bets all over the table.}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{with shoes!}
<C>__{stickman}
<D>__{dealer's got shoes. hands high, the dice are out! the point is nine.}
<C>__{charlene}
<D>__{come on all you's. put a good thought in for our baby!}
<A>__{as everyone dotes over charlene, mikey quickly swaps the dice before anyone can see. he throws.}
<C>__{stickman}
<D>__{six the hard way!}
<A>__{mikey is paid nine thousand by the croupier, as is charlene. bernie stands frozen. he doesn't bother trying to get any closer to the table. he knows it'll do no good.}
<C>__{charlene}
<D>__{oh my god, i just felt him kick! he knows. he knows you're all pulling for him. god bless you all.}
<A>__{natalie looks over at charlene. their eyes meet for a second. it's as though natalie knows it's a scam and charlene's acknowledging it. mikey throws again.}
<C>__{stickman}
<D>__{six the hard way! look out, we got a shooter!}
<A>__{another nine grand. mikey's rail is nearly full. charlene hops around awkwardly causing more distraction. bernie is really sweating it out now. then shelly arrives. larry is hot on his tail.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{how much?}
<C>__{bernie}
<D>__{eighteen thousand since i stepped up. i'm sorry, shelly, i guess i've been hit and miss lately.}
<A>__{shelly's expression tells us he isn't so sure. something definitely isn't kosher. as charlene chatters on, mikey switches the dice back. shelly makes him.}
<C>__{shelly}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{fucking amateurs...}
<A>__{mikey throws...}
<C>__{stickman}
<D>__{seven out! line away.}
<A>__{the players and crowd, though disappointed, applaud mikey's achievement.}
<C>__{mikey}
<P>__{(bowing)}
<D>__{i thank you. my wife thanks you. my unborn child thanks you.}
<A>__{mikey moves his rail of chips to the felt.}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{color me up will ya?}
<A>__{larry notices shelly slipping on a pair of leather gloves.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{you've gotta be kidding me.}
<P>__{(off shelly's steely glare)}
<D>__{that's not how i propose we handle it. we'll turn the matter over to the authorities. they'll be blacklisted, their credit ruined...}
<C>__{shelly}
<P>__{(gets in larry's face)}
<D>__{and then we'll give 'em both a lollipop for the ride home. come watch and learn, harvard. a little lesson on how to protect your investment the old school way.}
<A>__{shelly walks over to mikey and charlene, larry lingering behind him.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{hey, that was some run you had back there.}
<C>__{mikey}
<D>__{uh, thanks. just lucky i guess.}
<A>__{mikey steals a tense glance at charlene. she starts to fidget nervously.}
<C>__{shelly}
<D>__{why don't we go do this in my office? i don't like to hand out all this amount of cash on the floor.}
<A>__{security (tony and lou) corrals the couple. leads them away. bernie watches as they pass by. mikey looks into bernie's eyes. they both know he's been made. natalie doesn't say anything, just looks at bernie.}
