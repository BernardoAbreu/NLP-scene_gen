<L>__{interior elevator night}
<A>__{as they ride down to karen's room. she looks at him, looks away. the doors open and they exit.}
<L>__{interior her hotel suite}
<A>__{as he follows her in. she walks to the bar, fixes them each a drink. he checks out the room, takes in her view.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{how'd you find me?}
<A>__{he comes over to her, takes out the newspaper clipping with her picture and shows it to her.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{oh, god...}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i called your room from downstairs.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{if i had answered, what were you gonna say?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{well, i'd say who i was and do you remember me and ask if you'd like to meet for a drink.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{if i remembered you. i came looking for you. i would've said sure, let's do it. but for all you knew i could show up with a swat team. why would you trust me?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{it would be worth the risk.}
<A>__{she looks at him, touches his face with her hand...}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you like taking risks.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{so do you.}
<A>__{he kisses her now, puts his arms around her.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what's the hurry, jack? you have to be somewhere?}
<A>__{she hands him his drink. they both drink, then...}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{sooner or later...}
<A>__{she stops and he looks at her over the rim of her glass.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{you really wear that suit.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{that's not what you were about to say.}
<A>__{she shrugs, lets it go. he puts down his drink, kisses her. she lets him, then moves to the couch.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{remember how talkative you were? in the trunk? adele said you do that when you're nervous.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{she did, huh.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you kept touching me, feeling my thigh.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{yeah, but in a nice way.}
<A>__{he sits down and they kiss again. this time she peels his jacket off. he does the same with hers. he's starting to unbutton her blouse when }
<C>__{foley }
<P>__{(unbuttoning)}
<D>__{i might've smelled like a sewer, but you could tell i was a gentleman. they say john dillinger was a pretty nice guy.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{he killed a police officer.}
<A>__{he stops. looks at her.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i hear he didn't mean to. the cop fell as dillinger was aiming at his leg and got him through the heart.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you believe that?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{why not?}
<A>__{she looks at him, decides to get off this subject. anyway he's finished unbuttoning her blouse and is now putting his hands inside her shirt. she closes her eyes.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you know that sig .380 you took was my favourite. my father gave it to me.}
<A>__{as he kisses her on the neck.}
<C>__{karen }
<D>__{what were you gonna do with me?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i don't know. i hadn't worked that part out yet. all i knew was that i liked you, and i didn't want to leave you there, never see you again.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you waved to me in the elevator.}
<A>__{she's loosening his tie, unbuttoning his shirt.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i wasn't sure you caught that.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i couldn't believe it. i was thinking of you by then, a lot, wondering what it would be like if we did meet. like if we could take a time out...}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{really? i was thinking the same thing. if we could call time and get together for a while.}
<A>__{they look at each other a moment.}
<C>__{foley }
<D>__{you know i saw you on the street.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{outside adele's.}
<A>__{he starts to kiss her again, but }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you were going to see her?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{to warn her about chino.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{so she did help you?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{i don't think we should get into that.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{no, you're right. or buddy. i won't ask if he's with you or what you're doing here in detroit. or if you've run into glenn michaels yet.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{don't talk like that, okay? you scare me.}
<A>__{and he moves to kiss her, but she stands up, holds out her hand.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{he gets up and she leads him across the room...}
