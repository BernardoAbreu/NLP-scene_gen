<L>__{interior ornate apartment building night}
<A>__{white reaches the top of a spiral flight of stairs.}
<B>__{his p.o.v.}
<A>__{apartment 'h' a rusted metal letter on the door. white steps forward. he knocks once and the door creaks open, unlocked.}
<B>__{inside}
<A>__{the rooms are empty, derelict, strewn with rubbish. mould grows on the damp walls. a door stands at the end of a long empty room. he can hear the muffled sounds of surf, seagulls. white starts to walk forward, smiling. as he approaches the door he begins to feel colder. he opens the door and looks out. a blast of sunlight blue ocean and sky.}
<C>__{voice o.s.}
<D>__{john white...}
<A>__{white does not turn about, he takes a step forward, then another and runs into the sky a painted wall. he glances up at a small speaker built into the wall the source of the sea side sound effects. he hears the click of the gun being cocked behind him. hopes dashed, he turns. angle on a mystery man a gun pointed at white's stomach.}
<C>__{mystery man}
<D>__{there is nothing, mister white. beyond the city. never has been. unfortunate. yes?}
<A>__{white is led into a pitch black room.}
<B>__{inside}
<A>__{tight on white's face in the darkness he looks across to the mystery man standing beside him.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{how did you know where to find me?}
<C>__{mystery man}
<D>__{we knew you would turn up here eventually... been waiting for you, yes. hoped you wouldn't make a nuisance of yourself on the way...}
<A>__{the man motions with the gun for white to walk forward. as soon as white turns to do this, the man slips from the room and shuts the door, cutting off any existing light. a noise o.s. some kind of machine being turned on lights start to come up all over the room. it's a normal, average sized, living room. all the furniture has been removed and replaced with chairs, tables, podiums an arrangement resembling an improvised court of law. in fact, white realizes he is standing behind some kind of witness box. the apartment is devoid of people, though almost immediately a door opens to the side (looks like it would lead to the kitchen) and a series of figures step through. mystery men. all the men take up specific positions around the room, without uttering a word, but don't sit. one mystery man opens a curtain beneath an arched entrance beyond it, within a very small room, stand dozens of people, crammed shoulder to shoulder. the people stare at white silently a bizarre gallery of spectators. an eerie silence falls on the room. the kitchen door opens again. white is shocked to see the victims walk into the room and adopt positions in what is obviously the area for the jury. the disemboweled corpse of a woman steps out of the shadows, pushing a pram. her throat is cut, she is shrouded in a white sheet. within the pram is the baby clutching its own head, with spine attached, under its arm. then the mutilated fredrick hops out, followed by the three brown blood stained paper parcels containing what is left of the young boy. finally, his wife and the japanese woman, still in passionate embrace, take their positions. another door opens a closet. within stands the figure we have only seen as a shadow the elderly mystery man with the cane. mister black slowly reaches above him and pulls at a chain hanging from the ceiling the light snaps on inside the closet. somewhere, a long way off in the same building, a toilet is heard flushing. he is much older than the rest, carries himself with authority as he hobbles across the room to a raised podium, supporting his withered body on his cane. looks like he will play judge. everyone in the room now sits. mister black looks at white. angle on white he starts to tremble, not so much from fear, but cold.}
<C>__{mister black}
<D>__{welcome.}
<A>__{white just looks at him, still clutching the small notebook called: answers.}
<C>__{mister black}
<D>__{john white, you are to be tried for murder, yes. you wish to confess to these crimes now?}
<A>__{white is silent. he leans over and scratches his legs through the fabric of his trousers. they itch like crazy. mister black turns to the assembled people.}
<C>__{mister black}
<D>__{very well. the testimony of the prosecutors. yes.}
<A>__{two mystery men stand and step across to a wooden easel. man 1 stands beside it, reveals a series of visuals, charts, etc. drawn on stiff cardboard. man 2 uses a pointer while he describes the evidence to support their case.}
<C>__{mystery man 2}
<D>__{we will show that john white is abnormal, a menace to society, a dangerous sick individual, and that the court should have no mercy in finding him guilty and punishable to the extreme for his crimes.}
<A>__{man 1 places a large black and white photo blow up on the easel. it shows white at the door of the japanese woman's apartment, clutching a kitchen knife, covered in blood.}
<C>__{mystery man 1}
<D>__{exhibit a shows the accused leaving the scene of his most recent crime, yes. a photo taken by a remote camera planted by one of our agents.}
<A>__{white watches in stunned silence. a general murmur of agreement through the room as the point is made. mister black turns to the victims, nods his head slowly.}
<C>__{mystery man 2}
<D>__{exhibit b...}
<A>__{man 1 removes a small tape recorder, hands it to man 2.}
<C>__{mystery man 2}
<D>__{actual tape recording of accused committing aforementioned crime, yes.}
<A>__{he turns a switch, the reels spin slowly. a hush fills the room.}
<C>__{voice 1 }
<D>__{no... please...}
<A>__{a scream.}
<C>__{voice 2 }
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{another scream. a ripping sound.}
<C>__{voice 3 }
<D>__{john! don't...}
<A>__{another scream. white is standing up, involuntarily, he can't listen to this any longer.}
<P>__{white (a squeak, almost inaudible)}
<D>__{stop it! this is a lie...}
<A>__{mister black turns to white. the men testifying stop the tape and look at him also.}
<C>__{mister black}
<D>__{something to say? ready to confess?}
<A>__{the men in the audience turn and all stare at white, as do the victims and the spectators in the adjoining room.}
<C>__{white }
<D>__{i didn't kill anyone.}
<C>__{mister black}
<D>__{speak up. yes.}
<C>__{white }
<D>__{it's lies. everything.}
<A>__{he grips the barrier before him. a shriek from the pram containing the baby it rocks violently from side to side. the disemboweled woman rises from her chair. she has difficulty standing, her limbs stiff. she looks at white, opens her mouth to say something, but no sound comes out. instead a tiny red crab scuttles out, across her face, and falls to the ground. she sits down. white is stunned.}
<C>__{mister black}
<D>__{bring the witnesses.}
<A>__{an older couple are led out of the kitchen by a mystery man. shown to seats behind a podium. the woman looks sadly at white.}
<C>__{mister black}
<D>__{you are the accused's parents?}
<C>__{father}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{wait a minute...}
<C>__{mister slack}
<D>__{you had your turn! let them speak.}
<C>__{white }
<D>__{my parents are supposed to be dead! you can't keep changing the damn rules like this! why go through this ridiculous set up! why don't you just kill me and be done with it!}
<C>__{mister black }
<D>__{please, continue...}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{this is insane!}
<A>__{he looks over to the victims.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{it was them , not me.}
<P>__{(points at the mystery men)}
<D>__{they killed you.}
<A>__{looks back at the mystery men.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{you have invented all this. history is a lie, not just mine, everyone's a fiction. you are the authors.}
<A>__{his knuckles go white as he squeezes tighter on the barrier.}
<C>__{mister black}
<D>__{a fanciful idea, mister white.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{everyone has a job a function. each one teaches you more about your invention. i'm what is called a murderer .}
<A>__{the whole court listens in silence to white's testimony.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{you've given everybody memories, but i missed out. the doctor saw to that played your own game. and now...}
<A>__{white looks at the mystery men, then back at mister black.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{you're trying to get rid of me.}
<A>__{there is silence. whispers. faces staring.}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{why do i threaten you? you're scared aren't you?}
<A>__{mister black and the gathered mystery men look speechless at white. suddenly everyone bursts into spontaneous laughter, led by mister black. a terrible cackle fills the room all the mystery men laugh hysterically, so do the mutilated victims. the spectators in the adjoining room remain silent.}
<C>__{mister black}
<D>__{ah a plot . now we have a plot!}
<P>__{(chuckling)}
<D>__{very inventive...}
<A>__{the older couple behind the podium look disturbed.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{please, john, you're embarrassing us...}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{shut up!}
<C>__{mister black }
<D>__{you have proof? evidence? yes?}
<C>__{white }
<D>__{it's all here!}
<A>__{mister black seems startled by the book, then pretends it's nothing.}
<C>__{mister black}
<D>__{a book of delusions. anything else?}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{but i...}
<C>__{mister black}
<D>__{i see.}
<P>__{(turns to the victims)}
<D>__{the verdict, yes...}
<C>__{white}
<D>__{wait, this isn't fair...}
<A>__{the disemboweled woman stands again. this time she opens her mouth, there is a bubbling noise, water runs out, then:}
<C>__{disemboweled woman }
<D>__{guil ty...}
<A>__{white is agitated, fear in his face. mister black stamps some papers before him repeatedly. on the papers official looking documents. the stamp says:}

<A>__{close on white's eyes.}
<C>__{mister black}
<D>__{before i pronounce sentence...}
<A>__{suddenly the papers on the bench in front of mister black burst}
