<A>__{wade unloads the cardboard boxes filled with his office belongings from the back of the truck and sets them on the ground. he gathers up his rifles. suddenly! a whiskey bottle slams against the back of his head. he drops to his knees, the guns scatter. he looks up with child's fear and guilt at his father. glen whitehouse hovers over him, huge and ferocious: a colossus, lifting the bottle like a jawbone. wade cringes, scrambles for the dropped rifle. he grabs it by the barrel and, twisting around, swings it in a slow motion arc, smashing the edge of the wood stock against his father's head. a cold hard crack of bone. glen whitehouse shriveled again, no longer mythic flies back like a stuffed dummy. he collapses beside the empty c.c. bottle. wade, bleeding from the head, stands, staggers off pop's inert body, aims his rifle at the old man's face.}

<D>__{joke. you scared me.}
<A>__{he kneels down, lovingly touches the old man's face, caresses his lips, cheeks, nose, brows, smoothes back his stiff gray hair. pop's eyes are clouded. blood suddenly drips from his ear to the ground. wade rests the rifle against the truck. he bends over, slips his hands under his father's body, lifts him up. he carries pop over to the workbench, lays him out. groping beneath the bench, wade finds the kerosene lamp. he unscrews it, pours kerosene the length of pop's body. wade takes out his cigarette lighter, ignites it, holds it for a moment, places it to glen whitehouse. fire spreads the length of pop's body, bursting like a shroud of yellow flame. the oil stained bench crackles; flames shoot up the old weathered wall. burning flesh and heat drive wade backwards.}
