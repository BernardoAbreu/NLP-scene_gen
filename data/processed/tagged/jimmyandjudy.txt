<P>__{(relaxes)}
<D>__{it felt like someone had been reading my mind.}
<A>__{she stops.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{it was like someone had jumped into my head and watched what was being projected.}
<A>__{now judy completely has forgotten that the camera is there.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{and earlier, what you said about god.}
<A>__{jimmy zooms in the camera by remote. judy's distracted.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<P>__{(off her look)}
<D>__{tell me.}
<A>__{judy refocuses.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i said that it felt like god had sent someone to protect me, and to look out for me.}
<A>__{she looks at jimmy as if he is an angel.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{and i said that you are the only person in my life who has ever looked after me like that.}
<A>__{judy tries to stifle tears, but they're starting to flow again. as camera zooms in further, judy catches sight of jimmy's finger on the remote and blows her fucking top, leaping from her chair.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{god, i hate it when you film me crying!}
<A>__{judy goes for the camera, struggling to get it off the tripod, she finally frees it and points it at jimmy.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{how do you like it, huh? how do you like having a camera shoved right up your ass?}
<A>__{camera's framed poorly, moves around a lot, goes in and out of focus, etc.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{do you like it? do you?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i don't like it or dislike. i'm used to it.}
<A>__{judy moves the camera directly in his face. the lens is millimeters away from his nose. we see an extreme close up of his nostrils.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{generally i'd place the camera further away from my nose, but if this is your preferred shooting style then i guess i will have to adjust to it.}
<A>__{jimmy leans in and rests his nose on the lens.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{how's this work for you?}
<A>__{judy pulls back and continues filming him.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{give me a break.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{ok.}
<A>__{now judy's the interviewer. her framing is not quite as adept as jimmy's.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{so... why do you have to film everything?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i don't film everything.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{why do you like to film me crying?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i don't.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{then why do you?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{because it's rare that i get to find someone that lets their emotions go. when a person is crying, i mean truly crying, or truly laughing or smiling or frowning or gasping. for a few seconds or minutes i get a chance to see that person's soul. and really, now that you've forced me to think about it. i think it's a very rare and beautiful thing to be afforded that opportunity.}
<A>__{judy is shaken and speechless.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{anything else?}
<A>__{judy's moved and forgets herself. camera drops from jimmy.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{why me?}
<A>__{jimmy helps her put the camera back up on him.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{because.}
<A>__{jimmy sits still. judy doesn't know what to do with that.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{why do you think?}
<A>__{judy doesn't have an answer. jimmy reaches forward and takes the camera away from her and turns the interview around.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{why you and why me? why are we together right now?}
<A>__{judy doesn't know what to say.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{go ahead say it. i want you to. i know what you're going to say so just say it.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{stop.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{tell me.}
<A>__{judy fidgets.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<P>__{(bullies her)}
<D>__{tell me!}
<A>__{judy fidgets again, then...}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(blows her top)}
<D>__{because we're both fucking weird!}
<A>__{judy pauses. the pressure of the camera from jimmy makes her feel like she has to give him more.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{because we're the two weirdest kids in the world. and god made us for each other and i fucking love you, and you did all this because you love me too, and fuck everyone and everything that doesn't get it!}
<A>__{judy's out of breath. camera still points at her.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{that's right, right?}
<A>__{judy stares back at the camera, longing for an answer from jimmy. she told him she loved him. camera shuts down.}
<T>__{camera on:}
<A>__{i e. highway first kiss smiley face jimmy's car day jimmy is driving in his car with judy in the passenger seat. judy has the camera and she is interviewing jimmy as he drives.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{where are you taking me?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{to a beautiful place.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{chuck e. cheese.}
<A>__{judy and jimmy laugh together.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{no seriously.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i can't tell you. it'll ruin it.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{judy sulks for a second.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{jimmy, can i ask you something?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{anything.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{do you hate your parents?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{yes, but i understand them.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{what's to understand?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{lots of things.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i understand that my ascension into young adulthood triggered their descent into mid life crisis. generally when an only child leaves the nest, the parents begin reassessing their own lives. they see us as a younger, better version of themselves.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{they feel abandoned by our need for privacy and insecure because we no longer seek their approval. they used to take us to baseball games and cover our scrapes with bandages, but once we no longer need mom to nurture our bruises or dad to be our hero it puts their roles and subsequent sense of self worth into question.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{how do you know all these things?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{when you don't have any friends, don't play sports, don't go out, have no one talk to, nowhere to go, no one to listen to you, or no one to help you figure things out, you sort of have to figure things out by yourself. and without any of those things i have nothing but time to think about stuff.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{you are so smart.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{you are so beautiful.}
<A>__{long pause. judy doesn't know how to react.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{you think i'm pretty?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i think you're the most beautiful person i have ever met. the most beautiful person in the universe.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{no one has ever told me that.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{get used to hearing it.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{do you think i'm smart?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{do you think i'm fat?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{how could you say that? i only way a hundred and ten pounds.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry. i thought you said flat. as in flat chested.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{i am not flat!}
<A>__{judy smacks him.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{prove it.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{i don't have to prove it. here look.}
<A>__{o.c., judy is sticking her chest out for jimmy. he looks away from the road to stare, her breasts filling out her top nicely.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i still can't tell.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{i wear a full b cup.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{show me. take em out.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{i am not going to take them out! you take yours out.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{it's already out.}
<A>__{judy tilts the camera down. in a flash we see a lifelike dildo sticking out of jimmy's fly, a smiley face sticker covers the head. the camera quickly shakes and spins off the image as judy screams bloody fucking murder. jimmy laughs. judy forgets the camera is on. she drops it into her lap, fabric from her clothes covers the frame. we can hear jimmy and judy laughing hysterically.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{i can't believe you did that.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{that's why i did it. now come on. i showed you mine, let me see yours.}
<A>__{we hear the rustling of judy's clothing. camera falls to her feet on the floor of the car. there's silence. off camera, judy's nervously showing jimmy her breasts.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{wow. give me the camera.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{please, pretty, pretty please with sugar on top.}
<A>__{judy grabs the camera. it's pointing in jimmy's direction, but she still doesn't realize it's on.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{here, i will pull over.}
<A>__{jimmy pulls over to the side of the road then takes the camera. jimmy frames up judy.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{let me see 'em.}
<A>__{judy has a naughty and flirtatious smile. in the blink of an eye she suddenly lifts up her shirt and exposes her bra, then pulls her shirt back down. jimmy protests.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{that doesn't count. come on, for real this time.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i'm embarrassed.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{don't be. you can trust me.}
<A>__{judy's not sure. jimmy looks into her eyes, pouring it on.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{you can. you can trust me with your life.}
<A>__{judy looks at him with a sense of admiration then hope.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{judy gets the same sexy, naughty smile and lifts up her shirt exposing the bra, keeping it there.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{will you take off your bra?}
<A>__{judy looks nervous but gives in. she unhooks her bra from the front and exposes her naked breasts for as long as she can. jimmy focusses the camera's attention on them. it's too much for her. she quickly pulls her shirt back down. jimmy tilts up to a close up of judy's face.}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(struggling)}
<D>__{i just realized something.}
<A>__{judy's eyes are starting to well up as she tries not to cry.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i just showed you my breasts and i saw your penis and we haven't even kissed.}
<A>__{she starts tearing up.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{you haven't even asked me to be your girlfriend and i did that. i'm a slut.}
<P>__{(wiping her eyes)}
<D>__{i don't want to be a slut.}

<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{can i kiss you?}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(sniffling)}
<D>__{yes. will you turn off the camera?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{i want this moment to be captured forever. i'd rather not kiss you at all than waste the opportunity to document the most beautiful moment of my life.}
<A>__{judy leans towards jimmy, then suddenly attacks him and shoves the camera to the side. they are making out exuberantly. the camera shakes and wobbles. we can hear heavy breathing and the two of them smashing up against the interior of the car. jimmy finally has the camera in position. he has one of his arms extended and now we can see the two of them kissing. judy's devouring him in that raging teenage hormone sort of way.}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{i wanna see your smiley face again.}
<A>__{we see and hear judy whispering, her lips placed gently on the inside of jimmy's ear.}

<C>__{judy}
<D>__{what do you think of this?}
<A>__{she brings the gun down, then takes the barrel of the gun and places it between her breasts, squishing them together, covering her nipples as she rubs the barrel between her breasts.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{do you like that?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{judy takes the barrel of the gun from her breasts and near her mouth. she starts rolling her tongue over the top of the barrel slowly and seductively, then stops. it looks as if she's about to perform full mock oral sex on the barrel of the gun.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{that is so hot.}
<A>__{as she is about to start to move her mouth and lips over the gun, then suddenly we hear a garage door open. jimmy throws the camera sideways down on the bed.}

<L>__{interior jimmy's house parents' bedroom day}
<A>__{jimmy is hiding in the closet of his parents' bedroom. he has the door of the closet cracked and puts the lens of the camera through the crack. jimmy's dad enters the room. he has no idea that he is being filmed and that jimmy is in the closet. jimmy's dad walks over to the dresser, opens up the top drawer and pulls something out. it's too dark in the room to tell exactly what he's pulled out, but it appears to resemble some sort of undergarment. jimmy's dad begins undressing, then steps out of frame. after a beat, he reappears. now he's wearing nothing but a sequined teddy. he's totally fat, hairy, and nasty looking. he sits on the side of the bed, his back to us. now we see that what he grabbed out of the drawer was actually a pair of fishnet stockings. he begins putting them on. when he is finished putting on his panty hose, he gets up off the bed and begins admiring his legs in a mirror. he begins to gently stroke the sides of his legs, relishing the feel of the hose over his hands and fingertips. he seems to be lip syncing the words to a song and begins to get all worked up. he shakes his hips and dances around the room for a few seconds. now jimmy's dad goes to the dresser and pulls out a long brunette wig from the back of his top drawer. putting it on, with the fishnet stockings, sequined teddy and long wig, he has transformed himself into the world's fattest, ugliest, hairiest, cher look a like. someone else enters the room.}
<C>__{jimmy's dad}
<D>__{hi sweety.}
<A>__{holy shit. it's jimmy's mom, and she's wearing a leather dominatrix outfit!}

<C>__{jimmy's dad}
<D>__{i just need to put on my makeup.}
<A>__{as jimmy's mom exits frame, we see jimmy's dad go to the mirror. he opens up the top drawer again and pulls out a little makeup bag. jimmy's mom re enters, now wearing a mini leather biker's hat, carrying a riding switch.}
<C>__{jimmy's mom}
<D>__{come on slut.}
<A>__{jimmy's dad finishes applying his lipstick and moves over to the bed. by the way jimmy's parents are behaving, it's as if they've gone through this routine a thousand times. jimmy's mom drifts off screen as jimmy's dad gets up on all fours. suddenly, we hear a smack as jimmy's mom hits jimmy's dad on his ass with the switch. he lets out deep pleasured groans as she continues smacking him with the whip harder and harder. he yelps, squeals, and gyrates his hips back and forth, then starts dry humping the air until she stops. jimmy's mom comes back through and out of frame. jimmy's dad pushes his belly into the bed, groaning from the pain while he waits for her return. she comes back, moving quickly across the screen wearing an enormous strap on dildo. disappearing out of frame again, jimmy's dad gets himself ready for her one more time, ass up, on all fours on the bed. from behind, we can see her hand as she hikes her husband's dress up his back, then we see his face and hear him grunt as she rips his fishnets off screen. there's a pause. nothing seems to be happening, but jimmy's dad is bracing himself for something. his face tightens up. off screen, jimmy's mom has started mounting him from behind. jimmy can't take it any longer. as he slowly emerges from the closet, his mom notices jimmy almost immediately. she jumps off her husband, screaming bloody murder. camera's shaky but it's easy to guess what's been happening. mom's just started doing dad from behind with the strap on.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{hi mom. hi dad. what are you guys up to?}
<A>__{jimmy's dad leaps from the bed and begins shouting. he looks completely absurd screaming at jimmy wearing his sequined dress and wig.}

<C>__{jimmy's dad}
<D>__{you little mother fucker. turn off that fucking camera!}
<A>__{jimmy's mom rips off her strap on dildo and begins beating jimmy's dad with it. judging from the punishment she's inflicting upon her drag queen husband, the dildo apparently is made from the finest and heaviest of materials.}

<D>__{you little beast! you want to film something? film this!}
<A>__{she continues to swing the strap on as she walks closer and closer to the lens. the camera goes crazy. loud sounds are heard throughout the room. evidently jimmy has been tackled. we hear wrestling and grunting. it seems that jimmy's dad has tackled jimmy, or maybe his mom, or both, but the camera is too shaky to tell just what has happened. jimmy's dad is still fighting. he seems to have them all pinned against the floor. he's crushing his mother.}

<D>__{then why don't you want to have sex with me jimmy? you don't think i'm pretty anymore?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{no, no, no! that has nothing to do with it. after i saw my dad being rammed in the ass by my mother, i kind of blocked it out, but when i was in there they kept talking to me and talking to me about it. now i can't stop it from coming into my head. every time i get wood, the instant replay machine in my brain projects this image of my mom pounding into my dad.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{god, that's awful. i didn't know.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{yeah well, you know you didn't give too much of an effort to get in my pants anyhow. you just sort of made your sex face and grabbed my crotch.}

<C>__{jimmy }

<B>__{jump cut}
<A>__{who knows how much later. minutes or hours, the party rages forward. the camera spins around. the party has reached a new level of drunken absurdity. most of those who are dancing are drunk, stoned or both. in the background, while it's too dark and hectic see anything explicit, some of the teenagers are engaged in a variety of sexual activity. some have threesomes. some are probably having oral sex. still others dance around them in the foreground. camera zooms in on uncle rodney. standing just behind him, we see of flash of someone recognizable. it's a skinny woman, she looks vaguely familiar, but it's hard to get a fix with all the craziness going on. she turns her head to look over at rodney. now we can clearly see that this person is... hazel with her eyes wide and clearly in the height of rolling on crank. and she's saying something to uncle rodney that's definitely pissing him off. bodies wipe the frame.}

<D>__{judy, sweetie. come on honey. i saw you waking up.}
<A>__{judy's eyes flutter.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{there ya go.}
<A>__{judy opens her eyes. she smiles when she sees jimmy behind the lens.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{hi, baby.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{you okay?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{am i with you?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{you're with me.}
<A>__{she smiles wider.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{then i'm okay.}
<A>__{camera shuts down.}
<T>__{camera on:}
<A>__{i e. highway to border dinko's car night judy's got the camera trained on herself. she talks like a child.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{mexicooooooh....}
<A>__{judy points the camera up at jimmy. this is the first time we've seen him at all since he was beaten up by uncle rodney's group. he's a wreck. his face is puffy. his lip is cut up. his eye is swollen. he looks like a flyweight boxer who just went fifteen rounds with a heavyweight. he drives with one arm because the other one is in a bandage.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{hey baby.}
<A>__{jimmy looks like a beaten man, both physically and emotionally. his bad ass attitude and rebellious charisma are seemingly non existent. for the first time, we are seeing jimmy without his armor. he looks like any other 21 year old kid who is down, vulnerable, and confused. not to mention the fact that he has a fucking bullet lodged in his shoulder.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{baby?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{come on. not the camera.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{nooooo. it reminds me of when we first met. just you, me, and the camera. god, do you remember how you used to freak me out?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{yeah, those were the good old days. how much money do we have?}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{i don't know, why?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{how do you feel about canada? it's closer.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{are we going together?}
<A>__{jimmy looks over at her.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i think i should take you home.}
<A>__{judy doesn't answer.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i could write you a letter. or i could make a video saying i made you do everything. they'd believe you. you could tell them it was all my fault. you could tell them i was going to mexico and i'd really go to canada.}
<A>__{jimmy swallows.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{we swore on the bond we'd never be apart... but...}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{i will let you out of it... if you want to be out of it, i will let you out.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{you're never leaving me, and i'm never leaving you. that's all there is to it.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{judy leans in and kisses him.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{owww.}
<A>__{judy comes back into the passenger seat and just films him. she likes looking at him through the lens.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{you're so handsome, you know that?}
<A>__{jimmy smiles as best he can with his face all messed up. then his eyes get droopy and close. he's not responding. he's as punch drunk as you can get.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{jimmy?}
<A>__{jimmy's obviously in a concussion induced daze. the car starts to drift. judy drops the camera on the seat as we hear her leap forward to take control of the car.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{jimmy!}
<C>__{jimmy }
<P>__{(snaps to)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{jimmy, stop the car. you're too fucked up to drive.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<P>__{(groggy)}
<D>__{huh? oh... okay.}
<A>__{camera shuts down.}
<T>__{camera on:}
<A>__{i e. highway final scene dinko's car day judy drives. there isn't much talking going on.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{you wanted to ask me something?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{do you love me?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{you know i do.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{i do.}
<A>__{the car drives. judy just cruises along, music playing on the radio. jimmy (o.c.) looks in the mirror but keeps the camera trained on her.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{you know i love you, right?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{yup.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{judy?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{we're fucked.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{look in the rearview mirror.}
<A>__{judy looks up immediately. her face drops. jimmy flips the camera around out the back window. there's a ohio state trooper with its lights flashing tailing them. a lone trooper is on his radio.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{that's it baby. we're done.}
<A>__{judy doesn't answer. she's short circuited.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{just pull over. it's not worth it.}
<A>__{judy holds still for a second, not saying a word. the cop car chirps its siren. judy looks up.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{judy, what are you doing? you know this is...}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{don't do this.}
<A>__{judy looks up into the rearview mirror. her eyes are welling up. she looks out the front windshield. jimmy senses that she sees something. he flips the camera around through the front only to see a row of cop cars blocking the highway up ahead. he flips the camera back at her.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{judy?}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(freaks)}
<D>__{shut up!}
<A>__{judy looks straight ahead, determination on her face. she won't answer. then... she turns the wheel hard to the right, almost carrying jimmy into her, and takes the car onto a side road.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{i love you.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i love you too.}
<A>__{judy is on her own mission.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{it's over.}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{it is.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{the car stops short. jimmy turns the camera to point out the windshield. they're stuck. the road has come to a dead end.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{it's a dead end.}
<A>__{judy ignores jimmy. she throws the car into reverse and tries to turn it around and head back the way she came. a faint sound of a helicopter fades up slowly from the background.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{do you hear that?}
<A>__{judy doesn't respond. she's determined.}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(lying)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{come on, it's over. i will do what i said before. i will tell them i made you do it. it'll be okay.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{no. i want us to be together.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<P>__{(screams)}
<D>__{well we fucking can't, so pull the fuck over!}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{yes we can. i won't give you up. i won't let you go. no way.}
<A>__{jimmy pans the camera out the front windshield. in the distance, we catch sight of a road block that's been set up at the end of the dirt trail. they're screwed. there's nowhere to go.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{judy doesn't answer.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{judy?}
<A>__{she still doesn't answer. then the car thrusts itself forward.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{judy! stop it.}
<A>__{judy's got a look of determination in her eye.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{judy, what are you doing?}
<A>__{judy doesn't respond. o.c., she's murmuring something to herself that jimmy can't hear or understand while she has the throttle to the floor as they barrel toward the roadblock.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{judy!}
<A>__{judy keeps going. jimmy flips the back camera towards her.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{judy! stop!}
<A>__{judy's murmurs grow louder.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{judy!}
<A>__{jimmy braces himself as the car continues toward the roadblock. suddenly, judy's murmurs get loud enough or us to hear.}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(murmurs)}
<D>__{we'll be together. we'll be together. we'll be together. we'll be together...}
<A>__{they head straight in between two cars that form the roadblock. cops jump out of the way as the car hits head on into...}

<B>__{cracking it.}
<A>__{sounds of metal twisting and glass shattering is all encompassing as the camera shakes in a violent frenzy! camera settles on judy's face, bloody, unconscious against the steering wheel, her neck snapped, eyes open in a death stare. camera stays focussed on judy for the longest time as she leans against the steering wheel. music plays on the radio. it's johnny cash's cover of tom petty's "i won't back down". overhead shot of a news helicopter flying above the final scene. looking down from above, we see what the helicopter sees: a scene of about twelve state trooper cars, lights flashing, with jimmy and judy's car wrecked. ambulances are there. jimmy and judy's lifeless bodies are pulled from their car as johnny cash's song shifts from background to score. the helicopter continues its circular pattern as the song continues and we...}
