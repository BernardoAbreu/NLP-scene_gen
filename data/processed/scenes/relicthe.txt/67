<L>__{interior museum hallway area day}
<A>__{pendergast, d'agosta and dr. frock get off are in an older, plain corridor with a long row of locked heavy steel doors. the doors are numbered up to eight, then the corridor turns. as the three go forward, the creaking of the wheelchair echoes faintly in the hall.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{thank you for taking the time to help us with this, dr. frock.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{happy to be useful. it's rare enough these days. according to security, beauregard put the whittlesley crates in storage area 1012.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{how many storage areas are there?}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{they fill seven floors. we have the largest collection of mammals and dinosaurs in the world. just to give you an idea, there are more than three million insects specimens. not to mention amphibians, reptiles, birds, anthropological artifacts, meteorites, minerals and gems. only about five percent of the museum collection is actually on display.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{this place is a maze.}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{i'm one of the few who know every inch it, now that john is gone.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<P>__{(looks over)}
<D>__{do you mean dr. whittlesley?}
<C>__{frock}
<D>__{yes. john made quite a study of the whole museum. he had a copy of my original plans.}
<A>__{frock heads through a double door that leads to a freight elevator that's as big as a small room. the operator, karl has it decorated with a table, chair, and pictures.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{osteo prep, karl.}
<A>__{the doors creak closed. they are now inside...}
