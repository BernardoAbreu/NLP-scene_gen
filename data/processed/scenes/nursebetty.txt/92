<L>__{interior hospital chief nurse's office day}
<A>__{the chief nurse sits behind her desk. betty faces her like a student in the principal's office, now dressed in her white waitress uniform. she hopes no one notices.}
<C>__{chief nurse}
<D>__{what you did yesterday was reckless at best. you are not an employee of this hospital! if that boy dies i don't even want to think of the lawsuit that'll follow. are we communicating here?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{yes, ma'am.}
<C>__{chief nurse}
<D>__{good. i'm prepared to offer you a job. you can help out in the pharmacy until your california certification and references arrive, but you are not to touch anyone. is that totally clear?}
<P>__{(betty nods)}
<D>__{fine...}
<A>__{the chief nurse gets up, and betty follows suit.}
<C>__{chief nurse}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{you can start tomorrow. and don't say a word about this to anyone.}
<P>__{(studying betty's uniform)}
<D>__{is that issue?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{umm... yes. back home.}
<C>__{chief nurse}
<D>__{alright. oh, and one more thing about what you did yesterday... well done.}
