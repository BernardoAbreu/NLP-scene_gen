<T>__{thing:}
<P>__{(suddenly intense)}
<D>__{you are completely bullshitting me!}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i just said i'm going to keep experiencing life. i thought you'd be happy.}
<C>__{sanji}
<D>__{you're like a cigarette addict, carl. except you're addicted to boredom. on the way in here, carl, i offered you a coffee and you refused. perhaps that would have been the most delicious cup of coffee you would have ever had. who's to say? not you, carl, because you said no! anyone can quit smoking for a day. but for a lifetime? no.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{so what should i do?}
<A>__{sanji pulls out a contract.}
<C>__{sanji}
<D>__{behold, carl, the maniyesto.}
<A>__{carl takes the maniyesto.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(reading the document)}
<D>__{1) until new year's eve, i must say yes. 2) the yes cannot distort the truth.}
<C>__{sanji}
<P>__{(explaining)}
<D>__{you cannot say "yes, the world is flat" because that is an untruth.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(reading the document)}
<D>__{3) if someone discovers you are a yes man, you do not have to say yes to them. 4) to avoid yes, you cannot avoid contact. therefore, you must always answer your phone, the door, your postal mail, your email, etc and so on and so forth. 5) you must choose a yesponsor to keep you on the straight and narrow.}
<P>__{(to sanji)}
<D>__{who should that be?}
<C>__{sanji}
<D>__{a close friend who will not tell a soul.}
<C>__{carl}
<P>__{(reading the document)}
<D>__{5) i hereby void the "do you want" loophole.}
<P>__{(to sanji)}
<D>__{what is that?}
<C>__{sanji}
<D>__{if someone asks you "do you want to go to the art museum" and you do not want to, you may not use this lack of desire as an excuse to not go. and finally, a warning.}
<P>__{(spookily)}
<D>__{if you say `no', even once, even for a cup of coffee, be prepared to lose every single little thing you've gained.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{so what do you say, carl?}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{what do you say?}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{i say... yes.}
<A>__{carl signs the maniyesto.}
<C>__{sanji}
<D>__{and here.}
<A>__{carl signs again.}
<C>__{sanji }
<D>__{and here.}
<A>__{carl signs again.}
<C>__{sanji }
<D>__{and initial here. and here.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{is this like a legal document?}
<C>__{sanji}
<D>__{kind of. and finally, my friend, please hold out your hand.}
<A>__{carl holds out his hand. sanji pulls out an iron brand that's been heating over a hot pot and brands carl's palm.}
<C>__{carl}
<D>__{ahhhhhhhh!}
<C>__{sanji}
<D>__{that should heal by new year's. until then, you are a yes man.}
<A>__{carl looks at his palm. in the center of the palm, sanji's branded a `yes.'}
