<A>__{val, earl, rhonda, miguel, and pham van rush in.}
<C>__{miguel}
<D>__{jesus christ! man, you gut a gun?!}
<C>__{pham van}
<D>__{big as a house! what are we gonna do...?!}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{quiet! quiet!!}
<A>__{miguel and pham shut up. then we hear something new the building itself creaking and groaning like a ship. the liquor bottles behind pham van's bar vibrate and clink. the creature is moving beneath the building. the people freeze like mannequins. now we can hear its pig like snorting. pham van and miguel react as the awful smell percolates up through the floorboards. val signals them to keep quiet. finally, the creaking stops. rhonda addresses the group in an intense whisper:}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{remember...no noise. no vibration.}
<A>__{everyone stands stock still and sweats. but, then, slowly we become aware of a faint, yet oddly familiar sound. squeak, squeak, squeak mindy on her pogo stick! they all scramble to the windows.}
