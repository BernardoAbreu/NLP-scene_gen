<L>__{interior the corridor day}
<A>__{amy steps in, her way illuminated only by the indefinite light that leaks in from the street. there's an archway, presumably leading into the rest of the basement, on one side, but it's blocked by a great heap of rubble. amy ponders the chances of getting through it, and decides to check out the rest of the hallway. she works her way through a series of ominous corridors. amy senses that she is not alone, stops, and turns around. no one. she continues. there is only a single door left at the far end of the hallway. it hangs half open, but we cannot see what's inside. she approaches it, reaches out and pushes the door open. it's a bathroom. as she enters we see a figure beyond her in the hallways, buried in the shadows.}
