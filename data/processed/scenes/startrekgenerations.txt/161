<L>__{interior kirk's home kitchen day continuous}
<A>__{kirk rushes in. the kitchen's decor is 19th century with a few 23rd century touches copper pans and an antique stove mixed comfortably with computer consoles and starfleet paraphernalia. picard hesitates in the doorway a little unsure about rushing into some stranger's house. kirk yanks a burning frying pan of food off the stove. it's very hot he quickly sets it down near the sink, waves the smoke away with his hand.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{looks like someone was cooking eggs...}
<P>__{(to picard)}
<D>__{come on in, it's all right. this is my house or at least it used to be, i sold it years ago.}
<A>__{picard comes in and tries to orient kirk to what's going on.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i'm captain jean luc picard of the starship enterprise.}
<A>__{before kirk can react to this remark, an antique clock on a shelf chimes as it strikes the hour. kirk moves to the shelf and looks at the clock in surprise and wonder he is entranced by this experience, beginning to connect with things and memories from his past.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{this clock... i gave this clock to bones...}
<C>__{picard}
<P>__{(pressing on)}
<D>__{i'm from what you would consider the future... the twenty fourth century.}
<A>__{kirk hears what picard is saying, but like picard in his fantasy, he is more interested in the sights and sounds around him. a dog barks from o.c. they both look as a large black dog bounds into the room and greets kirk with enthusiasm.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(affectionately)}
<D>__{jake! jake, you miserable old mutt... how can you be here?}
<P>__{(to picard)}
<D>__{he's been dead seven years.}
<A>__{kirk is still looking around the kitchen when suddenly we hear a woman's voice from somewhere upstairs that stops kirk in his tracks. as she speaks, we can see the shock on kirk's face.}
<C>__{antonia's voice}
<D>__{come on, jim, i'm starving. how long are you going to be rattling around that kitchen?}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(amazed)}
<D>__{that's antonia...}
<A>__{kirk looks at the food on the stove. he's beginning to realize something.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{wait a minute...}
<A>__{kirk glances at picard.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{the future... what are you talking about? this is the past...}
<A>__{kirk moves to a drawer and opens it. inside is a horseshoe with a tiny red bow tied to it. this confirms things for kirk. he picks up the horseshoe.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{this is nine years ago... the day i told her i was going back to starfleet...}
<A>__{kirk is swept up in the moment, overwhelmed by memories, sensations, feelings. he goes back to the frying pan and looks at the contents with a sudden burst of recognition.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{these were ktarian eggs her favorite.i was cooking them to soften the blow...}
<P>__{(re: horseshoe)}
<D>__{and i gave her this.}
<A>__{picard steps in.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{i know how real this must seem to you, but it's not. this isn't really your house. we've both been caught up in some sort of temporal nexus.}
<A>__{but kirk's mind is clearly elsewhere... he's being swept away by the emotion of the moment... realizing the opportunity he suddenly has.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{dill weed.}
<A>__{kirk indicates a shelf, as if asking picard to go to it.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{there's a bottle of dill weed on the second shelf to the left, right behind the nutmeg.}
<A>__{kirk moves to the stove and tosses out the ruined eggs. he cracks open two new eggs on the skillet and begins preparing a breakfast. picard waits for a moment, then goes to the shelf, grabs the dill weed and hands it to kirk.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{how long have you been here?}
<A>__{kirk takes the bottle and uses it to season the eggs.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i don't know. i was on the enterprise b... in the deflector control room... keep stirring these, will you?}
<A>__{kirk moves to a cabinet and begins putting plates on a breakfast tray. picard is getting a little impatient, but stirs the eggs anyway.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{the bulkhead in front of me disappeared... then i was out there chopping wood.}
<P>__{(back to stove)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{kirk takes the pan of eggs back from picard.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{history records that you died saving the enterprise b from an energy ribbon eighty years ago...}
<A>__{but picard's words mean almost nothing to kirk. he is thoroughly enjoying himself and picard is almost a distraction. kirk begins serving the eggs onto the plates and grabs a small vase of flowers to put on the tray.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{so you're telling me this is the twenty fourth century... and i'm dead?}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{not exactly. as i said, this is some kind of...}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{temporal nexus... yeah, i heard you.}
<P>__{(frowns at tray)}
<D>__{something's missing...}
<A>__{then he remembers and turns to look at a nearby toaster as if on cue, two slices of toast pop out. kirk grins and puts the toast on the plates. kirk picks up the tray and heads for the door.}
<C>__{picard}
<D>__{captain, i need your help. i want you to leave the nexus with me.}
<A>__{kirk goes out of the kitchen and picard follows...}
