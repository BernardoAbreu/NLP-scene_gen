<L>__{exterior baptiste's presidential mansion. day.}
<A>__{the camera tracks along the militia however only the very tops of their heads are visible.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{i had heard of the "boy brigades", "small boy units", "kalashnikov kids". the theory was that a bullet coming from a fourteen year old is just as effective as one trom a forty year old.}
<A>__{andre baptiste haggles with yuri as he inspects his troops ranging from twelve to fourteen. yuri, averts his eyes from the boys, uncomfortable reviewing soldiers a head shorter than he. older soldiers fill the ranks behind.}
<C>__{baptiste}
<D>__{i can't pay your asking price, yuri. we are not a rich people and the market is already flooded with your kalashnikovs. in some places you can buy one for the price of a chicken.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{you can't just look at the unit price. you forget the ancillary costs. end user certificates need to be forged and notarized, shell companies set up, insurance purchased, pilots and crews hired. not to mention the bribes. you can't get a nut and bolt out of the eastern bloc without a bribe. there's one bribe for the nut. another for the bolt. this is an expensive proposition.}
<A>__{andre interrogates yuri's eyes.}
<C>__{baptiste}
<D>__{i pay in timber...or stones.}
<A>__{baptiste produces a handful of uncut diamonds from his pocket. yuri's eyes widen at the sight of the very precious stones.}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(regarding the stones)}
<D>__{i will take the stones. it's hard to get a tree trunk in my hand luggage.}
<A>__{andre smiles. he turns to his new lieutenant.}
<C>__{baptiste}
<P>__{(referring to the inspection)}
<D>__{very professional, lieutenant.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<P>__{(dismissing the troops)}
<D>__{dismissed!}
<A>__{yuri and andre watch the troops disperse.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{i know you're planning a new offensive. if you delay a week i can get you the armored personnel carriers we talked about. they would give you a significant strategic advantage.}
<A>__{andre nods, grateful for the free tactical advice regards yuri in a new light.}
<C>__{baptiste}
<D>__{they say i am the lord of war. but perhaps it is you.}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(correcting him)}
<D>__{it's not "lord of war". it's "warlord".}
<C>__{baptiste}
<D>__{i like it my way.}
<A>__{andre smiles again. they are going to be fast friends. he leaves yuri alone to examine his uncut diamonds in his hand.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{diamonds are far less bulky than hundred dollar bills. you can get a million dollars into a cigarette box.}
