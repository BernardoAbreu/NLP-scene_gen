<L>__{interior munson house living room night}
<B>__{the cellar door}
<A>__{creaking open. the professor, lump, and the general peek out. the living room is empty but a sliver of the kitchen is visible; its light is on, and we can hear water running. dorr hisses:}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{she is in the kitchen. i shall distract her while you steal out with the carcass.}
<L>__{interior munson house kitchen night}
<A>__{dorr enters breezily; mrs. munson is at the sink, filling a teapot. dorr positions himself so that, to talk to him, mrs. munson has her back to the living room.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{well, my dear mrs. munson, i have outlined your position to my colleagues and i now return to you to return our collective verdict.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{mm hmm.}
<A>__{behind her, the general peers around the corner and starts a catlike advance across the living room.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{there was much spirited discussion and an atmosphere of frank give and take. some of our number were initially appalled at your proposal that we simply return the money; some were more receptive.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{i don't care they was receptive or not!}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{and that attitude, madam, was a factor in our discussions. to a man, i must say, they were devastated at the prospect of not being able to contribute to their respective charities.}
<A>__{the general signals to lump who now crosses the living room with a big garbage bag slung over one shoulder in a fireman's carry.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{well that is a shame.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{indeed. but at the end of the day, your position prevailed, and the men have decided that we shall return the money every last cent of it! and attend sunday services, rather than spend the remainder of our years wasting away in the mississippi men's correctional facility. though that was the original preference of some.}
<C>__{mrs. munson}
<D>__{well i'm glad y'all came to see the light, anyway. i'm gonna have some tea and go to bed.}
<A>__{the professor, seeing that the general and lump have made it out the door, is anxious to wind things up:}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{so the money shall be returned tomorrow at the opening of the casino office. enjoy your tea, madam...}
<A>__{backing out, he looks to one side. through the living room window he can see the hearse pulling away from the curb. there is another car an old volkswagon microbus slowly tooling the opposite way down the street. dorr looks back to mrs. munson.}
<C>__{dorr}
<D>__{...and congratulations on having recalled to the fold five poor, confused sheep who had momentarily strayed.}
