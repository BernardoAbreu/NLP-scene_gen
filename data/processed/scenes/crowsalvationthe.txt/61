<A>__{camera creeps toward the by now familiar mystery man, bent over his work at the table across the room. close. a lineup of short (2") rods. one selected with a pair of surgical forceps, inserted through a hole in human flesh, raising a considerable welt. some bleeding. as the man reaches for a cotton ball, he notices an empty stand among the taxidermy specimens. marked "corvus brachyrhynchos." he scans the table, searching, then throws up his hands, shielding his face as a crow flies out of the darkness, right at him. the man turns toward camera but we never see his face as the crow wheels mid air, flying past him a second time. as the crow flies up and out a small window, the man stands, hands on the desk. slow push on the man, on... a zigzag pattern of raised welts on the underside of his forearm, in high relief under the draftsman's lamp. the "scar." a drop of blood zigzags, running downward.}
