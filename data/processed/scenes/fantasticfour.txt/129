<L>__{interior diner later}
<A>__{victor and ben sit in a window booth. a waitress sets a foothigh stack of pancakes in front of ben, removes huge plates he's just cleared. victor's aware of the other customers in the diner staring at ben. ben burps: it rattles the plates.}
<C>__{the thing}
<D>__{'scuse me.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{i know it can't be easy. life hasn't changed that much for reed, sue and johnny. at least they can go out in public. but for you? people staring. whispering behind your back...}
<C>__{the thing}
<D>__{if you're trying to cheer me up you're doing a helluva job }
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{i'm just saying, i know what it's like to lose something you love. to see it slip away, and know it's never coming back.}
<A>__{the thing shoves a huge piece of pie in his mouth.}
<C>__{the thing}
<D>__{reed's gonna fix me up }
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{for your sake i hope you're right. i'm sorry if that sounds a little skeptical.}
<C>__{the thing}
<D>__{skeptical...?}
<A>__{ben doesn't trust him. but victor is hitting pressure points.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{look, he's a brilliant man, we should trust he's working as hard as he can. you're his best friend. so what possible reason could he have for taking his time?}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i mean, other than getting close to sue?}
<A>__{off the thing: a seed of doubt has been planted. he can't help but find truth in the words. and we cut to : }
