<L>__{exterior highway underpass mexico city day}
<A>__{the mercedes parked. creasy and lisa up against it. fucking. no cultured way to put it. like animals. a primal release for both of them.}
<L>__{exterior courtyard pinta's school day}
<A>__{pinta waiting alone. creasy's late. then the gate swings back; the mercedes drives through. smiling, she hurries over, hops in the passenger seat. mercedes rolling}
<C>__{pinta}
<P>__{(happy to see him)}
<D>__{you're late.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{you were never late before, i was worried.}
<A>__{creasy doesn't answer. he actually looks guilty. pinta watches him a moment.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{where's my mother?}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{i dropped her at home.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{it's no wonder you're late. why didn't she just come with you?}
<A>__{creasy doesn't answer, just grunts. pinta keeps looking at him and it suddenly all makes sense. he looks over at her, starts to say something, then thinks better of it. finally...}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{do you think my mother likes you?}
<A>__{she's for sure pissed. definitely aware and definitely jealous. creasy's a bit amazed, not sure how to respond.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{i think she's afraid of me. but not the same way most people are.}
<A>__{pinta considers this. then..}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{i'm not afraid you, creasy.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{i know you're not.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{are you afraid of me?}
<A>__{creasy looks at her, almost like he's deciding.}
<C>__{creasy}
<D>__{i used to be. at first. but not anymore.}
<A>__{her smile is huge.}
<C>__{pinta}
<D>__{good.}
