<L>__{interior opera house stage vienna night 1780's}
<A>__{all are applauding cavalieri. the emperor turns to mozart.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{well, herr mozart! a good effort. decidedly that. an excellent effort! you've shown us something quite new today.}
<A>__{mozart bows frantically: he is over excited.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{it is new, it is, isn't it, sire?}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{yes, indeed.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{and german?}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{oh, yes. absolutely. german. unquestionably!}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{so then you like it? you really like it, your majesty?}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{of course i do. it's very good. of course now and then just now and then it gets a touch elaborate.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{what do you mean, sire?}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{well, i mean occasionally it seems to have, how shall one say?}
<P>__{(he stops in}
<D>__{difficulty; to orsini }
<P>__{rosenberg)}
<D>__{how shall one say, director? orsini rosenberg too many notes, your majesty?}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{exactly. very well put. too many notes.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{i don't understand. there are just as many notes, majesty, as are required. neither more nor less.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{my dear fellow, there are in fact only so many notes the ear can hear in the course of an evening. i think i'm right in saying that, aren't i, court composer?}
<C>__{salieri}
<D>__{yes! yes! er, on the whole, yes, majesty.}
<C>__{mozart}
<P>__{(to salieri)}
<D>__{but this is absurd!}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{my dear, young man, don't take it too hard. your work is ingenious. it's quality work. and there are simply too many notes, that's all. cut a few and it will be perfect.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{which few did you have in mind, majesty?}
<A>__{pause. general embarrassment.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{well. there it is.}
<A>__{into this uncomfortable scene bursts a sudden eruption of noise and madame weber floods onto the stage, followed by her daughters. all turn to look at this amazing spectacle.}
<C>__{madame weber}
<D>__{wolfi! wolfi, my dear!}
<A>__{she moves toward mozart with arms outstretched in an absurd theatrical gesture, then sees the emperor. she stares at him, mesmerized, her mouth open, unable even to curtsey.}
<C>__{madame weber}
<D>__{oh!}
<A>__{mozart moves forward quickly.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{majesty, this is madame weber. she is my landlady.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{enchanted, madame.}
<C>__{madame weber}
<D>__{oh, sire! such an honour! and, and, and these are my dear daughters. this is constanze. she is the fiancee of herr mozart.}
<A>__{constanze curtsies. cu, of cavalieri, astonished at the news. cu, of salieri, watching her receive it.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{really? how delightful. may i ask when you marry?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{well well we haven't quite received my father's consent, your majesty. not entirely. not altogether.}
<A>__{he giggles uncomfortably.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{excuse me, but how old are you?}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{twenty six.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{well, my advice is to marry this charming young lady and stay with us in vienna.}
<C>__{madame weber}
<D>__{you see? you see? i've told him that, your majesty, but he won't listen to me.}
<A>__{cavalieri is glaring at mozart. mozart looks hastily away from her.}
<C>__{madame weber}
<D>__{oh, your majesty, you give such wonderful such impeccable such royal advice. i i may i?}
<A>__{she attempts to kiss the royal hand, but faints instead. the emperor contemplates her prone body and steps back a pace.}
<C>__{joseph}
<D>__{well. there it is. strack.}
<A>__{he nods pleasantly to all and leaves the stage, with his chamberlain. all bow. cavalieri turns with a savage look at mozart and leaves the stage the opposite way, to her dressing room, tossing her plumed head. salieri watches. mozart stays for a second, indecisive whether to follow the soprano or help madame weber.}
<C>__{constanze}
<P>__{(to mozart)}
<D>__{get some water!}
<A>__{he hurries away. the daughters gather around madame weber.}
