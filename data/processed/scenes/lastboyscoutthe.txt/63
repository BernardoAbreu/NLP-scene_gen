<L>__{interior bathroom continuous action}
<A>__{jimmy enters and shuts the door. turns on the shower. makes no move to undress. instead, he reaches inside the waistband on his pants. removes a vial of coke. dips a spoon. the door opens. hallenbeck is standing there with a handful of fresh towels. he stops. staring at jimmy. they freeze in tableau. then hallenbeck crosses the floor with two quick strides and slugs jimmy with all his might. decks him. the kid goes over backward into the shower, head striking the porcelain. he swerves. claws his way out, drenched.}

<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{and then i lose my job, my fucking life, okay, and why...? you know why? because i gambled. whoa, hold on, stop the presses, jimmy gambled, well shit, of course i gambled, everybody does, and the fucking league knows it!}
<A>__{he advances on joe, trembling with anger.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{why, joe? why is there an injury report in pro football, huh...? nobody else has a fucking injury report, but the n.f.l. does, so the fucking gamblers will know the spread! marcon... the commissioner ... those fucking hypocrites... killed the last thing i could do, joe...! i can't do anything... anymore.}
<A>__{and suddenly he is crying.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i couldn't save my wife... she died screaming and i couldn't do a goddamn thing... and my baby came out... and he was so fuckin' small, joe... he was too fuckin' small...}
<A>__{he collapses against the wall. slides down to a sitting position. huddled on the floor. hallenbeck watches him. says nothing. for a moment, he seems moved to compassion... then his gaze hardens. he kneels next to jimmy.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{when you're through feeling sorry for yourself, the front door's that way.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<P>__{(wipes his eyes)}
<D>__{you're a total bastard.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{you brought cocaine in my house. end of story.}
<A>__{jimmy is silent. he stands. exits into the hall. joe's daughter, darian, is standing there.}
<C>__{darian}
<D>__{you're jimmy dix, aren't you?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{huh?}

<D>__{forget it, darian.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{the guy's a loser. big time.}
<A>__{darian's face is a mask of confusion. jimmy walks past her to the front door. stops with his hand on the knob. turns.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i never shaved points, joe. i never did.}
<A>__{joe is silent. stone faced.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{if you want my help, i'm at the casa loma apartments on ventura.}
<A>__{he exits. shuts the door behind him. darian goes into her room, fuming. shuts the door. joe is alone. he turns. sees his reflection in the hall mirror.}
