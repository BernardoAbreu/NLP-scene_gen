<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{the men tip their hats and shuffle out of the chapel. kane raises his head, looks at the inscription on the wall. it is a little to one side of junior's grave, directly over the blank place which will be occupied by kane himself.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{do you like poetry, raymond?}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{can't say, sir.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{mrs. kane liked poetry }
<A>__{raymond is now convinced that the old master is very far gone indeed not to say off his trolley.}

<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(looking back up at the wall)}
<D>__{do you know what that is?}
<C>__{raymond}

<P>__{now)}
<D>__{it's a wall you bought in china, mr. kane.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{persia. it belonged to a king.}

<D>__{he was dead... that's a poem. do you know what it means?}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{no, i don't, mr. kane.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{i didn't used to be afraid of it.}
<A>__{a short pause. his eyes still on the wall, but looking through it, kane quotes the translation.}
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{the drunkeness of youth has passed like a fever, and yet i saw many things, seeing my glory in the days of my glory, i thought my power eternal and the days of my life fixed surely in the years but a whisper came to me from him who dies not. i called my tributary kings together and those who were proud rulers under me, i opened the boxes of my treasure to them, saying: "take hills of gold, moutains of silver, and give me only one more day upon the earth." but they stood silent, looking upon the ground; so that i died and death came to sit upon my throne. o sons of men you see a stranger upon the road, you call to him and he does not step. he is your life walking towards time, hurrying to meet the kings of india and china.}
<P>__{(quoting)}
<D>__{o sons of men you are caught in the web of the world and the spider nothing waits behind it. where are the men with towering hopes? they have changed places with owls, owls who have lived in tombs and now inhabit a palace.}
<A>__{kane still stares at the wall, through it, and way beyond it. raymond looks at him.}
