<A>__{a giant projection tv in a large split level living room displays a golf tournament. wide watching from the ultra comfortable furniture are mike erganian, a tanned, silver haired real estate caudillo; bride to be christine erganian, his oldest daughter; and jack lopate, wearing bowling shirt, shorts and flip flops. mrs. erganian, a warm and elegant housewife, shows miles into the room.}
<C>__{mrs. erganian}
<D>__{look what the cat dragged!}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{hi, everybody.}
<A>__{mr. erganian and jack get to their feet and shake hands with miles. jack remains affable, but we can discern his genuine irritation.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{about time you got here, bud. mr. prompt.}
<C>__{mr. erganian}
<D>__{we were thinking maybe you took the wrong way and went to tijuana and they didn't let you back in.}
<A>__{the erganians laugh. miles works up a smile too.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{i had to bribe them.}
<A>__{more lame laughter.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{hey, miles.}
<C>__{miles}
<P>__{(leaning in to kiss christine)}
<D>__{seriously though, the freeway was unbelievable today. unbelievable. bumper to bumper the whole way. people getting an early start on the weekend, i guess. granted i got a late start, but still.}
<A>__{although mr. erganian presses mute on the remote, he keeps watching for an extended moment, as do jack and miles.}
<C>__{mrs. erganian}
<D>__{christine, why don't you ask miles about the cake?}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{oh, good idea. here, miles, come to the kitchen with me.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{don't bother him with that. we got to get going.}
<C>__{christine}
<P>__{(taking miles's hand)}
<D>__{it'll just take a second.}
