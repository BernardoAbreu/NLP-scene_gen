<L>__{interior safe house prague day}
<A>__{the imf team's safe house is a sparsely furnished prague apartment with a panoramic view of the city. the imf team is scattered around the room. sketches, pads, overfilled ashtrays and equipment are strewn everywhere. jack and sarah seated next to each other jack demonstrating the visco glasses to her. claire is seated opposite jack at the computer. jim and ethan are in the kitchen. hannah taking a roll of black out curtain through the room.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{look to your right, then back to me. there's a camera built right into the bridge. whatever you see it sees and transmits it back here. can you hear me?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{of course i can hear you.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no, in your...ear piece. you have a lovely smile (eyes). can you hear me now?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{loud and clear.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what's going on?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{why don't you take a look?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{jack...that's spying.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{that's what we do isn't it?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{jack you're so wicked.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{too wicked to have a drink later?}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i think i might just take that look.}
<A>__{ethan and jim phelps are in a heated conversation.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{yeah, well, jim, fact is i've got more than ninety days leave coming.}
<C>__{phelps}
<D>__{a hundred and sixty seven, i think it is. take it all, if you want. after this one.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i thought i'd take some now.}
<C>__{phelps}
<P>__{(quietly, to ethan)}
<D>__{what the hell's made you decide to take your leave at the worst possible time? claire's in a weird mood too.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{oh? what's the problem?}
<C>__{phelps}
<D>__{i don't know, i had to go to chicago again. you were in kiev. you tell me.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{tell you what?}
<C>__{phelps}
<D>__{when you started noticing your short term memory loss. what the problem was you and claire had in kiev?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{what problem?}
<C>__{phelps}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{ah, god, forget it. what are we talking burnout here?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i guess.}
<C>__{phelps}
<D>__{ethan, you can't burn out.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{phelps}
<D>__{because i can't afford it. and because you'd burn up before you'd burn out.}
<A>__{claire, who is at the computer behind them, somehow seems to be the reference point in the following exchange:}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{how was chicago?}
<C>__{phelps}
<D>__{wonderful. ran into a convention of auto dealers at the drake hotel. you hear the one about the astronaut who comes back from the first manned flight to mars after two years? his wife's got a year old kid. so he says "all right. who was it? my friend harry?" she says no. "oh, it was my friend sammy." she says it wasn't sammy. "oh, i suppose it was my friend lou." "no, what's the matter, don't you think i have any friends of my own?!"}
<A>__{phelps laughs. ethan doesn't. the back of claire's head is in his line of sight.}
<C>__{phelps }
<D>__{boy, you really are grim. come here, take a look.}
<A>__{he leads ethan to the window, which overlooks the city.}
