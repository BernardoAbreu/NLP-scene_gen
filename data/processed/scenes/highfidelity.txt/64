<L>__{interior apartment night}
<A>__{the lock turns and rob enters, holding the door for laura who slips by, her coat in her hands. she glances down at the table by the door and sees ian's envelope.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{you can take it with you if you want.}
<A>__{she slips it into her purse. he stands facing her for a moment, then crosses to her, takes her coat and tosses it on a chair. she opens the closet and takes out a big laundry sack.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{have you tackled the great reorganization yet?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{don't you think there are more important things to talk about than my record collection?}
<A>__{she begins putting books and other things into the bag...}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you bet. i've been saying that for years.}
<A>__{having no comeback, rob goes for the moral high ground.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{so. where have you been staying for the last week?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i think you know that.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{had to work it out for myself, though, didn't i?}
<A>__{laura looks suddenly tired and sad, and looks away.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i haven't been very fair to you. that's why i came here to the store this evening. i feel terrible, rob. this is really hard, you know.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{good.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so. is it my job?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{what? gimme a fucking break. is that what you think? that your not big enough a deal for me? jesus, gimme a little credit, rob.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i don't know. it's one of the things i thought of.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{what were the others?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{just the obvious stuff.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{what's the obvious stuff?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{she stands and walks toward the bathroom.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i guess it's not that obvious, then.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{as soon as she shuts the door behind her, he turns to camera.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{and number three: the pregnancy. i didn't know she was pregnant. of course i didn't. she hadn't told me because i had told her i was... sort of... seeing somebody else. we thought we were being very grown up, but we were being preposterously naive, childish even, to think that one of us could fuck around and then own up to it while we were living together. so i didn't find out about it 'til way later. we were going through a good period and i made a crack about having kids and she burst into tears. i made her tell me what it was all about, and she did. i felt guilty and so i got angry. she told me that at the time i didn't look like a very good long term bet. that it was a hard decision and she didn't see any point in consulting me about it... when the whole sorry tale comes out in a great big }
<A>__{we hear the bathroom door open.}
<C>__{laura }
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{rob}
<P>__{(covering)}
<D>__{what, what?}
<A>__{laura comes out with a toiletry bag and places it by the door.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{did you say something?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{no. so. is it working out with ian?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{rob. don't be childish.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{why is that childish? your living with the guy! i'm just asking how it's going.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i am not living with him. i've just been staying with him for a few days until i work out what i'm doing. look, this has nothing to do with anyone else. you know that, don't you? i left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it. and i suddenly realized that i like my job, and i like what my life is could be turning into, and that i'm getting to a point where i want to get my shit together and i can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, i sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go. but i have no idea what will happen with ian in the long run. probably nothing.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{well then why don't you quit it while you seem to not be ahead?}
<A>__{laura rolls her eyes and head off into the bedroom with the laundry bag. rob turns back to camera.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{ when the whole sorry tale comes out in a great big lump like that, even the most shortsighted jerk, even the most self deluding and self pitying of jilted, wounded lovers can see that there is some cause and effect going on here, that abortions and ian and money and affairs all belong to, all deserve each other.}
<A>__{laura reappears, her bag half filled with clothes, and goes to the book shelves next to the records. she starts topping off the bag with books.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{look. maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me. maybe i will never see either of you again. i don't know. all i know is that it's not a good time to be living here.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{so, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me? there's still a chance we'll get back together?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right? it's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, i don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it? it means he might live. even if it's only a remote possibility.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i suppose so.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{so we have a chance of getting back together again.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{oh, rob, shut up.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{hey, i just want to know where i stand. what chance }
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{ i don't fucking know what chance you fucking have!}
<A>__{she abandons her attempt at packing.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{well if you could tell me roughly it would help.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{okay, okay, we have a nine percent chance of getting back together. does that clarify the situation?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{yeah. great.}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{i'm too tired for this now. i know i'm asking a lot, but will you take off for a while so i can get my stuff packed up? i need to be able to think while i do it and i can't think while you're here.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{no problem. if i can ask one question.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{fine. one.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{it sounds stupid.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{nevermind.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{you won't like it.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{just ask it!}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{is it better?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{is what better? better than what?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{well. sex, i guess. is sex with him better?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{jesus christ, rob. is that really what's bothering you?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{of course it is.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{you really think it would make a difference either way?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{well the answer is that i don't know either. we haven't done it yet.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{never?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i haven't felt like it.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{but not even before, when he was living upstairs?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{no. i was living with you, remember? we've slept together but we haven't made love. not yet. but i will tell you one thing. the sleeping together is better.}
<C>__{rob}
<P>__{(trying not to smile)}
<D>__{the sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{will you please just go?}
