<L>__{exterior william wall high school parking lot day}
<A>__{deacon is talking to the dorky freshman near the bike rack.}
<C>__{dorky freshman}
<D>__{is this some kind of extortion racket? i will pay you double if you can get me something today.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{i'm sorry. there's nothing we can do for a while. we don't have anything new.}
<C>__{dorky freshman}
<D>__{i'm dying. i just need something.}
<A>__{just then, naomi walks by on her way to the parking lot.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{hey, naomi. what are you up to?}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{going home to cram for midterms.}
<A>__{with a look, deacon shoos away the freshman dork.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{oh. i could help you. i mean, if you needed any help.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{that's okay. i will be all right.}
<A>__{deacon searches for something meaningful to say, desperate not to let the moment pass him by. naomi cuts him some slack by asking,}
<C>__{naomi }
<D>__{so where did rachael go off to?}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{she went to paris with the french club.}
<P>__{(then, taking a chance)}
<D>__{we're seeing other people.}
<A>__{she laughs at his attempt at being nonchalant. but she's laughing with him, not at him, and deacon can tell the difference. he relaxes...}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{hey, sphincter.}
<A>__{... just as jake drives up to them. deacon is starting to really get pissed at jake ruining the moment with naomi.}
<C>__{deacon}
<D>__{look, can you please stop calling me that? i think we're old enough to just let it go. all right?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{oh, sure. sorry about that... shit pants.}
<A>__{he looks at naomi.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{hi, naomi.}
<C>__{naomi}
<D>__{whatever.}
<A>__{she turns her back to jake and his smile fades. he revs the engine and peels out backwards. deacon jumps out of the way, but his bike is crushed by the car.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{oops. sorry.}
<A>__{he shifts gears and drives over the bike again. he laughs as he drives away. naomi gives deacon a pitying look and walks away. the moment is gone. now deacon is...}
