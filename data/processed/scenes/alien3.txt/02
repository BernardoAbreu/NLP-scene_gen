<L>__{interior library}
<A>__{a vast room filled with rows of wooden tables with low benches between aisle after aisle of floor to ceiling wooden shelves jammed to capacity with books of all shapes and sizes. millions of books, from the looks of it. from each book hangs a long chain, long enough to allow the book to be carried only as far as the nearest table. a corpulent monk brother philip in his fifties, and the librarian by his stern affect, his position behind a broad, but also old oak desk, and the large key hanging from his belt. he watches the few stragglers return their chain bound volumes to the shelves and head for the door, then rises and joins them...}
<B>__{in the corridor just outside the library}
<A>__{john leans against the wall as philip exits. mattias is nowhere to be seen.}

<C>__{philip}
<D>__{feeding the mind instead of the body again?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{my training has taught me to feed what's hungry.}
<A>__{philip pats his broad stomach and heads down the hallway.}
<C>__{philip}
<D>__{as did mine. as long as you're alone. enjoy yourself and remember, no book leaves the library.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{how could i forget? have a good meal...}
<A>__{john watches the corpulent librarian head down the stairs. when he's gone from sight john lifts the bottom of his cassock to reveal mattias.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{perfect.}
<A>__{they move into the library...}
<B>__{the medieval section}
<A>__{the oldest books. john moves to the stacks. mattias trots over to a particular bench and sits. this is his regular place.}
<B>__{at the shelves}
<A>__{john stands on toe tips to retrieve an ancient tome. he runs his fingers over the familiar leather binding. a smile plays across his lips. he carries the book, places it on the edge of the table so there is slack in the chain. sits on the bench next to the dog. clears his throat, opens the book, begins to read...}
<D>__{john}
<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{in the year of our lord 1348 i, brother gerhado of the minorite abbey helped bury the abbot and my sixty fellow monks voice o s sometimes, i think you'd like that.}
<A>__{john turns to find }
<B>__{the abbot}
<A>__{leader of the monastery. in his seventies but looks younger. his cassock is adorned with a large, ornately carved, wooden chain in place of a rope belt. he crosses to the table. john closes the book and stands, head bowed in respect.}
<D>__{john abbot, i i didn't think anyone would }
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{mind? just philip, if he knew. i passed him on the way up. he said you'd come in alone. i knew better.}
<A>__{he scratches the back of mattias' neck.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{hello, mattias. how are you, boy?}
<A>__{the dog snuffles in response.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{you know what philip says about mattias' hair and his breathing. you'll have to take him out of here.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{he likes when i read to him and i can't }
<A>__{john looks down sheepishly. though nearly forty, he feels almost adolescent in the presence of the abbot. the abbot pulls a large key from his pocket.}
<C>__{abbot}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{someone must have left this one unlocked. take the book with you.}
<A>__{he hands the key to john, who is shocked this is a great honor.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{father, i ?}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{kyle tells me you did a good job at the glassworks today.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i will reserve judgement until the patient lives.}
<A>__{john crosses to the shelf and unlocks his book. he returns the key.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{it will get easier. father anselm was... an unexpected loss. you'll do fine.}
<A>__{the abbot walks towards the door...}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{just have it back before the end of lunch. oh and i didn't see you in here.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{thank you.}
<P>__{(to mattias)}
<D>__{let's go upstairs, boy.}
<A>__{john takes his book moves to a spiral wooden staircase. mattias at his heels. goes up }
