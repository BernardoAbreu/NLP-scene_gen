<L>__{interior house of pain drainage area dawn}
<A>__{beneath the ballroom gratings. a high angle shot looking down at the octagonal iron culvert around which blade, whistler, and the remainder of the bloodpack are gathered. the mechanized, sectional portions of the culvert covering are grinding upward, flowering open and apart like some blood and rust encrusted gateway to hell.}
<L>__{interior sewer outflow area dawn}
<A>__{one by one, the group of hunters descend into the claustrophobic chamber. verlaine is lugs the uv bomb on her back. blade leads them to the clawed open portion of the brick wall, then on through.}

<A>__{blade leads the group along a grime encrusted line which slopes gradually downward, sloshing through ankle deep run off water collected from the city above them. tendrils of mist drift about, cutting their field of vision even further. here and there, thin shafts of sunlight cut down through cracks in the street above, requiring the vampires to cautiously circumvent them. they reach a four way intersection of tunnels. blade pauses.}

<D>__{time for nyssa's pheromones.}
<A>__{blade opens a statchel. inside are a dozen distinctive aluminum atomizers. he hands them out to the others. whistler triggers a can, spraying a thin mist over his face, wrinkling his noses in disgust.}

<D>__{we'll split into three units. first team that makes contact wins the prize. try to maintain radio silence from here on out.}
