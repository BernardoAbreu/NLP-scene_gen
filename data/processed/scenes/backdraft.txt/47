<A>__{tim and three guys from his ladder company, come up an extended aerial ladder, crash through a window and}
<L>__{interior factory day}
<A>__{begin hacking their way toward brian's company as boom! it's a sudden, shattering vibration that shakes the building to its foundations. then, a sucking sound: rush rush rush... stephen speaks calmly into his radio handset.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{hey otis, is it...?}
<C>__{schmidt}
<P>__{(into radio)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{goddamn it, where's our backup? where's the second in companies?}
<C>__{schmidt's voice}
<D>__{sorry, man. john wayne time.}
<C>__{stephen}
<P>__{(to firemen)}
<D>__{dig in!}
<A>__{the firemen hesitate. pengelly, the truck company lt., looks at stephen with concern.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{dig in, goddamn it!}
<A>__{the crews immediately gather in the center of the floor. they turn over tables, chairs, anything to form a barrier. a circling of the wagons. boom! rush rush rush boom! each louder than the last. stephen and brian are ducked behind an overturned desk. adcox and krizminski clutch hoselines like frontiersmen's winchesters.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{you're gonna love this.}
<A>__{ rush rush rush craaaash!! on an instant the world comes apart as all four walls of factory windows explode in a hail of glass. a wave of howling flame pours in after it, shrieking and hissing. at the same moment, part of the floor beside a heavy sewing machine gives way and a ladderman, santos, falls through, grabbing the edges at the last minute as flames bellow up from underneath. he screams as his grip loosens. grindle leaps to the ladderman's side, grabbing his arms and coat. brian hesitates just an instant and stephen shoves him out of the way to back up grindle.}
<C>__{santos}
<D>__{help... oh god...}
<A>__{adcox's taken the hoseline and is opening fire. water and flame crash and snarl across the floor in a blood curdling roar. it's a thrashing, murderous standoff. stephen and grindle have got santos but the angle's bad. blow it now and all three could take a header. santos is panicking, losing his grip. grindle bores his eyes into the man's with the calm and conviction of moses.}
<C>__{grindle}
<D>__{you go, we go.}
<A>__{they may all die, but they won't leave him. he calms a little, hangs on till they pull him out of harm's way. adcox continues with the hose as suddenly, everyone hits the deck as the fire explodes over them, bursting their coats into flame. tim's company opens up their line, washing everybody down before charging after the fire. a ladderman, nightengale, steps on brian's back.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{hey!}
<C>__{nightengale}
<D>__{sorry man, i thought you were dead.}
<A>__{brian, stunned, sits up, his coat and helmet smoking. stephen seems totally unaffected and is already on his feet and over the top of the barricade, the others backing him as he mercilessly drives the fire back, trapping it finally into a corner. the fire hisses, spits, shakes the walls with its furious anger. but it's all bluster now, the fire's dying.}
<C>__{pengelly}
<P>__{(ladder co. captain)}
<D>__{stephen! bc's on the radio. says they think a civilian got left behind downstairs.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{adcox! take tim and do a search.}
<A>__{adcox leads tim downstairs. brian looks shaken up. stephen helps him roughly to his feet.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{don't you fold on me now, man.}
<A>__{brian burns at that and shakes his brother's arm off.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{clear the hose for me.}
<A>__{brian's walking over to clear the hoseline when he hears it. small voice. fainterior "help me..."}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{hey, i think it's coming from a different staircase.}
<A>__{nobody hears. brian takes off down the other steps on his own.}
