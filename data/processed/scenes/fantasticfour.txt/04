<L>__{interior von doom industries tower office day}
<A>__{a large, dark office. ben in the corner. he yawns, watches... bright holograms: stars. planets. they hover in the air, making the room feel like a majestic portal into outer space.}
<C>__{reed }
<D>__{my research suggests that exposure to a high energy cosmic storm born on solar winds might have triggered the evolution of early planetary life.}
<A>__{reed stands among the holograms, speaking to a mysterious figure in shadow behind a desk. an ominous, pulsating red cloud covers the stars. it washes over a hologram of earth.}
<C>__{reed }
<D>__{in six weeks another cloud with the same elemental profile will pass earth's orbit. a study in space could advance our knowledge about the structure of the human genome, and help cure countless diseases, extend human life }
<A>__{the shadow clears his throat. reed speeds up, emotional.}
<C>__{reed }
<D>__{give kids the chance to be stronger, healthier, less prone to }
<C>__{shadowed figure}
<D>__{turn it off. please.}
<A>__{the figure's deep voice pierces the darkness.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{but i haven't fully explained my }
<C>__{shadowed figure}
<D>__{yes you have... imagination. creativity. passion. those were always your trademarks.}
<A>__{lights brighten, revealing the face behind the voice: victor von doom. 35, handsome, commanding. he looks almost... airbrushed. he drops a wired magazine to the desk. reed is on the cover over the words: richards bankrupt, grant}
<B>__{cutbacks.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{but dreams don't pay the bills, do they?}
<P>__{(a condescending smile)}
<D>__{same old reed, the hopeless optimist. still reaching for the stars, with the world on your back.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{you remember in school we talked about working together. that's what i was about to explain...}
<A>__{reed presses the remote. another hologram appears: a shuttle slowly approaching an orbiting space station. both bear the von doom industries logo. victor smiles, more intrigued.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{so it's not my money you want. it's my toys... tell me: if nasa doesn't trust you, why should i?}
<A>__{victor is a step ahead. reed pauses, thrown for a beat. ben wakes up, suspicious. victor notices. he notices everything.}
<C>__{victor }
<D>__{that's my job. to stay a step ahead. to know what other men don't.}
<A>__{ben gets close to reed, turning toward the door.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i can't take this.}
<C>__{reed}
<P>__{(low, quiet)}
<D>__{ben. this is business. just work.}
<A>__{a beat. victor cracks a smile, enjoying the tension. and...}
<C>__{sue }
<D>__{he's right, ben.}
<A>__{they turn to see...sue storm (demure, stunning) standing in a corner...possibly for the whole presentation. a little cold:}
<C>__{sue }
<D>__{it's just business.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{i think you both know my director of genetic research, susan storm.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{heya susie.}
<P>__{(under breath, to reed)}
<D>__{one more thing he's got.}
<A>__{sue gracefully walks into the office, only taking her eyes off of reed to give ben a warm hug.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{ben, it's been too long.}
<A>__{she gives reed a polite handshake. victor watches carefully. reed looks uncomfortable in her gaze. a little tongue tied.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{you're, you've, i mean, how have you bee }
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{never better.}
<A>__{victor sizes them up. he puts a hand on sue's shoulder.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{this isn't going to be a problem, is it?}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{not at all.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{ancient history.}
<A>__{victor smiles, eyeing sue.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{good. then you're just in time to hear the great reed richards ask me for help.}
<P>__{(to reed)}
<D>__{you know, you made a lot of folks at mit feel like a junior high science fair. so you'll excuse me if i savor the moment.}
<A>__{ben tightens. a hard beat. reed sucks it up.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{you back this mission, and i will sign over a fair percentage of any applications or }
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{the number's seventy five. and it's applications and patents.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what about his first born?}
<C>__{reed}
<P>__{(quiet)}
<D>__{ben, the money's not important. we could save lives.}
<A>__{sue gives a thin smile a flicker of old feelings.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{twenty five percent of a billion is enough to keep the lights on, isn't it? maybe even pay off your fourth mortgage on the baxter building.}
<A>__{they look at victor. how does he know all this...?}
<C>__{victor }
<D>__{deal...?}
<A>__{reed looks at ben, who shakes his head softly no. but reed...drops a nod. done. victor smiles, offers a handshake.}
<C>__{victor }
<D>__{well then, to our future. together.}
<A>__{victor squeezes. hard. his other hand on sue's shoulder.}
<C>__{victor }
<D>__{funny how things turn out, isn't it?}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{hilarious.}
<A>__{as reed and sue lock eyes, ben watches victor. wary.}
