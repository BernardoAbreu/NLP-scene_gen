<L>__{exterior suburban house day}
<A>__{a moving truck is parked outside an average suburban home. movers mill about, hauling boxes and couches.}
<L>__{interior living room, new house day}
<A>__{renai unpacks boxes. an elderly woman, lorraine (65), helps to unpack. this is josh's mother. she has a curt, disapproving manner about her that doesn't always make her easy to love. she is actually moving more quickly than renai, who groans as if her back were aching as she stoops down to pick up books.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{lorraine, you shouldn't have to do any of this. sit down.}
<C>__{lorraine}
<D>__{nonsense. i'm perfectly capable of putting a few things away. i did it for josh his whole life. he never was good with tidying up.}
<C>__{renai}
<D>__{i know, but i just feel so bad.}
<C>__{lorraine}
<D>__{i think it's you who should be sitting down by the looks of it.}
<A>__{she boosts a photo frame from one of the boxes. it is a portrait of renai, dalton, foster and josh. in happier times. lorraine seems taken aback by it.}
<C>__{lorraine }
<D>__{i can't believe you got josh to sit still for a photo.}
<A>__{renai reclines against the wall, surveying her new living room. her new new house.}

<D>__{i can't believe we're doing all this again, that's what i can't believe.}
<P>__{(beat; looks at her)}
<D>__{i know you think i'm crazy.}
<A>__{lorraine stops unpacking and fixes renai with a stare. they've never really gotten along before. adversity has brought about a truce.}
<C>__{lorraine}
<D>__{nobody not me, not anybody knows what you're going through right now. whatever you have to do to get through it, do it. and never apologize for it.}
<A>__{renai hugs her. it's a new thing for them and a bit awkward.}
