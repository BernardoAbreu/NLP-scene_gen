<L>__{interior day room morning}
<A>__{mcmurphy opens the screen, raises the window, and helps candy and rose out as washington and warren converge on them. mcmurphy and bromden wheel around. washington, warren and miller appear around the corner, take one look, and head straight for mcmurphy.}

<P>__{(stopping just short)}
<D>__{'kay, let's have the keys an' nobody get hurt!}
<A>__{washington's words are cut off as, o.s., nurse pilbow screams... a bloodcurdling scream. they turn to see nurse pilbow enter the nurses' station, her uniform splattered with blood, hysterically talking to big nurse (we can't hear her). big nurse and nurse pilbow rush out of the nurses' station and head down the hallway. mcmurphy is glued to the spot.}
<C>__{candy}
<P>__{(calling from outside)}
<D>__{come on, come on, let's go!}
<A>__{mcmurphy hesitates, then moves across the day room toward the hallway.}
