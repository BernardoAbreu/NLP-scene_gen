<A>__{bill and wally stare out the window, motionless.}
<C>__{wally}
<D>__{what we gonna do now, bill? cuffs won't even fit on 'im.}
<A>__{starla musters courage. she stands, and moves out of the barn.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{starla, where you...?}
<L>__{exterior strutemyer ranch night}
<A>__{grant wraps a feeler around the cow's horns, and starts dragging it back in the direction of the forest.}
<L>__{interior strutemyer barn night}
<A>__{bill motions through the barn window to margaret.}
<L>__{exterior strutemyer ranch night}
<A>__{margaret motions to trevor. trevor motions to the recruits. and starla moves slowly in toward grant.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{grant?}
<A>__{grant turns and looks at her with his half human eyes. his breathing is loud, raspy, and sick. he sees, in a wide circle around him, the nervous posse standing up, their guns at the ready. starla moves even closer. bill and wally are coming in close behind her.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{grant? it's okay.}
<A>__{as starla and the posse get closer, grant looks almost scared. his eyes dart around from cop to cop.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{you're just sick is all. but we'll take you to get help right now. i will stay by your side, grant, just like i swore i would. for better or worse. remember?}
<A>__{grant's huge milky eyes betray that he does.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{okay?}
<A>__{the posse inch in closer, tightening the circle. grant lets out a piercing screech of protest. all of the posse stop, terrified. everything is quiet and still except for grant's gross breathing. deep: in, out.}
<C>__{starla}
<D>__{okay, grant? it's gonna be all right.}
<A>__{grant screeches again: a warning. he looks from starla to bill, with hurt, jealous eyes, and growls. then grant's eyes close to half mast, and he turns away. his tentacle tightens around the cow's horns, and he again drags it toward the forest. while bill tries to decide what to do, the good ol' boy nervously blocks grant's path. he aims his pistol at him.}
<C>__{good ol' boy}
<D>__{you stop right there, you son of a bitch. i don't care what kinda leprosy you got. we need to find that girl. now you can make this peaceful, or you can make it hard.}
<A>__{pause. grant and the good ol' boy stare at each other. and then grant snaps out a tentacle arm, whipping it up the front of the man's body, and back. the front of the good ol' boy's whole body is split neatly in half. for a split second, he remains alive: the two different sides of his split head look down in disbelief as his organs spill out from inside him. and then he topples over.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{fire! fire!}
<A>__{the posse shoot at grant. starla covers her head. grant is struck; he screeches in pain. he lets go of the cow. he slithers with incredible speed off toward the forest. bill and the other posse members take off after him like hounds on the heel of their prey. they shoot madly. starla watches as the posse follows grant into the woods. starla stands alone and worried a moment, and then she darts off after them.}
