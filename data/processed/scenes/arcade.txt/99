<L>__{exterior level ten, techno skyscraper night}
<B>__{on alex and the boy}
<A>__{as they blink into existence on this level. alex rises, shaking badly. her armor is battered, burnt, covered with grim and blood...it's impossible to tell who's blood, though. she looks like she's just walked out of a slaughter house. a bone jarring humming is heard. alex turns... arcade's brain looms over her, all glass and black steel. it reaches into the sky and keeps on going. massive. tendrils of crackling energy race up and down it, buzzing. and as impossible as it may seem, this thing definitely appears to be alive.}
<B>__{two glass doors}
<A>__{swing open in invitation. a red carpet rolls out from within the building, rolling by itself. emerald city time. the carpet unfurls completely, ending just at alex's feet. above the doors, a neon sign blinks on, one word at a time, "this...is...the...place". fucking a. alex offers a tired, near maddened laugh. it's all she can do anymore.}
<B>__{the boy}
<A>__{looks up at alex, frightened.}
<C>__{boy}
<D>__{we have to go in there, don't we?}
<A>__{alex nods. she takes his hand and together, they walk down the red carpet towards the entrance of arcade's brain.}
