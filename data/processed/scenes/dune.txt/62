<L>__{51. (deleted) 52. interior baron's room geidi prime day}
<A>__{in front of a huge steam boiler, the cable car stops and piter gets out, steps down steel stairs and enters a porcelain room where the baron is being treated by a doctor for sores on his face and body. the doctor uses a lasbeam on a big sore on the baron's lips. the baron is sickly and hugely fat and sweaty and looks like he has been sickly for some time. he turns to piter as he enters the room.}
<C>__{piter}
<D>__{my lord!}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{piter.}
<A>__{piter moves up to the baron.}
<C>__{piter}
<D>__{the atreides will be leaving caladan soon, baron, and i have here your answer from duke leto.}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{what does leto say, piter?}
<C>__{piter}
<D>__{he wishes to inform you that vendetta as he puts it, using the ancient tongue, the art of kanly is still alive. he does not wish to meet or speak with you.}
<C>__{baron}
<P>__{(swallowing; angry)}
<D>__{i made my peace gesture... the forms of kanly have been obeyed.}
<A>__{he throws down the cylinder.}
<C>__{piter}
<D>__{as you instructed me, i have enlightened your nephews concerning my plan t...}
<A>__{ }
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{my plan!}
<C>__{piter}
<D>__{the plan to crush the atreides. feyd, rabban... go quietly... no other great house of the landsraad must ever know of the emperor's aid to the baron. the entire landsraad would turn against the baron and the emperor.}
<C>__{doctor}
<D>__{put the pick in there pete and turn it round real neat.}
<A>__{his assistant does so. rabban breaks open a squood (living food). the squood makes a tiny scream, then rabban drinks the blood and bodily fluids. he throws the empty container of tiny animal meat into the dark water trough running through the center of the room. across the room, two harkonnen soldiers enter, holding big guns on a boy who is wearing white pants. the baron smiles when he sees the boy, who is deeply afraid. the guards force the boy to arrange violet flowers on a stand by the far wall opposite the baron.}
<C>__{baron}
<P>__{(as the baron watches the boy)}
<D>__{you're so beautiful my baron your skin, love to me your diseases lovingly cared for for all eternity.}
<C>__{baron}
<D>__{i will have arrakis back for myself... he who controls the spice, controls the universe... and what piter didn't tell you is we have control of someone who is very close to duke leto. this person... this traitor... will be worth more to us than ten legions of sardaukar.}
<C>__{feyd}
<D>__{who is the traitor?}
<C>__{baron}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{i won't tell you who the traitor is or when we'll attack. however, the duke will die before these eyes and he'll know that it is i baron vladimir harkonnen who encompasses his doom.}
<A>__{ the baron gives a hand signal and seven gates in the wall open, emitting tremendous sounds. suddenly the baron begins to float straight up, twenty five feet in the air. it is a frightening sight. he floats down under the giant, humming electrical tube light and rubs his head and body with a black fluid which drips from tiny holes in either side of the pink glow. feyd and rabban watch nervously. the attendants stand completely still with fear. the baron swoops down to the boy, who stands petrified. the harkonnen guards smile nervously as they step slightly backwards. the boy begins screaming as the baron pulls the boy's heart plug, located in his chest. the violet flowers are bumped and disarrayed by the violence which ensues. then the baron turns smiling to feyd as the sounds continue to roar.}
