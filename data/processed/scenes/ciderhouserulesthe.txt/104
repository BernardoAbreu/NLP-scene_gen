<L>__{interior st. cloud's dining hall evening}
<A>__{edna and angela face the board of trustees around a table. larch circles the table as everyone reads the contents of a folder. larch has provided a copy for each member. the three elderly gentlemen on the board don't speak; they just nod their heads to everything dr. holtz or mrs. goodhall says.}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{...and his pathetic resume is the best i've seen. though i find it hard to believe the board would be interested in this character.}
<C>__{dr. holtz}
<D>__{but he looks like an excellent young man, a first rate candidate!}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{he looks like a bleeding heart missionary moron to me, but that's going to be the problem with any doctor interested in coming here!}
<C>__{mrs. goodhall}
<D>__{do you know him?}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{no! i don't want to know him! he's doing missionary work in india! i wrote him weeks ago, but he's either too holy or too busy to answer. maybe he got killed in the war!}
<A>__{suddenly steerforth bursts through the door, having been pushed from behind by mary agnes. the two stop when they see what's going on not to mention larch's stern expression. they back out. mary agnes winking at dr. holtz before the door closes. mrs. goodhall is ready to continue.}
<C>__{mrs. goodhall}
<D>__{i fail to see how someone courageous enough to make a commitment to a foreign mission is automatically to be dismissed that part of the world requires precisely the kind of dedication that is needed here.}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{does it snow in bombay? one winter here and we'll be shipping him south, in a coffin!}
<C>__{mrs. goodhall}
<D>__{you can't think that a man who has served under such conditions as exist over there will be in the slightest daunted by a little snow have you no idea how harsh and primitive and full of disease that part of the world is?}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{then i suppose we can look forward to catching various diseases from him!}
<C>__{dr. holtz}
<D>__{but, dr. larch, he seems exceptionally qualified...}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{i'm not talking about his medical qualifications. it's the christian thing that bothers me i just don't see it being of much use around here.}
<C>__{mrs. goodhall}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{i fail to see how a little christianity could hurt anyone here!}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{anyway, i was just showing you this guy as an example of what's available i didn't think you'd be interested.}
<C>__{dr. holtz}
<D>__{we're very interested!}
<C>__{mrs. goodhall}
<D>__{yes, very!}
<C>__{dr. holtz}
<D>__{you wouldn't be opposed to meeting with him?}
<C>__{larch}
<D>__{i suppose it wouldn't hurt to meet him. what's his name again?}
<C>__{angela}
<D>__{dr. homer wells.}
<C>__{larch}
<P>__{(mumbling)}
<D>__{i just hope he won't expect us to say grace all the time.}
<A>__{the three elderly gentlemen repeat the name.}
<C>__{mrs. goodhall}
<D>__{it's a nice name, very new england.}
<C>__{dr. holtz}
<D>__{very maine, a very local sounding name.}
<C>__{edna}
<D>__{very!}
