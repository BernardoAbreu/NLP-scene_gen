<A>__{in the middle of this very small, very cramped living room is an inflatable baby pool. and in this baby pool is lori, who is now naked and pushing. zoe watches, horrified, the brownie still in her hand. carol is beside her, playing the drum and chanting.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{hi ya ya hi ya ya hi ya hi ya ya.}
<C>__{zoe}
<P>__{(eyes wide)}
<D>__{wow. wow. wow.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{i know. it's amazing how the body can open up like that.}
<A>__{zoe covers her mouth. it looks like she is going to throw up. she stumbles for the door.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i'm just going to get some air. i'm feeling a little...}
<C>__{lori}
<D>__{don't move, zoe, you're my focal pointerior}
<A>__{lori then grunts through another big contraction.}
<C>__{midwife}
<D>__{push, lori. push.}
<A>__{while lori's eyes are closed, zoe tries to sneak out. carol chases after, still beating the drum.}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{you can't leave. you're her focal pointerior}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{can't she use someone else?}
<C>__{carol}
<D>__{she's in labor. you want to argue with her now?}
