<L>__{interior simon's room simultaneous}
<A>__{simon is sitting on the floor, head hung low, in front of the dead wall... a glitch, a flicker... the screen comes to life: it's kable's pov of ken castle. castle is stripping off his shirt.}
<C>__{ken castle}
<P>__{(on screen)}
<D>__{come on, lets boogie woogie rock and roll.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{ummm.}
<T>__{cut back to:}
<L>__{interior castle's court continuous}
<A>__{castle throws a funky karate kick and nails kable in the jaw... then a haymaker to the gut, doubling kable over. he lets kable swing the knife just short of his face as he backs away.}
<C>__{ken castle}
<D>__{biggest, baddest slayer in the game... don't seem like much, does he?}
<A>__{castle is enjoying the hell out of himself. he uppercuts kable, snapping his head back... then shakes out his knuckles.}
<C>__{ken castle }
<D>__{oww!}
<A>__{kable swings his open hand around castle choreographs it perfectly: kable's nails rake across castle's stomach, marking him up like bruce lee in enter the dragon. castle strikes a pose to match.}
<C>__{ken castle }
<D>__{lucky shot.}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{ok, not really.}
<A>__{he brings a passable reverse crescent kick that drops kable to the floor.}
<C>__{ken castle }
<D>__{i need an audience, boys.}
<A>__{a door opens at the far end of the court; kable looks up slowly, afraid of what he knows he'll see: angie and delia are led into the room. angie presses herself close to delia, holding her shoulders protectively. she keeps her distance from the geek squad escorts and tries to block delia from them there is raw fear and anger in her eyes; the geek squad are not overtly violent or menacing, but angie seems acutely aware that they are lethal. delia seems oddly neutral and unaffected by the entire situation. castle kicks kable across the floor, toward them.}
<C>__{ken castle }
<D>__{that's right, you crawl on your belly like a toad...}
<P>__{(he looks to the geek squad, sheepish)}
<D>__{is this bad? i'm really bad.}
<A>__{he gives kable a last kick; kable collapses in front of his daughter... she looks down at him, curiously. he looks up at delia, eyes soaked with emotion... then to angie. they share a moment of intense eye contact we feel that angie wants desperately to go to him but is unsure of what is the best action to take strategically; she is looking to kable for a clue. kable's eyes go back to delia; he tries to reach up and gently touch her face...}
<C>__{ken castle }
<D>__{that's sweet.}
<A>__{castle steps on kable's hand, pinning it to the floor.}
<C>__{ken castle }
<D>__{alright boys, you ready? a true test.}
<A>__{he steels his eyes on kable and concentrates. kable slowly brings up the knife toward delia's throat. angie moves to pull delia away castle merely glances up at her and she freezes, paralyzed. we can see her body strain against invisible control, raw panic in her eyes...}
<C>__{kable}
<P>__{(desperate)}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ken castle}
<D>__{just like last time. remember?}
<A>__{kable is fighting it with all his will, his whole body shaking...}
<C>__{ken castle }
<D>__{you're stronger now... a little more fight in you... but i think the end result will be about the same...}
<C>__{ken castle }
<D>__{shh.}
<A>__{the geeks look on, impassive. the blade is inches away... he looks into angie's eyes she and kable are like one; he seems to draw strength from her... finally, kable wills everything he has and stabs the knife into the floorboards. suddenly: kable's head snaps around, his eyes confused... and in one quick, smooth movement, kable yanks the knife out of the floor, rises to his feet and spins on castle. he claps a hand around castle's neck and tries to jam the knife up into his gut but castle is able to freeze him just short...}
<C>__{ken castle }
<P>__{(freaked)}
<D>__{what the hell was that?}
<A>__{the geeks break out tiny devices and start quickly scanning. not even kable understands this.}
<C>__{ponytail geek}
<D>__{there are 2 networks accessing the same ip address.}
<C>__{geek leader}
<D>__{someone on the outside is sending him commands...}
