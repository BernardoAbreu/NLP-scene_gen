<L>__{interior brody's office day}
<A>__{brody walks through the door and enters his office, holding a fizzing glass of alka seltzer. polly, his sixty one year old secretary follows close on his heels with her shorthand pad of messages and reminders. in the outer office, hendricks and cassidy slump into chairs, sipping from fizzing dixie cups. brody dips into file drawers for the appropriate forms. he gently turns on polly, who is behind him.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{if this is going to work, you've got to keep current stuff out here, and put 'closed' files in there. the 'pendings' stay on my desk, okay?}
<A>__{brody slips behind his typewriter, putting paper in the machine with the effortless ease of years of practice. he's obviously no stranger to paperwork. he touch types, hardly ever looking down, checking his notes and listening with one ear to polly. he is affected by what he's seen, but there's work to be done.}
<C>__{polly}
<D>__{this is in no order of importance, chief: there's a meeting on the amity town council on aging this monday night, bentoncourt hall. the fire inspector wants you to go over the fireworks site with him before he catches the one o'clock ferry. mainly, you have a batch of calls about that new karate school.}
<A>__{close accident report brody has just typed the girl's name. he skips the space for cause of death, and just under it types the next of kin information he has collected from her wallet.}
<C>__{polly}
<D>__{searle's rent a bike, the rainy ale, tisberry's hardware... they say it's those nine year olds from the school practicing karate on all those nice picket fences.}
<A>__{the phone rings and polly picks it up.}
<C>__{polly}
<D>__{it's the coroner. somebody pass away in the night?}
<A>__{brody nestles the phone between ear and collar, listening, as he turns to the typewriter.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{jesus, santos.}
<A>__{insert accident report cause of death line rolls into place. the hammers punch out:}
<B>__{shark attack. brody}
<A>__{leans forward, staring at what he just wrote. polly cocks her head and removes the phone from his ear.}
<C>__{polly}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<A>__{brody takes a breath. a new resolve comes over him.}
<C>__{brody}
<D>__{polly, i want to know what water recreation is on for today.}
<C>__{polly}
<D>__{right this minute?}
<A>__{brody gets up and moves hastily toward the door. brody's outer office cassidy and hendricks look up as brody enters.}
<C>__{brody}
<P>__{(to hendricks)}
<D>__{where'd you hide the 'beach closed' signs?}
<C>__{hendricks}
<D>__{we never had any. what's the problem?}
<A>__{a local merchant comes through the door.}
<C>__{local merchant}
<D>__{glad i caught you. there's a city truck with new hampshire plates parked right in front of my...}
<A>__{brody pushes past him and out the door.}
