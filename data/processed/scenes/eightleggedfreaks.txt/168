<A>__{chris and sam move toward the bobbing lights of the few remaining survivors.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{we're trapped again!}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{at least they can't follow us.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{which way do we go?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i think we're in one of the old tunnels.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{can you get us out of here?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{don't worry, sam.}
<A>__{chris takes point with the others following nervously.}
<L>__{interior mines junction night}
<A>__{a boarded up shaft entrance. suddenly the wood splinters. chris and the others bash through. they file into a slightly more open area with two branching tunnels. the place is stacked from floor to ceiling with barrels of toxic waste.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i don't believe it...}
<A>__{mike recognizes the biohazard warning label he saw on the barrel in the drainage ditch.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i've seen one of these before!}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{what are they?}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{toxic waste.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{where did you see it, mike?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{the creek where joshua gets his spider food. there was one in the water.}
<A>__{chris starts toward the sloping tunnel.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{we can get out this way!}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{no, we can't.}
<P>__{(turns to wade)}
<D>__{isn't that tunnel blocked off, dad?}
<A>__{chris and the others look at wade.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{uh... yeah... he's right. we can't get out that way.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{you did this?}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{i knew you'd never sell... we're under my property so...}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you put all of us at risk.}
<C>__{wade}
<D>__{i didn't have a choice! i was broke! they gave me a hundred grand!}
<A>__{sam punches him. knocking wade to the ground.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i think our lives are worth a little more than that.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{we're wasting time.}
<A>__{chris heads toward the only exit available. the others follow. wade staggers to his feet. stumbling after them.}
