<L>__{interior garage afternoon}
<A>__{george walks to an armoire and empties it. he grabs a hammer and bangs, pries and pulls the back off, then dumps the cabinet onto the floor.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i know you took it. i want it now!}
<A>__{george yanks the chain saw to a roar and fashions an oval cut a few feet deep on the cabinet base. he kills the saw, lifts the armoire and scoots it in front of the toilet.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{doors.}
<A>__{bob grimaces as george opens the armoire, revealing the toilet inside.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i hate to ask about a window.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(to sam)}
<D>__{i flushed it down the toilet.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no! oh my god!}
<A>__{george jerk starts the chain saw again and fashions a small opening above the toilet, ripping through the studs, wire mesh, tar paper and stucco fine dust invades the space like a storm. bob coughs as he writes in his book. george kills the chain saw and sets it down as he surveys his work.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{if i had a gun, i'd kill you.}
<A>__{bob seems fairly anxious to conclude his business.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i assume you'll fill the...uh, window, with glass?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{if that's what it takes.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what's in my pants is none of your fucking business!}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(a little rattled)}
<D>__{i would say you're in compliance.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i hope that makes the pain in the ass that called you happy.}
<A>__{george is staring at sam. bob backs out of the garage.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{you and me both.}
<A>__{with bob gone, george walks to sam and gets in his face.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{everything about you is my business. what you smoke, what you swallow, what you sniff, it's all my business.}
<A>__{sam slams his fists against his own chest, maddened.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i've been using since i was twelve! you're all so unbelievably stupid. you didn't give a shit about anything i did until now!}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i will apologize for everything but today...today i give a shit.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you're too fucking late.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{the gloves on the table are for you.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{you can't make me do a thing.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{sit down for a second.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{george gently guides sam back onto the bed. sam hops up mad.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{i will call the cops if you touch me again!}
<A>__{george sets sam back onto the bed, not so gently this time. sam is less eager to hop up in defiance.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{oh, so you're in the big shit now! child abuse. people go to prison for what you just did to me.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{my dad used to play a game. i never really understood what it was until after he was gone.}
<A>__{sam appears immensely disinterested.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i was holding for someone. that wasn't even mine.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{the game was to make me smaller than he was. no matter what. he could be almost invisible as a human being, but i had to be smaller. so if i got good grades, i was a pussy for not playing football. if i cut my hair for him, it wasn't short enough. if i shaved it, i looked like a psycho. i never won the game. not once. and if he couldn't make me smaller with words...}
<A>__{tears well in george's eyes. sam is caught up enough in what his father has to say that he has to feign his lack of interest.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i will have to pay him back.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i won't ever hit you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i don't want you smaller. i want you to be happy. you're not. not here with me. not home with your mother. not up in tahoe. not alone. not anywhere.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you're what i was most of my life, sam. i see it in your eyes. in your sleep. in your answer to everything. you're barely alive.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm not even listening.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you know that great thing, though? is that change can be so constant you don't even feel the difference until there is one. it can be so slow that you don't even notice that your life is better or worse, until it is.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{or it can just blow you away. make you something different in an instant. it happened to me.}
<A>__{george walks to the garage door as he wipes his eyes. he stops and turns back around to face sam.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{build this house with me.}
<A>__{george walks out leaving sam on the bed to think.}
