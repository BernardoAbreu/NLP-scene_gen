<L>__{exterior beach night}
<A>__{he sits..she stands, gorgeous..the wind gusts periodically blowing her dress against her body. he tries not to notice.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{you know about cristina and your great school?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oh, it's happened. is it driving you nuts?}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{yes, nuts. i have no idea what to do. such an important thing.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{it's a good school?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{tops. it's tops.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{so you like it?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no. i hate the damn school. but that's because they keep sending my daughter home anxiety ridden, mostly over geometry..i mean you "get" bernice..in a decent world her school should let her know how great she is, right?}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{very right.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{so, don't ask me..i'm worried about my own kid there.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{you don't have to worry about bernice. nothing is going to change that heart.}
<A>__{he looks at her..out of nowhere overwhelmed by someone echoing and affirming his deepest most private thoughts about his daughter..it is odd..being this deeply touched before he knows what hit him..he makes little adjustments until the moment passes..}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{um.....yeah..thanks...}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{it's great to hear someone else say that out loud..hard to explain.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{i "get" it.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(a beat..then deeply, with core feelings, a lament)}
<D>__{ah, man..}
<C>__{flor}
<P>__{(caring)}
<D>__{it will be okay.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no, i was thinking about you..}
<C>__{flor}
<P>__{(instantly alarmed)}
<D>__{your, "ah, man" was for me? you think i am in trouble with cristina?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it's just tough to be sane.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{to know you're not just making something out of nothing. that when you think you're at some crossroads you are.}
<C>__{flor}
<P>__{(she takes this in nods)}
<D>__{....i never know a man who can put himself in my place like you do. how do you become that man?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't know...you introduce two jews in the desert and wait five thousand years. then, bingo, somebody else who can see trouble coming but can't do anything about it.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{i don't understand.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{that's okay.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{i want to.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{nothing. i don't know what i'm talking about..}
<A>__{a sustained gust of wind which celebrates her shape in a way which cannot be ignored.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{will you sit down.. get out of the damn wind.}
<A>__{she sits. it helps.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{so you going to send her?}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{i don't know. but it does not feel good. i think if she goes there it will be one of two things..either she will be odd...or she will make herself the same as them.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(in wonderment)}
<D>__{that is exactly the way i felt about bernice going there..exactly.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{i wasn't able to think it that clearly...but that's how i felt. so between odd and the same...you gotta root for odd, don't you?}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{yes, you gotta.}
<A>__{camera begins to pull back...early in the move john's words stop the movement.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{this was a crummy summer.}
<A>__{flor nods ruefully..then suddenly off a glance at him.}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{not all crummy.}
<A>__{suddenly there is a bit of danger..she rises quickly, changing mode.}
<C>__{flor }
<D>__{thank you, good night. i go sleep.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{good night..hey?}
<A>__{she turns..}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{you speaking english...it's, uh..}
<C>__{flor}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{nothing. just.... nice meeting you.}
<A>__{she gulps and exits...as the camera pulls back..ending the summer at the rented house...as we transition to....}
