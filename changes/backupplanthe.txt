<LOC>__{INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY}
<ACTION>__{Some fantastic song that makes us want to cry is playing... We are CLOSE on Zoe's face. She is smiling. She does not look scared. And she does not look alone. WIDEN to reveal Stan by her side. And we PULL BACK and above the operating table and see Dr. Harris performing the C-section. He pulls out the babies one by one. We FOLLOW the babies as they get swaddled tight and handed back to Zoe and Stan. Zoe and Stan look at the little girls and then at each other. They are both in tears. Even Dr. Harris can't help but cry.}
<LOC>__{INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{It's night. Zoe is asleep. She opens her eyes and takes a moment to figure out where she is. She turns to the side and finds Stan sleeping next to her, curled up against her in the tiny hospital bed. To the side of the bed are two bassinets. Each baby sleeping soundly in a little pink hat. And in the next bed is Nana, asleep with a bandage on her forehead.}

We TILT up and see Zoe and Stan strolling arm in arm, each with a Baby Bjorn with a rosy-cheeked baby girl in it. Both girls have flaming red hair. A woman pushing a stroller passes by. She smiles at Zoe and Stan. They smile back.}
