<A>__{to sam plummeting down through dense clouds, his cape twisting around him. somehow he manages to wrestle it clear of his body. gripping the corners he whips the cape up and over his head. the wind catches it and fills it out until it acts as a parachute slowing sam's descent. suddenly the clouds thin out and sam can see below him.}
<L>__{exterior strange landscape anti day}
<A>__{sam is heading down towards a barren landscape. strange mounds dot the barrenness they ooze smoke and the occasional flame. near one of the mounds are two long lines of shrouded figures being forced into two giant cages, suspended beneath two great misshapen balloons. the black robed forces of darkness (fod) surround the prisoners, relentlessly herding them towards the cages. the entire scene is strangely coloured by unearthly light. the sky is blood red and where the sun should be is a black disc. sam descends on his cape parachute.}
