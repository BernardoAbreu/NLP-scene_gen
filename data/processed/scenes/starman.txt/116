<A>__{the star man swivels the picture around so that he can see it. jenny hands the smirking clerk her credit card. he steps to the side and inserts it into the imprinter. out of the corner of his eye, he sees a dot of light leave the star man's forehead to drop behind the magazine and into his trousers. the clerk glances over at jenny to see if she hears the hissing that is going on behind the star man's fly. she does and she hopes it'll stop soon. his eyes on the star man, the clerk fumbles the key to 117 off the rack.}
<C>__{clerk}
<D>__{you can park your car in front of the room.}
<A>__{he drops the key on the counter.}
