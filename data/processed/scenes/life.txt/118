<L>__{exterior superintendent's mansion day}
<A>__{up on the porch, claude brings a tray of minted iced tea to superintendent wilkins, who sets aside his bible and washes down a couple of pills. before going back inside, claude can't resist taunting ray, busy trimming a hedge out in the hot sun.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{oh, yard boy, these pansies could use some attention over here. perhaps some fertilizer would restore their exuberance.}
<L>__{exterior marsh day}
<A>__{claude and ray beat the bulrushes with switches, rustling a couple of pheasants from their hiding spot. as the birds take wing, wilkins aims his shot gun and fires twice in rapid succession. both birds fall from the sky in a flutter of feathers.}
