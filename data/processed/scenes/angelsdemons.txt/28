<L>__{ext st. peter's square day}
<A>__{pulling away from the helicopter, we see a coat of arms emblazoned on its side two skeleton keys crossing a shield and papal crown. the helicopter swoops over st. peter's square, filled with more tourists than usual, due to the impending start of conclave. we drift toward a structure on the far side of the square, closer to its huge, ornate windows. as we approach, large swaths of black drop down, draping over the windows, closing off our view.}
