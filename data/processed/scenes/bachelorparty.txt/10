<A>__{o'neill we see he has his camera and backdrop set up in the camera department behind a velour curtain which blacks out the rest of the store. he's conservatively dressed in a suit, vest and tie. he looks like he could be a young republican. but under those sears clothes is a man a little off center. rick's best friend. need we say more? he takes the film out of the camera. the matronly mother is in the process of gathering up her baby.}

<A>__{o'neill he runs from behind the camera and poses with the woman.}
