<L>__{exterior ocean vista day}
<A>__{establishing. a board of tourism kind of shot. blue water. green islands. golden sun. puffy clouds. a boat chugs by with the words "tower bay" painted on the side. tyrell throws up over the side.}
<L>__{exterior ferry day}
<A>__{more of a small tub than a ferry. julie, karla, will, and tyrell are the only passengers. at the bow, julie and karla laugh and play "king of the world." julie in the prow, karla behind her.}
<C>__{julie}
<P>__{(deadpan)}
<D>__{i'm the king of the world.}
<C>__{karla}
<P>__{(deadpan)}
<D>__{no, i'm the king of the world.}
<A>__{they switch places. they look at each other and crack up laughing. karla takes in the surroundings, the salt spray, the day }
<C>__{karla}
<D>__{remind me to study real hard so someday this is normal and all that back there is somethin' i do for a weekend once every ten years.}
<C>__{julie}
<P>__{(sharing the moment)}
<D>__{i will, and you remind me of the same thing.}
<A>__{they throws their arms around each other and stare into the horizon.}
<B>__{at the stern}
<A>__{will talks to a very green tyrell.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{you just gotta breathe.}
<A>__{tyrell is trying to keep from puking }
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{can't talk right now.}
<C>__{will}
<P>__{(slightly malicious)}
<D>__{see, it's not a macho thing. it's about equilibrium in your inner ear. you could've used a patch, but it's too late now. get used to it.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{some folks just can't sail.}
<A>__{paulsen, the boat captain, overhears as he passes }
<C>__{paulsen}
<D>__{that's too bad, too, because it's the only way on or off the island.}
<P>__{(slightly ominous)}
<D>__{unless you have an accident. and then they call the coast guard.}
<A>__{julie and karla have rejoined the men.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{it's pretty remote here.}
<C>__{paulsen}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{yep. that's what the tourists pay for sun, sea, and solitude.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{are we there yet?}
<C>__{paulsen}
<D>__{few more minutes.}
<A>__{we move off the boat and reveal the island. the intrepid vacationers excitedly take in the island.}
