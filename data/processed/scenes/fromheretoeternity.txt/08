<B>__{medium shot warden and prew}
<A>__{as they come out of the orderly room. prew hoists his barracks bags to his shoulders, balancing them delicately. camera trucks with him and warden as they walk down the porch.}
<C>__{warden}
<P>__{(one of his unexpected intense bursts)}
<D>__{know what you did just now?}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{when you turned down dynanite holmes' boxing squad? you put your head in a noose. things are soft for a boxer in his compny. otherwise, you better know how to soljer.}
<C>__{phew}
<D>__{i can soljer with any man.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{this ain't the bugle corps this is straight duty.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{i will take my chances.}
<A>__{a convertible, top down, drives by and pulls up outside the orderly room. karen holmes, a tall, lean blonde woman, gets out. her skirt hikes up a little as she goes up the stairs to the orderly room. warden and prew stop walking and watch her. karen stops, glances at warden momentarily, then goes into the orderly room.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{since when is this place gettin to be the royal hawaiian?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{who's she?}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{his wife. captain holmes'.}
<A>__{they resume walking.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{you'll fight, prewitt. you'll fight because captain holmes got a bee in his hat he needs a winnin team to make mayor. and if you don't do it for him you'll do it for me. i only been in this outfit eight months myself but i learned one thing. my job is to keep him happy. the more he's happy the less he bothers me and the better i run his compny. so we know where we stand, don't we, kid?}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{i know where i stand. i don't believe that's the only way a man can get along.}
<C>__{prew}
<D>__{a man's got to make up his own mind and go his own way. it he don't, he's nothin...}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{maybe back in the days of the pioneers a man could go his own way. but not in our time, kid. today you got to play ball. you got to divide it all by two.}

<B>__{medium shot shooting into supply room}
<A>__{supply sergeant leva is eating a candy bar with one hand and leisurely typing up a form with the other. he is a foolish looking man, about thirty five.}

<C>__{leva}
<P>__{(comes up to door)}

<C>__{warden}
<D>__{i just hate to see energy wasted. any kind. besides, you'll be needin yours.}
<A>__{prew walks off, toting the barracks bags. the bang of the orderly room door is heard and lava and warden look in that direction. long shot karen holmes from warden and leva's angle as she walks along porch toward them. she is at a considerable distance. karen is about thirty. she wears a sweater and skirt. she is aware the men are studying her.}
<B>__{medium close shot warden and leva}
<A>__{watching karen. leva leans over the counter.}
<C>__{leva}
<D>__{her and them sweaters.}
<A>__{long shot karen from warden and leva's pov as she continues toward them. as much as a man can make out, she is probably not wearing a brassiere. warden's and lava's voices, loud at first, get softer and softer the nearer karen gets to camera. at end of the shot, as she is only a few yards away, they are practically whispering.}
<C>__{warden's voice}
<D>__{army women... they're cold, they got no more warmth than a diamond. there's no pleasure in them...}
<C>__{leva's voice}
<D>__{yeah, but this one knows the score... like i been tellin you.}
<C>__{warden's voice}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{is that right?}
<C>__{leva's voice}
<D>__{okay, not around here. but i was back at fort bliss with holmes. when they was married only a year or two. i heard plenty about the lady then. plenty.}
<C>__{warden's voice}
<D>__{you heard.}
<C>__{leva's voice}
<D>__{okay, never me. but a lot of them. i know some of the use she played 'around with, don't tell me.}
<C>__{warden's voice}
<D>__{i ain't tellin you. you're tellin me.}
<A>__{karen stops, a few paces from camera.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{good morning, sergeant.}
<B>__{medium shot}
<A>__{lava watches, listens avidly but discreetly in b.g. during the dialogue, karen seems irritated by warden, who looks at her coolly, appraisingly, physically.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i'm looking for my husband.}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{captain holmes just went in town, ma'am.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{oh. of course, he was to have left some things for me.}
<P>__{(stumbles slightly)}

<C>__{warden}
<D>__{no, ma'am, i don't. is there anythin i can do for you?}

<C>__{warden}
<D>__{yes, ma'am.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what is it that makes you so efficient, sergeant?}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{i couldn't help it if i was born smart, ma'am.}
<A>__{karen laughs suddenly, loudly.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i love that. well, good bye, sergeant.}
<A>__{karen turns and walks back up the porch toward her car. warden and leva watch her. when she is out of earshot leva speaks.}
<C>__{leva}
<D>__{but man, she sure is one, ain't she?}
<C>__{warden}
<D>__{one what?}
<C>__{leva}
<D>__{one woman.}

<P>__{(unconvincingly)}
<D>__{i've seen better.}
