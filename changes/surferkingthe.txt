<ACTION>__{JAFFA, a Jamaican looking fellow in his early 20's, arrives at Water World, carrying a dusty cardboard box. There are a few workers milling about, setting up the park for opening. He passes EDDIE, a 25-something grounds worker with Down's Syndrome.}

JAFFA proceeds up to the Customer Relations Kiosk, plops the box on the counter, and enters the kiosk. We see him open the box, it is full of CD's. He pulls winter covers off of an overhead area to reveal a CD player and amplifiers. He starts pushing buttons he's pushed a thousand times, and lights come on. He pulls down a microphone, and clicks a button to see if it works. He reaches into the box of CDs and pulls one out. We see it is Sheryl Crow. He gets the CD, examines it, and pops it into the CD player. He once again picks the microphone and flips the switch as he pushes the "play" button on the CD player. His voice echoes through the park.         "Soak up the Sun" begins playing.}

<ACTION>__{BIG MIKE, the park's owner/manager - a 50-something man who is portly and bald, and RICHARD THOMPSON, head lifeguard and another GUARD are on the east side of Thunder Bay. There is a post with a box on top of it that has a winter cover on it. The GUARD is standing there with a garden hose holding it so the water goes into Thunder Bay. He is obviously tired, and has been standing there a long time. We look back at the massive size of the pool and get the joke. BIG MIKE and RICHARD pull off the winter cover. The GUARD turns to look and the hose turns with him, getting BIG MIKE wet. They object and he turns back to filling Thunder Bay. RICHARD moves the GUARD to a safe distance. BIG MIKE blows the dust off of the box at the top of the post, and we see it is a large push button. BIG MIKE looks at RICHARD who nods "go ahead" and then pushes the button. They both draw back as if something big should happen, but nothing. They look at each other and BIG MIKE motions for RICHARD to go over to the wall housing the wave tank for the pool. RICHARD waves OK, and BIG MIKE pushes the button again. When nothing happens, RICHARD whacks the side of the tank with his closed fist. Suddenly a huge wave rolls out. Nodding his approval, BIG MIKE checks off an item in his clipboard.}

<ACTION>__{BIG MIKE is standing under the Fun House structure with a clipboard. He is talking to RICHARD. After talking to BIG MIKE, RICHARD shakes his head affirmatively and walks off. He glances up to the two guards above, and grins. BIG MIKE is looking at his clipboard. We see quickly the large water tank above is spilling water a bit, indicating it is full. The water tank spills over BIG MIKE drenching him. He stands there still, angry for a moment, then thinks better of it shaking his head and smiling, takes his pen and checks OK on his wet clipboard for the fun house water tank.}

The JUDGES take their notes.}

<ACTION>__{Once again three teams representing the three competing factions. Large stainless steel pots are bubbling on three propane cooking stands in front of the concession. The teams each have three members in cooking aprons, again, color coded. One from each team is stirring the team's chili while the others watch the JUDGES anxiously. Lines are forming in front of each pot, with people in line each carrying a paper chili bowl, but holding back, deferring to the JUDGES. The JUDGES are each carrying three styro cups in which to receive the chili. They each get a portion from the guard team and take a sip. They smile politely to the cooks, but turn around and spit the chili back into the cup as delicately as possible, almost as if throwing up. A concessions kid is there with a tray of waters, which they quickly take advantage of. They move on to the grounds team. They get their portions and taste the chili and nod, not bad. They take another sip of water to clear their palate and move on to the concessions team. The portions are proudly scooped. They take a taste, smile and take some more.     They huddle for a moment and then place a blue ribbon on the concessions pot. The lines quickly rearrange and merge themselves so that everyone is in line for the concessions pot.}

<DIAL>__{I don't know...we have a pretty good time at AOKEE's.}
<CHAR>__{TIFFANY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You know, that's what I hear. Maybe I should work there next summer.}
<ACTION>__{ALEX, ROBBIE, KATIE and AMY all say these lines pretty much at the same time.}
<CHAR>__{ROBBIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You wouldn't like it...}
<CHAR>__{ALEX} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That's a bad idea...}
<CHAR>__{KATIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And you're such a good guard...}
<CHAR>__{AMY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You'd be miserable...}
<CHAR>__{TIFFANY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Maybe you're right.    See you around...}
<ACTION>__{EDDIE appears out of the time shack wearing his tuxedo t shirt.}
<CHAR>__{EDDIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(almost singing)}
<DIAL>__{Tiffany!}
<ACTION>__{He walks up to her driver's side.}
<CHAR>__{TIFFANY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(feeling charitable, warmly)}
<DIAL>__{Hello, Eddie.}
<ACTION>__{EDDIE shows there is nothing in his hands, then reaches into the car and from behind TIFFANY's ear pulls a plastic Easter Egg out. He hands it to her, and she opens it. A beautiful butterfly flies out and away. She is momentarily entranced.}
<CHAR>__{TIFFANY } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{You know, that's one of the most beautiful things I've ever seen.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(pause, thinking, what the heck)}
<DIAL>__{Hop in Eddie, let me give you a ride home.}
<ACTION>__{EDDIE waves his hand for HER to scoot over so he can drive. She is surprised, but does, almost reflexively. He gets in and he looks at ALEX, ROBBIE, KATIE and AMY grinning broadly as he pulls away. ALEX, ROBBIE, KATIE and AMY just watch in stunned silence as EDDIE and TIFFANY drive off.}
<CHAR>__{ALEX} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(collecting himself)}
<DIAL>__{Well. Just another summer at Water World.}
<ACTION>__{The group begins walking toward the exit gate, as we go wide and helicopter upward. They get smaller and smaller in the shot as we hear the conversation continue.}
<CHAR>__{ROBBIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You know Katie, I really am sorry I was such a jerk this summer.}
<CHAR>__{KATIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We'll be going to the same high school. You'll have plenty of chances to make it up to me. Let's see, there's Homecoming, the Christmas Dance, Valentines Day...and of course, the prom...}
<CHAR>__{ROBBIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Alex?}
<CHAR>__{ALEX} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah?}
<CHAR>__{ROBBIE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm gonna need to borrow twenty bucks.}
<CHAR>__{ALEX} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yep.}
<ACTION>__{We helicopter up for a final shot over the whole park.}
