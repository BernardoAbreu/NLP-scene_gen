<A>__{edgar, now standing above lilly. he bends down, checking the chains that bind her. his face moves close to her so that he can smell her. hear her heart pounding. see the scars from his previous attack. then a noise, echoing through the tunnels. the sound of the mad infected denizens of the containment zone, screaming out into the night. edgar smiles.}
<C>__{edgar}
<D>__{it almost sounds like children playing, don't you think?}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{no.}

<D>__{i looked at your body. you have borne a child.}
<A>__{lilly's features tense.}

<D>__{why don't you just kill me?}
<A>__{edgar just smiles. lilly spits in his face and screams at him.}

<D>__{you don't have to do this. you can change things.}
<A>__{edgar places his head in his hands, he seems to be weeping.}
