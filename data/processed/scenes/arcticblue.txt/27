<A>__{devil's cauldron hot springs is a cluster of twenty tiny dwellings connected by an unpainted boardwalk. the town squats, ugly and temporary looking, in a dirt clearing fifty miles north of the arctic circle. thirty miles east of the pipeline, it's almost dead center of interior alaska. at the edge of town is a gravel airstrip. mixed with the prospector era sod roof cabins are a few prefabricated houses. the boon brought by men building the pipeline is long gone. now only a few itinerant loggers, natives and bush dwellers remain to fight boredom, each other and the depression of the oncoming winter. enough steam escapes from the hot springs to perpetually blanket the valley with fog. the spa is log walled and horseshoe shaped, with partitioned baths inside. facing it are a mud walled fire bath, a wooden steam bath called a maqi, six one room cabins for let, and an unused dance hall. leo meyerling opens the tailgate of a dodge truck with the northland petroleum logo and "district supervisor" on the door. meyerling is short and bald with a completely disreputable face. he staples a poster on a wall. it has a picture of him on it, and:}
