<L>__{exterior shaded creek later}
<A>__{grant sits on a boulder beside a creek, looking miserable, downing a six pack. he throws an empty can into the creek, when he glances down and sees particles flowing down the river. grant slides off the boulder. he kneels and examines the particles. they shimmer in the moonbeams coming down between the trees. grant peers up the creek from where the particles are coming. he sees a gap on the edge of the creek, where water splashes and is diverted in streamlets down the hill. he approaches the spot, and comes upon a small crater on the side of the creek. the meteorite is inside the crater, but it's cracked into pieces. the rock seems almost organic, like a shell. the shimmery specks are part of the shell itself, flecking off into the creek and rushing downstream. grant crouches. he touches the meteorite, and feels some sort of goo inside it. it's sticky. he notices a strip of the same slime leading out of the crater itself and into the woods. grant, curiously, slowly, follows the slimy trail. he comes to a flurry of colorful wild flowers. something is rustling the flowers ever so slightly. he moves in closer. a gelatinous yellow organism slithers sluggishly between the flowers. the organism is a mound a few inches high, gross and veiny, yet as colorful as the flowers around it. a small cavity on the apex of the organism constricts and expands lightly. i guess it's not worth keeping secret that this thing looks a tad like a bright yellow vagina.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{what the...?}
<A>__{grant is a little freaked out by this thing, even frightened. he looks around for someone else.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{hey, anybody 'round here? 'lo?}
<A>__{no one answers. grant looks down at the organism, unsure. he picks up a tree branch. grant softly prods the organism with the pointy end of the branch. nothing happens. he does it again. the thing pulses a little, and surges toward grant. grand pokes it again. a small, thin quill a spore emerges from the cavity in the center of the organism. the spore is quivering and, as it trembles upward, little bulbed spurs pop up as well. grant slowly bends down to look at it when the spore suddenly shoots out. it strikes grant in the stomach.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{ow! fuck!}
<A>__{grant yanks up his shirt, looking at a wound on his abdomen. he watches as the spore quivers and disappears inside him. he clutches his stomach, screams in agony. he falls back into the colorful flowers. his body convulses.}
