<C>__{garvey}
<P>__{(smoothly)}
<D>__{don't be a fool, rocklin. you know you can't get away with a yarn like that. why don't you save yourself and everyone else a lot of trouble by surrendering to the sheriff? after all, it isn't such a crime in these parts to kill a man in self defense.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{self defense?}
<C>__{garvey}
<D>__{everyone knows what clint was like. he probably lost his head and pulled a gun on you, like he did at the sun up that night. wasn't that it?}
<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(grimly; after a little pause)}
<D>__{no, that wasn't it. and till i do what i got to do, i ain't surrenderin' to anybody least of all to your pal here.}
<P>__{(indicates sheriff)}
<D>__{if i got to be shot for knowing too much, it ain't going to be in the back, in a framed up jail break.}
<B>__{close shot}
<A>__{arly, who has been staring at rocklin in frowning bewilderment.}
<C>__{arly}
<D>__{but if someone's trying to kill you, why didn't they do it just now? why did they have to kill clint?}
<B>__{close shot}
<A>__{rocklin.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{guess they wanted to get clint, too. doin' it this way they get us both. clint first an' me afterwards like i jus' said.}
<B>__{med. shot}

<D>__{quit fancy talk. who's "they?"}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{i might be able to tell you that later.}
<C>__{jackson}
<P>__{(quickly)}

<C>__{rocklin}
<P>__{(raises his gun)}
<D>__{am i?}
<A>__{the crowd tenses. rocklin eyes them grimly.}
<C>__{rocklin}
<D>__{the first one that moves gets it.}
<A>__{he moves over to the open window, and with his gun leveled on the mob, steps out onto the verandah. once outside, he suddenly lets the window fall and disappears. a shot from jackson's gun shatters a pane, during which time there has been a rush to the window. it is arly and dave who reach it first, and feigning an attempt to raise the window, they momentarily delay pursuit.}
<B>__{at the door leading from the room}
<A>__{there is the inevitable jam as the pushing, yelling crowd all try to exit at once.}
