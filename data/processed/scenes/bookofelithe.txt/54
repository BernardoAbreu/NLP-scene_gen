<L>__{exterior desert day}
<A>__{late afternoon. the sun hangs low on the horizon. we're far from the road. nothing but scrub brush and a few prairie dog burrows dotted around. a prairie dog pops its head up, scans the horizon. sniffing the air, whiskers twitching... and is skewered by an arrow. thirty yards away, one of the pieces of scrub brush appears to come alive. and then we realize it is eli's ghillie suit, camouflaging both he and solara beneath it. eli casts off the camouflage net and walks toward the dead prairie dog. solara just stands there, appalled.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{you killed it! that cute little thing!}
<A>__{eli picks up the dead animal by the scruff.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{it's good eating, is what it is.}
<A>__{he yanks out the bloody arrow. solara looks away. when she turns back, eli is standing right there, holding the dead animal in front of her face. she yelps in surprise and staggers backward, falling on her butt.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{that's not funny.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{if you're going to be on the road, you can't be picky about what you eat. you eat what's there to eat.}
<C>__{solara}
<D>__{i'm not eating that.}
<C>__{eli}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{more for me.}
