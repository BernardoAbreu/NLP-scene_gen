<L>__{int papal office night}
<A>__{ the papal office, where the camerlengo, rocher, olivetti, and vittoria are gathered again, as are half a dozen other security officers. it's crowded, busy, little knots of jurisdictional arguments and competing theories around the room. the camerlengo, at his desk, is stunned, speaking to olivetti. langdon edges close enough to hear, but not too close.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{when did this call come in?}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{three, four minutes ago. the same voice as on the tape. we're analyzing the accent now, alsatian is our best guess at the moment.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{and he actually claimed responsibility for the death of his holiness?}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{not personally, but he said it was the illuminati. he said they murdered him.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{that's ridiculous, the holy father died of a stroke. did he say how they claim to have done it?}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{the pope's own medication. a drug known as heparin?}
<A>__{there is silence for a moment. rocher looks up. looks away.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{the pope took heparin?}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{he had thrombophlebitis. he took an injection once a day. but no one knew that.}
<C>__{olivetti}
<D>__{someone knew.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{his holiness had health concerns; he was subject to seizures as well. but he took steps to make sure he was watched. for safety. that's all he wished to be made public, and that's all we should discuss.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<P>__{(ignoring him)}
<D>__{heparin is lethal in the wrong dosage. an overdose would cause massive internal bleeding and brain hemorrhages. at first it might look like a stroke, but in a few days his body would show signs, we could easily }
<A>__{rocher spins on her, livid.}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{ms. vetra, in case you're unaware, papal autopsies are prohibited by vatican law. we are not about to defile his holiness's body just because his enemies claim to }
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{of course we're not. we'll make a public announcement refuting this absurd claim.}
<A>__{father simeon, cardinal mortati's aide, steps forward.}
<C>__{fr. simeon}
<D>__{i'm afraid that's out of the question. cardinal mortati has insisted this entire matter be kept internal.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{cardinal mortati shouldn't even be aware of this, he's locked in conclave.}
<C>__{fr. simeon}
<D>__{his final instructions before sealing the doors were very clear no outside communications unless absolutely necessary.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{cardinal mortati will remember that he is dean of the college of cardinals, not his holiness himself.}
<C>__{fr. simeon}
<D>__{as you say. yet, technically, now that conclave has begun, it is his privilege and duty to control public announcements. i've drafted a short release about the incident in the square, but any other statements are specifically prohibited. for that, the cardinal has asked me to remind you we have a chimney.}
<A>__{the camerlengo just stares at him, a power struggle. which he is going to lose.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{as you say.}
<P>__{(turns away)}
<D>__{commander rocher, the search for the device?}
<C>__{rocher}
<D>__{we've turned the power off and on to about twenty percent of vatican city. nothing on the video yet.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{mr. langdon, you've been right so far, if belatedly, about the path. it's now nine fifteen, how quickly can you find the next church?}
<A>__{langdon refers to a map spread out on the desk.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{the line of the breath in the carving points due east, directly away from vatican city, but there are five lines, so there's room for error.}
<A>__{while he talks, an aide in a business suit is ushered quietly in the door by a swiss guardsman. he's carrying a satchel. vittoria recognizes him, and he goes to her.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{there are about twenty churches that intersect it. none of their names invoke "fire," but there must be a bernini sculpture inside one of them that does. i'm going to need to get back into the archives to find it.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<P>__{(to olivetti)}
<D>__{escort him.}
<A>__{langdon looks to vittoria you coming? she looks up from a table, where she's opened the satchel brought in by the aide. she holds two leather bound books in her hand.}
<C>__{vittoria}
<D>__{the journals i asked for. i'd like to stay here and study them. if leonardo told anyone else about our project, that could be the killer.}
<C>__{camerlengo}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{the group starts to break up, half of them headed for the doors. as langdon rolls up the map on the desk, the camerlengo notices his black clothes for the first time.}
<C>__{camerlengo }
<D>__{professor, would it surprise you to find those clothes suit you?}
<A>__{langdon manages a sliver of a smile, starting to like this guy.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{it would surprise the hell out of me.}
