<L>__{interior hospital grammy's room}
<A>__{in a dimly lit hospital room, a very old woman lies in a bed. she is hooked up to an i.v. and several monitors. kirk comes in and forces a smile. grammy's voice is weak and shaky.}
<C>__{grammy}
<D>__{there you are big slick. did you bring 'em?}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{grammy, you really shouldn't...}
<C>__{grammy}
<D>__{just hand 'em over. i'm on death's door and you know it.}
<A>__{kirk sits and reluctantly hands her a pack of cigarettes.}
<C>__{grammy }
<D>__{oh, for christ's sake. filters?}
<A>__{grammy lights up a smoke and savors a long drag. kirk tears up at how slightly his grandmother clings to life.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i love you grammy.}
<C>__{grammy}
<D>__{don't start that shit now. you're looking at one lucky old broad who's done a lot skydiving, rollerderby, colored fellas. i got no complaints. so when the check comes i don't want any blubbering or bullshit outta you. just enjoy your life like i did mine and raise a glass to your old grammy once in a while.}
<A>__{kirk hugs her and he cries a bit.}
<C>__{grammy }
