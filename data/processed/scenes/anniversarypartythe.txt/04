<L>__{interior bedroom later}
<A>__{joe stands behind sally in front of the full length mirror, his arms around her, stroking her belly.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i love you. most beautiful woman in the world.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{hardly...}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{accept a compliment.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i think you're the most beautiful woman in the world.}
<A>__{they move toward the bed.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what did you get me?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{in the morning, after everyone's gone and there's just us.}
<A>__{she pushes him on the bed.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{kiss my eyes.}
<A>__{she does.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{my wrists.}
<A>__{he does.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{kiss the back of my knees.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{through the sweats or not?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{not.}
<A>__{she pulls down his sweats. she kisses the back of his knees. he turns, stares up at her.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you didn't kiss anyone else's knees, did you?}
<A>__{sally shakes her head.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{no. did you?}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(after a beat)}
<D>__{no. i missed that.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i missed all of you. we're okay, aren't we?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{we're great.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i mean, you're really back.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{for good.}
<A>__{they begin to make love...the phone rings.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{don't get it.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{well, it might be clair. they're threatening not to come...}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{they can't find a sitter...}
<P>__{(into the receiver)}
<D>__{hello? excuse me? yes, uh, hold on.}
<P>__{(she looks at joe)}
<D>__{just a moment.}
<P>__{(puts the call on hold)}
<D>__{it's skye davidson. she needs directions to the house. you invited skye fucking davidson to our anniversary party?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{okay. i'm sorry, look, i meant to tell you. it was the only chance i had to meet her.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{you invited her to our anniversary party? i didn't even invite my mother.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{she goes on location tomorrow. sally, i'm sorry. look, i can't keep her on hold.}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(pissed)}
<D>__{no, no of course not. it's skye fucking davidson, for fuck's sake.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(regards her)}
<D>__{you want me to uninvite her?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{no, no of course not. how old is she? twenty fucking two?}
<A>__{she gets out of bed, starts into the bathroom. the camera is with her.}
<C>__{sally }
<P>__{(into the bathroom mirror)}
<D>__{and she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(into the receiver)}
<D>__{skye!}
<P>__{(his face lights)}
<D>__{i'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually.}
<P>__{(flattered)}
<D>__{you read the book again? well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. we tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again. if you're coming from laurel, you want to take sunset west, we're just past will rogers state park. three blocks west of that, you want to hang right. it's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left.}
<A>__{sally's started the bath, and is watching him from the doorway. he meets her eyes mid sentence.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{oh? i don't think tonight. i'm sure they're well behaved. all our friends have dogs, and they always want to bring them. we'd be outnumbered, you see? so we sort of put a ban on it. sorry.}
<A>__{he rolls his eyes. sally walks back into the bathroom, she isn't buying it.}
<D>__{joe (o.s.) (cont'd) i'm looking forward to meeting you, too. and skye, i'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. eternally grateful, really.}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(into the bathroom mirror)}
<D>__{i'm going to throw up.}
<C>__{joe }
<D>__{i can't imagine anyone else playing genna.}
<C>__{sally}
<P>__{(sanguine)}
<D>__{really?}
