<L>__{interior hospital. chemotherapy room later}
<A>__{adam is seated in a plush leather chair where he's hooked into a chemo drip. he's surrounded by a dozen gaunt, hairless patients. he is the youngest patient by at least 20 years. completely overwhelmed, adam spots a bald woman sitting quietly knitting. she's at peace with herself. her zen like state helps adam relax. adam skims through a catalogue of clothing intended for cancer patients until he notices henry (50), a very small man sitting in a wheel chair which is attached to a respirator. despite the fact that every breath henry takes looks like it might kill him, he barks derogatory statements at the wall. adam looks on in terror. the genial mitch(85) notices.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{that's henry.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{is he okay?}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{he's always like that.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(terrified)}
<D>__{is that going to happen to me?}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{best not worry about these things.}
<A>__{alan (84), the contentious old man sitting next to mitch chimes in.}
<C>__{alan}
<P>__{(to adam)}
<D>__{want a hit?}
<A>__{adam looks down to see that alan is holding a one hitter full of weed.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{it makes it all a little easier to handle.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(paranoid)}
<D>__{what if someone sees us?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{don't be such an old man. look at this place, it's like death row in here, they don't give a shit what we do.}
<A>__{adam reluctantly takes a hit.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{how old are you?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{twenty five.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{you're lucky. life only gets worse anyway.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{alan, stop it.}
<P>__{(to adam)}
<D>__{don't listen to him, he's just messing with you.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{no i'm not.}
<P>__{(to adam)}
<D>__{it's all downhill from here. trust me. first your hair's going to fall out, then your balls will shrink. you'll marry a woman, or man, who'll suck every penny out of your savings and then leave you for a fitness instructor in a teal miata. then, to top it all off, your kids will one day stop talking to you because their therapist, who you pay for, tells them you're the reason they're so fucked up.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{you'll have to excuse alan here, he's going through a rough time.}
<C>__{alan}
<P>__{(to adam)}
<D>__{i'm just being realistic. you want some advice?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{not really.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{don't end up a victim like the rest of `em. life sucks, the earlier you accept it, the better off you'll be.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i got to tell you, i was really nervous about this whole cancer thing, and then i met you guys, and boy do i feel better.}
<A>__{alan and mitch laugh.}
<C>__{alan}
<P>__{(to mitch)}
<D>__{i like this kid.}
<P>__{(to adam)}
<D>__{i'm alan liebowitz: stage 4 lymphoma. pleased to meet you.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{mitch horowitz, metastatic prostate cancer.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{adam schwartz, schwannoma neurofibrosarcomas.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{what the fuck is that?...sounds like the greek dish i had for lunch.}
<A>__{adam is beginning to feel the effects of the weed.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{... man this pot is really strong.}
<C>__{mitch}
<D>__{medicinal.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{good shit eh.}
<A>__{adam stares off into space. he's really high, almost like he's tripping. the walls start spinning.}
