<L>__{exterior campus green day}
<A>__{it is bright and sunny.}
<L>__{interior mr scott's classroom day}
<A>__{mr scott, who is black, presides over his class. marcus is reading from his story, vi at his side. catherine, a stunning intellectual, sits near the teacher. the rest of the students (amy, elli, etc.) listen closely and take notes.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{"...but when he saw her...it was as if he could walk like a normal person. his legs didn't swing, his arms didn't spaz away...he wasn't a freak any more, for she made him forget his affliction. no more cerebral palsy! from now on "cp" stood for...cerebral person. he was a cerebral person.}
<A>__{pause. marcus and vi exchange looks.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i thought it was really good, marcus...really moving and emotional.}
<C>__{elli}
<D>__{yeah, i thought it was really emotional, too.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{and i mean, really good word choices. it kind of reminded me a little of faulkner, but east coast and disabled.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{or flannery o'connor. she had multiple sclerosis.}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{and borges. he was blind.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{updike has psoriasis.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{catherine}

<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{mr scott}
<D>__{anyone else?}
<A>__{no response.}
<C>__{mr scott}
<D>__{catherine is right. the story's a piece of shit. you express nothing but banalities and, formally speaking, are unable to construct a single compelling sentence. you ride on a wave of cliches so worn, in fact, it actually approaches a level of grotesquerie. ad your subtitle, 'the rawness of truth' is that supposed to be a joke of some sort? or are you just being pretentious?}
<P>__{(beat; then checking his class book)}
<D>__{ok. who's next?}
