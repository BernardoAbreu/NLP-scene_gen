<A>__{back to the rear of the house: stacks of plastic explosives, buckets of shrapnel, two paramedics working feverishly on a swat officer hit multiple times. fleury goes about his business like a man isn't dying six feet away. sykes is a kid in a candy store: rummaging through explosives, blasting caps, shrapnel.}
