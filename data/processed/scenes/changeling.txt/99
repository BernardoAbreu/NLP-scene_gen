<A>__{curtains drawn, dark, cocooned against the outside world. ybarra makes a circuit of the room, then stops at a creak of wood from a closet. he moves toward it. pauses. reaches for the doorknob...as suddenly a clock chimes loudly and the closet explodes outward and sanford clark, 15, runs out. he slams into ybarra, knocking him down. they go down in a tumble of limbs, wrestling on the floor as sanford tries to escape.}
