<L>__{exterior bristow's office day}
<A>__{med. shot of haven and mrs. caslon. haven is talking to her with apparent casualness because he realizes that charlie can see him.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i wonder if you'd do me a favor?}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{why, surely.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{it's a big favor, and i wouldn't blame you if you refused.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i want to haul some gold from your mine.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{that is a big favor.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{i know it seems impossible to you, but that's one reason why i'm here to find cut what makes it impossible.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<D>__{isn't that very risky?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{that's why i couldn't go to anyone but you.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<P>__{(hesitating)}
<D>__{i'm just wondering if we shouldn't speak to captain iles first.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{you know what he'd say.}
<P>__{(she smiles grimly and nods)}
<D>__{he'd advise against it but if it works my way, it may clear everything up for all of us and for iles too. the war department doesn't like all that gold around an army post.}
<A>__{he watches her face as she thinks it over.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{we're working too much in the dark. this may be the only way to see something. it's a risk but someone has to take it...}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{who else will know of it?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{just us. that'll be all who know and that's the idea.}
<C>__{mrs. caslon}
<P>__{(simply)}
<D>__{i will arrange it.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{don't look so grim. it's only your gold and my skin. and smile when you walk away as though we'd been talking about what a dry summer it's been.}
<A>__{she smiles and haven pats her shoulder.}
