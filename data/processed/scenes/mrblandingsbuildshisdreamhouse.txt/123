<A>__{muriel opens the closet door revealing jim and bill, who have been locked in the closet for the last hour. each leans against the wall, arms folded, in an attitude of boredom and disgust. without a word jim and bill exit from the closet. the three start down the stairs.}

<D>__{you mean seven fifteen.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{no, dad, six fifteen.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{what about the seven fifteen i'm supposed to take to the office every morning?!}
<C>__{betsy}
<P>__{(consulting timetable)}

<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{perhaps if you started earlier you could quit earlier.}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(sharply)}

<D>__{maybe you can have the railroad push the train up to four fifteen then you won't have to go to bed at all!}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{uncle bill, you're going to miss your train!}
<C>__{muriel}
<D>__{jim, you clean up this mess. i will drive bill to the station and pick up some cold cuts for dinner.}

<D>__{you'd better hurry!}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(indicating upstairs closet)}
