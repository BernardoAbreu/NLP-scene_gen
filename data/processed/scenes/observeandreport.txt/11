<L>__{interior mall day}
<A>__{ronnie stands in the middle of the mall and supervises the early morning mall walkers as they stride around the outer marked lane. it's all senior citizens.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{slow it down. watch your speed there. this ain't a race. hey, second time, slow it down.}
<A>__{mark, the mall manager, walks up to ronnie.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i've been looking all over for you.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{i haven't been hiding, but some things that i have to do are better to keep hidden from you and 'official' eyes. trust me, it's best all around if there are no bodies to clean up.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{so you may or may not have heard, but this morning, several women were assaulted just outside the front doors by a crazy pervert.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{for the love of god.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i know, it's horrible.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{you want me to phone this one in to the police?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{not just yet. see if we call the police, they'll be a big scandal and something like that could kill what little traffic we have at this mall. what i need you to do is watch out for this pervert and if you see him, try to stop him or quietly phone it in so we can handle this discreetly.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{hold on, mark. let me make sure i understand you. you're telling me to deny my primary objective of observing and reporting crime and at the same time, you're giving me authorization to handle this case on my own.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i'm just saying keep an eye out and keep quiet.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{so basically, i'm in charge of this whole investigation.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{there's no investigation.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{not yet. okay, mark, i will do it, but i'm gonna need a few things first.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{you can't carry a gun.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{well, i'm gonna need a new title. something to instill fear in the criminal mind. how about director of mall intelligence?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{head of mall security.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{that's perfect.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{and it doesn't come with a raise.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{got it.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{and the new title stays between us.}
<C>__{ronnie}
<D>__{understood. thank you for this opportunity, mark. i won't let you down.}
