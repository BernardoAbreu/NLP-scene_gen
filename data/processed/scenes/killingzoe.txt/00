<L>__{interior taxi cab moving day}
<A>__{rain falls on the rear window of a taxi parked in the taxi zone of the charles de gualle airport. aside from the incessant tapping of rain on the roof of the cab we hear the sounds of the airport: the almost monotonic loudspeaker declaring in french that loitering is not permissible and that should any bags be left unattended that they will be destroyed; the honking of the horns from other automobiles; the unintelligible chatter of people as they get their bearings. inside the cab, playing on the radio, is angelique kidjo's funky song "batonga". then, the rear door to the cab opens and in an extreme close up we see zed, a young man with wild, almost mesmerizing eyes shielded by small round glasses, and with a head of nappy red hair. his face has drops on it from the flurry outside. he settles himself, then looks to the cab driver, an easy going senegalese frenchman, in the front seat.}
