<A>__{flip. flip. flip. alex's faint shadow continues moving about the room. the fan head swivels away, allowing the pages to settle... upon a louvre masterpiece, francisco de zurbarans lying in the state of st. bonaventura. camera creeps in, teasingly on the dark faced corpse. the pages begin to turn once again. tighter, ominous angle the desk fan there is more of a hint of conincidence as the blades whirl and head swivels. the boy's figure passes, blocking the breeze.}

<C>__{alex}
<D>__{whoa! whoa! mom, you gotta leave that on. it's like... the tag made the last flight without crashin' or anything, right? so, it should stay on, or with, the bag for good luck.}
