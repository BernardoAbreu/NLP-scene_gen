<C>__{gene}
<D>__{he's deaf.}

<C>__{gene}
<D>__{he can't hear a word we're saying.}
<A>__{mr. smith looks at the sign. huey stops what he's doing "what the fuck?" he almost says it aloud, then:}

<D>__{you wouldn't be kidding me now, would you, mr. watson?}
<P>__{(to huey's back)}
<D>__{hey, nigger! is that right? you can't hear me? nigger?}
<A>__{huey's face settles into something cold. what's he going to do? he stands, looks at gene, who stares back at him, then slowly turns around, looks at mr. smith and breaks into a jive ass grin.}
<C>__{huey}
<D>__{why, looky here. my customer quotient just got multiplied by two. what do you think of that? you'll have to forgive me, sir. didn't hear your approach. fact of the matter is, i'm deef as a post. compliments of the united states army...}
