<L>__{interior safeway night}
<A>__{hector is pushing a cart around a large safeway. the place is almost deserted. betsy and thomas are tagging along. for every four items hector puts in his cart betsy removes three and returns them to the shelf. hector notices and puts up with it for a while. but when betsy returns the rolls of kitchen towel he has selected he makes a stand. he turns to face her.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{what's wrong with that? it's a kitchen roll... why can't i pick a kitchen roll?}
<A>__{betsy is defiant.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{it's bleached... and it isn't recycled... you don't care... you just buy junk...}
<A>__{she picks up a more friendly brand of kitchen towel from the shelf and throws it into the cart. hector has the sense to back down.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{good point, betsy...}
<A>__{betsy keeps on the attack.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{everything you buy is junk... i don't eat steak... and what's this...}
<A>__{she prods a packet of frozen hamburgers.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{ugh! why don't you ask us what we like... it'll save you money... you buy junk, we won't eat it...}
<A>__{a trace of girlish common sense has crept into her voice. hector warms to her.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{you're right.}
<A>__{hector pushes the cart to her.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{well, get to it... i will just tag along...}
<A>__{betsy moves off with the cart.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{i do it every week anyway.}
<A>__{thomas backs her up.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{she does. she tells us what to eat. we let her.}
<A>__{hector follows them up the aisle.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{can i just keep a couple of those steaks? we can't live on chicken.}
