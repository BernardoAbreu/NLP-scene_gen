<A>__{looking down at his shin, noticing the blood. inconvenienced but not in pain. he shuts the cage doors. pauses only to fire off half a clip at the switch panel. shreds it. bond leaps to his feet, racing forward, firing gets to the elevator as renard disappears upwards with a smile. he points down...underneath him... bond looks down. his p.o.v. beneath the elevator...a makeshift explosive device...sticks of dynamite wrapped around a detonator, set to explode eyes wide, bond looks back to the doors then to the switch panel now just a chaos of sparking wires.}
