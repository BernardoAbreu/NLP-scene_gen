<A>__{bam! momma beast lands on the roof. she reaches inside and yanks out bartender's throat. the car veers. tuffy rights it, leaning over and stomping on the gas. momma yanks at the door, pulling it open. tuffy pushes out bartender's corpse and jerks the wheel.}
<B>__{in the back}
<A>__{momma beast falls back, knocking down heroine. momma beast nearly falls out, but manages to grab the rear gate with one claw. defenseless, heroine backs away. momma beast holds on tightly, pulling herself onto the bed of the truck. tuffy stares back through the glass, unable to do anything. momma beast lunges towards heroine. momma beast's claw snags heroine's locket, jerking heroine right up to the creature's face. the locket catches momma's attention for split second. her remaining eye goes from the picture of charlie to heroine. momma's mouth opens wide. heroine screams! and then, a beam of the rising sun catches the gold locket and burns into momma's eye. in one quick motion, she's gone, taking the locket with her. heroine lets out her breath, reaching around her neck for what is no longer there. the truck skids to a halt. tuffy jumps out.}
