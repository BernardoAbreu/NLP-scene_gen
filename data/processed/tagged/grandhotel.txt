<T>__{dissolve into:}
<A>__{clock. it is twenty minutes to one and then moves slowly into the crowd of busy mid day business jumble. camera pushes through crowd and passes by the foot of the steps that lead up to the restaurant. in its journey, it passes kringelein looking up. he is not pointed. the camera then saunters getting a slow profile movement across near senf's desk. senf is very busy. the camera now passes profile the desk of senf. general action. senf stands before his background of slots and keys. we proceed until we are facing the elevator. at that moment the elevator is opening. among the people who emerge is suzette, who moves too quickly for us to distinguish who she is. the camera pans quickly with her and in the distance we hear her saying to senf:}
<C>__{suzette}
<D>__{madam grusinskaya will not want her car.}
<A>__{this line is only just above the general clatter of action but it is picked up sharply first by senf then by bell captain and as the camera slowly turns around, we see the boy going towards the door and we hear the voice in the distance, saying:}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{cancel madam grusinskaya's car.}
<A>__{the camera now backs away from the scene into the bar. (a section.) it backs to the back of the bar and proceeds in profile behind the backs of the barmen. a mixed crowd of people drinking before their lunch. we pick up the doctor, leaning his head upon his hands, looking into space. the woman next to him, a noisy blonde, is laughing. the doctor glances up at her she glances at the doctor. she and the audience see the scarred side of his face the laugh dies on her lips and she turns suddenly to her companion, who is the baron. we do not get much of a chance to see him because at that instant he is glancing at his watch, his shoulders are turning away from the camera and he moves out towards the lobby. back up a few feet and lap dissolve : as you move into the main aisle of busy room in restaurant. great activity of waiters. the bustle and activity of fashionable lunchtime. a string orchestra is playing. among other things, we pick up the smiling face of the pompous maitre d'hotel, he has apparently just shown someone important to a table. the camera watches his face and follows him. his face just as camera reaches service table. the pompous maitre d'hotel now becomes a thing of drama as he demands of a waiter:}
<C>__{maitre d'hotel}
<D>__{where is that gentleman's soup?}
<A>__{the waiter, frightened and perspiring, doesn't bother to argue he tears off quickly (camera following him) to another service table. the waiter seizes buss boy's arm:}

<D>__{where's that soup?}
<A>__{boy goes off at great rate of speed, camera follows him, into service room of kitchen. boy stops at soup chef's counter. he is not the only waiter wanting soup at that moment. he pushes his way to the front and puts his ticket forward.}

<D>__{quick come on come on...}
<A>__{the soup chef, used to impatient waiters, makes no exception of the young man. he looks at him as much as to say: "i will slap you on the mouth." at the same time he is pulling over a cauldron of soup.}

<A>__{cauldron of soup being pulled over it dislodges a small cauldron that is near the edge. we see the soup fall and hear the scream of a woman before showing her agonized face she has been scalded. general steamy confusion. the chef has filled the plate. we proceed the buss boy out. half way down the aisle, the waiter takes it from him. the camera follows the waiter who places the soup before mr. preysing. preysing has been waiting, with his serviette carefully tucked in his collar. his spoon is in his hand. a horrible man, ready for action. the soup is in front of him, he tastes it, pushes it away, frowns, we feel he is going to tear the place down.}

"no, there is not time." she is returning calmly. she crosses to the dressing table and takes the veronal out of a drawer. she looks at it thoughtfully, her lips are trembling a little. she moves to the radiator as if to seek warmth. she sinks into a chair and her head droops over her folded hands which contain the veronal, she seems to pray. the baron comes from the closet now is his chance, he looks at the door but can't make it. looks on the floor for the key which grusinskaya has previously thrown there, his eyes fall upon the note on the telephone he reads it. it is a death farewell note to suzette do not insert it. at this moment she has finished, the baron returns to his hiding place. she makes the sign of a cross and goes to her bed. she looks around nervously, apprehensively like a deer who has heard something, then reassured. she places the veronal on the night table beside the glass of water. she is quiet and deliberate. she arranges the pillows under her head and lies down. she reaches for the bottle of veronal and empties it generously in her hand. she has to lean away upon one elbow, from the baron's position, in order to balance herself. the baron steps like a cat from his hiding place. he goes to the bedside noiselessly and stands there. she reaches for the glass her hand stretches out for the glass. the baron takes her wrist suddenly. she turns quickly looking at him. the glass falls to the floor with a crash and breaks. as she moves, the veronal falls out of her hands upon the bed. she struggles up to a sitting position.}

<C>__{baron}
<P>__{(naive as he says frankly)}
<D>__{i should like to smoke.}
<A>__{she rises. she had expected something else. his reply strikes her as chivalrous and considerate. she crosses to the writing table brings back her little cigarette box which she holds out to him. he takes a cigarette and lights it. she watches him curiously. she smiles, as she watches him greedily inhale the smoke. she crosses and sits before her looking glass. she brushes her hair back and powders her face. she looks into the mirror, we feel that she has regained a desire to live. he crosses and looks at her in the mirror, he smiles.}
<C>__{grusinskaya}
<D>__{why do you smile?}
