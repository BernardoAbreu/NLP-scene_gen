<D>__{rocco, his friends must be hungry. see what you can do, but i'd like to keep them away from the guests.}

<D>__{sure, mikey.}
<A>__{he gathers up some of his papers, as the three men remain silent, waiting for him to go before they talk. it's clear tom doesn't want to be excluded.}

<C>__{ola}
<D>__{the hotel's registered owners are one jacob lawrence, and sidney barclay, both beverly hills attorneys. in reality it's split between the old lakeville road group from cleveland, and our friend in miami. he takes care of others outside the country, you know who i mean. meyer klingman runs the store, and does all right, but i've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in miami will go along with you.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{he's very kind, tell him it's appreciated. i'm sure it will be profitable all the way around.}
<C>__{ola}
<D>__{he always makes money for his partners. one by one, our old friends are gone. death, natural or not, prison, deported. our friend in miami is the only one left, because he always made money for his partners.}
