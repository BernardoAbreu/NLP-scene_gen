<L>__{interior bar day}
<A>__{it is the kind of bar businessmen drink at in the afternoon. dark wood and padded leather. the bartender, joking with a cluster of men, does not notice corky as she moves up to the bar.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{the bartender glances over.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{draft beer and a tnt.}
<A>__{corky eyes the men, who stare into their drinks. the bartender says nothing as he puts the drinks in front of her. corky heads for her table, ignoring the whispers and snickers. corky and violet, the only women in the room, sit close together at a far corner table. violet's voice is hushed.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{shelly was skimming from the business. he came to see me yesterday because he was afraid caesar figured it out. he wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{even though he knew about you?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{he was in love with you, right?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{that's what he told himself. but it wasn't even about me, it was about caesar. he wanted what caesar had. that's how they are. i understand them.}
<A>__{she glances around the room; a man at the bar smiles at her.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{for shelly, taking the money was a way to take from caesar. he could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{sounds like he wanted to get caught.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{maybe he did. he would brag to me all the time. he was never afraid of caesar because he didn't know him. not like i do.}
<A>__{two men sit down near them, laughing.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{caesar lives for these moments. he tells me it's just the business, but i know it's more than that. he likes it. the violence. i will catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars. he says they remind him who he his. they're all like that. except maybe mickey.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{mickey?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{he's the part of the business that the rest of them pretend to be. |but mickey doesn't like it like they do. i suppose that's why he's good at it.}
<A>__{violet stares at her glass, at the melting ice.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i used to be able to block it out. i would tell myself that i wasn't really there so nothing really mattered. but i can't do it anymore.}
<A>__{she downs the last of her drink.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i've been making the same mistake shelly made. but now i know what |i want.}
<A>__{she turns to corky.}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{i want out. i want a new life. i see what i've been waiting for, but i need you, corky.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{you made a choice once. do you think you would make that same choice again?}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{what choice?}
<C>__{violet}
<D>__{if those quarters fell to the floor, would you still reach up to that cash register?}
<A>__{corky stares at her, knowing where this is going. she glances around the crowded bar.}
<C>__{corky}
<D>__{not here.}
