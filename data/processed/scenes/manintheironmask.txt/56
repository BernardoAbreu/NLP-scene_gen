<A>__{a carriage pulls into a country estate, isolated among vast woodlands silver in the moonlight. mysterious servants with shielded lanterns converge on the carriage as it stops.}

<A>__{athos reaches for his sword, but aramis stops his hand.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{jesuits.}
<L>__{exterior manor house courtyard night}
<A>__{aramis emerges quickly, whispering directives to the jesuits; athos helps the man in the iron mask from the carriage, his head shrouded by a cloak. aramis has a blacksmith waiting; almost before he realizes it the man in the iron mask finds his head placed on an anvil; but as the hammer rises he begins to scream.}
<C>__{man in the iron mask}
<D>__{no! please!}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{what is wrong? we only mean to free you from the mask!}
<A>__{but the prisoner is shaking, and athos understands why.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{prison was horrible but it was his home. he's been torn from it by strangers. he's frightened, exhausted and the mask is familiar. let him rest in it tonight, and remove it tomorrow.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{excellent, athos. you have a keen sense of this man.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{his plight is obvious, isn't it?}
<A>__{athos, angry with aramis' arrogance and insensitivity, leads the man in the iron mask toward the house; then aramis spots porthos, looking downcast.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{and why are you so glum?}
<C>__{porthos}
<D>__{i expected action. there was no killing, no fighting, i was useless.}
<A>__{in deep depression, porthos climbs out and shuffles off. aramis sighs, shakes his head, and walks to the house.}
