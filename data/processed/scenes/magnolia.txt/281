<D>__{i'm not gonna write you up or anything, i'm not gonna give you a citation here but the real problem we have is that there are people around here, people that work from their homes, people tryin' to get some work done, and if you're listenin' to your music that loud: they're incovenienced by that. if you had a job you'd probably understand, but i see you like listenin' to your music and that's fine, you're just gonna wanna keep it down at a certain volume, maybe memorize what number you see on the dial and just always put it to that if it's the middle of the day that's what i do just put it on two and a half and that's a good listening level, alright? i see you like listenin' to your music loud, but, hey, forget about the neighbors, you end up damaging your own ears ok?}
