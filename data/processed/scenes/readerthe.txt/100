<L>__{exterior student digs. night}
<A>__{michael, his arms on the balcony, is smoking, looking out into the night. his eye lands on a student room in which a couple are making love.}
<L>__{interior lecture room. heidelberg law school. day}
<A>__{the small student group is now rattling around informally in the big lecture room.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{i need to correct an impression. dieter said yesterday this was about justice. but is it?}
<C>__{rohl }
<D>__{if it were about justice you might ask why has it taken so long? the war ended twenty years ago. remember, there've been no significant trials between nuremburg in 1946 and the auschwitz trials a couple of years ago. that's a long gap. what's the reason for the gap?}
<A>__{rohl waits a moment for a student to answer.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{i'd have thought it was obvious.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{say.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{cowardice. it's cowardice, isn't it? it's bad conscience. it's the big cover up.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{after the war. the german people didn't want to look at what they'd done.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{is that right?}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{because they had too much to hide. all our parents are liars. all right, mine are. so it's left to us, isn't it?}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{how so?}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{because we're not implicated.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{aren't you? good. so that's all right then.}
<A>__{everyone laughs.}
<C>__{marthe}
<D>__{no, but seriously, dieter's right. my parents, i can't even talk to them. i don't love them. how could i? how could anyone love them? because they've told themselves so many lies, they can't remember the truth, let alone admit it. isn't that why we signed up for this seminar?}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{i don't know. you tell me.}
<C>__{marthe}
<D>__{speaking for myself.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{michael?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i'm not sure any more.}
<A>__{rohl is staring at him thoughtfully.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{what did your father do, dieter?}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{if you want to know, he was in the waffen ss.}
<A>__{there are some smiles, but dieter rides over the reaction.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{that's what i mean, that's what i'm saying. so were a million other germans.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{that's exactly my pointerior that's why it's better not to pretend this is about justice. forgive me, nor is it about getting into an emotional state. it has no purpose if it's just the young giving their parents a bad time.}
<A>__{there's a silence. that's clearly why some of them are there.}
<C>__{marthe}
<D>__{so what is it about? what do you think?}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{societies think they operate by something called morality. but they don't. they operate by something called law. you're not guilty of anything merely by working at auschwitz. 8,000 people worked at auschwitz. precisely 19 have been convicted, and only 6 for murder. to prove murder you have to prove intent. that's the law. remember, the question is never `was it wrong?' but `was it legal?' and not by our laws, no, by the laws at the time.}
<A>__{dieter frowns, unhappy.}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{but isn't that...}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{dieter}
<D>__{narrow?}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{yes. the law is narrow.}
<A>__{rohl looks unapologetic.}
<C>__{rohl}
<D>__{on the other hand, i suspect people who kill other people tend to be aware that it's wrong.}
