<A>__{random, pointless music is playing over the pa system as people are being herded by soldiers onto a ferry boat. a blood bank woman says over a megaphone...}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{unless you are o positive and rh negative, thank you but we already have more blood}
<P>__{than we can use. again... (repeats message)}
<A>__{shots of the herded people boarding the ferry. solders are heard and seen saying "this way" and "keep it moving folks".}
<C>__{harbor master}
<D>__{please move forward calmly, the boat can make more than one trip. please move forward calmly, take your time,}
<P>__{don't rush. (repeats)}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{ray! ray?!?!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{sheryl?}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{ray and sheryl hug as they are re united.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{oh, my gosh, are these your kids?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yes, this is rachel.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{hi, i'm sheryl, this is my daughter, nora.}
<A>__{ray, sheryl, nora, and rachel exchange handshakes.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{hi, i've heard about you, nora.}
<A>__{rachel looks at sea gulls that are flying rather fast away from the boat. robbie meets sheryl with ray.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{this is my son, robbie.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{hi sheryl.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{he's just like dad.}
<A>__{rachel continues watching the gulls.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{how you doing? you look like shit.}
<A>__{rachel is now fully into watching the gulls. ray, sheryl, and robbie are engaged into small talk. rachel sees the gulls flying around something over the horizon behind the city.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(to herself) the trees are funny.}
<C>__{harbor master}
<D>__{we're gonna move some cars out of the way to make more space. give us a few minutes.}
<A>__{rachel watches the trees begin to be flattened and moved as something gets brighter on the horizon. rachel grabs ray's finger and he realizes that she wants him. ray turns around to see what rachel wants as he too sees the thing on the horizon. robbie sees ray looking that way, so he too looks that way. a robot puts it's last foot down with a thud and looks at the dock full of people. it makes the vibration noise which gets the attention of everybody. the crowd begins overrunning the soldiers and cramming onto the ship for safety. the captain sees the overflow and prepares the ship for takeoff to try to stop the overflow.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{cast off!!! get that ramp up!!!}
<C>__{harbor master}
<D>__{cast off now!!! get that ramp up!!!}
<P>__{(to soldiers) no more people! no more}
<D>__{people! we're taking the ramp up.}
<A>__{the soldiers create a blockade which holds back the crowd for quite a while. as the crowd starts to collect, the soldiers start to bulge forward from people pushing them. three robots now switch on their lights to look over the crowd of people. a moving crowd of about 1,000 people is now collecting on the soldiers who so far are withstanding. ray, now in the front next to a soldier, tries to get them to let him and his family through. they say there is no more room.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(to sheryl) you just stay with me! grab}
<D>__{my jacket!}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{i got you ferrier. (trips) oh, jesus!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you okay? come on!}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{jesus. oh my god!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{the harbor master hit's the switch to start the ramp motor to begin folding up the ramp. soldiers shove empty cars off the ramp. sheryl is knocked around by a few people and looses grip of ray's jacket.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{oh, ray!! ray!!!}
<A>__{they run faster and sheryl falls farther behind. robbie makes a grab for her hand but a soldier stops sheryl just short.}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{no, i can go with him!!! ray!!!! no!!!!}
<A>__{the ramp begins lifting as a few people make one last jump and latch on to it. ray looks back for sheryl.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{sheryl?!?!? sheryl!!!!}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{ray!!!!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{there's room on the boat!!!}
<C>__{sheryl}
<D>__{let us through god damn it!!!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{there's still room on the boat!!! there's room on the boat!!! there's room on the boat!!!}
<A>__{rachel screams as ray runs to the bow with rachel in his arms. robbie is soon to follow...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{robbie?!?!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{stay with me! stay with me robbie!!!}
<A>__{robbie runs right past them and up to the captain's deck.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{robbie!!!}
<A>__{robbie, panting hard, looks at the inclining ramp and sees there are still people hanging on to the back side of the ramp. he starts running to the stern of the ship. the captain pushes the throttle all the way full. the propellers start so fast they spray water all over the people still at the dock. pulling away at it's ties to the dock, the ship begins pulling away.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(seeing robbie running to the stern)}
<D>__{robbie? robbie!?!?!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{robbie!!!}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{robbie!!!}
<A>__{robbie ignores them as he jumps onto the grate of the folded up ramp. climbing to the top, he begins helping those who are hanging on the back side of the ramp.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{here, grab my hand!! hold on! i got you! hold on!!!}
<A>__{camera turns or ray's face. ray looks at robbie helping people in admiration and proud ness.}
<C>__{robbie}
