<L>__{interior astar helicopter day}
<A>__{the configuration of seats has drew beside parrish, in front of them quince and susan opposite each other in single seats. just as drew removes color coded folders from his attache case and spreads them out for parrish on his tray table, the pilot waves to drew, indicating 'phone call'. drew gets up and heads for the cockpit, parrish scans the folders, glances over at susan who is making some notes on a file of her own. he motions to her to please come sit beside him, she checks that drew is still busy in the cockpit, tucks her papers into her carryall, and crosses over to parrish who folds away the work that drew set before him into his tray table, locks it.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i thought you were in a meeting ?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i am. with you.}
<A>__{he peers up ahead at drew, on the telephone and gesticulat ing intensely, right at home in the cockpit despite the chop of the blades and the pilot pressed up against him.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{do you love drew?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{...there's a start for a meeting.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i know it's none of my business }
<A>__{susan doesn't answer for a moment, then impulsively kisses her father on the cheek.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{no, it's none of your business.}
<A>__{another moment.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{do you love drew?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you mean like you loved mom?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{forget about me and mom are you going to marry him?}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{probably.}
<A>__{a moment.}
<C>__{parrish}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{don't get carried away.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{uh oh }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{susan, you're a hell of a woman. you've got a great career, you're beautiful }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{and i'm your daughter and no man will ever be good enough for me.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{well, i wasn't going to say that }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{what were you going to say?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{listen, i'm crazy about the guy he's smart, he's aggressive, he could carry parrish communications into the 21st century and me along with it.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{so what's wrong with that?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{that's for me. i'm talking about you. it's not so much what you say about drew, it's what you don't say.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you're not listening }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{oh yes, i am. not an ounce of excitement, not a whisper of a thrill, this relationship has all the passion of a pair of titmice.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{don't get dirty, dad }
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{well, it worries me. i want you to get swept away. i want you to levitate. i want you to sing with rapture and dance like a dervish.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{that's all?}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{be deliriously happy. or at least leave yourself open to be.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{'be deliriously happy'. i'm going to do my upmost }
<A>__{he smiles.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i know it's a cornball thing but love is passion, obsession, someone you can't live without. if you don't start with that, what are you going to end up with? i say fall head over heels. find someone you can love like crazy and who'll love you the same way back. and how do you find him? forget your head and listen to your heart. i'm not hearing any heart.}
<P>__{(a moment)}
<D>__{run the risk, if you get hurt, you'll come back. because, the truth is there is no sense living your life without this. to make the journey and not fall deeply in love well, you haven't lived a life at all. you have to try. because if you haven't tried, you haven't lived.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{bravo.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{aw, you're tough.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i'm sorry. but give it to me again. the short version.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{stay open. who knows? lightning could strike.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{parrish }
<D>__{forgive the lecture }
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{i won't. and when i tell drew about it, he won't either.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{you won't tell him, and even if you did, he'd clock it and punch it into his laptop in order to pull out some key phrases when he gives the commencement speech at wharton.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you're terrible.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{i know. but i'm the only father you've got.}
<A>__{she kisses him on the cheek.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{thank god.}
<C>__{parrish}
<D>__{he doesn't care. but thanks anyway.}
