<L>__{exterior church later}
<A>__{a squad pulls up. dolly, duffy and greenly turn.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{game time. how are we playing this?}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{feds love to pull the divide and conquer routine. we hard line her. stick together on this. agreed?}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{agreed. we're a brick wall.}
<A>__{they all nod and stiffen their resolve.}
<C>__{greenly}
<D>__{let's rock this bitch.}
<A>__{rockin' music fades in as a uniform opens the squad door. slo mo: eunice bloom (32yrs) exits the squad and moves toward. she is simply delicious: sexy, blonde hair, a woman's business suit, short skirt, brass rimmed specs. each detective's face drops. soon she is before them. music cuts. she smiles and speaks with a southern drawl a la doc holiday.}
<C>__{eunice}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{you hafta be detectives dolly and duffy. am i right?}
<P>__{(extending hand)}
<D>__{eunice bloom. a pleasure.}
<A>__{dolly and duffy shake and manage a nod. greenly is still enamored.}
<C>__{eunice }
<D>__{and you must be greenly. smecker always said you were the funny one.}
<C>__{greenly}
<D>__{t'sup...i mean, what? yeah, well, funny as in ha ha, though not like funny as in gay cuz...i'm not...played high school football.}
<A>__{she chuckles. dolly and duffy fume.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{look, with all due respect, agent bloom...}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{special.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{you see there's a "special" before my "agent." if we are going to address each other formally, i'd prefer if you popped it in there. makes me feel, i don't know...special. of course, i'd hoped we could be a little more personable. in fact, i'd like you to call me eunice.}
<A>__{the cops are dumbfounded. duffy snaps out of it.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{o'kay, eunice. i don't see why the fuck the fed is...}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{whoa, whoa, "fuck?" this isn't a "fuck" situation, is it? i can see a "god damn" or two but why skip all the way to "fuck" right off the bat? let's start slow and work our way up to it.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{what is the fed's interest in this?}
<A>__{the detectives harden, brick wall. eunice furrows her brow.}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{their interest, detective, is capturing the men responsible for the murders of 22 of boston's finest criminals. y'see public perception is that these boys stepped in, did our jobs for us and then disappeared into thin air as we fecklessly searched for them. the fbi tends to take exception to such things. they coulda sent anyone. they sent me. why do you think that is?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{well, since we've broken the "fuck barrier," allow me to be blunt.}
<C>__{eunice }
<D>__{it is because i am so fucking smart that i make smart people feel like retards. now, we seem to be getting off on the wrong foot here. i'd appreciate a bit of cooperation. let's chalk it up to paying respect to the memory of a dearly departed mutual friend. a man who taught me everything i know.}
<A>__{after a moment of consideration, the cops concede with nods.}
<C>__{eunice }
<D>__{lovely.}
<P>__{(re: crowd)}
<D>__{now what's with the circus?}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{the victim was killed late last night. when people gathered for morning mass, they found the front entrance chained and padlocked. a locksmith came out, cut the chain and surprise, surprise. cell phones. half of them called the cops. half of them called the media. but regardless...word's out.}
<A>__{eunice turns and looks over the crowd.}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{and it looks like that's just the way somebody wanted it. what say we scrape the shit off this cow's ass, fellas? detective greenly? escort a lady onto the crime scene?}
<C>__{greenly}
<D>__{what? no, yeah, no. of course.}
<A>__{greenly escorts her as dolly and duffy walk behind, mystified.}
<C>__{greenly }
<D>__{do you want a cup of coffee or something?}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{never touch the stuff.}
