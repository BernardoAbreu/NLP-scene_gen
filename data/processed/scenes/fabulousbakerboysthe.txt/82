<L>__{interior dining room}
<A>__{dark and soundless. balloons, streamers and the other debris of revelry cover the tables and floor like snow. frank is sitting at the window, drinking as he stares at the ocean. as jack crosses the room, he looks up.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{ah, well, if it isn't the lad with the golden ear. happy new year, little brother.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what're you doing down here?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{celebrating. join me?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{the party's over.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no, you're wrong. it's just beginning. come on, have a drink. show your big brother how it's done.}
<A>__{frank pours him a glass. jack notices the bottle.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{expensive hangover.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{a gift. courtesy of our courteous hotel manager, mr. daniels.}
<P>__{(toasting jack)}
<D>__{we, dear brother, are a fucking smash.}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{yup. they want us back. easter. it seems they have this egg hunt every year. only not for kids. adults. they stuff these plastic eggs with timexes and little certificates for free mai tais and everyone has a grand time crawling around on the front lawn. then afterwards, they have a dance. an egg dance. everyone comes dressed in a different colored shell and at the end of the evening they crack themselves open. it's our job to separate the yolks from the whites. slippery business.}
<A>__{frank smiles as he takes a swallow of his drink, then leans his head back, staring at the ceiling.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you know, i've never kissed my wife on new year's. not once in twelve years.}
<A>__{jack studies frank as he stares at the ceiling.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{the holmby has a chandelier like that doesn't it? with the blue glass.}
<A>__{jack looks up at the chandelier.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{the royal.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{right. the royal. when's the last time we were there?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{couple years.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{february?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{april.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{right. it's incredible how you do that. remember things.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{a useless talent.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{drove me crazy when we were kids. the way you never looked at the music. miss simpson would just play it and ...}
<A>__{frank snaps his fingers.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{they were simple songs.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{not for me. i still have to look at the music sometimes, you know that? otherwise, i forget. i just forget. but you. you never forget. ever.}
<P>__{(turning)}
<D>__{so how come you couldn't remember ma's birthday?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i told you. it's a useless talent.}
<A>__{frank studies jack a moment, then stares out at the ocean.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{god, the old man would've loved this view, wouldn't he?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i always think of him on new year's. how he used to pour us each half a can of beer. remember?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you always threw up.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah, and you drank yours like it was orange juice. he loved that about you.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{he was just having fun.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it was like you'd passed some test, you know?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it was just a can of beer, frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{yeah, but he told you things. he never told me anything. even though i was the oldest. it was always you two, running off, doing things together.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you could've come.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i could've. but he didn't want me to.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you're making things up, frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{maybe so.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{you ever go back there? where it happened.}
<A>__{jack stares at the angry sea, loud even through the thick glass.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no.}
