<L>__{ext: el macho's house later}
<A>__{gru makes his way up the road leading to el macho's house. he is wearing handcuffs, and being led at spear point by dave and stuart, who have been painted purple to look like evil minions. but they are goofing around and giggling. and they still have a few yellow spots.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{hey, guys. come on! stay focused here!}
<A>__{the minions somber up.}
<C>__{minions}
<D>__{okay, okay.}
<A>__{gru covers a smeared yellow spot with purple painterior they approach the front gate, which is closed. dave boosts himself onto a stray box and speaks gibberish into the intercom. he hears evil minion gibberish in response. he responds back in evil minion gibberish. the intercom buzzes and the gate begins to open. the gate opens and there are dozens of purple minions milling about. they eye gru and his captors suspiciously. dave and stuart poke gru with a spear.}
<C>__{gru}
<P>__{(attempting to act)}
<D>__{curses. foiled again. these guys captured me.}
<A>__{the evil minions cheer at seeing this. gru, dave and stuart have to walk all the way to the house surrounded on all sides by evil purple minions. the painted yellow minions are very nervous. the purple minions eye them as they pass. they growl and the yellow minions attempt to growl back. it's extremely intense, but it looks like they're going to make it. then one of the evil minions makes a slobbery raspberry at one of the painted ones. they get into a raspberry fight until the painted minion is grossed out and tries to rub the slobber off him. it rubs off the purple painterior one of the evil purple minions points and screams. they're exposed! all of the purple minions run towards gru, dave and stuart. teeth bared. ready to chomp.}
<C>__{gru }
<D>__{run!}
<A>__{they take off running.}
