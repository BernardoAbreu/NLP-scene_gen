<A>__{a soldierly man of about forty (colonel brandon) is dismounting from his horse. from within we hear marianne's song begin. his head snaps up to the windows. an expression of pained surprise comes into his melancholy, brooding eyes.}
<L>__{interior barton park music room eve}
<A>__{everyone watches marianne as she plays and sings. behind them we see brandon entering. but he stays in the shadow of the door and no one notices him. close on his face. he gazes at marianne with an unfathomable look of grief and longing. he breathes in deeply. suddenly, elinor feels his presence and looks around at him. after a few moments, she turns back, slightly puzzled. the song finishes. everyone claps. the man ventures out into the light and sir john springs from his seat.}
