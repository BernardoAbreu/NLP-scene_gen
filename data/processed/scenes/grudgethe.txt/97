<L>__{interior the house front room day}
<A>__{the room is a mess. the bed is unmade, clothes are strewn on the floor. looks like a storm swept through it. yoko stands in the doorway, listening for the thumping sounds. but they've stopped. she finishes her call and hangs up. sighs. she sticks the cordless phone into her pocket and starts to clean the room. as yoko straightens the bedspread, she hears something. pauses. and we hear it too a familiar throaty croaking sound. quiet and muffled. yoko, a bit unnerved by the strange sound, pulls a small mp3 player and headphones from her pocket. she puts them on, and goes back to work.}
