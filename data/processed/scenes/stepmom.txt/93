<L>__{exterior jackie's yard day}
<A>__{rachel alone by the weathered redwood swing and slide set. she is pacing in a circle, looking like a kid waiting to see the principal. sucking her cigarette like smoke was oxygen. she picks a bottle of beer off the grass. twists the top. settles awkwardly on the seat of the taller swing. hear the screen door open. bang shut. rachel takes a sip. before she looks up...}
<C>__{jackie}
<P>__{(low, calm)}
<D>__{now we're going to have a fight, you and i.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(barely audible)}
<D>__{are we.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{and i'm going to win.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(straight to her eyes)}
<D>__{don't be too sure.}
<A>__{no anger in jackie at this moment. the ferocity of that mother lion. the strongest face we'll ever see.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{now, 'limp dick', i know. what. is 'snowballing'?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{it doesn't matter, i didn't tell h...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{because there'll be, oh, 20 or 30 mothers phoning me in the next hour or so. and they'll b...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{give 'em my number.}
<A>__{jackie on the prowl around this swing. stalking her prey.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{actually. they'll want annabelle's mother.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{is that what you're worried about? looking bad at the pta?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you are defending what you did?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{right down to the ground. let's get to it.}
<A>__{not quite what jackie expected.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you put filth in my child's mouth.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{aw.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you had her lie about that... that fancy boy model !}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{worked. like a charm.}
<A>__{jackie cannot even believe this.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{she was beaten, and bloodied, and it was going to go on, uni...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{so you became the hero. and i became the schmuck.}
<A>__{straightening her spine...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you taught my child that i am some limp dick loser . who didn't care about her pain.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{that's not wh...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you think i didn't have some dirty words for that little putz? you think i couldn't figure out some low blows?}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you weren't passing 'em out.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{well, maybe your version of growing up is 'just win, baby'.}
<A>__{stalking. closer. fierce.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{mine. is a little different.}
<A>__{right there. at the swing. in her face.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{see, in that crisis, i saw an opportunity. for some real growth.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{oh please.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{shut the fuck up. i didn't go behind your back.}
<A>__{the one scored. rachel sips her beer.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{doing the right thing. knowing who you are , inside. not caving to peer pressure, or lowering yourself to that level, steering your own course...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{she wasn't steering her own course, she was steering yours .}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{well, that's what parenting is about , little girl. they are pleading to know how they are supposed to do it. and you sure as hell showed her.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{and there will come another moment. when the stakes are really there. and she will look back on this. and remember how good it felt. how easy it was.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{and she'll fight back again. god help me, what have i done.}
<A>__{jackie's voice drops. the softness makes it somehow more menacing...}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you've turned her into you. and i may not get another chance. to turn her back.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(suddenly fierce)}
<D>__{that's what it is. and that's all it is.}
<A>__{the hand with its cigarette stabs out...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{you won't get the chance.}
<A>__{jackie back on her heels. thinking. a mile a minute.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you've got a point there, for a change. oh, yes you do.}
<A>__{her finger stabbing out.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you didn't get morning sickness for seven months, you didn't breast feed till your nipples fell off, you didn't spend every minute of every day thinking and planning and knowing that your decisions were shaping the people they were going to be...}
<A>__{and now rachel. has nothing to say.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you are gonna be taking ben's training wheels off. you are the one my little girl will confess her first love to. you will see them married , you will play with their babies , you fucking bitch, i hate your guts!}
<A>__{the blast washes over rachel. and in the silence...}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{now you're talking sense.}
<A>__{she looks down at her beer.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{all year long, i've been watching how you do this. the worries, the sacri fices, the signals you give them...}
<A>__{thinks. really thinks. wants so much to say this right.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{and i admire you. more than you'll ever believe. and yet...this... thing...has been growing. inside me.}
<A>__{looks up. straight to her eyes.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{for better or worse. i'm not you.}
<A>__{and so she stands up. the swing shimmies in her wake.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{i can't live my life channeling the one true mom after you're gone. i can't do it. i can't do it. i can't. do it.}
<A>__{sets the beer down. stabs out her smoke.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{we have to deal with that.}
<A>__{and walks off, slowly. across the yard.}
