<A>__{her wail of fear freezes archer. he looks back and sees adam in the eye of the firestorm. archer's face betrays his conflict. a child but his worst enemy's child. bullets shred the wall around adam. getting closer. archer moves he crawls toward adam. just then a swat agent rappels in through one of the shattered windows, his weapon poised. archer kicks him hard, pitching him back through the window. archer grabs adam curling him into his body. thinking fast, he soaks his discarded t shirt into a toppled flower vase then places it over adam's face. protecting him. he rushes to sasha. together, they barrel through the soft, paper wall and tear out an escape route.}
