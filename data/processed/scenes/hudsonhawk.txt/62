<L>__{interior anna's house night}
<A>__{the viewer's viewpoint pulls back, past the black canvas bag on a table, to reveal a barefoot anna is straddling a bare backed hawk, demurely and tentatively studying his bruises.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what have you been doing?}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{uh....old badminton injury.}
<A>__{anna giggles and bends to kiss a bruise. she stops herself and opts for tickling.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{tickles, tickles, tickles.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(not stopping)}
<D>__{oh, i'm so sorry...}
<A>__{roaring with laughter, they capsize onto the floor. hawk slithers around to devour her toes. anna closes her eyes and arches her back..... she opens her eyes and sees a large crucifix staring right at her. with a gasp, she rolls away from hawk and stands up, trying to brush off her sins.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i can't. i....}
<C>__{hawk}
<P>__{(softly approaching)}
<D>__{hey now, outside of a very friendly dog this morning, it's been a slow decade. i don't make love every ten years, i get a little cranky.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{it's also been a long time for me. i }
<A>__{their heads fuse for a semi classic screen kiss until}
<B>__{the crucifix lights up and begins shouting in italian.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{catholic girls are scary...}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{somebody robbed the vatican.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{oh. no.}
<A>__{anna slides on her shoes and makes a hasty retreat. she bumps into the canvas bag. the codex slides out. they both catch it in mid air. anna's eyes pop. she wrenches the codex away and kicks. hawk pulls her into a compassionate back against his stomach hug. the codex falls to the floor unharmed.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{it's not what you think. okay, maybe it is....}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{you really went and did it. with one day, not even a day, of planning, you did it. nobody does it better, hudson. you started the week stealing the sforza and you ended it swiping the codex.}
<C>__{hawk}
<D>__{wha }
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what are your plans for the weekend? hoisting away the colosseum? tell me, did the devil make you do it or did darwin and minerva mayflower?}
