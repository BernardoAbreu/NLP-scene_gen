<T>__{fade to black:}
<L>__{exterior forest lawn cemetery. day.}
<T>__{burn on:}
<B>__{the fourth day}
<T>__{fade up on :}
<A>__{a stark afternoon. on a hill of sere grass overlooking the valley, the casket of rod lane is lowered into its grave. a small group of family and friends watches soberly as the minister raises his hand in benediction.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{ashes to ashes, dust to dust. may god be with this young man's soul.}
<A>__{on the faces of marge, lt thompson, tina's mother and rod's parents. just for a second or two, in looks too rapid for an outsider to even notice, these adults exchange looks . furtive, quick glances that suggest an immense something that they all share, something beyond even this second death among their children. then they are all staring ahead again, as if the others weren't even there.}
<C>__{minister }
<D>__{his life and his death attest to the scripture's warning that he who lives by the sword shall die by the sword.}
<A>__{angle on glen, watching nancy, standing alone, not believing it for a minute.}
<C>__{minister }
<D>__{but let us recall also our lord's admonition that we 'judge not, lest we be judged.' let us attempt only to love. and may rod lane rest in peace.}
<C>__{nancy}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{amen to that much.}
<A>__{the mourners walk away from the grave, marge among them. she pauses near a man and two women in black tina's mother, rod's parents. they almost, it seems, speak. then marge hurries on. we move with her as she's joined by lt thompson. both are worn and on edge. thompson absently lights another cigarette, offering one to marge.}
<C>__{lt thompson}
<D>__{how's nancy doing?}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{i don't think she's slept since tina died.}
<P>__{(shakes her head)}
<D>__{she's always been a delicate kid.}
<A>__{thompson lights her cigarette, attempting some sort of nonchalance.}
<C>__{lt thompson}
<D>__{she's tougher than you think. any idea how she knew rod was gonna kill himself?}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{no. all i know is, this reminds me too much of ten years ago.}
<A>__{thompson blows a plume of smoke against the hard sky and looks away.}
<C>__{lt thompson}
<D>__{yeah. well... let's not start digging up bodies just because we're in a cemetery.}
<A>__{he gives her a look that could cut stone. marge toses down her cigarete and crosses to nancy. the girl is simply staring off over the valley.}
<C>__{marge}
<P>__{(very gently)}
<D>__{time to go home, baby.}
<A>__{she moves her away from the brink of the hill.}
