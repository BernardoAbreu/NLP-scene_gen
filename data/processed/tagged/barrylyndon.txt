<D>__{whose horse, fellow, is that?}

<A>__{roderick leaps at captain best, and collars him, while dorothy makes the air echo with her screams. captain grogan and mysie hasten up. though roderick is a full growth of six feet, he is small by the side of the enormous english captain. best turns very red at the attack upon him, and slips back clutching at his sword. dorothy, in an agony of terror, flings herself round him, screaming:}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{captain best, for heaven's sake, spare the child he is but an infant.}
<C>__{captain best}
<D>__{and ought to be whipped for his impudence, but never fear, miss dugan, i shall not touch him, your favorite is safe from me.}

<C>__{captain best}

<C>__{captain grogan}
<D>__{you are a gallant lad, and i like your spirit. but what dugan says is true. it's a hard thing to give a lad counsel who is in such a far gone state as you; but, believe me, i know the world, and if you will but follow my advice, you won't regret having taken it. dorothy dugan has not a penny; you are not a whit richer. and, my poor boy, don't you see though it's a hard matter to see that she's a flirt, and does not care a pin for you or best either?}

<D>__{faith, i think you are a lad that's likely to keep your word.}
<A>__{he looks hard at roderick for a second to two, then he walks away, humming a tune, looking back at roderick as he goes through the old gate out of the garden. when grogan is gone, roderick is quite alone, and he flings himself down on the bench where dorothy had made believe to faint, and had left her handkerchief and the ribbons and, taking them up, hides his face in them, and bursts into a passion of tears.}
<C>__{roderick }

<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{i will match any man with the sword.}
<C>__{captain grogan}

<C>__{captain grogan}
<D>__{look here, roderick, my boy; this is silly business. the girl will marry best, mark my words; and as sure as she does, you'll forget her. you are but a boy. best is willing to consider you as such. dublin's a fine place, and if you have a mind to take a ride thither and see the town for a month, here are twenty guineas at your service. make best an apology, and be off.}

<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{it was dorothy did it.}
<A>__{roderick takes the ribbons she gave him out of his waistcoat, and the letter, and flings them down on the body of captain best.}

<C>__{mrs. o'reilly}

<D>__{perhaps had i been a little older in the world's experience, i should have begun to see that madame o'reilly was not the person of fashion she pretended to be; but, as it was, i took all her stories for truth, and, when the landlord brought the bill for dinner, paid it with the air of a lord. indeed, she made no motion to produce the two pieces i had lent her.}

<D>__{your loyalty to me and your service to the regiment has pleased me very well and now there is another occasion on which you may make yourself useful to us; if you succeed, depend on it, your reward will be your discharge from the army, and a bounty of 100 guineas.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{what is the service, sir?}
<C>__{captain galgenstein}
<D>__{there is lately come to berlin a gentleman in the service of the empress queen, who calls himself the chevalier de belle fast, and wears the red riband and star of the pope's order of the spur. he is made for good society, polished, obliging, a libertine, without prejudices, fond of women, of good food, of high play, prudent and discreet.}
<A>__{the captain smiles at roderick.}
<C>__{captain galgenstein}
<D>__{he speaks italian and french indifferently; but we have some reason to fancy this monsieur de belle fast is a native of your country of ireland, and that he has come here as a spy.}
<A>__{the captain rises and begins to pace back and forth.}
<C>__{captain galgenstein}
<D>__{naturally, your knowledge of english makes you an ideal choice to go into his service. of course, you will not know a word of english; and if the chevalier asks as to the particularity of your accent, say you are hungarian. the servant who came with him will be turned away today, and the person to whom he has applied for a faithful fellow will recommend you.}
<A>__{roderick nods.}
<C>__{captain galgenstein}
<D>__{you are a hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins. he gambles a great deal, and wins. do you know the cards well?}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{only a very little, as soldiers do.}
<C>__{captain galgenstein}
<D>__{i had thought you more expert. you must find out if the chevalier cheats. he sees the english and austrian envoys continually, and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house. find out what they talk of, for how much each plays, especially if any of them play on parole. if you are able to, read his private letters, though about those which go to the post, you need not trouble yourself we look at them there. but never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes, and by what channel or messenger. he sleeps with the keys of his dispatch box with a string around his neck twenty frederics, if you get an impression of the keys.}

<D>__{he goes to church regularly he is very religious, and after hearing mass comes home to breakfast. then he takes an airing in his chariot till dinner, which is served at noon. after dinner, he writes his letters, if he has any letters to write; but he has very little to do in this way. his letters are to the austrian envoy, with whom he corresponds, but who does not acknowledge him; and being written in english, or course, i look over his shoulder. he generally writes for money. he makes his party with calsabigi, the lottery contractor, the russian attaches, two from the english embassy, my lords deuceace and punter, who play a jeu d'enfer, and a few more. he wins often, but not always. lord deuceace is a very fine player. the chevalier elliott, the english minister, sometimes comes, on which occasion the secretaries do not play.}

<A>__{several cuts of playing and cheating to illustrate voice over.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{simplicity was our secret. everything successful is simple. if, for instance, i wiped the dust off a chair with my napkin, it was to show that the enemy was strong in diamonds; if i pushed it, he had an ace, king; if i said, "punch or wine, my lord?" hearts was meant. if "wine or punch?" clubs. if i blew my nose, it was to indicate that there was another confederate employed by the adversary; and then, i warrant you, some pretty trials of skill would take place. the prince of turbingen, although so young, had a very great skill and cleverness with the cards in every way; and it was only from hearing ritter von brandenburg, who came with him, yawn three times when the chevalier had the ace of trumps, that i knew we were greek to greek, as it were.}

<A>__{roderick and the chevalier are sound asleep in their carriage when they are awakened by a violent jolt, upon which the carriage overturns in the middle of the road. the chevalier is underneath, and screams from the pain in his right arm, which he thinks is broken. their servant forces the door open to help them out, telling them that the two postilions have fled. roderick easily gets out of the carriage through the door, which is above him, but the chevalier, unable to move because of his disabled arm, has to be pulled out. his piercing shrieks make roderick laugh, because of the strange oaths with which he interlards his prayers. from the carriage, roderick takes his dueling pistols, and sword. roderick tells his servant to mount and to looking for armed peasants in the vicinity; money in hand, he leaves. the chevalier has lain down on the hard ground, groaning and in no condition to resist robbers. roderick makes his own preparations to sell his fortune and his life at the highest price. his carriage is close to the ditch, and he unhitches the horses, tieing them to the wheels and the pole in a circle, and stations himself behind them with weapons. in this predicament, roderick cannot help laughing at the poor chevalier, who is writhing like a dying dolphin on a seashore, and uttering the most pitiful execrations, when a mare, whose back was turned to him, take it into her empty head to empty her bladder on him. there is nothing to be done; he has to put up with the whole stinking rain, and to forgive roderick's laughter, which he has not the strength to hold in. the chill wind and the silence are suddenly broken by an attack, which is half hearted and uncertain, by the lady's lover, and his hesitant band of six cut throats. some falter and run away as soon as roderick fires his pistol. the leader and two heartier followers engage roderick. during the fight, they mortally wound the helpless chevalier and two of them are killed. after they flee, roderick kneels by the chevalier, who utters some appropriate last words, then dies. his servant finally arrives at full gallop, shouting at the top of his voice, and followed by a band of peasants, each with his lantern, come to his rescue. there are ten or twelve of them, all armed with muskets, and all ready to obey his orders.}

<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{it is nonetheless a misfortune, and you will know it when you love.}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{but if, when i love, i am unhappy, i will know that my empty heart was my good fortune.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{that is true, but it seems to me impossible that you should be unhappy in love.}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{it is only too possible. love requires a mutual harmony which is difficult, and it is even more difficult to make it last.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{i agree; but god put us on earth to take that risk.}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{a man may need to do that, and find it amusing; but a girl is bound by other laws.}

<D>__{deceiving someone without knowing it is something new for me. if i do not know it, i am innocent.}
<C>__{countess}

<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{then i will respectfully take leave of her.}

<D>__{i know better than you do. love wants a more substantial fare, and if it is stubbornly withheld, it withers away.}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{our abstinence makes our love immortal. if i loved you a quarter of an hour ago, now i should love you even more. but i should love you less if you exhausted my joy by satisfying all my desires.}

<L>__{interior mr. tapewell's office day}
<A>__{tapewell is in his musty room, surrounded by his parchments and tin boxes. he advances and bows, begs her ladyship to be seated, and points towards a chair for roderick, which he takes, rather wondering at the lawyer's insolence. the lawyer retreats to a side door, saying he will be back in a moment. in the next moment, he reenters, bringing with him another layer, six constables in red waist coats, with bludgeons and pistols, and lord brookside. lady cosgrove flings herself into the arms of her son, crying and whimpering and calling him her savior, her preserver, her gallant knight. then, turning to roderick, she pours out a flood of invective which quite astonishes him.}
<C>__{countess}
<D>__{oh fool as i am, i have outwitted the most crafty and treacherous monster under the sun. yes, i was a fool when i married you, and gave up other and nobler hearts for your sake yes, i was a fool when i forgot my name and lineage to unite myself with a base born adventurer a fool to bear, without repining, the most monstrous tyranny that ever woman suffered; to allow my property to be squandered; to see women as base and low born as yourself...}
<C>__{tapewell}
<D>__{for heaven's sake, be calm.}
<A>__{tapewell bounds back behind the constables, seeing a threatening look in roderick's eye. the countess continues in a strain of incoherent fury, screaming against roderick, and against his mother, and always beginning and ending the sentence with the word "fool."}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{you didn't tell all, my lady i said "old" fool.}
<C>__{brookside}
<D>__{i have no doubt that you said and did, sir, everything that a blackguard could say or do. this lady is now safe under the protection of her relations and the law, and need fear your infamous persecutions no longer.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{but you are not safe, and as sure as i am a man of honor, i will have your heart's blood.}
<C>__{tapewell}
<D>__{take down his words, constables; swear the peace against him.}
<C>__{brookside}
<D>__{i would not sully my sword with the blood of such a ruffian. if the scoundrel remains in london another day, he will be seized as a common swindler.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{where's the man who will seize me?}
<A>__{he draws his sword, placing his back to the door.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{let the scoundrel come! you you cowardly braggart, come first, if you have the soul of a man!}
<A>__{the countess and the bailiffs move away.}
<C>__{tapewell}
<D>__{we are not going to seize you! my dear sir, we don't wish to seize you; we will give you a handsome sum to leave the country, only leave her ladyship in peace.}
<C>__{brookside}
<D>__{and the country will be rid of such a villain.}
<A>__{as brookside says this, he backs into the next room. the lawyer follows him, leaving roderick alone in the company of the constables who are all armed to the teeth.}
<C>__{roderick }
<D>__{i was no longer the man i was at twenty, when i should have charged the ruffians, sword in hand, and sent at least one of them to his account. i was broken in spirit, regularly caught in the toils, utterly baffled and beaten by that woman. was she relenting at the door, when she paused and begged me to turn back? had she not a lingering love for me still? her conduct showed it, as i came to reflect on it. it was my only chance now left in the world, so i put down my sword upon the lawyers desk.}
<A>__{roderick puts his sword down on the lawyer's desk.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{gentlemen, i shall have no violence; you may tell mr. tapewell i am quite ready to speak with him when he is at leisure.}

<C>__{tapewell}
<D>__{i have been authorized by lady cosgrove and her advisors to pay you an annuity of 300 pounds a year, specifically on the condition of you remaining abroad out of the three kingdoms, and to be stopped on the instant of your return. i advise you to accept it without delay for you know, as well as i do, that your stay in london will infallibly plunge you in gaol, as there are innumerable writs taken out against you here and in the west of england, and that your credit is so blown upon that you could not hope to raise a shilling. i will leave you the night to consider this proposal, but if you refuse, the family will proceed against you in london, and have you arrested. if you accede, a quarter salary will be paid to you at any foreign port you should prefer.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{mr. tapewell, i do not require a night to consider this proposal. what other choice has a poor, lonely and broken hearted man? i shall take the annuity, and leave the country.}
<C>__{mr. tapewell}
<D>__{i am very glad to hear that you have come to this decision, mr. cosgrove. i think you are very wise.}
<A>__{there is a knock at the door and roderick opens it. brookside enters with four constables armed with pistols. the dialogue for this scene has to be written. brookside has gone against the bargain, and has decided to have roderick arrested upon one of the many writs out against him for debt. mr. tapewell is surprised and complains weakly that brookside is acting in bad faith. brookside brushes aside his objections. roderick is defeated, and meekly sits down in a chair. the following lines are read over roderick being shackled and led out of the room.}
