<L>__{139: interior kitchen living room bedroom. house. day.}
<A>__{helena locks the front door. moves into the kitchen. locks the back door. glum silence in the house. nothing but an old alarm clock ticking. then a sound like something moving. like a door creaking open? was it in the garage? the living room? upstairs? she returns to the living room. curtains drawn and almost dark. the endless silence is interrupted by a rush of water in pipes. if anybody's here they're upstairs? helena moves to the bottom of them "john, are you up there? it's me, darling. i got a cab." the only reply is more silence. she begins to climb the stairs. one hand on the wall. she ascends slowly. her helplessness giv ing way to suspicion with each new step. at the top she pushes into the bedroom "john, are you here? darling? are you alright?" apparently no one is here. certainly no one in the bed. and no one in the bathroom. she reappears with an expression suppress ing anxiety. feels her way past an antique wardrobe. curiously its door is open. a full length mirror inside. shuts it as she passes and for a split instant the man in the room is revealed. almost simultaneously fingers in black leather clasp her wrist. helena in speechless with shock. both she and the intruder are breathing hard. the only other sound is the wardrobe door whin ing open again under its weight. manifests a reflection of his back. totally in black. black wool hat. leather jacket. gloves.}
<C>__{intruder}
<D>__{got really fucken lucky, didn't ya?}
<A>__{he backs her to the bed and sits her before releasing his grip. the frame remains static and staring into the mirror and still on the intruder's back. helena stares unseeing at her own face.}
<D>__{i was getting kinda concerned about you jenny. like, how blind are you? blind as your friend? or less blind? coz she could see, you know. had a view outta one of em. but you don't see nothing do you? nothing at all?}
<A>__{he reaches into his jeans and produces a stainless steel knife. even closed this thing is 10 inches long. a leather loop attat ched at one and. he teases the metal in front of helena's eyes.}
<D>__{can you see this, blind girl?}
<A>__{not a switch blade but by snapping it like a whip it locks out.}
<D>__{gimme your hand.}
<A>__{too terrified to obey and her inability momentarily angers him.}
<D>__{gimme your fucken hand.}
<A>__{helena lifts her hand and he takes it. he runs the edge of the blade over her palm. then closes her fingers around the handle.}
<D>__{you like it?}
<A>__{she is paralyzed except for the tears spilling down her cheeks.}
<D>__{i cut your friend's head off with that ..}
<A>__{words come out she can barely hear herself. "you are a coward."}
<D>__{you say something, jenny?}
<A>__{in this terrible silence she hears a double hiss of an aerosol.}
<D>__{i'd like to cut you. i'd like to cut you so bad .. but ain't life strange? you're my little buddy now .. i guess we all got lucky?}
