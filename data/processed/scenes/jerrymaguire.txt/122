<L>__{interior dorothy's porch night}
<A>__{music feathers into sounds of night. a bug buzzing from the nearby light, jerry swats it away.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{well this would be goodnight.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{good night.}
<A>__{they don't kiss. they take great care not to touch too much.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i will see you tomorrow.}
<A>__{they don't move. on impulse, she grabs him and pulls him close. kisses him. it's a good one.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{good night.}
<A>__{but they don't move. he pulls her closer by her straps. they break. she holds them up, nervous now. his lips travel down. he kisses her upper chest. she sighs deeply, she's missed this feeling. jerry rises to kiss her lips again, tying her straps back on. her expression says there is a decision to make. she concentrates on the styrofoam container she's brought back from the restaurant.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<P>__{(continuing; breath)}
<D>__{i think you should not come in, or come in depending on how you feel.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{same to you.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{no. i have to go in. i live here.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{right. i will come in.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{okay. wait here a second.}
<P>__{(beat, then)}
<D>__{do we really want to do this?}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(half unsure)}
<D>__{oh hell yes.}
<A>__{she exits, as shot lingers on jerry. that odd moment when you've crossed the line. he takes a breath.}
