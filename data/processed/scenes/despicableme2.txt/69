<L>__{int: shopping mall day}
<A>__{gru, edith and agnes race across the mall. then agnes points over to the salsa restaurant as margo and antonio walk in.}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{there she goes!}
<L>__{int: eduardo's salsa & salsa day}
<A>__{gru enters to see margo and antonio sitting together in the back of the restaurant together. margo laughs at something antonio said.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{oh, you're so funny...}
<C>__{edith}
<D>__{gross! look, they're in love!}
<A>__{these words hit gru like a smack in the face.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{oh, no, no, no! do not say that they are...no no no, no!}
<A>__{he storms in. edith and agnes follow.}
<C>__{antonio }
<D>__{...and my dream is to one day play video games for a living.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{wow. you're so complicated.}
<A>__{gru storms over to margo. attempts a smile.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{margo. what is going on here?}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{oh! gru, se llama antonio. me llamo margo.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{me llama lama ding dong, who cares. let's go.}
<A>__{salsa music begins to play and a curtain opens across the room. woosh! someone leaps out, spinning like a tornado, then lands in the middle of the restaurant with a flourish. it's eduardo.}
<C>__{margo}
<D>__{whoa!}
<A>__{everyone in the restaurant cheers. gru frowns. not this guy! the music continues and eduardo dances across the floor and out into the mall where he grabs a passing shopper and pulls her into the restaurant. the confused woman holds on for the ride as eduardo twirls and dances her all around the floor. he dips her and she melts, as do all of the women watching. eduardo gazes into the woman's eyes and produces a business card.}
<C>__{eduardo}
<D>__{kids eat free on tuesdays.}
<A>__{the woman grabs the business card from his hand with her teeth. then eduardo flings her across the floor and she twirls back out into the mall where she knocks over her confused husband. then the song comes to an end and eduardo strikes a final pose. everyone in the studio cheers.}
<C>__{girls}
<D>__{yeah! wahoo! cool! awesome!}
<A>__{everyone except gru. eduardo walks over to him and gives him a big warm hug.}
<C>__{eduardo}
<D>__{so good to see you again, mi compadre!}
<A>__{gru tries to get out of the hug as quickly as he can.}
<C>__{antonio}
<D>__{oh, i see you have already met my father.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{what the father?!}
<C>__{eduardo}
<D>__{si! look at this crazy small world we live in, eh? come, sit, let me get you something.}
<A>__{gru looks down and sees eduardo's chicken glaring at him. it squawks. it's unsettling.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{oh... look at you.}
<A>__{eduardo scoops the chicken up.}
<C>__{gru }
<P>__{(nervous)}
<D>__{haha. he likes me!}
<A>__{gru tries to pet the chicken but pollito lunges at him.}
<C>__{eduardo}
<D>__{oh, oh, i'm sorry, pollito is usually very friendly.}
<P>__{(cradling pollito)}
<D>__{he had a rough night.}
<A>__{the chicken stares relentlessly. gru chuckles nervously.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{well, we really should be going. girls, come on.}
<A>__{gru tries to gather the girls, but eduardo stops him, pushing antonio and margo closer together.}
<C>__{eduardo}
<D>__{that is a pity. young love is beautiful, no?}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{no!}
<P>__{(chuckling nervously)}
<D>__{you know, they're not in love. they hardly know each other!}
<A>__{eduardo suddenly lights up, having an idea.}
<C>__{eduardo}
<D>__{you are right, cabeza de huevo! they must get to know each other better. antonio, why don't you invite your girlfriend and her family to our cinco de mayo party?}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{no, no, i am }
<C>__{girls}
<D>__{si!}
<A>__{the girls are all thrilled at this, as is antonio. as if on cue, music begins playing and they all begin dancing together. antonio takes margo's hand and twirls her across the floor. gru stares at antonio with a look that could kill. a waiter comes by to give gru a party drink, and he promptly crushes the glass with his bare hands. his eye twitches.}
