<A>__{it's about twenty minutes later. dolly into a medium shot of jake waiting by the parking lot. he looks at the delicatessen. joey finally comes out carrying a paper bag. not noticing jake, he walks right past him to his car which is parked near the rear of the outdoor lot.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{hey, joey }
<A>__{jake walks towards joey with his hand outstretched. joey looks at jake. silence. joey turns his back and starts to get into his car. jake runs over to joey and grabs his shoulder.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{no, joey, no. look, wait a minute, please }
<A>__{joey looks at jake like he's shit, throws jake's hand off his shoulder, and starts to get into his car again.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{aw, joey }
<A>__{jake stops joey from getting into his car. he puts his hand on joey's shoulder again.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{you're right. you're perfectly right. you got every right in the world to hate my guts.}
<A>__{joey pulls away from jake's hand, and tries to put the paper bag into the front seat of the car.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{no, please. i know i was a cocksucker. you're right. i shoulda never raised my hands to you.}
<A>__{joey half pushes jake away, and begins to get into his car again. jake pulls joey by the arm.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{no, joey, listen to me }
<A>__{jake pulls too hard, causing joey to drop the paper bag to his feet. the containers of coffee and tea in the bag break open and splatter joey's pants legs. joey stares down at his pants, then up at jake. suddenly, he belts jake with a left and a right to the jaw. jake is taken by surprise, and backs off to get his own hands up. joey keeps pouring it on. jake drops his hands and takes it.}
<C>__{jake }

<A>__{joey stops in mid punch and stares at jake. he can't figure it out. jake nods and tries to smile, but starts to cry instead.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{more. go ahead, joey. i deserve it.}
<A>__{joey pauses, then finally throws a very weak punch to jake's shoulder. he leaves his hand there then, uncurls his fist and finally puts his hand around jake's neck as tears start to fill his eyes. joey hugs jake close to him, crying. they hug each other, both crying. they don't say anything.}
