<L>__{interior officer's lounge (o)}
<A>__{where, first, camera shoots through the window, the myriad of stars, space, the whole magnificent vista. in the lounge, empty but for them, are kirk and mccoy obviously awaiting spock, who enters and presents himself cold and aloof as before:}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{reporting as ordered, captain.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{sit down, please.}
<A>__{spock remains standing, addresses kirk:}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{sir, i would appreciate dr. mccoy absenting himself from this interview.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i want him here.}
<P>__{(indicating)}
<D>__{sit down!}
<A>__{for an instant, it looks like spock will refuse. then, he complies but sits formally, rigidly. he ignores mccoy totally.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{you've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. a group of minds from a space vessel? could you make out any plan, anything to do with earth?}
<C>__{spock}
<P>__{(still formally)}
<D>__{negative, captain. i could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. i can explain nothing more; i understand nothing more.}
<A>__{kirk is clearly disappointed and a bit uncomfortable about what he must ask nexterior he exchanges a glance with mccoy, then:}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{also there was nothing in your report about why you're here.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{that inquiry invades my personal life, captain. mccoy spock, we've already guessed why you're here...}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{i inquired about you learned you were studying with the masters...}
<A>__{although spock has been almost infuriatingly emotionless, his expression shifts slightly. mccoy indicates this:}
<D>__{mccoy that flicker of emotion confirms our guess. you failed.}
<C>__{spock}
<P>__{(facing mccoy for the first time)}
<D>__{your deductions do you credit, doctor... if your puerile curiosity does not. mccoy}
<P>__{(not in amusement)}
<D>__{and now, anger , spock?}
<A>__{spock looks straight ahead his face instantly com posed to almost total blankness.}
<C>__{spock}
<P>__{(beat; nods)}
<D>__{i still contain fragments of my human half.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{and whatever you sensed out here....}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{... is my only hope of accomplishing what the masters could not. mccoy if you achieve perfect logic, spock, you'll pay a price. it's given your planet ten thousand years of peace, but no poetry's been written since then, no music.}
<A>__{spock has come to his feet fast but kirk is on his feet too, confronting him. during which:}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{let it drop, bones.}
<P>__{(to spock)}
<D>__{you are my science officer i will expect an immediate report on anything further you learn or sense from here on.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{i have accepted service here as a starfleet officer... sir.}
<C>__{kirk}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{i know this has been painful, spock. for me too. thank you.}
<A>__{spock exits. kirk and mccoy exchange a troubled look, then exit too as camera centers again on observation window, the view of space there. }
