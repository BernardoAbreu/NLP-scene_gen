<L>__{exterior brownstone walton avenue night}
<A>__{as brian and tim pull up two engine companies are already dragging lines toward the rolling brownstone we saw explode earlier. tim cheers the firemen on like a drive in movie. brian watches the fire with uneasy fascination. embers whipping into the night, drifting to the ground around him. one of the engine companies is entering the doorway now. he watches as they willingly crawl into a place any sane person would run for their life from. jesus christ. flash brian turns at the blinding snap of a camera. several locals are gathered around a parked car, some taking pictures. brian notices that right away. it takes a beat longer to notice the charred corpse stuffed head first through the windshield. it's the porsche driver, his legs sticking out at crazy angles. a dog barks furiously at it.}
<C>__{tim}
<P>__{(also looking at body)}
<D>__{man. something sure put a crimp in his evening.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{backdraft.}
<A>__{the brownstone fire quickly transforms itself into noisy clouds of dirty white steam. and one of the firemen is coming back out now, walking toward brian. when he's just a few yards away he pulls off his air mask and helmet and we shudder with brian, because the man is a dead ringer for his father.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{well, look what we have here. nice costume. rent it?}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{i want to thank you for coming to my graduation, stephen. it was a great inspiration to me.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{so you're going to fight fires now, huh?}
<A>__{he pats brian's cheeks, leaving behind large charcoal smears.}
<C>__{stephen}
<P>__{(re smears)}
<D>__{doesn't work on you.}
<P>__{(turns to leave)}
<D>__{see ya around, little brother.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{not likely.}
<C>__{stephen}
<P>__{(turns)}
<D>__{well, see you're wrong already. had a talk with chief fitzgerald, and we decided in the interest of brotherly love, that maybe you shouldn't be way over on the other side of town. so starting tomorrow, your assigned to company 17. my company.}
<P>__{(brian's color drops a hue)}
<D>__{one case of scotch, you're getting cheap in your old age, brian...}
<A>__{and stephen turns for his own men, tim staring at brian as clouds of smoke drift past like ghosts.}
