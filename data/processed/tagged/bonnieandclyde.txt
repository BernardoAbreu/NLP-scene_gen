<T>__{fade in:}
<L>__{interior bedroom. close up of bonnie parker. day}
<A>__{blonde, somewhat fragile, intelligent in expression. she is putting on make up with intense concentration and appreciation, applying lipstick and eye make up. as the camera slowly pulls back from the closeup we see that we have been looking into a mirror. she is standing before the full length mirror in her bedroom doing her make up. she overdoes it in the style of the time: rosebud mouth and so forth. as the film progresses her make up will be refined until, at the end, there is none. the camera pulls back and continues to move very slowly throughout the first part of this scene. as the camera continues to move away, we see, by degrees, that bonnie is naked. her nudity is never blatantly revealed to the audience, but implied. that is, she should be "covered" in various ways from the camera's p.o.v., but the audience must be aware of her exposure to clyde later in the scene. this is the only time in the film that she will ever be this exposed, in all senses of the word, to the audience. her attitude and appraisal of herself here are touched with narcissism. the bedroom itself is a second story bedroom in a lower class frame house in west dallas, texas. the neighborhood is low income. though the room reveals its shabby surroundings, it also reveals an attempt by bonnie to fix it up. small and corny objets d'art are all over the tops of the bureaus, vanity tables, etc. (little glass figurines and porcelain statuettes and the like.) bonnie finishes admiring herself. she walks from the mirror and moves slowly across the room, the camera moving with her, until she reaches the screened window on the opposite wall. the shade is up. there are no curtains. she looks out the window, looking down, and the camera looks down with her.}
<L>__{exterior bedroom. bonnie's p.o.v. day.}
<A>__{over her shoulder, we see the driveway leading to the garage connected to the house. there is an old car parked in the driveway, its windows open. we see a man walking up the driveway, somewhat furtively. he is a rather dapper fellow, dressed in a dark suit with a vest, a white collar, and a straw boater. it is clyde barrow. obviously, he is about to steal the car. he looks it over, checking around him to make sure no passers by are coming. he peers inside the front window to see if the keys are in the ignition. he studies the dashboard. bonnie continues watching, silently. finally she calls out.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{hey, boy! what you doin' with my mama's car?}
<L>__{exterior driveway. day.}
<A>__{clyde, startled, jumps and looks to see who has caught him. obviously frightened, he looks up and his face freezes at what he sees.}
<L>__{exterior window. clyde's p.o.v. day.}
<A>__{we now see what he is looking at: at the open window, revealed from the waist up, is the naked bonnie. she looks down, an impudent half smile on her face. she doesn't move or make any attempt to cover herself.}
<L>__{exterior close up of clyde day }
<A>__{ whose face changes from astonishment to an answering smile of impudence. (seeing what he has, he realizes that this girl is clearly not going to scream for the police. already they are in a little game instigated by bonnie, sizing each other up, competing in a kind of playful arrogance. before they speak, they have become coconspirators.) close up of bonnie, still smiling. finally she speaks.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{wait there!}
<L>__{interior bedroom. day.}
<A>__{running from the window, she flings open a closet and grabs a dress, and shoes. she slips on the shoes, and flings the dress on, running out the door as she does. the camera tracks with her, moving as fast. as she runs down the stairs she buttons up the dress.}
<L>__{exterior driveway. day.}
<A>__{she flies out the door, slamming it behind her, runs off the porch (all this has been one continuous movement since she left the window, in great haste) and continues quickly into the driveway. four feet away from clyde, she stops on a dime. they stand there, looking at each other, smiling the same challenge. for a few seconds, no one speaks, then:}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(putting her on)}
<D>__{ain't you ashamed? tryin' to steal an old lady's automobile.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(with the same put on)}
<D>__{i been thinkin' about buyin' me one.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{bull. you ain't got money for dinner, let alone buy no car.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(still the battle of wits going on)}
<D>__{now i got enough money for cokes, and since it don't look like you're gonna invite me inside }
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{you'd steal the dining room table if i did.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(he moves from his spot)}
<D>__{come to town with me, then. how'd that be?}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(starting to walk onto the sidewalk)}
<D>__{goin' to work anyway.}
<L>__{exterior street. moving shot. day.}
<A>__{the camera tracks. it is a hot texas afternoon, all white light and glare. as they walk the block to town in this scene, their manner of mutual impudence is still pervading.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{goin' to work, huh? what do you do?}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{none of your business.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(pretending to give it serious thought)}
<D>__{i bet you're a...movie star!}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{no...a lady mechanic?...no...a maid? }
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(really offended by that)}
<D>__{what do you think i am?}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(right on the nose)}
<D>__{a waitress.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(slightly startled by}
<D>__{his accuracy, anxious to get back now that he is temporarily}
<P>__{one up)}
<D>__{what line of work are you in? when you're not stealin' cars?}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(mysteriously)}
<D>__{i tell you, i'm lookin' for suitable employment right at the moment.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{what did you do before?}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(coolly, knowing its effect)}
<D>__{i was in state prison.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{state prison?}
<P>__{(she shows her surprise)}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(herself again)}
<D>__{guess some little old lady wasn't so nice.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(tough)}
<D>__{it was armed robbery.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(sarcastically)}
<D>__{my, my, the things that turn up in the driveway these days.}
<A>__{they reach the corner and turn. they are on:}
<L>__{exterior main street. day.}
<A>__{ a small town street of barber shops, cafes, groceries, etc. at the moment, it is deserted. they continue walking down the empty street. clyde looks the place over. tracking.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{what do y'all do for a good time around here, listen to the grass grow?}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{guess you had a lot more fun up at state prison, huh?}
<A>__{clyde laughs, enjoying her repartee. they continue walking. at a hydrant, clyde stops.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(showing off, but seriously)}
<D>__{see this foot?}
<P>__{(pointing at his right foot)}
<D>__{i chopped two toes off of it. with an axe.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{what? why?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{to get off the damn work detail, that's why.}
<P>__{(stopping)}
<D>__{want to see?}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(a lady of some sensitivity)}
<D>__{no!...}
<P>__{(turning a cute)}
<D>__{i surely don't intend to stand here and look at your dirty feet in the middle of main street.}
<A>__{they continue walking in silence past a few stores, each planning what next to say.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{boy, did you really do that?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{you must be crazy.}
<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior gas station. day.}
<A>__{gas station up the block. bonnie and clyde are seen leaning against the soft drink chest, their profiles silhouetted by the bright sun. they are drinking cokes. as they begin to talk, the camera moves in closer to them. clyde takes off his hat and rubs the cold coke bottle across his forehead. bonnie watches him.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{what's it like?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{prison?}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(very interested)}
<D>__{no, armed robbery.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(he thinks it a silly question)}
<D>__{it's...i don't know...it isn't like anything.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(thinking she's heard proof that he's a liar)}
<D>__{hah! i knew you never robbed bo place, you faker.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(challenged)}
<D>__{oh, yeah?}
<P>__{(studies her, then}
<D>__{makes up his mind to}
<P>__{show her)}
<A>__{close up. gun. day. he reaches in his jacket and pulls out a gun. the camera moves to a closeup of the gun, glinting in the sunlight.}
<L>__{exterior street. day.}
<A>__{the camera pulls back to show bonnie looking at it with fascination. the weapon has an immediate effect on her. she touches it in a manner almost sexual, full of repressed excitement.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(goading him on)}
<D>__{yeah, well you got one all right, i guess...but you wouldn't have the gumption to use it.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(picking up the challenge, proving himself)}
<D>__{you just keep your eyes open.}
<L>__{exterior little grocery store across the street. day.}
<A>__{the camera remains just behind bonnie's shoulder so that throughout the following scene we have bonnie in the picture, looking at what we look at. clyde goes into the little store. we remain outside with bonnie watching. for a minute nothing happens. we can barely see what is going on in the store. then clyde comes out, walking slowly. in one hand he holds the gun, in the other a fistful of money. he gets halfway, to bonnie and smiles broadly at her, a smile of charm and personality. she smiles back. the moment is intense, as if a spark has jumped from one to the other. their relationship, which began the minute bonnie spotted him in the driveway, has now really begun. clyde has shown his stuff and bonnie is "turned on." suddenly the old man who runs the grocery store comes running out into the street, completely dumbfounded. he stands there and says nothing, yet his mouth moves in silent protest. clyde points the gun above him and fires. it is the first loud noise in the film thus far and it should be a shock. the old man, terrified, runs back into the store as fast as he can, clyde quickly grabs bonnie's hand. the camera swings with them as they turn and begin to run down the street. a few yards and the stores disappear entirely. the landscape turns into that arid, flat and unrelieved western plain that begins where the town ends.}
<L>__{exterior store. at the edge of town. day.}
<A>__{a car is parked at the back of the store. as soon as they reach it, clyde motions and bonnie gets in. clyde runs to the front, lifts up the hood and crosses the wires to make it start. as he stands back, bonnie calls to him:}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{hey, what's your name, anyway?}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(he slams the hood)}
<D>__{clyde barrow.}
<A>__{he runs over to the door, opens it, shoves her over, and starts up the engine. the entire sequence is played at an incredible rapid pace.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(loud, to make}
<D>__{herself heard over}
<P>__{the gunning motor)}
<D>__{hi, i'm bonnie parker. please to meet you.}
<L>__{exterior road. day.}
<A>__{vroom! the car zooms off down the road, doing 90. the fast country breakdown music starts up on the sound track, going just as fast as the car.}
<L>__{exterior car. day.}
<A>__{the car, still speeding, further down the road. we zoom down and look in the rear window. clyde is driving, we see from behind. bonnie is all over him, biting his ear, ruffling his hair, running her hands all over him in short, making passionate love to him while he drives. the thrill of the robbery and the escape has turned her on sexually.}
<L>__{exterior car. another angle. day.}
<A>__{the camera pulls back and above the car. the car starts to go crazy in a comical fashion, manifesting to the audience just what is happening to the driver controlling it. the car swerves all over the road. the car comes to a sudden halt. the car starts again. it swerves this time almost right off the road before it straightens out. it jumps and jerks. another car comes down the road the other way and clyde's car swerves so much as to make the other guy drive right off the road into the dirt. it is almost mack sennett stuff, but not quite that much.}
<L>__{interior car. bonnie and clyde. day.}
<A>__{bonnie grabs the wheel and turns it sharply.}
<L>__{exterior car. day.}
<A>__{it hairpins off the road onto a shoulder beneath some trees.}
<L>__{interior car. bonnie and clyde. day.}
<A>__{ still settling to a stop. bonnie and clyde appear to be necking heavily now, punctuated by bonnie's squeals of passion as she squirms and hops about like a flea, trying to get to clyde. the floor gear shift is keeping their bodies apart, however. in exasperation, bonnie takes the gear shift and shoves it forward out of their way. she plunges onto clyde, burying him from view.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(kissing, biting)}
<D>__{...you ready?...}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(muffled, laughing)}
<D>__{...hey, wait...}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(giggling herself)}
<D>__{aren't you ready? well, get ready!}
<A>__{bonnie has obviously touched him. with savage coquetry she tears into her clothes and his.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(muffled)}
<D>__{c'mon, honey, c'mon, boy...let's go...let's...}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(muffled)}
<D>__{hey...hey, wait a minute...quit that now, cut it out.}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{i said, cut it out!}
<A>__{he shoves her rudely away, slamming her into the far car door. suddenly it looks as if they've been fighting. both unbuttoned and unglued, they stare silently at one another, breathing heavily. clyde gets out of the car, clearly shaken. despite the fact that he may have encountered this situation many times before, it's one that no twenty one year old boy in 1932 is sophisticated enough to dismiss easily with bravado. bonnie remains seated in the car. she seems terribly vulnerable. she fumbles about for a cigarette, too confused to figure out what didn't happen. clyde turns back and reaches through the car window from the driver's side, lighting it for her. bonnie casts clyde a fishy stare, then accepts the light.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(trying to be casual, even insouciant)}
<D>__{look, i don't do that. it's not that i can't }
<P>__{(his voice cracks,}
<D>__{the match burns his fingers, and he bangs his head onto roof of car, and he goes}
<P>__{right on)}
<D>__{ it's just that i don't see no percentage in it.}
<C>__{clyde }
<D>__{i mean there's nothin' wrong with me, i don't like boys.}
<A>__{bonnie doesn't know what she thinks, and clyde is trying to gauge her reaction whether she feels rejected or repelled. in fact, it's both along with a little latent fascination.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(finally, spitting out smoke)}
<D>__{boy...boy...boy...}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(a little annoyed)}
<D>__{boy, what?}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{your advertising is dandy. folks'd just never guess you don't have a thing to sell.}
<P>__{(a little afraid)}
<D>__{you better take me home, now.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(getting back into car)}
<D>__{wait!}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{don't touch me!}
<A>__{she gets out of car, leaving clyde draped across the front seat, reaching after her.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(almost shouting)}
<D>__{if all you want's stud service, then get on back to west dallas and stay there the rest of your life!}
<A>__{this stops her. now clyde pours it on, with an almost maniacal exuberance that becomes more controlled as he gets control of bonnie.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{but you're worth more'n that, a lot more, and you know it, and that's why you come along with me. you could find a lover boy on every corner in town and it doesn't make a damn to them whether you're waiting on tables or picking cotton, so long as you cooperate. but it does make a damn to me!}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(turning, intrigued)}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{why? because you're different! you're like me and you want different things.}
<A>__{bonnie is hooked now.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you and me travelin' together, we could cut clean acrost this state, and kansas, too, and maybe dip into oklahoma, and missouri or whatnot, and catch ourselves highpockets and a highheeled ol' time. we can be somethin' we could never be alone. i will show you...when we walk into the adolphus hotel in san antone', you wearin' a silk dress, they'll be waitin' on you and believe me, sugar, they're gonna know your last name.}
<A>__{he stops, having begun to woo her to something more intense than a casual, physical coupling.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{when'd you figure that all out?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{first time i saw you.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{how come?}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(intensely, with real honesty)}
<D>__{'cause you may be the best damn girl in texas.}
<A>__{close up. bonnie.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{who are you, anyway?}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior roadside cafe. bonnie and clyde. day.}
<A>__{bonnie and clyde seated in booth, now c.u. clyde. the sound track bridges the scene: the question that bonnie has just asked is now suddenly rebutted by clyde, as he points a finger at her.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(not answering her,}
<D>__{preferring to lead}
<P>__{the conversation)}
<D>__{i will tell you about you.}
<A>__{he loves doing this and he does it well. the more he envisions bonnie's life, the more instinctively accurate he becomes. she grows more and more fascinated, like a child watching a mind reader.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{lessee...you were born somewheres around east texas...got a big old family, right?...you went to school, of course, but you didn't take to it much 'cause you was a lot smarter than everybody else anyway. so you just quit. now...}
<P>__{(thinking, playing it for all it's worth)}
<D>__{...when you were sixteen...no, seventeen, there was a guy who worked in...uh...}
<A>__{pull back taking in bonnie, favoring clyde.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(fascinated)}
<D>__{cement plant }
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{right. cement plant. and you liked him 'cause he thought you was just as nice as you could be. you almost married that guy, but then...you thought, no, you didn't think you would. so you got your job in the cafe...}
<P>__{(getting closer to}
<D>__{home now, hitting}
<P>__{them right in there)}
<D>__{and every morning you wake up and you hate it. you just hate it. and you get down there and you put on your white uniform }
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(enthralled)}
<D>__{pink.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{and the truck drivers come in to eat greasy burgers and they kid you and you kid them back, but they're stupid and dumb, boys with big tattoos all over 'em, and you don't like it...and they ask you for dates and sometimes you go...but you mostly don't, and all they ever try is to get into your pants whether you want to or not...and you go home and sit in your room and think, when and how will i ever get away from this?...and now you know.}
<A>__{bonnie is half mesmerized by his talk. a waitress comes with their food. a cheap, gaudy dame, she has spit curls on each temple in the style of the times. clyde looks at her and at bonnie, who also wears spit curls. as soon as the waitress leaves:}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(pointing at her hair)}
<D>__{change that. i don't like it.}
<A>__{without a word of protest, bonnie immediately reaches in her bag and takes out a mirror. she holds it up and with the other hand, brushes back her spit curls into her hair. she never again wears them. when she has pushed them back she looks at clyde for his approval. he nods his okay. she smiles, puts back her mirror and begins to eat her food. she's ravenously hungry and eats with total concentration on her plate. clyde doesn't touch his food, just watches bonnie eat for a minute.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{god, you're a knockout.}
<L>__{exterior roadside cafe. day for dusk.}
<A>__{clyde and bonnie emerge from the cafe into the early evening. they move toward the car they have stolen. just beyond sits a newer model car. bonnie is surprised to see clyde head toward the newer car.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{hey, that ain't ours.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{sure it is.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{but we came in this one.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{don't mean we have to go home in it.}
<A>__{she walks amazed around the new car and gets in beside him. he turns the key and they pull away from the cafe.}
<L>__{interior abandoned farm house. a wide shot of the parlor living}
<B>__{room. day.}
<A>__{the room is bare. in the middle bonnie is waking, having slept on a couple of car seats covered with an old piece of tattered blanket. there are windows behind her. she looks about bewildered.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{clyde...}
<A>__{she starts to panic and runs to the window.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{clyde...}
<A>__{at another window clyde appears.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{hey, lady.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(chagrined at her fear)}
<D>__{where you been keeping yourself?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{slept out by the car.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{oh...these accommodations ain't particularly deluxe.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{no...if they're after us, i want the first shot. come on, you got some work to do.}
<A>__{bonnie moves to the door and out of the house.}
<L>__{exterior farm house. front yard. day.}
<A>__{on the door is a sign which reads:}
<T>__{insert:}
<A>__{property of midlothian citizens bank trespassers will be}
<B>__{prosecuted.}
<A>__{wide angle. across fence. day. on the dilapidated picket fence six old bottles have been placed. as bonnie joins clyde he turns and fires six quick shots. the bottles disappear.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{you're good.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{the best.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{and modest...}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{come on. got you all set up over here.}
<A>__{wider angle. they move around to the side of the building where clyde points to a tire hanging by a rope from a tree. he means that to be bonnie's target. he hands her a gun.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{set her spinnin'.}
<A>__{bonnie fires. she misses.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{again. come down slow with it...}
<A>__{bonnie fires again and hits the tire. she smiles and blows the smoke from the barrel in pride and self mockery.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{ain't you something? i tell you i'm going to get you a smith and wesson, it'll be easier in your hand. now try it again once...}
<A>__{bonnie sights. as she is about to fire, a man appears around the corner of the building. a farmer. she fires and hits the tire.}
<C>__{farmer}
<D>__{heighdo.}
<A>__{clyde whirls at the sound. he grabs gun from bonnie because his is empty. he aims at farmer.}
<C>__{farmer}
<P>__{(frightened)}
<D>__{no sir...no sir. you all go right ahead.}
<A>__{clyde watches him warily.}
<C>__{farmer}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{used to be my place. not any more. bank took it.}
<A>__{clyde and bonnie start to move toward the farmer. all three move around to the front of the building. at a distance we see an okie car loaded with belongings. a woman with a baby in arms sits in front. a smaller boy stands outside the car.}
<C>__{farmer}
<D>__{yessir, moved us off. now it belongs to them.}
<P>__{(he points at the foreclosure sign.)}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{well, that's a pitiful shame.}
<A>__{clyde shakes his head sympathetically. he loads the empty gun.}
<C>__{farmer}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{you're damned right, ma'm.}
<A>__{he looks up to see an old negro who has come from a distance shack and now stands near clyde's car.}
<C>__{farmer}
<P>__{(nodding toward negro)}
<D>__{me and him put in the years here. yessir. so you all go right ahead. we just come by for a last look.}
<A>__{he stands a moment looking at the house and then turns around toward his family in the car. clyde and bonnie look after him. clyde spins and fires three fast shots into the fore closure sign. the farmer stops and turns, looking at clyde. clyde offers the gun to the farmer. he looks at it, then accepts it. he slowly takes aim at the sign and fires. it pleases him. he looks at clyde and bonnie who smile.}
<C>__{farmer}
<D>__{you all mind?}
<A>__{bonnie and clyde are puzzled.}
<C>__{farmer}
<D>__{hey, davis! come on over here.}
<A>__{the negro moves toward them. now bonnie understands. she takes the second gun from clyde and hands it to davis. davis looks from bonnie to the farmer and toward the house. the farmer fires again. this time at a window. he nods to davis. davis slowly raises the gun and fires at another window. it shatters and they can't keep from laughing. the farmer returns the gun as does davis.}
<C>__{farmer}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{much obliged.}
<A>__{he extends his hand. clyde shakes it.}
<C>__{farmer}
<D>__{otis harrison. and this here's davis. we worked this place.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(formally)}
<D>__{miss bonnie parker. and i'm clyde barrow.}
<A>__{across farmer's car. wide shot. day. the farmer turns and moves toward his people. davis moves toward his shack. clyde and bonnie in the b.g. close angle. bonnie and clyde.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{we rob banks.}
<A>__{bonnie turns quickly to look at clyde. he smiles and nods.}
<T>__{fade out: fade in:}
<L>__{exterior a long, country road. day.}
<A>__{a car is driving down it. it is the next day. bonnie is driving, clyde beside her.}

<D>__{clyde...what would you do, what would you do it some miracle happened and we could walk out tomorrow morning and start all over again, clean, with no record, with nobody after us?}
<A>__{clyde thinks about it a minute.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{well...i guess i'd do it all different. first off, i wouldn't live in the same state where we pull our jobs. we'd live in one state and stay clean there, and when we wanted to take a bank, we'd go to another state...and...}
<A>__{suddenly he realizes that he has said the worst thing he could have, that it was not the answer bonnie wanted to hear. he looks down at her, his voice anxious.}

<D>__{bonnie?}
<A>__{she is silent.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{hey, bonnie?}

<A>__{a street in arcadia. the car is parked. bonnie and clyde walks toward the car carrying big bags of groceries and supplies and put them inside.}

<D>__{what happened to c.w.?}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{he stopped off in that hardware store to get light bulbs for his daddy.}

<P>__{(kidding around)}
<D>__{you plannin' to drive with your shoes off?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{sure, why not?}
<A>__{he reaches in his shirt pocket and takes out his sunglasses. as he goes to put them on, one of the lenses falls out.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{damn!}
<A>__{he puts them on.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{you gonna wear 'em?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{sure, drive with one eye shut.}
<A>__{bonnie gets in the car, rummages around in one of the bags and pulls out something wrapped in tissue paper. she unwraps it and puts it up on the dashboard, displaying it. it is a little porcelain shepherdess holding a crook in her hand, worth about thirty cents.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(admiring it)}
<D>__{isn't that the prettiest thing, hon? just look here, you can see every little fingernail on her hands.}
<A>__{she shows him.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{it is a pretty thing, honey.}
<A>__{clyde turns on the radio and gets some hillbilly music. they are singing "little church in the valley." he beats time on the steering wheel, getting a little impatient. bonnie puts her shepherdess away and begins looking in the grocery sack.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{we got any peaches? i sure could go for a peach right now.}
<A>__{she burrows in the bag and comes out with a peach. she takes a big bite. the juice drips down the side of her mouth. she looks beautiful.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(he stops drumming}
<D>__{his fingers, suddenly}
<P>__{has an idea)}
<D>__{whyn't we do it tomorrow?}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{do what?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{tomorrow's sunday, ain't it? we could drive all night and be on that golf course tomorrow morning!}
<C>__{bonnie}

<D>__{and excited, he is}

<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{nothin' happened.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(more urgently)}
<D>__{go take a look, see what's keepin' him.}
<A>__{not too delighted with the chore, bonnie goes off. we remain with clyde, getting anxious. the music plays on. bonnie comes back, hurriedly, now anxious herself.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{he ain't there.}
<A>__{clyde jumps into action, slams his door.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{c'mon, let's go.}
<A>__{bonnie gets in. they drive off.}
<L>__{interior store. close up c.w. day.}
<A>__{ hiding inside a store, peering out through a curtained window at them driving away. his expression is disturbed; his face half in shadow.}
<L>__{exterior road. day.}
<A>__{bonnie and clyde's car coming down the road. camera sees from clyde's p.o.v. malcolm standing in the road, waving him down. the pickup truck, its back jacked up, is parked beside him on a shoulder of the road.}

<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{what's wrong?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<L>__{exterior road.}
<A>__{clyde reaches the spot, pulls off the road and stops the car. he gets out. camera pulls back. clyde talks to the old man, bonnie stays in the car. cut to a shut down the trench of the law, tense. suddenly, a truck loaded with chickens comes riding down the road from the opposite direction. hamer sees it from a long way away and realizes that he cannot afford to let anything pass between him and his quarry. he decides the time is now. he leaps up from the trench and yells at clyde.}
<C>__{hamer}
<D>__{barrow!}
<A>__{the old man dives under his truck to hide. the shooting starts. we see the chicken truck. two men in the front seat. they see ahead of them an incredible shooting match and, in terror, they jam on the brakes and leap out of the truck. they run as fast as they can into the meadow, away from the trouble. the gun fight takes just seconds during which law fires eight seven shots at bonnie and clyde, giving them absolutely no chance. the sound is rapid, deafening. at no point in the gun fight do we see bonnie and clyde in motion. we see, instead, two still photographs cut into the sequence: one of clyde, half out of the car, taking careful dead aim with his gun, just as he did in the teaching scene: one of bonnie, in terror, a pack of cigarettes in her hand clutched tight, looking as fragile and beautiful as she can be. the noise stops at once. utter silence. it has been a massacre. bonnie and clyde never had a chance to return the gunfire. we see the car, a complete shambles. we never see bonnie and clyde dead, though for a moment we discern their bodies slumped in the car. the camera pulls above the car until it is on a level with the opposite side of the road. then, slowly, the six lawmen stand up in the trench. on the faces of the five deputies, horror and shock at what they have just done. hamer, however, registers no emotion. his face is a blank. he lights a cigarette. slowly, slowly, the five men begin to edge closer to the car to see the result. music, the wild country breakdown music, begins on the sound track. before they reach the car, the camera swings away from them, past them, and zooms out and above into the meadow where the two truck drivers are standing tiny, distant figures. the truck drivers begin to walk toward the camera, coming back to the road to see what happened. they get closer and closer to the camera until they have reached a middle distance and, as they continue to walk at us, it is }
