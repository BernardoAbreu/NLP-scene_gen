<L>__{interior whale's house studio day}
<A>__{whale and boone are back in their familiar positions. an empty glass of beer sits on the floor next to clay.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i'm curious, mr. boone. what convinced you to come back?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i don't know. i guess i like your stories.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{everybody has stories to tell.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{not me.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{what about your stint in korea? i'm sure it was full of dramatic episodes.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{i told you. i don't like to talk about that.}
<A>__{whale nods, sensing that he's touched a sore spot.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{and the fear you showed at our last session? how did you overcome that?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{not fear. more like disgust.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{same difference, mr. boone. disgust, fear of the unknown all part of the great gulf that stands between us. am i right in assuming that you've had little experience with men of my persuasion?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{there's no people like you in my crowd.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{no teammates in football? no comrades in korea?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you must think the whole world is queer. well it's not. war sure isn't.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{oh, there may not be atheists in the foxholes, but there are occasionally lovers.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you're talking through your hat now.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{not at all. i was in the foxholes myself.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{you were a soldier?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i was an officer.}
<A>__{clay breaks his pose to turn and look at whale.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{this was world war i?}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{no, my dear. the crimean war. what do you think? the great war. you had a good war, while we had }
<A>__{whale clears his throat, bored by his standard line.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{ a war without end. there were trenches when i arrived, and trenches when i left, two years later. just like in the movies. only the movies never get the stench of them. the world reduced to mud and sandbags and a narrow strip of rainy sky.}
<P>__{(a dry snort)}
<D>__{but we were discussing something else. oh yes. love in the trenches.}
<A>__{now he's talking only to himself.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{barnett. was that his name? leonard barnett. he came to the front straight from harrow. and he looked up to me. unlike the others, he didn't care that i was a workingman impersonating his betters. how strange, to be admired so blindly. i suppose he loved me. but chastely, like a schoolboy.}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{something happened to him?}
<A>__{whale looks up at clay, stares at him.}
<C>__{whale}
<D>__{i remember one morning in particular. a morning when the sun came out.}
