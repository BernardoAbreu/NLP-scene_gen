<A>__{the paramount logo is presented austerely over a black background. there is a moment's hesitation, and then the simple words in white lettering:}
<B>__{the godfather}
<A>__{while this remains, we hear: "i believe in america." suddenly we are watching in close view, amerigo bonasera, a man of sixty, dressed in a black suit, on the verge of great emotion.}
<C>__{bonasera}
<D>__{america has made my fortune.}
<A>__{as he speaks, the view imperceptibly begins to loosen.}
<C>__{bonasera}
<D>__{i raised my daughter in the american fashion; i gave her freedom, but taught her never to dishonor her family. she found a boy friend, not an italian. she went to the movies with him, stayed out late. two months ago he took her for a drive, with another boy friend. they made her drink whiskey and then they tried to take advantage of her. she resisted; she kept her honor. so they beat her like an animal. when i went to the hospital her nose was broken, her jaw was shattered and held together by wire, and she could not even weep because of the pain.}
<A>__{he can barely speak; he is weeping now.}
<C>__{bonasera}
<D>__{i went to the police like a good american. these two boys were arrested and brought to trial. the judge sentenced them to three years in prison, and suspended the sentence. suspended sentence! they went free that very day. i stood in the courtroom like a fool, and those bastards, they smiled at me. then i said to my wife, for justice, we must go to the godfather.}
<A>__{by now, the view is full, and we see don corleone's office in his home. the blinds are closed, and so the room is dark, and with patterned shadows. we are watching bonasera over the shoulder of don corleone. tom hagen sits near a small table, examining some paperwork, and sonny corleone stands impatiently by the window nearest his father, sipping from a glass of wine. we can hear music, and the laughter and voices of many people outside.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{bonasera, we know each other for years, but this is the first time you come to me for help. i don't remember the last time you invited me to your house for coffee...even though our wives are friends.}
<C>__{bonasera}
<D>__{what do you want of me? i will give you anything you want, but do what i ask!}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{and what is that bonasera?}
<A>__{bonasera whispers into the don's ear.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{no. you ask for too much.}
<C>__{bonasera}
<D>__{i ask for justice.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{the court gave you justice.}
<C>__{bonasera}
<D>__{an eye for an eye!}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{but your daughter is still alive.}
<C>__{bonasera}
<D>__{then make them suffer as she suffers. how much shall i pay you.}
<A>__{both hagen and sonny react.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{you never think to protect yourself with real friends. you think it's enough to be an american. all right, the police protects you, there are courts of law, so you don't need a friend like me. but now you come to me and say don corleone, you must give me justice. and you don't ask in respect or friendship. and you don't think to call me godfather; instead you come to my house on the day my daughter is to be married and you ask me to do murder...for money.}
<C>__{bonasera}
<D>__{america has been good to me...}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{then take the justice from the judge, the bitter with the sweet, bonasera. but if you come to me with your friendship, your loyalty, then your enemies become my enemies, and then, believe me, they would fear you...}
<A>__{slowly, bonasera bows his head and murmurs.}
<C>__{bonasera}
<D>__{be my friend.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{good. from me you'll get justice.}
<C>__{bonasera}

<A>__{a high angle of the corleone mall in bright daylight. there are at least five hundred guests filling the main courtyard and gardens. there is music and laughing and dancing and countless tables covered with food and wine. don corleone stands at the gate, flanked on either side by a son: fredo and sonny, all dressed in the formal attire of the wedding party. he warmly shakes the hands, squeezes the hands of the friends and guests, pinches the cheeks of the children, and makes them all welcome. they in turn carry with them gallons of homemade wine, cartons of freshly baked bread and pastries, and enormous trays of italian delicacies. the entire family poses for a family portrait: don corleone, mama, sonny, his wife, sandra, and their children, tom hagen and his wife, theresa, and their baby; constanzia, the bride, and her bridegroom, carlo rizzi. as they move into the pose, the don seems preoccupied.}

<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{he'll be here pop, it's still early.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{then the picture will wait for him.}
<A>__{everyone in the group feels the uneasiness as the don moves back to the house. sonny gives a delicious smile in the direction of the maid of honor, lucy mancini. she returns it. then he moves to his wife.}

<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{you watch yourself.}
<A>__{hagen kisses his wife, and follows the don, passing the wine barrels, where a group of four men nervously wait. tom crooks a finger at nazorine, who doublechecks that he is next, straightens, and follows hagen.}
<L>__{ext day: mall entrance (summer 1945)}
<A>__{outside the main gate of the mall, several men in suits, working together with a man in a dark sedan, walk in and out of the rows of parked cars, writing license plate numbers down in their notebooks. we hear the music and laughter coming from the party in the distance. a man stops at a limousine and copies down the number. barzini, dignified in a black homburg, is always under the watchful eyes of two bodyguards as he makes his way to embrace don corleone in the courtyard. the men walk down another row of parked cars. put another number in the notebook. a shiney new cadillac with wooden bumpers. peter clemenza, dancing the tarantella joyously, bumping bellies with the ladies.}

<D>__{paulie...wine...wine.}

<C>__{clemenza}
<D>__{what are you, a dance judge? go do your job; take a walk around the neighborhood... see everything is okay.}
<A>__{paulie nods and leaves; clemenza takes a breath, and leaps back into the dance. the men walk down another row of parked cars. put another number in the notebook. tessio, a tall, gentle looking man, dances with a nine year old girl, her little black party shoes planted on his enormous brown shoes. the men move on to other parked cars, when sonny storms out of the gate, his face flushed with anger, followed by clemenza and paulie.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{buddy, this is a private party.}
<A>__{the man doesn't answer, but points to the driver of the sedan. sonny menacingly thrusts his reddened face at him. the driver merely flips open his wallet to a greed card, without saying a word. sonny steps back, spits on the ground, turns, and walks away, followed by clemenza, paulie, and another two men. he doesn't say a thing for most of the walk back into the courtyard, and then, muttered to paulie.}

<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{i don't want to use clemenza's people right now. understood?}
<A>__{he hangs up. he moves quickly to a wall safe; operates the dial, and removes a small notebook. he takes it back to the desk, and runs over the list of numbers with his forefinger. we follow the names, until the finger stops at one: luca brasi. sonny dials the number. there is no answer.}

<A>__{sollozzo rises, impatiently.}
<C>__{sollozzo}
<D>__{that's going to be his first reaction. you have to talk some sense into him. the tattaglia family stands behind me with all their people. the other new york families will go along with anything that prevents a full scale war.}

<C>__{sollozzo}
<D>__{the don was slipping; in the old days i could never have gotten to him. now he's dead, nothing can bring him back. talk to sonny, talk to the caporegimes, clemenza and tessio...it's good business.}

<D>__{how's mom?}

<D>__{how did things ever go so far? well, no matter. a lot of foolishness has come to pass. it was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.}
<A>__{the view examines the room once again, as the don speaks. a large, clicking board is changing numbers at various times, and two tapes, showing the fluctuations of the market during the day's trading, and projected above. don corleone pauses; and tom hagen hands him a cold drink.}

<C>__{barzini}
<D>__{don corleone is too modest. he had the judges and politicians in his pocket and he refused to share them. his refusal is not the act of a friend. he takes the bread out of the mouths of our families. times have changed, it's not like the old days where everyone can go his own way. if don corleone had all the judges and politicians in new york, then he must share them or let others use them. certainly he can present a bill for such services, we're not communists, after all. but he has to let us draw water from the well. it's that simple.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{my friends, i didn't refuse out of malice. you all know me. when have i ever refused an accommodation? but why, this time? because i think this drug business will destroy us in the years to come. it's not like whiskey or gambling or even women which most people want and is forbidden them by the pezzonovante of the church and the government. but drugs? no. even policemen, who help us in gambling and other things would refuse to help us in drugs. but...i am willing to do whatever all of you think is necessary.}
<C>__{don zaluchi}
<D>__{i don't believe in drugs. for years i paid my people extra so they wouldn't do that kind of business...$200 a week. but it didn't matter. somebody comes to them and says, "i have powders, if you put up three, four thousand dollar investment, we can make fifty thousand distributing." who can resist such a profit? there's no way to control it, as a business...to keep it respectable.}
<P>__{(rapping the table)}
<D>__{i don't want it near schools! i don't want it sold to children. that is an infamita.}
<P>__{(thinking)}
<D>__{in my city i would try to keep the traffic in the dark people, the colored. they are the best customers, the least troublesome, and they are animals anyway. they have no respect for their wives or their families or themselves. let them lose their souls with drugs. but something has to be done, we can't have everybody running around doing just what they please, like a bunch of anarchists.}

<C>__{tattaglia}
<D>__{i agree to everything here, i'm willing to forget my own misfortune. but i must hear strict assurance from corleone. when time goes by and his position becomes stronger, will he attempt any individual vengeance?}
<A>__{they all look at the don; especially hagen, who feels that don corleone has given a great deal, and must have something else in mind. slowly the don rises.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{i forego my vengeance for my dead son, for the common good. but i have selfish reasons. my youngest son had to flee, accused of sollozzo's murder, and i must now make arrangements so that he can come home with safety, cleared of all those false charges. that is my affair, and i will make those arrangements.}
<P>__{(with strength)}
<D>__{but i am a superstitious man...and so if some unlucky accident should befall my youngest son, if some police officer should accidentally shoot him, or if he should hang himself in his cell, or if my son is struck by a bolt of lightning, then i will blame some of the people here. that, i could never forgive, but...aside from that, let me swear by the souls of my grandchildren that i will never be the one to break the peace we have made.}

<A>__{music comes up; as michael, dressed in new clothes from palermo, and carrying a stack of wrapped gifts, gets into an alfa romeo. calo and fabrizzio each dressed in their sunday best, are in the rear seat, huddled together, with their luparas on their shoulders. don tommassino waves them off, as the little car drives off, rocky and bouncing on the dirt road. the sunday churchbells ring. dissolve }
<L>__{ext day: vitelli house}
<A>__{michael is presented to each of the vitelli relatives, by the yard of their little hilltop house; the brothers; the mother, who is given a gift; several uncles and aunts. finally appolonia enters, dressed beautifully in appropriate sunday clothing. now he presents the wrapped gift to appolonia. she looks at her mother, who with a nod gives her permission to open it. she unwraps it. her eyes light at the sight of a heavy gold chain; to be worn as a necklace. she looks at him.}

<A>__{now the little alpha drives into the village near vitelli's cafe. michael is, as ever, accompanied with his two bodyguards, though they are all dressed differently. they go up to the cafe...and sit with vitelli, who is talking and talking. michael looks at appolonia; who sits, respectfully quiet. she wears the gold necklace around her neck. dissolve }
<L>__{ext day: hilltop near vitelli home}
<A>__{michael and appolonia are walking through a hilltop path, seemingly alone, although a respectful distance apart. as the view pans with them, we notice that her mother and a half dozen aunts are twenty paces behind them, and ten paces further behind are calo and fabrizzio, their luparas on their shoulders. further up the hill, appolonia stumbles on a loose stone, and falls briefly onto michael's arm. she modestly regains her balance, and they continue walking. behind them, her mother giggles to herself. dissolve }

<A>__{church bells in an ancient belfry ring out. music, old and dissonant, plays. there is a bridal procession in the street of the village; the same in feeling and texture as it might have been five hundred years ago. donkeys and other animals have been decorated with abundant flowers; children carrying candles and wearing white confirmation gowns walk in the procession, followed by countless townspeople, members of the clergy, even the police. we present the entire bridal procession and ceremony with all the ritual and pageantry, as it has always been, in sicily. appolonia is radiant as the bride; michael is handsome despite the grotesque jaw and occasional white handkerchief. dissolve }

<A>__{high angle on don tommassino's villa we hear girlish laughter; the little alpha is driving erratically, knocking down an occasional wall, and almost hitting th inner court wall. appolonia is laughing, driving. michael pretends to be frightened, as he teaches her to drive. outside the walls, we notice shepherds with luparas, walking guard duty. the car stops and a laughing michael gets out.}

<A>__{there is the car, with appolonia sitting in the driver's seat, playing with the wheel like a child. calo moves to the car, and puts a lunch basket in the rear seat. then michael seems disturbed. over, on the other side of the courtyard, he sees fabrizzio disappear through the gate.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(muttering to himself)}
<D>__{where the hell is he going?}
<A>__{michael goes down the hallway, and outside. michael steps out into the bright sunlight of the outer courtyard, causing him to shade his eyes. appolonia sees him, and waves, motioning that he should stay where he is.}
<C>__{appolonia}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{i will drive to you.}
<A>__{he smiles affectionately. calo stands beside the car, smiling, with his lupara dangling by his side. there is no sight of fabrizzio. suddenly the smile fades from michael's face. he steps forward and holds out his hand.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{no. no!}
<A>__{his shout is drowned in the roar of a tremendous explosion, as she switched on the ignition. part of the wall is caved in, the kitchen door is blown off; and there is nothing left of the alpha, or of appolonia. michael is thrown against the wall, and knocked unconscious.}
<L>__{int day: villa bedroom}
<A>__{michael is unconscious in a darkened room. we hear whispering around him, but can't make any of it out. a soft cloth is applied to his face; gradually his eyes open. don tommassino is there, close to him. he looks at them and from their grave expressions, he knows his wife is dead.}

<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{no, i wanted other things for you.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you wanted me to be your son.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{yes, but sons who would be professors, scientists, musicians...and grandchildren who could be, who knows, a governor, a president even, nothing's impossible here in america.}

<D>__{then why have i become a man like you?}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{you are like me, we refuse to be fools, to be puppets dancing on a string pulled by other men. i hoped the time for guns and killing and massacres was over. that was my misfortune. that was your misfortune. i was hunted on the streets of corleone when i was twelve years old because of who my father was. i had no choice.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{a man has to choose what he will be. i believe that.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{what else do you believe in?}
<A>__{michael doesn't answer.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{believe in a family. can you believe in your country? those pezzonovante of the state who decide what we shall do with our lives? who declare wars they wish us to fight in to protect what they own. do you put your fate in the hands of men whose only talent is that they tricked a bloc of people to vote for them? michael, in five years the corleone family can be completely legitimate. very difficult things have to happen to make that possible. i can't do them anymore, but you can, if you choose to.}
<A>__{michael listens.}
<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{believe in a family; believe in a code of honor, older and higher, believe in roots that go back thousands of years into your race. make a family, michael, and protect it. these are our affairs, sono cosa nostra, governments only protect men who have their own individual power. be one of those men...you have the choice.}

<D>__{tom, i never thought you were a bad consigliere, i thought santino a bad don, rest in peace. he had a good heart but he wasn't the right man to head the family when i had my misfortune. michael has all my confidence, as you do. for reasons which you can't know, you must have no part in what will happen.}

<C>__{don corleone}
<D>__{there are men in this world who demand to be killed. they argue in gambling games; they jump out of their cars in a rage if someone so much as scratches their fender. these people wander through the streets calling out "kill me, kill me." luca brasi was like that. and since he wasn't scared of death, and in fact, looked for it...i made him my weapon. because i was the only person in the world that he truly hoped would not kill him. i think you have done the same with this man.}
<A>__{they walk through the don's vegetable garden. tomatoes, peppers, carefully tended, and covered with a silky netting. michael follows; the don turns and looks at him. then stoops over to right a tomato plant that had been pushed over.}

<D>__{you can.}
<A>__{tentatively, kay dips her fingers into the water, and blesses herself. then she follows mama down the aisle, in awe at the high ceiling, the art, the windows, and finally the altar. mama stops by the impressive tiers of candles. there is a large coin box for those who wish to pay for lighting candles. mama fumbles in her purse for change; kay gives her some. mama drops the coins in the box, one by one; then takes the taper, and in a pattern known only to her, and with great dignity, she closes her eyes, says a prayer, and then lights twenty candles. she finishes, and bows her head.}
<L>__{ext day: bonasera's funeral home}
<A>__{very few people in the streets. total silence. but black flower cars as far as the eye can see, for blocks and blocks. an expression of respect, of honor and fear that is enormous. certainly no more could be done for a president or a king. each car carries an elaborate floral decoration. we show these in detail; and the flowered messages: "a benefactor to mankind", "he knew and pitied"..."our don our leader"..."the sacred heart"...}

<A>__{silence. the flower cars, funeral limousines, and private cars fill all the areas attendant to the corleone residence. hundreds of people fill the mall, reminiscent in size of the wedding of connie and carlo; of course, now the mood is somber and respectful. michael, mama, fredo and hagen stand by the flowered platform which holds the ornate coffin. we cannot see the remains of don corleone. bonasera is nearby, ready to do service to the bereaved family. one by one the mourners come by, weeping, or merely with grave expressions; pay their respects and continue on. the view alters, and we see that the line is endless. johnny fontane, tears openly falling, takes his turn. children are taken by the hand, and lifted for their last look at the great man. clemenza whispers into the ear of lampone. lampone immediately arranges for the members of the five new york families to pay their respects. first cuneo, then strachi and then zaluchi. then philip tattaglia, who merely passes by the coffin. then barzini in a black homburg, standing a long time. michael watches the scene. barzini crosses himself and passes on, immediately rejoined by his men. as barzini leaves, it seems as though everyone is fawning on him; perhaps asking for favors: but at any rate, it is clear from the doors opened for him, the cigars lit for him, that he is the new capo di capi the place formerly held by don corleone. michael watches silently. barzini is searching for somebody with his eyes. first clemenza. then tessio. connie rushes into michael's arms, tears in her eyes. he embraces and comforts her. everywhere michael goes, neri is a few feet away watching all who come close to him.}
