<A>__{sierra continues to lead the way. she seems confident where she's headed, even though there's no real path. during the conversation, we notice a small tattoo on her right shoulder blade: ix.}
<C>__{sierra}
<D>__{so you play a lot of characters at once?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{a couple. most people do.}
<C>__{sierra}
<D>__{you're not most people. you created the world. you know all the secret codes.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{what, like `god mode'?}
<C>__{sierra}
<D>__{that's what you call it?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{that's when you have all the powers, and you can't be killed. it's fine when you're designing, but it's really boring to play. a game isn't fun unless there are rules.}
<C>__{sierra}
<D>__{and you make the rules.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{yes i do. i mean, you want to give everyone freedom, but they can't handle it. half your players are teenage boys, and it's like they're programmed to be destructive.}
