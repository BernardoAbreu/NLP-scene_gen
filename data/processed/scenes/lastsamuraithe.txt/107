<A>__{omura stands above emperor meiji respectful but persistent. the emperor is kneeling, tending to his iris garden. it is one of the wonders of the palace: a sea of white, pink, blue, and purple blossoms. retainers and servants stand at a distance. one holds a standard with the imperial seal: a yellow chrysanthemum. omura sees katsumoto making his way toward them. he talks a bit more quickly to the emperor. katsumoto begins to prostrate himself before the emperor, the usual sign of extreme respect but the emperor stops him:}
