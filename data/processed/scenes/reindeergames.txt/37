<L>__{exterior rest stop interior gabriel's rig continuous}
<A>__{the rig all alone at a snowy rest area. gabriel, merlin and jumpy climb inside as silhouette sentries. gabriel surveys, then lifts a piece of paper:}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{"my sweet, sexy ashy lashy, i have been dreaming of you constantly, and knowing you are out there makes these walls not seem so close or so strong or so cold..."}
<P>__{(to merlin jumpy)}
<D>__{women live for this stuff.}
<P>__{(reads on)}
<D>__{dreaming 'bout your this, dreaming 'bout your those, gettin' x rated on me here, nicky... where are we... oh, right, other side...}
<P>__{(turns paper over)}
<D>__{"someday i'm gonna take you up by lake s. before i went in, before goddamn millie, 'fore i had my situation, i used to work up at this casino, working security. used to watch for people stealing chips, counting cards, getting piss drunk, that kinda shit. indian place, they hired this reject outta vegas to run it, got about as much business sense as a buffalo patty. anyways, it's a fun place to run some numbers and play."}
<A>__{gabriel puts the letter down.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you're a good writer, nick. i give this writing an a plus.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{i never worked at no casino.}
<C>__{ashley}
<P>__{(hopeless)}
<D>__{nick...}
<A>__{rudy steps out of her hold and stalks forward:}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{that's the guy i was in with, i did my last ten months with him. he rode a two year bit for manslaughter split a guy's skull open at a bar for harassing his girl. that's nick mason. he worked at that casino. he's the one who wrote her letters. me, i'm a damn mechanic, my last job was a quickie lube, i did five for lifting cars. i don't know shit about blackjack, i don't know shit about indians. i'm not him.}
<A>__{gabriel stares at him. then crumples the letter.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{bury this guy.}
<A>__{merlin and jumpy grab rudy and throw him from the truck. he hits the snowy parking lot on his side, hands bound.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{gabriel, you promised!}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i promised that when he helped us, we'd be gone! when he helped us! loverboy don't want to play!}
<A>__{merlin and jumpy drop to the snow, picking rudy up.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{you promised me!}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{and you promised me you'd get your sweetheart to help!}
<A>__{rudy meets eyes with ashley. she's caught.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{he'd rather die than be with you, he'd make a fucked up boyfriend anyway.}
<P>__{(to merlin jumpy)}
<D>__{bury him all over the place.}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{she charges at her brother. gabriel grabs her, spins her into control and punches her in the jaw. she goes flying out of the truck. hits the ground hard. in shock. merlin and jumpy march rudy across the lot. a stand of dark and snowy woods ahead...}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{beats prison, i guess.}
<C>__{ashley }
<D>__{nick!!! nick!!! nooooo!!!}
<A>__{rudy struggles, desperate but held firm. jumpy loads a handgun, as he muses for the very first time:}
<C>__{jumpy}
<D>__{the problem with prison... is that it is founded on the fundamentally flawed perception of rehabilitation through punishment. a society can't hope to create a "changed man" by surrounding him with the worst in his fellow man; what it "rehabilitates" is solely a conviction that if he can survive the inhumanity of prison, what then, can he not withstand? he has seen man's darkest soul and kept his sight: what is left for such a man? what faith? what fear?}
<A>__{at the woods' edge, jumpy gives the gun to merlin }
<C>__{jumpy}
<D>__{don't get no blood on my boots }
<A>__{the gun goes to rudy's head. a bullet fills the chamber. ashley screams. rudy shuts his eyes tight and }
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{what do you want to know!}
<A>__{merlin and jumpy stop. ashley stops screaming. gabriel turns.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{about the tomahawk! what the hell do you want to know!}
<A>__{his guards look to gabriel. rudy nods, sweating.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{i spend six months writing poetry and my goddamn pen pal fucks me over. thanks for the stamps, ash. you want me, you got me. whaddya want to know.}
<A>__{ashley gasps relief. gabriel smiles.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{everything.}
<A>__{merlin and jumpy march rudy back. still on the ground:}
<C>__{ashley}
<D>__{i love you... nick, i love you...}
<A>__{rudy won't meet her eyes.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{hey. she says she loves you, nick.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{she says a lot of things.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{she's getting you to help us... 'cause she knows if you don't, you're dead. you just tell us what we need to know, you two live happily ever after. my sister loves you, motherfucker, and i ain't gonna have you break her heart.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{wish i had a brother like you.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{a girl says she loves you, you say something.}
<A>__{rudy looks at ashley. her eyes plead forgiveness.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{i had better sex in prison.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{heyyy. be nice, convict. we're gonna be working together here.}
<P>__{(to his boys)}
<D>__{get him back in the rig.}
<A>__{merlin and jumpy wrench rudy backward. ashley reaches out to him, starts to speak. he looks right through her. she goes silent, casts her eyes to the snow.}
<C>__{pug }
<D>__{he's not the guy, monster.}
<A>__{everyone looks to the truck. weasel faced pug has sidled next to gabriel. spits some chaw. it hits merlin's boots. merlin growls.}
<C>__{pug}
<D>__{whole time you were driving, he was telling her he's not the guy, he's not the guy. i know why he'd tell us he's not the guy. why's he telling her he's not the guy? what if he's not the guy?}
<A>__{gabriel considers, jumps off the truck. walks to rudy:}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{the man who wrote those letters loved ashley, boys. he lived for her love.}
<P>__{(nods)}
<D>__{let's see him live for love.}
<A>__{gabriel puts a gun under rudy's chin. rudy flinches.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{where's she work?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<P>__{(forces gun harder)}
<D>__{wrote you a hundred letters, didn't she? where's she work?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{j.c. penney. beauty and fragrances.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{what's her middle name?}
<C>__{rudy}
<P>__{(thinking hard)}

<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{be more specific.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{a station wagon in canada.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{what's her greatest fear?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{her brother.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{wrong, nick. it's drowning.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{no. it's her brother.}
<A>__{rudy stares him down. gabriel shrugs.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{that's love.}
<A>__{he puts the gun away. ashley regains her breath.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{let's get back on the road. it's time to start talking, nick. time to start telling tales }
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{nick don't talk till nick gets something.}
<A>__{gabriel gives a challenging stare. rudy stares right back. it's a showdown.}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{hot. chocolate.}
<A>__{the trucker slowly smiles. his crew chuckles.}
<C>__{merlin}
<D>__{you want that for here or to go?}
<C>__{rudy}
<D>__{i been in iron mountain for two years, truck driver. i do one more crime, i'm back there for good, so fuck you and fuck your sister and fuck your trucker friends. you want to hear about some goddamn job of mine? i want some hot goddamn chocolate.}
