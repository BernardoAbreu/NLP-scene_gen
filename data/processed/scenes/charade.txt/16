<L>__{interior funeral chapel day}
<A>__{close shot of the coffin. it rests on a low platform, with a bouquet or two of flowers near the head, the lid open. inside, the face made up to look lifelike (but failing), lie the remnants of charles lampert. close shot grandpierre the inspector sits quietly, eyes downcast, staring at his hands in a prayer like attitude. camera pulls back, revealing row after row of empty wooden bench like seats in the large, dimly lit, high ceilinged room. finally, in the first row, reggie and sylvie are discovered. besides grandpierre, they are the only ones present. reggie turns around to look at the empty room. they speak in whispers.}

<A>__{the front door of the chapel is heard opening and a shaft of daylight streams in. the women turn. med. shot chapel door the short, heavy set figure of a man is outlined against the bright outdoor light. he stands for a moment, then closes the door after him. leopold gideon, short sighted, bald, in his middle forties, glances around nervously, like a barnyard bird. then he walks down one of the side aisles of the chapel. close shot grandpierre as he watches gideon. close shot reggie as she watches him. med. shot the bier gideon arrives at the coffin. he stops, looks down at lampert's body for a moment. then, suddenly, in rapid succession, he sneezes six times. he takes a small bottle from his pocket, shakes a pill from it and swallows it dry. he turns and walks back up the aisle, looking for a place to sit. he comes face to face with grandpierre, stops, turns to sit somewhere else. two shot reggie and sylvie}
<C>__{sylvie}
<D>__{do you know him?}

<D>__{he's allergic to him.}
<A>__{sylvie turns and glances at gideon. again, the sound of the door opening interrupts them. they turn to look. med. shot chapel door again the figure of a man is outlined in silhouette against the outside brightness. when he closes the door we can see "tex" penthollow, a slim, rangy man with sandy colored hair, a weatherbeaten face, washed out blue eyes also in his forties. he wears a velvet corduroy suit, string tie and a bright yellow flower in his lapel. a bulldurham tag hangs from his outside breast pocket, dangling from its string. he starts down the aisle toward the bier, camera leading him, and we notice his unsteady gait. he turns to look at the others present. traveling shot tex's p.o.v. moving down the aisle. grandpierre's face, then gideon's, then reggie's and sylvie's all staring at camera. med. shot the bier as tex arrives. he stands staring at lampert's body, swaying on his feet until he reaches out and grabs the side of the coffin to steady himself. then he takes the flower from his lapel and throws it into the open box. close shot tex}

<A>__{but tex has nodded his head and moved off to find a seat. when he spots gideon, the two men stare at each other. finally, tex chooses a seat away from him and sits. med. shot chapel door it flies open, this time with a bang, and the large man who appears almost fills the frame. closer shot tex as the loud noise awakens him with a snort, mid snore. med. shot the door closing the door, we see herman scobie, a heavy weight tall and wide, but not fat with black hair combed straight back and heavy bushy eyebrows of a matching color, which meet over his nose and join up. about the same age as the first two men, scobie is dressed in a battered raincoat, his hands thrust deep in the pockets. he marches down the aisle. looking straight ahead, camera panning with him. he stops before the coffin and stares into it. close shot scobie as he stares down into the coffin, his tongue trying to dislodge a bit of food caught in his teeth. he stares hard at the body, squinting his eyes. then he removes one hand from his pocket, removes a pin from the inside of his lapel, picks his teeth with it, then slowly lets the hand down, into the coffin. close shot scobie's hand the pin held between thumb and forefinger, he jabs it slowly but positively deep into the back of one of the dead man's hands. there is no reaction. close shot scobie he watches the dead man carefully, still squinting. then finally satisfied, he returns the pin to his lapel and walks back up the aisle and out of the door, slamming it after him. close shot reggie having watched scobie exit. suddenly a hand falls on her shoulder. she jumps in alarm and utters a little cry of fright.}
