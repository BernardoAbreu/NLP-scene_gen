<L>__{interior anubis' chamber day}
<A>__{several fear filled, sweaty faced diggers reach into the secret compartment. henderson and burns hold guns on them. daniels has his arm in a sling. the diggers slowly pull out the ornate chest. they set the chest down on the sandy floor. beni watches as the egyptologist translates the hieratics.}
<C>__{egyptologist}
<D>__{there is a curse upon this chest.}
<C>__{daniels}
<D>__{curse my ass.}
<C>__{henderson}
<D>__{yeah, who cares.}
<A>__{the egyptologist gives them the evil eye}
<C>__{egyptologist}
<D>__{in these hallowed grounds, that which was set forth in ancient times, is as strong today, as it was then.}
<C>__{henderson}
<D>__{yeah, yeah, okay, what's it }
<A>__{the egyptologist slowly and carefully reads the inscription:}
<C>__{egyptologist}
<D>__{"death will come on swift wings to whomever opens this chest".}
<A>__{a gust of wind blows through the chamber. torches flicker all the diggers suddenly turn tail and run off screaming. the americans look at each other, suddenly very nervous.}
<C>__{egyptologist}
<D>__{it says, there is one, the undead, who if brought back to life, is bound by sacred law to consummate this curse.}
<C>__{henderson}
<D>__{yeah, well, let's just make sure we don't bring anybody back from the dead then, huh?}
<A>__{the three americans laugh.}
<C>__{egyptologist}
<D>__{he will kill all who open this chest,... and assimilate their organs and fluids.}
<C>__{daniels}
<D>__{assimilate their organs and fluids? ya mean eat 'em?}
<C>__{egyptologist}
<D>__{and in so doing he will regenerate. and no longer be the undead, but a plague upon this earth.}
<A>__{the wind whistles. torches flicker. very spooky. beni and the egyptologist share a fear filled look. henderson just shrugs.}
<C>__{henderson}
<D>__{ah hell, let's open it anyways.}
