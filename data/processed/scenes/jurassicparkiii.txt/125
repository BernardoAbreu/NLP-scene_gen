<D>__{they're not following.}
<A>__{in back, paul and eric get the ladder mechanism to begin to retract. it reels grant in faster. it also reels in the pteranodon, which may be caught, but is still plenty dangerous. as grant reaches the cabin, they shut off the ladder engine. the pteranodon is still working its way free, pulling itself closer and closer.}

<D>__{we have to cut it! find something sharp!}
<A>__{everyone checking the cabin for a knife, anything sharp. finally, eric hands grant the raptor claw. grant uses it to rip the line. the fibers break and fray, but the pteranodon keeps coming closer. paul throws a wrench at the pteranodon, whacking it straight in the head. it felt good, and damn if it didn't slow it down a little. grant has cut through the cord. he started on the second when the pteranodon snaps at him, going for his hand. there's nowhere for grant to cut without the pteranodon getting him. and idea, grant very deliberately places in his hand on the line, pulling away at the last moment. the pteranodon itself bites through the line.}
