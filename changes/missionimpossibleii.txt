Ethan into shot.  Despite the spectacularly precarious handholds he's using to hang onto the mountain and his life, he appears relaxed, engaged - for him - in the equivalent of busman's holiday.  It's leisurely danger for Ethan; one might almost expect to hear Julie Andrews trilling 'Climb Every Mountain' on the soundtrack. Then a rock he's been grasping crumbles and Ethan drops about six inches before he grabs onto the mountain again.  As he hangs by five fingers thousands of feet above the earth he doesn't seem terribly concerned until he spots a helicopter. It's materialized behind the summit and passes surprisingly close just overhead, casting its shadow downward over Ethan.

A HAIRY OVERHANG (EXT. MOUNTAIN - DAY) near the summit Ethan departing from the vertical and is now traversing the mountain with more of his back than his feet exposed to the earth far below.

<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Not sure.  Some sort of vacation.  I'll let you know where I'm going.}

<DIAL>__{Oh, you don't have to do that. Wouldn't be a vacation if you did.}
<ACTION>__{Ethan and Swanbeck exchange one final, knowing glance.}

<DIAL>__{This incident in the wake of rumors suddenly surfacing about Mr. McCloy and Biocyte's financial difficulties -- including criminal allegations of insider trading, embezzlement, conspiracy to commit fraud, and stock parking -- have, understandably, sent stock prices of the pharmaceutical company plummeting.}

<ACTION>__{Ethan emerges to a very crowded street.  Billy and Luther are waiting.  Both look to Ethan.}
<CHAR>__{LUTHER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(worried)}
<DIAL>__{So what did he say?}
<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{BILLY} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Right.  Just remember, mates.  Billy Baird's the name.  Anything you need to get, move or watch, I'm your man.}
<ACTION>__{And Billy's gone.  Ethan and Luther remain alone, both reluctant to say anything, both reluctant to leave. One quick bear hug, then:}
<CHAR>__{LUTHER} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Always nice hearing from you man.  Stay in touch..}

<CHAR>__{ETHAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Let's get lost.}
<ACTION>__{And in a moment they've vanished from the frame and into the crowd.
