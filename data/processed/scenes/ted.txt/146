<D>__{go away.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{johnny, open the door, please. i wanna talk.}
<A>__{john ignores him. a few beats go by, then the window slides open from the outside, and ted tumbles in, landing on the floor, soaked.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{jesus }
<A>__{ted shakes the water off himself like a dog. john flinches back, trying not to get wet.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{jesus christ!}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{sorry. look, johnny, i know you're pissed, but just listen to me for five seconds. i saw lori out on a date with rex.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i'm serious, john, i went over to your house to talk to lori to try and take some of the heat off you, and i saw rex picking her up. they were going to the hatch shell.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you're un fucking believable, you know that? how stupid do you think i am? first of all, lori would never go out with rex, and second of all, if you think that by making shit like that up you're gonna make me choose some kind of loyalty to you over her }
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{johnny, it's the truth. i'm tellin' ya }
<C>__{john}
<D>__{get outta here.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(beat)}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{what? i'm acting like a cock?}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{`member that porno we saw with the guy with the v shaped cock forget it. what i'm sayin' is that you're blamin' me for somethin' you did to yourself.}
<A>__{john glares at him.}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{lori was right about you. you can't take responsibility for anything that goes on in your life.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oh, and you can?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i don't have to, i'm a fuckin' teddy bear! y'know somethin', i didn't tie you up and drag you to that party. i wanted you to come because you're supposedly my best friend.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oh, yeah? is that why you've manipulated me for years to stay eternally eight years old at the expense of the rest of my life?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{whoa whoa, it's not my fault you didn't care enough about your relationship.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you can't stand there and tell me you haven't always seen lori as a threat to our friendship! it works out so much better for you when you and i are getting fucked up on the couch at 9 am, doesn't it?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{wow. listen to yourself. what am i, emperor ming here, controllin' your mind? that's your choice, john! and you know, by blamin' me, you just make yourself look like a pussy.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you know... sometimes i think back to that christmas morning when i was eight years old... and i wish i'd just gotten a teddy ruxpin.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{say that one more time.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{teddy... rux fucking pin.}
<A>__{ted stares at him for a beat, then lunges at him, wrapping his whole body around john's face and head, like the facehuggers from "aliens." john stumbles around the room, trying to pry ted off. eventually, he stumbles into the bathroom, and crashes through the shower door, shattering it. he and ted exchange punches to the face. john lands a particularly hard one, which sends ted flying across the room, and slamming into the wall. ted hits the floor, and runs out of the bathroom. john stumbles to his feet. ted scrambles across the bed, reaches into the bedside drawer, and pulls out a bible. john staggers out of the bathroom, just in time to be pelted in the head as ted throws the bible at him.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{aaaaaa!!! fucking jesus fucking christ! god fucking dammit!!!}
<A>__{ted throws other objects at him, including beer cans and the phone. john and ted stare at each other for a beat, each one breathing heavily (ted is now on the floor). john charges at ted, sailing across the bed, and tackling him, knocking over the side table and lamp in the process. john and ted scuffle on the floor, engaging in a realistic as possible fistfight. each one gets a number of blows in. john throws ted off him, and back onto the bed. ted taunts him.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{c'mon, motherfucker!}
<A>__{john jumps at ted, throwing a jab at him. but ted dodges, and john's fist goes into the wall above the headboard. he struggles to pull free as he flails about with his other hand, grabbing at ted. ted dodges again, and scrambles up john's head, jumping up and grabbing the chain on the ceiling fan, turning it on, and causing ted to swing back and forth. john pulls free, and stumbles backward off the bed. he notices a tall, free standing lamp in the corner. he pulls the plug out of the wall, and uses the lamp to take a swing at ted. ted swings out of the way. john takes a second swing, but the lamp cord catches on the fan's motor. the lamp is ripped from john's grasp, it swings around through the air, and cracks him in the side of the head. john goes down, whacking his head a second time on the baseboard of the bed. he howls in pain as he lies on his stomach, clutching his head. ted takes advantage of this. he jumps down from the cord, and pulls the antenna off the clock radio next to the bed. he jumps down to the floor, yanks john's pants partway down, and starts whipping his bare ass with the antenna. john yells in fury, and kicks blindly at ted. he turns over, kicking ted in the face, and kicking the cabinet that the tv is on. the tv wobbles, and falls off the cabinet, landing with a crash, right on his groin. john lies there, with the tv on his crotch and his pants down, and breathes heavily. ted, still dazed from the kick to the face, crawls over to him. both breathe heavily. john's breathing deteriorates into sobs.}
<C>__{ted }
<P>__{(breathing heavily)}
<D>__{why...why are you crying?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{my dick is in the tv.}
<A>__{john continues to sob. ted climbs down off the table and up onto the bed. he pushes the tv off john, then lies down next to him. ted starts to sob himself.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i'm so sorry, johnny. i'm so sorry.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{so am i, man.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i love you.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i love you, too.}
<A>__{john hugs ted, who hugs him back.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{listen... you gotta let me help you make things right with you and lori.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{there is no putting things right. she hates me.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{no, john, we can get her back. look, remember when you were ten, and you hit that squirrel with your bb gun, and then when we saw it fall from the tree we both starting crying? remember? and then we ran up to it and tried to give it cpr? and it came back to life? john, we could do that again.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{ted, we crushed its rib cage and blew out its lungs trying to give it cpr. it died.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(long beat)}
<D>__{we can get lori back.}
