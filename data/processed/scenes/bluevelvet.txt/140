<L>__{91. interior dorothy's apartment night}
<A>__{jeffrey's face. he sees dorothy in a towel come toward him again. he quickly moves back into the closet as far as he can. she opens the door, reaches in and gets a blue velvet robe. she doesn't see jeffrey even though he isn't well hidden. she closes the door. it clicks shut. jeffrey is in almost total darkness. he listens. he can hear walking around, then silence. he hears the kitchen sink water running. he hears her walking again. now he can see her. she sits down on her bed. she looks up. just as jeffrey shifts his weight. she looks at the closet strangely, but then calmly picks up a book and thumbs through it. she slowly gets up. jeffrey doesn't know what is up. he looks but she walks out of view. suddenly, he hears a drawer open, and just as suddenly, the closet door flies open, and there she is with a pistol pointed right at him. when she realizes that someone is really there, she screams once, very loud.}

<D>__{what do you want?}
<A>__{dorothy is getting very dreamy and begins to talk in a childlike voice. she opens her robe and pulls jeffrey to her breasts.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{don't move. don't look at me.}

<C>__{dorothy}
<P>__{(whispers, frantic)}
<D>__{shut up. hurry! go in the closet. don't say anything or you'll get killed. i mean it.}
<A>__{knocking is heard louder at the door. jeffrey picks up all his clothes and gets in the closet. he's naked and hiding in the closet. dorothy closes her robe and glides to the front door. jeffrey sees frank come in. frank is medium height and stocky with a burr hair cut. he is wearing a tight blue t shirt and an old black sports jacket. he's got on a pair of blue jeans and boots. he has a raw, mean sexuality a "bomb about to go off" presence. he comes into the room slowly, always looking at dorothy. he sits on the couch.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{hello, baby.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(annoyed, condescending)}
<D>__{shut up. it's daddy. shithead.}

<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(can't you remember anything attitude)}
<D>__{. my bourbon.}
<A>__{dorothy goes into the kitchen to get frank his drink. as she passes the closet, jeffrey can see the fear in her face. she returns with a small glass of bourbon and hands it to frank. frank sips on it.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{. sit down. get your chair.}
<A>__{dorothy brings a small chair over from the wall and sits down. she adjusts her robe.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(studying her)}
<D>__{. spread your legs.}
<A>__{dorothy slowly spreads her legs. she can see jeffrey staring out of the darkness of the closet at her.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{wider.}
<A>__{she opens her legs wider. frank looks at her crotch and drinks his bourbon. he stares at the floor for a moment, then slowly looks back at dorothy, her body her crotch. dorothy looks up at the ceiling, waiting. frank suddenly reaches to his belt, where he has a small canister and a mask. he opens a valve on the canister and places the mask over his nose and mouth. the canister is filled with helium, which makes frank's voice very high and strange sounding. the result is frightening.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(high voice)}
<D>__{. mommy.}
<A>__{dorothy jumps. she keeps looking at the ceiling.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(continuing, with high voice)}

<D>__{. mommy's here.}

<P>__{(high voice)}
<D>__{baby wants to fuck.}
<A>__{then, frank's voice goes to normal.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(normal voice, but loud like an army order to himself)}
<D>__{get ready to fuck!}
<A>__{frank goes to dorothy and kneels down in front of her. he takes one more gasp of helium.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(high voice)}
<D>__{baby wants blue velvet.}
<A>__{dorothy opens her robe and gives a part of the robe to frank.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{frank slowly moves frank slowly moves his mouth to the robe and runs his lips along the texture of the velvet. his hands rub the velvet and feel dorothy's body underneath. his hands start feeling her breasts as he sucks and bites the velvet robe. dorothy is very frightened but she is getting hot in spite of her fear. then frank, in a sort of sickening way, pulls dorothy down to rug. he warns her.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{don't look at me!}
<A>__{he begins stuffing part of the robe into her mouth. then, he pushes her arms back and she keeps them back, letting frank have his way. frank sucks and bites the velvet coming out of her mouth, while he pinches and feels her breasts in a strange, compulsive, timidly sickening way. dorothy is moaning. frank is breathing very heavily. he feels her crotch.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{don't look at me!!!}
<P>__{(heavy breathing)}
<D>__{daddy's home.}
<A>__{he starts stuffing the robe in his mouth now and he gets on top of dorothy. he starts humping her and pulling her nude body up and down him. faster and faster, then he has a climax in his pants. dorothy's head is falling back. she can see jeffrey blurred in the distance in the closet. cautiously, she looks sideways at frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{don't look at me!!!}
<A>__{he slugs her in the face. his nose is running and he's stifling sobs from deep within him. on his hands and knees, he moves away. the robe pulls out of his mouth. his breathing is even heavier now. he stands and begins to move around the apartment. he goes to a wall, turns off the lights, then turns and walks into the bathroom, all the while breathing big, heavy breaths, trying to stop the crying. dorothy moans softly. it gets very quiet and still for a moment. then, jeffrey hears frank with his high helium voice talking to himself in the bathroom. the high, strange sound reverberates in the distance. jeffrey can't make it out soon, he hears frank's high laughing. frank comes back into the living room. the mask is around his face. all his breathing every sound is high . he laughs a little and crosses the darkened room to the door.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{stay alive baby. see you next christmas!}
<A>__{frank leaves and shuts the door. the apartment is silent except for dorothy's moans. jeffrey is stunned. he doesn't move. he watches dorothy in the half light. she rolls over and starts crying. the crying is deep and genuine. slowly, jeffrey emerges from the closet and goes to her. he bends down and touches her. she flinches and turns to see him. she turns back sobbing. he tries to get her up.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{why don't you come lie down. come on, i will help you.}
<A>__{she struggles up with jeffrey's help and he takes her over to the bed. she falls down on her side, turned toward the wall. he covers her with the sheet.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{don't.}
<P>__{(referring to the sheet)}
<D>__{i don't like that. what do you want?}
<C>__{jeffrey}

<C>__{dorothy}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{thank you. honey.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{it's okay. it's okay.}
<A>__{they lie together for a long silent moment.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{do you like the way i feel?}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<P>__{(hesitates)}

<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{you can hit me, if you want to.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{no. please. i won't.}
<A>__{dorothy arches back and whining she throws her head back hard against the wall.}
<C>__{jeffrey}
<D>__{stop it!}
<A>__{she moves and won't let him feel her anymore. she holds his hands away.}
