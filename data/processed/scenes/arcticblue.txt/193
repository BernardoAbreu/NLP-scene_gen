<L>__{interior rental cabin}
<A>__{the ten by ten cabin is furnished with two sagging cots, a beat up color tv set, a cookstove and a half drum heat stove. built into the rear wall is a rustic dumb waiter that once lowered perishables into the icy waters of a now dry stream. eric checks his watch. 6:15 am. he bolts the door and blocks the windows, opening one enough to let sound in from outside. he extinguishes the benman lantern and douses the fire in the heat stove so no smoke will emit from the chimney. anne marie slumps into the corner next to the dumb waiter.}

<A>__{anne marie reluctantly takes the huge gun. trying to allay her fears, eric sits and brushes the hair from her face. corbett intently watches them. before he can say anything, eric shoots him a cold look. corbett stays quiet.}
