<L>__{interior under the underground night}
<A>__{series of shots (maybe all cross faded) of kids dancing and drinking in the club to establish the passing of time and to highlight the tension of the scene in jp's room by its proximity to this (relative) normality.}
<L>__{interior jp's private room night (minutes later)}
<A>__{jp lounges against his wall, smoking, close to the pillar. terri is sitting on the bed. she's upset. she's been telling jp about joey and the phone message.}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{that's terrible. what a bitch. she was obviously just using you, terri. ready to dump you the second she had what she needed, interfering little whore.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{no. it isn't ... she wouldn't ... it's like i must have done something wrong, you know? freaked her out. just fucked up something good again.}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{hey, you didn't fuck it up with me. you know that. it was my fault, babe, it really was. and you know i'm sorry. and i'm sorry to see you upset now. i hate to see you in pain like this.}
<A>__{terri looks up at him, her eyes vulnerable, on the verge of tears. she really wants to believe that he's being a nice guy.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{yes! god, yes. i ... i just want to hug you. to hold you. to tell you it's alright.}
<A>__{god, the bastard's good at this. terri breaks into small sobs and holds her arms out for him.}
<C>__{jp}
<D>__{no. no, sweetheart, you come to me. it's not fair. i come over there. you know. we're on the bed. i just ... 'cos you know how much you excite me. god, just looking at you. you're so beautiful. i come over there and i'd just want to touch you. feel you. kiss you. and that isn't what this is about. c'mon, babe, come to daddy. let me make it better.}
<A>__{terri wipes her eyes, gives a small shy smile and stands up. she's walking toward jp. and the pillar. jp puts a hand out. he smiles. re assuring. loving. terri walks. vulnerable. so in need of reassurance and love. wider angle jp, terri, pillar she's getting closer ... closer ... closer ...}
<B>__{close angle on jp}
<A>__{ as he blows it. a sidelong glance at the pillar? a sudden naked hunger in the smiling eyes? a single bead of sweat? some tiny little thing that takes the lid off his game. terri stops dead. she doesn't know what's happening but suddenly this doesn't feel right.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{no ... wait a ...}
<A>__{everything erupts! jp, smiling mask wiped off, leaps at terri. terri flings herself backward, screaming in shock and fear. pinhead: suddenly animate and furious; eyes wide open, face contorted in frustrated rage, black arms clawing at the air.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{bring her to me, boy!}
<A>__{a furious, confused scene of tension and struggle. jp has hold of terri, trying to drag her to the monster. terri fights back, screaming her disbelief and struggling and kicking against him. they are perilously close to the pillar. pinhead is furious roaring, tearing at the pillar with his hands as if trying to physically rip himself. free of it. slowly, jp's size and strength is telling; terri is being dragged nearer and nearer to the demon. at the last possible second when it seems it's all over, when pinhead's snatching fingers are centimeters from terri's flesh terri snatches up a heavy ornament from a shelf by the pillar and smashes jp right across the head with it. jp collapses semi conscious at the foot of the pillar. terri throws herself back from the monster's grabbing arms. pinhead snarls in frustration, hands clenched in fists of rage.}
<B>__{wider angle}
<A>__{terri safely feet away from the pillar stands, shaking and breathless, eyes wide in horror and shock as she stares at this creature from nightmare. and suddenly pinhead changes tack; he slides from the roaring beast of a moment before to his more usual persona the glib, articulate black pope of hell.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{wait! why run? where to? do you know where you are?}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{i'm ... i'm ...}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{you're at the door of dreams. and you can open it.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{there are two keys in this room. on is in the pocket of this fool. you could take it out without me reaching you. (a beat) probably. and you could use it to let yourself back in to the world you know. the world you've always known; banal, hopeless, dreamless.}
<A>__{pinhead, as ever, is hitting the right buttons. terri, as we know, has dreamed of dreaming.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{and ... like ... the other?}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{the other is the key to dreams. to a world of black miracles and dark wonder. another life of unknown pleasures. it's yours. complete the pattern. solve the puzzle. turn the key.}
<B>__{angle on terri}
<A>__{ as she looks at the monster. and smiles.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{where is it?}
<A>__{pinhead returns the smile.}
<C>__{pinhead}
<D>__{it's lying bleeding at your feet.}
<A>__{jp is on the floor, semi conscious, bleeding from the head.}
<C>__{jp}
<P>__{(delerious. ad lib)}
<D>__{unhhh ... terri ... what ... no ...}
<A>__{terri edges around the pillar to grasp one of jp's limp arms.}
