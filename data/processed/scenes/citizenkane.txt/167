<C>__{kane}
<D>__{there's only one person in the world to decide what i'm going to do and that's me. and if you think if any of you think }
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{you decided what you were going to do, charles some time ago.}
<P>__{(she looks at susan)}
<D>__{you can't always have it your own way, regardless of anything else that may have happened.}

<C>__{kane}
<D>__{go on! get out! i can fight this thing all alone!}
<C>__{rogers}
<D>__{you're making a bigger fool of yourself than i thought you would, mr. kane. you're licked. why don't you }
<C>__{kane}
<P>__{(turning on him)}
<D>__{get out! i've got nothing to talk to you about. if you want to see me, have the warden write me a letter.}
<C>__{rogers}
<D>__{i see!}
<P>__{(he starts toward the door)}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(starting to cry)}
<D>__{charlie, you're just excited. you don't realize }
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{i know exactly what i'm doing.}
<P>__{(he is screaming)}
<D>__{get out!}
<C>__{emily}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{charles, if you don't listen to reason, it may be too late }
<C>__{kane}
<D>__{too late for what? too late for you and this }

<A>__{she walks out. rogers stops as he gets directly in front of kane.}
<C>__{rogers}
<D>__{you're the greatest fool i've ever known, kane. if it was anybody else, i'd say what's going to happen to you would be a lesson to you. only you're going to need more than one lesson. and you're going to get more than one lesson.}
