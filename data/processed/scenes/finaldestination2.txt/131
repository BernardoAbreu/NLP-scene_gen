<T>__{slow dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior park day}
<A>__{we are at a summer barbecue. frisbee, lawn darts, croquet, et. everyone's happy. title card: five months later}
<B>__{angle on}
<A>__{shish kabob entering a mouth.}
<B>__{reveal}
<A>__{kimberly taking a bite, relishing the taste and calmly pulling the metal skewer from her mouth.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{my god, this is delicious. i can't believe i used to be a vegan.}
<A>__{thomas, out of uniform, takes a bite of his own. as the metal skewer is deep in his mouth a running frisbee player accidentally bumps into thomas! but no harm. thomas gives the guy a friendly pat and goes back to rewrapping his mouth around the shish kabob.}
<C>__{mr. burroughs }
<D>__{so what's the deal, thomas? three months and you still haven't asked my daughter out on a date.}
<A>__{kimberly turns red as mr. burroughs appears and takes a seat.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{what's wrong with a platonic relationship?}
<C>__{mr. gibbons}
<D>__{platonic my ass. that's for ugly women.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{for god's sake, leave him alone, dad.}
<C>__{thomas}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{yeah, don't make me cite you for harassment.}
<C>__{mr. gibbons}
<D>__{oh please. i'm not hurting anyone.}
<P>__{(looking around, lowering voice)}
<D>__{besides, if you can beat death, what's he got to worry about me for?}
<A>__{mr. gibbons sits down at the table with two plates of food. his wife, mrs. gibbons, joins.}
<C>__{mr. gibbons}
<D>__{you know, you still never explained to us how you did it.}
<A>__{it seems by now everyone's familiar with the concept.}
<C>__{thomas}
<D>__{well, technically when we died, we gave death what it wanted. and by the time we were revived, it had already moved on to graver pastures.}
<A>__{mrs. gibbons makes a face, finding the discourse distasteful. she changes the conversation.}
<C>__{mrs. gibbons}
<D>__{you know, i'm having the greatest day?}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{food's great too, mrs. gibbons. big props to you and brian.}
<C>__{mrs. gibbons}
<D>__{our...pleasure. so, ready for the back to school season? nyu, right?}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{three short glorious weeks away.}
<C>__{mrs. gibbons}
<D>__{sounds wonderful. i wish i were going myself.}
<C>__{mr. gibbons}
<P>__{(to mr. burroughs)}
<D>__{you may want to think twice about letting her live in the village, bob. our eldest daughter moved there and came back with piercings all over her face.}
<P>__{(looks grave)}
<D>__{among other places.}
<A>__{a chorus of friendly laughter.}
<C>__{brian }
<D>__{dad used to call her the pincushion. from hellraiser.}
<A>__{brian enters frame, soaking up fresh laughter. he holds a plate full of raw chicken fillets and some long, wooden matches.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{dad, you had the spatula last, right?}
<C>__{mr. gibbons}
<D>__{sure, here.}
<A>__{mr. gibbons hands it over and brian saunters away from camera, slightly out of focus, toward the barbecue, his body framed between kimberly and thomas' heads.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{brian looks like he's having fun.}
<C>__{mr. gibbons}
<D>__{sure does. owes it to that friend of yours, in a way.}
<A>__{mr. gibbons immediately regrets having said that.}
<C>__{kimberly}
<D>__{how's that?}
<C>__{mr. gibbons}
<D>__{well, brian was nearly hit by an ambulance the day...but your friend rory pulled him back at the last second.}
<A>__{kimberly and thomas ominously turn their heads around. in the bg, brian fidgets in front of the barbecue.}
<C>__{mrs. gibbons}
<D>__{you never told me that, peter. boy, that was lucky.}
<A>__{boom!!! the propane tank blows brian to smithereens. a deafening silence follows, punctuated when brian's arm lands on mrs. gibbons' plate. plop.}
