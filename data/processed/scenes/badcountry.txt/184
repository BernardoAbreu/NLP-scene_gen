<A>__{a metal door rises up. jesse, in silhouette, steps in. a bare bulb comes to light. mottled with fly excrement. jesse unlocks and opens several samsonite suitcases. stacked in grey packing foam are rows and rows of guns. jesse hefts his choices. checking line and breach: a 12 gauge shotgun. a colt .357 magnum. a remington sawed off with pistol grip. les baer tactical .45. glock semi auto 9mm. buck knife. duct tape. 5 gallon gas cans. he loads up a gym bag. jesse pulls scissors from a grooming kit and stands before a grimy mirror. he cuts off his hair. then using clippers, shaves his scalp and mustache. jesse yanks a tarp off a '75 beat up chrysler. pops the trunk. throws in the gym bag. then drives away.}
