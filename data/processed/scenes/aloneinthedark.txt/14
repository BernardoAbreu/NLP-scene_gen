<A>__{the two taxis drive through traffic. pinkerton's taxi lags a few cars back, but matches carnby's taxi move for move.}
<L>__{interior carnby's taxi 13c}
<A>__{the cabbie (late 20s), manic bordering on crazy, steers through traffic. carnby rides in the backseat. he looks out the back windshield. a few cars back, pinkerton's taxi follows them. carnby takes a burlap sack out of his trench coat pocket. inside the sack is a stone carving of a demonic looking head. the edges are soft, worn down, the detail roughed away. but it is clearly not a human face. carnby puts the carving back in his trench coat pocket.}
