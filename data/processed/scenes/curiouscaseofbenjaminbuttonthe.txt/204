<A>__{daisy in bed...she winces with pain... her breathing becoming ragged...}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i will get the nurse...}
<A>__{she goes into the hall... daisy left to deal with the remnants of her mortality... the nurse coming into the room... caroline behind her... times her pulse.}
<C>__{the nurse}
<D>__{let's get you comfortable.}
<A>__{she raises the morphine level...straightens her covers...she stops before she leaves...motions to caroline...caroline going over to her.}
<C>__{the nurse }
<D>__{pulse rate's slowing...she's getting less oxygen...you'll notice her struggle to breathe...will you be alright?}
<A>__{caroline nods...the nurse gives her a compassionate look and leaves...caroline stands, her arms protectively across her chest, watching her mother...daisy hums the particular ragtime song that benjamin would play on the piano...she opens her eyes, as if not completely sure where she is...telling caroline...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{every morning monsieur foley leaves eggs and bread and mil,. there's a cafe across the street. people sitting and drinking and talking... i lay on my bed thinking about the rest of my life... about people... about home... until i fall asleep.}
