<L>__{interior living room night}
<A>__{lilly enters with the tray, crosses to roy, presents the glasses, speaks as he reaches for one.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{take whichever one you want.}
<A>__{he hesitates. it hadn't occurred to him lilly might try to poison him or knock him out. he grins at her and takes a glass.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{you wouldn't do that.}
<A>__{lilly takes the other glass, puts the cookie sheet on a table, looks down at roy.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{you don't know what i'd do, roy. you have no idea. to live.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(easy)}
<D>__{oh, you'll live, lilly.}
<A>__{lilly crosses back to the sofa, sits beside the attache case, pats it absently as though it is a pet and she's glad it didn't move, waited for her. she sips water, puts the glass on the end table.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{i know what's bugging you, of course.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{oh? i didn't know anything was.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(twisted grin)}
<D>__{oh, really? you've got a legitimate complaint, roy, i don't deny that. i wasn't a very good mother when you were a kid.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(full laugh)}
<D>__{not very good!}
<A>__{she nods, accepting the correction.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{a bad mother. by any standards. i've thought about it, you know, from your side, since then. i know just how bad i was.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(closed against her)}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{i wonder did you ever think about it from my side.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(not worth discussing)}
<D>__{never.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{no, i guess not. it was pretty lousy of me, i guess, to be a child at the same time you were. not to stop being a child just because i had a child. i guess i was a real stinker not to be a grown up when you needed a grown up.}
<A>__{roy didn't expect to be made uncomfortable and defensive, and he resents it.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{what do you want me to do? pin a halo on you? you're doing a pretty good job of that yourself.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{and making you feel bad at the same time, huh? but that's the way i am, you know, the way i've always been. always picking on poor little roy.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{for god's sake, lilly!}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(intense)}
<D>__{i gave you your life twice. i'm asking you to give me mine once. i need the money.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(not worth discussing)}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{lilly subsides back onto the sofa. one hand rests on the attache case. with the other, she sips water, puts the glass back down. roy watches her, unmoving, expressionless. lilly frowns, not quite looking at him.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{you're getting off the grift?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{that's good. you don't really belong on this side of the fence, you know.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{i don't?}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{if you stayed a crook, do you think you'd live to be my ripe age?}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{i don't see why not.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{well, i guess i got it wrong, then. seems to me i heard about a guy just your age that got hit so hard in the guts it almost killed him.}
<A>__{roy's again unexpectedly uncomfortable. he shifts uneasily in his chair, trying to think of a response.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{well, uh...}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{sure, sure, that doesn't count. that's different.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{well, it doesn't matter, does it? i'm getting out.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(intense)}
<D>__{and that's why you've got to get rid of this money. if you keep it around, it'll just make you think how clever you are. it'll be a temptation to get back into the game.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(full laugh)}
<D>__{oh, that's it! you're stealing my money for my own good! how very motherly of you, lilly.}
<A>__{once again, lilly drops back against the sofa back. another round in the fight is over. roy watches her, patient, waiting for her to give up, seeing no other outcome. an angle on lilly, frustrated, feeling the need to move, the pressure of pursuit. her head turns back and forth, her body starts false gestures. finally, abruptly, she gets to her feet, looks at roy, looks away, picks up the attache case. cu, roy, alert. he won't let her reach the door. an angle panning with lilly as she prowls the room, pacing back and forth, the attache case swinging at her side. finally, she stops, standing the attache case on the coffee table, her hand still on its handle.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{lilly.}
<A>__{she looks at him, attentive without hope.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{if i should get out of the racket, that goes double for you. that's why you've got to change your life completely, go to some town, get a square job, live like a john yourself. if you try to do it your way, what future is in it?}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{a future. the only future i've got.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{that money wouldn't last forever. and then what? you'd be back in some other part of the rackets. another bobo justus to slap you around and burn holes in your hands. this way, you've got to go the square route. you could send me a card when you're settled, i could maybe help out sometimes...}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(bitter laugh) )}
<D>__{that's what it is, isn't it? keep me down. your turn to be in charge, have the power.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(stonewalling)}
<D>__{just trying to help, lilly.}
<A>__{she sits on the sofa again, this time leaving the attache case to stand on the coffee table. she studies roy, calculating.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{roy... what if i told you i wasn't really your mother? that we weren't related?}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(bewildered)}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{lilly leans back again, but this time her manner is different; languorous, sexy. she crosses her legs, the upper leg swinging gently. she smiles gently, encouragingly, at roy.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{you'd like that, wouldn't you? sure you would. you don't need to tell me. now, why would you like it, roy?}
<A>__{an angle on roy, understanding and not wanting to understand.}
<C>__{roy}
<P>__{(hoarse)}
<D>__{what's that all about? of course you're my mother. of course you are.}
<A>__{two shot. lilly leans forward toward roy, inviting him.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(very soft)}
<D>__{roy... roy}
<A>__{roy will not let anything complicated come to the surface.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{there's nothing more to talk about.}
<C>__{lilly}
<P>__{(very soft)}
<D>__{i have to have that money, roy. what do i have to do to get it?}
<A>__{an angle on roy, his face bruised looking, eyes scared. he will not know what's going on. he shakes his head, not trusting himself to speak. an angle on lilly, leaning forward, tension showing through the seductive manner.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{no? won't you give me the money, roy? can't i change your mind? what can i do to change your mind?}
<A>__{two shot, as lilly gets to her feet and takes a step toward him. roy's pressed back into his chair, trying to maintain a cold facade.}
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{lilly, jesus, what are you doing?}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{is there nothing i can do, roy, nothing at }
<C>__{roy}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{they both turn away at the same instant. roy turns to the side to pick up the glass of water, to break the spell and the tension. lilly turns back toward the coffee table and picks up the attache case. roy, lifting the glass to drink, turns forward again as lilly spins forward, swinging the attache case at his head with all her might. the case crashes into the glass and into his face. roy screams and topples off the chair, as the one remaining clasp on the case lets go and money goes flying, filling the air. an angle down at roy, face up, expression horrified, hands to his throat. a large triangle of glass is in his throat. blood pumps thickly, fountaining up. cu, lilly, staring down in horror. she lurches forward, but there's nothing to do. she stares around. ecu, wads of bills on the floor, getting bloody. cu, lilly, in agony, but looking down, kicking. ecu, lilly's feet kicking the bills away from the blood. two shot, as lilly drops to her knees beside roy, who's already dying. blood spurts less forcefully. his hands fall to his sides, eyes stare upward, mouth still moves slightly. lilly, shoving money away with her hands now, stares at him, willing it not to happen. he stops moving. his eyes dull. lilly clasps her arms around herself. she knows she doesn't dare scream. lips drawn back in a snarl, teeth clenched, she hisses her agony through her teeth. she hisses; she hisses; she hisses. then, slowly, she regains control. wide shot as lilly gets to her feet. she seems dazed now, like someone who's just been in a traffic accident. she blunders around the room, kicks the attache case, bends to pick it up. she studies the clasp, sees it still works, goes back to her knees. low angle, lilly in f.g., roy in b.g., as lilly repacks the money into the case, wiping the blood from some wads onto the carpet. finishing, she closes the case, then remains on her knees, bending over the case. she weeps grindingly. wide shot, entrance door in b.g. lilly's weeping subsides. she gets wearily to her feet, and leaves the room. camera holds. sound of water running in sink. sound stops. lilly reappears. she does not again look toward roy. she picks up the attache case, crosses to the door, opens it, steps across the threshold, reaches back to switch off the light. go to}
