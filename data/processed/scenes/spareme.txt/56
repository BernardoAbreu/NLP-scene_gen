<A>__{theo and sheila lie on the roof of the station wagon. "devil with the blue dress" by shorty long plays on the stereo. the rest of the party throws marshmallows at each other in the distance.}

<C>__{theo}
<D>__{i don't know. it's all i ever wanted to do.}
<C>__{sheila}
<D>__{i wanted to be a motocross champion. my folks didn't really care what i did. then junior blew a fuse and i became their last hope. most girls get ballet stuffed down their throats, i got bowling. i never understood how anyone could take it so seriously. i hope i'm not insulting you.}

<C>__{theo}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{sheila}
<D>__{oh really? nothing? my dad doesn't do anything unless there's something in it for him.}
<C>__{theo}
