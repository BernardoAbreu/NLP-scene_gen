<L>__{interior shaw's bedroom night}
<A>__{there's an awful banging at the front door. shaw lies under the bloody sheets, hands folded, staring lifelessly up at the ceiling. selina, now dressed in full catwoman regalia, slings a lightweight knapsack over her shoulders. she picks up the nearest chair, rams it through shaw's plate glass window, and clambers out onto the ledge outside. ten seconds later the cops burst in. they rush to the bedroom spot the shattered window, the inert gory mass on the bed but the real shock comes when they glance over at the wall. painted there, in blood...is a big, red, dripping bat.}
