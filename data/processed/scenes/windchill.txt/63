<L>__{exterior stranded oldsmobile roadside that moment}
<A>__{our girl emerges from the trees, having decided to give up the chase and return to the safety of the car. just as she's reaching for the door handle she gasps as a figure suddenly appears out of the darkness. it's the black stranger from earlier, shuffling and mumbling. this time he's close enough for her to make out some of the words he's muttering:}
<C>__{stranger}
<D>__{...please, officer, please don't...}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{wait!}
<A>__{determined not to let him vanish again, she takes off in pursuit, coming alongside him and keeping pace as he shuffles down the middle of the road.}
<C>__{stranger}
<D>__{...don't put me in the river...}
<A>__{suddenly she glances down, sees why he's shuffling so oddly. his ankles above his sodden dress shoes are bound with baling wire, as are his wrists.}
<C>__{girl}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{oh my god! who did this to you?!}
<C>__{stranger}
<D>__{...please, officer, just take the booze and let me go...}
<A>__{she reaches toward him. the instant her hand nears him the wind howls deafeningly. she experiences a sudden powerful jolt, almost as if she's grabbed a live wire... only instead of electric heat she feels a terrible otherwordly cold... frostbite. the jolt stuns the stranger out of his daze, and for the first time he becomes aware of her. he raises his frightened eyes to her slowly, and in doing so reveals his face. a scream builds in her throat at sight of him. the stranger's face is bloodless, bloated, swollen with rot. a sludgy gargling noise comes from his throat and his mouth moves, as if he's trying to speak. but instead of words emerging, his throat suddenly bulges. something's in there, fighting its way up his esophagus. she watches in horror as it emerges, blind and wriggling like a blood fattened leech. forcing its way out through his lips to land at his feet with a wet plop. it lies there writhing in the fresh snow. a river eel. she screams.}
