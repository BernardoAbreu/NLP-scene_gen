<C>__{curtis }
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{something catches his eye in the distance. clearing past the rig, he walks out into the adjacent field. he removes his goggles, eyes fixed on the acres of farmland that stretch for miles in front of him. in the sky overhead,}
<B>__{an enormous flock of birds roll in unison.}
<A>__{hundreds of them make up a black swarm that twists and shifts in the air. they dive bomb then ascend in intricate, geometric patterns. curtis watches, mesmerized. dewart strains a wrench against a bolt as the drill screeches in reverse.}
<C>__{dewart}
<D>__{curtis!}
<A>__{curtis acknowledges dewart but can't take his eyes off the pattern of birds. they shrink and stretch from thick clumps to long cylindrical tubes. a choreography. curtis reluctantly heads back to the rig, which is shrieking with the sound of metal on metal.}

<C>__{dewart}
<P>__{(holding his hand to his ear)}

<C>__{curtis}
<P>__{(to himself)}
