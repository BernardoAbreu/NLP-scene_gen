<D>__{you're almost there anyway.}
<A>__{and then silus' face, intense, a dark smile, his hand now gripping edgar's hand; surprise in edgar's eyes. he pulls edgar toward him with all his might, his hand clamping onto edgar's throat the power of the entwined bodies immense then edgar whipping his body, breaking silus' grip, smashing silus on the side of the head, but then only to get a kick from silus directly in the stomach that sends him smashing into several protruding pipes, ripping into his back. edgar screams.}
<L>__{int: jamestown slum, hideout, cell continuing}
<A>__{lilly. half conscious now, hanging from the pipe above her, twisting. the sound of edgar's screams makes her groan, awaken a little, dazed. then there is a loud clang. she cranes her head to see down the tunnel that leads to her cell. she catches sight of a shadow, movement in the tunnel.}
<C>__{lilly}
<D>__{silus...}
<A>__{then the figure moves into the tunnel, shuffling, the legs not completely following the brains instructions, but doing enough to propel the person forward, then a stumble. and in a shaft of light lilly can see a hand slapping at the wet wall. but it is less a hand than a claw. and the face that follows the hand; the red, reflective eyes of one of the half mad, the infected. the thing catches sight of lilly, then propels itself towards her. we see it's pov, approaching faster, faster. and lilly reaching out with her foot, to the door, struggling to hook it with her foot, trying to close it, almost catching the door handle, but her foot is so slippery and the thing is almost on her. then she stretches out with her foot, just catching the door and slams it in the face of the thing that is about to attack her. the thing on the other side of the door is now screaming wildly and the door handle is jerking down as the creature tries to activate it and lilly has her feet on it, trying desperately to keep the door shut, but her feet keep slipping. and then she realizes that the pipe from which she hangs is beginning to wobble water is now coursing from the hole in the wall, beginning to flow faster and faster. her feet slip more and more on the door. lilly tries to keep the door closed, but her feet are too slippery and the thing is pushing through the door. in the dark space only its eyes and slavering mouth are clear, hands grasping for lilly legs, scratching at them, lilly twisting, the creature's nails searching for purchase on her legs. lilly hauls herself up, wrapping her legs around the pipe she's attached to. the thing below her is groaning incoherently, reaching up, its hands grabbing at her, lilly pulling herself just out of reach, then seeing the eyes below her, wanting her. lilly tries to pull herself higher. and then she feels it. the pipe she's attached to is shifting, where it joins the wall. water is now flooding from it, the pipe jerks down, some of the old wall giving way. the creature's fingers are now able to grasp lilly's t shirt, drag at it, pull at her, screaming, the pipe grinding, water flowing and then the whole thing comes down, the pipe bursting out of the wall. lilly and the pipe falls, right on top of the creature. for a moment neither of them move, then the creature is grabbing at lilly's hair, pulling her head back. in a flash lilly pulls the pipe to which she is attached right into the face of the creature. this gives her time to stagger upright. she's still chained around the pipe; she can see the end of the pipe near the door. she begins to slide the chains back as the creature begins to rise and advance towards her. lilly desperately slides the chain along the pipe. it catches on a protrusion, while the creature advances. lilly frees it just in time, falling backwards as the creature jumps at her, lilly lifting the chain up to hold the creature back. the creature strains to get at lilly. lilly now has the chain at the creature's neck. she begins to tighten it around the creature's neck, her only hope now. the creature changes now, from frightening to pitiful as it realizes it can't breath, it's fingers desperately moving over lilly's face, almost pleading. tears form in lilly's eyes as she tightens the stranglehold; there is no anger there, just desperation, and behind that, pity. the creature breathes it's last breath then collapses onto lilly.}
<B>__{and and}
<L>__{124 int: jamestown slum, hideout, steamroom continuing}
<A>__{edgar and silus stalk each other in the steam room. edgar launches himself towards silus, but silus is now too quick. silus slams edgar sideways into a pipe, an imprint of edgar's face left on the pipe. stunned edgar releases his grip, stumbles back, silus rising now, he has him. again, silus slams edgar's head into another pipe. and now silus has edgar's throat in his fist and the look on silus' face tells edgar he will not escape. we see edgar, beginning to lose consciousness now, dying. steam now rises all around them from broken pipes. then behind silus, edgar can make something out. an old, corroded tank, steaming, with the words sterilizer on it. there are a series of long shafts connected to the sterilizer via a tube and held in position by clamps; they look like they're for sterilizing bottles. with a last effort edgar propels silus backwards onto one of the shafts, making silus grimace and clutch his back where he's been pierced, then slide to the ground. the piercing has operated some lever so that steam now also drifts from the wound on silus' back. cut to silus looking up, clutching his back with the pain of it. and now edgar above him. he removes one of the sterilizer shafts from the bracket that holds it. he clutches a lever on the side which makes viciously hot steam pulse from the end of the shaft. edgar moves slowly towards silus. we see silus, unable to rise, crawling back, until bang, he's stopped by more pipes behind him. nowhere to go. and edgar ready to pounce. he does, driving the shaft towards silus' head. silus manages to raise one hand to edgar's wrist to stop the shaft from piercing his skull. now the shaft is right in silus' face, the lightly steaming hole staring back at silus. edgar's finger moves to the lever on the side of the shaft, ready to get some steam going.}

<D>__{if i burn the skin from your face, i wonder how that would be. if you looked like a monster...}
<A>__{cut to edgar's finger moving over the steaming lever. the steaming end of the shaft right in silus' face. then edgar's face as he watches his brothers face for the last time. the blasting sound of steam and a steaming blast from the shaft drifts into our frame. cut to silus. his face is not scolded. cut back to edgar, his expression getting tighter, his face redder, the whites of his eyes becoming bloodshot. then he goes to speak, but now words come out, only a swirling puff of steam. and then he falls and we see behind him, standing there is lilly, one of the other sterilizing shafts in her hand; steam still rising from the sharp end of it. cut to edgar, prone, on the wet floor of the pipe room; steam rises from both his mouth and the back of his head.}

<A>__{lilly moves through the derelict place, past fallen beams. it seems empty. then lilly hears it again. a wail. this time she knows what it is; we can tell from the way her eyes glisten. she moves forward, closer to the sound. and finally she sees the brother priest we saw before, who kneels in front of a crate. he looks up at her as she approaches. as lilly moves forward she sees what lies with the crate. wrapped in dirty sacking, there is a baby. in the corner lilly can see a woman the child's mother dead from the infection. the baby cries and lilly can see the tiny fangs of a brother in the baby's mouth.}

<D>__{the first female of her kind. the first daughter given to us.}
<A>__{lilly moves forward. emotional music rises in the soundtrack; evoking memory, the circle completing. lilly reaches out, letting the baby girl grip her hand. lilly reaches into the crate, drawing the baby into her arms, staring down into the baby's face; a face somehow already wise, already serene. broken tears run down lilly's cheek as she presses the baby to herself, all the pain of the past flooding over her, the baby's tiny hands reaching out, clasping onto her.}
