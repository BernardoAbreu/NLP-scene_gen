<D>__{a slow motion low tracking shot of a bowling ball hitting a polished lane.}
<C>__{bowling pins}
<D>__{close up of the milky white surface of two bowling pins on opposite sides of the lane a seven ten split. the rumbling ball is heard in the distance like a furious hulking steamroller of doom. the pins begin to tremble, and then transform into a bridal ken and barbie. the dolls burst into flame.}
