<D>__{you work in the cemetery.}

<T>__{cut:}
<A>__{cemetery night ancient tombstones crumbling with age, slanting out of the ground at bizarre angles, and cluttered so close together that a way can scarcely be made between them. bizzlebek leads kafka along the crooked little pathways, overgrown with crawling weeds, upwards towards the high section of the cemetery under the dark wall of the castle. bizzlebek, who knows his way around, seems more cheerful here than we've seen him before. kafka more fearful. wind whistles. leaves rustle. creaking trees cast ghastly shadows. scary tombs, all shapes and sizes, strange symbolic symbols on them, mystical figures and designs. trying to keep up with bizzlebek, kafka spots a horrendous shape looming ahead of him. he starts to bypass it and jumps when a tall plant brushes against him.}
<C>__{bizzlebek}
<P>__{(waits for kafka)}
<D>__{are you sure you wouldn't prefer going through official channels?}
<A>__{the awful dark shape turns out to be no more than a particularly large tombstone, crumbled in places to give it an animal like suggestion.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{official channels a lot of good they've done me. my only hope is to approach the officials personally.}
<A>__{he keeps walking and we see that he's carrying the bomb briefcase he found at eduard's.}
<C>__{bizzlebek}
<D>__{ i'm flattered, of course, to be considered a friend even without knowing all the details.}
<P>__{(kafka doesn't take that cue)}
<D>__{ to see such determination is reward enough for me.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{the kafka men are famous for it, you know. delivering meat barefoot in the depths of winter, picking up sacks of flour with their teeth }
<A>__{a bird rapidly swoops down from a tree, zipping past kafka's head with a shrieking squawk!}
<C>__{kafka}
<P>__{(gulp)}
<D>__{ oh, yes, determination runs in the family.}
<C>__{bizzlebek}
<D>__{there is one thing i'd like you to tell me.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{i'm trying to find things out myself that's the whole pointerior}
<C>__{bizzlebek}
<D>__{what made you think i'd be able to get you into the castle?}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{the cemetery is nearer the castle than anywhere else wasn't it part of the castle originally? i always assumed there'd be a gate or something.}
<P>__{(stops again, concerned)}
<D>__{isn't there?}
<C>__{bizzlebek}
<D>__{in a manner of speaking.}
