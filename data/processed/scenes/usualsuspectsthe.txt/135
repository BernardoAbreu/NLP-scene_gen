<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{keaton was keyser soze}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{the kind of guy who could wrangle the wills of men like hockney and mcmanus. the kind of man who could engineer a police line up from all his years of contacts in n.y.p.d.}
<A>__{verbal stands on wobbly legs, shaking with anger.}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{no, no, no, no, no.}
<C>__{kujan}
<C>__{the kind of man that could have killed}
<C>__{edie finneran.}
<A>__{a strange look crosses verbal's face. shock perhaps, or revelation.}
<C>__{kujan }
<D>__{they found her yesterday in a hotel in pennsylvania. shot twice in the head.}
<A>__{it starts to sink in with verbal. his eyes swell.}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{edie...}
<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{he used all of you to get him on that boat. he couldn't get on alone and he had to pull the trigger himself to make sure he got his man. the one man that could identify him.}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{this is all bullshit.}
<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{he left you to stay behind and tell us he was dead. you saw him die, right? or did you? you had to hide when the first police cars showed up. you heard the shot, just before the fire but you didn't see him die.}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{i knew him. he would never }
<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{he programmed you to tell us just what he wanted you to. customs has been}
<C>__{kujan }
<D>__{investigating him for years. he knew we were close. you said it yourself. where is the political pressure coming from? why are you being protected? it's keaton making sure you tell us what you're supposed to. immunity is your reward.}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{but why me? why not hockney or fenster or mcmanus? i'm a cripple. i'm stupid. why me?}
<A>__{verbal hears the weight of his words and falls back in his chair, kujan looks at him with some pity,; but he is too far in to stop.}
<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{because you're a cripple, verbal. because you're stupid. because you were weaker than them. because you couldn't see far enough into him to know the truth.}
<A>__{verbal is crying now. he shakes his head, eyes closed.}
<C>__{kujan }
<D>__{if he's dead, verbal if what you say is true, then it won't matter. it was his idea to hit the taxi service in new york, wasn't it? tell me the truth.}
<C>__{verbal}
<P>__{(sobbing)}
<D>__{it was all keaton. we followed him from the beginning.}
<A>__{kujan smiles with triumphant satisfaction.}
<C>__{verbal }
<D>__{i didn't know. i saw him die. i believe he's dead. christ}
<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{why lie about everything else, then?}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{you know what it's like, agent kujan, to know you'll never be good? not good like you. you got good all fucked around. i mean a stand up guy. i grew up knowing i was never going to be good at anything 'cause i was a cripple. shit, i wasn't}
<C>__{verbal }
<D>__{even a good thief. but i thought the one thing i could be good at was a keeping my mouth shut keeping the code. i didn't want to tell you for my dignity, that's all, and you robbed me, agent kujan. you robbed me.}
<A>__{kujan pulls the microphone out from under his tie and puts it + on the desk. verbal actually manages to snort a laugh, but only briefly, overcome by an apparent wave of nausea.}
<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{you're not safe on your own.}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{you think he's..?}
<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{is he keyser soze i don't know, verbal. it seems to me that keyser sate is a shield. like you said, a spook story, but i know keaton and someone out there is pulling strings for you. stay here and let us protect you.}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{i'm not bait. no way. i post today.}
<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{you posted twenty minutes ago. captain leo wants you out of here a.s.a.p., unless you turn state's.}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{i'11 take my chances, thank you. it's tougher to buy the cheapest bag man than it is to buy a cop.}
<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{where are you going to go, verbal? you gonna run? turn states evidence. you might never see trial. if somebody wants to get you, you know they'll get you out there.}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{maybe so, but i'm no rat, agent kujan. you tricked me, that's all. i won't keep my mouth shut 'cause i'm scared. i'11 keep it shut 'cause i let keaton down by getting caught edie finneran too. and if they kill me, it's}
<C>__{verbal }
<D>__{because they'll hear i dropped dime. they'll probably hear it from you.}
<A>__{verbal stands, mustering his shattered dignity and walks towards the door. rabin opens it for him from outside. for once kujan cannot bring himself to look at verbal. verbal turns to the door, stopping to look rabin in the eye.}
<C>__{verbal }
<D>__{fuckin' cops.}
<A>__{he steps out of the room and into the hall. rabin follows him.}
