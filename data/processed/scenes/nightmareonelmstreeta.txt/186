<L>__{interior marge's bedroom. night.}
<A>__{nancy stops in the splintered doorway a ragged gold red light splashing her horrified face. reverse in her pov fred krueger, literally a man of fire, has a screaming marge pinned to the bed and is crawling all over her! nancy gives a banshee's howl, snatches up a chair and brings it down over the back of the firey beast, stunning him. by the time lt thompson races into the room nancy's seized a heavy blanket has thrown over both of them, fighting the flames. the father joins his daughter without a second thought, heaving another blanket over the bed and smothering the last of the flames.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{he's under there! watch it!}
<A>__{thompson pushes the girl back yanks out his .38 and pulls off the first cover. no movement. he pulls back a second one, ready to fire. but the only thing he sees is the blackened half skeleton of his ex wife, smoking and seething and sinking into the fluid like mattress, sinking right down through it as if she were sinking into a lake. a blackened, gnarled hand goes last, then the bed solidifies over the place she's disappeared. and it's as if no one was ever there. nancy turns and looks at lt thompson, her face white as her ghostly hair. thompson shoves his .38 back in its holster and finds a cigarette, his hands shaking so badly he can barely manage.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{now do you believe me?}
<A>__{parker barges in. the room is filled with smoke, the bed is stripped, but other than that, the place seems normal.}
<C>__{parker}
<D>__{you find him?}
<P>__{(looking closer at thompson)}
<D>__{sir?}
<A>__{lt thompson just walks by him. parker chases after.}
<C>__{parker }
<P>__{(fading)}
<D>__{sir here, let me light that for you lieutenant? what happened?}
<P>__{(gone)}
<A>__{wider, on nancy alone in the room. she turns and looks at the bed. music slips in and builds. the bed has changed color. it's now an ash darkened red and yellow . closer on nancy from the direction of the bed. music suddenly stops, and the surface of the red and yellow bed gets a bump in its center that keeps raising, raising until it's a hump that's a head and shoulders, still raising until it looms over nancy. then fred krueger's entire shape sweeps up into the yellow and red mass and the garish head, smoking and seething, pops through. new angle krueger, a burned, sizzling black hump of a killer, clumps onto the floor between nancy and the door. nancy falls absoltely still, and her face goes through a strange, almost sublime transformation.}
<C>__{nancy}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i know you're there, krueger.}
<A>__{she turns and faces him.}
<C>__{freddie}
<D>__{you think you was gonna get away from me?}
<A>__{nancy shakes her head.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{i know you too well now, freddie.}
<A>__{krueger smiles bitterly. coming closer.}
<C>__{freddy}
<D>__{and now you die...}
<A>__{there's a slickering rattle at his side, and he raises the only thing on him not charred the gleaming steel talons. nancy simply shakes her head again, as if seeing a light at the end of her long, long tunnel. and the way she says the words, they might be appearing on the inside of her eyes.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{it's too late, krueger. i know the secret now this is just a dream, too you're not alive the whole thing is a dream so fuck off! i want my mother and friends again.}
<A>__{krueger grins insanely, confused and amused at the same time.}
<C>__{freddie}
<D>__{you what ?}
<C>__{nancy}
<P>__{(even, firm)}
<D>__{i take back every bit of energy i ever gave you. you're nothing. you're shit.}
<A>__{and then she turns her back on him. krueger bunches his fingers, producing a single ragged bundle of razor talons and raises his hand over the back of her head and neck. nancy closes her eyes and steps to the door. close on her hand, touching the door knob. close on krueger's knife fingers poised. music builds then shrieks as krueger stabs down, right through nancy as if she were an optical illusion loosing his balance and falling down, down, down... and he's gone.}
