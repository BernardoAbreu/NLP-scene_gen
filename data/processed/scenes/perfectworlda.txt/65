<A>__{the truck and airstream barrel down the highway.}
<L>__{interior airstream day}
<A>__{the place is a functioning mobile headquarters now. adler on the short wave and tacking up a map, bobby lee still in his corner, red and sally sitting across from one another at the "kitchen table". in the rear section of the airstream red's chair and a mini office for the chief have been put together.}
<C>__{adler}
<D>__{got a spot on 'em. a store right outside of benhur. about 20 miles from here.}
<A>__{adler sets down the mike, sticks a tack on the map and stands back.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{all right. push the roadblock on 288 north by 50 miles.}
<A>__{kaiser calls in the instructions. (note: kaiser's radio transmissions are not scripted but go on a lot of the time we're in the airstream. in addition, his and adler's direc tions and missives to bradley in the truck are not all scripted.)}
<C>__{adler}
<D>__{ya' figger' they're that far along?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{hell, i dunno'and neither do they. they're jus' happy to be out. it's a high speed sunday drive to them.}
<C>__{adler}
<D>__{sunday drive. i like that. never heard you use that one before, red.}
<A>__{sally is watching red and listening to all of this with a troubled look on her face. red notices...}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{somethin' eatin' at you?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{it's... perhaps premature, but do you have an auxiliary roadblock plan for when they split up?}
<A>__{everyone stares. no one ever questions red.}
<C>__{adler}
<D>__{what makes you so sure they won't stay together?}
<A>__{sally hesitates. red notices...}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{you got somethin' to say, spit it out.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{their situation is one of accommodation. they won't be together long.}
<A>__{silence. sally continues.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{haynes and pugh are opposites. haynes is a criminal's criminal armed robbery, mano y mano confrontation. pugh, on the other hand, has a rap sheet littered with molestation and petty crime. they'll split sheets soon.}
<C>__{adler}
<P>__{(still on attack)}
<D>__{what about the hostages? they gonna' flip a coin to see who gets to keep who?}
<A>__{red rises and walks to the sink. he rinses a spoon.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{it's happened before. either way it's a dilemma they'll address soon.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{that's why we should address it now.}
<A>__{she looks to red. he refuses to return her gaze.}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{we don't have a dilemma. and neither do they. they'll keep one hostage... and get rid of one, if they haven't already.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{okay... which one?}
<C>__{red}
<D>__{if there's a snafu, who's john q. public more likely to give a rat's ass about an innocent boy or a goddam bureaucrat.}
<A>__{red wipes the water off the spoon on his shirt and walks to his office in the back. adler, bobby lee and kaiser chuckle lightly at their boss's snubbing of the female upstart in their midst. sally's face glows a bright red.}
