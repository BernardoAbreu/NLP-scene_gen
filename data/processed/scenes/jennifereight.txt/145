<L>__{144: interior garage. house. night.}
<A>__{music slams in on the cut. berlin is about to take this garage to pieces. he searches cans and boxes and stacked timber. what ever it is his eyes are looking. the camera looks down from ab ove. bits & pieces all over the floor but he discovers nothing.}
<L>__{145: interior bathroom bedroom. house. night.}
<A>__{close on a hand searching underside of the bath. pipes and cob webs. he reaches toward the taps. his hand is literally inches from the walther (taped to the end of the tub). fingers almost touch it. just a fingernail away when helena interrupts "john?"}
<C>__{helena }
<D>__{i just remembered something ..}
<A>__{and berlin rolls out and stares up like a mechanic under a car.}
<D>__{he used a breath freshener.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{a "breath freshener?"}
<A>__{helena stands in the doorway and berlin is already on his feet.}
<C>__{helena}
<D>__{i heard it hiss, twice.}
<A>__{berlin wipes a thought through his hair with fingers. "i don't know what that means." walks past into the bedroom. everything taken apart. every drawer open and the bed heaped with clothes.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{... he's either here to take something .. or leave some thing .. i don't find nothing ..}
