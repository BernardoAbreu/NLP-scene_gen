<D>__{tomorrow morning, the cable channel known as real tv, begins broadcasting one of the most heavily promoted concepts in the history of cable television. in an experiment that they say will last at least a month. they're going to follow live every waking minute of a thirty one year old video store clerk from paramus new jersey. the real tv press release on this promises that none of it will be scripted, none of it will be edited and in my opinion, none of it will be interesting. we're all just supposed to sit in front of our tv's and watch this guy... live.}
