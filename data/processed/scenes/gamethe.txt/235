<A>__{ a bustling, noisy commissary. schuyler keeps the gun concealed as he steps out of the elevator nobody here is paying any attention to him anyway. there's a cafeteria style counter along one wall, people chatting and laughing at formica tables... amongst others, everyone from his game appears to be here... there's the rasta, the paramedics with the heart attack victim, john and pete from the men's club, the girl from the boat, the desk clerk and bellhop... also the honduran truck driver, the security people from his house, the punk and the transit cop... and a lot of engineers. schuyler inches into the room, meets the eyes of christine, who's just come away from the cafeteria counter with a tray of food. she nearly drops it, looks over her shoulder to see if anyone is watching. suddenly, schuyler is in front of her, backs her into an alcove she holds the tray between them as if to protect herself.}

<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{you taste it, you fucking vampire.}
<A>__{he pushes his palm in her face, she flinches, swipes him away, then puts a finger to her ear as the elevator doors open and the guard and security man from downstairs burst into the commissary. suddenly the room quiets, many others are touching their ears. they all turn in the direction of schuyler and christine. the gate guard gestures at schuyler, attempting a smile.}
<C>__{gate guard}
<D>__{could you come with us, please? you're not authorized to be here.}
