<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior valley below cascade mountains day}
<A>__{carrying their gear, abby and the postman walk across a meadow of wild flowers, headed for an old road.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{have you ever heard of st. rose, abby?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{i've heard people talk. i've heard lots of names. bliss. hesperia. new eden. sheriff briscoe says it's a fantasy.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{he's wrong. st. rose is out there. and i'm going to find it.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{but you're the postman.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{look, i'm nobody, abby. i'm just...}
<A>__{before he can come clean they see a distant rider coming hard. the postman unslings the rifle, slides a round into the chamber.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{this is what i hate. strangers. do you say 'hi' or do you blow their head off? do they want to share what they got or take what you have? and if they want to take, how far are you willing to go to stop them? damn it.}
<P>__{(to the rider)}
<D>__{all right. that's far enough.}
<A>__{the rider pulls up short, wearing a blue home made uniform.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{we don't want any trouble.}
<C>__{rider}
<D>__{me neither, mister.}
<A>__{the postman is taken aback. the rider, a girl, pulls off her cap, mops it across her brow. maybe 14, we'll always know her by her ponytail. abby registers the uniform first.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{what are you?}
<C>__{ponytail }
<D>__{carrier 18. u.s. postal service. got any mail?}
<A>__{lowering the rifle, the postman looks over at abby, back to ponytail.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{that's impossible.}
<C>__{ponytail}
<D>__{ain't you heard of the postman?}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{no, tell us.}
<C>__{ponytail}
<D>__{he's only the greatest man who ever lived. he crossed the wasteland, shook his fist at the enemy and spit in the eye of general bethlehem himself. he's back east with president starkey right now.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{who told you all this?}
<C>__{ponytail}
<D>__{postmaster ford lincoln mercury. he's in direct contact with the restored congress.}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{direct contact... i don't believe this.}
<C>__{ponytail}
<P>__{(growing irritated)}
<D>__{do you have mail, or don't you?}
<C>__{the postman}
<D>__{you said carrier eighteen. that mean there's eighteen of you?}
<C>__{ponytail}
<D>__{thirty two. as of midnight.}
