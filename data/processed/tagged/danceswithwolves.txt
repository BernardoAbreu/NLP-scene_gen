<L>__{interior field hospital tent day}
<A>__{a black screen. the sound of a knife cutting through boot leather. fade in on the waists of two men (the surgeons) hovering around a crude operating table. in the extreme background, two stretcher bearers are just leaving.}
<C>__{surgeon 1 }
<D>__{is this the last one?}
<A>__{one of the bearers stops and looks back. his face is numb. and he nods hollowly. we cannot see the patient stretched out on the table. but we do see that the first surgeon has succeeded in getting the man's boot off.}
<C>__{surgeon 2 }
<D>__{god, what a mess... at least there's no gangrene.}
<C>__{surgeon 1 }
<D>__{there will be if it doesn't come off.}
<C>__{surgeon 2 }
<D>__{well i can't saw if i can't keep my eyes open. let's coffee up... he can wait a few more minutes.}
<A>__{as the two surgeons duck through a tent flap in the background we see a mangled foot, torn by shrapnel, it oozes blood from a cut clear to the bone. lieutenant john j. dunbar's eyes are now open. he's a young man, his features sharp and handsome. with effort, he lifts his head and searches the room. his eyes come to rest on the form of a legless man lying in bloodsoaked sheets. he's whimpering like a child. dunbar comes to a sitting position on the operating table. as his eyes move around the room they come to rest on a crate filled with the boots of men who have lost their legs. a cane travels through space and deftly hooks one of the boots. lieutenant dunbar brings the boot onto the operating table. he tries to pull it on his mangled foot, but the pain makes him cry out. deliberately he breaks the cane and sticks a piece of it between his teeth. tears of pain are rolling down his face. a sweat has broken out on his forehead and with great determination he pulls the boot on.}
<L>__{exterior field hospital tent day}
<A>__{the two weary surgeons sip on steaming mugs of coffee, their white coats spattered with blood. their brief respite is interrupted by the sound of a muffled scream. together they turn and rush back into the tent.}
<L>__{interior field hospital tent day}
<A>__{the operating table is empty save the broken cane and a small pool of blood. dunbar is gone. legend: st. david's field, tennessee 1862}
<L>__{exterior civil war hill day}
<A>__{in a natural valley below is a peaceful field. and on either side of the field, seperated by a hundred yards of green, are low rock walls. several dairy cows are lying dead in the field. a group of mounted union officers, ride onto the crest of the hill and look down at the field. the distinguished man with a long grey beard is general tide.}
<L>__{exterior confederate wall day}
<A>__{ragged confederate soldiers crouch sullenly behind one of the walls.}
<L>__{exterior union wall day}
<A>__{and just behind the other wall are union men, better equipped perhaps, but just as weary as their enemies. we hold on one man, an enlisted soldier, sergeant pepper. he chances to glance behind and squints at a strange sight. a solitary officer is standing a few feet behind him. the sun is at his back, giving him a ghostly feel. eerily he takes a step or two forward. he's limping badly. the sergeant recognizes him. it's dunbar.}
<C>__{pepper}
<D>__{lieutenant... izat you?}
<A>__{dunbar says nothing. he just stands and stares. it unnerves the sergeant.}
<C>__{pepper}
<D>__{what're you doing here lieutenant?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{this is where i belong... this is my outfit.}
<A>__{the sergeant stares at dunbar's foot.}
<C>__{pepper}
<D>__{you went to hospital?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{it was no good... what's going on here?}
<A>__{a ping of riflefire flies overhead and the sergeant dives for the wall. he calls over his shoulder.}
<C>__{pepper}
<D>__{better come to cover lieutenant... those boys are shooters.}
<A>__{dunbar settles next to the sergeant.}
<C>__{pepper}
<D>__{what's goin' on here... seems to be the question alright... you could ask the major but he don't know. he's busy tryin' to figger out how come the officer's mess run outta peach ice cream...}
<A>__{the sergeant nods at the distant hill and dunbar looks too.}
<C>__{pepper}
<D>__{general's come up to see the show but all he knows is there ain't no show...}
<A>__{now he nods toward the trees behind them and the lieutenant follows. several union men are clustered around a huge hunk of material attached to a gondola.}
<C>__{pepper}
<D>__{we started a balloon up but they shot her down fore she was ten feet off the ground... so nobody's made a run either way. it's been a stand off all damn day... and now... the major, he's lookin' at the general and he's thinkin' i better do somethin', and you know what that means...}
<A>__{more riflefire comes in and some of the union men answer with a few rounds of their own. the sergeant watches the confederate line across the field through a crack in the wall. lieutenant dunbar is not watching the enemy. he's looking at some horses picketed in the trees behind the union lines. there's a nice bay. there's a big roan.}
<C>__{pepper}
<D>__{they're 'sposed to be beat up just like us but everybody knows that tucker's men are tough as cobs. i sure don't wanna die out there with them cows.}
<A>__{dunbar is still watching the horses. he's holding on a small, well muscled buckskin standing a little apart from the others.}
<B>__{cisco.}
<A>__{now he moves away from the wall, heading for the horses. the sergeant squeezes off a shot. squinting across the field, he sees a rifle with a hat on the tip of its bayonet waving at him disrespectfully. the sergeant rolls on his side to reload. he keeps on talking to the lieutenant, but the lieutenant is gone.}
<C>__{pepper}
<D>__{some of the boys are sayin' that if we ain't gonna fight we could just settle the whole business with a little high stakes poker. wouldn't that be a sight... a bunch of fellas sittin' in the middle of this field drawin' cards...}
<A>__{the sergeant's chatter is interrupted by a sound... the sound of hoofbeats rushing in behind him. men on either side are scattering, but there's no time for the sergeant. he turns to the sound and cringes against the wall as the buckskinned belly of a horse soars over his head. dunbar and his horse hit the ground with a thud and dig for the confederate line.}
<L>__{exterior confederate line day}
<A>__{some of the confederate riflemen can see the wild rider headed for their lines. a sharpshooter (ray) calls over his shoulder.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{tucker!}
<A>__{a man in a slouch hat crowned by a jaunty feather looks up from an impromptu meeting. tucker.}
<L>__{exterior civil war hill day}
<A>__{like the others, general tide is absorbed with the spectacle of a single horseman riding into the teeth of the enemy. he holds out his hand and an aide slips a pocket telescope into his palm. the general sights through his telescope.}
<C>__{aide}
<D>__{what is it sir?}
<A>__{tide lowers the telescope, glances at the aide and peers back down at the field.}
<C>__{tide}
<D>__{looks like a suicide.}
<L>__{exterior battlefield day}
<A>__{dunbar can see the confederate riflemen now. they're rising up behind the wall to aim and fire. fifty yards from the enemy line he's still unhit. he wheels the buckskin into a sharp left turn and they streak parallel to the confederate flank. the buckskin is charging hard, his heels throwing out clumps of dirt. the firing is tremendous. the lieutenant's hat is torn away. a slug lifts off one of the officer's epaulettes, but still no bullet finds him.}
<L>__{exterior union wall day}
<A>__{the entire union line is standing, strangely quiet in their disbelief.}
<L>__{exterior battlefield day}
<A>__{the lieutenant passes the last of the riflemen and pulls the buckskin up at the far end of the field. the little horse is pitching and rearing, ready for another run. the lieutenant bows his head in exhaustion, but a sound coming across the field brings his head up quickly. a great cheer is rolling along the union line.}
<L>__{exterior hill day}
<A>__{general tide is furiously spurring his horse as he tears down the hill. his aides are trying desperately to keep up.}
<L>__{exterior confederate wall day}
<A>__{there's action along the confederate line. the men dunbar passed are desperately trying to reload. those at the end are jeering, taunting the lieutenant to take another pass. tucker is moving along the line. the battle ground has suddenly taken on a festival atmosphere and tucker doesn't like it.}
<C>__{confederate}
<D>__{come on you son of a bitch you won't make it a second time...}
<L>__{exterior battlefield day}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{alright by me.}
<A>__{dunbar gazes down along his leg. blood is pumping from his wound.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{forgive me father.}
<A>__{again he digs his heels into the buckskin's flanks and they fly down the line. the confederates are trying to reload. a few are able to get off a hasty shot, but they're all too late.}
<L>__{exterior battlefield day}
<A>__{dunbar swerves in a little closer to the wall as he approaches the other half of the confederate ranks. they're standing ready, like a firing squad. tucker has just reached the side of ray the sharpshooter. the lieutenant shuts; his eyes, lets the reins flop on the buckskin's neck and spreads his arms as they thunder toward the line of riflemen. ray's finger squeezes the trigger, his keen eye sights down the barrel of his gun. thud... a rifle ball buries itself in ray's forehead.}
<L>__{exterior battlefield day}
<A>__{the union trooper who fired the fatal shot gets up from a kneeling position and scrambles after some of his comrades.}
<L>__{exterior union wall day}
<A>__{with his aides coming behind, general tide leaps his horse over the wall at a dead run. the entire union line pours after him, screaming a thunderous battlecry in unison. pepper is one of the last to scurry over the wall.}
<L>__{exterior battlefield day}
<A>__{the union troops have the rebels in full flight, chasing them into the woods beyond the field.}
<L>__{exterior battlefield day}
<A>__{suddenly the field is quiet. there is rifle fire in the distance but otherwise everything is still. the field is almost empty. the three dead dairy cows are still there. and at one end of the field is a solitary buckskin horse. his rider lies on the ground, a foot hooked in one stirrup. the sound of men's voices is coming near. suddenly, general tide is peering down at him. dunbar stares back, glassy eyed.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{don't take off my foot.}
<A>__{general tide stares down into dunbar's blank face. he kneels next to the lieutenant and bends to whisper in his ear.}
<C>__{general tide}
<D>__{you rest easy son... you'll keep you're foot. as god is my judge, you'll keep it.}
<A>__{the general looks up at one of his aides.}
<C>__{general tide}
<D>__{bring up my ambulance...}
<C>__{aide}
<D>__{sir?}
<C>__{general tide}
<D>__{bring up my ambulance. and bring my surgeon with it. we've got an officer who's worth something lying here.}
<A>__{the aide dashes off to do what he's told, as general tide gently removes dunbar's foot from the stirrup and lays it carefully on the ground. the image fades out.}
<L>__{exterior prairie day}
<A>__{the image of a boot fades in, pull back to see that a lone rider is coming toward us. he has had a long and dusty trip. it's lieutenant dunbar. he's still riding the little buckskin. legend fort hays. kansas 1863 dunbar pulls up short. he stares thoughtfully at something in the distance.}
<C>__{dunbar }
<D>__{the strangeness of this life cannot be measured. in trying to produce my own death, i was elevated to the status of a living hero.}
<A>__{dunbar starts forward and the camera swings around to cover his back. in the distance we can see an isolated and dreary military post. the sky is very blue. the sun is bright. a rough hewn, unfenced fort is straight ahead. there are several miscellaneous stone structures, a well stocked stable, barracks, officer's quarters and in the center of it all, a headquarters building. lieutenant dunbar, riding straight and tall on his powerfully built buckskin, cisco, passes into view. he's headed for the center of the fort.}
<L>__{interior fort hays headquarters day}
<A>__{silhouetted against the outside, lieutenant dunbar pauses in the wide doorway of headquarters. we can hear the distant sounds of work and life coming from the outside but in here it's strangely quiet. a sergeant sits at a desk in the foyer. across the way, at another desk, is an enlisted clerk. both men glance from their paperwork at the man in the doorway. but it's only a glance and they go right on shuffling paper. footfalls sound in a hallway and a blue eyed officer with slick, black hair swings into the foyer. he too has a slackness that echoes the dreariness of this post. the blue eyed officer, lieutenant elgin, and dunbar meet at the doorway. dunbar glances down at a scrap of paper in his hand.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{where can i find major... fambrough?}
<C>__{elgin}
<D>__{turn right... all the way to the end of the hall.}
<A>__{being roughly the same age and rank these two might idle awhile, but dunbar is eager. he's already moving.}
<C>__{fambrough }
<D>__{lt. john j. dunbar.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{sir?}
<A>__{dunbar stops and turns, peering down the hallway. no one is there.}
<L>__{interior fambrough's office day}
<A>__{sitting behind the desk, holding a set of orders is major}
<B>__{fambrough.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{lt. john j. dunbar.}
<A>__{lt. dunbar is standing in front of the desk.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{yes sir?}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{indian fighter, huh?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{fambrough}
<P>__{(indicating paper)}
<D>__{your orders say you are to be posted on the frontier. the frontier is indian country. i quickly deduced that you are an indian fighter.}
<A>__{he arches an eyebrow, challenging the lieutenant. he has sad swollen eyes. he is an army lifer passed over too many times for promotion and right now does not look like a well man.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{i did not ascend to this position by being stupid.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{no sir.}
<A>__{fambrough returns to the order. dunbar watches him in silence. the major's tunic is covered with food stains. sweat has broken out all over his head. his grooming is awful. his hands are trembling slightly. something is very wrong with him. now the major sees something on the official paper. he looks quickly at the lieutenant, then back at the paper, moving his lips but making no sound.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{it says here you've been decorated.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{and they sent you out here to be posted?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{actually sir, i'm here at my own request... i want to see the frontier.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{you want to see the frontier?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{yes sir... before it's gone.}
<A>__{the major fixes dunbar with a sly look.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{such a smart lad coming straight to me.}
<A>__{still sly, fambrough digs into a side drawer. there is the distinct clink of glass on glass as he rummages. now fambrough has what he wants, a blank official form. he begins to fill it out, writing in a disturbingly childish way.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{sir knight, i am sending you on a knight's errand. you will report to captain cargill at the furthermost outpost of the realm... fort sedgewick.}
<A>__{he looks over his work with a schoolboy's excitement and affixes his signature with a wild flourish.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{my personal seal will assure you safe passage through many miles of wild hostile country.}
<A>__{he folds the order and hands it to dunbar.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{i'm wondering sir, how will i be getting there?}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{you think i don't know?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{no sir, it's just that i don't know.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{hold your tongue.}
<A>__{the major turns in his chair to stare through a single, dusty window. he can see a teamster outside, tying down canvas on a heavily loaded wagon.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{i'm in a generous mood and will grant your boon. you see that peasant... he calls himself timmons... he leaves this very afternoon for your fort sedgewick. ride with him if you like... he knows the way. that is all.}
<A>__{dunbar stands and salutes. fambrough returns it snappily. the lieutenant starts for the door.}
<C>__{fambrough }
<D>__{sir knight...}
<A>__{dunbar turns around. fambrough is standing in front of his desk. there's a large, dark splotch on the major's trouser front. he jams both of his hands into the front of his pants and giggles.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{i just pissed in my pants... and nobody can do anything about it.}
<L>__{exterior fort hays day}
<A>__{lieutenant dunbar skips down the steps, picks up cisco's reins and starts leading the buckskin along the front of the building. he looks briefly at his orders, stops and turns back towards fambrough's office. and there is fambrough with a full glass of booze in hand, toasting the young lieutenant from the window. a wide grin on his face.}
<L>__{exterior fort hays day}
<A>__{a wagon is pulling slowly away from the lonely headquarters.}
<L>__{exterior fort hays day}
<A>__{the insane face of major fambrough peeks around the corner of a building. on his head is a ridiculous, plumed hat. now he looks both ways, as if preparing to cross a busy street. seeing that the coast is clear, he minces into the parade ground in front of headquarters. the plume is waving in the breeze and the major carries something in each hand... an officer's sword and a revolver. except for these items, the unfortunate major is naked. as he trots onto the parade ground, fambrough is startled to find that elgin is following him. he begins to run faster. fambrough halts near the center of the parade ground and turns back on the lieutenant and waves his pistol menacingly.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{noooo, noooo...}
<C>__{elgin}
<D>__{it's alright major.}
<A>__{now elgin sees a grizzled sergeant approaching fambrough from the opposite direction.}
<C>__{sergeant}
<D>__{leave him alone lieutenant... he's cracked.}
<A>__{fambrough turns on the voice behind him and waves his pistol at the sergeant.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{nooo, nooo...}
<A>__{but fambrough finds himself staring at the barrel of the sergeant's raised pistol.}
<C>__{elgin}
<D>__{don't sergeant.}
<A>__{in a panic fambrough wheels back on lieutenant elgin.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{are you deaf fool. i said i will have my crown this instant... this instant!}
<A>__{slowly and kindly, elgin is walking toward him. he holds out his hand.}
<C>__{elgin}
<D>__{let's have the pistol.}
<C>__{sergeant}
<P>__{(to elgin)}
<D>__{don't do it.}
<A>__{but the lieutenant keeps his hand held out. fambrough eyes him silently. then he screws up his face like a crybaby.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{the king is dead... long live the king.}
<A>__{in one swift motion, fambrough brings the revolver up, swallows the barrel and pulls the trigger.}
<L>__{exterior wagon day}
<A>__{at the sound of a single shot behind him, dunbar twists around on the wagon seat. seeing nothing, he turns back to face the front and takes stock of the driver, timmons. he doesn't like what he sees... or smells. timmons, is not what would be called a credit to his race. if all teamsters were greaseballs he would be their absolute ruler. his stink must be incredible. he leans over the side of the wagon and hocks out a disgusting stream of spittle. afternoon shadows are slanting across the rolling ocean of prairie. the wagon passes camera, headed towards an endless expanse of prairie.}
<L>__{exterior prairie night}
<A>__{the sky is filled with stars. one suddenly catches fire and shoots across the heavens.}
<L>__{exterior campfire night}
<A>__{dunbar sits at the fire watching the star burn out. timmons is bending over the fire. he farts, then turns to dunbar with a smile "good one, huh?". he spits for good measure and for dunbar, the moment is broken, but not forgotten.}
<C>__{dunbar }
<D>__{were it not for my companion i believe i would be having the time of my life. he is quite possibly the foulest person i have ever met.}
<A>__{looking over his shoulder at the journal, we see that this latest entry is one of many and dunbar is embellishing it with a drawing of a star.}
<L>__{exterior prairie day}
<A>__{dunbar is off the seat riding atop the mountain of supplies. he is writing in his journal.}
<C>__{dunbar }
<D>__{we have been gone four days now and still we have seen no signs of life. only earth and sky.}
<A>__{dunbar stops his writing.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{how far do you make the fort?}
<C>__{timmons}
<D>__{far.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{how far?}
<C>__{timmons}
<D>__{forty or fifty miles, maybe... what's the big hurry on sedgewick?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{it's going to be my post... my home.}
<C>__{timmons}
<D>__{you ain't hard to please, i will say that.}
<A>__{timmons slows the wagon and stops. he has seen something.}
<C>__{timmons}
<D>__{look yonder.}
<L>__{exterior prairie day}
<A>__{a cluster of bones bleached white, are lying in the tall grass. human bones. dunbar is squatting next to them. timmons' head dips into view over his shoulder and the teamster's mouth splits into a toothless grin.}
<C>__{timmons}
<D>__{somebody back east is sayin'... "why don't he write?" stupid bastard.}
<A>__{the teamster spits and starts for the wagon. dunbar comes to his feet and examines the burnt out remains of a wagon. then, he finds an arrow in the grassy wheel. looking off he can only guess at the drama here. the sun is sinking fast below the great expanse of prairie.}
<L>__{exterior sedgewick bluff dawn}
<A>__{a hatless soldier in a tattered overcoat, captain cargill, is on the bluff staring morosely through his telescope. one hand rubs a sore spot on his jaw. he sticks the telescope in his overcoat pocket. he wedges a hand into his mouth and wiggles a loose tooth. he gives it a tug but it is not ready to come out. the breeze is coming up and captain cargill pulls his overcoat closed. as he slips his last button through the hole, it breaks off, bounces off of his foot and rolls a few feet down the bluff. captain cargill watches the button forlornly, making no move to go after it. he raises his head once more and looks to the east. nothing is out there.}
<L>__{exterior sedgewick cut bank :}
<A>__{ dawn cargill is walking along the base of the cut bank. he stops, staring up at a series of holes dug into the bluff. their entrance covered with "found" draperies of all description. he works up the courage to call out.}
<C>__{cargill}
<D>__{corporal guest... corporal guest... corporal guest. corporal guest, you don't have to talk to me... just please come out.}
<A>__{at last there's some real movement behind one of the holes and corporal guest crawls through one of the curtains. he neither salutes nor speaks. he blinks down at cargill, looking more like a hobo than a soldier.}
<C>__{cargill}
<D>__{it's the end... assemble the men in front of my quarters.}
<L>__{exterior cargill's quarters day}
<A>__{the "men" have lined up in front of cargill's sad, sod hut; pitiful men. sick, moth eaten, crushed in spirit. there are nine of them. just behind cargill is a half collapsed supply house and a broken down corral holding two bony horses. cargill has a brave face and a broken heart.}
<C>__{cargill}
<D>__{you hate me... but i feel none of the same for you... you men stayed. you stayed after they took all our horses. you stayed after all the others deserted. you stayed on the promise that the army would resupply us. i've looked for that wagon from fort hays just as you have... day after miserable day. all i can say is that i'm proud of you. get your things men, we're leaving this place. the army... can go to hell.}
<A>__{the zombie troops have already broken ranks, lurching back to their holes and gear like a gang of drunks. cargill walks out of frame to reveal the broken down sign that hangs askew above his quarters: "fort sedgewick."}
<L>__{exterior sedgewick bluff dusk}
<A>__{a solitary wolf trots along the top of a bluff overlooking the river. he has two white socks running up his front legs. an old jagged scar cuts across his muzzle. he's watching the ruins of fort sedgewick. the little band of troops, all on foot, with their two lame horses trailing behind are fading in the distance.}
<L>__{exterior wagon camp dawn}
<A>__{the wagon is parked in a shallow depression, its team unhitched. under the wagon the forms of two men lay curled up in blankets. dunbar is sleeping peacefully, his nose pressed against a jacket. now his nostrils begin to twitch. his face turns sour and he wakes to find that he's been sleeping against the stink of timmons. flies buzz about the teamster's sleeping body. dunbar quickly pulls away from the bad smell. he rolls out from under the wagon and clambers to his feet. lieutenant dunbar looks out over the prairie. it's going to be a spectacular day. in the far distance, a column of buzzards is circling. dunbar has paused to watch them. he ducks back under the wagon.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{timmons... timmons.}
<A>__{no response from the deep sleeping driver. dunbar starts to move closer to shake him awake but the odor under there makes him think twice. he snatches up the arrow and probes under the wagon.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{timmons.}
<A>__{the teamster comes awake with a squeal, he joins dunbar staring up at the circling birds.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{something's out there...}
<C>__{timmons}
<D>__{somethin' dead.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{might have a look.}
<C>__{timmons}
<D>__{might stay clear of whatever did the killin'.}
<A>__{timmons' mood is different now. he begins to hitch the team with a new sense of urgency.}
<L>__{exterior prairie day}
<A>__{from a high point on the prairie we can see the wagon moving west. and no more than half a mile away we can see cargill's column, moving east. neither is aware of the other's presence. several buzzards are settling on a half butchered horse. it's one of the animals that was with cargill's command. we can hear men singing. the shaky little column from fort sedgewick is marching east for fort hays.}
<L>__{exterior prairie day}
<A>__{dunbar is walking through a little valley of tall, rich grass. the wagon is nowhere in sight. he looks back at cisco who is also wandering by himself searching for prime shoots. timmons' wagon comes into view now.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{how come we haven't seen any buffalo?}
<C>__{timmons}
<D>__{can't figger the stinkin' buffalo. sometimes you don't see 'em for days, sometimes they're thick as curls on a whore.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{what about indians?}
<C>__{timmons}
<D>__{goddamn indians you'd jus' as soon not see, lessen the bastards're dead. nothing but thieves and beggars.}
<A>__{timmons, as usual, laughs at his own imagined wit. the wagon disappears over a ridge and again, dunbar is alone. in gentle awe, he runs his palm over the top of the grass swirling about his waist. a meadow lark's mournful call startles him. dunbar brings his head up at the sound and so does cisco. now there's a sudden lifting of the breeze. it sweeps through the valley, making the grass roll with a life of its own. the lark's sad call and the sudden violent movement of the wind sends a shudder through lieutenant dunbar. he scans the horizon in all directions, aware all at once of his aloneness. he flips the reins over cisco's neck and sticks a foot in the stirrup. dunbar heads for the ridge.}
<L>__{exterior bluff day}
<A>__{as dunbar comes over the hill, he sees the wagon has ground to a stop. the wagon has paused at the edge of a bluff. dunbar and timmons are peering into the little valley below}

<D>__{have arrived to find fort sedgewick deserted. am now waiting for the garrison's return or word from headquarters. post is in exceedingly poor condition. have decided to assign myself clean up duty beginning tomorrow. supplies abundant. the country is everything i dreamed it would be. there can be no place like this on earth.}
<A>__{dunbar signs the entry, yawns contentedly and reaches to turn down the lamp. a wolf howls somewhere outside. it's low at first but it keeps on building. at its height, the howl sounds as though it is coming from, something gigantic. dunbar is still listening after it's gone. he hears wood snap in the direction of the river then all is quiet again. without hesitating, he slips the big revolver out of its holster and cradling it like a teddy bear, slips it under his blanket. the light is left blazing.}

<L>__{exterior corral day}
<A>__{dressed in pants, old boots, and a threadbare shirt, dunbar bangs home a nail on the sagging corral gate. he tests the gate's swing and satisfied with this, he latches it leaving cisco inside. the lieutenant picks up a water bucket and we follow as he walks the few, quick yards it takes to reach the bank overlooking the river. when he sees what lies along the slope below, he stops. at this spot just below the fort, a garbage dump falls away to the stream. old containers, sacks, rags, trash, bottles, and a thousand other miscellaneous scraps. dunbar hops over the steep lip of the bank and starts down the gentle incline, eyeing the trash as he goes. now he reaches the stream and kneels, preparing to dip the bucket. he sniffs a bad odor, looks across the stagnant stream and sees something sticking out of the water. it's a cloven hoof. and further out, another. and part of an antler. there are decomposed antelope corpses everywhere.}
<L>__{exterior river day}
<A>__{an antelope skeleton is being pulled from the muck. dunbar is stripped to the waist as he drags the body through deep water. covering his face against the stink is a bandana. his pants are soaked and he's sweating hard. at the stream's edge he heaves the antelope onto a pile holding several others. under the bodies is a huge bed of trash which he has already collected. the body he tosses up slips and he has to right it. now he wades back into the river and searches the water with his hands for more.}
<L>__{exterior river bank day}
<A>__{dunbar fastens the last of the traces to a pile of garbage spread out on a sheet of canvas. he picks up a set of long reins, clucks to cisco and they start up the steep bank with the load.}

<L>__{exterior trash pile day}
<A>__{oil is pouring out of a jug and onto the great heap. dunbar empties the last of the oil and throws the empty jug onto the pile. he takes the match he's been holding between his teeth and flicks it to life with a fingernail. he flips it onto the heap. the fire catches immediately and dunbar has to back away a few steps as the flames send a column of thick, black smoke into the air. to dunbar's horror, the smoke billows bigger and bigger... climbing into the sky as a signal for anyone to see.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{damn... damn.}
<A>__{he stoops for his rifle and we follow as he scrambles up the slope. the lieutenant clambers over the lip and stops to scan the horizon. but we continue, following the black smoke as it towers higher and higher until it is just a wisp.}
<L>__{exterior prairie day}
<A>__{four fantastic faces fill the screen, three together, one a little apart. they are tired, frustrated faces, and also very fierce. they are painted. several wear their hair in spiked roaches, one has brightly colored eagle feathers jutting out of his scalp at all angles. the four warriors are naked from the waist up. they are pawnee, the scariest of all the plains tribes. the man a little apart looks the toughest. the four men are squatting on their haunches and four scrawny ponies stand behind them. all the men are staring in the same direction from a low rise on the prairie. it's smoke, a column much smaller than dunbar's. the smoke is drifting up from the furthest of a line of rolling gullies. we can see the whole indian party now: the four men and their ponies, two injured men on travois and two extra ponies. (please note: all indian dialogue will be in native dialect as indicated by tribe. subtitles will be used.)}

<D>__{only a white man would make a fire for everyone to see. 1st pawnee maybe there's more than one.}
<A>__{the toughest turns back to face the others. without another word, he jumps on his horse. another silence as the three warriors consider what to do.}
<D>__{2nd pawnee we have no rifles. white men are sure to have rifles. 3rd pawnee we should forget this and go home.}
<A>__{the toughest has listened all the while, growing more and more disgusted. he pulls the blanket from his shoulders and flings it angrily at his companions.}

<L>__{exterior prairie day}
<A>__{we're dropping down through the smoke, right down to the supper fire of timmons the teamster. he's cooking slab bacon in a pan. risking the heat, he dips a finger into the pan and sucks off the grease. there's a sudden swish of sound behind him and a split second later, an arrow goes deep into the wagon driver's ass knocking him clear across the fire. timmons screams like a half butchered hog and starts into an odd crippled run. he clears the gully where he's been camped and struggles up the incline. another swish and another scream, as another arrow catches him high on the shoulder. terrified with pain and fear, timmons looks back as he scrambles up the slope. here comes the toughest at a lazy gallop. he's riding only with his legs. his hands are busy with bow and arrows. casual but blink quick, the toughest snatches another arrow from the quiver at his waist, strings it and fires. this arrow catches timmons in the gut. he falls squirming against the slope. the toughest is still coming, his face like granite as he fires arrow after arrow. the three warriors who came with the toughest have reached the wagon. two of them are slicing away harness on the team of nice army horses. the third is rifling through timmons' gear. this man unwittingly picks up timmons' blanket. when he gets a whiff of its stink, the warrior flings it far out on the grass. then he drops to one knee, scoops up some dirt and rubs it between his soiled hands.}
<L>__{exterior prairie day}
<A>__{a lone arrow remains in timmons' dead body, jutting out of his privates. now the pawnee warriors pass by, heading for home in no particular hurry. the toughest passes by with timmons' scalp hanging from his bow. none of the men give timmons a parting glance.}

<A>__{we're close on dunbar, his face is grimy with sweat and dirt. he's working hard at something. we pull back and see that dunbar is half way up the bluff, he's been filling up the pockmarks, the holes where cargill's men once lived. exhausted, he stabs the shovel into the fresh earth and pauses to look over his work, all of the holes have been filled. his eyes sweep over the prairie across the river. he sees something moving, it's the wolf. dunbar instinctively goes for his rifle. before he can bring it up to aim, he has second thoughts. he lowers the gun and watches the wolf a moment longer, then walks up the hill and disappears into the sky.}

<D>__{there is a wolf who seems intent on the goings on here. he does not seem inclined to be a nuisance however and aside from cisco has been my only company. he has appeared each afternoon for the past two days. he has milky white socks on both feet. if he comes calling tomorrow i will name him two socks.}

<A>__{dunbar is leading cisco to the top of a low hill. he glances over his shoulder and sees that he is being followed. the wolf with two socks stops when dunbar looks back at him. dunbar watches him curiously for a moment and continues leading cisco up the hill. but now he's glancing regularly over his shoulder and discovers that as he moves, so does the wolf. reaching the top of the hill, dunbar pauses. he pulls out the pocket telescope and sweeps the prairie. there is nothing. now dunbar swings onto cisco's bare back and with a last glance back at the wolf starts down the rise and on to the open prairie at an easy canter. we follow for a little distance. dunbar glances once more over his shoulder. the wolf is sitting on top of the hill watching. he has decided to come no further.}

<D>__{almost a month and no one has come. the longer this condition persists, the less inclined i am to believe that anyone will. rain has forced me indoors for most of two days. i have begun an awning. the work has ruined my hands, but i am excited about the improvement it will bring to this place.}
<A>__{a great bolt of lightning strikes outside, filling the room with violent white light. dunbar walks to the door and tosses out a handful of bones. two socks scurries to collect the bones and retreats under the shelter of a nearby tree.}

<A>__{just as dunbar did on his trip out with timmons, someone is running a palm over the tips of the tall prairie grass. this hand, however, is red. a lone indian is standing in the grass, his pony at his side. he is a real indian; tough, wild and free. he is a person of special maturity. he radiates wisdom and is a man of responsibility in his community. he is a sioux medicine man. he is kicking bird.}
<L>__{exterior river bank day}
<A>__{dunbar is squatting naked at the edge of the stream, pounding the dirt out of his trousers on a little rock ledge. he rises, wringing out the pants, and wades across the river. on the opposite bank he spreads the pants on a low bush. then he looks along the river. for some distance every bush and shrub is draped with the lieutenant's laundry, all of it drying in the sun.}
<L>__{exterior sedgewick day}
<A>__{the spectacular face of kicking bird is staring at something. he's looking thoughtfully at the "new" fort sedgewick; the tidy grounds, the great awning, the repaired corral. the beautiful, buckskin standing inside.}
<L>__{exterior river day}
<A>__{comfortable with his nakedness, dunbar is meandering along the stream in no particular hurry. he's very white. his skin practically sparkles in the sun. dunbar is making his way up the bluff. the steepest part is at the lip and here he drops to all fours. dunbar's face comes into view. he freezes. someone is creeping under the shade of the awning... an aboriginal man. dunbar's head pops down behind the bluff. the lieutenant is down on his naked haunches. his heart is pounding in his ears. sweat has broken out on his face. his mouth is dry as ash. he's playing back images in fragments. a deerskin shirt, strands of hair sewn along each sleeve. fringed leggins. a dark, faded breechclout. moccasins with beading. a single, large feather drooping behind a head of shiny, black hair. braids wrapped in fur. a lethal stone club hanging from a red hand. no eyebrows on a magnificent, primitive face. dunbar stays in a crouch, trying to think on jellied legs. his breathing has quickened. his mouth is open. a horses' whinny startles him. ever so slowly, the lieutenant peers over the bluff. the aboriginal man is in the corral. he's walking slowly toward cisco. one hand is held out reassuringly, the other is grasping a rope. he's making gentle, cooing sounds and is only a step or two from being able to loop his line over the horse's neck.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{you there!}
<A>__{kicking bird jumps straight into the air. as he lands he whirls to meet the voice that startled him. dunbar is coming. his hands are clenched and his arms are swinging stiffly at his sides. kicking bird has turned to stone at the sight of this horror. with a sharp intake of breath, he staggers back a few steps. then he turns and runs, tearing through the corral fence as if it were made of twigs. he leaps onto his horse and quirts the pony into full gallop. dunbar is watching from the yard. his jaw is clenched, his hands are still fisted. the great grassland is empty. kicking bird is gone.}

<C>__{wind in his hair}
<D>__{i do not care for this talk about a white man. whatever kind of white man he is, he is not sioux and that makes him less. we've camped here for ten days now and each day our scouts find nothing. one old bull with wolves tearing him apart, nothing more. we need meat not talk.}

<C>__{wind in his hair}
<D>__{this white man cannot cover our lodges, or string our bows, or feed our children. i will take some good men... there are many here tonight. we will ride to the soldier fort, we will shoot some arrows into this white man. if he truly has medicine he will not be hurt. if he has no medicine he will be dead.}

<C>__{ten bears}
<D>__{it is easy to become confused by these questions. it is hard to know what to do. no man can tell another how he will be. but i know this... killing a white man is a delicate matter. if you kill one, more are sure to come. we should talk about this some more.}
