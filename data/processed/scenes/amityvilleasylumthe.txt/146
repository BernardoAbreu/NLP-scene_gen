<D>__{so you wanted to know about the history of amityville dating back to the native americans?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{yes that's right. i'm writing a college paper and i had heard some rumours in the neighbourhood about native americans being killed on the land down on oceans avenue.}
<A>__{gloria's demeanour instantly turns from jovial to serious.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{well that area has quite a dark history.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{you mean the defeo murders at one twelve?}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{yes. terrible business that. those young children. breaks my heart to think about such a tragedy.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{yeah it's awful.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{you know most of the town was very upset when they decided to build that mental institution on the land. that used to be a nice suburban neighbourhood, now there's this big eye sore there. we had a thousand names on a petition. but i guess that doctor who runs the place has enough money to pay off the people in high places.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{so what about the native americans? is that story about them being killed on that land true?}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{there's something on that here.}
<A>__{gloria flips through one of the books.}
<C>__{gloria}
<D>__{ah yes, here it is. (reading) in the 18th century there existed a group of native americans in amityville known as "the satchem tribe" led by satchem takapausha, the chief. the tribe had fled salem in massachusetts to escape persecution by the christians who were persecuting members of the tribe because of their witchcraft practices. these practices included a ritualistic human sacrifice of six people (the significance of six being related to the biblical number of man and creation) in order to induce the spirit of their god, the dark master, who they believed manifested his powers through his devoted followers, giving them immortality. the hundred strong tribe settled in amityville but were later chased off the land by local christians. satchem accused the christians of not properly compensating his tribe for the land. a war started and the christians hired a hunter called john underhill from salem. at the site where one twelve oceans avenue was later built in amityville, underhill killed all of the tribe. the indians were buried in a mass grave on the site. before he died satchem vowed revenge. according to local legend, chief satchem is believed to have subsequently haunted the land. various parapsychologists and mediums have claimed that satchem's vengeful spirit influenced the 1974 defeo murders at one twelve oceans avenue and the haunting of the subsequent owners. although such assertions are widely disputed.}
