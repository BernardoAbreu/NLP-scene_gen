<L>__{interior road research lab day}
<A>__{we are witnessing a spectacular road accident re created under laboratory conditions in the immense confines of the road research lab. a motorcycle is in the process of having a head on collision with a sedan bearing a family of four an extremely violent and disturbing crash, despite the use of cradles, dummies, rails, cables and extensive metering and recording technology. among the many witnesses to the crash, including numerous engineers, technicians and transport ministry officials, are james, helen and vaughan. vaughan is energetically masturbating through his jeans, shielded by a sheaf of publicity folders which he holds in his other hand. there is a terrific metallic explosion as the motorcycle strikes the front of the sedan. the two vehicles veer sideways towards the line of startled spectators. the motorcyclist and his bike sail over the hood of the car and strike the windshield, then careen across the roof in a black mass of fragments. the car plunges ten feet back on its hawsers and comes to rest astride its rails. the hood, windshield and roof have been crushed by the impact. inside the cabin, the lopsided family lurch across each other, the decapitated torso of the front seat woman passenger embedded in the fractured windshield. the engineers wave to the crowd reassuringly and move toward the motorcycle, which lies on its side fifty yards behind the car. but it is vaughan a black jacketed figure striding on long, uneven legs who arrives first at the bike. for a moment it seems that he might try to lift it up himself, but he then backs away to where technicians are picking up pieces of the motorcyclist's body, and then turns away completely and rejoins helen and james. vaughan holds up the bundle of technical hand outs in his grip.}

<D>__{get all the paper you can, ballard. some of the stuff they're giving away is terrific: 'mechanisms of occupant ejection', 'tolerances of the human face in crash impacts'...}
<A>__{helen takes james's arm, smiling at him, nodding encouragingly, as if urging a child across some mental hurdle.}

<D>__{we can have a look at it again on the monitors. they're showing it in slow motion.}
<A>__{an audience of thirty or so gathers at the trestle tables to watch a slowmotion replay on a huge television monitor. as the hypnotic, grotesque ballet unfolds, the crowd's own ghostly images stand silently in the background, hands and faces unmoving while the collision is re enacted. the dream like reversal of roles makes them seem less real than the mannequins in the car. james looks down at the silk suited wife of a ministry official standing beside him. her eyes watch the film with a rapt gaze, as if she were seeing herself and her daughters dismembered in the crash.}
