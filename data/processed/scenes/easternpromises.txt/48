<L>__{interior suburban house. sitting room day}
<D>__{kirill and nikolai are swigging whisky from the bottle and dancing with the girls. some of the girls are drinking, too, and managing to laugh. kirill is dancing maniacally and swinging his girl around faster and faster until she falls over. nikolai swigs his drink and notices the girl who refused to stand up. she is standing in the corner, sobbing. nikolai doesn't care to look at her for more than a second and he goes back to dancing. after a moment kirill dances his way over to nikolai and yells above the music.}
