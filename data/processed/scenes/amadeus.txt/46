<C>__{old salieri }
<D>__{extraordinary! on the page it looked nothing. the beginning simple, almost comic. just a pulse bassoons and basset horns like a rusty squeezebox. then suddenly high above it an oboe, a single note, hanging there unwavering, till a clarinet took over and sweetened it into a phrase of such delight! this was no composition by a performing monkey! this was a music i'd never heard. filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing, it had me trembling. it seemed to me that i was hearing a voice of god.}
<A>__{suddenly the music snaps off. mozart stands before him as he lays down the score.}
<C>__{mozart}
<D>__{excuse me!}
<A>__{he takes the score, bows, and struts briskly out of the room. salieri stares uncomprehendingly after the jaunty little figure.}
<C>__{old salieri }
<D>__{but why?}
