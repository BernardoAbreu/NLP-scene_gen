<L>__{interior the lab}
<A>__{the digital clock races through time. witwer reaches his hand up and touches the vanishing numbers. the camera pulls back, and we see dr. resfield and the two technicians bound and gagged in a heap in the corner. and when we see the lab in its entirety, there sprawled on the floor in front of his chair is one of the precog brothers. a small rise of blood comes from a torn place in the back of his skull. the other precog sits very still in his chair. he is still connected to everything his helmet is in place, the tvs drip into him. his eyes are open, and when witwer moves, the precog's eyes follow him. witwer can feel them on him. he turns around.}
<C>__{witwer}
<D>__{is he coming? no? yes? maybe?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i think yes.}
<A>__{the precog looks at him.}
<C>__{witwer }
<D>__{and you think yes.}
<A>__{witwer points to the tv screen, running anderson's murder of witwer. witwer smiles triumphantly.}
<C>__{witwer }
<D>__{infallibly, immutably yes.}
<A>__{the precog looks at him. witwer's smile vanishes, and suddenly strides across the room, and claps his hand over the precog's eyes. then he turns, and stares again at the clock.}
