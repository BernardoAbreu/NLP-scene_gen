<L>__{exterior train siding (new orleans) night}
<A>__{rita disappears from view in a cloud of steam...}
<L>__{interior wanderer parlor car night}
<A>__{west has every weapon on the train out for cleaning and loading. gordon is in the galley where he continues his conversation with west while preparing dinner.}
<C>__{gordon }
<P>__{(from gallery)}
<D>__{you know, i've been trying to place myself in loveless's shoes...}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{good luck on that one.}
<C>__{gordon}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{ha, ha, ha... you know, i can't imagine what loveless a man without any reproductive organs could possibly want with rita.}
<A>__{suddenly there's a whoosh and rita falls through the ceiling and plops in the chair just like west did earlier. he instinctively pulls his gun. puts it away as gordon muses about her anatomy.}
<C>__{gordon }
<P>__{(not realizing she's there)}
<D>__{not that rita doesn't have a figure that would inspire a botticelli... or a raphael.}
<A>__{rita raises an eyebrow, looks to the galley as gordon comes out with a platter of food. he still doesn't see her there.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{... especially her breasts. did you notice the way one of them...}
<P>__{(cups his hands)}
<D>__{both of them actually... to say nothing of her buttocks...}
<A>__{gordon turns and looks into the car. finally sees her. changes gears without missing a beat.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{... and the group of foreign ministers at loveless's party... what were they doing there?}
<A>__{gordon gestures for west to join him at the pool table. rita immediately goes for the food.}
<C>__{gordon}
<P>__{(using pool balls)}
<D>__{here's france, spain and britain...}
<P>__{(sotto voce)}
<D>__{how long has she been here?}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{since the first breast.}
<A>__{gordon turns to her, exasperated with himself.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{i am so embarrassed.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{i will spare you.}
<P>__{(to rita)}
<D>__{make yourself a sandwich to take with you. you're getting off.}
