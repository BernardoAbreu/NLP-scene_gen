<L>__{interior bedroom, elektra's villa later}
<A>__{a puddle of water where the ice fell. post sex on the bed. he traces a hand down her naked back. the sweat glistens off the curve of her spine. she turns. the light glints off her jewelled earlobe...he touches it.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{you never take this off?}
<A>__{elektra looks at him.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{why do men always want to undress the one part of a woman's body she doesn't want to reveal?}
<A>__{she reaches to the large, diamond encrusted earring and gently plucks it away. pulls her lush hair back... the lower half of her ear is gone, reduced to a misshapen clump of scar tissue. it is the only mark on her perfect body. a physical reminder of her ordeal. it breaks his heart.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{how did you survive?}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{i used my body on the guards. it gave me control. i got to a gun and i took my chance.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i've never told anyone that.}
<A>__{they are looking at each other, both suddenly feeling something dangerously close to real connection. it is not what bond expected.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{do you ever stop, james? do you ever think about...another kind of life?}
<A>__{he holds her gaze for a long time before he looks away.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{i can't afford to.}
<A>__{she frowns, slightly. settles into his chest.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{don't worry. i know who you are.}
<A>__{he holds her, eyes full of conflict, staring into the dark.}
