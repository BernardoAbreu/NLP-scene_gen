<D>__{yeah right. and why the hell are you still driving?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{the car stops, carlos and jessica climb out of the car and pass in back of it without a word. carlos climbs into the driver seat, and jessica the passenger seat. jessica grabs carlos's nachos and starts munching them down, dipping each one into the cheese sauce that is on the side.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{where's the squirt?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{at my place watching tv.}

<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{yeah, i'm stuck with her all weekend. i'm just gonna get through these last few weeks like i promised, and i'm done, i did a good thing, and some other moron can take a turn being her big sister.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{don't know why you wanted another sister when you hate the one you got.}

<A>__{jessica is obviously delighting in this. she enjoys carlos fighting off the affections of this very unattractive girl.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{aw carlos, i think you should give her a shot. she's probably one of those personality girls.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{yeah, what you know about personality?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{i bet she'll give it up right away.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{now that's something you know about.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{you should go for it. drain them pipes.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.}
