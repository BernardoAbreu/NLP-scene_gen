<A>__{lit by torches, korben sets leeloo delicately on the altar in the exact center of the four elements. cornelius looks over the four stones every which way.}
<C>__{cornelius}
<P>__{(panic stricken)}
<D>__{uh, this one... must be water!}
<A>__{it's obvious he doesn't know where to put it.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{don't tell me you don't know how all this works?}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{theoretically, yes! the four stones form the beam and the fifth element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... i don't have the reference book. i've never seen the stones work!}
<A>__{korben can't believe his ears. he tears the stone out of cornelius' hand and studies the inscriptions. he goes over to one of the four bases the stones rest on and tries to figure it out. the symbol of air is on the stone, the same as on the base.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{match the symbols!}
<A>__{korben places the first stone and picks up another one. cornelius has found the symbol for water. loc rhod sits down. he is very tired.}
<C>__{loc rhod}
<D>__{what is this some kinda game? like chess?}
<A>__{korben pulls him to his feet and sticks a stone in his hands.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{no. it's much simpler. if we don't figure out where these stones go in five minutes, we're all dead! think you got it?}
<A>__{loc rhod's got it and runs over to put in his stone. the four stones are all in place but nothing happens.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{there's no light! you told me there were supposed to be four beams of light.}
<C>__{cornelius}
<P>__{(lost)}
<D>__{yes, of course, but... the stones are shut! they have to be open for it to work.}
<C>__{korben}
<D>__{and you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying?}
<C>__{cornelius}
<D>__{that's what i'm saying.}
