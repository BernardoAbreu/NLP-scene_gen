<L>__{interior shaft two shot logan and jessica}
<A>__{moving at an extremely high speed...we can see the outside flickering dark, light, dark, light... and finally to a white color. they lie slumped, motionless. finally it stops. the door opens into a kind of glistening darkness, suffused by a bluish glow. it is now very cold. in the silence logan stirs. groping, he touches jessica, who moves close to him. logan puts his arm around her and they rise. slowly, tentatively, he leads her out into the dark chamber where they stand for a moment trying to find themselves. what little light there is seems to come from the left. arm around jessica, logan starts to move.}
