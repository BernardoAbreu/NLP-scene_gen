<L>__{interior school auditorium day}
<A>__{sadie and a bunch of other kids are building sets for a school play. sadie talks with a friend. pete and debbie are watching from afar, sitting next to each other. debbie tries to gently break the news.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{she's so cute. she's so tall.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i know. how did that happen?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{do you ever wish we had a bigger family?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{no, never for a second. never.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{never?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{never. i love what we have. one? a breeze. two? brutal. three? put a bullet in my head.}
<A>__{debbie is totally deflated.}
<C>__{pete }
<D>__{i think about that gray haired pregnant lady from school and i just feel bad for her. and i feel bad for the kid. can you imagine? all the other little kids, "where's your mommy?" "oh, she's the one sitting in that scooter eating a soft cracker." kids don't want to have old parents. you know, it would also be nice for us to spend some time apart. kind of rediscover who we are individually. it would be so great to not see you for like a chunk of time so that i could really just miss you. remember when we used to miss each other?}
