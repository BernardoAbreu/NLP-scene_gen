<L>__{interior dark room, carrier night}
<A>__{fury is talking with the council, four shadowy figures on screens.}
<C>__{councilman}
<D>__{this is out of line, director. you’re dealing with forces you can’t control.}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{you ever been in a war, councilman? in a fire fight? did you feel an over abundance of control?}
<C>__{councilman}
<D>__{you’re saying that this asgard is declaring war on our planet?}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{not asgard, loki.}
<C>__{councilwoman}
<D>__{he can’t be working alone. what about the other one, his brother?}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{our intelligence says thor is not a hostile. but he’s worlds away and we can’t depend on him to help either. it’s up to us.}
<C>__{councilman}
<D>__{which is why you should be focusing on phase two, it was designed for exactly this purpose.}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{phase two isn’t ready; our enemy is. we need a response team.}
<C>__{councilman}
<D>__{the avengers initiative was shut down.}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{this isn’t about the avengers.}
<C>__{councilman}
<D>__{we’re running the world’s greatest covert security network and you’re gonna leave the fate of the human race to a handful of freaks.}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{i’m not leaving anything to anyone. we need a response team. these people may be isolated, unbalanced even, but i believe, with the right push, they can be exactly what we need.}
<C>__{councilwoman}
<D>__{you believe!}
<C>__{councilman}
<D>__{war isn’t won by sentiment, director.}
<C>__{fury}
<D>__{no, it’s won by soldiers.}
