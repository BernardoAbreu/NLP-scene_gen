<L>__{interior hall}
<A>__{the ship is quiet and dark. everyone is asleep.}
<L>__{interior main deck}
<A>__{the core glows with monitor light. cypher is in the operator's chair as neo cones up behind him.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{whoa! shit, neo, you scared the bejeezus out of ne.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{no, it's all right.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{midnight watch.}
<A>__{neo's eyes light up as he steps closer to the screens that seem alive with a constant flow of data.}
<C>__{neo}
<D>__{is that... ?}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{the matrix? yeah.}
<A>__{the monitors are packed with bizarre codes and equations.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{you want a drink?}
<A>__{he pours neo a drink from a large plastic jug.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{i will tell you, i feel for you, man. i really do. most of us were still young, just punks, when morpheus jacked us. but you, you had a real life.}
<A>__{neo takes a sip and it almost kills him. cypher pounds on his back.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{good shit, huh? dozer makes it. it's good for two things: degreasing engines and killing brain cells.}
<A>__{red faced, neo finally stops coughing.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{did he tell you why he did it?}
<A>__{neo nods.}
<D>__{cypher, i will be the didn't tell you that this wasn't the first time he thought he found the one.}
<A>__{neo shakes his head as cypher fills his cup and laughs.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{let me give you a piece of advice. between you and me, if morpheus says you can fly, i wouldn't go jumping out any windows to find out if he's right. understand?}
<A>__{cypher raises his drink. neo swallows another throat scorching mouthful.}
<C>__{cypher}
<D>__{welcome to the real world!}
