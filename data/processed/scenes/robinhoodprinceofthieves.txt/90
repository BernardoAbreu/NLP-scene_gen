<T>__{dissolve to:}
<A>__{robin's face distorted in water. the laughter becomes the sound of a running river. robin is washing, trying to drive away the horror. the first streaks of light fight their way through a thick, morning mist. out of the mist steps a figure, at first indecipherable. aware of his presence, robin looks up.}
