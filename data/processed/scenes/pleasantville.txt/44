<A>__{it is a beautiful tree lined pond with a lush willow tree in the foreground. the moonlight glistens silver across the water. several cars are parked in a row with their occupants holding hands. biff's convertible is parked at the end. shot. biff's car. he sits stiffly at the wheel staring straight ahead. jennifer is draped languidly across the seat beside him, making the most of her mohair sweater. she stares at biff in a not so pleasantville kind of way. he glances over at her and swallows.}

<D>__{oh, biff. you can "pin" me any time you want to.}
<A>__{she leans back a liftle more, draping her arm across the top of the seat. her tits point toward the sky.}

<D>__{oh, that's silly mary sue. how could you possibly pin me?}
<B>__{close up. biff.}
<A>__{he is still guffawing when he looks over at jennifer and suddenly freezes. biff's eyes widen ...}
