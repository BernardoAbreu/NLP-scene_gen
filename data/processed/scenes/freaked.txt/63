<C>__{bearded lady}
<D>__{if your coloring is in the autumn range, like maria's, try an earth tone eye makeup. now i've done a lovely french braid on maria, but i encourage everyone to experiment and use your imagination. the main thing is to just have fun with it.}
<A>__{the audience is engrossed. some take notes.}
<C>__{sockhead}
<A>__{is ringing those "tuned bells" and singing along.}
<C>__{sockhead}
<D>__{edelweiss, edelweiss.}

<C>__{man}
<D>__{he's got a hand under there!}
<C>__{someone else}
<D>__{it's a hoax!}
<A>__{sockhead realizes he's unveiled and tries to hide his hand head with his other hands. the crowd starts jeering and pelting sockhead with rotten vegetables. he gives them the finger with all three hands. elijah tries to calm them.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{puppetteering is an admirable skill in its own right! give him his due!}

<C>__{worm}
<D>__{don't you see? you must turn your hardship into inspiration! you're an actor, rick! your body is your instrument, and with it you must play your tragic symphony for all the world!}
<A>__{rick is really moved. elijah pokes his head backstage.}
<C>__{elijah}
<P>__{(to rick)}
<D>__{they're going nuts for you, beast boy! you better go out there now!}

<A>__{nosey gives him a worried look.}
<C>__{onstage}
<A>__{the spotlight reveals rick, centerstage, poised in shakespearean garb. the crowd quiets down and focuses on rick with great respect and awe. a truly dramatic silence. rick pauses for effect and then launches into a soliloquy with bravura.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{now is the winter of our discontent, made glorious summer by this son of york, but i that am not shaped for sportive tricks, nor made to court an amorous looking glass, i, that am curtailed of this fair proportion, cheated of feature by dissembling nature,}
<A>__{the audience is riveted. even spanish speaking peasants are mouthing the words. elijah, however, thumbs through his script, totally confused. the freaks watch through the bars from the wings completely engrossed, especially julie. juan notices this and pulls her closer to him, but she pushes him away. we move in on an erudite british gentlemen in the crowd. by god! it's alistair cooke! he turns to camera. subtitle:}
<B>__{alistair cooke.}
<C>__{alistair cooke}
<P>__{(sotto voce)}
<D>__{if you're having trouble understanding mr. coogan's brilliant reading of this soliloquy from richard the third, please take advantage of the handy subtitles for the culturally illiterate.}
<A>__{a filthy peasant sitting next to cooke is trying to listen to rick. he turns angrily to cooke.}
<C>__{filthy peasant}
<D>__{shhh!}
<A>__{cooke turns back to the stage. the words in brackets appear as subtitles.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{deformed, unfinished, sent before my time, {i'm ugly} into this breathing world, scarse half made up, {i'm really ugly} and that so lamely and unfashionable, that dogs bark at me as i halt by them. {i'm f kin' butt ugly, alright!?} why i, in this weak piping time of peace, {blah, blah, blah} have no delight to pass away the time, {i never get laid...} unless to see my shadow in the sun, and descant on mine own deformity! {because i'm ugly}}
<A>__{rick bows. the crowd bursts into applause. they yell "bravo" and throw bouquets. rick takes several curtain calls. the freaks cheer for him. julie is particularly moved she and rick exchange a heavy look, laden with romantic potential. note: we will insert an almost subliminal one frame shot of the pepsi logo at this triumphant moment. kevin, the ees executive from the airport scene, walks into the tent. rick sees him and gasps with joy. he leaps off the stage, runs up to kevin and hugs him. kevin is shocked, of course. overcome by the moment, rick regresses to his old self.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{i'm saved! haha! you sorry mutants are gonna rot in this hole while i'm sipping mint juleps by the pool! {as fortune smiles o'er my fate, so destiny spurns your accurse'd pate}}
<A>__{the freaks and the audience gasp at rick's cruelty. julie is shocked juan gives her an "i told you so" look. rick sees julie and catches himself.}
<C>__{rick}
<P>__{(to kevin)}
<D>__{i mean, um, i hope you have room for all my friends, heh heh.}
<C>__{kevin}
<D>__{rick, rick, listen, i really love this new look you've come up with. but just between you and me, i don't think the guys upstairs would really get it.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{what are you saying!?}
<C>__{kevin}
<P>__{(chuckles snidely)}
<D>__{i'm saying you're ugly enough to burn the nosehairs off a dead nun.}
<A>__{the crowd bursts into cruel hysterics, pointing mockingly at rick. even alistair cooke is practically choking with laughter.}
<C>__{alistair cooke}
<D>__{ah ha ha ha! what a putz!}
<A>__{rick looks around, horrified at the sea of evil, jeering faces. he begins to tremble. then... rick's monster eye springs to life for the first time and glows red with rage. his whole monster side awakens and takes charge of his body with violent intensity. he grabs kevin's head and screams in a new, monstrous voice.}
<C>__{rick}
<D>__{eat shit!}
<A>__{pop! he plucks kevin's head off his neck and holds it aloft. the head stares down at rick in disbelief.}
<C>__{kevin's head}
<D>__{now you're just being childish.}
<A>__{rick serves the head like a volleyball, smashing it to bits. the crowd panics and charges for the exits.}
<C>__{crowd}
<D>__{ahhhhhh! help! let us out of here!}
<A>__{people are trampling over each other in the mayhem. alistair cooke is crushed under the stampede. the freaks are horrified. monster rick growls triumphantly. elijah looks on, intrigued.}
<C>__{elijah}
<D>__{now that's entertainment.}
