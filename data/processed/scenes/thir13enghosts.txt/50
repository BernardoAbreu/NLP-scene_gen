<L>__{interior bobby's bedroom}
<A>__{the room's filled with all types of cool, macabre, boy stuff. a seven year old's dream, if you were a demented seven year old.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{this is definitely my room.}
<A>__{maggie plops down on a bed made up with skull and crossbones sheets. she finds a pair of ghost glasses lying on the bedside table. puts them on.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{so, do i look cool?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{no, you look like a dork...}
<A>__{but the nanny isn't listening. she sits there, slack jawed.}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(looking through glasses)}
<D>__{my god... this is... incredible...}
<A>__{maggie's pov through ghost glasses the etched glass symbols on the wall have been added to with flowing red, glowing symbols. not only do they weave in and about the walls, but they create a path on the floor that leads right out the door.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what? lemme see.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{one second.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{c'mon... bobby grabs at them. maggie takes them off.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{alright, alright... here... bobby puts them on, and reacts.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{cool!}
<A>__{bobby grabs his scooter and mike, and takes off down the hall. maggie gives chase, but it's obvious she's not going to catch him. he zooms in and out of the bedrooms, up and down the halls, following the glowing red path. he takes a couple of turns when he realizes he may have gone too far. the boy has become lost in all the glass. bobby is alone.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{maggie...?}
<A>__{bobby starts scooting again, only this time with a bit more urgency. he passes an open door, which opens into a set of stairs heading down. he stops, backs up, then glances down. at the bottom of the nearest landing, he catches the glimpse of a figure standing. the female figure is in silhouette, and her head is tilted oddly to one side, though from this distance, we can't see why.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{kathy??}
<A>__{the figure oddly shuffles off.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{c'mon, kath, stop playing games.}
<A>__{with his scooter under his arm, bobby heads downstairs, into the darkness of the house.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i'm gonna tell dad...}
