<D>__{violet lays motionless on the bed in the semi darkness, facing the wall, still fully clothed. ivy and karen join her. they stare at their mother's comatose form. finally:}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{now what?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{wine... lots of wine.}
<L>__{exterior weston house yard gazebo night}
<D>__{barbara, ivy, karen and the remains of the dinner wine sit around the table in the backyard gazebo.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{think we can goad mom into giving burke her "greatest" generation speech tomorrow, tell him about the claw hammer? "august" 11 11 12 yellow pages 92.}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{won't do any good, he's part of the same generation.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{"greatest generation," my ass. what makes them so great? because they were poor and hated nazis? who doesn't fucking hate nazis? remember when we checked her in the psych ward, that stunt she pulled?}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{big speech, she's getting clean, making this incredible sacrifice for her family, she's let us down but now she'll prove she's a good mother.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i wasn't there.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{she smuggled darvocet into the psych ward ...in her vagina. there's your greatest generation for you. she made this speech to us while she was clenching a bottle of pills in her cooch, for god's sake.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{god, i've never heard this story. "august" 11 11 12 yellow pages 93.}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{did you just say "cooch"?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{the phrase "mom's pussy" seems gauche.}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{you're a little more comfortable with "cooch," are you?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{what word should i use to describe our mother's vagina?}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{i don't know, but }
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{"mom's beaver"? "mother's box"?}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{oh god }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{barbara! as their laughter slowly dies down }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{one thing about mom and dad. you have to tip your cap to anyone who can stay married that long.}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{karen. he killed himself.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{is there something going on between you and little charles?}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{i don't know that i'm comfortable talking about that. "august" 11 09 12 pink draft}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{because you know he's our first cousin.}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{give me a break.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you know you shouldn't consider children.}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{i can't anyway, i had a hysterectomy last year. what? barbara and karen stare at ivy. "august" 10 23 12 blue draft}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{cervical cancer.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i didn't know.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{neither did i.}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{i didn't tell anyone except charles. that's where it started between us.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{and hear it from mom the rest of my life? she doesn't need another excuse to treat me like some damaged thing.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{you might have told us.}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{you didn't tell us about you and bill.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{that's different.}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{why? because it's you, and not me?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{because divorce is an embarrassing public admission of defeat. cancer's fucking cancer, you can't help that. we're your sisters.}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{i don't feel that connection very keenly.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i feel very connected, to both of you.}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{we never see you, you're never around, you haven't been around "august" 10 23 12 blue draft}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i still feel that connection!}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{i can't perpetuate these myths of family or sisterhood anymore. we're just people, some of us accidentally connected by genetics, a random selection of cells.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{when did you get so cynical?}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{that's funny, coming from you.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{bitter, sure, but "random selection of cells?"}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{maybe my cynicism came with the realization that the responsibility of caring for our parents was mine alone.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{don't give me that. i participated }
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{till you had enough and got out, you and karen both. i'm not criticizing. do what you want. you did, karen did.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{and if you didn't, that's not my fault.}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{that's right, so don't lay this sister thing on me, all right? when i leave here i won't feel any more guilty than you two did.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{i can't believe your world view is this dark.}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{you live in florida. "august" 11 09 12 pink draft 96 97.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{you're thinking of leaving?}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{charles and i are going to new york. barb bursts out in derisive laughter. karen joins her.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{what are you going to do in new york?}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{we have plans.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{none of your business.}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{what about mom?}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{what about her?}
<C>__{barbara}
<D>__{you feel comfortable leaving mom here?}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{do you?}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{you think she was tough when he was alive? think what it's going to be like now.}
<P>__{(to karen)}
<D>__{you're going back to miami, right?}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{yes. ivy stands, gathers up her wine glass. "august" 10 23 12 blue draft}
<C>__{ivy}
<D>__{there you go, barb. you want to know what we're doing about mom? karen and i are leaving. you want to stay, that's your decision. but nobody gets to point a finger at me. nobody. ivy starts back for the house.}
