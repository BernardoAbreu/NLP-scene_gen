<L>__{exterior park night}
<A>__{on harry, running. ahead is a mounted cop. harry doesn't break stride, heading right for the cop on the horse. the cop turns, surprised, a split second before harry pulls him off the horse and slams him to the ground (he's wearing a helmet).}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{federal officer in pursuit of suspect! sorry.}
<A>__{harry is in the saddle and galloping after malik before the cop can get his gut out of the holster to stop him. malik roars through the park on the kawasaki. he looks back, amazed to see harry charging after him on a horse. they scatter joggers and bicyclists, people walking their dogs. tracking with them as they rocket through the park. malik leaves the winding path and goes straight through the trees. harry charges through some rollerbladers who go sprawling. malik fires his beretta straight back at harry, emptying it. he drops the pistol and crouches over the bike, twisting the last bit of throttle out of it. they are going flat out, through the trees, in a kinetic blur.}
