<A>__{terminator walks out, surveying the parked harleys. sticks the .45 in his belt and swings one leg over a massive custom electro glide. he slips the dagger in his boot and the key in the ignition. kicks over the engine. it catches with a roar and he slams the heavy iron into gear with a klunk. lloyd appears at the diner's door with a sawed off 10 gauge winchester lever action shotgun. he fires into the air and jacks around round in fast, aiming at terminator's back.}

<A>__{terminator turns and considers by coldly. he eases the shifter up into neutral. rocks the bike onto its kickstand. swings him leg over and walks calmly toward the guy. terminator strides right up to lloyd, staring straight into the shotgun's muzzle. lloyd starts sweating, trying to decide is he's going to kill a man in cold blood. he's still trying to decide when terminator's hand blurs out like a striking cobra and is somehow suddenly holding the shotgun. lloyd gapes, knowing he's screwed. then... terminator reaches toward him. oh shit... and slips the sunglasses out of lloyd's shirt pocket. puts them on. strides back to the harley and roars off in a shower of gravel.}
