<B>__{jake.}
<A>__{jane is mid fifties and has embraced that fact. she knows 50 is not the new 40 and because of that, she is still described by all who know her as beautiful. everything about this woman's appearance screams "solid." the years have been good to jake. he's never lost his looks, his killer smile, or his ability to charm. he lifts his glass of champagne.}
