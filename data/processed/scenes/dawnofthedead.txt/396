<A>__{in the storage area below, fran is examining the maps in the manual. the tv still drones in a low volume. the men climb down into the room.}
<C>__{roger}
<D>__{hey, fran...}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{i would have made coffee and breakfast, but i don't have my pots and pans.}
<A>__{there is a bitterness in her voice. roger laughs. steve senses the tension. peter just straps on his equipment.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{can i say something?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{sure. what dp you mean?}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{i'm sorry you found out i'm pregnant, because i don't want any of you to treat me differently than you'd treat another guy.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{hey, frannie, come on...}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{and,... i'm not gonna be den mother for you guys.}
<A>__{they all look at her, attentive now.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{and i want to know what's going on. and i want something to say about the plans. there's four of us, ok?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{jesus, fran...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{fair enough!}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{now. what's goin' on?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{we're goin' out.}
<A>__{fran starts to say something, but this time peter cuts her off.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{... and you are not coming with us!}
<A>__{again the woman starts to protest, but peter continues.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{and you will not come with us until you can handle yourself. that means learn to shoot and learn to fight.}
<A>__{the big man starts back up the pyramid. roger moves to follow him.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{something else.}
<A>__{the men look at her. she faces roger and peter directly without looking at stephen.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{i don't know anout you two, but i wanna learn how to fly that helicopter.}
<A>__{stephen is shocked. fran looks at him and lowers her eyes.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{if anything happens... we've gotta be able to get out of here.}
<A>__{stephen doesn't know what to say. he looks at the woman, then up at the other men.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{she's right, flyboy. come on, let's go.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{and you're not leaving me without a gun again.}
<A>__{stephen thinks about protesting but he complies by slowly setting his rifle down on the cartons. then he fishes in his pocket for a fistful of shells and dumps them next to the gun. he stares at the woman angry and hurt. fran picks up the weapon and shoots a glance up at peter.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{i just might be able to figure out how to use it.}
<A>__{peter and roger disappear through the skylight. stephen stands still. he looks down at the floor. fran moves close to his side.}
<C>__{fran}
<P>__{i'm sorry, stephen. (it is not an apology)}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i know... i know... it's alright!}
<A>__{he starts up to the skylight.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{stephen}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{he stops and turns to look at her. her eyes are pleading for understanding, but he is incapable of it at the moment. fran just shrugs off whatever she was going to say, and she sighs with exasperation.}
<C>__{fran}
<D>__{be careful.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{yeah, we'll be alright.}
<A>__{he disappears through the skylight. fran stares down at the weapon in her hands, then she steps over and clicks off the television.}
