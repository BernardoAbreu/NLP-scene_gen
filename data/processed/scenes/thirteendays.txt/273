<L>__{interior bobby's limo night}
<A>__{bobby stares out the window at the passing city, the lights the lives behind those windows. as the car drives on and on, the tension returns. bobby feels the weight of all those lives. on him. a long beat. he gazes at kenny, the only man he could ever admit this to:}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i don't know if i can do this.}
<A>__{kenny glances over at him. bobby stares back.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{there's nobody else i'd rather have going in there.}
<A>__{bobby looks at him.}
<C>__{kenny }
<D>__{nobody else i'd trust helen and the kids' lives to.}
<A>__{kenny means it. he looks away. bobby shifts, awkward.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{take a left.}
<A>__{kenny looks him. this isn't the way to the justice department. but he complies.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{we gave so much to get here. i don't know. sometimes i think what the hell did we do it for?}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{because we knew we could do a better job than everyone else.}
<A>__{and bobby, in the silence and closeness of the car, turns on kenny anguished, knowing his life is at its climax.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you know... i hate being called the brilliant one. the ruthless one. they guy who does the dirty work. the one everybody's afraid of.}
<A>__{kenny looks to him, moved, not knowing what to say.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{i hate it. i'm not smart, you know. and i'm not so ruthless.}
<A>__{he looks to kenny, searching his face, then away, embarrassed.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{you're right about the smart part, but ruthless, well...}
<A>__{that breaks the tension as they arrive at the scene:}
<B>__{through the window}
<A>__{appears the grim, square lines of the soviet embassy. police cars line the streets outside it. all the windows are dark. a cordon of kgb guards in plainclothes stand by the gated entrance. on the opposite side of the street lounge two dozen washington d.c. police.}
<B>__{resume}
