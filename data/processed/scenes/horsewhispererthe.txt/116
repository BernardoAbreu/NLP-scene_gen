<L>__{exterior double divide ranch dusk}
<A>__{the sky is changing colors, the temperature has dropped. tom is still sitting in the grass, although someone has brought him a blanket for his shoulders. pilgrim is in the pasture, but now he too is motionless, looking back at tom. the sound of a car makes tom turn to see annie driving up. she gets out, stands by the car with a proprietary air, watching tom and pilgrim. grace remains in the car. there's a sound. she turns to see diane coming out of the house...}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{there's coffee inside... i was just bringing this to tom.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{would you mind if i did? i'd like to talk to him.}
<A>__{diane, knowing full well tom ain't in a talking mood, hands her a cup...}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{sure.}
<P>__{(seeing grace in car)}
<D>__{does your daughter want to come inside?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{uh, no, we're going to dinner... is this the way to the pasture?}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{pasture? oh, that stretch of field near the hill? yeah.}
<A>__{she's gone. annie grimaces, then crosses the hillside to where tom is squatting down. she appears to his side and, without speaking, tries to indicates she has his coffee by leaning it toward him. tom sees her and accepts it with a grateful nod. annie waits. nothing happens. feeling foolish, she begins to walk back. at some point, she turns to see pilgrim moving across the pasture toward tom. he stops in front of him, just a few feet away. tom says something to him. annie is intrigued and she knows enough to stay quiet now. she watches pilgrim walk over to him. she watches as tom gets up and pats pilgrim's scarred head. in spite of herself, annie is somewhat moved by this act. only we see grace, peering out from the car, seeing this act of communion as well. only we see her reaction to it. as tom turns and walks back to the ranch, pilgrim follows him. as he passes annie, all he says is...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{from now on, leave your phone somewhere else...}
<A>__{as he moves past her, annie responds;}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{but i have business calls i have to }
<A>__{tom keeps heading for the barn as he suggests, without turning back;}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{then drop off grace in the morning, go on back and do your business. come pick her up around dinner.}
<A>__{standing there, annie has the impulse to respond to this suggestion, but has no idea what to say and saying it wouldn't make much sense since tom is already out of ear shot. diane appears from the house and calls out:}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{mrs. maclean why don't you and daughter stay for dinner?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{oh uh, thank you. no, we don't want to impose.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{no imposition. plenty of food. gonna get pretty dark soon. hard to find a place.}
<A>__{annie looks up to the alien sky and realizes she's right. she looks to grace, who doesn't seem to oppose the idea.}
