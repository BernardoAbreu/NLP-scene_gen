<A>__{reilly cruises into the bowels of downtown. makes a few turns and parks. in the shadows of a burned out building, reilly observes several junkies getting a fix from their connection. reilly watches with scared, tempted eyes. he looks at his hands... they're trembling... catches his reflection in the rear view mirror. checks rice's watches on his wrist, taps it. still not ticking. ashamed, he screeches away.}
