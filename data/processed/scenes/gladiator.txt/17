<L>__{interior mess tent night}
<A>__{an immediate swirl of noise. the grand mess tent is crowded with soldiers. they are still filthy with caked on mud and blood. wounds are bandaged and tankards are raised in celebration of the victory. marcus sits in a central position and receives visitors. currently two senators, falco and gaius, are bowing before him.}
<C>__{falco}
<D>__{hail, marcus aurelius.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{stand up, senators. that unfamiliar posture doesn't suit you.}
<C>__{gaius}
<D>__{we live in supplication to your glory.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{all the while conspiring with that fat man in rome. how is the old monster?}
<C>__{gaius}
<D>__{senator gracchus is hale, sire.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{still damning me to the four winds?}
<C>__{gaius}
<D>__{still eager for your triumphant return to rome, caesar.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i would have silenced him decades ago but i just like him too much.}
<A>__{meanwhile, maximus stands with his lieutenants, titus and quintus. a wound on maximus' arm has been bound.}
<C>__{maximus}
<P>__{(to titus)}
<D>__{if you want to stay on, i support you. so do the men. i will ask the emperor to appoint you in my place.}
<C>__{titus}
<D>__{it won't be the felix regiment without you.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{i will return after a season at home. maybe two.}
<C>__{quintus}
<D>__{that means after three or four more babies.}
<C>__{titus}
<D>__{and you'll be too fat from vibia's cooking to get on your horse by then.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{should the gods so bless me. i would be thankful.}
<A>__{commodus perambulates up to them.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{hail, warriors. my congratulations.}
<C>__{titus and quintus}
<P>__{(bowing)}
<D>__{highness.}
<C>__{commodus}
<P>__{(to maximus)}
<D>__{my old friend, my father tells me you're returning to spain?}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{a pity. i will need men like you in my army...}
<A>__{an awkward glance between the soldiers. this sort of talk is offensively premature.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{there are larger division that might appeal to you. even the praetorian guard. you've never been to rome. imagine arriving as head of the praetorians! they have really splendid uniforms.}
<C>__{maximus}
<P>__{(cold)}
<D>__{i'm going home.}
<A>__{senators gaius and falco join them.}
<C>__{gaius}
<P>__{(to maximus)}
<D>__{... and why not apply for entry to the senate?}
<C>__{falco}
<D>__{a war hero with a handsome face and a strong heart could go far.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{general maximus, may i present senators gaius and falco. beware of this gaius, he'll pour a honeyed potion in your ear and you'll wake up one day and all you'll say is "republic, republic, republic..."}
<A>__{laughter.}
<C>__{falco}
<D>__{have you never considered rome?}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{you've had my ear since we were children. you could be a valuable ally in the senate.}
<C>__{gaius}
<D>__{are you a believer in republicanism?}
<C>__{commodus}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{there i warned you.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{i'm a soldier, not a politician.}
<A>__{meanwhile, a dark eye is studying the men through a hidden slit in the tent wall. the eye is particularly drawn to maximus.}
<C>__{gaius}
<D>__{if your heart lies with the people, i would back you for the senate. i'm sure gracchus would as well.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{not a word about that sodomite bastard.}
<C>__{gaius}
<P>__{(smiles to maximus)}
<D>__{the august senator gracchus has been rather a gadfly on the flesh of the imperial family.}
<C>__{falco}
<D>__{he's a damned provocateur.}
<C>__{gaius}
<D>__{he lives under the antiquated assumption that the senate should represent the people with vigor.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{i won't tolerate it. his incessant criticism exhausts me. the man can speak for five hours without taking a breath.}
<C>__{gaius}
<D>__{he serves rome best when he serves it with honesty.}
<C>__{commodus}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{enough... maximus, i would like to inspect the felix regiment at dawn. please arrange it.}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{i can't do that.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{maximus}
<D>__{my men have been fighting for five solid days. they're too busy dying to go on dress parade.}
<A>__{a beat. commodus' eyes flash fire at this public rebuke. he very quickly gets control.}
<C>__{commodus}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{of course, how foolish of me. some other time...}
<A>__{he notes his father being helped out of the tent by several body slaves.}
<C>__{commodus}
<D>__{caesar retires early tonight.}
