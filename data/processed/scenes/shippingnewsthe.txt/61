<L>__{interior wavey's house night}
<A>__{angle...brightly lit kitchen. bunny sits at the little table, a large mixing bowl filled with popcorn before her, little herry at her side. they are watching freakazoid on a tiny tv. bunny shovels in a mouthful of popcorn. then makes a sage, if unintelligible, comment about the show to herry. still chewing, she takes another huge handful of popcorn... ...herry opens his mouth like a baby bird. bunny stuffs the snack in. it's a stare and chew, side by side. just alike. angle...cozy parlor. quoyle sits in a barca lounger with a huge bowl of chips in his lap. he is watching hockey on a modest tv, the action is fierce. stuffs his mouth full of chips, yet somehow manages to say...}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{...so there they were, this goofy old codger and his dog, big as life.}
<A>__{pull back to see wavey now. curled on the sofa, under a lap robe. she is knitting something in a heavy oxblood colored wool. he watches her work.}
<C>__{wavey }
<D>__{that'd be old nolan. he's actually your uncle, last of the crazy quoyles. i should have realized.}
<A>__{keeps her eyes on her work.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{sad, really. lives like a hermit in a run down shack. no one to look after h...}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{here i was worried about bunny night and day, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with her.}
<A>__{a silence. which makes him uneasy.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{her only problem is her dad worries too mu...}
<C>__{wavey }
<D>__{you are a loving and wonderful father. you're not the problem.}
<A>__{she meant to reassure him. instead...}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{so what is th...}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{nice to see you.}
<A>__{looks up with smoky eyes.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{...after all this time.}
<A>__{oh.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{well. i've been workin' longer hours. so dennis and beety were kind enough to bring bunny to the daycare. fed her a lotta meals, too. they're real friends.}
<A>__{quoyle's smile tries to sell the innocence of his absence.}
<C>__{wavey }
<D>__{i thought you forgot. that i'm your friend, too.}
<A>__{no smile from her. she wants him to know she was hurt. he shakes his head, serious now. no, i didn't forget.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{you want another sandwich? there's roast pork.}
<A>__{he holds up what's left of his four decker. this is plenty. takes a huge bite to show how much he likes it.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{you said. you'd read me your article.}
<A>__{he did, he nods. but just now he's scared to. and so she smiles. which traps him. he pulls out a single sheet of paper. clears his throat.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{nobody hangs a picture of an oil tanker. that's the header.}
<A>__{she nods. likes that. he gestures, go back to your knitting. so she smiles, slyly. and commences to knit.}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{there's a 1904 photo hung in the library. eight schooners heading out to fishing grounds, sails spread it like white wings. beautiful. beyond compare.}
<A>__{this means something to him. hear it in his voice.}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{more common today is the low black profile of oil tankers. like the ruptured golden goose, which last week bled 14,000 tons of crude onto seabirds, fish and boats at cape despond.}
<A>__{he stops. as if revisiting that little thought in his mind.}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{there will be more and more tankers. they will grow old and corroded, and their tanks will split. they have already done to fishing. what their spill has done to fish.}
<A>__{he sneaks a glance. she has never looked up.}
<C>__{quoyle }
<D>__{nobody hangs a picture of an oil tanker. on their wall.}
<A>__{silence. a full one.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{well. whatcha think?}
<A>__{she reflects.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{i think when card sees it, he'll split a gut. i think he'll sit up nights thinking of cheap shots to pay you back. i think he'll never stop until you're fired.}
<A>__{quoyle keeps nodding at each pointerior yep. yep.}
<C>__{wavey}
<D>__{i think i haven't been so proud. of a friend. since i don't know when.}
<A>__{quoyle's heart explodes in his chest. and shines in his eyes. there is a long silence.}
<C>__{wavey }
<D>__{maybe another sandwich. there's roast pork.}
<A>__{he swallows. he just doesn't want to cry from happiness.}
<C>__{quoyle}
<D>__{well, sure.}
