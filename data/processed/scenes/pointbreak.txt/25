<D>__{use a gun, go to heaven.}
<A>__{the guard freezes. white and sweaty. tricky dick slips up to him and collects the pistol. kennedy covers the stunned customers. johnson backs up against the door jam, watching the street, and the sedan idling at the curb.}

<A>__{nixon pulls a pack of twenties back out of the bag and tosses it to the bank manager. who reflexively catches it. then drops it like a hot potato just before it explodes into a cloud of blue ink. the manager is dyed blue. burnt money showers on the terrified customers. lbj looks at his watch and whistles. the bandits sprint for the front doors. kennedy exits first, followed by reagan. lbj pauses under the surveillance camera, drops his trousers and moons. thank you is written across his white butt. black and white video monitor high angle, distorted wide shot. lbj hoists his pants and splits, followed out by nixon, who exits backward with the famous double peace sign held high overhead. image freezes. victorious nixon, grainy... something from a time warp. the image suddenly goes into high speed reverse. the bank robbery sequence zips backward.}
