<L>__{interior marcus's dorm room night}
<A>__{the time is circa 1985. vi and marcus finish making love. marcus has cerebral palsy.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{hey, you want to hear my short story now?}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{marcus}
<P>__{(lifts a ms from a shelf by his bed)}
<D>__{i can read it to you.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{you mean, again?}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{well, i changed the ending a little.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{oh. what happens now?}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{well, actually, it's the same, but longer. i think it's better. more...raw.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{well then, maybe you should just read the ending.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{but it won't make any sense if you hear it out of contexterior}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{i think you should leave it the way it was. it was good.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{so you don't want to hear my new ending?}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{you'll read it in class tomorrow. surprise me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{anyway, i have to go. i promised melinda i'd help her with her oral.}
<A>__{she rises, starts dressing.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{you're tired of me. i can tell.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{marcus, i'm tired. that's all.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{you've lost interest...you hardly even sweat any more when we have sex.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{i was never much of a sweater. you know that.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{look, vi, i don't blame you. you feel you feel pity now. the pleasure isn't there any more. the kinkiness has gone...you've become kind.}
<L>__{exterior campus green day}
<A>__{it is bright and sunny.}
<L>__{interior mr scott's classroom day}
<A>__{mr scott, who is black, presides over his class. marcus is reading from his story, vi at his side. catherine, a stunning intellectual, sits near the teacher. the rest of the students (amy, elli, etc.) listen closely and take notes.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{"...but when he saw her...it was as if he could walk like a normal person. his legs didn't swing, his arms didn't spaz away...he wasn't a freak any more, for she made him forget his affliction. no more cerebral palsy! from now on "cp" stood for...cerebral person. he was a cerebral person.}
<A>__{pause. marcus and vi exchange looks.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{i thought it was really good, marcus...really moving and emotional.}
<C>__{elli}
<D>__{yeah, i thought it was really emotional, too.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{and i mean, really good word choices. it kind of reminded me a little of faulkner, but east coast and disabled.}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{or flannery o'connor. she had multiple sclerosis.}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{and borges. he was blind.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{updike has psoriasis.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{um...maybe i'm wrong, but, um, i'm afraid i found the whole thing to be a little trite. its earnestness is, well...it's a little embarrassing. and those adjectives, they're a little flatfooted. and redundant. i'm sorry, but...anyway, what do i know? don't even listen to what i say. i mean...}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{mr scott}
<D>__{anyone else?}
<A>__{no response.}
<C>__{mr scott}
<D>__{catherine is right. the story's a piece of shit. you express nothing but banalities and, formally speaking, are unable to construct a single compelling sentence. you ride on a wave of cliches so worn, in fact, it actually approaches a level of grotesquerie. ad your subtitle, 'the rawness of truth' is that supposed to be a joke of some sort? or are you just being pretentious?}
<P>__{(beat; then checking his class book)}
<D>__{ok. who's next?}
<L>__{exterior campus courtyard day}
<A>__{marcus, upset, rushes outside, vi in pursuit, desperately trying to console.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{marcus, wait up!}
<A>__{marcus stops.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{what do you want?}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{don't be so upset. it's ok...}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{what the fuck are you talking about? what's ok?}
<C>__{vi}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you know he hated my story also.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{your story was terrible!}
<A>__{he moves on, she keeps up with him.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{marcus...you'll write something better next time!}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{patronizing fuck! if you had just been honest with me in the first place i wouldn't have read it. i knew it was shit. but idiot! i believed you!}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{that's not fair! i was honest! just because i wasn't sucking up like that bitch catherine.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{well, i sure didn't hear you voice your opinion in there when it mattered.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{i admit it i was scared! i was shocked, in fact , by what he said. and he's so...convincing. i'm sorry if i let you down, but really, i still say he's just one opinion. i don't even like his books that much. they're all so aggressively confrontational. i don't care if he's won the pulitzer prize.}
<A>__{catherine and mr scott walk by together in the distance.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{you just want to fuck him. like catherine and every other white cunt on campus.}
<A>__{he leaves her.}
<L>__{interior vi and melinda's dorm room night}
<A>__{melinda lies on her bed with some homework, watching vi.}
<C>__{vi }
<P>__{(on phone)}
<D>__{...but marcus! you can't just unilaterally decide to end things. this is a relationship we're talking about! a friendship! you don't just...fuck you!}
<A>__{she hangs up and enters her bedroom, in tears.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{fuck him! fuck him! fuck him...}
<C>__{melinda}
<D>__{vi? are you ok?}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{yes. i'm ok. i'm totally ok.}
<A>__{melinda rises, puts a hand on her shoulder.}
<C>__{melinda}
<D>__{you did the right thing.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{i know that. fucking cripple. why do i waste my time with undergrads? they're all so...juvenile! uch! i just thought marcus would be different. i mean he's got cp!}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{melinda}
<D>__{what are you gonna do now?}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{i dunno...go to a bar...get laid...whatever...don't worry about me. i will be fine...}
<A>__{she starts changing into a new outfit.}
<L>__{exterior bar night}
<A>__{students hang around outside. vi goes inside.}
<L>__{interior bar night}
<A>__{vi walks up to the bar.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{can i have a beer?}
<A>__{after getting her beer, vi turns around and suddenly notices mr scott, who is sitting alone. she goes over to him.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{mr scott}
<D>__{hello, vi.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{mr scott}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i didn't mean, i just didn't expect to run into you here, that's all.}
<C>__{mr scott}
<D>__{well, now you have.}
<A>__{vi laughs, sort of, ten blushes.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{yeah, um, then...are you alone?}
<C>__{mr scott}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{can i join you?}
<A>__{mr scott gestures for her to sit down with him.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{gee, thanks. well, um...i just wanted to say that i'm really happy with the class and, um...i know you must here this all the time, but i'm also a great admirer of your work. a sunday lynching, especially...really, um spoke to me. god, i hope i'm not embarrassing you...}
<C>__{mr scott}
<D>__{you're not.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{good.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{'cause i...um...i really agreed with everything you had to say last week about how bad my story was...}
<C>__{mr scott}
<D>__{that's good.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{and i also agreed with what you said today about marcus's story. it is a piece of shit.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{mr scott}
<D>__{you have beautiful skin.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{thank you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so catherine seems like she might become a really good writer.}
<C>__{mr scott}
<D>__{maybe. she's ok.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{aren't you going out with catherine?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. it's none of my business. i didn't mean...}
<C>__{mr scott}
<D>__{i'm not 'going out' with catherine.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{oh.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{do you think i have a potential as a writer?}
<C>__{mr scott}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{thank you for being honest.}
<A>__{mr scott leans over and touches her hand.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{i have so much respect for you.}
<L>__{exterior street night}
<A>__{mr scott and vi walk together in silence.}
<L>__{interior mr scott's apartment night}
<A>__{vi and mr scott enter. he turns around and looks at her. pause.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{can i just freshen up for a second?}
<A>__{he indicates the direction of the bathroom.}
<C>__{mr scott}
<D>__{it's over there.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{thanks.}
<L>__{interior mr scott's bathroom night}
<A>__{vi enters, locks the door behind her. she looks at herself in the mirror, then notices a snapshot of catherine: she is naked, legs open wide. other erotic photographs lie beneath catherine's.}
<C>__{vi}
<P>__{(to herself, almost chanting)}
<D>__{don't be a racist. don't be a racist. don't be a racist...}
<L>__{interior mr scott's bedroom night}
<A>__{vi emerges from the bathroom to find mr scott lounging on the bed.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{it's a really nice place you have. is the rent high?}
<C>__{mr scott}
<D>__{take off your top.}
<A>__{she obliges.}
<C>__{mr scott}
<D>__{now...take off the rest.}
<A>__{she does, and he looks hard at her. finally he rises.}
<C>__{mr scott}
<D>__{turn around.}
<A>__{she does.}
<C>__{mr scott}
<D>__{bend over.}
<A>__{he starts making love to her, from behind.}
<C>__{mr scott}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{say, 'nigger, fuck me.'}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{oh, bu...uh...i can't say that.}

<L>__{exterior marcus's dormitory night}
<A>__{lights are out.}
<L>__{interior marcus's dorm room night}
<A>__{marcus looks in the mirror, ponders his reflection.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{freak.}
<A>__{there is a soft knock at the door. he turns away from the mirror and opens it. vi is there, teary eyed, disheveled.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{can i come in?}
<A>__{they embrace.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{you're all...sweaty!}
<L>__{interior mr scotts classroom day}
<A>__{vi finishes reading her story to the class.}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{'...so john flipped her around and slammed her against the wall. jane braced herself: she thought about her mother. she thought about peter. she thought about god...and rape. ''say, 'fuck me, nigger. fuck me hard.''' john's flesh abraded her soft skin. there would be marks. she acquiesced, and said what he asked her to say, and did what he asked her to do. she had entered college with hope, with dignity, but she would graduate as a whore.'}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{why do people have to be so ugly...write about such ugly characters? it's perverted. i know you all think i'm being prisssy, but i don't care. i was brought up in a certain way. and this is...mean spirited!}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{yeah, well, it did seem a little affected. like by using taboo language you were trying to shock us about the hollowness of your characters.}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{i think it was a little bit racist.}
<C>__{elli}
<D>__{it was completely racist, and beyond that i felt deeply offended as a woman. as if a woman can only operate from experiences of objectification.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{totally phallocentric.}
<C>__{elli}
<D>__{and so weirdly misogynistic. i mean, why does jane go through with this? is she stupid?}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{hey, but wasn't this a rape? or ...did i miss something? because i i'm confused. because if this was a rape, then why would she be a whore?}
<C>__{catherine}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it was confessional, yet dishonest. jane pretends to be horrified by the sexuality that she in fact fetishizes. she subsumes herself to the myth of black male potency, but then doesn't follow through. she thinks she 'respects afro americans,' she thinks they're 'cool,' 'exotic,' what a notch he 'd make in her belt, but, of course, it all comes down to mandingo cliche, and he calls her on it. in classic racist tradition she demonizes, then runs for cover. but then, how could she behave otherwise? she's just a spoiled suburban white girl with a benneton rainbow complex. it's just my opinion, and what do i know...but i think it's a callow piece of writing.}
<C>__{mr scott}
<D>__{callow and coy. jane wants more, but isn't honest enough to admit it. in the end, she returns to the safety of her crippled}
<P>__{(translation: sexually impotent)}
<D>__{boyfriend.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{this is bullshit! her story was the truth!}
<C>__{joyce}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{sue}
<D>__{it's unbelievable!}
<C>__{elli}
<D>__{it's cliched!}
<C>__{amy}
<D>__{it's disgusting!}
<C>__{vi}
<D>__{but it happened!}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{mr scott}
<D>__{i don't know about 'what happened,' vi, because once you start writing, it all becomes fiction. still, it certainly is an improvement over your last story: there is now at least a beginning, a middle, and an end.}

<L>__{interior toby's bedroom night}
<A>__{a lower east side tenement apartment. a dogma '95 poster hangs above the bed. toby, down and out and in his thirties, leafs through his high school yearbook. he reads an inscription: 'toby, i just know you're going to become a movie star! please don't forget me when you make it to the top! i will always love you pam'. he picks up his phone and dials.}

<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{so. look at where we are: the year 2000! can you believe it? i mean, did you ever think we would actually make it?}
<C>__{pam }
<D>__{um, well, yeah.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so are you still acting?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{oh, no, not any more. no, um, i kind of came to terms with myself, i realized i had done what i had to do. and it was time to move on.}
<C>__{pam }
<D>__{oh. so what did you do after you gave up on acting?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{well, i went to law school, if you can believe that.}
<A>__{mike, toby's roommate and cameraman, enters looking for a towel, then goes to take a shower.}
<C>__{pam }
<D>__{i believe it.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{yeah, well, it was really all kind of a joke and a rip off, so, uh...so i dropped out.}
<C>__{pam }
<D>__{oh, that's too bad.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{yeah, well, then it got me writing, so that was a good thing.}
<C>__{pam }
<D>__{anything i might know about?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{well, um, i kind of let things go on this novel i'd been really into i mean, the whole publishing industry is totally corrupt. i mean, really, it's finished.}
<C>__{pam }
<D>__{that's too bad.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i worked over at a homeless shelter for a while, drove a cab to pay the rent, but, i mean, that was like i mean, i have some dignity.}
<C>__{pam }
<D>__{that's good. so then what do you do now?}

<D>__{i'm a documentary filmmaker.}
<C>__{pam }
<D>__{oh? anything i might have seen?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{n not yet. i'm hoping to get a grant for this one project on teenagers. geez, remember when we were teenagers?}
<C>__{pam }

<C>__{toby}
<D>__{oh, i don't remember that...}
<C>__{pam }
<D>__{i do.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{well, but it was so long ago. we were so different back then...}
<A>__{no response.}
<C>__{toby }
<D>__{uh, well, anyway, so i'm looking for subjects for this documentary on teenage life in suburbia. kind of an exploration of the mental psyche of its mythology. i wrote to derrida to see if he'd like to do the narration. but everything's still kind of in development at this pointerior}
<C>__{pam }
<D>__{hunh.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{i work in a shoe store right now. but it's cool. i'm not ashamed. i mean, really, i have a much stronger sense of self now. and, uh, anyways, it's really very temporary.}
<C>__{pam }
<D>__{that's good.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{yeah...um...so anyway, tell me. what about you? i'd heard through the grapevine you were producing movies.}

<C>__{editor}
<D>__{this is entertainment you're making, toby. this story about a kid in the suburbs and the state of the college admissions process has, with this brady crisis, evolved into something much richer and more provocative.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{yes, i know...but still, it should be somewhat entertaining.}
<C>__{editor}
<D>__{i mean, without this footage, without this rigorous documentation, it would feel like exploitation.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{no, no, no. no exploitation. this is serious...but don't you find it a little funny too, at the same time?}
<C>__{editor}
<D>__{you've got a family tragedy on your hands. will you tell me what's funny about that? about a kid in a coma?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{nothing, i guess...}
<C>__{editor}

<C>__{toby}
<D>__{ok, you're right, you're right...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you know, we need to screen what we've got...invite some regular people, just some random off the street types...and see what real people think of this.}
<C>__{editor}
<D>__{i dunno, toby. we really have a long way to go. you still need a lot more footage, and it's probably a little premature to start screening...}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{ok, then we can invite serious intellectual types.}
<C>__{editor}
