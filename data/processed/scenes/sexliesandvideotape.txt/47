<L>__{exterior john and ann millaney's house day}
<A>__{ann, now in jeans and t shirt, stumbles to her car. once inside, she jams the key into the ignition and rests her head against the steering wheel.}
<L>__{exterior graham's apartment day}
<A>__{ann lifts her head from the steering wheel and looks up. she looks almost surprised to find that she has driven to graham's. slowly, she gets out of the car.}
<L>__{interior graham's apartment day}
<A>__{graham sits reading. there is a weak knock at the door. graham listens, not sure he heard anything. there is a second weak knock.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{it's open!}
<A>__{nothing happens. graham gets up and opens the door himself. ann stands against the wall of the hallway, her head down, her breathing deliberate. concerned, graham slowly begins to lead her inside. impulsively, she hugs him tightly. unaccustomed to physical contact, graham's hands hang awkwardly at his side. ann slowly pulls back from the embrace and sits down. graham goes to the kitchen area and gets her a glass of water. he gives it to her and sits in the chair opposite. ann holds the glass in her hand, staring at it.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{it's bottled, not tap.}
<A>__{a weak smile from ann. she drinks, swallowing with difficulty.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{i'm not sure why i came here. i had kind of decided not to talk to you after...you know.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{that son of a bitch.}
<A>__{ann looks at graham.}
<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{john and cynthia have been... "fucking".}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{you know?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{how did you know?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{she said it on her tape.}
<C>__{ann}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{why didn't you tell me?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{ann, when would i have told you? we were not speaking, if you recall.}
<A>__{ann says nothing.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{but even if we had been speaking, i wouldn't have told you.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{it's not my place to tell you these things, ann. you have to find out by yourself or from john directly. you have to trust me on this.}
<A>__{ann shakes her head.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{my life is...shit. it's all shit. it's like somebody saying, "okay, chairs are not chairs, they're actually swimming pools" i mean, nothing is what i thought it was. what happened to me? have i been asleep? i vaguely remember the wedding, but a lot of it is just a blur...like i was watching from a distance. i can't believe him. why didn't i trust my intuition?}
<A>__{graham says nothing.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{and i'm vacuuming his goddam rug. his rug, that he paid to have put in his house. nothing in that place belongs to me. i wanted to put some of my grandmother's furniture in it, but he wouldn't let me. so i m vacuuming his rug. that bastard.}
<A>__{ann looks at graham.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{i want to make a tape.}
<A>__{a pause.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{do you think that's such a good idea?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{don't you want to make one?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{yes. but i sense the element of revenge here.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{what difference does it make why i do it?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i want you to be aware of what you're doing and why, because i know that this is not the sort of thing you would do in a normal frame of mind.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{what would you know about a normal frame of mind?}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{that's a good question.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{what do you have to do to get ready?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{load a new tape, turn the camera on.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{then do it.}
<A>__{graham opens a new box of videotapes.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{how do you pay for all this? i mean, rent, and tapes and this equipment.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i have money.}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{what will you do when the money runs out?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{it won't. are you ready?}
<C>__{ann}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{graham turns the camera on.}
<C>__{graham}
