<L>__{170einterior james's car same time}
<A>__{james sees niki coming up behind him. cannot believe his eyes. james move to block niki's path... niki attacks fearlessly. despite terrible pain. niki moves to overtake james. utterly intimidated by niki's bravery, james panics, and loses control of the car. he spins out.. commentators cannot believe their eyes. hunt's blown it! lauda's overtaken him! it's a miracle. it defies belief. as niki crosses the line.... caption: "race 15. niki 4th. james retired."}
