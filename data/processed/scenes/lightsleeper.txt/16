<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{hotel sex}
<A>__{paramount hotel room: vermeer's lace maker dominates phillipe stark decor. letour and marianne are all over each other. the pain of the moment, the pain of the past are subsumed by passion. blind, welcome sexuality. naked, they kneel facing each other on the bed, faded bleeding heart tattoo on his bicep:}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{have you ever had sex totally straight?}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{not with you.}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{neither have i.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{such an erection.}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{never had anything like it stoned. feel it.}
<P>__{(she does)}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{weird.}
<C>__{letour}
<P>__{(caresses erection)}
<D>__{wow.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{i'm dripping.}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{let's disappear.}
<A>__{they smack their sweaty bodies, tumble yelping to the carpet, kiss indiscriminately:}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{kiss, kiss, kiss.}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{kiss, kiss, kiss.}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{together.}
<A>__{later: night. they lie nude in a scramble of twisted sheets and mattresses. street lights cast horizontal shadows. letour crawls over, falls upon marianne's breast. she wakes up, looks at john, looks out the window, returns to slow sad reality. marianne stands, pulls on her panties.}
<C>__{letour}
<P>__{(waking)}
<D>__{you need to go back?}
<A>__{she dresses before responding:}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{this is the end. it was wonderful. i'm glad it happened this way. it will never happen again. you will not see me, you will not call me again. i'm happy for you. i wish you the best. i'm leaving. i'm going back to the hospital. i shouldn't have left but i don't regret it. please dress and leave as soon as possible. i have a key. goodbye.}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{marianne...}
<C>__{marianne}
<D>__{it's my fault.}
<A>__{marianne, clothes askew, exits.}
<C>__{letour}
<D>__{i love you.}
<A>__{letour is alone. he pulls his pants on. looking for his socks, he peruses marianne's personal things. he examines her cosmetics, her underclothes. he dabs her perfume on his cheek. buttoning his shirt, he retrieves his beeper from suit jacket. activated, it disgorges messages. he checks his watch: 9:00 p.m.}
