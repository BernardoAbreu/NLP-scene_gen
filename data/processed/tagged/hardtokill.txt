<A>__{from the tragic violent rage to what almost seems like a kiddie game, we are not sure if: storm has gone mad or what. he approaches the master closet as he continues the taunting melody.}
<B>__{master closet}
<A>__{storm enters and begins pushing the clothes of the racks aside looking for something that's probably not there. trent is too smart for this shit ... he's probably on a jet to the bahamas by now. one more rack of clothes in the farthest back section. storm reaches to shove it aside when, with shocking and deafening suddenness: a shotgun blast erupts point blank ... shredding $10,000 worth of suit jackets and barely missing storm's head. instantly a figure leaps out. storm gently disarms him, and the two men are for a moment frozen eye to eye.}
<B>__{storm and trent}
<A>__{storm seems to drift off somewhere far away, and then violently slams trent up against the wall, pinning his chest with the left hand. storm takes the sawed off shotgun by the handle and punches the barrel straight into trent's mouth. the barrel simply goes through the teeth and in his mouth. it appears storm has made up his mind about what to do. trent's eyes bug out of his head. storm now takes trent by the hair and leads him through the house, shotgun still in his mouth.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{you know, trent, i want to kill you so bad i can barely contain myself. but i keep thinking that death is far too merciful a fate for you, and that a nice petite white bread boy like you in a federal penitentiary ...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{ let me put it this way i doubt whether you could remain anal retentive for very long. yeah... i think that's best for you }
<A>__{trent is now so fucking scared he looks like he is about to go out of his mind. about this time in their journey through the house, storm has stopped before holland's mangled and lifeless body. if you think trent was scared before, you should see him now. storm curiously turns his back on trent for a moment, to pick up handcuffs off the floor. trent sees his last chance. trent seizes the poker and does his most mighty babe ruth impression. just as storm stands up, the poker comes flying. it looks like storm is dead but somehow he steps inside the arc and does shihonage, which disarms trent and flips him backwards head first into the fire. trent's neck is impaled by one of the decorative iron arrows of the fireplace. he is stuck struggling to free himself from the arrow as his head catches fire ... a fate somewhat worse than prison. storm turns away }

<L>__{exterior cemetery long shot day}
<A>__{we are not sure where we are yet. in the distance, we see a procession of marching men, all wearing kilts, and all the accoutrements of traditional scottish garb. in the front, several paces ahead of the neatly marching lines of men, is a single bagpiper. behind all of them is a hearse, being nobly escorted by mounted police.}
<B>__{full shot}
<A>__{now we see them fully: the colors, the feeling, the emotion of caring men marching in the funeral parade of a fallen comrade. camera pan's over to reveal a section of mourners mostly police but with some civilians. the camera moves closer and pans to the front row, where we see storm in full police regalia, a medal of valor around his neck. andy and sonny are standing near at sober attention. the procession stops and the lone bagpiper continues to play the dirge as he walks up and takes his position on a section of lawn. the pallbearers remove the flag from the casket and present it to the chief of police, who now slowly approaches the group of mourners and stops directly in front of sonny storm. he presents the flag and salutes sonny. the lone bagpiper stops and an officer on trumpet begins playing "taps." the coffin is slowly lowered. full screen tv monitor finally: the film that storm shot that night seven years ago on the wharf. spliced with the audiotape with subtitles including each speaker's name to make every word and identity clear. we see: the two shadow men step from the station wagon. the "pushed" film clearly reveals them to be trent and holland. we see them conspire with calabrese and vitale.}
