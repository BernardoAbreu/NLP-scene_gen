<L>__{interior apartment day}
<A>__{michael is rapidly pacing up and down the apartment, vigorously rocking mary. as soon as he sits down anywhere to rest, mary screams, so michael pops back up and begins the marathon all over again.}

<C>__{michael}
<D>__{where the hell have you been?}
<A>__{he stops. before him stands the apartment manager, mrs. razzolini, a squat little woman with a moustache.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{oh hi, mrs. razzolini!}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{this package came for you... oh! what a cute little baby! is it yours?}

<D>__{oh here, this just came for you. they just dropped it off. can i hold her for a second?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{well, like, y'see... she doesn't like to be held by strangers...}
<A>__{the apartment manager has already given michael the package and grabbed mary. she covers her with kisses. mary smiles. michael absent mindedly looks at the package.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{she loves to be held by strangers! hey, she's soaking wet hmm, no i think it's number 2. want me to give you a hand changing her?}

<D>__{well, so long, mrs. razzolini.}
<C>__{manager}
<D>__{'bye, mary, i will come back to visit.}
<A>__{mrs. razzolini regretfully hands the baby back. no sooner is mary back in michael's arms than she screams her head off. he closes the door; his smile instantly fades.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{what a leech! and that other idiot isn't back yet!}
<A>__{he throws the package onto an armchair in the hall.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{so you love to be held by strangers, do you?}
