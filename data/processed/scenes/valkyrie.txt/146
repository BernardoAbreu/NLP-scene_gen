<D>__{what is it now, sergeant?}
<C>__{helm}
<D>__{it's just that now we're getting conflicting orders, sir. the wolf's lair says one thing, stauffenberg another.}
<A>__{haans sighs, genuinely irritated now.}
<C>__{haans}
<D>__{our job is not to interpret the orders. our job is to pass them along. regardless.}
<C>__{helm}
<D>__{yes, but sir }
<C>__{haans}
<D>__{is that perfectly clear, sergeant?}
<A>__{haans thrusts the orders back at helm who sheepishly walks back to his pool of radio operators.}
