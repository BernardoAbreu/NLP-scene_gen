<L>__{interior coach motorway. morning}
<A>__{at the back of the coach we see a lone passenger. his eyes closed, head drooped. suddenly he raises a hand and rubs the bridge of his nose. it's no use, chris, 25, can't sleep. he pulls up a set of head phones, puts them on, and presses play on his mp3.}
<L>__{interior coach. morning}
<A>__{long shot from the front of the coach, the driver's gruff face to the left, empty seats filtering away from camera, chris' head peaking above a back seat. we hear the music from his mp3 begin to play. it's noel mckoy's "brighter day", a northern soul track that's reminiscent of motown and comparable to the vocal sound of marvin gaye. the track will play over the following opening scenes, the credits fading subtly in and out in white texterior}
