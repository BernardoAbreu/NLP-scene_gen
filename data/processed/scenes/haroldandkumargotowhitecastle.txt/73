<L>__{interior hospital waiting room}
<A>__{kumar is sitting in the waiting room. he hides his head in a jittery manner, as if he's hiding from someone. next to him are daniel and shankar, who are both badly beaten and nursing their wounds. they all make eye contact. it's weird. harold enters the room with a band aid on his neck...}

<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{kumar turns around and sees his father standing next to his brother saikat (a nerdy looking indian guy with glasses, five years older than kumar). both are in doctor attire.}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{oh, now i see why you didn't want to come to the hospital.}
<A>__{kumar gives harold an annoyed look as his dad approaches.}
<C>__{kumar's father}
<P>__{(thick accent)}
<D>__{i hope you are here to apologize for what you did in your interview today. dr. woodruff is a very good friend of mine, and let's just say he was not at all amused by your antics...and neither am i.}
<C>__{saikat}
<P>__{(no accent)}
<D>__{what the hell's wrong with you, kumar? look at me. i own my own house. i drive a beamer. and i get laid whenever i want. you can have all that too, if you'd just get off your ass and go to med school.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{eat my balls, saikat.}
<C>__{saikat}
<D>__{god, you're 22 years old already! when are you gonna grow up and stop with this post college rebel bullshit? like your life is so tough.}
<A>__{kumar doesn't have a response. saikat's right.}
<C>__{kumar's father}
<D>__{i will not tolerate this business from you any longer. you have one more interview tomorrow and it is the last one i'm setting up for you.}
<C>__{kumar's father }
<D>__{if i hear from dr. wein that you were anything short of spectacular, i will completely cut you off!}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{oh, come on, dad!}
<C>__{kumar's father}
<D>__{"daddy will not be coming on anything!" you will be there and you will behave! i've put too much time and effort into you to let you go and fuck it all up.}
<A>__{kumar lowers his head. he's been put in his place.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{you're right. i'm sorry.}
<A>__{kumar gives his father a hug. he even gives saikat a hug.}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{it won't happen again.}
<C>__{kumar's father}
<D>__{good. i will speak with you tomorrow.}
<A>__{kumar's father gives kumar a quick kiss on the head, then he and saikat walk away. harold is stunned...}
<C>__{harold}
<D>__{wow. so i guess you're going to med school after all, huh?}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{fuck that! like i care what my dad thinks. i can't wait to see the look on his face when he finds out i skipped the interview tomorrow. he wants to cut me off? fine! i don't need his money!}
<C>__{harold}
<P>__{(extremely confused)}
<D>__{but...you just hugged him...}
<C>__{kumar}
<D>__{i just needed to get my hands on these...}
<A>__{kumar holds up saikat and his father's scan cards.}
