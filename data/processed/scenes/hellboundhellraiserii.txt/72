<A>__{close up as julia (still bandaged) and malahide come together for a kiss. they part and, as julia moves across the room, the camera begins a long track around the room. first, it reaches a naked girl. as catatonic as tiffany, she says nothing but her eyes betray her terror. her hands are tied above her. julia moves in towards the girl, her eyes glittering with an alien hunger beneath their gauze mask. as she nears the girl, the track passes them and moves through the room. malahide has done his mistress proud. it had been an empty upstairs room (no furniture, bare floorboards) but now it resembles a nightmarish cross between a butcher's shop and a bordello. the camera slowly reveals, as it tracks, that there are seven more people in the room. seven dead people. dried out husks. the tracking is now completing its circle around the room. after the corpses, we return to julia and the girl but the girl too is now a hollow, dried out shell. julia moves back into the centre of the room and stands still. malahide crosses the room to her quickly, drawing a wicked looking kitchen knife from his pocket as he does so. he reaches julia and raises the knife to her face. with one swift, precise movement, he slices the bandages across the side of her face. julia raises her hand and pulls the mask away. the camera sweeps in toward her as she does this until her face is in close up as the bandage mask is pulled aside. her face is perfect.}
