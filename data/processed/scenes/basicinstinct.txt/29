<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{interior the police building night}
<A>__{we see her in a glass enclosed cubicle with a polygraph examiner. nick stands outside watching her with gus and lt. walker. her back is to them. the examiner shuts the machine down, gathers rolls of papers, and comes out of the cubicle.}
<C>__{the examiner}
<D>__{no blips, no blood pressure variations, no pulse variance. either she's telling the truth or i've never met anyone like her.}
<A>__{a long beat, then }
<C>__{lt. walker}
<D>__{well, i guess that's it.}
<A>__{a long beat, nick watches her as she sits inside.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{how does somebody beat this machine?}
<C>__{the examiner}
<D>__{ninety nine point nine percent of the cases, they don't. you'd have to be able to mask the truth from your own central nervous system, your circulatory system, your adrenal glands. in my opinion, this woman is telling the truth.}
<A>__{the examiner walks away. they stand there. catherine stands at the door of the cubicle behind them }
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{can i go now?}
<C>__{lt. walker}
