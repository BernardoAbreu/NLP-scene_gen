<D>__{fuck that, you're lying, i can smell it. open it.}
<A>__{szpilman tries to untie the string, but he's too terrified and can't manage it. the ss lieutenant shoves him out of the way, then takes from his belt a dagger and cuts the string. the ss lieutenant reaches in and withdraws a handful of long yellow beans. he glowers at szpilman, reaches in again, produces a handful of oatmeal.}
<C>__{ss lieutenant}
<D>__{you're all the same. give a jew a little finger, he takes the whole hand.}

<C>__{ss lieutenant}
<D>__{you lie to me again and i will shoot you personally.}
