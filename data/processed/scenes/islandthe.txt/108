<A>__{a glass dome, faceted, insectile. a haut monde h i v e . the movers and shakers of the high tech boomtown drinking, dancing. shot waitresses dose blue tequila. bass music thuds like a heartbeat. scheer looks out of place here but the crowd's too self absorbed to care. he moves through them, invisibly, towards a corner booth. two men in suits sit with a bottle of blue tequila. the first is bald, pale and dead looking, he'd be the grim reaper but for his fixed leer. the second is long haired, bearded, hulking, more of a grim ploughman. he has a metal brace screwed into his forearm.}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{which one of you is diggs?}
<C>__{diggs }
<D>__{that's me, slick. this here's my partner burdon. don't mind him. he gets a little shy around strangers.}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{what happened to his arm?}
<C>__{diggs}
<D>__{`pursuit last week. the guy took a swing at him with a fireaxe. didn't stop burdie though . `took down that fucker with one arm, didn't you?}
<A>__{burdon sips his drink. scheer, underwhelmed, takes a seat.}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{you don't look like bounty hunters.}
<C>__{diggs}
<D>__{well we're on the job, see? and it kind of helps if you bleed in. you don't look like a bondman either.}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{i'm just an intermediary.}
<C>__{diggs}
<D>__{now that's what people use when they don't want to get their hands dirty.}
<A>__{he grins, cannily. scheer grimaces, a pro suffering an amateur.}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{i was told you also handled civil bonds. debt runners, data thieves...}
<C>__{diggs}
<D>__{what we hunt depends on the bounty.}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{it's worth ten platinum. unmarked.}
<A>__{diggs pauses at this. a huge amount. suspiciously huge. he licks some salt, downs a blue tequila shot and bites a slice of lime.}
<C>__{diggs}
<D>__{what's the bond?}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{the parties i represent want to limit the specific details. but let's just say industrial secrets are involved.}
<C>__{diggs}
<D>__{ten platinum. must be big secrets.}
<A>__{that canny grin again. it raises scheer's hackles }
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{any good at keeping them?}
<C>__{diggs}
<D>__{oh, me and burdie, we're busy bees. we don't have time to file every report and we got real bad memories. but just so we understand each other, slick, we're talking about a bag job, right?}
<A>__{scheer returns an equivocal look. then dips in his pocket for two digital slides lincoln and ester's headshots, spinning in 3d.}
<C>__{diggs}
<D>__{what's up with these tattoos? they look like fucking boondock types .}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{all i'm authorized to tell you is they have no records in this state. also that they're not armed or dangerous.}
<C>__{diggs}
<D>__{how about we start with their names?}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{john and jane doe...}
<C>__{diggs}
<D>__{you're kidding me, right? no names?}
<A>__{scheer's look says he's serious. but diggs is still confounded.}
<C>__{diggs}
<D>__{the n with all due respect how the fuck d o you expect us to find them?}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{because you won't have to look. they jumped an overnight shuttle. they'll be headed for the terminal, trying to get out of state. it's strictly a recovery job. for you, it should be childsplay.}
<C>__{diggs}
<D>__{the n why not do it yourself? or is the dog ring just to impress the ladies?}
<A>__{the grin. scheer moves his hand to cover the usmc ring, stiffly }
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{the parties i represent want to stay at arm's length. and just so we understand each other that means no connection, no papertrail, no police interest...}
<C>__{diggs}
<D>__{is that everything?}
<C>__{scheer}
<D>__{. . . no mistakes. they want these two brought in quickly and quietly and unharmed. once you have them, you'll contact me for further instructions.}
<C>__{diggs}
<D>__{i don't know. what do you say, burdie?}
<A>__{b u r d o n looks over. then suddenly stands bolt upright, diving into his jacket, jerking out what looks like a pump action shotgun.}
<C>__{burdon}
<D>__{frank hofstetter! this is a bond recovery! step away from the bar!}
<A>__{faces turn as he swings aim across the bar hofstetter, slight, wide eyed, looking hunted customers moving away, exposing him burdon chambering a cartridge, emphatic hofstetter freezes a deer in the headlights a moment of hesitation then he runs. boom burdon fires but the shot misses, hitting the bartender exploding on impact with a blinding electrical discharge the stunned bartender spasms and drops burdon pumps and chambers another slug his weapon now earned the name of a "thunderbolt". a stampede begins customers running scared his quarry lost in the stampede, burdon vaults over the table diggs pulls out what looks like a twin barrel sawn off and launches after him scheer stays seated, watching the hunt with remote curiosity hofstetter claws through the stampede spotting burdon and the thunderbolt close behind he drops out of the firing line onto his knees crawling, banged about almost at the exit, almost twin barrels press to his head diggs looks down grinning, beckoning him upright hofstetter looks up bleak, defeated a girl blunders into them toppling over hofstetter into diggs hofstetter takes his chance to run now scrambling against the stampede diggs disentangles himself and levels his weapon the stampede parting throwing themselves to the ground as boom diggs fires the scattershot hits hofstetter a s he flees up some steps peppering his leg sparks off metal as diggs keeps firing his weapon now earned the name of a "rainmaker". hofstetter reaches a catwalk his leg dragging, numbing from the tranquilizer cores the catwalk dead ends blind panic now he ducks under the rail, reaching for the dome finding a precarious handhold, he swings across trying to climb diggs comes up beneath looking up, grinning the pathetic sight of hofstetter one leg useless clinging to the dome like a fly trapped under glass as burdon goes to recover him }
<C>__{diggs}
<D>__{don't bother. he'll drop by himself.}
