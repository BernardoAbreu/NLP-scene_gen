<A>__{jeffrey has a camera taped and rigged to the dashboard aimed at the front door of frank booth's apartment building. the camera is covered with a cardboard shoe box. jeffrey is eating a sandwich which was wrapped in wax paper and is waiting and watching. a lady steps out of the building and begins walking down the steps. jeffrey reaches over and removes the shoe box and quickly takes two pictures. we see a man walk down the street and turn up the steps. jeffrey shoots, but really only gets the back of the man.}
