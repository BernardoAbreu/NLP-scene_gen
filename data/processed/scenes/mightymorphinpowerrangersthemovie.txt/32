<D>__{no offense, boss, but they might find you a little disgusting.}
<C>__{ivan}
<D>__{yes, well, i suppose you'd know a little something about that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{not to worry. i will ever so gently lure them in and mold them into an army of devils! and what better way to entice them ... than with a little ivan's ooze?!}

<C>__{bulk}
<D>__{a stellar idea, skull.}
