<D>__{rock music died in 1970, that's what i think. before that it was fantastic. i can tell you that. everybody was crashing, hanging out at the fillmore. me and my girlfriend ann used to go up the fire escape, you know? it was unbelievable. rock stars everywhere. that airplane that's my group, man. all libras. but now everybody's split or got sick or busted. i think i will move to one of those communes in vermont, you know? that's where all the smart ones went. i stayed here.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{i never been to a commune. i don't know. i saw pictures in a magazine, and it didn't look very clean to me.}
<C>__{iris}
<D>__{why don't you come to a commune with me?}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{me? i could never go to a place like that.}
<C>__{iris}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{travis}
<P>__{(hesitant)}
<D>__{i... i don't get along with people like that.}
<C>__{iris}
<D>__{you a scorpion? that's it. you're a scorpion. i can tell.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{besides, i've got to stay here.}
<C>__{iris}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{i've got something important to do. i can't leave.}
<C>__{iris}
<D>__{what's so important?}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{i can't say it's top secret. i'm doing something for the army. the cab thing is just part time.}
<C>__{iris}
<D>__{you a narc?}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{do i look like a narc?}
<C>__{iris}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{travis breaks out in his big infectious grin, and iris joins his laughter.}
<C>__{iris}
<D>__{god, i don't know who's weirder, you or me.}
<C>__{travis}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{what are you going to do about sport and that old bastard?}
<C>__{iris}
<D>__{just leave'em. there's plenty of other girls.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{you just gonna leave 'em?}
<C>__{iris}
<P>__{(astonished)}
<D>__{what should i do? call the cops?}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{cops don't do nothin.}
<C>__{iris}
<D>__{sport never treated me bad, honest. never beat me up once.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{you can't leave 'em to do the same to other girls. you should get rid of them.}
<C>__{iris}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{travis}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{i don't know. just should, though.}

<D>__{god. i know where they should have a commune for you. they should have a commune for you at bellevue.}
<C>__{travis}
<P>__{(apologetic sheepish)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, iris. i didn't mean that.}
<C>__{iris}
<D>__{you're not much with girls, are you?}
<C>__{travis}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{well, iris, i look at it this way. a lot of girls come into my cab, some of them very beautiful. and i figure all day long men have been after them: trying to touch them, talk to them, ask them out. and they hate it. so i figure the best i can do for them is not bother them at all. so i don't say a thing. i pretend i'm not even there. i figure they'll understand that and appreciate me for it.}
<A>__{it takes iris a moment to digest this pure example of negative thinking: i am loved to the extent i do not exist.}
<C>__{iris}
<D>__{do you really think i should go to the commune?}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{i think you should go home, but otherwise i think you should go. it would be great for you. you have to get away from here. the city's a sewer, you gotta get out of it.}
<A>__{mumbling something about her "shades" again, iris fishes through her bag until she comes up with another 99 pair of sunglasses and puts them on. she likes these better, she decides.}
<C>__{iris}
<D>__{sure you don't want to come with me?}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{i can't. otherwise, i would.}
<C>__{iris}
<D>__{i sure hate to go alone...}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{i will give you the money to go. i don't want you to take any from those guys.}
<C>__{iris}
<D>__{you don't have to.}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{i want to what else can i do with my money?}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{you may not see me again for a while.}
<C>__{iris}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<A>__{close on c.u. of travis:}
<C>__{travis}
<D>__{my work may take me out of new york.}
