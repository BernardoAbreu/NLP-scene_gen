<A>__{the plateau. moonlight. wind shrieks over the exposed plateau, which is several hundred yards long. it cuts into the darkness like the prow of a ship and ends in empty air. a dozen cars are scattered about, defining a sort of runway in the center. there are twenty kids present, but very little talk. most of them belong to buzz's group but there are a few whom we have not met before. they stand in small clots, murmuring and smoking. the atmosphere is strung tightly, like the moments before a dawn attack. in b.g. near the cliff's edge, are two cars of similar make and model. they face away from camera toward the edge of the plateau. there are no headlights anywhere...blackout conditions. moose, a boy in a leather jacket and cheap yachting cap stands guard between the cars, his back to us. his hands are on his hips. his legs are spread. some girls drift in. another angle. plateau featuring plato as he wanders through the crowd searching for jim. he passes buzz's car where buzz, judy and the rest are eating hamburgers. they have all changed into fighting wardrobe.}
