<L>__{interior hotel basement later that night}
<A>__{partly crated props and costumes, luggage belonging to the departing film crew is piled against the wall and on shelves. in the cavernous half lit room, cameron, once again the coiled, stealthy animal, moves through the shadows among the racks of suitcases, pulling them aside, searching. discovering one, he sets it on the floor. it's locked. with a metal bar, he breaks the lock and eagerly rifles the contents. then, sensing a presence, he turns. there stands nina at the base of the steps watching him. with only a glance to her, he goes on with his search.}

<A>__{he finds a wallet, opens it, getting to his feet triumphantly.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{how about that for luck? burt's from idaho...no picture on the driver's license.}
<A>__{cameron stuffs the wallet in his pocket, moving along the row of suitcases. he pulls out a duffel bag, unzips it, shaking the contents on the floor. now with the open bag on his arm, he goes along the row of costumes and props like a man in the supermarket, stuffing in things he will need: a pair of hiking boots, a couple of work shirts, a heavy jacket. passing a shelf of bayonets, he picks one out and throws it in the bag.}
