<L>__{exterior ocean underwater day}
<A>__{blue, deep and featureless, the twilight of five hundred feet down. propeller sound. materializing out of the blue limbo is the enormous but sleek form of an ohio class ssbn ballistic missile submarine.}
<L>__{interior u.s.s. montana day}
<A>__{in the attack center, darkened to womb red, the crew's faces shine with sweat in the glow of their instruments. the skipper and his exec crowd around barnes, the sonarman.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{sixty knots? no way, barnes... the reds don't have anything that fast.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{checked it twice, skipper. it's a real unique signature. no cavitation, no reactor noise... doesn't even sound like screws.}
<A>__{he puts the signal onto a speaker and everyone in the attack room listens to the intruder's acoustic signature, a strange thrumming. the captain studies the electronic position board, a graphic representation of the contours of the steep walled canyon, a symbol for the montana, and converging with it, an amorphous trace, representing the bogey.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{what the hell is it?}
<C>__{exec}
<D>__{i will tell you what it's not, it's not one of ours.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{sir! contact changing heading to two one four, diving. speed eighty knots! eighty knots!}
<C>__{exec}
<D>__{eighty knots...}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{still diving, depth nine hundred feet. port clearance to cliff wall, one hundred fifty feet.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(simultaneously)}
<D>__{still diving, depth nine hundred feet. port clearance to cliff wall, one hundred fifty feet.}
<A>__{tension builds in the attack room as the montana surges to intercept the intruder. the exec tensely watches the vector graphic readout for the side scan sonar array. the sub is running uncomfortably close to the cliff walls.}
<C>__{exec}
<P>__{(low, to captain)}
<D>__{it's getting tight in here.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{we can still give him a haircut. helm, come right to oh six niner, down five degrees.}
<C>__{helmsman}
<D>__{coming right to oh six niner, sir. down five degrees.}
<C>__{navigator}
<D>__{port side clearance one hundred twenty feet narrowing to seventy five. sir, we have a proximity warning light.}
<C>__{exec}
<D>__{that's too damn close! we've gotta back off.}
<C>__{barnes}
<D>__{range to contact, two hundred. contact junked to bearing two six oh and accelerated to... one hundred thirty knots, sir!}
<C>__{exec}
<P>__{(really freaked now)}
<D>__{nothing goes one thirty!}
<A>__{suddenly the control room lights dim almost to blackness.}
