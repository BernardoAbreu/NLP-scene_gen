<A>__{an open suitcase on the bed. dick fingers a gold ashtray bearing the figure of winged victory then shrugs and tosses it into the suitcase on top of his gymnast's costume. when he looks up he sees bruce in the doorway behind him.}

<A>__{bruce reaches for a key in his pocket. without warning, the kid rushes him, throwing a rock solid punch. with blinding speed, bruce sidesteps him, parries the blow, and winds up spinning dick around into a wall. dick is stunned, but he has to laugh. this rich boy has a move or two. bruce stands there, silently challenging him. a second later, the kid is airborne upping the ante with a scissor kick aimed squarely at bruce's gut. in a blur of motion bruce checks the kick, swings an arm into dick's chest, and sends the boy sprawling flat on his back.}
