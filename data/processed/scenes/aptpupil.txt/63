<L>__{interior dussander's kitchen & basement evening}
<A>__{archie, seated at the table with his back to dussander, is in the middle of a sprawling monologue about his life to which dussander half listens. dussander goes to the cabinets and takes out two glasses. he pours the drinks and sets the glasses on the table. archie picks his up and is about to drink.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{ah ah.}
<A>__{dussander picks up his glass to toast archie. archie clinks his glass to dussander's and downs the shot.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{i believe we need another bottle, my friend.}
<C>__{archie}
<D>__{well if you're offering, i'm accepting.}
<A>__{dussander goes to the cellar door to retrieve another bottle.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{no trouble at all. now where is my bottle opener? ah, here it is.}
<A>__{dussander pulls something out of a drawer. he goes to the table and stands right behind archie.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{why don't you drink mine?}
<A>__{archie picks up the glass and begins to drink, slower this time. dussander pulls archie's tattered hat off his head and sets it on the table. he then begins to stroke the matted knots of archie's hair.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{you don't mind do you?}
<C>__{archie}
<D>__{no. i don't mind. ...maybe in the morning everything goes okay you could let me have ten dollars.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{perhaps.}
<C>__{archie}
<D>__{maybe even twenty.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{perhaps. we shall see.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{archie}
<D>__{you can relax, you know, i've done this before.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{it's all right. so have i.}
<A>__{dussander raises a meat fork up to the back of archie's neck. he starts to plunge it in just as archie turns back to look at him. the fork goes in crooked. archie explodes from the chair, howling, his arms flailing like those of a grizzly bear. with the fork protruding from his back, archie tosses the table to the side. the empty bottle tumbles to the middle of the floor and shatters. archie spins and slams a fist into dussander's temple. dussander collapses against the counter. archie moves about wildly, trying to grab the fork and pummel dussander at the same time. blood is streaming freely from his wound. dussander grabs a frying pan from a rack of drying dishes on the counter. as archie approaches, dussander swings the pan into archie's descending fist. archie winces and staggers backward. he stomps down on the broken bottle and screams. his guard falls briefly. dussander is upon him. he swings the pan, catching archie squarely in the face. archie brings his hands up to his face, which now oozes with blood. blinded by the blow, archie charges dussander, who crouches to the side, and as archie passes, hurls himself into the man's back, sending him through the open door of the cellar. archie flies down the stairs face first, tumbling into the packed dirt floor like a derailed train. dussander, exhausted and bloodied, exhales deeply. looking down at the crumpled body below, he straightens his tie, brushes the hair from his face, and then surveys the kitchen.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{what a mess.}
<A>__{he rises slowly and brushes himself off before heading down the steps to finish the bum for good. after about three steps he stops abruptly. he appears puzzled, but after a moment the expression changes. a look of searing pain rushes across his face. dussander brings his hand to his chest. he collapses on the stairs. he is having a heart attack and knows it.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{oh my god.}
<A>__{he looks down at archie, up to the kitchen, then back down to the cellar. a moment of decision. the stairs appear ten times longer in each direction than they did a minute ago. getting to his feet, he turns slowly toward the kitchen. he starts up the steps at a painfully slow pace, counting with each step.}
