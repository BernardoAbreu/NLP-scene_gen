<A>__{ethan crouches over a small fire built into a slit trench so that barely the glow of the flames can be seen. beyond him martin is leading their unsaddled horses away. the men have come to the end of another long day. both men look up as brad comes over a hill slope and rides recklessly down the incline to their camp. his horse is lathered.}
<C>__{brad}
<P>__{(shouting it)}
<D>__{i saw her!... i saw lucy!}
<A>__{martin runs to his side as brad slides off his mount. ethan moves more slowly.}
<C>__{brad}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{they're camped 'bout two miles over... i was just swingin' back when i saw their smoke... i bellied up a ridge an' they was right below me...}
<C>__{martin}
<D>__{did you see debbie?}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{no, but i saw lucy all right... she was wearin' that blue dress... an' she was walkin' along...}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(voice flat)}
<D>__{what you saw wasn't lucy.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{it was, i tell you!}
<C>__{ethan}
<D>__{what you saw was a buck wearin' lucy's dress...}
<P>__{(they stare at him)}
<D>__{i found lucy back there in that canyon... i wrapped her in my blanket an' buried her with m'own hands... i thought it best to keep it from you long as i could.}

<D>__{did they...? was she...?}
<A>__{ethan wheels on him in shouting fury.}
<C>__{ethan}
<P>__{(blazing)}
<D>__{what've i got to do draw you a picture?... spell it out?... don't ever ask me!... long as you live don't ever ask me more!}
<A>__{brad wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. he turns walking stiff legged as though on stilts back to his horse. he bends his head against the saddle, as though to hide his grief. martin turns away from him and walks back to ethan. and in that moment, brad mounts and takes off in the same direction from which he had ridden in.}
<C>__{martin}
<P>__{(frantically)}
<D>__{brad!...}
<A>__{they run for their horses.}
