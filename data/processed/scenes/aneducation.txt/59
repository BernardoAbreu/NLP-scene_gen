<L>__{54 ext interior car jenny' house. night}
<A>__{david pulls up in the bristol outside jenny's house, and they sit in the dark for a little while.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i suppose you have homework to do.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{gosh. yes. loads. (beat) thank you. i had a nice time.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(surprised, despite his speech earlier)}
<D>__{really? in spite of the, the incident? with the map?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{as you said in the car, it was a misunderstanding.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{exactly. a muddle.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you have no idea how boring everything was before i met you.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i hope that there's something more than excitement to our relationship.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{excitement's a lot, when you're at school and you live in twickenham.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you know what i'm trying to say. i want you to like me for who i am, not just what i can do for you.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{but that is who you are. i've never met anyone like you. action is character, our english teacher says.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i think it means that if we never did anything, we wouldn't be anybody. and i never did anything before i met you. and sometimes i think no one's ever done anything in this stupid country, apart from you.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{that's a good place to end the weekend. i will give you a tinkle.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{they look at each other. david is clearly smitten. he moves towards her. he wants to kiss her, but he doesn't want to frighten her in the end, jenny makes it easy for him and moves towards him. they kiss gently and tenderly. flustered, jenny breaks it off, gets out of the car and goes inside while david watches.}
