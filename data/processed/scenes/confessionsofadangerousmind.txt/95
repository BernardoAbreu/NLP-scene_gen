<L>__{exterior westminister abbey day}
<A>__{it's raining. a bored barris, dressed normally, waits with the fat bachelor under an umbrella near the entrance. the fat bachelor checks his watch.}
<C>__{fat bachelor}

<L>__{exterior church courtyard night}
<A>__{barris, in wig and moustache, stands in the middle of the empty, dark courtyard.}
<C>__{englishman}
<P>__{(loud whisper)}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{barris approaches.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{do you have it?}
<C>__{englishman}
<D>__{do you have it?}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{sorry. yeah.}
<A>__{barris reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out an envelope. the englishman takes it, opens it, pulls out a wad of cash and counts.}
<C>__{barris }
<D>__{don't worry, we're not gonna cheat you.}
<C>__{englishman}
<D>__{just the same.}
<A>__{the englishman finishes counting the money, pockets it, and hands barris a box of polaroid film.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{thank you. oh, one more thing.}
<A>__{barris pulls out his automatic with attached silencer and jams it into the englishman's mouth. the silencer breaks the man's front teeth. the man makes a muffled grunt.}
<C>__{barris }
<D>__{sorry about your teeth.}
<A>__{the englishman's eyes are wide with terror. barris pulls the trigger three times. the back of the englishman's head explodes. blood and hair and brain are spattered against the church wall. the englishman slumps to the ground. barris reaches into the man's jacket, pulls out the envelope of money, pockets it, and makes his way toward the churchyard gate. there stands the fat bachelor, watching, confused. after the initial shock, barris smiles warmly.}
<C>__{barris }
<D>__{it's ronnie, isn't it?}
<A>__{the fat bachelor nods.}
<C>__{barris }
<D>__{c'mere, ronnie. i want to show you something neat. it's okay.}
