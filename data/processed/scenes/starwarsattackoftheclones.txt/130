<B>__{artoo beeps}
<D>__{c 3po yes, it has been rather a long time. do you suppose something's happened to them?}
<A>__{artoo beeps and whistles.}
<D>__{c 3po}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{danger? oh no, i shouldn't think so. it looks a very dull planet to me. they should be back shortly. just stop worrying, artoo.}
<L>__{exterior geonosis, execution arena day}
<A>__{in the archducal box, amid the uproar, count dooku feels a tap on his shoulder. he turns to see mace windu standing behind him. count dooku masks his surprise elegantly as he surveys the arena and sees jedi knights standing at every entrance and exit.}
<C>__{count dooku}
<D>__{master windu, how pleasant of you to join us. you're just in time for the moment of truth. i would think these two new boys of yours could use a little more training.}
<C>__{mace windu}
<D>__{sorry to disappoint you, dooku. this party's over.}
<A>__{mace windu signals, and at stategic places around the arena there are sudden flashes of light as about one hundred jedi switch on their lightsabers. the crowd is suddenly silent. count dooku's lips curl in slight amusement.}
<C>__{count dooku}
<P>__{(to mace windu)}
<D>__{brave, but stupid, my old jedi friend. you're impossibly outnumbered.}
<C>__{mace windu}
<D>__{i don't think so. one jedi has to be worth a hundred geonosians.}
<A>__{count dooku looks around the great theater. his smile grows.}
<C>__{count dooku}
<D>__{it wasn't the geonosians i was thinking about. how well do you think one jedi will hold up against a thousand battle droids?}
<A>__{count dooku signals. thousands of droids start to pour into all parts of the arena. mace windu draws his lightsaber, jango fett draws his guns and fires at mace windu, who deflects the shots. jango fett and mace windu jump into the arena, where they fight. boba fett wacthes his dad and the jedi master fight. the battle beginss. geonosians fly away everywhere. droids fire at jedi, who deflect the bolts and cult down the droids. the geonosian troops fire ray guns that are more difficult for the jedi to deflect. the reek and the nexu are spooked by the battle. the reek bucks the riders off its back and stampedes around the arena, trampling droids and jedi that have moved into its path. padme picks up a discarded pistol and joins the fight. several jedi run to the center of the arena and toss lightsabers to obi wan and anakin. among the crowd, jedi cut down swaths of geonosians and droids. on the sand, jedi fight, attacking droids. obi0wan and anakin swing their lightsabers, cutting droids in half. padme blasts away at droids and geonosians.}
