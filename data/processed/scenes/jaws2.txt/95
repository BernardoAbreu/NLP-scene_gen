<L>__{exterior dockside day}
<A>__{the kids are into their boats, fitting out for a day of recreational offshore sailing. mike and andy are readying his tornado, while sean gets in the way. in the b.g., hendricks can be seen puttering around on the amity police boat.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{if you're beached, why are we doing this? for practice?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{then why are we futzing around the dock? we can make a few bucks working at the beach.}
<A>__{sean knocks something over, mike snaps at him.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{look if you're going to get in the way, you can just go home.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{i'm not in the way. andy, am i in the way?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{you're always in the way.}
<A>__{marge joins them, scooping sean up.}
<C>__{marge}
<D>__{this guy giving you any trouble?}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{put me down!}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{put him down in the water.}
<C>__{marge}

<C>__{andy}
<D>__{you've just made someone very happy.}
<A>__{marge and sean go over to her lightening. brooke and jackie come down the dock, dressed for sailing.}
<C>__{brooke}
<D>__{mike! are you going out?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i thought you were grounded.}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{i can go out if i want to.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{you can?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{you going to the lighthouse?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{i could give you a dozen good reasons.}
<C>__{mike}
<P>__{(to andy)}
<D>__{shut up.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{okay, okay, don't say i didn't remind you.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{is there room on your boat for all of us?}
<A>__{mike looks: andy, jackie, brooke, himself... timmy moves in, sensing the chance of a lifetime.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{well, we're pretty crowded, and i don't know when we're leaving...}
<A>__{timmy makes his move.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{i've got room.}
<C>__{brooke}
<D>__{great.}

<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{you will?}
<C>__{brooke}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{and she walks towards his boat, looking back for him to follow. he's dumbstruck by his sudden good fortune.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{fan tas tic!}
<A>__{he runs to join her, untying mooring lines like crazy; they're together again at last for the first time. andy is left shuffling with mike and jackie.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{i'm ready.}
<A>__{and she plops down in mike's boat, ready to be taken. anywhere.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{come on, you guys.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{well, i don't know...}
<A>__{jackie flashes him one of her pouty little smiles. why break one heart when you can break two? or more?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{please come with us?}
<A>__{mike is glaring. the message is clear, if unspoken.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{for me...?}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{what the hell. for you...}
<A>__{andy joins them. mike casts off, while andy helps, and jackie sits there, looking cute.}
<B>__{angle on larry and bob}
<A>__{watching what's going on.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{i thought you said she was going with us?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{let's just go sailing, okay?}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(casting off)}
<D>__{want to talk about it?}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{want to swim home?}
<A>__{bob gets the message and shuts up. the sizzler fills its sails, and points out of the harbor.}
<B>__{wide on the harbor}
<A>__{lots of day sailing kids, a few bigger, adult boats, some working fishermen and sport fishers; a typical recreational boating mix. the kids are finding the same general direction, pointing out of the harbor.}
<B>__{quick cuts}
<A>__{ sails being trimmed. brooke and timmy, staring into each other's eyes as he sets a course straight for the lighthouse. larry, lifting a hull, almost losing bob.}
