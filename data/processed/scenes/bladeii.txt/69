<A>__{bored to shit, scud plucks a joint from behind his ear. as he fires up his woman torso lighter we hear something just outside the van. scud kills the barry white, listening. silence. then, a faint skittering.}
<C>__{scud}
<D>__{um, whistler, you out there?}
<A>__{no response.}
<C>__{scud }
<P>__{(more urgently)}
<D>__{whistler?}
<A>__{still no response. scud reaches for a handgun and creeps into the front of the van. he looks out the windshield nothing. he looks left, then right nothing. unnerved, scud returns to the back of the van. he reaches for the handle of the rear door and abruptly jerks the door open, aiming the gun out there's nothing outside the van. but then scud hears the skittering again. his eyes shift apprehensively to the floor of the van below him.}
