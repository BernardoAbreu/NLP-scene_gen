<L>__{interior exterior dining room night}
<A>__{margot smokes by the open door. she drinks a glass of white wine. pauline eats from a left over chinese container.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{if it were someone else i'd understand it, i'd feel sympathy even. but since it's me, i just feel bad. and horribly critical. i haven't been able to tell claude what's happening. and i have to. i'm going to.}
<P>__{(frustrated)}
<D>__{how can i be all these people? how can i be married to jim. and fuck dick. and want them both and then neither of them...}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i know. we're at the age where we're becoming invisible to men and if a guy wants to fuck us, it's very tempting.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{what are you saying?}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{i'm saying, if you get your sense of self from being fuckable and that starts to wane it's very hard. i almost had an affair too. but you know, you don't have to do it. you can, i don't know, get a manicure or something.}
<A>__{margot grows furious. she turns to hide her face.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{you know i tell people you're my closest friend. i really miss you.}
<C>__{margot}
<P>__{(barely)}
<D>__{me too.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{but i can't help feeling that you really came to my wedding because i live a mile away from the guy you're fucking.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{come on, pauline. you make it sound like i'm using you.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{there is a long silence between them. finally, pauline indicates to margot that she has something in her nostril.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{you have a...}
<A>__{margot clears her nose quickly with her finger.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{did i get it?}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{yeah, i think so.}
<C>__{margot}
<P>__{(suddenly)}
<D>__{paul, what are you doing getting married to this guy? he's not good enough for you. he's so coarse, he's like guys we rejected when we were sixteen. you know...don't make a mistake like this.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, maybe i have no right to say that, but you know i'm truthful so... would you rather i lie?}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{who should i be with then?}
<A>__{a smashing sound. margot steps outside: two hooded figures turn over a recycling can, glass smashes on the ground. garbage is strewn across the driveway.}
<C>__{margot }
<D>__{hey! hey, you! you pick that up. i will call the police. this is our property. pick that up.}
<A>__{pauline remains seated at the table, stunned. margot comes back inside.}
<C>__{margot}
<D>__{creeps.}
