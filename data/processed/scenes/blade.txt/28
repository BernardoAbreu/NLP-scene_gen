<B>__{a large tank}
<A>__{filled with swirling blood plasma, choked with electrical leads and biomedical sensors. something floats within, suspended in the murky fluid a child , two or three years of age, drifting about like a medical oddity preserved in formaldehyde thump! the child slams up against the glass. karen backpedals, startled. its eyes are open now, pupils blown. it snarls, revealing a mouthful of razored fangs, trailing mouth slime across the glass as it futilely tries to chew its way through to karen. karen stifles a sob, turning and running right into blade, who now blocks the exit, sword in hand. karen retreats a step, wary }

<D>__{you shouldn't be here.}

<C>__{whistler }
<D>__{wandered off the beaten path, doctor?}
<A>__{whistler has entered the room from a second doorway. karen looks from whistler to blade, trapped between them }
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{who are you people?}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{my name is abraham whistler.}
<P>__{(re: blade)}
<D>__{this is blade. as for our little homunculus here }
<A>__{whistler limps over to the tank, rapping his cane against it. the creature snaps at it reflexively, following the silver tip back and forth like a fish after a lure.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{ he's a vampire.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{you're joking }
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{not at all. you're looking at a prime specimen of the homines nocturna.}
<A>__{whistler toys with the feral creature, engaging in a certain amount of sadistic delight as its efforts grow increasingly more frenzied. suddenly, it surges towards the top of the tank, clawing at the lid karen becomes alarmed but then a massive electrical jolt shocks the creature back into submission.}
<C>__{whistler}
<D>__{if blade hadn't brought you here, you would've wound up like him.}
<A>__{karen brings a hand to her bandaged neck, recalling the events of the previous night. she looks to blade.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{why did you help me?}
<A>__{blade scowls, his gaze flickering to whistler.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{stupidity.}
<C>__{whistler}
<P>__{(appraising her)}
<D>__{maybe not. i did some checking, she's a hematologist. knowledge like that might come in handy.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{it's not worth the risk. we can't trust her.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{because you're tainted. the venom's still inside you. you could still turn on us.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{what happens then?}
<A>__{blade looks to whistler as far as he's concerned, the debate's over.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{then i have to take you out, just like any other bloodsucker.}
<A>__{blade turns and exits. whistler and karen follow.}
