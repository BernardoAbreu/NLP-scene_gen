<A>__{milo watches new skywire code emerge from his printer. gary is in the doorway behind him: watching milo, scrutin izing him. sensing someone, milo turns and looks.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{gary, hi.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{you look a little tired.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i'm okay. it's going well!}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{'have a look?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{gary takes the page. as he reads it over:}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{why did you move around so much? when you were a kid.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{...my dad was a compulsive gambler. only he didn't think he was. that applied to guys who didn't have a "system." "losers," who played games of chance. he could "read" people, so chance had nothing to do with it. no matter how deep a hole he dug himself, he'd give you the whole speech. and you'd better not point out the obvious.}
<P>__{(he shrugs)}
<D>__{his creditors would catch up to him. loan sharks or whatever. he'd wake us in the middle of the night. off we'd go, again.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{what would you tell the kids? at your new school? you had to come up with a good story, right?}
<A>__{milo thinks: he's testing me.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{no. i just went deeper into the machine. preferred being the geek to having to explain. lying would've been worse.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{...worse?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{cause he was a liar. and i hated him.}
<P>__{(mimicking a voice)}
<D>__{"get your head out of that machine, wise up to the real world." the more he mocked me the deeper i went. cause if being savvy meant being like him }
<P>__{(he shrugs)}
<D>__{guess that's why i'm kind of clueless, even now. didn't cultivate my conniving side. 'not sure i even have one.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{don't be so hard on yourself. with a brain like yours, you could connive with the best of 'em i bet.}
<A>__{gary smiles. there's no way to read it.}
