<A>__{norman falls... looking up: the snake wrapped around the stanchion, slithering between the grid like posts. the snake's head comes at norman, as he falls to the ocean bottom. backpeddaling on his arms and feet. the snake, hissing, coming at him. it's long tongue flicking at him, inches from his faceplate. norman backpeddaling, can't breathe, the snake coming down on him, norman falls on his back, the tongue whipping across his faceplate, when... norman is whisked up. harry has him by the collar of his suit. taking him up.}
