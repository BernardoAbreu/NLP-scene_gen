<A>__{police cars are parked around. the activity has died down. doors on the coroner's van slam shut. in the back of a police car sits the waitress with the door open. a detective in a suit leans over the car door with his note pad.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{could you identify 'em, if ya saw 'em again?}
<C>__{lena }
<D>__{hal, i've told you about twenty times, yes, i could identify 'em, but neither one of them was the type to pull something like this.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{well, you're not exactly an expert witness, but what makes you so sure?}
<C>__{lena}
<D>__{if waitin' tables in a bar don't make you an expert on human nature, then nothin' will, and i could've told you that harlan puckett would end up buyin' it in a parkin' lot. i'm just surprised it didn't happen before now.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{who do you think did it?}

<D>__{lena, just cut the bullshit, will ya? do have any ideas or don't ya? i been standin' in this stupid parkin' lot all goddamn night, and i still got to go file a report before i can go home in time to get back up again!}
<C>__{lena}
<D>__{well, if i had to guess, i'd say it was some ol' gal, some ol' gal's husband. but it wasn't either one of those two. the tall one, the redhead, she left me a huge tip.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{you didn't happen to notice what kind of car they were driving?}
<C>__{lena}
<D>__{it's a nightclub, not a drive in, hal. i don't follow the customers to the parking lot.}
<C>__{hal}
<D>__{alright, lena. go on home. we might have to call you in for some more questioning.}
<A>__{lena gets out of the back of the car.}
