<A>__{and we see the soldiers at their posts... betty and the other camp women cleaning clothes and preparing food... and we see most of the children loitering around a tree in the shade, sullen, not playing on the playground. and then we see sam coming into the courtyard kicking a soccer ball... some of the children see him and pointerior.. and slowly the entire camp begins to notice sam kicking the soccer ball awkwardly by himself out in the open... betty and the other women stopping their chores and watching him, speaking to one another in arabic... deng and the other soldiers staring as sam pops the ball into the air and bounces it off his head... ... and now a couple of the smaller kids sprint for him and he kicks them the ball... and slowly the rest of the children join in the fun... kicking the ball back and forth... an impromptu soccer game... and then we hear laughter again... joy flooding back into this place. deng watching with a big smile as this white man dances around these little children... a pied piper of joy... playing in the dirt.}
