<L>__{exterior open sea day}
<A>__{the map dissolves slowly away as the barge spalasehs through five foot ocean swells in the open sea. the barge is crammed with equipment, the aav, trailers, a jeep, and the members of malcolm's team. on the boat, malcolm stands in the bow, riding the choppy seas. next to him, dr. juttson, fortyish, holds onto the railing, seasick. he shouts over the drone of the boat's engines.}

<P>__{(as the waves pound the boat)}
<D>__{couldn't we just airlift into the island?}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{dr. harding insisted we go by sea! helicopters are too disruptive. these aren't piles of bones you'll be studying this time, dr. juttson, they live, they breathe, and they react!}
<A>__{juttson looks at him skeptically and throws up. at the back of the boat, nick van owen, a good looking american in his late twenties, is sitting amid a pile of video cameras and other photographic equipment, playing with a game bow. sarah harding, dressed in field gear, sits down next to him.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{so what's your story, nick?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i was a cameraman for nightline for six years, been freelance since '91. do a lot of work for greenpeace.}
<C>__{sarah}

<C>__{nick}
<D>__{women. 'bout eighty percent female in greenpeace.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{very noble of you.}
<P>__{(of the noisy game boy)}
<D>__{you don't think you're bringing that thing onto the island, do you?}
<A>__{nick grins and shuts it off.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{hey, i wouldn't want to spook the woolly mammoths.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{you think this is all a joke?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{oh, please. how am i supposed to keep a straight face when }
<P>__{(gestures to the black clad malcolm)}
<D>__{ johnny cash here tells me i'm going to skull island?}
<C>__{sarah}
<P>__{(not amused)}
<D>__{ian's a very good friend of mine.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{he doesn't need a friend, he needs a shrink.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{i believe in him.}
<A>__{but her face says even she has her doubts.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{come on, there's only one reason any of us are here. his check cleared.}
<A>__{she looks at him.}
<C>__{sarah}
<D>__{drop the cynical pose. you can't pull it off while playing donkey kong.}
<A>__{the boat's captain, a costa rican, points ahead and shouts to them.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{there it is!}
<A>__{they all turn and look out over the bow. up ahead, shear, reddish gray cliffs of volcanic rock rise dramatically out of the fog heavy ocean.}
<C>__{captain }
<D>__{isla sorna!}
<A>__{the boat roars ahead, plowing into a heavy wreath of fog. the mist swirls and encircles it.}
