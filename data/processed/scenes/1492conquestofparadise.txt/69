<A>__{columbus strains his eyes; he still can not see anything. the entire crew stand and stare, silent, holding their breath. as the sun begins to rise, the fog dissipates slowly, exquisitely, revealing a single palm, so close it seems almost as though they could touch it. then a white slash of beach. near columbus, a sailor falls to his knees and burst into tears. others laugh with joy. columbus watches this vision in disbelief, his mouth open as if it were difficult for him to breathe. tears come to his eyes. he closes them. then opens them again. the land is there a green paradise. on screen the words: october 12, 1942. guanahan island}
