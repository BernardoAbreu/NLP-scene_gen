<D>__{beloved, she my daughter...she mine. she come back to me of her own free will and i don't have to explain a thing.. she had to be safe and i put her where i knew she would be. but my love was tough and she back now. she come back to me in the flesh...i won't never let her go. i will explain to her, even though i don't have to. why i did it. how if i hadn't killed her she would have died and that is something i couldn't let happen to her. when i explain she'll understand, cause she understands everything already..and she ain't even mad...when i put that headstone up i wanted to lay in there with you, put your head on my shoulder and keep you warm and i would have if bulgar and howard and denver didn't need me, because my mind was homeless then. i couldn't lay down with you then. no matter how much i wanted to. i couldn't lay down nowhere in peace, back then. now i can. i can sleep like the drowned, have mercy. she come back to me, my daughter,}
