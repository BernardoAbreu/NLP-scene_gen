<L>__{interior rwhs "a" building main corridor second}
<B>__{period}
<A>__{one of the fluorescent lights overhead flickers. the place is deserted except for a custodian who pushes a cresting wave of trash ahead of his broom. now trevor heads up the north stairwell at the far end of the corridor. he clutches the desecrated physical science book. a student slides down the banister past him.}
<L>__{interior counseling offices waiting area}
<A>__{a puerto rican woman prods a group of gangbanger wanna bes. two of the teens hover over a sony walkman, sharing the earphones.}
<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{okay, fellas, off the table. put the walkman away. i said put it away...}
<A>__{a 10th grade counselor's office opens and a student emerges. trevor walks directly in.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{walter, i need to speak with you.}
<A>__{walter (anglo; 52) is a disheveled middle aged counselor. a lifer. he chews on an empty smoking pipe as he glances through a student "cum" (cue mm).}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(preoccupied)}
<D>__{i'm pretty busy right now, garfield. what is it?}
<A>__{trevor sets the book down on walter's desk and nervously adjusts his glasses.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{could you open it, please?}
<A>__{walter opens the book.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(a weary look of disgust)}
<D>__{don't suppose this kid cares about our budget crisis?}
<P>__{(shuts the book)}
<D>__{have the textbook room charge him for the book.}
<A>__{walter snaps the book shut and looks up at trevor. that's all?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{one eight seven is a penal code number for murder, walter. means the same thing as t o s. 'terminate on the spot.'}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(piqued)}
<D>__{for chrissake, i know what it stands for. look, kid probably heard it in a rap song. doesn't mean anything.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{... the book belongs to dennis broadway. he's a known gangster, walter a 'five percenter.'}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{garfield, if i had a dollar for every time a student threatened faculty... don't you think you're overreacting a little?}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(suppressing trepidation)}
<D>__{did you tell dennis broadway he was getting a fail from me?}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(stymied)}
<D>__{i have legal access to those files.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{he's a transfer from nixon high school, isn't he?}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(becoming defensive)}
<D>__{look, i'm not obligated to track you down every time a transfer student comes through here. you want confidential information like that, come look it up in his cum (cue mm).}
<A>__{trevor exhales a sigh of resignation.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{do you have him on a contract?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{if he gets through the semester without a fail then he gets to go back to nixon, so what?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{... and be with his homeboys.}
<A>__{walter's caught between a rock and a hard place. his instincts lean toward self preservation.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{so he blew his opportunity. now he has to learn to live with the consequences.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i don't think this kid's ready to deal with the consequences. i think he wants me dead.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{relax, has nothin' to do with you.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{i should have been told, walter.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{hey, i'm on your side, garfield, but my hands are tied. kid has a right to his privacy... know what your problem is? you're an idealist.}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{what's wrong with that?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{you only see what you wanna see, that's what's wrong. on one hand you think someone's trying to kill you. on the other hand you actually believe kids are paying attention in your classes.}
<A>__{trevor resigns himself to the fact that he's come to the wrong person for support.}
<C>__{trevor}
<P>__{(collecting himself)}
<D>__{never mind. it's not a problem.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(an empty promise)}
<D>__{tell you what, as soon as i get a chance i will summons the kid. promise.}
<A>__{trevor's bemusement holds us.}
