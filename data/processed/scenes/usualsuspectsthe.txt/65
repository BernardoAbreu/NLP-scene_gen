<C>__{kujan}
<D>__{who is keyser soze}
<A>__{verbal looks up in shock. he drops his cigarette and trembles at the mere mention of the name.}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{ahhh fuck.}
<L>__{interior hollywood athletic club day two weeks prior 64'}
<A>__{keaton stands while the rest sit and listen.}
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{so i need to know if anyone can think of anybody. somebody with power. enough to possibly track us from new york. mcmanus look. we've been over it for an hour now. i say we pack up and run. let's go back to new york. at least get out of l.a.}
<A>__{suddenly, the sound of a man clearing his throat. everyone turns to the door behind them. mr. kobayashi a tall, slim, well groomed man stands in the hall. he has a briefcase in his hand. he smiles politely.}
<C>__{kobayashi}
<D>__{mr. keaton?}
<A>__{keaton stands back and lets him in. kobayashi looks them over.}
<C>__{kobayashi }
<D>__{i am mr. kobayashi. i've been asked by my employer to bring a proposal to you gentlemen. that must be mr. hockney. i recognize mr. fenster from his mug shot, as well as mr. mcmanus.}
<P>__{(to verbal)}
<D>__{i can only assume that you are mr. kinterior i believe you were the one who disposed of saul. my employer sends his gratitude. a most unexpected benefit.}
<A>__{everyone looks at one another in shock that he would know this.}
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{what can we do for you?}
<C>__{kobayashi}
<D>__{my employer requires your services. one job. one day's work. very dangerous. i don't expect all of you to live, but those who do will have ninety one million dollars to divide any way they see fit.}
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{who's your boss?}
<C>__{kobayashi}
<D>__{my employer wishes to remain anonymous.}
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{don't jerk me off. we all know what this is. you don't work with me if i work with you without knowing who i'm working for. now let's cut the shit. who's the man?}
<C>__{kobayashi}
<D>__{i work for keyser sate.}
<A>__{a strange look crosses keaton's face. skepticism, mockery and just a hint of fear. hockney, mcmanus and fenster all share similar looks.}
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{who's keyser soze?}
<C>__{kobayashi}
<D>__{i am sure you've heard a number of tall tales, myths and legends about mr. soze i can assure you gentlemen, most of them are true.}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{who's keyser soze?}
<C>__{kobayashi}
<D>__{judging by the sudden change in mood, i am sure the rest of your associates can tell you, mr. kinterior i have come with an offer directly from mr. soze. an order actually.}
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{an order.}
<C>__{kobayashi}
<D>__{in nineteen eighty one, mr. keaton, you participated in the hijacking of a truck in buffalo, new york. the cargo was raw steel. steel that belonged to mr. soze and was destined for pakistan to be used in a nuclear reactor. a very profitable violation of u.n. regulations. you had no way of knowing this, because the man shipping the steel was working for mr. sate without his knowledge. +}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{mr. fenster and mr. mcmanus hijacked a twin prop cargo flight earlier this year out of newark airport. the plane was carrying platinum and gold wiring. also set for pakistan.}
<A>__{kobayashi turns and points at hockney.}
<C>__{kobayashi }
<D>__{two months ago, mr. hockney stole a truck carrying gun parts through queens }
<A>__{everyone looks at hockney. he smiles shyly. it occurs to them all that he robbed the truck for which they were all arrested in the first place.}
<C>__{kobayashi }
<D>__{ guns allegedly set to be destroyed by the state of new york. they were to be "lost" in a weigh station and routed to belfast. again, mr. sate using pawns who had no knowledge.}
<P>__{(turning to verbal)}
<D>__{which brings us to mr. kinterior}
<A>__{verbal crumbles under his stare.}
<C>__{kobayashi }
<D>__{nine months ago, one of mr. soze less than intelligent couriers was taken in a complicated confidence seam by a cripple. he was relieved of sixty two thousand dollars. now}
<P>__{(to all of them)}
<D>__{ it has taken us some time to find you. our intention was to approach you after your apprehension in new york.}
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{you set up the line up.}
<C>__{kobayashi}
<D>__{mr. soze made a few calls, yes. you were not to be released until i came to see you. it seems mr. keaton's attorney, ms. finneran, was a bit too effective in expediting his release. holding the rest of you became a moot pointerior}
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{what about redfoot?}
<C>__{kobayashi}
<D>__{mr. redfoot knew nothing. mr. soze rarely t works with the same people for very long, and they never know who they're working for. one cannot be betrayed if one has no people.}
<C>__{fenster}
<D>__{so why tell us?}
<C>__{kobayashi}
<D>__{because you have stolen from mr. soze. that you did not know you stole from him is the only reason you are still alive, but he feels you owe him. you will repay your debt.}
<C>__{hockney}
<D>__{who is this guy? how do we know you work for soze}
<C>__{kobayashi}
<D>__{i don't think that is relevant, mr. hockney. the five of you are responsible for the murder of saul berg and his bodyguards. mr. redfoot can attest to your involvement, and we can see to it that he will. he is not of your "superior" breed.}
<C>__{mcmanus}
<D>__{this is a load of shit.}
<C>__{kobayashi}
<D>__{the offer is this, gentlemen. mr. soze's primary interest, as i am sure you all know, is narcotics. he's been competing shall we say, with a group of}
<C>__{kobayashi }
<D>__{argentinians for several years. competing with mr. soze has taken its toll. these argentinians are negotiating the sale of ninety one million dollars in cocaine in three days time. needless to say, this purchase will revitalize the diminishing strength of their organization. mr. soze wants you to stop the deal. if you choose, you may wait until the buy. whatever money changes hands is yours. the transaction will take place on a boat in san pedro. mr. soze wants you to get to the boat and destroy the cocaine on board. then you are free of your obligation to mr. soze.}
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{give me one good reason why i shouldn't kill you right now.}
<A>__{kobayashi smiles and puts his briefcase on the table in front of him.}
<C>__{kobayashi}
<D>__{a gift from mr. soze gentlemen.}
<A>__{he turns and walks out of the room. keaton walks over to the case and opens it. he reaches in and pulls out five thick manila envelopes, each marked in bold black letters. "keaton", "mcmanus", "hockney", "fenster" and "kint" keaton pulls out the files, revealing a map underneath. keaton hands each man his file. he opens his first. he pulls out a thick stack of papers and thumbs through them.}
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{jesus christ. open them.}
<A>__{all of the men open their files. inside are mug shots of each man in his respective file as well as a printout of his criminal record. but there is more.}
<C>__{hockney}
<D>__{they know everything. mcmanus this is my life in here. everything i've done since i was eighteen.}
<C>__{fenster}
<D>__{everybody i ever worked with, did time with.}
<C>__{hockney}
<D>__{they fucking know everything.}
<A>__{keaton pulls out a large black and white photograph of himself and his lawyer edie finneran. they are laughing arm in arm by a fountain in new york. he hides the photo from the others.}
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{this is not right.}
<C>__{fenster}
<D>__{i don't know. who was that guy that used to talk about soze in new york? mcmanus bricks marlin.}
<C>__{fenster}
<D>__{yeah. he said he did jobs for him. indirect stuff. always five times more money than the job was worth.}
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{come on. the guy is a pipe dream. this kobayashi is using him for window dressing .}
<C>__{fenster}
<D>__{i don't know. this is bad.}
<C>__{hockney}
<D>__{it's bullshit. this guy could be l.a.p.d. i think it's a setup.}
<C>__{fenster}
<D>__{the way i hear it, soze is some kind of butcher. no pity.}
<C>__{keaton}
<D>__{there' is no keyser soze}
<A>__{verbal thumbs through his file. a long list of names, numbers, addresses. it is a detailed portfolio of his entire criminal and personal life. he looks up at keaton.}
<C>__{verbal}
<D>__{who is keyser soze}
