<L>__{interior a stairwell.}
<A>__{nancy edges into the stairwell and looks down. looks like there's a fire somewhere down there, from the way the orange light dances. but there's only a low white noise.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{tina?}
<A>__{no answer. nancy starts down the stairs.}
<L>__{interior boiler room. day.}
<A>__{nancy comes off the stairs into a dank boiler room. the smear trail is there. it runs behind a cracking, red hot boiler the size of a diesel locomotive. everything about the place feels dreadfully wrong, and the music is deep into the nightmare theme when it pauses. tight on nancy. slow terror moves into her face. there's a low, sinister giggle. reverse in her pov we see a tangle of pipes, shadows, and the tainted fire of the huge boiler. then from behind this, deeply shadowed but still identifiable, steps tina's killer. the same filthy red and yellow sweater and slouch hat, the same melted face twisting into a smile, the same garbled laugh as he slides the long blades from beneath his shirt and fans them on the ends of his bony fingers.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{gonna get you.}
<A>__{the leering man brings the bloodied scalpel fingernails across his own chest, splitting a nipple. yellow fluid pours out. maggots and worms. nancy forgets the question jerks around and flees in blind panic into the first opening she sees a dark pipe tunnel.}
