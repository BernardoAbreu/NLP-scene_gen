<L>__{interior hotel room night}
<A>__{grace is in manic cleaning mode. she pulls papers off the walls. shoves a pile of clothing in the closet. sweeps coffee cups into a wastebasket. she opens the door for costa. he enters. the room is still a mess, but it feels safe, cozy.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm a pig.}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{i don't trust anyone who's too organized.}
<A>__{grace puts some music on the clock radio.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{want a beer?}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{she grabs a couple cold ones from the mini fridge.}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{which is it, are you a runner or chaser?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{what's that mean?}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{people like you }
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{people like me?}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{yeah, people like you. hardcore. gung ho people like you. and you know what i mean. people like you are either runners or chasers.}
<A>__{grace looks at costa.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{you are a trip, john costa.}
<A>__{he's not letting her off the hook. she plays along.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{okay. i guess i'm running and chasing.}
<A>__{costa reacts.}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i didn't know.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{growing up i quit speaking after that. i didn't say a word for three years. when you're not in the conversation, you get forgotten real quick. so i'd watch people. study them. the mouth can say anything, but the body doesn't lie. the tilt of the head, the way the hands move.}
<A>__{grace draws closer. costa watching her mouth.}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{how'd you get your voice back?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{the day my uncle died. the truth exploded out of me like a vision. my uncle and father had been arguing, there was a gunshot and my father was dead.}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{you are very intense, you know that?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i remember my uncle telling me not to say anything. and i didn't.}
<C>__{grace }
<D>__{i made myself forget why. the day he died my voice and my memory came back. i screamed for an hour. very primal. i haven't shut up since.}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{why did your uncle do it?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{land. great grandpa owned half of pennsylvania. my uncle wanted control and sold it all. all that's left is an old farmhouse and a horse pasture.}
<P>__{(sadly)}
<D>__{my father's murderer got away with it because i couldn't open my mouth.}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{that's a hell of a lot of responsibility for you to put on the shoulders of an eight year old girl.}
<A>__{grace blinks, looks at costa. that's exactly what she needed to hear.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{something good game out of it. the dead can't speak. now i'm their voice.}
<A>__{costa cups her face and kisses her. grace breaks away, a little hesitant. something is bothering her.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{martin asher is dead, right?}
<A>__{costa reacts.}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{can we please forget about him?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{that's the pointerior he's dead, so there won't be a trial where you or i would have to admit under oath that we did anything inappropriate.}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{we haven't done anything.}
<A>__{that's about to change. grace stands, pulls him off the couch. begins undressing him. she finds horrible dog bite scars.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{jesus.}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{in college we tried to make my friend's german shepherd take a bong hit.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{how mean. serves you right.}
<A>__{costa pulls grace to her feet. grace retreating. step by step across the room. costa. pursuing. slowly. determined. the heat. the immediacy building. costa grabs her. pushing her. up against the wall. the phone clatters to the floor. grace's eyes widen. two mouths. inches apart. costa's hand reaches up her skirt. exploring. grace swallows. his hand reaching into her panties. grace's eyes looking away. as she grabs his arm. pulling. pushing. wanting. her mouth. avoiding his. their breath mingling. until. costa's lips crush down on hers. the kiss devouring. knocking pictures off the walls. grace's hands pulling him closer. costa picks her up. throws her on the bed. he tears at her blouse. her white lace bra. grace's back arching. her legs wrapping around him. as her eyes flutter open. looking up at the ceiling, she gasps. costa stops. turns. to see what she's looking at. surprised to see pictures of asher's victims, the crime scenes. staring down at them. costa turns to grace, whispers.}
<C>__{costa}
<D>__{let them watch.}
<A>__{grace looking deep into costa's eyes. nods her head. costa flips her onto her stomach...}
