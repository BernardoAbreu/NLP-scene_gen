<A>__{she starts crying and hitting him harder.}
<C>__{sheila }
<D>__{fuck you!!}
<A>__{sheila's screaming is reverberating around the neighborhood. inside pete's mind the sounds are even louder. bill comes out of the house. claire is behind him waiting on the front porch. sheila beats pete and trips him to the ground. she is sobbing as she tears at him.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{sheila... stop...}

<D>__{why don't you two come inside and talk things over quietly... come on... come on in, sheila.}
<A>__{sheila gets to her feet crying. she looks down at pete, who remains lying on the front lawn. for pete, every word and every sound is loud and distorted. the droning sound returns.}

<A>__{pete pulls himself up.}

<D>__{you know who it is.}
<A>__{bill and claire have stopped in the living room watching pete. pete is going crazy with mr. eddy on one end, and his parents staring at him on the other. he waves his parents away, but they leave slowly and reluctantly.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{mr. eddy?}
<C>__{mr. eddy}

<C>__{mr. eddy}
<D>__{that's good, pete. hey... i want you to talk to a friend of mine.}
<A>__{pete can hear the phone being handed over to someone. there is a long silence. pete can hear breathing.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{we've met before, haven't we?}
<A>__{pete freezes. his mind is scrambling.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{i don't think so. where was it that you think we've met?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{at your house. don't you remember?}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{no. no, i don't.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{we just killed a couple of people...}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{pete can hear mr. eddy laugh in the background.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{you heard me... we thought we'd come over and tell you about it.}
<A>__{pete is getting pale with fear.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{what's goin' on?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{great question!! in the east ... the far east... when a person is sentenced to death... they're sent to a place where they can't escape... never knowing when an executioner will step up behind them and fire a bullet into the back of their head... it could be days... weeks... or even years after the death sentence has been pronounced... this uncertainty adds an exquisite element of torture to the situation, don't you think? it's been a pleasure talking to you.}
<A>__{pete can hear the phone being passed again.}
<C>__{mr. eddy}
<D>__{pete... i just wanted to jump on and tell you i'm really glad you're doin' okay.}
<A>__{the phone goes dead and pete sits fearfully pondering his fate. he hears a noise and turns. down at the far end of the hall he sees his parents staring at him. close up on parents staring in the direction of the living room as if sensing something, but not seeing. parents pov the hall and living room beyond. there is no one there.}
