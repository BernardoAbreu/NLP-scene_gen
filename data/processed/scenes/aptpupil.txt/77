<A>__{archie pushes the shovel in too far and can't retrieve it. todd grabs the other end and pulls it through.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{fuck this.}
<A>__{fed up, he comes around from under the stairs and confronts archie. archie sees him and takes a step toward him.}
<C>__{todd }
<D>__{i mean it get the fuck away from me.}
<A>__{archie steps closer. instantly, todd tightens his grip on the shovel. he is no longer afraid. he swings the shovel at archie's head striking him. archie staggers back, stunned, but then charges forward. todd strikes him again, this time with more force and anger. todd lifts the shovel to strike again, but this time catches the ceiling light with the metal blade. the glass shatters. the room goes black. a second later we hear a sharp, authoritative blow, followed quickly by another, then another.}
