<A>__{for a brief moment we still hear the cellos. and in the eye, the last of the fractals are spinning away, leaving us with the iris. a nice blue one. this is alex manning's eye.}

<A>__{this is a flashback, in case you're wondering. we'll continue to hear alex's voice as we move through the house in slow motion. everything is very bright and dreamlike. right now we're moving with the camera, slowly moving down a long hallway. at the end of the hallway is an open door. we stop at the doorway. we're afraid to go in.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{it's strange. when the future's in front of you, it seems to go on forever. i mean, you never really get there. it's always one step ahead of you. it's like there's no present. there's no "now". as soon as you think, "i'm here", the moment's already gone. either everything's in the future, or it's in the past.}

<D>__{there's no "now".}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{so where are you then?}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{i'm in the past.}
