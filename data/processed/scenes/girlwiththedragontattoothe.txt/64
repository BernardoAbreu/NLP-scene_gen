<A>__{but it's a knock that draws blomkvist awake. having forgotten where he is, he regards the cat sleeping with him, then the room, and groans. he pads to the door in the freezing cold. opens it to find a rugged older man on his doorstep with a handcart loaded with file boxes.}

<D>__{i'm gunner. the caretaker.}

<D>__{you're an author.}
<C>__{blomkvist}
<D>__{i'm writing a biography of mr. vanger, yes.}
<A>__{nilsson nods, but isn't sure he believes it. maybe he took a look inside the boxes before he brought them down.}

<D>__{i saw you on television.}
<C>__{blomkvist}

<A>__{blomkvist nods and hopes that's enough to put an end to the subject. it isn't.}
<C>__{nilsson}
<D>__{no jail time, though. that's good. cost you a lot of money though, yeah?}
<A>__{blomkvist shares his annoyance with the cat. nilsson dusts himself off, satisfied with the fire he's made.}
