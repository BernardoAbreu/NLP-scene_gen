<L>__{interior jeff's apartment night medium shot}
<A>__{lisa, still stretched out on the divan looking at jeff, suddenly sits upright and then getting up from the divan, mover over to jeff, the camera going with her. in a sudden surprise move, she swings his chair completely around so that his back is to the window. he drops the binoculars into his lap in surprise. the camera moves in as lisa leans over jeff, gripping both sides of his chair}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{jeff if you could only see yourself.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{now, lisa }
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(abruptly)}
<D>__{sitting around, looking out a window to kill time, is one thing but doing it the way you are }
<P>__{(she gestures)}
<D>__{ with, with binoculars, and with wild opinions about every little movement you see is, is diseased!}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{do you think i consider this recreation?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i don't know what you consider it but if you don't stop it, i'm getting out of here.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{you'd better before you catch the disease!}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(insistent)}
<D>__{what is it you're looking for?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{i want to find out what's wrong with the salesman's wife. does that make me sound like a madman?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{what makes you think something's wrong with her?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{a lot of things. she's an invalid who needs constant care and yet the husband nor anyone else has been in there all day.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{maybe she died.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{where's the doctor the undertakers?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{she could be under sedatives, sleeping.}
<P>__{(looks up)}
<D>__{he's in the room now.}
<A>__{jeff tries to turn around, but she won't let the chair move.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{lisa, please!}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{there's nothing to see.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{there is i've seen things through that window! bickering, family fights, mysterious trips at night, knives, saws, rope and since last evening, not a sight or sound of his wife! now you tell me where she is and what she's doing!}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{maybe he's leaving his wife. i don't know, and i don't care. lots of people have saws, knives and ropes around their houses. lots of men don't speak to their wives all day. lots of wives nag, and men hate them, and trouble starts but very, very, very few of them end up in murder if that's what you're thinking.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{it's pretty hard to stay away from that word isn't is?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{you could see all the things he did, couldn't you?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{what are you getting at?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{you could see that he did because he had the shades in his apartment up, and walked along the corridor, and the streets and the backyard?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{jeff, do you think a murderer would let you see all that? that he shouldn't keep his shades down and hide behind them?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{that's where he's being clever. acting nonchalant.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{and that's where you're not being clever. he wouldn't parade his crime in front of the open shades.}
<A>__{she turns the wheelchair slightly to her left so that he can see the newlyweds' apartment.}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{for all you know there's something a lot more sinister going on behind those shades.}
