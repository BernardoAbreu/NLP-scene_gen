<A>__{a huge jacuzzi is full of contented liberated lobsters, surrounded by the most amazing toy boat armada in history. we cut around the vast, opulent 20's apartment, scattered with unconscious revellers from last night. a mixture of old extravagance and modern excess, the place is stuffed with the toys of the boy who has everything: an old gun cabinet is stacked with enormous water rifles. a `bodyworlds' plastinated corpse is posed, swinging from a chandelier, a bottle of champagne in its hand. damien hurst's shark in formaldehyde is half out of its smashed tank, a reveller's feet protruding from its jaws. unconscious partygoers are slumped on plush seats in a home cinema themed to look like the set of `roadrunner', while a screen plays episodes of the cartoon. a naked couple lie in a sleeping embrace in a room converted entirely into a sandpit, complete with giant toys. big chicago marty, arthur's new driver, lies on a big sofa, consulting his sports pager. homeless robin is filling pans and antique vases with water. a huge photo of arthur modelling riding boots fills a wall, beside an old red london telephone box, converted into an aquarium, bubbling with colorful fish.}
