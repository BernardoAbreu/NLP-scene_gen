<L>__{interior moving car day}
<A>__{we see john at the wheel of his rover, sunglasses on, wind in his hair, fleeing from the scene of the crime. nadia watches him in the late sunshine, but john is too busy making a getaway to notice.}
<L>__{exterior country lane day}
<A>__{john's car shimmering as it comes over the brow of a remote country lane, surrounded by fields and rolling hills.}
<L>__{interior exterior car (moving) day}
<A>__{nadia puts a cigarette in her mouth and pops the dashboard lighter. john takes the cigarette and throws it out the window, followed by the lighter. nadia just gazes out of the window.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{so, uh, alexei, which i know isn't his name...}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{i don't want to talk about him.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{fine.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{it's none of your business.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{fine. absolutely. must be disappointing though. must come as a hell of a shock.}
<A>__{nadia ignores him.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{so uh...}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{look, if you want to know is he better in bed than you then yes he is.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oh jesus.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{if what you want to know is does he have a bigger cock than you, then yes he does.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(overlapping bigger)}
<D>__{of course. of course. of course he does. of course. thank you. thanks.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{but, you know, so what?}
<A>__{they drive.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{it's his baby i take it.}
<A>__{she doesn't answer.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{not the kids type then is he? not that broody. you must be pretty miffed.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{he will come back.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{he left me my passport and ticket. it's pretty clear he wants to see me again.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{yeah. i tend to tie up and abandon women i really want to see again too.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{no. but you tend to tie them up.}
<A>__{john freezes. he looks across. nadia gives nothing back.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{fuck off.}
<A>__{nadia is just looking at him.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{fuck off. you started it.}
<A>__{she is just looking at him.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't want to talk about it.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{shut up. i'm not listening.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{you don't want to talk about it.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{okay we won't talk about it.}
<A>__{nadia looks out the window.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{we'll pretend it never happened.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{so. what's it like having to fuck men you hate?}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{i don't hate you.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{okay. let's... okay. okay. you have had sex with people you don't like haven't you? for money. to make money.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{and? what are you saying?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{and. it's wrong.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{and who says what is wrong.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{and that would be morals. that would be one's own moral sense of decency.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{what's a moral orgasm john? tell me how it feels exactly.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{so. what then? you just detach sex from everything..}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{whereas "wet 'n' wild" is an emotional journey. "tied and tethered". it's pretty moving huh? like anna karenina.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{listen. i didn't go rooting around in your private stuff.}
<A>__{john remembers he did. nadia looks across knowingly.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{funny. usually it's the first thing they do.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{so what? do you just switch off in your head or do you imagine you're with him, or what?}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{sometimes.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{sometimes which?}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{sometimes neither.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{some... what does that mean?}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{there's nothing wrong in liking sex, john.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i don't like sex. i don't think i will be having sex ever again.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{well, it's just that the thought trying to charm up an erection in front of a woman, or alone for that matter, makes me want to die.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{so now you hate all women?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i think it's my safest bet, don't you?}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{oh. i think you will recover okay. i think you got what you paid for.}
<A>__{john looks across.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{you...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i got what i paid for.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{you didn't mind too much.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{it wasn't what i wanted.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{so what did you want? i think we understand each other, no?}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{you don't understand me.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{you don't understand you either.}
<A>__{john turns to her.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{it's no big thing. you are the same as most men. you are a man so you are a savage. not a monster, but half animal. you put on a tie and you go to the bank, but really you are a beast. but also you are from woman so you have a soul. half beast, half soul. but you hide your beast in the bottom of the wardrobe. it's not so healthy. it's fucked you up, no?}
<A>__{john stops the car.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{get out.}
<A>__{she sits there.}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{get out}
<C>__{nadia}
<D>__{you are throwing me out.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{get out.}
<A>__{she collects her bag from the back seat, her cigarettes, gathers up her belongings, clicks open the door and gets out, leaving the shot. john sits there staring ahead. we hear her voice offscreen.}
<C>__{nadia }
<D>__{you prefer your women mute.}
<A>__{john turns the key in the ignition. the engine bellows and screams. silence. he tries again. the engine shrieks and wails like a soul in torment. a terrible, mournful grinding noise. silence.}
<C>__{nadia }
<D>__{car trouble?}
<A>__{john tries to start it. it lets out a whimper, a crying, a few juddering moving sobs, and dies. john sits in his dead car. he shakes his head. he rubs his face. he sits there.}
