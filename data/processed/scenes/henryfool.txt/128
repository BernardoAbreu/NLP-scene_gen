<L>__{interior hospital waiting room night}
<A>__{henry is asleep on a row of waiting room chairs, exhausted. simon comes running up the hall and finds him. it's late and no one is around. he sits down beside henry and shakes him. henry wakes.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{simon? you're here.}
<A>__{he sits up and simon sits beside him.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(coughs)}
<D>__{it's a boy.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{and fay?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{she's alright.}
<A>__{simon sits back, relieved. then he remembers the rain soaked shopping bag he has with him. he pulls out a couple of cans of beer and hands one to henry.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{they look around, seasoned conspirators and make sure the coast is clear. then they pop open the beers and toast. they drink. then...}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{how did it go?}
<A>__{simon pauses, scared, then gets up and crosses the room. he looks out of the window and gathers his strength.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{listen, henry, angus james didn't like your 'confession'.}
<A>__{henry looks at simon blankly, then blinks and looks away.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{ah. i see. well, what now?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{did he suggest changes?}
<A>__{silence. simon comes back and sits again.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{no. he didn't.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i mean, after all, there are things i can do to make it more accessible.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{accessible?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i can soften up some of the language and make it read easier. take out some of the more intratextual references and popularize the underlying sturm und drang, so to speak. i can change its mode. make it more of a conventional novel instead.}
<A>__{simon just stares at him blankly, then sighs and shakes his head.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{no. don't.}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{oh, simon, don't be such a purist! i appreciate your protectiveness, but the integrity of the work gives it a durability that can sustain such things.}
<A>__{simon comes over and lays his hand on henry's shoulder.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{no. really, henry. don't.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{what are you saying; that it doesn't merit revision?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i'm saying... angus james didn't like it.}
<A>__{he steps away and sits. henry pauses, then approaches and leans down over him.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{well, did you tell him what you think?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{what i think doesn't matter.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{yes, it does. you've got to use your influence with him.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i gave it to him to read and he hated it. what more can i do?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{you can refuse to let him publish your poem.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i can't do that.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{you said you would.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{that was before i read your book.}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(hit hard)}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(looking up at him)}
<D>__{i signed the contract, henry.}
<A>__{henry stands there a moment longer, then lowers himself into the nearest seat, weakened.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{look, henry, what did you expect?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i... i don't know. honesty, perhaps.}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(indignantly)}
<D>__{look, if i had told you, when at first i read it, that i thought it was no good, what would you have done?}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i would have respected your opinion.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{and insisted that there's no accounting for taste.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{well, is there?}
<A>__{simon's words catch in his throat. he turns away, frustrated.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i don't know. i didn't bring it to angus because i thought it was good. i brought it to angus because you're my friend.}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(staggered)}
<D>__{oh how perfectly enormous of you, simon.}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(explodes)}
<D>__{look, henry, i did it! i wrote. i wrote poetry because you told me to! i worked! i worked while you sat back and comfortably dismissed the outside world as too shallow, stupid and mean to appreciate your ideas.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{is that such a priority? is that some sort of measure of a man's worth? to drag what's best in him out into the street so every average slob with some pretense to taste can poke it with a stick?}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(sits, tired)}
<D>__{maybe. maybe it is.}
<A>__{henry just stares at him, stands, then turns on his heel and waves him off.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{you must be pretty impressed with yourself, huh? the all too obviously talented new man, the important new voice, the early clue to a new direction, or whatever, etc., etc., etc! a popular new trend conveniently packaged for the distracted young herd! you want to be liked more than you know, simon grim! you'd be nowhere without me and you know it.}
<A>__{simon hangs his head, destroyed.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i'm leaving.}
<A>__{henry is scared all of a sudden. but he puts on a defiant exterior.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{yes. it's time you left.}
<A>__{he stands, drinks and walks over to the window...}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{i saw you for what you were in the beginning, simon. i hold no grudge and i'm certain you will, in time, leave some serious and small dent in this world.}
<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(weakly)}
<D>__{the world is full of shit.}
<A>__{henry take advantage of simon's disillusionment and puts on a big show of secure wisdom.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{the world is full of shit. it's true. and you have to walk through it. that's your part. i'm sorry. but you're no good at it. perhaps i'm not. perhaps i wasn't made to walk through shit. go on now. leave. do what you're good at. go.}
<A>__{simon sits there a moment, numb with grief. henry, red in the face, stares at the floor. suddenly, simon stands and walks out. henry looks up and watches him go. he can hardly believe it. he almost raises his voice and apologizes, but can't. he lowers his head again and covers his face with his hands, listening to simon's footsteps receding through the halls. simon walks on, away from us, down the hospital corridor.}
