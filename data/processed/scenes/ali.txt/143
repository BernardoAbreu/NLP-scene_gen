<D>__{put me on, howard.}
<C>__{howard cosell}
<D>__{muhammad, i'd do anything for you. but i got bosses who only give a damn about nielsen ratings.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{i guarantee...it will be a historical and momentous night!}
<L>__{interior abc tv studio}
<A>__{ali being interviewed by howard cosell in the "wide world of sports" set. we've entered mid scene...}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{...what heavyweight champion of the world? i'm not the champ. i am retired, finished, out of the game. and i ain't gonna let myself grieve and suffer none. but i know i will not fight again...}
<C>__{howard cosell}
<D>__{i thought you were resolute in your resolve to regain your crown...}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{if tomorrow they say: "we want you to fight joe frazier. madison square garden. millions and millionses of dollars. here's your license back." i will tell them: "i am sorry, but i am done."}
<C>__{howard cosell}
<D>__{what about frazier?}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{you'll have to wonder...what me and smokin' joe would have looked like.}
<C>__{howard cosell}
<D>__{you surprise me, muhammad...}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{howard, you losing your hearing along with your hair? don't put questions to it!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i am through fighting. 'cause i got a bigger and more important match comin' up. the u.s. government. a heavier contender.}
<C>__{howard cosell}
<D>__{do you think you're going to jail?}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{i don't know, but it's going to be a shocking and terrible fight. in fact, they might wish they let me stay in boxing.}
<C>__{howard cosell}
<D>__{joe frazier told me on this show he would knock you out.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{there you go, agitatin'.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you ask smokin' joe what he been smokin'?! joe frazier even dream he can whup me? he better wake up and apologize...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{but, if i was to jump in the ring with joe, here's what you might see...}
<P>__{(recites)}
<D>__{ali comes out to meet frazier, but frazier starts to retreat; if frazier goes back an inch farther, he'll wind up in a ringside seat; ali swings with a left, ali swings with a right. frazier keeps backin', but there's not enough room. it a matter of time before ali lowers the boom; now ali lands with a right, what}
<C>__{ali }
<D>__{a beautiful swing, but the punch lifts frazier clean out of the ring. frazier's still risin', but the referee wears a frown, 'cause he can't start countin' 'til frazier come down. and frazier's disappeared from view. and the crowd is getting frantic. then our radar stations pick him up. he's somewhere over the atlantic. who would have thought when they came to this fight, that they would witness the launching of a black satellite?}
<A>__{there's laughter off camera in the studio and a wry smile on cosell's face.}
<C>__{ali }
<D>__{but don't wait for they fight. 'cause it ain't never gonna happen. you only can wonder and imagine...}
<A>__{the phones in the master control booth and ringing off the hook...the public's reaction to ali's bre'r rabbit routine. ali used his ability to command presence in media to promote the only fight the public wants to see...}
