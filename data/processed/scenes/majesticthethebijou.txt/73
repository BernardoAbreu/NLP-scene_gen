<D>__{i take breakfast and supper at mabel's every day except sunday. have for years, since lily died. if it weren't for mabel, i'd probably starve to death.}
<A>__{ernie cole, a slight, balding man in his 50s, is locking the door of his pharmacy across the street, when he spots harry and luke.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{harry! hold on a second!}
<A>__{ernie runs across the street and, slightly winded, stands before luke, staring. luke shoots a glance at harry, who taps ernie on the shoulder.}

<C>__{ernie}
<P>__{(agape)}
