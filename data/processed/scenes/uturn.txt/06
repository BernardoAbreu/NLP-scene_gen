<L>__{exterior fork in the road day}
<A>__{the car rolls into a fork in the road, limping with the droop of an animal that won't make another hundred yards. one sign on the larger road says "globe" is 29 miles away. the other sign, on the lesser road, tells us "superior" is only 2 miles. a third sign confirms his destiny with "gas, food, 1 mile." bobby seems to have no choice. he aims the car down the lesser road towards "superior, arizona."}
