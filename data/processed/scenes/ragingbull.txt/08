<D>__{this looks done.}
<C>__{irma}
<D>__{it's not done.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{it looks done. i will take it the way it is.}
<C>__{irma}
<D>__{here's your steak. you can't wait for it to be done. here.}
<A>__{she slams the steak onto his plate, and reaches back to the stove.}
<C>__{irma }
<D>__{here's your carrots. you're in such a hurry. you can't wait.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{no, i can't wait. you know when i wait? when it's important to wait. it's not important to wait for no steak. it's important to wait for reeves to leave the ring. it ain't important to wait for no steak! i won that fight. so, i stayed in the ring, and that way i made sure everybody knew it. i shoulda knocked him out earlier, sonofabitch.}
<A>__{he starts to eat the steak. he takes a drink of wine.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{wait! i will wait. but let me tell you, if this steak was the middleweight championship, i'd show you how i'd wait. i'd eat it raw. i'd drink the blood. i'd eat it before it came out of the cow that's how i'd wait.}
