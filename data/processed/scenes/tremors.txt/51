<A>__{it's hours later. stiff and uncomfortable, they have nothing to do but theorize.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{there's nothing like them in the fossil record, i'm sure...okay, so they predate the fossil record...}
<P>__{(not buying it herself)}
<D>__{that'd make them a couple of billion years old...and we've just never seen one till now. right.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{i'd vote for outer space. no way those are local boys.}

<D>__{atomic testing. or, no, bio engineering! the government built them, a big surprise in the next war.}
<A>__{there's a long pause. earl stares at the dirt around the rock.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{well...haven't seen a sign for hours. maybe it's long gone.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{maybe it is. why don't you take a little stroll and see?}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{fuck you, too. pardon my french.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{well, we've got to do something .}
<A>__{val gets an idea. he grabs a post from the dilapidated fence and cautiously slips down near the boulder's edge.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{watch yourself! it's got a good six foot reach.}
<A>__{val nods. dead silence as he reaches way out with the post and scrapes it on the ground. almost instantly the creature roars up, grabbing the post in a flurry of flying dirt and lashing tentacles, nearly hooking val's hand. val practically falls over himself scrambling back to safety.}

<D>__{son of a bitch!}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{son of a god damned bitch! been waiting there all this time. how the hell's it even know we're still here?}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{it's been listening to us. it's got no eyes. it sure as hell can't smell anything underground, so i figure...}
<A>__{rhonda stares at val, impressed.}
<C>__{rhonda}
<D>__{of course! it can sense the slightest seismic vibration...hear every move we make. especially on this rock. it's a perfect conductor.}
<A>__{they all settle back, having no idea what to do nexterior rhonda gazes out at the desert that surrounds them like an ocean.}
<C>__{rhonda }
<D>__{i always wanted to be stuck on a desert island. but somehow i always imagined, you know, water.}
