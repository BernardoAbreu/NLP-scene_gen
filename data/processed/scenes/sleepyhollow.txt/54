<A>__{ichabod and katrina lead their horses. a heated argument.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{why would you do such a thing?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{no stone may be left unturned. it may appear harsh...}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{i have misjudged you i think. i did not imagine you were so cruel.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{you are not regarding it in full. the widow windsor had been run through by a sword. i followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path i could not comprehend till i had seen the horseman with my own eyes.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{what are you on about?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{the child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing. the sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{must i hear this?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{there was no blind stabbing. this singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{and this gives worth to butchery?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{it was not butchery.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{what is it then? scientific method? how can any of this matter in the slightest?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{i have no solution for its meaning yet, but i could not just ignore it.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{take a lesson from young masbath's desires, ichabod crane. he follows with you to avenge his father's death. that i understand. but, what do you want?}
<C>__{ichabod}
<D>__{to avenge his father, and the others.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{but, why? tell me why.}
<A>__{ichabod struggles for a reply.}
<C>__{katrina}
<D>__{you falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it. can't you see? you'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it.}
<C>__{ichabod}
<P>__{(fed up, growing anger)}
<D>__{if it had been surgery on a living person, done to save that person's life, you would not question it. not for a moment. so, let me be the first to tell you, dear girl... on the other side of these sheltering mountains, a whole world has advanced beyond such plebeian thinking as yours. and someday, no matter how much you fear it, that world will come to roust sleepy hollow out of its slumber.}
<A>__{katrina storms away. ichabod's already regretting.}
