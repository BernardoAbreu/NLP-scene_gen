<L>__{interior police squad room day}
<A>__{a typical police squad room... smoke filled, cluttered, busy. arch sits at a desk doing paperwork, surrounded by the gang members... who are also filling out papers. arch sings to himself, munching on nachos from a big pile of chips. the gang members harmonize with him. a gang member reaches for a nacho chip. arch grabs for the gun in his shoulder holster.}
<C>__{arch}
<D>__{uh uh.}
<A>__{the gang member drops the chip. arch pops it in his mouth, continues singing. the gang members join in with harmony. ned enters in the background, carrying a box with airholes in it. he steps over to his desk, looking at the singing gang members, then motions like a choir leader, cutting them off neatly.}
<C>__{ned}
<P>__{(doubtful)}
<D>__{you do all my paperwork?}
<A>__{they all hand over their completed paperwork. ned stares at them for a beat... surprised.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{get out of here.}
<A>__{they do. he opens the files... checks out the papers. arch notices something o.s. and gets up.}
<C>__{arch}
<D>__{and a damn good job, too. one of 'em even did it in spanish.}
<A>__{arch turns the sound up on a wall mounted tv monitor.}
<C>__{arch}
<D>__{hey ned! catch this! friend of yours.}

<C>__{max }
<P>__{(on t.v.)}
<D>__{...i'd like to reach down ned ravine's throat and pull out his guts with my bare hands!}
<C>__{arch}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{jesus... you hear that?}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{he's just working through his anger, trying to find a constructive outlet.}
<C>__{arch}
<D>__{are you kiddin'! he'll do it! the guy's a friggin' looney!}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{trust me, i spent a lot of time with him when i was preparing his case. he's really a very sweet, sensitive human being.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(on t.v.)}
<D>__{i'd like to mash his head like a ripe melon...}

<C>__{ned}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{see. loves to exaggerate.}
<A>__{arch slumps in his chair, really stunned.}
<C>__{arch}
<D>__{christ, ned... you're in deep shit.}
<A>__{ned laughs it off. he starts checking through the messages and paperwork on his desk. the phone rings. he picks it up.}
