<A>__{a tiny figure lies slumped beside the inert rov, an indian dying with his horse in the desert. bud's eyelids close. his chest barely moving. a strange illumination bathes his face and his eyes open. he blinks. weakly, he raises his head, facing the source of the radiance. bud's pov... a glowing figure hovers before him, like a vision. it seems to be an angel. seen closer, as it drifts toward him, we see that it is an extraterrestrial being, bioluminescent like some deep sea fish. its body and limbs are transparent, and it resembles a figure made of blown glass. a delicate mantle or veil billows out around its like a corona, which pulsates gently, propelling the being with the hypnotic grace of a spanish dancer. the head is refined and strangely anthropomorphic, with large eyes that convey a cold, dispassionate wisdom. it is stunningly beautiful. the creature settles toward him. unafraid, bud extends his hand. its slender, blown glass digits grasp his bulky glove. it pulls him up from the benthic ooze and they glide together down the slope, deeper into the abyss. at the limits of visibility we see faint, glowing forms moving below. they resolve into nti ships. tiny ovoids, like the little scoutship that lindsey nearly collided with at the montana wreck. the larger manta ships. and others, strangely configured, moving in the darkness below like luminous fish. suddenly the darkness explodes with light. a vast, reticulated pattern of brightly glowing lines, like some enormous circuit diagram, appears below them, covering the floor of the abyssal trench. it sweeps outward from the center, as if the light were surging through channels. the ntis are revealing their home to bud. the ships move among the spires like air traffic over a major city.}
