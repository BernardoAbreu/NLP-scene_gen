<L>__{interior police station}
<A>__{easy's head sags down as he's dragged through the front door past blurred blue bodies that talk.}
<C>__{policeman }
<D>__{you got 'im, huh, miller?}
<C>__{miller }
<D>__{yeah, we got him coming home. nothing on 'im.}
<A>__{a door opens and easy finds himself being flung inside.}
<L>__{interior interrogation room}
<A>__{on his knees he hears the door close and looks up at a single, bare wooden chair resting on the corroded linoleum floor. he crawls to one of the urine stained corners, and looks down on a dry, flat corpse of a mouse. he pushes his shoulder against the unpainted plaster until he's standing and then stumbles over to the chair and sits. he looks up at the bare pipes that run along the ceiling, dripping water, and at a window with criss cross chairs instead of glass framing, overgrown branches and leaves pushing their way in. the door opens and miller comes in first carrying a notebook.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{ezekiel rawlins.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<A>__{mason follows and closes the door.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{we can take off the cuffs if you wanna cooperate.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{i'm cooperating.}
<A>__{miller motions to mason and he removes the cuffs.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{where were you this morning at about five a.m.?}
<C>__{easy}
<P>__{(stalling)}
<D>__{what do you mean?}

<C>__{easy}
<D>__{i don't know... i was out drinkin' and i helped carry a friend home. i could've been on my way home... i don't know... i didn't look at a clock...}
<C>__{mason}
<P>__{(wandering over)}
<D>__{he didn't look at a clock.}
<A>__{whock! easy takes a fist to the ear and struggles to keep his balance, wiping away blood streaming down.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{you were drinkin' down on eighty ninth and central... at an illegal club called john's, weren't you?}
<A>__{mason moves again but this time easy turns to face him and the fat man looks back with an innocent face, his palms turned up.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{you may as well answer 'cause you got bigger troubles than us bustin' an illegal bar, ezekiel.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{what do you mean? what's goin' on?}
<A>__{mason has taken off his shoe and is swatting it against the palm of his hand.}
<C>__{mason}
<D>__{means we can take your black ass out behind the station and put a bullet in your head.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{now. what time did you leave coretta james' house this morning?}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{i guess about five... five thirty...}
<A>__{miller and mason glance at each other, and mason kicks the chair over toward easy.}
<C>__{mason}
<D>__{sit down.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{why, i'm gonna sit down and you keep trying to knock me down?}
<A>__{but he sits down anyway.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{did you go back and see miss james later in the day?}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{no, sir.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{did you and dupree brouchard have words over miss james?}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{mason}
<D>__{you heard 'im. did you two argue over coretta james?}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{naw. he was asleep.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{she went to sleep too, ezekiel. but she won't be waking up...}
<A>__{easy's face goes sick...}
<C>__{miller}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{where'd you go when you left miss james' house?}
<A>__{easy is too stunned to answer.}
<C>__{mason}
<D>__{you heard him, where'd you go?}
<A>__{easy stares into space, answering in barely a whisper.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{i went home with a hangover...}
<A>__{choonk! choonk! mason fires off two punches and easy grabs his wrists and pulls him down to the floor, swinging around, straddling mason sitting on his ass... miller's police special presses into easy's temple and miller speaks to him quietly, deadly.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{get up slow... real fuckin' slow or you know what's gonna happen.}
<A>__{easy raises his hands and uncoils to his feet, backing away cautiously. mason is winded and furious.}
<C>__{mason}
<D>__{okay. let's take him out back.}
<A>__{he gets to his feet and reaches for his gun, but miller stops his hand.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{no. let's go.}
<C>__{mason}
<D>__{bullshit, i'm gonna blow his }
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{let's go!}
<A>__{he pushes mason toward the door.}
<C>__{mason}
<D>__{son of a bitch! son of a bitch!}
<A>__{they exit the door and easy rubs at his bloody ear.}
