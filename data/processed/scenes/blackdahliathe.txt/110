<L>__{interior the interrogation room same}
<A>__{harry circles red manley, lightly tapping a metal studded sap in his hand.}
<C>__{lee}
<P>__{(re the sap)}
<D>__{russ's only rule. no actual hitting.}
<A>__{back inside the interrogation room same harry leans close to red, tapping the sap on the table. his stutter completely gone.}
<C>__{harry sears}
<D>__{you wanted some fresh gash, and you thought betty was easy. you came on strong and that didn't work. you offered her money. she told you she was on the rag, and that was the final straw. you wanted to make her bleed for real }
<C>__{red manley}
<D>__{no no no. not betty }
<A>__{harry smashes the sap onto a glass ashtray, shattering it. red bites down on his lip, cutting it.}
<C>__{harry sears}
<D>__{you plied betty with drinks, got her to talk about her old boyfriends and came on like a pal, like the nice little corporal willing to leave betty to the real men, the men who saw combat }
<C>__{red manley}
<D>__{no }
<A>__{harry smashes the table again.}
<C>__{harry sears}
<D>__{you took her to a toolshed, maybe one of those abandoned warehouses out by the old ford plant in pico rivera. there was some twine and lots of cutting tools lying around, and you got a hard on...}
<C>__{red manley}
<D>__{no no no }
<A>__{again harry smashes the table. red almost topples his chair backwards out of fear, only harry's hand an the back slats keeping it from going over...}
<C>__{harry sears}
<D>__{yes, reddy, yes. you thought of every girl who said "i don't suck", every time your mommy spanked you, every evil eye you got from real soldiers when you played your trombone in the army band.}
<C>__{red manley}
<D>__{no }
<C>__{harry sears }
<D>__{goldbrick, needle nick, pussy whipped }
<C>__{red manley}
<D>__{no }
<C>__{harry sears}
<D>__{that's what betty had to pay for wasn't it?}
<C>__{red manley}
<D>__{no, please! god as my witness!}
<C>__{harry sears}
<D>__{god hates liars!}
<A>__{smash!}
<C>__{harry sears }
<D>__{tell me, red! tell betty! tell god!}
<C>__{red manley}
<D>__{i didn't hurt her }
<C>__{harry sears}
<D>__{tell god!}
<A>__{harry smashes the sap down the table once more and then hurls the whole thing over onto its side. red fumbles out of the chair onto his knees. he clasps his hands together }
<C>__{red manley}
<D>__{the lord is my shepherd, i shall not want...}
<A>__{he begins to weep. completely broken. harry turns to the one way mirror, looking straight out at his audience: self loathing etched into his flabby, juicehound face. he gives the thumbs down sign and walks out of the room.}
<B>__{outside in the hallway}
<A>__{russ millard meets him at the door and leads him away from the general crowd of officers.}
<B>__{back in the interrogation room}
<A>__{bucky watches as lee and another officer handcuff red and take him outside. lee has his hand on red's shoulder like a kindly uncle.}
<B>__{outside the station}
<A>__{bucky stands on the steps, taking fresh air. russ steps out.}
<C>__{russ millard}
<D>__{good report yesterday, bleichert.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{russ millard}
<D>__{what next?}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{you send me back to warrants?}
<C>__{russ millard}
<D>__{wrong again. but keep going.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{canvass around the biltmore. if red dropped her off there on the tenth maybe we can start reconstructing the last days before she got snatched.}
<C>__{russ millard}
<D>__{bright penny. you're doing well, bucky. run with the ball.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{all i know is you should keep an eye on loew and his boys. i didn't put it in my report, but betty sold it outright when she needed money bad enough, and loew's been trying to keep it kiboshed so it'll look better if he ever takes it to trial.}
<C>__{russ millard}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{you calling your boss an evidence suppressor?}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{and a grandstanding son of a bitch.}
<C>__{russ millard}
<D>__{you're a brighter penny than i thought.}
<P>__{(hands him a sheet of paper)}
<D>__{betty sightings. wilshire division. i need smart pennies to eliminate the phonies from the tip sheet.}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{what are you gonna do?}
<C>__{millard}
<D>__{keep an eye on the evidence suppressor son of a bitch and his minions to make sure they don't try to coerce a confession out of that innocent man in the holding tank.}
<A>__{he pats bucky on the shoulder and walks inside.}
