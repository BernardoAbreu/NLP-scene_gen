<L>__{interior burke's apartment early morning}
<A>__{as he hangs up. looks down and turns off his phone number pocket computer. music recalls prince's "there is lonely."}
<L>__{exterior tv studio late afternoon}
<A>__{music segues to recall "i will do anything," as he drives past the line waiting to see rainbow house. (note: from this point on, there will be an undercurrent of choreography to conclusion...)}
<L>__{interior make up room late afternoon}
<A>__{we see jeannie's face in the mirror, but it is seen through something resembling fleece, which we now recognize as the strands of jeannie's hair being combed out to the side by an expert hair dresser. jeannie is shifting nervously in the large room where each chair is filled with a child of a different age and color. in the b.g., we can hear the voice of the warm up man.}
<D>__{warm up man ...pilot for a new show called 'rainbow house'. just listen to our band and i will be back to tell you more and make you love me...}
<A>__{the audience laughs thinly. the band plays as someone closes the door to the make up room muffling the offstage sound... there is a good deal of tension in the brightly lit room. jeannie sits between a fourteen year old hispanic boy and a four year old asian girl. the room is abuzz... kids running lines and loudly talking... this builds to a musical life as in our first audition scene... there is a briefly sung phrase (jeannie not taking part).}
