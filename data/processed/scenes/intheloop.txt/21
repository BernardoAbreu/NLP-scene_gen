<L>__{interior foreign office lobby day}
<A>__{we're with karen clark's delegation who have just walked downstairs from the meeting room into a ground floor lobby area. karen is talking to liza, her right hand woman. toby, simon and judy are above them standing round a circular viewing area that looks down on the lobby. the uk and us delegations are aware of each other, throwing furtive glances each other's way.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{whichever committee they don't want me to be a member of, i want to be a member of that. it's a confused groucho marx.}
<C>__{liza}
<D>__{okay. right.}
<A>__{chad arrives. karen talks to someone else.}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{hey liza. your paper got a major citation. you must be psyched karen brought it up.}
<C>__{liza}
<D>__{she...that was her call. i didn't know it had been that widely read.}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{you could not write anything that clashes more violently with the current climate than you the one you wrote if you were trying, and it almost seems like you were trying.}
<C>__{liza}
<D>__{i wasn't trying, believe me.}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{you are like the woman from the omen, you've given birth to a demon and it's going to kill you.}
<C>__{liza}
<D>__{you probably identify with the kid from the omen right?}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{ooh.}
<C>__{liza}
<D>__{see, you're an only child, aren't you?}
<C>__{chad}
<D>__{you bring this up whenever you run out of arguments. i don't see how my parents' limited reproductive abilities reflects badly on me. i'm the sperm that made it.}
<A>__{liza walks off, over to karen.}
<C>__{chad }
