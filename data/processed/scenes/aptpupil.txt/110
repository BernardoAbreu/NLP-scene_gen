<L>__{interior hospital room morning}
<C>__{weiskopf }
<P>__{(in german)}
<D>__{wake up. wake up, old man.}
<A>__{dussander's eyes open. the first thing he sees are three men, all in suits, standing over him.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{are you speaking to me?}
<A>__{the voice comes from weiskopf, 40's. his suit is dark gray, well tailored, probably european. he speaks eloquently despite an accent that shows roots of europe and the middle east.}
<C>__{weiskopf}
<P>__{(back in english)}
<D>__{no one else is here.}
<A>__{dussander looks over at ben's former bed.}
<C>__{weiskopf }
<D>__{mr. krauss is recuperating elsewhere. are you awake now, dussander?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{yes, of course, but you seem to have me confused with someone else. my name is arthur denker. perhaps you want a different room }
<A>__{weiskopf sits on the edge of the bed. dussander notices the pin on his lapel. a small, silver star of david.}
<C>__{weiskopf}
<D>__{my name is weiskopf. you are kurt dussander.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{i know no one by that name. shall i ring for the nurse?}
<A>__{dussander reaches for the call button and stops in horror. he looks at his hands. his fingertips are smeared with black ink. he looks up at the men in disbelief.}
<C>__{weiskopf}
<D>__{the man in the next bed was benjamin krauss. he was imprisoned for ten months at patin. you were responsible for the death of his wife and two daughters. his identification of you was quite specific. i'm sure his reward from my government will help offset the burden of his broken leg.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{my name is arthur denker. i am an american }
<C>__{weiskopf}
<D>__{please don't bother. your papers will not stand up to serious examination and you know it.}
<A>__{the detective, getty, snaps a few pictures of dussander. the other man is fbi special agent dan richler.}
<C>__{richler}
<D>__{we have all we need here, isaac.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{who are you men? what are your names?}
<C>__{richler}
<D>__{my name is richler, fbi. this is detective getty from the orange county sheriff's department.}
<C>__{weiskopf}
<D>__{and i think you know who i work for. when you get your strength back, you will be moved. until then, this entire ward will be under surveillance. you can expect to be in tel aviv by the end of the summer.}
<A>__{the three men are out the door.}
