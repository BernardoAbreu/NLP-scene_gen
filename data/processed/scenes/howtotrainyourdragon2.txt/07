<L>__{exterior open sea midday}
<A>__{(scene 0700 eret's lesson) eret's ship carves a defiant path north, leaving the last glimpses of lapland in its wake. eret stands on the bowsprit, eyeing the waves intently, searching the surface. he turns toward the deck, where his crewmen man the gunwale cannons, sights trained to the sky.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{keep your eyes peeled, lads! with this wind, we'll reach drago by daybreak, so best we fill this ship up with dragons and quick! it's no time to be picky. not if we want to keep our }
<C>__{ug}
<D>__{uh... eret?}
<A>__{eret turns in the direction ug is pointing to see a pair of dragons flapping toward them.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{heads! off the port quarter!}
<A>__{the crewmen swing the net cannons toward the back lit, silhouetted dragons, drawing ever closer.}
<C>__{eret }
<D>__{net `em, lads! take `em down!}
<A>__{eret loads a cannon and takes aim. he spots hiccup and astrid riding the dragons. his eyes narrow, determined.}
<C>__{eret }
<D>__{you're not getting away this time.}
<A>__{nets fly through the air. hiccup and astrid outmaneuver them and dive toward the ship, landing on the deck with a clatter.}
<C>__{eret }
<D>__{and here i was worried we might turn up empty handed.}
<A>__{astrid brandishes her axe in invitation. hiccup indicates for her to lower it, then holds up his hands in surrender.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{nope. it's your lucky day. we give up.}
<A>__{eret's crew exchange confused stares. as does astrid.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{that's one night fury, one deadly nadder, and...}
<A>__{he dismounts toothless and tosses a net over astrid.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{... two of the finest dragon riders west of luk tuk. that oughtta make the boss happy, right?}
<A>__{astrid grumbles. he takes her axe, hands it to eret, and escorts astrid past the men to the open live well.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{excuse us.}
<A>__{he leads astrid down the ladder. she glares at him, plainly hating the plan.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<A>__{toothless tries to follow them, but hiccup holds him back.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{toothless, stay.}
<A>__{hiccup flips the latch, lowering the grate as eret watches, confounded.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{the dragons don't really care for cramped spaces, so they'll just hang out with you. they won't be any trouble.}
<A>__{eret's men nervously direct their swords and spears toward toothless. he snarls.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{unless you do that. wooden boat, big ocean. how's your swimming? no name not good.}
<A>__{a burst of flame erupts from the live well, causing the crewmen to jump back. hiccup thrusts his dragon blade through the grate.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{oops. almost forgot. can't have armed prisoners!}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{how is this a plan?}
<A>__{he retracts the blade and offers it up. a crewman cautiously takes it, looking it over. the pommel of the hilt is expelling green gas.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{just what every dragon trapper needs. one end coats the blade in monstrous nightmare saliva. the other sprays hideous zippleback gas. all it takes is a spark and...}
<A>__{a curious crewman clicks the lighter, igniting the gas. hiccup ducks as the sudden explosion sweeps over the deck.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{oh, yeah, there you go!}
<A>__{toothless paws at the embers.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{once they see you as one of their own, even the testiest dragons can be trained, right, bud?}
<A>__{toothless gurgles and falls over.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{give me that!}
<A>__{eret snatches the dragon blade and hurls it overboard. stormfly bolts after it...}
<C>__{eret }
<D>__{what game are you playing?}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{no game. we just want to meet drago.}
<A>__{and returns in a flash, dropping it at eret's feet like a fetching dog, tongue wagging. eret throws it again, frustrated. stormfly returns with it just as quickly.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{because i'm going to change his mind about dragons.}
<A>__{eret and his crew laugh. astrid pokes out of the well.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{he can be really persuasive.}
<A>__{hiccup pets toothless, thoughtfully.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{once you've earned his loyalty, there is nothing a dragon won't do for you.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{puh! you won't be changing any minds around here.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{i can change yours. right here. right now.}
<A>__{hiccup sets toothless' tail in the locked, splayed position. eret sneers, suspicious.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{may i?}
<A>__{suddenly, hiccup is snatched into the air! dragons blur past. i e. open sea ship sunset (scene 1000 botched rescue) the crewmen scramble to the net cannons as a flurry of wings streak past, gashing holes in the sails and slicing through rigging.}
<C>__{eret}
<D>__{dragon riders!}
<A>__{toothless shrieks and bounds up the mast, spotting hiccup in the talons of a monstrous nightmare. toothless relaxes, realizing that it's hookfang.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{put me down! snotlout! what are you doing?}
<A>__{snotlout looks back to see if ruffnut witnessed the save.}
<C>__{snotlout}
<D>__{see how well i protect and provide?}
<A>__{ruffnut grumbles at the incessant courting. a flying net whizzes past her head.}
<C>__{tuffnut}
<D>__{aggh! what is with all the nets?!}
<C>__{ruffnut}
<D>__{hey watch it! that was close...}
<A>__{ruffnut spots eret, firing nets from the deck of the ship.}
