<D>__{it does have perks.}
<A>__{irene pops the beaters out of the mixer, hands one to adam. they lick the potatoes off them.}

<D>__{tell me something. when you kiss those girls, you're not really kissing them, are you?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{it's a stage kiss. your lips touch, but there's no tongue.}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{there's no feeling. nobody gets jealous.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{it's acting. it's not real.}
<A>__{she takes his cleaned beater from him, dumps it in the sink. turning back, she kisses him. caught off guard, he backs into the refrigerator. it's a good three second lip lock. she backs off. there's an awkward beat.}

<D>__{see, now, that. there was a tongue there.}
<C>__{burke }
<D>__{honey, red or white?}
<A>__{now dressed, burke comes in with two bottles of wine. zack is behind him at a distance, still creeped out from the bedroom encounter. he and adam trade panicked stares.}
