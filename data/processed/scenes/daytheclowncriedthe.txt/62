<L>__{exterior barracks h med. shot keltner, franz, herman day}
<A>__{they sit in the shade beside their barracks. herman is using his empty bowl as a fan. keltner is just finishing his food. franz is examining his jacket, his empty bowl beside him on the ground.}
<C>__{franz }
<D>__{i mean it this time.}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{don't tell us. tell him.}
<A>__{franz holds up the tattered jacket to show that a button is missing.}
<C>__{franz}
<D>__{what am i supposed to do? use pins?}
<C>__{herman}
<D>__{who has a pin?}
<A>__{keltner chuckles.}
<C>__{franz}
<D>__{you can laugh. he isn't always after you for something.}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{no?}
<A>__{he fishes in a pocket and pulls out a large piece of chalk, holds it up.}
<C>__{franz}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{chalk.}
<C>__{franz}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{keltner }
<D>__{says he can mash it into a powder and put it on his face.}
<A>__{herman stops fanning along enough to ask...}
<C>__{herman}
<D>__{where'd you get it?}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{from a guard.}
<A>__{astonished, herman and franz look at him questioningly.}
<C>__{keltner}
<P>__{(lowers his voice)}
<D>__{a very bad nazi. still has a heart.}
<A>__{herman and franz smile. then franz holds up his tattered coat.}
<C>__{franz}
<D>__{i wish he'd have a heart and use someone else's coat. or better yet his own.}
<C>__{keltner}
<P>__{(looking o.s. and nodding)}
<D>__{ask him.}
<A>__{wider angle favoring helmut as he comes flapping up, still munching on the piece of bread given to him by the big prisoner. keltner holds out the chalk to him.}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{finally got it.}
<A>__{helmut takes it and examines it in a very professional manner. herman and franz exchange looks. keltner waits for helmut to speak.}
<C>__{keltner}
<P>__{(a little annoyed)}
<D>__{isn't that what you wanted?}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(holding up the chalk)}
<D>__{this will do more for the act than anything. wait'll you see!}
<C>__{keltner}
<P>__{(a sigh of relief)}
<D>__{for a moment there you had me worried.}
<C>__{franz}
<P>__{(indicating bread helmut's nibbling on)}
<D>__{i see you got smart.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{his conscience bothered him.}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{i thought he would kill you when he saw what you had done to his shoes.}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(sheepishly)}
<D>__{so did i.}
<A>__{the men laugh.}
<C>__{franz}
<D>__{i don't know what i'm laughing at... look at what he's doing to my coat.}
<P>__{(holds it up)}
<D>__{look at it! yesterday a button off.}
<A>__{and you've got it ripped here under the arm. besides all that falling down isn't doing it any good.}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(firmly)}
<D>__{i've got to have it. it is the only one i can get on and still is tight enough to look funny.}
<C>__{franz}
<D>__{at the rate you are tearing it up, it's going to look a lot funnier.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{shooting past helmut and group and in f.g. toward the main yard, where we see galt and uhlmann approaching. during the ensuing dialogue, galt spots helmut, nudges uhlmann and together they come toward him.}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{give in, franz. you know he's going to talk you out of it again.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{i will be careful. i swear. besides, i've got to have it. i explained before... a clown can't change his costume. it's his trademark.}
<C>__{franz}
<D>__{i know... i know... but...}
<A>__{galt and uhlmann join the group, looking to start trouble.}
<C>__{galt}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{why should he give it to a jew clown? right, kid?}
<C>__{franz}
<D>__{that's got nothing to do with it.}
<C>__{galt}
<D>__{what's the matter with you bastards anyway? all he ever did for us was cause trouble, but for them...}
<P>__{(nodding toward the other side)}
<D>__{... he can't do enough.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{i say he's one of them.}
<C>__{keltner}
<P>__{(coolly)}
<D>__{if he were, he'd be over there}
<A>__{through this helmut remains silent his eyes focused on the coat.}
<C>__{galt}
<D>__{that's where he belongs.}
<A>__{franz and keltner get to their feet. herman remains seated.}
<C>__{franz}
<D>__{what're you so hot about? it's no skin off your...}
<C>__{uhlmann}
<P>__{(cutting in)}
<D>__{we've got a good reason for not liking them.}
<C>__{galt}
<D>__{if it wasn't for them... we wouldn't be in here.}
<A>__{this surprises the men. herman gets to his feet.}
<C>__{herman}
<D>__{what'd you mean?}
<C>__{uhlmann}
<D>__{a bunch of them got picked up with papers we'd sold them. and what'd they do? turn us in, they did. the ungrateful...}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{so that was it! counterfeit papers. i can imagine the prices.}
<C>__{galt}
<D>__{supply and demand, reverend. supply and demand.}
<A>__{deliberately, franz hands his coat to helmut.}
<C>__{franz}
<D>__{take it, doork anytime you want it.}
<A>__{helmut accepts the coat... nodding his head in the gracious manner of a ruler accepting homage from a faithful subject. he turns smartly and slowly struts away with as much dignity as he can muster in his big shoes which flap with every step he takes. the others stand and stare at galt and uhlmann.}
<C>__{uhlmann}
<D>__{what's so terrible about what we did? lot of them got out of the country with our papers. they were damn good counterfeits.}
<A>__{keltner, without a word, turns and goes off after helmut.}
<C>__{galt}
<P>__{(calling to keltner, very proudly)}
<D>__{and what's more, we never charged for children. never.}
<A>__{med. shot helmut, keltner as keltner catches up with helmut. the camera moves back as they walk along the side of the barracks toward the door.}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{i've been meaning to ask you. heard anymore about the request for a review of your case?}
<A>__{helmut doesn't hear him as he's deep in his own thoughts.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{did you hear the laughs i got yesterday?}
<A>__{keltner nods.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{not just from the children... but the adults, too.}
<A>__{you know where a lot of clowns make a big mistake? they play just for the children. they forget... it's the parents, the adults that buy the tickets.}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{never thought of that.}
<A>__{helmut stops, faces keltner, a sly smile on his face.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{they said i couldn't come up with anything new.}
<A>__{keltner looks puzzled.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{at the circus. schmidt and the rest. wait'll they see my act now. it's funny. really funny.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{isn't it?}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{the children certainly enjoy it.}
<A>__{helmut begins to move along again with keltner following.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{what i needed was time. time to concentrate on new material. a man's got to have time alone.}
<C>__{keltner}
<P>__{(glancing around)}
<D>__{you call this being alone?}
<A>__{helmut takes a few more steps then stops short.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{do you think... maybe... they'd let me go to other camps and entertain?}
<A>__{keltner is about to say something... but shrugs his shoulders. he knows there's not much point in trying to make helmut look at things the way they really are. helmut starts to walk again.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{i'd have to get to the commandant. would need his permission.}
<A>__{they arrive at the steps to the barracks. helmut swings franz's coat over his shoulder as he starts up the steps.}
<C>__{helmut}
<D>__{if you have time later, i'd like you to see something i've been working on. i hunch down and do a tiny soldier parading. think they'll like it?}
<C>__{keltner}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{who? the adults?}
<C>__{helmut}
<P>__{(matter of fact)}
<D>__{the children, of course.}
<C>__{keltner}
<D>__{i thought the smart clown only played to the adults.}
<A>__{helmut, caught in a contradiction of his own "theory" of clowning, gives keltner an annoyed look, then goes into the barracks letting the door slam behind him. close shot keltner as he stands at the bottom of the steps he shakes his head and smiles as he marvels at the change taking place in the pompous helmut as the little gentle clown within him struggles to emerge.}
