<A>__{the customer exits, smiling and carrying his tapes what a great fucking deal he just got! a few seconds later, tony comes out and locks up the store front. he crosses the street towards }
<L>__{interior a falafel joint a few minutes after that}
<A>__{a huge falafel drips lettuce and tahini sauce from its end. we pull back on tony, who's just taken a bite out of the falafel. he sits at a table in the back with vincent and sam.}
<C>__{tony}
<P>__{(his mouth full)}
<D>__{what i've heard so far, it's all a lot of talk. i wasn't so sure what to make of it at first, cause, like i said, the irish and the russians are an unlikely mix.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{you said you might know where we can get a copy of this tape?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{all depends on whether you want the russian or the gaelic language version.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(instantly)}
<D>__{gaelic.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{you sure?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm sure.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(to tony)}
<D>__{can you get it?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{the russian would be easier.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{why's that?}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{cause the russian production company would be easier to find.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{it's the irish tape we want.}
<C>__{tony}
<P>__{(with a sigh)}
<D>__{gonna be tough.}
<A>__{tony scribbles something on a piece of paper.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{last i heard there was a film rep for the irish players staying at this address, name of seamus reilly.}
<C>__{sam}
<P>__{(repeating it, he knows this name)}
<D>__{seamus reilly.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(to sam)}
<D>__{you know him?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i know of him.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{seamus reilly, boy's a serious irish auteur a real firebrand. thinks his more moderate filmmaking brethren have turned to making movies for peace loving pussies, if you see what i'm saying.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i get the picture.}
<A>__{sam reaches for the piece of paper, but vincent puts his hand on top of it.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{tony and i have to talk some business, first.}
<C>__{tony}
<D>__{i gotta try and overcharge him, he has to moan about the price, we settle somewhere in the middle.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{it's a matter of respect.}
<P>__{(to sam)}
<D>__{why don't you wait outside, this won't take long.}
<A>__{sam smiles slightly and rises from the table, moving towards the exit. behind him in rapid fire french, tony and vincent are now discussing the price of the information. they are both loud and abusive, and obviously they're enjoying themselves immensely.}
