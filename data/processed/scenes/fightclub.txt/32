<A>__{everyone stands and mills about, pairing off.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{pick someone special to you tonight.}
<A>__{jack sees the ghastly spectre of chloe ambling towards him. he tries to smile. she smiles with a twisted, dying mouth.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{hello, mr. tayler.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{i never gave my real name at support groups.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{hi, chloe.}
<C>__{chloe}
<D>__{we've never actually talked.}
<A>__{chloe's eyes are eerily bright with desperation. jack, in a sincere attempt at levity, chokes out:}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you look good. you ... look ... like a pirate.}
<A>__{chloe laughs, a little too much. jack squeezes out a laugh. then he sees marla, off by herself. someone heads for her.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{excuse me, i have to...}
<A>__{jack gives a quick nod to chloe and darts towards marla. chloe watches him go. stay on jack and marla as jack clamps his arms around her. he whispers into her ear.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{we need to talk.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm on to you. you're a faker. you aren't dying.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{okay, in the sylvia plath philosophy way, we're all dying. but you're not dying the way chloe is dying.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{tell the other person how you feel.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you're a tourist. i saw you at melanoma, tuberculosis and testicular cancer.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{and i saw you practicing this...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{practicing what?}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{telling me off. is it going as well as you hoped... ?}
<P>__{(reads his nametag)}
<D>__{"... mr. taylor."}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i will expose you.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{go ahead. i will expose you.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{share yourself completely.}
<A>__{marla puts her head down on jack's shoulder as if she were crying. jack pulls her head back up. she deadpans at him.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{why are you doing this?}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{it's cheaper than a movie, and there's free coffee.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{these are my groups. i was here first. i've been coming for a year.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{a year? how'd you manage that?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{anyone who might've noticed either died or recovered and never came back.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{let yourself cry.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{why do you do it?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i... i don't know. i guess... when people think you're dying, they really listen, instead...}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{ instead of just waiting for their turn to speak.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{brief recognition between them, broken as the leader passes.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{quietly, now. share with each other.}
<A>__{jack waits till the leader's out of earshot.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(warning)}
<D>__{it becomes an addiction.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{jack sighs, then pulls back.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{look, i can't cry with a faker present.}
<C>__{marla}
<D>__{candy stripe a cancer ward. it's not my problem.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{please. can't we do something... ?}
<A>__{marla starts out of the room. jack follows her.}
<C>__{leader}
<D>__{now, the closing prayer.}
