<CHAR>__{DANIEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It has to work. You just bought it this afternoon.}
<ACTION>__{A beat.}
<CHAR>__{JULIEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Do they come with batteries?}
<CHAR>__{DANIEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You didn't buy batteries?}
<CHAR>__{JULIEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I thought they came with batteries.}
<CHAR>__{DANIEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I can't believe you didn't check.}
<CHAR>__{JULIEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I bought everything you put on the list. Gloves. Pen knives. Flashlight. Batteries were not on the list.}
<CHAR>__{DANIEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Why should I have to put it on the list? It's like saying to buy a car with tires.}
<LOC>__{EXT. HOUSE -- NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{A wealthy neighborhood of Paris off the Champs Elysees. Large homes line the secluded street. We see the silhouette of a man in a Peugeot. We MOVE IN closer to see RAYMOND GAYET, 30's, waits nervously.}
<LOC>__{INT. DARK ROOM -- NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Dark. DANIEL FORAY lights his Zippo lighter. He is late 30's, tall, handsome with eyes that seem to twinkle in the glow of the flame. Beside him is JULIEN LABESSE, 30's, hyper. Daniel places the LIGHTER on a small table and moves over to a PAINTING on the wall. Daniel stops at one, removes a pen knife and starts to cut the canvas from the frame. Daniel rolls up the canvas.}
<CHAR>__{DANIEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Let's go.}
<ACTION>__{Julien starts to pick up the ZIPPO.}
<CHAR>__{DANIEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Be careful it's...}
<ACTION>__{Too Late! Julien has already picked it up. It burns his hand ans he flicks it away. It flies through the air and lands in the corner of the room. The CURTAINS catch on fire.}
<CHAR>__{DANIEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{... hot!}
<ACTION>__{Julien panics! He grabs the canvas out of Daniel's hand and begins beating the flames with it. Daniel looks at him with disbelief. Julien flails his arms wildly as he beats back the flames. He turns to Daniel pleased that his efforts have extinguished the fire, but unaware that the canvas has now caught on fire. A beat. Julien sees the flames and puts them out. Daniel just stares at him. He opens the canvas. The painting is ruined.}
<LOC>__{EXT. STREET -- NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{A Mercedes parks in front of the Peugeot, boxing it in between it and a car behind it. The DRIVER gets out and walks away.}

<ACTION>__{Daniel and Julien move through the darkness.}
<CHAR>__{DANIEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Light your lighter. I can't see anything... and try not to burn down the house!}
<ACTION>__{Julien remove a lighter and presses it. The entire room fills with light. Julien stares at the flame amazed.}
<CHAR>__{OLD MAN'S VOICE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Don't move!}
<ACTION>__{They turn to see an old man standing at the top of the stairs in his bathrobe. He is frail, his face pasty white. He is holding a very long, double-barrel shotgun. Julien looks to Daniel with a 'what now' expression. The old man slowly moves down the stairs. He loses his balance and falls down the stairs, tumbling head over heals until he reaches the bottom. Daniel and Julien stare at the old man who is sprawled out on the floor, motionless.}
<CHAR>__{JULIEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Is he dead?}
<CHAR>__{DANIEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't know.     He looks dead.}
<CHAR>__{JULIEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{He looked dead before he fell.}
<ACTION>__{The old man groans, then opens his eyes.    He grabs his shotgun. Daniel and Julien run to the door.}
<LOC>__{EXT. HOUSE -- NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Daniel and Julien run towards the street.}
<CHAR>__{DANIEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Start the car! Start the car!}
<ACTION>__{Raymond starts the engine.   Daniel and Julien rush across the street and get in the back seat. Raymond tries to pull out but there are only a few inches between the Mercedes in front and the car behind. Like a pinball stuck between two bumpers the Peugeot jerks rapidly back and forth.}
<LOC>__{INT. PEUGEOT -- CONTINUOUS}
<ACTION>__{Daniel and Julien stare angrily ar Raymond.}
<CHAR>__{JULIEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You didn't think to move the car before we came out!}
<ACTION>__{Daniel looks out his window and sees... DANIEL'S POV -- the old man runs out of his house with his shotgun and heads towards the car. Raymond is desperately trying to get the car free. They all slide down as the old man fires. The windows on the left side of the car shatter.}
<CHAR>__{DANIEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Raymond, get us out of here!}
<ACTION>__{Raymond pops up and returns to getting the car out as the old man opens the breach of the shotgun to reload.. Raymond floors the Peugeot keeping his foot on the brake. The engine revs. He turns the wheel to the left and releases the brake. The Peugeot juts forward smashing into the rear of the Mercedes and pushing in out into the street. Before the old man can take aim the Peugeot is speeding down the street.}
<LOC>__{INT. PEUGEOT -- MOVING -- NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{Raymond bites his lip nervously as he drives.    Julien finds the whole thing amusing. Daniel leans forward.}

<DIAL_PAR>__{(controlled anger)}
<DIAL>__{Being able to get away!}
<CHAR>__{RAYMOND} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're always pointing out my negative qualities. My analyst says positive reinforcement is a much more productive way of relating with people.}
<CHAR>__{JULIEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Fine. Raymond, we'd like to commend you on how well you fucked up tonight.}
<LOC>__{EXT. STREET, PARIS -- DAY}
<ACTION>__{A narrow street. Daniel carries the cardboard tube as he walks with Julien and Raymond. They enter a WAREHOUSE.}
<LOC>__{INT. BASTALDI'S OFFICE -- DAY}
<ACTION>__{Two large desks are lined up face to face. One is empty. The other is occupied by LAURANT BASTALDI, 40's, all business. Off to the side is MARCEL BUROT, 40's. Daniel, Julien and Raymond enter. As they approach the desk Daniel glances at Marcel who is staring at him.}
<CHAR>__{MARCEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(amused)}
<DIAL>__{I heard you almost got your ass blown off last night. Some thief. A regular black panther.}
<ACTION>__{Marcel glances at Bastaldi to see if he appreciates his comments.}
<CHAR>__{RAYMOND} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{A Black Panther was a member of an African American militant group in the sixties, Marcel. I think you're referring to The Pink Panther.}
<CHAR>__{MARCEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Pink panther, black panther. Who gives a shit? And I don't remember asking you a God Damn thing, you little turd.}
<CHAR>__{RAYMOND} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{There's no reason to be abusive. You're projecting your anger on me as a defense mechanism.}
<CHAR>__{MARCEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What the hell is he talking about?}
<CHAR>__{RAYMOND} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm talking about human beings communicating openly and honestly.}
<CHAR>__{MARCEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{How about getting on your knees and communicating with my dick?}
<CHAR>__{BASTALDI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Shut up! Both of you!    You're giving me a fuckin' headache.}
<ACTION>__{A beat. Raymond and Marcel stare at one another.     We HEAR a muffled GROANING SOUND in the b.g.}
<CHAR>__{DANIEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Where's your brother?}
<CHAR>__{BASTALDI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Vincent's in the States on business.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(a beat; referring to the painting)}
<DIAL>__{That it?}
<ACTION>__{Daniel lays the cardboard tube containing the painting on the desk. Bastaldi removes the painting. To him it is not a work of art, just a commodity to be sold. He opens his desk drawer, removes several large stacks of money and hands them to Daniel.}
<CHAR>__{BASTALDI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Okay.   Now I've got something I want to --}
<ACTION>__{We HEAR the groaning sound again. Bastaldi looks irritated. He gets up and walks over to a closet. He opens to the doors to reveal a man in his underwear, his wrists tied behind his back, his mouth taped shut. A wire noose is around his neck forcing him to stand on his tip toes to avoid hanging himself.}
<CHAR>__{BASTALDI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Do you mind? I'm trying to do some business here.}
<ACTION>__{The man looks at Bastaldi through pleading eyes and mumbles something.}
<CHAR>__{BASTALDI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{One more sound out of you and I'm going to cut your fuckin' tongue out.}
<ACTION>__{Bastaldi closes the door.   Daniel looks at him inquisitively.}
<CHAR>__{BASTALDI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You take someone in. Give them a steady job and how do they repay you? By claiming to misplace a shipment of your merchandise.}
<CHAR>__{RAYMOND} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Maybe he did misplace it.}
<CHAR>__{BASTALDI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You misplace your car keys.   You misplace your cell phone.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(More)}
<CHAR>__{BASTALDI } <CHAR_PAR>__{(Cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{You do not misplace one hundred and forty seven wide-screen TV's!}
<CHAR>__{DANIEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Laurant, how long has he been in there?}
<ACTION>__{Bastaldi looks puzzled.}
<CHAR>__{BASTALDI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't know.     What day is today?}
<CHAR>__{JULIEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thursday.}
<CHAR>__{BASTALDI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Is it Thursday already?    This week has just shot by.}
<ACTION>__{Bastaldi thinks about something for a moment, then...}
<CHAR>__{BASTALDI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You and your crew speak English, don't you?}
<ACTION>__{Daniel is still staring at the closet.}
<CHAR>__{BASTALDI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hey Daniel! Hello?}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(snaps his fingers)}
<DIAL>__{Do you guys speak English?}
<CHAR>__{DANIEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Uh, yeah.}
<CHAR>__{BASTALDI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Good.   I have a job for you in America.}
<ACTION>__{Bastaldi tosses a photo of a middle-aged American couple.   He points to a diamond necklace around the woman's neck.}

<DIAL>__{The Taylors from Chicago. Very rich. An acquaintance of mine recently quit working for Mrs. Taylor as an assistant. She tells me they keep all their jewelry in a safe in their bedroom.}
<CHAR>__{JULIEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It seems like a long way to go for a necklace.}
<CHAR>__{DANIEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Besides, we don't know the city and--}
<CHAR>__{MARCEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(overlapping)}
<DIAL>__{Mr. Bastaldi isn't asking you if you want to go.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(More)}
<CHAR>__{MARCEL } <CHAR_PAR>__{(Cont'd)}
<DIAL>__{He's telling you you're going! And if he's telling you you're going to be going then you are going to go!}
<CHAR>__{BASTALDI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thank you Marcel, for that... extremely redundant explanation.}
<CHAR>__{DANIEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{C'mon, Laurant, America?}
<CHAR>__{BASTALDI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{The job is worth about two million euros. Pull this off and you and your crew could make some real money, Daniel. You leave tomorrow.}
<ACTION>__{They know they don't have a choice.}
<CHAR>__{JULIEN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We're going to need to find someone who knows the city.}
<CHAR>__{MARCEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I know someone.}
<LOC>__{EXT. NOTRE DAME -- DAY}
<ACTION>__{The plaza is filled with tourists. Moving through the crowd is SAMI ZERHOUNI, Algerian, late 20's, a small time street hustler, dressed in jeans and a "I Love Paris" tee-shirt. He passes a MAN who is about to take a picture and lifts his wallet. Sami moves on. He sees two overweight women standing at a vendor's cart, holding a large wad of MONEY. The woman puts the cash back in her purse, but does not zip it up. Sami moves in behind her and slips his hand into the purse. She zips the bag closed. Sami's face fills with pain as the zipper catches the hair of his arm. The women walk towards the cathedral. Sami has no choice but follow after them. He tries to match their pace so he doesn't alert them of his presence. The woman looks back and sees Sami's hand. She pulls her bag away, ripping a section of hair off his arm, then swings the bag, putting all of her weight behind it. It hits Sami squarely in the face. He lands on his back with a thud. WALLETS and BILLFOLDS fly out from every one of his pockets. He staggers to his feet and starts to pick up the wallets when he sees... HIS POV -- ACROSS THE PLAZA:    of two police officers moving towards him . He knows he has no more time.    He takes off running, disappearing into the crowd.}
<LOC>__{INT. CAFE -- LATIN QUARTER -- DAY}
<ACTION>__{Sami is at the bar. He sees Marcel enter and runs towards the back. Standing in his way is one of Marcel's MEN. Sami turns around as Marcel approaches and forces a smile. NOTE:   All dialogue is now in English unless otherwise noted.}

<DIAL>__{Going somewhere?}
<CHAR>__{SAMI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh, Marcel! I thought you were somebody else. If I knew it was you I would have never run.}
<ACTION>__{A long, awkward beat as Marcel just glares at him.}
<CHAR>__{SAMI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You're probably here for the money I owe you.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(off Marcel's nod)}

<CHAR>__{SAMI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You know this is how rumors get started.}
<ACTION>__{Marcel punches Sami in the stomach. He drops to his knees. A beat. The door to the bathroom opens and the LARGE MAN peers inside. He stares awkwardly at what he perceives as the beginning of a sexual act.}

<DIAL>__{Told you.}
<ACTION>__{Marcel slams the door then grabs Sami by the ear and yanks him to his feet.}

<CHAR>__{MARCEL} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Normally I'd be breaking your fingers right now, but I'm going to give you a chance to make enough to pay me back and have some extra for yourself. We have a group going to Chicago to do a job. You're going with them.}

<DIAL>__{What is it you do, Sami?}
<CHAR>__{SAMI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You know, a little of this, a little of that. I've boosted cars, stole radios, run a few scams. Right now I'm into pick-pocketing.}

<DIAL>__{I see.   A master criminal.}
<CHAR>__{SAMI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<ACTION>__{The door opens. ZERO enters. No one knows his last name. He is}
<LOC>__{40's, blonde hair, leather jacket, black pants. Looks more like a}

<DIAL>__{Hi. I'm one and this is two, three, four and five.}
<ACTION>__{Sami laughs at his little joke. The others cringe. One look in Zero's eyes tells Sami what everyone else already knows: This is not someone to fuck with. Julien puts his arm around Sami and leads him away from the others.}

<DIAL>__{Let me give you some advice. You don't want to piss him off because he'll kill you for the fun of it. What you want to do is keep your mouth shut and do what we tell you.}

<DIAL>__{What?}
<CHAR>__{BASTALDI} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{This is a considerable move up for you, Daniel. The temptation of having so much money might be too much for you.}

Zero turns on the radio and clicks through a few stations until he comes to RENAUD singing "Des que le vent souffera." He leans back in his seat, bobbing his head to the music. Marcel doesn't like it. He changes the station. We hear JOHNNY HALLYDAY singing, "Que je taime."}

<DIAL>__{That's better.}
<ACTION>__{Zero doesn't like it. He pushes the button returning to the Renaud song and stares at Marcel. Marcel, not to be outdone returns the Hallyday song. Like two children they click the buttons of the radio, switching back and forth between Renaud and Hallyday. Bastaldi has had enough.}
