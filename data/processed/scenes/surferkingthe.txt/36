<A>__{robbie and alex hook up and grab their time cards. there is a banner hanging that says, "employee luau tonight", and skeeter and snitch have taken a 5 gallon bucket and are using it as a stepladder to attach something. skeeter is on the bucket with a stapler in his hand. snitch hands up the hand lettered magic marker addition, which skeeter staples on to the bottom of the banner while snitch keeps a lookout. the addition says, "come get lei'd". they scamper off, laughing.}
