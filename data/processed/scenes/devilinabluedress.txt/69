<A>__{easy slams to the floor but manages to roll out of the way of a lethal crack! of the board onto the floor. he grabs a lamp and hurls it at the oncoming figure who catches it on the arm and keeps on coming, snapping a blade from his fist which leaps out like a chrome colored flame. easy scrambles back, his head butting up against the couch, his forehead streaming blood, his eyes wide with the sight of sure death advancing.}
<C>__{easy}

<D>__{easy, you in there?}
<A>__{frank's head whips toward the door and easy knocks the knife away and comes up tussling. frank scrambles to get away and easy tackles him, straining to keep frank from reaching the knife. the front door springs open and spats on patent leather shoes clump in, the last one stomping down on frank's outstretched fingers. frank screams and cradles his hand in agony. easy scrambles up to his knees and gawks up at mouse, dressed in a plaid zoot suit with broadway suspenders down the front of his shirt, a long barreled .41 caliber pistol held loosely in his hand.}

<C>__{easy}
<D>__{let him be!}
<A>__{the two friends struggle, and frank rears up and plows into easy, sending him sprawling to the floor on top of mouse. then frank, covered in blood, hurls himself across the room, out the door. mouse gets to his feet and runs to the door aiming the pistol, but it's too late. easy stands up and mouse points the gun at him.}
<C>__{mouse}
<D>__{damn you, easy. don't you never grab me when i got a gun in my hand!}

<C>__{mouse}
<D>__{look at the blood you done got on my coat. why you wanna go and do that?}
<A>__{he looks out the door and grabs a small suitcase. then spots the bathroom and moves to it, taking off his jacket and hanging the pistol in his belt. easy holds his fingers to the bump on his forehead and catches his breath as mouse runs water in the bathtub.}

<D>__{now we got to find that girl so we can get that money.}
<C>__{easy}
<D>__{no, we don't, mouse. i don't need your kinda help or i would've called you.}
