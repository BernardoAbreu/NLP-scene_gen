<P>__{(with insight)}
<D>__{answers to what, spock? our dilemma or your personal one?}
<A>__{spock does not immediately reply, peers at kirk through the faceplate a long beat, then abruptly looks away, points off into the distance: another angle including inner wall (o) we can see what appear to be sparkling globules of light darting toward the inner wall in the distance, then disappearing there. (we'll see other swarms occasionally too, coming from different directions they will later be identified as "sensor swarms" on closer examination.)}

<D>__{captain, i believe there we will find an indication of whoever or whatever is aboard this vessel...}
<A>__{kirk weighs alternatives, then pushes his thruster controls and begins moving in the direction spock indicated. their thruster jets flash, propel them toward the point on the inner wall.}
