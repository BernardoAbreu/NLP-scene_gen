<L>__{interior dave's basement day}
<A>__{jim is riveted by dave's story; he is both horrified and titillated}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{you did it at your house? your own house?}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{look, jim... okay. i know it all seems crazy, and maybe it did start out, you know, for the... for the sex and the danger. but now it's different. jim, what i'm trying to tell you is that tracy and i are totally, totally in love.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{in love?}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{yeah, it's serious. i mean she inspires me in ways sherry never has. she even wants to read my novel.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{but you haven't written your novel.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{that's the whole pointerior it's all in my head; it's right here. i just got to get it out there. tracy wants me to write it so she can read it. it's beautiful.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{dave, i'm just saying this as your friend. what you're doing is really, really wrong, and you've got to stop.}
<A>__{dave draws a heavy sigh and buries his head in his hands perhaps jim has reached him. perhaps not.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{you're not just jealous, are you? i mean, we both used to talk about her}
<C>__{jim}
<P>__{(exploding)}
<D>__{that was just talk! fantasy talk! what are you, nuts? we talk about girls all the time, but it doesn't mean anything. i would never. . . i mean, i take very seriously our strict moral code. the line you've crossed is... it's illegal and it's immoral.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{i don't need a lecture on ethics, jim, okay? i know what }
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{i'm not talking about ethics. i'm talking about morals.}
<B>__{click. squeak. step step step.}
<C>__{sherry }
<D>__{peek a boo!}
<A>__{sherry comes down the basement stairs with darryl in her arms.}
<C>__{dave}
<P>__{(to jim, whispering)}
<D>__{look, i appreciate your concern. i really do. but like i said, i got it under control.}
<A>__{as sherry approaches them, dave rises to take darryl, the perfect father: hug, tickle, kiss.}
<C>__{jim }
<D>__{i guess i don't have to tell you how all this turned out.}
