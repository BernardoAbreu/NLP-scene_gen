Gordy can't use his other hand to get it. He needs the hand to hold onto the car. The grenade begins to slip. He's going to lose it. And just as it falls... Gordy does the only thing left. He slips a finger through the loops of the grenade pin. Just barely snags the grenade before it drops to the road. And then... Carefully, slowly -- praying that each bump doesn't jar the grenade off the pin -- with his other arm shaking and screaming in pain as he maintains a grip on the transfer case -- Gordy eases the grenade back onto his stomach, where he gets a better grip. Jams the grenade back. Then grabs onto the undercarriage once more, in time to relieve the muscle-tearing strain on his arm. ABOVE GORDY'S WORLD the Suburban passes the "Cine."

Keep stretching until they're barely holding the spoon... but they're holding it. Gordy quickly, carefully wires the grenade to the propane tank.
