<A>__{the music continues. inman emerges with his bag, lemats at the ready. the women are all keening over the corpse, as it a saint had passed away. dogs, women all howling. a chicken bobs in, investigates the glob of blood on junior's skull. inman walks away, doesn't look at the women, who don't look at him.}

<A>__{the music continues. ruby wakes up. looks out of the window. ada, also woken, comes into ruby's room. stobrod is outside with pangle, violin and banjo. ruby opens the window, scowling. stobrod beams, stops playing, holds up the food, points at pangle in his new coat. pangle waves.}
