<A>__{sethe, sitting in bed with her new dress and her wounds dressed waits for her children. baby suggs opens the door and the boys are ushered in. sethe welcomes them to her arms...they run to her, jumping on the bed. the startle causes some pain but sethe doesn't care. the little girl (beloved) is crawling and ushered toward her mama.}

<D>__{already crawling ain't that somethin? ..come on, baby girl..right this way..mama's waiting..}
<A>__{sethe picks her up and the tears flow. she can't stop kissing them their necks, their heads, their hands...the boys inspect her strange looking feet and ask;}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{pappie come?}

<A>__{baby suggs seems doubtful but appreciates the lie for the children.}
<C>__{baby suggs}
<D>__{all right boys mama's home now, you be seeing her all the time..go downstairs and get your supper...go on...}
<A>__{sethe hugs and kisses them as if for the last time as if she still doesn't believe she can just get out of bed, walk downstairs and be with them. the boys leave as sethe cradles the little girl. sethe anxiously undoes her dress and carefully guides her breast to the little girl. she winces with pain and smiles she got her milk to her baby girl. baby suggs gathers the rags sethe wore when she first arrived.}

<P>__{(skeptical)}
<D>__{well put these on maybe they'll light his way.}
<A>__{as sethe takes the earrings, the little baby girl reaches for them. through her eyes, we see them sparkle and shine like diamonds. baby suggs hands gently massage sethe's neck as she says;}
<C>__{baby suggs}
<D>__{whatever happens now...god lead you home. so now lay'em down sethe...sword and shield..don't study war no more. lay all that mess down. sword and shield...}
<A>__{sethe surrenders herself to baby suggs firm, safe hands letting go of the "diamonds", one of which lands in the hands of the little girl...who plays with them in fascination...}
