The CAMERA PANS around the table revealing the happy family and guests. Among them are KLUTE and CABLE. Camera stops at Mrs. Grunemann who sits at the foot of the table opposite her husband. She smiles across at him with pleasure. We cut to Tom Grunemann smiling back at her. We cut back to a closeup of Mrs. Grunemann  looking back at her husband with love. We cut back to Tom Grunemann's chair - only now it is empty. The joyous sounds disappear on this cut. It appears that Tom Grunemann has disappeared before our eyes. One moment he is there, and the next moment he is gone. The camera pans back down the table, only now it is empty except for Grunemann's children and Mrs. Grunemann. She is now dressed in something dark. She and the three children sit eating another meal in emptiness. She has changed from a joyous woman to a woman bereaved.}

<ACTION>__{KLUTE is packing to leave. We follow him about as he carries clothing from closet and bureau, folds it into his suitcase on the table. We hear the familiar FOOTSTEPS on the stairs. Bree's KNOCK. He lets her in, keeps on about his business. His expression is sober; hers is quite tentative.}
<CHAR>__{BREE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Hi.}
<ACTION>__{He doesn't at least expel her. She ventures in, sits on the table, swings her heels, watches him pack. His arm impairs him. At length --}

<DIAL>__{I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.}

<DIAL>__{Oh.}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(pause; then sharply --)}
<DIAL>__{Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.}

<DIAL>__{Mm.}

<DIAL>__{You're going back?}

<DIAL>__{Mm.}

<CHAR>__{KLUTE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Wait.}
<ACTION>__{She returns and sits on the table again, waits. But Klute doesn't seem about to say anything more -- goes on packing.}
<CHAR>__{BREE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well suppose I hadn't come downstairs. Would you just have folded up and sneaked away?}
<CHAR>__{KLUTE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(slowly)}
<DIAL>__{No. I was going to come up. I wanted to ask you to marry me.}

<DIAL>__{You could at least look at me!}

<DIAL>__{About what?}
<CHAR>__{BREE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Look at me. I'm pretty and sort of clever and very well intentioned, and dear God I'd tear your heart out!}
<CHAR>__{KLUTE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't think so.}
<ACTION>__{He resumes packing, continues through the following.}
<CHAR>__{BREE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{What?}
<CHAR>__{KLUTE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Doesn't scare me. I think we could handle it.}
<ACTION>__{Thereafter he guards his silence, staunchly goes on packing, as she comes at the thing from various sharp angles.}

<CHAR>__{BREE } <CHAR_PAR>__{(CONT'D)}
<DIAL>__{Look, why should it be yes or no? Can't we keep it going and see? I mean we can keep in touch and visit each other and see. People do that, that's realistic.}

<DIAL>__{Ok.}
<CHAR>__{BREE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(bitterly)}
<DIAL>__{You don't believe that either, do you? Why can't you see my side?}
<CHAR>__{KLUTE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Can you use these?}
<ACTION>__{He sets the fan beside her, hands her the LOUDLY TICKING clock. She holds it in her lap, numbly. He's packed -- closes various drawers, leaving in good order -- snaps the suitcase shut, lifts it stiffly down from the table. She remains sitting.}
<CHAR>__{BREE} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Can I carry something for you, to the car?}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(he shakes his head)}
<DIAL>__{Will you kiss me?}

<DIAL>__{No. I'm sore.}

<ACTION>__{He turns around and stops. He walks slowly back to her. CLOSER: BREE, KLUTE He arrives in proximity to her. Then the following events in more or less the following order: He looks at her inquiringly. She responds by sitting down, plunk, on the grubby front step of the Brownstone. Having stood for some time -- during which she has offered only twitching motions of her hands -- he sets down the suitcase. Having set down the suitcase, but derived no answer, he reaches out one arm, and leans against the building front. She nearly arrives at the level of statement. Fretfully, indecisively --}

<DIAL>__{Oh heck --}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(pause)}
<DIAL>__{Oh heck --}
<ACTION>__{Then, as a man not to be dallied with, he picks up the suitcase again. She looks at him strickenly, but it doesn't precipitate her into speech. He puts it down again. And then -- then, after all, goddamit, he reaches out, grabs her wrist, and simply hauls her along, suitcase in one hand, Bree in the other. As she yanks, shouts, struggles --}
