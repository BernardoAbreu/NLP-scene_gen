<L>__{interior mumford's office day extreme close up of ernest delbanco. we can't tell where he}
<A>__{is at first. as he speaks, we pull back to reveal him lying on mumford's couch a patient.}
<C>__{delbanco}
<D>__{...and when you said at lunch about everybody having "a secret life", something just snapped inside me. i knew i could no longer continue my relationship with dr. sheeler. it was tearing me up inside. and i know phyllis wasn't getting what she needed from it. what had started as a genuine respect, i think, for each other's professional abilities, and became, over time, a personal attraction had somehow... migrated into a rather torrid sexual relationship...}
<A>__{across the room, mumford sits, chin in hand, displaying no reaction.}
<C>__{delbanco}
<D>__{...i won't go into that today. though, if we should continue these sessions, as i certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that i would like to look at. god knows, i've listened to enough people giving me the juicy }
<P>__{(catches himself)}
<D>__{...at any rate, i just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. i just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{how do you mean?}
<A>__{this next is painful for delbanco.}
<C>__{delbanco}
<D>__{well... you see, when i broke it off with phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain how to put it doubts she's been harboring...}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{what kind of doubts?}
<C>__{delbanco}
<D>__{about you... your background and your qualifications. i'm afraid phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury with me, and actually took the whole issue to the state board.}
<A>__{mumford digests this.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{delbanco}
<D>__{and please, for whatever small way i may have encouraged this, accept my apologies.}
<P>__{(brightens)}
<D>__{there is good news, though.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{delbanco}
<D>__{phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. which leaves you the only psychologist in town.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{dr. sheeler is leaving mumford? i'm sorry to hear that.}
<C>__{delbanco}
<D>__{as you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... unlike, i must say, those of my wife.}
<A>__{mumford's head snaps up. he had no idea delbanco was married.}
