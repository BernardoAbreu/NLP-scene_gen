<A>__{cole runs across his room. he heads right for the homemade tent seated in the corner with the "do not touch" sign on it. he scurries in. his legs disappear as the bedsheets flap closed behind him. the crazed woman stands at the end of the hall. doesn't come any closer.}

<A>__{cole is curled up in the tent. he lays still for a moment reaching over and flicking on a flashlight. the red interior of the tent gets lip up. it's a striking sight. the bedsheet walls of the tent are lined with religious pictures taped to the walls. tiny statues of saints surround the interior perimeter. we see the statue cole stole from the church is in here... this tent is a sanctuary made by an eight year old to hide in.}
