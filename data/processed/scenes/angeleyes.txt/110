<L>__{exterior upscale residential street day}
<A>__{we see sharon walking quickly from her police car to the front of mrs. chu's home. robby waits in the unit.}
<L>__{exterior chu home day}
<A>__{sharon walks under that covered portico to the front door, but before she rings the bell, a voice startles her a bit.}
<C>__{elanora }
<D>__{pogo?}
<A>__{mrs. chu emerges from the shadows of the portico, rolling her wheelchair toward sharon. she has a smile for her but with some reserve.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i'm sharon pogue. i know all about the...}
<C>__{elanora}
<D>__{elanora.}
<A>__{sharon nods, very held back. she gestures toward the wheelchair self consciously.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i'm sorry for... what happened. i know about the accident.}
<C>__{elanora}
<P>__{(hopeful)}
<D>__{he told you?!}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{no. i found out, and... i remembered. i was there.}
<C>__{elanora}
<D>__{oh. yes.}
<A>__{sharon stares a moment, begins with some of her tough cover in place, over her emotions.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i guess he comes here a lot to talk to you.}
<C>__{elanora}
<D>__{he shops for me. twice a week.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{oh. and when he comes here he never mentions the past, never talks about the accident?}
<C>__{elanora}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{and you... let him do that? all this time? why?}
<C>__{elanora}
<D>__{it's what he needs.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{walking all over the city like...}
<C>__{elanora}
<D>__{like an angel. yes. sweet man.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{but... you let him get so lost.}
<A>__{elanora is a bit defensive now.}
<C>__{elanora}
<D>__{i let him find his own way through it. why did you come here, sharon?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{because... i want to know how to help him.}
<C>__{elanora}
<D>__{you are helping him.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i don't think so.}
<C>__{elanora}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{he... he was paying me back, i guess, for the accident, for helping him. that's why he felt... so close to me. but...}
<C>__{elanora}
<D>__{is that what you think?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{but now he probably hates me. i...}
<C>__{elanora}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i took him to the cemetery, and...}
<C>__{elanora}
<D>__{the cemetery!}
<A>__{elanora's look darkens and she begins to shake her head in worry.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i thought it might help him... come back, you know? but he wouldn't even go in. he screamed at me.}
<C>__{elanora}
<P>__{(upset)}
<D>__{what made you take him there?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{for the truth...}
<C>__{elanora}
<D>__{he knows the truth.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{but he won't even say it, or...}
<C>__{elanora}
<D>__{that's his way. that's his way through all this. he made a wall around that whole day, that night other things, too. he keeps them behind the wall his little boy, my daughter. he can't help it. the cemetery?! do you know how hard it is for me to go to the cemetery? can you imagine?}
<A>__{sharon is shaken by this, realizing, crumbling a bit as mrs. chu goes on.}
<C>__{elanora}
<D>__{that's where it stares you in the face the loss. and it's too much sometimes.}
<A>__{elanora takes a breath, acknowledging how upset she is.}
<C>__{elanora}
<D>__{see? i'm still finding my way through it. and catch it almost kills him to think about it or say it or drive a car or see the place where it happened or... go by the cemetery.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i was trying to help him... come back to some kind of life. i...}
<C>__{elanora}
<D>__{but he was coming back. do you realize how much he changed in the past weeks? his apartment, his life, his music is coming back. he fell in love! he even got a job, sharon for you. for the two of you. isn't that coming back? why do you have to rush? everybody has to rush these days.}
<A>__{sharon, battered by the truth of this, is totally exposed now, realizing, admitting.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{i was scared. i push so hard... when i'm scared.}
<C>__{elanora}
<D>__{scared of what?}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{losing him. so i did. i lost him. he won't talk to me. i... i didn't know what i was doing.}
<A>__{elanora sighs, looking at her, and her anger drains away, studying sharon's misery.}
<C>__{elanora}
<D>__{you were finding your way. what else can we do? you think i'm always sure what to say to him, what not to say? i do what i think is right and hope he sees the love in it.}
<A>__{she shakes her head at sharon's tears, her warmth showing now, liking this girl.}
<C>__{elanora}
<D>__{look at you so worried now, so miserable. that's the love in it.}
<C>__{sharon}
<D>__{did i... make it worse for him?}
<C>__{elanora}
<D>__{i don't know. i really don't. but i think he'll see the love in what you did.}
<A>__{sharon stares, without much hope. she puts out her hand to touch elanora's, to say goodbye. elanora takes her hand and holds on a moment, staring into the girl, with strength. sharon nods and walks off, dark and sad. elanora watches her go.}
