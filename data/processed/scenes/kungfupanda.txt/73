<L>__{interior scroll room moments later}
<A>__{close up of the dragon scroll. po stares at shifu then looks up at the scroll. then back at shifu }
<C>__{po}
<D>__{you really believe i'm ready?}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{you are, po.}
<A>__{they look at each other. this is a big moment. oogway's staff hangs in a rack surrounded by candles. as po and the five stand by, shifu carries the staff over to the reflecting pool. shifu bows his head, then, eyes still closed, he raises the staff up above his head. po and the others watch, expectantly. the peach blossom petals rise in a flickering, spinning cloud up from the pool. the gentle tornado rises up around the ceiling carving that holds the dragon scroll. the petals loosen the scroll from the dragon's mouth and it falls. at the last second, shifu reaches out with the staff to catch the scroll on the end of it. he turns to po, holding it out.}
<C>__{shifu }
<D>__{behold. the dragon scroll... it is yours.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{wait, what happens when i read it?}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{no one knows, but legend says you will be able to hear a butterfly's wing beat.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{whoa! really? that's cool.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{yes. and see light in the deepest cave. you will feel the universe in motion around you.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{wow! can i punch through walls? can i do a quadruple back flip? will i have invisibility }
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{focus. focus.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{huh? oh, yeah... yeah.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{read it, po, and fulfill your destiny. read it and become... the dragon warrior!}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{whooaa!!!}
<A>__{po takes a deep breath. then he grasps the tube and tries to pull the top off it. it doesn't budge. he strains at it.}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{it's impossible to open.}
<A>__{he strains again. he tries to bite it off...}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{come on baby. come on now...}
<A>__{shifu sighs and holds out his hand. po passes him the tube. shifu pops the end off effortlessly and passes it back to po.}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{thank you. i probably loosened it up for you though... okay, here goes.}
<A>__{he glances at the five. they look on in awe. monkey gives him the `thumbs up.' po starts to unroll the scroll, the golden light bathing his face. across the scroll we see shifu, excited that he is witness to history... on po's face as he finishes opening the scroll. then }
<C>__{po }
<D>__{aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!}
<A>__{shifu looks concerned. the five look concerned. po looks utterly terrified.}
<C>__{po }
<D>__{it's blank!}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{here! look!}
<A>__{po tries to show shifu the scroll. shifu covers his eyes and turns his head away.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{no! i am forbidden to look upon }
<A>__{but he can't help himself. he takes a peek. then he grabs if off po. he turns it around, then upside down. he closes it and opens it again, astonished.}
<C>__{shifu }
<D>__{blank? i don't...i don't understand.}
<A>__{shifu turns away, contemplative. what can this mean?}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{okay. so like, oogway was just a crazy old turtle after all?}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{no. oogway was wiser than us all.}
<A>__{po sits heavily on the floor, dejected.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{oh, come on! face it. he picked me by accident. of course i'm not the dragon warrior. who am i kidding?}
<A>__{the five don't argue.}
<C>__{tigress}
<D>__{but who will stop tai lung?}
<C>__{crane}
<D>__{he'll destroy everything...and everyone.}
<A>__{shifu puts the scroll back in its container and seals it. he looks oddly calm as he turns around.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{no, evacuate the valley. you must protect the villagers from tai lung's rage.}
<C>__{tigress}
<D>__{what about you master?}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{i will fight him.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{i can hold him off long enough for everyone to escape.}
<C>__{po}
<D>__{but shifu, he'll kill you.}
<C>__{shifu}
<D>__{then i will finally have paid for my mistake.}
<A>__{the five and po look devastated.}
<C>__{shifu }
<D>__{listen to me, all of you. it is time for you to continue your journey without me. i am very proud to have been your master.}
<A>__{shifu salutes them and turns away. po is heartbroken. crane steps forward and kindly puts a wing around po, pulling away. po resists for a moment, then lets the five lead him off.}
