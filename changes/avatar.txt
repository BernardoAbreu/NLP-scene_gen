The technicians dive for cover in a blizzard of glass and shredded debris. The slash-cutter head pulls back, and AVATARS SCRAMBLE through the gaping hole into the Ops Center -- The TROOPERS look up to see blue giants aiming weapons down at them. The battle is over in seconds. The avatars are holding the Ops Center. Selfridge lies there gasping, in his emergency mask. In shock. How could this be happening?}

<ACTION>__{THE DRAGON lies half submerged. Out of the water FG, a shape rises -- a AMPSUIT. Inside -- MILES QUARITCH, his face bloody, his eyes burning. He slogs out of the water, covered with mud, then strides into the forest. QUARITCH'S AMPSUIT THUDS relentlessly through the jungle. He sees something through the foliage ahead -- the SHACK. INSIDE THE SHACK Jake is oblivious under the link. Through a window we see Quaritch's AMPSUIT step into the clearing. QUARITCH levels his GAU-90 at the shack. His finger goes to the firing button-- WHAM!! A six-legged BLACK DEMON tackles him. Quaritch pivots as he falls, FIRING the cannon. It misses Neytiri by inches. He grapples with the THANATOR as its razor claws SCREECH over his metal armor. THE TITANS twist and struggle. QUARITCH UNLEASHES a long burst from the cannon. Rounds tear into the creature, which SHRIEKS but -- NEYTIRI wills it to SMASH the cannon hard against a rock, tearing it loose from the `suit's hand but -- Quaritch SLAMS the thanator back against a tree-trunk, almost crushing Neytiri. CLOSE ON one hydraulic hand, as it draws the `suit's KNIFE and -- QUARITCH TWISTS violently, ramming the knife up under the thanator's chest armor. The creature ROARS and Quaritch flips on top of it, stabbing. QUARITCH STABS DOWN AGAIN. The thanator slumps, pinning Neytiri's legs under its great bulk. She is trapped. Quaritch looks down at Neytiri. She glares back at him, panting, scared but defiant.}

Jake ducks, coming up to meet the next slash and -- SMASHES the knife hand with the cannon once -- twice -- again -- in a furious attack -- knocking the knife flying. QUARITCH catches him with the other arm, hurling him away. Jake rolls just before -- THUDDD! -- the massive foot stomps down where he just was. He scrambles up as Quaritch CHARGES and -- JAKE DUCKS another round-house, LEAPING forward to smash the canopy again -- then again -- until it is WHITE with cracks. Quaritch manages to GRAB the cannon barrel but -- INSIDE THE COCKPIT, he sees nothing but the sun on the shattered glass. HE HURLS the cannon blindly, but Jake ducks. The massive cylinder cartwheels toward the shack and -- FROM INSIDE we see it CRASH against pressure window, crazing it but not penetrating. Jake's link sits just inside. INSIDE THE COCKPIT, Quaritch yanks a yellow handle and -- P-FOOM! -- the canopy BLOWS OFF, flying through the air. Quaritch can see again. He dons his breathing mask. Bends to pick up his KNIFE. NEARBY NEYTIRI struggles furiously, trying to get her legs free from underneath three tons of thanator. QUARITCH, panting, glowers at Jake.}

THE AMPSUIT charges, the knife flashing down and -- JAKE just manages to catch it in both hands, but the force of the attack drives him to his knees as -- QUARITCH pushes the knife down inexorably, until Jake is pinned against a rock, the blade now inches from his throat. INSIDE THE LINK Jake is straining to stay conscious, to stay connected as -- THE KNIFE reaches his throat as -- THWAP! AN ARROW APPEARS in Quaritch's chest. He looks up. NEYTIRI STANDS -- a FURY released. A classic archer figure, she NOCKS another arrow. Then draws and releases smoothly. TH-WHAP! The machine TOPPLES off Jake and lies still. QUARITCH STARES at the two arrows in his chest. He touches the feathers of the ancient weapon, then -- with an ironic laugh -- he dies. NEYTIRI runs up, another arrow nocked, bow drawn.

She GRABS the mask and flashes to Jake's side -- puts the mask over his face and -- JAKE drags in breath after breath. He looks up at Neytiri, studying him as she holds him -- seeing his human body for the first time. Jake touches her face, his pale human hand against the blue of her skin.
