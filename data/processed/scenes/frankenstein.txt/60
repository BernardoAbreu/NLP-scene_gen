<L>__{ext graveyard night}
<A>__{stone monuments. bare trees. ivy covered ground. victor shoulder deep in a grave. shoveling. a lamp burns low. coffin night pitch black. the lid swings open, cascading dust and soil. victor peers down, holding the kerosene lamp high. victor's garret night tracking along the shelves, crammed now with formaldehyde jars of feet and hands, brains and kidneys, the occasional head staring through the glass, dead cats... ...and we find victor working into the wee hours. hunched over his specimens. candle flame flickering low. referring back to waldman's notes. making notations in arcane books such as "de occulta philosophia," by agrippa, and "le sciences et les arts d'alchimiste," by paracelsus. frankenstein estate late day a magnificent backdrop of mountains against a cloudless blue sky. tilt down to elizabeth and justine with the mansion distant. a steady breeze ripples the fields as elizabeth regards a stack of mail.}

<D>__{elizabeth. if it's true, travel into germany would be banned. you'd never get near ingolstadt.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{besides, they're only rumors.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<P>__{(beat, nods)}
<D>__{and not a word of them to father. he's agitated enough not hearing from victor.}
<C>__{justine}
<D>__{read him one of the old letters and rephrase it. we'll say it came today. it'll set his mind at ease.}
<A>__{elizabeth gives her a hug. they walk toward the mansion}
