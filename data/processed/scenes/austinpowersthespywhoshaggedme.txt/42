<D>__{there he is. that's my guru.}
<A>__{we see the guru pitka (played by mike), an indian man in a bright red sari.}
<C>__{felicity}
<D>__{guru, i'd like you to meet austin powers.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{how are you baby?}
<C>__{guru pitka}
<D>__{my chakras are aligned and i am in a perfect state of equipoise.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{good on ya. i don't know what that means but it sounds fab.}
<C>__{felicity}
<D>__{guru, we need some advice.}
<C>__{guru pitka}
<D>__{hold your horses and any other beasts of burden. i must lead my disciples in meditation and then i will help you.}
<A>__{the guru walks to the front of the room and the disciples sink to their knees.}
<C>__{disciples}
<D>__{ahhhhhh!}
<C>__{guru pitka}
<D>__{my name is the guru pitka. i am a spiritual teacher and i have combined many disparate disciplines into a unified movement of human potentiality and equipoise that i learned from my guru, the late guru shastri, a chaste man who died mysteriously of a disease that strangely had all the hallmarks of syphilis. he would say to me, sparky, love is all, life is breath.}
<C>__{disciples}
<D>__{ahhhhhh!}
<C>__{guru pitka}
<D>__{now, perhaps you are wondering where i got the nickname sparky. well, when we were young we used to play a game called "stinkmop". we would urinate into a bucket, dip a mop into it, and play tag. i did not care for "stinkmop" and a very wise old man said to me 'oh lighten up, sparky', and i don't know, the name kind of stuck.}
<C>__{disciples}
<D>__{ahhhhhhhh...}
<C>__{guru pitka}
<D>__{now, the reason i am a spiritualist instead of a therapist is that 'therapist' often becomes 'the rapist' and that will not help us attain potentiality. now what is potentiality? it is the ability to achieve those goals that we wish to achieve for ourselves. people often say to me that they feel "nowhere", and i am going to change that to "now here."}
<A>__{the guru holds up a card which says "nowhere = now here!"}
<C>__{disciples}
<D>__{ahhhhhhh...}
<C>__{guru pitka}
<D>__{and you have many assumptions about your goals, but when you "assume" you make an "ass" out of "u" and "me".}
<A>__{guru holds up a card which says "assume = ass u me."}
<C>__{disciples}
<D>__{ahhhhhhh....}
<C>__{guru pitka}
<D>__{the being, or that which we call 'ourselves', is not the tinker. it is not the taughts. it is the gap between the tinker and the taughts! we are not our mind, we are not our body, we are the gap!}
<A>__{guru holds up a card that says "not tinker, not taughts, but the gap" with the familiar gap font.}
<C>__{disciples}
<D>__{ahhhhh...}
<C>__{guru pitka}
<P>__{(rapid fire)}
<D>__{the heart of the matter is that you are the heart of the matter. there is no "i" in "team". beer before liquor, never sicker. don't take a wooden nickel. if your pipe is short and your pump is weak, you better stand close or you'll piss on your feet. he who goes to bed with itchy bum wakes up with smelly finger.}
<C>__{disciples}
<D>__{ahhhhh...}
<C>__{guru pitka}
<D>__{finally, the path to spiritual awakening requires the death of ego. leggo of my ego! let us end with the mantra: om ay vant yu uh... mo ay vant yu uh... mo ay vant yu hu.}
<C>__{disciples}
<P>__{(chanting)}
<D>__{om ay vant yu uh... mo ay vant yu uh... mo ay vant yu hu.}

<D>__{how can i help you?}

<C>__{guru pitka}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{you know my bits and pieces are a bit sleepy.}
<C>__{guru pitka}
<D>__{i'm not understanding.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{i've forgotten the steps to the mummy daddy dance.}
<C>__{guru pitka}
<D>__{still not clear.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{my flag's at half mast and no one will salute it.}
<C>__{guru pitka}
<D>__{sorry?}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{my willie don't work.}
<C>__{guru pitka}
<D>__{why are you beating around the bush?}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{that's my problem.}
<C>__{guru pitka}
<D>__{ohhhhh, i get it.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{no, i don't get it.}
<C>__{felicity}
<D>__{he's impotent!}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{alright, easy.}
<P>__{(to guru)}
<D>__{felicity and i were all set for some hump olympics and i couldn't bat for six.}
<C>__{guru pitka}
<D>__{oh, yes, i see.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{you have no idea what i'm saying, do you?}
<C>__{guru pitka}
<D>__{not a word.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{guru, i've lost my mojo.}
<C>__{guru pitka}
<D>__{oh, mojo! you should have said so. well, you've lost your mojo because your chakras are misaligned. you have lost love.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{lost love? oh, you mean vanessa?}
<C>__{felicity}
<D>__{who's vanessa?}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{she was an evil robot minion of dr. evil. i couldn't have loved her.}
<C>__{guru pitka}
<D>__{denial ain't just a river in egypt, buddy. you will only get your mojo back when you surround yourself with love.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{oh, i get what you're saying now! he's talking about free love, baby! tune in, turn on, and drop out!}
<C>__{guru pitka}
<D>__{i am talking about true love. you must stay and study until you are worthy.}
<C>__{austin}
<D>__{no way, man. the only way to surround yourself with love is to throw a swinging shin dig! yeah, baby, yeah!}
