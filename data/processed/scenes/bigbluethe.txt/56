<A>__{they're at a table on a terrace that overlooks the sea. they've just arrived and all around them people are lunching away furiously. enzo beckons to a passing waiter who comes to the table. he's a very handsome, slightly effeminate young man.}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(to waiter)}
<D>__{"spaghetti del mare"}
<P>__{(to jacques)}
<D>__{it's delicious here. it's the one thing they really know how to make.}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{del mare for two?}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(nodding quickly)}
<D>__{yes, sure, for two.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{and a bottle of "frascatti". two bottles!}
<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{si signore, grazie mille.}
<A>__{the waiter hurries away. enzo watches his departure, then thoughtfully.}
<C>__{enzo}
<D>__{he moves just like a woman.}
<P>__{(then, as if he were speaking to jacques)}
<D>__{it must be hard to live in two worlds like that, huh? to breathe in one, swim in the other...}
<A>__{jacques nods without really knowing.}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(suddenly louder)}
<D>__{anyway! nothing beats a sexy broad! huh, jacques!}
<A>__{enzo starts laughing. jacques would like to crawl under the table.}
