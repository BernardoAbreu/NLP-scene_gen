<A>__{mater as he approaches a glass enclosed rock garden where a pitty rakes rocks with precision. he knocks on the glass with his hook.}

<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{mater, listen. this isn't radiator springs.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{you're just realizing that? boy, that jet lag really done a number on you.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{mater, look things are different over here. which means maybe you should, you know, act a little different too.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{different than what?}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{well, just... help me out here, buddy. i }
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{you need help? shoot, why didn't you just say so? that's what a tow truck does. hey, looky there, it's mr. san francisco!}

<C>__{mater}
<D>__{i will introduce you.}

<C>__{mater}
<P>__{(already on his way)}

<C>__{mater}
<P>__{(to francesco)}
<D>__{excuse me. can i get a picture with you?}
<C>__{francesco}
<D>__{anything for mcqueen's friend.}
<A>__{as mater poses for a photo with francesco:}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{miss sally is gonna flip when she sees this. she's lightning mcqueen's girlfriend.}
<C>__{francesco}
<D>__{oooh.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{she's a big fan of yours.}
<C>__{francesco}
<D>__{hey, she has good taste.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{mater's prone to exaggeration. i wouldn't say she's a "big" fan.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{you're right. she's a huge fan. she goes on and on about your open wheels here.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{mentioning it once doesn't qualify as going "on and on."}
<C>__{francesco}
<D>__{francesco is familiar with this reaction to francesco. women respect a car that has nothing to hide.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{yeah, uh...}
<C>__{francesco}
<D>__{let us have a toast.}
<A>__{mcqueen doesn't like where this is going, covers.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{let's.}
<C>__{francesco}
<P>__{(raising a drink)}
<D>__{i dedicate my win tomorrow... to miss sally.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{oh, sorry. i already dedicated my win tomorrow to her. so if we both do it, it's really not so special. besides, i don't have a drink.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{i will go get you one. you mind if i borrow a few bucks for one of them drinks?}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<P>__{(could kill him)}
<D>__{they're free, mater.}
<C>__{mater}
<D>__{free? well, shoot, what am i doing here?}
<A>__{mater zips off.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{i should probably go keep an eye on him. see you at the race.}
<A>__{mcqueen starts to leave.}
<C>__{francesco}
<D>__{yes, you will see francesco. but not like this.}
<A>__{francesco does a 180, so his rear end now faces mcqueen.}
<C>__{francesco}
<D>__{you will see him like this, as he drives away from you.}
<A>__{francesco wears a bumper sticker that says "ciao, mcqueen!"}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{that's cute. so you had one of those made up for all the racers?}
<C>__{francesco}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{he rolls off.}
<C>__{mcqueen}
<D>__{he is so getting beat tomorrow.}
