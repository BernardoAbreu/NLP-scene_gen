<A>__{this is what all the preparation was for. tables, lights, balloons, the guests dancing on the hardwood floor, at the base of the gazebo. the bride and groom among them, relaxed and happy. two who are one.}
<B>__{pan to...}
<A>__{... the stage, the band playing. julianne conferring with the twins and the band leader, clear that she's giving the instructions. then, she takes her glass of champagne to the microphone... ... klunks it, for silence. the band stops. the dancers follow. all eyes are comfortably turned to the maid of honor. she looks to the couple. just below her. then, to the crowd...}

<D>__{i'm a writer, too, not as good as michael. but i do steal from quality.}
<A>__{she raises her glass. everyone at the table does the same.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{this is to my best friend. on the occasion of his wedding.}
<A>__{shouts of support, a few whistles. silence. she tells michael...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{if i have truly come to know your bride as my new sister. this is in her heart...}
<A>__{she has to stop. swallows. because she will not let herself cry.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{"understand. i will slip quietly away from the noisy crowd when i see the pale stars rising, blooming, over the oaks."}
<A>__{deep breath. looks in his eyes.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{"i will pursue solitary pathways through the pale twilit meadows, with only this one dream: you come too."}
<A>__{a hush. sharp applause. from four hundred hands. but not from his. he is too moved. too understanding of what he has heard.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i don't have a wedding gift. but this is on loan. until you two find your song...}
<A>__{and with that the band begins. the opening phrases of a song we have come to know. michael seems overwhelmed. julianne nods toward the gazebo... ... michael takes his bride's hand, leads her up the stairs, into his arms, as the twins step to the microphone, and guests begin to applaud an unscheduled wedding dance...}

<A>__{soft two part harmony. as perfect as the words.}
<D>__{mandy sammy}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{you're lovely. with your smile so warm, and your cheeks so soft, there is nothing for me but to love you, just the way you look tonight.}
<A>__{julianne can cry now. because she's tied with half the place.}
<D>__{mandy sammy}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{with each word, your tenderness grows, tearing my fears apart... and the laugh that wrinkles your nose, touches my foolish heart.}
<A>__{julianne begins to sing. unheard. unseen. even by the man she's singing to...}
<D>__{julianne mandy sammy}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{you're lovely, please don't ever change, keep that breathless charm, darling, please arrange it, cos i love you... just the way you look tonight.}
<A>__{the band keeps playing. the dance goes on. two people lost in each other. the way it's supposed to be.}
