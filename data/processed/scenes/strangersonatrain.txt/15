<L>__{interior cubicle}
<A>__{once inside, the sounds of the music playing from other parts of the shop are heard but very faintly. the piano tuning still goes on, but less stridently. miriam and guy are cooped together in the close quarters.}
<C>__{miriam}
<P>__{(intimately)}
<D>__{now this is cosier. sort of like old times, isn't it, guy?}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(coldly)}
<D>__{oh, skip it, miriam. it's pretty late to start flirting with a discarded husband. especially when you're going to have another man's baby.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{do you know, i think you're handsomer than ever?}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{let's see your lawyer and get this over with.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{did you bring the money, guy? lawyers are expensive.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(taking money from his wallet)}
<D>__{here it is.}
<C>__{miriam}
<P>__{(taking the money greedily)}
<D>__{if i'd known what all that tennis nonsense of yours was going to lead to, i wouldn't have run out on you.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{what are you trying to say, miriam? come out with it.}
<C>__{miriam}
<P>__{(tucking the bills away)}
<D>__{i'm not getting a divorce.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(tense and angry)}
<D>__{why, you little doublecrosser. i didn't want this divorce, you did. that's what you've been harping about for the past year.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{it's a woman's privilege to change her mind... now i can shop for some pretty clothes. i wouldn't want you to be ashamed of me in washington when we go to all those dinners and swanky parties.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{and what do you mean by that?}
<C>__{miriam}
<P>__{(coyly)}
<D>__{don't look so mad, guy. you always smile when your picture is being taken for the papers.}
<C>__{miriam }
<D>__{especially when you have anne burton hanging on your arm.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{let's not talk about anne burton.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{so, it's really serious between you two? well, you can throw your dreams about her into the ashcan. guy, i'm coming to washington.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{to have my baby and be with you.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{why me? it's not my baby.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{but people don't know that, guy, do they? it would make a pretty story, wouldn't it the senator's daughter involved with a married man who's about to become a father.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(furiously)}
<D>__{you black conniving little liar!}
<A>__{a few people in the shop look around as guy's voice rises above the sound of the record playing.}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{keep your voice down.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{what happened? did he run out on you?}
<C>__{miriam}
<D>__{no man runs out on me. not even you.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{you're a liar and a cheat, miriam. you've wanted to get rid of me long enough and now i will go you one better i never want to see or hear of you again.}
<C>__{miriam}
<P>__{(demurely)}
<D>__{i could be very pathetic as the deserted little mother in a courtroom, guy. think it over. who would believe you?}
<A>__{guy seizes her angrily and in so doing, knocks the tone arm across the record with a loud screech. from outside we can see heads turn. mr. hargreaves, the manager, is very disturbed. med. shot through glass partition from hargreaves' viewpoint we see guy gripping miriam's arms and apparently addressing her in a threatening manner, although we do not hear his words. the smile has faded from miriam's face and something like cringing fear has taken its place. she is drawn and tense and seems to cower beneath guy's rage. mr. hargreaves moves forward and opens guy's tirade.}
<C>__{guy}
<D>__{...that's what should happen to people like you. and if i...}
<C>__{hargreaves}
<P>__{(interrupts)}
<D>__{break it up, folks. this isn't the place for a family quarrel.}
<C>__{guy}
<P>__{(his eyes blazing)}
<D>__{sorry. i'm leaving.}
<A>__{he starts to exit from the booth. miriam grabs his arm and screams at him:}
<C>__{miriam}
<P>__{(yelling like a fishwife)}
<D>__{you heard what i said, guy haines. you can't throw me away like an old shoe. i'm coming to washington to have my baby. tell that to the senate!}
<A>__{guy strides out of the store, the manager and a few customers turning around in surprise. the two customers in other booths, seeing the quarrel, open their doors simultaneously and miriam's tirade is climaxed by a cacophony of noise, a big symphony, loud hot music, and the apparently unaware piano tuner.}
