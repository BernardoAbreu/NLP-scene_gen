<A>__{wallowing in mud, the class does belly busters, atomic sit ups and the sadistic reverse push up, where trainees lie of their backs, place hands under shoulder blades and push their crotches skyward.}
<C>__{the chief}
<D>__{pain is your friend. you ally. it will keep you awake in times of emergency... it will tell you when you are seriously injured... it will keep you angry and remind you to finish the job and get the hell home. but you know the best thing about pain?}

<D>__{no, sir!}
<C>__{the chief}
<D>__{it lets you know that you aren't dead yet.}
<A>__{instructors roam, rasping orders, kicking students into proper position. jordan struggles with the reverses.}
<C>__{instructor pyro}
<D>__{go regulation if you can't do the reverses, o'neil.}
<A>__{she looks around. a lot of the guys are having trouble with the reverses, not just her.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{thank you, sir. but i like these just fine.}
<C>__{instructor pyro}
<D>__{not doin' them very fine, o'neil.}
<C>__{jordan}
<D>__{i will try anyway, sir.}
<C>__{instructor pyro}
<D>__{you'll try what we tell you to try, o'neil. go regulation.}
<A>__{she switches to standard push ups, her face disappearing into the ooze with every downstroke. soon the chief's boots slosh into frame. he's still looking for his human sacrifice.}
