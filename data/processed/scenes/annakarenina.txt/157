<L>__{interior dining room, oblonsky house night}
<A>__{dinner for eight clockwise, oblonsky, countess nordston, prince shcher batsky, kitty, karenin, dolly, levin and princess shcherbatsky. two servants and matvey serve at the table, clearing away the "carp with asparagus." the princess is challenging karenin.}
<C>__{princess shcherbatsky}
<D>__{you petersburgers think yourselves so de bon ton compared with dull, old fashioned moscow, but we know how to do things only the other day, i hear, vasya pryachnikov fought a duel with kvitsky and killed him.}
<A>__{oblonskky attempts to divert the conversation.}
<C>__{oblonsky}
<D>__{well, what's this government commission, karenin . . . ?}
<A>__{but karenin ignores him. oblonsky looks on helplessly.}
<C>__{karenin}
<D>__{what was the challenge about?}
<C>__{princess shcherbatsky}
<D>__{pryachnikov's wife, naturally.}
<C>__{prince shcherbatsky}
<D>__{it was a matter of honour, defending a woman's honour . . .}
<A>__{karenin remains cool.}
<C>__{karenin}
<D>__{it sounds like barbarism to me . . . and what if the lover had killed the husband? would that have preserved the wife's honour too?}
<C>__{countess nordston}
<D>__{still, not many of us can say that our lover died for love!}
<C>__{karenin}
<D>__{love? thou shall not covet thy neighbour's wife.}
<C>__{countess nordston}
<D>__{would you die for love, konstantin dmitrich?}
<C>__{levin}
<D>__{i would. but not for my neighbour's wife.}
<A>__{levin is nettled to find that he seems to have made a joke, for the countess especially. kitty remains serious, watching levin, loving him.}
<C>__{levin }
<D>__{an impure love is not love, to me. to admire another man's wife is a pleasant thing, but sensual desire indulged for its own sake is greed, a kind of gluttony, and a misuse of something sacred which is given to us so that we may choose the one person with whom to fulfill our humanness. otherwise we might as well be cattle.}
<C>__{countess nordston}
<D>__{ah, an idealist!}
<A>__{reconciliatory laughter eases the atmosphere. levin feels abashed at coming out of his shell. he steals a glance at kitty and finds her looking at him. she smiles at him and drops her eyes.}
