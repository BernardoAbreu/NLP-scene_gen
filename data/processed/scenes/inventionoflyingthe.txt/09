<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i'm only doing this as a favor for my cousin greg. he keeps begging me to go out on a date with you. he says you're funny.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{greg's a good friend.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{where are we eating tonight?}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{a cute little place called la bonisera in west hollywood.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{you obviously don't have very much money but that's not necessarily a deal breaker.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i have very little money.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i also don't really care about a guy who knows all the latest, hippest restaurants.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i don't know any of them.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{in fact, there are very few things in life that i care about all that much. the only things i have to offer myself or anyone else are my good looks and my affected sense of quirkiness which artistically inclined men interpret as intellect.}
<C>__{jennifer }
<D>__{in fact, i think my best trait is the fact that i've made very few mistakes: socially, academically, financially or romantically. i take very few risks and therefore lead a relatively happy and light hearted existence. mostly though, i'm a kind, sweet person with the potential of genuinely becoming a vital and interesting human being the day i take the energy i expend on hyper self reflexivity and apply it to actual action in the reality of my life.}
<C>__{mark}
<D>__{i found that boring and started thinking about this place's fish tacos.}
