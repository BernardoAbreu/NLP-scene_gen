<L>__{interior janie dale's penthouse}
<A>__{it is a very small penthouse. klute & bree stand in the small living room waiting for janie dale. there are two very casually dressed prostitutes sitting around the living room. one sits at an upright piano playing of all things strangers in the night. another one sits on a couch talking to a wall street broker who is spending his lunch hour. klute finds himself staring down into a pile of pornography magazines on the coffee table. bree is amused at his discomfort. janie dale, the madame, who has been on the phone in the back, puts the receiver down and crosses to the girl on the couch. janie looks and talks a bit like lauren bacall.}

<D>__{try momma reese.}
<A>__{this is a cheaper apartient than janie dale's the girls look cheaper, and the customers, rather than wall street lawyers and brokers, look more like out of town salesmen who stay at local motor inns. momma reese is older than janie dale, heavier and with no pretense at chic. she indicates that she has not seen arlyn in some time.}
