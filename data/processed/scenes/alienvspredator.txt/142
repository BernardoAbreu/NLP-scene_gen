<A>__{scar lies in the snow. a fallen warrior. bloodied and broken, but dying with honor. lex cradles his head in her hands. scar reaches for his ceremonial dagger, but is just too weak. lex helps it into his hands, and for a moment scar holds the blade before his own chest. almost as if he intended to stab himself. it's a striking image, but one that will make little sense until the end of the picture.}

<A>__{and then scar dies. the blade falling unused by his side. for a moment, the storm seems to reduce in fury. the sky clears to reveal the predator spacecraft hovering directly above the remnants of the whaling station. on a low rise overlooking the battleground stand three dozen predator elders. they had seen everything. four more predators pick up scar's body and carry him toward a long ramp leading up to the belly of the spacecraft. lex stares at the army of predators. there is a tense standoff. a predator elder stares at the human woman. he sees the distinctive predator warrior scar on her forehead. the same scar that he and all the others wear. then he nods in respect. as the rest of the predators file back onto the spacecraft, the predator elder hands lex his spear. the gesture has the feeling of ancient ceremony about it. the message is clear. lex has become a hunter. lex takes the spear. and the predator elder turns back to the spaceship. as he turns, the main thrusters of the predator craft are starting to fire up. causing a snowstorm beneath the ship. lex is covered in blood and bruises, holding the warrior's spear and marked with the predator warrior scar, lex has never looked more formidable. she seems more predator than human. she watches the spacecraft as it rises into the heavens, becoming lost in the storm. lex takes something from her pocket. it's sebastian's bottle cap. she turns it over in her hand, the emotion of the moment clear. lex looks up to the heavens. a break in the storm reveals a giant full moon hanging in the sky. the moon she had been looking at just the other night with sebastian. she closes her hand around the bottle cap and looks up to the skies.}
