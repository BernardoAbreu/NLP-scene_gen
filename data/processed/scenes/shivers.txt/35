<L>__{interior st. luc's office night}
<A>__{st. luc sits at his desk and opens parkins' file. forsythe, about twenty three, earthy and humorous, comes in with an armful of papers and records, which she throws in groups on to st. luc's desk.}
<C>__{forsythe}
<P>__{(distributing papers)}
<D>__{ok, roger. here's the stuff you wanted. files on horsefield, tudor, swinburne, and velakofsky. papers published by hobbes, linsky, and lefebvre in a couple of issues of the bulletin of the canadian medical association and also the journal of the american medical association. and, as an added extra, a couple of odds and ends from the files i helped compile before your time here, doctor. i thought they might interest you.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{that's great, forsythe, great. thanks.}
<C>__{forsythe}
<D>__{do i get a kiss?}
<A>__{st. luc is absorbed in his papers and doesn't respond. forsythe prods his shoulder. he looks up at her.}
<C>__{forsythe}
<D>__{kiss, kiss?}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{uh, ok. sure.}
<A>__{they kiss, st. luc making sure that it doesn't get too heavy.}
<C>__{forsythe}
<D>__{another kiss?}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{c'mon, forsythe. are there any more on the list?}
<C>__{forsythe}
<D>__{no. dotty's the last.}
<A>__{the telephone rings. st. luc picks it up.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{rollo }
<D>__{that you, rog?}
<C>__{st. luc}
<P>__{(not recognizing the voice)}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{rollo }
<D>__{it's me, rollo linsky. remember me?}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{rollo! how'sa boy? i was just thinking about you.}
<A>__{realizing that the conversation is likely to be a long one, forsythe gets off the desk and walks over to a metal locker in the corner, which she opens. inside are her street clothes. she begins to take off her nurse's uniform in full view of st. luc, not being obvious about the distraction she's providing, but not taking pains to hurry dressing or be modest either. in the scene that follows we cut among three basic things: rollo in his lab, talking and eating; st. luc in his office, watching forsythe get undressed and then dressed; and hobbes's notes and scribblings, which do not necessarily have to be on the screen long enough to be completely read. hobbes's notes are there more to convince the viewer that they exist and to provide flavor than to transfer information.}
<C>__{st. luc}
<D>__{been glancing at some of your publications on your work with hobbes.}
