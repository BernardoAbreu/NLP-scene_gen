<L>__{exterior pier night}
<A>__{with the speed and grace of a panther, milady runs down the gangplank, climbs into the saddle of one of her bodyguard's horses, and gallops off. athos appears moments later, leaps into the saddle of another horse. and gives chase.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior harbor road night}
<A>__{milady whips her horse, drives it onward. but athos overtakes, leaps from his saddle, takes her into his arms. they fall to the ground with a crash. milady grabs the deadly comb from her hair, grips the dagger's handle. athos, stunned from breaking their fall, rolls to his side. milady peers at his face, vulnerable in the halflight. and lowers the dagger. she will not kill him. milady scrambles to her feet, runs toward a dark forest. but athos stands and shouts:}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{stop!!}
<A>__{milady takes a halting step, then turns to face him. athos holds his musket in a steady hand. a very long beat. milady takes a step closer. finally, she whispers, with love, with hate:}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{athos.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{how did you do it, sabine? how did you come back from the dead?}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{a kind gentleman took pity on me.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{i did not.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{no, count. you were too proud to listen to the truth. i learned the value of lies soon after.}
<A>__{athos grips the pistol tighter, as if to ward off the past and what it brings.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{give me the cardinal's treaty.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{then i will shoot.}
<A>__{athos cocks the trigger. milady whispers:}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{be kind. and aim for my heart.}
<A>__{athos' face is a mask of contradiction. he tries to pull the trigger, but it is not in him. milady recognizes his pain with a nod. she feels it, too. then, briefly, before she leaves him, milady speaks softly. the past, their love, and where it led them.}
<C>__{milady}
<D>__{i remember... everything.}
<A>__{she turns and runs away... directly into the arms of armand de winter. he has ridden, and he has followed, and he has finally found her here.}
<C>__{armand}
<D>__{countess de winter...}
<A>__{as d'artagnan, porthos, and aramis arrive on the scene...}
