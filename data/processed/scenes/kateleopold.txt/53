<L>__{interior living room night}
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(on the phone)}
<D>__{i don't know. it's just leopold. like cher. or goofy.}
<A>__{kate and leopold walk in wet and exhausted.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{never mind they just walked in. jesus. you look horrible.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{charlie, don't start. i haven't been this angry at you since you got me into that pyramid thing last year. if you make a wisecrack i'm going to burst into flame.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it wasn't a wisecrack. you do look horrible.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{i'm too tired for this now. i will just save it up and kill you tomorrow. help leopold out of his things and lets get him to bed.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i've something to say. to the both of you. i... nothing is what it seems. after witnessing mere weeks of this age it is painfully apparent i am outside of my acquaintance... i don't know how to proceed. i frankly... am in need of assistance. i'm sorry. i'm not very good at this. in the event you have missed it, i am apologizing.}
<A>__{there is a long pause.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{about time.}
<P>__{(he shakes leopold's hand reluctantly)}
<D>__{welcome back.}
<P>__{(he leaves)}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{don't mind him. his heart would be in the right place if he had a heart. surliness runs in my family.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{i understand. it practically races through mine.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{leopold, you made a joke. i mean one that's not at my expense. that's good.}
<A>__{they look at each other just a second too long.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{we'd better get to bed... that is...}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{yes... i start work...}
<P>__{(she looks at her watch)}
<D>__{in three and a half hours.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{oh, dear.}
<A>__{they self consciously head to their respective rooms.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{it's fine. i'm used to it.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{you mustn't get too used to it. you'll find life passes you by awfully quickly.}
<A>__{kate is struck by his vulnerability for the first time and is moved. she catches herself quickly however.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{thank you for...}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(waving it away)}
<D>__{oh!}
<A>__{they stand at their bedroom doors.}
<C>__{leopold}
<D>__{well, goodnight then.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{leopold?... i don't have a clear handle on this. perhaps i was wrong keeping you confined to the apartment all this time. i don't know when you'll be able return home... tomorrow i will start preparing you for the outside world. and... we'll find your way back. i promise.}
<A>__{leopold smiles, still shaken. a beat. they slowly close the doors to their respective rooms.}
