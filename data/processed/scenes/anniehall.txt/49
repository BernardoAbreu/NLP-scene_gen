<L>__{exterior country highway day}
<A>__{annie and alvy, in annie's vw, driving to their summerhouse. the camera moves with them as they pass a house with a lighted window, blooming foliage. there is no dialogue, but it is a comfortable quiet. classical music plays in the background.}

<C>__{alvy}
<P>__{(yelling out to her as she leaves the room)}
<D>__{yeah, grass, right? the illusion that it will make a white woman more like billie holiday.}

<D>__{oh, you you have to be artificially relaxed before we can go to bed?}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(closing the door)}
<D>__{well, what's the difference, anyway?}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{well, i will give you a shot of sodium pentothal. you can sleep through it.}
<C>__{annie}

<P>__{(she gets into bed and takes a puff of marijuana)}
<D>__{you should smoke some o' this. you'd be off the couch in no time.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{oh, come, you don't need that.}
<A>__{alvy, sitting down on the bed, moves over to annie and takes the weed from her.}
<C>__{annie}

<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{m'm, wait, i got a great idea.}
<P>__{(he gets up and goes over to the}
<D>__{closet, taking out a light bulb. he goes back to the bed and turns}
<P>__{out the lamp on the night table)}
<D>__{hang in there for a second. i got a little little artifact. a little erotic artifact, that that i brought up from the city, which i think, uh, is gonna be perfect.}
<P>__{(he turns the lamp back on, having}
<D>__{replaced the bulb with the red one}
<P>__{from the closet)}

<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{i don't know. you it's like you're you're removed.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{no, i'm fine.}
<A>__{as annie speaks, her inner self (ghostlike, moves up from the bed and) sits down on a chair, watching.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{u huh.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{i don't know, but you seem sort of distant.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{let's just do it, all right?}
<C>__{alvy}
<P>__{(kissing and caressing annie)}
<D>__{is it my imagination or are you just going through the motions?}
<C>__{annie's spirit}
<D>__{alvy, do you remember where i put my drawing pad? because while you two are doing that, i think i'm gonna do some drawing.}
<C>__{alvy}
<P>__{(reacting)}
<D>__{you see, that's what i call removed.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{oh, you have my body.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{yeah, but that's not that's no good. i want the whole thing.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(sighing)}
<D>__{well, i need grass and so do you.}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{well, it ruins it for me if you have grass}
<P>__{(clearing his throat)}
<D>__{because, you know, i'm, like, a comedian }
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{m'hm.}
<C>__{alvy}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{ so if i get a laugh from a person who's high, it doesn't count. you know 'cause they're always laughin'.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{were you always funny?}
<C>__{alvy}
<D>__{hey, what is this an interview? we're supposed to be making love.}
