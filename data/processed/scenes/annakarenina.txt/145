<A>__{a cab brings vronsky. the karenin coach is waiting outside. as vronsky approaches the door, it opens and kapitonich comes out with a folded rug. kapitonich is wrong footed by seeing him. karenin comes out of the door, into the gaslight. when he sees vronsky he hesitates for a fraction but con tinues. kapitonich is holding open the door of the coach. vronsky bows, karenin, expressionless, touches his hat and gets into the coach, taking the rug. vronsky walks into the house as the coach moves off.}
