<C>__{major hicks}
<D>__{dr. niko topopolosis?}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(correcting)}
<D>__{it's tatopoulos.}
<C>__{major hicks}
<D>__{right. the worm guy.}
<P>__{(to guards at blockade)}
<D>__{can someone get those people off the beach?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{excuse me, would you mind telling me what the hell i'm doing here?}
<C>__{major hicks}
<D>__{follow me.}
<A>__{the major leads nick up the beach away from the crowds.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you didn't answer my question. in fact, for the last 18 hours no one has answered any of my questions.}
<C>__{major hicks}
<D>__{we have a situation on our hands that requires your particular expertise.}
<A>__{angle destroyed village hut several soldiers and researchers are investigating the site when nick and the major walk past.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{look, i may work for the nuclear regulatory commission but accidents and spills are not my field.}
<C>__{major hicks}
<D>__{we know.}
<A>__{major hicks motions to some guards who clear a blockade away from a jungle pathway. major hicks takes the pathway.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{do you know that you just interrupted a three year study of the chernobyl earthworm?}
<C>__{major hicks}
<D>__{yeah, you're the worm guy.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{the radioactive contamination in that area altered the earthworm's dna! you have any idea what that means?}
<C>__{major hicks}
<D>__{no, but i have the feeling i'm about to find out.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{it means that due to a man made accident the chernobyl earthworms are now over seventeen percent larger than they were before. mutated by seventeen percent?}
<A>__{major hicks stops, turns to nick.}
<C>__{major hicks}
<P>__{(bemused)}
<D>__{seventeen percent, huh? sounds big.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{they're enormous! a new species created by man's recklessness. that's what i've been trying to tell you, i'm only a biologist. i take radioactive samples and study them.}
<C>__{major hicks}
<D>__{then you're perfect.}
<P>__{(pointing to the ground)}
<D>__{here's your radioactive sample. study it.}
<A>__{with that major hicks walks away.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what sample?}
<C>__{major hicks}
<D>__{you're standing on it.}
<A>__{nick looks down, sees nothing.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i don't see it.}
<P>__{(no response)}
<D>__{where is it?}
<A>__{we crane up above him, pulling back farther and farther, until we see he's standing inside of a 15 yard long gigantic footprint in the sand.}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{i don't see it!}
<A>__{two scientists have spread out a tape measure to document its length as two others inspect it with geiger counters. nick sees them and realizes he's standing in a remarkable discovery. he looks up ahead and sees... overhead titlt shot foot steps... five gigantic footsteps in front of him. other researchers examining the prints with all kinds of equipment. geiger counters, click, clicking away. nick is stunned.}
