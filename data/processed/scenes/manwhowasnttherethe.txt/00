<A>__{black.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{yeah, i worked in a barbershop. but i never considered myself a barber...}
<A>__{we track back from a barber's pole.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...i stumbled into it well, married into it more precisely...}
<A>__{we track back from a shopkeeper's bell triggered by an opening door. the pull back and tilt down show the top of the head of a customer entering in slow motion.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...i wasn't my establishment. like the fella says, i only work here...}
<A>__{we track along a shelf backed by a mirror and holding pomade, aftershave, hair tonic, a whisk brush.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...the dump was 200 feet square, with five chairs, or stations as we call 'em, even though there were only two of us working...}
<A>__{we track in on a big man in a barber's smock scissoring across a lock of hair that he pulls taut between two fingers of one hand. in slow motion, he laughs and chats.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...frank raffo, my brother in law, was the principal barber. and man, could he talk...}
<A>__{another man in a barber's smock is running electric clippers across a child's head. a cigarette between his lips.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...now maybe if you're eleven or twelve years old, frank's got an interesting point of view, but sometimes it got on my nerves. not that i'd complain, mind you. like i said, he was the principal barber. frank's father august they called him guzzi had worked the heads up in santa rosa for thirty five years until his ticker stopped in the middle of a junior flat top. he left the shop to frankie free and clear. and that seemed to satisfy all of frank's ambitions: cutting the hair and chewing the fat. me, i don't talk much...}
<A>__{he plucks the cigarette from his mouth and taps its ash into a tray.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...i just cut the hair...}
<B>__{late in the day}
<A>__{the barbershop is empty of customers. late sun slants in through the front window. the two barbers the narrator and his brother in law sit in two of the barber chairs, idly reading magazines.}
<C>__{frank}

<C>__{ed}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{jesus...}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{now, being a barber is a lot like being a barman or a soda jerk; there's not much to it once you've learned the basic moves. for the kids there's the butch, or the heinie...}
<A>__{we cut to examples of the haircuts as they are ticked off:}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...the flat top, the ivy, the crew, the vanguard, the junior contour and, occasionally, the executive contour. adults get variations on the same, along with the duck butt, the timberline...}
<A>__{ed trims the fringe around a balding head.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...and something we call the alpine rope toss.}
<A>__{he snips one long lonely strand of hair and carefully drapes it across a bald pate.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...i lived in a little bungalow on napa street. the place was ok, i guess; it had an electric ice box, gas hearth, and a garbage grinder build into the sink. you might say i had it made.}
<A>__{we float slowly toward a white bungalow on a quiet street as a black coupe pulls into the driveway.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...oh yeah. there was one other thing...}
<A>__{we track in through a bedroom door to discover a woman putting on a girdle.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...doris kept the books at nirdlinger's, a small department store on main street. unlike me, doris liked the work, accounting; she liked knowing where everything stood. and she got a ten per cent employee discount on whatever she wanted nylon stockings...}
<A>__{close on her legs as she rolls up a stocking and clips it to the garter.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...make up, and perfume...}
<A>__{close on an atomiser misting her bosom with jungle gardenia by tuvache.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...she wore a lot of perfume.}
<A>__{doris in a flouncy dress is setting coasters on a coffee table.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...doris's boss, big dave brewster, was married to ann nirdlinger, the department store heiress. tonight they were coming over for dinner as doris said, we were 'entertaining'...}
<A>__{ed sits on the living room davenport in an uncomfortable suit, smoking.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...me, i don't like entertaining.}
<A>__{the doorbell rings.}

<C>__{dave}
<D>__{japs had us pinned down in buna for something like six weeks. well, i gotta tell ya, i thought we had it tough, but, jesus, we had supply. they were eating grubs, nuts, thistles. when we finally up and bust off the beach we found arnie bragg, kid missing on recon; the japs had eaten the sonofabitch, if you'll pardon the, uh... and this was a scrawny, pimply kid too, nothin' to write home about. i mean, i never would've, ya know, so what do i say, honey? when i don't like dinner, what do i say?}
<A>__{ann smiles wanly.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{...i say, jesus, honey, arnie bragg again?!}
<A>__{he roars with laughter. ed gives an acknowledging smile.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{...arnie bragg again?!}
<A>__{he dries his eyes with the corner of a napkin.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{...were you in the service, ed?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{no, dave, i wasn't.}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{ed was 4f on account of his fallen arches.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{mm, that's tough.}
<B>__{front porch}
<A>__{ed is standing alone on the porch, watching the sun go down. crickets chirp. from inside the house we hear laughter and clattering dishes.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...yeah... i guess doris liked all that he man stuff. sometimes i had the feeling that she and big dave were a lot closer than they let on...}
<A>__{he turns and looks through the screen door into the house. across the dim living room we can see a sliver of the brightly lit kitchen. big dave, wearing a frilly apron, stands at the counter drying dishes. his broad back heaves with laughter while doris, just hidden by the wall, chats away, handing dishes across.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...the signs were all there plain enough not that i was gonna prance about it, mind you. it's a free country.}
<A>__{footsteps approach the front porch. with the squeak of the screen door, big dave emerges.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{holding down the porch area?}
<A>__{ed gives a half grin of wry acknowledgement. big dave relaxes, forearms against the porch railing, gazing out at the front lawn.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{...that's quite a wife you got there.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{mm.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{she's a rare one.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{how's business, dave?}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{couldn't be better. these're boom times in retailing. we're opening another store, big dave's annex, there on garson. this is strictly haberdashery casual wear, pyjamas, ladies' foundations and undergarments. matter of fact, i'm thinking of making doris the comptroller. how're things at the, uh, the barbershop?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{all right, i guess.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{...fine. fine. well, you might want to drop by the annex when we open, update your suit 'course, you're in the smock all day.}
<A>__{he chuckles.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{...say, where do you get those things anyway?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{specialty store down in sacramento.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<A>__{there is a silence. at length, gazing out at the lawn, big dave clears his throat.}
<B>__{church}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{doris and i went to church once a week...}
<A>__{we are tilting down a long stained glass window depicting the resurrection of christ.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...usually tuesday night...}
<A>__{faintly, we hear an amplified voice:}
<C>__{caller}
<D>__{i... seven...}
<A>__{ed sits at a long table, staring at the window, a lit cigarette in his mouth.}
<C>__{caller}
<D>__{...bee... four...}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{doris wasn't big on divine worship...}
<A>__{doris is concentrating on the six cards spread in front of her.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...and i doubt if she believed in life everlasting; she'd most likely tell you that our reward is on this earth and bingo is probably the extent of it...}
<A>__{still focused on her cards, doris mutters to ed:}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{watch your card, honey.}
<C>__{caller}
<D>__{i... sixteen...}
<A>__{ed continues to gaze off at the window, smoke pluming from his cigarette.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{i wasn't crazy about the game, but, i don't know, it made her happy, and i found the setting peaceful.}
<C>__{caller}
<D>__{gee... nine...}
<A>__{doris sucks in her breath.}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{jesus, bingo bingo!}
<B>__{barbershop}
<A>__{sun slants in through the big window at the end of the day. ed sweeps hair trimmings, looking intently down at the floor, a cigarette dangling from his lip. frank sits on one of the vinyl waiting chairs, talking at ed's back.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{...so you tie your own flies, ed. i mean, if you're really serious. you tie your own flies, you do a i know it's matickless, i know, people say, hey, you can buy flies at the store but you can buy your fish at the store, ed, you see what i'm saying?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{the point is there's a certain art to the process. the point is not merely to provide, and let me point out, these fish are not as dumb as you might think.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{sportsmanship! that's my pointerior june fly, ed? mosquito? which of these? well, what fish do you seek?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{sure, go to the store. go there, describe to the man where you will be fishing, and for what, and the weather conditions, sun, no sun, whatnot, and so forth, and then you might as well have the man go ahead and sell you the goddamn fish, ed...}
<A>__{we see a black suited figure approaching through the windows at the far end of the shop. he is almost blown out by the late day sunlight hitting the window.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{...my point is, this is a man who knows nothing no matter how much you tell him, so sell him the goddamn fish, ed.}
<A>__{the bell over the front door tinkles, and the swarthy middle aged man walks in. he is well dressed perhaps a little too snazzily for this small town and has a sporty pencil mustache.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{ok, boys, which of you gets the privilege?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we're just closing, friend.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{oh, happy days! i wish i was doing well enough to turn away business! more power to ya, brother! the public be damned!}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{hey, what's your problem, friend? this is a business establishment with posted hours }
<A>__{ed cuts in with a jerk of the head.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i will take care of him, go ahead, frank. have a seat, mister.}
<A>__{frank looks sourly at the stranger.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{...you sure, eddie?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{yeah, yeah go home.}
<A>__{as frank leaves:}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{in your ear, mister.}
<A>__{the stranger chuckles.}
<C>__{stranger}
<D>__{oh, those fiery mediterraneans. say! not so fast there, brother }
<A>__{ed has switched on the clippers, but the stranger waves him back; he lifts off a toupee.}
<C>__{stranger}
<D>__{...pretty good, huh? fools even the experts. 100 percent human hair, handcrafted by jacques of san francisco, and i'd hate to have to tell you what i paid for it.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{stranger}
<D>__{yes, it's a nice rug. i'm paying for it down on the installment plan...}
<A>__{ed starts to trim the stranger's fringe.}
<C>__{stranger}
<D>__{...a lot of folks live with the pate exposed. they say the dames think it's sexy. but for my money it's just not good grooming and grooming, my friend, is probably the most important thing in business after personality, of course...}
<A>__{he twists around to offer his hand.}
<C>__{stranger}
<D>__{...creighton tolliver, pleased to know ya.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{ed crane. what brings you to santa rosa?}
<C>__{creighton}
<D>__{a goose, friend. i was chasing a wild goose. ed, have you ever heard of venture capital?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{uh }
<C>__{creighton}
<D>__{well, it's the wildest goose there is. risk money. very speculative. except, ed, in certain situations, it's not, see? i thought i had a prospect here. well, i make the haul up and this lousy so and so tells me his situation has changed all his capital's gonna be tied up in expansion plans of his own. thank you, mother! pop goes another bubble! it's only the biggest business opportunity since henry ford and i can't seem to interest a soul!}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{that right.}
<C>__{creighton}
<D>__{it's called dry cleaning. you heard me right, brother, 'dry cleaning' wash without water, no suds, no tumble, no stress on the clothes. it's all done with chemicals, friend, and your garments end up crisp and fresh. and here's the capper: no shrinkage.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{huh.}
<C>__{creighton}
<D>__{that's right! dry cleaning remember the name. it's going to revolutionize the laundry industry, and those that get in early are gonna bear the fruit away. all i need is $10,000 to open my first store, then i use its cash flow to finance another, and so on leap frog, bootstrap myself a whole chain. well, me and a partner. cleanliness, friend. there's money in it. there's a future. there's room to grow... say, that's looking pretty good. let's see it with the hairpiece on...}
<B>__{bathroom doorway}
<A>__{it is evening. ed leans against the bathroom doorjamb contemplatively off, hands thrust into his pockets, a cigarette between his lips pluming smoke.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{dry cleaning...}
<A>__{the reverse show doris soaking in the tub, reading a magazine.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...was i crazy to be thinking about it? was he a huckster, or opportunity, the real mccoy?}
<A>__{ed takes the cigarette from his mouth, exhales.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...my first instinct was, no, no, the whole idea was nuts. but maybe that was the instinct that kept me locked up in the barbershop, nose against the exit, afraid to try turning the knob. what if i could get the money?}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{honey?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{mm.}
<A>__{she lifts one leg and rests the heel on the rim of the tub.}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{shave my legs, will ya?}
<A>__{ed saunters over, perches on the tub and puts the cigarette back in his mouth to free his hands. he picks up a bar of soap and starts soaping the leg. he sets down the soap and picks up a safety razor. the razor takes long slow strokes along the lather, dark bits of hair flecking the white foam.}
<C>__{ed }
<D>__{...it was clean. no water. chemicals.}
<A>__{he shakes the razor in the tub. shavings float away across the soap slicked water.}
<C>__{doris}
<P>__{(absently, as she reads)}
<D>__{gimme a drag.}
<A>__{ed pulls the cigarette from his mouth between two fingers, uses the two fingers to flip it over, and holds it for doris as she sucks. he brings the cigarette, now marked with lipstick, back to his own mouth. she murmurs:}
<C>__{doris}
<D>__{...love ya, honey.}
<B>__{a door}
<A>__{we hear a voice, muffled through the door, breaking into laughter. a hand enters to knock.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{yeah, come in.}
<A>__{the door swings open to show creighton in his shirtsleeves sitting on the bed, talking on the phone. a tray of room service dishes sits near him. he is bald; his hairpiece sits on the pillow next to him.}
<C>__{creighton}
<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{ok... yeah. i will see you tomorrow.}
<A>__{he hangs up, looks quizzically at ed.}
<C>__{creighton}
<D>__{...oh, i thought you were the porter... can i help you?}
<A>__{ed stands awkwardly by the door.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{...i'm, uh, ed.}
<A>__{the stranger's look does not show recognition.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{...ed crane. remember? today?}
<C>__{creighton}
<D>__{sorry, friend, i, uh, you got me at a disadvantage.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i'm, uh, i'm the barber.}
<C>__{creighton}
<D>__{jesus! the barber! i will be a sonofagun. why didn't you say so? 'course the barber.}
<A>__{ed nods, his smile faint and forced.}
<C>__{creighton}
<D>__{...i didn't recognize you without the smock. did i damn did i leave something at the shop?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{no. i might be interested in that, uh, business proposition }
<A>__{creighton, surprised, quickly picks up his hairpiece and arranges it on his head.}
<C>__{creighton}
<D>__{you got the dough?!}

<C>__{creighton}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{what's involved, aside from putting up the money? what're you looking for the partner to do?}
<C>__{creighton}
<D>__{do? hell, nothing. well, you'll want to keep tabs on your investment, of course, but i'm looking for a silent partner. i've done the research, i've contacted the vendors, the deal is set. i'm just looking for venture capital, friend. disappear if you want, check in whenever you like i want the dough; i don't take attendance.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{and how do we share }
<C>__{creighton}
<D>__{fifty fifty, straight down the line. you and me. finance and expertise. so you've got the dough then, do ya?}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{i will have it in a week.}
<C>__{creighton}
<D>__{well, i will be damned. the barber! and i thought this trip was a bust. well...}
<A>__{he reaches for a bottle of bonded whiskey on the night stand and hands ed a glass.}

<D>__{...it just goes to show, when one door slams shut, another one opens. here's to ya, uh...}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{ed.}
<A>__{they both knock back the whiskey. creighton leans back and gives ed a heavy lidded stare, a faint smile on his lips, his hairpiece slightly askew. ed stares back. after a beat, without taking his eyes of ed, creighton reaches up and loosens his tie. an almost imperceptible wink. ed stares.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{...was that a pass?}
<C>__{creighton}
<P>__{(hoarsely)}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{ed}
<D>__{you're out of line, mister.}
<A>__{creighton throws up his hands apologetically.}
