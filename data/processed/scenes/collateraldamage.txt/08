<A>__{they turn the hose on the flames as gordy moves to the trapped firefighter. gordy tries lifting the debris, can't budge it. he starts chopping at it with the axe. chunks of plaster fly as the axe bites again and again. gordy hacks off a large piece of debris. he levers his axe under the portion still trapping the firefighter. mike moves to help. gordy heaves up on the axe. the debris lifts. he heaves harder. it lifts more, until... mike slides the firefighter out. gordy yanks his axe free. the debris collapses. gordy moves to the firefighter.}
