<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{oh my god! he's here!}
<A>__{jennifer sweeps some of the pieces frantically under the sofa and tries to adjust her outfit on the way to the door. david just stares in shock at the shattered plastic. jennifer reaches the front door and wets her lips. she fluffs her hair quickly, sticks out her chest then swings it open.}
<B>__{different angle. front door.}
<A>__{jennifer steps forward with her sexiest smile, but it isn't mark davis on the other side. dick van dyke stands across the threshold in a tv repairman's outfit. jennifer looks at him puzzled. he steps forward, flashing her a chipper grin, toolbox in hand.}

<D>__{well here i am.}
<A>__{reverse angle. david's pov. he glances out the front door toward a weird van parked at the curb. it says tv repair on the side but looks like something from a medicine show. the antenna on top resembles a weather vane and the mural beneath it depicts a happy family from the 1950s, gathered around their tv set. everyone wears a smile, including the dog. the hand painted motto reads "rob's tv repair we'll fix you for good."}
