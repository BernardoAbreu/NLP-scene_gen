<L>__{interior white house situation room day}
<A>__{each member of the crisis team is either on the phone or huddled with staff. a secure fax machine spits out papers which lee slips into files. lee interrupts chandler on the phone.}
<C>__{lee}
<D>__{madame vice president. we have an options paper. chandler takes the options paper, waves off lee, and reads it as she talks.}

<D>__{yes. you've made yourself quite clear.}

<D>__{i don't like any of these. from, did you brief general northwood?}
<A>__{northwood pops out of his huddle.}
<B>__{general northwood}
<A>__{i'm inclined to try this part anticipate their landing site and get strike teams in place.}
<C>__{v.p. chandler}
<D>__{can we do that?}
<C>__{general northwood}
<D>__{we've got four hours before they make it into turkienistan airspace.}
<A>__{i've got a satellite passing overhead in twenty minutes. we can narrow down the landing site choices based on runway length and any unusual activity. with luck we'll only have to capture three or four sites.}
<C>__{v.p. chandler}
<D>__{but they start executing hostages in}
<A>__{forty five minutes. }
<C>__{general northwood}
<D>__{i hate to be pragmatic, but they'll sacrifice pawns before kings. it may take them some time to kill their way up to senior staff.}

<C>__{v.p. chandler}
<D>__{eight percent is better than zero.}
<A>__{oh shit... what is that? chandler refers to a monitor in the rear of the room. cnn, the omnipresent player on the world political stage, broadcasts video from ramstein air base.}
<C>__{general greely}
<D>__{that's trouble.}
<A>__{cnn reporter (v.o. t.v.) ... the presidential aircraft was enroute from moscow when it began its mayday hail. but in a startling turn of events, the seemingly out of control plane aborted its landing and took off again. we haven't been able to confirm its status or whether or not the first family was onboard at the time.}
