<A>__{as clifford comes through the doors which are a side entrance into the chancel of this large, gothic style church. behind him now, is the altar. before him stretches the nave of the edifice with its rows of pews, its dimly glowing stained glass windows, and way in the back, its choir loft. at regular intervals, tiny shafts of light pierce the darkness from on high. there is no sign of duncan, but clifford knows he must be in here, hiding somewhere. he slowly walks forward to the front of the chancel.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{duncan. duncan. it's over now. come on out.}
<A>__{pause. duncan doesn't come out. clifford holds very still. he hears nothing. he speaks again and his voice echoes through the large empty church.}
<C>__{clifford}
<D>__{my name's john clifford. i'm a private detective. i've been hired by alexander mandrakis to take you back. i'm not going to hurt you.}
<A>__{closeup duncan hiding beneath a pew. he hears the name "mandrakis" and it registers like a thunderbolt. he silently mouths the name "mandrakis". then he hears clifford's footsteps approaching.}
<B>__{angle on clifford}
<A>__{slowly moving up the center aisle, looking from side to side into the pews.}
<C>__{clifford}
<P>__{(gently; coaxing)}
<D>__{i'm not going to hurt you... i'm not going to hurt you... there'll be no more pain... you're safe now...}
<A>__{clifford moves closer and closer to duncan's row until finally, duncan can bear it no longer. he jumps up from beneath the pew and runs.}
<C>__{duncan}
<P>__{(hysterical)}
<D>__{no! mandrakis! no!}
<A>__{clifford chases him through the pews and up the aisles to the front of the church. he is clutching a needle in both hands, ready to strike. duncan flees through a narrow door off to the side of the church.}
