<A>__{starks is awake, watching jackie sleep wearily on his chest. he sees the toll this has taken on her, just as he senses he is about to be taken out of the jacket. he nudges her gently.}

<D>__{jackie?}
<A>__{jackie stirs her eyes to look at him.}
<D>__{starks [somewhat urgently] where do you live?}

<C>__{starks}
<D>__{when we first met, when you were 7, where was the house you lived in with your mother? do you remember your address?}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{112 orchard way. [realizing, in a whisper] you're not coming back, are you?}
<A>__{starks, faint, struggles to get out of the bed.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{you gotta stop thinking like that.}

<D>__{nowhere. [beat] i just think i'm gonna be sick.}
<A>__{starks moves towards the bathroom of the hospital room. jackie moves to help him and he motions for her to stop. starks falters in the doorway when he turns to look back at jackie like it might be for the last time.}
<D>__{jackie [in a whisper] you come back to me...}
<A>__{starks nods, then goes in and closes the door behind him. jackie stares after him alone in the total silence of the room. she listens for the slightest noise and that's when she actually hears the sound of the drawer being opened for herself. she realizes he's gone. she rushes after him, opens the door in a fit, and then, sees what she feared most: no sign of starks. jackie falls to her knees, right there, on the bathroom floor and cries out like a woman only beginning to realize how unfathomably deep her heart is...}
