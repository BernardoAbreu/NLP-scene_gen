<L>__{interior hallway continuous action}
<A>__{sheldon walks slowly down the hallway. he no longer has a bounce in his step.}
<L>__{interior sheldon's new office moment later}
<A>__{sheldon enters his plush new office, awkwardly walks over to his new desk and sits behind it for the first time.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{wow...}
<C>__{tommy }
<D>__{my cousin spinner's take quite a shine to you.}
<A>__{sheldon jumps. he's surprised to tommy from spinner dunn's restaurant. tommy's crew, roy, danny, jimmy and sammy occupy the sofa.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{ever since you came in the restaurant. he can't stop yakkin'.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{well, he's a very nice man. very sweet disposition for someone that size.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{so, i was wondering if maybe you could give him a little floor space.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{i'm sorry?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{you know, a little part on the show. you're the executive producer now. you call the shots, right?}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{uh, that's a very sweet offer, and i love spinner, but tv is a complicated medium and... i mean, that would be like me getting into the ring with a prizefighter.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{can you imagine such a thing? boom. k.o.! what's the alphabet, mommy?}
<A>__{sheldon laughs again. tommy gets quiet.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{this makes me sad. very, very, sad.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{what's wrong, tommy?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{nothing. i'm just very sad right now.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{who made you sad, tommy?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{i don't want to mention names.}
<A>__{the guys look menacingly at sheldon. they rise and walk around his desk until they're on either side of him.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{you know what? maybe i can find spinner a little something to do on the show. that's probably the best solution.}
<A>__{tommy now smiles and walks over to sheldon. she musses sheldon's hair.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{you're a good boy, mopes. don't think we don't remember favors.}
