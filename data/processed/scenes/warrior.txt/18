<A>__{aluminum bleachers are set up around a ring, where two amateur fighters go at it under a bank of sodium lights. hundreds of rowdy locals swill beer and boo lustily when the action slows.}

<A>__{lo and behold, there's a shirtless brendan standing in the corner of the ring wearing a pair of shorts. on his right shoulder, an elaborate tattoo of the conlon family crest.}

<D>__{fighters to the center! i want you to obey my commands at all times. if you have no questions, touch gloves, back up, and wait for my signal. come out fighting!}
<A>__{brendan reaches out to touch gloves with mike moore, but his opponent snubs him and storms back to his corner. he means business. brendan, looking less sure of himself, retreats to his corner.}
<C>__{referee }
<D>__{fighters, are you ready? let's go!}
<A>__{the bikers raise hell as the bell sounds. moore comes out bombing. brendan dodges a couple of wild haymakers, then gets caught in the side of the head with a right hand. he stumbles back into the ropes and moore presses into him, swatting at him with his huge hands. brendan absorbs the blows, ducks down, grabs moore by the legs, lifts him, and dumps him on the mat with a resounding thud. obviously bull strong and with tremendous punching skills, brendan sits on his opponent's chest and starts raining down shots, banging and banging, pulverizing his face and body. it's a full on ass whooping going on in there until finally, mercifully, the referee stops the butchery amidst a mixture of cheers from the crowd and boos from the bikers. a winded brendan walks to his corner, touches the side of his head, wipes a small amount of blood on his shorts, and climbs out of the ring, where a promoter approaches.}
