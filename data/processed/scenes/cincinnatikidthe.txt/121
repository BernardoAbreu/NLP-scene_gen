<A>__{the second dawn of the contest is near at hand. the room, continuously lived in for so long by so many people, is a shambles of dirty glasses and plates, empty bottles, full wastebaskets and ash trays, and frayed people. at the poker table, lady fingers is dealing a new hand.}
<C>__{lady fingers}
<D>__{a jack and a ten. jack bets.}
<A>__{camera moves in close enough for us to see the cards. lancey has the jack of hearts, the kid the ten of clubs.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{jack is willing to wager two hundred dollars.}
<A>__{the kid takes his first look at his hole card. close shot showing face of hole card it is the queen of hearts.}
<C>__{the kid}
<D>__{and up five hundred.}
<A>__{lancey looks at him a long moment. his face pale and shaken. the kid is beating him. pushing buying always pressing and lancey knows he is losing one hand at a time, not badly but consistently and inevitably. his age and fatigue are a strong handicap for the long pull. then his face settles as if he had come to a decision. he smiles lightly summoning some last reserve of strength, almost as if he knows this will be the last hand, win or lose.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{call your five hundred and five hundred more.}
<C>__{the kid}
<P>__{(after a brief hesitation)}
<D>__{call.}

<C>__{hoban}
<D>__{fifty to one hundred says lancey paired his jacks.}
<C>__{yeller}

<A>__{lady fingers deals the ten of diamonds to the kid, giving him a pair, and the ten of hearts to lancey.}
<C>__{lady fingers}
<D>__{pair of tens. jack, ten of hearts.}
<C>__{the kid}
<D>__{five hundred.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{your five hundred and up one thousand.}
<A>__{the raise is a surprise. the kid's eyes go up to study lancey's face, even though he knows what a futile effort that is.}
<B>__{hoban and yeller}
<C>__{hoban}
<D>__{fifty to seventy five he's got the jacks wired.}
<C>__{yeller}
<D>__{mark it could be a high heart. queen's the best, but that old man can be cocky with an ace or a deuce. 'specially having one of the kid's tens.}

<B>__{series of angles}
<A>__{the kid, lancey, shooter, melba, schlaegel, yeller, hoban and others as they realize this could be the big hand.}
<C>__{hoban}
<D>__{he'll run. he's beat on the board anyway you look at it. even if he has the jacks it is better than eight to one against improving.}
<C>__{yeller}
<D>__{he won't run and i don't think he's got the jacks. i think he's going for the flush.}
<C>__{the kid}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{two thousand, five hundred dollars.}
<A>__{lancey looks at him, then at the cards. the moment stretches.}
<C>__{lady fingers}
<P>__{(finally)}
<D>__{two thousand, five hundred dollars to the three hearts.}
<A>__{lancey looks at her. his face briefly showing his anger. the kid notices this and reacts.}
<C>__{lancey}
<P>__{(finally, casually)}

<B>__{the shooter and bill}

<B>__{hoban and yeller}
<A>__{they each take a quick turn with the binoculars.}

<D>__{but not with both.}
<B>__{from behind the kid}
<A>__{he looks at his hole card. it is still the queen of hearts. he has a full house, which has to be the winning hand unless lancey had the audacity to bet out with a jack seven of hearts, and to raise the kid with a jack ten seven.}
<C>__{the kid}
<D>__{bet what's in front of me. make it fifty four hundred bucks.}
<A>__{he counts out all his money except a few smaller bills.}

<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{fifty four hundred bucks is a nice piece of money.}
<P>__{(counting it out)}
<D>__{i see the bet and raise sixty seven hundred.}
<A>__{slowly and deliberately, revealing nothing in his face, he reaches into his breast pocket and takes out a slim wallet and begins to let the bills flutter out on the table. the kid looks at him frozen.}
<B>__{the shooter and bill}
<A>__{bill hisses softly into the shooter's ear.}
<C>__{bill}
<D>__{kid has him, doesn't he?}
<A>__{but the shooter, like the kid, is white faced and frozen by the raise.}
<B>__{the remaining spectators}
<A>__{they crowd in close to the table: hoban, yeller, bill, the shooter, and melba.}

<D>__{straight flush to the jack that's $6700 you owe me, kid.}
<A>__{close shot the kid there is nothing to be gained from a poker face now, and he reacts with a stunned expression in which all the accumulated strain and fatigue is beginning to show. camera moves among the spectators: hoban and yeller, who are sorry for the kid and admiring of lancey; bill, who is all the more angry at his defeat because his hopes were up; the shooter, who is a very unhappy man; and melba, whose anger at the kid is balanced by her fear of schlaegel and what will happen to the shooter and possibly to her.}

<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{you're one hell of a poker player, kid. that was a rough hand.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{thanks.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{what's the tab for the whole show?}
<A>__{as he settles up, the camera follows the kid to his brandy bottle. as he pours himself a slug, melba and shooter join him.}

<C>__{melba}
<D>__{you had to do it, didn't you you had to go for it your own way.}

<D>__{well, kid, it's like i said you just wasn't ready.}
<C>__{bill}
<P>__{(to the shooter)}
<D>__{are you ready, shooter man? we're having a meeting and i suggest you join us.}
<A>__{shooter looks at him a moment and nods, and taking melba by the arm, moves toward the door followed by felix.}
<C>__{melba}
<D>__{why me i'm not part of this.}
<C>__{shooter}
<P>__{(jerking her forward)}
<D>__{oh, yes you are you and your big mouth you're part of it all right.}
<C>__{schlaegel}
<D>__{he's right, my dear. now run along with felix. we're going to have a long talk about that big mouth of yours.}
<A>__{melba starts to protest, but felix jerks her out the door. shooter hesitates, then follows.}
<B>__{different angle}
<A>__{schlaegel turns to the kid.}
<C>__{schlaegel}
<D>__{i was wrong. i figured you for brains. but you're a loser, kid. you had a chance to play with grownups and you ran.}
<P>__{(then, as lancey and lady fingers approach)}
<D>__{they weren't playing your game. they were playing mine. think about that while you find a place to hide. but hide good, kid because i got a message for you and i'm going to see it delivered.}
<A>__{the kid looks at him, looks at lancey and lady fingers, wondering about what schlaegel has said, angry about it.}
<C>__{the kid}
<D>__{any time.}
<A>__{schlaegel nods, moves to the door.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{lancey and lady fingers join the kid.}

<D>__{never thought i'd see the day. you raising tens on a lousy three flush.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{gets down to what it's all about, doesn't it? making the wrong play at the right time.}
<C>__{the kid}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{that's what it's all about?}
<P>__{(then, as lancey looks}
<D>__{at him and doesn't}
<P>__{answer)}
<D>__{you were crazy odds are three hundred to one against.}
<C>__{lancey}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{i don't play a percentage game. i play stud poker my way. and i got the money and you got the questions. figure that out.}
<P>__{(then, not unkindly)}
<D>__{you're good. but as long as i'm around, you're second best, kid... and you might as well learn to live with it.}
<A>__{the kid looks at him and doesn't answer.}
<C>__{lancey}
<D>__{look me up if you're in miami after christmas. stillson hotel.}
<A>__{he smiles his very pleasant smile and goes out the door.}
