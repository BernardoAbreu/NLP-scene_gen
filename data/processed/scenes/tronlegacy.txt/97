<L>__{interior fighter hide out upper ledge}
<A>__{flynn and mega help corrupted fighters toward the bridge.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{quick. this way.}
<A>__{wham! a wounded fighter is struck down. triangular death disk swings wide, takes out another, then the last... mega and flynn spin to see: plexor steps forward, retrieving his death disk. blocking their exit.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{mega, move aside! i will finish him!}
<A>__{instead, she shields flynn's body.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{strike us down. there will always be more to oppose you.}
<A>__{sinclair's circuits snap with rage.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{what programming has he installed in you??}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{flynn! go with the others! run!}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{i'm not leaving you with this phreak.}
<A>__{plexor brings back his death disk. in the shadows: rush, creeping along the periphery, gaining position on plexor.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{plexor, get over the control thing.}
<A>__{plexor readies his disk to fire }
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{drop the disk!}
<A>__{he pivots, hurls death disk at rush. rush dives clear, sends his data energy into surrounding circuits. circuits activate around plexor, surging pain data into his body.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{i will be damned.}
<C>__{mega}
<D>__{rush?!}
<A>__{but plexor resists rush's data infusion, freezing the circuits around his feet. cutting off the flow. death disk slices walls, arcing back toward plexor rush leaps at plexor. blang! plexor is solid state, like a cast iron statue. rush flips airborne, goes down hard.}
<C>__{rush}
<D>__{arrgh!}
<A>__{plexor considers rush, astonished by his audacity.}
<C>__{rush}
<P>__{(sucks air)}
<D>__{is that all you've got?}
<A>__{it's a millisecond's distraction death disk returns to plexor's hand, but swings wide and grazes his arm, leaving a swath of painful corruption.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{raagghh!}
<A>__{x takks hustle in with hefty negabyte blasters.}
<C>__{flynn}
<D>__{rush! this way!}
<A>__{flynn, mega and flynn dash across the bridge.}
<C>__{plexor}
<D>__{delete them!}
<A>__{negabyte beams slice walls, erasing all data in their path. rush, flynn and mega dive into a tunnel, escaping by inches.}
