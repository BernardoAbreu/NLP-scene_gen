<A>__{celts, arrayed behind their chieftain. an awesome sight. clad in hides and skins, painted arms and faces, head pieces the faces of wild animals. standing in eerie silence. a loud clap of thunder. nottingham rides up to the chieftain.}

<D>__{i want prisoners.}
<A>__{the chieftain does not turn his head.}
<C>__{chieftain}
<D>__{we came to fight.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{nevertheless, i need prisoners.}
<A>__{with only a short flick of his head, the chieftain spits. nottingham waves his arm, signalling his own foot sol diers to advance. the chieftain raises his sword. instantly a tumultuous chilling roar from his warriors. they charge forward.}
