<D>__{hey, what's going on here?}
<A>__{half a dozen firearms turn and point in his direction. the employee disappears back inside his office. the head goon cautiously approaches the van, reaches for the driver's door, and yanks it open... inside: there is no driver. just a video camera mounted at eye level. the head goon cranes back his head, befuddled, when he notices for the first time (and maybe we do, too) an enormous antenna sprouting from the van's rear bumper. the van suddenly lurches. short distance away close on remote control complete with a tiny video monitor (displaying the van driver's pov) and a steering mechanism it's a near replica of the one virgil malloy used in the monster truck drag race against his brother. and virgil's using it now, too, as he sits next to reuben tishkoff in one of reuben's rolls and watches the goons scramble back from the flat tired van.}

<A>__{as the head goon reaches for the rear door, his hand inches away when... ... barroooom! the door explodes open! knocked on his ass, the head goon watches as the canvas "x" bags within burn to cinders. he does, however, happen to notice one burning shred of paper dislodged from a bag: it's a promotional flier for a call girl service.}
