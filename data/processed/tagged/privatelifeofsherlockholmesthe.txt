<D>__{somewhere in the vaults of a bank in london is a tin dispatch box with my name on it. it is not to be opened until fifty years after my death.}
<A>__{the guards find a battered tin dispatch box with the name john h. watson, m.d., painted on it. they remove it from the shelf, set it down on a table. the box is tied with heavy cord, the knots sealed with wax. strung on the cord is the key.}
<C>__{watson's voice}
<D>__{it contains certain mementos of my long association with a man who elevated the science of deduction to an art the world's first, and undoubtedly most famous, consulting detective.}
<A>__{while one of the guards dusts the box off, the other cuts the cord with a pair of scissors. he then inserts the key in the lock, turns it, raises the lid revealing the dusty contents of the box. over this, superimpose the main title. the guards now start to remove the objects from the box, one at a time: a daguerreotype of holmes, standing, and watson, seated, in a a stiff studio pose; holmes' deerstalker hat, his curved pipe, his magnifying glass; watson's stethoscope, holmes' revolver; a small enamel sign with the number 221b; a pair of handcuffs; a sheet of music paper which is unrolled to disclose a violin piece composed by holmes, titled for ilse von h.; a pocket watch, the back of which is opened to reveal a photograph of gabrielle valladon; a signet ring bearing the initials s.h. under which is concealed a compass; a worn morocco case inside which is an early model hypodermic syringe; a crystal ball which, when shaken, produces a snowstorm and when the snow settles, we see a bust of queen victoria. over these objects, the rest of the credit titles are}

<A>__{the last item out of the box is a thick stack of manuscript paper, bound with green ribbon. the guard undoes the ribbon, dusts off the top page, as camera moves in closer. written in ink, in the cursive penmanship of the period, is the following paragraph:}
<D>__{to my heirs: in my lifetime, i have recorded some sixty cases demonstrating the singular gift of my friend sherlock holmes dealing with everything from the hound of the baskervilles to his mysterious brother mycroft and the devilish professor moriarty. but there were other adventures which, for reasons of discretion, i have decided to withhold from the public until this much later date. they involve matters of a delicate and sometimes scandalous nature, as will shortly become apparent.}

<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{so?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{you know what they say about us. if there's one thing more deplorable than our cooking, it's our love making. we are not exactly the most romantic of people }
<C>__{rogozhin}

<D>__{madame says you talk too much. you find her attractive or no?}
<A>__{before holmes can answer, the door opens and watson sticks his head in. he is flushed and slightly inebriated, and there is a flower tucked behind his ear. from off comes the sound of wild balalaika music.}

<D>__{excuse me.}
<P>__{(to rogozhin)}
<D>__{what does prokanzik mean?}
<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{it means 'you little devil.'}

<C>__{rogozhin}
<D>__{then no problem.}

<D>__{maybe a slight one. you see, i am not a free man.}

<P>__{(holmes nods)}
<D>__{he is your glass of tea?}

<D>__{emile? never. he loves me and i love him.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{so i gathered.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{i went to the police they said they would send out a missing persons report but they didn't sound too encouraging. then i went to the belgian embassy and explained the situation to them and they suggested that i consult you...}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{you could have done worse.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{i was on my way here and suddenly there were footsteps behind me and a hand over my mouth and the smell of choloroform and the next thing i knew i was in the water and then a man was wrapping me in a blanket }

<D>__{nothing.}

<D>__{you're sending an empty sheet of paper to an empty shop?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{that empty shop is obviously being used as an accomodation address, or letter drop. but what gets dropped must be picked up. the question is how? and by whom? and why?}

<A>__{it is dusty, cobwebby, quite forbidding. in the rear wall is a closed sliding door, indented about a foot into the shop. nearby stands a large, square object, covered with a tarpaulin. high up in the rear wall is a slanted skylight, fitted with an iron grill. from outside, holmes, in deerstalker and inverness, can be seen sawing through the iron bars. watson and gabrielle are beside him.}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{hammer... chisel.}
<A>__{watson hands him the indicated tools. holmes chips away the cement from the top and bottom of the last bar, then using it as a hinge, swings the grill open. he lets himself through the skylight, drops to the floor. watson now helps gabrielle through the skylight, lowers her toward holmes, who puts his arms around her waist, eases her to the floor. for a brief moment he keeps his arms around her. watson has now squeezed through the skylight.}
<C>__{watson}
<D>__{here!}
<A>__{he hands the tools to holmes, jumps to the floor. gabrielle is looking around the shop.}
<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{it's so strange to think i've been writing to a place like this all these months.}
<A>__{watson crosses to the square tarpaulin covered object. he lifts up one corner of the tarp and is greeted by a loud twittering of birds. what he has uncovered is a large cage and about a hundred canaries, suddenly disturbed, are flapping around unside.}

<D>__{look at all these canaries. do you suppose this could have been a pet shop?}
<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{maybe.}
<P>__{(pointing off)}
<D>__{here comes our letter.}
<A>__{through the front window, the silhouette of a postman can be seen approaching. he drops a letter through the slot in the front door, moves on. the letter lands on a section of floor which is solidly covered with dust except for a series of double tracks, running to the door and curving back.}

<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{i would surmise somebody is using ice skates if it weren't for a conspicuous absence of ice.}
<A>__{they become aware of a squeaking noise outside the rear of the shop, growing louder as it gets nearer. the noise stops, there is the sound of a lock turning, then the rattle of a chain.}

<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(unfazed)}
<D>__{this way.}
<A>__{he leads gabrielle and watson toward the rear wall, right next to the door. they flatten themselves with their backs to the wall, just as the door slides open concealing them from view. revealed is the mews behind the shop. in the door is an old biddy with straggly hair, sitting in a wheelchair. in her lap are a bulky paper bag and a tin pitcher filled with water. as she wheels herself inside, the unoiled wheelchair squeaks loudly. she stops in front of the cage, pulls on a rope which runs through a pulley in the ceiling and the tarpaulin rises into the air, exposing the canaries.}

<D>__{good morning, my pretties. here's mum with your breakfast. did you think i'd forgotten you?}

<A>__{she cackles to herself, glances toward the front door.}
<C>__{woman in wheelchair}
<D>__{oh. you never told me we had a letter.}
<A>__{she starts to wheel herself toward the front of the shop. through a crack in the door behind which our three are hiding, we see holmes' eye watching her. the old woman reaches the letter, picks it up, studies the address. then she hears something, glances toward the open rear door. a horse drawn wagon with a canvas top is just pulling into the mews. two carters jump down from the driver's seat, and one of them takes a small bird cage from the back of the wagon. as they start in through the door, the old woman drops the letter into her lap, wheels herself toward them.}

<D>__{how many do you want this time?}
<C>__{first carter}
<D>__{two dozen.}
<A>__{he opens the door of the small cage, the bottom of which is covered with newspaper, starts transferring canaries into it from the large cage.}
<C>__{woman in wheelchair}
<D>__{what are they doing with all those canaries? what's going on up there?}
<C>__{second carter}
<D>__{look, duchess, we don't know and we don't want to know.}
<C>__{first carter}
<D>__{when you work for jonah, it's better not to ask questions.}
<A>__{through the crack in the door behind which he is hidden, we see holmes' eye studying the small bird cage, as the canaries are being transferred into it. we move in close on the small cage, and see the soiled newspaper spread on the bottom. the masthead reads:}
<B>__{inverness courier.}
<C>__{first carter}
<P>__{(counting as he transfers canaries)}
<D>__{... twenty two, twenty three, twenty four.}
<A>__{he closes the doors of the cages, picks up the small cage. his companion indicates the letter in the woman's lap.}

<D>__{how about that letter? does that go, too?}
<C>__{woman in wheelchair}
<D>__{no. that's going to be picked up in person.}
<A>__{she chuckles. the carriers exit into the mews, stash the cage in the back of the wagon, mount the driver's seat.}
<C>__{woman in wheelchair}
<P>__{(to birds)}
<D>__{all right, my pretties. back to sleep you go. see you tomorrow.}
<A>__{she pulls the rope and the tarpaulin drops back over the cage. then she deposits the letter on top of the covered cage, wheels herself out the rear door. as she slides it shut from outside, our trio is revealed in their hiding places behind the door. there is the sound of the chain rattling, the lock snapping, and the squeaky wheels moving off.}

<P>__{(a sigh of relief)}
<D>__{i really thought we were done for.}
<C>__{holmes}
<P>__{(casually)}
<D>__{the art of concealment, my dear watson, is merely a matter of being in the right place at the right time.}

<C>__{gabrielle}
<D>__{did you hear what she said? you really think emile is going to pick up the letter himself?}

<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{maildrops and canaries and wheelchairs... and what was all that about jonah? and what do you suppose they're doing up there? and where is up there?}

<C>__{holmes}
<D>__{nevertheless }
<A>__{with the saw end of his cane, he slits the envelope open, removes the enclosure, unfolds it. we see the letter in his hand as he reads it out loud. the letterhead says: diogenes club, st. james's, london.}

<P>__{(reading)}
<D>__{my dear sherlock: i expect you and dr. watson to join me at the club immediately upon reciept of this note. according to my calculations, that should be at 11:40 a.m. your brother, mycroft.}
