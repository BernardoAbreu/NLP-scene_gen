<A>__{as he speaks, frank steps out of the torture room, knife in hand. roaring, he comes at them both. kirsty flings herself out of the path of the knife. frank swipes at steve, who falls backwards down the stairs. he cries out, head hitting the stairs as he descends. the box falls from his unconscious hand. frank turns on kirsty, who avoids one slice of the knife, and another, but is driven back into the torture room.}
