<D>__{well there are several ways to reduce landing speed. you see, the velocity }
<A>__{klaatu interrupts himself as he realizes that he may be going too far. the two men have moved closer, listening and grinning. one of them whispers to the other behind the back of his hand. then the man realizes that klaatu has stopped speaking and is looking at him.}
<C>__{man}
<P>__{(grinning)}
<D>__{keep goin', mister. he was fallin' for it.}
