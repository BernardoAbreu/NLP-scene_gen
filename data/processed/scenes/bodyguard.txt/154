<L>__{exterior lake day}
<A>__{herb and frank are about to return to the house. they stop short. there, at their feet, is a line of human foot prints, from heavy snow boots, leading away into the trees. frank looks at herb, suddenly alert.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{where's fletcher?}
<A>__{henry appears at the porch of the house, carrying a fishing rod as he comes out. at that instant, the sound of the outboard motor crackles through the air. frank's head snaps toward the boathouse. henry, in the distance, looks quickly at the boathouse, then to frank.}
<C>__{henry}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{frank! i haven't...}
<A>__{but frank is already moving, leaping from the porch and starting to run flat out toward the boathouse and dock. rachel turns to look. the skiff appears out of the boathouse, fletcher at the motor, the boat's lone occupant. the boat moves slowly away from the boathouse, parallel to the dock. frank is running toward the water with everything he's got, his face contorted. the sound of the outboard drowns out his voice as he yells.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{fletcher! fletcher!}
<B>__{in boat}
<A>__{fletcher, intent on his piloting, neither hears nor sees frank running down the lawn behind him. the boat is approaching the end of the dock.}
<B>__{dock}
<A>__{frank finally makes it to the dock and continues to sprint after the boat. his weight rattles the boards as he runs.}
<B>__{in boat}
<A>__{fletcher passes the end of the dock and gives the throttle a little twist.}
<B>__{dock}
<A>__{frank reaches the end of the dock at a full run and dives directly at the rear of the moving boat. frank's body flies out over the boat. he knocks fletcher out of his seat and into the water on the other side of the skiff.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(screams)}
<D>__{no! he can't swim!}
<B>__{in water}
<A>__{frank holds the terrified, shaking fletcher in his arms. fletcher begins to cry. frank paddles with him toward the dock. the empty boat swerves, then continues out toward the center of the lake.}
<B>__{dock}
<A>__{henry and rachel are already at the end of the dock. nicki and herb are running toward it. rachel is livid, hysterical. henry peers out at the boat, which continues to bounce innocently across the water, defining a broad curve.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{fletcher, baby. are you all right? baby.}
<A>__{fletcher, spluttering, is handed up to rachel by frank. rachel hugs fletcher to her. herb bends down to check he's breathing properly, wrapping the boy in his jacket.}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{he's all right.}
<A>__{henry helps frank up out of the water. frank sits on the end of the dock, breathing hard.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{what are you doing? you out of your mind? you're crazy!}
<P>__{(to fletcher)}
<D>__{you're all right, baby.}
<P>__{(back to frank)}
<D>__{you could have drowned him!}
<A>__{frank and henry look out toward the boat which has come to a stop out in the middle of the lake.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i got careless.}
<A>__{henry looks at frank. he feels terrible about not checking the boat.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{frank, i'm sorry. i should have...}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{it's okay, henry.}
<A>__{herb puts his hand on fletcher's head.}
<C>__{herb}
<D>__{you all right now, son?}
<A>__{fletcher nods, his crying ends raggedly. frank begins to stand up.}
<C>__{henry}
<D>__{how do we get the boat back?}
<A>__{out in the center of the lake, the boat blows up. every one on the dock jumps. nicki screams. frank sits down again. he shakes his head. on an impulse, he stretches out his hand, palm downward. it's trembling slightly.}
