<A>__{buster runs down the sidewalk as fast as his stumpy little legs will carry him, in pursuit of the bus.}
<L>__{interior car moving late afternoon}
<A>__{the team of surgeons has been tracking o.d. stu across the city! through the windshield they see the bus pulling up outside the zoo. o.d. stu hops out and sprints across the parking lot.}

<D>__{it's him! he's getting off!}
<L>__{interior zoo entrance late afternoon}
<A>__{o.d. stu doesn't even stop at the ticket window. he vaults over the turnstile, knocking benefit guests aside. the surgeons aren't far behind. they race up to the ticket window }

<D>__{did you see a corpse running this way?}
<A>__{the ticket taker shrugs and points off in o.d. stu's direction.}
<L>__{interior banquet tent that moment late afternoon}
<A>__{the last stages of dinner. waiters are already clearing plates, and although julie has barely touched her food she sends her plate away. onstage a band is playing tasteful zoo jazz. when the number ends, stu bone approaches the dais and leans into the mike.}
<D>__{stu bone as emcee i want to thank you all for joining us at this swingin' bash...it's a special night for the birds, and the lions, and the monkeys, but it's also a special night for }
<P>__{(tapping his chest)}
<D>__{ this monkey. and it's special because of a very special lady. her name is }
<P>__{(checking a note in his pocket)}
<D>__{julie mcelroy. just kiddin', julie. stand up.}
<A>__{julie stands reluctantly. the crowd applauds.}
<D>__{stu bone and to make this special night extra special, i'd like to do a special number...especially for you.}
<A>__{a disco ball lowers. stu bone turns to welcome a group of backup soul singers who are just joining the band on stage. the tent begins to rock with a throbbing beat. and stu bone launches into a wild eyed, hip shaking parody of mick jagger singing the rolling stones' "monkey man"! as he sings, stu bone gyrates over toward julie, bumping and grinding like the cartoon monkey sex machine he is. he waves his mike to the crowd, urging everyone to join in. julie gasps in disbelief, but the crowd is eating it up clapping and singing along with stu bone. he gestures for pretty women to join him out on the floor. he opens his shirt at the neck, exposing a hitherto unseen plenitude of chest hair. he pulls out a hanky to mop his brow and tosses it to the crowd. he wipes his armpits with a second hanky and tosses it to the crowd. he blows his nose into a third and tosses it to the crowd. then he jumps up on the tables and shakes his booty wildly, strutting in and out among the dessert plates. if the real jagger could see him, he would creep home a sad and broken man. for the big finale, he jumps off the table and slides across the floor to julie's table arriving on his knees.}
<D>__{stu bone i am just a monkey man! i'm glad you are a monkey...woman...too.}
<P>__{(soft voice)}
<D>__{how about it, julie?}
<A>__{he pulls out a ring box and hands it to the beet red julie. the crowd lets out a collective gasp followed by wild applause. she stares down at the ring a big vulgar sparkler. she can't speak.}
<D>__{stu bone we'll hop a plane tonight. an island ceremony. an abba dabba honeymoon!}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{it looks so...new. stu bone it is new. why wouldn't it be new?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{but the heirloom ring. your grandmother's ring... stu bone heirloom? huh? you want a used ring ?}
<A>__{no reply. she's taking a long time to say yes. the audience is muttering.}
<D>__{stu bone ju leeee... operators are standing by... offer expires at midnight, december 31...}
<A>__{suddenly a gore stained figure bursts into the tent.}
<C>__{o.d. stu}
<D>__{doc! doc! don't do it! he isn't stu! he's monkeybone!!!}
<A>__{julie's jaw drops. she barely gets a glimpse of o.d. stu before the zoo guards arrive to haul him away.}
<D>__{stu bone boy, the nuts are out tonight. what'd that creep call you ?}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{he called me "doc."}
<A>__{ which stu bone never does. someone in the crowd yells...}
<C>__{guest}
<D>__{hey monkeybone!!}
<A>__{stu bone turns and does a simian comedy shtick for the crowd.}
<D>__{stu bone that's me, folks! monkeybone! let's party!}
<A>__{by the time he's done scratching his ribs, julie has vanished!}
