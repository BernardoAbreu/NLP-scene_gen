<C>__{voice}
<D>__{ready?}
<C>__{second voice }
<D>__{yeah. boot it.}
<A>__{a burst of bright white static exploding across the darkness. a high whine on the audio track gives way to street sounds and rapid breathing. an image wavers and stabilizes: a nervous pov. we're in a car, sitting in the backseat, and we're nervous, the view swinging around, showing the street rolling by outside the windows, then whipping back to the two guys in the front seat. our pov looks down at a small recording device in "our" hands. a red led is flashing. we slip the recorder into a coat pocket.}
<C>__{our voice}
<D>__{okay. it's goin'. i'm recording.}
<A>__{the guy riding shotgun, lane, is just pulling a pantyhose over his head, smearing his features into a pig like mask. he turns, directly to the lens, pissed off.}
<C>__{lane}
<D>__{good one, dickhead. thanks for waitin' till i get this fuckin thing on. you tryin' ta i.d. me, or what?}
<A>__{he tosses another pantyhose right at us and we catch it. our pov looks down, into the pantyhose, which comes up over our field of view. we realize: this is not some ride along verite video. we are one of these guys. real honest to god point of view, with no cuts, no music. this is not film, it is human experience. the driver is a hispanic guy named "spaz" diaz. lane is a white guy who looks very strung out. couple of crackheads. the car is a mid seventies barge, piebald with primer.}
<C>__{lane}
<D>__{next alley... just pull in slow.}
<P>__{(turning to us)}
<D>__{hurry up will ya. here.}
<A>__{he hands us a big stainless steel revolver. the pov looks down as our shaky hands snap open the cylinder, check the rounds, snap it closed. diaz pulls the barge into an alley. the headlights illuminate overflowing dumpsters. a chicano busboy is making trash runs out the back door of a restaurant, which he has chocked open. the busboy goes back inside.}
<C>__{lane}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{out of the car, quickly, our own breathing loud in our ears. we even hear our own heartbeat, racing now. through the door, after lane, moving fast. into the kitchen. fluorescent glare. the busboy turning, surprised, lane putting the shotgun in his face. freezing him. lane puts a finger to his lips: "quiet" in any language. our hand puts the magnum in the thai cook's face. we get them down on the greasy floor, lane controlling them with the shotgun. he looks at us, snaps his eyes toward the front room. we hear voices as we approach the swing door. go through. whip pan left, then right. scoping the layout. low rent thai place. red wallpaper. closing time. middle aged thai owner, by the cash register, counting money. young thai waitress, cleaning up. they look up, stunned, as we put the gun on them.}
<C>__{our voice}
<P>__{(shouting, edgy)}
<D>__{don't move, don't talk, don't do nothing.}
<A>__{our pov is whipping around, from the front door to the owner to the kitchen where lane is standing in the doorway covering the cook and busboy, back to the owner as he steps back from the cash register. we scoop up the big wad of bills: seven, eight hundred bucks in tens and fives. now yelling, herding the owner and the waitress into the kitchen, the owner trying to calm the girl in singsongy thai, lane shouting at him to shut up. into the walk in cooler. the steel door closes on four scared pair of eyes. pov looking around, seeing... a dish rack. our hand pulls out a spoon, drops the spoon handle through the hole in the cooler door latch. locking them in. lane heading out the back door. laughing, as he looks at the wad of cash our hand is waving in front of him. we follow lane to the car. snap a look down the alley one way, then the other. shit! cop black and white pulling into the far end of the alley. heartbeat goes triple time. scrambling into the car. door not even closed and spaz has it in reverse, burning rubber as he launches back down the alley. scrunch! the car grinds along one wall as spaz steers wildly backward. sparks right next to us. then kboom! as we slam into a dumpster and push it right out into the street. the cop has his lights and siren on, and is roaring at us as spaz cranks the wheel and punches it down the street. he curses in english and spanish as he weaves between cars. we pull off the stocking to see better. the cop car surges onto the street behind us. looking ahead. a red light. cars stopped, blocking the way. cutting to the right, onto the sidewalk, around the cars, into the intersection. a near miss with cross traffic, then accelerating. another red light ahead.}
<C>__{lane}
<D>__{don't stop!}
<A>__{truck entering the intersection. everyone yelling. spaz cuts the wheel but too late... clipping the truck and spinning. the street outside smearing past like the view from a tilt a whirl. then kblam! hitting something, god knows what, and launching up and over, and krunch! crushing metal and an explosion of broken glass. it gets quiet and still. tinkling glass as lane moves. then spaz is screaming. the car is upside down. crawling out of the side window. a frenzy now. whip pan to see the cops pulling up. then whipping back to the wreck. the engine is burning. flames spreading rapidly. spaz inside, pinned, upside down, blood pumping across his face. our hands pulling lane out. he comes up running. we run after him, sprinting toward the welcoming darkness of an alley. panting breath and heartbeats and sirens and somebody yelling. gunshots. looking back. cops next to their car, firing. ahead, lane running into shadow. then a door opening, a man coming out of a metal firedoor. lane grabbing him, throwing him out of the way, holding the door open as we dive through into a stairwell. lane sprinting up, two steps at a time. trying the door at the second floor landing. locked. shit. running up. dizzying whirl as we run, up and up. the pov is finally broken by a...}

<L>__{interior underground garage}
<A>__{but we don't know where we are yet. we see a man in extreme close up: just his eyes and mouth. the eyes are closed, the eyeballs tracking under the lids, like he is watching a movie in there. this is lenny.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{this is great... the doors are all locked. who are these losers, friends of yours?}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{back to pov as we reach the fifth floor landing. lane is coming unglued as he finds this door locked. we look down, see cops coming two floors below. one cranks off a couple rounds at us and we snap back from the railing. pounding up the last flight. finally! the door is unlocked. blasting through it, behind lane, onto the roof. running all out past ac units and pipes, air vents. looking up: an lapd helicopter orbiting close. it flicks the xenon onto us and we are running in a vibrating circle of blue daylight. running along the edge of the roof. looking down. car burning upside down in the street below. the gas tank explodes, filling the street with orange light. we don't slow. we're running all out.}
<C>__{lenny }
<D>__{wow... the gas tank is a nice touch. oh, oh, end of the line boys.}
<A>__{ahead, in pov we see the edge of the roof coming up. beyond it is another building, about ten feet lower and separated by a 20 foot alley. but lane doesn't slow down. he leaps across the void and makes it to the other building, landing in a sprawl. we reach the edge and look down. six stories. no ladders or fire escapes. whip to behind us. cops running across the roof.}
<C>__{lane}
<D>__{come on! fucking jump man!}
<A>__{the pov backs up from the edge and then runs toward it... out into the void. moving... airborne... then... wham! right into the parapet wall. slipping down. brick wall right in our face. bloody fingers grabbing for a rusty piece of pipe running along the edge. looking down... feet dangling over a sixty foot drop. a cat walking through a patch of light in the alley below, oblivious. breathing raspy. snapping a look up as the pipe gives way. a keening whine coming from us as we scramble to climb up but... snapping a look down walls rushing past, sound of wind, and our own raspy scream ground rushing up split second impression of a cat, looking up, yowling and running out of the way as pavement fills frame. a burst of violent red light. sound like a gunshot... but no echo. only silence. and blackness.}

<A>__{lit by miles of fluorescent. empty and echoing. close on lenny. he has something on his head. something that looks like a mutated set of walkman headphones, except they have little gecko fingers that fit along the temples and over the forehead. playback "trodes". lenny whips off the trodes, gasping as if he got gutpunched.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{goddamnit! you know i don't deal in snuff. how many times i hafta tell you?!}
<A>__{lenny is with a guy everybody knows as "tick", a pale skinned creature of the night in t shirt and leather jacket. tick is a bottomfeeder in the techno underground of the near future.}

<C>__{tick}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{lenny nero is low thirties. handsome. charming. and you better check to see if you still have your ring after you shake with him. he is wearing an expensive italian jacket, and what he thinks of as a "power tie." his rolex isn't real. his greasy hair is too long and curls around his collar. he needs to shave. a little sleazy. but he has energy, and heavy street smarts. lenny is sitting on the hood of his '97 bmw 1035i. tick is facing him, sitting in the back of his beat to shit}
<L>__{70's van. there are a lot of tapes and tech stuff piled}
<A>__{inside the van. lenny has a haliburton case open next to him, like a drug dealer. in fact the whole setup looks like a drug deal, but it's not. though it is illegal. the case holds lenny's personal playback deck, his trodes, and a rack of the little tapes in which he deals. they are about the size of dat tapes, and hold about 30 minutes of sensory experience... everything a person sees, hears, and feels... recorded directly from the cerebral cortex at the moment it is happening.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{how'd you get the tape? why didn't the cops put it in evidence?}
<C>__{tick}
<D>__{with all the blood i guess they didn't see the rig. guy had it under a wig.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{yeah, but how'd it get to you?}
<C>__{tick}
<D>__{i got ways, lenny, i got ways.}
<P>__{(off lenny's impatient look)}
<D>__{okay, okay... i got a deal with some a the paramedics. my guy pages me and i pick it up at the morgue. so whaddya think? this clip's gotta be worth at least a grand. right?}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{tick. not to dash your hopes, but i don't deal this kind of product, you know that. i will give you four for it, cause i've gotta cut off the last bit. and my customers want uncut.}
<C>__{tick}
<D>__{fuck that! the last part's the best. you dry dive six stories and blammo! jack right into the big black.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{i don't deal black jack clips! it's policy. i got ethics here.}
<C>__{tick}
<D>__{yeah, when did that start? come on, man! it's what people want to see, and you know it.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{so lay it off to somebody else.}
<C>__{tick}
<D>__{come on, lenny. i got expenses. i got to get this rig fixed. look at it...}
<A>__{tick holds up a zip lock bag containing the walkman sized stainless steel cortical resonance recorder, the record deck we saw earlier in the pov. also in the bag is the squid net, a matrix of sensors designed to conform to the human head (this is different from playback trodes). the whole works are covered with congealed blood.}
<C>__{tick}
<D>__{give me six at least. this's a good clip, here. gets you pumpin'.}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{yeah, well, the first part's okay. better than the usual soaps you bring me.}

<C>__{tick}
<D>__{hey, you're always saying, 'bring me real life. bring me street life. and, like, one man's mundane and desperate existence is another man's technicolor.'}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{i said that? look, i will take it for five, and you'll make out okay, because in this case it's pure cream, you don't have to cut anything back to the wearer.}

<A>__{iris can now see herself as the wearer sees her... wide eyed with terror, white lipped, weeping. helpless. and she can feel what he feels. the wearer's hand goes back into the fanny pack and pulls out something else. a black athletic headband. we slip it over her head, down over her eyes. a blindfold. now she can only see what the wearer sees. and also from the bag we pull... a yellow plastic object. with our thumb we extend the five inch blade of the razor knife, the type with tips that can be broken off by segments when they get dull. it extends with an ominous clicking sound. we lower it toward her and cut up the middle of her t shirt, laying it open. exposing her torso. we then look down and slide the knife under the side band of her panties, slicing them off. we put the knife up to her throat, and she whimpers, afraid to cry out, and then we draw the flat side of the blade across her body as if to tease her with the prospect of her death. mace looks at lenny's expression of dawning horror and pulls the car to the curb about a half block from the sunset sheraton. lenny is hyperventilating, shifting in his seat as if ants are crawling over him. he is experiencing the stalker's exhilaration. in pov we see the wearer pull his jogging pants down below his knees (r rated please) and reach for iris. kneeling in front of her, he pushes her legs apart and pulls her hips forward onto him, pushing into her. iris is feeling and seeing what he sees and feels... she feels her own pain and humiliation swirling with the killer's exhilaration. on lenny, sweating and barely able to breath. mace stops the tape... concerned by lenny's reaction. he opens his eyes... mace see the fear there, of what the tape may reveal. but he shakes his head. he has to know. he pushes her hand away and punches play. it floods into his head again. the sweaty, grunting horror. the stalker picks up her slit t shirt and quickly wraps it around her neck. he knots it tight and twists one powerful hand into the knot. the muscles in his forearm look like cables as he turns the knot tighter. the stalker viciously twists the knot a full turn and the t shirt fabric almost disappears into the skin under her jaw. via her trodes, iris watches herself die. her death comes at the moment of his orgasm which is fed to her... blasting off the planet on total overload... terror, pain, death merging with ecstasy and exultation at the same instant. on lenny, crying out and grabbing for the trodes, but he just holds onto them, as if they are sucking his brains out of his skull.}

<A>__{back to pov, a glimpse of the wearer's hand relaxing the knot. iris' head lolls. her mouth is slack and open. we remove her blindfold. her eyes are half lidded. very dead looking. our fingers gently push them wide open. back to lenny, looking like he has been gut kicked. he gasps for breath. to pov, as the killer's hand calmly moves iris' head from side to side... studying her dead face. her staring eyes. he leans very close to her and stares into one dead eye, the pupil wide, seeing nothing. a burst of static. end of tape. lenny opens his eyes. he fumbles open the car door and practically rolls out onto the sidewalk. the trodes pull off his head as he lurches up, reeling across the sidewalk to a darkened storefront where he leans for support. he doubles over and heaves up the contents of his stomach. mace circles around the car and catches him as he sags to his knees. she holds his shoulders while he throws up again.}

<D>__{oh. i didn't hear you come in.}
<A>__{the recording stops, in a blast of static. lenny jerks at the discontinuity in the input, he is so keyed up. the recording restarts: a new image resolves out of static. faith is pushed roughly down on the bed. we climb onto the bed, straddling her, and she gasps. we turn her onto her back. she has been blindfolded. the wearer goes ssshhh. a warning. like the hiss of a snake. our hands seize her wrists and handcuff them one by one to the iron frame at the head of the bed. the hands go out of sight and then reappear holding a set of trodes. they are placed on her head... the spidery gecko hand device almost disappearing in her black hair. lenny's guts have turned to water. he is shaking his head in horror...}
<C>__{lenny}
<D>__{no, no, no...}
<A>__{in pov we see one of our hands come up holding the yellow plastic razor knife. the blade clicks out to its full length. our hands reach down and slowly slit her dress open, starting between her breasts and going down out of sight. she groans, squirming away from the cold knife. the killer's hands open the material, exposing her white body, which in his peculiar vision is pure ivory. the knife deftly cuts off her panties. we unbuckle our pants and reach for her, grasping her hips, pulling her to us. on lenny, gagging. overcome by revulsion and horror, mixing obscenely with the pleasure flooding into him from the tape. back to pov as we pull our belt out of the belt loops of our pants and wrap it around faith's neck. faith begins to pant in tiny rapid breaths. we tighten the belt slowly. lenny tears the trodes from his head. he clutches his stomach, gasping for breath. carrying the playback deck, he staggers into the bedroom... to the bed. he stares wildly around the room. one whole wall of the bedroom is mirrored. in the mirror he spots a shape, on the floor beyond the bed. it is covered in the bed sheet, but it is clearly a human form, propped up against the wall on the far side of the night stand. he missed it in his earlier look from the bedroom door. lenny moves around the bed and reaches down to the foot of the figure, grasping the edge of the sheet with a trembling hand. with horrified apprehension he pulls on the sheet. it reveals the head and upper body of... tran vo. the last thing he expected. lenny leans close and sees that tran is breathing shallowly, but his eyes are vacant. he looks like tick did. lenny sits on the bed and puts the trodes back on. the fireworks and screaming outside sound like some nightmarish war, like the sound of the world coming to an end. but all lenny cares about is what's on the tape. he hits play. the pov continues where it left off. faith's body lurches with the wearer's thrusts. his hand tightens the belt. lenny feels the climax building. faith's body shakes as the killer comes... she cries out herself, in pain... or is it? the killers hand releases the belt. we see faith gasping for breath and moaning. suddenly the pov whips sideways to the mirrored closet doors along one wall. in the mirror is a reflection of the bed and on it faith. and on her...}
<B>__{... max.}
<A>__{pants down, her legs pulled up around him. they are both gasping for breath, spent, following their shattering orgasms. he runs his hands over her sweat slick belly. lenny is stunned beyond his power to imagine. he does not have the strength or the will to stop the tape. in pov max's hands remove her blindfold. she looks right at us, still gasping with the aftershocks of her pleasure. max's hands undo the handcuffs, freeing her. she reaches for us, her eyes glittering with sated lust. we slump forward onto her, and her face fills the pov.}

<D>__{i love you.}
<A>__{lenny is reeling with these revelations. his best friend is the killer. and the woman he loved loves him. but the tape is not over... the pov continues as max's eyes whip around in response to a sound behind them. the bedroom door is opening. tran is standing there, stunned. maybe the first time he's ever been surprised in his life. what a way to start. like lightning we are off the bed snatching our .45 from the night stand and whipping around... putting the muzzle right in tran's face. we pull him roughly across the room, too stunned to resist.}

<D>__{you're going to die, you're both going to fucking die.}
<A>__{we slam him back against the mirror wall and jam the muzzle of the gun right in his mouth: a deadly gag. using the gun we push him down until he is sitting on the floor with his back to the mirror. our eyes whip to faith. she is freaking out. we see max's reflection in the mirror as he talks to her, talking fast.}
