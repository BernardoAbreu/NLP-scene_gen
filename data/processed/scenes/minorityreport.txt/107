<L>__{interior bar the sprawl night}
<A>__{ennis page sits on a bar stool at the far end of a bar so full of cigarette smoke it doesn't seem capable of supporting life. but it supports the kind of life page is interested in. an emaciated woman with a feral smile slides onto a stool beside page. he gives one shake of his head, and she slides away again. his eyes cut to a group of females. he waits for the next approach. close on: page as a hand reaches over his shoulder and places a precog disc on the bar in front of him. page makes a sound and tries to jump away, as if the disc is something lethal. which it is, in a way. anderson presses him back down on his stool. sits next to him. page stares at him, scared. anderson looks straight ahead as he speaks.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{"ennis page engages the services of prostitutes because his relationships with them compound his feelings of selfloathing."}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{direct quote from your psychological profile the kind of shit i had to know as your former boss.}
<C>__{anderson }
<D>__{"page is an obsessive compulsive type nine." another quote. niners are great for the kind of work you do keeping all those precog discs in order.}
<A>__{you can almost see page's heart slamming in his chest. he tries to hide it with tough talk.}
<C>__{page}
<D>__{i fuck whores and i'm orderly, so what?}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{something's out of order, ennis. deeply out of order.}
<A>__{page looks unhappily at the disc on the bar page you got a disc anderson picks it up, holds it tight in his fist}
<C>__{anderson }
<D>__{not a disc. the disc. when i went home sick, i stole it.}
<C>__{anderson }
<D>__{i took it with me, ennis. i wasn't sick, i was running with the evidence.}
<P>__{(lets that sink in)}
<D>__{so how is it that precrime has one, too?}
<C>__{page}
<P>__{(utterly baffled)}
<D>__{you can't make copies}
<A>__{anderson waits. lets page work through it.}
<C>__{page }
<D>__{it's the basis of the system. the immutable evidence. copies are impossible.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you went home. a little later, i came in with a disc for mr. witwer to review. i wasn't halfway out the door when he cried out.}
<A>__{anderson is barely breathing, he's listening so hard.}
<C>__{page }
<D>__{he was in shock. he showed me. it was you shooting him. then all hell broke loose. he had to send the precrime units to your house.}
<C>__{anderson}
<D>__{ennis you gave out the same disc twice. less than an hour apart. the one i stole. and then another one. of the same event.}
<C>__{page}
<D>__{it's impossible. the precogs can only move forward to new events. into the future. they never repeat.}
<A>__{anderson looks around. patrons are beginning to look over in his direction, eyes lingering. he rises. page seems in a daze. as an obsessive compulsive niner, the concept of an untidy system is disorienting. anderson starts to say something to the man, then doesn't. on the way out anderson gets identiscanned. an automatic digital voice calls out after him.}
<C>__{digital voice}
<D>__{have a nice night, mr. symington}
<A>__{anderson leaves the dark of the bar for the deeper dark of the sprawl.}
