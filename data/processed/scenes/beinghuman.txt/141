<A>__{it is a glorious dawn. bobby sits looking out on the valley, smoking his pipe. behind him hector is busy writing in his log book.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{isn't it a beautiful day?}
<A>__{hector finishes his writing, tears out the page from his book. he offers it to bobby.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i've said who we are and where we're headed. want to sign it, write anything?}

<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i was going to call it tobacco mountain... or mount alicia... but nathaniel's fine...}
<A>__{hector smiles. he puts the paper in a small leather pouch, puts the pouch on the ground near the shelter, and starts to build a small pile of protective stones on top of it. bobby stands, and turns to watch him.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{let's get away from here.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{north?}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{yeah. keep the sun on our backs.}
<A>__{bobby walks off with great clouds of tobacco smoke billowing defiantly around him, as if to challenge their night time tormentor. hector takes a last look at their shelter and its little memorial cairn and then runs to catch up with bobby.}
