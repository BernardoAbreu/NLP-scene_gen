<A>__{becomes impatient. sneaks his way over to the garbage chute. sticks his head in.}
<D>__{wall e ee vahh?!}
<A>__{no answer. the chute has an endless drop. wall e climbs in. holds himself spread eagle to stay in place. carefully inches his way up to the captain's quarters...}
<B>__{out on the upper deck}
<A>__{a monorail pulls up. m o steps off. still hot on wall e's trail. scrubs the dirty tracks towards the bridge lobby. then notices wall e's fresh tracks... ...leading to the trash chute.}

<D>__{[ah hah! gotcha!]}
<A>__{back in the captain's quarters the captain at his wet bar. waters the plant in the sink.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{there you go little guy. you came a long way for a drink of water... just needed someone to look after you, that's all }
<A>__{he is struck with a notion. stares out the window at space for a beat. sees his reflection holding the plant. glances at his earth globe.}
<C>__{captain}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{we have to go back.}
<A>__{activates his chair's call button.}
<C>__{captain}

<C>__{autopilot}
<D>__{not necessary, captain. you may give it to me.}

<C>__{autopilot}
<D>__{sir, we cannot go home.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{what are you talking about? why not?}
<C>__{autopilot}
<D>__{that is classified. captain, give me the plant.}

<D>__{aye aye, sir.}
<A>__{auto rises back into the ceiling. lowers down over the vanity console. high speed button pushing. a new bnl video message appears. labeled: "top secret: for autopilot eye only". the bnl fanfare plays. cut to the bnl ceo at the podium. haggard. nervous. wears an emergency oxygen vest. the fanfare plays too long.}
<C>__{buy n large ceo}
<P>__{(to o.s.)}
<D>__{just cut it off, will ya?!}
<P>__{(music stops; forced chuckle)}
<D>__{hey there, autopilots! uh, got some bad news. operation cleanup has, uh, well... failed! wouldn't you know, rising toxicity levels have made life unsustainable on earth.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{unsustainable? what?}
<C>__{buy n large ceo}
<D>__{darn it all, we're going to have to cancel operation recolonize.}
<P>__{(dons his life vest)}
<D>__{so just, uh...just stay the course. rather than try to fix this problem, it'll just be easier if everyone remains in space.}
<C>__{captain}
<P>__{(offended)}
<D>__{easier?}
<C>__{ceo advisor }
<D>__{mr. president, sir, it's time to go.}

<P>__{(throws on his gas mask; to camera crew)}
<D>__{now let's get the heck out of here.}
<A>__{the ceo races out of the room. the message cuts out. auto turns to face the captain. the captain shakes his head in disgust.}
<C>__{autopilot}
<D>__{now, the plant.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{no, wait a minute. computer, when was that message sent to the axiom?}
<A>__{the paused image on the holo screen highlights. data begins to calculate on the screen. we see years scroll rapidly backwards. it stops on "2110".}
<C>__{ship's computer}
<D>__{message received in the year 2110.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{that's that's nearly 700 years ago!! auto, things have changed! we've got to go back!}
<C>__{autopilot}
<D>__{sir, orders are: "do not return to earth".}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{but life is sustainable now! look at this plant, green and growing! it's living proof he was wrong.}

<D>__{irrelevant, captain.}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{what?! it's completely relevant!}
<P>__{(points out to space)}
<D>__{out there is our home! home, auto! and it's in trouble! i can't just sit here and...and...do nothing! that's all i've done! that's all anyone on this blasted ship has ever done...nothing!!}

<C>__{captain}
<D>__{daaaargh!!}
<A>__{the captain turns away in frustration. his eyes catch sight of the captain portraits. notices auto in every one of them. looking over all their shoulders. a little closer every generation. the captain slowly looks over his shoulder... ...and auto is right behind him. the captain looks at the plant in his lap. his countenance grows determined. he rights his hat... ...turns to face auto... ...and gives the most authoritative order of his career:}
<C>__{captain}
<D>__{i'm the captain of the axiom. we are going home today!}
<A>__{auto slides into his face. makes the captain flinch. no more mr. nice robot. auto emits an electronic command.}

<D>__{gopher?}

<D>__{eve, arrest him!}
<A>__{eve draws her gun arm. points it at gopher. the robot raises his epaulet arms. don't shoot! she opens her chest cavity. motions for gopher to put the plant inside her.}

<D>__{eve, you are to put this plant straight in the holo detector.}
<A>__{gopher slowly advances towards eve. but then tosses the plant across the room... ...down the trash chute.}

<A>__{auto flips open one of his handles. produces a taser... ...and electrocutes wall e. wall e's chest circuitry blows out. he wheezes... ...then drops lifelessly down the chute. eve screams. gopher floats her trapped form over to auto. the button on her defect boot is pressed. she shuts down.}
<B>__{inside the garbage chute}
<A>__{gopher's ray holds eve over the opening. drops her down the chute. she bangs against the sides as she tumbles. back in the captain's quarters gopher salutes auto and exits. auto turns to the captain. he is in shock.}
