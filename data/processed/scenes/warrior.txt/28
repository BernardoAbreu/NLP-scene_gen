<A>__{paddy places the cup of coffee on the night stand as tommy stirs, then sits on the empty bed and unrolls the poster. it's yellowed with age and covered with a boy's handwriting. on board: theogenes 1415 wins. no losses. tommy conlon 315 wins. no losses. also, a 1994 newspaper clipping reading "prodigy wins state championship," and above it, goals: 1998, college, penn state. 2000, summer olympics, gold medal.}
