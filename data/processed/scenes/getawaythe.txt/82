<C>__{beynon}
<D>__{your wife told me no one would be killed.}
<C>__{doc}

<C>__{beynon}

<C>__{doc}
<D>__{that's your problem.}
<C>__{beynon}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{you know, you and i may be two of a kind.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{no way. i always do my own work.}
<A>__{beynon smiles and slops three fingers of whiskey into doc's glass.}
<C>__{beynon}
<D>__{here. i understand the way you feel. as a matter of fact, you and i might share a great many feelings...}
<A>__{beynon drinks from his glass. doc continues counting the money.}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(snaps the words)}
<D>__{i'm in a hurry.}
<C>__{beynon}
<D>__{you still don't get the picture do you? i've always heard what a smart ass operator you are.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{no applause!}
<A>__{beynon pauses a moment. doc looks steadily across the table into beynonts eyes. prom beyond there might be the quiet sound of a screen door opening. beynon gets out of the chair, stands beside the table.}
<C>__{beynon}
<D>__{let's examine the situation. one, an extremely attractive woman. then, there's the woman's husband, a skillful bank robber serving a long sentence in prison. three, a man with political influence, a man who can easily get a parole for a convict... why should he?}
<A>__{beynon sips his glass slowly. doc's hand edges down toward his waist band.}
<C>__{beynon }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{a simple reason, mccoy. the obvious reason. to rob a bank.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i knew that life didn't add up to the obvious when i was 8.}
<C>__{beynon}
<P>__{(cautiously)}
<D>__{what do you add up to here?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{one. the radio's rappin' about $750^000. we only got a half a million.}
<C>__{beynon}
<D>__{a little more was taken out before.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{my brother's a director of that bank, mr. mccoy... i had a few pressing debts.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{so we did that crackerbox... to cover for you.}
<C>__{beynon}
<P>__{(smiles., nodding)}
<D>__{the obvious.}
<P>__{(as his smile fades)}
<D>__{but we are both not interested in that right now.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(a long beat)}
<D>__{my old lady must have made a lot of promises.}
<C>__{beynon}
<D>__{close... but it takes a hell of a lot more than promises to pull the kind of strings i pulled.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i bet.}
<A>__{doc senses a movement from the shadows behind beynon. turning his head slightly, doc can see carol standing at the entrance to the kitchen. she holds a .32 automatic... the pistol seems to be pointed directly at doc.}
<C>__{beynon}
<D>__{you wouldn't have come here when you were eight3 mr. mccoy.}
<A>__{as the gun continues to be pointed directly at doc.}
<C>__{beynon }
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{don't think too badly of her... after all, you were in jail a long time and she is a healthy young woman.}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(riding over beynon's words)}
<D>__{get it over with...}
<A>__{carol fires the automatic. the big gun belches the full slip in a stuttering explosion... the slide remains back and in an ejected position. beynon is driven back to the kitchen wall. he shrieks aloud, the noise strangely like laughter... his body flattens against the surface, slips downward^ riddled by the big bore slugs... doc stands momentarily frozen against the overturned table. he looks up from beynon's crumpled body. carol takes two steps forward, then drops the automatic, sending it clattering and spinning away across the floor. doc looks at carol, their eyes find each other. he turns, moves to the sink, splashes water across his face, then fills a glass of water from the tap ... drinks it; he looks back at her. carol stands watching doc, tears scream down her cheeks. doc crosses to carol, takes her arm, picks up the gun, spent shells and the suitcase, then leads her out of the kitchen toward the back door. beynon's body has slipped from sight, only a few traces of blood show along the white wall.}
