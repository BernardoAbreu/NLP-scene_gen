<L>__{exterior fort hays day}
<A>__{the insane face of major fambrough peeks around the corner of a building. on his head is a ridiculous, plumed hat. now he looks both ways, as if preparing to cross a busy street. seeing that the coast is clear, he minces into the parade ground in front of headquarters. the plume is waving in the breeze and the major carries something in each hand... an officer's sword and a revolver. except for these items, the unfortunate major is naked. as he trots onto the parade ground, fambrough is startled to find that elgin is following him. he begins to run faster. fambrough halts near the center of the parade ground and turns back on the lieutenant and waves his pistol menacingly.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{noooo, noooo...}
<C>__{elgin}
<D>__{it's alright major.}
<A>__{now elgin sees a grizzled sergeant approaching fambrough from the opposite direction.}
<C>__{sergeant}
<D>__{leave him alone lieutenant... he's cracked.}
<A>__{fambrough turns on the voice behind him and waves his pistol at the sergeant.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{nooo, nooo...}
<A>__{but fambrough finds himself staring at the barrel of the sergeant's raised pistol.}
<C>__{elgin}
<D>__{don't sergeant.}
<A>__{in a panic fambrough wheels back on lieutenant elgin.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{are you deaf fool. i said i will have my crown this instant... this instant!}
<A>__{slowly and kindly, elgin is walking toward him. he holds out his hand.}
<C>__{elgin}
<D>__{let's have the pistol.}
<C>__{sergeant}
<P>__{(to elgin)}
<D>__{don't do it.}
<A>__{but the lieutenant keeps his hand held out. fambrough eyes him silently. then he screws up his face like a crybaby.}
<C>__{fambrough}
<D>__{the king is dead... long live the king.}
<A>__{in one swift motion, fambrough brings the revolver up, swallows the barrel and pulls the trigger.}
