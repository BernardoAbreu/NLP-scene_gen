<A>__{susan moves away from the door, goes over the mimic carcass, filled with the bloody bandages. platform by the tracks peter makes his way to the edge of the platform, whispering to himself. he lowers himself slowly to the track. platform near the switchroom manny moves toward the door. a large window of dusty glass reflects his image...and the distant ones of the mimics.}

<A>__{peter gets to the track. he turns and is met face to face with a mimic! its antennae move toward his head, curious. its human mask face plate clicks apart and together. peter remains stock still. he starts breathing deeply...}
