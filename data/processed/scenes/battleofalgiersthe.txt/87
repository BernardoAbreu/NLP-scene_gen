<L>__{86 casbah views and terraces. outside. night.}
<A>__{in the dark in front of them, a metallic reflection is visible and the sharp and aggressive sound of an algerian voice is heard. ali responds to the password. a youth steps out from the shadows. he too is carrying a machine gun, recognizes ali, and greets him. ali and ben m'hidi continue ...}
<L>__{87 maison des arbres, terrace. outside. night.}
<A>__{until they arrive at a terrace which is separated from the next one by an alley about ten feet wide.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{here it is ... we've arrived ...}
<A>__{ben m'hidi glances at the emptiness beneath them, looks at ali, and takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{ben m'hidi}
<D>__{not yet ...}
<A>__{ali has climbed onto the parapet, looks around him concentrating attentively for a moment, and then jumps into the void, reaching the opposite side. he bends, searches for something in the dark, and lifts a type of gangplank. he hands it over to ben m'hidi, and together they place it between the two terraces.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{be careful now. unless you know how it works, it's better if you sit on the plank and move forward like this ...}
<C>__{ben m'hidi}
<D>__{let's try ...}
<A>__{he tries to stand up on the gangplank, but he lacks the necessary steadiness. he can't hold his balance. he does as ali has advised him; he sits astride on the plank, and using the force of his arms, he pushes himself forward. he stops halfway to rest for a minute.}
<C>__{ben m'hidi}
<D>__{it's good nobody is following us ...}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{it's a question of habit ...}
<A>__{and when ben m'hidi is closer, ali helps him to get down to the terrace.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{it's better if i go first, to make sure everything's okay ...}
<A>__{without waiting for an answer, he moves toward the stairway that leads to the floor below; his movements are silent and graceful. ben m'hidi leans out from the terrace, and looks toward the european city and the sea. at the port, two searchlights are lit, and their long bright rays move slowly toward the casbah ... when ali la pointe returns, ben m'hidi is still leaning on the railing. he seems not to hear the sound of ali's footsteps, or his voice.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{everything's okay ... they're waiting for you ...}
<A>__{ali moves near him, and ben m'hidi turns and looks at him.}
<C>__{ben m'hidi}
<D>__{what do you think of the strike, ali?}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{i think it'll be a success ...}
<C>__{ben m'hidi}
<D>__{yes, i think so too ... it's been organized well ... but what will the french do?}
<A>__{both the question, and the answer seem obvious to ali.}
<C>__{ali}
<P>__{(shrugging)}
<D>__{it's clear. they'll do everything possible to make it fail.}
<C>__{ben m'hidi}
<D>__{no, they'll do even more. we've given them the opportunity to do a lot more ... do you understand what i mean? starting tomorrow, they won't be groping in the dark any more; every shop and every worker who strikes will be a known enemy, a self confessed criminal ... and they will be able to pass to the offensive. have you thought of this?}
<A>__{ali has listened attentively. the effort with which he is trying to ask himself the meaning of these words is visible on his face.}
<C>__{ali}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{no ...}
<C>__{ben m'hidi}
<D>__{but kader told me that you weren't in favor of the strike.}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{no, and neither were my men.}
<C>__{ben m'hidi}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{because they told us that we mustn't use weapons, now, when the time is right.}
<C>__{ben m'hidi}
<D>__{that's true ... wars aren't won with terrorism, neither wars nor revolutions. terrorism is a beginning but afterward, all the people must act ... this is the reason for the strike, and its necessity: to mobilize all algerians, count them and measure their strength ...}
<C>__{ali}
<D>__{to show them to the un, right?}
<C>__{ben m'hidi}
<P>__{(smiling slightly)}
<D>__{yes ... yes. the problem also involves the un. i don't know what it's worth, but this way, we'll give the un the possibility of evaluating our strength.}
<A>__{ali breathes deeply, instinctively, unrestrainedly, ben m'hidi watches him, smiles, and says:}
<C>__{ben m'hidi}
<D>__{do you know something ali? starting a revolution is hard, and it's even harder to continue it. winning is hardest of all. but only afterward, when we have won, will the real hardships begin.}
<A>__{he pats ali's back fondly with his hand and continues, smiling:}
<C>__{ben m'hidi}
<D>__{anyway, there's still a lot to be done ... you aren't already tired, ali, are you?}
<A>__{ali looks at him, and without reacting to his irony:}
<C>__{ali}
<P>__{(with conviction)}
<D>__{no!}
