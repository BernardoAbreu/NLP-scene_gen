<A>__{two teams of girls, among them norma watson, helen shyres, cora and rhonda wilson (sisters although not identical twins), chris hargensen and sue snell. supervising the game is miss collins wearing a warm up suit and holding a whistle awaiting the next pointerior among the girls is carrie anxiously watching for the ball to come her way. it has apparently been a close game, the competition building steadily. when the shot begins, miss collins has just blown her whistle to announce:}
<C>__{collins}
<D>__{okay, now. this is game pointerior}
<A>__{this is the final point of the game and rhonda wilson is serving (she is on the opposite team as carrie).}

<P>__{(giving the score)}
<D>__{twenty twenty.}
<A>__{the ball is successfully served and remains in play for some time as the girls skillfully volley it back and forth over the net. and then, just when the tension is its greatest, the ball comes over the net toward carrie. it's evident that the outcome of the game depends upon her success. the little boy who decided to put his finger in the dyke had it easier. the other girls are (ad lib) shouting cautions and admonitions to carrie. carrie almost trembles with tension, about to bat the ball over the net, afraid to hit it. carrie whacks the ball. she shacks it hard. and on a line straight into the net. another chorus of groans, with remarks like "wouldn't you know!" and "dumbo!" reinforcing them. chris storms back toward carrie.}

<D>__{you eat shit!}
<A>__{miss collins blows her whistle.}
