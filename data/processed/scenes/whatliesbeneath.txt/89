<A>__{jody looks down.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{what?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{jody what?}
<A>__{jody looks up, tears in her eyes.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{oh god...you knew.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{i was down in adamant...}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{adamant?}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{artsy little village down seven. there's a guy there who sells my work. i had just dropped off some paintings and as i got in my car...i saw norman sitting at this little cafe.}
<A>__{claire waits for her to continue.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{i started to walk over...but he wasn't alone. a blond. i only caught a glimpse. she was young.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i should have said something right away. but i didn't.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{partly because i didn't want to hurt you...but partly...partly because i was relieved.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{relieved?}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{i had just been left by richard. i was bitter and miserable and for some fucked up reason, it made me feel better that your life wasn't as perfect as it seemed.}
<A>__{claire nods.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{by the time i finally got up the nerve to tell you, stan called from the hospital and it was too late.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{too late? jody, it was an accident.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{alone? on a two lane road? with a ton of valium in your system?}
<A>__{claire walks over to a window.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{i got there first. stan covered up the pills and i had it out with norman. he seemed desperate not to lose you. he promised to handle it. and we all let it drop away.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{all of us.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{i'm a terrible friend.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{claire turns.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{how could i expect you to tell me something that i wouldn't even tell myself?}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{what are you going to do?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{if she was dangerous before }
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{she could have hurt me if she wanted to.}
<C>__{jody}
<D>__{you don't know that.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{if it's your belief that gives her form, then you've got to shut her out. somehow you have to break the connection.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{no. she wanted me to know the truth. now that i do...i think she's at peace.}
<A>__{jody isn't as sure.}
