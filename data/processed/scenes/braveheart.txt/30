<A>__{longshanks is being listened to by his advisors, all in the outrageous splendor of royal military dress, and all deathly afraid of him.}
<C>__{longshanks}
<D>__{the french will grovel to anyone with strength! but how will they credit our strength when we cannot rule the whole of our own island?!}
<A>__{he punches the map, then sees the princess enter softly.}
<C>__{longshanks}
<D>__{where is my son?}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{your pardon, m'lord, he asked me to come in his stead.}
<A>__{longshanks' eyes expand in fury; it is frightening to see.}
<C>__{longshanks}
<D>__{i sent for him and the little coward send you?!}
<C>__{princess}
<D>__{shall i leave, m'lord?}
<C>__{longshanks}
<D>__{if he wants his queen to rule, then you stay and learn how! i will deal with him.}
<A>__{he spins back toward his generals. ignored, the princess settles silently onto the cushions of the window seat.}
<C>__{longshanks}
<D>__{nobles are the key to the scottish door. grant their nobles land here in england. give our own nobles estates in the north. make them too greedy to oppose us.}
<A>__{one old advisor speaks up hesitantly.}
<C>__{old advisor}
<D>__{sire... our nobles will be reluctant to relocate. new lands mean new taxes, and they are taxed already for our war in france.}
<A>__{longshanks glares at him, but takes the pointerior the wheels grind in his brain; his dark eyes falling on the princess, he is inspired.}
<C>__{longshanks}
<D>__{perhaps it's time to reinstitute an old custom. grant them prima noctes, "first night." when any common girl inhabiting their lands is married, our lords shall have sexual rights to her on the night of her wedding. that should fetch just the kind of lords we want in scotland.}
