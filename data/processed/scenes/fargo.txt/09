<A>__{the wrecked car's headlights shine off into a snowfield abutting the highway. a young man in a down parka is limping across the snowfield, away from the wrecked car. grimsrud strides calmly out after the injured boy. he raises his gun and fires. with a poof of feathers, a hole opens up in the boy's back and he pitches into the snow. grimsrud walks up to the wreck and peers in its half open door. a young woman is trapped inside the twisted wreckage, injured. snow swirls in the headlights of the wreck. grimsrud raises his gun and fires.}

<A>__{a blue winged teal in flight over a swampy marshland. the room in which it hangs is dark. we hear off screen snoring. we track off to reveal an easel upon which we see a half completed oil of a grey mallard. the continuing track reveals a couple in bed, sleeping. the man, fortyish, pajama clad, is big, and big bellied. his mouth is agape. he snores. his arms are flung over a woman in her thirties, wearing a nightie, mouth also open, not snoring. we hold for a long beat on their regular breathing and snoring. the phone rings. the woman stirs.}
