<L>__{interior queens detention center, visiting room day}
<A>__{walter is waiting for tarek. the visiting room is empty. suddenly the door opens on the detainee side of the glass and a very young latin woman walks out tentatively. she almost looks absurd in the oversized blue jumpsuit. she looks at walter, unsure if she is supposed to approach the glass and talk to him. walter just stares back, also unsure of what to do. they are caught in awkward moment. finally walter manages a nod. she nods back and smiles. it is the innocent smile of a child. suddenly a female guard appears in the doorway and beckons the young girl back inside. the young girl looks at walter one last moment before disappearing behind the door.}
