<L>__{interior hannah's kitchen night}
<A>__{hannah, licking her fingers, walks past a memo cluttered refrigerator to the stove as holly, behind her, begins to speak. the faint sounds of music are still heard.}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{hannah, i have to borrow some more money.}
<P>__{(sipping her drink)}
<D>__{don't get upset.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(stirring some food in a saucepan on the stove)}
<D>__{mmm, i never get upset over that. mmm?}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{this is the last time, i promise. and i'm keeping strict accounts.}
<A>__{as holly talks, sipping her drink, hannah busily works in the kitchen, which contains a large center table stacked with bowls and plates of food, hanging pots and pans, and general party clutter. she walks on and offscreen as she talks and listens to her sister.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{holly, please. don't insult me.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(putting her empty}
<D>__{glass and plate down}
<P>__{on the table)}
<D>__{someday, i will pay it all back.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{i know. h how much do you need?}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{two thousand dollars.}
<A>__{hannah, who'd been mashing some food in a bowl on a nearby counter, hesitates momentarily. she turns to holly.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(trying to nod her head casually)}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(gesturing, her back to the camera)}
<D>__{hannah, i know it's a lot, but my friend april and i, we have this catering idea i think's going to be great.}
<A>__{hannah, licking her fingers, walks past holly.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(turning to face hannah)}
<D>__{you admit that we're great cooks, right?}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(nodding, back at the}
<D>__{stove now, stirring}
<P>__{in a pot)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(putting her hands in her pockets)}
<D>__{well, in order to get started, there's just a few things i have to buy...}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{and some old debts i have outstanding.}
<C>__{hannah}
<P>__{(looking at her sister)}
<D>__{will you just tell me one thing?}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{are we talking about cocaine again?}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(shaking her head no)}
<D>__{i swear. i swear. we've already got some requests to do a few dinner parties.}
<A>__{a timer goes off. hannah walks past holly to attend to some food on a different stove. holly turns to face her. only holly is seen as she talks to the offscreen hannah, the camera moving in closer on her face. as holly speaks, she distractedly nibbles an hors d'oeuvre. in the background, her parents can be heard singing in the living room.}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{i mean, obviously, i'm not going to be a caterer forever, you know. we both still go to auditions. something could turn up at any moment. but the parties are at night, days are free, i can still take my acting class. i haven't done drugs on a year.}
<A>__{holly pops another hors d'oeuvre into her mouth as the background singing gets louder and the film cuts to:}
