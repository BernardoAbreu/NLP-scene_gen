<D>__{what's the point in thinking about it? if i ever have another relationship, i will buy her, whoever she is, stuff that she oughta like but doesn't know about that's what new boyfriends are for. and hopefully i won't borrow money from her, or have an affair, and she won't need to have an abortion or run away with the neighborhood, and then there won't be anything to think about. laura didn't run off with ian because i bought her cds she wasn't that keen on, and to pretend otherwise is just... just... psychowank. if she thinks that, then she's missing the brazilian rainforest for the twigs. if i can't buy the plastic people of the universe's first album for new girlfriends, then i might as well give up, because i'm not sure i know how to do anything else.}
