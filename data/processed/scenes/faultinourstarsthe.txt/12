<L>__{int bathroom same}
<A>__{hazel catches her breath. shakes her head. surprised at herself. she looks in the mirror. so doesn't like what she sees. the earth starts moving again. cut to:}
<L>__{int church basement later}
<A>__{hazel sits in the circle of sick.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{who would like to begin?}
<A>__{no volunteers. hazel catches sight of the beautiful boy, sitting next to isaac. he seems to be watching her, that same flirty smile on his face. she self consciously looks away.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{isaac, i know you're facing a challenging time. perhaps you would like to say something...}
<A>__{isaac nods, rises.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{yeah, um... i'm isaac. 17. eye cancer.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{it's looking like another surgery in a couple weeks. after which, well, i will be blind...}
<A>__{hazel tries to focus on what isaac's saying but it's difficult. she still feels the beautiful boy's gaze on her.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{not that i'm complaining or anything. i know a lot of you have it way worse but, still, i mean, you know, being blind's gonna suck...}
<A>__{as isaac shares, the beautiful boy doesn't look away from hazel. hazel finds this intimidating. and intimidation irritates her. so she decides to play the game with him, meeting his gaze and holding it just as firmly. a staring contest.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{...my girlfriend helps. and friends like augustus here...}
<A>__{isaac nods towards the beautiful boy who now has a name augustus. he still doesn't look away from hazel.}
<C>__{isaac}
<D>__{so... yeah. that's what's up.}
<C>__{all in unison}
<D>__{"we're here for you isaac."}
<A>__{the staring contest continues another few beats until:}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{and does your friend want to speak?}
<A>__{this causes the beautiful boy to momentarily look away. aha, he's lost the contest! hazel smiles, flicks her eyebrows up as if to say "victory is mine!" he smiles back at her, the most radiant smile on the planet. he turns back to the group.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{hi. i'm augustus waters. 17. had a touch of osteosarcoma bout a year and a half ago lost this baby as a result...}
<A>__{gus holds up his right leg a prosthetic.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{but really i'm just here at isaac's request.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{and how are you feeling augustus?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{me? oh i'm grand. i'm on a roller coaster that only goes up, my friend.}
<A>__{hazel smiles. gus catches this. embarrassed, she stops smiling and looks away.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{perhaps you'd like to share your fears with the group, augustus.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{my fears?}
<A>__{gus thinks about this.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{oblivion.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{oblivion?}
<A>__{angle on hazel, intrigued.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{yeah, see... i intend to live an extraordinary life. to be remembered. if i'm scared of anything it's... not doing that.}
<A>__{patrick doesn't quite have the tools to deal with that.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{would, uh, anyone like to speak to that?}
<A>__{and hazel's hand goes up. even patrick is surprised by that.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{hazel! that's unexpected.}
<A>__{hazel stands, takes a second to gather her thoughts. augustus watches her, waits for it.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{i just wanna say... there will come a time when, you know, all of us are dead.}
<A>__{gus is now even more fixed on her than before.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{it might be tomorrow. might be a million years from now but... it's gonna happen. and when it does, enough generations will come and go, there'll be no one left to remember cleopatra. or mozart. or muhammad ali, let alone any of us, right?}
<A>__{the look on gus's face is unreadable.}
<C>__{hazel}
<D>__{oblivion's inevitable. and if that scares you, well, i suggest you ignore it. god knows it's what everyone else does.}
<A>__{a beat. and then an enormous smile spreads across gus's face, not a flirty smile but a surprised one, a real one. cut to:}
