<A>__{marian pulling her luggage apprehensively down the street. she passes the squatters, a motley group of homeless teenagers, pierced, tattooed, wild hairdos and even wilder attire.}
<D>__{squatter #1 hey, lady, can you help us out with some change today?}
<A>__{marian, shocked by their circumstances, rolls her luggage past them, smiling faintly.}
<D>__{squatter #2 come on. every little bit helps. a little food, you know?}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{maybe some other time. squatter #1 thanks a lot anyway.}
<A>__{marian continues on. she's distracted by ... a woman in her thirties, who looks like she hasn't slept in a week, bent over the railing of a second story fire escape balcony, in the throes of a veritable rage.}
<C>__{woman in a rage}
<D>__{you forgot your fucking plant, you fucking asshole!}
<A>__{marian stares up at her, even more disconcerted than ever. the enraged woman continues her tirade at an unseen old boyfriend below.}

<A>__{marian looks away and, intrepid midwesterner that she is, pushes on. a man, dressed strangely, stands surreally in the middle of the street, blowing huge clouds of cigarette smoke. a gay couple parade past, laughing hysterically. new angle at the end of the street a pack of unmufflered, chrome coruscating harleys round the corner in a ear shattering approach. marian stops dead in her tracks and stares in heartstopping terror. across the street the bikers, wearing their club's colors embroidered on blue jeans, and leather, vests, back their motorcycles in a uniform row against the curb, kill their engines, park them at an angle on their kickstands, and dismount. they high five a biker known as the disciple prospect, a small, mean looking man with a red bandana tied taut over his head, and then disappear into the windowless clubhouse, passing through a large, forbidding, black door with the skeleton of death riding a motorcycle painted on it. the disciple prospect tosses the butt of a cigarette into a rusted steel drum and flames erupt. marian in horror, cannot pry her eyes away from them. new angle an upstairs window on a six story, red brick co op building. paula, marian's daughter, a pretty woman with short dark hair, is leaning out the window, waving.}
