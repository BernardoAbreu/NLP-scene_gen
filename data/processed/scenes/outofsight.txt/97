<L>__{interior ripley enterprises personnel office day}
<A>__{the personnel guy, mr. hearn, sits behind his desk, squeezing a grip exerciser and smiling warmly at foley, who wears a shitty suit and tie.}
<C>__{mr. hearn}
<D>__{now mr ripley and i have had a long discussion about your role in the company and it was his feeling that you would be happiest working down here in miami. how's that sound to you?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{great.}
<A>__{mr. hearn pauses, looks down at foley...}
<C>__{mr. hearn}
<D>__{you're about a 42 long, right?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{but mr. hearn walks out without answering. foley looks at the desktop, where a spoon sticks out of a half eaten fruit on the bottom yogurt, which in turn sits beside a half eaten powerbar. foley shakes his head, takes out his zippo, starts to play with it.}
<C>__{mr. hearn}
<D>__{okay. let's see how she fits.}
<A>__{foley turns as mr. hearn bounces back into the room with what looks like a uniform draped over one arm.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{what is this?}
<C>__{mr. hearn}
<D>__{your uniform.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{my what?}
<A>__{mr. hearn shows him the yellow patch that reads security on one arm. foley smiles... amused... angry... hurt...}
<C>__{foley }
<D>__{are you kidding me?}
<A>__{richard ripley's office view. wet bar. huge fucking aquarium.}
<C>__{receptionist }
<D>__{sir, you can't go in there...}
<A>__{ripley looks up from his desk as foley steps in, the receptionist right behind him now.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{jack? whoa what's the problem? take it easy, let's talk...}
<A>__{meanwhile, ripley pushes a panic button beneath his desk...}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{a security guard? are you fucking kidding me?}
<A>__{ripley considers foley a moment, then...}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{you know, i wasn't sure you'd show up. but i was pretty sure that, if you did, you'd throw the job in my face.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{understand something, jack. up to this point, everything you've done with your life means absolutely nothing in the real world. less than nothing.}
<A>__{foley says nothing.}
<C>__{ripley }
<D>__{you're a bank robber. this is not a marketable skill. there are no old bank robbers out in the world living on pensions. you know this. that's why you're here right now.}
<A>__{still foley says nothing.}
<C>__{ripley }
<D>__{today, i'm offering you a lousy job at a lousy wage. you think you're better than that? fine. show me. show me that you're really willing to change and we'll talk about something better. a lot better. but first, jack, you gotta earn it.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{how, dick? the way you earned it? by marrying some rich broad owns the company, selling it off a piece at a time, then divorcing her? what is this knute rockne, pull yourself up by the bootstraps bullshit? back in prison, guy like you, place like that, you were ice cream for freaks. you were a goddamn dumpling. maurice and a dozen other guys coulda bled you till you had nothing. till you were nothing. i saved your ass. so you'll pardon me if i don't wanna sit on a fuckin stool all day saying "sign in here please" or "hey, pal, you can't park there." okay, dick? i can't do it.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{jack, i'm disappointed. i guess i misjudged you.}
<A>__{two massive security guards appear in the doorway...}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{hey, what job he promise you guys?}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{there's two ways we can do this.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{yeah? what are they?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{gentlemen. i think we've calmed down now. haven't we, jack?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{oh, yeah, i'm calm. in fact, i'm totally "relaxed..."}
<A>__{and with that he picks up a paperweight (a lead fish) and wings it at the aquarium, shattering the glass.}
