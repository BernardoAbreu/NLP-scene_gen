<L>__{exterior deck day}
<A>__{the sky is dark and a storm is building and the boat rolls and pitches. chuck sees terry heaving over the side. john and tod hear the sound and turn.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(disgusted)}
<D>__{come on man. show a little backbone!}
<P>__{(to tod)}
<D>__{you believe that?!}
<A>__{tod is fixated on terry. suddenly, without warning, he breaks for the rail and lets fly. phil and charlie are nexterior chris climbs through the companionway but doesn't make it to the side. spontaneous regurgitation. bill and lawford jump up onto the wheel housing to avoid being sprayed. suddenly everyone is heaving.}

<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{lawford}
<P>__{(to bill)}
<D>__{we're gonna have nobody left up here to crew. better let skipper know.}
<A>__{bill nods and disappears. john joins chuck watching the events around him.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{well gieg, i'm glad to see i'm not the only guy on this boat that can take a little rock'n roll. bunch of wusses, i swear...!}
<A>__{chuck watches each of his shipmates. then, suddenly, out of nowhere projectile vomit all over john. he looks at chuck, horrified, then he too, cuts loose over the rail.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{son of a bitch!!}
<A>__{chuck looks at john, furious with himself, and begins to laugh. but after a moment he starts to laugh too. it's infectious, they crack each other up. then, in the middle of belly laughing, they simultaneously retch again over the side.}
