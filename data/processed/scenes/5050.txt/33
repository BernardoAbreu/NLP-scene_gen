<L>__{exterior hospital day}
<A>__{rachel pulls her car up to the front of the hospital. adam kisses her goodbye and gets out of the car. he takes a few steps and then turns back. he gives her a nervous smile and then continues into the hospital.}
<L>__{interior hospital corridor moments later}
<A>__{adam walks down the hospital corridor passing dozens of patients, none of whom are under the age of 40. in adam's hand is the business card with "mount sinai psychology group" written on it. he finds the office and knocks on the half opened door. the office is small, cold and emotionless with stacks of psychology books and files strewn about. an attractive young woman, katie (26), sits behind a desk reading a file while she eats a rather messy sandwich. katie takes her job very seriously, but has not quite mastered the art of speaking without sounding like a rigid grad student. kate looks up as she takes a bite of her sandwich.}
<C>__{katie}
<P>__{(mouth full of food)}
<D>__{can i help you?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{i have an appointment with dr. mcrae.}
<A>__{katie puts down the sandwich, rises from her seat and puts her hand out to shake adam's.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{please call me katie.}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(confused)}
<D>__{you're dr. mcrae?}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{you were expecting someone else?}
<A>__{katie wraps up her sandwich and puts the rest away.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{aren't you supposed to be like sixty five and wear earth toned sweaters?}
<C>__{katie}
<P>__{(slightly defensive)}
<D>__{why? did someone say that's what i look like?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{no, no, no. i was just expecting someone older.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{sorry to disappoint you.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{no believe me, you're fine. better than fine, you're dr. mcrae...you're a doctor? how old are you?}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{twenty six.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{twenty six? what are you like doogie howser?}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{doogie howser...}
<A>__{off katie's blank look.}
<C>__{adam }
<D>__{...the teenage doctor.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{does he work here?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{no. nevermind...but aren't you young to be a doctor?}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{i'm actually in my final semester of medical school.}
<P>__{(off adam's look)}
<D>__{this is a training hospital.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{so have you had many patients?}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{you're actually my first.}
<A>__{that did not help to ease adam's anxiety.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{please sit.}
<A>__{adam notices a dark stain on the couch. he sits as far from it as possible. katie pulls out adam's file and sits in a chair across from him. adam looks anxious, this is his first time in therapy.}
<C>__{katie }
<D>__{dr. ross filled me in on your situation. tell me, how have you been feeling?}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{honestly. i feel fine.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{i think that's great considering what you're going through.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{yeah, but i tend to internalize everything so, who knows.}
<C>__{katie}
<A>__{you mean you repress as a coping mechanism.}
<C>__{adam}
<A>__{is that what i do?}
<C>__{katie}
<A>__{that's what you just said.}
<C>__{adam}
<A>__{the way i say it sounds cute in a neurotic way. when you say it, it's like an indictment. the word "repress" sounds so harsh.}
<C>__{katie}
<A>__{it's actually quite common.}
<C>__{adam}
<A>__{oh good, i'd hate to think i'm anything but an emotional sheep.}
<C>__{katie}
<A>__{don't think of it in those terms. it's not like it's been a conscious decision on your part. what's important now is for you to be aware of the way you treat your emotions and for me to help you make adjustments.}
<C>__{adam}
<A>__{so how do we do that?}
<C>__{katie}
<A>__{the first thing i want you to do is to stop looking at cancer as a burden. cancer has come into your life to show you that your emotional and physical bodies are out of balance. this is your chance to correct that.}
<C>__{adam}
<A>__{you're not in a cult are you?}
<C>__{katie}
<A>__{now, why do you say that?}
<C>__{adam}
<A>__{i don't know, it was a bad joke.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{but there's a reason. you chose to use humor rather than express how you really feel.}
<A>__{katie is losing adam.}
<C>__{katie }
<D>__{in order to heal the body, you must heal the mind. it's imperative that you free yourself from stress and anger. get rid of all those negative emotions stored deep inside.}
<A>__{adam's mind drifts away from katie. he focuses on all the clutter. the slanted clock. the wilting plant. the crumbled paper on the floor. the mess is driving him crazy.}
<C>__{katie }
<D>__{so today what i want to do is start you on some very simple relaxation therapy.}
<A>__{katie presses play on her ipod. we hear the soothing sounds of new agey flute music. adam looks up in confusion.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{i want you to lay back and close your eyes.}
<A>__{adam looks down at the coffee stained couch.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{lay here?}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{yes, i want you to just lay back, and let go.}
<C>__{adam}
<D>__{shouldn't we be analyzing my childhood? or my days as a call girl?}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{another joke?}
<C>__{adam}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{oh come on. nothing? that was funny.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{ssshhhhh...}
<A>__{katie stands behind adam and places her hands on his shoulders. despite the fact that this is all too strange, he doesn't mind, in a weird way, adam is enjoying the attention. he finally lies down, contorting his body so as to avoid the stain.}
<C>__{katie }
<D>__{close your eyes and relax. find a place inside yourself where you can escape the cancer.}
<A>__{adam closes his eyes.}
