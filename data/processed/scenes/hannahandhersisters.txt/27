<L>__{exterior manhattan street day}
<A>__{a contemporary red building, designed by david, is seen, squeezed in between two older buildings. holly, april, and david talk offscreen.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{wow, it's the red one?}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{oh, it's magnificent!}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{it's terrific!}
<A>__{the film moves down from the buildings to reveal the trio sitting in david's jaguar across the street. david and april sit in the front seat; holly sits scrunched up in back, her head slightly forward.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(gesturing, looking}
<D>__{back and forth from the buildings to}
<P>__{holly and april)}
<D>__{the design's deliberately noncontextural. but i wanted to... keep the atmosphere of the street, you know, and the proportions.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{and in the material. that's...that's unpolished red granite.}
<P>__{(pausing as he}
<D>__{watches holly and}
<P>__{april's reaction)}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{oh!}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{oh, is that what it is?}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(starting to speak)}
<D>__{uh }
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(interrupting, nodding at holly)}
<D>__{i i it has an o organic quality, you know.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(nodding, overlapping)}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(looking back at the building with reverence)}
<D>__{it's almost...almost, uhhh, entirely wholly interdependent, if you know what i mean. i i... i can't put it into words. the important thing is is is it it breathes.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(turning to april, emphatically)}
<D>__{you know, april, people pass by vital structures in this city all the time, and they never take the time to appreciate them. i get the feeling you tune in to your environment.}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(shaking her head)}
<D>__{oh }
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(interrupting, gesturing and nodding)}
<D>__{oh, it's really important.}
<A>__{david turns and briefly glances at holly; he then turns back to april.}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(looking only at david)}
<D>__{what are your favorite buildings, david?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{you want to see some?}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{oh, yeah.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{well, let's do it.}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(looking at david)}
<D>__{great.}
<A>__{david starts the car and the movie cuts to an unfolding visual excursion through new york city's landmark buildings, as seen from the trio's point of view in the moving jaguar. inspiring classical music plays in the background. the series of shots includes the dakota, complete with surrounding winter trees, the graybar building on lexington avenue, an incredibly ornate building on seventh avenue and fifty eighth street, a red stone church, an old building with embellished, bulging windows on west forty fourth street, the art deco chrysler building, a red brick building, abigail adams's old stone house, and the pomander walk nestled off broadway on the upper west side. the group can be seen walking down the path between the old fashioned row houses and shrubbery. a lamppost sits in the foreground. it is now dark. the music continues to play as the film cuts to the facade of a rococo style building, complete with french doors and ornate windows. the admiring group is heard offscreen.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{oh, it's just so romantic. i just want to put on a long gown...}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(offscreen, overlapping)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(offscreen, continuing)}
<D>__{...and open the french doors and go on the balcony }
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(offscreen, interrupting)}
<D>__{it's french, though. it really is.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(offscreen, overlapping)}
<D>__{it feels like you're in france.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(offscreen, overlapping)}
<D>__{it it is. it's romantic.}
<A>__{the music stops. the screen, which has been exploring the rococo building's facade, now shows the equally elegant building alongside it.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{and it's got a handsome partner sitting right beside it.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(offscreen, overlapping)}
<D>__{they fit right in together. and your eye goes along, lulled into complacency, and then...}
<A>__{the film moves from the two elegant facade to show an ugly, ultra modern structure covered with tiny, diamond shaped motifs.}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{that's just }
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(offscreen, interrupting)}
<D>__{look at this.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{that's disgusting!}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(offscreen, continuing)}
<D>__{...a monstrosity! who would do that?}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(offscreen, overlapping)}
<D>__{it's really terrible.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(offscreen, emphatically)}
<D>__{it's really sad.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{and it ruins everything else.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(offscreen, agreeing)}
<D>__{it does.}
<A>__{the film moves from the ugly facade to the building's equally ugly entrance. a large car is parked right in front of the building.}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(offscreen)}
<D>__{well...we have seen a lot of stuff today, though.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(offscreen, chuckling)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(offscreen, overlapping)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(offscreen, overlapping)}
<D>__{a lot of works.}
<A>__{the group is now seen walking down the canopied entrance stairs of an apartment house on the other side of the street, where they'd been gazing at both the lovely and ugly facades across the way. david is in the lead; the women follow, holly slightly behind april.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(glancing at his watch)}
<D>__{maybe we should start thinking about going home, huh?}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{fast.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{oh, geez, yeah.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(overlapped)}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{they walk towards the car.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(looking back at the}
<D>__{women as he walks around the car to the}
<P>__{driver's side)}
<D>__{uh, who gets dropped first?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{uh }
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(overlapping, looking at april)}
<D>__{oh, gee, i don't know. um...}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(offscreen, overlapping)}
<D>__{well...}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{well, i live downtown.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(glancing at april)}
<D>__{yeah, i, we both live downtown.}
<A>__{david leans over the roof of the car, looking at the women, waiting for their decision.}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{uh...}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(to david)}
<D>__{it depends on what way you want to go.}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{well, wait. you know what? i know.}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{uh...}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(to holly, gesturing)}
<D>__{if...well, if we took the, if we took fifth, then then then we'd get to your house first, yeah?}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(overlapping, nodding)}
<D>__{we could...we could do that.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{right. yeah, but fifth is so jammed, isn't it?}
<A>__{she looks at david.}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(overlapping, to holly)}
<D>__{well, sometimes, some, uh...}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{i mean, it's jammed. if we went... um...}
<A>__{both she and april mumble awkwardly.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(pointing to holly, interrupting their chatter)}
<D>__{y you live in chelsea, don't you?}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(nodding at david)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{well, i i guess if you live in chelsea, that's probably first.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(nodding nervously)}
<D>__{oh, okay.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{and then, uh, april...huh?}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(overlapping, nodding)}
<D>__{great.}
<A>__{they get into the car. once again holly's in the backseat. the classical music begins anew. the movie cuts briefly to cut to the traffic and lights of a manhattan avenue as seen from the moving jaguar. it then moves to a close up of holly, sitting in the backseat, her head near the window. she is staring straight ahead.}
<C>__{holly }
<D>__{naturally i get taken home first. well, obviously he prefers april. of course i was so tongue tied all night. i can't believe i said that about the guggenheim. my stupid little roller skating joke. i should never tell jokes. mom can tell 'em and hannah, but i kill 'em.}
<P>__{(glaring at the offscreen april's back)}
<D>__{where did april come up with that stuff about adolph loos and terms like "organic form"?}
<P>__{(looking out the side window, pausing for a moment)}
<D>__{well, naturally. she went to brandeis.}
<A>__{the movie cuts to holly's point of view: the front seat where david and april sit, the jaguar's windshield, and the passing lights and traffic of the street. holly continues her ruminations as april leans over to say something to david.}
<C>__{holly }
<D>__{but i don't think she knows what she's talking about. could you believe the way she was calling him david? "yes, david. i feel that way, too, david. what a marvelous space, david."}
<P>__{(emphatically)}
<D>__{i hate april. she's pushy.}
<A>__{the film moves back to holly in the backseat, still lost in thought.}
<C>__{holly }
<D>__{now they'll dump me and she'll invite him up. i blew it.}
<P>__{(sighing, looking out the side window)}
<D>__{and i really like him a lot. oh, screw it. i'm not gonna get all upset. i've got reading to do tonight. you know, maybe i will get into bed early. i will turn to a movie and take an extra seconal.}
<A>__{the classical music stops and some uptempo jazz begins. the screen cuts to black and a title appears.}
<D>__{"...nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands."}
