<A>__{the music takes us into the church and there we find nana, lovely in her wedding gown, and arthur, dashing in his morning suit, standing at the alter holding hands. both have tears in their eyes. arthur lifts her veil and gives her the sweetest kiss. angle on zoe and bobby in the first pew, passing a handkerchief back and forth.}
