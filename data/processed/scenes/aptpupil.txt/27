<L>__{interior dining room bowden house day}
<A>__{thanksgiving dinner. all the bowden's are there, including dick's parents, victor and agnes. dussander sits at the head of the table, todd next to him. the family has finished dinner and is having coffee. dick and his father smoke cigars. todd's mother, monica bowden, still pretty at 36, pours dussander some more coffee.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{todd loved that dog. a lot more than dick did.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{we all loved that dog.}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{i remember when you had to put it down, todd cried for two weeks. just about broke my heart.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{excuse, me, mrs. bowden. put it down? i've been here over twenty years but that's a new one.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{means put it to sleep, victor.}
<A>__{dussander still looks puzzled. he looks to todd, but victor jumps in.}
<C>__{victor }
<D>__{well, it's how they kill it, arthur. they do it all the time at the pound, ...sick dogs, dogs nobody wants.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{it's very humane.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{i see.}
<A>__{todd shoots him a fiery glare that the others don't notice.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{some more pie?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{as my departed wife used to say, 'one must never overdo the sublime.'}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{it was delicious, monica.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{tell me, arthur, if you don't mind me asking. what did you do during the war?}
<C>__{agnes}
<D>__{now don't get too personal, victor.}
<A>__{a quick moment between todd and dussander.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{i was a student at the university until my reserve unit was called in 1943.}
<P>__{(notices victor)}
<D>__{but we were not a combat unit, thank god. mechanical engineers. help me find my cigarettes, todd. would you? in those days, not even the call of higher learning could exempt an able body from military service.}
<A>__{dussander's cigarettes are right in front of him. todd fetches one and, bringing it to his own lips, lights it for him.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{todd bowden!}
<C>__{dussander}
<P>__{(laughs knowingly)}
<D>__{my dear, i do apologize. my hands are too arthritic to strike a match, i'm afraid. your son has been good enough to help an old man with his filthy habits.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{well...as long as you don't inhale.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{cigarettes are gross, mom.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{well, victor, you were doing your part like we all were, i suppose. of course, if you were in the pacific fleet i'd have to shoot you.}
<A>__{everyone laughs, except todd.}
<C>__{dick}
<P>__{(to dussander)}
<D>__{my dad is very proud of the fact that the bowden men have hit every major conflict since the civil war.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{that's right. dickie served two tours in vietnam. earned a bronze star and a purple heart.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{it's one family tradition i'd like to put an end to. todd and i blow a few caps down at the range every week. that's all the combat he needs.}
<C>__{todd}
<P>__{(perking up, offended)}
<D>__{what's that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{forget it.}
<C>__{dussander}
<P>__{(looking at todd)}
<D>__{perhaps your son would excel in combat.}
<C>__{monica}
<D>__{todd could excel at anything. right, honey?}
<A>__{todd doesn't answer. his eyes are still on dick. dick notices him.}
<C>__{agnes}
<P>__{(getting up, starts to clear some dishes)}
<D>__{oh, let's don't even talk about this. i can't stand to think of you boys fighting another war.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{the purple heart. you were injured?}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{he was knocked unconscious and woke up in a hospital.}
<A>__{a long pause. dick is embarrassed and offended by todd's stab. he puffs on his cigar. agnes comes in from the kitchen and picks up some more dishes. dick stands suddenly to help her.}
<C>__{dick}
<D>__{mom, let me get that for you.}
