<L>__{interior hospital room, new orleans morning, present}
<A>__{now we see we're in a hospital room with layers of white enamel paint trying without success to hide the years... an old woman, past 80, withered, still regal with a green turban around her bald head is propped by pillows, her blue eyes looking out at us from her bed... she's connected to an intravenous for sustenance and a morphine drip... her name, is daisy fuller. she speaks with a southern lilt.}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{if it wasn't for hurricanes we wouldn't have a hurricane season.}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{i've forgotten what the weather can be like here. i've lived with four seasons so many years now.}
<A>__{we see a young black woman, a "caregiver," dorothy baker, in a corner, thumbing a magazine, with one eye at the window...}
<C>__{dorothy baker}
<D>__{i saw on the news they're predicting trouble...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{1928 they stacked people like firewood to close a hole in a levee.}
<A>__{but daisy has other things on her mind... murmuring...}
<C>__{daisy }
<D>__{it all runs together... like a fingerpainting... i feel like i'm on a boat, drifting...}
<C>__{caroline}
<P>__{(tenderly)}
<D>__{can i do anything for you, mother? make anything easier?}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{hmmm. there is nothing to do, caroline. this is what it is... i'm finding it harder to keep my eyes open... my mouth all filled with cotton...}
<A>__{and agitated, feeling confined, she scratches at her nightgown as if it were sticking to her... she starts to take it off... dorothy gets up and straightens it for her.}
<C>__{dorothy baker}
<D>__{there, there, miss daisy... you'll scratch yourself to ribbons...}
<P>__{(to caroline)}
<D>__{it's their way of letting go...}
<P>__{(the finality)}
<D>__{...prob'ly today.}
<A>__{caroline is well aware of it, but the words, her admonition of death being so close at hand, makes everything even more present...}
<C>__{caroline}
<D>__{do you want more medication, mother? the doctor said you can have all you want.}
<A>__{daisy is quiet, looking into the distance. caroline, seeking closure, sits on the bed with her and starts to cry. daisy puts her thin arms around her daughter, comforting her.}
<C>__{caroline }
<D>__{a friend told me she never had a chance to say goodbye to her mother.}
<P>__{(grateful to have the chance)}
<D>__{i wanted to thank you, mother, for bringing me into this world. for raising me so well.}
<C>__{caroline }
<D>__{i wanted to tell you how much you've meant to me. i'm going to miss you so much...}
<A>__{they hold each other for some time... they separate... and there's an awkwardness they have nothing left to talk about... nothing left to say to each other... a hole in their relationship... caroline fills it with the eternal question...}
<C>__{caroline }
<D>__{are you afraid?}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{curious. what comes nexterior..}
<A>__{she winces at some physical pain.}
<C>__{dorothy baker}
<D>__{the pain's coming more steadily... her breathing will falter soon... no need for her to suffer..}
<A>__{she raises the morphine level... daisy closes her eyes... drifting with the morphine... and a thought, a dream, a sound, crosses her mind... and she says...}
<C>__{daisy}
<D>__{they built that train station in 1918. your father was there the day it opened... he said a tuba band was playing...oom pah pah...}
