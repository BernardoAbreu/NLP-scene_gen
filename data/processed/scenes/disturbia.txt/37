<D>__{yes! that's what i'm talking about!}
<A>__{he gazes over: ashley's parents, each with a moving box, stand there, jaws dropped. both take a nervous step backward as ashley steps out the front door. freezes at the sight of the sopping wet, shit and grass stained kale. kale locks eyes with her. then smiles and waves.}
<C>__{kale }
<D>__{it's cool, i'm all green.}
<A>__{then sirens wail. kale turns to the street: two police cars screech to a stop. kale loses the smile.}
