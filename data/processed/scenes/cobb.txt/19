<D>__{i confess i was looking forward to seeing cobb and being near his brilliance. my own life seemed on hold, somehow. everyday churning out the same old articles, drinking at 4 in the afternoon with the same old guys, the same old excuses for not writing a novel, the same old confused marriages that we all needed and were trying to get out of at the same time... cobb was a god whose brilliance, however difficult, could rub off on me. his problems were different than mine...}
