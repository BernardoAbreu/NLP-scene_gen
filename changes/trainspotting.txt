The opposition all wear an identical strip (Arsenal), whereas Renton and his friends wear an odd assortment of gear. Three girls -- Lizzy, Gail, and Allison and Baby -- stand by the side, watching. The boys are outclassed by the team with the strip but play much dirtier. As each performs a characteristic bit of play, the play freezes and their name is visible, printed or written on some item of clothing. (T-Shirt, baseball cap, shorts, trainers). In Begbie's case, his name appears as a tatoo on his arm. Sick Boy commits a sneaky foul and indignantly denies it. Begbie commits an obvious foul and make no effort to deny it. Spud, in goal, lets the ball in between his legs. Tommy kicks the ball as hard as he can. Renton's litany continues over the action:}

Well, you know me, I'm no looking for trouble but at the end of the day I'm the cunt with the pool cue and I'm game for a swedge. So I squared up, casual like.
