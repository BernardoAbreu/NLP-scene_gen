<A>__{ day formed by two dancers bending over backwards, awash in pink light and spotlighted in white. walter and annie are among a few other people couples mostly looking in the windows. each one a variation on the heart motif. they move to a window "broken heart" burnished metal, with tow cherubs flying out of the wound in the middle. on walter and annie's reflection in the broken heart window. they're both in their own worlds. then they both start to speak at once. they stop. annie looks at walter.}
