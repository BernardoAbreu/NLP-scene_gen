<B>__{close shot sidewalk}
<A>__{an iron grill blocks the street entrance to the building and loan. it has been locked. a crowd of men and women are waiting around the grill. they are simply dressed people, to whom their savings are a matter of life and death. george comes in with an assumed cheerful manner. the people look at him silently, half shamefaced, but grimly determined on their rights. in their hearts there is panic and fear.}

<D>__{hello, everybody. mrs. thompson, how are you? charlie? what's the matter here, can't you get in?}
<A>__{no one answers. he quickly unlocks the grill door and pushes it open. followed by the crowd, george runs upstairs and into the outer offices of the building and loan.}
