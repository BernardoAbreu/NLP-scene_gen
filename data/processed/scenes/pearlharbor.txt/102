<L>__{exterior oahu road night}
<A>__{danny has pulled his buick convertible off the road; rafe is bent over, his head out of frame; he's throwing up. danny's banged up from the fight and still drunk himself; he waits beside rafe, who chokes out between heaves }
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{how come you're not pukin'?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{i guess i'm used to it. i've felt like throwing up every minute since you got back.}
<A>__{rafe straightens up, but the waves of sickness come back over him and he bends over again. danny looks at his friend, and the pain is written on danny's face.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{don't blame her, rafe. it's not like you're thinking.}
<C>__{rafe}
<P>__{(between heaves)}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{she loves you. i know that. and part of what she loves in me is how much of you she sees in me.}
<A>__{rafe doesn't seem to be listening; but danny knows he is.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{we were both torn up. i started dropping by to see her, because we understood what each other felt. we'd have coffee and try not to talk about you, but we always would.}
<A>__{rafe stands to face danny; this is hard for danny to say.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{she said i was so much like you. i said, no, i'm not. i'm like i am because of you, but i'm not you, not as good as you. everybody else saw me as a loser with a big chip on his shoulder. but you saw the better part of me, the part of me that could be like you, and changed me. you made me who i am.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{how sweet. is that when you put the move on her?}
<A>__{danny slams his fist into rafe's sick gut. rafe doubles over again, coughing, nothing left in his belly to come up. rafe stand slowly, nodding as if he knows the punch was what he deserved. danny's about to apologize when once more rafe knees him in the balls. danny folds up, drops to his knees, and starts to retch.}
<C>__{rafe}
<D>__{that's better.}
<A>__{rafe crawls into the back seat of the car and passes out, danny still collapsed at the side of the road.}
