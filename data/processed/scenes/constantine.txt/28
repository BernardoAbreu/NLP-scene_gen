<A>__{evening leagues are going strong. john walks in, looks totally out of place. he moves down the ball rack area, runs his fingers across the various leftovers, finally stops at a pearl white dazzler. he lifts it from the rack, steps out into the prep area in front of one of the few lanes not in use. number 13. john snatches a grease pencil from the overhead, scribbles right on the ball "provisions depleted." he fluffs his trench coat back, steps onto the polished wood with his well traveled oxfords. young bowlers on both sides stop to look at this oddity. an attractive brunette is rather curious. john gives her a wink. her boyfriend doesn't appreciate it. john bowls. perfect hook ball. strike! brunette grins. john returns the smile, heads into the hallway by the pool tables.}
