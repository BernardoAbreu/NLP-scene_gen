<A>__{harvey pushes a cart through the cramped aisles of a crowded supermarket. he pulls a few cans of beef a roni off the shelf and heads off to pay. reaching the check out area, he evaluates the situation. angle on check out counters: there are three lines to choose from. two of the counters have long waits. the third is much shorter but there is an old jewish lady next in line. suddenly, the screen splits in two: the left side of the frame remains harvey at the supermarket deliberating over the check out lines. however, the right side of the frame now contains a crumb}
<B>__{style comic panel depicting the exact same scenario. a bubble}
<A>__{appears over cartoon harvey's head revealing his thoughts. it reads: "pickin' the right check out line is an art... there's a lot of things you gotta consider." on the left side of the frame... harvey decides to get behind the old lady. meanwhile on the right hand side of the frame... cartoon harvey stands behind the old lady. a new bubble reads: "it may be the shortest line but i am takin' a chance 'cause she's an old jewish lady." back to the left side of the frame... the cashier rings up the old lady's purchases a few kitchen glasses.}
