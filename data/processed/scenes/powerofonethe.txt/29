<D>__{i came to after being unconscious for two days, the rock missing my eye by half an inch. after a week in hospital it was decided i'd be sent to my grandfather's house in the english town of barberton, at least until passions at school cooled. jaapie botha was expelled; sent home to his family's farm in disgrace.}

<D>__{and so the first recorded south african casualty of hitler's insanity was not a boer, nor a rooinek, but a tatter feathered, half bald kaffir chicken.}
<A>__{pk finishes. the end of class bell rings. offstage, other classrooms are exiting into the common hall, but no one in st. john's study moves. st. john takes his glasses off and wipes the lenses deliberately. after a long moment he turns to face the class.}
<C>__{st. john}
<D>__{very evocative, yes. particularly the image of the chicken. good choice there.}
<A>__{st. john rises, lecturing.}
<C>__{st. john}
<D>__{any ideology that needs to attack the thing that least threatens it is an ideology that will not outlive its own generation. inclusion, gentlemen, not exclusion, is the key to survival.}

<C>__{pk}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{st. john}
