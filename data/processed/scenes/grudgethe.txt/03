<A>__{a blur of movement as hundreds of people stream up from a subway tunnel. most are japanese. we're not in kansas. standing in the middle of the rush hour pedestrian traffic is karen (20s, american). she faces upstream, looking for someone. the flow threatens to carry her away in a heartbeat. she looks fragile, intimidated by the madness.}

<D>__{karen!}
<A>__{she turns to see her boyfriend doug (20s, american) approaching. with a reassuring smile he takes her hand and together, they force their way through the throng, trying to escape the flow. they're jostled and crushed by the crowd, and doug protectively pulls karen closer.}

<D>__{maybe we should find a different train station.}
<A>__{he abruptly stops, right in the middle of traffic, still holding karen's hand. she turns, wondering what's going on. she sees the smile on his lips a moment before he sweeps karen into his arms and kisses her. as if the crowd of businessmen surging around them isn't there at all. it's tender and loving, and she responds... at first. but then she pulls away, shy.}

<D>__{a public display of affection is considered rude in japan.}
<A>__{there's an opening ahead into a side street. doug and karen deftly slip out of the traffic }
