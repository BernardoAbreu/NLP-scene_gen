<A>__{hearing a loud smash, fred looks up and sees fred's pov a wrecking ball operator a burly and rough looking guy named piltdown, he grins in side his dino topping cupola, winds his winch handles and then propels his wrecking ball towards the... quarry wall above where the huge stone ball smashes into some walnuts balanced on a boulder.}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{piltdown's compact buddy pyrite cackles, sweeps up the walnuts. munching them, he balances a new one in place. (it should be noted here that the relationship and physi cal appearances of piltdown and pyrite mirrors that of our heroes... they're sort of an anti fred and barney.)}
<C>__{pyrite}
<D>__{way ta go, pilty baby. five bucks says you can't hit one on the fly.}
<C>__{piltdown}

<A>__{workers near fred duck as dust and debris fall down. people grab for their construction helmets.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{not again...}
<A>__{fred hustles up a ladder to a ramp which leads him up to the level of piltdown's cab. barney hurries to follow.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{all right, piltdown, that's enough! you're endangering your fellow workers!}
<C>__{piltdown}

<P>__{(a nasty grin)}
<D>__{... i'm breakin' some snacks.}
<A>__{he swings the wrecking ball again.}
<B>__{up above}
<A>__{this time he's overdone it: the wrecking ball flies past the walnuts pyrite ducks for cover and then the wrecking ball whips over and around the handrail which runs along here, twisting as tightly as indiana jones' whip. the handrail wobbles dangerously in its foundation piltdown's dino snorts, backs up the crane supports on its back begin to creak and groan with the strain }
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{workers scatter, fearful of the imminent collapse. fred runs to grab the dino's reins.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{whoa, whoa, big fella }
<A>__{he calms the beast by giving it a carrot. as it munches, fred quickly ties the reins to a post.}
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(calling up to the cab)}
<D>__{you're on report, piltdown! if it's up to me you'll be pushing a wheelbarrow!}

<P>__{(sotto, very sincere)}
<D>__{ barney, hold me back }
<A>__{quickly the men form a circle around piltdown and fred. barney looks up and sees the crane on the dino's back it is shuddering and threatening to come crashing down.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{hey, maybe you guys oughta fix that first.}
<C>__{piltdown}
<D>__{why should we?}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{it looks dangerous. besides, you can kick fred's fat butt anytime.}
<C>__{fred}
<D>__{yeah. that's right.}
<P>__{(realizing, a glare at barney)}
<D>__{i mean this ain't over, piltdown.}
<P>__{(turning, shouting)}
<D>__{come on, guys. let's clean up the mess.}
