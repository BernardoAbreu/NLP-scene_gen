<A>__{leonard stares at jody for a moment, relaxing his grip, giving kenny just the break he needs to dive for leonard's arm, surprising him, knocking him over. they struggle for the razor but leonard overpowers him and grabs it, cutting his own hand. he turns and slices kenny down the side, cutting him deep. kenny fights off the pain and leaps on leonard's back, grabbing his arm around the neck. leonard stands up and twirls around, trying to knock kenny off his back, smashing him into walls. kenny screams in pain, but doesn't let go, pulling at leonard's face and throat. leonard spins faster. jody struggles to her feet, holding her neck, still losing a little blood. kenny's grips start to slip as leonard reaches back, to slice him across the face and neck. leonard, backs up towards the window, slips over a dildo. he screams, loses his grip on kenny, goes crashing out the second story window.}
