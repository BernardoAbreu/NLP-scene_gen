<L>__{interior harrah's, clifton's dressing room night}
<A>__{and inside, taking off the rubber tony makeup, is zmuda. george starts hyperventilating. shaking, he tries to sit himself down. andy enters, beaming. george is amazed.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{you're so proud. you're like some retarded kid comin' home from school: "look, dad, i got an f!"}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{but wasn't it funny?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{"funny"? i dunno. but "intriguing"... "mindboggling"... perhaps "headache inducing"... sure.}
<P>__{(softening)}
<D>__{like, that moment, when you both came onstage...}
<A>__{andy excitedly jumps up and down.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{uh huh! see, with all these articles, people think they're insiders. they see tony clifton, and they say, "ah, that's really andy kaufman." but that spoils it. so now, tony denying being me is the truth! tony's not me! but maybe he is! the audience will never know...}
<P>__{(giddy)}
<D>__{they'll think they're laughin' at me but actually i will be laughin' at them, because they're wrong and i'm right!}
<A>__{george is dazed.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{so you've got this big elaborate joke, which is really only funny to two people in the universe.}
<P>__{(dry)}
<D>__{you... and you.}
<C>__{zmuda}
<D>__{sure! but we think it's kickass! now i get to be tony. i get to dump the glass of water on someone else's head!}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(he turns serious)}
<D>__{but what's the point? how will any of this make you the biggest star in the world?}
<A>__{hmm. andy contemplates this.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{george... i'm at a stage where the audience expects me to constantly shock them. but short of faking my death, or setting the theater on fire, i don't know what else to do.}
<P>__{(thoughtful)}
<D>__{'cause i've always got to be one step ahead of them.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{but i feel you're extending this philosophy to real life. it's obsessive. nothing's ever on the level anymore.}
<A>__{a perplexed beat.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{george, it never was.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{didn't you know that?}
