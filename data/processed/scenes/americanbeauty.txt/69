<A>__{ricky's pov, on video: through a window on the side of the burnham's garage, we see lester step out of his pants and briefs. then, naked except for his black socks, he grabs the dumbbells and starts lifting them, watching his reflection in the window as he does.}

<D>__{welcome to america's weirdest home videos.}
<A>__{suddenly we hear someone trying to open a locked door.}
<C>__{colonel }
<D>__{ricky!}
<A>__{moving swiftly, ricky pulls the drapes shut and switches on a light. his room is a haven of high tech. a state of the art multimedia computer crowds his desk, and high end stereo and video equipment line the shelves, as well as hundreds of cds. there is easily twenty thousand dollars worth of equipment in this room.}

<D>__{coming, dad.}
<C>__{colonel }
<D>__{you know i don't like locked doors in my house, boy.}
<A>__{ricky opens the door. the colonel stands outside, eyeing him.}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i must have locked it by accident. so what's up?}
<A>__{the colonel holds out a small plastic cup with a cap.}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{i need a urine sample.}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{wow. it's been six months already. can i give it to you in the morning? i just took a whiz.}
<C>__{colonel}
<D>__{yeah, i suppose.}
<P>__{(an awkward beat)}
<D>__{well. good night, son.}
<A>__{he disappears down the hall. ricky smiles, shuts and locks his door. he puts the plastic cup on the shelf, then crosses to a mini refrigerator in the corner of his room and takes out a cup sized tupperware container from the freezer, already filled with urine, albeit frozen, and places it on a saucer to thaw overnight.}
