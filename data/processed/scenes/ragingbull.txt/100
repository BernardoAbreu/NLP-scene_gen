<L>__{interior metropole night (1958)}
<A>__{the metropole is a club on 7th avenue off times square. jake lamotta, 36 years old and wearing a hip fifties suit, continues his monologue.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{except here, gentlemen, with you bums. i call you "gentlemen"... but you know what you really are! you know, this place used to be pretty exclusive... now they got bouncers outside to throw the drunks in! my first night here i said to the boss, "where's the toilet?" he said, "you're in it!" by the way, this engagement is just a stepping stone for me. if i do good here, i'm ready to get out of the business!}
<A>__{the crowd starts to shout: "get the fuck off the stage!"}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{ok, ok, i know what you're waitin' for and from the looks of you, you been waitin' for it for a long time. i had my own joint in miami beach once... it was too high class for you guys... we had a 50 cent minimum charge just to keep out the riff raff!}
<A>__{the crowd continues to shout, as before, also shouting: "bring out the girls!"}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{hey, sorry. here's your girls.}
<P>__{(grabs his crotch)}
<D>__{yeah, she's here... just like it's advertised out front. she's come back. a girl who's seen the lower depths... who's been as far as i have in that direction. she's on her way back up now... give you an idea how low she was! let's give her a warm welcome... make her glad she's back, boys. miss emma 48's!}
<A>__{jake gets off the stage as miss emma 48's goes into her dance. he goes over to the bar and gets a drink. several older men in t shirts a disreputable looking lot are at the bar.}
