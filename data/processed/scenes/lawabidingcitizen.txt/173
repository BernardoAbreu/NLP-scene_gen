<L>__{exterior city hall courtyard day}
<A>__{people going about their business. nick exits, dazed, comes down the steps. he sits on a step, vacant a man completely at a loss and out of options. his cell rings. he rouses himself, flips it open.}
<C>__{clyde }
<D>__{hey. some legal team from the mayor showed up here this morning. i hear you're off the case. told you they'd scapegoat you, didn't i?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{nick? you there?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{how'd you kill jonas? i know about the second explosion, i saw the contrail, so i know you got somebody working for you. but the first explosion how?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{say you find a guy with a bad cocaine problem. hungry ex wives. greedy mistress. heavy gambling debts.}
<A>__{...a bizarre sound occurs on the line an unidentifiable shrieking sound that grows and rapidly dissipates...}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{say that guy's a veterinarian. you hand him a million in cash, he'll do what you ask. especially if he's looking to blow town for good...}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(can't believe it)}
<D>__{it was...inside the dog?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{you own the vet, you own the dog. explosive wasn't even that big. stuff i use, it didn't have to be.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{hidden in plain sight. that's my specialty. haven't you figured that out yet?}
<A>__{nick sighs, rubs his eyes, can barely even speak.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{what's next for you? mulling career options? i suppose law is out.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i'm trying to get over my friend being dead. aside from that, fuck you.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{fair enough.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i will miss you nick. it was a good dance.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{didn't bring your family back, though, did it?}
<P>__{(off clyde's silence)}
<D>__{has it made you feel better? all this? you done making your point?}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{just warming up. this is clausewitz shit, my friend. total war.}
<A>__{camera pushing in on nick, listening, as:}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{i'm gonna pull the whole thing down. i will topple the gleaming pillars and drag the whole fucking diseased, corrupt temple down on my head.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{stay tuned. it'll be biblical.}
<A>__{click line goes dead. nick sits staring at the phone... blue 9 19 08}
