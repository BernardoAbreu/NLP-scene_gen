<C>__{ongewasgone}
<D>__{john cameron, thank you for your hospitality ... twin river mohawk got no quarrel with les francais. trade furs with les francais. now les francais bring huron onto mohawk hunting grounds ...}
<A>__{these people are english, scots irish and dutch farmers; some french huguenot "mechanics" (craftsmen). they're in shirt sleeves and indian moccasins & leggings. the mohawks' vast lands and corn agriculture border the settlement. they 've been acculturated for over a hundred years. some wear european calico hunting shirts. their heads are shaved to scalping locks and many are tattooed. they've politically and commercially played france & england against each other very adroitly for over a hundred years because of their military power and geographic position. their relations with working farmers and settlers and their families has been mostly one of co existence because there's always been more than enough for all. this is a wpa mural of ethnic diversity and plurality of frontier america. the europeans are former indentured laborers, farmers exiled by economics or religious persecution, frontier hunters and trappers ... working people.}

<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{it should be enough to remind you france is the enemy.}
<C>__{hawkeye}
<D>__{your enemy ...}
<A>__{heads turn to hawkeye at the periphery of the crowd.}
<C>__{lieutenant}
<D>__{what did you say?}
<C>__{hawkeye}
<P>__{(loud)}

<C>__{hawkeye}
<D>__{first place, you started it with the french over fur trapping claims to the head waters of the ohio.}

<C>__{lieutenant}
<P>__{(ignoring hawkeye)}
<D>__{will you men help us stop the french?}
