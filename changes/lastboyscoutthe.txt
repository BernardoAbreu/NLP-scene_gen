Turf and snow. Erupting. A firecracker series of POPS as linemen collide. Legs churning. The ball floats through the snowy air. Pitch-out to Cole. He takes it on the run. Tucks it under his arm.

Cole does not blink. He reaches beneath his jersey. Pulls out a GUN. Pumps THREE SHOTS into the free safety's head. The bullets go straight through. On the back of his helmet. A mixture of blood and fiberglass. Cole keeps going, jogging for the end zone. Around him, sound. Fury. Impact. Confusion. Another defensive back. Straight ahead. Reacts with almost comical terror. Dives to one side. Cole FIRES. Blows out the guy's knee. Ends a career. Keeps going. We are now in full-scale panic. The players are fleeing the field. Shouts. Pandemonium.
