<D>__{good night, theo.}
<A>__{nell shuts the door. theo is about to close her door, but hesitates. she puts on the light and goes to the tub. she turns it on, waits. just the sound of the water. and no bumping.}
<L>__{interior nell's room night}
<A>__{nell lies asleep under her sheet, the blankets off the end of the bed. hovering over her, on the headboard, the carved faces of children, peering down. flap. flap flap. the fan light at the top of the window right next to the bed is open a crack. the sheer curtains flap listlessly in a gentle breeze. the flapping grows louder, and with a sudden gust the curtain billows out. in its flowing form, we sense the shape of a girl's face, fleeting, so insubstantial we know we just saw her, but maybe our eyes are playing tricks on us. the curtain blows straight out, touching the bedposts at the foot of the bed, and there the wind catches the fabric hanging from them. the wind seem to sneak under the bedcover and the shape follows... nell sleeps, oblivious, the wind filling the room, stirring the tinkling crystal beads on the candelabra. the shape of the little girl's face now travels underneath the bedsheets toward the pillows, toward nell. nell turns, restless, the air catches the edge of the pillowcase, and travels towards nell's face. and for a split second there is a lifelike impression of a small girl's face. nell almost awakens. the crystal beads stir, and in their tinkling, in the sigh of wind, we hear:}
<C>__{girl voice}
<A>__{find us, find us eleanor. nell's eyes open. and like that, the pillowcase deflates, the air rushes up the curtain to the window, and is gone. nell sits up, looks about her. everything seems normal. just her sheets, just the curtains, but on the headboard remain the carved faces. benevolent. nell settles back down on her pillow with a sense of peace.}
