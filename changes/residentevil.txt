This is CHRIS REDFIELD, young, handsome. More than simply an outdoor type, he seems perfectly in place, almost part of the environment. A band of purple tints the horizon, outlining the tops of magnificent uncorrupted hills that extend for miles. Sitting on a ridge, squinting into that band of light, Chris sees ... ...AN EAGLE coasting on a channel of wind that cuts through the hilltops. As the bird moves swiftly closer, it becomes recognizable. Chris smiles and jots a note on a pad. The regal bird lands on a high rock where ...unexpectedly... a freshwater trout lies flapping, three-thousand feet above the highest water.}

Over his shoulder, we can see the high rock that holds the fish. It's out of focus in the background, but the moonlight catches SOMETHING MOVING there. Something that lets out a sharp INHUMAN SOUND.

Its eyes dilate, like camera shutters, with a CLI-CLICK. It strides forward at top peed, PITCHING DESKS easily aside, SMASHING through a CONSOLE as if it were made of balsa.

As the doors glide shut, the monster holds the remainder of Wesker's body inside their path.
