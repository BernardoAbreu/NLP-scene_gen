<L>__{exterior devil's cauldron day}
<A>__{sunday morning. chimney smoke rises straight up in the still morning air and mingles with the wisps of fog hanging above the devil's cauldron valley. a scratchy recording of a hymn ("we will gather at the river") plays through a pa system, echoing forlornly off the hills. the people of devil's cauldron walk through the new snow to the center of the settlement. some, older women mostly, head for the dance hall, where the hymn originates.}
