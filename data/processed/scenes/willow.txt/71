<L>__{interior sorsha's tent dawn}
<A>__{crouched inside the large tent, madmartigan calculates his next move. in the far corner, sorsha lies asleep. he steals the baby from a crib of straw. starts to leave. but stops. willow pokes his head inside.}
<C>__{willow}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{come on, madmartigan...!}
<A>__{madmartigan stares over at sorsha. lured by her beau ty, he slowly walks toward her bed.}
<C>__{willow}
<D>__{what are you doing? get out of there...!}
<A>__{madmartigan looks down at her. morning rushlight il luminates her youthful face, and her long red hair is spread across her pillow. out of her armor, in soft nightclothes, she looks like a goddess. upon her breast is a golden necklet, inlaid with ornate jewels. quietly:}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{i love you.}
<A>__{he kisses her lips. her eyes open.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{one move, and you really will be a woman.}
<A>__{holding the baby, madmartigan does not move a muscle. sorsha holds a knife at his crotch.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{you're a fool. now put her back.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{i'm not going to let this baby die.}
<A>__{sorsha presses the knife.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{don't make me kill you.}
<A>__{willow watches as madmartigna carefully backs away from sorsha.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{i believe you would...}
<A>__{sitting up, sorsha waves her knife. madmartigan places the baby in the straw crib.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{why did you say that?}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{say what?}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{i love you.}
<A>__{madmartigan walks back to sorsha' bed. willow crawls into the tent, behind madmartigan's back.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{because it's true.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{i don't believe you.}
<A>__{sorsha defensively kneels on her bed as madmartigan walks toward her. he shows no fear of her knife, com pelled instead by honest passion. for once, he isn't conning anybody. his feelings are genuine.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{i wish it weren't true. i swore i'd never let this happen. i hate you. i hate your beauty, i hate your innocence, i hate the feelings you've awakened in me.}
<A>__{the knife trembles in sorsha's hand.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{i'm in love with you, sorsha. i don't want to be, but a power has enchanted me and i stand helpless against it. it's torture. battle field or prison cell was never half as cruel.}
<A>__{he kneels onto her bed. her hand falls, her knife falls to the floor, her chest heaves with fear and emo tion.}
<C>__{madmartigan}
<D>__{i want you and i can't have you so i want you all the more. if this were another time and another place i'd }
<A>__{he stops. he looks into her eyes. willow dashes out of the tent with the baby.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{you'd what?}
<A>__{madmartigan takes sorsha in his arms and kisses her. her trembling body surrenders to him. until: they hear a scream outside the tent. it all happens quickly. kael rips open the canvas and catches them in their embrace. in one hand he holds the baby. in the other hand: willow.}
<C>__{kael}
<D>__{what's going on here!!}
<A>__{sorsha sees the baby, sees the empty crib, and smashes madmartigan hard across the face.}
<C>__{sorsha}
<D>__{deceiver!!}
<A>__{kael hurls willow across the tent and tosses the baby in the straw. growling horribly he lunges at madmarti gan. madmartigan rolls away and sees sorsha's sword nearby. grabs it. as kael draws his sword, madmarti gan artfully slices away the center pole, and the en tie tent collapses.}
