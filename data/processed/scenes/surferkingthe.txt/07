<D>__{i can swim. why?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{well, you look old enough to be a guard.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{almost 16. i get my license in september.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{it's just that most of the guys on grounds are a little younger than you. most guys your age that can swim are guards.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{well, i just moved here. i guess i missed guard tryouts. you're a guard then?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{oh, no no no. i work concessions...at aokee's surf and snack shack. it's just as well. the guards are mostly stuck up anyway. the rest of us are the ones who know how to have fun.}

<D>__{oh, alex. am i going to have to put up with your crap for another entire summer?}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(looking upward toward the sky)}
<D>__{dear melissa. there's nothing about our relationship that couldn't be fixed by us spending a few moments together in the pumphouse behind thunder bay.}
<C>__{melissa}
