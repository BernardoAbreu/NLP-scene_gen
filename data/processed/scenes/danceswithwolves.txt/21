<L>__{interior fort hays headquarters day}
<A>__{silhouetted against the outside, lieutenant dunbar pauses in the wide doorway of headquarters. we can hear the distant sounds of work and life coming from the outside but in here it's strangely quiet. a sergeant sits at a desk in the foyer. across the way, at another desk, is an enlisted clerk. both men glance from their paperwork at the man in the doorway. but it's only a glance and they go right on shuffling paper. footfalls sound in a hallway and a blue eyed officer with slick, black hair swings into the foyer. he too has a slackness that echoes the dreariness of this post. the blue eyed officer, lieutenant elgin, and dunbar meet at the doorway. dunbar glances down at a scrap of paper in his hand.}
