<A>__{two guards are looking down at big mike below. one guard begins motioning as if guiding a crane into place. the other guard has his hand poised on a large switch lever. guard one is gesturing more emphatically now, closing his hands to indicate "almost there". he closes his hands, and guard two pulls the lever.}

<D>__{yeah. this is great. i love this plan. drag me kicking and screaming from my happy home in california to some weird place in colorado, and say hey, this'll be fun robbie. maybe we can go camping....}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{look, i know you're not happy about this. but it wasn't my idea for your father to have some kind of mid life crisis and disappear with his secretary to mexico with our life savings.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{"administrative assistant." there's no such thing as a secretary anymore.}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{fine. administrative assistant. we couldn't afford to sit around waiting any longer to see if he was coming back. i was able to land a good job here. and now thanks to uncle bernie you have this job at the water park...}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{grounds crew. what kind of job is that? it sound like the guy who cleans out the coffee pots.}
<C>__{connie}
<D>__{bernie says you help keep the park clean, sweep up, that sort of thing. i'm sure it won't be so bad. besides, a lot of the kids who work at this park go to the same high school you'll be going to. you can start the school year with some ready made friends.}
