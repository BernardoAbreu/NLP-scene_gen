<L>__{interior stairway night}
<A>__{frank begins climbing the stairs. when he has gone a quarter of the way up, rachel appears at the top and begins walking down. at first she doesn't see frank; when she does she hesitates a moment, then continues down. they meet and try to sidestep each other, but twice they go in the same direction, unable to get around. rachel, already emotionally ravaged, cracks. she begins slapping frank hard about the face and torso. one of the first blows knocks the glass from his hand; it smashes loudly against the wall. he raises his arms in a half hearted attempt to protect himself from the onslaught. she cries as she hits him.}

<P>__{(hysterical)}
<D>__{you, you, you... you brought this pain into my house... now you're here! where were you then? why didn't you save her? it was your job to protect me and she died doing it... it was me they were after. and you let them kill her!}
<P>__{(she gasps for air)}
<D>__{she never did anything to anyone.}
<A>__{as she loses the strength and the will to hit him, her blows become sloppy, weak. she sinks to the steps, sitting on them, sobbing.}
<C>__{rachel}
<D>__{she never hurt anyone. she was good.}
<P>__{(she looks at him; entreats him)}
<D>__{you saw her. she never wished anyone any harm. did she? did she?}
<A>__{frank looks at her, shakes his head "no." rachel puts her head in her hands and is silent for a few moments; her crying slows.}
<C>__{rachel}
<P>__{(finally, quietly)}
<D>__{she never hurt a soul.}
<P>__{(long pause)}
<D>__{... i didn't love her well enough. i didn't take care of her...}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{... she gave me only love.}
<A>__{she sits quietly on the steps in the gloom. frank watches for a long moment, then softly continues on his way.}
