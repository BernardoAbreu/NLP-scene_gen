<A>__{indy looks into a deep pit around which concentric paths leads off into numerous narrow tunnels. crawling out of these burrows, scrawny children drag sacks of dirt and rock. other hollow eyed children pull these sacks to mine cars waiting on rails. straining to lift the rocks into the mine cars, several of the children slip and fall. bare chested thuggee guards shout at the enslaves children and kick those who've fallen. for these children there would seem to be only one hope death an end to their travail. indiana edges around the hole, looking into the ghastly mine and feeling as if he's discovered an inferno of misery as grotesque as dante's. indy shifts the bag of stones on his shoulder. he hesitates and considers his choice: he has the sankara stones and can leave with them now... but indy hears the pleading cries of one child and peers down to see a burly thuggee guard beating the pitiful little slave. indy gets angrier and angrier as he watches. he finally steps over the grabs a boulder. he lifts it and flings it down into the mine }
