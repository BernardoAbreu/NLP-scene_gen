<A>__{kate looks on, as harvey dances happily with his daughter. feeling something, she turns to find the eight year old's head slumped against her shoulder as he sleeps soundly. kate smiles at her lot. back on the dance floor, harvey encourages brian to take over the dance with susan. harvey turns away and is joined by uncle fred and gang. they all chat animatedly. uncle fred pushes harvey into a dance with his wife. a `boogie' strikes up. kate looks on as harvey dances and reunites with his extended family. she sees the delight in his face. she looks around at all the happy faces. it's time perhaps to let the family celebrate alone. extricating herself from the sleeping boy, she pushes two chairs together and makes a bed for him. covering him in a jacket, she glances back at the dance floor before turning to leave. back on the dance floor, a `boogie' is in full swing. harvey caught up in the fun, energetically swings aunt maddie around. he suddenly catches himself and turns to his table to look for kate, but finds it empty save for a row of dozing children. harvey makes his excuses and turns away, looking for kate amongst the crowded room.}
