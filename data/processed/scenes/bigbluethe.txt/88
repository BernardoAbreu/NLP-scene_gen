<L>__{interior boat day later}
<A>__{on the boat, novelli checks his watch. jacques comes out of his room. he's dressed to dive. he ignores everyone as he goes down the ladder to the diving platform. he seems to be in another world. all sounds coming to him are drowned out.}
<L>__{exterior diving platform day}
<A>__{jacques sits in the diver's slot. opens his eyes slowly and looks around. he puts his flippers on, an assistant stands at his side.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{the figures on the platform are vague, the voices are garbled and incomprehensible. moving almost in slow motion he raises three fingers.}
<C>__{technician}
<D>__{tre minuti!}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{ten other divers have waited for this signal to dive. they disappear one by one into the blue. jacques uses contact lenses instead of a mask. he puts them in, and now, his view of the world is as distorted as his hearing... bodies deform... sounds fade... already euphoric from the vast amount of oxygen in his system, he moves into another reality altogether... seems to empty himself out.}
<C>__{technician}
<D>__{due minuti!}
<A>__{jacques fills a small tube with water. pours it into his nostrils... tilts his head... then lets it run out... he puts on his gloves... all his movements are slow, he seems to be operating in a different time zone... he seems unable to take his eyes off the water.}
