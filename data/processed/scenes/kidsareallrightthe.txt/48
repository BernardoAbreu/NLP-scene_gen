<C>__{paul}
<D>__{maybe next time we can hang out just you and me.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{clay's cool. he's just gets a little amped sometimes.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{that's not amped. that's being a dick.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{he's not a dick, that's just his way.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{okay...i just didn't like the way he was talking to you.}
<C>__{laser}
<P>__{(defensive)}
<D>__{well, you don't know him.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(back peddling)}
<D>__{you're right...i don't...}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{hey, can i ask you a question?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{why'd you donate sperm?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{well, it's a lot more fun then donating blood.}
<A>__{laser doesn't laugh. paul realizes he's gonna have to give a "non joke" answer.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{i don't know, i guess i thought, you know, if i can help somebody in need, somebody who wants a baby...}
<A>__{laser's not really buying that.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{so you did it to help people?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it was a long time ago...}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{how much did you get paid?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{why do you want to know?}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{i'm just curious.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i don't know, like 60 bucks a pop.}
<C>__{laser}
<D>__{that's it?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it was worth more back then. you know. with inflation...}
<P>__{(off laser's look)}
<D>__{hey, i'm glad i did it...}
<A>__{laser doesn't quite buy paul's altruism. he looks over at him, then away.}
