<L>__{exterior lake day}
<A>__{the "lake" where z and bala were nearly drowned by the water droplet. the earth shakes as a huge, monstrous creature approaches the lake and begins to drink from it. the creature seems to hear something, and, growling, turns its ugly head. it's a pomeranian, one of those yappy little lap dogs but seen from ant perspective, it's something out of a horror movie.}
<C>__{tough voice }
<D>__{ant team six take him out!}
<A>__{the monster bears its huge fangs at the approaching intruders a bunch of flying ants who look as though they're attacking the death star! the monster rears and snaps at two of the ants, who are making a diversionary run... and then gets it from the rest of the ants, who land on his soft, wet nose and start stinging away like crazy. the monster rears back in pain and runs away, yipping! the members of ant team six, a crack team of hardcore flying ant commandoes a la seal team six, break off the attack and land.}
<C>__{major mandible}
<D>__{and don't come back, you sissy!}
<A>__{major mandible, ant team six's lethal commander, steps into frame. he's the one eyed killer we met in the bar earlier. the rest of his team fan out to search the area.}
<C>__{mandible}
<D>__{talk to me.}
<C>__{commando ant}
<D>__{z and the princess were here, sir. signs of a struggle.}
<C>__{mandible}
<D>__{let's get a read on that feremone track. commando ant #1}
<P>__{(to the others)get the sniffer!}
<A>__{two other commandoes come running up with what looks like a piece of machinery on a tripod only it's an ant a highly specialized, blind ant with an incredibly acute sense of smell.}
<C>__{tracker ant}
<D>__{bala...find bala...}
<A>__{the tracker, drool running out of its long proboscis, sniffs the air and starts signalling like a geiger counter...}
<C>__{tracker ant}
<P>__{(as he's swivelled)}
<D>__{nnononononononoyeahyeahnononononono no...}
<A>__{finally the tracker stops swivelling, pointing in one direction and saying, "yeahyeahyeahyeah..."}
<D>__{commando ant #3 got 'em! ten clicks from here!}
<C>__{mandible}
<D>__{z you dirt digging, fancy dancing, wisecracking, royalty grabbing, rebel scum!}
<P>__{(yelling into the distance)}
<D>__{i am coming for you! you are one dead ant, mister!}
<A>__{mandible's muscles bulge. the veins in his head throb. this is one ass kicking ant. even mandible's troops look scared of him.}
<C>__{mandible}
<D>__{let's move! go, people! go! go! go! go! go!}
<A>__{ant team six takes to the air, heading in the direction indicated by the tracker ant.}
