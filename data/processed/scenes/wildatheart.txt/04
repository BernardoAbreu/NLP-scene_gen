<L>__{3. exterior city street day}
<A>__{with a whine from hell, the front tire of the motorcycle hits a speed bump. the motorcycle becomes airborne and on the way up slices itself in half as it scrapes along the full length of a datsun kingcab. in the air, the rider and motorcycle twist violently as they fly by. the motorcycle bounces off a black 66 chevrolet and makes a sound like the end of the world. the rider hits the same chevy a moment later. like a broken ragdoll shot from a canon, the man punches through the back window blowing glass for a block. he stops somewhere under the front seat and a bubble of blood forms out his nose. the motorcycle continues on sliding and spinning with an ear piercing howl for one entire city block.}
