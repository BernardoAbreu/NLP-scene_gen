<L>__{interior confessional booth night}
<A>__{jam kneels on the board and a mere two feet behind him, beth sits on a bench shrouded in darkness. her posture is that of someone with a crate of nitroglycerine on her lap. we hear the shuffling noise of the priest getting into his own compartment next door. a moment later the small, eye level door slides open. the priest's face is barely visible on the other side of the thick screen, but he's there.}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{forgive me, father, for i have sinned. this is my first confession in... well... a really long time.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{prepare to receive the act of penance. how many sins have you committed since your last confession?}
<C>__{jam}
<D>__{just one, father, but boy was it a doozy.}
<A>__{beth leans forward slightly and listens to jam's confession.}
