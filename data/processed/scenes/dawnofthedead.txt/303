<A>__{the body of a dead zombie hits the floor, its head shot through. nearby lies the corpse of the first creature to break into the maintenance office. the third staggers into the room. stephen stands fast now. he holds his rifle out in front of him. the creature walks toward the gun. steve holds his hands on the trigger. the zombie lunges suddenly, and grabs the gun barrel. steve fires, but the blast tears through the creature's chest. steve struggles to raise the barrel but the motion of the zombie makes it impossible to aim accurately. the gun fires again, this time grazing the zombie's neck. with a sudden burst of energy the creature wrenches the gun free. steve backs against the wall. the creature tosses the rifle across the room where it slams the floor near a desk. the zombie advances on steve. steve is next to the key cabinet and grabs at it, trying to find some weapon. he feels the tools in the cabinet and comes up with a hammer. the zombie is about to reach him when steve pulls the hammer out and upsets the cabinet. the zombie fumbles with the cabinet at its feet, but doesn't fall. steve tries to hit the creature's head with the tool, he misses and the zombie grabs at his arm, trying to bite it. steve wrenches free and the two bodies fall to the floor. the creature clutches at the man's legs, it's teeth bared like an animal. steve kicks desperately and manages to land a blow squarely in the creatures face. the zombie comes after him again and from his crawling position, steve brings the hammer as an uppercut to the creature's jaw. the creature falls back enough for steve to crawl across the floor. it follows, but steve reaches the desk and grabs his rifle. rolling on the floor, he fires several shots into the creature, finally destroying it.}
