<A>__{ethan's step is unusually jaunty as he bounces along, making his way thru the festive and jostling crowds preparing for the crema portion of the fallas de valencia. on this night great papier mache effigies, some serious, some comic, are placed all thru the city and torched in great bonfires. outside the bar ethan's looking for there's a street vendor, hawking fallas mementos and flowers. he starts past the vendor, and it hits him he's going to buy some flowers. he chooses a colorful spring bouquet so fresh the dew can be seen on the petals. ethan pays the vendor, starts into the bar, and thinks better of walking into swanbeck with the bouquet. turns back to the vendor.}
