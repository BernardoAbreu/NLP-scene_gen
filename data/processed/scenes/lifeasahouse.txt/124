<C>__{alyssa}
<D>__{me too!}
<A>__{george is still smiling as he tucks a strand of alyssa's hair behind her ear. ryan sort of saunters over to george with his hands sunk deep in his pockets. without asking, george wraps his arms around ryan with a hug. afterward:}

<D>__{josh, you look like you could use a hug.}
<C>__{josh}
<D>__{no...i'm okay. i'm okay.}
<A>__{george is too quick with his hug. josh is stiff as a board. sam looks pissed as he walks away from the second story window and resumes screwing the floorboards. george sets his eyes on dale as he opens his arms wide.}

<D>__{don't even think about it.}
<A>__{george walks toward dale with his arms still extended.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{well, they got me started.}
<C>__{dale}
<D>__{i swear to god, i will use these wires and shock you so bad your tongue will turn black.}
