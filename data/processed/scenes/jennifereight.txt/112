<L>__{111: interior stairwell. institute. night.}
<A>__{totally breathless now. eyes ascend faster than feet. whine of a swinging door. berlin rounds the stairwell. the door's still busy. top of the building here and the ceilings are closing in. berlin's p.o.v. as he heads for that door. closer. three steps to go. closer. two steps more. one step. reaches for it. whamm! the door smashes into him like it hates him. so fast it hardly happened. he staggers back. his flashlight clatters downstairs. banisters capsize as the light passes. every shadow goes crazy. the flashlight arrives at a lower level. rolls away and stops. wastes power into a corner. can't see berlin and can't see his radio. but ross cuts into the silence with increasing disquiet.}
