<A>__{a hurricane blast of wind hits the monster oak. the two branches resembling arms fold forward aiming at the window. the disfigured crown with the horns and knotty eyes bends back before tipping forward. the finger twigs at the end of the arms reach out hungrily.}

<A>__{the entire tree crashes through robbie’s window. a furnace of lightning accents the assault. robbie starts screaming. the finger twigs wrap around him like skeleton hands and lift him right out of bed. carol anne sits up and screams for diane. the tree seems to be exhaling. its breath enveloping robbie in a phantom haze. the arms begin to retract pulling robbie toward the mouth and eyes.}
