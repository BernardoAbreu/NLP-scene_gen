<C>__{voice }
<D>__{thank you. mr. ocean, the purpose of this meeting is to determine whether, if released, you are likely to break the law again. while this was your first conviction, you have been implicated, though never charged, in over a dozen other confidence schemes and frauds. what can you tell us about this?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{as you say, ma'am, i was never charged.}

<A>__{three parole board members sit opposite danny, behind a table.}
<D>__{board member #2 mr. ocean, what we're trying to find out is: was there a reason you chose to commit this crime, or was there a reason why you simply got caught this time?}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{my wife left me. i was upset. i got into a self destructive pattern. board member #3 if released, is it likely you would fall back into a similar pattern?}

(if it matters and if you notice he's wearing his wedding ring.) he hovers there for a moment, on the precipice of freedom. the wind whistles a little on the other side of the gate, and the view ahead is not pleasant (new jersey): life is hard out there. but danny musters his courage, then takes his first step into free america...}

<B>__{at blackjack table}
<A>__{danny cranes his neck about the casino, looking for someone a friend, somebody who should be here but without success. he turns his attention back to his cards, and the cards of the dealer. nine ten. stay. dealer seventeen. danny wins. king four. dealer shows a six. stick. dealer busts. queen ace. twenty one. danny wins again. a second dealer relieves the first, and danny recognizes him with a smile this wasn't the friend he was scouting for, but two hours out of the joint any familiar face is welcome.}
<C>__{danny}
<D>__{hello, frank.}
<A>__{the new dealer (frank catton) glances up at danny, and his eyes go wide, like a priest who's discovered he's dealing communion wafers to the pontiff himself. he quickly hides his astonishment.}

<D>__{i beg your pardon, sir. you must have me confused with someone else. my name is ramon. see?}
<A>__{he taps the name embroidered on his vest, although he is the most african looking ramon you've ever seen. a pit boss circles close by and glares at them both.}
