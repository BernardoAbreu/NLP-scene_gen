<A>__{a blue and white police jeep is bouncing over the sand. a figure in civilian clothes driving alone on some urgent mission. it's martin brody, chief of police on amity. the jeep slows to a stop, and he takes a flight of stairs leading to a concrete patio two at a time. a classical trumpet solo is playing in the background. brody charges through a door, then abruptly slows and starts moving warily through a hotel interior: the holidome, a three story extravaganza of a motel, where some sort of formal ceremony is already in progress. a banner announces: "grand opening ball amity scholarship fund benefit." brody crosses under a high school band, arranged dance band style on a balcony; the trumpet player, polo, is finishing his solo, the assembled crowd applauds politely. brody is taking his place with some dignitaries on the dais, as the presiding authority, amity mayor larry vaughn, begins speaking.}

<D>__{thank you, paul lohman, for that eloquent solo. now, for that point in the ceremonies where we formally dedicate this magnificent resort hotel complex, a worthwhile addition to the recreational paradise we call amity.}

<A>__{seated on folding chairs, wearing their good suits, several of amity's selectmen, real estate developer len peterson, and ellen brody, very chic. brody slips into the vacant chair next to her. the following is conducted in urgent whispers, sotto voce, while vaughn drones on.}

<P>__{(applause)}
<D>__{len peterson's amity shores development is an exciting addition to our island. the holiday inn we stand in is likewise a new friend who we welcome as family. amity means 'friendship' and our community extends its friendship to all who seek her shores in peace and harmony.}
