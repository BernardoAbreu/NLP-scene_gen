<L>__{exterior street. day}
<A>__{dignan drives the car slowly alongside: bob walking down the sidewalk, staring straight ahead. dignan's, got his window down.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{look, bob. i understand your loyalty. you're a good person. but right now you're not using your best judgement.}
<A>__{bob keeps walking.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{future man would not want you to go to jail i promise you. just get in the car and we'll talk about it.}
<A>__{no reaction. bob keeps walking straight ahead.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{future man would never go to jail for you, i will tell you that.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{his name's not future man, dignan.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{i know it's not.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{you don't even know his name.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{yes, i do.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{just get in the car, bob.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{what's his name?}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{ok, bob. i don't know his name. you know why? because i don't care. he's future man. but i care about you. and to me it doesn't make sense to go back to the scene of a crime. will you get in the car, bob? this is stupid.}

<C>__{bob}
<D>__{it's not your decision and he's not your brother, dignan.}
<C>__{dignan}

<A>__{pause. bob gets into the backseat. dignan looks back at him for a minute.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{you're going to ride in the back?}
<A>__{bob nods and looks out the window.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{come on, bob. get in front.}
<A>__{bob exhales and gets out. he gets in up front. dignan looks at him for a minute.}
<C>__{dignan}
<D>__{you've got a beautiful walk, bob.}
