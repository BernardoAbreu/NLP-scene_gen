<D>__{thursday, september fourth, sixteen forty five. the alchemist awakes. all of my ideas, work and dreams are spinning together it all has to do with spirals. it began with spirals and the answers are thee.}
<L>__{interior max's apartment day}
<A>__{euclid's innards max uses a drill to rip out some old parts. he lays new wire and does a bunch of soldering. he rips down a bunch of old papers and does a general housecleaning. he also goes to school on the ant population in his apartment. he plants some ant motels and sprays the room with. a pest killer.}

<D>__{the most i can remember about their significance is from schneider's class. that bullshit core for majors. schneider's fascination with mystical geometry made him a bit of a quack...but...then again, look at kepler. he was really into pythagoras. the leader of an ancient sect which believed the entire universe could be represented by numbers. pythagoras' greatest contribution was the golden ratio, which ended up influencing art and science for thousands of years, arguably all the way up to today.}
<A>__{tight on max writing a : b : : b : a + b. he draws it over a copy of leonardo da vinci's famous drawing of man s anatomy.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{the golden ratio, if i recall, is this unique relationship between the length and width of a special rectangle called the golden rectangle.}
<A>__{tight on max carefully measuring out a golden rectangle. the rectangle fits perfectly over leonardo da vinci's man.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{if you take the width of this rectangle and use it to form a square within the rectangle, the part left over is a rectangle that has the same ratio as the original rectangle. au can continue squaring the rectangle, over and over again, making the rectangles smaller and smaller to infinity.}
<A>__{tight on max squaring rectangle after rectangle. then he draws the golden spiral through the rectangles.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{then, if you connect a curve through these rectangles you get the golden spiral. the pythagoreans loved this shape because they found it everywhere in nature.}
<B>__{montage of images}
<A>__{the images mirror what max talks about. we see nautilus shells, sunflowers, plants, ram horns, human fingerprints, the milky way, and dna strands.}
