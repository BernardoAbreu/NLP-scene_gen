<L>__{interior bijou office day}
<A>__{pete is at the desk, staring into space. adele leans against the radiator behind him. the silence in the room is thick. across the desk from pete sits leo kubelsky.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{the fbi can't arrest you, because you haven't done anything wrong.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{well, that's a relief. i understand they usually don't let that stop them.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{however... you're gonna be subpoenaed to testify before the un american activities committee when they open hearings in los angeles. now, if you play ball and tell them what they want to hear, they'll clear you.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{and i won't be a communist anymore.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{exactly.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{so it doesn't make any difference that i'm not one now, and have never been one.}
<A>__{leo stands and walks to the window.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{kid, don't get philosophical with me. this is a game, but it's not your game. you play by their rules, or they'll ruin you. and they have the power to do it.}
<C>__{adele}
<D>__{doesn't it bother anyone that this is a perversion of democracy?}
<A>__{leo turns to her and smiles. his tone is charmingly matter of factly, not condescending in the least.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{darling, don't kid yourself. we don't have a "democracy" in this country. the declaration of independence? the constitution? these are pieces of paper with signatures on 'em. and you know what a piece of paper with a signature is? it's a contract. and you know what a contract is? something that can be re negotiated at any time. it just so happens that the house un american activities committee is re negotiating the contract this time around.}
<A>__{leo takes out a cigarette, lights it.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{next time, it might be the fbi. the time after that, it might be the president. but it'll always be someone. count on it.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{that's not the country luke fought for.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{lest we forget, peter, your own military career was somewhat less illustrious than luke's.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{it's wrong, leo.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{peter, don't let that stop you all of a sudden.}
<A>__{leo pulls a folded paper from his coat pocket and hands it to pete.}
<C>__{leo}
<D>__{here. when you're called, read this to them. just tell the bastards what they want to hear, and we can all get on with our lives.}
<A>__{there's a knock at the door. leo opens it. standing there is a small man wearing a serious suit and an even more serious fedora.}
<C>__{the man}
<D>__{peter appleton?}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{(standing)}
<D>__{you found him.}
<A>__{the man reaches into his breast pocket and withdraws a blue backed folded document, which he hands to pete. as he does, a flash lights the room. at the door, a pair of photographers and a newsreel cameraman are jockeying for position. pete rolls his eyes.}
<C>__{the man}
<D>__{peter appleton, you are hereby subpoenaed to appear as a witness before a special session of the house committee on un american activities. you are to appear in los angeles, california, at the biltmore hotel, at the date and time specified herein.}
<A>__{pete takes the subpoena. there's an awkward moment, as the newsreel camera is still rolling. pete cradles the subpoena like an oscar statuette and smiles into the lens.}
<C>__{pete}
<P>__{("on")}
<D>__{this is a great honor. i will treasure this always. thank you.}
