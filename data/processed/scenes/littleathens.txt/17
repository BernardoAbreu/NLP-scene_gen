<L>__{exterior ron's gym morning}
<A>__{jimmy's piece of shit hatchback is parked in front of the small bare bones gym.}
<L>__{interior ron's gym, locker room continuous}
<A>__{jimmy now dressed in worn out heavily frayed khaki shorts and a short sleeve button down shirt with a "ron's gym" emblem on the pocket, stands before his locker twisting the combination lock with one hand while rotating steel chinese stress balls with his other hand. he opens the locker and pulls out a large brown lunch bag propped prominently at the base.}
<C>__{ron }
<D>__{hey jimmy. you fix the lat machine?}
<A>__{ron, the tall, well built, forty something owner of the gym, approaches. jimmy turns toward ron. the row of lockers serves as a backdrop.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{jimmy, i'm just gonna say this, alright? i gotta let you go. i can't afford two employees.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{so you're keeping melinda?}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{ron, that is totally fucked! i been here way longer than her!}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{yeah, but i'm running a business. there're guys who pay me dues just 'cause she works here.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{but she doesn't do anything! she just sits at the front desk all day.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{i know that.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{tell her to fix the fucking lat machine, she'll look at you cross eyed.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{i can't afford two employees, and she attracts business. that's it.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{fucking great. thanks.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{jimmy, don't take it personal. if you were built like her i'd keep you.}
<A>__{ron exits and jimmy sits on the bench in front of his locker, defeated. buggerin' bobby bales, a.k.a. bobby the bookie, an enormous juicehead built like an old school nfl linebacker, naked except for a towel around his neck, having just taken a shower, is leaning against the end of a row of lockers, waiting for his chance at jimmy. jimmy would rather that ron stay.}
<C>__{ron }
<D>__{bales.}
<A>__{bobby nods in response as ron passes by on his way out. with the locker room empty, bobby unconsciously changes demeanor. he's tender, frighteningly tender, it's so entirely genuine. jimmy would prefer a beating simple and final. jimmy pulls his backpack out of his locker and begins clearing his stuff.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{so where you been?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{what are you talkin' about? nowhere. i been working.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{so you just don't return my phone calls.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{look, they lost, i owe you some more, so what? i will pay you. i want to put it on indy tonight.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i can't take any more of your bets. i look like a spineless fucking fag.}
<A>__{bobby shuts jimmy's locker and steps up to jimmy so that jimmy is now face to face with bobby's enormous organ a terrifying sight for mortal men and reputable women. jimmy is struck silent, savagely clenching his chinese stress balls as he struggles for thought.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{what the hell am i supposed to do with you jimmy? people are talkin'.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i know they're talkin'!}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you don't know a fuckin' thing. come by my apartment tonight, we'll figure this out.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i ain't like that.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{ain't like what?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{nothin'.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you don't know what i know. you'll see.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i'm working tonight.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{jimmy, i ain't about beggin'. i'm lookin' like a fool all on account 'a you. you owe me. you owe me. i'm gettin' sick of it.}
<A>__{bobby moves on to his own locker.}
