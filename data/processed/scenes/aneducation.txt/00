<A>__{january 1962. montage a nice girls' school in a south west london suburb. we see girls doing what girls did in a nice girls' school in 1962: walking with books on their heads, practising their handwriting, making cakes, playing lacrosse, dancing with each other.}
<L>__{interior classroom. day}
<A>__{in one of the classrooms, miss stubbs, an attractive, bright, animated schoolteacher, is talking to a small group of sixteen year old girls. some of these girls seem to be daydreaming looking out of the window, examining their fingernails. a couple, including a bespectacled girl who looks five years younger than everyone else in the class, write down everything the teacher says. only one, jenny, beautiful and animated, seems to be listening in the spirit in which miss stubbs would like her to listen. she's smiling, eyes shining she loves miss stubbs, and these lessons. miss stubbs asks a question, and jenny puts up her hand the only one in the class to do so.}
