<L>__{202 204 out interior sanctuary hq. logan, jessica close}
<A>__{in the darkness we see the glass silver spear points are glowing all around them, the long shafts falling away into darkness, the points, steaming gently when they touch making an instant, wincing burn. logan moves a spear point presses he flinches.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{i'm a runner. she brought me here because i begged her to help me.}
<A>__{he turns his palm. the red crystal blinks impressively in the darkness. at the sight, a babble of sounds. argument.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{he's lying. no sandman ever ran. 2nd voice you don't run. you kill runners. you have killed runners all your life. }
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{yes i have.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now it's my turn. and i want to live.}
<A>__{another angry murmur of voices. over it jessica suddenly:}
<C>__{jessica}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{what's the matter with you. he's a runner he's blinking. we must help anyone who asks...we must or we're the same as they are deciding who lives and dies.}
<A>__{one of the points lifts and touches jessica's cheek. a quick, fierce burn. she shrieks a tiny sound and is silent.}
<B>__{logan}
<A>__{reacts fiercely, spinning against the spear points, he is jabbed and pierced in a dozen places as he manages to get jessica closer, shielding her with his body. but the spear points are too much. he subsides, as voices rise angrily "kill him now". suddenly a ringing alarm. all sound stops at once and we hear a clatter of footsteps down the iron stair and across the outer floor. the spotlight bursts on again and a figure staggers into the chamber, straightening into the light, hair dishevelled, hands in front against the glare. it's holly.}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{holly. holly, new you 483... he's dead. doc's dead and the sandmen came...}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(gentle)}
<D>__{holly holly. remember the code. the code, please holly...}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(hysteria)}
<D>__{they smashed everything and i barely got away.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{holly. station 12, sanctuary 7. holly. holly...}
<A>__{she lowers her hands and we see her, tattered, frightened the bright smile strange. she comes to herself a bit, looks to the side and sees logan and jessica, pinned against the wall. she reacts with fear at the sight.}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{it's him! the first sandman. he killed...doc.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{no, holly wait! he's running. tell them the rest!}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(suddenly exhausted)}
<D>__{he's the one. you too. i remember. he was in a hurry. just a face job. dark hair, i said. then he killed doc and you grabbed me and the machine blew up and i ran...i ran}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{holly. holly! please...the other sandman. remember the one who came after }
<A>__{holly suddenly remembers and the shock makes her lucid.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(pouring it out)}
<D>__{that's right. the other one came after. the older one. smashing, killing, burning!}
<C>__{jessica}
<P>__{(coaching desperately)}
<D>__{...and he was hunting the first one, this one. wasn't he? wasn't he? this one was running, the other one was hunting him...}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(remembers)}
<D>__{yes. oh yes.}
<P>__{(to logan)}
<D>__{he was after you. i remember. you're running!}
