<A>__{ike sits with a towel over his head as peggy blow dries the back of his head. his back is to the mirror, his body faces maggie. cindy does her own nails as mrs. pressman scratches off lottery tickets. the dog, sprout, sits in is basket.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{in another one... pete, wearing a hat, comes in the front door of the salon.}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{hey, pete, i will be right with you. ike peeks out from under his towel as maggie continues.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i'm inside the church. everyone i know is there, only they're not really them. they're like frankenstein monsters, but without the bolts coming out of their necks. it's all very "night of the living dead". and here's the creepiest part i look down at my dress and it's red. i mean, i have no idea what it means. red's not my color! ike listens intently and stares steadily into her eyes. peggy removes the towel. his hair is divided into equal parts and dyed orange and red.}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{so what do you think? ike stares back at her, the tickle of suspicion creeping up his spine.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{i think you'd look good in red.}
<C>__{peggy}
<A>__{no, she's talking about your hair. maggie swivels his chair so that ike faces the mirror. ike looks at his brightly colored hair.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{you're all ready for football season, mr. graham. ike stares at his hair in total confusion. with icy calm, ike rises from his chair and primps the end of his hair as if giving it the finishing touches. then he sees his defaced newspaper clipping and all becomes clear. he picks up the article and shows it to everyone. ike does a slow burn.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{yes, i think i nailed the personality profile of the women of hale. ike turns and puts the clipping up on the mirror.}
<C>__{ike }
<P>__{(to peggy)}
<A>__{my jacket, please. peggy hands him his jacket.}
<C>__{ike }
<P>__{(sarcastically)}
<A>__{thank you. ike moves toward the door. he spots pete.}
<C>__{ike }
<P>__{(putting on jacket; to pete)}
<A>__{excuse me, pete, do you know a place that sells shampoo... strong shampoo?}
<C>__{pete}
<A>__{doc's pharmacy. third and elm. tell him pete sent you. want my hat?}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{no thanks. ike smiles at maggie and exits.}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(to peggy)}
<A>__{he seems crabby.}
