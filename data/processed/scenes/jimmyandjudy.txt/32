<T>__{camera on:}
<A>__{i e. highway first kiss smiley face jimmy's car day jimmy is driving in his car with judy in the passenger seat. judy has the camera and she is interviewing jimmy as he drives.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{where are you taking me?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{to a beautiful place.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{chuck e. cheese.}
<A>__{judy and jimmy laugh together.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{no seriously.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i can't tell you. it'll ruin it.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{fine.}
<A>__{judy sulks for a second.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{jimmy, can i ask you something?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{anything.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{do you hate your parents?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{yes, but i understand them.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{what's to understand?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{lots of things.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{like what?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i understand that my ascension into young adulthood triggered their descent into mid life crisis. generally when an only child leaves the nest, the parents begin reassessing their own lives. they see us as a younger, better version of themselves.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{they feel abandoned by our need for privacy and insecure because we no longer seek their approval. they used to take us to baseball games and cover our scrapes with bandages, but once we no longer need mom to nurture our bruises or dad to be our hero it puts their roles and subsequent sense of self worth into question.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{how do you know all these things?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{when you don't have any friends, don't play sports, don't go out, have no one talk to, nowhere to go, no one to listen to you, or no one to help you figure things out, you sort of have to figure things out by yourself. and without any of those things i have nothing but time to think about stuff.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{you are so smart.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{you are so beautiful.}
<A>__{long pause. judy doesn't know how to react.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{you think i'm pretty?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i think you're the most beautiful person i have ever met. the most beautiful person in the universe.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{no one has ever told me that.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{get used to hearing it.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{do you think i'm smart?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{do you think i'm fat?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{how could you say that? i only way a hundred and ten pounds.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{oh, i'm sorry. i thought you said flat. as in flat chested.}
<C>__{judy }

<A>__{judy smacks him.}

<C>__{judy }
<D>__{i don't have to prove it. here look.}
<A>__{o.c., judy is sticking her chest out for jimmy. he looks away from the road to stare, her breasts filling out her top nicely.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i still can't tell.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{i wear a full b cup.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{show me. take em out.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{i am not going to take them out! you take yours out.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{it's already out.}
<A>__{judy tilts the camera down. in a flash we see a lifelike dildo sticking out of jimmy's fly, a smiley face sticker covers the head. the camera quickly shakes and spins off the image as judy screams bloody fucking murder. jimmy laughs. judy forgets the camera is on. she drops it into her lap, fabric from her clothes covers the frame. we can hear jimmy and judy laughing hysterically.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{i can't believe you did that.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{that's why i did it. now come on. i showed you mine, let me see yours.}
<A>__{we hear the rustling of judy's clothing. camera falls to her feet on the floor of the car. there's silence. off camera, judy's nervously showing jimmy her breasts.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{wow. give me the camera.}
<C>__{judy }
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{please, pretty, pretty please with sugar on top.}
<A>__{judy grabs the camera. it's pointing in jimmy's direction, but she still doesn't realize it's on.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{here, i will pull over.}
<A>__{jimmy pulls over to the side of the road then takes the camera. jimmy frames up judy.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{let me see 'em.}
<A>__{judy has a naughty and flirtatious smile. in the blink of an eye she suddenly lifts up her shirt and exposes her bra, then pulls her shirt back down. jimmy protests.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{that doesn't count. come on, for real this time.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i'm embarrassed.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{don't be. you can trust me.}
<A>__{judy's not sure. jimmy looks into her eyes, pouring it on.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{you can. you can trust me with your life.}
<A>__{judy looks at him with a sense of admiration then hope.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{judy gets the same sexy, naughty smile and lifts up her shirt exposing the bra, keeping it there.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{will you take off your bra?}
<A>__{judy looks nervous but gives in. she unhooks her bra from the front and exposes her naked breasts for as long as she can. jimmy focusses the camera's attention on them. it's too much for her. she quickly pulls her shirt back down. jimmy tilts up to a close up of judy's face.}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(struggling)}
<D>__{i just realized something.}
<A>__{judy's eyes are starting to well up as she tries not to cry.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{i just showed you my breasts and i saw your penis and we haven't even kissed.}
<A>__{she starts tearing up.}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{you haven't even asked me to be your girlfriend and i did that. i'm a slut.}
<P>__{(wiping her eyes)}
<D>__{i don't want to be a slut.}
<A>__{jimmy sees she's crying.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{will you be my girlfriend?}
<C>__{judy}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{can i kiss you?}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(sniffling)}
<D>__{yes. will you turn off the camera?}
<C>__{jimmy }
<D>__{i want this moment to be captured forever. i'd rather not kiss you at all than waste the opportunity to document the most beautiful moment of my life.}
<A>__{judy leans towards jimmy, then suddenly attacks him and shoves the camera to the side. they are making out exuberantly. the camera shakes and wobbles. we can hear heavy breathing and the two of them smashing up against the interior of the car. jimmy finally has the camera in position. he has one of his arms extended and now we can see the two of them kissing. judy's devouring him in that raging teenage hormone sort of way.}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{i wanna see your smiley face again.}
<A>__{we see and hear judy whispering, her lips placed gently on the inside of jimmy's ear.}
<C>__{judy}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{turn the camera off. turn the camera off. turn it off.}
<A>__{camera goes off.}
