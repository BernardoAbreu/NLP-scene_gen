<A>__{talley approaches the house. he can see flashlights moving in the kitchen }
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{come on, dennis. talk to me.}
<A>__{dennis doesn't answer, so talley moves closer. he spreads his hands wide }
<C>__{talley }
<D>__{i'm unarmed. i'm looking at you. get out here and let's talk.}
<A>__{dennis comes to the french doors. he stuffs his pistol into his pants, and opens the doors }
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{you got a sniper out there, gonna shoot me?}
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{only if you try to grab me. we could've shot you from the wall.}
<A>__{dennis considers that and accepts it. he steps out of the house and walks over to talley }
<C>__{talley }
<D>__{you've been in there a long time. what're you waiting for?}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{would you be in a hurry to go to prison for the rest of your life?}
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{i'd be trying to get the best deal that i could.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{maybe that's what i'm doing. can i reach in my pocket, show you something?}
<A>__{dennis rooney steps closer because he doesn't want anyone else to see the wad of money he pulls out }
<C>__{dennis }
<D>__{that's fifty hundred dollar bills. five grand. they got money in this house, talley, more than you've ever seen.}
<A>__{dennis pushes the money back into his pocket.}
<C>__{dennis }
<D>__{how much would it be worth to you, getting me out of here?}
<A>__{so that's what keeps dennis in the house money. this is the first that talley has heard of the money }
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{you picked a bad house to hole up in, son.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{two hundred thousand cash, right in your pocket, no one needs to know.}
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{give up.}
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{there's a million dollars in there, maybe two million. i will give you half.}
<A>__{talley stares at dennis, wondering how much to tell him and whether or not it will do any good }
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{the man you sent to the hospital is a criminal. he has partners. this is their house and their money and they want it back.}
<A>__{these simple facts settle on dennis like a funeral shroud everything that smith said earlier now makes a horrible sense: you can't imagine the fucking you're going to get. dennis's eyes fill with defeat and helplessness }
<C>__{dennis}
<D>__{it ain't been a good day, chief.}
<C>__{talley}
<D>__{give up, dennis. let these people go. at least you'll have your life.}
<A>__{dennis steps inside and pulls the door closed, the darkness in the house swallowing him like dirty water. the power is turned on. the house comes to life as talley turns away, his phone once more rings }
