<L>__{interior dussander's living room dusk}
<A>__{todd has built a fire, probably the first fire dussander's fireplace has seen in twenty years. the room is bathed in a warm orange glow as the winter sun sets outside. todd uses the poker to adjust one of the logs.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{screw you. i'm doing this for me. this place is freezing.}
<A>__{dussander comes back in with his drink and settles into his easy chair, which has been positioned in front of the hearth.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{yes, it must be fifty degrees outside. i'm sure to you it seems positively frigid .}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{why didn't you pay your gas bill?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{it slipped my mind. i will attend to it tomorrow.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{slipped your mind. i noticed it didn't slip your mind to stock up on a new case of bourbon.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{leave me alone.}
<A>__{todd finishes with the fire and sits on the floor a few feet away.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{all right, so finish your story, because i'm still not clear. you cook up this stew, and you bring the prisoner in, and you let them smell it, and suddenly they tell you everything?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{oh, don't misunderstand me. certainly with a pistol pressed to their head, a prisoner would tell us everything we wanted to know, sometimes more. but mine was a much more ... elegant method. remember, it had been months since they had smelled real potatoes simmering over an open flame, and boy, when that delicious odor hit their noses their mouths would drop and out would pour an account of every minor infraction their friends had committed, i mean it was magnificent...}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{and you let them eat the soup?}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{oh, we never promised them the soup in exchange for information. we never mentioned it at all.}
<A>__{pause. todd is impressed.}
<C>__{todd}
<D>__{wow, that's really good, dussander. i mean that's...}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{that's thinking.}
<A>__{dussander does not respond. he gazes deeply into the fire.}
<C>__{dussander}
<D>__{...but, as the war pressed on, the time for such civilized measures became a luxury. i remember by april of '45, we had barely enough food to feed ourselves. the sound of the russian mortars grew louder everyday, but still, the train cars from france and poland kept coming. this was a time of desperation. the ovens burned day and night and still i knew we would not beat the arrival of the russian forces. many of my men, the cowardly ones, deserted during the night. but the men that remained, the same ones i had called upon so many times, ...continued the work. at first we thought a massive fire in the main building would serve our purpose. we could just crowd them in and pull a gas torch up to each of the windows. but with so many of them, we couldn't be sure the bodies would burn properly. we needed something ...certain. then a young, bright soldier, i shall never forget his enthusiastic smile, pointed to a pair of bulldozers near the western gate which had been used during construction. how perfectly simple it was. the bulldozers carved a narrow trench, four meters deep, down the center of the camp. for two hours they dug until i realized we may not have enough gas to finish the job. so the inmates were given shovels and told they were building a shelter from the incoming artillery. when they were done, i immediately called for a practice drill and three thousand naked bodies began to march into the trench. it took less than twenty minutes to get them in place. quickly the bulldozers moved down the sides of the pit sending the piles of earth into the massive grave. those who tried to free themselves were shot, of course, but very few cartridges were wasted that day. the machines were too fast. back and forth they went... packing the dirt. one by one the tractors ran out of gas and my men had to scurry along with shovels. but by sunset... it was done. i gave the order to evacuate. in the distance the plumes of russian mortar fire rose like an approaching thundercloud. but i knew that no matter what happened, ...no one would ever forget what we did here.}
<A>__{dussander stares into the fire. todd, wide eyed, is locked on dussander when... the phone rings. they look at each other, a bit puzzled. clearly, it does not ring very often, and when it does, dussander cannot help but be apprehensive. it rings again. dussander gets up and moves toward the kitchen, todd watches him go.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{hello?}
<P>__{(pause. then with apprehension)}
<D>__{yes? ...no, no trouble at all. ...yes. ...yes, he's here. ...i see.}
<P>__{(his face softens)}
<D>__{...really? ...no, no plans. ...ah, lovely. ...my dear, i'd be delighted. ...certainly. ...of course i will. ...yes, until then. ...all right. ...good bye.}
<A>__{he hangs up and turns to todd with a odd grin.}
<C>__{dussander }
<D>__{it seems i am to be your guest for thanksgiving dinner.}
