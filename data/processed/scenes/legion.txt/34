<A>__{charlie's face lights up when she sees the police car.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{oh, thank god, the police!}
<L>__{exterior paradise falls gas 'n' grub continuous}
<A>__{the door of the police car opens as charlie races from the diner. the three men see her moving toward the car. jeep's face goes slack.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{charlie, wait!}
<A>__{the men begin to run toward her... while out of the police car steps...}
<B>__{michael}
<A>__{charlie freezes a few feet from the car when she sees those piercing eyes already familiar to us. michael looks at her, as if she was exactly who he expected to see. in moments bob, kyle and jeep form a protective shield in front of charlie. bob raises the shotgun.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{take one step closer and i will drop you right here.}
<A>__{a long beat as michael considers bob. icy cold.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{that how you greet all your customers?}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{mister, after what we've been through here today, you're lucky we didn't shoot you first and greet you later. now let me see your teeth.}
<A>__{michael stares at him blankly.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{your teeth goddamn it! lemme see `em!}
<A>__{michael offers up a dangerous smile, revealing a not so well kept but definitely normal set of teeth. bob and the others ease slightly.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{no, shark teeth, pop.}
<A>__{bob lowers the gun.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{okay... suppose you tell us your name then.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{michael.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{sorry about all that, michael. this old lady just went crazy inside my place here. she had these teeth. never seen anything like `em. practically bit a man in half.}
<A>__{michael remains silent. doesn't seemed shocked in the least by what he's heard.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{so what are you doin' out here? gotta say you don't exactly look like a police officer. even one from l.a. then again, you have to be, right? i mean, who the hell'd be crazy enough to steal a cop car?}
<A>__{bob chuckles for a moment. when michael doesn't respond in kind, bob falls silent. anxious. he slowly raises the shotgun again. michael sizes up this raggedy group. his gaze drifts over to the loosely wrapped body in front of the diner. the plastic table cloth flaps wildly in the wind. turning back to bob:}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you don't know, do you?}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{know what?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{we don't know anything. nothing's working here. the tv, the radio, the phone...}
<A>__{michael just shakes his head.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i'm running out of time.}
<A>__{michael steps toward charlie with a sense of purpose, but bob blocks his path, brandishing the shotgun.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{back off, fella...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now, i don't care if this is the second coming of jesus fucking christ, i say it's time for you to either get talkin' or get the hell outta here!}
<A>__{in a blur of movement, michael rips the shotgun from bob's hands. it all happens so fast that bob is stunned to find himself holding air. he's even more stunned to now have the barrel of the gun pressed to the bridge of his nose. everyone freezes.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{easy! easy!}
<A>__{michael's expression is totally calm. merciless.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{c'mon, dad, tell `em you're sorry. tell `em you were only kidding!}
<A>__{but bob can't even speak, he's so scared. he squeezes his eyes closed.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{let `em go!}
<A>__{michael's eyes flit momentarily in charlie's direction. considering her. the diner door opens and percy steps cautiously out with hand and hook held up to show no threat. he's followed by sandra and audrey. michael sees them, but offers no indication that he cares.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{now, son, i'm sure you don't wanna go spillin' blood for no good reason in front of all these decent people, do ya? our friend bob here ain't worth the trouble it'd cause ya.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{so whaddya say `bout just lettin' `im go and then you can be on your way? nice `n' easy.}
<A>__{but michael doesn't seem to register this plea. it's not looking good. no one breathes. that's when kyle notices something out in the direction of the road.}
<B>__{dozens of tiny headlights appearing in the dark haze. approaching.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{what the ?}
<A>__{michael turns, sees the lights.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{they're here.}
<A>__{michael whips the gun away from bob's head and thrusts it back into his hands. bob's looks down at the gun, speechless.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{you're going to need this.}
<A>__{michael walks swiftly around to the trunk of the cruiser. pops it, revealing a staggering arsenal of weaponry.}
<B>__{he begins to load gun after gun.}
<A>__{percy stares out at the lights, eyes wide.}
<C>__{percy}
<D>__{lord, have mercy.}
<P>__{(waving back audrey and sandra)}
<D>__{you ladies best get back inside.}
<C>__{sandra}
<D>__{what is it? what's happening? who is this man? why's he driving a police car?}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{shut up, mom!}
<A>__{audrey pulls her mother back into the diner. michael hands an mp5 sub machine gun to kyle. another one goes to percy. finally he places a third one in jeep's hands, who stares down at it anxiously.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{wait. i don't think that's such a good idea.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{dad, i can handle it.}
<C>__{bob}
<P>__{(to michael)}
<D>__{he's just a kid }
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{i said, i can handle it!}
<A>__{michael's eyes narrow, studying jeep.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{he can handle it. he doesn't have a choice.}
<A>__{michael pulls out twin mp5s for himself. glock 9s are tucked everywhere they can go. michael tosses clip belts to the men. boxes of shotgun shells. the works.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{if you want to live, you'll do exactly as i say.}
<A>__{he slams the trunk closed and approaches charlie. he cocks a glock and hands it to her.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{when you fire, you keep your thumb off the slide. don't hesitate. don't do anything brave. there's no safety.}
<A>__{he gives her a hard look. she nods nervously. trusting him but not sure why. michael marches into the diner. kyle glances quickly at the others, then he bolts after michael. percy follows. then charlie. now it's only jeep and his father left.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{c'mon, jeep. we gotta go!}
<A>__{and bob rushes into the diner. a moment as jeep looks out toward the road.}
<B>__{the headlights are growing brighter. closer.}
<A>__{he contemplates the sub machine gun in his hands.}
<C>__{jeep}
<D>__{fuck it.}
<A>__{and races after his father.}
