<L>__{interior apartment evening}
<A>__{peter enters the apartment with natalie. a bunch of crepe paper streamers are hanging in the hall, as well as posters with various things written on them: peter's #1! congratulations, peter! hurray, hurray, hurray! jack comes running in with a bottle of champagne, he pops the cork. jack hugs peter tightly as michael comes in with glasses and tries to catch the champagne that's flowing all over. they all shout and go bananas celebrating.}
