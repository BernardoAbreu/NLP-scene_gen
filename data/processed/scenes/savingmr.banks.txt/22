<L>__{exterior beverly hills hotel pool day}
<C>__{underwater}
<A>__{splosh! a green bomb disturbs the tranquil surface and then another splosh! we rise through the water to see pamela on her balcony throwing the pears, one by one, into the swimmer free swimming pool.}
<L>__{interior beverly hills hotel suite continuous}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{good riddance.}
<A>__{she breathes a sigh of relief and closes the balcony doors.}
<C>__{pamela }
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{well, first things first.}
<A>__{she gathers up the disney paraphernalia and shoves it all in a closet. she picks up her bags and goes through to the bedroom where the biggest stuffed mickey mouse imaginable takes up the entire bed. imagine it. nope. bigger!}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{good lord.}
<A>__{pamela drops her bags, grabs mickey and places him on the floor, facing the wall.}
<C>__{pamela }
<P>__{(to mickey)}
<D>__{and you can stay there until you learn the art of subtlety.}
<A>__{pamela opens her carpetbag and begins to unpack. she takes from it a bottle of pills, which she places on her night stand, followed by another bottle and another and another. the potions keep coming, as do creams and books and make up, the bag is endless. things, things and more things come streaming out of it and once the night stand is full she uses windowsills and any other available surface for her miniature buddhas. finally she takes out an impossibly large framed picture of herself. she holds it up, admires it, takes down an existing painting and replaces it with her own image.}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{there.}
<A>__{pamela is restless, she looks around the room, stands in front of a full length mirror, admiring herself. she turns her face slightly to catch it at its best angle. she leans forward and explores the contours of her face, surprisingly unlined for a woman of her years. she smiles, full of vanity.}
<C>__{pamela }
<P>__{(satisfied)}
<D>__{yes.}
<P>__{(answering an imaginary question)}
<D>__{well, no, i don't suppose i do mind.}
<A>__{she laughs, but pamela finds joy difficult so it comes out as an ugly snort.}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{now, really! flatterer!}
<P>__{(then scolding herself)}
<D>__{silly girl.}
<A>__{she turns her attention away from the mirror and picks up a remote control staring at it with bemusement. she points it at the television hitting random buttons until suddenly the tv bursts into life.}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{oh!}
<A>__{she clicks again, the tv goes off, again and it's on. a housewife advertises dish soap with glee, as if dish soap is the greatest thing ever invented.}
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{soap for the brains.}
<A>__{she changes the channel and stares blankly at a man on a black and white screen. it takes a moment before she realizes that staring back at her is the charming, moustached, kindly face of walter elias disney (58) on the wonderful world of disney show. pamela raises an eyebrow }
<C>__{pamela }
<D>__{well, well there you are.}
<A>__{cu: tv screen walt is ringing a little bell but no sound comes out.}
<C>__{walt}
<D>__{don't worry! there's nothing wrong with your television set. this is a pixie bell, the sound is much too high for human ears.}
<A>__{tinkerbell flies into shot.}
<C>__{walt }
<D>__{oh there you are tink!}
<A>__{she covers walt in fairy dust.}
<C>__{walt }
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{hey! get that stuff off of me!}
<P>__{(to audience)}
<D>__{you know, a little sprinkling of fairy dust can make you fly!}
<A>__{pamela can't help but be drawn in for a tiny moment and then just as quickly, narrows her mistrusting eyes at walt and switches him off.}
<C>__{pamela}
<D>__{off! that's how we deal with you.}
