<L>__{interior stairway day}
<A>__{meanwhile, elvis huffs and puffs up a flight of stairs arriving at a set of swinging doors. he goes to push one in, but it swings out at him with a vengeance knocking him backward. from behind it pops hawk wielding a fire extinguisher. blast! a hail of foam covers elvis's face. hawk shoves the extinguisher into the man's arms and pushes elvis backwards down the stairs. he topples ass over head till he hits the landing.}

<D>__{you're way out of your league, elvis.}
<A>__{elvis rises and shakes the co2 off like a wet dog. looking up, he sees the door gently swinging in and out. no sign of hawk.}
