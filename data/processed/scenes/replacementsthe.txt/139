<A>__{shane rolls right and looks downfield. he holds the ball and keeps rolling. no one can get open. suddenly, lamont cuts in front of him and yells:}
<C>__{lamont}
<D>__{shane!}
<A>__{lamont sees an open lane and shane follows him. he eats up 15 yards before two defensive halfbacks close in. lamont throws an incredible block and takes out both guys. shane blows by and heads for the end zone. only a safety stands between shane and pay dirt.}
<B>__{close on shane}
<A>__{his side is killing him with every step he takes. when the safety moves up on him, shane panics and goes down in the same kind of slide that eddie martel did in the beginning. boom! the gun sounds and the half ends. shane sees redskin trainers running out onto the field. he turns and sees lamont rolling on the ground in pain as he holds his bad knee.}
