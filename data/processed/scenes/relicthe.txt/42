<L>__{interior new york city morgue evening}
<A>__{d'agosta and pendergast thread their way down a hall lined with bodies on gurneys. it's dark and quiet. they go into the autopsy room.}
<L>__{interior autopsy room afternoon}
<A>__{a large gurney, currently empty, sits like an uninvited guest under the bright lights of the autopsy suite. beside it is a tall, imposing doctor in her late 50's, with intense eyes. this is dr. ziewzic. with her are the photographer seen passing out at the museum, and a young intern, doctor gross.}
<C>__{dr. ziewzic}
<D>__{you're late, vince.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{sorry dr. ziewzic. this is special agent pendergast. pendergast, dr. ziewzic. she runs the best chop shop in new york.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{we've met. the hacksaw murders. '89.}
<C>__{dr. ziewzic}
<D>__{oh yes! who could forget. afterwards you sent me that amazing case of chateau lafitte.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{i hope you liked it.}
<C>__{dr. ziewzic}
<D>__{lovely bouquet. after our last case, vince took me out for a draft beer. as i recall we split the check.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<P>__{(grumbles)}
<D>__{it's been one of those days.}
<C>__{dr. ziewzic}
<P>__{(she snaps her rubber glove)}
<D>__{shall we get down to it, then?}
<A>__{dr. gross wheels the gurney over to the morgue bank and slides open a drawer. the shape under the plastic seems too small to be human. to the side of it is a large bump, presumably the head. the two pieces of cadaver are slid onto the gurney and wheeled under the lights. a stainless steel bucket is placed under the gurney's outlet pipe. dr. ziewzic fiddles with a microphone hanging above the body, she taps it and it gives off the proper static.}
<C>__{dr. ziewzic}
<P>__{(for the microphone)}
<D>__{this is dr. matilda ziewzic, assisted by dr. frederick gross. it's oct. 28, six fifteen p.m. we are joined by lieutenant vincent d'agosta of the nypd, special agent pendergast of the fbi and a police photographer. let's see what we've got.}
<A>__{they pull off the sheet and d'agosta swallows hard, closes his eyes to keep his stomach in check. the photographer goes green, but is determined not to clutch this time. pendergast leans closer, totally impassive. he puts on a small pair of wire rim glasses, assumes an expression much like a man reading a menu in a restaurant.}
<C>__{dr. ziewzic}
<D>__{caucasian male. age about 27. blond. height well i can't give a height because mr. beauregard has been decapitated. the state of the body is such that other identifying marks are out of the question. there are numerous lacerations proceeding from the left anterior pectoral downwards through the sternum and terminating in the abdomen. this is a massive wound, two feet long and a foot wide. the head has suffered severe trauma and the occipital portion of the calavarium has been crushed and removed. it almost looks like...}
<C>__{dr. gross}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{a bite.}
<A>__{ziewzic turns to pendergast.}
<C>__{dr. ziewzic}
<D>__{what are we talking about here?}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{someone who makes the hacksaw murderer look like mother teresa.}
<C>__{dr. ziewzic}
<D>__{right.}
<P>__{(back to work)}
<D>__{the entire brain appears to have been extracted. may i see it, please?}
<A>__{gross passes over a grey, watery mass that sits in a stainless steel pan. ziewzic studies beauregard's brain, or what's left of it...}
<C>__{dr. ziewzic}
<D>__{curious. there's something missing.}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{the thalamus and the hypothalamus, perhaps?}
<C>__{dr. ziewzic}
<P>__{(looks up, surprised)}
<D>__{yes. two organs the size of a walnut have been removed with what looks like surgical precision.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{what happened to them?}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{if you don't mind a suggestion, you might try a saliva test.}
<A>__{ziewzic, gross and d'agosta look at pendergast. the photographer is staring at the wall, silently mouthing multiplication tables to keep from woofing all over the place.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{saliva test? you mean, you think someone ate part of the brain?}
<C>__{pendergast}
<D>__{correct.}
<A>__{a long moment of silence, then... zwiezic uses a swab for the saliva test, puts the result in a petrie dish.}
<C>__{dr. zwiezic}
<D>__{okay. one saliva test. now... let's look at these lacerations. they start wide and then converge.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{long fingernails? scratches?}
<C>__{dr. zwiezic}
<D>__{too extreme. perhaps some kind of weapon. i'm now probing the wound and... there's a piece of foreign material deep in the muscle, lodged on a rib. photograph.}
<A>__{the photographer gathers his courage, steps forward with d'agosta and pendergast. zwiezic rinses the object off in a beaker of sterile water. it turns brownish red. she holds it up. they all stare in astonished silence. d'agosta swallows.}
<C>__{d'agosta}
<D>__{sweet jesus.}
<C>__{dr. zwiezic}
<D>__{it's a claw.}
<A>__{the photographer's flash goes off.}
