<A>__{mikhi the gangster is eating his dinner as gregor is ushered into the room. three thugs hang back behind gregor, watching to see what mikhi wants. now mikhi waves the thugs out of the room, leaving gregor alone with the gangster. mikhi takes a last few bites of dinner as he motions for gregor to sit.}

<P>__{(offering a cigarette)}
<D>__{would you like one?}
<C>__{gregor}
<P>__{(in english)}
<D>__{no, mikhi, i wouldn't.}
<P>__{(letting that sink in for a minute)}
<D>__{since i won't speak your language, and you can't speak mine, english will do nicely.}
<C>__{mikhi}
<P>__{(makes no never mind to him)}
<D>__{whatever you wish...}
<P>__{(lights his own cigarette)}
<D>__{this has all been a terrible mistake, gregor. i wanted to play straight with you, but edvard insisted we try and kill you.}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{edvard said the same thing about you before he died.}
<C>__{mikhi}
<D>__{i'm shocked, shocked to think that you'd believe him.}
<C>__{gregor}
<P>__{(suddenly sharp)}
<D>__{enough!}
<A>__{gregor raises the briefcase which is still attached to his wrist via the handcuff. gregor rests the briefcase on the table.}

<D>__{ahh...}
<A>__{the moment of truth. before this scene can develop any further, a voice comes from off screen, and as the voice speaks, gregor blanches.}
<C>__{seamus }
<D>__{the moment of truth, is it?}
<A>__{another angle deirdre and seamus have entered the room. and we notice something unusual: nobody is alarmed (except for gregor, that is). it's as if they were expected.}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{what is he doing here?}
<A>__{as seamus speaks he walks through the room, examining the valuable china and crystal, all the while moving inexorably closer to gregor. his face is, if anything, even more horrific than it was a short while ago, as his formerly fresh wounds have started to scab over.}
<C>__{seamus}
<D>__{what am i doing here? why, i'm here to see my partners, gregor, the boys in the russian mafia. see, your bosses had hoped to screw me by hiring you to pull your thieving double cross. but they only just found out that what's in the briefcase is completely useless without me. i can't fight them, and they can't kill me that means we're gonna have to do business together.}
<C>__{gregor}
<D>__{but you hate each other!}
<C>__{seamus}
<D>__{what's a little hate between business partners?}
