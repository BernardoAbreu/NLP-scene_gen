<A>__{becker is dressed to leave the hospital when he suddenly decides not to. he takes off his coat and his gloves, but not his scarf, and walks out of his office with a decided urgency.}

<A>__{becker pulls starks out of the drawer and looks down ruefully at starks' scathed face. starks, drenched in blood and sweat, seeks the outline of becker's face in the light.}
<D>__{starks [whispering] becker, i know about you. [beat] i know what you did to your patients.}
<A>__{becker looses the straps around starks' neck to help him speak.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{nathan...piechowski. [beat] jackson macgregor...ted casey. [beat] you didn't cure them. you killed them.}
<A>__{becker momentarily loses color and his forever cool mien. after some seconds, starks passes out and becker hands trembling looks as though he might stick him back in when, instead, he starts to remove him from the jacket himself. he silently and carefully unties each of the straps taking unusual care for starks' flesh as he prepares to put him on a stretcher.}
