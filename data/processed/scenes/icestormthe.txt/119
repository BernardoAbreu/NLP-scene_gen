<L>__{exterior street. evening}
<A>__{hood and wendy walk through a cold drizzling rain. he looks at her from time to time, then takes her arm.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{look, kiddo, don't worry about it. i really don't care that much. i'm just not sure he's good enough, that's all.}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i mean, he's not serious, he'll end up living off janey and jim, you watch. it's just that you develop a sense when you get older, if things are going to work out or if they won't, and sometimes it's not worth the mess...}
<A>__{she looks at him. they keep walking. she walks through a puddle.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{your toes cold?}
<C>__{wendy}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{he stops and lifts her in his arms.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i will carry you up the drive.}
<A>__{she puts her arms around his neck and he lifts her up. on her face, as he carries her a look of blank but real intimacy.}
