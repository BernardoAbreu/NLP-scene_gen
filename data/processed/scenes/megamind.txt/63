<L>__{exterior restaurant night}
<A>__{roxanne and john cusack are eating on the outside patio of a fancy restaurant.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{don't get me wrong, i love being a reporter. i don't think i could do anything else. it's the consequences of what we do that i'm having a problem with.}
<A>__{he listens intently as he refills her glass with wine.}
<D>__{"john cusack" that's where journalistic responsibility comes in, no?}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{it's supposed to. "john cusack" sounds to me like you're running from something.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{i got someone i cared about killed. if it wasn't for me, he wouldn't have been involved.}
<A>__{john suddenly gets a disturbed look in his eye, realizing what she's talking about. he reaches across the table and takes her hand.}
<D>__{"john cusack" you can't blame yourself. my father used to say each of us must answer the great call to truly feel alive.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{was he an actor? "john cusack" ...no. he was...a landscaper. and a horrible one. i mean he would fail time and time again at his...landscaping. and sometimes he'd get pretty beaten up or thrown in jail }
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{jail? "john cusack" my point is he took the good with the bad. he grew a little each time. improved, learned.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{was he ever successful? "john cusack" god, no...but don't let deter you.}
<A>__{roxanne laughs.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{thanks for this. you know, this is embarrassing, but it's been a long time since i }
<A>__{it's starting to lightly sprinkle. roxanne looks up.}
<C>__{roxanne }
<D>__{i think it's starting to rain. we might want to find a table inside. "john cusack" what were you gonna say?}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{oh, i was gonna say...it's been a long time since...well, i've been with someone i...enjoy being with.}
<A>__{john cusack smiles warmly and raises his glass for a toast.}
<D>__{"john cusack" to people who enjoy being with each other.}
<A>__{they go to clang glasses, when the rain suddenly causes john cusack's disguise generator to short. his true form of master mind is briefly revealed to roxanne as a bolt of electricity encircles his body. roxanne drops her glass and jumps out of her seat.}
<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{oh, no. don't look at me.}
<A>__{like a broken tv the image keeps switching between master}
<B>__{mind and john cusack.}
<A>__{as master mind starts to franticly slap at his watch, the cusack disguise begins to hold steady. he nonchalantly returns to cutting his steak.}
<D>__{"john cusack" okay, never mind that. now, where were we?}
<A>__{roxanne grabs his glass and throws the drink in his face, causing the generator to short out permanently. master mind now sits in his true blue form.}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{you're not gonna get all freaky about this, are you?}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{this...this is too much, even for you. god, i go out with you, tell you my innermost thoughts.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{i only did this because i wanted to talk to you on the same level. you know, without all the baggage?}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{baggage? you burned my boyfriend alive, you sick son of a bitch!}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{you see, that's exactly what i'm talking about.}
<A>__{roxanne starts to walk away.}
<C>__{master mind }
<D>__{roxanne!}
<C>__{roxanne}
<D>__{stay away from me.}
<A>__{master mind sinks back down to his chair. despite the now heavy rain bombarding him, he returns to his food. several resturaunt patron's are looking at him through the window. our villain turns to them, giving them a villainous glare.}
<C>__{master mind}
<D>__{what?}
