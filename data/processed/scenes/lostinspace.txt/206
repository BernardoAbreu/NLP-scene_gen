<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{john close. stirring to consciousness.}
<B>__{wider}
<L>__{interior jupiter two bridge future}
<A>__{or what is left of it. dark. the occasional computer panel flickers shattered monitors. an awful history told in torn metal. john is slumped in a corner, don still on the floor beside him.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{well, well. all things really do come to he who waits.}
<A>__{a figure sits in the command chair, visage obscured by shadow.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what is this place?}
<C>__{figure}
<D>__{why professor, the shock must have scrambled your brain. look around you. don't you recognize the spot? you've come home.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{this can't be...}
<A>__{but even as the words cross his lips, he knows it is.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{what have you done to the ship. ...where's my family?}
<C>__{figure}
<D>__{your family is dead. dead and in the ground.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{figure}
<D>__{what fickle consort in memory. time dims certain images while others shine clear and bright as yesterday.}
<A>__{the figure stands, light hitting his face. late thirties. long blond hair, a shaggy beard and moustache. eerily familiar.}
<C>__{figure}
<D>__{i will never forget that morning. twenty years ago. what was it you said? i will be back. i promise. but i knew better. you never came home.}
<A>__{the figure walks to one of the burned out panels.}
<C>__{figure}
<D>__{without you, your family never had a chance. a few spidersv survived the destruction of the probe ship. they reached the planet and attacked. i can still hear the women scream.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{who are you?}
<A>__{the figure walks forward, into the light. stands there a moment. then he lifts something hanging around his neck. tarnished metal, old but familiar. john's father's dog tags.}
<C>__{figure}
<D>__{don't you recognize me, dad? it's me. i'm your son. will.}
