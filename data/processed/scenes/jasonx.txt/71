<A>__{sven and kicker approach the door. casually, weapons slung low. the doors hiss open, the black maw of the game grid on the other side.}

<D>__{damn. are they playing?}
<C>__{sven}
<D>__{dallas?! azrael!}
<A>__{their combat sense perks up a bit. something's not right. they turn on their lights and ready their weapons.}

<A>__{wide: hard beams of light search for anything. sven, as his beam hits azrael's pod.}
<C>__{sven}
<D>__{oh shit.}
<A>__{from inside pod as sven and kicker approach. the blood splattered inside the glass glows in the throws of their lights. kicker breaks off to inspect the other pod sven tries to hold down his lunch.}
<C>__{sven}
<D>__{sarge, this is bad. the kid's his guts are ripped out.}
<C>__{brodski}
<P>__{(over radio)}
<D>__{dead?}
<C>__{sven}
<D>__{oh yeah.}
<A>__{kicker reaches the other pod. the darkness looms behind him as he finds his friend.}
<C>__{kicker}
<P>__{(into radio)}
<D>__{sarge, this is kicker. dallas got it to. real slice and dice. what should we do?}
