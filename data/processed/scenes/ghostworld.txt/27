<L>__{interior quality cafe day}
<A>__{enid & rebecca sit in their usual booth. rebecca is reading}
<B>__{the free weekly.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{that was truly pathetic.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i know... i still can't get over that his name was "seymour."}
<A>__{rebecca starts looking through the apartment listings. she takes a pen out of her purse.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{he was so excited when you bought that record you're a saint!... god, these apartments are super expensive...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{it was so cute how he had his own little bags. i thought i was going to start crying!... do you think they're gay?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{what about the "striking redhead in the yellow dress"?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{oh yeah...}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{he should totally just kill himself... hey, here's one}
<P>__{(circles it)}
<D>__{...oh wait...}
<P>__{(crosses it out)}
<D>__{you have to share it with a non smoking feminist and her two cats...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{i dunno... i kind of like him... he's the exact opposite of everything i really hate... in a way he's such a clueless dork that he's almost cool...}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{that guy is many things but he definitely isn't "cool"... this one would be okay, but there's no kitchen...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{yeah, but... you know what i mean.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{not really...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{forget it, i can't explain it...}
<A>__{awkward silence. melorra enters.}
<C>__{melorra}
<D>__{oh my god, what are you guys doing here?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{what are you doing here, melorra?}
<C>__{melorra}
<D>__{my acting workshop is across the street from here. i'm just on my break.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{well, we won't keep you.}
<C>__{melorra}
<D>__{i love this place... it's so you know, "funky."}
<A>__{enid and rebecca look at each other.}
<C>__{melorra}
<D>__{what are you guys up to?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{we're looking for an apartment.}
<C>__{melorra}
<D>__{god how cool. where are you moving?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{we're not sure yet, that's why we're looking.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{somewhere downtown.}
<C>__{melorra}
<D>__{god that's so exciting!}
<P>__{(looks at clock)}
<D>__{oops, i should go. bye you guys! call me.}
<A>__{melorra leaves quickly.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{"funky"?}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{what, is she black now?}
<A>__{they watch her cross the street she's dressed in expensive "casual" clothes with a fancy backpack.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{i've been thinking about when we look for our apartment how we have to try and convince people that we're like these totally rich yuppies...}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{that's who people want to rent to. it's a known fact that it's way easier to get a job and everything if you're rich... all we have to do is buy a few semi expensive outfits and act like it's no big deal... it'll be fun.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{you just want an excuse to dress like some stupid fashion model without me making fun of you.}
<C>__{rebecca}
<D>__{just promise you'll do it.}
<C>__{enid}
<D>__{okay, okay, i promise... jesus, you're out of your mind.}
