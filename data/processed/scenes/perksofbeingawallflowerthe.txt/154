<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{really? i thought your brother would have told you. it's a classic.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{so, lily comes here with this guy parker. and this was going to be the night they were going to lose their virginity. so, she did it really proper. she packed a picnic. stole a bottle of wine. everything was perfect, and they're just about to 'do it' when they realize they forgot the condoms. so, what do you think happened?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{they did it with one of the sandwich bags.}
<A>__{they start laughing and screaming.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{ew! that's disgusting!}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{yes! it is! let's keep the train rolling. suburban legends. charlie!}
<A>__{patrick points to charlie, who thinks...}

<D>__{uh. well... there was this girl named second base stace. she had boobs in the 4th grade }
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{mosquito bites. promising. go.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{and she let some of the boys feel them.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{that's your suburban legend? did you at least cop a feel?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{of course not. you went home, listened to "asleep," wrote a poem about her self esteem }
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{fine! okay. your turn.}
<A>__{patrick walks over and sits down next to charlie.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{yeah, i've got one. well, there was this one guy. queer as a 3 dollar bill. guy's father didn't know about his son. so, he comes down into the basement one night when he's supposed to be out of town. catches his son with another boy. so, he starts beating him. but not like the slap kind. like the real kind. and the boyfriend says, "stop. you're killing him." and the son just yells "get out." and eventually the boyfriend just did.}
<A>__{patrick stops. gripped by sad. he can't shake.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{why can't you save anybody?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{forget it. i'm free now, right? i could meet the love of my life any second now. things will be different now, and that's good. i just need to meet a good guy.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{patrick looks at him. charlie has never seen him so vulnerable. after a beat... patrick kisses charlie on the mouth. unsure of what to do, charlie lets it happen. his eyes open the whole time. a moment, then patrick looks at charlie. he collapses into his chest.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{it's alright.}
<A>__{charlie holds his friend as patrick begins to cry. and we leave them, the city lights small in the distance.}
