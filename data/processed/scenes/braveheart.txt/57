<A>__{we open on marion's grave, with the thistle carved marker, looking peaceful; but up the hill in the underbrush, english soldiers wait in ambush. edgy, they perk up at the sound of muffled hoofbeats then their eyes bug as a cloaked figure wallace suddenly looms up behind them, galloping and swirling fire! he hurls burning torches into the clustered soldiers, setting some of them on fire! meanwhile, hamish has crawled to marion's grave and is digging frantically. the new dirt parts easily and he pulls the shrouded body out, cringing with the effort. more soldiers rush from behind the rocks at the far side of the graveyard. wallace charges them, driving them back. he grabs the reins of hamish's horse, hidden among trees, and gallops to him. hamish hands the shrouded body up to william and bounds into the saddle of his own horse. they spur the horses and ride away, william clutching marion's shrouded body to his chest.}
