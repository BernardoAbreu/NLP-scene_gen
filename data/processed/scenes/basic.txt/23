<L>__{exterior fort mckinley parade grounds eight weeks ago}
<A>__{row upon row of freshly shaven headed cadets stand at attention. their first day of boot camp.}
<C>__{dunbar }
<D>__{first day was when i met pike. sarge hated him from the beginning.}
<A>__{a man with a face of granite strides up and down the lines. two ivory handled pistols on his hips. his lifeless cobalt blue eyes take in the cadets. this is sergeant west.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{you motherfuckers have just made the worst mistake of your lives! you have chosen to join my army! this army is my mother, my father, and my little virgin sister and i will not allow anyone or anything that is not up to my standards near her pretty little virgin cooze, do you understand me give me a sir, yes, sir!}
<C>__{the cadets}
<D>__{sir, yes, sir!}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{those who i deem unworthy to pass through this camp will quit, and those who refuse to quit i will kill. you ever hear of a training accident give me a sir, yes, sir!}
<C>__{the cadets}
<D>__{sir, yes, sir!}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{in my time i have killed sixteen men for the good of my country, sixteen men whose entrance into this army i could not condone, as it would weaken the fabric of this nation's defense! this base suffers an average of three training accidents a year, unfortunate incidents that i will not hesitate to repeat if you cross me, understand give me a sir, yes, sir!}
<C>__{the cadets}
<D>__{sir, yes, sir!}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{so forget what you've seen on sixty fucking minutes about the kinder, gentler military you will either succeed, quit, or die by my hand!}
<A>__{he walks over to a tall black cadet in the front row. pike.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{my power here is absolute, isn't that right, nigger?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{sir, yes, sir!}
<A>__{west hauls off and slaps pike across the face!}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{i hail from biloxi, mississippi where we string greasy coon necks up from tree branches when the mood strikes us you have a problem with that?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{sir, no, sir!}
<A>__{west grabs pike by the neck, choking him. the others cadets gasp. pike goes down on his knees, the loss of air is so great. he reaches up automatically to try and save himself...}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{what the fuck is this? you lay a hand on me while i'm trying to do my duty and rid the world of you?}
<A>__{he kicks pike in the balls and releases him. pike goes fetal on the ground, vomiting, as west stands over him, screaming.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{get the fuck up, you're still in formation, get the fuck up!}
<A>__{pike somehow gets to his feet, vomit streaking his clothes.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{what the fuck have you done to that uniform, take it off, take it off, take it off!}
<A>__{pike, still gasping, can't move fast enough. west slaps him again and tears the man's shirt off.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{get those fucking pants off, i want you buck ass naked, you don't deserve to wear these beautiful united states army issue clothes!}
<A>__{pike struggles off the rest of his clothes until he is naked. west turns and spies dunbar in the line.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{cadet, what's your name!}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{sir, dunbar, sir!}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{you know how to work a pistol, dunbar?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{sir, yes, sir!}
<A>__{west draws one of his pistols and gives it to him.}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{dunbar you are to stand here and guard this nigger for the next twenty four hours! he is not to be given food, water, or clothes! if he so much as moves, you are to blow his nigger brains out, is that clear?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{sir, yes, sir!}
<C>__{west}
<D>__{the rest of you, fallout for physicals!}
<A>__{the rest of the cadets fallout, following west away to one of the buildings, leaving dunbar and pike. one with a gun, the other naked.}
