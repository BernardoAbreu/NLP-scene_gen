<A>__{a german submariner, on the conning tower, seeing the tugboat, turns the .50 caliber machine gun on the tugboat... benjamin is grazed by a bullet, his forehead cut open, bleeding... despite the strafing the tug is relentless... the submarine, seeing it is about to be rammed tries to dive... but it's too late... the tugboat ramming the submarine... severing the u boat in half. the concussion of the collision has triggered a torpedo in the sinking submarine's torpedo shaft, the torpedo exploding, bursting the submarine, and in the process, blasting away under the stern of the tugboat... the men on the stern blown to pieces... benjamin's literally thrown against the wheel house... he manages to get to his feet, the tug listing, beginning to sink... there's a man's voice... and he sees, captain mike riddled with bullets, his body covered with blood... benjamin bends to him... captain mike trembling as he lays dying...}
