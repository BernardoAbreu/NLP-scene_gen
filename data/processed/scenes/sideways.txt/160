<A>__{under black, superimposed }
<B>__{friday}
<A>__{now comes the sound of hysterical knocking.}
<L>__{interior motel room dawn}
<A>__{despite the knocking, miles remains motionless in bed, his expression serene. finally he awakens and drags himself toward the door, opening it to find }
<B>__{jack}
<A>__{silhouetted against the first rosy fingers of dawn. he is barefoot. in fact he is clad only in his underwear. hugging himself, he pants and shivers.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{jesus fucking christ, it's freezing.}
<A>__{he limps past miles, yanks off the bed covers and wraps them around himself.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{vicodin. where's the vicodin? my nose.}
<A>__{miles hands him the bottle, and jack frantically pops a couple of pills, chewing them like candy. he sits down and bends over at the waist as though preparing for an airplane crash.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{fucking chick's married.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{her husband works a night shift or something, and he comes home, and i'm on the floor with my cock in his wife's ass.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{jesus, jack. jesus. and you walked all the way back from solvang?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{ran. twisted my ankle too.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{that's five clicks, jackson.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{fucking a it's five clicks! at one point i had to cut through an ostrich farm. fuckers are mean.}
<A>__{miles has now awakened to take in the absurdity of the whole scene, and he laughs hard. the blanketed bulge just sits there. finally it looks up and shows its pitiful visage.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{we gotta go back.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i left my wallet. my credit cards, cash, fucking id, everything. we gotta go back.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{big deal. we'll call right now and cancel your cards.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you don't understand. the wedding bands. the wedding bands are in my wallet.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{okay, so they were in your wallet, and you left your wallet somewhere. some bar. christine'll understand.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no. she ordered them special. took her forever to find them. they've got this design on them with dolphins and our names engraved in sanskrit. we've got to go back. christine'll fucking crucify me.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{no way. no way.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(a pitiful whine)}
<D>__{please, miles, please.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{forget it. your wallet was stolen at a bar. happens every day.}
<A>__{jack stares straight ahead, breathing through his mouth as he considers this. then }
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no, we've got to get my wallet! those rings are irreplaceable! we've got to get them, miles! i fucked up! i know i fucked up, okay? i fucked up. you gotta help me. you gotta help me. pleeeease!}
<A>__{jack now descends to a level of wretchedness and desperation that miles has never seen before in jack, or in anyone else for that matter.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh, god, please... oh god. i know i'm bad. i know i did a bad thing. help me, miles. just this one thing, this one last thing. i can't lose christine. i can't. i'm nothing without her. please, miles, please... uuuuu... uuuuuu.... uuuuuuu......}
<A>__{no longer able to form words, jack is reduced to emitting low, primitive sounds. snot flows from beneath his bandaged nose.}
