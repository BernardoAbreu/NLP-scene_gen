<A>__{a distraught cathy is walking down as burke bounds up.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{you look down.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{i am.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{thank you. i appreciate the support.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{i'm not down for you. i'm down about myself.}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(not hearing)}
<D>__{oh. what if 'ground zero' doesn't do well this weekend?}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{please listen to me.}
<A>__{he nods, but she pauses, disconcerted.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{i just got this feeling of seeing myself talking to you and how this is the most important moment of... ever.}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(brusquely)}
<D>__{okay. good. what is it?}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{i've been watching this company make movies that cost tens of millions of dollars and all the while i've known about this wonderful script which we can somehow own and we could make for about $14,000,000... $3,000,000 if you can live without stars or a name director.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{is that it? okay, send me...}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{i've sent you coverage on it nine times. i swear to you, burke, it will work. you've never heard me say that.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{how about last night?}
<C>__{cathy}
<P>__{(an unexpectedly fierce outburst)}
<D>__{i don't know anything about action adventure!!}
<P>__{(on his look, she gains control)}
<D>__{i have no idea where that came from. hey, i know everyone thinks i don't have any commercial sense because of what i said at the 'gremlins' preview and all... and you think i can't put myself on the line. well, if this picture doesn't work, fire me. have me killed if it doesn't get good reviews. if this doesn't get a 70 percent definite recommend from women 49 and under, i promise to be your sex slave until they drop ticket prices back to five bucks and start enforcing the r rating.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{you're selling very excellent. very excellent presentation.}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{you've got to do this. i think this movie can save me.}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(disgusted)}
<D>__{oh, please... what's the script?}
<C>__{cathy}
<D>__{'mr. deeds goes to town.'}
