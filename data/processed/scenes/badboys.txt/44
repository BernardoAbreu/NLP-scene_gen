<L>__{interior heroin locker day}
<A>__{another torched lock noted as burnett and lowrey enter with sanchez an ruiz behind them. the room is emptied. captain howard appears. he's short, has a military haircut, and has a minor napoleon complex and a major in paranoia.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{nice of you to roll in. and nothing particular is going on around here except, maybe, your dope is gone. that's right. the biggest dope bust in the history of this department up and walked out of this locker, along with maybe my job and the two of yours if we don't get the shit back.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{this can't be happening.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{so here's what we're gonna do. since it was originally your case, you two guys are on pointerior sanchez and ruiz, you back them up with whatever they need.}
<A>__{groans all around.}
<C>__{lowrey}
<D>__{so i guess we should start with the c.i.s and the perps from the original case. but hell if i know any dope dealers with the balls to pull this off. they're either dead or in the lock up pending trial.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{how's o'fee?}
<C>__{sinclair }
<D>__{oh, he'll be just fine.}
<A>__{from the side appears a cigar chewing internal affairs suit named sinclair. he circles close to burnett and lowrey, waving his cigar as he speaks.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{name's sinclair. internal affairs. he's our new proctologist.}
<C>__{sinclair}
<D>__{you see, what's got me confused is, why risk leaving a witness? why not kill o'fee instead?}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{because maybe this guy knows if you kill a cop the whole department'll get up his ass hard and fast.}
<C>__{sinclair}
<D>__{and who knows that better than anybody else? cops.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{you're not sayin' this was an inside job. cops wouldn't pull this shit.}
<C>__{sinclair}
<D>__{not just cops. narcotic cops. for example, the s.n.d. you've got access. you've got wherewithall. and most importantly, you've got the connections. who else would know how to unload a hundred million dollars worth of heroin?}
<C>__{lowrey}
<D>__{hey, fuck you and your cheap, off the rack suit.}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{enough. i.a.'s in it and there's nothing we can do about it. if any of this leaks, the shit's gonna hit our biggest fan. remember him? the mayor? he created us and you can bet your jobs, boys, he'll rip us into little cop pieces. i figure we got seventy two hours to find the dope and keep our jobs.}
<C>__{lowrey}
<D>__{nothing like a little old fashioned incentive.}
<B>__{close on burnett}
<A>__{he walks to the center of the room and kneels to those four bolt holes in the floor. he fingers the paraffin filler, then looks above to the air conditioning grate.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{what about the air conditioning?}
<C>__{howard}
<D>__{so what about it?}
<C>__{burnett}
<P>__{(to lowrey)}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{lowrey}
<D>__{i think you should go ahead, crawl up and give it a good look.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{why me?}
<C>__{lowrey}
<D>__{for one, it was your idea. two, while my suit's fresh, you're dressed for the occasion.}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{don't say nothin' about my clothes. i paid for these.}
<C>__{lowrey}
<D>__{and i don't?}
<C>__{burnett}
<D>__{not on a cop's salary.}
