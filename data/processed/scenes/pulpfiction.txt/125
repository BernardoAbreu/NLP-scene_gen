<L>__{interior coffee shop morning}
<A>__{cash register drawer opens. pumpkin stuffs the money from the till in his pocket. then walks from behind the counter with a trash bag in his hand.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{okay people, i'm going to go 'round and collect your wallets. don't talk, just toss 'em in the bag. we clear?}
<A>__{pumpkin goes around collecting wallets. jules sits with his .45 ready to spit under the table. pumpkin sees jules sitting in his booth, holding his wallet, briefcase next to him. pumpkin crosses to him, his tone more respectful, him manner more on guard.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{in the bag.}
<A>__{jules drops his wallet in the bag. using his gun as a pointer, pumpkin points to the briefcase.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{what's in that?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{my boss' dirty laundry.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{you boss makes you do his laundry?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{when he wants it clean.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{sounds like a shit job.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{funny, i've been thinkin' the same thing.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{open it up.}
<A>__{jules' free hand lays palm flat on the briefcase.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{'fraid i can't do that.}
<A>__{pumpkin is definitely surprised by his answer. he aims the gun right in the middle of jules' face and pulls back the hammer.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{i didn't hear you.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{yes, you did.}
<A>__{this exchange has been kind of quiet, not everybody heard it, but honey bunny senses something's wrong.}
<C>__{honey bunny}
<D>__{what's goin' on?}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{looks like we got a vigilante in our midst.}
<C>__{honey bunny}
<D>__{shoot 'em in the face!}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{i don't mean to shatter your ego, but this ain't the first time i've had gun pointed at me.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{you don't open up that case, it's gonna be the last.}
<C>__{manager}
<P>__{(on the ground)}
<D>__{quit causing problems, you'll get us all killed! give 'em what you got and get 'em out of here.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{keep your fuckin' mouth closed, fat man, this ain't any of your goddamn business!}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{i'm countin' to three, and if your hand ain't off that case, i'm gonna unload right in your fuckin' face. clear? one...}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{...two... three.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{you win.}
<A>__{jules raises his hand off the briefcase.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{it's all yours, ringo.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{open it.}
<A>__{jules flips the locks and opens the case, revealing it to pumpkin but not to us. the same light shines from the case. pumpkin's expression goes to amazement. honey bunny, across the room, can't see shit.}
<C>__{honey bunny}
<D>__{what is it? what is it?}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{is that what i think it is?}
<A>__{jules nods his head: "yes."}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{it's beautiful.}
<A>__{jules nods his head: "yes."}
<C>__{honey bunny}
<D>__{goddammit, what is it?}
<A>__{jules slams the case closed, then sits back, as if offering the case to pumpkin. pumpkin, one big smile, bends over to pick up the case. like a rattlesnake, jules' free hand grabs the wrist of pumpkin's gun hand, slamming it on the table. his other hand comes from under the table and sticks the barrel of his .45 hand under pumpkin's chin. honey bunny freaks out, waving her gun in jules' direction.}
<C>__{honey bunny}
<D>__{let him go! let him go! i will blow your fuckin' head off! i will kill ya! i will kill ya! you're gonna die, you're gonna fuckin' die bad!}
<C>__{jules}
<P>__{(to pumpkin)}
<D>__{tell that bitch to be cool! say, bitch be cool! say, bitch be cool!}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{chill out, honey!}
<C>__{honey bunny}
<D>__{let him go!}
<C>__{jules}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{tell her it's gonna be okay.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{i'm gonna be okay.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{promise her.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{i promise.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{tell her to chill.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{just chill out.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{what's her name?}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{yolanda.}
<A>__{whenever jules talks to yolanda, he never looks at her, only at pumpkin.}
<C>__{jules}
<P>__{(to yolanda)}
<D>__{so, we cool yolanda? we ain't gonna do anything stupid, are we?}
<C>__{yolanda}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{don't you hurt him.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{nobody's gonna hurt anybody. we're gonna be like three fonzies. and what' fonzie like?}
<A>__{no answer.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{c'mon yolanda, what's fonzie like?}
<C>__{yolanda}
<P>__{(through tears, unsure)}
<D>__{he's cool?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{correct amundo! and that's what we're gonna be, we're gonna be cool.}
<P>__{(to pumpkin)}
<D>__{now ringo, i'm gonna count to three and i want you to let go your gun and lay your palms flat on the table. but when you do it, do it cool. ready?}
<A>__{pumpkin looks at him.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{one... two... three.}
<A>__{pumpkin lets go of his gun and places both hands on the table. yolanda can't stand it anymore.}
<C>__{yolanda}
<D>__{okay, now let him go!}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{yolanda, i thought you were gonna be cool. when you yell at me, it makes me nervous. when i get nervous, i get scared. and when motherfuckers get scared, that's when motherfuckers get accidentally shot.}
<C>__{yolanda}
<P>__{(more conversational)}
<D>__{just know: you hurt him, you die.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{that seems to be the situation. now i don't want that and you don't want that and ringo here don't want that. so let's see what we can do.}
<P>__{(to ringo)}
<D>__{now this is the situation. normally both of your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken. but you happened to pull this shit while i'm in a transitional period. i don't wanna kill ya, i want to help ya. but i'm afraid i can't give you the case. it don't belong to me. besides, i went through too much shit this morning on account of this case to just hand it over to your ass.}
<C>__{vincent }
<D>__{what the fuck's goin' on here?}
<A>__{yolanda whips her gun toward the stranger. vincent, by the bathroom, has his gun out, dead aimed at yolanda.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{it's cool, vincent! it's cool! don't do a goddamn thing. yolanda, it's cool baby, nothin's changed. we're still just talkin'.}
<P>__{(to pumpkin)}
<D>__{tell her we're still cool.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{it's cool, honey bunny, we're still cool.}
<C>__{vincent}
<P>__{(gun raised)}
<D>__{what the hell's goin' on, jules?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{nothin' i can't handle. i want you to just hang back and don't do shit unless it's absolutely necessary.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{check.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{yolanda, how we doin, baby?}
<C>__{yolanda}
<D>__{i gotta go pee! i want to go home.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{just hang in there, baby, you're doing' great, ringo's proud of you and so am i. it's almost over.}
<P>__{(to pumpkin)}
<D>__{now i want you to go in that bag and find my wallet.}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{which one is it?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{it's the one that says bad motherfucker on it.}
<A>__{pumpkin looks in the bag and sure enough there's a wallet with "bad motherfucker" embroidered on it.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{that's my bad motherfucker. now open it up and take out the cash. how much is there?}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{about fifteen hundred dollars.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{put it in your pocket, it's yours. now with the rest of them wallets and the register, that makes this a pretty successful little score.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{jules, if you give this nimrod fifteen hundred buck, i'm gonna shoot 'em on general principle.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{you ain't gonna do a goddamn thing, now hang back and shut the fuck up. besides, i ain't givin' it to him. i'm buyin' somethin' for my money. wanna know what i'm buyin' ringo?}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{your life. i'm givin' you that money so i don't hafta kill your ass. you read the bible?}
<C>__{pumpkin}
<D>__{not regularly.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{there's a passage i got memorized. ezekiel 25:17. "the path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of the darkness. for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. and i will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. and you will know i am the lord when i lay my vengeance upon you." i been sayin' that shit for years. and if you ever heard it, it meant your ass. i never really questioned what it meant. i thought it was just a coldblooded thing to say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped a cap in his ass. but i saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice. now i'm thinkin', it could mean you're the evil man. and i'm the righteous man. and mr. .45 here, he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. or is could by you're the righteous man and i'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish. i'd like that. but that shit ain't the truth. the truth is you're the weak. and i'm the tyranny of evil men. but i'm tryin'. i'm tryin' real hard to be a shepherd.}
<A>__{jules lowers his gun, lying it on the table. pumpkin looks at him, to the money in his hand, then to yolanda. she looks back. grabbing the trash bag full of wallets, the two run out the door. jules, who was never risen from his seat the whole time, takes a sip of coffee.}
<C>__{jules}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{it's cold.}
<A>__{he pushes it aside. vincent appears next to jules.}
<C>__{vincent}
<D>__{i think we oughta leave now.}
<C>__{jules}
<D>__{that's probably a good idea.}
<A>__{vincent throws some money on the table and jules grabs the briefcase. then, to the amazement of the patrons, the waitresses, the cooks, the bus boys, and the manager, these two bad ass dudes wearing uc santa cruz and "i'm with stupid" tee shirts, swim trunks, thongs and packing .45 automatics walk out of the coffee shop together without saying a word.}
