<L>__{exterior desert road, morocco day}
<D>__{the bus is in the middle of the road. several of the tourists are hiding under their seats, frightened. the driver, still ducking, looks toward the mountains to try to piece together what happened. richard holds susan against his shoulder, blood gushing from her neck. her eyes are open and staring at a fading world. richard takes susan from under her armpits and carefully lays her down on the aisle. anwar runs over to help.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{take it easy honey, take it easy. anwar takes his shirt off left only in his undershirt and puts it under susan's neck.}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(mumbling senselessly)}
<D>__{i'm ok... i'm ok... susan breathes in, and every time she does, blood flows from her wound. richard turns toward the other passengers.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{is anybody a doctor? nobody answers. richard starts to lose his cool.}
<C>__{richard }
<D>__{please: a doctor. the pensioners don't answer; they are too scared. richard opens susan's purse and sees a cell phone. he turns it on and tries to call, but there is no signal. he turns to anwar.}
<C>__{richard }
<D>__{where's the nearest hospital?}
<C>__{anwar}
<D>__{it's far away, about four hours.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{there's a clinic that's a little closer, about an hour and a half to the south. by bus it'll take us about two hours and a half though.}
<C>__{richard}
<D>__{does that takes away from marrakesh?}
<C>__{anwar}
<D>__{yes, but it's the closest thing we've got. richard runs down the aisle and gets out of the bus.}
