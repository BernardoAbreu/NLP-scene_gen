<L>__{interior isolation cell}
<A>__{black screen. there is a scraping sound and light appears as a cement block is removed at floor level. de fravio's face appears in the rectangular hole.}
<C>__{de fravio}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{hey, brewer. you okay?}
<A>__{brewer crawls stiffly to the opening, squinting at the glare.}
<C>__{brewer}
<P>__{(hoarsely)}
<D>__{i could use a beer.}
<L>__{exterior guard barracks cell}
<A>__{the cement block wall of the cells adjoins the raised wooden barracks. de fravio and jensen have belly crawled beneath the building to the cell, where they have long used a loosened block to communicate with prisoners in "the hole."}
<C>__{de fravio}
<D>__{your buddy made it out last night. the place went apeshit.}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{really? how come he didn't take me?}
<C>__{de fravio}
<D>__{maybe because you're shot in the leg.}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{oh, yeah. listen, how long do they keep you in this disease hole?}
<C>__{jensen}
<D>__{who knows? i was in there for a month once. de fravio did three months.}
<C>__{brewer}
<D>__{how do you keep from coming unglued?}
<C>__{jensen}
<D>__{concentrate on a problem. like, i built my dream house in my head, brick by brick. board by board. if something really takes a day, i thought about it for a whole day. like that.}
<C>__{de fravio}
<D>__{i built a shopping mall.}
<C>__{jensen}
<P>__{(urgently)}
<D>__{guards. see ya.}
<A>__{they slide the block into place and brewer sits in front of it, coughing to hide the scrape as the door is opened by two guards. morning light blasts in, blinding him, as one guard hauls him roughly to his feet, despite his wounded leg.}
<C>__{brewer}
<P>__{(menacingly)}
<D>__{watch it. don't fuck with me, man!}
<P>__{(jerks a thumb at himself)}
<D>__{i'm dinky dau!}
<A>__{the guards guffaw and drag him off.}
