<L>__{interior wheeler bathroom night.}
<A>__{frank splashes water on his face like a boxer between rounds. he looks up at his reflection. he reaches for a towel, but there isn't one. he turns to the shelf behind him and pulls down a fresh towel. something catches his eye. he reaches to the back and retrieves a small brown paper package. he opens it, his face slowly registering what it means...}
<L>__{interior wheeler family room night.}
<A>__{april wheels around as frank storms in, a rubber syringe in his hand.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what the hell are you going to do with this?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{and what do you think you're going to do? you're going to stop me?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{you're damn right!}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{go ahead and try!}
<A>__{he comes at her across the room with the syringe in his hand. she moves away.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{listen. listen to me. you do this you do this and i swear to god i will }
<C>__{april}
<D>__{you'll what? you'll leave me? is that a threat, or a promise?}
<A>__{he shakes it in her face.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{when did you buy this, april? i want to know!}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{you know you really are being melodramatic about the whole thing. as long as it's done in the first twelve weeks, it's perfectly safe.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{that's now april! don't i get a say?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{of course you do! it would be for you, frank, don't you see? so you can have time. like we talked about.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{how can it be for me if the thought makes my stomach turn over?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{then it's for me... tell me we can have the baby in paris, frank. but don't make me stay here. please.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{we can't have the baby in paris.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{why not? i don't need everything we have here. i don't care where we live! i mean who made these rules, anyway? the only reason we moved out here was because i got pregnant. then we had another child to prove the first one wasn't a mistake. i mean how long does it go on?}
<A>__{he turns away.}
<C>__{april }
<D>__{frank. do you actually want another child? well, do you?}
<A>__{he won't answer.}
<C>__{april }
<D>__{come on, tell me. tell me the truth, frank. remember that? we used to live by it. you know what's so good about the truth? everyone knows what it is, however long they've lived without it. no one forgets the truth, frank, they just get better at lying. so tell me: do you really want another child?}
<A>__{frank turns towards her.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{all i know is what i feel. and anyone else in their right mind would feel the same way.}
<C>__{april}
<P>__{(quiet)}
<D>__{but i've had two children. doesn't that count in my favor?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{christ! the fact that you even put it that way! you make it sound like having children is a punishment.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{i love my children.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{and you're sure about that?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{what the hell is that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{april, you just said our daughter was mistake. how do i know you didn't try to get rid of her, or michael for that matter? how do i know you didn't try to flush our entire fucking family down the toilet?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{no that's not true. of course i didn't.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{but how do i know april?}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{stop. please just stop, frank.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{april, a normal woman, a normal sane mother doesn't buy herself a piece of rubber tubing to give herself an abortion so she can, go live out some god damn fantasy.}
<A>__{april's face.}
<C>__{frank }
<P>__{(sober)}
<D>__{all i'm saying is you don't seem entirely rational about this thing... and maybe we should get someone to help you think about it.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{...and the new job's going to pay for that too?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{april if you need a shrink, it'll be paid for. obviously.}
<A>__{april turns to the book shelves. her back to him. frank waits, his heart beating quickly.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{...okay. i guess there isn't much more to say, then, is there?}
<A>__{her eyes are bright with tears.}
<C>__{april }
<D>__{so i guess paris was a pretty childish idea, huh?}
<A>__{everything hangs on frank's answer...}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i guess maybe it was.}
<A>__{april closes her eyes. tears run down her cheeks. he walks over to her, but he doesn't touch her.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{we can be happy here april... i can make you happy here.}
<A>__{she cries quietly.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{we've had a great few months. it doesn't have to end...}
<A>__{she turns to face him.}
<C>__{frank }
<D>__{we're going to be okay.}
<C>__{april}
<D>__{i hope so frank. i really hope so.}
