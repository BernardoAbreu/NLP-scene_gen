<L>__{exterior motel second floor night}
<A>__{...smack into cougar who points into the sky two heavily armed cobras, searchlights on, headed for the motel. and again with that one important word:}
<C>__{cougar}
<D>__{run.}
<A>__{the first cobra opens up with it's automatic cannon. the bullets chewing up the far side of the cheap two story motel! our guys vault the railing, sprinting to the van...}
<L>__{interior van night}
<A>__{pooch, sliding behind the wheel as the others pile in...}
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{go, go, go!}
<A>__{pooch hits the gas before his door is even shut. as they peel out of the parking lot the strafing hits the gas main whoomp! half the motel swallowed in a fireball...}
<C>__{pooch}
<D>__{think that got her?}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{she ain't that lucky. jensen, status!}
<C>__{jensen}
<D>__{my dick remains unshot!}
<A>__{roque, looking out the back window:}
<C>__{roque}
<D>__{here they come...}
<A>__{sure enough, the cobras are now tracking the van. spotlights, swinging towards them... the asphalt behind them erupts. cannon fire blowing huge chunks of road into the sky! screaming over the sound:}
<C>__{clay}
<D>__{somebody shoot something!}
<A>__{cougar hefts his rifle. setting up shop in the back. sighting the choppers through his scope. jensen, excited, and a little delirious from blood loss:}
<C>__{jensen}
<D>__{i think cougar's got a plan! coug, do you have a plan?}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{he's got a plan!}
<C>__{pooch}
<P>__{(trying to steer)}
<D>__{stop yelling at the sniper!}
<A>__{through the scope cougar sights the tail rotor of the chopper on the left... smiles, presses the trigger... and we see how one bullet can bring down two helicopters. the bullet strikes the tail rotor dead center it shorts and spins off sending the chopper itself into a spin colliding with it's twin chopper on the right they both twist and hink up their rotors slicing into each other both finally careening onto the freeway behind our guys. driving away from the carnage of two exploding cobra helicopters splattered across the road... safe.}
