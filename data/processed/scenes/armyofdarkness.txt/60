<A>__{his face vibrates like jello until it finally snaps back to normal.}
<C>__{ash}
<D>__{woah. wrong book.}
<A>__{he turns to study...}
<B>__{the two remaining books ash}
<A>__{tries to decide between them. at first he's sure which one it is. then, chiding himself for being so easily duped, chooses the other.}
<B>__{the book}
<A>__{moves ever so slightly as he reaches for it.}
<C>__{ash}
<D>__{huh.}
<A>__{ash reaches for it again and the book bites him! the book of the dead puppet rodent teeth have appeared on the surface of the book. the book flaps it's pages and becomes airborne, flying right at camera like a bat! batbook p.o.v. camera rig undercranked swooping erratically around ash's head.}
<B>__{the batbook}
<A>__{shrieking, chases ash around, pecking at his neck.}
<C>__{ash}
<D>__{dear god, help me... ahhh!!!}
<A>__{the batbook is pecking at his eyes!}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{pulls it from his face and throws it. it lands back on it's pedestal.}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{faces the remaining book. he slowly reaches for it as the wind kicks up. ash gently lifts it and turns it over.}
<B>__{close on book}
<A>__{it's cover is bound in the dried skin of a man's face! two empty eye sockets stare out from it. this is the book of the dead...}

<D>__{okay. the words. say the words. klatoo!... verata... uh... uh... necta... uh... nectar... necktie... uh...}
<A>__{he hesitates, then calls out boldly.}
<C>__{ash}
<D>__{klatoo... verata... necttphhhhhhhhhh...}
<A>__{he deliberately muffles the last word that he can't remember. the wind stops. it seems to have worked. he looks about with growing confidence.}
<C>__{ash}
<D>__{okay then.}
<A>__{but he loses his smile as... a low rumble is heard on the soundtrack. long shot cemetary}
<B>__{ash}
<A>__{a tiny figure among the gravestones which tremble and one by one are thrust from the earth.}
<C>__{ash}
<D>__{hey, wait a minute. everything's cool! i said the words! i did!}
