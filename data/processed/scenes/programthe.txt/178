<D>__{all right, defense. let's get evil. kill 'em all, let the paramedics sort 'em out.}
<L>__{exterior wolf den stadium afternoon}
<A>__{georgia tech has the ball. they break their huddle.}
<C>__{harvey }
<D>__{1:11 and counting. third and one. the wolves have got to stop them on this play if they're gonna get the ball back. a first down here and it's all she wrote. e.s.u. is out of timeouts.}
<A>__{the georgia tech quarterback fakes to his fullback, hands off to his tailback on the countertrap. the tailback runs behind his big, pulling tackle, both right at lattimer. lattimer takes on the tackle, sheds his block. the back lowers his head, starts to power into lattimer. lattimer lets out a fierce yell. smash! lattimer explodes into the tailback, the collision lifting the back off the ground, whiplashing his neck, vibrating his helmet. lattimer's legs churn, driving the tailback back and into the ground. we see the back's face. there are snot bubbles in his nose. no first down. no way. lattimer jabs both arms in the air. the crowd goes nuts, as the defense slaps helmets, and runs off the field, windmilling their arms, whipping up the crowd.}
<B>__{angle on sideline}
<A>__{winters congratulates the defense as it comes off the field. he meets lattimer, looks into his eyes. sees the steroids there. he knows it's the only way the kid could have done it. decides not to bust him. lattimer knows it. winters gives his helmet a little slap, more in sympathy than praise.}
<B>__{angle on the yellow jacket punter}
<A>__{he catches the snap, boots the ball away. darnell fields it at his 12, starts toward the right sideline, where hemmed in, he looks like dead meat. suddenly, he reverses his field, racing for the opposite sideline, where a picket line of blockers awaits him, if he can get there. he turns on the jets, barely beating two tacklers to the corner, and then turns it up the left sideline, picking up a wicked series of crack back blocks, until he's finally run out of bounds at the yellow jacket 35 yard line.}

<A>__{the e.s.u. fans are on their feet. winters races over to joe.}
<C>__{winters}
<D>__{time for 2 plays. if it's not open in the end zone, take the sideline. as the offense runs onto the field, winters checks the scoreboard. 17 seconds left. georgia tech 10. e.s.u.}
