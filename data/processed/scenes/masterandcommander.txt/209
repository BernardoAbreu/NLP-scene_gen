<L>__{209. quarterdeck forecastle tops day}
<A>__{the ship fairly bristles with telescopes.}
<L>__{210. forecastle}
<A>__{a small group of familiar faces share a pocket telescope.}
<C>__{higgins }
<D>__{can't see any wimmun. just lots of ducks and lizards.}
<A>__{doudle takes the telescope.}
<C>__{doudle}
<D>__{wot? there must be wimmun. t'ain't natural.}
<L>__{211. quarterdeck}
<A>__{stephen and blakeney side by side. from both their faces we sense their wonder at seeing these remarkable creatures for the first time.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{how extraordinary.}
<C>__{blakeney}
<D>__{what, sir?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{those birds!}
<A>__{he's looking at a group of unremarkable black seabirds waddling about on a rock, flapping short, stumpy wings.}
<C>__{stephen }
<D>__{a species of cormorant. but apparently flightless, by all that's holy. i believe that is unknown to science.}
<A>__{blakeney dwells briefly on the strange rock climbing birds then drifts back to the iguanas.}
<C>__{blakeney}
<D>__{the dragons don't seem to bother 'em.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{they are a type of iguana i should think, and therefore vegetarian.}
<A>__{his telescope remains focussed on the cormorants. blakeney is wholly absorbed in the iguanas.}
<C>__{blakeney}
<D>__{will you catch one?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{yes. most certainly. and if we can, some eggs.}
<C>__{blakeney}
<D>__{i mean the great lizards.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{oh!}
<A>__{recognizing how superficially dull the birds are to blakeney's untutored eye, by contrast with giant lizards.}
<C>__{stephen }
<D>__{i should think a pair of them. then you can present one of their offspring to the king.}
<C>__{bonden}
<D>__{ha! there's one going for a swim.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{no. iguanas are land animals.}
<C>__{bonden}
<D>__{not these ones.}
<A>__{the prehistoric looking creatures, as if suddenly awakened, begin diving into the water.}
<C>__{stephen }
<D>__{by jove bonden you are right! two new species in as many minutes.}
<A>__{he breaks off, suddenly aware of a shouted exchange between the lookout and the quarterdeck.}
<C>__{stephen }
<D>__{what is all that confounded bellowing?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{all hands about ship!}
<A>__{blakeney dashes off and stephen is elbowed out of the way by hands rushing to get at the sails.}
<C>__{nehemiah slade}
<D>__{by your leave sir, by your leave.}
<C>__{hollar }
<D>__{helms a'lee off tacks and sheets mainsail haul!}
<A>__{as the ship turns a distant whaleboat appears with six men aboard, pulling out from one of the neighboring islands.}
