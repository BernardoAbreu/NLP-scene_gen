<D>__{all of her pain, top. thirty hours. all at once...}
<A>__{eric bears down on top dollar again. top screams. blood begins to leak from his eyes, nose, ears.}
<C>__{eric }
<D>__{...all for you.}
<A>__{flash: rapidfire close ups. a jagged compound fracture, jutting, shelly's eye, blood red sclera, purpled and sunken. her scraped raw hand clawing at air. icebox lighting. a tight shot of her monitor going flatline: eeeeeeeeeeeeee... two shot resuming eric and top dollar. as top sags in eric's grasp, terror fixing his wide staring dead eyes. eric lets him drop like a laundry sack.}
<C>__{eric}
<D>__{i didn't think you could handle it either.}
<A>__{o.s. bang of impact, heavy against the steel door. eric turns. angle steel door as it is battered down by a squad of police using a power ram. all weapons snap up to bear on eric.}
<C>__{lead swat}
<D>__{that's all she wrote, bozo! you stand down now, and that's an order!}
<A>__{angle eric as he moves using his foot to shove the massive conference table at the incoming swats while launching himself into the air, flipping toward the window and arching through cleanly as the cops open fire on command. bullets tear the room to pieces.}
