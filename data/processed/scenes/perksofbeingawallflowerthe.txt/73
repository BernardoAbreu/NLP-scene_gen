<L>__{interior sam and patrick's house games room night}
<A>__{charlie carries sam on his shoulders past the christmas tree. sam wears a santa hat like a hot elf.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{no more applications! no more sat's! thank you, charlie!}
<A>__{they pass mary elizabeth as she opens her final present.}
<C>__{mary elizabeth}
<D>__{multiple pairs of blue jeans. wow. this is a really tough one, but i'm going to have to guess... alice.}
<A>__{alice smiles. bob nudges her. guilty as charged. mary elizabeth pulls one last item out of the gift bag.}
<C>__{mary elizabeth }
<D>__{wait, guys... a receipt! she actually paid!}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{impossible!}
<C>__{mary elizabeth}
<D>__{i'm so touched.}
<A>__{alice laughs. patrick pours everyone brandy. the kids look ridiculous, but they don't feel ridiculous.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{where's craig?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{he went home to connecticut. he'll be back for new year's eve.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i'm sorry we won't be seeing him tonight.}
<A>__{sam nods, then turns. charlie is delighted. no craig. the kids settle in the living room in front of the fire.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{alright, big brother by 3 weeks. who's your secret santa?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i will tell you, sam. this one's tough. i have received a harmonica, a magnetic poetry set, a book about harvey milk, and a mix with the song "asleep" on it... twice.}
<A>__{charlie starts snickering. he can't help himself.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{i mean, i have no idea. this collection of presents is so gay that i think i must have given them to myself. but despite that distinct possibility, i'm going to have to go with... drum roll... charlie.}
<A>__{charlie holds up his hands. yay! they all cheer.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{alright, charlie... it's your turn.}
<A>__{charlie and patrick switch places. charlie stands.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{okay. uh, i have received socks, pants, a shirt, and a belt. i was ordered to wear them all tonight. so, i'm guessing my secret santa is mary elizabeth.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{huh. now, why do you say that?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i don't know. she bosses people around sometimes.}
<A>__{the gang cracks up. mary elizabeth is pissed.}
<C>__{mary elizabeth}
<D>__{what the hell is wrong with you?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{well, you'll be surprised to know that your secret santa is actually... me.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you got me clothes? why?}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{because all the great writers used to wear great suits. your last present is on a towel rack in the bathroom. delve into our facilities. emerge a star.}
<A>__{charlie gives sam a sack of presents.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{can you hand these out while i'm gone?}
<C>__{mary elizabeth}
<D>__{wait a second. there's only secret santa presents. there are rules, charlie.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{mary elizabeth, why are you trying to eat christmas? hand them out, sam.}
<A>__{sam gives out the presents. the group rips them open. alice looks at a book about martin scorsese with the inscription...}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{"alice, i know you'll get into nyu."}
<A>__{alice turns to mary elizabeth who holds up a card with...}
<C>__{mary elizabeth}
<D>__{40 dollars.}
<P>__{(reads card)}
<D>__{"to print punk rocky in color next time."}
<A>__{bob blows soap bubbles into the air. stoned. mesmerized.}
<C>__{bob}
<D>__{he knows me. he really knows me.}
<A>__{sam looks at her present. an old 45 record of the beatles classic "something" with a card. she reads the card. holds it to her chest. very moved.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{come on out, charlie.}
<A>__{they all chime in. "let's go, young man!" "charlie! charlie!" charlie opens the door off camera, and we see his entrance play off their faces. the reverse angle reveals... charlie dressed in his suit. like the best of english mods in the 60's. for those of you who know the book, this is the cover. they all clap. it's magic.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{yeah! what a display of man i have ever seen!}
<A>__{sam and charlie look at each and smile.}
