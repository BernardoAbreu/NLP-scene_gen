<L>__{interior miss spink and forcible's other apartment same}
<A>__{she pushes past elegant velvet curtains to discover an enormous, darkened theater with dim rows of seats and a high wooden stage. a flashlight comes towards her, carried by a black scottie dog with button eyes. he looks up at her, sniffs, then leads her down the aisle past rows and rows of button eyed scotties, to a front seat by the other wybie. she squeezes his arm hello, he looks back warmly.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{hey, wybie.}
<A>__{light flash, the audience quiets, then the curtains open on a seaside setting with rotating waves. other miss spink rises up on stage left, in a mermaid suit, large wig, button eyes, and ukulele.}
<C>__{coraline }
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{she's practically naked!}
<A>__{and miss spink sings.}
<C>__{other miss spink}
<D>__{i'm known as the siren of all seven seas the breaker of hearts by the bay.}
<A>__{a flat cut out ship manned by cut out men rows in behind her.}
<C>__{other miss spink }
<D>__{so, if you go swimmin' with bow legged women, i might steal your weak heart away.}
<A>__{she bows her head and the audience of dogs thump their tails. spink is lowered through the stage floor, the scenery changes, and on the right, a huge scallop shell rises up with the other miss forcible, clad in the bare minimum her homage to botticelli's birth of venus. she's facing the wrong way.}
<C>__{coraline}
<P>__{(whisper, to wybie)}
<D>__{oh my god.}
<A>__{a dog howls, alerting the near blind lady, who turns to the audience and begins the next verse.}
<C>__{other miss forcible}
<D>__{a big bottomed sea witch may bob through the waves, and hope to lead sailors astray, but a true ocean goddess, must fill out her bodice,}
<P>__{(indicates her ample bosom)}
<D>__{to present an alluring display.}
<A>__{the dogs thump and woof, wybie and coraline clap. spink, furious at the greater reaction, gets back in the competition. rising up, she makes it clear just who she's dissing.}
<C>__{other miss spink}
<D>__{beware of old oysters, too large in the chest, let's banish them from the buffet.}
<A>__{but forcible is up to the challenge the scenery starts to change faster and faster as the ladies rise up and down, competing.}
<C>__{other miss spink }
<D>__{i'm far more nutritious}
<C>__{other miss forcible}
<D>__{you smell like the fishes}
<C>__{other miss spink}
<D>__{did i hear a banshee?}
<C>__{other miss forcible}
<D>__{you're sea green with envy}
<C>__{other miss spink}
<D>__{this mermaid enchantress,}
<C>__{other miss forcible}
<D>__{no, i "birth of venus!"}
<A>__{the set rigging can't take it anymore ropes snap, sandbags swing, scenery starts to fall.}
<C>__{other miss forcible}
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{will send sailors swooning oh !}
<C>__{other miss spink}
<D>__{will send sailors swooning oh !}
<A>__{with a crash, the old ladies tumble down in a pile. coraline winces. the audience howls with laughter as the curtains close on the disaster. drum roll. a scottie dog pushes a large bucket of water, labeled "pool", onto center stage. spotlights tilt up to the top of very tall diving platforms where the old ladies now stand. coraline can't stand it.}
<C>__{coraline}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{i can't look!}
<C>__{other miss spink}
<D>__{ready to break a leg, miriam?}
<C>__{other miss forcible}
<D>__{our lives for the theater, april!}
<A>__{they begin to bounce on the diving boards. as they bounce up, the two troupers unzip fat suit disguises from which emerge their younger beautiful selves which leap to catch matching trapeze bars that swing into place. coraline laughs with relief and amazement, other wybie pleased. dogs woof, music begins and the two beauties eyes bright buttons, sexy bathing suits striped pink and green swing out over the stage.}
<C>__{young forcible}
<D>__{what a piece of work is man! how noble in reason!}
<A>__{they fly past each other on their trapezes, double up, catch one another hand to ankle. we notice a large pearl ring on forcible's finger.}
<C>__{young spink}
<D>__{how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how express and admirable!}
<A>__{in a sudden change of direction, they swing out over the audience, trapeze bar lowering and pull coraline into the air! she hollers, terrified. they expertly toss her one to the other, flipping and spinning, as they continue their lines. her screams become cries of exhilaration.}
<C>__{young forcible}
<D>__{in action like an angel!}
<C>__{young spink}
<D>__{in apprehension how like a god!}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{ahhh!!!}
<C>__{young forcible}
<D>__{the beauty of the world!}
<C>__{young spink}
<D>__{the paragon of animals!}
<A>__{coraline swings face to face to the dogs in the royal box seats where one licks her.}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{yeah!!}
<A>__{the acrobats toss coraline up into the air and jack knife dive into the large bucket below. they rise up, unhurt, just in time to catch coraline. the three bow to thunderous thumping applause and, as the camera pulls back on the scene, other wybie throws her a rose!}
