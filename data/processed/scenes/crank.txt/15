<L>__{int chelios living room, continuous}
<A>__{... the living room, toward the telephone where he spots a plain black vhs tape propped up in front of a plasma screen tv with police ribbon wrapped around it, tied in a bow, like a present.}
<C>__{chelios}
<P>__{(barely comprehensible)}
<D>__{whathufuck?}
<A>__{he grabs the thing, fumbles to unwrap it, shoves it into the vcr and pushes play.}
<L>__{interior tv screen}
<A>__{it's ricky verona on the screen, a young, irritatingly slick eastern euro ... little to no accent fast talking, sarcastic, a complete dick ... we see him sitting on chev’s bed ... chev is visible in the frame, unconscious behind verona. pale nicotine sunlight filters in through the blinds. there are hoods loitering around the room. it was apparently shot only hours before. (the discernible sound of chev’s heartbeat will subliminally increase in speed and volume throughout verona's monologue the cell phone continues to ring, somewhere.)}
<C>__{verona}
<D>__{what's shaking, douchebag? thought i'd give you the heads up. you're dead.}
<A>__{on the tv verona points into the camera.}
<P>__{verona (cont’d)}
<D>__{yeah, that's right, you little bitch ... if you're watching this tape it means that i somehow resisted the urge to dismember you and shove the pieces down the garbage disposal ... opting instead to poison you in your sleep. yeah, you heard me...}
<A>__{we stay with chev’s pov as he flashes a frantic glance around the room. the lubdub of the heartbeat is much louder and faster now; we really begin to notice it.}
<P>__{verona (cont’d)}
<D>__{... i fucking poisoned you in your sleep. how sick is that?... for the satisfaction of watching you squirm out your last minutes knowing it was me that did it to you, and there's nothing you can do about it...}
<A>__{cut to high angle view from a hidden lipstick camera; chev is on his knees in front of the set, looking around ... we still don't see his face clearly.}
<P>__{verona (cont’d)}
<D>__{... that's right, you're on candid camera, try not to embarrass yourself...}
<A>__{cut back to chev’s pov. he holds his head down over the carpet and shoves a finger in his mouth, gagging.}
<P>__{verona (cont’d)}
<D>__{let me guess, you’re trying to puke the shit out, right? right? don’t bother...}
<C>__{verona}
<D>__{the shit i gave you is some fucking high tech sci fi chinese synthetic shit that even i don't know exactly what the fuck it is. all i know is once it binds with your blood cells, you're fucked, baby... and believe me, it's done binded. by now you'll be feeling your joints stiffen up... hard to breath...}
<A>__{chev puts his hand on the left side of his chest to feel his heart. the beats of the heart grow louder still, but the rhythm falters, begins to slow ...}
<D>__{verona (v.o.) (cont'd) ... your heartbeat is slowing down like there’s rust in your veins... you’re like the tin man in the wizard of freaking oz...}
<A>__{one of the thugs, alex, contributes from offscreen.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(amused by his own wit, singing)}
<D>__{“if he only had a brain.”}
<C>__{verona}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{scarecrow. whatever. you get the pointerior you’re fucked. you got maybe an hour, max, tough guy ... baby ... sexy ...}
<A>__{the thugs are into it; verona is rolling. one of them comes up beside the bed and plants a big kiss on chev’s unconscious head.}
<C>__{verona }
<D>__{hey, it's been real. probably should've thought twice before you whacked don kim. experiencing a little 20 20 hindsight? i thought so. have a nice death...}
<A>__{finally the camera reverses to reveal chev’s slack jawed face, staring at the tv. chev is in his late 20s, handsome in an offhanded way. all of the background noise the heartbeat, the cell phone cuts to dead silence... and through the silence, a single word:}
<P>__{verona (cont’d)}
<D>__{... asshole.}
<A>__{(a driving soundtrack kicks in. the opening titles play over the following:) finding a drunken man's strength, chev flips out. he rips the tv out of the stand, tearing the wires from the guts of the wall. he launches it straight into the floorboards with a bone breaking crush. he kicks over the rest of the entertainment system, jumps on it and heads out of the room. roller dolly follows him on a stumbling rampage through the apartment and down the hall. by the door, in an ashtray with his car keys, he finds it: his god damned cell phone. of course it stops ringing just as he picks it up. he pockets it, bangs open the front door and is out.}
