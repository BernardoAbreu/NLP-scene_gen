<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{playing with a jigsaw puzzle i talked to a lot of people who knew him.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{what do they say?}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{well it's become a very clear picture. he was the most honest man who ever lived, with a streak of crookedness a yard wide. he was a liberal and a reactionary; he was tolerant "live and let live" that was his motto. but he had no use for anybody who disagreed with him on any point, no matter how small it was. he was a loving husband and a good father and both his wives left him and his son got himself killed about as shabbily as you can do it. he had a gift for friendship such as few men have he broke his oldest friend's heart like you'd throw away a cigarette you were through with. outside of that }
<C>__{third newspaperman}
<D>__{okay, okay.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{what about rosebud? don't you think that explains anything?}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{no, i don't. not much anway. charles foster kane was a man who got everything he wanted, and then lost it. maybe rosebud was something he couldn't get or lost. no, i don't think it explains anything. i don't think any word explains a man's life. no i guess rosebud is just a piece in a jigsaw puzzle a missing piece.}
<A>__{he drops the jigsaw pieces back into the box, looking at his watch.}
<C>__{thompson}
<D>__{we'd better get along. we'll miss the train.}
<A>__{he picks up his overcoat it has been resting on a little sled the little sled young charles foster kane hit thatcher with at the opening of the picture. camera doesn't close in on this. it just registers the sled as the newspaper people, picking up their clothes and equipment, move out of the great hall.}
