<L>__{exterior annie and grace's cottage day}
<A>__{tom walks up some wooden steps to a door and knocks. he hears a tv on inside. and grace's voice:}
<C>__{grace }
<D>__{mom! the door!}
<A>__{he hears annie's muffled reply from o.s. he hears some banging as grace fumbles for her crutch and comes to the door. she opens it only so far as to reveal her upper body:}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{uh, i'm tom booker. your mother around?}
<A>__{grace hops to the side as tom walks by her, into the room. grace is closing the door as he turns to see, for the first time, that grace is one leg.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{she'll be right out. she's on the phone.}
<A>__{grace hops back to the bed in front of the tv. tom nods and puts his hat down noticing the prosthetic leaning against the window, near her bed. he hears annie on the phone and looks to the other room, the door ajar seeing only her legs, seated on the edge of her bed, as she talks. her foot taps impatiently.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{first time in montana?}
<A>__{grace, rudely nods, still looking at the tv. beat. tom doesn't like her manner, but can easily see through it. he sits.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{she gonna be long?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{probably. she's on the phone twenty three hours a day.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{what does she do?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{she's an editor.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{mmm. an editor.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{not like books or literature or anything. just a magazine... just in case she hasn't told you which i'm sure she hasn't i don't want to be a part of this, ok?}
<A>__{tom just sort of nods. a beat or two later, annie enters.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{sorry about that. hi. grace, this is mr. booker... have you looked at pilgrim?}
<A>__{tom sees grace turn away, just as annie enters. he takes a moment. he could say no right there, but something stops him.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{uh, no. i was gonna take a look now.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{you want us to come with you? i just have to run to the main house and give mr. peterson a check.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{doesn't matter.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{grace?... grace, you want to come with us, take a look at pilgrim?}
<A>__{grace keeps looking at the tv. no reply. tom is half way out the door when he says to annie making sure grace can hear }
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{probably best she stays behind, anyway.}
<A>__{he disappears. annie gives grace a final look and exits, closing the door. alone, grace flings her body across the bed, reaching for her prosthetic putting it on feverishly. she is completely intrigued by tom.}
