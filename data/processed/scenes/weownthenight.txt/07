<L>__{interior the front of the establishment lobby}
<A>__{a huge fight that's breaking out. violent. club patrons and security guys are in the melee. girls scream. rosario moves past all this, to the front door. louis falsetti, forty, backs off from the multiple struggles all around him. louis is wearing a jacket that says "security" on it. he is the jocular type, very overweight, redfaced. bobby arrives at the fight scene. with cheery braggadocio:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{what the fuck's goin' on in here?}
<A>__{bobby moves right in. grabs a struggling and drunk patron, puts him in a headlock. he gives the patron a shot to the temple, just to keep him docile. lou, bobby's best friend, watches the imbroglio with an amused and cowardly detachment, chortling with every punch and scream. he balances a drink in his hand with marvelous care, avoiding spillage. but the battle gets closer and closer. seeing his friend bobby, who's hardly got everything in control:}
<C>__{louis falsetti}
<D>__{okay, bobkes! looks like you got everything under control here so uh, so i'm gonna go outside, take my break!}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{yeah just keep that wide load of yours outta trouble, arright?}
<C>__{louis falsetti}
<D>__{yes, your fuckin' majesty!}
<A>__{the patron is acting up again, trying to free himself from bobby's grip. bobby looks down at him. with humor:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{what're you doing?!? you gotta behave yourself here!}
<A>__{gives the guy a shot in the head. meanwhile: louis saunters past the melee, jumping gracefully over a fallen drunk. he bows in triumph when others applaud his leap. everyone laughs as he goes out the door. bouncer freddie helps clean up the mess. a girl screams as a guy is flipped on his back by bouncers. a patron with blood on his face, acting like an eight year old, to bobby (who hurls his guy out of frame):}
<C>__{bloodied patron}
<D>__{c'mon, mr. green! i didn't do nothing!}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{well now you're gonna do nothing someplace else!}
<P>__{(louder, to all fighters; pointing:)}
<D>__{now listen one of these days i'm gonna run this whole block, and i see any you in here again any you i will bust your fuckin' hole!}
<P>__{(to freddie)}
<D>__{throw `em out on their ass. i gotta go upstairs, drop off my keys with the old man.}
