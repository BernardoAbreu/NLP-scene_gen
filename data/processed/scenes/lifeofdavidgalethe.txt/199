<A>__{the old woman moves down the stairs. dusty puts the aluminum suitcase on the doormat. from the duty free bag he takes out david's yale sweatshirt, lays it over the case. he rings the doorbell, turns and walks back down the hall. he stands at the top of the stairs, waiting for someone to answer before descending. sharon (older than we've seen her) opens the door, sees the case and sweatshirt. she looks around, but dusty is gone. she picks them up.}
