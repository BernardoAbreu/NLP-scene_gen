<L>__{interior main room, joey's ap't.}
<A>__{joey sits, drinking her coffee, as terri walks round the room with hers.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{this is great. and it's yours? you like own it?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{the bank owns it. but i'm working on it.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{jeez, i've never owned anything. i haven't even had a room of my own since i was fifteen years old.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{how have you ... ?}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{guys. sometimes friends. mostly guys.}
<A>__{terri walks past joey's tv set (sound down, cartoons playing).}
<B>__{angle on tv}
<A>__{the box is on top of the tv. in the warm light of morning it seems innocuous and harmless, like just another ornament.}
<B>__{different angle}
<A>__{ as terri walks on, pausing by the shelves of books.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{wow. lotta books. you read all these?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{no. i buy them to impress people. of course i've read them.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{cool. i read a book once. it was like all these people discovering who they used to be. you know, like reincarnation? it was really good. you ever read that?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{i don't think so. but it's a fascinating subject. did you ...}
<A>__{but terri has already moved on. she is by the big picture window. the drapes are now open.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{great view! great view! look at this!}
<A>__{joey stands and walks to join terri.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{actually, i'm pretty familiar with the view ...}
<A>__{girls' pov through window joey's apartment is on a high floor and her window overlooks many lower buildings, giving a view of the city beyond.}
<C>__{joey}
<P>__{(off)}
<D>__{... but it is good. you know, over to the left, you can ...}
<C>__{terri}
<P>__{(looking to right and pointing)}
<D>__{who's that?}
<A>__{on the flat roof of a nearby building, a retarded teenage boy sits motionless in an old rusty deck chair next to a small jerry built pigeon coop. its door is open and it is empty. the boy is some distance from the girls but his solitude, his stillness, and the empty coop beside him lend the scene an atmosphere of sadness and loss. as joey tells his story, we intercut : between the pov of the roof and the girls at the window.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{i don't know his name ... i saw the whole story. a wounded bird was on his roof. i could hear its cries from here. he went straight to it. i couldn't've. i'd be frozen between pity and fear. but he wasn't. its pain spoke directly to him. he picked it up. nursed it. fed it. and it got better. everyday he'd watch the pigeon. everyday the pigeon would watch him. i saw him learn. learn that there was one more thing he had to do to make the rescue complete. and one day, just as afternoon became evening, he leaned over, opened the cage, and walked away. didn't look back. but he heard the sound of its wings.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{and he still sits there?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{every day.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{maybe he thinks it'll come back.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{no. he knows it won't. it was his final act of love and part of him knows that and part of him doesn't yet.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{bullshit! he should've kept it. it'd live longer! it's dangerous out there! people get hurt!}
<B>__{angle on joey}
<A>__{ as she realizes she has a wounded pigeon of her own.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{what? i wasn't talking about ... i ... do you want to stay? you want to stay here for a while?}
<A>__{terri shrugs, gives a nervous smile. joey crosses to the tv, picks up the box and weighs it in her hand.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{ok. ok. it's a done deal. but look you have to help me. i've got to solve this thing. i've got to know what's going on.}
<A>__{terri follows across the room and sits on the sofa.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{but i don't know what's going on.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{maybe not. but you know more than i do. you know something about this box. something about a statue?}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{yeah. i found it. i knew held like it and i figured ...}
