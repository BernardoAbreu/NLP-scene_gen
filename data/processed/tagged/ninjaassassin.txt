<A>__{their answer is silence. hollywood sees his guns nearby. with a desperate scream, he throws the match in the air as he dives for his guns, grabbing one in each hand. there is a whistle of metal and suddenly his severed hands are tumbling gracefully through the air. the blade swings again, slicing through his body as if it were barely there, coming out the other side as hollywood's body erupts as it falls in two pieces, splattering the artist with blood. the match touches the floor and goes out. the tattoo master does not move, has not moved. frozen.}

<D>__{but you are real, aren't you?}
<A>__{there's the shing of a sword being unsheathed. the artist closes his eyes, anticipating death. silence. he waits for the death blow. it does not come. he finally forces himself to open his eyes. the ninja is gone, having departed as silently as he came, leaving death and blood in his wake.}

<A>__{she shifts nervously, no poker face. she turns and leads him into her home office. with the key from the tampax box she opens the drawer. maslow watches as she pulls out the contents of sabatin's box as well as the illegally requisitioned evidence.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{most of this is from sabatin. copies of what i think are the lost chapters of the rihle. i think it describes the original location of the ozunu clan but my 14th century arabic is a little rusty.}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{and this?}
<A>__{meaning the dvd.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{that's how it started. i made a mistake, mixed up the case code and they sent me that.}
<A>__{a moment later the dvd is playing, raizo and the other ninja dancing through the shadows.}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{...christ.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{yeah. i know. i don't understand why they're fighting though. it could be a clan war.}
<A>__{maslow starts to put it together.}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{so you requisitioned this by accident. you used my code which is why you didn't want to show me this. which is also why they're tearing apart my office right now.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{i'm sorry ryan. you have to know i didn't mean for you to get in trouble...}
<C>__{mika }
<D>__{i just thought if this was real, if these clans were killing people, you know, it was our job to try to stop them.}
<A>__{he eyes her.}
<C>__{mika }
<D>__{isn't that what your dad would do?}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{okay, that's low.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{look, i know i broke the rules. i will explain what i did and accept the consequences.}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{very noble of you but i've got the feeling this isn't a slap on the wrist kinda consequence. let me take this and try to make some sense of this shitstorm you started. in the meantime, you will not say anything to anybody. capiche?}

<C>__{zabranski}
<D>__{agent zabranski. internal affairs. need to ask you a couple of questions. you are mika coretti, yeah?}
<A>__{she nods, her gut clenching. he pulls out a small notebook.}

<D>__{forensic researcher. you work a lot with an agent...maslow. that right?}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{...a few cases.}
<C>__{zabranski}
<D>__{you have something of a social relationship.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{zabranski}
<D>__{you had lunch with him on the 13th and again on the 18th.}

<C>__{zabranski}
<D>__{is it not true?}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{i...i'm not sure. we do have lunch together sometimes, usually when we're working }
<C>__{zabranski}

<C>__{mika}
<D>__{no...not right now.}

<D>__{has agent maslow seemed different lately, in any way? has he done or said anything that struck you as unusual?}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{no why. has agent maslow done something?}
<A>__{he smiles in the way a piranha might smile if it could.}
<C>__{zabranski}
<D>__{just routine. the agency cares about its field operatives. we monitor for signs of stress, fatigue, mental exhaustion. agent maslow has a serious case load. that much work can wear on a man.}
<A>__{he leaves. she gets up and closes her door. she grabs her phone and calls maslow.}

<D>__{i showed jamison the materials.}

<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{i understand that sir but }
<C>__{jamison}
<D>__{let me be clear, agent maslow. in the eyes of the law these materials do not exist. if so, than there is no case and if there is no case there is no reason for this conversation to continue.}
<L>__{interior parking garage car night}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{he took the materials?}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{come on mika, how could he take something that didn't exist? he couldn't. which means that i couldn't copy it either, and if i couldn't copy it than i can't be violating international laws and agreements by still having it.}
<A>__{she likes this guy.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{what are we going to do?}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{your going to go home. pack your bags and go on holiday.}

<D>__{ryan, i can't let you lose your job because of me }
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{i'm not talking about my job, mika.}

<C>__{maslow }

<C>__{mika}
<D>__{i've never even fired one of these.}
<C>__{maslow}
<P>__{(pointing) this is the bad end.}
<D>__{this is the end you hold. point, shoot, run like hell.}
<A>__{he also gives her a phone.}
<C>__{maslow }
<D>__{i'm going to try to find some help. until then, i need you gone. don't tell anyone where you're going, just go. use this phone to text me when you get there, or if you have any problems.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{ryan...}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{i know. it's unbelievable. i've investigated, world bank officials, drug cartels, arms dealers, and i've never faced this kind of heat. for ninjas. fucking unbelievable!}

<L>__{exterior mika's apartment building night}
<A>__{mika parks her car around the corner from the apartment building, gets out and starts down the street when she sees the apartment building and the one next door are dark. candles and flashlights are visible in some of the apartment windows, a scattering of neighbors congregating outside. mika approaches a neighbor.}

<D>__{hey....}
<C>__{neighbor}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{neighbor}
<D>__{power's out. us, the building behind us, that one across the street. seems like every few months, boom, the lights out. i call, i complain, they listen...nothing gets done. so i sit out here, at least it's cool.}
<A>__{mika looks up at the building, scared but not ready to believe that ninjas are responsible for everything. she pulls a tiny led flashlight out of her bag and starts into the building.}
<C>__{neighbor }
<D>__{watch your step.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{you're not the first person to give me that advice today....}
<A>__{and she continues into }
<L>__{interior mika's apartment building stairwell night}
<A>__{ where she climbs the steps, each creak adding to the possibility of attracting trouble. on the passing floors, we hear doors being opened and shut, footsteps, the distant murmur of voices. could be nothing. could be everything. she presses on.}
<L>__{interior mika's apartment moments later}
<A>__{she opens the door to her apartment, shining the tiny light ahead of her. shadows chase each other across the room as she swings the light one way, then another. there seems to be no one else in the place. but as she hurries into her home office, we see a shadow move behind her. as she packs she begins to hear something, a tapping. the same sound she heard before. she pulls the gun from her purse. with the flashlight spearing the darkness, she goes to her office. again the window is open, the blinds gently blowing against the sash. she is certain the window had been locked. now every shadow is alive. she rushes back to her bedroom aiming in every direction. her flashlight finds her suitcase. on the top of her clothes she sees it: an envelope. perfectly centered. setting the gun down, she picks up the oragami folded envelope. opens it with a shaking finger. black sand spills out. terror steals her breath. behind her, a shadow tilts and reveals the eyes of a ninja. before she can even move, a blade flashes from the darkness, heading for her neck another shadow blocks the blade, knocking mika over the bed. the sounds of a fight erupt all around her but the combatants are almost invisible in the surrounding darkness. her flashlight catches glimpses. impossibly fast, lethal predators trying to kill each other. she crawls towards the spilled contents of her suitcase, towards the gun. another blow arcs for her and is again blocked. her hand finds the handle of the gun. she points into the dark, fires. the gun flash strobes the room, freezing the two ninjas in the blink of a flashbulb. they move towards her until a kick sends her gun flying. she can feel them fighting very close to her and when she finds them with her flashlight, a blade is struck deep blood erupts. one shadow falls to the ground. the other turns towards her. her flashlight shakes as the ninja reaches up and removes his mask. it is raizo. he sees in her eyes that she knows him.}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{you know me?}
<A>__{she nods.}
<C>__{raizo }
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{...security camera in new york. recorded you fighting...one of them.}
<A>__{she glances at the dead ninja.}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{you know about them?}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{a little.}
<A>__{he waits.}
<C>__{mika }
<D>__{uhh well, there are these clans...we're not sure how many.}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{nine.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{okay. nine. nine clans. and they apparently have been supplying assassins to governments or anyone who happens to have one hundred pounds of gold lying around for the last thousand years. give or take.}
<A>__{he nods faintly. then turns to his dead "brother".}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{his name was jin.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{you knew him?}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{he was not born an "assassin".}
<A>__{she looks at the dead body.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{...you're from his clan ?}
<A>__{his nod is almost imperceptible.}
<C>__{mika }
<D>__{then...why did you stop him?}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{the clans have three kinds of people! people with power. people with money. or people hunting them.}
<A>__{he hears something she can't. she starts to speak, and he stops her with a gesture.}
<C>__{raizo }
<D>__{they're coming.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{who?}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{the hanta kirra.}

<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{they won't stop until you are dead.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{oh god.}
<A>__{she looks for her gun.}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{the gun won't help you.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{i don't have a lot of options okay. i once took a tae bo class, but that's the extent of my kung fu abilities.}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{i can help but you must tell me something first.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{you saw ms. sabatin.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{how did you know that?}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{i've been watching you, waiting for them.}
<A>__{she tries to compute the idea that he's been following her.}
<C>__{raizo }
<D>__{did she give you something?}
<A>__{she nods, raizo's eyes lite up.}
<C>__{raizo }
<D>__{you have them?}
<A>__{shakes her head "no."}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{but i can get them.}
<A>__{he hears something else.}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{we need something black. hurry!}
<A>__{she runs with the flashlight to a bureau. inside is a black tablecloth. he pulls her shoes off.}
<C>__{raizo }
<D>__{follow me. step where i step.}
<L>__{interior mika's apartment building stairwell night}
<A>__{he leads her down through the stairwell of the large walk up. she follows him step by step. suddenly he pulls her into the corner of a doorway. wrapping the tablecloth around them, they melt into darkness. beneath the wrap, he puts his hand over her mouth and nose stopping her breath. outside after a long beat a ninja's foot silently glides past, climbing the stairs. inside he releases her nose. before she can finish taking a breath he yanks her up and they quickly descend the remaining stairs.}
<L>__{interior mika's apartment night}
<A>__{the dead ninja lies in a pool of blood. the shadows come alive and four dark figures emerge, born from the black the hanta kirra. their leader drifts forward surveying the apartment, his dark eyes flashing that we recognize. like snap focus flashes taking in the myriad signs of the fight: the bullets in the wall, footprints, and shattered lights. one of the killers uses his sword to trace the line of a slashing cut in wall. braille from the blow that raizo used to cut the ninja. he removes his mask and we see it's takeshi.}
<C>__{takeshi}
<D>__{raizo.}
<A>__{another ninja leans forward and tastes the air with his nose. eyes closed. like a dog getting the scent, his inhalation a long, low whisper in the silent room.}

<C>__{kingpin}
<D>__{the fuck ?}

<A>__{raizo attacks and it is immediately apparent that this is not going to be easy. several ferocious blows that would have broken the neck of a smaller man, only seem to make the kingpin madder. soon both are covered in blood, and gore. but it is not until raizo slams the man's head against the lip of the urinal the first time a font blood splashing up the second time the porcelain shatters as the kingpin's head opens, spilling black blood across the floor.}

<A>__{raizo looks at the girl, her tears lost in the rain. we cannot tell if raizo is crying as he takes the blade he cries out, the light of madness in his eyes. he strikes, lashing out with the fury of a wild animal, at ozunu who bends back with impossible grace. but not far enough. the point of raizo's sword slashes across his face, opening an ugly wound that spills blood over his eye and mouth... he hasn't tasted his own blood in years, and the anger boils up in his eyes.}
<C>__{ozunu }
<D>__{kill him!}
<A>__{raizo meets their attack. throwing himself into the fray as only a man who is no longer interested in living can. but the ninjas are everywhere. they hurl shuriken at him by the handful, a storm of jagged steel racing for raizo's flesh. raizo blocks some of the shuriken, misses many more. the shuriken strike muscles, tendons, flesh. he swings around, still trying to attack, there are too many of them. he stumbles back towards the edge of the roof as takeshi swings what he believes will be the death blow as raizo half falls, half leaps backward, falling from the rooftop, tumbling through space, until he splashes into the canal below bubbles dancing between the ribbons of blood.}

<D>__{interesting nature verses nurture case study i imagine.}
<A>__{he cocks an eyebrow.}
<C>__{mika }
<D>__{if it's okay with you, i will try to fill in some of the blanks. you must have been taken by the ozunu clan, trained to be an assassin, but something happened and you decided to opt out of the program. i don't imagine this went over so well and since they're after me for just peeking through the keyhole, they must be after you in a major way. but you are also after them or you wouldn't have bothered going to sabatin. which i figure means you're searching for the location of the orphanage because that's obviously the only information battatu's book would have that you wouldn't already know.}

<D>__{yeah, i got some moves too. i'm pretty lethal with the research thing.}
