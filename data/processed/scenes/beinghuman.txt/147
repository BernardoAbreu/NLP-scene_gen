<L>__{interior building day}
<A>__{hector retreats into the hallway. takes out his mobile phone and dials, while watching the ominous mr. santiago making copius notes in his book. hector gets connected.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{boris... why did you do this to me? get down here now... they want all kinds of certificates... they won't let me leave the building... i have my kids tonight, i haven't seen them in four years... i did tell you, i've been talking about it all week... how come they phoned me, this isn't my building? what? don't tell me anymore... i want you here, now... and on your knee... i will phone the lawyer... but you move. my weekend's ruined before it's started.}
<A>__{hector quickly dials another number.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{anna... thank god... you have to help me... i'm still in queens... i've got cops here and everything ... i need your car... i don't have time to pick up the rental now... they won't let me leave the building... you come down here... and put my bag in the car... no.. i have to pick the kids up by six, otherwise i fuck up her weekend too... she'll kill me... this is an emergency... what can i say? please... right... okay...}
<A>__{he finishes the call just as santiago approaches, waving his notebook now full of incriminating notes.}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{it looks like water rotted the floor... you have any plumbing maintenance records?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{at the office... i might have some bills... it's not my building.}
<A>__{santiago is talking almost to himself now, absorbed in the mundane mechanics of hector's building.}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{it's a weird one... i don't know how water could sit in there for so long without somebody noticing ... you didn't use water resistent paint on the ceilings did you?}
<A>__{hector shakes his head wearily.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i don't really know...}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{you're going to have to check out the whole building... you know that, don't you?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{can i do it monday?}
<C>__{santiago}
<D>__{good joke... it'll take you a month.}
<A>__{hector is already dialing another number as santiago wanders off in search of further fascinating discoveries.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{can i speak with leonard, please... mr. deutsch? my name is hector troup, borlonski and troup, real estate...}
<A>__{there is a moment's pause.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{leonard... it's hector... borlonski and troup... yes... listen, we've had a domestic accident at our eighth street building... a floor ... and an old lady... she did mention the word sue, but it might have been hysterics... what i need to know is what certificates you have on file for the building... i know it's friday... just do one thing... let me know if the insurance is current... i need to know that... i'm on my mobile... anything you have... before five ... thank you...}
<A>__{during the call hector has walked down the hall and back to the hole in the floor. he sees mrs. philippopolis, now strapped in a stretcher, being carried out of the room below. at the sight of him, she tries to sit up, straining on her straps.}
<C>__{mrs. philippopolis}
<D>__{my son's downstairs... when he sees me like this he'll kill you... go on... jump through the hole... see what it feels like! break both legs!}
<A>__{hector is almost tempted to do what she says.}
