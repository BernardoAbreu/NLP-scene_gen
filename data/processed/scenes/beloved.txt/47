<L>__{interior kitchen day.}
<A>__{paul is singing as he fixes the table he broke while driving the baby ghost away. denver is sweeping the floor irritated by paul's presence and voice. they both hear the front door open as sethe arrives home from work. they look to each other to see which one will make a move for sethe first. paul knows enough to bide his time with denver. he watches as she places the broom down and exits the kitchen.}
