<L>__{ext day: baronial village}
<A>__{the little village built attendant to the baronial estate, is decked with the flowers the girls had been picking. michael, followed by the bodyguards, moves into the central square, and onto the balcony of a little cafe. the proprietor of the cafe, vitelli, is a short burly man; he greets them cheerfully, and sets a dish of chickpeas at their table.}
<C>__{fabrizzio}
<D>__{you know all the girls in this town, eh? we saw some beauties coming down the road. one in particular got our friend hit with the thunderbolt...}
<P>__{(he indicates michael)}
<A>__{vitelli gives a big knowing laugh, and looks at michael with new interest.}
<C>__{vitelli}
<D>__{you had better bring a few bottles home with you, my friend; you'll need help sleeping tonight.}
<P>__{(he laughs)}
<C>__{fabrizzio}
<D>__{this one could seduce the devil. a body! and eyes as big and black as olives.}
<C>__{vitelli}
<P>__{(laughing with them...pouring more wine)}
<D>__{i know about what you mean!}
<C>__{fabrizzio}
<D>__{this was a beauty. right, calo?}
<C>__{vitelli}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{beautiful all over, eh?}
<C>__{fabrizzio}
<D>__{and hair. black and curly, like a doll. and such a mouth.}
<A>__{vitelli does not laugh quite so much.}
<C>__{vitelli}
<D>__{yes, we have beautiful girls here... but virtuous.}
<A>__{vitelli is no longer drinking with them.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{she wore a red dress, and a red ribbon in her hair. she looks more greek than italian. do you know a beauty like that?}
<A>__{as michael describes her, vitelli laughed less and less, until he wears a scowl.}
<C>__{vitelli}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{then he curtly leaves him, and walks into the back room.}
<C>__{fabrizzio}
<D>__{god in heaven, i think i understand...}
<A>__{he goes into the back room after the innkeeper. then he returns.}
<C>__{fabrizzio}
<D>__{let's get out of here; he's boiling up his blood to do us mischief. it's his daughter.}
<A>__{they start to leave; but michael doesn't move.}
<C>__{calo}
<D>__{come quickly.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{innkeeper. more wine!}
<C>__{fabrizzio}
<P>__{(whispered)}
<D>__{the old bastard mentioned two sons he only has to whistle up.}
<A>__{michael turns to fabrizzio with his cold authority.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{tell him to come to me.}
<A>__{the two bodyguards shoulder their luparas, and disappear in a moment they return with the red faced angry vitelli between them.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{i understand i've offended you by talking about your daughter. i offer you my apologies, i'm a stranger in this country, i don't know the customs very well. let me say this, i meant no disrespect to you or her...}
<A>__{calo and fabrizzio are impressed.}
<C>__{vitelli}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{who are you and what do you want from my daughter?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i am an american hiding in sicily from the police of my country. my name is michael. you can inform the police and make your fortune but then your daughter would lose a father rather than gain a husband. in any case, i want to meet your daughter. with your permission and under the supervision of your family. with all decorum. with all respect. i am an honorable man.}
<A>__{calo and fabrizzio are stupefied; vitelli pauses, and then asks:}
<C>__{vitelli}
<D>__{are you a friend of the friends?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{when the proper time comes, i will tell you everything that a wife's father should know.}
<C>__{fabrizzio}
<D>__{it's the real thunderbolt, then.}
<C>__{vitelli}
<P>__{(formally)}
<D>__{come sunday morning: my name is vitelli and my house is up there on the hill, above the village.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{your daughter's name?}
<C>__{vitelli}
<D>__{appolonia.}
<A>__{ fade out: }
