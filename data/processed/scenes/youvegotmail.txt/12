<A>__{as kathleen comes around the corner onto 73rd and stops in front of her store, a children's bookstore called "the shop around the corner." it is an irresistibly inviting store. there are twinkle lights in the windows, framing large stuffed animals reading children's books: madeleine, good night moon, where the wild things are. a teddy bear in a pinafore is reading the stupids step out. waiting for kathleen in front is one of her employees, christina.}
