<D>__{you must be very pleased!}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{what man would not be pleased to be dancing with a beautiful woman like you?}
<C>__{trophy wife}
<D>__{oh, mr. president, you're exaggerating.}
<C>__{mandela}
<D>__{indeed not. my father was a xhosa chief, and therefore a polygamist. as you know, i am not.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but when i look at you ... i envy my father.}
<A>__{the man is a major flirt, and really enjoying himself. but, once again, he is dancing with a stranger and, when we get close to his eyes, we realize that mandela is pushing himself way past empty.}
