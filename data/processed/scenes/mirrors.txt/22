<A>__{ben continues his rounds. we follow his path through reflections in the mirrors }
<B>__{as if he was being watched...}
<A>__{then for the first time, we discover another perspective, another pov from within the mirrors. it feels ominous, slightly detached. the sound is muted. ben crosses back the third floor the second floor...}
<A>__{ entrance hall ground floor in the reflection of one of the grand mirrors in the entrance hall, we see ben come down the stairs. he stops for a moment, facing his reflection in the mirror. he fixes his collar and looks at himself in his new clothes not quite an nypd uniform... suddenly, his eyes freeze. intrigued, he comes closer to the mirror and leans forward a handprint, barely visible, on the ice cold surface. he touches it with the tip of his fingers and tries to rub it off, unsuccessfully. he picks up a rag from the ground, spits on the mirror, and rubs the mark fervently. the print remains. this confirms his hunch }
<B>__{the handprint is inside the mirror...}
<A>__{by angling the flashlight, another handprint is revealed. another. and yet another the entire mirror is covered with handprints, just as if a crowd}

<A>__{in the mirror has been restored. ben tries to reenact the phenomenon. he opens and closes the door over and over, while observing his reflection, but the mirror is no longer deceitful. the staircase leading to the basement vanishes into the dark. ben hesitates.}
