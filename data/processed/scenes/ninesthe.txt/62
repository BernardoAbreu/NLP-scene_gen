<L>__{exterior wilshire blvd. night}
<A>__{headlights flare as cars travel down miracle mile, bringing us to a metro bus stop a semi enclosed bench with backlit signage. the far side of the shelter has a one sheet for crime lab. ("this fall, mondays are murder.") the bench side is a promo poster for a show called knowing. ("some fates are chosen for you.") it's here we find gary taking a seat, gingerly checking his toes where the rat trap snapped. he's hobbled his way here from the house, which is probably a block away. there's only a little blood, but his toes really hurt. over gary's shoulder, we see a blonde 8 year old girl (noelle) watching him with concern. she bangs on the shelter to get his attention. gary nearly jumps out of his skin.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{jesus! you scared the shit out of...}
<A>__{she signs "what's wrong?"}

<C>__{gary}
<D>__{i don't speak that. sorry. i don't...}
<A>__{she points to his toes. getting what she must mean...}
<C>__{gary }
<D>__{i'm fine. i will be fine.}
<A>__{looking around, he realizes that the little girl is out here by herself.}
<C>__{gary }
<D>__{where are your parents?}
<A>__{she looks at him oddly, not really getting the question.}
<C>__{gary }
<D>__{your mom, your dad. where are they?}
<C>__{noelle}
<P>__{(signed, subtitled)}
<D>__{mom is at the car. where you left her.}
<A>__{again, gary has no idea what she's saying.}
<C>__{noelle }
<P>__{(signed, subtitled)}
<D>__{you're lost.}
<C>__{gary}
<D>__{look, you need to go back, okay? you shouldn't be out here. it's not safe.}
<A>__{noelle glances to her left. we hear bwoop bwoop as a police cruiser pulls over to the curb.}
<C>__{gary }
<D>__{shit.}
<A>__{we go to a wider angle as two officers get out of the car. gary looks back. noelle is gone, though there's really nowhere she could have disappeared. putting on his best face for the police...}
<C>__{gary }
<D>__{evening, officers.}
