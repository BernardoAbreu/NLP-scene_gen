<L>__{interior amadeus day}
<A>__{domino is washing a glass. she the then remembers she has the gun in her waist belt, so she removes it and sticks it back under the counter. wounded mean dude #5 comes in limping. she takes out a towel and drops it on the counter.}
<D>__{mean dude #5 good morning, domino.}
<C>__{domino}
<D>__{what happened? mean dude #5 give me the phone. i have to call moco.}
<A>__{she brings up the phone and sets it down where the cloth was. he picks up the cloth and wraps his arm with it.}
<P>__{mean dude #5 (cont'd)}
<D>__{it's not as bad as it looks. domino, has anyone come through here? a stranger, maybe?}
<C>__{domino}
<D>__{this is a border town. i get strangers all the time. mean dude #5 dressed all in black, carrying a guitar case?}
<C>__{domino}
<D>__{no. mean dude #5 well, he shot me... and has killed ten of moco's men... all in one day.}
<A>__{domino looks a little upset. she slides the phone towards him a bit.}
<C>__{domino}
<D>__{aren't you gonna call your boss? mean dude #5}
<P>__{(nodding)}
<D>__{i have to tell moco that he got away again... so, you better give me a drink first.}
<A>__{domino smiles and pours him half a beer mug with tequila. he laughs and drinks. as he's dialing, the camera is on domino as she cleans up a few things, every once in a while glancing upstairs.}
<P>__{mean dude #5 (cont'd) (into phone)}
<D>__{moco, he got away. shot me in the arm. killed la palma. pepino, sunday. this guy is one slick maricon. yeah. also, i didn't get a look at him. so, unless he's still carrying that guitar around and hasn't changed clothes, i won't even spot him, and i don't think he'll be that obvious...}
<C>__{moco }
<D>__{don't worry. if there's one thing i know, it's that he'll always wear black and he'll always carry that guitar with him. it's his signature. besides, that's not a guitar he's carrying. it's a guitar case full of weapons. find him.}
<A>__{mean dude hangs up and puts his head in his hands.}
<C>__{domino}
<D>__{que paso}
<A>__{?}
<D>__{mean dude #5 i screwed up. the guy left his guitar case in the hotel room. we chased him out, but he came back for the case.}
<C>__{domino}
<D>__{maybe he loves his guitar. it's probably an antique. mean dude #5 it wasn't a guitar. it was a guitar case full of weapons that he uses on his victims. adios, i'm gonna take a nap. and thanks for the drink.}
<A>__{mean dude #5 stumbles as he tries to stand.}
<P>__{mean dude #5 (cont'd)}
<D>__{if you see this guy, call us.}
<A>__{he is about to walk off with the bloody towel and he turns back pointing at it. she waves her hand at him, as if granting him permission to take it. she cleans his glass, and when he is gone she slams the glass down and runs for the stairs. a few seconds later she comes back into the bar, grabs the gun from under the counter and calls her assistant to watch the bar. he sees the gun and wonders what she's up to. she storms upstairs.}
