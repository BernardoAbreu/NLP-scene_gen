<L>__{interior hotel suite night}
<A>__{the same speech continues, largely ignored by congressman raymond prentiss shaw. still intense and moody, the new raymond shaw's suit is expensive and crisp, his hair perfect. he's playing solitaire. and winning.}
<C>__{raymond}
<P>__{(murmurs)}
<D>__{... i am not a professional politician. i am not a professional politician ...}
<C>__{jordan }
<D>__{ because once we start overturning our constitutional protections, our enemies have won.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{... i am ... a professional politician. not.}
<A>__{knocking on his door it opens, and secret service agent evan anderson removes his key while sen. eleanor shaw, pretty and ageless, sweeps in closing the door on her aide (gillespie) }
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{raymond? darling, what were you going to do, make me stand out there like room service?}
<A>__{ soft curves conceal razor claws and titanium backbone she kisses her son on the lips, straightens his collar, his tie, lets her hands smooth his shirt to his chest for a little too long, and never stops talking:}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{i asked downstairs and miss freeman, your 'wrangler' helpful ms. freeman said you were up here practicing your speech. honestly, i don't understand why you insist upon isolating yourself, people adore you, raymond, they crave your company and yet here you are, holed up, as if you were some kind of emotionally challenged individual like your father instead of raymond prentiss shaw, a handsome, intelligent, people loving war hero with a great deal to offer to his party and his country.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{no what? baby, i haven't even asked you a question. your hair is too flat. and that tie. the tie is wrong.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{no to the question you're going to ask. no to all the questions you pretend to want to ask }
<C>__{ellie}
<P>__{(the tie)}
<D>__{something a little less busy.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{ and no you may not engage in your usual back door political thuggery to shovel me onto the presidential ticket.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{oh. you're not interested? i thought you were. did i miss my cue?}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{of course i'm interested i wouldn't be here if i wasn't but not if it means attacking the reputation of a statesman like thomas jordan, which i'm sure was your plan. let democracy run its course, mother. let the people decide.}
<A>__{now ellie stares at him, mouth agape.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{what.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{i'm sorry, for a second there i thought it was your father speaking that dreaded shaw blood rising and the stink of defeat made me nauseous.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{mother }
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{and excuse me, when have i ever attacked the honorable mr. jordan, despite the shameful way his daughter misled you that summer at the shore.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{mother, you chased her away }
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{if that's how you want to remember it.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{ you ruined everything.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{honey, you're oversimplifying things somewhat but, yes, okay i promise, promise i will stay out of it. you have my word.}
<A>__{raymond stares at her.}
<C>__{ellie}
<D>__{after all, you're young and you have plenty of party conventions ahead of you in which to discover, as your father did, that democracy is an elusive and imperfect science, and the meek do not happily inherit the earth, but simply get eaten by the alpha dogs, chewed up, digested and deposited on the carefully mown parkways of american politics.}
<A>__{raymond rolls his eyes. she ruffles his hair again, heads into the bedroom.}
<C>__{ellie }
<D>__{one day, you will, i'm sure, tearfully memorialize me in your acceptance speech. don't you have a different tie in here? your grandfather always let me pick his ties.}
<A>__{raymond smooths his hair back down.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{i'm wearing the one i have on.}
<A>__{no response. close convention podium night (televised video) raymond is speaking. his tie is different. so is he: now he exudes a telegenic warmth and vivacity, his manner confident, easy, open.}
<C>__{raymond}
<D>__{i've always said i am not a professional politician, although i hold, and have been held well, hugged in elected office }
<P>__{(a winning smile:)}
<D>__{ you all know my mother, senator eleanor prentiss shaw ...}
<A>__{a chorus of cheers, and appreciative laughter he's won them over already }
