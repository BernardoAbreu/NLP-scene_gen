<C>__{monica}
<D>__{roy! the psycho thing is !}
<A>__{but strong hands suddenly grab her. it's casanova. back to furious continuous as high above he hears monica scream. back to the balcony continuous casanova, hand held tightly across monica's mouth, shouts down tauntingly to furious.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{thanks, roy! she's just my type. you can have her back... when i'm done!}
<A>__{back t0 furious continuous as he hears casanova's evil laugh and monica's scream. he is desperate to find a way up, but the wall is completely sheer. he feels helpless frantic, near tears... flash to the terrified little boy trapped in the back of his p8arents' car, crying, pounding on the windows... and then... mr. furious' hands clench into fists his hair stands up and his face turns into a mask of primordial rage. his button has finally been pressed. be's mad! he reaches up as high as he can... close on his hand as his fingers literally dig into the concrete of the wall... and he pulls himself up. back at the top 0f the tower continuous casanova throws monica onto the bed, puts his hands on her throat and strangles her as she thrashes helplessly against his immense strength. back to furious fifty feet up and climbing. he pulls himself up, one hand, then another, digging in his fingernails, catchng his toes on whatever tiny cracks he can find... as the others gaze up at him.}

<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{i can do it.}
<A>__{he takes a deep breath, closes his eyes, and concentrates... on furious as the fingers of one hand lose their grip and a toehold gives way... for a desperate moment, furious is dangling off the wall by the tips of the fingers of one hand. only his incredible rage keeps his fingertips taut. suddenly, there is a flash of silver, and a large cake fork embeds in the concrete not far from his head. furious grabs hold of it, and throws a grateful look down to the raja... who salaams up at him... as invisible boy, eyes closed in concentration, walks very slowly, hands at his sides, in an almost egyptian pose... toward the eye... which stares down mercilessly, waiting for its next victim... we notice that invisible boy has become... just slightly transparent. at the top of the tower continuous on casanova a look of pleasure on his face as he strangles monica. her resistance fades. her hands fall away. she is pale, beautiful, almost gone, a picture of exquisite death.}

<D>__{pootchkie, you're over reacting. this is our night. it's what we've lied for... cheated for... murdered for. she's just a plaything, a trifle... you're the only woman who's ever meant anything to me. i adore you. i worship you. i want to make you my bride.}
<A>__{she succumbs to his charms, and he gently takes the pistol out of her hand.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{there's just one thing...}
