<A>__{closer shot of marty marching along 176th street. he quickly reaches the grand concourse. here he pauses a moment, a little at a loss for what direction to take then remembers he needs the uptown bus. he moves across the wide street to get to the other side of the boulevard. again, he seems to lose track of which direction is homeward. he walks uptown a ways with a strange jerky stride, pausing every once in a while to see whether there's a bus coming. suddenly marty breaks into a dog trot, then drops back into the stiff stride as he approaches...}
<B>__{the intersection of the grand concourse.}
<A>__{the corner near the bus stop is deserted. marty stops, leans against the pole of the bus stop sign. abruptly, he turns and walks uptown a little further. series of intercuts: marty strides, walks, stops short, goes to the curb desultorily, a few paces into the street, moves back. the traffic moves by him. he stands in the wide street, then with a gesture of magnificent expansiveness, he raises his arm and calls out.}
