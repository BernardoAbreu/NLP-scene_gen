<L>__{interior planet factory night}
<A>__{the space is millions of miles across. floating in it are half finished planets, construction gantries around them.}
<C>__{slartibartfast }
<D>__{welcome to our factory floor.}
<A>__{on arthur who is positively blown away.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior temple of deep thought continuous}
<A>__{ford, zaphod and trillian enter the dimly lit temple. they hear a faint, tinny sound. they follow it.}
<B>__{further down the corridor...}
<A>__{the sound gets louder. tinny music. and laughter... flickering light illuminates the end of the corridor.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{this is it!}
<A>__{he quickens his pace. trillian and ford follow. they round the corner to find... deep thought sitting there majestically. the tinny music emanates from somewhere near him. zaphod takes another step in and now sees the source of the tinny music. deep thought is watching tv. a violent, stupid cartoon.}
<C>__{zaphod }
<D>__{deep thought...!}
<C>__{deep thought}
<D>__{shhh. this is a good bit.}
<A>__{the cartoon continues. zaphod enters, removes his thinking cap and reverently approaches. he kneels...}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{oh great deep thought...we have traveled long...and far. have you calculated... the ultimate question? of life, the universe and everything?}
<C>__{deep thought}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{zaphqd}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{deep thought}
<D>__{i've been watching tv.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{oh...}
<A>__{zaphod holds a smile but his world is slowly crumbling.}
<C>__{deep thought}
<D>__{i designed another computer to perform that great task.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{oh, right...i forgot.}
<P>__{(looking around)}
<D>__{is it here?}
<C>__{deep thought}
<D>__{not here. another world.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{it's on another world?}
<C>__{deep thought}
<D>__{it is another world. or was.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{where?}
<C>__{deep thought}
<D>__{ask your companion.}
<A>__{zaphod turns to ford. ford looks confused.}
<C>__{deep thought }
<D>__{not him.}
<A>__{zaphod looks to trillian. she looks equally confused. zaphod puts the thinking cap back on. strains hard.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{0kay you're sure you don't have the question? or a way to you, you know access it or something. i think i've done like a lot to get here...}
<C>__{deep thought}
<D>__{shhhhhh...}
<A>__{zaphod looks up. deep thought is shushing him?}
<C>__{deep thought }
<D>__{the show's back on.}
<A>__{a robotic arm reaches out and turns up the volume. zaphod stands, turns to ford and trillian, smiles that smile but it's starting to look a bit crazed.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{great. this is just great. let's go find something else for my entire life to be about.}
<A>__{he starts to march off. ford grabs his arm.}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{zaphod. the gun? the one humma sent us for? we have to get it. you gave the guy your head.}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{i know. why did i do that?}
<A>__{he pulls his thinking cap down all the way over his eyes. ford rolls his eyes, turns...}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{um...deep thought? we we're told you have a g...}
<A>__{before he finishes the sentence, a panel in the wall slides open revealing a large, scary looking gun. a robotic arm pushes it forward. ford goes over, takes it, carries it like it's nitroglycerin to zaphod who's already walking away,}
<B>__{corridor leading away from deep thought}
<A>__{ford hands zaphod the gun.}
<C>__{ford }
<D>__{here. take it. i don't do guns.}
<A>__{zaphod takes it with a smile...}
<C>__{zaphod}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{...and instantly points it at his head. ford lunges for it. there's a struggle. ford's trying to get zaphod's finger off the trigger when click! the trigger is pulled. ford winces. but apparently, nothing has happened.}
<C>__{zaphod }
<D>__{great! this is a bust, too!}
<C>__{ford}
<D>__{hey, man, you must be really frustrated. to go through all you did only to come here and get no answer, which means no fame and money, and you deserve that, man. because you're great you're just really, really great.}
<A>__{zaphod isn't sure what just happened. but he smiles anyway. trillian, however, is onto something.}
<C>__{trillian}
<D>__{give me that thing.}
