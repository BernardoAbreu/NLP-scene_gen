<B>__{angle on rear of store}
<A>__{joey and terri approach an old shelf unit along the rear wall. a shaft of sunlight throws a square of light on the wooden floor a few yards in front of the shelves. joey takes up a big bulging manilla folder from the shelves and begins to look through it.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{terri, check out the other folder.}
<A>__{terri, still holding her purse and the box, looks around for somewhere to put them. all the shelves are full. she lays them on the floor in the square of sunlight and joins joey at the shelves, grabbing up the second folder.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{what am i looking for?}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{god knows. anything. contacts. clues.}
<A>__{terri opens up the folder and begins to pace the floor as she flicks through the contents.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{jesus. you're gonna pay her for this shit? it's like fucking business papers for god's sake!}
<A>__{bored, terri wanders off to lean against another shelf unit. angle over joey's shoulder on folder as she flicks through the contents. terri's dismissive summary seems justified. all joey sees are obscure and meaningless case notes and paperwork. each item is letter headed the channard institute. joey's hand reaches a large envelope. scrawled in hand across it is the phrase dr. channard personal papers. joey draws the contents out and begins to sift through them. the first item is a dusty, black and white photograph of an officer in english army uniform, circa 1920. joey blows the dust from the photo. low angle on box which sits on the floor in the shaft of sunlight, the dust from the photo settling next to it.}
<B>__{on joey}
<A>__{the next photo is that of a beautiful young woman. joey flips it over. gummed on the back is a type written slip that says cotton, kirsty case no.}
<B>__{on box}
<A>__{the sounds of the girls flicking through papers is heard off and then fades as something strange begins to happen. suddenly, the dust around the box begins to move as if blown by an invisible wind. it is drawn up so that it forms an impossible spiral in the air. spinning like a miniature hurricane, it hovers over the box. the sunlight seems to grow brighter. is it just reflections on the metalwork designs or is the box itself glowing and shining? close angle on joey's face as her eyes flick back and forth as she scans ... joey turns another item and her face registers surprise at what she is seeing ... the next item in the folder is a xerox sheet, a reproduction of what appears to be an ancient document. it is a diagram, like a designer's drawing or plan. and it is of the box seen from various angles. close angle on joey's face as she realizes what she is looking at.}
<C>__{joey}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{alright ...}
<A>__{joey turns, folder in hand, to look at the box on the floor and compare it to the diagram. joey gasps. the miniature tornado of spiralling dust suddenly disappears inside the apparently sealed box as if sucked down into it. as if on cue, the shaft of sunlight disappears behind a cloud as the last particle of dust disappears into the box. joey, mouth open in shock, lets the folder drop from her hand. the sound of its splayed contents hitting the floor alerts terri, who walks back round from the other shelf unit. terri looks at the dropped contents and then up at joey.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{joey ... ?}

<D>__{help me pick 'em up, terri. i think the lady just made a sale.}
