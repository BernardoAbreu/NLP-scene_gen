<L>__{exterior carter's house, front yard night}
<A>__{jessica storms through the yard toward carlos' car. carlos is right behind.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{where'd we park?}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{over here.}
<A>__{carlos begins walking over to his car, and jessica walks alongside. jessica is clearly drunk. passing by a now high emily backed up against a tree staring off into nowhere as male partygoer 1 kisses her neck, they arrive at carlos' car. carlos walks over to the driver side door, but jessica walks immediately over to the trunk.}
<C>__{carlos }
<D>__{what are you doing? get in.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{open the trunk.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{jess, let's get out of here.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{i want your bat.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{screw that.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{i'm gonna finish what i started. i'm gonna knock his teeth out.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{let's just go home.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{carlos, open the trunk!}
<A>__{carlos grudgingly obeys. he walks back to the trunk and inserts his key, then lifts up. jessica reaches in and grabs a wooden baseball bat. she shuts the trunk and looks over to the house. aaron walks through carter's front door and steps onto the porch, troy right behind. aaron is holding a bag of frozen vegetables to his head in the area where jessica hit him with the whiskey bottle. he spots carlos and jessica, and walks deliberately toward them.}
<C>__{carlos}
<D>__{get in the car.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{i'm staying, and so are you, so shut up.}
<A>__{carlos swallows his pride, too yellow to push the pointerior aaron moves toward jessica very quickly, but a look at the bat jessica is holding makes aaron keep his distance.}
<C>__{jessica }
<D>__{what's the matter? aren't you gonna put me in my place?}
<C>__{aaron}
<P>__{(calming down)}
<D>__{why don't you put that down.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{because i'm gonna use it to bash your head in.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{you really want to do that?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{you really wanna make me?}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{you're gonna do what you're gonna do, like always.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{what the hell's that supposed to mean?}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{let me show you something. can i show you?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{aaron}
<P>__{(inching closer to}
<D>__{jessica and beginning to}
<P>__{loosen his pants)}
<D>__{i just wanna show you something.}
<A>__{jessica stands back and holds the bat in a cocked position.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{no more 'a this shit, aaron. just stand back there. i will bash you with this, i swear.}
<A>__{aaron drops the frozen vegetables to the ground and loosens his pants.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{look, just hold on. i wanna show you this. i got it a little while ago, for your birthday.}
<A>__{aaron lowers the left side of his pants to reveal a scarring tattoo, which is placed above and to the side of his groin. jessica looks closer. troy, uncomfortable and not wanting to be there, lights up another cigarette.}
<C>__{aaron }
<D>__{can you see it?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{what the hell is it?}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{it's j. h. c. i got it for your birthday.}
<C>__{jessica}
<P>__{(not knowing what to say)}
<D>__{bullshit.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{will you come closer and look? troy, tell her.}
<C>__{troy}
<P>__{(to jessica)}
<D>__{it's your initials. i told him it was stupid.}
<A>__{jessica lowers the bat and walks cautiously up to aaron. she attempts to read the tattoo, which is difficult because of the low light and the scarring.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{you like it, don't you? i knew you would.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{you're an idiot.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{i know.}
<A>__{jessica touches the tattoo.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{does that hurt?}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{no. try whacking it with the bat.}
<A>__{jessica laughs as aaron smiles. troy is bored. carlos is miserable. jessica stands up in front of aaron, holding the bat loosely by her side, unsure of what to do. aaron gently grabs jessica around the elbows and pulls her close. he puts his arms around her and hugs her loosely.}
<C>__{aaron }
<D>__{can we just forget about this?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{aaron hugs jessica tightly as she drops the bat and hugs back.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{happy birthday.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{thank you.}
