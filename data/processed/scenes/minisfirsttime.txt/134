<A>__{mini leads him in.}
<C>__{mini }
<D>__{i know, it's stupid as hell to talk to a cop without a lawyer, but i didn't want to look jumpy and my first real interrogation? i could feel something tingle deep inside.}
<A>__{mini and garson take a seat. mini lights a cigarette. garson looks over her outfit again.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{it's a little early for the prom, isn't it?}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{a girl can dream, can't she?}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{perfectly legal. so, anyway, we got the preliminary coroner's report. although the pills knocked her out, she died of the carbon monoxide poisoning from the exhaust.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{is it that important?}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{well, it's just a little unusual for a suicide victim to use two methods. her choices seemed, i don't know how to put it... improvisational.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{well, maybe she wanted to drift off before the fumes got her? she clearly put some thought into that outfit.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{clearly...but dying from carbon monoxide poisoning is actually pretty painless, you just basically pass out.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{i doubt she would have had an intimate knowledge of how car fumes feel when you choke on them.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{i suppose you're right...also we checked the phone records and there was a 911 call placed at 8:12. it was a hang up and when the 911 dispatcher called back a few minutes later, there was no answer.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{any idea why she'd call 911?}
<C>__{mini }
<D>__{okie fine, this may be the most exciting thing i've done in a while, but even i know when the rush isn't worth the risk.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{look, i think you should come back when my father's around. he'll be upset i let a stranger in the house. g}
<C>__{arson}
<D>__{i think you're safe with me.}
<C>__{mini}
<D>__{even so, he won't be happy.}
<C>__{garson}
<D>__{not a problem, will he be home tonight?}
