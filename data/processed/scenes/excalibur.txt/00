<L>__{exterior forest night}
<A>__{darkness. the sound of battle cries and the clang of metal upon metal. the forest lights up with huge sparks flying from sword and ax as armored knights hack and swing at each other. mounted knights collide head on at full gallop, their armor made incandescent in the clash. sparks eddy in their wakes and float to the ground. the forest catches fire. main titles on the flames. out of the sounds of ancient battle grows music, heroic and barbaric, shot through with melancholy. two crazed eyes reflect the fire. the eyes belong to a man without age, at once ancient and boyish, female and male; his eyes are pained from the burden of too much knowledge. so close is he to the flames that a lock of his wild hair sizzles alight. he slaps at the fire as if it were an annoying insect. he wears a cloak of black trimmed with silver. it is merlin. the wizard weaves a path through the burning forest, dodging the combatants, searching.}

<D>__{lord uther! lord uther!}
<A>__{the forest around him weeps softly with the sounds that follow slaughter. patches of undergrowth are smoldering. small flames lick bark and branches. smoke floats through the trees and hovers over the bodies of the dying and the dead. a huge knight reins up beside merlin on a lathered horse. his armor is blood spattered. he is weary from battle. he looks down at merlin, his countenance fierce. the blade of his sword glows with an unnatural aura.}
