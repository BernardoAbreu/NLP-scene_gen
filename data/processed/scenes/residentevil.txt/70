<L>__{int air duct timeless}
<A>__{the commandos find themselves in an air duct. no room to stand. hardly room to sit. chris looks at his rifle stock. it's corroded from the acid in the zombie's mouth. jill notices.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{god...and it doesn't even stop them...}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{it's not meant to stop them. it's meant to stop...something else.}
<A>__{that distant snarling sound comes again, making jill shiver. the troop is strung out along the metal shaft. rebecca crawls among them, treating the worst burns. wesker checks his maps. speyer confronts him again.}
<C>__{speyer}
<D>__{we damn near got turned into rice krispies by that gizmo of yours. if you don't want me to nail that fuckin' thing into your ear, you deactivate it. right now.}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{i can't. they.. .fixed it... so you can't chicken out. the system can only be turned off at the main panel.}
<C>__{barry}
<D>__{where the hell is that?}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{where the explosives are. down... farther than we need to go. we only have to make it down one more level. if... when... we make it back up to the choppers... we can fly out of the detonator's signal range.}
<A>__{chris calls out from the far end of the shaft}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i'm not willing to rely on that. i live here, this is my town!}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{the town's been evacuated. just... just in case.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{that explains the lie. about the plane crash. an airplane down... with weapons on board... would nicely explain a big explosion, wouldn't it? you figured all along you might have to blow this place!}
<C>__{wesker}
<D>__{i don't want to do it. i... i hope i don't have to.}
<A>__{chris looks down the dim air shaft, unable to see wesker's eyes, hidden by distance.. .and by his dark glasses.}
<C>__{wesker }
<D>__{that's the best i can do for you, kid. good faith. now... let's knock on it.}
<A>__{wesker moves out. the troop follows.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{i...i can't let this happen. i've got to find that bomb.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{i will help. once wesker gets what he wants, my obligation is over.}
<A>__{chris looks at her with appreciative eyes .}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{no. i want you out. with the rest of them. wesker won't push the button until you're clear.}
<C>__{jill}
<D>__{he doesn't want to push the button.}
<C>__{chris}
<D>__{he has to. don't you see? he can't leave these labs here. and, jesus... walking corpses! he's gotta get rid of the evidence.}
