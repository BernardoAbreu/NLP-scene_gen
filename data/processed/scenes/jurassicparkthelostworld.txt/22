<A>__{while malcolm and eddie argue over something in the background, kelly circles around the trailers and looks up at the windows. they're all made of tempered glass, fine wire mesh inside it. she looks around, to see if anybody's watching. they're not, so she quickly slips inside the front trailer.}

<A>__{inside, the trailer is a miracle of planning and design. it's divided into sections, for different laboratory functions. the main area is a biological lab, with specimen trays, dissecting pans, and microscopes that connect to video monitors. next to it there's an extensive computer section, a bank of processors, and a communications section. all the lab equipment is miniaturized and built into small tables that slides into the walls. everything is bolted down. she notices a large map on the wall. off the coat of costa rica, there is an area that has been circled in heavy black ink. kelly puts a finger on the map, crossing westward, through the pacific ocean. thegre are dozen s of islands out here, but in the highlighted region, there is a semi circle of five. matanceros. muerte. tacano. pena. and sorna. underneath the whole island chain, there is a bold legend. "the five deaths," it says. slowly, an ocean barge starts to chug its way across the face of the map, leaving a wake that rolls the printed letters of those three ominous words.}
