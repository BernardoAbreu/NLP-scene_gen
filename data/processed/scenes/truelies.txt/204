<C>__{simon}
<P>__{(solemn)}
<D>__{then you know.}
<L>__{interior interrogation room night present}
<A>__{harry shakes his head and rubs his eyes, picturing the whole thing.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{why did you continue to see him?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{he needed my help.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{not because you were attracted to him?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you weren't attracted to him at all?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{well, maybe a little.}
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{is this a common thing for you? cheating?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{no! never!}
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{so, it was your first time.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i wasn't cheating!}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{tell me about your husband, mrs tasker.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{harry? what can i say about harry? he's a sales rep for a computer company.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(hard question for him)}
<D>__{would you say he was boring, then?}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(she sighs, nodding fatalistically)}
<D>__{yeah. i suppose he is.}
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{so sex with him isn't exactly making your flag wave anymore.}
<A>__{harry cuffs him on the shoulder. signals with a scowl for him to stay out of it. gib smirks. harry's put him through enough shit the last couple of days, it's time for a couple digs.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{that's none of your goddamn business! what kind of questions are these?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you're in a lot of trouble, mrs. tasker, so i suggest you cooperate. if we want to know the most intimate details of your life, you'd better tell us.}
<A>__{helen glowers at the mirror. her hands are shaking and she hates it that they can probably see she is afraid.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{my husband is a good man.}
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{but he's not exactly ringing your bell lately, right? i mean }
<A>__{harry covers the mike and whips around on gib.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{let me handle this part. do you mind?}
<P>__{(to helen)}
<D>__{why did you go to carlos' hideout?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{he wanted me to go with him on a mission, to pose as him wife.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{and you agreed?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(amazed)}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{helen searches herself for the explanation.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i don't know. i guess i needed something...}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{what did you need?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i needed to feel alive. i wanted to do something... outrageous. and... i don't know... it felt good to be needed. to be trusted. to be special.}
<A>__{in verbalizing it she just feels smaller, more pathetic that she ever did. she hates the unseen voices for making for try to explain her deepest, unvoiced needs.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{there's so much i wanted to do in this life, and it's like i haven't done any of it. and the sand's running out of the hourglass. i want to be able to look back and say: see! i did that. it was wild and it was reckless and outrageous and i fucking did it!}
<P>__{(she glares at the mirror)}
<D>__{and i frankly don't give a shit if you understand this or not.}
<A>__{gib looks at harry, eyebrows raised. whew! harry is studying his wife like she's some fantastic new species.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{this simon. did you sleep with him?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{gib}
<P>__{(covering the mike)}
<D>__{she's lying.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you didn't have sexual relations with him?}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(acidly)}
<D>__{look, if you ask me everything twice, this is going to take a really long time. and i have to get home to my family.}
<C>__{gib}
<D>__{you're not going anywhere.}
<A>__{helen loses it. it is fury and fear, tears and rage all at once }
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{let me out of her! right now!}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{answer the question }
<A>__{she picks up her stool and charges toward the mirror, swinging it with all her might. it bounces off harmlessly.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(she swings again, yelling)}
<D>__{i didn't sleep with him!}
<P>__{(and again wham!)}
<D>__{you hear me, you chickenshit bastards }
<A>__{wham! she hits the mirror again.}
<C>__{gib }
<D>__{everyone tries. it's unbreakable.}
<A>__{wham! wham! wham! the mirror suddenly stars from side to side with huge cracks. she's about to beat her way through it.}
