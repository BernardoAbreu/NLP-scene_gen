<A>__{vip room airport lounge. the scene moves very fast, indicating a sense of chaos. much smoke. many phone calls. half a dozen turkish police officers are bizarrely seated in a row of fold up chairs next to a desk. chattering among themselves (ad lib) lighting their turkish cigarettes. they hardly pay attention as: move to billy, scared, sweating backlit by the huge windows overlooking the airstrip. in background, we see the 707 pan american plane beginning to circle towards the runway. guards have stripped him down to his bare chest and now knife through the adhesive tape from two sides at once. then rip the tape off. billy winces. another angle the room. billy's luggage is being tossed. clothes fly through the air. a sweatshirt; marquette university rowing team. a 35mm camera. a gift package for his mother ripped open. a silver turkish kettle, clanging to the floor. another package is ripped open and a set of turkish tea cups smash and break all over the floor. very fast. billy watches, bewildered. he is stripped of the last plaque in of the confusion is that each time another police officer his navel. follow the plaque clattering onto the pile of forty plaques.}

<B>__{a loud sound off.}
<A>__{the door flies open and another officer strides in. paunchy, moustached. the room is suddenly silent as we track him in, followed by a grinning civilian flunky with a big portable photo instrument and bulb. the first officer jumps up from the desk, makes an obsequious salute to the second officer who arrogantly acknowledges it and takes the vacated chair behind the desk. the first officer moves to the first fold up chair in the row, pushing the police officer in that chair further down. this officer, in turn, shoves the next man down. it goes all the way down the line like a comedy until the last man in the row stands up against the wall. but this is all in the background as:}

<A>__{sharp sound off of film being ripped from camera. he darts a look at policeman stretching the undeveloped film out. another loud sound off, interrupting this the door flies open again and a third officer strides in, obviously the most important yet, because the second officer jumps up from the desk, and all the others immediately move down one seat in the hierarchy without a moment's hesitation. but the third officer strides right up to billy, waves to the second officer. the cameraman in background bubbles with enthusiasm, sliding into position. billy is puzzled what's going on? his arm is grabbed and he is swivelled around. reverse angle over cameraman billy in the middle, flanked by second and third officer, grinning like big game hunters, their arms on his shoulders. the first officer, sticking a bunch of hashish plaques into billy's hands, runs out of frame. billy looks from side to side. the second officer pats him hard on the back of the head, meaning 'look at camera'. billy glances at him, sees the grin on both the officers' faces. thinking this is the necessary expression, he grins at the camera. cameraman disgustedly looks up from his eyepiece.}

<D>__{no.. he's smiling. make him look miserable.}

<P>__{(running up)}
<D>__{gel? gel??}
<A>__{he growls, grabbing billy's arm and hauling him up, gathering the hashish plaques and putting them back in his arms. the two officers put their arms back on billy's shoulders. billy, in pain, makes the proper expression of misery. flash! the bulb goes.}
