<L>__{interior locker room, volleyball court day}
<D>__{chieko sits on a bench in her underwear. she looks aggravated and absorbed in her own thoughts. her other teammates get dressed. two of them walk past wrapped in towels, freshly showered, and stand in front of her. they talk to each other in sign language.}
<C>__{teammate 1}
<D>__{you shouldn't have lost your temper. we lost the game.}
<C>__{chieko}
<D>__{it wasn't my fault, it was the ref.}
<C>__{teammate 2}
<D>__{if you hadn't been thrown out, we would've won the game. chieko, angry, gets up and starts to rummage through her locker. her teammate walks over and gets her attention.}
<C>__{teammate 1}
<D>__{why are you in a bad mood? chieko doesn't answer. teammate 2 approaches.}
<C>__{teammate 2}
<D>__{she's always in a bad mood because nobody's fucked her yet. she caps this with an obscene gesture that bothers chieko.}
<C>__{chieko}
<D>__{i'm gonna fuck your dad to get rid of my mood. teammate 1 laughs, amused. teammate 2 gives chieko a scornful look. chieko smiles sardonically.}
