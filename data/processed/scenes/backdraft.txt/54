<A>__{rimgale walks up to his sedan.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{alderman swayzak.}
<C>__{swayzak}
<D>__{investigator rimgale.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{i need to get in the trunk.}
<A>__{swayzak's leaning on it. we sense the dislike between them. swayzak steps aside. rimgale pops the trunk.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{awful expensive shoes to be wearing at a fireground, alderman. but then i guess you haven't been to too many fires.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{i wanted to talk to you about alan seagrave's death. we still haven't gotten a fire report from your office.}
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{you'll have an answer as soon as i do.}
<C>__{swayzak}
<D>__{people are asking how a prominent taxpayer got stuffed through the windshield of his own car. they're asking me.}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{ the point is, investigator, you haven't even told us yet if the fire was accidental. we're starting to get the feeling your office is dragging out this case to embarrass the alderman because of his fire dept. reorganization program }
<C>__{shadow}
<D>__{ you mean his firehouse closing program, don't you?}
<C>__{jennifer}
<D>__{we'd just be very disappointed if it turned out your office was playing politics.}
<C>__{swayzak}
<D>__{ because i'm not. i care about this city, and i care about this department }
<A>__{rimgale cuts him off with the shutting of his trunk lid.}
<C>__{shadow}
<P>__{(calm of a monk)}
<D>__{alderman, i have a remarkably uncomplicated job. to decide if a fire's arson, and if so catch the pain in the ass doing it. but to be honest, if my methodical investigative methods just happen to muck up the campaign of certain mayor wanna bees, well, i guess i can't say i sleep any less peacefully.}
<A>__{and he walks back to the burned building.}
<C>__{swayzak}
<D>__{i wish i could just fire the son of a bitch.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{hey! swayzak!}
<A>__{stephen's leaning out of an upstairs window. as the tv cameras turn, he drops down onto a fire engine hose bed and pops right into swayzak's face with a murderous grin.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{we almost lost a whole company up there, swayzee buddy. isn't any back up since you closed '33. and we really appreciate it, the guys and me. honest. i know you've got my vote for mayor.}
<A>__{grindle and santos start walking for stephen. brian's there, following after them.}
<C>__{swayzak}
<D>__{look lt., i'm on your side. if there's a problem, please, work with our task force to fix it.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{oh yeah, your famous task force... three guys have already died this year because of the cuts made by your "task force"...}
<C>__{grindle}
<D>__{stevie, c'mon man...}
<A>__{stephen silences grindle with an outstretched hand. swayzak leans close, out of earshot of the cameras.}
<C>__{swayzak}
<D>__{you see that funny glow that's starting to blink in the corner of your eye, lt? that's your career dissipation light and it just went into overtime.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{if anybody's light's gonna blink, it's yours.}
<A>__{swayzak holds his ground. it's a tense, out of control moment between them. rimgale turns from his work, watches stephen with concern. adcox suddenly inserts himself face to face with swayzak and we see the raw hatred.}
<C>__{axe}
<D>__{you're in firemanland now, swayzak. do yourself a favor and just walk away.}
<A>__{swayzak holds adcox's gaze, then turns for his car. brian watches jennifer climb in beside her boss.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{this is your city job?}
<A>__{jennifer shrugs as they pull away.}
