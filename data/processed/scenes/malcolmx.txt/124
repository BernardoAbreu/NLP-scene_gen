<D>__{mr. x, before we start our discussion tonight the black muslims: hate mongers would you mind explaining for us the meaning of your name, which is the letter x.}
<A>__{angle panel opposing malcolm is dr. payson, a naacp type negro. close malcolm}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{yes sir. as you know, during slavery time, the slavemasters named most of the so called negroes in america after themselves. mr. elijah muhammad teaches us once you come into the knowledge of islam, you replace your slave name with an x. since we've been disconnected, cut off from our eastern culture for so long that we don't know the names we originally had, we will use x until we get back to the east.}

<D>__{thank you. now dr. payson.}
<A>__{close dr. payson}
<C>__{dr. payson}
<D>__{mr. x is a demagogue. he has no place to go, so he exaggerates. he's a disservice to every good law abiding negro in the country. can i ask you a question?}
<A>__{close: dr. payson}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{please, go ahead.}
<C>__{dr. payson}
<D>__{mr. malcolm x, why do you teach black supremacy? why do you teach hate?}
<A>__{close malcolm}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{for the white man to ask the black man if he hates him is just like the rapist asking the raped, or the wolf asking the sheep, "do you hate me!" the white man is in no moral position to accuse anyone of hate.}
<A>__{angle panel}
<C>__{moderator}
<D>__{certainly, mr. x, you must admit there has been progress.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{i will talk about "progress" in a minute, but let me finish with my brother.}
<A>__{malcolm gestures to the negro panelist. the black members of the tv audience are lapping it up. betty and earl also sit in the tv studio audience.}
<C>__{malcolm }
<D>__{stop me if i'm wrong. i "polarize the community." i "erroneously appraise the racial picture."}
<C>__{dr. payson}
<D>__{you put it very well.}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{you left one phrase out. another educated kneegrew said to me and i quote: "brother malcolm oversimplifies the dynamic interstices of the negro subculture." would you agree?}
<C>__{dr. payson}
<D>__{entirely.}
<A>__{angle malcolm}
<C>__{malcolm}
<D>__{well, i have this to say. do you know what a negro with a b.a., an m.a. and a ph.d. is called by the white man? i will tell you. he's called a nigger.}
<A>__{there is some blanching and guffawing from the audience. the moderator is totally embarrassed, betty roars.}
<C>__{malcolm }
<D>__{and i'm not finished. to understand this man }
<A>__{he points a sharp finger at the negro panelist.}
<C>__{malcolm }
<D>__{ you must know that historically there are two kinds of slaves. house negroes and field negroes. the house negro lived in the big house; he dressed pretty good; he ate pretty good and he loved the master. yeah, he loved him more than the master loved himself. if the master's house caught fire, he'd be the first to put the blaze out. if the master got sick, he'd say: "what's a matter, boss; we sick?" we sick! if someone said to him, "let's run away and escape. let's separate." he'd say, "man, are you crazy? what's better than what i got here?" that was the house negro. in those days he was called the house nigger. well, that's what we call them today because we still got a lot of house niggers running around.}
<A>__{there is applause from the blacks in the audience. moderator tries to regain control.}
