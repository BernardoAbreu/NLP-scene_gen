<L>__{exterior ramirez house backyard norfolk day}
<A>__{angle close on the barbeque's coals which burst into flame as fluid and then match are applied. over this we hear}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{i want to sue them, okay? i want to sue the guy who broke my ribs. i want to sue their government and their mossad... and i want to sue golda meir!}
<A>__{new angle on jack and ramirez they stand at the barbeque as joey plays shooting hoops. ramirez holds yolanda. ramirez and jack speak quietly.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{mrs. meir is dead, lieutenant commander.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{then you might want to have them dig her up because i intend to sue her.}
<A>__{jack chuckles.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{commander ramirez when i said i was from the government, perhaps i should have been more specific. i'm from the cia.}
<A>__{jack reaches down, opens his briefcase and pulls out a large photo album like briefing book. he opens it up and hands it to ramirez. on the first page there is an 810 enlargement of a photo of carlos entering a building. it is grainy but it certainly looks exactly like ramirez.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{does the man in that picture look familiar?}
<A>__{ramirez looks at the picture with the same look on his face that jack had when he saw ramirez for the first time.}
<C>__{yolanda}
<D>__{poppi...}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{that's not me... i mean i know it looks like me... but...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i know it's not you.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{it's... this carlos guy.}
<A>__{just then, joey yells from the tree he's in. jack automatically hides the picture as if the kid were from a rival intelligence agency.}
<C>__{joey}
<D>__{poppi, you don't need to watch the fire, come climb with me.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{get out of that tree, joey. your mother sees that and i'm dead.}
<A>__{now when jack speaks it is more guarded and in even quieter tones.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{this is the only recent shot we have of him... telescopic lens from half a mile away taken by the israelis. can you blame 'em for what happened? the only difference is the eyes.}
<A>__{ramirez looks at the picture in shock at the resemblance.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{okay i get it now, you're here to talk me out of my lawsuit. but see i identified myself but they kept me in that cell for two more days chained to that wall after i told 'em who i was so...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{lieutenant commander, i am not here about your lawsuit. carlos is the single most vicious terrorist in the world. he's personally carried out or masterminded the worst terrorist attacks in modern history. men, women, children. children like yours... blown to bits or slaughtered in cold blood. annibal... why did you join the navy?}
<C>__{ramirez}
<P>__{(as if by rote)}
<D>__{to serve my country.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{to serve your country... to protect her from her enemies. well carlos is one of her enemies now. and he'll probably become a bigger one... terrorism... unfortunately is a growth industry.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{why are you telling me all this?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{lieutenant commander, the governments of most countries in the free world have been after carlos for ten years and we have nothing to show for it. there is exactly one person in the world who can help us get carlos. and that person is you.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{what do you mean... to get him?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{all i can tell you is it may take as much as six months to a year of preparation. it will involve a high degree of risk. that much said, you may never as much as lay eyes on him yourself. but if we succeed carlos won't be a threat to anyone anymore. now i know you're going to need some time to think about it so...}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{no i don't need any time. the answer's no.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{annibal...}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{lieutenant commander... i am a naval officer... that's what i was trained for... that's what i'm good at... see you came to the wrong address. you want james bond. he lives in london and he's got an aston martin. you can't miss him.}
<A>__{we hold on ramirez's look and jack's half smile.}
