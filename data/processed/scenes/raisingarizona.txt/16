<L>__{extreme high angle}
<A>__{looking straight down at hi, asleep in bed. it is later: filtering softly in from the other room is the end of the "star spangled banner" on tv. we are craning down.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{that night i had a dream.}
<B>__{flash cut}
<A>__{for a brief moment we see a wall of flames and hear it roar.}
<B>__{back to hi}
<A>__{still craning down.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...i'd drifted off thinkin' about happiness, birth, and new life...}
<B>__{flash cut}
<A>__{wall of flames. deafening roar.}
<B>__{back to hi}
<A>__{craning down. the faint national anthem ends: we hear the weeeeeeee of a test pattern.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{but now i was haunted by a vision of }
<B>__{wall of flames}
<A>__{roaring. at the cut: whooooosh! a huge low rider motorcycle bursts through the flames, its engine roaring even louder than the fire. its driver is a huge leather clad hellion. the chains worn by the biker clank ominously as he rides.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{he was horrible...}
<A>__{the biker roars out of frame. low angle reverse as the biker roars into frame, his rear tire laying down a wake of fire.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...a lone biker of the apocalypse...}
<B>__{tracking on biker}
<A>__{as he roars along a ribbon of desert highway.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...a man with all the powers of her at his command.}
<A>__{the biker reaches for his bullwhip.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...he could turn the day into night...}
<A>__{the biker cracks the whip and, at the crack: the sky behind him turns instantly to black. bolts of lightning crackle across it as thunder roars.}
<B>__{another desert scene day}
<A>__{tracking with and also in on the biker from behind as he roars along a strip of highway. he is reaching for the two sawed off shotguns which are strapped crisscross across his back.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...and laid to waste everything in his path.}
<B>__{reverse track on biker}
<A>__{pulling the biker from a distance as he levels the two shotguns. the tracking camera pulls back further to reveal a running jack rabbit keeping pace with us in the foreground.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{he was especially hard on the little things...}
<A>__{crack as the first shotgun spurts orange the foreground rabbit keels over. the biker slues the other gun around. locked down wide shot on a rock in the foreground, a desert lizard suns himself. the biker is approaching in the distant background.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...the helpless and the gentle creatures.}
<A>__{crack from afar, the foreground lizard is blown away. locked down low angle wide shot of the empty desert road stretching away. in the foreground a lone desert flower blooms. the biker roars into frame.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{he left a scorched earth in his wake, befouling even the sweet desert breeze that whipped across his brow.}
<A>__{as the biker roars away, the foreground flower bends with his draft and then bursts into flame.}
<B>__{tracking on biker}
<A>__{from in front. he twirls the shotguns in either hand and reaches back to plunge them over his shoulders into their holsters.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{i didn't know where he came from or why...}
<A>__{we are moving in on his chest, where two crisscrossed bandoliers carry two rows of hand grenades, their silver pins glinting in the sun. we follow the line of one of the bandoliers up to his right shoulder which bears the tattoo: "mama didn't love me."}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{i didn't know if he was dream or vision...}
<B>__{reverse track on biker}
<A>__{from behind, booming down as we track. we are approaching the crest of a rise.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{but i feared that i myself had unleashed him...}
<B>__{high shot}
<A>__{of the biker approaching, craning down as he draws near.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...for he was the fury that would be...}
<A>__{with the crane down we momentarily lose him from view over the rise; then suddenly roar he tops the rise and, wheels spinning, is airborne}
<B>__{reverse}
<A>__{as he crashes back down to earth in the foreground and roars away. only now we are no longer in the desert: we are looking down a twilight street at the end of which is the arizona house.}
<C>__{voice over}
<D>__{...as soon as florence arizona found her little nathan gone.}
<A>__{the roar of his engine and clank of his chains recede as the biker gradually dissolves into thin air. we are left looking at the empty street and the faraway arizona house. the receding roar has left behind eerily beautiful singing, a woman singing a lullaby. faintly, behind the singing, there is also a droning high pitched noise. the camera starts floating forward very close to the ground, moving slowly toward the arizona house. the high pitched drone is becoming less faint under the singing. the camera is accelerating. the drone is growing louder we can now tell that it is a human scream. as we approach the arizona house we can see that a ladder is propped up to a second story window. we are moving quite fast now. the scream all but buries the singing. we are rushing toward the house, toward the base of the ladder, the sustained scream drawing us on. we hurtle toward and then straight up the ladder with no abatement of speed, sucked forward by the deafening scream. we reach the top and hurtle thwap! through the white curtains of the open second story window into the nursery to reveal florence arizona, her back to us, screaming over the crib. we are rocketing toward her. she is turning to us, hands pressed to her ears, mouth stretched wide in an ear splitting shriek and we are rushing into an extreme close up of her gaping mouth and her wildly vibrating epiglottis and we}
