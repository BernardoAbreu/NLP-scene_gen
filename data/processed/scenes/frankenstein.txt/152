<L>__{30 foot drop... and slams bodily into a snowdrift. he looks}
<A>__{up. the creature is peering down... and leaps over the edge to follow, sailing through the air to land before him in a cat like crouch. he pulls victor from the snow and sends him sliding across the ice with a mighty heave...}
<L>__{int ice cave day}
<A>__{...right into the mouth of an ice cave, victor comes tumbling and sliding down the entrance, spinning and careening to sprawl heavily to the cave floor. winded. battered. barely able to move. he glances up to see the cave filled with possessions. books. provisions. extra clothing. the embers of a fire burn low. there is even a rough attempt at furnishings in the form of a few crates. a huge shadow fills the cave entrance. the storybook ogre is coming home to his cave, breath huffing like a steam engine. victor scrambles back terrified, pressing into a corner as the creature enters... ...but the creature merely crosses to the fire and hunkers down. he tosses a few more sticks on the flames. pause.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{come warm yourself if you like.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{you speak.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{yes, i speak. and read. and think... and know the ways of man.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i've been waiting for you. two months now.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{how did you find me?}
<A>__{the creature grabs victor's journal off the "shelf." he unwinds the thong, the letters spill out.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{the letters in your journal. that and a geography book.}
<P>__{(picks up a letter)}
<D>__{your elizabeth sounds lovely.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{kill me and have done with it.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{kill you? hardly that.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{then why am i here? what did you want with me?}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{more to the point, why am i here? what did you want with me?}
<P>__{(off victor's look)}
<D>__{what does one say to one's maker, having finally met him face to face? milton gave it voice.}
<P>__{(grabs a book, thumbs to a certain page)}
<D>__{did i request thee, maker, from my clay to mould me man? did i solicit thee from darkness to promote me?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{fine words from a child killer. you who murdered my brother.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{your crime... as well as mine.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{how dare you. you're disgusting and evil.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{evil?}
<P>__{(scurries closer)}
<D>__{do you believe in evil?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{i see it before me.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{i'm not sure i believe. but then i had no one to instruct me. i had no mother... and my father abandoned me at birth.}
<A>__{he draws closer still. intimate. turning his head this way and that. puzzling at victor's face. softly:}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{were the dying cries of your brother music in my ears?}
<A>__{he raises his hand before victor's eyes, bony fingers curling to clutch an invisible throat. victor is petrified}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{i took him by the throat with one hand... lifted him off the ground. and slowly crushed his neck.}
<P>__{(emotion growing)}
<D>__{that poor, innocent child died in my grip... because all i could see was your face... and all i could feel was my rage. and when i let him go, he fluttered to the grass like a sparrow...}
<A>__{flashback insert: field the creature gazes down at willie's body. he stares at the hand that committed the crime as if waking from a dream. tears welling. overcome with shame and horror. he falls to knees in the middle of the vast field, his wail echoing across the countryside as he weeps over the boy.}
<B>__{resume ice cave}
<A>__{victor stares in horror as the creature relates his story with tears shining in his monstrous eyes.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{later, when they were searching, i followed the pretty lady who got lost in the woods...}
<A>__{flashback insert: barn justine is asleep in the hay. haggard, wet, exhausted. the creature looms over her, a monstrous shape backlit by the lightning, gazing on her beauty. his hand reaches down, hovering reverently, wishing to caress the swell of her breasts at the neckline of her bodice ...}
<C>__{creature }
<D>__{she was so lovely. i longed to touch her... and seek her sympathy...}
<A>__{the locket drops from his hand to dangle in his fingers. he lowers it, tucking it gently away in her pocket}
<C>__{creature }
<D>__{...but i simply returned the object which had triggered my crime, hoping in some small way to atone...}
<B>__{resume ice cave}
<A>__{now tears are shining in victor's eyes as well.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{you gave me these emotions, but you didn't tell me how to use them. now two people are dead. because of us.}
<A>__{victor is crushed by remorse. a sob escapes him.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{why, victor? why? what were you thinking?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{there was something at work in my soul which i do not understand.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{what of my soul? do i have one? or was that a part you left out?}
<P>__{(spreads his hands)}
<D>__{who were these people of which i am comprised? good people? bad people?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{materials. nothing more.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{you're wrong. do you know i knew how to play this?}
<A>__{he grabs up the recorder, plays a brief snatch of melody.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{in which part of me did this knowledge reside? in these hands? in this mind? in this heart?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and reading and speaking. not things learned... so much as things remembered.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{trace memories in the brain, perhaps.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{stolen memories. stolen and hazy. they taunt me in my dreams. i've seen a beautiful woman lying back and beckoning for me to love her. whose woman was this? i've seen boys playing, splashing about in a stream. whose childhood friends were these?}
<P>__{(soft, intense)}
<D>__{who am i?}
<C>__{victor}
<P>__{(hollow)}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{then perhaps i believe in evil after all.}
<A>__{the creature moves off. victor is emotionally exhausted}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{what can i do?}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{there is something i want.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{a friend.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{friend?}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{a companion. a female. like me, so she won't hate me.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{like you? oh, god, you don't know what you're asking.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{i do know that for the sympathy of one living being, i would make peace with all.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i have love in me the likes of which you can scarcely imagine. and rage the likes of which you would not believe. if i cannot satisfy the one, i will demonically indulge the other. that choice is yours.}
<P>__{(off his look)}
<D>__{you're the one who set this in motion, frankenstein.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{and if i consent?}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{we'd travel north, my bride and i. to the furthest reaches of the pole, where no man has ever set foot. there we would live out our lives. together.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{no human eye would ever see us again. this i vow.}
<A>__{pushing slowly in on victor. considering it. beaten.}
