<A>__{billy walking the courtyard counting his paces 48, 49, 50 turns, goes back.}
<C>__{susan's voice}
<D>__{...my dearest billy. i know it is long and it is hard for you, but your family and i are thinking about you all the time. i am trying hard to make enough money nights to come and see you. your father says that lawyer yesil wants another $2000. i know you distrust him more and more, but your father wants to do everything he can, and he is borrowing all he can on the mortgage of the house. money seems to be the only way out of there. except of course the other way...}
<A>__{billy, max and bell (bandaged around the ass from the stabbing) are huddled around bell's bunk late night candle burning, a sheet sealing off some of the kogus. bell furtively looks around, pulling out and elaborately unfolding a set of drawings from a pack of letters.}
<C>__{susan's voice}
<P>__{(continuous)}
<D>__{...but i cannot say i am for it. nor are your parents. they consulted the priest, and he said to send you money for that reason would be like sealing your death.}
<C>__{bell}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{the blueprints!}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{to what?}
<C>__{bell}
<D>__{the prison, man. there was this german cat an architect in the hospital. he was helping the turks build some shit round the place. i laid some bread on him and he let me copy them.}
<A>__{billy, puzzled, turns the drawings upside down, sideways. the drawings are a lunatic mess of scrambled lines, dots, crosses.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{max and billy, trying to follow the map, look at each other dubiously.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{too bad you didn't have a machine.}
<C>__{bell}
<P>__{(intent)}
<D>__{there's two ways out i figger over the roof, but that's only one person, maybe two. the other way is under.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{tunnel?}
<C>__{bell}
<P>__{(grins)}
<D>__{it's already built! there's a basement substructure where they used to keep weapons and stuff, but beneath that there's these old catacombs that the christians built 'bout a thousand fucking years ago to bury their dead. we're sitting right on top of it here.}
<A>__{insert drawing, illustrating roughly the structure of the prison. his finger tracing, bubbling with nervous enthusiasm.}
<C>__{bell }
<D>__{the kraut said there's a whole bunch of hollow sealed shafts sort of like dumbwaiters running along this wall; one of them is right in there, right next to our shower. we get in there, he says, we can get down into the catacombs. with three of us working....}
<P>__{(stops)}
<A>__{max is standing, tapping on the wall, listening, a funny look on is face.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{gotta be here someplace. thought i heard a couple of dead christians singing down there.}
<B>__{another angle}
<C>__{bell}
<P>__{(irritated)}
<D>__{stop shitting me, man!}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(trying to be serious)}
<D>__{but how would you get into the shaft, jimmy?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i suppose you knock three times and ask for st. peter.}
<C>__{bell}
<P>__{(turning on max)}
<D>__{hey! i'm getting this together man and i don't need no fucking gastro head along on this trip!}
<P>__{(a fierce look at}
<D>__{max then back to}
<P>__{billy)}
<D>__{we go through the wall.}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(a resigned look on his face)}
<D>__{we go through the wall?}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(quite sure bell is out of his skull)}
<D>__{we go through the wall.}
<A>__{bell between billy and max walking in the courtyard continuing intently:}
<C>__{bell}
<D>__{...the kraut was right! i checked it out there's no reinforced steel in those bath walls. they're real soft from underground seepage }
<A>__{bell reaches the wall, turns around and continues lowers his voice occasionally as other prisoners intersect them.}
<C>__{bell}
<P>__{(gesturing profusely)}
<D>__{ the water like "'weeps" through the cement, see. twenty, thirty years, you can almost push it over. all we do is use gastrohead's screwdriver here and scrape the mortar out. pull out 2, 3 stones, squeeze through, put 'em back, and get our ass down the shaft, it's a two night operation, maybe three.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{and what do you do when you in the catacombs?}
<C>__{bell}
<D>__{the catacoombs? whaddya want, a door? there's miles of em like a sewer system but they got to come up someplace in istanbul.}
<A>__{max is fed up with it now, no longer joking.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{you gotta be fucking crazy! you got stabbed in the ass once too much, sweetheart, cause you're gonna end up in section 13, that's what not the 'catacombs.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{section 13?}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(looking at bell)}
<D>__{yeah, for the criminally insane.}
<P>__{(looks at billy)}
<D>__{i was there once for two weeks and it ain't an illusion. it's awful. namidou runs it like a death camp, that's where he spends most of his time...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{where is it?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i don' t know. it's someplace down in there....}
<P>__{(points at the ground)}
<D>__{..deep.. a big door...a wheel....}
<A>__{his eyes go back in time, haunted, vague breaks off.}
<B>__{another angle}
<C>__{bell}
<P>__{(low keyed)}
<D>__{hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here? it's not a map, max. it's our balls. you know what i mean...}
<P>__{(straight at max,}
<D>__{billy, very sincere, his eyes almost}
<P>__{watering)}
<D>__{...i gotta get laid man, i don't know 'bout you guys, but if i don't get it on soon, i'm... i'm not gonna make it.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{shit.}
<C>__{bell}
<D>__{billy?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{...the roof sounds better to me than digging through a wall. ziat's round there all the time. but the roof....}
<P>__{(looks up)}
<A>__{p.o.v. the roof, its edges visible over the courtyard. billy shakes his head.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{the bullet percentage is awful high.}
<A>__{a pause. billy looks away from bell's stare.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{if i get caught, jimmy, i'm facing another months. i'd be back up to 3 years, maybe more...}
<A>__{looks down. bell understands, deeply disappointed.}
<C>__{bell}
<D>__{well fuck it! choose your own death, babe, i'm taking the roof out of here!}
<A>__{bell leaves:}
