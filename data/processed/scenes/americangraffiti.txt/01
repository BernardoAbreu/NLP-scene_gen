<L>__{70... 90... 110... 130. and we begin to hear voices strange}
<A>__{songs, fading conversations and snatches of music drifting with static. pulling back further, we realize it is a car radio filling the screen and radio stations we're hearing, until the indicator stops. there's a pause...and suddenly we are hit by a blasting out of the past, rocking and rolling, turn up the volume, pounding intro to a vintage 1962 golden week end radio show back when things were simpler and the music was better. and now a wolf howl shatters through time as the legendary wolfman jack hits the airwaves, his gravel voice shrieking and growling while the music pumps and grinds...}
<C>__{wolfman}
<D>__{awwrigght, baay haay baay! i got a oldie for ya gonna knock ya right on de flowa baay haay hee baay!}
<A>__{the wolfman howls like a soulful banshee as "rock around the clock" blasts forth. mel's drive in dusk a neon drive in casts long shadows across a vast parking lot as the sun drops behind a distant hill. a large neon sign buzzes in the foreground... mel's drive in, while in the background, "rock around the clock" blares from the radio of a beautiful decked and channeled, white with red trim, tuck and rolled '58 chevy impala that glides into the drive in. main titles appear over action. steve bolander stops the elegant machine and gets out. he looks around, then walks to the front of the car and leans against the flame covered hood. steve is eighteen, good looking in a conservative, button down, short sleeved shirt. most likely to succeed, president of his graduating class. he looks around the empty drive in, then hears a funny little horn. a vespa scooter bumps into the lot. a young kid waves at him and suddenly grabs the handlebars again as the scooter nearly topples. terry fields ("the toad") maneuvers the scooter next to steve's chevy but misjudges and ricochets off the trash can before stopping. terry grins sheepishly. he's seventeen, short but plenty loud, both vocally and sartorically in his pink and black shirt, levis, and white bucks. he looks slightly ridiculous but always thinks he's projecting an air of supercool. steve watches terry smooth back his shiny ducktail and primp his waterfall to a perfect cascade over his forehead. he unbuttons his shirt one more button and lowers his pants to look tough. terry walks over and leans against the flamed car, imitating steve who pays him no mind. in the background, we hear the wolfman howling with the music. the record ends and a barrage of humor begins from wolfman jack. the wolfman is an unseen companion to all the kids. witty and knowledgeable about the trivia that counts, he's their best friend, confidant, and guardian angel. now, a grey, insect like citroen deux chevaux putters into the parking lot and stops on the other side of the lot. steve and terry watch curt henderson get out. curt stands by his little car. he's seventeen, a curly bespectacled, scraggly kid with a summer grown moustache and a paperback stuck in his bermuda shorts. curt thinks of himself as the town cynic. in reality, he's a hopeless romantic. he starts over to his buddies.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{hey, whadaya say? curt? last night in town, you guys gonna have a little bash before you leave?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{the moose have been lookin' for you all day, man.}
<A>__{steve reaches into his pocket and hands curt an envelope without saying anything. curt opens it slowly and pulls out a check.}
<C>__{curt}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{oh great...}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{whadaya got, whadaya got? wow two thousand dollars. two thousand doll !!}
<A>__{steve looks at curt suspiciously; curt seems somehow guilty.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{mr. jenning couldn't find you, so he gave it to me to give to you. he said he's sorry it's so late, but it's the first scholarship the moose lodge has given out. oh yeah, he says they're all very proud of you.}
<A>__{curt hands the envelope back to steve.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{well... ah... why don't you hold onto it for a while?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{what's with you? it's yours! take it! i don't want it.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i will take it.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{steve... ah, i think we'd better have a talk. i've gotten }
<A>__{suddenly a horn honks and they all turn. laurie henderson pulls into the drive in and waves to them. she is driving the family's '58 edsel.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{your sister calls. i will talk to you later.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{now, steve! let her wait.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{okay, make it short and sweet.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{yeah, well... listen...}
<P>__{(clearing his throat)}
<D>__{i... i don't think i'm going tomorrow.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{what! come on, what are you talking about?}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{i don't know. i was thinking i might wait for a year... go to city }
<A>__{laurie honks the horn a couple of times. steve ignores her. there is a long moment and curt looks uncomfortable.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you chicken fink.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{wait, let me explain }
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you can't back out now! after all we went through to get accepted. we're finally getting out of this turkey town and now you want to crawl back into your cell look, i gotta talk to laurie.}
<P>__{(he hands the check back to curt)}
<D>__{now take it. we're leaving in the morning. okay?}
<A>__{suddenly, there's an ear splitting roar and they all turn as a yellow '32 ford deuce coupe chopped, lowered and sporting a hemi v8 bumps into the lot. the low slung classic rumbles and parks at the rear of the drive in. big john milner, twenty two, sits in his ford, tough and indifferent, puffing on a camel. he wears a white t shirt and a butch haircut molded on the sides into a ducktail. a cowboy in a deuce coupe simple, sentimental and cocksure of himself.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you wanna end up like john? you can't stay seventeen forever.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{i just want some time to think. what's the rush? i will go next year.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{we'll talk later.}
<A>__{steve walks off toward laurie's edsel. laurie gets out. she's wearing a letterman's sweater with a large "class of '62" emblazoned on the shoulder. steve goes to her and they hug. on the radio, the music ends, and the wolfman's intro tune comes on.}
<C>__{radio}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{"here comes the wolfman wolfman jack!"}
<C>__{wolfman }
<D>__{oh, we're gonna rock and roll ourselves to death baby. you got the wolfman jack show!}
<A>__{mel's drive in night as the radio blares "sixteen candles," we see that with the darkness burger city has come alive. a continual line of hot rods pulls into the parking lot to check out the parked cars, then returns to the maindrag. carhops glide by on roller skates. curt and john are fooling around in front of the deuce coupe. a horn honks and they turn as a '60 ford with three girls in it slows by them. a girl leans out the window and smiles.}
<C>__{girl}
<D>__{hi john!}
<A>__{the girls in the car all screech and giggle as they zoom off.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{not too good, huh?}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{why is it every girl that comes around here is ugly? or has a boyfriend? where is the dazzling beauty i've been searching for all my life?}
<A>__{john watches the procession of gleaming cars traveling through the hot night.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{i know what you mean. the pickin's are really gettin' slim. the whole strip is shrinking. ah, you know, i remember about five years ago, take you a couple of hours and a tank full of gas just to make one circuit. it was really somethin.'}
<A>__{suddenly, in the distance, there's a blood curdling scream from an incredible high performance engine. the entire drive in stops and listens.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{hey, john. someone new in town.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{ahhh.}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{you gonna go after him?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{hey, listen, professor, if he can't find me, then he ain't worth racin', right?}
<C>__{curt}
<D>__{the big shot!}
<A>__{across the swarming parking lot, steve sits in the front seat of his chevy with laurie. budda macrae, a car hop, leans down to attach a tray to steve's window, showing off her tight blouse.}
<C>__{budda}
<D>__{a cherry vanilla coke and a chocolate mountain. anything else you want, steve?}
<P>__{(steve shakes his head.)}
<D>__{if there is you let me know now. just honk and i'm yours.}
<A>__{she tucks in her blouse a little tighter, gives him a hot look and goes to get the other tray. budda takes the other tray around the car, almost shoves it in the window where laurie is sitting.}
<C>__{budda}
<D>__{one fries grab it before i drop it.}
<A>__{she gives laurie an antagonistic look and goes off. steve laughs. laurie smiles. she's seventeen, very pretty, with big doe eyes, and a short bobbed hairdo. she pushes up the sleeves on steve's letterman sweater, which is sizes too large for her. his class ring glints on a chain around her neck. laurie is sweet, the image of vulnerability, but with a practical and self preserving mind beneath.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{where was i?}
<C>__{laurie}
<D>__{um, how you thought high school romances were goofy and we started going together just because you thought i was kinda cute and funny, but then you suddenly realized you were in love with me, it was serious... and ah... oh, you were leadin' up to somethin' kinda big.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you make it sound like i'm giving dictation. well, seriously, what i meant was, that ah... since we do care for each other so much, and since we should really consider ourselves as adults. now, i, ah... could i have a couple of those fries?}
<A>__{through the windshield of the chevy, they see terry run by in front of them, chasing budda macrae who's outdistancing him on her roller skates.}
