<A>__{toby stands in front of a full length mirror wearing a huge scout uniform that's been unsuccessfully cut down for him. the shirt sleeves have been shortened but the shoulders extend two inches beyond the ends of his shoulders. the pants legs have been cut off and hemmed but the crotch of the trousers hangs down three inches too low, giving him a stumpy, dwarfish look. toby yells to someone o.s.}
