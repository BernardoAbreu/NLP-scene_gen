<L>__{45 commissioner's office. inside. night.}
<A>__{in the commissioner's office, the assistant commissioner dictates:}
<C>__{assistant commissioner}
<D>__{guilty: lardjane boualem, manual worker, married with three children. resident in rue de thebes, number eight ... so? how many today?}
<A>__{the employee removes the copies from the typewriter and begins to put them in order.}
<C>__{employee}
<D>__{seven assaults, three dead.}
<A>__{then he moves to the desk, and hands over the various copies for signature.}
<C>__{employee}
<D>__{here, one for the commissioner ... the press offices ... the archives ... and one for you, sir.}
<A>__{the assistant commissioner signs.}
<C>__{assistant commissioner}
<D>__{good, thank you, corbiere... . see you tomorrow.}
<C>__{employee}
<D>__{good evening, sir.}
<A>__{the employee salutes, then moves toward the door. he is about to go out when the assistant commissioner stops him.}
<C>__{assistant commissioner}
<D>__{tell me ... where is this rue de thebes?}
<C>__{employee}
<D>__{rue de thebes? in the upper casbah, i think ...}
<C>__{assistant commissioner}
<D>__{all right. see you tomorrow, corbiere.}
<C>__{employee}
<D>__{good evening, sir.}
<A>__{the employee leaves and closes the door. the assistant commissioner crosses the room to the large map of algiers which covers the entire wall. he moves his finger along the casbah zone; as he moves it, he follows it with his glance in that tangle of streets.}
<C>__{assistant commissioner}
<P>__{(to himself)}
<D>__{rue de thebes ... de thebes ...}
<A>__{he has found it. he observes it for a minute, then moves his finger along the road leading to the european quarters. he finds the right route, then concentrates in order to memorize it. he returns to the desk, lifts the receiver, and dials a number.}
<C>__{assistant commissioner}
<P>__{(on the phone)}
<D>__{hello, engineer henry amaud, please ... he's already left? alright, yes, yes, alright ... i have the number.}
<A>__{he clicks the receiver, then dials another number. at the other end of the line, a feminine voice is heard. the assistant commissioner abandons his usual peremptory tone.}
<C>__{assistant commissioner}
<D>__{hello, bernadette...yes, right away. i'm going to change my clothes first, and i will be right there. my wife is already there, right? no, it's not important. but call henry for me. just for a minute ... alright ... thanks ...}
<A>__{he places the receiver on the desk, then puts on his jacket which is on the back of his chair. he straightens his tie. now from the receiver a muffled voice is heard; the assistant commissioner picks up the receiver.}
<C>__{assistant commissioner}
<D>__{hello, henry? ... everything's okay. good. what are we going to tell our wives? the club? good idea, yes. i will be there right away. just give me time to change my clothes ... ah, i've found the address. no, it's better to talk in person. yes, it's the right place ... okay. bye.}
<A>__{he puts down the receiver, then goes to the coat hanger and takes his beret. he goes out after glancing again at the photos of the day's assaults.}
