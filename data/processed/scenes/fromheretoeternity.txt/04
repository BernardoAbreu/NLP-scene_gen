<B>__{medium shot}
<A>__{the dayroom has a pool table, ping pong table, a radio, etc. moth eaten, upholstered chairs line both walls. the place is empty as prew enters. he looks around casually, sees the pool table in an alcove. he moves over to it, puts the bugle mouthpiece in his pocket, picks a cue from the rack on the wall. he switches on the light, chalks the cue.}
<B>__{medium close shot}
<A>__{the triangle of balls is already racked on the table. prew addresses the cue ball, shoots and breaks the rack solidly. he watches the balls hurry around the table.}
