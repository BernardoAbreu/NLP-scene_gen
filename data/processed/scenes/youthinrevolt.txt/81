<L>__{interior nick's room day}
<A>__{a knock on the door. lefty enters the room and nick pulls the headphones off his ears.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{hey, lefty.}
<C>__{lefty}
<D>__{what's with your mom, nick? she gave me the third degree just to come up here.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i vandalized jerry's trailer and she found my picture of lacey.}
<C>__{lefty}
<D>__{well, good thing i stole this from the bookstore then.}
<A>__{lefty unzips his backpack and produces a large hardbound volume titled lovemaking for advanced gourmets.}
<C>__{lefty}
<D>__{i was reading it all last night. boy, having sex is a lot more complicated than i thought. did you know you were supposed to stick your pinkie in her bumhole?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you lie.}
<C>__{lefty}
<D>__{no way, man. here, i got the page marked.}
<A>__{lefty flops down on the sofa next to nick and the two of them flip through the manual.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{yeah, but i'm not sure i should try this on sheeni. i think this book is for people who've been married so long they're disgusted by the sight of each other.}
<A>__{they regard the illustrated figures of men and women in various states of foreplay.}
<C>__{lefty}
<D>__{are we really supposed to be that... uh... big?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i think these illustrations are disproportionate for emphasis.}
<C>__{lefty}
<D>__{maybe we should compare.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{perhaps we should. just for the sake of research.}
<A>__{nick and lefty get to their feet and stand opposite each other like a pair of duelists. they simultaneously undo their belts and pull their pants and underwear to their feet. they straighten. lefty's eyes fall to nick's crotch. he gets a hint of concern in his expression. nick stares at lefty's, tilting his head to compensate for the curvature. the door behind them opens and estelle appears toting nick's lunch. she lets out a scream. the boys turn to face her, pants around their ankles.}
<C>__{estelle}
<D>__{perverts!}
<A>__{she hurls the tray of food at them. lefty bolts. nick hastily tries to pull up his pants as his mother chases him around the room, grabbing up objects and hurling them his way.}
<C>__{estelle}
<D>__{friggin' goddamn perverts!}
