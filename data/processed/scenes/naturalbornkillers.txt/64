<D>__{i didn't play mallory, the murderer. i didn't play her as a butcher. i played her as a woman in love, who also happens to murder people. i didn't want her to be at arm's length from the audience or myself. if you play her as this wild maniac, the audience never has to deal with her. if you see a decapitation in a movie, you just say 'oh wow, a neat special effect.' because you can't relate to a decapitation. it doesn't mean anything to anybody because it's not personal. decapitations don't fall into most people's realm of life experiences. but if you show somebody in a movie getting a paper cut, the whole audience squirms. because everybody can relate to a paper cut.}
