<A>__{we have four quick cuts. bam! bam! bam! bam! in each one, ramirez who stands in the center of the trainers, whirls like a ballet dancer and beats each trainer to the punch, hitting dead center on each one with his paint pellet gun. from the side, amos and jack nod to each other approvingly.}

<D>__{the plan is to get the kgb to eliminate carlos for us. carlos knows every link between the kgb and every terrorist organization in the world. he's not only the smoking gun, he knows every contact there ever was. we make the kgb think that carlos is ready to turn... ready to go over to the cia, and they'll take him out.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{why would they think carlos would go over to the cia?}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{money... fifty million... not for the forces of world revolution this time, but for him, in his pocket with a new identity and cia protection. they'll believe it... if we lay it out right... they'll believe it.}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{when do we move?}
<C>__{amos}
<D>__{not so fast. you're far from ready. i would think another three months of training and then...}
<C>__{ramirez}
<D>__{bullshit! i'm ready now. give me any test you want. christ, i already passed your tests... what more do you want?}
