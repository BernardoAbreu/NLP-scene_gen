<A>__{julianne alone in his room, looking around frantically. no worries about this guy making his bed every day, stuff, clothes, strewn everywhere, the bathroom looks like a cherry bomb just detonated. she's tramping through a bachelor's debris, wearing only her towel, looking, looking... there it is. the corner of his laptop sticking out from beneath a discarded bedspread. she snatches it up, opens it, sets it on the cluttered desk, and... ... stops. there are wallet sized snapshots of kimmy. some alone. some as a little girl. some with michael. and next to them... ... the plastic fold out wallet inset. that he has not yet quite rearranged. so she picks it up. leafs through, until she finds what she was praying would be there... ... julianne grinning. michael's arm around her. on the deck of a boat. they have drinks in their hands. happiness in their eyes. and she stares at it. jesus, god, how long has he carried this around? she flips through further, all the rest have her in them. maybe half a dozen. her heart is throbbing. her eyes are damp. back to the one on the boat. she slips it from the plastic window. holds it. then, gently... ... puts it back where it belongs. punches up the goddamn laptop. this is it, girl! do or die.}
