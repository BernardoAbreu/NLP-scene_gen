<D>__{i know that man, seagrave, the stunt driver. i think he's genuinely hurt.}
<A>__{helen makes her way down the rickety grandstand steps toward the road, and james follows her.}
<L>__{exterior country road night}
<A>__{just as james and helen step on the road, six police cars, lights flashing and sirens wailing, converge on the lit stretch of road, three from each end. they screech to a halt and dozens of cops pour out of the cars. the crowd panics and streams down from the grandstand on to the road. a loudspeaker mounted on one of the police cars begins to blare.}

<P>__{(over loudspeaker)}
<D>__{this is an illegal and unauthorized automotive demonstration which is in contravention of the highway traffic act. you are all liable to fines and possible arrest and confinement... disperse at once! disperse at once!}
<A>__{because james and helen are just in advance of the first wave of spectators, they manage to link up with vaughan as he helps haul a still groggy seagrave off the road and into the woods. helen takes seagrave's free arm.}
<C>__{helen}
<P>__{(to vaughan)}
<D>__{what's the matter with seagrave?}
<C>__{vaughan}
<D>__{hit his head, i think. his balance is off.}
<A>__{the police spread out through the crowd, collaring people at random before they are able to escape into the woods.}
