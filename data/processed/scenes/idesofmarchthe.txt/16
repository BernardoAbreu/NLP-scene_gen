<L>__{interior cincinnati ramada inn the bar night}
<A>__{stephen, paul, ida, and ben are having drinks around a table. the mood is festive. there is a piano player playing, singing. paul has a roll away suitcase beside him.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{so paul, tell me something i don't know...tell me what's gonna happen on the 15th.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{ha ha.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what do you think stevie?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{it's ours for the taking.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{ben?}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{we'll win.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{what do you think ida?}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{i'm asking you.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you tell me and i will tell you.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{if had to say, i'd say it'll be close, but you'll eke it out.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{eke?}
<A>__{to stephen.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{you see, she's trying to get under my skin.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{so what's gonna happen?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{us by nine.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{nine? there's no way you'll win by nine.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{at least. maybe more.}
<C>__{ida}
<P>__{(to paul) so you're certain you're}
<D>__{gonna win here?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{certain? no. confident? yes.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{you just said you'll win by nine.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{and i think we will, but i won't tell you it's a sure thing. fucking saint gabriel can blow his horn on election day and get his four horseman to rig the ballot boxes for pullman and it wouldn't surprise me. don't get me wrong. six presidentials i've done and i've never felt this good. but am i gonna sit here and say "yes we will definitely win ohio"? not a chance. in the last thirty years seventy three democrats have run for president. how many have won? three.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{that means seventy guys ran who thought they had a chance, and they all lost.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{so you're saying there's a good chance you won't win.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{don't twist my words. what i'm saying is that i'm not going to promise we'll win. but he's decorated by bush senior from the first gulf war and protested the second. he left his state with a balanced budget and the fourth highest education rate. the republicans have nobody out there that can touch this guy...so for this moment, this election, this primary is the presidential. and that ida, is the state of the union. and on that note, i'm gonna take a shit.}
<A>__{paul swigs down the rest of his drink and exits.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{so stephen...}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{yes ida?}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{stephen, stephen, stephen....}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{here it comes...hit me.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{paul's going to the airport?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{yes?}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{getting on a plane.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{mmhmm.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{where is that plane going?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{three guesses.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{not going back to headquarters.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{correct.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{he's not going to texas?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{no need, we'll split texas, it's a wash.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{what if i said north carolina?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{that's your guess?}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{he's going to north carolina.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i will neither confirm nor deny that statement.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{i knew it. now tell me why.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{that i cannot do.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{i hate you.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{you love me.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{i love paul. you i hate.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{you only love him because he gives you all the scoops.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{sexual favors?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{you're engaged.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{if it meant a good scoop my fiance would understand.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{ida }
<D>__{you really buy into all this crap? all this take back the country nonsense?}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{ida i'm not naive about this stuff. i've worked on more campaigns than most people do by the time they're forty...i'm telling you this is the one.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{you really have drunk the kool aid.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{i have drunk it it's delicious. i don't care whether he leads in the polls...i don't care whether he has all the tools...because the truth is, he's the only one that's going to make a difference in peoples lives...even the people that hate him. if mike morris is president it says more about us than it does about him. i don't give a fuck if he can win. he has to win.}
<C>__{ida}
<D>__{or what? the world will fall apart? it won't matter...not one bit to the everyday lives of everyday fuckers who work and eat and sleep and get up and go back to work again. if your boy wins...you get a job in the white house...if he loses you're back at a consulting firm on k street...that's it. you used to know that before you got all goosebumpy about this guy. morris is a politician...he's a nice guy...they're all nice guys.}
<C>__{ida }
<D>__{he will let you down...sooner or later.}
