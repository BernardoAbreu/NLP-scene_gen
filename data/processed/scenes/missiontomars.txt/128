<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{how do you feel?}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{like i just got back my other three percent.}
<A>__{mcconnell smiles. terri enters through the hatch, removing her helmet.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{the backup generator is salvageable, and two of the solar panels. i'm pretty sure i can get the oxygen still back into production, too. so we're not in such bad shape, considering.}
<C>__{luke}
<D>__{good work, terri.}
<A>__{mcconnell, rummaging through phil's backpack, drops an already opened bag of m&ms. the candies scatter and bounce all over the floor.}
<C>__{mcconnell}

<A>__{luke and terri smile. mcconnell scoops up the fallen m&ms. he slows down as he does it, looking at the scatter of little round candies. something tugging at the back of his mind...}
