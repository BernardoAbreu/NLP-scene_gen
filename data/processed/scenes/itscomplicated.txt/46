<C>__{dr. allen}
<D>__{you know, things happen in life and our job is to find out why. what we have to do is take a real look at this. are you ready to do that?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i am. definitely. i've made a list of what this can possibly be about...at my end. can i read it to you?}
<C>__{dr. allen}
<P>__{(taking his seat)}
<D>__{of course.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(digging out her blackberry)}
<D>__{thanks. i e mailed it to myself.}
<P>__{(reads from blackberry)}
<D>__{okay. am i still trying to figure out why the marriage failed? do i want to get back together? do we have unfinished business? is this about revenge? am i just... lonely? or, is it my "caretaker" thing?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{you know, the kids are finally gone and now all of a sudden jake's back and i get to take care of him in some way...}
<A>__{dr. allen nods, impressed with the work she's done.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{and, listen, i get how therapy works, i do... we look at things, we examine them, weeks turn into months, what....? we're going on eight years, right?.... and i'm okay with that, i like it... but in this case, i need to know what you really think. like, i'd like you to say... don't do this, it's absolutely wrong or go ahead, you'll be fine. i actually want to be told what to do.}
<C>__{dr. allen}
<D>__{what's interesting is i'm already seeing you open up more than i have in some time. i'm thinking, through this affair, you may learn to view the world in a different way.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i need more concrete. are you saying i should keep seeing him? because, honestly, if the guilt and fear could go away, maybe i could let go a little and figure this out.}
<C>__{dr. allen}
<D>__{i wouldn't resist looking at this.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(mulls that over quickly)}
<D>__{okay... and another way of saying that is....?}
<C>__{dr. allen}
<D>__{let go jane. it can't hurt.}
<A>__{jane fist pumps in the air.}
