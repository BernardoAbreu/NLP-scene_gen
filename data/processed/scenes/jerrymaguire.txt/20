<L>__{interior luggage area morning}
<A>__{dorothy looks through the rubber flaps of the luggage conveyor belt. she clutches a cup of coffee. in the background, other smi agents' grab their bags and exit.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{ray! ray!}
<A>__{maguire enters picture, joining her as she looks into the dark depths behind the flaps.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{can i help?}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{oh. hi. i work in your office. i was on the junket to the conference. i'm }
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i know who y6u are. you're dorothy boyd. you're in... wait... you're in accounts. you have the middle cubicle toward the back with that poster of albert einstein morphed onto shaquille 0 neal's body.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{hmm. pretty good.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{now what did you lose?}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{my son... my mind...}
<A>__{over her shoulder, maguire sees ray rounding the corner, riding the luggage conveyor belt like washington crossing the delaware.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{well, while i go look for him, why don't you hang onto this curious gentleman behind you }
<A>__{dorothy turns, is greatly relieved to see ray, and snatches him off the belt. she bends down into his face. she speaks softly but intensely, with no frills.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{remember "imagination?"... remember what that means? well, this is one of my bosses so you will now imagine me screaming at you right now. do not do that again. ever ever ever.}
<A>__{she rises, shifting back to being a somewhat relaxed young woman of 26. it's a transition she makes, oh, 500 times a day.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{well, thanks.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{well, take care.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{and have fun at your bachelor party.}
<A>__{jerry pauses just a moment, but it's long enough. dorothy freezes.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{oh no.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{no no. i knew.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<P>__{(slow sigh)}
<D>__{nnnnn. i just killed the surprise.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{no, i'm just... anxiously looking past it. i already had my bachelor party. it was called "my twenties." see you later.}
<A>__{jerry takes off.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{i loved your memo, by the way.}
<A>__{he stops. turns. she flashes the well thumbed copy in her purse. jerry takes a step closer, interested and flattered.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{thanks... actually, it was just a "mission statement."}
<A>__{ray has taken jerry's free hand, and begun swinging on him.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{i think in this age, optimism like that... it's a revolutionary act.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(eager for feedback)}
<D>__{you think so?}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{oh tsht. yes.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{i appreciate that, because some of that stuff... you know, it was two in the morning and...}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{ the part about "we should embrace what it is still virginal about our enthusiasm" }
<A>__{jerry looks slightly edgy at the naked vulnerability of his words.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{ "and we should all force open the tightly clenched fist of commerce, and give a little back for the greater good.". i mean, i was inspired, and i'm an accountant. ray, don't spill my coffee.}
<A>__{jerry looks more nervous, as ray has now taken his mother's hand. he is now swinging on both of them.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{one two three... swing.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{hey. to respect yourself enough to say it out loud, to put yourself out there, so openly...}
<P>__{(shakes her head)}
<D>__{... i don't know, it got me.}
<A>__{now jerry looks concerned, as ray continues swinging happily.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{one two three, swing.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{thanks. may i offer you both a ride?}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{oh no. i'm sure it would just make your day to drive us all the way to manhattan beach, taking that left down to little tiny waterloo street where you have to play chicken with oncoming traffic, and your life flashes before your eyes, but hey, i've obviously had too much coffee and all here's my sister laurel to pick us up. thanks, though. bye.}
<C>__{jerry}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{dorothy. ray. a pleasure.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{one two...}
<A>__{jerry lets ray down easy. the kid is a little disappointed. but maguire bows, always courtly, and exits to get his bag. he then realizes something amiss and returns quickly, pulling ray's hand up again and completing the swing.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{... three, swing.}
<A>__{ray is now happy, in love even, as jerry exits. dorothy laughs, as her sister arrives. laurel boyd is 36. no make up, no bullshit. laurel has a pin on her sweater, which catches on dorothy's shirt as they hug.}
<C>__{laurel}
<D>__{come on, i'm double parked.}
<A>__{dorothy returns to the world of motherhood, bending down, gathering ray's toys. she wipes at ray's hair. ("don't put food in your hair.") she is surprised that she's a little jazzed from her encounter with jerry maguire. she can't help but look back at jerry, who catches her looking. he salutes her, with mock circumstance. she returns it with a guilty smile. he disappears, and she finds herself oddly short of breath.}
<C>__{dorothy}
<P>__{(to herself)}
<D>__{hmmph. whoever snagged him must be some classy babe }
