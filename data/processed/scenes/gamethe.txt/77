<A>__{an underground ramp, signs reading "emergency vehicles only," a set of doors leading into the lobby of an emergency room; medical personnel visible inside, injured people, etc., a few people mill outside the doors. the ambulance screeches to a stop, the back doors fly open, the paramedics wheel out the dying man and rush into the entrance, automatic doors open and close for them. schuyler and christine climb out, disoriented, walking more slowly to the doors. the ambulance pulls away behind them. schuyler nearly slips in a mysterious dark puddle.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{oh, this day keeps getting better.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{what is your problem, you think the whole fucking world revolves around you?}
<A>__{as she says this, she walks right into the electric doors, which fail to open for them. their pov through the doors the gathered staff and patients all turn at once to regard christine and schuyler. they grin and wink. on schuyler and christine, who barely get the chance to register this before the lights go out... pitch blackness and sudden silence. we hear only schuyler's bitter laughter. dialogue over darkness:}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{as a matter of fact...}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{what the fuck is going on?!}
<A>__{we hear rustling in a purse, but still see next to nothing.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{it's a little hard to explain...}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{try!}
<A>__{we hear the striking of a match, there's some orange light christine holds the match. the whole area is deserted, except for the two of them. schuyler kicks at the glass doors they're not going to give, nothing is visible beyond them.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i seem to be playing a game. this is supposed to be funny }
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{i don't get it.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{ a challenge, a puzzle.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{ok, i'm puzzled. where are we?}
<A>__{schuyler has found a steel door with a glowing red sign: emergency use only. he yanks it open and a pail swings down, dumping water on his head. he's facing a brick wall through the door. christine can't help but laugh, then yelps in pain as the match burns her fingers. lights another. schuyler flips open his phone.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{damn it, no signal.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{here's a lightswitch }
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i wouldn't }
<A>__{she flips it on, a blinding strobe flashes for a few seconds both cry out then the bulb explodes in a shower of sparks.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i don't know the rules, if there are any, but it seems the obvious move usually backfires...}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{of course. i have no idea what you're talking about.}
<A>__{they've taken a few steps forward, exploring the dark. she lights a cigarette with the next match, nearly running into another door. she rattles it locked.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{son of a bitch.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i think i have a key.}
<A>__{schuyler pulls out his keyring and tries the gold crs key nope.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{damn it...}
<P>__{(a beat, thoughtful)}
<D>__{wrong key...}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{last match.}
<A>__{in the matchlight, we see schuyler fumbling in his pockets, pulling out the rosy sunglasses from the rasta. he puts them on.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{too bright for you, is it?}
<A>__{schuyler's pov as the last match goes out christine glows red in the matchlight for a moment, then as soon as it goes out, we see a glow of fluorescent paint on the ground... a series of stripes and arrows in different colors, glowing. these start parallel near where he stands, then radiate in different directions. christine is but a silhouette against the colored lines.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{i can see now. grab my arm.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{no way! you're crazy!}
<A>__{christine moves away from him.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{stay on the path!}
<A>__{a burst of flame erupts from the ground close enough to scare the shit out of christine, who screams. schuyler hurries toward her. the flames vanish, she lurches in a differrent direction }
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{christine, don't move!}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{leave me alone!}
<A>__{she loses her footing on a slippery surface, falls, sliding down a gentle slope.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{help!}
<A>__{schuyler follows. falling himself. they try to reach toward each other for purchase, but it's no good, the slope is getting steeper.}
