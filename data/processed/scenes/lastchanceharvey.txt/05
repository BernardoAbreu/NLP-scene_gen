<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior plane night}
<A>__{harvey, seated in a crowded economy cabin, looks down from the now extinguished seat belt light. he looks a little hot. reaching up to turn on the air, he knocks his tray knocking his drink into his lap.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{an attractive middle aged woman, seated next to him, looks over.}
<C>__{harvey }
<P>__{(to a passing stewardess)}

<C>__{stewardess}
<D>__{i will get you some napkins.}
<C>__{harvey}
<P>__{(to his neighbour)}
<D>__{why's it always me?}
<A>__{the woman, perhaps wary of the length of the flight, smiles noncommittally. the stewardess returns.}
<C>__{stewardess}
<D>__{shall i take that?}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{thanks... and could i get another?}
<C>__{stewardess}
<D>__{a whiskey, wasn't it?}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{yes. `jamesons', no ice.}
<A>__{the stewardess heads off. harvey mops himself up. he places the small mass of wet towels on his tray and sighs. glancing out the window, he then turns to the woman.}
<C>__{harvey }
<D>__{a holiday?}
<A>__{the woman looks over.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{no. business.}

<C>__{harvey }
<P>__{(beat expecting more of a response)}
<D>__{they both work there, you see.}
<A>__{the woman smiles again, then looks up as the stewardess returns with harvey's drink.}
<C>__{harvey }
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{harvey is about to continue speaking when the woman interrupts.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{i'm really sorry but i have a meeting in the morning and i must try and get some sleep.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{no... of course. i'm sorry.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{it's just, i will be useless unless i get some sleep.}
<C>__{harvey}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{the woman covers herself in a blanket and turns out her light, turning herself away from harvey. we hold on harvey from a distance, spotlit in a sea of darkness.}
