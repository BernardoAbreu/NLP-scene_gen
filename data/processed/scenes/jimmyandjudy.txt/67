<A>__{jimmy pulls the camera from the screen and points it at judy to get her reaction. her eyes are locked on the screen. judy's face drops. we, on the other hand, are dying to see what she's looking at. jimmy swish pans back to the tv and zooms in tight. the television fills the frame.}
<L>__{exterior ghetto cop car cam (for vegas motel) night}
<A>__{(from sc. 37, p. 64) on screen we see something completely new. it's a black and white security cam style video image. just as the announcer described, this is the kind of image that comes from a video camera that's mounted on the inside of a cop car. it's static and covered with date time text, etc. on tv, we finally get a chance to see what transpired when jimmy and judy were pulled over. judy is standing outside the cop car. the moment she sees it approach, we see her freak just a bit and get into the car quickly and suspiciously. the cop gets up, gets out of the car and goes over to the driver side to talk to jimmy. after a few moments, he summons jimmy out of the car while judy waits. the cop asks jimmy to open the trunk. he doesn't have his gun drawn, but he is being cautious, one hand on his gun holster, the other shining on jimmy's face with a flashlight.}

<D>__{go ahead and open it.}
<A>__{jimmy stands by the trunk of the car, but he's not really obeying the cop's commands. he's stalling. the cop is getting suspicious. we can barely hear what they're saying to each other over the noise of traffic that whizzes by. there's an unintelligible exchange, then... the cop steps forward, raising his voice.}

<C>__{cop}
<P>__{(on tv)}
<D>__{on the vehicle, now!}
<A>__{the cop and jimmy are sort of at a standoff. jimmy finally leans over and puts his hands on the trunk. the cop comes in close to jimmy, pulling his hand from his gun holster and shifting it to pull his cuffs off his belt. at that exact moment, jimmy makes his move, leaping for the cop. he takes the cop to the ground and off screen. all we see is a barely decipherable image of judy freaking out in the passenger seat because she can't see what's going on and neither can we. about 5 seconds go by. boom! a gunshot is fired. it feels like an eternity, then... jimmy pops up off the ground. he's got the cop's gun! he hesitates, not knowing what to do. he pauses, hesitant, then shoots down towards the ground, where the cop is lying out of frame. he runs around the front of the car and into the driver seat. there's a moment of hesitation as jimmy and judy seem to be screaming at each other in the car, then... jimmy slams on the gas and the car takes off into the distance. the image on the tv cuts away and back to the anchorman.}
