<C>__{skeeter }
<D>__{listen...all that talk in there today. hilly's talk i mean...i'm sorry you had to hear that.}
<A>__{aibileen quickly turns her back to skeeter. a gospel choir begins singing on the radio.}

<D>__{could you do that to mae mobley?}
<A>__{aibileen slowly turns back to skeeter.}
<C>__{aibileen}
<D>__{no, ma'am. i couldn't...}
<C>__{skeeter}
<D>__{do you have an address for her or anything?}
<A>__{aibileen shrugs her shoulders, reeling it all back in. just then, elizabeth walks into the kitchen holding papers stapled together. she looks between aibileen and skeeter.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{i'm sorry. did i interrupt something?}
<A>__{skeeter and aibileen shake their heads. elizabeth hands skeeter the papers. home help sanitation initiative is written on the cover.}
<C>__{elizabeth }
