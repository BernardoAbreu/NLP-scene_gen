<A>__{grimacing as dr. copper pinches a scalpel to his thumb and collects a small portion of his blood in a dish. all the men have been tied up. palmer, childs and garry on the small couch. the others, including the lifeless corpse of clark, in chairs. copper returns the plate to the table and sets it down in line with the other plates of blood that he has collected. the names of each man have been scribbled onto the plates. macready slides the doctor a fresh plate.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{now you.}
<A>__{copper cuts his thumb, his blood dribbles onto the plate. he stands nervously for a beat.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{slide it back here.}
<A>__{copper pushes it toward macready.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{now step way back.}
<A>__{copper steps backward, moisture beginning to collect on his brow. macready begins to heat the copper wire over the bunsen burner. the men watch intently. the wire begins to glow. macready points the torch directly at the doctor. both of them perspiring. macready lifts the glowing wire from the flame. the doctor is dead still. macready slowly touches the wire to the doctor's plate. a soft hiss. macready heats it again and tries once more. the same soft hiss. macready and the doctor both let out a sigh.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{i guess you're okay.}
<C>__{dr. copper}
<P>__{(shaken, facetious)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{i didn't think you'd use that fibrillator on norris if you were one of them.}
<A>__{he hands copper the torch.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{watch them.}
<A>__{he cuts himself with the scalpel and begins collecting his own blood.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{now i will show you what i already know.}
<A>__{he heats the wire and puts it to his plate. the same harmless hissing. all eyes continue to watch as he tries again. the same result. childs mumbles.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{load of bullshit.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{we'll see. let's try clark.}
<A>__{he heats the wire and lays it in clark's dish. the hissing.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{so clark was human, huh?}
<A>__{macready nods.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{so that make you a murderer.}
<A>__{macready glances over the group.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{palmer now.}
<A>__{he sets palmer's plate in front of him and heats the wire.}
<C>__{garry}
<D>__{pure nonsense. this won't prove a damn thing.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{thought you'd feel that way, garry. you were the only one who could have gotten to that blood plasma...}
<P>__{(placing the wire in palmer's dish)}
<D>__{...we'll do you last...}
<A>__{screech!!! the blood howls, trying to crawl off the plate. palmer bolts forward with incredible force, racing for macready; his face splitting; his mouth roaring dragging the couch, childs and garry with him. he smashes into macready knocking him over the table.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{copper!!}
<A>__{it's all happened too fast. copper tries to get off a burst of flame. the ever changing palmer breaks his bonds and leaps on the doctor. the others sit helpless, struggling at their bindings. macready dives on palmer's back and the three go rolling to the floor. screeching. crackling. macready pounds viciously at palmer's head. a powerful, shirt splitting arm sends him skidding across the floor. copper momentarily has control of the torch. just as he positions it, palmer's mouth splits from his chin to his forehead and engulfs the entirety of the doctor's head. the big torch slaps against the wall. palmer bounds to his feet, wrapping his arms around the dangling, struggling body of dr. copper. the men are screaming hysterically. macready tries to fire up the bruised torch. busted. won't work. frustrated, he charges up behind palmer and begins hammering the thick steel instrument over his head. the shirt of palmer's back erupts in macready's face. splitting and ripping wildly, exposing the beginnings of yet another orifice. a blackened, iron strong tongue lunges outward. stunned, macready manages to elude it, diving for the top of the table by the boxes of dynamite. macready lights the fuse of a thick roll and bounds from the table. palmer awkwardly spins in circles, swinging the doctor's body like a propeller blade, struggling to keep on balance, as he advances on macready. the second orifice, spitting and snarling as it continues to take form. macready waits until palmer's back spins around, facing him. only two yards away, macready flings his lit roll into the ever evolving second mouth and leaps onto the couch covering childs and garry with his body. a muffled boom, as the swallowed explosive ignites from deep within palmer and sends his flesh splattering all over the room. macready rolls away from childs and garry as fast as he can.}
