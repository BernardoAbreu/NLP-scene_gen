<L>__{exterior haymaking (kashin) day}
<A>__{a prospect: next to a country road, a large expanse of meadow is being mown forty swathes at a time by forty mowers swinging their scythes almost in unison. closer levin is suffering but keeping up, bathed in perspiration. his place is behind an old man, theodore, who is scything as if without effort. just in time for levin, theodore calls a halt and takes levin's scythe to sharpen it with a whetstone. levin attracts a few grins and comments.}

<D>__{konstantin dmitrich, you'll know your rows when the field's all done!}
<A>__{levin's row has stalks of differing heights between the even swathes on either side. there is some laughter, but the men are uneasy.}
