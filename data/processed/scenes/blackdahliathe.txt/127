<C>__{madeleine}
<D>__{hmmm...she was this poor girl...came from nothing...but then she carried nothing with her, either. i don't know...when you're rich sometimes you romanticize the poor...}
<C>__{bucky}
<D>__{i wouldn't know.}
<A>__{an awkward silence as she considers her foot in her mouth. he studies her for a moment. pulls her close, kisses her mouth...the arch of her neck...they begin to move together again... another lapd form: "witness report: lorna martikova...aka linda martin..."}
