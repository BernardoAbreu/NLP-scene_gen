<T>__{time cut to:}
<A>__{close a tv screen showing a clip of the "3 stooges" at their moronic best.}
<B>__{julius}
<A>__{sits watching the tv, nodding in amusement, laughing, slapping his knee in pleasure. he returns his attention to the book he's been reading something the size of a dictionary but can't help returning his gaze to the tv. he freezes at the sound of a knock at the door. embar rassed by what he's been watching, he quickly turns off the tv, and goes to answer the door, still holding the book.}
<C>__{julius}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{you forgot your key i know. lucky i waited up.}
<A>__{julius opens the door, revealing marnie, who walks in right past him.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{hi vince and linda want to be alone, so i'm afraid i'm going to stay here. which bed should i take?}
<C>__{julius}
<P>__{(stunned)}
<D>__{either... i always sleep on the floor.}
<A>__{watched by julius, marnie pulls the curtains shut, kills the overhead lights, all the while providing him with glimpses of various parts of her anatomy. she gets into one of the beds, turns off the bedside lamp.}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{good night.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{good night.}
<A>__{julius puts the blanket and pillow from the other bed onto the floor between the two beds, then shuts off the other lamp. silence...}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{this mattress is awful.}
<A>__{getting out of bed, she pulls the blanket and pillow with her as she steps over julius, who tries not to look up, and gets into the other bed.}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{sorry. good night.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{good night.}
<A>__{silence...}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{this mattress is just as bad as the other one.}
<A>__{she gets out, again dragging the blanket and pillow, puts them down on the floor next to julius. she crawls under the blanket, turns her back to him.}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{this is better... good night.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{good night.}
<A>__{silence. marnie shivers, chattering her teeth.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{are you cold?}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{it's alright.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{no, please, take my shirt. i'm baking.}
<A>__{julius strips it off and hands it to her. she puts it on and pulls the blanket over her shoulder. again she shivers.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{you still cold?}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{just my legs.}
<A>__{julius lies there, thinking about it.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{well, i could give you my...}
<C>__{marnie}
<P>__{(sitting up)}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{julius reaches under the blanket, removes his bottoms and passes them over. marnie puts them on under her blanket.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{anything else?}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{i'd love a glass of water.}
<C>__{julius}
<P>__{(realizes that he's now nude)}
<D>__{right.}
<A>__{he wraps his blanket around his waist, goes into the bathroom, comes out with a glass of water. he hands it to her.}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{she spills the water all over her top and bedding.}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{oh, great!}
<A>__{she starts stripping off everything she's wearing. julius averts his eyes.}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{do you mind if i share your blanket? mine's all wet.}
<C>__{julius}
<P>__{(gulps)}
<D>__{no that would be okay.}
<A>__{they both lie down under his blanket. silence...}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{could we switch sides? i like to sleep on the left.}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{she starts to roll over julius, then pauses directly above him and looks him dead in the eye.}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{can i ask you something for a change?}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{anything.}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{do you like me? i mean, even a little bit?}
<C>__{julius}
<D>__{i... i'm crazy about you, marnie. but there's something about me you ought to know.}
<A>__{marnie tenses, expecting the worst.}
<C>__{marnie}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{julius}
<P>__{(looking away)}
<D>__{i'm a virgin.}
<A>__{marnie glances heavenward, and silently mouths the words "thank you." she smiles down at julius and starts very gently kissing him.}
