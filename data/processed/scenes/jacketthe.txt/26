<L>__{interior morgue, basement, alpine grove, late night}
<A>__{the first face starks sees as the world comes into focus is nurse harding's. around it loom those of dr. becker, dr. gries and damon. a shot of the room shows a constraint ridden apparatus hanging sternly on the wall. it is the jacket: an apparatus designed to encase a man's body. made of coarse, sickly stained red ands brown canvas and velcro restraints that would first chafe, then forever burn, the skin they're wrapped around, the jacket looks medieval. its appearance suggests its purpose: to slowly strangle the life out of a man. starks has been stripped of his blue uniform and is lying nearly naked on a burial slab in the cold of the basement. even under the tranquilizers, starks formidably resists them as the orderlies wrestle to strap him in. then starks, sensing as anyone would, that something bad is being done to him, wisely stops resisting long enough to petition them.}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{wait. wait a minute... please.}
<A>__{becker motions for them to stop with his hand. starks blinks, trying to bring the faces above him into focus...}
<C>__{starks}
<D>__{i, i don't belong here.}
<A>__{becker looks into starks' eyes. sanity stares back.}
<C>__{becker}
<D>__{no. i don't think you do either. [beat] but neither of us can do anything about that.}
<A>__{becker barely nods and starks is trussed in the jacket with metal clamps. becker writes some details down, presumably about starks' treatment. a cadaver drawer just barely deep enough for a body or tall enough for the height of a nose is slid open and starks, already dreadfully sheathed in the jacket, is crammed inside. the orderlies slam the cadaver drawer into the wall.}
