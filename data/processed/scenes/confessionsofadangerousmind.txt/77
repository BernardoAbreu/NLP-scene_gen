<L>__{exterior field day}
<A>__{the car stops in a deserted field. barris gets out first. his shirt is soaked through with sweat. suddenly there's a commotion inside the car. renda has gotten hold of a gun. he shoots brazioni and benitez. barris panics and dives behind the car. renda steps cautiously outside of the car, looking for barris. barris grabs renda's foot. renda falls, the gun flies from his hand. barris kicks the gun under the car, his own gun drawn. he points the gun at renda, who is on his stomach. barris doesn't shoot. he's scared, shaking wildly. renda looks up at barris, trying to figure him out. he slowly rises to his feet, turns to barris with a pleading look in his eyes.}

<D>__{oh christ. oh crap.}
<A>__{barris tries to stop renda from screaming by covering the hole in renda's face. barris throws up, some of it landing on renda's pants. he wipes his own mouth with his bloody hand and looks at the still screaming renda. the churchgoers are starting to squint in barris's direction. barris shoots renda again. and again and again and again and again. more blood spatters barris's clothing and face. the church bell continues to chime.}
