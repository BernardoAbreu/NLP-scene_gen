<L>__{exterior front yard day}
<A>__{her face streaked with tears, claire stumbles out into the immaculately manicured rose garden. the yard is surrounded by a high wooden fence. she collapses into a lawn chair as the tears begin to subside. suddenly, she hears something coming from next door. she cocks her head and attempts to make out the sound. it is, ironically, the sound of a woman crying. claire makes her way over to the fence. the women's sobbing becomes more plaintive and fevered. she places her face against the prickly, vine covered fence and tries to peer through the crack. all she can make out is a dark blue blur that seems to be rocking. claire gathers her nerve and calls out...}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{hello...}
<A>__{there's no reaction.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{mrs. feur?}
<A>__{the sobbing chokes down to a breathless whimpering. the blue shape vanishes from view.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{wait a minute. i just want }
<A>__{something bumps against the fence. claire draws back. she hears heavy breathing.}
<C>__{mrs. feur}
<P>__{(sniffling)}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{it's mrs...it's claire...spencer. from next door. is everything }

<C>__{mrs. feur}
<D>__{i've seen you. from the window.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{is everything alright?}
<A>__{claire leans closer to the tiny crack. she sees a fleshy blur and what might be part of an eye. there's no response, just the breathing.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{hello?}
<C>__{mrs. feur}
<D>__{i'm not...}
<A>__{she seems on the verge of losing it again.}
<C>__{mrs. feur}
<D>__{he's so...it's too much...and i can't...i can't breath...}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{who? your husband?}

<A>__{she trails off.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{what? what are you afraid of?}
<C>__{mrs. feur}
<D>__{i can't, no, no, i can't...}
<A>__{claire edges closer to the crack.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{tell me. please.}
<C>__{mrs. feur}
<D>__{that i will just...that one day i will just...disappear.}
<A>__{beat. claire's taken aback by this admission.}

<D>__{tell me. i can help you.}

<D>__{how? how can you help me? with your flowers and your perfect life...}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{that's not...it's not like that.}
<C>__{mrs. feur}
<D>__{i've never even met you.}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i know. and i'm sorry. i've been consumed with...my daughter left...for school.}
<C>__{mrs. feur}
<D>__{this fence...it's so...}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{i'm sorry. it's for the flowers. why don't you...}
<A>__{tires can be heard crunching the gravel as a car pulls into the feur's driveway.}
<C>__{mrs. feur}
<D>__{oh god. he's back. i'm sorry. please forget that i...i don't know what i'm saying. please...}
<C>__{claire}
<D>__{wait! don't go...}
<A>__{claire listens to the sound of naked footsteps, followed by a large front door swinging shut. a car door swings open and a man's shoes follow down the path. claire pulls back from the crack and leans against the fence as the door closes a second time. she sits there for a moment listening, but all is quiet.}
<C>__{claire }
<D>__{she sounded terrified.}
