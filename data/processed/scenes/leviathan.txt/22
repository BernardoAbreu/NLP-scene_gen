<A>__{jones working the intercom.}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(to intercom)}
<D>__{jones to doc. doc?...cobb?}
<A>__{he looks back to beck, concerned.}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(to beck)}
<D>__{think it got 'em?}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{no, it's not going through. the intercom's busted. i thought dejesus fixed that?}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(beat, realizing)}
<D>__{he did.}
<A>__{infirmary same doc leaves his office and slowly goes into the infirmary to the storage counter across the room where the blood is stored. we see what disturbed him...the door to the refrigeration unit is ajar. doc opens the door to the cabinet. the plastic bags are now empty. each one has been drained. lower ring corridor same cobb moves out of the infirmary, carefully down the eerie corridor, his mining tool in front of him for security. there is a sinister feel to the place. each step only reveals a little bit of space ahead of him. suddenly he stops. in front of him across the hall a cabinet which says: onboard communications, is torn open. it is where dejesus fixed the intercom the day before.}
<B>__{close on the cabinet}
<A>__{the door is shattered. carefully, cobb opens the door and we see the guts of the wiring have been torn out the entire system has been disabled. cobb carefully examines the damage when suddenly a scaly hand like appendage slams into the cabinet door trapping cobb and sending his weapon to the floor. cobb turns directly into the leech like mouth! it's sharp teeth shine in the light, poised to strike. cobb's eyes closed, screams like a maniac, waiting for the tentacle to attack. then suddenly an ungodly scream echoes in the corridor. cobb opens his eyes to see the tentacle gone. doc is holding the smoking mining drill, his eyes glazed, as if he has seen the devil itself.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(absently)}
<D>__{it...almost got you.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{what was it?}
<A>__{doc shakes his head dumbly. he is in total shock.}
<B>__{the mess}
<A>__{the remaining group is assembled around the table. jones watches the door with one of the homemade flamethrowers. he listens.}
<C>__{cobs}
<P>__{(excitedly)}
<D>__{i saw it! it's big!}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{big?}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{bigger than dejesus? how?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{it's had a meal.}
<A>__{he holds out the empty blood bags. a change has come over doc since bowman's death. the experience has slightly deadened him.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{it needs blood?}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{fucking great...you telling me we got a fucking dracula in here with us?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{it would explain the suction like appendages.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{like a leech.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{that's why there's a dead one on the ship. it ran out of blood.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{what dead one on the ship?}
<A>__{he looks from doc to beck.}
<C>__{jones}
<P>__{(sharply)}
<D>__{someone want to let the rank and file in on your little secret?}
<A>__{doc looks at beck, then jones.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{the monster appears to be a genetic aberration...}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{no fuckin' lie...}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{...it has many traits of deep sea marine life...regeneration, scales, gills, even a period of dormancy...}
<P>__{(more to beck)}
<D>__{but the fact that it remembered where the plasma was stored, or where the communication wiring was, may imply that it has some other quality...}
<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(panicky)}
<D>__{what?...what?}
<A>__{beck locks eyes with doc.}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(to doc)}
<D>__{that it acquires intelligence from its victims?}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{intelligence may not be the right word...}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{fuck semantics, doc! you saying its like part dejesus, part sixpack, part bowman?!}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(tiredly)}
<D>__{i don't know. i'm guessing.}
<C>__{cobb}
<P>__{(losing it)}
<D>__{i say we should go get in the escape bubbles and get the hell out of here!}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{and hit the surface in the middle of a typhoon?...no, thank you. i will take my chance down here.}
<A>__{willie looks at beck.}
<C>__{willie}
<D>__{what can we do?}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{our only chance is to lure it to the swamp and flush it like we did the other.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{and how're we going to do that?}
<A>__{beck checks his flamethrower and looks at jones.}
