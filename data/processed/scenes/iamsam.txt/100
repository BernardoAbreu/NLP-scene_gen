<C>__{annie}
<D>__{he's learning.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{so what you're saying is that sam can not even multiply two times two?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i don't know about you, mr. turner, but my fondest memories of my parents have nothing to do with times tables or state capitals.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{i bet he's knocking on your door all the time with questions.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{yes. all the time. the last question was whether to use biz or clorox to get the grass stains out of lucy's soccer uniform.}
<B>__{on rita and sam}
<A>__{this is too good to be true.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{so let's see..he doesn't know math...he can't even wash her clothes. how about puberty? i can only imagine how much insight he'll bring to approaching the sensitive issues of a young girl's development.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{mr. turner, show me a father, any father, who knows how to do that and i will give them the parent of the year award.}

<C>__{rita}
<D>__{objection!}
<C>__{turner}

<D>__{i will allow it.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i had twenty eight years in the world to observe all kinds of fathers.}
<C>__{turner}
<D>__{what about your father, ms. cassell? since you appear to be an expert on father daughter relationships.}
<A>__{a long pause. sam watches as annie visibly tightens.}
<C>__{turner }
<D>__{excuse me, ms. cassell, i didn't hear your response. what about your father?}
<A>__{annie reaches for her water glass. we see her hand shake. it knocks over the glass, shattering it on the floor.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{objection! no further questions!}
<C>__{turner}

<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i said that's enough! i will not allow it! overruled! overruled!!}
<A>__{rita doesn't stop him. the judge hesitates, incredulous, then pounds the gavel as the courtroom erupts.}
