<L>__{exterior back alley night (present)}
<A>__{dumpsters overflow with the day's garbage. a pillar of steam rises from an underground grate. it's the dark place between buildings that a reasonable person avoids. we see jake vig, a guy in his late 20's whose fashionable suit and good looks are in obvious contrast to the surroundings at first glance, you'd think he could run for congress some day. at first glance. jake faces a garbage dumpster on his knees, execution style. his face gives away nothing he could be kneeling in a strawberry field.}

<D>__{and i think it's because of this redhead...}
<C>__{butch }
<D>__{know who i am, jake?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{the anti christ?}
<C>__{butch }
<D>__{no. i'm not the anti christ. or the prince of darkness. i'm just a guy looking for some answers.}
<A>__{there's the loud unmistakable "click" of a gun being cocked. the barrel of a gun slides gently along jake's ear and comes to rest at the base of his skull. the voice and the gun belong to butch (40's). with his suit and conservative looks, you'd make him out for a "steve" or "roger" more than a "butch".}
<C>__{butch }
<D>__{things are probably going to end badly for you, jake.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{gee... what makes you say that?}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{your life flashing before your eyes?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{just the last three weeks.}
<C>__{butch}
<D>__{that's not a bad place to start.}
