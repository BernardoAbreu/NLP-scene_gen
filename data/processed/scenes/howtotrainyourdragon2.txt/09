<L>__{interior viking hall night}
<C>__{flashback}
<A>__{a hulking, cloaked figure strides confidently into fire lit hall, interrupting a council meeting of viking chieftains. his face is masked in silhouette.}
<C>__{stoick }
<D>__{into our midst came a stranger from a strange land, covered in scars and draped in a cloak of dragon skin. he carried no weapon and spoke softly, saying that he, drago bludvist, was a man of the people, devoted to freeing mankind from the tyranny of dragons.}
<A>__{on stoick, some twenty years younger, seated in a throne, studying the impudent stranger with suspicion.}
<C>__{stoick }
<D>__{he claimed that he alone could control the dragons and that he alone could keep us safe, if we chose to bow down and follow him.}
<A>__{the viking council erupts in mocking laughter.}
<B>__{back to present}
<A>__{snotlout, fishlegs, and the twins snicker.}
<C>__{ruffnut}
<D>__{stupid.}
<C>__{tuffnut}
<D>__{good one.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{aye. we laughed, too...}
<B>__{back to flashback}
<C>__{stoick }
<D>__{until he wrapped himself in his cloak and cried out, "then see how well you do without me!"}
<A>__{drago bludvist pulls the dragon skin cloak over himself and marches toward the door. above, dragon fire rips through the ceiling, bringing down flaming timbers, followed by dragons covered in heavy metallic armor. they blast fire as panic ensues.}
<C>__{stoick }
<D>__{the rooftop suddenly burst into flames, and from it, armored dragons descended, burning the hall to the ground.}
<B>__{back to present}
<C>__{stoick}
<P>__{(stinging regret)}
<D>__{i... was to only one to escape.}
<A>__{the twins, snotlout, and fishlegs exchange spooked glances.}
<C>__{stoick }
<P>__{(to hiccup)}
<D>__{men who kill without reason cannot be reasoned with.}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{maybe.}
<A>__{hiccup turns and stomps toward toothless, determined. eret watches intently.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{hiccup...}
<C>__{hiccup}
<D>__{i'm still going to try.}
<A>__{hiccup jumps onto toothless and locks eyes with stoick.}
<C>__{hiccup }
<D>__{this is what i'm good at. and if i could change your mind... i can change his, too.}
<P>__{(to toothless)}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{toothless and hiccup take to the air, leaving everyone stirring in awkward silence. astrid mounts stormfly, about to go after him.}
<C>__{astrid}
<D>__{let's go.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{no! lead the others back to berk. i've had enough mutiny for one day.}
<A>__{astrid stirs, conflicted, as stoick stomps toward skullcrusher, fuming. he passes ruffnut, who's busily fondling eret's biceps as he lays crushed under grump.}
<C>__{ruffnut}
<D>__{ooh, i like that.}
<C>__{stoick}
<D>__{ruffnut!}
<C>__{ruffnut}
<P>__{(petulant)}
<D>__{ugh! okay!}
