<L>__{exterior hillside night}
<A>__{sam is spotted with weeds and dirt as he continues his way down the steep hillside holding up his pants. after he's sure he's safe, he sits down and rests his head in his hands. he starts to shake, frightened by his actions. he drops onto his back, buttons and zips his pants as he starts to cry. slowly, he stops crying, but keeps staring up at the sky, which is loaded with stars and a full moon. mesmerized by the brilliant night, sam can't stop staring.}
