<L>__{interior space station. mmcr. day}
<A>__{in a quiet corner, woody and beck are alone.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{i've no longer got the right crew.}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(surprised)}
<D>__{what do you mean? bjornstrom can be up here on the next shuttle.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{bjornstrom is a geologist. he's good, but not for this. my people just lost eight months of training. this is a different mission, with a different objective.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{i haven't been given authorization for a mission yet.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{but when you are, it ought to be given the best chance for success. i want mcconnell to fly right seat.}
<A>__{beck's expression hardens.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{he's no longer on mission status.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{yeah. because you washed him out.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{he washed himself out. he only had to pass a few more psych evaluations, but he refused to take them.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{ray, he's the best pilot i ever saw, and you've got him benched at a desk.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{everybody has to pass the psych prelims. no exceptions. jim knew that.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{maggie was his wife. he didn't want to lie on a couch and share her with strangers.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{that was his call. but i had to make one too. it was tough as hell, but i'd do it again.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{his wife wasted away in front of his eyes. what was he supposed to do? suck it up? get with the program? what was his crime? that he was upset? that he cried...?}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{i couldn't trust him!}
<A>__{beck and woody stare at each other. a long tense beat.}
<C>__{beck}
<P>__{(his voice softer)}
<D>__{not in a crisis... i'm sorry woody, but jim lost his edge. are you gonna stand there and tell me jim mcconnell is the same man he was two years ago? you want me to bet four more lives on that?}
<A>__{this stops woody, just for a beat. then makes him press on harder, with even greater intensity.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{when maggie died, yeah, it knocked the shit out of him. it knocked the hell out of all of us. but you know and i know that he's still the best we've got. he and maggie wrote the book on mars. he's got more hours in the sims than the rest of us put together. ray, we can do this. give me mcconnell as co pilot, and we will bring luke home. and that's a promise.}
<A>__{beck looks back at him, his features taunt.}
