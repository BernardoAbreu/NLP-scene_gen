<L>__{interior orphanage courtyard night}
<A>__{a bucket of water slaps raizo awake. he's bound to a pole in the middle of the courtyard by thick rope that bites into his flesh. ozunu stands before him, as well as the rest of the clan, down to the youngest of them. watching silently. he looks the same as he has in the flashbacks except that now an ugly scar runs diagonally across the length of his face. trace of raizo's blade from atop the building in dubai. when he speaks, ozunu is speaking for the benefit of the rest of the clan as to raizo.}
<C>__{ozunu}
<D>__{you are ozunu. your life is meaningless compared to the survival of the clan. this is our deepest truth. because of it, we have endured for hundreds of years, and will endure for hundreds more.}
<A>__{he looks to the rest, pounding the message home. the message that says hope and escape are futile.}
<C>__{ozunu }
<D>__{weakness compels strength. betrayal begets blood. this is the way of the nine clans.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{this is the way of the ninja.}
<A>__{he looks back at raizo, approaching slowly. taking his time.}
<C>__{ozunu }
<D>__{i have waited many years for this moment. i have dreamed it, many times.}
<A>__{he hits raizo. hard.}
<C>__{ozunu }
<D>__{you will suffer for seven days, one day for each year you defied me.}
<A>__{he takes a knife, and very carefully cuts out a very small piece of raizo's flesh, from the upper arm. raizo doesn't cry out.}
<C>__{ozunu }
<D>__{for seven days, we will...take...from you, as i have just done. everyone here will take from you. piece by piece. you will live through it all, you will feel through it all. you will watch as the birds fight over the pieces.}
<A>__{he strikes raizo as he did long ago, his hand jutting deep inside gut, flicking switches of nerves that cause instant agony. this time raizo does cry out.}
<C>__{ozunu }
<D>__{you will know pain like no other human being has ever known.}
<A>__{he twists something in raizo's belly and violent spasms wrack the young man's body. blood burbles up through his mouth and flows down his chin.}
<C>__{ozunu }
<D>__{your death will be remembered for a thousand years as a testament to the will and strength of the ozunu clan.}
<A>__{one last gouge in raizo's stomach sends a heaving shudder through him. confident, victorious, ozunu turns and walks a few steps away as raizo coughs up a bloody wad onto the clean floor. takeshi smiles at this, then looks more closely, seeing something amidst the bile...}
<C>__{takeshi}
<D>__{father...}
<A>__{ozunu looks down and sees a tiny steel cylinder. a single led light blinking through the gore. he nudges it with his foot...and time slows down as he realizes what he's looking at. he slowly raises his eyes and meets raizo's gaze as suddenly explosions rock the orphanage's centuries old gate. a reinforced military humvee crashes through the cloud of splintering timber with a roar and an explosion of blinding lights. the ozunu clan scatters as the massive vehicle heaves into the courtyard, revealing behind it still more vehicles, all equipped with brilliant lights. the ninjas take to the shadows, trying to melt away, but the shadows are gone. there's no place for the ninjas to hide anymore. we find mika and maslow in one of the lead vehicles as takeshi draws his blade in a smooth arc, raising it over raizo's helpless form. maslow takes aim with his submachine gun and squeezes off a long burst. takeshi blocks some of the slugs with his sword and dodges the others. he slides into one of the few remaining shadows. one of the soldiers sees him making a break for it and fires an incendiary grenade. the explosion sends incandescent white phosphorous splashing through the courtyard, but takeshi is gone. they prepare to fire another one when maslow comes on the run.}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{no more grenades, not until we get the children out!}
<A>__{but some parts of the orphanage are already on fire, the flames spreading through the ancient timbers. the carnage continues. maslow fires at the fleeing ninjas as mika rushes for raizo, pistol in hand. one of the mp's screams as a shuriken rips open his face as other mps fire back at the ninja, tearing him apart with gunfire. mika makes it to raizo's side. he smiles at her as she saws through the rope with her knife.}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{what took you?}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{you knew i'd come?}
<C>__{raizo}
<D>__{just because i was asleep doesn't mean i couldn't hear you.}
<A>__{mika finishes with the rope. raizo pulls free and reaches for a fallen ninja's sword and chain.}
<C>__{raizo }
<D>__{and i forgive you.}
<A>__{mika looks back at the sound of gunfire tearing apart another ninja. when she looks back raizo is gone.}
