<B>__{celebration}
<A>__{the inhabitants of swanscombe have decked out the town square and are making a night of it. by torchlight they dance merrily to jigs and reels provided by the local fiddlers. ale flows freely from oak casks. valerian's house valerian is kneeling before a trunk full of women's clothing. she pulls out a long simple frock, goes to a crude mirror, and holds it up against her body to gauge the effect. her father comes up behind her. he is angry and frightened.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{put that away. what if you were seen?}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{i'm going to be seen. i want to be seen. tonight the world finds out that you never had a son.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{no, you mustn't do that. it's too soon. we've got to think about this, we've got to make a plan.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{father: the danger is over.}
<A>__{he sits on the bed and puts his head in his hands.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{i know. what am i going to say to my friends who still mourn for their lost girls.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{you'll say you did what you had to. this is a time for celebration and forgiveness.}
<A>__{he looks up at her, trying to imagine what it's going to be like having a daughter.}
<B>__{celebration}
<A>__{galen is surrounded by a crowd of wide eyed kids and not a few adults, entertaining them by pulling duck's eggs out of their ears and causing coins to disappear. presently he feels the attention of his audience shift away to someone standing behind him. he turns to find a shy but determined valerian sweetly decked out in her blue frock. a buzz goes through the crowd. valerian blushes and wavers: she seems ready to bolt for home. but galen takes her by the hand, and with conspicuous politesse leads her to the dance.}
<B>__{dance}
<A>__{it's forward, back and around sixth century style: the young sorcerer can't take his eyes off his partner. but she's too shy to return his gaze.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{looks like you've been up to a little sorcery yourself.}
<A>__{valerian doesn't know what to say.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{or is it witchcraft?}
<A>__{she still doesn't reply. it's all she can do to keep on dancing.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{what's the matter? a real woman never stops talking.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{i think it was much easier being a boy.}
<A>__{simon & greil they stand on the sidelines, watching the young couple step to the music.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{the damnedest thing is, she was twice the man of anyone else in the village. now she's twice the woman.}
<C>__{greil}
<P>__{(grim)}
<D>__{would that i had been as clever as her father.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{come now, greil. don't begrudge a life spared.}
<C>__{greil}
<D>__{i begrudge nothing. but i wonder at what we have seen and how it was done.}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{you were there.}
<C>__{greil}
<D>__{i saw what i saw. but this jack anapes was barely ready to carry his master's chamberpot. isn't it strange that at the very moment the beast is put down we should have a holy man here in the village?}
<C>__{simon}
<D>__{you don't believe that superstitious christian rot, do you?}
<C>__{greil}
<P>__{(defensive)}
<D>__{it is said god works his wonders in mysterious ways.}
<B>__{celebration}
<A>__{while the proud simon dances in the background with his daughter, a group of tipsy villagers clusters around galen, belching forth a drinking song. the young magician raises his own mug and joins in on the chorus. abruptly the music stops. the singing dies away. the ensuing silence is broken by the sound of galloping hooves. presently three horsemen appear at the end of town: tyrian and his henchmen. they guide their horses forward into the midst of the merry makers. tyrian dismounts and looks around in his usual friendly way.}
<C>__{tyrian}
<D>__{a celebration! don't stop on my account. you musicians, more music!}
<A>__{the musicians leave their instruments in their laps. tyrian draws himself a measure of ale and raises it above his head.}
<C>__{tyrian}
<D>__{a toast! to the deed of the day! you see, good news travels fast. the king himself has already heard it. and like yourselves, tonight he's overcome with joy.}
<C>__{malkin}
<D>__{what would you have of us then?}
<C>__{tyrian}
<D>__{not a thing. it's this one.}
<P>__{(he gestures toward galen)}
<D>__{the king would meet our new benefactor and offer his gratitude to the man who succeeded where so many have failed.}
<C>__{galen}
<P>__{(sobering up)}
<D>__{what sort of gratitude? a knife in the belly? an arrow in the back?}
<A>__{tyrian's smile freezes on his face. he steps in front of galen, towering over him.}
<C>__{tyrian}
<D>__{my young friend, i'd as soon dispatch you as i did the others, and for the same reason. but his majesty would like a cozy chat, and commands otherwise.}
<C>__{valerian}
<D>__{don't go, galen. cast a spell and turn them into toads. it should be easy; that's what they are.}
<A>__{tyrian regards her coolly, taking in her change of costume and its meaning.}
<C>__{tyrian}
<D>__{well, well: still plenty of cheek under those skirts, it seems.}
<A>__{having buried the dragon under a mountain, galen decides he's not worried about an appearance at court. he smiles at valerian.}
<C>__{galen}
<D>__{don't worry. i will be back.}
