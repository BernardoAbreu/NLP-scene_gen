<L>__{interior corridor sub bay}
<A>__{hippy freezes in the corridor as he hears a loud ratcheting sound echoing from the sub bay. he edges forward slowly, trying to keep his feet silent on the steel floor. slides up along the wall next to the door. inches his eye around the doorframe. across the room. schoenick is working with a chainfall, lowering big geek onto the mirv warhead, which is still on its cart. he begins to attach them together with a sling of tie down straps. hippy lets his breath out slowly. his expression is holy shit. he slides back along the corridor wall, silently. away from the door. then turn turns quickly to go... wham! coffey slams him up against the wall! .45 pressed to hippy's temple. hippy gulping air as coffey ears back the hammer.}
