<A>__{hunter, and picks him up.}
<B>__{hunter screams.}
<A>__{standard whirls around, sees the thing clutching hunter. it holds him off to one side, as though to keep standard from getting at him. standard doesn't know what to do.}

<D>__{the flamethrower!}
<C>__{standard}
<D>__{i can't, the acid will pour out!}
<A>__{at that moment the creature takes a bite out of hunter, who screams in}

<A>__{standard can take it no longer; he raises the flamethrower and fires but the creature swings hunter around as a shield and hunter}
