<D>__{you're not up for anything conventional, or popularly assumed to be female priorities. including marriage. or romance. or even...}

<C>__{julianne }
<D>__{... not even love.}
<A>__{the look holds. the seamstress keeps working, as if she's deaf.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{that's why michael and i were the wrong fit. right from the start.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{he said that, too.}
<A>__{she stands up. walks to the platform. smooths her hand over the fabric down julianne's back, along her hips. communicating to the seamstress with her irritated expression.}

<D>__{i need a smoke.}
<A>__{and before anyone can breathe, she steps off the platform ripping the living shit out of the gown, right down the side. the seam stress' eyes flash open in abject horror. julianne, a deer in headlights, looks quickly around at the evidence of her screw up in six different mirrors. kimberly just steps to her, fingers the tear...}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{it's mostly the seam. let's get this to carlos.}
<A>__{and unzips julianne down the back. in her rush to step out, julianne stumbles, but her arms are pinned by the pulled down dress and she just... ... topples like a felled oak, thudding on her face, the gown ripping some more, the seamstress screaming like an idiot. then. silence. julianne looking up helplessly, a trussed hog, bound in her dress.}
<C>__{kimmy }
<D>__{just. don't. move.}
<A>__{like you talk to a three year old. deftly, kimmy pulls the dress free, leaving julianne in her underwear. signals to the seamstress, let's go.}

<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i mean, we were skinny dipping in greece, just as pals, less than two years ago.}
<A>__{she grabs the clothes and covers the front of herself. looking at him with a mix of emotions she couldn't begin to sort out.}

<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{it's over.}
<A>__{and crouches down. close beside her. the cigarette drops from her hand, unnoticed on the carpet. so he lifts it, crushes it on the heel of his shoe.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i want you to quit this shit, it'll kill you.}
<A>__{she just nods, obediently. okay, i will.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{she denied it. said i was crazy and paranoid.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{a bad combination.}
<A>__{he tries to smile. it's really hard.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{there's this big brunch tomorrow morning? at her place.}
<A>__{he lets the air out. slow. so he won't cry.}

<C>__{michael}
<D>__{and she's right, i'm crazy to fall for someone. i hardly knew.}
<A>__{looks deep in her eyes. he's so glad she's there.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{hey. you still got that ring?}
<A>__{she holds up her left hand, the flapping sleeve falls away. the ring is on a finger that is swollen and raw.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i tried it on. but it won't come off.}
<A>__{he smiles at that. a sad smile of friendship. then takes her finger gently... ... into his mouth. it is something like a kiss. and when he removes her moistened finger... ... he pulls the ring off. nothing to it. she blinks.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{it's mental, you know.}
<A>__{he doesn't understand that.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{should we take a walk? or maybe some food sent up, or something...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i just want to be alone. is that okay?}
<A>__{she nods, sure. he kisses her cheek. stands up.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{maybe i will go back to new york. hang with you for awhile, huh? ben'll understand.}

<L>__{interior organ loft day}
<A>__{pan along a gigantic serpentine stack of wedding presents. nearly twelve feet high, the pile curves along the balcony, high above the diners in the great room, extending al the way to... ... an organ loft. alone, above the noise of the party, julianne and kimmy have just reached the top of the staircase. trapped between ten tons of lavish gifts and the keyboard of the mammoth organ. dwarfed by their surroundings, kimmy draws the hardest breath of her life...}
<C>__{kimmy}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{so. what did he say?}
<A>__{julianne's eyes move over the young girl's face.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{he said. marry me.}
<A>__{kimmy yelps in her ecstasy, flinging herself against julianne, and they go down full length across the organ's pedals, blasting the room with a monster chord of china rattling volume and horrifying disharmony. as grown men and women scream in spontaneous terror below, kimmy begins to... ... laugh. and kiss and hug her new sister. and holds her tight.}
<L>__{exterior willow pond day}
<A>__{julianne and michael walk the gravel path beside a breathtaking pond, ringed with willows that dig heavy branches to the water's surface. he is relieved, reflective. head down, he never notices that she is... ... dangerously freaked. too petrified even to hyperventilate, we're lucky she's breathing at all. we watch her life unraveling before her glassy eyes.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(never looks up)}
<D>__{thank god you were here.}
<C>__{julianne}
<P>__{(mumbles to herself)}
<D>__{oh, yeah.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i was so confused, so conflicted, so... unstable.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{well, it happens.}
<A>__{they pass an expanse of lawn which has become the event parking area. family vehicles, delivery trucks, service vans. everything that couldn't fit on the circular front driveway.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i might have thrown away...}
<A>__{searching for the right words.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{... your one chance for true happiness?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{... yeah, that.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{you never want to do that, see, that's always a... costly turnover. as they say in the sport biz.}
<A>__{there's a vague stepford wife quality to her voice. he hears that now, and looks at her. maybe he can't tell she's frightened. but he can tell she's something.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{are you okay?}
<A>__{she stops walking. she can't look at him, so she looks around. across the lawn crews are moving equipment into the brightly colored tents, unfolding and setting up stacks of tables and chairs, raising the poles between which all those balloons will be strung. at the center of it all... .... a huge topiary white sox batter, just completing a murderous swing. he's maybe fifteen feet tall. she points to it...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{the big hurt, huh?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{nellie fox. walter likes the past. and he likes the little guys.}
<A>__{so julianne nods. because she does too. squints up at michael.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{got a minute?}
<A>__{he nods, you bet. worried for her. what is this? she looks in another direction, and we now see that we have nearly reached... ... a stage that's been set up for the band. chairs, music stands, sound equipment. a gleaming dance floor, already in place over the lawn. next to it, a shimmering white gazebo. like the centerpiece of a wedding cake.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{why is the dance floor by the gazebo?}
<A>__{she takes his hand. they walk toward it.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{kimmy's idea. she thought it would be such a romantic place. for our wedding dance.}
<A>__{looking down at her.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{what's up?}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{shhh.}
<A>__{up the white steps now. together. the gazebo floor has been covered with hardwood. the perfect place. for a wedding dance. and julianne... ... turns, suddenly. he almost runs into her. she is staring up at him, so strangely, their bodies only inches apart. he is caught, transfixed by the intensity in her eyes.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i have to say this quick, okay, or i will have this massive coronary and you'll never have to hear it. which you need to. does that make any sense at all?}
<A>__{the coronary part does. we can feel her heart beating from here.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{jules, what's wrong...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{this is the dumbest thing i will ever do. so dumb, in fact, that i can't. i don't think.}
<A>__{and then, she does. she puts her hands flat on his chest. looks in his eyes.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{michael, i love you.}
<A>__{a heartbeat passes.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i've loved you for nine years, but i was too arrogant and scared to realize it. now i'm just scared.}
<A>__{he stares at her, dumbstruck. she moves even closer.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i know this comes at an inopportune time, but i have to ask this one really gigantic favor, okay?}
<A>__{holds her breath. and...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{choose me. marry me. let me make you happy.}
<A>__{and in a half beat of excruciating silence...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i know. it sounds like three favors.}
<A>__{his eyes are loving. they care for her. she swallows, lost in them.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{but when you think about it...}
<A>__{slides her arms around his neck, and raises her mouth... ... to his. the most beautiful kiss she will ever offer. all of her heart is in this, and as his hands touch her body... ... a scream rips the world to pieces. they whirl to see... ... kimmy, halfway up the path. her hands across her mouth, as if to stem the horror that pours forth as she shrieks from her soul, and... ... runs. back down the path. michael bolting after her, shouting her name. a frozen moment, and... ... julianne takes off after him. all three running, screaming their various emotions at the top of their lungs, as workmen stop to watch from neighboring countries. kimmy, staring from halfway there, has an insurmountable lead. leaps into her convertible and peels out, just tearing up the gravel as she rockets out of sight. no way to catch her. still... ... michael is racing for the cars. julianne, sprinting her guts out, losing ground with every stride. michael jumps into a cherokee...}

<A>__{with julianne now, racing through the lot, michael vanishes into the station, she plunges in after him, bouncing off bystanders, apologizing, lunging on, gasping for breath, past exhaustion, threatening clumsily through the crowd like a staggering drunk, catching a lucky glimpse as he heads... ... down a staircase to the tracks. my god, what's he doing? a second wind, fueled by panic, and she bolts after him, dancing down the steep staircase somehow without killing herself, reaching the concourse to see him, running for... ... track 29, a train already rumbling, ready to pull out, she sprints after him.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{michael!!}

<D>__{nnnoooo!!!}
<A>__{but he's just standing there. his back to us. watching it go. her body nearly collapses with relief. she pushes herself on, but her legs aren't working right in their maxed out fatigue, and she lopes and staggers until she comes up behind him. he's still lost in thought, staring after the train. she tries to speak, but there's no breath. so she puts her hands on her knees and just gasps for air like a dog. wheezing, panting, trying once more to speak, but she can't yet, and then he casually turns and... ... jumps out of his skin! a heart attack seeing her.}

<C>__{michael}
<D>__{well, that part i knew.}
<A>__{she's never loved him more.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{so you have to marry kim. because she will actually make you happy. i, in contrast, am a shallow, neurotic psychopath, with relatively little to offer.}
<A>__{okay?}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{kim. nod your head. do as you're told.}
<A>__{he nods his head, still smiling. her tears are running now. maybe she doesn't notice.}

<D>__{just promise you'll never tell me who you would have chosen. if i hadn't confessed.}
<A>__{she chokes back a sob.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{cos if you would have chosen me. then i threw away a perfectly good life. just to be a decent person. which is a questionable trade off. right?}
<A>__{he nods, slowly. because he's supposed to.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{and if you would have chosen some 20 year old punk over me. i'd have to kill myself.}
<A>__{ah. his smile keeps getting smaller. more loving. more wonderful.}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(whispers)}

<C>__{michael}
<D>__{... without a thought in my head. i shouted, "marry me."}
<A>__{i did. now her eyes tear up again. and she doesn't know why.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{and she gasped, and covered her mouth, and the train was pulling out, and suddenly she screamed yes! just once. and blew me a kiss.}

<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i never forgot that.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{it's two weeks.}
<C>__{michael}

<C>__{michael}
<D>__{i just wonder if you know why.}
<A>__{do you?}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{it's because romance isn't mystery, and tricks, and doubts, and halting, unspoken longings. that's not the real romance.}
<A>__{tears in his eyes now. first time.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{the real romance is saying yes.}
<A>__{does she know that now? he looks at his watch.}

<D>__{that's little egotistical.}

<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{but, undoubtedly accurate.}
<A>__{she claps her hands, galvanized by the emergency.}
<C>__{julianne}

<A>__{begins to slowly pan back up the length of an exquisite gown. we can tell from the organ, the nearby thrum of expectant voices, that we are nearing the moment. we reach... ... kimmy's hand. firmly clasping walter's. keep panning, the bodice, the lace, her throat, and finally, we are close on... ... the face of the bride. now we understand the word radiant. we also understand scared senseless. our perfect, unflappable kimmy is in a trance of emotional overload where bliss and panic seamlessly blend. the organ's noddling stops. kimmy's eyes alerted, like a small animal bearing a predator approach her thicket. suddenly, the chord. the wedding march from wagner's lohengrin. here. comes. the bride. and we snap to... full angle... kim and walter. this is it.}
<C>__{walter}
<P>__{(whispers)}
<D>__{left foot.}
<A>__{reverse angle... kim's pov, the chapel, every pew packed, every neck craning this way, the white satin carpet down the endless aisle to where... michael waits. also in a zone of pseudo consciousness. from which he attempts a smile. not comforting. kim's pov whip pan the groomsmen, the twins, locking focus on julianne, standing strong and beautiful, a glow of her own in the daffodil dress. she sends her little sister a wink across the trackless miles of aisle. you can do this, kid. so... ... kimmy does. on her father's arm, she walks the gauntlet of the world's intrusive admiration. one step at a time. the most beautiful she will ever be. she is dazzling the crowd and managing to not throw up at the same time. and she's there. at his side. she glances back to her maid of honor, just to make sure she's not working without a net. so julianne... ... crosses her eyes. which lets the kid smile and finally take a breath. have a little fun, huh? kim nods, got it, turns to... the minister. who stands before them with a calming presence. thank god someone has done this before. the crowd has hushed. the minister's eyes are only for two. his words are for all...}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{michael and kimmy wrote these words. she asked me to confide, mostly michael.}
<A>__{a ripple of laughter. gentle and fine. they are setting in.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{so he gets to say them.}
<A>__{a surprise. a pleasant one. the crowd adjust in its seats. as michael begins...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{why do people get married anymore?}
<A>__{and on these words. we snap to julianne. share her interest in the bluntness, the simplicity, the unorthodoxy of this beginning.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{why not live together amicably, with no sense of obligation beyond the moment?}
<A>__{her eyes. she's listening.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{as long as the sex is good. as long as no one more interesting has wandered into view. as long as the thousand conflicts of two individual wills remain comfortably compromised.}
<A>__{panning now. other faces. isabelle. proud to the bone.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{and when one feels the urge to move on, to explore the new. no guilt, no disgrace, no promise broken.}
<A>__{walter. his eyes damp. against our expectation.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{no agony of having dishonored a time. when our hearts. and the world were different.}
<A>__{joe nods, as he hears...}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{marriage is a lot to put up with.}
<A>__{julianne once more. no breath. rapt.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{the answer must be. that there is some need basic to the human heart. that<u< embracing... the obligation of commitment... fulfills.}
<A>__{her eyes have clouded. as if michael is talking to her.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{some need to belong to one another in a way which rages against the notion... that all is impermanent. against the notion of mortality.}
<A>__{and suddenly, all the feeling rises in her throat.}
<C>__{michael }
<D>__{our love is bigger. and longer. than life itself.}
<A>__{and the tears come. they come freely, unhidden, unnoticed. as if they were needed. michael now. looking at his bride.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{that's what we want. and marriage. is what we do about it.}
<A>__{kimmy smiles at him. with love bigger than life itself.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{we are fools in this. thank god almighty.}
<A>__{he is done. there is a silence.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{boy, that was good!}
<A>__{people laugh. the minister holds up a sheet of paper. for the crowd to see. mostly paragraphs crossed out in red ink.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{michael and kim also edited what they want me to say...}
<A>__{more laughter.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{the idea was, we're only marrying once. we have to remember it forever. let's keep to the good stuff.}
<P>__{(squints at the sheet)}
<D>__{you may kiss the bride.}
<A>__{bigger laughter. the minister waves this off, his little joke. turns to the best man, pantomimes the ring. as the hammered gold circle is handed to michael, julianne absently scratches her still swollen finger. mandy taps julianne on the arm, and produces... ... a matching ring. take it! gives it to her. so julianne steps forward. places the second ring into kimmy's waiting hand. their eyes meet, and hold throughout...}
<C>__{minister }
<D>__{if anyone here can show just cause why this man and woman should not be married, speak now. or forever hold your peace.}
<A>__{julianne clears her throat. kimmy's heart flutters. in the silence... julianne's wonderful smile. just kidding. michael reaches for kim's hand, turns her gently to him. places his ring on her finger. holds her hands.}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{kimberly. i promise to love. and respect and comfort you. to hear your voice and your heart. until we are parted by death.}
<A>__{she swallows. smiles a fleeting, beautiful smile. fumbles slightly, putting the ring on his finger.}
<C>__{kimmy}
<D>__{michael. i promise to love and respect and comfort you. to hear your voice and your heart. until we are parted by death.}
<A>__{staring in each other's eyes. a moment so fragile, the minister waits an extra beat.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{for the record, you each agree to marry the other?}
<C>__{kimmy}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{i do!}
<C>__{michael}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i do.}
<A>__{the minister joins their right hands.}
<C>__{minister}
<D>__{we haven't said much about god this evening, i know. but he is here. and he is happy. to bless his wonderful children.}
<A>__{close now on julianne. for the inevitable moment.}
<C>__{minister }
<D>__{in that michael and kimberly have given themselves to each other by solemn vows, and the exchanging of rings...}
<A>__{unnoticed by the world. her eyes are close.}
<C>__{minister }
<D>__{i pronounce them husband and wife. those whom god has joined together, let no one put asunder.}
<A>__{the eyes open. wet, brave, ready for...}
<C>__{minister }
<D>__{now. kiss the bride.}
<A>__{julianne watching. as michael does.}
<L>__{exterior wallace pond night}
<A>__{this is what all the preparation was for. tables, lights, balloons, the guests dancing on the hardwood floor, at the base of the gazebo. the bride and groom among them, relaxed and happy. two who are one.}
<B>__{pan to...}
<A>__{... the stage, the band playing. julianne conferring with the twins and the band leader, clear that she's giving the instructions. then, she takes her glass of champagne to the microphone... ... klunks it, for silence. the band stops. the dancers follow. all eyes are comfortably turned to the maid of honor. she looks to the couple. just below her. then, to the crowd...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i'm a writer, too, not as good as michael. but i do steal from quality.}
<A>__{she raises her glass. everyone at the table does the same.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{this is to my best friend. on the occasion of his wedding.}
<A>__{shouts of support, a few whistles. silence. she tells michael...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{if i have truly come to know your bride as my new sister. this is in her heart...}
<A>__{she has to stop. swallows. because she will not let herself cry.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{"understand. i will slip quietly away from the noisy crowd when i see the pale stars rising, blooming, over the oaks."}
<A>__{deep breath. looks in his eyes.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{"i will pursue solitary pathways through the pale twilit meadows, with only this one dream: you come too."}
<A>__{a hush. sharp applause. from four hundred hands. but not from his. he is too moved. too understanding of what he has heard.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i don't have a wedding gift. but this is on loan. until you two find your song...}
<A>__{and with that the band begins. the opening phrases of a song we have come to know. michael seems overwhelmed. julianne nods toward the gazebo... ... michael takes his bride's hand, leads her up the stairs, into his arms, as the twins step to the microphone, and guests begin to applaud an unscheduled wedding dance...}
<D>__{mandy sammy}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{someday, when i'm awfully low, and the world is cold, i will feel a glow just thinking of you, and the way you look tonight.}
<A>__{soft two part harmony. as perfect as the words.}
<D>__{mandy sammy}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{you're lovely. with your smile so warm, and your cheeks so soft, there is nothing for me but to love you, just the way you look tonight.}
<A>__{julianne can cry now. because she's tied with half the place.}
<D>__{mandy sammy}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{with each word, your tenderness grows, tearing my fears apart... and the laugh that wrinkles your nose, touches my foolish heart.}
<A>__{julianne begins to sing. unheard. unseen. even by the man she's singing to...}
<D>__{julianne mandy sammy}
<P>__{(singing)}
<D>__{you're lovely, please don't ever change, keep that breathless charm, darling, please arrange it, cos i love you... just the way you look tonight.}
<A>__{the band keeps playing. the dance goes on. two people lost in each other. the way it's supposed to be.}
<L>__{interior great room late night}
<A>__{bedlam. julianne caught in the middle of the throng. a young couple, dressed for travel, appear at the top of the staircase. the shout are deafening. the bride has her bouquet... ... she spots julianne far below. throws it her way, julianne reflexively goes for it... ... not a fucking chance. the twins nearly trample her in the stampede, mandy wresting the prize from sammy's grasp. everyone cheers, and then the couple is... ... flying down the stairs, racing through the crowd with a protective phalanx of groomsmen bodyguards, heading for the door, for freedom... ... julianne, trapped in the crush, loses sight of the couple, struggles against the flow, suddenly panicked by the certainty that she will never see him before... and then, he's there. he has julianne in his arms. holding her so tight. an embrace so wonderful, so terrible, she could go mad from the confusion alone. against the din, he murmurs in her ear...}
<C>__{michael}
<D>__{wherever i go. however far...}
<A>__{she sobs. holds him. deep, deep breath.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{you win a few, you lose a few. some get rained out.}
<A>__{and to her surprise...}
<C>__{digger}
<P>__{(v.o., very softly)}
<D>__{you have a good time?}
<A>__{to her greater surprise. there are a few tears left, after all.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i did what i came to do.}
<C>__{digger}
<P>__{(v.o., even softer)}
<D>__{good girl.}
<A>__{she just can't speak now. so she doesn't.}
<C>__{digger }
<D>__{i was thinking. maybe you might visit us for awhile. we've got the room made up.}
<A>__{this fucking guy. god, she loves him.}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{i will think about it. i'm okay.}
<C>__{digger }
<D>__{oh, you're more than okay.}
<A>__{just above a whisper...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{you, too.}
<A>__{and with the last of her strength...}
<C>__{julianne}
<D>__{if the sun comes up, i will see you tomorrow, huh?}
<A>__{a chuckle. at the other end.}
<C>__{digger }
<D>__{i will play those odds. you have sweet dreams.}
<A>__{we hear the click. she turns her back on the stars. shoulders straight. chin up. she walks from frame.}
