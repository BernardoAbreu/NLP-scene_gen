<L>__{exterior softball field day}
<A>__{and kaffee's at it again.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{alright, let's get tough out there!}
<A>__{jo walks up from behind the backstop.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{excuse me.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{you want to suit up? we need all the help we can get.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{no, thank you, i can't throw and catch things.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{that's okay, neither can they.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{i wanted to talk to you about corporal dawson and private downey.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{say again?}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{dawson and downey.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{those names sound like they should mean something to me, but i'm just not }
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{dawson! downey! your clients!}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{the cuba thing! yes! dawson and downey.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{right.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i've done something wrong again, haven't i?}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{i was wondering why two guys have been in a jail cell since this morning while their lawyer is outside hitting a ball.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{we need the practice.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{that wasn't funny.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{it was a little funny.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{lieutenant, would you feel very insulted if i recommended to your supervisor that he assign different counsel?}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{i don't think you're fit to handle this defense.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{you don't even know me. ordinarily it takes someone hours to discover i'm not fit to handle a defense.}
<A>__{jo just stares.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{oh come on, that was damn funny.}
<A>__{jo moves close to kaffee to say this with a degree of confidentiality.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{i do know you. daniel allistair kaffee, born june 8th, 1964 at boston mercy hospital. your father's lionel kaffee, former navy judge advocate and attorney general, of the united states, died 1985. you went to harvard law on a navy scholarship, probably because that's what your father wanted you to do, and now you're just treading water for the three years you've gotta serve in the jag corps, just kinda layin' low til you can get out and get a real job. and if that's the situation, that's fine, i won't tell anyone. but my feeling is that if this case is handled in the same fast food, slick ass, persian bazaar manner with which you seem to handle everything else, something's gonna get missed. and i wouldn't be doing my job if i allowed dawson and downey to spend any more time in prison than absolutely necessary, because their attorney had pre determined the path of least resistance.}
<A>__{kaffee can't help but be impressed by that speech.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{wow.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i'm sexually aroused, commander.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{i don't think your clients murdered anybody.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{what are you basing this on?}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{there was no intent.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{the doctor's report says that santiago died of asphyxiation brought on by acute lactic acidosis, and that the nature of the acidosis strongly suggests poisoning.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now, i don't know what any of that means, but it sounds pretty bad.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{santiago died at one a.m. at three the doctor was unable to determine the cause of death, but two hours later he said it was poison.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{oh, now i see what you're saying. it had to be professor plum in the library with the candlestick.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{i'm gonna speak to your supervisor.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{okay. you go straight up pennsylvania avenue. it's a big white house with pillars in front.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{kaffee}
<D>__{i don't think you'll have much luck, though. i was assigned by division, remember? somebody over there thinks i'm a good lawyer. so while i appreciate your interest and admire your enthusiasm, i think i can pretty much handle things myself.}
<C>__{jo}
<D>__{do you know what a code red is?}
<A>__{kaffee doesn't, but he doesn't say anything.}
<C>__{jo}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{what a pity.}
