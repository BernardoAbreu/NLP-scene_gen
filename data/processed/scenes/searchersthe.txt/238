<A>__{martin is hauling an improvised travois over the ground in which, lashed by vines and some clothing, is the unconscious figure of ethan. close shot moving martin day eyes shadowed, whiskered, drawn he is an implacable figure as he drags the weary miles home. he hears a groan from ethan o.s. he barely lets his eyes drift to the sound. he doesn't stop. close shot moving ethan in the travois day we see he is delirious, lips parched, strapped to the poles. the travois jolts over the ground. as he passes out of frame, the camera holds on the marks of the travois poles scraping across the desert.}
