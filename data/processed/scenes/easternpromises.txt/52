<D>__{nikolai pulls up in his car. he checks his look in the rear view mirror and puts on his sunglasses. as he gets out of the car he notices that anna's motorbike is still there. he approaches it, strokes the bodywork. suddenly, someone grabs him from behind. it's kirill.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{hey, come on, nikolai, i've got a christmas present for you.}
<L>__{exterior trans siberian restaurant. back delivery area day}
<D>__{a white van is parked with its rear doors open, ready for unloading. kirill shows nikolai that the van is loaded with unmarked white boxes.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{open one. nikolai opens one of the boxes and produces a bottle of vintage champagne.}
<C>__{kirill }
<D>__{from france. old as fuck. old is good with wine. sixty quid a bottle anywhere. except i got them for ten quid a case.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{from where?}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{`from where?' from where you don't ask. give it here... kirill snatches the bottle and begins to uncork it.}
<C>__{kirill }
<D>__{if my dad says ok, i can start telling you about the serious stuff. import, export. this booze is just for gifts to papa's friends. the real import stuff is from kabul, you understand? he pops the cork and swigs the frothing champagne.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{import export sounds good. kirill laughs.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{you bet it's fucking good... nikolai hands the bottle back. as he does, one of the van doors is kicked closed revealing semyon, suddenly upon them.}
<C>__{kirill }
<D>__{jesus christ, papa... you scared me.... semyon grabs the bottle of champagne and smashes it on the floor. kirill recoils in terror. nikolai straightens, faces up.}
<C>__{kirill }
<D>__{what's wrong? we're just sampling it! semyon is so furious he still can't speak. he grabs kirill and slams him against the wall. finally he hisses in his face.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{your friend soyka is dead.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{yeah? so what? what's that got to do with me?}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{don't lie to me!! semyon slams kirill against the wall once more.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{i swear i don't know nothing about it...}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{i said, don't lie to me! semyon slams kirill hard against the wall again. suddenly nikolai steps forward.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{your dad is right, kirill. there's no point lying to him. a pause. semyon and kirill are frozen for a moment. nikolai calmly lights a cigarette.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{ozim's nephew slit soyka's throat. kirill paid him to do it. there is stunned silence. semyon loosens his grip on kirill.}
<C>__{kirill}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{shut your fucking mouth!}
<C>__{nikolai}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{your dad always knows the truth anyway. nikolai and semyon survey each other.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{but it's ok boss. you don't have to worry...}
<C>__{semyon}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{i don't have to worry?}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i disposed of the body myself. the police won't find a thing. semyon has now lost all interest in kirill and is concentrating on nikolai. he laughs with incredulity.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{my son commits a murder?}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{on my own doorstep? a fellow soldier! and no one thought to tell me about it?}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{the vory code says you don't talk to anybody about your captain. kirill is my captain. semyon circles nikolai.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{when i found out what had happened, i did what i had to do to clean the situation up. kirill is about to speak but before he can, nikolai speaks for him.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<D>__{it was a matter of honor. soyka was spreading lies about kirill. about your family.}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{kirill did the right thing. semyon hisses with fury and grabs nikolai.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{i decide what is right and what is wrong. you do not kill a vor for no reason. nikolai shrugs semyon off, holding his ground.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{you know as well as i do soyka was talking to the police. a pause. semyon is shocked at the depth of nikolai's knowledge. he peers at him.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{for a driver, you are well informed.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{i've got connections with the chechens who export cars. soyka was speaking to the russian desk. scotland yard. a pause.}
<C>__{nikolai }
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{kirill did a good thing for all our people. our people will know that. in semyon's silence kirill finally gathers courage...}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{papa, i swear to you, i was going to...}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{shut up! kirill is hurt that semyon seems only to be interested in nikolai. after studying nikolai for a while...}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{if you are so well informed, you will know soyka has brothers.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<P>__{(with a smile)}
<D>__{that's ok. kirill has got me. semyon shows the first flicker of admiration. he then looks at kirill with utter contempt, making the comparison with nikolai obvious.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{get these boxes out of sight. semyon leaves them. kirill is angry, straightening his clothes. finally he yells....}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{you heard him, patsan! get these boxes out of sight.}
