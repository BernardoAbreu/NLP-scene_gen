<L>__{interior school boys' room.}
<A>__{kate is entirely out of place in the boys' room, as the boys look on amusedly. she finds the disc behind the condom machine and pockets it. then she buys a condom from the machine and struts out, smiling sweetly, hot as fire.}
<L>__{interior dade's place.}
<A>__{kate knocks. mrs. murphy lets kate and cereal in.}
<C>__{mrs. murphy}

<C>__{dade}
<D>__{do my ears deceive me?}
<A>__{kate starts to leave.}
<C>__{cereal}
<D>__{nonononono. truce, you guys. listen, we got a higher purpose here, alright? a wake up call for the nintendo generation. we demand free access to data, well, it comes with some responsibility. when i was a child, i spake as a child, i understood as a child, i thought as a child, but when i became a man i put away childish things.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{what... it's corinthians i, chapter 13, verse 11, no duh. come on.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{phreak and joey are being framed. we need your help to figure out what's on this disc.}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{i can't. everybody who touches that thing gets busted, i can't afford to get arrested, i'm sorry.}
<C>__{cereal}
<D>__{maybe i should just go to the bathroom or something.}
<A>__{cereal leaves the room.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{what is it with you? i know we've been playing games, but, we're supposed to be on the same side and we really need your help. i really need your help.}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i can't.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{well, could you just make a copy of the disc? and just hide it in case we get busted, so we have something to give our lawyers, something that hasn't been tampered with? can you do that?}
<A>__{a knock on the door. dade's mom peeks in.}
<C>__{mrs. murphy}
<D>__{listen you guys, help yourself to anything in the fridge. cereal has.}
<A>__{she leaves.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(to mrs. murphy)}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{okay. i will copy it.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{okay, thank you.}
<A>__{later. plague phones dade. plague has lauren murphy's records on his screen.}
<C>__{plague}
<D>__{the girl. the girl has the disc i need.}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{i told you, i don't play well with others.}
<C>__{plague}
<D>__{turn on your laptop. set it to receive a file.}
<A>__{dade does. an extensive criminal record with a strange woman's picture comes up. the strange woman transforms into dade's mother.}
<C>__{plague}
<D>__{lauren murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of washington. forgery, embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. when she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. then i change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears.}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{that's bullshit.}
<C>__{plague}
<D>__{what can i tell you. computers never lie, kid. your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched.}
<C>__{dade}
<D>__{you lay a finger on her and i will kill you.}
<C>__{plague}
<D>__{kid, don't threaten me. there are worse things than death and, uh, i can do all of them!}
<A>__{dade emerges from his room. his exhausted, overworked mother is asleep on the couch. he pulls a blanket over her.}
