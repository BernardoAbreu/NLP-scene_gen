<A>__{they unload their stuff as they argue.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{nice conversationalist! yeah, i felt 'em a little, but i ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{it's natural. a reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it. it's part of how you are able to track them.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{oh, wonderful. my secret weapon is pms. that's just great. thanks for telling me.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{you'll get used to it. i'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{you are such a wet.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{a what?}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{a wet! didn't i just kill that vampire? i think i did. i didn't see you killing any vampires. you were too busy playing 'beat the clock'.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{don't start with me again.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{aren't i, like the chosen one? the one and only? the grand high poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me? like, ever?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{buffy...}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{and why are you always wearing black? it's so down. it's totally not your color. i don't think you have a color.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{what do you want? encouragement?}
<P>__{(in bad american accent)}
<D>__{'gosh, buffy, you're so special, i just want to give you a great big hug, oh i'm just having a warm fuzzy.'}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{oh, fuck you!}
<A>__{merrick turns on her.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{do you know how many girls i've trained to be slayers? five. five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight harder than you've ever worked in your life and i saw them ripped apart. do you want to live? do you?}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{i...}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{what did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a slayer?}
<A>__{buffy looks at him a bit.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{five?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{five.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{so, basically, i've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{not if you're careful.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{how can you keep doing this?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{it's what i was raised to do. there aren't many of us left, the watchers.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{watchers?}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{there's a small village in hampshire, near stonehenge...}
<P>__{(sees she doesn't know it)}
<D>__{... near a bunch of big rocks. that's where i was born. my father taught me about the training, about finding the slayers, reading the signs. there's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies. i thought so myself for a time, when i was younger...}
<P>__{(stops himself)}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i'm not supposed to... i shouldn't go on like this.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{i wish you would.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{it isn't important.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{i'm curious, is all.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend. it interferes with the work, and it...}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{and it makes it worse when i die, right?}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{buffy}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{well, you know, i'm not gonna kick so easy. i've got a few things the other girls didn't have.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{as for example, what?}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.}
<C>__{merrick}
<D>__{vampires of the world, beware.}
<C>__{buffy}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{merrick. you made a joke. are you okay, i mean, do you want to lie down? i know it hurts the first time.}
<A>__{in spite of himself, merrick smiles.}
