<L>__{exterior later that day aokee's surf & snack shack}
<A>__{three picnic tables are set up in front of aokee's. we dolly past each one to see that they are cluttered indentically with what appears to be the leftovers from lunch for four. behind each table is a team of two guards, concessions and grounds kids. a judge blows a whistle and we begin by looking at the lifeguard team. it is a boy and a girl and the girl is not too keen on this. they bring a trash can with them and begin gingerly clearing the table, acting as if they are afraid to get their hands dirty. we dolly left to see the concessions team a little ahead of the guard team. we dolly further left to reveal a grounds kid in a full rain suit with a face shield. a tremendous force of water is clearing the table into the trash can which the rain suited grounds kid is holding at it's end. we dolly further left to see eddie in full army fatigues with safety goggles on and wearing the biggest super soaker water gun in the history of man. the table is quickly cleared, and at the same time washed. eddie holds up the business end of the super soaker gun and blows imaginary smoke from it's barrel, like an old western gunfighter. the judges take notes.}
