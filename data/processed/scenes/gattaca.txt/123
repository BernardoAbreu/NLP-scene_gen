<A>__{jerome and irene climb a staircase to her bedroom. without another word they begin to make love. later that night, jerome cannot sleep. he rises quietly so as not to disturb irene. he silently opens the double windows of the upstairs bedroom. he carefully gathers his pillow from the bed and shakes it out of the window. slowly jerome turns to gaze at the wood floor. in the moonlight we see an extreme close up of a single hair lying on the floorboards. jerome bends and picks up the hair, trying to identify it in the dim light. on his hands and knees he tries to clean the floor with a towel. irene turns over in the bed. jerome freezes but she continues to sleep. he realizes he may be spreading even more of his skin and hair over the floor. overcome with frustration and the enormity of his task, he begins to quietly weep.}
