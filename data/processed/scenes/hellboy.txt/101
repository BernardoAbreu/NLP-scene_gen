<A>__{doctor marsh, a female psychiatrist, moves down a line patients, distributing pills. behind her, a lithe young woman in a patient's gown carries the medicine tray. this is liz sherman, age 26, her pale skin contrasting with her raven black hair and piercing dark eyes. a scar mars her forehead. three thick rubber bands circle her wrist. near a window, a down's syndrome patient senses something.}

<D>__{not santa. big and red. with gold eyes. and he has beer!}
<A>__{hearing this, liz stops. she closes her eyes, tugs at one of the rubber bands on her wrist and lets it snap against her skin. she winces and peers out the window. the garden below seems empty.}
