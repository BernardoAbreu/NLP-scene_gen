<L>__{exterior balcony ike'sapartment night}
<A>__{the balcony overlooks central park. the twinkling lights of the city stretch out across the beautiful night. ike looks out at the view with his back to maggie as she speaks.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i understand why you bring up the truck. let me explain something. the fact is, you've seen me at my worst, most embarrassing, deviously plotting, potentially but not certifiably, psychotic state. and if you liked me then, i mean, now... i can't imagine...}
<P>__{(crosses to him)}
<A>__{benedict. ike has no response.}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{i love eggs benedict. i hate all the other kinds. she hesitates.}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{... i hate big weddings with everybody staring. i would like to get married on a weekday while everybody is at work. if i ride off into the sunset, i want my own horse.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{should i be writing this down? she returns to the balcony and hands him the box.}
<C>__{ike }
<A>__{what's this?}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{these are for you. he opens it. it's her running shoes.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{used?}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{they're mine. i'm turning in my running shoes to you.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{this is getting serious. now she is glowing at him, shining with the full force of her.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{and one more thing. i know it's hard to believe there could be more. um... maggie glances around and spots a deck chair, which she turns so it is facing the city lights. then she softly says:}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{if you could have a seat, please. ike sits. maggie takes the box from him and puts it aide. and then she gets down on one knee.}
<C>__{ike}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<A>__{oh my god. no. maggie smiles up at him. ike tips his head back and covers his eyes with his hand.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{no, no don't hide your face, this only happens once in a lifetime. it's definitely a first to me, and you're not going to want to miss it. he smiles as he looks at maggie.}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{i love you, homer eisenhower graham. will you marry me? ike swallows, overwhelmed, overjoyed, and scared shitless.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{maggie, i gotta think about this a little bit. maggie hops cheerfully back to her feet.}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(cheerful)}
<A>__{good. she gets off her knees and stands.}
<C>__{maggie }
<A>__{i was hoping you'd say that.}
<C>__{ike}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<A>__{you were not.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i was, because if you said "yes" right away, i wouldn't get to say this next part. and i've been practicing it.}
<P>__{(pulling up a chair and sitting)}
<A>__{ready?}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{i'm listening.}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(tenderly)}
<A>__{"i guarantee that we'll have tough times. i guarantee that at some point one or both oof us will want to get out. but i also guarantee that if i don't ask you to be mine, i will regret it for the rest of my life. because i know in my heart you're the only one for me". ike takes her hands affectionately.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{pretty good speech, maggie.}
<C>__{maggie}
<A>__{i borrowed it from this guy i know. so? ike looks into maggie's shining face and pauses. he gets up and motions with his hand for her to stay seated. he goes inside and turns on some music. the cat is sitting by the radio. he returns to the balcony and takes maggie's hand.}
<C>__{ike}
<A>__{dance with me. they start to dance a slow dance.}
