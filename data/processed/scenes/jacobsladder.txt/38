<A>__{she smiles warmly. his eyes close and in a matter of seconds he is back asleep.}
<L>__{exterior vietnam pre dawn}
<A>__{we hear summer morning sounds, crickets and birds. the image of trees materializes overhead and a beautiful pink sky, just before sunrise, can be seen through the branches. it is an idyllic setting. suddenly a strange sound can be heard in the distance, a metallic humming, growing louder. there is a scramble of feet and a sound of heavy boots moving through the tall grass. voices can be heard. men's voices.}

<D>__{they're here.}

<D>__{thank god. move 'em out!}
<C>__{voices}
<D>__{bust your balls!}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{move it! move it!}
<A>__{there is an instant swell of activity. trees and branches blur and speed by overhead. the idyllic image of moments before reveals itself as a p.o.v. shot. the camera races out of a jungle covering and into a huge clearing. high overhead a helicopter appears. its blades whirl with a deafening whine. long lines drop from its belly and dangle in mid air. soldiers leap up into the air reaching for them. the air is filled with turbulence. tarps fly off dead bodies. soldiers hold them down. voices yell but the words are not clear. they are filled with urgency. the camera leaves the ground. the edges of the sky disappear as the helicopter's gray mass fills the frame. it grows larger and darker as the camera approaches. rivets and insignias dotting the underbelly come into view. suddenly the stretcher begins spinning, out of control. hands emerge from inside, reaching out to grab it. watery, womb like sounds rise out of nowhere, the rippling of water, a heart beating. gradually voices can be heard mumbling; distant sounds, warm and familiar.}
