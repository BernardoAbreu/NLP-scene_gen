<C>__{tony p}
<D>__{let's rush 'em!}
<A>__{they charge en mass at our heroes... who are waiting for them... pinching their noses closed, the spleen bent over at their forefront... while casanova dances around furious like a cat... furious, fighting the pain of his bullet wound, lunges at him, and casanova neatly sidesteps him... the crooks and disco boys fall back, gasping, choking in the noxious fumes... as casanova attacks... advancing shoulder to shoulder, fighting as a team, our heroes wield machete, fork, shovel, bowling ball, and canned tornado... forcing the villains back... casanova comes at furious relentlessly, kicking and spinning... and furious gets the worst of it. suddenly, a squad of disco boys comes charging at our heroes from the flank... but doc heller turns to face them, shrinker spray held rambo style on his hip. he lets them have it, blasting them with a dense}
<B>__{blue spray...}
<A>__{when the spray clears, the d boys lie squirming on the floor, prisoners in their now child sized disco suits...}
<C>__{disco boys}
<D>__{help!... get me out of this!}
<P>__{(etc.)}
<A>__{upstairs, casanova pummels furious... while, downstairs, the shoveler dispatches the elvis brothers with some nifty shovel work... but suddenly, the bland boys, pistols blazing, are advancing on him, forcing him back against the base of a sculpture. but the raja suddenly leaps up onto the sculpture.}
<C>__{raja }
<D>__{gentlemen!}
<A>__{the bland boys look up and see... the raja, both hands filled with silverware... which he hurls... a beat later the bland boys, bristling with forks and grapefruit spoons, run screaming through the sculptures... as tony p, pistol in hand, skulks out from behind a sculpture and spots... the bowler. upstairs, furious goes flying against a wall...}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{roy, you're making this too easy.}
<A>__{as tony p takes a careful bead on the bowler.}
<C>__{tony p}
<D>__{say hello to daddy for me!}
<A>__{he opens fire, but she goes instantly into her ball svinging frenzy... he fires, missing she's too fast to keep a bead on... finally, his gun clicks empty. she turns and faces him.}

<P>__{(grimly)}
<D>__{daddy says hello.}
<A>__{she hurls the ball at him like a fiery softball pitch. ball's pov going straight for tony p's screaming head... on the bowler, watching as tony's scream is cut short by a gruesose thud. back upstairs casanova cornmes at furious again... but furious ducks the kick, pops back up and smashes casanova with his good arm... sending him flying across the room... casanova recovers.}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{let's change the tune.}
<A>__{he reaches into his pocket and takes out the remote device (that anabel used at the luncheon). he presses a button... on the wolf sculpture as the jaws open, its eyes glow red... and the dreadful sound of the psychostridulator grinds up and fills the night}
<B>__{air like a siren.}
<A>__{downstairs, the foul noise fills the room and our heroes and the villains all go into a full blown psychotic episode... the villains start shooting and stabbing each other. series of shots around the city continuous on main street cars slam into each other. pedestrians start screaming and fightinq... a man and his dog snarl and snap at each other... the customers at the lakeside diner go insane, hurling plates and food... at the shoveler's house the kids turn psycho in front of the television... angle on a typical suburban neighborhood as the sounds of screaming and smashing dishes and furniture can be heard coming from all the houses... long angle of champion city as a din of collective insanity rises up from the city... back to the top of the tower continuous on casanova in full psychotic ecstasy...}
<C>__{casanova}
<D>__{what a rush!}
<P>__{(tosses the remote off the balcony)}
<A>__{on monica, still motionless on the bed... casanova and furious collide in the center of the room and grapple in a contest of psychotically enhanced superhuman strength... casanova gets his hands around furious's throat and crushes it... furious drops to his knees, and casanova thinks he's got him. but furious, grimacing with rage, looks him right in the eye.}
<C>__{furious}
<P>__{(raspy voiced)}
<D>__{is... that... all you got?}
<A>__{furious grabs casanova's wrists... and crushes them. casanova howls with pain, loses his grip. furious slugs him, again and again... then he grabs casanova by the belt, swings him around, and hurls him into the air... casanova crashes into the huge crystal chandelier there is an explosion of crystal and glass. furious averts his eyes as cut glass rains down all around him... then he looks up and sees... casanova's gold chain has hooked onto a fixture of the chandelier. casanova kicks and flails... as he is hanged by the neck on his own gold chain... furious moves to the wolf sculpture. be plunges his hand through its bronze casing, and rips out the heart of the psychostridulator, a flashing football sized device that gives off an unamplifjed, but higher pitched and more irritating sound... furious hurls the device hard against the floor, and it smashes into a thousand pieces... close on one of the pieces in insect sized device that gives off an even higher pitched, even more disorienting sound. this is the very nerve center of the psychostridulator... furious lifts his foot and crushes it hard under his heel...}
<B>__{silence...}
<A>__{furious drops to his knees, wounded, exhausted... he looks up... at casanova, who dangles lifelessly off the chandelier...}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{nice dancing with you.}
<A>__{series of shots various locations continuous as our other heroes return to their senses amidst the vanquished crooks... the traumatized reunants of whom run for it. things also return to normal... on the street... at the lakeside diner... and at the shoveler's house... back to the top of the tower continuous furious moves to the bed, where monica lies motionless and pale...}
<C>__{furious}
<D>__{monica...}
<A>__{he touches her face, her eyes open, and she looks at him.}
