<A>__{viktor, the goateed cold weather warrior, strides out of the outpost and looks up the mountain. he shouts orders to his men. a guard runs up and brings him his weapon: a flame thrower. viktor straps it on and. climbs onto his snowmobile. all around him the guards are driving into position. they form a gauntlet of ak 47's. there must be a dozen of them. viktor rides up twenty yards and waits, his engine idling.}
