<L>__{exterior east 5th street and 2nd avenue day}
<A>__{the cab brakes to a halt, bringing marian into the frame, her face strickened with fear. marian climbs out of the cab as mischa, in the background, opens the trunk to retrieve her bag. marian, taking in the foreign surroundings, seems confused about something.}
<C>__{marian}
<D>__{pardon me, mischa. is this 526 east 5th street?}
<A>__{mischa closes the trunk and approaches marian with her one piece of luggage on a tote.}
<C>__{mischa}
<D>__{no, no. sorry, i can't drive you to door. there's a roadblock on avenue b ...}
<P>__{(he gestures down the street)}
<D>__{right there ...}
<A>__{marian's and mischa's p.o.v. at the far end of the block, we see a movable, blue nypd roadblock. back the two of them, marian looking puzzled.}
<C>__{mischa}
<D>__{this is one way street. you go down the block to the middle.}
<C>__{marian}
<P>__{(pointing uncertainly)}
<D>__{this way?}
<C>__{mischa}
<D>__{yeah. not far. you will be fine.}
<P>__{(beat)}

<C>__{marian}
<D>__{forty five? i thought it was only supposed to be thirty?}
<C>__{mischa}
<D>__{thirty is base price. tolls, tax, tip ... it all adds up.}
<A>__{marian unsnaps her wallet and grudgingly hands the disreputable cabbie two twenties and a five. mischa takes the money and starts away. halfway back to his cab, he turns around and calls out to marian, who stands frozen on the dilapidated street.}
<C>__{mischa}
<D>__{hey, lady.}
<P>__{(marian turns)}
<D>__{hold purse like this.}
<A>__{mischa hugs an imaginary purse close to his side. marian apes his advice in all seriousness.}
<C>__{mischa}
<P>__{(nodding approval)}
<D>__{good luck.}
<A>__{mischa climbs back into his cab and peels off. new angle high down wide of marian standing forlornly at the end of the street, a dayton's shopping bag in one hand, her luggage strapped to the tote in the other.}
