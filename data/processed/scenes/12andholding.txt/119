<L>__{exterior construction site afternoon}
<A>__{gus watches a cement truck, dumping cement into a foundation. once the cement is poured, the truck pulls forward. malee is revealed, standing there and holding a picnic basket. gus sees the new and improved malee for the first time. his jaw drops.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{malee? my god, you look...}
<C>__{malee}
<D>__{different?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{beautiful. you look beautiful.}
<A>__{off malee's smile }
<L>__{exterior construction site another area later}
<A>__{gus and malee eat their lunch.}
<C>__{malee}
<D>__{i felt like i needed a change, you know?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i bet you're driving the boys at school wild.}
<C>__{malee}
<D>__{boys my age are so immature. i'm more attracted to older gentlemen.}
<A>__{malee smiles at gus. he knows where this is going, and he's suddenly nervous.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{you don't want somebody that much older than you. an age difference can cause problems.}
<C>__{malee}
<D>__{what kind of problems?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{a lot of times when a couple has an age difference, they wind up splitting up because they want different things.}
<C>__{malee}
<D>__{you mean sex.}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{gus catches a look of relief on malee's face.}
<C>__{gus }
<D>__{i mean, yeah. you may be 13, but a boy even three years older than you is probably more "experienced". boys can be impatient about that sort of thing.}
<C>__{malee}
<D>__{are you impatient?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{no, but when i was a kid.}
<C>__{malee}
<D>__{why don't you have a girlfriend?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{i did, but it didn't work out.}
<C>__{malee}
<D>__{how old was she?}
<C>__{gus}
<D>__{about my age.}
<C>__{malee}
<D>__{see that, age wasn't an issue, yet you still wanted different things. i don't think it's about age.}
<P>__{(more)}
<C>__{malee }
<D>__{i think when two people connect, they connect for other reasons. and since soulmates are eternal, they have no age.}
<A>__{gus is stumped.}
