<C>__{derek}
<D>__{take your hands off him, seth.}
<A>__{seth sees blood on derek’s face and shirt and draws his pistol. he points it at derek’s head from four feet away.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{where’s cammeron?}
<A>__{derek stares directly into the barrel of seth’s pistol.}
<C>__{danny}
<P>__{(frightened)}

<P>__{(turning back to dan)}
<D>__{did you get all of that?}
<A>__{seth glances over to a nodding danny. the second he takes his eyes off of derek, derek grabs the pistol. a shot goes off and people hit the deck. derek wrestles the pistol away and kicks seth in the stomach. falling to the ground in pain, derek cracks him in the face with his fist twice and it’s over. tight on derek. he turns with the pistol, takes the clip out and walks over to danny.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{take a good look around, man.}
<A>__{he makes his way over to stacey, hands her the pistol, and launches the clip over a fence. the entire party watches derek exit the party.}
