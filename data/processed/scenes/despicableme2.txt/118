<D>__{agnes, no!}
<A>__{agnes stops and sees evil minion kevin already has it in his mouth. agnes screams a crazy high pitched scream. it shatters all the glass in the room, including the glass in evil minion kevin's goggles. he spits out the unicorn. he is slowed him down for a bit, so agnes safely grabs the unicorn, and margo grabs agnes's hand. they run for the elevator to the lower level, with the purple minion hot on their tails. the elevator drops just in time. evil minion kevin slams into the glass door.}
