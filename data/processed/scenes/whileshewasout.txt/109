<A>__{she sees that she is in the shadows of a big old pine tree. she creeps behind its massive gnarled trunk and silently slides open the toolbox, fumbles around for the screwdriver. she removes it from the box and grasps it tight. della rises slowly, remaining concealed behind the tree. she reaches up and softly places the toolbox deep in the junction of the first sturdy branch and the tree trunk. she pulls herself up onto the branch and edges in close to the trunk. she peeks between the branches. no sign of the boys. she pulls herself further up into the tree, branch by branch. the thin stiff outer branches, fringed with sharp little needles, fall like a jagged veil around her. she waits. she's high enough up to have a clear view of the landscape below despite the darkness. she makes out the faint echo of voices, strains to hear.}
