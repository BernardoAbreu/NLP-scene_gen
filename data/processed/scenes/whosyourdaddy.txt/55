<L>__{exterior tecumseh high school morning}
<A>__{a beautiful spring morning. cars pull into the school parking lot. students mingle in small groups. making their way into the building. a group of guys look up. suddenly, a helicopter swooshes through the air, circling the school as if to get everyone's attention, then landing on a grassy knoll. the helicopter is painted heavenly blue with a pattern of white billowy clouds. the door slides open and out hops ted. in slow mo. looking seriously cool from the tips of his silver toed boots to his stylish persol shades. until he takes a second step and stumbles slightly, catching himself from falling face first into the grass. charlie is right behind him. looking great, too, but vaguely mafioso in his efforts to be hip. he turns to the beautiful blonde pilot and plants a big wet kiss for everyone to see. ted and charlie strut towards the school as principal merkin bursts through the front doors, shouting...}
<C>__{principal merkin}
<D>__{you cannot land a helicopter in my school yard! get that blasted thing out of here!}
<A>__{ted raises his hand. the chopper rises as if on cue. without a word, ted and charlie pass the ruffled principal merkin and strut toward the entrance. classmates surround ted. congratulating him. everyone wanting to be ted's new best friend. julie walks up to charlie.}

<D>__{that explains the emptiness that haunts me.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{jealousy is so unattractive.}
<A>__{ted makes eye contact with julie. winking like he's don juan. she just stares at him, blankly.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{second only to unfettered arrogance and the inability to see the irony therein.}
<A>__{charlie's baffled by that one.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{wanna see my hickey from miss december?}
<A>__{julie groans.}
