<L>__{exterior the cliffs day}
<A>__{the massive cliffs. earl's eyes bug out. in seconds they'll be right at the brink with nowhere to run.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{this better be one great plan!}
<A>__{as they skid to a stop at the very brink, val breaks off the bomb fuse, leaving only one inch of it. he whirls to check the progress of the advancing creatures.}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{get ready!}
<A>__{he holds the bomb out to rhonda. she instantly tries to light it. he grabs her wrist so hard it hurts.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{light it, man! light it!!}
<C>__{val}
<D>__{not yet, not yet...}
<A>__{the charging creatures are almost underfoot. finally val pulls rhonda's hand over to light the fuse. instantly he hurls the bomb as far as he can, behind the creatures.}
<C>__{earl}
<D>__{too far! you threw it behind them!}
<A>__{the ground opens under their feet! tentacles snake toward val and earl. a horrid mouth clamps onto rhonda's boot. she screams as it starts to pull her down. whooom!! the bomb explodes! the creatures shriek in pain, instantly releasing their prey and racing away from the painful shock wave in the only direction they can }
