<L>__{interior ned's law office day}
<A>__{richly appointed with stately oak, walls lined with law books. as in all "noir" thrillers, venetian blinds cast dramatic slashes of light and ceiling fans turn lazily in every room. ned hurries in, rummaging through the files on his desk. laura, a strikingly lovely brunette, enters from the outer office, files in hand. she is ned's astute, dedicated, self sacrificing "girl friday" and legal secretary. she keeps his life from spinning crazily apart. she absolutely adores him.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{laura... do you know where...?}
<C>__{laura}
<P>__{(hands him file)}
<D>__{right here. the judge decided to skip arraignment and take milo direct to trial. you're six minutes late, but don't sweat it. you got judge allen. he's always eleven minutes late.}
<A>__{she picks up a lawbook, flips it open to a dog eared page.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i suggest you try lemming versus florida, 1956... where the guy jumped in the water and everybody followed.}
<C>__{ned}
<P>__{(thinks about it)}
<D>__{yeah. good idea.}
<A>__{he smiles gratefully... drops the file into his briefcase. ned heads for the office washroom. laura darts ahead of him into the washroom and turns the water on. ned steps in... splashes some water on his face. laura grabs a towel from the rack where three small towels hang neatly... hands it to ned. he dries his face, looking at her with genuine fondness and gratitude.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i don't know what i'd do without you?}
<A>__{she glances toward the toilet, notices it hasn't been flushed. she flushes it, lowers the seat.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{really?}
<A>__{she sits down on the toilet seat, watching him adoringly as he shaves with an electric razor.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{laura, how long have you worked for me?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{two years, seven months, twenty three days, nineteen hours...}
<P>__{(checks her watch)}
<D>__{...six minutes and fifty two seconds.}
<P>__{(softly, to herself)}
<D>__{...fifty three... fifty four... fifty five... fifty six...}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{and when was the last time i gave you a raise?}
<A>__{laura neatly folds the end of the toilet paper into a pointerior}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{never. but that's okay. i don't need a raise. in fact... i was thinking of giving you a rebate on my salary.}
<A>__{he clicks off the razor, turns to look at her for a long moment, considering this, then...}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{naw. that's okay. you keep it.}
<A>__{he gives her a manly pat on the shoulder then casually tosses the towel onto the rack, where it hangs sloppily askew... right next to her face. he exits. laura stares at the towel with a tortured expression. the camera pushes in to her face as we see...}
