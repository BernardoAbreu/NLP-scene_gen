<L>__{interior hotel room night}
<A>__{haven stands in the darkness only lighted by lights of the saloon next door. he stands there looking vaguely out the window, sucking his knuckles absently as he listens to the piano playing. then he goes wearily to the bed and falls on it gratefully, shutting his eyes, the towels still across his shoulder. there is a moment of silence and then a soft knock at the door. another knock, and painfully haven lifts himself on one elbow and drags out his gun. the door opens and charlie enters. she shuts it behind her and stands looking at him. he lets the gun fall and turns over on his back. charlie walks across to the bed and stands looking down at him.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{how do you feel?}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{like a million dollars.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you just cost me a thousand. you lost your pipe in the fight. i brought it to you.}
<A>__{she puts it on the table beside the bed. haven's eyes follow her. she sees the towels, takes them to the washstand, soaks them and brings them back and compresses them gently on haven's bruised face. when she takes the towel away, he pulls himself up a little, propped against the pillow, looking at her curiously. she sits down on the edge of the bed.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{do you always get sweet with the men who fight over you?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{only the winners.}
<A>__{he watches her as she wets the towels again, returns and wraps his hands in them, sitting again on the edge of the bed.}
<C>__{haven}
<D>__{tell me something }
<C>__{charlie}
<P>__{(quietly, smiling)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(he lies back)}
<D>__{that fellow might have killed me }
<P>__{(sleepily)}
<D>__{where do you bury the losers?}
<A>__{he is almost asleep. she takes the now unused towel and puts it back in the basin, soaks it, returns with it and tucks it against the side of his face.}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{you talk too much.}
<C>__{haven}
<P>__{(bitterly)}
<D>__{what do you want the next dance?}
<C>__{charlie}
<D>__{i think you'd better sit this one out.}
<A>__{he is sound asleep the next second. she stares at him; rises, puts the blanket over him and goes quietly out.}
