<D>__{by the time we reached the mexican shore, i was afraid to let go of the boat. my strength was gone. i was so weak. i was afraid that in two feet of water, so close to deliverance, i would drown. i struggled to shore and fell upon the sand. it was warm and soft, like pressing my face against the cheek of god. and somewhere two eyes were smiling at having me there.}
<A>__{an empty coastline, nothing but sand, rocks and jungle. pi struggles to bring the lifeboat ashore. richard parker is hiding under the tarp, nowhere to be seen. pi pulls the painter line until the boat is on the beach, then collapses on the sand.}
