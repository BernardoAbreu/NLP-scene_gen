<L>__{interior turbine room night}
<A>__{there are metal grating steps leading up to a platform that sits adjacent to a huge spinning turbine, its six foot blades whirring at top speed. air ducts lead in and out of the space. connie is uplifted, frightened, exhilarated. their clothes and hair are blown around. they ascend the platform, and sit across from each other. they each take a swig. they kiss softly, spiritually.}
