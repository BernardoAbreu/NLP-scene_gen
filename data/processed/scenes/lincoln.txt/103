<A>__{like a vision of apocalypse, a city on the banks of a broad river is being consumed in a hellish fire, as artillery shells rend the dark sky asunder, raining down destruction.}

<A>__{the morning is grey, and a dense fog covers a vast field. lincoln, his stovepipe hat atop his head, is mounted on a horse on a rise at one end of the field. behind him, several union officers are also mounted. it's chilly; the breath of the men and the horses is visible. title: outside petersburg, virginia}
<C>__{april 3}
<A>__{lincoln flicks the reins of his horse, which starts down the slope. the officers follow behind him. no one speaks. lincoln rides slowly, his focus on the ground before him. debris is scattered all around him, along with the bodies of fallen soldiers. he looks up and across the battlefield; a terrible battle has concluded a couple of hours ago. looking down, as he rides, he sees soldiers killed by artillery fire, whose bodies lie twisted, burned, headless, limbless, torn in two, blown out of their clothing or charred too badly to tell. he sees soldiers killed by rifle and bayonet, whose corpses are intact. at the beginning of his ride, all the dead and wounded are in union blue, the casualties of confederate cannon fire, felled as the union army, about six hours earlier, began its final, successful drive to break through confederate lines. as lincoln and his escorts move across the battlefield, grey and blue uniformed corpses and badly wounded men intermingle. he reaches the other side of the field, passing a confederate flag to enter the now ruined town of petersburg.}
