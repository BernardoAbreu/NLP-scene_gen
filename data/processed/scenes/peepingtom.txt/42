<A>__{mr. jarvis is immersed in reading a script... his eyes race across the page. over his shoulder we see what he is reading... a sheet of figures attached to the script. at the same time mr. jarvis is holding a telephone receiver to his ear and we hear an enthusiastic voice filtered through it: voice (off screen)}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{...it's a wonderful subject, d.j.... paramount wants it, m.g.m. wants it, columbia wants it.}
<C>__{jarvis}
<D>__{but is it commercial?}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{danny angel wants it!}
<A>__{still reading the script, mr. jarvis lays the receiver on his desk and picks up another.}
<C>__{jarvis}
<D>__{are those budgets ready? well bring 'em in.}
<A>__{he replaces this receiver and picks up the original. the voice is still talking something about 'a wonderful part for kenny or alec'...}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{send me a memo we'll discuss it next week.}
<A>__{he replaces the receiver. miss simpson enters. she hands him some folders... her smile curtsies. close shot of mr. jarvis opening a folder. over his shoulder we see a page covered with row upon row of figures. the great man's finger skims along the figures like a tailor feeling cloth.}
