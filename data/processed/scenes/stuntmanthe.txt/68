<L>__{63 angle on cameron (and steeple)}
<A>__{gauging the fifteen foot gap between the church steeple and the roof of the nearby municipal building. he unconsciously grimaces at the four story drop between them.}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(being glib)}
<D>__{once, to save my ass, i jumped out of a banana tree into an oxcart full of buffalo shit. does that count?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{we'll see. put these on.}
<A>__{he throws cameron some knee pads from his stunt bag and begins marking off two lines on the bare earth between the gravestones in the churchyard.}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(puzzled by the pads)}
<D>__{where do they go?}
<C>__{chuck}
<P>__{(tapping his knee)}
<D>__{under the pants.}
<P>__{(pointing to lines he has drawn)}
<D>__{i want you to jump from here...to there.}
<A>__{cameron hops up to the starting line, finishing with the knee pads clumsily, surveys the distance of not more than seven feet.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{okie dokie.}
<A>__{makes a casual jump, landing on the line and looking at chuck for approval.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{very good. except you're dead!! your brains are scattered all over the goddamn pavement. you landed on the edge and fell backwards four stories. where do we send the body?}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(returns to the starting line)}
<D>__{don't bury me yet.}
<A>__{he takes a running start and leaps hard. while he's still in mid air, chuck yells.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{you're still dead! you fell over the other side of the building.}
<A>__{cameron has landed three beyond the mark and looks up at chuck a bit shaken.}
<C>__{chuck }
<D>__{you wanna try it right, once? you should land in a tuck and roll.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{show me, sergeant.}
<A>__{chuck launches himself head first. his hands touch the ground just beyond the second mark to break his fall, easing him into a shoulder roll, he somersaults to his feet.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{very fancy.}
<A>__{he takes a running start and does the same. not quite as well, but well enough. as he rolls to his feet:}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{okay?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{better.}
<C>__{cameron}
<D>__{my speciality is hopscotch.}
<A>__{chuck turns on him enraged, overreacting.}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{and burt's specialty was drowning. you know one goddamn daredevil on this picture was enough! what the hell was eli thinking, giving me a smart ass, cocky, amateur kid when i need a stunt man! it's a little different running across that roof when they're pumping tracer bullets over your head.}
<C>__{cameron}
<P>__{(eloquently pleading his case)}
<D>__{i was running for twenty six months with guys shooting at me...not over my head...at my head and i'm alive. i knew daredevils. i got nothing against them...it's just they're all dead. so ease off and give me a chance...}
<A>__{cameron is surprised to see that chuck is grinning.}
<C>__{cameron }
<P>__{(genuinely)}
<D>__{hey, were you putting me on?}
<C>__{chuck}
<D>__{me? i wouldn't know how to do that.}
<A>__{chuck starts to walk away, then stops and looks at cameron.}
