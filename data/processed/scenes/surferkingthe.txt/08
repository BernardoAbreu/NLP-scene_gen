<L>__{exterior morning moments later outside uniform building}
<A>__{robbie and alex walk up to yet another line of about 4 or 5 teens. at the front a teenage girl and a teenage guy are behind a counter and handing out uniforms based on a clipboard list. as robbie and alex reach the back of the line, tiffany, a blond beauty and two other girls brush past them to the front of the line.}
<C>__{robbie}
<P>__{(taken aback, breathing in through his nose)}
<D>__{whoa....who was that?}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(unimpressed, putting his hand}
<D>__{on robbie's shoulder as if to hold him back, like a horse}
<P>__{that is riled up)}
<D>__{eeeaasy there, big fella. not in your lifetime.}
<P>__{(wistfully, glancing over)}
<D>__{or mine.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{so who is she?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{miss tiffany maxwell, daughter of big mike maxwell, owner and operator of this here fine water park.}
<A>__{we see tiffany and her two friends are quickly given their uniforms by the attendants, as they ignore the kids who have waited in line.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{see, princess tiffany and her friends pretty much have the run of the park. her boyfriend is dan peterson, a guy we all call cowboy, one of the lifeguards. pretty decent guy from what i can tell. but she's a piece of work. your best strategy is to steer clear of her and she won't cause you any trouble.}
<C>__{robbie}
<D>__{cowboy, huh. big guy?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{big. guy.}
