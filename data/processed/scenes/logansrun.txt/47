<A>__{the waiting room has many mirrors...where customers ...male and female...are checking their faces (and bodies). there are also various photographs on the walls... suggestions for changes to foreheads, eyes, cheeks, lips, etcetera. the chatty informality is very much like people in a beauty parlor or barber shop. there is a receptionist seated behind a desk in a corner. logan and jessica walk up to the desk. the receptionist looks at logan...ignoring jessica.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{hello, sandman.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{do you want to see doc?}
<A>__{logan nods, impatient he knows someone's watching.}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{we don't get many sandmen. i think we've only had one other since i've been here.}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(brusquely)}
<D>__{a sandman can get as sick of his face as anyone else. where's the doctor?}
<C>__{receptionist}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i like your face. would you mind if doc took a picture? i'd like him to give your face to somebody else.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{it's all right with me. is he here?}
<C>__{receptionist}
<D>__{my name's holly...holly 13. in ancient times they said my number was unlucky. do you believe in luck?}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{no look, i'm in a hurry.}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{doc'll be with you soon, sandman.}
<A>__{logan and jessica walk to one of the chairs in the waiting area and sit down next to an attractive woman.}
<C>__{woman customer}
<D>__{is this your first time?}
<A>__{logan and jessica nod.}
<C>__{woman customer}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{this is my third...}

<C>__{woman customer}
<D>__{no. but i hear he's terrific. have you seen any of his work?}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{just one.}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{doc's ready, sandman.}
<A>__{logan and jessica stand. they follow holly into a large, shining, stainless steel room where we see: med. angle doc who looks about twenty one years old, exchanges a pointed look with jessica.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{it's a real privilege, sandman.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{thanks.}
<P>__{(slightest beat)}

<D>__{i am.}

<A>__{full angle the surgical apparatus aesculaptor mark iii the latest in servo surgical designs. completely self contained tilt bed, cryojector services embedded in the platform. the mark iii's laser heads are integrated into the whole cocoon, swiveled and gimbaled so as to be able to focus any of the surgical beams in microscopic delicacy or wide bladed scraping. the machine vaguely resembles an enormously complicated x ray table on an angle the great slotted laser heads overhanging it and integral with it. from the cryonic receptor base there is a steady exhalation of cold the vapor seeping steadily downwards, blurring the endlessly looped and tangled tubes and wires and containers which join in solid state circuitry so that any random or involuntary twitch of a patient will be instantly compensated by an equivalent move of the laser head keeping the focus precise. at one end where the halves of the mark iii join, is n console of switches and dials lights nod servo recorders which control the operation from the first injection of cold to the final healing vacuum drafts and scar burnishing. with the air of a magician demonstrating, doc goes to the console and flips switches. instantly the table responds the platform tilting, the crab like laser arms descending flexing small vapor jets oozing as the beams slash harmlessly across the table. beaming, doc turns it off and the whole apparatus subsides.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{i designed it myself.}
<P>__{(slightest beat)}
<D>__{what'll it be ...a face job or a full body job?}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{just the face.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{fine....holly will get you ready. you're in good hands, believe me.}
<A>__{holly comes forward and unbuttons the collar on logan's tunic. as holly brushes her fingertips lightly down logan's arms:}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{holly works here because she gets a lift out of watching the table...}

<D>__{he's going to sterilize himself.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{do i have to undress?}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{not for your face.}
<A>__{logan follows holly to the table. (jessica remains behind with doc who speaks to her with soft urgency).}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{you shouldn't have brought him here. jessica; i didn't bring him what's the difference. he's blinking. he wants to run.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{run!? he's a sandman.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{i tell you he's running. i know.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{maybe...maybe. but i wish he'd gone somewhere else.}
<P>__{(a beat, a shrug)}
<D>__{all right. he gets a face.}
<A>__{the surgical table logan and holly logan lies down. the table ripples...accepting his weight prisoning and positioning him.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(leaning close to logan)}
<D>__{i like dark hair. have him give you dark hair.}
<C>__{doc's voice}
<D>__{all set?}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{um huh. would you take a picture of him, doc? i'd like you to give his face to somebody else.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{why not?}
<A>__{doc pushes a button...there is a tiny flash.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{do you have anything special in mind?}

<D>__{i don't care...just get it over with.}
<C>__{doc}

<C>__{doc}
<D>__{holly'd like a lot of things.}
<P>__{(studying logan's face)}
<D>__{we can start by narrowing the cheekbones.}
<A>__{doc presses buttons on the control board. jessica, who is standing next to doc, is slightly startled as the table begins to hum...as a pair of laser beams separate themselves from the overhead cluster and extend toward logan, forming inner cones as they approach. cryojector needles start to close in on them, nearing their faces and shoulders slowly...the visible cold streaming off the points. a vibrobeam begins to keen. sound: an insistent chiming. doc hears the sound and turns with the martyred air of a man who's been called to the phone too many times. he turns to a phone like apparatus nearby, shifting the table into neutral as he turns. the table and the laser heads stop moving.}
<C>__{doc}
<P>__{(as if speaking on a phone)}
<D>__{hello}
<P>__{(listening)}
<D>__{yes}
<P>__{(listening)}
<D>__{yes, they are.}
<P>__{(listening; his expression changing)}
<D>__{done.}
<A>__{doc turns back to the console, pausing to stare intently at logan, then up at the brightly smiling holly. something in his look registers, and holly's smile fades. now doc engages the machine again...}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{pay attention, sandman. i'm proud of this machine.}
<A>__{as he speaks he presses and an arm sweeps downward and into position near logan's face. it pauses as}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{with this one there's no waiting for scar burnishing. it's all in one...watch now...}
<A>__{the laser arm sweeps across logan's forehead and cheeks, leaving a bright trail of blood as}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{but here's the improvement. instant healing before you feel a thing. watch now...}
<A>__{doc pushes a special button and the arm sweeps back along the track, spraying healing fluid. magically the blood vanishes and the skin is moist and whole. the surgical table logan his face tense he knows something's wrong. over him holly's bright face with its rapt look. she's not sure, but she enjoys whatever's happening.}
<B>__{back to doc}
<A>__{who is playing the console as he speaks.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{perfect depth adjustment on this one, sandman. the beam will cut through that uniform and just exactly through the skin beneath absolute precision. watch now}
<A>__{and the machine does its stuff, slashing through logan's tunic a seam of blood following the rip.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{of course, it doesn't mend uniforms, sandman, but otherwise it does everything, doesn't it? just imagine what would happen to you if the healing stopped functioning.}
<A>__{and the arm moves back again, spraying the healing fluid into logan's new wound. again the blood disappears. suddenly doc's look is ferocious. he turns off the healing switch and punches buttons fiercely. the laser arms begin to move wildly and the sounds become shrill. holly looks alarmed.}
<C>__{holly}
<D>__{no! you're scrambling the table. he'll be cut to pieces, doc.}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{damn right! it was a trap. they know!}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{no i'm running!}
<A>__{machine begins to whine loudly. jessica tries to turn the machine off...doc starts to wrestle with her as:}
