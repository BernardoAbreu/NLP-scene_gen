<L>__{interior "jake lamotta's" night (1956)}
<A>__{jake, an empty glass in his hand, stands on the bar platform. he's wearing a white tuxedo jacket with a red rose in the lapel. his tuxedo shirt is stained. he continues his monologue.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{valentine's day. the anniversary of the st. valentine's day massacre. robinsin didn't use a machine gun but it was still a massacre...}
<P>__{(takes another drink)}
<D>__{actually, i was doin' okay at first. in fact, by the end of the fifth round i really had him worried he thought he killed me. you know, i could keep tellin' you this brilliant material all night but you'd only laugh. now i'm gonna sing. any requests? i mean, besides "don't"!}
<P>__{(then to piano player)}
<D>__{ in the key of h.}
<P>__{(then to audience)}
<D>__{you're laughin'. give me the right key and i will play in anybody's flat! i sing for a reason. when i finish, you'll be so sobered up, we'll sell a lot of booze.}
<A>__{jake's onstage version of "that's entertainment" differs from the backstage version. it's not just that he's a little drunk no, his voice is defiant, sadly defiant. he is singing at the patrons rather than to them.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{"when the fighter's not engaged in his employment, his employment, although he was champ and quite the rage, he must go somewhere else to seek employment, seek employment. so what does he do? he goes upon the stage and meets his true adversaries, all you members of the human race. but a fighter's life is not a bowl of cherries, still i'd rather have an egg than a fist upon my face... that's entertainment!}
<A>__{jake brings the band to a crescendo with a wave of his hand, then silences it. the spotlight goes out and there is a hearty round of applause. jake receives the kisses, glad handshakes and congratulations of the patrons as he works his way around the club. jake's new friends love him. they are party girls, sports figures, columnists, mobsters, b actors, and other "celebrities." jake poses for a still with two buxom young lovelies. one girl giggles as he fondles her. after the flash goes off, the girls admire his "small, delicate" hands. jake steps over to a table and greets j.r., a newspaper columnist, and his companions.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{j.r., glad you could make it.}
<C>__{j.r.}
<D>__{you were great, jake. just like old times. good thing sugar ray wasn't here tonight. oh jake, this is state's attorney bronson and his wife.}
<A>__{jake shakes his hand, then holds it up showing an empty palm.}
<C>__{jake}
<P>__{(joking)}
<D>__{sorry, empty! heh, heh! oh, i didn't mean that. if i don't give your husband no money, he won't have enough to buy you a drink. to show you i'm a nice guy, this one's on me. the last one was your payment for this month.}
<A>__{bronson is embarrassed. he doesn't think the joke is funny, but he manages a smile. his wife gives a nervous laugh. jake leans over and kisses her.}
<C>__{jake }
<D>__{you're a good sport, lady.}
<C>__{j.r.}
<D>__{i saw you fight bob satterfield in '46, jake. in chicago. you were great.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{yeah, i really cleaned up on him.}
<C>__{j.r.}
<D>__{where's your wife, jake?}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{do you think i'd let her in a place like this with guys like you hangin' around?}
<A>__{jake feigns a few jabs, and they all laugh. he walks off. as jake leaves, j.r. whispers to his friend:}
<C>__{j. r.}
<D>__{you ought to see his wife.}
<A>__{jake steps over to a table where some of the "boys" are sitting. ricky is the miami 1956 version of salvy.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{hey, ricky, glad you came.}
<C>__{ricky}
<D>__{wouldn't miss it, jake.}
<A>__{jake calls a waitress over.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{hey, honey, give these fellas a round on me. i can tell they're gonna be regular customers.}
<A>__{the waitress says to a clearly underaged girl:}
<C>__{waitress}
<D>__{i will have to ask for your i.d.}
<A>__{jake leans over and gives the young girl a long kiss on the lips. she enthusiastically reciprocates.}
<C>__{jake}
<D>__{whew! any girl that can kiss like that can drink in my club any time!}
<A>__{they all laugh as jake moves on. the life of the party.}
