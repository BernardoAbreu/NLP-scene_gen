<A>__{we're in a large closet. jack kiefer, an athletic american in his late thirties wearing a headset, is wedged into a corner, staring at a television screen. the television shows a surveillance view of the living room that lies outside the confines of the closet. the tv image is in black and white. jack shifts, trying like hell to get comfortable but he's been there a while}
<B>__{on the screen}
<A>__{a bare bulb shines down on the contents of a shabby hotel room. directly under the blub a man, gennady kasimov, sits in a straight backed wooden chair in his blood stained t shirt. there are a couple of thugs and a stray hooker in the room behind him. a legend:}
<C>__{kiev}
<A>__{kasimov is sobbing. uncontrollably. a man enters the room, anatoly, an imperious russian in his forties, a russian godfather. the thugs and hookers are ushered out. anatoly looks down at kasimov pitiously and urges him to go and sit by him in a chair he picks up for him. kasimov does as he is bid, looking gratefully up at anatoly. they speak in russian which is subtitled.}

<D>__{i don't remember what happened! we were at the bar, drinking, laughing having fun.}
<A>__{anatoly gets up out of the chair and goes to a bed across the room. a woman lies half under the sheets. she's lying in an unnatural position on the bed, and the sheets are smeared with blood. she's dead. anatoly lifts her eyelid.}

<A>__{jack reacts.}
