<L>__{interior will's room. day.}
<A>__{will comes into his room, goes straight to his table in the window, and arranges pen, ink, and paper. now he has his ritual: he spins round once in a circle, rubs his hands together and spits on the floor. then he sits down, picks up his pen, and stares in front of him. pause. then he begins to write.}
<L>__{interior de lessepses' house. viola's bedroom. night.}
<A>__{the nurse is undressing her, though viola tries intermittently to push her away. she is still bright with excitement.}
<C>__{viola}
<D>__{did you like proteus or valentine best? proteus for speaking, valentine for looks.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{i liked the dog, for laughs.}
<C>__{viola}
<D>__{but silvia i did not care for much. his fingers were red from fighting and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons. stage love will never be true love while the law of the land has our heroines played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats! oh, when can we see another?}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{when the queen commands it.}
<C>__{viola}
<D>__{but at the playhouse. nurse?}

<C>__{nurse }
<D>__{playhouses are not for well born ladies.}
<C>__{viola}
<D>__{i am not so well born.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{well monied is the same as well born and well married is more so. lord wessex was looking at you tonight.}
<C>__{viola}
<D>__{all the men at court are without poetry. if they look at me they see my father's fortune. i will have poetry in my life. and adventure. and love. love above all.}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{like valentine and silvia?}
<C>__{viola}
<D>__{no . . . not the artful postures of love, but love that over throws life. unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart, and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture. love like there has never been in a play.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i will have love or i will end my days as a . . .}
<C>__{nurse}
<D>__{as a nurse.}
<C>__{viola}
<P>__{(kissing her)}
<D>__{but i would be valentine and silvia too. good nurse, god save you and good night. i would stay asleep my whole life if i could dream myself into a company of players.}
<A>__{viola goes over to the window.}
