<A>__{iris trips on the landing, spins sprawling across the filthy tile floor, and comes up running. panting with fear and exertion she clears the turnstiles like a hurdler. the cops pound down the stairs two at a time. spreg draws his 9mm. in his eyes we see an unaccountable craziness... a hunter who has as much at stake somehow as the prey. street people fall back as spreg thunders through them. they aren't about to get in the way of this juggernaut cop and his boy wonder. the two cops reach the platform. no iris in sight. moving with them as they slow to a walk, scanning. a couple of low lifes standing around, waiting for trains, eye them warily as spreg gets a call on his rover.}

<A>__{a train pulls into the station with a whoosh of air. a few people board. there is only the sound of the cops' footsteps as they move along the empty platform. with a pneumatic hiss the train's doors begin to close. suddenly iris breaks from behind a column up ahead at a full sprinterior spreg unleashes his size 13 cop shoes, thundering along the platform to intercept her. engelman straight arms his pistol.}

<A>__{iris clears the doors just as they hiss shut. her momentum carries her clear across the car, where she slams into the far wall and staggers back, almost falling. she gasps for breath and looks up to see... ... spreg crashing against the outside of the doors she just came through as the train starts to move. he tries to force the doors apart... can't. he aims his gun through the window. thinking fast iris dives to his side of the car and presses herself up against the solid wall next to the door, where he can't see her. outside, spreg is running next to the accelerating train. he swings his pistol, smashing the window with the butt. iris screams as spreg lunges through the opening next to her like some uniformed nightmare and grabs her. he is still running alongside, pulling on her. trying to drag her right out through the window. she struggles. bites his beefy hand. he swears and lets go. then makes one last grab. gets his fingers into her long mane of hair. yanks on her. she comes half out the window, screaming. then... rip! the hair pulls off her head. spreg drops away, behind the speeding train, holding a red wig. he looks at it stupidly, then raises his pistol and fires at iris. she jerks back through the window and drops to the floor. a couple of shots hit the metal outside. we see iris has short hair, platinum white. in it are a few of the many pins which held the wig securely in place. she gasps for air, sobbing and hugging her knees, trembling all over. spreg stands on the platform, watching the train disappear, as engelman runs up. spreg looks at the wig in his hand, disgusted. he turns it and looks inside, at the cap. close on the cap inside the wig: there is an intricate network of sensors in a grid over the entire underside of the wig. the sensors are connected by wires, in a pattern like the veins of a leaf, bundling to a small, flat metal box, the size of a cigarette case. it is a squid net. iris was wired. spreg just stares at the squid net, eyes going crazy wide.}
