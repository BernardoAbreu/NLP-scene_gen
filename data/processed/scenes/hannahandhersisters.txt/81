<L>__{exterior central park day}
<A>__{hare krishna music is heard over a sunlit view of the manhattan skyline and the green trees of central park. the camera moves down to reveal a large group of hare krishnas dancing on the broad green lawn among other new yorkers enjoying the day. the leader, holding some pamphlets, stands by a chain link fence, a few feet away from his group, talking to someone on the other side. it's mickey, as the camera soon shows, wearing a short sleeved shirt, a paper tucked under his arm.}
<C>__{krishna leader}
<D>__{what makes you interested in becoming a hare krishna?}

<C>__{krishna leader}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{you're afraid of dying?}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(gesturing)}
<D>__{well...yeah, naturally. aren't you? i l let me ask you, reincarnation, does that mean my soul would pass to another human being, or would i come back as a moose or an aardvark or something?}
<C>__{krishna leader}
<P>__{(handing some krishna}

<D>__{take our literature...}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(nodding, taking the material)}
<D>__{uh huh.}

<D>__{...read it over, and think about it.}
<C>__{mickey}
<P>__{(looking down at the material he's just received)}
<D>__{well, okay. thank you very much.}
<C>__{krishna leader}
<D>__{you're welcome. hare krishna.}
<A>__{mickey walks off, the hare krishnas still dancing and singing on the other side of the fence. he flips through the literature as he walks, then looks straight ahead, pondering. his voice is heard over the screen.}
<C>__{mickey }
<D>__{who are you kidding? you're gonna be a krishna? you're gonna shave your head and put on robes and dance around at airports? you'll look like jerry lewis. oh, god, i'm so depressed.}
<A>__{mickey puts his hand to his mouth as another title appears on a black screen.}
<D>__{autumn chill.}
<A>__{bach's concerto for harpsichord is heard as the film cuts to the waterfront at dusk. a bench faces some wharf pilings; the water gently laps against them as lee walks into view, the wind blowing her hair. she stands and faces the water and the distant skyline across the bay. the view is contemplative, beautiful in the dim light. lee is alone; her hands are in her pockets. lee, thinking, is heard over the scene; the harpsichord music plays in the background.}
<C>__{lee }
<D>__{the nights are really getting cooler. summer went so quickly. soon it'll be fall.}
<P>__{(walking to the beach and sitting down)}
<D>__{my literature professor really likes me. it was fun being out with him last night.}
<P>__{(staring pensively at the water)}
<D>__{funny. i feel like i'm betraying elliot...but that's ridiculous. why shouldn't i see doug? elliot's not free.}
<P>__{(pausing)}
<D>__{just go one step at a time. let's see what the next few months bring.}
<A>__{the concerto stops and the movie cuts to holly, leaning into an open phone booth near a subway entrance. she wears a football jacket, jeans, and sneakers; she holds a manuscript in her arms. it's a busy corner. people rush past holly towards the subway; others are walking up the station steps. holly smokes a cigarette as she talks on the phone to hannah.}
<C>__{holly}
<P>__{(into the telephone)}
<D>__{hannah? hi. listen, um, you'll be happy to know that your money has not gone completely to waste... no, i have an actual first rough draft of something i wrote... yeah. yeah. yeah, well, i showed it to lee, and she gave me some good pointers. and, um, listen, i'm pretty near where you live. i wonder if i could just drop it off...and, you know, when you have time, some time, read it, an and we'll talk when i come over at thanksgiving. okay? all right. okay. oh, wait, wait.}
<P>__{(turning her body, still on the phone)}
<D>__{listen. listen. i think lee met an interesting guy at columbia... yeah. yeah, well, he sounds really nice...}
<P>__{(puffing on her cigarette)}
<D>__{yeah. okay. all right. well, we'll talk at thanksgiving. bye bye.}
<A>__{holly hangs up the phone and takes a drag on her cigarette. she looks off in the distance, smiling, as the film cuts to:}
