<A>__{they reach the door. william hops off the horse and reaches up to help her down the moment she touches the ground, they look into each other's eyes... but the door is snatched open so quickly by her mother that there is not time for a kiss.}

<D>__{marion, come in!}
<A>__{he walks her closer to the door. they turn and look at each other again. she waits for him to kiss her...}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{marion, come in!}
<A>__{she still hesitates; he isn't going to kiss her. she starts in, but he grabs her hand. and into it he puts something he has taken from his pocket; it is wrapped in flannel. he hops on his horse, glances at her, and gallops away. she stands in the open doorway; she looks down at what he left her. she unwraps the flannel; it is a dried thistle, the one she gave him years before.}
