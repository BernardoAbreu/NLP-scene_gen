<L>__{exterior car and street. dusk.}
<A>__{c.w. and blanche go out. we go with them. they get in the car and drive off. buck enters his cabin.}
<L>__{interior motel bedroom. bonnie and clyde. dusk.}
<A>__{clyde reaches her, and for a moment both stare with fanatic intensity at each other, bonnie trying desperately to keep a straight face. they are nose to nose, unblinking. clyde gives her a big raspberry, waggling his fingers in his ears like a kid. she laughs.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{i hate you all.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{i hate y'all, too.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{no, i really hate you.}
<A>__{she turns away from him, wilts onto the bed.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(eyes brimming)}
<D>__{oh, baby, i've got the blues so bad...}
<A>__{clyde moves behind her, begins to massage her back. there is something very delicate about the way he touches her; it suggests clyde's sensitivity to her mood rather than any degree of physical intimacy.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{bonnie?...is it your mama, what your mama said?}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{what mama?...she's just an old woman now...i have no mama...}
<A>__{bonnie rolls over on her back, stares up at clyde, tears splaying across her face from the move.}
<C>__{bonnie}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{...so funny...i thought when we first went out, we were really goin' somewhere...but this is it we're just goin', huh?}
<A>__{she has addressed this last directly to clyde, but there is nothing rhetorical about it it is a real question. clyde doesn't answer for a moment. then:}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{do you care about where we're goin'?}
<A>__{bonnie clearly finds this hard to say:}
<C>__{bonnie}
<D>__{not as long as you care about me.}
<C>__{clyde}
<P>__{(quite simply)}
<D>__{why i love you, sugar.}
<A>__{it's the first time he's said it to her, and bonnie is overwhelmed. she wraps her arms around clyde's middle, and snuggles into him, like a child. neither we nor clyde can see bonnie's face now, and her voice is muffled by his chest.}
<C>__{bonnie's voice}
<D>__{ enough to die with me, baby?... 'cause i think that's where we're goin'...i surely do.}
<A>__{clyde is both touched and amused by the plea. he strokes her head lightly. really meaning it.}
<C>__{clyde}
<D>__{ wherever.}
