<L>__{interior hallway night}
<A>__{in the hallway outside the spergazzi apartment, a group of giggling, drooling residents stand around a door. one of these residents is the superintendent, who is opening the door with one of his set of master keys. the residents, some of them women, giggle in anticipation. once the door has been opened, they all rush in, drooling and moaning. from inside the apartment we hear several muffled voices, at first angry and indignant, then pleading and terrified. screams and crashes follow.}
