<L>__{interior brown van morning}
<A>__{oooff!! the wind is knocked out of atwood when she lands left shoulder first on the furniture blankets, the man on top of her. the man is thorton meeks, the hangman, six feet, a solid two hundred pounds. he's also wearing tight leather gloves.}
<L>__{exterior street n morning}
<A>__{the brown van accelerates fast away from the curb.}
<L>__{interior brown van n morning}
<A>__{his body crushing hers, meeks kisses atwood's cheek.}
<C>__{meeks}
<D>__{surprise, surprise, tracy. i told you i was coming back to get you.}
<A>__{he frees his right hand and pulls his gun.}
<C>__{meeks}
<D>__{i already know where i'm gonna hang you. but first i'm gonna watch her...}
<P>__{(indicates the driver)}
<D>__{... have some fun with you, then she's gonna watch me have some fun with you.}
<A>__{he kisses her again and puts the gun to atwood's head.}
<C>__{meeks}
<D>__{now, don't move.}
<A>__{he raises up and straddles her.}
<C>__{meeks}
<D>__{you know the drill, i'm gonna put the cuffs on.}
<A>__{with his left hand he fishes a pair of handcuffs from a back pocket and snaps them on atwood's right wrist.}
<C>__{meeks}
<D>__{now the left.}
<A>__{he rolls atwood on her back and with the chain of the handcuff pulls her right arm toward her left. all meeks' talk has allowed atwood to catch her breath and suddenly she jerks her head up into the gun and screams at the top of her lungs.}
<C>__{detective atwood}
<D>__{shoot me!!!}
<A>__{at the same time she pulls hard against the handcuff with her right wrist. a startled meeks is thrown off balance. the gun comes away from atwood's head. her left arm now free, atwood swings her palm with all of her might into meeks' right ear. pop!! his eardrum breaks. aaaggh!! he instinctually reaches to cover the damaged ear with his gun hand. the driver doubles around to see what's happening. from outside, hoonnnkk!! the driver's attention returns to the road. atwood swings again. this time she snags the barrel of the gun and using it as a lever bends meeks' hand back on the wrist. blam! the gun goes off. neither one of them is hit. at the same time atwood pulls hard on the handcuff that meeks is holding in his left hand and twists into him. this dislodges meeks and he's off of her. snarling like animals they fight for the gun. crack! atwood's leverage breaks meeks' trigger finger. his grip loosens on the weapon. she pulls it out of his hand. a quick push skitters it across the floor. it drops through the open side door into the street. atwood rolls away and reaches for her ankle gun. now it's meeks' turn. a sharp tug on the chain of the handcuff stalls her motion. he flicks his other arm and a switchblade is delivered into his right hand. snap!! the blade comes out. atwood is reaching again for her ankle gun. she sees the flash of metal and flings her head back. luckily all she receives is a deep gash above her right eye. blood immediately begins to cascade over her brow. meeks grins and gives another sharp tug on the handcuff to pull atwood into the range of his knife. with one foot atwood kicks at him, with the other she pushes off and propels herself backward to grab a handful of the driver's hair. atwood's weight hinges the driver's head back until she's looking at the ceiling. her scream is equal parts pain and surprise.}
