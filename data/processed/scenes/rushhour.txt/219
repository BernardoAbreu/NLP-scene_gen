<L>__{interior north korean consulate surveillance room day}
<A>__{the tv's are off so they see none of bobbi's report. carson crosses to dave. he's at his computer, looking at a long column of telephone numbers.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{finally got the call list from javal's phone. most aren't his; they're from the legit user who didn't know his number was cloned.}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{go to the bottom of the list, work back through the last 12 hours.}
<A>__{dave jumps to the bottom, points at a number.}
<C>__{dave}
<D>__{here's the call to the consulate 965 5000.}
<P>__{(while scrolling)}
<D>__{the rest are dupes... all from the other guy...}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{wait... go back... the one at seven this morning...}
<A>__{dave highlights a number: 213 965 5666.}
<B>__{wider}
<A>__{carson glances over at the telephone on colonel lee's desk. (flashback) close on phone from when carson took a call there, pushing the mute button. (flashback) extreme close up on the label showing the phone's extension number: "x666."}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{across the room, colonel lee is watching carson intently. carson turns to look at him. they make eye contact. time stands still. realization. feeling like he's moving in slow motion, carson reaches for the sig 9mm in his shoulder holster. colonel lee grabs the amd 74 machine gun on the desk.}
<C>__{carson}
<D>__{get down!}
<A>__{colonel lee strafes the room and backs toward the door. the bullets trace a line across the room. one of the north korean espionage agents is hit. he slams against the console. carson tackles ambassador han and shoves him onto the floor, while popping off several rounds in colonel lee's direction. robbins also dives for cover, pushing walther down first. robbins takes a bullet in the shoulder. miranda is hit. the impact tumbles her over the desk.}
<C>__{carson}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{miranda!}
<A>__{colonel lee, still firing, slips out the door. gunsmoke hangs in the air as carson scrambles to miranda. several phones have begun ringing. no one notices them. dave never moved he sits hunched over, clutching his notebook computer, muttering the hail mary. carson rolls miranda over. she's got a large, scorched bullet hole in the front of her blouse. carson tears her blouse open. she's wearing a kelvar vest under it, and the slug is mushroomed against the vest. she awakens, gasps and starts swinging her fists at him. carson is overwhelmed with relief. then he notices robbins, bleeding profusely, propped against the wall next to walther. walther is dead shot in the head. os, we hear several spurts of machine gun fire, and a car engine roaring to life. miranda looks at carson...}

<D>__{go..!}
