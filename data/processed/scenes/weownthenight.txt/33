<A>__{bobby looks at vadim's ample waistline.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{he don't look like a middleweight no more.}
<A>__{everyone laughs, vadim most of all. he kisses bobby on the head. bobby looks at rosario as vadim continues:}
<C>__{vadim nezhinski}
<D>__{you know bobby, my uncle upstairs, he, he likes you a lot. practically thinks you're one of his kids.}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{your uncle's a great man. smart man.}
<C>__{vadim nezhinski}
<D>__{yeah... smart smart stupid. got his head buried in books all day, `stead of the real world...}
<A>__{ad lib amusement from the "yes" men. vadim moves closer:}

<C>__{vadim nezhinski}
<D>__{well, upstairs don't gotta know everything, am i right? place gets packed every night, everybody wins.}
<A>__{bobby does not respond, instead nodding to some patrons who shout out hellos. vadim shakes bobby's shoulder with affection. intimate:}
<C>__{vadim nezhinski }
<D>__{you know, you should think about comin' in with us. you're popular you could help us...expand a little. a lotta money in it.}

<B>__{the bar}
<A>__{as bobby moves with rosario to the bar:}
<C>__{rosario diaz}
<D>__{it go good upstairs, baby?}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{you gotta stop dealing. you hear what i'm telling you?}
<A>__{these words hit rosario, and we see that she's troubled by her own behavior because she stares at her shoes, momentarily speechless. he grabs her:}
<C>__{bobby green }
<D>__{you hear what i said?}
<C>__{rosario diaz}
<D>__{yeah, i heard. but i need the money right now, bobby. and i'm not gonna rely on you for everything }
<A>__{bobby purses his lips, frustrated. then:}
<C>__{bobby green}
<D>__{just hold off then, for a little while. okay? i got my reasons.}
<A>__{momentarily confused, she mutters a "'kay," then kisses him. bobby moves the hair from rosario's face.}
<C>__{rosario diaz}
<D>__{i love you...}
<A>__{bobby's about to respond in kind when... all of a sudden: boom! panic. screaming. lights. the doors at the club's entrance have burst open. loud, like a gunshot. cops enter. plainclothes and uniformed both. joseph comes in, holds up his badge, which hangs around his neck. with command:}
<C>__{joseph grusinsky}
<D>__{everybody! get your hands on your head and don't fuckin' move!}
<P>__{(to a woman)}
<D>__{turn off that music. right now!}
<A>__{four uniformed cops bolt straight to the coat check area. all kinds of drugs and weapons start falling to the floor. the patrons are desperate to get rid of any incriminating evidence, and both men and women run to the bathrooms.}
