<A>__{hours have passed. willy steps out of the front door, because he's going stir crazy inside. stands watching two techs walk the lawn and flower beds with metal detectors. he notices, past the s.i.d. vans and sheriff's dept. black and whites parked in the driveway: nunally, in his parked car, across the street. he meets willy's eyes. worried. willy can't give him any news. so he pretends he didn't see the question in nunally's eyes, looks away. takes a breath, turns and goes back in to work.}
