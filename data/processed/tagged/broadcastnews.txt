<A>__{aaron takes in jane, who is taking in jennifer and tom then aaron begins to sense a new dynamic in the room as ernie re enters and huddles briefly with paul... the news president is intent... the two of them walk over to tom and jennifer. we pick up just a few words:}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{this would be a good time to tap that source of yours. he could have an angle or something.}
<A>__{aaron's p.o.v. tom is startled but cool nods his head jennifer is amazed looking at tom with new and even prettier eyes... paul and ernie now move toward jane, a whole flow of movement creating a new energy in the area. jane sheds her afghan as she rises to meet them.}
<C>__{ernie}
<P>__{(to jane)}
<D>__{we want you to exec produce a special report...}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{what?}

<D>__{let's figure out the field.}
<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{unfortunately, since paul's here, he's made out the assignments... jennifer at the white house... george at the pentagon...martin at state...and we need an anchor since rorish is in his boat, so we're gonna do the whole report this afternoon from here...with tom.}

<C>__{ernie}
<D>__{jane, if you want to, go ahead. i don't disagree with you.}
<A>__{jane moves quickly off, awed at the prospect of taking on the big boss.}
<B>__{on jane}

<D>__{hello, buddy. it's 1:35 and this is tom. you can reach me at the office. it's important. i can use a little help.}
<A>__{jane, because of the proximity to tom is speaking in whispered intensity.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{tom isn't ready for the job you're about to hand him. not near ready. not by the longest shot. aaron's spent six weeks in tripoli, he's interviewed gaddafi he reported on the eight one story. i think he's essential to do the job we're capable of and i think it's my responsibility to tell you that.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{okay, that's your opinion. i don't agree.}

<D>__{and the most important thing make sure his earpiece works, have back ups ready. that's never been more vital. he must be able to hear me at every second and clearly.}

<A>__{jane mounts some steps in the control room she moves past the director and technical crew up to the next level where the two news execs, ernie and paul stand with their backs to the wall, and then up one more step slightly above the desk and table occupied by blair. now she slips into the large well paddled throne like seat as we begin music cue. literally at her fingertips is the row of buttons which provide immediate access to the field reporters at the pentagon, state and the white house. in front of her the bank of monitors, the technical team and past them the studio where tom is seated at anchor, a floor producer and writer feeding him copy.}
<B>__{angle favoring blair}

<D>__{executive producer wow.}
<A>__{jane looks at her and, in a moment of atypical merriment, does a choking gesture at her own throat as the monitors flash a graphic reading: special report... we hear an announcer's voice say, "this is a special report from..." insert: jane's control panel each of four buttons labeled so that the microphone can connect her to tom and the field reporters. she presses the button marked "tom."}

<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{it just might not work for me because of our different approaches.}
<A>__{tom nods and gestures that he proceed. aaron begins reading the news. barely a sentence in, he is interrupted.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{wait.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{your coat jacket is rising up in back.}
<A>__{aaron ignores the tip.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{when you sit down sit on your jacket a little that gives you a good line. look at yourself in the monitor.}
<A>__{aaron looks but is unimpressed and resumes reading the news. tom, not about to be ignored when he knows it's important, moves behind aaron and begins to force his jacket down.}
<C>__{aaron}
<P>__{(very uncomfortable)}
<D>__{i don't like being handled.}

<D>__{it's not loaded.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i will find some copy. be right back.}
<A>__{tom exits aaron looking after him, clearly taken with the genuine camaraderie... the unmistakable joy tom derives from helping out. several beats and tom comes back with a cameraman in tow.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i got copy, i got ellen to heat up the camera and i got master control taping so you can study it later.}
<A>__{he puts the roll of copy in the prompter.}

<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{i'm very appreciative.}

<D>__{no. no.}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{no?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{don't let your eyes go from the beginning of the sentence to the end like that. you don't want to look shifty, do you?}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{oh, god, no!}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{and the left side of your face is the good one. go again. and try to punch one word or phrase in every sentence punch one idea a story. punch come on }

<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{the pointers were great. i will study the tape.}
<A>__{tom is into helping aaron he finds himself delivering a locker room pep talk:}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{and remember you're not just reading the news or narrating. everybody has to sell a little. you're selling them this idea of you. you know, what you're sort of saying is, 'trust me. i'm, uh, credible.' so whenever you catch yourself just reading...stop and start selling a little. so long.}

<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{i spilled some rum on the outfit you picked out. let me show you the alternates.}

<P>__{(the clasp in place)}
<D>__{thanks. try this one.}
<A>__{she hands him the tie and he extracts his grey jacket from a bag puts it on and ties the tie... she reaches into a white paper bag full of fresh purchases and takes out a vial of perfume with a built in atomizer and sprays the air in front of hr and walks into the mist. on aaron's reaction:}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i read about it that's how you can make sure you don't put on too much perfume...}
<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{could you at least pretend that this is an awkward situation for you me showing up while you're getting ready for a date.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(flaring)}

<D>__{okay, that will do it. you okay?}
<A>__{the tape is rocky now the sound woman and cameraman continue to roll as they move towards their next shot at times the camera pointing towards the carpet but the sound continues. the crew chatting mentioning that the tape is still rolling.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{that's enough. that's enough.}
<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}

<C>__{young woman}
<D>__{uh huh.}
<C>__{tom}

<D>__{tom}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{soundwoman's voice}
<D>__{it kills me we didn't have a second camera. it was so powerful seeing your reaction.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{young woman's voice}
<D>__{yes, it is.}
<C>__{sound woman's voice}
<D>__{for a second there, i thought you were gonna cry yourself. that would have been something.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(considering, then)}
<D>__{then give me a minute...}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(fully realizing)}
<D>__{you fucking...}
<A>__{as jane watches we see tom work up the tears we saw in the evening news piece as he does so:}
<C>__{young woman's voice}
<D>__{oh, that's amazing.}
<A>__{on jane's shocked reaction:}
<L>__{exterior bwi airport day}
<A>__{jane's cab pulls up to the curb. she gets out she is carrying no luggage. she sees tom who hurriedly walks up to her. jane is fighting to maintain a calm.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{look who's the organized one. i've got everything.}
<A>__{he briefly opens a paper gift shop bag he is holding and shows her he has bought them each a bathing suit.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i'm not going.}
<A>__{he looks at her with anticipatory distaste evident on his face.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i saw the taped outtakes of the interview with the girl. i know you 'acted' your reaction after the interview.}
<A>__{tom half turns from her and moves back toward the bench. jane close behind, stalking him.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i felt funny about it afterwards. it's verboten, huh? i thought since i did it for real the first time but i get you. that's not the reason you're not coming?}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(raising her voice)}
<D>__{of course it's the reason. it's terrible what you did.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{we disagree on how god awful it was. why don't you come with me and we can disagree and get a tan at the same time?}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(livid)}
<D>__{jesus, if you're glib about this i'm going to lose it. i was up all night and...}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(calmly)}
<D>__{jane, jane, jane, jane, jane...}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{it made me ill. you could get fired for things like that.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i got promoted for things like that.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{working up tears for a new piece cutaway...you totally crossed the line between...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{it's hard not to cross it; they keep moving the little sucker, don't they?}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(distaste)}
<D>__{it just proves that the difference we have are...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{this is a one way argument. we've got six days; if you go and we fight and we hate it we'll come home. if you don't go? well, that's a much bigger deal. i go to london right after that. so, it'd be very big deal if you stay here. the plane's boarding. you're good at deadline. here's your ticket.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(taking ticket)}
<D>__{it's amazing. you commit this incredible breach of ethics and you act as if i'm nitpicking. try and get this. when you edited that...}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(deliberately)}
<D>__{i'm leaving now. gate 43.}
<A>__{he simply turns and walks away looking back once as jane stands there mucked up by his sudden departure the lack of resolution to their confrontation is palpable.}
<L>__{interior terminal day}
<A>__{on tom moving past the metal detector. he too is frustrated pissed off at her.}
<L>__{interior other terminal area}
<A>__{jane moving quickly along towards the metal detectors.}
<L>__{interior metal detector}
<A>__{as jane passes through and sets off the buzzer. she stands there the heel of her hand pressed to her brow trying to stem the tears. as others look on, she takes a huge key ring from her pocket deposits it in the box walks through without a buzzer and moves on.}

<A>__{tom waiting while in the b.g. "people eater" busses ferry passengers to the plane. as one full "people eater" pulls away and another empty one arrives.}
<C>__{ticket agent}
<P>__{(to tom)}
<D>__{this is the last one.}
<A>__{others start to board. he sees jane moving towards him. he walks to her, she gestures back towards the street.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{that's not going to be the way we say good bye. even though i think what you did was rotten it's not all impersonal. you mean something to me.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{you keep coming after me and looking down on me. it's starting to make me batty.}
<A>__{she looks at him.}
<C>__{tom }
<D>__{i can't help it that they like me. and i like that they like me. and i think there's a lot of this job that i do well. what do you think it takes to do this job the way they have it now?}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i don't wan to discuss work.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{well, let's do a special report on that...i mean that's news.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{i knew what you meant.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{what i don't know, i can learn and what i know, nobody can teach. excuse me for saying it about myself, but i think it's true.}
<P>__{(old habit)}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<P>__{(catching himself)}
<D>__{never mind what you think.}

<C>__{jane}
<D>__{it's okay.}
<C>__{ticket agent}
<D>__{sir?}
<A>__{the pressure begins to bend jane's resolve.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{so you have an extra bathing suit, huh?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(wary but hopeful)}
<D>__{you want to come?}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(totally open)}
<D>__{it's just that one of the few things i'm not confused about is what i was saying downstairs, that...}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(giving up sadly, finally)}
<D>__{then you should stay here.}
<C>__{jane}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{it's better when you let me say it.}
<A>__{he hugs her. now that it's over, they can each openly care for each other. while in the embrace:}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{take it easy.}
<C>__{jane}
<D>__{why did i have to do this to myself? watch you take off.}
<P>__{(then)}

<A>__{he kisses her lightly looking at her... then heartfelt:}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{oh, honey.}

<D>__{...go any way you want.}

<L>__{exterior convention center day}
<A>__{much the same place where jane and tom first met. the words "seven yeas later" appears on the screen. a sign off to one side tells us it's the annual meeting of the local television broadcasters... and that at 2 p.m. tom grunick will be speaking on "responsibilities of broadcast journalism for the '90s."}
<L>__{interior auditorium day}
<A>__{much the same audience, though two members of the audience may strike particular interest curly haired man seen from behind holding a similarly curly haired five year old. tom is in mid speech.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{... when they told me bill had decided to retire and offered me the evening news, i thought it was the same kind of joke we used to pull back at the station turning off somebody's prompter in the middle of a show.}
<A>__{some good natured laughter.}
<C>__{tom }
<D>__{and then when they heard my reaction they thought i was kidding. i told them i'd be their anchor but i didn't want to be the managing editor that there were people better qualified than i to control the content and if there weren't we were all in trouble.}
<A>__{the audience really enjoys this: same scene some minutes later}
<B>__{moving shot...}
<A>__{the anchor teams leaning forward. they love this man, a humble specialist refusing the generalist trap. imagine the feeling you see, on the top of the mountain, a man not unlike yourself.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{and now to something more important... i'd like to introduce my bride.}

<C>__{aaron}
<D>__{well my wife got this new job...}
