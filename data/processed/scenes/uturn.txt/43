<L>__{exterior street day}
<A>__{bobby, depressed, is heading towards harlin's gas station, passing jenny sitting on a corner drinking a soda, almost as if waiting for him. she runs to him, and follows him, as somewhere a police radio crackles and buzzes.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{hey mister. mister, i just... i just wanted to thank you.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{for defending my honor this afternoon.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i hate to bust your bubble honey, but i wasn't defending you.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{but you was going to fight for me.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i wasn't going to fight for you. i was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{he's not my boyfriend. i mean, i let him take me out and stuff, but i ain't spoken for. not yet that is.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{get it through your head, little girl; i'm not going for you. if this toby likes you, then if i were you i'd marry him. you're not going to get much better in this town.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{that's what i thought until you came riding in. i saw your car over at the gas station. it's a cool car. want to take me for a ride? desert's kind of lonely this time of day.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{how old are you?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{eighteen... well, i'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{no, i don't want to take you for a ride. what i want is for ... hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you?}
<A>__{from off camera we hear toby.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{mister!}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{oh, shit!}
<A>__{toby moves menacingly up the street towards bobby.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{that's right, mister. you better be afraid. i told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen. now i find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i wasn't sneaking around with your girl. would you please tell him?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you're too late, toby. we're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{what the hell are you talking about?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{what's your name anyway?}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{oh, that tears it, mister. i'm gonna bust you up but good. i'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around. that's what i'm gonna do. you don't know what you're dealing with, mister. i'm crazy. i'm psycho crazy.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{yeah, i know. you're tnt. just like dynamite. when you go off somebody gets hurt. (at his wit's end) all right. let's do this.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{toby tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and i'm gonna have his love child.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{will you shut up!}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{you gonna pay for that, mister.}
<A>__{toby and bobby square off, sizing each other up and preparing for a violent confrontation. just as the two are about to clash we hear the voice of sheriff potter from off camera.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{toby!}
<A>__{the two men freeze in their tracks, as potter drives up fast.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{hey, sheriff potter.}
<C>__{sheriff }
<D>__{toby, i just came from your mother's place. she's worried sick about you. she says she ain't seen you since this morning.}
<C>__{toby}
<D>__{that ain't true, sheriff. i was home for lunch.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{boy, i'm not trying to hear nothing from you except that you're heading home. now run along.}

<D>__{yes, sir. come on, jenny.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i want to stay.}
<C>__{toby}

<A>__{toby grabs jenny by the wrist and literally pulls he along. as she goes she yells back to bobby.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{bye, mister. don't go nowhere without me. i wanna have your love child.}
<A>__{toby points a vicious finger at bobby.}
<C>__{toby}

<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{that's a nasty cut you got there.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{yeah, fell down and hit a rock. not as bad as it looks.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{there was a young fellow over at jamilla's today when it got hit. way she tells it he got whacked around good by one of the robbers.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{sounds like it. i wish i could help sheriff, but i just want to get my car and get on up the road.}
<A>__{jake drives up in his gold caddy. his windows whirr down.}
<C>__{jake}

<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{peculiar, how things happen. a man's car breaks down. there's a hold up. people die and all that money and now old jake out looking for his young wife. and then you show up...}
<A>__{the sheriff looks right through bobby, who knows this is more than a conversation. he pulls up to harlin's garage. bobby gets out.}
<C>__{sheriff}
<D>__{time's running out, son. i will be seeing you in the morning...}
<A>__{with this thinly veiled threat, the sheriff drives on. as bobby watches, feeling the pressure to get out now while he can.}
