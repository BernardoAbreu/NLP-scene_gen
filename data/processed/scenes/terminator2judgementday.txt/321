<A>__{swat leader moves cautiously through the lab. cat stepping, he circles around a desk which block dyson's body from his view. his m 16 is leveled crisply. we look over his shoulder as he rounds the desk, revealing miles dyson is not dead. he will be very soon, but at this moment he is conscious. he has propped himself up against the desk, and holds a book in one hand. a heavy technical manual. below the book is the detonator, upright on the tile floor. the message is clear. "shoot me, the book drops on the plunger. adios." dyson wheezes, trying to draw enough breath to talk.}

<A>__{swat leader seems to see the wires, the claymores, the gas cans all around him for the first time. his eyes, visible through his gas mask, go very wide. he spins and motions his squad back.}
