<T>__{in front of the tent:}
<C>__{casy}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i dunno. listen.}
<A>__{there are night sounds but little else to be distinguished.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{can't tell if you hear it or not. you hear it, tom?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{i hear it. i think they's some guys comin' this way, lots of 'em. we better get outa here.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{down that way under the bridge span.}
<A>__{casy leads the way softly. the bridge span is seen from the stream as casy, tom, and the other man wade carefully toward it. under the bridge it is almost black as they creep through the culvert. just as casy and tom step out from under the bridge on the other side, a blinding flashlight hits them, lighting them like day.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{there they are! stand where you are!}
<A>__{halted, uncertain, they stand as three men with stars on their coats and pickhandles in their hands slide down the embankment. two of them hold lighted flashlights.}
<C>__{deputy}
<D>__{that's him! that one in the middle, the skinny one! chuck! alec! here they are! we got 'em!}
<A>__{there are faint responses from a distance. casy and tom are alone. the others have fled. the deputies approach, their lights on casy and tom.}
<C>__{casy}
<D>__{listen, you fellas. you don't know what you're doin'. you're helpin' to stave kids.}
<C>__{deputy}
<D>__{shut up, you red }
<A>__{he swings the pickhandle. casy dodges but the stick cracks his skull. he falls face down out of the light. the deputies watch for a moment but casy doesn't stir.}
<C>__{second deputy}
<D>__{looks like to me you killed him.}
<C>__{deputy}
<D>__{turn him over. put the light on him.}
<A>__{bending over, their bodies hide casy. tom, seen close, is breathing hard, his eyes glistening.}
<C>__{deputy's voice}
<D>__{serves him right, too.}
<A>__{as the deputies straighten up, tom steps forward, grabs the pickhandle from the man who felled casy, and swings. the blow strikes the deputy's arm, sending his flashlight flying, and the scene is in semi darkness as tom swings again. there is a grunt and a groan as the deputy goes down. then all is confusion. backing away, swinging the pickhandle, tom bolts, splashes a few yards through the stream, turns and gains a better start by throwing the pickhandle at his pursuers. they duck, and tom disappears into the night. the other men rush through the scene in pursuit. the second deputy is seen bending over the body of the man tom laid out.}
<C>__{second deputy}
<D>__{where's that flash?}
<C>__{third deputy}
<D>__{here.}
<A>__{the light flashes on the man's face.}
<C>__{third deputy}
<P>__{(awed)}
<D>__{boy, he's good and dead! you see that fella that done it?}
<C>__{second deputy}
<D>__{i ain't sure but i caught him one across the face, and believe me, i give him a trade mark he ain't gonna be able to shake off easy!}
<A>__{tom is seen crashing through the bushes, his face bloody. the scene fades out. the exterior of house 63 fades in. it is day. ma comes down the street with a bundle under her arm and enters the house. inside house 63, rosasharn sits by the window as ma enters.}
<C>__{ma}
<D>__{anybody ask anything?}
<C>__{rosasharn}
<D>__{no'm.}
<C>__{ma}
<D>__{stand by the door.}
<A>__{rosasharn takes her post at the door as ma kneels on the floor beside tom, puts down the rag bundle, and gets a basin. tom, who is under a quilt, is with his back alone visible. she speaks softly, guardedly, as she bathes his face.}
<C>__{ma}
<D>__{how's it feel, tommy?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{busted my cheek but i can still see. what'd you hear?}
<C>__{ma}
<D>__{looks like you done it.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(soberly)}
<D>__{i kinda thought so. felt like it.}
<C>__{ma}
<D>__{folks ain't talkin' about much else. they say they got posses out. talkin' about a lynchin' when they catch the fella.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{they killed casy first.}
<C>__{ma}
<D>__{that ain't the way they're tellin' it. they're sayin' you done it fust.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{they know what this fella looks like?}
<C>__{ma}
<D>__{they know he got hit in the face.}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{i'm sorry, ma. but i didn't know what i was doin', no more'n when you take a breath. i didn't even know i was gonna do it.}
<C>__{ma}
<D>__{it's awright, tommy. i wisht you didn't do it, but you done what you had to do. i can't read no fault in you.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i'm gonna go away tonight. i can't go puttin' this on you folks.}
<C>__{ma}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{tom! they's a whole lot i don't understan', but goin' away ain't gonna ease us.}
<P>__{(thoughtfully)}
<D>__{they was the time when we was on the lan'. they was a bound'ry to us then. ol' folks died off, an' little fellas come, an' we was always one thing we was the fambly kinda whole an' clear. but now we ain't clear no more. they ain't nothin' keeps us clear. al he's a hankerin' an' a jibbitin' to go off on his own. an' uncle john is just a draggin' along. pa's lost his place he ain't the head no more. we're crackin' up, tom. they ain't no fambly now. rosasharn }

<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(tiredly)}
<D>__{okay, ma. i shouldn't, though. i know i shouldn't. but okay.}
<C>__{rosasharn}
<D>__{here come a lot of people.}
<A>__{tom puts his head under the quilt. ma turns, faces the door, her body protectively between tom and whatever threatens.}
<C>__{bookkeeper's voice}
<D>__{how many of you?}
<C>__{migrant's voice}
<D>__{ten of us. whatcha payin'?}
<A>__{outside house 63, the bookkeeper has encountered the newcomers.}
<C>__{bookkeeper}
<D>__{house 25. number's on the door.}

<D>__{okay, mister. whatcha payin'?}
<C>__{bookkeeper}
<D>__{two and a half cents.}
<C>__{migrant}
<P>__{(angrily)}
<D>__{two an' a half! say, mister, a man can't make his dinner on that.}
<C>__{bookkeeper}
<D>__{take it or leave it. there's 200 men coming from the south that'll be glad to get it.}
<C>__{migrant}
<D>__{but but how we gonna eat?}
<C>__{bookkeeper}
<D>__{look, i didn't set the price. i'm just working here. if you want it, take it. if you don't, turn right around and beat it.}
<C>__{migrant}
<P>__{(sullenly)}
<D>__{which way is house 25?}
<C>__{tom}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{that casy. he might a been a preacher, but he seen a lot a things clear. he was like a lantern he helped mw see things too.}
<C>__{ma}
<D>__{comes night we'll get outa here.}
<A>__{at night, the truck is backed up to the door of house 63; it is already loaded. ma is speaking in a low voice to tom, who is peering out from under a mattress in the truck.}
<C>__{ma}
<D>__{it's jus' till we get some distance. then you can come out.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i'd hate to get trapped in here.}
<C>__{guard's voice}
<D>__{what's goin' on here?}
<A>__{tom disappears. ma turns, her back to the truck. the guard plays his flashlight on the joads, who stand watching him ominously.}
<C>__{pa}
<D>__{we're goin' out.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{ma}
<D>__{we got a job offered good job.}

<P>__{truck)}
<D>__{wasn't there another fella with you?}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{you mean that hitch hiker? little short fella with a pale face?}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{i guess that's what he looked like.}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{we just picked him up on the way in. he went away this mornin' when the rate dropped.}
<C>__{guard}
<P>__{(thinking hard)}
<D>__{what'd he look like again?}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{short fella. pale face.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{was he bruised up this mornin'? about the face?}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{i didn't see nothin'.}
<C>__{guard}
<P>__{(reluctantly)}
<D>__{okay. go on.}
<A>__{quickly, al is in the driver's seat, with ma and pa beside him. the truck rattles into motion and moves down the street. at the gates to the ranch another guard flashes a light as al stops the car.}
<C>__{second guard}
<D>__{goin' out for good?}
<C>__{al}
<D>__{yeah. goin' north. got a job.}
<C>__{second guard}
<D>__{okay.}
<A>__{he opens the gate and the truck goes through. it turns from the gravel road onto the paved highway.}
