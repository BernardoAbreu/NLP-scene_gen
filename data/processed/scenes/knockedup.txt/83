<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{the box was empty?}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{he can't afford a ring. knocked up 74.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{so he got down on one knee and gave you an empty box?}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{get over it. if you'd been there, you would have cried.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{you need to train him. oprah said that when two people meet they should point out each other's differences and flaws.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{i thought you should love people for who they are.}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{you criticize them a lot, so they get so down on themselves they have to change.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{you don't think that's naggy?}

<C>__{alison}
<D>__{why do you say that?}
<C>__{debbie}
<D>__{i think he's cheating on me. he's always going to business meetings at odd hours. then i try to call him on his cell phone and he says he's in bad cell phone reception areas when he's in good reception areas.}
<C>__{alison}
<D>__{maybe he's working late. maybe he's trying to sign a new band. i can't imagine pete doing that.}
<C>__{debbie}
