<L>__{interior the centre of hell}
<A>__{larry, kirsty and tiffany come running toward the camera. initially oblivious to the fact that the corridor they were running along has widened and the walls retreated. suddenly, they come to a stunned halt together, staring ahead of them with awestruck faces.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{oh. my. god.}
<A>__{the camera moves around them to take in what they see. they are of course in the central chamber of leviathan. leviathan is spinning again, the black beams flying around the chamber. tiffany screams. kirsty grabs her.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{tiffany, listen. you've solved it. but we've got to solve it the other way. see? see? we've got to get out.}
<A>__{tiffany is frozen.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{come on!}
<A>__{leviathan spins, the beams fly.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{please! tiffany, please! get us out! take us home, please!}
<A>__{tiffany nods. they are just about to leave when leviathan stops spinning. a large beam flies down , carrying an object which lands on the catwalk before the humans, who all take a step or two backwards. the beam withdraws. the object at first resembles a large and bloody plastic bag, but then internal movement begins to rip at this covering. hands appear out of the rips and complete the removal. we realise that the bag like thing was a kind of caul, a membranous after birth that some creatures produce their young in. the thing inside completes its escape and stands clear of the shredded caul. like a new born child, it is stained and soiled with amiotic fluids and blood. but it is not a new born child. it is a new cenobite. and it used to be malahide. the transformation we caught glimpses of is now complete. its skin is entirely blue, its head entirely bald. the decorative wounds and tortures we saw being applied are all present; its flesh is peeled back in various places, its features are threaded and distorted by, wire, its eyelids are stapled open. for a second it stands and regards the humans before it. tiffany gasps in recognition. kirsty too knows what it was.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{malahide ...}
<A>__{for some reason, kirsty draws from her pocket the photo she took from the obsession room. she stares at it.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{jesus christ! of course ...}
<A>__{the malahide cenobite stretches its arms and flexes its fingers.}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{and to think i hesitated ...}
<A>__{it looks at the humans again, its gaze finally settling on the still shocked tiffany.}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{tiffany. come. i have a whole new world of puzzles for you to enjoy ...}
<A>__{it reaches out its hand to her.}
<C>__{malahide}
<D>__{a whole new world of pleasures for you to endure.}
<A>__{tiffany, confused and used to obeying her doctor's voice, tentatively stretches out her arm to meet the malahide cenobite's. larry suddenly walks between tiffany and malahide. the expression on his face is strange; it is not fear, nor defiance. it is simpler than that. he is really, really pissed off.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{no. i've had enough of this shit. who the hell are you?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{it's ...}
<A>__{larry waves a hand at her, but keeps his eyes on}
<B>__{malahide.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{never mind. never mind.}
<A>__{he points a finger at malahide's face, which is attempting a version of pinhead's imposing glacial stars, but frankly, isn't quite making it.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{fuck you and the horse you rode in on.}
<A>__{suddenly, he forms a fist with his unwounded arm and smashes it straight into malahide's face. malahide is completely decked. larry grabs tiffany by the shoulders and speaks urgently to her.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{o.k. you've done it before. you can do it again. get us out of here!}
<A>__{the three of them run back up the catwalk. leviathan spins wildly and a myriad of black beams flow from it. as they shine into the catwalk they become limbs like those that captured malahide, but all with different tips; some are organic, vicious mouths, some are hooks or blades, some are faces, some are (as if leviathan is too angry to be thinking straight) beautiful flowers. the limbs fly up the catwalk, but the humans have gained too great a start. the limbs retract rapidly into the black lights. malahide staggers to his feet, just as leviathan re directs its energy into forming and projecting one much fatter limb. it is dirty pink and segmented, like a vast earthworm. the end peels back as it flies toward malahide, revealing a cruel, metallic, and rapidly spinning surgical saw. just as malahide stands up straight, the limb smashes into the back of his skull. there is a distressing whirring noise as the limb seals itself fleshily to malahide's skull and the former surgeon twitches and dances in horrible involuntary movements as leviathan takes over what little mind remains.}
