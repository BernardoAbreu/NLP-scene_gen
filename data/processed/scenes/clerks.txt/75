<C>__{randal}
<D>__{i heard you apologize. why? you have every right in the world to be mad.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{that seems to be the leitmotif in your life; ever backing down.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i don't back down.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{yes, you do. you always back down. you assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{you know what pisses me off the most?}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{the fact that i'm right about your buckling?}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i'm going to miss the game.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{because you buckled.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{would you shut the hell up with that shit? it's not helping.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{don't yell at me, pal.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{randal}
<D>__{see? there you go again.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{i can't believe i'm going to miss the game!}

<D>__{at least we're stuck here together.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{you've got a customer.}
<A>__{randal walks away.}
<C>__{randal }
<D>__{what? what do you want?!}
<A>__{dante shakes his head in frustration and picks up the phone again.}
<C>__{dante}
<D>__{sanford? dante...i can't play today...i'm stuck at work...i know i'm not scheduled, but just forget it. i can't play...neither can randal...he's working too...}
<A>__{randal comes back. dante rolls his eyes to the ceiling.}
<C>__{dante}
<P>__{(getting an idea)}
<D>__{wait a second. do we have to play at the park?...hold on...}
