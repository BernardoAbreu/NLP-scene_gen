<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{int vatican archives night}
<A>__{close on the bernini ledger, which langdon is now almost halfway through. he tiyrns a page, scans the list of items written there, then moves on to the nexterior he blinks, his vision blurring again. he looks over at chartrand, who's suffering even worse, panting for air, hands on his knees.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{you don't smoke, do you?}
<C>__{chartrand}
<P>__{(yes, a lot)}
<D>__{a little bit.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{sit down before you fall down.}
<A>__{chartrand half stumbles into a chair on the opposite side of the table. langdon goes back to what he was doing, flipping a page and then immediately flipping it back. there is a hand written notation alongside one of the entries.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{my italian's no good, what does this note say? next to the entry for the ecstasy of st. teresa?}
<A>__{chartrand leans over the ledger, squinting hard, trying to focus.}
<C>__{chartrand}
<D>__{"moved at suggestion of the artist."}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{moved to another church? at bernini"s suggestion?}
<A>__{chartrand, really suffering for air, can't follow it.}
<C>__{chartrand}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<A>__{langdon flips the page back, to a photograph of the sculpture in question.}
<B>__{the statue}
<A>__{is of a woman, seemingly in the throes of ecstasy, while an angel hovering over her holds a spear aloft. langdon raises an eyebrow. the word "seraphim" jumps up from the page, words in quotes after it "seraphim, meaning 'the fiery one...'"}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{fire.}
<A>__{more words pop out at us "his great golden spear... filled with fire..."}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{fire.}
<A>__{still more "woman inflamed by passion's fire..." and now a close up of her enraptured face.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{fire.}
<A>__{and now three things happen in quick succession: langdon slams the ledger shut, the ribbons on the air vent fall as the oxygen into the vault is cut off, and one by one, all the lights in the archives go out. total silence for a moment. langdon and chartrand look at each other in the darkness.}
<C>__{langdon }
<D>__{the door ?}
<C>__{chartrand}
<D>__{electronic.}
<C>__{langdon}
<D>__{that's too bad.}
