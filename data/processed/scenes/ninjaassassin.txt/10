<D>__{it's a pattern, like the currents of the ocean.}
<L>__{interior europol office hallway day}
<A>__{close on a mound of bank records; rivers of numbers cascading neatly down perforated spread sheets.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{some people see money as the root of all evil, but to me it looks like a fingerprinterior whether we're talking about 19th century korea, or 21st century iraq, the game is the same. if you want to understand why certain things are happening, you have to understand the flow of money.}

<D>__{you're excited, mika. you know i get nervous when you're excited.}
<A>__{he would never admit it, but he enjoys watching her work, almost as much as he likes poking her about it.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{you remember the eulmi incident?}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{korean queen, late eighteen hundred's. according to you, she was off'd by one of these ninja clans.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{ozunu. i think. i've been going through some of the original transcripts of the trial of kunitomo shigeaki. the prosecutor questioned him about a payment of 100 pounds of gold. shigeaki answered that he didn't know what the prosecutor was talking about. the question was never brought up again. but what pinged for me was the amount the exact same amount rumored to be paid to the hattori clan for the assassination of lord sanda.}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{so you start to wonder, in this ever changing world, if the cost of a man's life has remained constant.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{exactly. i figure these clans are like a thousand years old. they probably don't change a lot.}
<A>__{she begins flipping through huge reams of bank records.}
<C>__{mika }
<D>__{i started looking at international wire transfers, targeting banks in the regions of several high profile assassinations and bingo }
<A>__{the proverbial needle in a haystack; a single wire transfer circled in red.}
<C>__{mika }
<D>__{minister zhang. the day before the assassination $1,555,999.90 was transferred from the bank of shanghai. the exact market value of one hundred pounds of gold.}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{highly circumstantial.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{i thought you might say that so i checked how often this particular bank transferred that market equivalent to a hundred pounds of gold in the last three years.}

<C>__{mika}
<D>__{not once.}
<A>__{he sifts through the report.}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{okay you got me. this is interesting.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{the clans are real, ryan. they steal children and turn them into assassins. they've been doing it for years and nobody's doing a damn thing to stop them.}
<C>__{maslow}
<D>__{look, no one's denying the historical record, mika. but the whole idea just doesn't fit in with a modern world. it's like one of those questions on an iq test: which of these doesn't belong in this sentence: laptops, space shuttles, nanotechnology, ninjas.}
<C>__{mika}
<D>__{they're real ryan. you can call them spooks, or assassins, or whatever you want if it makes you feel better, but they're out there. they're killing people and nobody is doing a damn thing to stop them.}
