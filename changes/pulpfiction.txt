<LOC>__{INT. COFFEE SHOP  MORNING}
<ACTION>__{A normal Denny's, Spires-like coffee shop in Los Angeles. It's about 9:00 in the morning. While the place isn't jammed, there's a healthy number of people drinking coffee, munching on bacon and eating eggs. Two of these people are a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN. The Young Man has a slight working-class English accent and, like his fellow countryman, smokes cigarettes like they're going out of style. It is impossible to tell where the Young Woman is from or how old she is; everything she does contradicts something she did. The boy and girl sit in a booth. Their dialogue is to be said in a rapid pace "HIS GIRL FRIDAY" fashion.}

<DIAL>__{No, forget it, it's too risky. I'm through doin' that shit.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I know that's what I always say. I'm always right too, but}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{but you forget about it in a day or two -}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{yeah, well, the days of me forgittin' are over, and the days of me rememberin' have just begun.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<DIAL>__{Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack...}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Well take heart, 'cause you're never gonna hafta hear it again. Because since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna hafta hear me quack about how I'm never gonna do it again.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{After tonight.}
<ACTION>__{The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in there, back and forth.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(with a smile)}
<DIAL>__{Correct. I got all tonight to quack.}

<CHAR>__{YOUNG WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Oh yes, thank you.}

<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm doin' fine.}
<ACTION>__{The Waitress leaves. The Young Man takes a drag off of his smoke. The Young Woman pours a ton of cream and sugar into her coffee. The Young Man goes right back into it.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I mean the way it is now, you're takin' the same fuckin' risk as when you rob a bank. You take more of a risk. Banks are easier!  Federal banks aren't supposed to stop you anyway, during a robbery. They're insured, why should they care? You don't even need a gun in a federal bank. I heard about this guy, walked into a federal bank with a portable phone, handed the phone to the teller, the guy on the other end of the phone said: "We got this guy's little girl, and if you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill 'er."}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Did it work?}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Fuckin' A it worked, that's what I'm talkin' about! Knucklehead walks in a bank with a telephone, not a pistol, not a shotgun, but a fuckin' phone, cleans the place out, and they don't lift a fuckin' finger.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Did they hurt the little girl?}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't know. There probably never was a little girl  the point of the story isn't the little girl. The point of the story is they robbed the bank with a telephone.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{You wanna rob banks?}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm not sayin' I wanna rob banks, I'm just illustrating that if we did, it would be easier than what we been doin'.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{So you don't want to be a bank robber?}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Naw, all those guys are goin' down the same road, either dead or servin' twenty.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{And no more liquor stores?}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What have we been talking about? Yeah, no more-liquor-stores. Besides, it ain't the giggle it usta be. Too many foreigners own liquor stores. Vietnamese, Koreans, they can't fuckin' speak English. You tell 'em: "Empty out the register," and they don't know what it fuckin' means. They make it too personal. We keep on, one of those gook motherfuckers' gonna make us kill 'em.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I'm not gonna kill anybody.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{I don't wanna kill anybody either. But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us of them. And if it's not the gooks, it these old Jews who've owned the store for fifteen fuckin' generations. Ya got Grandpa Irving sittin' behind the counter with a fuckin' Magnum. Try walkin' into one of those stores with nothin' but a telephone, see how far it gets you. Fuck it, forget it, we're out of it.}

<CHAR>__{YOUNG WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Here? It's a coffee shop.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{What's wrong with that? People never rob restaurants, why not? Bars, liquor stores, gas stations, you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them. Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down. They're not expecting to get robbed, or not as expecting.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL_PAR>__{(taking to idea)}
<DIAL>__{I bet in places like this you could cut down on the hero factor.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Correct. Just like banks, these places are insured. The managers don't give a fuck, they're just tryin' to get ya out the door before you start pluggin' diners.  Waitresses, forget it, they ain't takin' a bullet for the register. Busboys, some wetback gettin' paid a dollar fifty a hour gonna really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner. Customers are sittin' there with food in their mouths, they don't know what's goin' on. One minute they're havin' a Denver omelet, next minute somebody's stickin' a gun in their face.}
<ACTION>__{The Young Woman visibly takes in the idea. The Young Man continues in a low voice.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}

<CHAR>__{YOUNG WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Yeah.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Then you got the idea to take everybody's wallet.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Uh-huh.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{That was a good idea.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG WOMAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{Thanks.}
<CHAR>__{YOUNG MAN} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{We made more from the wallets then we did the register.}

Your great-granddaddy gave it to your granddad for good luck. Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's. Your granddad was a Marine and he was killed with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake Island. Your granddad was facing death and he knew it. None of those boys had any illusions about ever leavin' that island alive. So three days before the Japanese took the island, your 22-year old grandfather asked a gunner on an Air Force transport named Winocki, a man he had never met before in his life, to deliver to his infant son, who he had never seen in the flesh, his gold watch. Three days later, your grandfather was dead. But Winocki kept his word. After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother, delivering to your infant father, his Dad's gold watch. This watch. This watch was on your Daddy's wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi. He was captured and put in a Vietnamese prison camp. Now he knew if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd be confiscated. The way your Daddy looked at it, that watch was your birthright. And he'd be damned if and slopeheads were gonna put their greasy yella hands on his boy's birthright. So he hid it in the one place he knew he could hide somethin'. His ass. Five long years, he wore this watch up his ass. Then when he died of dysentery, he gave me the watch. I hid with uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass for two years. Then, after seven years, I was sent home to my family. And now, little man, I give the watch to you.}

Butch decides for the life of him, he can't leave anybody in a situation like that. Se he begins rooting around the pawnshop for a weapon to bash those hillbillies' heads in with. He picks up a big destructive-looking hammer, then discards it: Not destructive enough. He picks up a chainsaw, thinks about it for a moment, then puts it back. Next, a large Louisville slugger he tries on for size. But then he spots what he's been looking for: A Samurai sword. It hands in its hand-carved wood sheath from a nail on the wall, next to a neon "DAD'S OLD-FASHIONED ROOT BEER" sign. Butch takes the sword off the wall, removing it from its sheath. It's a magnificent piece of steel. It seems to glisten in the low-wattage light of the pawnshop. Butch touches his thumb to the blade to see if the sword is just for show. Not on your life. It's as sharp as it gets. This weapon seems made to order for the Brothers Grimm downstairs.

And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know I am the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon you." I been sayin' that shit for years.  And if you ever heard it, it meant your ass. I never really questioned what it meant. I thought it was just a coldblooded thing to say to a motherfucker 'fore you popped a cap in his ass. But I saw some shit this mornin' made me think twice. Now I'm thinkin', it could mean you're the evil man. And I'm the righteous man.  And Mr. .45 here, he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness. Or is could by you're the righteous man and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish.  I'd like that. But that shit ain't the truth. The truth is you're the weak.
