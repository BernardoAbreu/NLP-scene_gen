<L>__{interior safeway cereal aisle late afternoon}
<A>__{muzak up. a worried diane, now showing slightly under all black warm ups, is writing on her notepad as she walks down an aisle. suddenly, in the b.g. cross aisle, an ecstatic jack, in "video barn" uniform, whizzes past, riding his cart. arms out at his sides.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i'm on top of the world!}
<A>__{seeing diane, he tries to stop, but can't and continues past. a second later, he scrambles back and rides up to her tossing more boxes into the already full cart.}
<C>__{jack }
<P>__{(holding box of cookies)}
<D>__{hey, di, if we have a girl, we should dress her like little debbie!}
<A>__{jack pulls alongside diane and kisses her. she notices the full cart. it'll cost a fortune.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{jack, sweetie, i'm only eating for two.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(positively giddy)}
<D>__{but di, all this food reminds me of how much i want to teach our baby.}
<A>__{he tosses more cereal in the cart. diane looks at her notepad, then starts to return items to the shelves without}
<B>__{jack noticing.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{like cocoa puffs. good. captain crunch. bad. shreds the roof of your mouth. i mean you hear, "tricks are for kids!" and you think, "i'm a kid, i guess they're for me." but your baby brain's got no idea that fruit loops are, like, a million times better. i'm going to save our kid all that pain.}

<D>__{jack...}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(putting all three in cart)}

<C>__{diane}
<D>__{jack, i think i should get a job.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(rubbing her belly)}
<D>__{but we agreed your job is running the baby machine...}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{i know, but that was before.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{ah! i almost forgot gas for the baby machine. i will grab your snickers and get a place in line.}
<A>__{he kisses her again and runs off. diane watches him the love in her eyes quickly turns back to worry and she starts to put everything back on the shelves: cookies, cereal, chips, ice cream oh, that struggle, but it goes...}
