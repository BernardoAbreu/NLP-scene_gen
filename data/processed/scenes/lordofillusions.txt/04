<L>__{exterior nevada desert day}
<A>__{a violent wind howls around, but through the sand we can just make out a large, ominous building: the house of william nix. its walls are white washed and scrawled with graffiti. the "family" of idols surrounds the doorway, guarding it. on screen, the words: '"nevada thirteen years ago"}
<L>__{exterior nix's house day}
<A>__{we're at the front door now, which stands open. leaning against the door frame is a scrawny, wild eyed youth, about sixteen. his name is butterfield. he's got a brooding, almost sultry look on his face. one of his eyes is black, the other milky blue. he's whittling something with a scalpel. distantly, the sound of car engines. butterfield narrows his eyes. butterfield's p.o.v. the volkswagen "bus" and thunderbird are approaching the house.}
<C>__{butterfield}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{swann...?}
<A>__{he turns from the door. in his haste he drops the wood he's whittling. he's been carving a death's head.}
