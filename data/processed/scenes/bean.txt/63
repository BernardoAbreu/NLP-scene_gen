<L>__{5 reynolds still asleep. with bean asleep completely on top of him.}
<A>__{completely. his hand is spread on reynolds' face. reynolds' eyes open. he sees what's happened. his arm goes up and rings for the hostess.}
<L>__{6 morning has broken. reynolds is still trying to sleep bean is wide}
<A>__{awake. the hostess approaches, and the mother of the young boy says her son isn't very well. bean decides to cheer him up. he mimes an aeroplane which makes the boy feel more ill. then does a rather good lizard impersonation by sticking bits of paper to his tongue and eye lids and fluttering them. he then brings out a scrunched up bag of dolly mixtures and does his trick of throwing a sweet in the air and catching it in his mouth. the boy is too ill to be impressed. bean tries to cheer him up with his imaginary gun pretending to be a cowboy and then a tough american cop. nothing. then he has an extremely fun idea. he empties the dolly mixtures from the paper bag and pockets them. he then blows up the empty bag and is about to pop it to wake reynolds, when he sees it's got a hole in it. no fun. meanwhile, the boy has taken out his sick bag. bean is delighted yes, that's perfect. he turns away for a split second to scrunch up the useless bag, while, unseen to him, the boy vomits into his bag. bean turns, grabs the bag from him blows into it, puts it right into reynolds' face at arms length, and smacks his hands together. cut : at just the right moment.}
