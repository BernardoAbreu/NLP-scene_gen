<L>__{exterior farmer's market day}
<A>__{stan stares off into space. his beard is back. a customer surveys the different cheeses on the table.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{is this new? the zoe?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{yeah. this is the first week it's been out.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{can i have a sample? what's it like?}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{it's...very stubborn, overly suspicious and distrustful of men.}
<A>__{the customer looks up at stan.}
<C>__{customer}
<D>__{huh?}
<L>__{interior shadybrook rec room later}
<A>__{bobby pulls zoe onto the dance floor.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{come on, you old maid.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{dance with me. one dance.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{forget it.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{fine. but it doesn't mean that i won't dance with you.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{bobby starts dancing. but really dancing. justin timberlake style. zoe smiles at the absurdity and then tries to walk away. but bobby won't let her escape. he blocks her path and keeps dancing. this time turning around and shaking his ass triple time, like beyonce.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{haaaaaay.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{go away, you freak.}
<A>__{a crowd of old people gather round. they start clapping, thinking this is some kind of young person's dance routine.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{smack it, bitch.}
<A>__{bobby takes zoe's hand and smacks his ass with it.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{you know you love it. uh huh. that's right. smack it.}
<A>__{the old people do the same. trying to learn the hip new dance the kids are doing. several octogenarian couples smacking each other's asses. while this is happening, a weird look crosses zoe's face. bobby jumps up and turns around to face zoe. but when he lands on the ground, his feet slide out from under him and he hits the floor.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{what the hell?}
<A>__{an old man in the crowd looks down at the puddle.}
<C>__{old man}
<D>__{damn it. not again.}
<P>__{(then, checks pants)}
<D>__{nope. not me.}
<A>__{a few other old people look down and check themselves. at which point, zoe looks down and realizes.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{i think my water just broke.}
