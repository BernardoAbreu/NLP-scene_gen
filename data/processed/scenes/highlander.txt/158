<A>__{brenna sits on the expanse of grass throwing scraps to a group of wild park cats. a shadow covers her face. she looks up. it is taupin. something has changed him. his face is less cynical. more vulnerable. more human. he sits down on the grass beside her.}
<C>__{brenna}
<P>__{(after a moment)}
<D>__{what are we supposed to say?}
<A>__{the cat's eyes are all fixed in taupin. they cautiously shrink away, frightened.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{the emptyness. the years and years of void. nothingness. bordered only by the quest for ultimate nothingness. who would have guessed?}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{the inheritance.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{not power. not control.}
<A>__{taupin holds a blade of grass as if it was speaking to him.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{life. it is the gift and the under standing of life.}
<C>__{brenna}
<D>__{you have lived forever.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{life is only life when it is bounded by death. the inheritance is death. the gift is the finality of life. to be part of the fabric. the inside.}
<P>__{(turns to brenna)}
<D>__{i love you brenna.}
<A>__{brenna's chin quivers.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{it will be horrible. the future. i may die tomorrow or 10,000 tomorrows. i can promise you nothing. nothing but a moment. maybe two. but a moment of love, is that not worth a lifetime?}
<C>__{brenna}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{he holds her. they hold each other.}
<C>__{taupin}
<D>__{it's taken me so long. so very long.}
<A>__{a jogger runs by, unaware of any life but his own.}
