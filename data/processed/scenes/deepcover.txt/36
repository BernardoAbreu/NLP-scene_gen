<L>__{interior exterior front door night}
<A>__{three men: felix barbosa (whose photo we saw in carver's office). barbosa is a veteran of the coke business, but he's doing too much of the drug now; he's sweating, paranoid, unstable. with him is gopher, early 60s, a wizened high voiced old con who barbosa keeps the way spanish kings kept dwarfs, for amusement and luck; like the court jester, gopher can say anything he wants without fear. behind them is an hispanic kid, chino, 17, a thug. elias knows them all, but is not happy to see them at his door.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{barbosa}
<D>__{we've got a problem, david.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{call me on the phone.}
<C>__{barbosa}
<D>__{your friend eddie just started bending over for the cops.}
<A>__{this is very bad news. elias murmurs a shaken, "shit..." and steps outside, half closing the door behind him.}
<C>__{barbosa}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{they busted him, and he's dealing to save his ass.}
<C>__{gopher}
<D>__{which is how he'll lose the skinny little thing.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{did he give us up?}
<C>__{barbosa}
<D>__{not yet, but he will if he has to, and eventually he'll have to.}
<C>__{miranda }
<D>__{daddy! i thought we were doing my homework.}
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{i don't think he'd talk about us. he'd try not to.}
<C>__{barbosa}
<D>__{if we whack him, he definitely won't.}
<C>__{miranda }
<D>__{daddy!!}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(to miranda)}
<D>__{just a second.}
<P>__{(to barbosa)}
<D>__{not yet. let me check on this, first.}
<C>__{barbosa}
<P>__{(taunting)}
<D>__{nobody said you had to do the dirty work, david. i will take care of }
<C>__{elias}
<D>__{felix, if he's a problem, we'll kill him. i will kill him myself.}
<A>__{he doesn't realize until it's too late that nancy has just then opened the front door to see where he went. they look at each other, a terrible moment: she knows what he does, hates it, can't bring herself to leave him, hates herself for that.}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{nancy, get out of here.}
<C>__{nancy}
<D>__{for you; it's eddie.}
<A>__{she hands him a cordless phone, goes inside closing the door.}
<C>__{barbosa}
<D>__{you got a tasty wife, david. no wonder you don't want us coming here.}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(warning him)}
<D>__{don't talk about her that way.}
<A>__{barbosa laughs.}
<C>__{gopher}
<D>__{he can't help it, david, it's his nature.}
<C>__{elias}
<P>__{(into phone, chipper)}
<D>__{eddie... sure, man, what do you need?}
