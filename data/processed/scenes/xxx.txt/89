<L>__{interior ship late afternoon}
<A>__{xander opens a hatch and lowers himself into the hold. here is where the entire crew has been left to drown. they are struggling to stay above water, their hands and feet bound. as the far end of the room is another hatch. water pours in from this one and xander has to get it shut. he swims through the struggling crew, spots the captain holding his young son above water. the water is rising rapidly, filling up the compartment. xander braces his feet against the bulkhead and pushes, but the force of the water is too much. he surfaces. he's got to wait until the room floods before he can close that door. he watches as the crew goes into a panic, the water rising up to the ceiling. they are gasping in the last foot of air that's available. he sees the captain's son, crying and clutching at his father. xander takes a deep breath and dives down. he grabs the hatch door, braces his feet and pulls. his muscles strain as the heavy metal door slowly swings}
