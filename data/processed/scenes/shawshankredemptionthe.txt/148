<D>__{'course, norton failed to mention to the press that "bare minimum of expense" is a fairly loose term. there are a hundred different ways to skim off the top. men, materials, you name it. and, oh my lord, how the money rolled in...}

<D>__{now you just have some'a this fine pie my missus baked specially for you, and you think about that.}
<A>__{norton opens the box. alongside the pie is an envelope. he runs his thumb across the thick stack of cash it contains. in the background, a winch cable snaps and whips through the air, damn near severing a man's leg. he goes down, screaming in mud and blood, pinned by a fallen tree stump. men rush over to help him. norton barely takes notice.}
<C>__{norton}
<D>__{ned, i wouldn't worry too much over this contract. seems to me i've already got my boys committed elsewhere. you be sure and thank maisie for this fine pie.}
