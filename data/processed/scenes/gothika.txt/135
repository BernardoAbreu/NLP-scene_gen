<A>__{two police cruisers parked outside.}
<L>__{interior parsons' living room night}
<A>__{a glassy eyed phil parsons serves himself another scotch, devastated. the shot is framed so that we see the bedroom door is open, dorothy lying in bed, heavily tranquilized. sheriff ryan inspects the photographs.}
<B>__{on the lurid polaroids}
<A>__{postcards from hell: scared teenage girls in forced poses gagged, tortured andrea white, jenny dixon, tracy seaver... and young rachel parsons.}
<C>__{parsons}
<D>__{this proves that her story is true: my daughter appeared to her in some form and guided her through all this, putting things right.}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{come on, phil, you of all people }
<C>__{parsons}
<D>__{i of all people hold logic, reason and facts above everything else. and seek the truth through proof and proof only.}
<P>__{(re: pictures)}
<D>__{and what do you call that?}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{has it occurred to you that maybe she knew what her husband was doing to those girls?}
<C>__{parsons}
<D>__{no. frankly, it hasn't.}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{maybe she couldn't stand the guilt and cooked up this far fetched tale to tug at everybody's heartstrings. the fact remains she hacked her husband to pieces.}
<C>__{parsons}
<D>__{the fact remains my daughter was murdered and miranda stopped the killer. a killer who was loose under your incompetent nose for over six years. we don't know how many future victims were spared, but we do know she saved that girl in the barn's life. and that's more than you or i can say !}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{calm down. for the record, that girl is on a ventilator. the doctors don't think she'll make it through tonight.}
<C>__{sheriff ryan }
<D>__{now, you want to stand up in a courtroom and tell a judge that a ghost is behind all this, that's your prerogative but i have to abide by the law. and the law says miranda grey faces criminal chargers. so here's what we're going to do. i'm going to leave a cruiser outside to make sure you don't go anywhere tonight and two of my deputies will go guard ms. grey until tomorrow morning. phil?}
<A>__{parsons doesn't respond. his eyes far away.}
<C>__{sheriff ryan}
<D>__{there will be no breakouts, no aiding and abetting, no taking the law into your own hands. it'll take an act of god for miranda grey not to show up in that courtroom tomorrow. are we clear?}
<A>__{and now the sheriff can see that parsons is crying. quietly, miserably. and it's a disparaging sight. sheriff ryan exits. two deputies follow, radios}
<B>__{squawking.}
<A>__{parsons remains still for a moment, then digs a photograph out of a drawer. a picture of rachel in happier times.}
<C>__{parsons}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i will never forgive myself for what happened to you. not as long as i live.}
<P>__{(breaking down)}
<D>__{i miss you so much.}
<A>__{he sits there, staring at his dead daughter. grieving. we pull back to see he is not alone. rachel is watching him.}
