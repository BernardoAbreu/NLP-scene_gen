<A>__{probably prosperous at one time, it has since declined, its large fountain and eating area bow host to two bums and hooker, who sits alone in a rear booth near the telephone. dressed in a tuxedo, he nurses a cup of coffee, and anxiously alternates his glances between the clock and the empty street outside. it's 12:52.}

<A>__{the place is full of people, although we avoid long shot so as not to give away the room as a whole yet. instead, we concentrate on the tense, waiting faces of some of the more familiar people: gondorff and niles in tuxedos behind a barred cashier's area. gondorff mutilates a piece of gum in his mouth. niles just stares out into space cracking his knuckles.}

<A>__{the boardmarker walking nervously back and forth in front of his odds board, checking every letter and number. he stops to cross a t on one of the horses' names. it was already crossed, but he does it again anyway. billie and singleton, in an area hidden from the rest of the room, watching the print out on the ticker machine. the clicking of the ticker is the only sound we hear in the store. curly jackson in front of a mirror, pasting a fake van dyke on his chin to go with his tweed suit and monocle. a couple of billie's girls adjusting their waitress outfits and primping their hair. each has a tray full of drinks beside her. the eirie kid silently retracing his "route" to make sure he has it down. despite the crowd, there is no talking and little movement, save for the constant swirling of smoke from several cigars and cigarettes. the group is like a theatre company waiting to go on opening night.}
