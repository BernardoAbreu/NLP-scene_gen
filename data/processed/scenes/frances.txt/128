<D>__{alvin hanson, a.k.a. ronald burns, thomas slocum, harry york... mr. hanson, this warrant has been outstanding for many years. normally that circumstance would prompt me toward leniency, but the crime you committed inciting to riot and the cause you sought to promote a worker's rebellion are such anathemas to this court that i feel compelled to mete out the full sentence. i only wish it were longer.}
