<A>__{helen and ted sit on old trunk. helen holds a scrapbook in her arms. explaining to ted...}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{your parents never wanted to interfere with your life, ted. they knew your mom and dad loved you very much. they knew they did the right thing. but that doesn't mean they didn't watch you and miss you, from afar.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you mean they knew who i was?}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{they kept this scrapbook of your life. it meant the world to them.}
<B>__{close on scrapbook}
<A>__{we see baby pictures of ted, taken through the glass of a nursery. a newspaper photo of ted playing a donkey in a nativity play. and clippings from ted's high school newspaper.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i wondered about them, for so many years. i wondered if i looked like them, acted like them. i wondered why they gave me up.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{giving you up was the most unselfish thing they ever did. when they founded "heaven," they wished they could take you back but it was too late. all they could do was build the empire, knowing that someday it would all be yours.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{my legacy.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{your parents would be crushed to think you weren't happy with it.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{they're not my parents, helen. my parents are back in xenia and i hurt them very much.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{i understand.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{and the girl i love, she hates "heaven." if i keep it, she'll never respect me.}
<C>__{helen}
<D>__{but how can you respect yourself if you don't?}
