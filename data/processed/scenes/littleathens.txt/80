<L>__{exterior derek's house day}
<A>__{the sound of panting can be heard. two people are having sex. there are no words, although the girl regularly lets out high pitched groans, indicative of at least a little pain.}
<L>__{interior derek's house, bedroom continuous}
<A>__{low angle medium on allison bent over the bed, mouth agape. she buries her face in the mattress, revealing derek thrusting from behind. derek climaxes. allison pops up from below.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{i'm two pounds heavier i think.}
<A>__{derek lies back to put his head on the pillow.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{sorry.}
<A>__{allison lies on top, nestling her head in his chest.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{it hurt. i knew it would hurt, but that was kinda worse than i thought. does heather... like it?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{she never let's me do it.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{she doesn't? why not?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{i don't know. she does shave though. how come you don't shave?}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{i don't know. i don't want to. do you love her?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{i don't know.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{how can you not know?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{she's got problems.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{i don't understand you. why do you even cheat on her with me? she's so pretty. so much prettier than me.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{she's a nutcase. i will tell you what, i don't know why you do it. you should have a man of your own we say it all the time, me and heather.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{yeah, who? that slob you and heather introduced me to last time?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{he outranks me. he's a good guy.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{like me, i'm a good girl, and the best i can do is a guy that looks like that?}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{you must think so. you tried to set me up with him.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{i thought it was a bad match. it was heather's idea.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{so she thinks i can't do better.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{you know what she thinks better than me.}
<A>__{allison climbs out of bed, and her mood changes from thoughtful to business like. she begins putting her clothes on.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{let's get dressed, she'll be here.}
<A>__{derek looks calmly over at the alarm clock on the nightstand.}
<C>__{derek}
<D>__{let's let her walk in on us, and look surprised.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{hurry up.}
<A>__{allison opens the door and walks out, a little bow legged.}
