<C>__{eep }
<D>__{with every sun comes a new day. a new beginning. a hope that things will be better today than they were yesterday.}
<A>__{the croods scurry out of their cave like mice looking for food. scared. fast. the croods are chased by beasts across the desert. they escape from creatures up trees. they hide behind rocks.}
<C>__{eep }
<D>__{but not for me. my name's eep. this, is my family, the croods. if you weren't clued in already by the animal skins and sloping foreheads we're cavemen. most days we spend in our cave, in the dark. night after night, day after day. yep. home sweet home. when we did go out, we struggled to find food in a harsh and hostile world. and i struggled to survive my family.}

<C>__{eep }
<D>__{we were the last ones around. there used to be neighbors. the gorts, smashed by a mammoth. the horks, swallowed by a sand snake. the erfs, mosquito bite. throgs, common cold. and, the croods. that's us. the croods made it...}
<A>__{grug protects his family from a giant bear owl.}
<C>__{eep }
<D>__{because of my dad. he was strong... and he followed the rules.}
<A>__{a shadow falls across their feet and grug ushers his family home.}
<C>__{eep }
<D>__{... the ones painted on the cave walls. anything new is bad, curiosity is bad, going out at night is bad. basically, anything fun is bad. welcome to my world.}
<A>__{they all run back into the cave where grug slams the rock door closed. slowly light on cave paintings comes up again. but this time the light casts an ominous tone.}
<C>__{eep }
<D>__{but this is a story about how all that changed in an instant.}

<B>__{...}
<C>__{eep }
<D>__{because what we didn't know, was that our world was about to come to an end. and there were no rules on our cave walls to prepare us for that.}
<A>__{caveman hands press against the rock wall. they push. a blinding light floods the screen.}

<A>__{seq. 100 meet the croods a huge caveman, grug, rushes forward, screaming, growling, and throwing handfuls of dirt in a threat display. he blinks in the bright morning light. he lifts and hurls a large boulder.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{raaaaar groooooooooooowwwll erf erf glaaaaaabbbbllllllllthhhh!}
<A>__{as suddenly as he began, grug stops. panting, he waits for the echoes of his outburst to fade. grug turns to the cave entrance, he prepares to bellow a signal, but before any sound escapes his lips a cave girl, eep, bursts from the cave.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{you're supposed to wait for my signal eep. eep?}
<A>__{eep scares a pack of nearby liyotes away. they pounce on grug briefly before scampering off. eep spreads out on an overhanging rock. she basks in the sun.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{we've been in that cave forever.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{three days is not forever.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{it is with this family.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{eep would you come down here? you're being so dramatic.}
<A>__{a little girl, sandy, charges out nexterior her display is more terrier like.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{no, no, no sandy, come back here. remember the signal. good girls wait for the signal.}
<A>__{a cave woman, ugga, scrambles out nexterior she is mostly focused on catching sandy, giving only cursory effort to her display.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{ugga.}
<C>__{ugga}
<D>__{as soon as i get sandy, i will go back in, and you can give the signal.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{no, i mean, you're already out now.}
<C>__{thunk }
<D>__{i am waiting for the signal, dad.}
<A>__{we hear the voice of grug's nine year old son from inside the cave. thunk is eager to please his dad and emulates his every move.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{never mind, thunk. just, come out.}
<C>__{thunk}
<P>__{(not so fast)}
<D>__{uhh, but if you don't give the signal, how do i know you're my dad?}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{the signal isn't so you know it's me, it's so you know i wasn't eaten by an animal.}
<A>__{beat.}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{then why is the signal an animal noise? i mean, doesn't that just confuse things?}
<A>__{grug sighs.}
<C>__{thunk }
<D>__{i don't know... i'm still waiting for the signal.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{sigh. hoo hooooo! hoo hooooo!}
<A>__{thunk comes out growling, and barrels into grug. thunk picks up a boulder and throws it. it ricochets off the cliff wall and careens into grug. grug gets plowed over by the boulder.}

<A>__{we see a nest with a huge unguarded blue egg. the croods take shelter behind a rock. grug peers over the top.}

<D>__{who's up?}
<A>__{eep's hand shoots up. thunk is less than enthusiastic.}
<C>__{grug }

<D>__{oooh!}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{release the baby.}
<A>__{eep and sandy move in on the bird. sandy nips at its heels while ugga climbs up onto its head. she pulls the egg from its beak. down range, trip gerbils surface. they stretch their shared tail across the ramu's path like an arresting cable on a carrier. ugga rises to throw the egg to grug the gerbils wrap their tail around the ramu like a bola. the ramu goes down hard. ugga and the egg roll forward. the trip gerbils snatch up the egg and make off with it.}

<A>__{dribbling the egg down range with her cane like a hockey player. liyotes pop up from behind hoodoos. they swarm in behind her. the liyotes trip gran. they steal the egg, and hit the gas. they are incredibly fast.}
<C>__{gran}
<D>__{old lady down! eep, avenge me.}
<B>__{on eep}
<A>__{crouched in the shade of a scrubby bush, like a runner on the blocks she has the liyotes in her sights. eep}
<B>__{launches.}
<A>__{eep runs after the liyote with the egg, cutting him off in his tracks he slams into a cactus launching the egg into the air. eep leaps into the air taking back the egg.}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{thanks!}
<A>__{a bunch of jackrobats see eep and swarm around her. she loses her footing and throws the egg to grug.}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{eep!}
<C>__{eep}
<D>__{heads up!}
<A>__{grug catches the egg and runs by the entrance of a small cave. thunk following close behind accidentally trips over the tail of a sleeping bear owl knocking grug to the ground and fumbling the egg once again. thunk catches the egg just as the girelephant bears down on him from behind and lifts him onto one of its tusks. the family members meet up as they begin their long run back to the cave. an entire swarm of animals chase the croods as they head back to their cave. the bear owl is awakened and goes after everyone on the chase. grug protecting his family from the bearowl tosses each family member onto the girelephant's back. grug dodges the bearowl's attack and uses him as a launching pad to get himself safely on the girelephant. thunk is happy to see dad is safe.}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{oh hey dad, can we eat now?}
<C>__{grug}
<D>__{just wait till we get home. eep put on the brakes.}
<A>__{the entrance to crood canyon appears on the horizon. eep hangs off the edge of one of its tusks as grug takes over the other. together they dig their heels into the ground, slowing down the girelephant. the bearowl continues the chase. the croods maneuver the girelephant to fend off the bearowl.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{eep!}
<A>__{the girelephant moving way too fast readies for the crash. the girelephant crashes into the entrance of the canyon, sending the croods flying in. they all tumble. grug makes an extraordinary football catch. he holds tight to the meal as he slams into a rock. grug holds up the egg.}
<C>__{grug }
<D>__{who's hungry?}
<C>__{thunk}
<D>__{alright! good one, dad!}

<A>__{the family passes the leaky egg around quickly, each crood gets a taste. thunk is the last crood to get a mouthful, he hands it over to grug the egg is empty.}
