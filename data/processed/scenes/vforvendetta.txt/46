<L>__{interior shadow gallery}
<A>__{evey, alone in the shadow gallery, stares up at the inscription above the crooked staircase.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{v, v, v, v, v.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{i hear your summons, my lady. and obey.}
<A>__{she jumps, v suddenly appearing behind her.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{oh, v, you scared me.}
<A>__{she turns back to the carving.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{i was reading the inscription. what is it?}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{a latin quotation. a motto. "vi veri veniversum vivus vici." "by the power of truth, i, while living, have conquered the universe."}
<A>__{she nods.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{yes, i suppose you have. this place is the only universe i have right now.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{does that bother you?}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{i don't know. i'm so grateful to you i just feel i should help you, you know, the way you're helping me. i mean, that's the deal, isn't it?}
<A>__{v drifts over to the big old wurlitzer, fingers scanning the song list.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{no deals, evey. not unless you want them.}
<A>__{she looks up at the inscription as an old blues song begins to play.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{i think i do. part of me wants to stay here forever and never have to face what's going on outside. but that's not right. is it? that's not taking responsibility. not conquering my universe.}
<A>__{she turns to him.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{i want to help you, v. i want to do something. can we make a deal?}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{yes. i think we can make a deal if you like. i think i know a way you could help me very soon indeed.}
<A>__{evey smiles nervously.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{good. that's that, then.}
<A>__{the blues song curls in the air around them like a heavy incense.}
<C>__{evey}
<D>__{v, you said that latin thing was a quote. who said it?}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{nobody you'd have heard of. a german gentleman named dr. john faust.}
<A>__{he spins her.}
<C>__{v}
<D>__{he made a deal too.}
