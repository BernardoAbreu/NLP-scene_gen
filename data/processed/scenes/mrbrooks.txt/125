<L>__{interior detective atwood's condominium morning}
<A>__{reflected in the glass of an open mirrored closet door is a tastefully furnished den with floor to ceiling windows that look out at lake michigan from the 20th floor. an empty suitcase falls into this picture and bounces on the carpet. behind the mirrored door, detective atwood is atop a stepstool rummaging through the suitcases on the highest shelf. throughout the condo there is an incessant ringing of the phones. another suitcase goes down and atwood finds what she's looking for a framed color 8 x 10 photo of her husband, jesse. he's in a business suit and holding some kind of trophy. the phones stop ringing. atwood comes down the stepstool, folds it and is carrying it back to where it lives when the phones start ringing again. she picks up a cordless in the den.}
