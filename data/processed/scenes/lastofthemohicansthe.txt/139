<A>__{below the edge, listen & wait, testing the environment with all their senses ... north fissure uncas against one wall, has his ear cocked, monitoring, facing away from the sky ...}
<B>__{alice}
<A>__{looks at the sky through the fissure. she sees the starfields and feels silver moonlight pull her forward. she starts out onto the island, oblivious, unaware she'll expose them. suddenly ...}
<B>__{uncas}
<A>__{yanks her down next to him. he pulls her head into his chest, looking out over the edge, his tomahawk in front of him, his musket near his right hand. there is no sign she was seen. uncas & alice he relaxes, looks at her and puts his finger to his lips telling her to be silent. languorously, she lies back, closes her eyes and lays a hand on his shoulder, palm up, as if he were a prince in a romantic fantasy. uncas tries to restrain her. alice's eyes slowly open. oblivion disappears. it's replaced with escalating fear. she holds onto uncas with desperation. her fingers claw his shoulders. she buries her face in his chest.}

<D>__{uncas ...}
<A>__{her body shudders. her terror's total. he tries to restrain and calm her. she won't let him. then her mouth seeks his and in the passion of despair and fear and wanting life, she holds him between her thighs. and uncas is confused, but alice whispers his name and he responds. he loves her in the half light.}
<B>__{uncas}
<A>__{his hand buried in her hair irradiated by the moon, then she seems to reach some emotional climax and begins to cry softly, and uncas stops making love to her and holds her. then she's flooded with shame. he reaches for her. she jerks away. he reaches for her again and clutches her to him. and she breaks down. then he turns her face to him, but her expression has completely flattened.}
<B>__{wider angle}
<A>__{she's not a lover to uncas now. she's pitiful & stricken and he comforts her.}
