<D>__{if there are times when we feel alone and afraid, only small creatures in the dark, then these are the times when we must turn to one another for our comfort and our hope. to our neighbors. to our community. to our love for each other. i alone cannot ease the pain for herb and naomi kincaid, nor can i ease your pain, nor you ease mine. but if i believe anything it's this: we can comfort each other. we can heal each other. we can go on together.}
