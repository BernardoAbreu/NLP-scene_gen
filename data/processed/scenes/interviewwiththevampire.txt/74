<L>__{exterior new orleans streets night}
<A>__{louis walking, holding claudia as if he was about to lose her.}
<C>__{louis }
<D>__{though everything was changed, through the years had warped the contours of the streets, i found my way there, aware that i'd always known where it was and avoided it, not wanting to pass the doorway where i'd first heard claudia cry.}
<A>__{louis back in the same street, outside the same house. he stands with claudia at the window. there is a family inside, a picture of domestic tranquility.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i heard you crying. you were there in a room with your mother. you were hugging her for warmth, crying pitifully as you had been for days. because your mother was dead...}
<A>__{claudia stares at him, suddenly very cold, very alert.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i opened the shutters... i came into the room... i felt pity for you. pity, but something else.}
<A>__{he can't go on. claudia's eyes are remorseless.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{you... fed on me?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{and he found me with you. i ran, sickened at what i'd done. then he cut his wrist and fed you from him. i tried to stop him, but you were a vampire then. and have been every night hereafter.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{you both did it?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i took your life. he gave you another one.}
<A>__{claudia speaks through indrawn breath.}
<C>__{claudia}
<D>__{and here it is. and i hate you both.}
<A>__{she runs.}
