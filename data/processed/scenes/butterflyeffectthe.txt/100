<L>__{interior miller's basement day 1989}
<A>__{mr. miller puts the camera on a tripod in the basement. kayleigh and evan sit on folding chairs in front of the camera. tommy stands at the top of the basement stairs, looking down.}
<C>__{mr. miller}
<P>__{(to tommy)}
<D>__{what did i say about keeping that door closed, stupid?}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{but i wanna see!}
<C>__{mr. miller}
<D>__{you're gonna see my fist in about two seconds unless you do what i tell you.}
<A>__{tommy sulks and closes the door. mr. miller lowers his voice and speaks to evan and kayleigh.}
<C>__{mr. miller}
<D>__{now in this part of the story, robin hood just married maid marian and they have to kiss and stuff like grown ups do.}
<A>__{kayleigh giggles and covers her mouth with her hand. evan looks skeptical.}
<C>__{mr. miller}
<D>__{so take your clothes off kayleigh.}
<A>__{kayleigh stops giggling. evan says nothing.}
<C>__{mr. miller}
<D>__{come on, like when you take a bath. don't make a deal out of it. you too, evan.}
<A>__{mr. miller gets behind the lens. the room is dead silent.}
<C>__{mr. miller}
<D>__{let's go.}
<B>__{angle on tommy}
<A>__{who silently opens the door at the top of the basement stairs and watches with horror. evan's face is flushed with rage. he walks behind kayleigh and cups his hands tightly around her ears. she can't hear anything now.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{what time is it?}
<C>__{mr. miller}
<D>__{it's time for you to stand where the hell i told you.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{wrong answer, fuckbag. this is the very moment of your reckoning. in the next thirty seconds you're going to open one of two doors. the first door will forever traumatize your own flesh and blood.}
<A>__{the mature speech seems completely surreal coming from a seven year old. mr. miller looks around the room as if he's the butt of some sick joke.}
<C>__{mr. miller}
<P>__{(stunned disbelief)}
<D>__{what's happened to how are you doing that?}
<C>__{evan}
<P>__{(voice rising)}
<D>__{it'll change your daughter from a beautiful child into an empty shell whose only concept of trust was betrayed by her own sick pedophile father. ultimately, it'll lead to her suicide. nice work, daddy.}
<C>__{mr. miller}
<P>__{(hoarse whisper)}
<D>__{who who are you?}
<A>__{evan impatiently waves the question.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{let's just say you're being closely watched, george. your other option is to get your porn off the rack and treat kayleigh like... oh, let's say like how a loving father treats his daughter. sound okay to you, papa?}
<C>__{mr. miller}
<P>__{(choking)}
<D>__{...yes.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{listen close then, fuckbag. you screw up again and i swear i will flat out castrate you.}
<A>__{the impact of the last sentence isn't lost on mr. miller.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{one last thing.}
<A>__{evan leans over to whisper in kayleigh's ear. kayleigh stares at the floor, then looks up at her father and shivers. kayleigh looks into evan's eyes for support. evan nods go on. his confidence brings a boldness to her lips.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{don't you ever touch me again.}
<C>__{mr. miller}
<D>__{i i won't.}
<A>__{kayleigh summons her own new courage.}
<C>__{kayleigh}
<D>__{i'm cold. and i'm putting on my clothes.}
<A>__{as he leaves to pick up her clothes, evan grins.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{what you need to do is discipline your son tommy, because the kid's one sadistic pup.}
<A>__{hiding at the top of the basement stairs, tommy recoils in horror and picks up one of his sister's dolls and begins twisting the head back and forth... flash!}
