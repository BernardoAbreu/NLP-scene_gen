<A>__{john hears somthing. raises his hand "stop" the group stops. flatten themselves against the wall. john takes anthony's staff. moves forward with it held out in front of him... whirls around a blind corner shoves something against the wall thump! it struggles ripley and anthony run up raise their tapers revealing:}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{the abbot.}
<A>__{cassock torn, dirty. hair, eyes wild. anthony's staff across his throat. john pulls back.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{father }
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{what are you doing down here, father? you look like you've seen something that doesn't exist.}
<A>__{the abbot runs his fingers through his hair. smoothes it down.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{i was their spiritual leader. i was not prepared to lead them in battle. not against that thing.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{no one could be.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i thought you said the evil was inside me that sealing me up was the answer to all your problems?}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{destruction. the destruction you brought to us!}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{i only tried to warn you.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{what are you doing with this woman ?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{we are going to the technology room. trying to find some way to fight }
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{you don't join the devil to fight the devil.}
<C>__{anthony}
<D>__{she's helping us }
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{look who defends the deceiver the one who isn't even human. john, can't you see what is happening? on ancient earth, during the black death many believed that god had abandoned them, so they appealed to the devil. flocked to him hoping to save their bodies losing their souls in the bargain.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{father, we're all on the run from the same monster so let's not resort to the fire and brimstone routine. i've been enlightened about your "movement." pretty funny to be tried for heresy on a planet of heretics.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{the time for pretense is past.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{all right. i was trying to keep you quiet.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{sir ?}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{i do what i have to do to keep the brotherhood together. we all gave up believing in earth a long time ago. how do you think they would feel if told their exiled was in vain? that the holocaust they were trying to avoid never occured? those men up there have grown to live with it.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{and with you as their leader.}
<A>__{the abbot smiles. ripley is sharp.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{you threatened the status quo.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{so you, protector of knowledge and truth, lied to them.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{only about you. the rest i still believe. if earth still orbits its sun there is no way it could have survived being reduced to barbarism.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{you're as bad as the company.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{ripley }
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{that's why you ran. after all your talk death stared you in the face and you were afraid.}
<C>__{abbot}
<D>__{not afraid of death.}
<C>__{ripley}
