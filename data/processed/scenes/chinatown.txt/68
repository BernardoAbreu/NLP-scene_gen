<A>__{escobar points to the number "mu 7279" on the side of one of the kitchen cabinets.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{isn't that your number?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{is it? i forget. i don't call myself that often.}

<A>__{he indicates one of his assistants.}
<C>__{escobar's assistant}
<P>__{(a slight sneer)}
<D>__{what happened to your nose, gittes? somebody slam a bedroom window on it?}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(right back, smiling)}
<D>__{nope, your wife got excited, crossed her legs a little too quick. you understand, pal.}
<A>__{the assistant starts to move for gittes who is ready for him. escobar steps between the two.}
<C>__{escobar}
<P>__{(to other assistant)}
<D>__{loach.}
<P>__{(escobar pulls out a drawer)}
<D>__{how about these? look familiar?}
<A>__{in the open drawer are the photos of mulwray and the girl in the park, boat, and at the el macando on the veranda.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(no point in denying it)}
<D>__{yeah, i took 'em. so what?}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{how did she...}
<P>__{(meaning the corpse)}
<D>__{...happen to have them?}
<A>__{gittes takes a deep breath.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{either you tell me or i guess 'cause i don't have the answer.}
<A>__{escobar nods.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{you really think i'm stupid, don't you, gittes?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{i don't think about it one way or the other. but if you want, give me a day or two, and i will get back to you. now i'd like to go home.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{i want the rest of the pictures.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{what pictures?}
<C>__{escobar}
<P>__{(meaning the corpse)}
<D>__{this broad hired you, gittes, not evelyn mulwray.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{yeah?}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{yeah. somebody wanted to shake down mulwray, she hired you, and that's how you happen to know mulwray was murdered.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{i heard it was an accident.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{c'mon, you think you're dealing with a bunch of assholes? mulwray had salt water in his goddam lungs! now how did he get that... in a fresh water reservoir?}
<A>__{gittes is surprised at this piece of information, but remains nonplussed.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{you were following him night and day. you saw who killed him. you even took pictures of it. it was evelyn mulwray. she's been paying you off like a slot machine ever since her husband died.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{you accusing me of extortion?}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{absolutely.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{i don't think i need a day or two. you're even dumber than you think i think you are. not only that, i'd never extort a nickel out of my worst enemy, that's where i draw the line, escobar.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{yeah, i once knew a whore who for enough money would piss in a customer's face, but she'd never shit on his chest. that's where she drew the line.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{well, i hope she wasn't too much of a disappointment to you, lou.}
<A>__{escobar manages a thin smile.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{i want those photographs, gittes. we're talking about accessory after the fact, conspiracy, and extortion. minimum.}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{why do you think mulwray's body was moved you dimwit? evelyn mulwray knocked off her husband in the ocean and thought it would look like more of an accident if she hauled him up to the oak pass reservoir?}
<A>__{this is a little telling.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{mulwray was murdered and moved because somebody didn't want his body found in the ocean.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{and why's that?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{he found out somebody was dumping water there. that's what they were trying to cover up by moving him.}
<A>__{this stops escobar. he's dumbfounded by it.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{c'mon i will show you.}
<A>__{escobar hesitates.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{c'mon make a decision, lou. you're in charge.}
<A>__{the men around escobar look to him. escobar grudgingly nods.}
<B>__{close shot storm drain}
<A>__{it yawns at camera, only a trickle of water dropping into the ocean. view widens to include escobar, gittes, and two plain clothesmen, standing and staring at the empty pipe as if they expect it to talk.}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(squinting in sunlight)}
<D>__{it's too late.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{too late for what?}
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{they only dump the water at night.}
<A>__{a third assistant runs down the side of the cliff and over to escobar.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{reach anybody?}
<C>__{third assistant}
<D>__{yelburton, he's the new chief.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{i know who he is. well?}
<C>__{third assistant}
<D>__{he says }
<C>__{gittes}
<D>__{i know what he says.}
<C>__{escobar}
<P>__{(to gittes)}
<D>__{shut up.}
<P>__{(to assistant)}
<D>__{go on.}
<C>__{third assistant}
<D>__{yelburton says they're irrigating in the valley. there's always a little runoff when they do that. and he says is gittes knows that, and has been going around making irresponsible accusations for the last week.}
<A>__{escobar turns to gittes. stares at him for a long moment.}
<C>__{one of assistants}
<D>__{let's swear out a warrant for her arrest. what are we waiting for?}
<C>__{gittes}
<P>__{(meaning escobar)}
<D>__{because he just made lieutenant, and he wants to hang onto his little gold bar.}
<A>__{escobar stares hatefully at gittes.}
<C>__{escobar}
<D>__{have your client in my office in two hours and remember. i don't have to let you go. i've got you for withholding evidence right now.}
