<A>__{as rose, naked as the day she was born, runs screaming down the hall, ellis loping after her, reaching out his hand.}
<L>__{interior day room night}
<A>__{as the others, who are laying out food, drinking booze and stringing up hospital gauze, turn to see rose enter the room. she runs behind mcmurphy, pressing her body to his, as he gently takes hold of ellis' outstretched hands.}

<A>__{he pins ellis to the wall.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
