<C>__{welles noonan }
<D>__{i only want to bring him in when i know he'll never leave.}
<A>__{black dissolves to something lighter, then:}
<L>__{interior interrogation room time unknown}
<A>__{horizontal. someone pushed a table and two chairs to one side: space for the cot i'm on. look up. junior looking down: `concerned' isn't strong enough. in his undershirt. he slips the red steno pad into his back pocket. sit up. a balled dress shirt in my hand, blood sopped. gaze at my hamilton, face cracked, `5:16am' fritz koenig walks in, silver pitcher in hand. i gape up, still punchy.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{coffee?}
<C>__{koenig}
<D>__{ice. bradley's on his way down.}
<A>__{toss the dress shirt to the floor.}
<C>__{junior stemmons}
<D>__{that's mine...you needed some mopping up.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{who found me?}
<C>__{junior stemmons}
<D>__{i did. i got there at eleven like you said, right as two black & white's pulled up: you were out cold in a gutter `round the block.}
<P>__{(this blithe little grin)}
<D>__{did noonan knock you out?}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{he hit me with his car first.}
<C>__{junior stemmons}
<P>__{(a nod to koenig)}
<D>__{the captain was the only one here at this hour...}
<A>__{look from junior and koenig to the window behind him bradley steam rolling our way. to koenig, conspiratorial:}
<C>__{klein}
<D>__{if i need your help later on, can i count on it?}
<C>__{koenig}
<D>__{of course you can.}
<A>__{take the pitcher from him, drop my head, douse myself, the cold cuts cobwebs. bradley walks in, imperious. koenig moves past ice forms between the two.}
<C>__{koenig }
<D>__{chief.}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{what are you doing here?}
<C>__{koenig}
<D>__{the lieutenant was thirsty.}
<A>__{koenig closes the door. i refuse to look up at bradley.}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{progress on magdalena.}
<A>__{i point to junior happy to play teacher's pet:}
<C>__{junior stemmons}
<D>__{no fingerprints. clean crime scene. canvassed the neighborhood. a senile neighbor did report a possible peeper }
<A>__{ rubbing the back of my head where the peeper bashed me }
<C>__{me}
<D>__{ confirmed peeper.}
<A>__{bradley turns to me:}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{is that who knocked you out?}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{noonan knocked me out.}
<C>__{bradley}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he's having you tailed then...}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{and he knows the magdalena name and that i was chasing a suspect the peeper lucille strips for.}
<C>__{junior stemmons}
<D>__{she knows someone watches?}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{and who he is. she has to.}
<P>__{(back to bradley)}
<D>__{i want access to her juvie sheet or whatever arrest records exist. rumor was hector whored her out to dealers he did business with.}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{that's immaterial.}
<C>__{me}
<P>__{(as my teeth grit)}
<D>__{it is if you're eliminating her as a suspect }
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{ did you confirm their alibi?}
<A>__{point to the ever studious junior.}
<C>__{junior stemmons}
<D>__{i spoke with a mr. and mrs. preston mott of santa barbara, the parents of madge magdalena nee mott and they've confirmed their visit and also corroborated the argument that resulted in them leaving early.}
<C>__{bradley}
<P>__{(back to me now)}
<D>__{one alteration to my previous orders }
<C>__{me}
<D>__{ previous orders being what? assign the cop noonan blames for his dead boxing probe to the case that's becoming his new crusade?}
<A>__{bradley conjures the roman visage...then slowly opens the door, staring holes in me.}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{step out stemmons.}
<A>__{junior balks, looks my way: tries to mimic my sneer. i stand and shove him toward the door. his look back at me: judas. bradley closes the door behind him.}
<C>__{bradley }
<D>__{no direct approach on the mother or the daughter.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{no. madge was a battered wife and lucille was a suborned whore. if that's not motive, what is? you want answers then we brace those two hard.}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{if you do so directly, if they're formally questioned then noonan may find out and go after them with federal warrants.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{noonan will figure out who and what hector was sooner or later.}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{yes he will, so we buy time, keep him busy }
<C>__{me}
<D>__{ until when?}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{until tom bethune votes on the floor of the city council in two days, ratifying the official start of construction on dodger stadium }
<C>__{me}
<D>__{ this is bigger than a fucking ballpark! hector magdalena and narco is the powder keg, blows the whole department to hell.}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{don't be dramatic, it looks weak. right now, noonan needs a pursuit, so i supply him with one }
<C>__{me}
<D>__{ me. you want me to draw him off }
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{ you've been drawing him off. and the more he sees you the less he'll think of anything other than getting you. now find tommy and take him alive. do not let noonan get to him. as a potential major case witness against the lapd, tommy magdalena isn't just a powder keg, he's an atom bomb.}
<A>__{bradley walks. watch him disappear down the hall.}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{bradley has a bigger angle and i'm getting close to it...i just haven't hit home. yet.}
