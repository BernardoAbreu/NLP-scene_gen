<A>__{all five guys stand in a group. it is utterly quiet. an old but well kept cadillac creeps into the lot from the far end and idles up to them. the windows are tinted too much to see in. the car passes within a few feet of them and drives on. a moment later, a chrome and leather monster of a harley davidson pulls into the lot. the rider is dressed in an almost comical array of leather, silver and suede. he waves to the caddy as it parks a few yards from keaton and the others. it sits quietly, almost menacing. as he gets closer, we can see he is wearing one black boot and one red. keaton is still looking at them when the bike pulls up to them and stops. redfoot and mcmanus shake hands.}
