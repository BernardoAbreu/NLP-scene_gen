<L>__{interior elc supervisor's office day}
<A>__{the elc supervisor for caguan may be a marxist, but the clean, well ordered office is nicely appointed, with a big screen sony and leather furniture. the tv's tuned to cnn. a photo on the wall depicts him as a younger man wearing guerrilla cammies bearing with an elc patch and holding an ak 47. a brass nameplate reading "supervisor" rests on a neat desk, behind which stands the man himself a hardened, former guerrilla fighter proud of his position. he's not in cammies now his uniform now consists of casual but nice tropical clothing and a fat rolex. felix is a subordinate here. he and gordy stand across the desk as the supervisor examines gordy's travel pass. gordy's nervous about what could appear on the tv in the b.g., but tries not to show it.}

<D>__{... mompos is a shithole. not like caguan... why didn't armstrong come?}
<C>__{gordy}
<D>__{he was arrested in ecuador. he got drunk and fooled around with a police officer's wife.}
<A>__{the supervisor just looks at him, assessing gordy's face for signs he's lying. gordy's expression stays the same. felix respectfully interjects. it's almost a plea.}
<C>__{felix}
<P>__{(in spanish)}
<D>__{we need to fix the equipment. we have delivery deadlines to meet.}
<A>__{a long beat. the elc supervisor hands the travel pass back to gordy. in a hard tone to felix }
