<A>__{we see the used christmas trees of the residents being thrown onto an existing campfire, building into the enormous, celebratory bonfire that lights the scene. as we did with the footsteps in the mud and the kayak slashing the sand, we track vertically along an extension cord from one of the trailer generators to the stage until we find tracy with her guitar and chris with the second hand organ from rainey and jan's booth on the stage. they enter into a duet of john prine's angel from montgomery for the crowd of the slabs' fire lit inhabitants. in the crowd, we find rainey and jan clapping and dancing along to chris and tracy's song. merry christmas.}
