<L>__{exterior grassy field behind motel night}
<A>__{sam is in a grassy field behind the motel, moving away from the building. she wears a hooded sweatshirt, jeans, and her right hand is wrapped in some sort of makeshift bandage. there's a gash in the side of her forehead by her temple, with what looks to be a shard of metal partially embedded under the skin and protruding from the wound. she is without expression, and her movements are rhythmic and fluid. a tall aermotor windmill towers in the distance... sam's luminous pov the grassy field a glimpse of the field through sam's eyes shows a phosphorescent plane of destiny an intricate grid in which objects organic and inorganic dwell in assigned positions, and move according to a framework of set paths. a jackrabbit follows a silvery vector spear like prophetic life gel to its burrow... cosmic energy burns around a cluster of stones... miniature vector spears lead a swarm of insects around in a circle and then buzzing right past sam's field of vision... it's infinitely complex, but sam sees through it clearly. she has no vector spear of her own to guide her, but she is cognizant of her path... she moves toward the windmill.}
