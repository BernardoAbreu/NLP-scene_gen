<L>__{102: interior stairs living room den. house. night.}
<A>__{this is deep past midnight, the house is quiet and gone to bed. fallout from the party everywhere. still that distant sound of carols. berlin dumps his bag and walks into the den. just dark ness and the forgotten tape machine. flips on a lamp and tries to open the gun cabinet. still trying when startled by a voice.}
<C>__{ross }
<D>__{you can't get in there .. that's "comanche proof."}
<A>__{berlin swings round in surprise. ross is half asleep on a sofa.}
