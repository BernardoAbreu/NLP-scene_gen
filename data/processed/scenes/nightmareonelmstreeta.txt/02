<A>__{a pulsation of light and shadow. music drops away to a hushed rushing of wind and distant sirens. camera racks into focus on a high panorama of the san fernando valley, its night sky lit from within by a strange greenish light. titles begin. camera tilts down and zooms swiftly into the valley's web of light.}

<A>__{titles continue as tina gray, a strong girl of fifteen in a thin night shift, moves towards us down a dark concrete corridor. her steps quicken as titles appear in the portion of frame she leaves free. a subliminal collage of sound threads in and out of the music. distant insane laughter. slamming iron doors. a bleating animal cry. a lamb, white and blank faced, skitters across her path and on into the dark. no reason why it's there. then another sound, much nearer the slithering scrape of something like fingernails across slate. it sets our teeth on edge, twists the music, and sends tina running.}
