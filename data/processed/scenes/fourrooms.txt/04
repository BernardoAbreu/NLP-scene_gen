<D>__{ don't call me teddy.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{ted, the night's cake. it's easy. the day's when it's busy. during the night there's nothing to do.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{it's new year's eve.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{which'll make it less busy than normal. ever worked on christmas? unless you sell turkeys, business is dead. you just got butterflies, that's all.}

<D>__{what i have ain't butterflies. i can't handle this hotel all by myself.}
<A>__{betty slows the scene down.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{okay, let's calm down a minute. slow it down, cool it off. let's just talk.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you can say any goddamn thing you want }
<C>__{betty}

<C>__{ted}
<D>__{okay... okay... okay... i'm calm, i'm cool, let's talk.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{ted, in a nutshell, all you have to do is hold the fort. it's new year's eve. most of the guests are going out. you'll just be giving them a little nod as they come staggering in at three... four... five... in the morning. nobody's having any parties, a few get togethers, but no parties. you got about three people checking in tonight, that's it. the only variable is chester rush in the penthouse.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{chester rush? the guy from the wacky detective?}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{yeah, him and his entourage checked in last night. they're in the penthouse. the only reason i refer to it as a variable is that he's a movie star. ya never know about movie stars. i'm tellin' ya, ted, it's cake.}
<A>__{betty takes a piece of paper and writes her number down.}
<C>__{betty}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{and look, if you have any problems, call me at the party.}
<A>__{ted thinks about it for a moment.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{okay.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{great }
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{ for fifty bucks.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{fifty bucks!}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you're shirking your duties for this nazi. for that you pay a price, and the price is fifty bucks.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{one, horst is not a nazi. two, that's not a fair price. you're taking advantage of the situation. twenty bucks. now, twenty bucks is a fair price.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yeah, but what you're doin' to me ain't fair. and, you are completely and totally taking advantage of me and your position. so fifty bucks is the perfect price.}
<A>__{betty begrudgingly digs in her purse.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{okay, but don't be a pussy. you don't bother me unless it's an emergency. in fact, for fifty bucks, you better not call me unless the fuckin' building's burning down.}
<A>__{she gives him the money.}
<C>__{betty}
<D>__{get ready to take the desk.}
<A>__{betty leaves. ted sits in the chair, takes another drink, and prepares himself for the night.}
