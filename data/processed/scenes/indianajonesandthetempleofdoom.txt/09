<L>__{6. exterior "the dragon" nightclub night}
<A>__{in a shower of sparkling glass, the enormous gong sails out and crashes down a sloping green tiled roof. indiana jones and wil lie scott hurtle into the night air after it! the gong rolls down the roof and they hit the tiles behind it, indiana holding onto willie as they roll one over the other toward the edge willie screams as they fall into thin air! their entwined bodies plummet three stories: ripping through a third floor awning, crashing through an old man's mattress on a second floor balcony finally they smash through the convertible top of a parked duesen berg and fall into the back seat!}
