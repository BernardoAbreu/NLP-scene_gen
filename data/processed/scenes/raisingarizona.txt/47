<L>__{interior devastated trailer}
<A>__{as ed sits heavily into frame, apparently in shock, her frozen profile to the camera as she stares straight ahead into space. her foreground hand absently holds a length of cord. beyond her in the middle background hi is rummaging in the debris. he stands up, cropped from the chest down and starts loading bullets into the chamber of ed's .38 police special.}

<C>__{hi}
<D>__{...let's go get nathan jr.}
<B>__{tracking shot}
<A>__{from the front bumper of an automobile. beautiful desert stretches to the horizon. the road rushes under the camera. gale and evelle's car gale drives, gazing out at the road. evelle holds nathan jr., occasionally bouncing him. contemplatively:}

<A>__{a huge rumbling rippling red ball that fills the frame. as we hear his footfalls on concrete steps, smalls rises into frame, apparently climbing a stoop. the sun behind him throws him into silhouette; the extreme telephoto flattens him against the sun. heat waves ripple between us and him, making his figure slightly waver. the rumble builds, louder and louder, until it is snapped off by a }
