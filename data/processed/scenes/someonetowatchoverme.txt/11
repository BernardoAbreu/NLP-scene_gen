<L>__{interior club night}
<A>__{the latest achievement of money, rock and art. it's a breathtaking multi leveled theater of light, sound and dance. there is also an entrance by invitation only grand salon.}
<B>__{angle}
<A>__{the guests arriving here for the met gala enter almost in enchanted procession, each of them being personally greeted by the primary owner and manager of the club, win hockings, a charming, rakish ex preppy. win stands in the middle of the floor in the throw of a spot, greeting. this is his element and his club, a son of old money, and a crossover creature to the fast life.}
<C>__{win}
<D>__{hi... nice to see you... thank you... my pleasure...}

<A>__{win acknowledges the obligatory compliment with a closed smile, impatiently returning to claire:}
<C>__{win}
<D>__{c'mon, let's get outa this lowbrow rag trade...}
<P>__{(smiles, cutting neil out)}
<D>__{you don't mind, do you?}
