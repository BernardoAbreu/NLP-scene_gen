<A>__{on stage we see the queen of the night fantastically costumed, furiously urging her daughter to kill sarastro. as she sings, we see the interior of the theatre, now re arranged from when we last visited it to watch the cabaret. an audience of ordinary german citizens stands in the pit area, or sits: they are rapt and excited. the theatre also possesses boxes; some of these show closed curtains their inhabitants presumably engaged in private intimacies. in one of them sits salieri.}
