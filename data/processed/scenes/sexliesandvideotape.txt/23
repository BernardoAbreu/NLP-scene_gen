<L>__{interior cynthia bishop's apartment day}
<A>__{cynthia gets out of the shower. the phone rings. she wraps herself in a towel and lifts the receiver.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{cynthia. john.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{not today. i've got other plans.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{oh.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{well, when, then?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{how about inviting me over to dinner?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you know what i mean.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{yeah, i know what you mean.}
<A>__{cynthia hangs up the phone.}
<L>__{interior graham's apartment day}
<A>__{graham sits smoking a cigarette. there is a knock at his door.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{it's open.}
<A>__{cynthia enters. graham looks up at her.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{who are you?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i'm cynthia bishop.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{do i know you?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i'm ann millaney's sister.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{the extrovert.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{she must have been in a good mood when she said that. she usually calls me loud.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{she called you that, too. may i ask why you re here?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{you want me to leave?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i just want to know why you're here.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{well, like i said, ann is my sister. sisters talk. you can imagine the rest.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{no, i really can't. i find it healthy never to characterize people i don't know or conversations i haven't heard. i don't know what you and your sister discussed about me or anything else. last time i saw ann she left here very...confused, i would say. and upset.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{she still is.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{and are you here to berate me for making her that way?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{nope.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{she didn't tell you why she was upset?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{nope.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{she didn't give you my address?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{nope.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{how did you find me?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i, uh, know a guy at the power company.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i don't understand. why did you want to come here? i mean, i can't imagine ann painted a very flattering portrait of me.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{well, i don't really listen to her when it comes to men. i mean, look at john, for crissake. oh, you went to school with him didn't you? you're probably friends or something.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{nope. i think the man is a liar.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{i think you're right. so come on, i came all the way over here to find out what got ann so spooked, tell me what happened.}
<C>__{graham}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{spooked.}
<A>__{he motions to the box of videotapes.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{that box of tapes is what got ann so "spooked".}
<A>__{cynthia goes over to the box and looks inside for a long moment, studying the labels.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{oh, okay. i think i get it.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{what do you get?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{well, they must be something sexual, because ann gets freaked out by that shit. are these tapes of you having sex with these girls or something?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{not exactly.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{well, either you are or you aren't. which is it?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{why don't you let me tape you?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{doing what?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{talking.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{about what?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{sex. your sexual history, your sexual preferences.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{what makes you think i'd discuss that with you?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{you just want to ask me questions?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i just want to ask you questions.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{and that's all?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{that's all.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(a crooked smile)}
<D>__{is this how you get off or something? taping women talking about their sexual experiences?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{would anybody else see the tape?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{absolutely not. they are for my private use only.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{how do we start?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i turn on the camera. you start talking.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{and you ask questions, right?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{how long will it take?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{that depends on you. one woman only used three minutes. another filled up three two hour tapes.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{can i see some of the other tapes to get an idea of what }
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{do i sit or stand?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{whichever you prefer.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i'd rather sit. are you ready?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{just a moment.}
<A>__{graham grabs his 8mm video camera, puts in a new tape, and turns it on.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{i am now recording. tell me your name.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{cynthia patrice bishop.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{describe for me your first sexual experience.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{my first sexual experience or the first time i had intercourse?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{your first sexual experience.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<P>__{(thinks)}
<D>__{i was...eight years old. michael green, who was also eight, asked if he could watch me take a pee. i said he could if i could watch him take one, too. he said okay, and then we went into the woods behind our house. i got this feeling he was chickening out because he kept saying, "ladies first!" so i pulled down my underpants and urinated, and he ran away before i even finished.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{was it ever a topic of conversation between the two of you afterward?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{no. he kind of avoided me for the rest of the summer, and then his family moved away. to cleveland, actually.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{how unfortunate. so when did you finally get to see a penis?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{when i was fourteen.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{live, or in a photograph or film of some sort?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{very much live.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{what did you think? did it look like you expected?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{not really. i didn't picture it with veins or ridges or anything, i thought it would be smooth, like a test tube.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{were you disappointed?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{no. if anything, after i looked at it awhile, it got more interesting. it had character, you know?}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{what about when you touched it? what did you expect it to feel like, and then what did it really feel like?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{it was warmer than i thought it would be, and the skin was softer than it looked. it's weird. thinking about it now, the organ itself seemed like a separate thing, a separate entity to me. i mean, after he pulled it out and i could look at it and touch it, i completely forgot that there was a guy attached to it. i remember literally being startled when the guy spoke to me.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{what did he say?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{he said that my hand felt good.}
<C>__{graham}
<D>__{then what happened?}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{then i started moving my hand, and then he stopped talking.}
