<A>__{wills bursts in and freezes. a woman stands across the way, studying an oil painting. she turns quickly. it's lisa. she sees his excited expression fall. beneath her rather composed facade, lisa is a chaos of conflicting emotions }
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{sorry to disappoint you.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{no, no. not at all. you surprised me, that's all. i didn't expect to see you... not here... not after your letter.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{well, i didn't expect you to show up at my job.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i followed you in. i wasn't even sure it was you. all i have is an old snapshot.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{my boss thought you were a stalker.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i didn't mean to run off like that.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{but you did.}
<A>__{an awkward silence.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{so you got my letter. what'd you do? freak out? burn it?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i saved it.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i was just blowing off some steam, okay? i think i have the right.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{so do i. look, why don't we go upstairs.}
<C>__{lisa}
<P>__{(uneasily)}
<D>__{no. i didn't plan to come. peter... my husband... he agrees. he thinks it's a futile exercise. but it turns out i'm pregnant. just a few months, but }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{lisa congratulations. that's wonderful.}
<A>__{his sincerity stops her. she softens slightly, mustering a tiny smile }
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{thanks. anyway, i guess it made me want to meet you. i've been a little sentimental about parent hood.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{is that what you consider me?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{in a lousy absentee sorta way, sure.}
<A>__{pause.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{how's your mom?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{great. nuts. she moved to costa rica last summer.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{a guy, what else? he owns a charter airline and wears sunglasses indoors. i think he might be a gunrunner.}
<A>__{wills chuckles. for the first time, lisa relaxes enough to take him in.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{you know, you're much better looking in person than in photographs. i always assumed mom was exaggerating, but she wasn't.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{thanks. you're not bad looking yourself.}
<A>__{lisa smiles, and, much to her embarrassment, tears come to her eyes. she shakes her head at how absurd she is, treasuring kind words from a father she doesn't know.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{anyway... i should go...}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{already?}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{i really just wanted to meet you and... maybe... i don't know...}
<C>__{wills}
<P>__{(gently)}
<D>__{what is it? tell me.}
<A>__{she sniffles and looks away }
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{nothing earth shattering. maybe just to hear you say you were sorry.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i am. i'm very sorry.}
<A>__{she stares at him long and hard, waiting for some more palpable sign of remorse. it isn't forthcoming. finally, she nods.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{okay. thanks.}
<A>__{she turns and walks away. his voice stops her }
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{can i call you?}
<A>__{she turns around, hesitates for a moment, then nods. she continues to the door. but then she stops and turns }
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{before... when you came in... who did you think i was?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{a friend.}
<C>__{lisa}
<D>__{you must like her an awful lot.}
<A>__{she smiles simply and heads for the door. when she is gone, wells slowly walks back toward the elevators, but then abruptly stops in his tracks, deliberating...}
