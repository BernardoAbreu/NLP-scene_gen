<L>__{exterior water buffalo lodge night}
<A>__{a sign proclaims this as "grand bedrock lodge loyal order of water buffalo." the parking lot outside is full of vehicles. we hear the sound of a gavel banging...}
<C>__{herdmaster }
<D>__{attention, fellow water buffaloes...}
<L>__{interior water buffalo lodge night}
<A>__{the members are milling about the main room, schmoozing, drinking, kibitzing. all wear the furry and horned ceremonial fez of the buffalo. one wall of the lodge displays a big version of the lodge coat of arms (with the motto "ackus ackus adackus" below); a trophy case holds a mind boggling display of various bowling trophies, balls and pins. at the lectern, the herdmaster (a mustachioed, inspirational type) bangs again for order.}
<C>__{herdmaster}
<D>__{brothers, your attention!}
<A>__{it quiets a bit. he clears his throat, raises his chin, and gives a strange mournful bellow.}
<C>__{herdmaster}
<P>__{("ritual" type tone)}
<D>__{the herd is now called to the prairie.}
<P>__{(holding fingers above ears)}
<D>__{antlers... up!}
<A>__{the entire lodge dutifully imitates this gesture.}
<C>__{entire group}
<D>__{ack ack a dack!}
<C>__{herdmaster}
<P>__{(banging gavel)}
<D>__{this meeting of the water buffaloes is now in session. sergeant at arms, have we got any old business?}
<A>__{barney stands, acknowledges his friends and lodge brothers.}
<C>__{barney}
<D>__{indeed we do, brother herdmaster. tonight we are to hear speeches from prospective candidates for lodge offices, such as good old fred and some other guys.}
<B>__{piltdown}
<A>__{seated across the room with pyrite and other cronies, he immediately leaps to his feet, paws the ground, and gives an eerie moan even stranger than the herdmaster's earlier call to order.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<A>__{after the cry echoes away:}
<C>__{herdmaster}
<D>__{brother piltdown: you have given the cry of the gelded buffalo at the poisoned water hole. do you wish to file an objection?}
<C>__{piltdown}
<D>__{you bet i do. how come flintstone is 'good old fred' and me and the other candidates are just 'some other guys'?}
<C>__{pyrite}
<D>__{yeah, how come?}
<C>__{barney}
<P>__{(rising)}
<D>__{my apologies, brother piltdown. allow me to rephrase. tonight we will hear speeches from a whole bunch of good old guys...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{... plus the one and only fred flintstone!}
<A>__{cheers go up, which drown out piltdown's renewed cry of the poisoned water hole. fred moves towards the podium as the noise dies down.}
<B>__{new angle}
<A>__{barney moves to the wall, where he pulls a rolled up tapestry from a hiding place behind a plant. he tacks it to the wall, yanks a string. it unrolls. it's a big "vote for fred flintstone" poster. barney turns, gives fred a "thumbs up," and as he does, barney's hand brushes against a folded parchment in his pocket. barney pushes his way through the seats, catches up to fred and hands him the document. fred takes it, continues up to the podium. there, the herdmaster hands fred the ceremonial hoof and antler, crossed over each other like a pharaoh's badges of office. fred does a papal like wave with these, sets them down, and unrolls the crib notes barney gave him.}
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(reading, at first}
<D>__{wooden, then}
<P>__{confident)}
<D>__{brother buffaloes, honored herdmaster, junior bucks and apprentice antlers, a great good evening to you all. ahem. as you know, our organization has survived difficult times that have seen the extinction of such other lodges as the order of whooping cranes and brotherhood of giant sloths. but we here have come through the croo ... the crux...}
<C>__{barney}
<P>__{(hissing)}
<D>__{ crucible }
<C>__{fred}
<P>__{(grateful)}
<D>__{ crucible with our fur fluffy and our hooves unscathed. now, the future holds many promises and many problems. as your next herdmaster, i would bring to you the same determination, courage and if i may say so bold thinking that i have brought to the workplace. thank you, and ack ack a dack.}
<A>__{applause follows fred's return to the floor.}
<B>__{piltdown and pyrite}
<A>__{the only ones in their row not clapping, they scowl as fred passes them...}
