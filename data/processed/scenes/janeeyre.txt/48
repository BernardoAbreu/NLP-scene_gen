<L>__{interior night. morton jane's cottage.}
<A>__{jane's first home is like a doll's house. she walks through it from the whitewashed bedroom with its little single bed, through the parlour with its tiny fireplace into the scullery kitchen. she retraces her steps back into the parlour. she turns round and surveys it. silence but for the crackling of the fire and the blowing of the wind. she feels glad, grateful, but very, very alone. she hears brocklehurst's voice.}
