<L>__{interior high school classroom day}
<A>__{todd snaps out of his daydream. his trigonometry class is having an examination. he sits at his desk, staring blankly at the paper before him. most of the answer spaces are empty. he knows he is going to fail another test.}
<L>__{exterior outooor shooting range day}
<A>__{todd is blasting away, rapid firing the rifle down range at an unfortunate paper target. the protective headphones lay on the counter beside him, as does his backpack. he stops shooting when a voice snaps over the p.a. speaker next to him.}
<C>__{voice }
<D>__{you, on lane twelve. you need to have your headgear on at all times. (click) and no rapid firing.}
<A>__{todd looks over at the man frowning at him from inside a small booth. todd puts on the headgear, and after a moment, the man goes back to reading a newspaper. todd looks up and down the range. one or two other shooters are concentrating on their targets. todd quickly hoists his rifle up and aims it at the man in the booth. he snaps off a single dry round. todd smiles weakly at the sound of the click. unnoticed by anyone, he turns back toward the target, strangely comforted.}
