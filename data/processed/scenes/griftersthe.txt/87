<L>__{interior cole's office day}
<A>__{myra and hebbing enter an office decorated with sleekly understated opulence; the view through large windows is of apparently prosperous skyscrapers. cole, a plausible rich businessman, happily greets myra.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{mary beth! as beautiful as ever.}
<A>__{he lifts a dubious eyebrow toward hebbing.}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(gentle disapproval)}
<D>__{i see you brought a friend.}
<A>__{as mary beth, myra has a faint southern belle accent and a clinging flirtatiousness.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{mister hebbing is my bodyguard, my strong right arm. gloucester hebbing, may i present my fine stockbroker, henry fellowes.}
<A>__{the men shake hands, hebbing open and pleased and dignified, cole clearly holding something back.}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(to myra; gentle warning)}
<D>__{mary beth, what we have here, uh...}
<C>__{myra}
<P>__{(gaily innocent)}
<D>__{oh, i told mister hebbing all about it, how brilliant you are at making money for your special clients!}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(alarmed)}
<D>__{mary beth, i hope you aren't spreading this good news too widely.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{well, of course not! i know how dangerous this is. but i would trust mister hebbing with anything.}
<P>__{(to hebbing; suggestive)}
<D>__{wouldn't i, darling?}
<A>__{while hebbing looks manly and flustered and pleased, cole brings from under his desk a partially full gray canvas sack marked federal reserve bank.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{well, i will have to take your word for it, mary beth. here's your money.}
<C>__{myra}
<P>__{(innocent avarice)}
<D>__{goody!}
<A>__{myra opens her attache case on the desk. cole takes banded stacks of bills from the sack, packs them neatly in the case. hebbing tries not to look envious and impressed. hebbing's pov: the top bill in each stack is a hundred. previous shot. myra takes a stack, riffles it for hebbing's benefit.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{isn't that just beautiful?}
<C>__{hebbing}
<D>__{yes, it is.}
<A>__{myra returns the stack to the case, talks to cole.}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{henry, next time, couldn't mister hebbing }
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(shocked)}
<D>__{mary beth! this has never been anything but }
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{oh, i know, i know, and you've been wonderful since i was widowed. but mister hebbing has }
<P>__{(to hebbing)}
<D>__{ you don't mind my telling him, darling }
<P>__{(to cole)}
<D>__{ suffered reverses. if he could...}
<A>__{she gestures vaguely, unable to describe the situation accurately. hebbing fills in, bluff and hearty.}
<C>__{hebbing}
<D>__{top up the tanks, as it were. until this little glitch in the oil economy comes to an end.}
<P>__{(man to man laugh)}
<D>__{not that i understand exactly what you do, not from mary beth's explanation.}
<A>__{cole broods, studying hebbing, deciding at last to trust him.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{well. if mary beth vouches for you, and if she told you the story already...}
<C>__{myra}
<P>__{(girlish laugh)}
<D>__{so here we are!}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(solemn)}
<D>__{mister hebbing, we are talking about breaking the law here, i want to be sure you understand that. no one gets hurt, but the law does get broken.}
<C>__{hebbing}
<P>__{(a real sport; laughing)}
<D>__{well, that's what the law's for, isn't it?}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(still serious)}
<D>__{and i don't just mean the sec. we could have the fbi breathing down our necks.}
<C>__{hebbing}
<P>__{(suddenly serious)}
<D>__{i certainly hope not.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{loose talk is the one thing i worry about.}
<C>__{hebbing}
<D>__{i can keep my mouth shut, mister fellowes.}
<A>__{describing the scheme, cole becomes increasingly enthusiastic.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{okay, then. sit down, sit down.}
<A>__{hebbing sits on the sofa, myra beside him, holding his arm in both of hers. cole paces, describing.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{the tokyo exchange is nine hours ahead of us, new york one hour behind. there isn't one hour of the day when both are open. information moves, but it has to wait. now, we have a young fellow working here do you know what a hacker is, mister hebbing?}
<C>__{hebbing}
<D>__{one of those computer geniuses, isn't it?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{you're right! and this boy tapped into that main link between tokyo and the new york stock exchange. he can give us, when it's really useful, a seven second delay in that movement of information. do you know what that means?}
<A>__{hebbing doesn't want to admit ignorance.}
<C>__{hebbing}
<D>__{well, you've got your information ahead of new york, i see that.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{every once in a while, a major change comes through. we have seven seconds to take advantage, put our buy order, our sell order, into the computer in new york before the tokyo data comes in.}
<C>__{hebbing}
<D>__{not much time.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{we have to be ready. we have to have the money, and we have to know what the information means, and we have to move immediately.}
<C>__{hebbing}
<P>__{(impressed)}
<D>__{seven seconds. i don't see how you do it.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{these machines they're in here.}
<A>__{cole crosses to an inner door, pushes it partway open, looks back grinning with his hand on the knob.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{want a look?}
<C>__{myra}
<D>__{oh, henry, no, that's just boring.}
