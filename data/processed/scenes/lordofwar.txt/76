<L>__{exterior hill overlooking odessa harbor. day.}
<A>__{the pov from a pair of binoculars in the crosshairs, jack valentine, at a surprise checkpoint, staring through binoculars of his own.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{who are you?}
<A>__{yuri, on his belly to avoid detection, slithers back to the roadway hands the binoculars to a young soldier. dmitri stands beside the convoy of trucks parked barely out of view of the checkpoint, including yuri's mercedes and a huge open bed tractor trailer carrying a russian hind helicopter gunship.}
<C>__{yuri }
<P>__{(angrily to dmitri)}
<D>__{i thought we were supposed to be watching for these checkpoints.}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{how can i? you keep selling my helicopters. you're too greedy, yuri.}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(anxious)}
<D>__{we have to go back.}
<A>__{dmitri regards the trucks, each one longer than the road is wide.}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{we'll be going in reverse. we can't turn around for a mile.}
<A>__{the young soldier on lookout calls to them.}
<C>__{young soldier}
<D>__{they're coming.}
<A>__{yuri grabs the binoculars. sure enough, valentine and his agents are climbing into their interpol jeeps and driving towards them.}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{we shoot it out?}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{and start an international fucking incident no, no, no.}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{so we run.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{no. i've got paperwork.}
<C>__{dmitri}
<P>__{(protesting)}
<D>__{not for the gunship. yuri, you know the penalty for sanction busting selling a military helicopter?}
<A>__{yuri gazes at the russian mi 24v helicopter gunship, bristling with armaments.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{it's not a military helicopter. it's a rescue helicopter.}
<A>__{yuri turns to the boy referred to as "tech support".}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{get to work, son.}
<A>__{the boy pulls a wrench from his pocket.}
<B>__{several minutes later}
<A>__{the interpol jeeps crest the rise and pull in front of the convoy valentine and his agents exit, guns drawn. dmitri and the ukrainian soldiers stiffen, their weapons also at the ready. an uneasy stand off. yuri gestures for calm. he greets valentine warmly offers his hand.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{yuri orlov.}
<A>__{in reply, an interpol agent unceremoniously slams yuri into the side of his truck.}
<C>__{valentine}
<P>__{(flashing id)}
<D>__{papers.}
<A>__{again yuri waves off dmitri and his men, about to come to his aid. yuri courteously hands over his passport and other documentation to the skeptical valentine.}
<C>__{valentine }
<P>__{(regarding the photo closely)}
<D>__{mr. orlov, always in the wrong place at the right time. we've met before. off the coast of colombia.}
<P>__{(feigning memory loss)}
<D>__{what was the name of that freighter i can't remember. was it the kono or the kristol?}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(hesitates, he's actually forgotten)}
<D>__{the crew called that vessel a lot of names none of them repeatable in polite company.}
<A>__{valentine turns his attention to the helicopter now devoid of its weapons. an interpol agent escorts yuri at gunpointerior}
<C>__{yuri }
<P>__{(noting to the gun in his ribs)}
<D>__{the new mp 5. do you need a silencer for that?}
<A>__{valentine ignores the banter, inspects yuri's documentation.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{the end user certificate for this aircraft states burkina faso. nice. did you type it yourself?}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{it's for humanitarian missions.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{you're a humanitarian?}
<A>__{yuri shrugs why not?}
<C>__{valentine }
<P>__{(not buying it for a second)}
<D>__{this is a killing machine.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{not any more.}
<C>__{dmitri}
<P>__{(in broken english)}
<D>__{listen to the nephew.}
<A>__{it's true. yuri has had the armaments detached.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{didn't you get the memo? the war's over. what can they do with military hardware but convert to civilian use?}
<C>__{dmitri}
<D>__{what, yes?}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(trying to lighten the mood)}
<D>__{the only way you could die from this baby is if a food drop hits you.}
<A>__{valentine's face hardens at the flippant remark. still at gunpoint, yuri is escorted to the smaller second truck in the convoy. stacked inside the container are the helicopter's hurriedly removed missiles and the boy.}
<C>__{valentine}
<P>__{(referring to the missiles)}
<D>__{also going to burkina faso?}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(pointing to the document)}
<D>__{but to a different client at a different address.}
<A>__{valentine, incensed, throws yuri up against the truck himself.}
<C>__{valentine}
<D>__{what do you take me for? a complete fucking fool?}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(eyeing valentine's gun pressed to his throat)}
<D>__{not complete, sir. and while i hesitate to tell you your job, i must point out that when shipped separately the weapons and the aircraft both comply with the current interpol trade standards and practices.}
<C>__{valentine}
<P>__{(incredulous)}
<D>__{you expect me to believe this is a coincidence?}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{i can see how certain people might interpret it as suspicious but thank god we live in a world where suspicion alone does not constitute a crime.}
<A>__{valentine regards yuri closely this foe is more formidable than he imagined. valentine looks to the gun in his hand, contemplating crossing the line. he finally holsters his gun.}
<C>__{valentine}
<P>__{(tosses the documents on the road)}
<D>__{yuri orlov. you and i are going to be seeing a lot of each other.}
<C>__{yuri}
<D>__{i can hardly wait.}
<C>__{valentine}
<P>__{(climbing into his jeep)}
<D>__{watch out for the time you don't see me.}
<A>__{yuri, dmitri and the boy watch valentine speed away.}
<C>__{boy}
<P>__{(perfect american accent)}
<D>__{what an asshole.}
<A>__{yuri looks to the boy, askance a yuri in the making.}
