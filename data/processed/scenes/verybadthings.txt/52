<D>__{we don't say "love, honor and obey" anymore. and we don't say "till death do us part." today we say, "respect, honor and cherish, as long as you both do love." how does that sound?}
<C>__{liz}
<D>__{i kind of like "till death do us part." i mean, this is forever. in sickness and in health, through good times and bad. honey, what do you think?}
<A>__{liz looks at fisher who is a nuclear wreck, barely coherent.}

<C>__{fisher}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{are we supposed to?}
<C>__{judge tower}
<D>__{it's not a question of supposed to, it's an entirely personal decision... some do some don't.}

<C>__{judge tower}
<D>__{okay great. what will that be?}
