<A>__{nick sits on the steps with the toaster that sal's mother gave him in his lap. it is snowing and from inside the church we hear the choir singing. the sound is massive, deep and dark, like a great river rolling through the night. camera closes on nick. he is staring at something, tears glistening in his eyes.}
