<A>__{will driving. speeding. scenery whipping past the window. his hands, tight around the steering wheel. the hula girl, dancing beneath the rear view mirror, a smile plastered to her face. he grows suddenly pale. pulls the cherokee off to the side.}
<L>__{exterior street continuous}
<A>__{will jumps out of the cherokee, leaving the door open. runs down an alley behind a row of shops.}

<A>__{a couple industrial trash bins. will leans his hand against the wall and vomits. hovers for a moment, saliva dripping from his mouth. braces himself. heaves again. hears a buzzing behind him. turns. a dead dog lying next to a dumpster. flies buzzing around its head. teeth bared. eyes wide open. like it's watching him.}
