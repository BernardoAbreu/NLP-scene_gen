<A>__{the rangers crest a hill and adam, who's in the lead, suddenly drops down the others following suit. they peer over the ridge their eyes wide. before them, a tenuous rope bridge leads to a vast rock landing. the ocean rages below. on top of the island is the nathadian monolith. it's a mind boggling wonder from another time and place. between the rangers and the bridge, the tengu warriors are on patrol.}
