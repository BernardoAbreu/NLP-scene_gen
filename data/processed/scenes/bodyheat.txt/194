<A>__{racine's focus is on the doorknob of the closed door. but he moves past it to the window. the curtains have been carefully drawn across it; it is impossible to see beyond them into the boathouse. except... except for one little slice at the bottom of the window where the curtains are held apart a fraction of an inch by something. racine crouches down to look through the crack. what racine sees. the curtains are being held apart this little bit by a wire. a wire which is attached to the window and runs tautly back into the gloom of the boathouse. racine shifts his head an inch and he can see another wire. it originates from that same spot back in the gloom and runs toward the door, although racine, with this limited view, cannot actually see where the wire is attached. but racine is not really trying racine has rocked back on his heels away from the window. he stands up and steps away from the boathouse. you might call it a stagger.}
