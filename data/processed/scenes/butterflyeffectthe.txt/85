<D>__{i never wanted to be in the movie anyway and it was cold so i wanted to wear my clothes but mr. miller took his shirt off }
<C>__{thumper}
<D>__{what the fuck are you doing?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{shhh! i need quiet for this.}
<A>__{thumper jumps off the bed and snatches the journal away.}
<C>__{thumper}
<D>__{are you stupid or what?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{thumper}
<D>__{shucks, i dunno. but maybe there's a reason why you've repressed the one day when some old lecher had you in your tighty whities, dammit!}
<A>__{thumper begins scanning the journal entry. a bitter laugh.}
<C>__{thumper}
<D>__{yeah, man. i'd think twice about this. you could wake up a lot more fucked up than you are now.}
<A>__{he hands the journal back to evan. evan opens it and begins reading it silently. his hands begin to tremble and he slams the book shut in defeat.}
