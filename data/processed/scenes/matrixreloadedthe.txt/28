<A>__{agents jones and brown sit across from each other, a steel table between them. they stare at each other for what seems like a long time. there is a speaker phone in the middle of the table amidst neat stacks of file folders.}
<C>__{agent jones}
<D>__{our defeat is worrisome.}
<C>__{agent brown}
<D>__{as is the loss of our colleague.}
<A>__{they are both seething with anger. agent jones grinds his molars.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{we cant defeat them. you saw what happened.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{we have a backup copy of agent smith...}
<A>__{jones stands and walks toward the massive panoramic window. the city}
<D>__{spreads before him.}
<C>__{jones}
<A>__{"a backup is not good enough. we need to upgrade ourselves to meet the}
<D>__{new threat." brown opens a large file folder.}
<C>__{brown}
<A>__{"hes being rebuilt. but i have an alternate plan. why fight the}
<D>__{humans, when we can let them fight for us?"}
<C>__{jones}
<A>__{"the terrorists have learned to bend our reality in ways we cannot.}
<D>__{this was the cause of our defeat."}
<C>__{brown}
<A>__{"mr. thomas j. anderson is not unique. over the decades, many humans have developed... techniques for manipulating the matrix. techniques}
<D>__{too primitive for us to understand. most never realize their}
<A>__{potential, but all the ones weve noticed exhibiting these talents are}
<D>__{recorded here."}
<A>__{angle on the book as brown flips through. street shots of people from all walks of life. young rebels, corporate suits, junkies, housewives.}
<D>__{jones turns on agent brown.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{do you have anyone in mind?}
<A>__{angle on the book. it stops on a page dedicated to someone who looks like neo, but with long hair and an extremely bad attitude. there are photos of him on a motorcycle with a blonde, photos of him drinking with his gang friends.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{gregory lowfield. he exhibits the traits we saw in mr. anderson.}
<C>__{mans voice }
<A>__{"mr. anderson no longer exists. our enemy now is the one called...}
<C>__{neo."}
<D>__{angle on: the door}
<A>__{agent smith walks in, grinning. there is a new swag to his walk, and his hair is longer, tied back.}
<C>__{brown}
<D>__{youve been recreated.}
<A>__{smith flexes his arm, examines his hands, and feels his hair.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{and you have more hair.}
<A>__{smith turns to him, examines the photos on the table. they lock eyes. on the same wavelength, they transfer knowledge without speaking. smith looks at the photo on the table.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{i know what youre thinking. what we need is our own neo...}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{if its possible.}
<C>__{smith}
<D>__{ill make it possible.}
<A>__{we zoom in on the grainy photo of neos doppledanger. quiet at first, growing louder as it grows dark, we here the rumble and roar of motorcycles.}
