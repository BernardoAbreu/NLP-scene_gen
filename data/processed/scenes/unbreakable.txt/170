<L>__{interior master bedroom night}
<A>__{the man in the orange one piece uniform stands over the woman tied to the door handle of the bathroom. his back is to us. he's drinking from a beer bottle as he looks down at her. he doesn't notice the third presence come into the room. he doesn't hear him move closer. right behind him. the man in orange takes another sip of his beer, not realizing an arm is reaching over him... he doesn't get to swallow the sip in his mouth. david dunne's powerful arm wraps around the man's thick neck. david's hands clamp together like and iron vise. he squeezes. the man's beer bottle crashes to the ground as his neck begins to get crushed. david yanks back hard, pulls the man off balance. the man's legs push back violently, sending both of them backwards across the room. they come to a hard stop as david's back gets rammed into the bedroom wall. the huge man in orange pulls away and then slams david harder against the wall. david's arm remains locked around his throat. the man becomes frantic. his face turning dark red. he clutches at david's arm. he spins, taking david with him into another wall. the impact is tremendous. the room shakes. david holds on. his face bent low and hidden under his hood. and then the man in orange throws a powerful elbow back. it lands hard right in david's side. david groans. the huge man delivers another one. savage, desperate blows. we hear the impact of each one with david's body. and david never lets go. the elbows slow and then stop. the legs of the man in orange start to buckle. david pulls him back onto his heels. he turns him in a half circle. all of his tremendous weight is hanging from david's arm now. david lets out a yell as he applies all his strength. the man's legs stop kicking. david keeps turning him. the man's body goes completely limp. david's just dragging two hundred and seventy five pounds of weight in a circle over the carpet now. david slowly comes to a stop. he stands there with his arm wrapped around the man's neck....the man's limbs dangle down to the ground. beat. david's hands let go of each other. his arm slips out from under the man's jaw. the man in orange crumples to the ground like a rag doll. the only sound in the room is david's heavy breathing. beat. he moves to the woman slumped against the door. he starts to untie the phone cords that bind her wrists to the handle. he whispers to her.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's over now.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{your children are fine. they're getting help.}
<A>__{he unties her wrists. her arms stay above her head where they were.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i'm going to go now.}
<A>__{he stares at the woman whose eyes stare blankly at him. she sits unnaturally still against the door with her arms above her head. the mascara that has run down her face and dried, has tracks where countless tears have rolled down. david moves his hand near her mouth and nose. he checks for the feeling of breath against his hand. beat. he rises up. removes his hood. david dunne stands silently in the master bedroom of someone's house and gazes at the dead woman frozen in a slumped position against her bathroom door.}
