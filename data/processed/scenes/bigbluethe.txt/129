<A>__{jacques' room looks like a diving equipment storage room with a bed in it. jacques notices johana's gaze.}
<C>__{jacques}
<P>__{(solicitously)}
<D>__{you think it'll be all right? you'll be comfortable here?}
<C>__{johana}

<C>__{johana}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{we get the picture, roberto.}
<P>__{(looks over her shoulder)}
<D>__{jacques, i think louis needs help.}
<A>__{jacques turns around. uncle louis is a few yards behind them at a fish stand on the dock. he's holding up an eel and screaming at the fishmonger.}
<C>__{uncle louis}
<P>__{(yelling)}
<D>__{two dollars for this! this fish wasn't caught. it died of cancer!}
<A>__{jacques shrugs his shoulders and gives up on the idea of interfering.}
<C>__{roberto}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{here he comes!}
<A>__{a speed boat races along the water. it's a beautiful highly varnished mahogany riva. it races into the port. standing at the helm, looking like christopher columbus his hair brushed back by the wind, is enzo. next to him hanging on to the windscreen is an impressive six foot, dark haired beauty. she has a scarf over her hair. she wears a purple leather micro mini with a cerise halter top and her ruby fingernails are three inches long. if she ever actually would get cast in a movie, she'd make raquel welch hide in shame. her stage name is bonita}
<B>__{mariposa.}
<A>__{enzo kills the throttle, swings the speedboat into a perfect landing at the dock. roberto takes the lines.}

<P>__{(meaning the speed boat)}
<D>__{where did you get that?}
<C>__{enzo}
<P>__{(meaning bonita)}
<D>__{"that"! this is not a "that"... this is bonita mariposa, the famous spanish actress.}
<P>__{(whispering to bonita)}
<D>__{... who is going to be careful with the varnish...}
<P>__{(back to roberto)}
<D>__{and who has come to spend a few days with us.}
<P>__{(and very quickly)}
<D>__{where's mamma?}
<C>__{roberto}
<P>__{(checking watch)}
<D>__{you have eight hours before she gets here.}
<A>__{enzo glances at his watch and sighs with relief. bonita says hello to jacques, kisses johana.}
