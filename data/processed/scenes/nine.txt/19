<A>__{this stops guido. he doesn't answer. we see a bead of sweat running down the back of guido's neck. everyone waits.}

<A>__{as the number progresses, guido gets up from his chair and begins to scale the enormous heights of his unfinished set, with great effort.}
<C>__{guido}
<D>__{i can hardly stay up and i can't get to sleep, and i don't want to wake tomorrow morning, at the bottom of some heap but why take it so seriously? after all, there's nothing at stake here only me i want to be young. and i want to be old. i would like to be wise before my time and yet be foolish and brash and bold. i would like the universe to get down on its knees and say, "guido, whatever you please, it's okay even if it's impossible, we'll arrange it." that's all that i want.}
