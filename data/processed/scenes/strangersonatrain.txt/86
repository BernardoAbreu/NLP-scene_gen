<L>__{interior antony living room late morning}
<A>__{anne and mrs. antony are in the middle of a conversation. anne's manner is tense and purposeful, mrs. antony's much less serious.}
<C>__{mrs. antony}
<D>__{oh, now, miss burton, really! i know bruno's been in some very awkward scrapes, but nothing so ridiculous as a murder.}
<P>__{(she gives a short little laugh)}
<C>__{anne}
<P>__{(desperately)}
<D>__{but, mrs. antony, you've got to make him do something about this. don't you see that just one word from him would extricate guy from this dreadful situation?}
<C>__{mrs. antony}
<P>__{(lightly)}
<D>__{oh, but miss burton, i'm sure this thing must be some practical joke. you know, bruno sometimes goes too far.}
<P>__{(girl to girl)}
<D>__{of course i shouldn't be saying this to an outsider, but sometimes he's terribly irresponsible and gets into all kinds of escapades.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{but don't you understand, mrs. antony your son is responsible for a woman's death.}
<C>__{mrs. antony}
<P>__{(drawing herself up with some hauteur)}
<D>__{did bruno tell you this?}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{of course not, mrs. antony.}
<C>__{mrs. antony}
<P>__{(that settles it)}
<D>__{well, there you are.}
<C>__{mrs. antony }
<P>__{(she sighs and rises, winding it up)}
<D>__{well, miss burton, it was very nice of you to call. you must excuse me now. i must get back to my painting. do you care for painting, miss burton? i find it so soothing.}
<P>__{(shakes anne's hand)}
<D>__{you must come again sometime.}
<A>__{she goes out. anne is left helpless, standing in the middle of the room. she picks up her purse and is about to go when she hears a voice:}
<C>__{bruno's voice}
<D>__{oh, miss burton!}
<A>__{anne turns back in direction of the voice. camera pulls back until we can see the feet of bruno protruding from behind a chair in which he is sitting. he has obviously heard the entire conversation between anne and his mother. bruno rises. he is in dressing gown and pajamas.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{i'm afraid mother wasn't very helpful, was she?}
<P>__{(he strolls toward anne)}
<D>__{you know she hasn't been well for a long time. she's a little how shall i say confused.}
<P>__{(shakes his head commiseratingly)}
<D>__{poor mother.}
<A>__{anne is too stunned to speak.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{you know, i'm very upset with guy. he shouldn't have sent you on an errand like this.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{guy doesn't know i'm here, mr. antony.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{he's been leading you up the garden path, i'm afraid. he must be very desperate to try to involve me. i've been protecting him ever since we had that conversation on the train and he told me how he hated his wife.}
<A>__{bruno is now standing near the window a little apart from anne, with his back to him. he takes something out of the pocket of his dressing gown and looks down at it in his hand. it is guy's lighter. suddenly he stuffs it back his pocket and turn back to anne.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{why, do you know, miss burton, he tried to get me to go back to the island one night after dark and pick up his lighter so the police wouldn't find it? he dropped it there, you know, when well, that night.}
<A>__{anne's horror is growing.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{the whole thing's been worrying me so much. but of course i couldn't do it, miss burton. it would have been too risky. and besides, it would have made me an accessory.}
<A>__{anne stares at this insane man and sinks on the settee. she starts to cry in sheer frustration. bruno goes to her sympathetically.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{miss burton, i know how you feel.}
<A>__{he puts his hand on her shoulder. anne flings it off. there is an awkward pause as bruno looks down at her. then he begins to look around restlessly.}
<C>__{bruno}
<D>__{miss burton, you must excuse me. i have an urgent appointment.}
<P>__{(looks it his watch)}
<D>__{i must go up and change. now, i really must go...if you'll excuse me...}
<A>__{he turns, starts out of the room and up the stairs in the hall. anne watches him. stairway from anne's viewpoint bruno turns and waves to anne from the landing, then goes on up the stairs.}
