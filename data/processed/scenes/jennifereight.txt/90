<L>__{90: interior living room. house. night.}
<A>__{the music is puccini. part one act two the humming chorus from madam butterfly. giant close of the spinning cassette. the cam era remains close as it explores the room. candle light & fire light. along a mantlepiece. eleven thirty five on a clock. two christmas cards. several photographs from the happy years. one a picture of ross & berlin in uniform. another features berlin with his arm around a beautiful young lady with long dark hair. for a moment it could be helena? but the camera's already gone. helena cuddles knees in the corner of a sofa. looks considerab ly more relaxed. but there's a tension here and both are aware of it. stifled yawns. she stares at him and berlin stares back. a billion people in love have been through this. it's bed time. [a suggestion of berlin's bed to be is heaped in pillows blank ets at the end of the couch.] "come on, i will take you up there." she finds his hand and stands. the music follows them upstairs.}
