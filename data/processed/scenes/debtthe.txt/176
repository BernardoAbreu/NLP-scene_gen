<L>__{interior locker room bathroom day}
<A>__{a long, white tiled corridor of a room. a row of windows down the right, under which sit washbasins. there's a row of lockers and doors along the left. rachel walks on, feeling increasingly as if she's in a dream. she's deep into the room before she realises it's a dead end there's no exit ahead of her.}
<C>__{vogel}
<P>__{(a dull rasp)}
<D>__{why did you come...?}
<A>__{she turns and freezes. vogel has emerged from one of the doorways on the left. now he's between her and the doors on the far side of the room.}
<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{why did you have to come? you didn't have to follow me.}
<A>__{he begins to advance slowly towards her.}
<C>__{vogel }
<D>__{was it schevchuk? did he talk?}
<A>__{rachel stands frozen as he creeps closer. he reaches out a hand as if to reassure her, a ghastly attempt at reasonableness.}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{i can stop him. i won't tell him anymore. (almost pleading) nobody needs to know.}
<A>__{as if the spell has broken rachel makes a sudden dart for the doors. but before she can pass him, vogel has moved with surprising speed and, almost before rachel has seen the scissors in his other hand, he has stabbed them into her shoulder. she reels over against the opposite wall, dislodging a glass shelf which shatters into a washbasin behind her. vogel goes after her, pinning her against the basin, one hand on her throat, the other hand trying to stab her again. rachel manages to grab the scissor hand and the two struggle frantically. the scissors inch closer to her face, to her eye. her other hand emerges from the basin behind her holding a piece of the broken glass shelf, which she whips across vogel's face. he gives a horrible shriek and lets her go, clutching at his cheek. rachel collapses gasping to the floor. moaning, vogel stumbles to a basin, blood dripping down onto the white porcelain from his slashed face. he suddenly notices rachel has made it to her knees and is trying to crawl towards the door, he walks after her, pulls back her head, gets ready to stab the scissors into her throat.}
<C>__{vogel}
<D>__{you jews never knew how to kill. only how to die.}
<A>__{then he gives a gasp of pain, eyes closed, his whole body doubling with the pain, hands weakly scrabbling at the piece of glass rachel has stabbed into his thigh. he falls, almost on top of rachel, and she finds herself pressed against his contorted face as he hisses and spits in agony. his hand searches blindly for the dropped scissors. rachel grapples with him, almost embracing him, apparently trying to prevent him for reaching it. his searching hand locates the scissors and his eyes open in triumph, staring straight into rachel's. he raises the scissors above his head. then he stabs rachel in the stomach. rachel jack knifes, as if she's been punched. then...nothing. both lie still. the only sound is vogel's rasping breathing. slowly vogel gathers himself, drops the scissors, gets onto his knees the victor. he climbs to his feet and begins to limp towards the door.}
