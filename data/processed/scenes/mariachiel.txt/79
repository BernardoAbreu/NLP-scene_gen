<L>__{exterior moco's ranch day}
<A>__{moco is sitting in his pool. a swimming waiter is bringing him drinks.}
<C>__{moco}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{amigo! i'm glad i've reached you! you've not answered all day. killing ten of my men must have been very time consuming!}
<C>__{azul}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{six.}
<C>__{moco}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{azul}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{i've only killed six! you were always bad at math, moco. i guess that's why you never paid me half of the money. you thought it all belonged to you.}
<C>__{moco}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{i knew half was yours... i got greedy, my friend. it's my nature. but you!!! you are modest! you've killed ten of my men!! i know, because i'm having them buried in my yard right now. with my dogs and cats.}
<C>__{azul}
<P>__{(counting on his fingers, into phone)}
<D>__{i killed six. but don't bother counting so soon. the number will triple by tomorrow.}
<C>__{moco}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{i'm sorry things turned out this way. my friend. i got greedy. i should never have tried to kill you. it would have been cheaper for me to pay you. now i've got to find ten new men.}
<C>__{azul}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{six.}
<C>__{moco}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{ten.}
<C>__{azul}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{i tell you what. you give me my money, and i won't kill any more of your men... and i won't kill you.}
<C>__{moco}
<P>__{(takes a sip, into phone)}
<D>__{no, it's too late for that. we're going to have to see this through.}
<C>__{azul}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{just like the moco i used to know. still wearing white?}
<C>__{moco}
<P>__{(looking down at his clothes, into phone)}
<D>__{what do you think?}
<C>__{azul}
<P>__{(into phone)}
<D>__{i think you should change clothes. i'd hate to ruin a white suit with your stupid blood.}
<A>__{azul hangs up. he gets dressed and leaves. the little rats are about to follow, but one rat walks over to get one look at the girls. the girls tease him, and when he tries to advance them, they pull guns and laugh as the rat runs away.}
