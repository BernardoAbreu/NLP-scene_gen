<L>__{interior laura's car night}
<A>__{they drive sort of aimlessly through laura's old neighborhood. laura sees something on her left, and makes a sudden turn up a narrow road through some overgrown trees. they come to a stop in a formerly paved clearing, looking out on a field with an old abandoned school on the other side. laura shuts down the engine.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{when are you going back?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i don't know. sometime. later. listen, rob, would you have sex with me?}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i want to feel something else than this. it's either that or i go home and put my hand in the fire. unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i've only got a couple left. i'm saving them for later.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{it'll have to be sex, then.}
<A>__{she pulls herself over him, staddling him in the passenger seat and kissing his neck. she pauses and regards him from above.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{hello. it doesn't seem so long ago that i looked at you from here.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i knew there was a reason i wore a skirt today.}
<A>__{laura reaches down and unzips his pants, as they keep kissing.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{you know, with ray...}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{oh, rob, we're not going to go through that again.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{no, no. it's not... are you still on the pill?}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{yes, of course. there's nothing to worry about.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{i didn't mean that. i mean... was that all you used?}
<A>__{laura looks at him, motionless, then begins to cry.}
<C>__{rob}
<D>__{look, we can do other things.}
<C>__{laura}
<D>__{i lived with you. you were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried i might kill you, and you're entitled to worry. isn't that a terrible thing? isn't that sad?}
<A>__{she rolls off of him into her seat. they sit there in silence, watching the rain run down the windshield.}
