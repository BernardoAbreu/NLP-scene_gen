<A>__{meyerling's dodge truck pulls up. anne marie comes outside. her smile wilts when she sees it's not eric. as meyerling climbs the embankment to the turtle, he glances at wilder's snowmobile parked alongside the turtle.}
<C>__{meyerling}
<D>__{i've been trying to raise you on the shortwave for two days.}
<A>__{he pushes past anne marie and goes into the turtle.}
<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{have you talked to eric?}
<C>__{meyerling}
<D>__{i have not, but i very much want to. what do you know about the trouble in devil's cauldron?}
<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{i was hoping you had some news }
<C>__{meyerling}
<D>__{ get this straight: i'm the district supervisor. whatever you do reflects on me. it wasn't my idea to bring you people up here, but i'm stuck with you. you are absolutely not to involve yourself in any local disputes. whichever side you take, you alienate the other. mr. corbett is quite well known in this region. people admire him }
<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{ corbett's a killer.}
<C>__{meyerling}
<D>__{i don't care if ben corbett makes meatloaf out of nuns and babies, he's not your concern. understood?}
<A>__{anne marie just glares at him. meyerling examines the damaged shortwave.}
<C>__{meyerling}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{what happened here?}
<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{the radio's on the fritz.}
<C>__{meyerling}
<D>__{where'd you say eric is?}
<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{somewhere along the pipeline.}
<C>__{meyerling}
<D>__{what about that hotheaded marshal, sam wilder? i heard he was in the middle of this mess.}
<C>__{anne marie}
<D>__{sam? we haven't seen him.}
<C>__{meyerling}
<D>__{really. i thought maybe that was his snowmobile outside.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{by the way your truck also 'on the fritz?'}
<C>__{anne marie}
<P>__{(blanching)}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{meyerling}
<D>__{it's out by the pumping station, shot full of holes.}
<A>__{noting anne marie's distressed reaction to this news, he crosses to the door.}
<C>__{meyerling}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{still nothing to tell me?}
<P>__{(no reply)}
<D>__{suit yourself.}
