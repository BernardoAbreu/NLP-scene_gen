<C>__{darian}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{because he doesn't fuck up.}
<A>__{she goes into her room and shuts the door. hallenbeck rubs his eyes. leans against the wall, exhausted.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{you know, for fifty bucks you could get a guy to pull out her fingernails with a pair of pliers.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{no. anything that much fun, i'd want to do myself.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i think we could both use a drink.}
<A>__{hallenbeck crosses to a cabinet, breaks out a bottle of seagrams. swigs. hands it to jimmy. as jimmy drinks, he notices a photo on the wall: hallenbeck shaking hands with george bush.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{that's you?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}

<D>__{yeah, and the last thing i did was cheat on her.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{why do people cheat, joe?}

<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{ooooooh. very deep.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{so deep i don't know what the fuck it means.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{it means another drink is required.}
<A>__{he raises the bottle.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{alex the accountant.}
<A>__{he drinks. hallenbeck frowns, watching him.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}

<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{no. but he could have been.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{alex was my son.}
<A>__{hallenbeck stares at him.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i was married at 19. sweet young thing, looking to get out from under daddy's thumb. i didn't know she was a junkie. all during her pregnancy. shooting up. there were complications. she died. alex lived for seventeen minutes in the incubator. fell asleep. died before he woke up.}
<P>__{(takes a drink)}
<D>__{he was born... he had time for one dream... and then he died. i wonder what his dream was about.}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{i'm sorry.}

<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{he would have been a great ball player. like his dad.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{no. he had to die, joe. don't you see?}
<C>__{hallenbeck}
<D>__{why did he have to die?}
