<L>__{exterior hillside another angle day}
<A>__{it is the body of a young squire, handsomely dressed in the livery of his master. such a squire would follow his knight into battle, guiding him through the chaos. but this boy seems to have died a less public, more furtive death. he lies leaning against a rock, eyes open, an expression something like a smile on his face. there is no sign of a wound. hector looks around at the ground.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{no sign of a battle... only a few horses... or just one. he wasn't killed in a fight.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{poor boy. isn't he fine looking. look at his shoes.}
<A>__{there is a sadness about this young death in such a lonely place. hector and beatrice are open to this sad ness, but in their age sentiment was of a tougher strain.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{we'll cover his eyes at least... so the crows don't get him. look at these shoes, though.}
<A>__{she is already gathering stones. hector sees what beatrice is doing.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{that's good of you.}
<A>__{as he lays him down hector sees a small, dry wound on the boy's side. beatrice brings her armful of stones and starts to build a mound around the squire's head. hector helps her by gathering stones from the stream. soon they have covered his head completely with stones, his body lying exposed.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{it's all we can do. it won't keep the wolves away though.}
<A>__{beatrice is still taken by the boy's shoes.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{his feet are like mine, you know. i will give you mine, poor boy, and i will have yours. i have more walking to do.}
<A>__{she looks at hector.}
<C>__{beatrice}
<D>__{it's not stealing if i give him mine, is it?}
<A>__{hector watches as beatrice exchanges her old shoes for the squire's. they fit her well, and she proudly shows them off to hector. he smiles at her.}
