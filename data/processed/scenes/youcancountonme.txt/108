<L>__{interior bank. morning}
<A>__{sammy, coat on, arrives at her desk and puts her purse down. there's a note on her chair. "sammy please see me."}
<L>__{interior bank hallway. a moment later}
<A>__{tracking sammy, coat off, carrying a stack of folders, as she walks from her desk, around the corner, down the hall, past a couple of employees and to brian's open door. she taps on it. brian is at his desk.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{morning.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{yeah, good morning. could you get the door?}
<A>__{outside the office: sammy shuts the door. mabel and doris, standing near the door, look at each other: i.e., sammy's in trouble again. inside the office: sammy stands by the closed door. brian comes out around his desk.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{listen i just }
<A>__{brian kisses her. she drops her folders and they make out against the door. outside the office: the employees click away at their pcs. mabel exchanges a quiet word with chuck. inside the office: brian has sammy pressed against the wall with her skirt hiked up and is trying to get both of their underwear out of the way. it's not so easy in their office clothes. sammy tears away.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{brian, that's enough.}
<A>__{brian falls back, breathless.}
<C>__{brian}
<D>__{ok. sorry.}
<A>__{he lunges at her again. they kiss some more. outside the office. a moment later: sammy comes out of the office, more or less composed, carrying her folders. she heads down the hall past the other employees, including mabel, and surreptitiously readjusts her scrunched up underwear.}
