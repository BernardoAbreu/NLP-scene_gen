<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{i guess you don't get bothered by neighbors much.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{don't worry about that. you'll have total solitude so you can concentrate on your work.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{great.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{annie in the doorway, carrying reams of typing paper, pencils, pens and sharpener.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{paul, watching her it's all kind of amazing. she hands him a box of typing paper.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{i got you this expensive paper to type on.}
<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{paul, looking at the paper. it's corrasable bond. an idea hits him; he masks it as best he can.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(putting the rest of}
<D>__{the paper on the}
<P>__{table)}
<D>__{and i got a great deal on this fifty pound clunker on account of it's missing an "n." i told the saleslady "n" was one of the letters in my favorite writer's name.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it's two of the letters in my favorite nurse's name, annie.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(embarrassed, blushing)}
<D>__{you fooler...!}
<P>__{(turns, grabs up pens, pencils, paper)}
<D>__{did i do good?}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(gesturing to the box of paper)}
<D>__{you did great, except there's just one little thing i can't work with this paper. it's corrasable bond, it smudges. maybe you could go back into town and bring me some white, long grained mimeo.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{but mine cost the most so i don't see how it could smudge.}
<C>__{paul}
<P>__{(quickly taking a}
<D>__{sheet of paper, making}
<P>__{a pencil mark on it)}
<D>__{c'mere, i will show you.}
<A>__{as she approaches, he rubs his thumb over the pencil mark.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(looking at it)}
<D>__{well, it does smudge after all isn't that fascinating?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{i thought you'd be interested. i'd like you to be in on everything, annie. not just the finished book, but how it's written.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{thank you for thinking of me.}
<P>__{(she can be so charming when she wants)}
<D>__{anything else i can get while i'm in town? any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? would you like a tiny tape recorder? or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{no, just the paper will be fine.}
<C>__{annie}
<P>__{(suddenly very agitated)}
<D>__{are you sure? 'cause if you want, i will bring back the whole store for you.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{annie, what's the matter?}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{what's the matter? i will tell you what's the matter. i go out of my way for you. i do everything to try and make you happy. i feed you, i clean you, i dress you. and what thanks do i get? "you bought the wrong paper, annie. i can't write on this paper, annie." well, i will get your stupid paper, but you just better start showing me a little more appreciation around here, mister man.}
<A>__{with that, she throws the ream of paper in paul's lap, causing considerable pain.}
