<L>__{interior mr. gumb's cellar day (dim light)}
<A>__{close on the needle of the victrola, on the spinning record, as mr. gumb's fingers lift away. music continues in background.}
<C>__{mr. gumb }
<P>__{(calling out)}
<D>__{preeeeecious...!}
<A>__{close on the moth cage, as mr. gumb's fingers search through the humus, and find a plump new cocoon, lifting it out. the door of the cage is left open, and one or two of the adult moths flutter out.}
<C>__{mr. gumb }
<D>__{precious, come on precious! busy busy day today...}
<A>__{close on a clean towel, beside the sink. the cocoon is gently placed in readiness alongside four shiny skinning knives.}
<C>__{mr. gumb }
<D>__{momma's gonna be sooo beautiful!}
<A>__{close on a stainless steel colt python, with a six inch barrel, as the cylinder is spun, and the hammer gets a practice cock. the metallic click is deep and loud. a note of alarm has entered mr. gumb's voice.}
<C>__{mr. gumb }
<D>__{you come here this minute, you little scamp!}
<A>__{low angle on mr. gumb, wearing the kimono, as he walks through his sewing workroom. his back is to us; he is looking anxiously under the furniture. he stops, straightens. genuinely scared.}
<C>__{mr. gumb}
<D>__{precious...?}
<A>__{low angle over the pit opening towards mr. gumb, as he stops at one of the doorways of the oubliette chamber. he stares inside; his face in shadows.}
<C>__{mr. gumb}
<D>__{sweetheart...?}
<A>__{from the distant bottom of the pit, we hear catherine's voice.}
<C>__{catherine }
<D>__{she'd down here you sack of shit.}
<A>__{mr. gumb's fist flies to his mouth, and he sags against the doorframe. a little groan escaped him; the dog answers with a series of yips. upward angle, from the pit bottom as mr. gumb's dark shape leans cautiously over the edge.}
<C>__{mr. gumb}
<D>__{precious, are you all right?}
<B>__{reverse angle on catherine}
<A>__{crouched to one side, clutching the dog to her chest. seeing mr. gumb, the dog squirms frantically, barking.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{get me a telephone. lower it down to me. do it now, mister! i don't want to have to hurt this little dog.}
<B>__{upward angle}
<A>__{on mr. gumb, as, with a cry of fury, he whips the colt from inside his kimono. the muzzle gleams as he takes aim. catherine yanks the dog up, into his line of fire, screaming at him.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{you shoot motherfucker you better kill me quick or i will break her fucking neck, i swear to god!}
<C>__{mr. gumb }
<P>__{(wails)}
<D>__{nooooooo!}
<A>__{tucking the dog under one arm, she grabs its muzzle, twisting the head. the dog whines piteously.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{back off, you son of a bitch! back off!}
<B>__{upward angle}
<A>__{as mr. gumb cries out again a terrible, inarticulate scream of rage and anguish. but then he slowly lowers his gun.}

<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{that's better... now get me a live telephone. get a long extension and lower is down here... and you better do it fast, too, 'cause i think her leg's broken. she's in pain, mister, she needs a vet.}
<B>__{mr. gumb}
<A>__{stares down at her, a long beat, breathing heavily.}
<C>__{mr. gumb}
<D>__{you think she's in pain? you don't know what pain is. but you're going to find out...}
<A>__{and abruptly he vanishes. sound of his footsteps, rushing off.}
<B>__{catherine}
<A>__{begins shaking, hands and arms twitching uncontrollably. she hugs the little dog tight to her chest, buries her face in its fur, sobbing...}
