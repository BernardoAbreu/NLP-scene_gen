<L>__{interior joel's apartment night}
<A>__{joel is unconscious on the bed, completely still. mary and stan watch the monitor and smoke a jointerior after a silence:}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{it's amazing, isn't it? such a gift howard gave the world.}
<C>__{stan}
<P>__{(a sigh)}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{to let people begin again. it's beautiful. you look at a baby and it's so fresh, so clean, so free. and adults... they're like this messy tangle of anger and phobias and sadness... hopelessness. and howard just makes it go away.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{you love him, don't you?}
<A>__{mary seems surprised, taken aback, caught. she is silent for a long moment.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{no.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{besides, howard's married, stan. he's a very serious and ethical man. i'm not going to tempt him to betray all he believes in.}
<A>__{stan takes another drag on the joint, passes it to mary.}
