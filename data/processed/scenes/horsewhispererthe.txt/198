<L>__{interior barn night}
<A>__{tom is standing in front of pilgrim's stall. he opens the door. they look at each other. he strokes him and begins to whisper;}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{there's something you have to do tomorrow, boy...}
<A>__{camera gently moves away... and tom whispers to pilgrim what must be done...}
<L>__{exterior the riding arena day}
<A>__{there's a stillness. a sense of import. annie, robert, frank, diane, joe and smokey, are all at various spots along the fence. grace stands inside the ring. tom is standing beside pilgrim in the middle of the ring. pilgrim is bridled and saddled. tom adjusts he stirrup. he walks over to grace...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{all set?}
<A>__{grace swallows hard, nodding. she's worried...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{sure?}
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{tom puts his arms around her shoulders and walks out to pilgrim. the horse pricks up his ears as they approach. tom motions grace to stop a short distance from pilgrim so as not to crowd him. tom walks over alone, reaching to gently take hold of him. holding him by the bridle, he puts his head beside pilgrim's, quietly speaking to him, soothing pilgrim's neck with his other hand... annie and robert are fascinated. anxious. pilgrim never takes his eyes off grace. tom tries to ease him forward. pilgrim resists, lifting his head and looking at grace so you can see the white at the top of his eye. tom turns him away, walking him in circles, trying to calm him. he leads him back to grace. pilgrim tosses his head and stomps his feet. robert grows more anxious. annie is calmer, more focused. tom climbs up on him, riding him around the arena in an easy lope. grace watches them go round the ring. she looks at her parents and tries to smile. they try as well. tom dismounts and leads pilgrim back to grace. pilgrim balks again, violently throwing his head, kicking... grace's shoulders slump, she presses her hands in her pockets, fighting not to cry...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{smokey...}
<A>__{smokey climbs over the rail into the ring as tom says something to him. meanwhile frank reassures grace:}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{he'll be okay, grace. just you hang on there a minute or two. tom'll get him, okay, you'll see...}
<A>__{smokey jogs over to the gate, climbing it, and disappearing into the barn. tom crosses to grace.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{there's still something going on inside of him i can't reach. so me and smokey here, we're going to try laying him down. okay?}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{what does that mean?}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{it's more or less how it sounds. sometimes it's not pretty to watch. some horses fight it real hard. your fella's already shown us he likes a good fight. so if you don't want to watch, i will call you when it's done.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{i want to watch.}
<A>__{smokey re enters the ring, carrying some rope. he talks briefly to tom. pilgrim, sensing something, turns and runs to the far side of the ring. tom, his arms spread, walks over to him, keeping him by the fence. tom takes him by the bridle. smokey comes beside him. tom unhitches the bridle and in its place slips a rope halter smokey passes to him. smokey then hands him two long ropes, one at a time. tom fastens one under the halter and ties the other to the saddle horn. tom asks smokey.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{you got that soft rope?}
<A>__{smokey hands it to him. tom quietly talks to pilgrim, runs his hand down pilgrim's left foreleg and lifts his hoof. pilgrim slightly shifts. and when he's still, tom slips the loop at the end of the soft rope over the hoof making sure it's snug. and taking the other end of the rope, he hoists the weight of pilgrim's raised hoof and ties the rope to the saddle horn. pilgrim stands on three legs an explosion waiting to happen. tom moves away from pilgrim, taking the halter line from smokey. pilgrim, trying to move, finds he's crippled. scared, he lurches, hopping on his right foreleg. seeing he can't walk, panicked, he tries to run. tom and smokey, brace themselves, lean back on their ropes and force him around them in a tight circle. he goes around and around like a crazed rocking horse with a broken leg. tom looks over and sees annie has left robert outside the ring to stand by an anguished grace her hands on her shoulders, gripping her. robert watches, feeling too much a foreigner...}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{what is he doing this?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{it'll be ok, grace.}
<A>__{but even frank isn't so sure. pilgrim, covered in sweat, still circles. as he runs, his hobbled foot jabs at the air, trying to find peace. he runs and runs as tom and smokey lean on the ropes until he can't run any more and stops. tom and smokey let the lines go slack. pilgrim, stands there, his wet sides heaving, panting like an asthmatic, making loud rasping sounds. tom and smokey speak. smokey hands him his rope. turning, he gets a coiled lasso out of the sand. he swings the rope in a wide loop and makes it fall over pilgrim's saddle horn. he pulls it tight. and he takes the other end of the rope to the far side of the fence and ties it in a quick release knot to the bottom rung. coming back he takes the other two lines from tom. tom crosses to the rail. he starts putting pressure on the rope. pilgrim feeing it, braces himself. the pressure tilts the saddle hold downward.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(to grace and annie)}
<D>__{he's trying to get him to go down on his knees...}
<A>__{pilgrim fights. tom pulls on the rope. pilgrim, slowly, begrudgingly, gives ground. tom, brings him to his knees, but it is short lived. pilgrim is muscling his way back to his feet. tom pulls him down to his knees again. pilgrim, fighting with every bit of strength, slowly gets to his feet again. but the pressure tom is putting on the saddle is too strong and relentless and finally pilgrim goes down on his knees and stays down. yet tom keeps the pressure on... tom shouts to smokey.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{drop the lines and come help me...}
<A>__{smokey, dropping the line, runs over. they both pull on the saddle rope.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{that's enough! stop it!}
<A>__{pilgrim snorts and foams at the mouth, fighting. but slowly, like a wounded bird, she starts giving in. he rolls over on his side and lays his head in the sand and is still. it seems like a total, humiliating surrender. grace starts to sob, burying her face in annie's chest. robert feels impotent to help.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{grace!}
<A>__{tom and smokey stand over the fallen horse like two big game hunters at the carcass of a kill.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{grace! will you come here, please!}
<A>__{grace shakes her head "no." frank motions to annie for her to let grace go... to let stand alone... we see that it's not easy for annie to trust this, but she does. and she steps back to where robert stands... tom, his face set, walks toward grace...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{grace, i need you to come with me.}
<A>__{grace violently shakes her head "no"... robert gets up the courage to say aloud:}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{well maybe she shouldn't be here...}
<A>__{annie quickly turns to him and says with quick intensity:}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{robert! let him handle it! please!}
<A>__{robert can't watch this. he turns and takes a few steps. just stops... standing behind and apart from annie, to just watch... slowly becoming transfixed, like someone who can't stop staring at an accident. tom reaches grace and puts his hand tenderly on her shoulder...}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{grace, i need you to come with me.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{no, you're only going to hurt him some more.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{he's not hurt. he's okay. look at him.}
<C>__{grace}
<P>__{(turned away)}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{grace, listen... you've got to do this. just trust me one more time.}
<A>__{grace looks into his eyes and is reminded of all this man has done for her... and she remembers her trust.}
<C>__{grace}
<D>__{do what?}
<A>__{tom, prouder of her now than ever before.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i will show you.}
<A>__{tom leads her across the ring, with his arm around her shoulder. annie tries to maintain her composure. robert remains still and focused. tom and grace come to pilgrim, lying in the dirt, his breathing plaintive. tom speaks gently;}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{i want you to lay down with him. i want you to stroke him. i want to start with his hindquarters and rub him, feel him all over.}
<A>__{grace is shaking her head "no." he speaks more firmly.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{grace, you've got to do what i say.}
<A>__{grace knows there's no way out. she takes a breath and slowly kneels in the dirt beside him, with tom's help. she lays on him, rubbing him, his hindquarters, his legs, his side, softly rubbing his neck and the wet silky side of his head.}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{now, listen. i want you to stand on him.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{what?!}
<A>__{tom responds to their voice without looking at them:}
<C>__{tom}
<D>__{please!}
<P>__{(they stop)}
<D>__{grace, do what i'm telling you. stand on him... now!}
<A>__{grace obeys him through her tears. she lets tom take her hand and guide her up onto the curve of pilgrim's belly. then he lets go. grace stands there with teas steaming down her face standing on the animal she loved most in the world.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{it's so cruel.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{no. he had the choice.}
<C>__{annie}
<D>__{what choice!!?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{either fight the way things are or accept it.}
<A>__{robert, however, is hypnotized by the event. he is having a private epiphany of sorts. grace sits in the dirt by pilgrim and strokes him quietly she begins talking to him, the way tom does. tom watches, as he cautiously steps further away. pilgrim looks up at grace out of the dark pool of his one sad eye. they look at each other. and we understand there's a connection once more. a moment of understanding... and forgiveness. grace starts to untie his ropes. smokey is about to stop her but tom shakes "no"... pilgrim, like an infant coming out of the water, breathing life for the first time, gets to his feet. grace and him look to each other. and all is still. grace grabs the saddle horn. pilgrim shuffles as if he's going to bolt. grace quietly reassures him... she then carefully puts her prosthetic leg in the stirrup. pilgrim shifts slightly. annie covers her mouth so as not to scream out her fear. robert breaths heavily. they watch as grace swings her leg, determined, and pulls herself into the saddle. sitting on his back, pilgrim tosses his head and looks as he's going to run off. but grace puts her arms around his neck, and once again, quietly reassures him. she starts to ride him, slowly, her arms around his neck, talking all the while, around the ring. annie laughs as she cries emotion overwhelming her. robert feels almost numb with fascination, gratitude, confusion... the slow ride turns into a trot... then a lope... then a canter... round and round the ring. frank and diane smile. diane looks to tom and knows what he's feeling... tom watches as any father would his heart pounding with pride for the miracle of his child. but he doesn't let on for a second. grace brings pilgrim to a stop, lifts her arms to the heavens, victorious. everyone cheers. smokey helps her off the horse. she stops to look at tom, who busies himself with picking up the ropes... so she re focuses on her parents. they run to each other and embrace... first, she and annie... then, she and her father... but, as robert and grace hold each other and begins to exit, annie manages to make eye contact with tom... and tell him with one look, how grateful she is... and how much she loves him. and he receives it...}
