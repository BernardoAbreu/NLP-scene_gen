<L>__{interior basement later}
<A>__{patrick and the others in the basement listening to some very strange sounds: groans, thumps, throbs.}
<C>__{maurice}
<D>__{sounds like we got the invisible scratch piklz hiding in our pipes.}
<A>__{patrick traces the piping with the wrench, he comes to a triple corner, where three small pipes all come together.}
<C>__{patrick}
<D>__{i think these bring the water down from the bathroom. into this...}
<A>__{a larger pipe that goes down the wall and disappears beneath the floor. the thumping sounds emanate from here. he puts his finger along the seam of the jointerior he pulls it away, red.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{check it out. the same shit that was in the carpet. told you it was from the plumbing.}
<A>__{he lifts the wrench to tighten the seal. the metal groans. then snaps. sending a thick spray of foul smelling red sludge shooting out of the seam, right into patrick's face.}
<C>__{patrick }
<D>__{damn, i knew these pipes were wacked.}
<A>__{he turns the wrench the other way, re tightening. the sound seems to move now through the piping. then the red sludge sprays out of the next three joints, smearing the others. the pounding, throbbing sounds begin to bounce around the room, as if something were actually moving through the pipes until it returns to the central large pipe and moves down, disappearing beneath their feet. then a rasping bark calls their attention. bones the dog sits by the padlocked door, panting. grinning. patrick smashes the old lock with the large wrench and opens the door to reveal another set of stairs leading down into a deeper storm cellar where the sound disappeared.}
