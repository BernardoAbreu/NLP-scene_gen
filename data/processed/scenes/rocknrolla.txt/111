<D>__{i've got 'em.}
<A>__{as they get out of the car, we see chechnyan 1 has now made his way down the street. he is punch drunk with mace in his eyes, but extracts a machine gun from under his jacket. the boys freeze they are fucked, nowhere to go, but chechnyan 1 is blinking profusely he can't be sure where they are. he lets off a magazine into the manikins next to our boys who all hit the deck. the magazine runs dry, chechnyan 1 dips into his belt to extract a fresh one. mumbles see's his opportunity, he grabs a golf club that is standing next to him, runs at chechnyan 1 and takes a massive swipe at his head. chechnyan 1 goes down, but he has already put in a new magazine. mumbles is still carrying the cases, one two is attached to his arm.}
