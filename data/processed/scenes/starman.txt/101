<L>__{interior shopping mall day}
<A>__{as he barges in, the star man accidentally knocks a cup of coke out of a young man's hand.}
<C>__{young man}
<D>__{hey!!}
<A>__{in a panic to find jenny, he continues jostling past people to look in the shops that border the atrium.}
<B>__{mezzanine}
<A>__{jenny warily approaches the railing and peers over. below her the star man comes out of a record store. she turns away and gets on the escalator to the second floor.}
<B>__{on the ground floor}
<A>__{the star man thinks he sees jenny in an electronics store, but when the girl turns around, it is obviously not her. backing out of there, he knocks over a sandwich board advertising a restaurant. the loud thwack it makes when it hits the cement turns faces in his direction. jenny's is not among them. his eyes raise to the mezzanine. maybe she's there. he looks wildly around for a way up. he spots the escalator and, trying to keep the upper floor in view while he runs for it, he slams into an unattended pram. it begins to tip over. the baby inside screams. the star man manages to snatch it out of the carriage before it hits the floor. he is looking for a place to put it when the mother comes charging out of a plant store.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{my baby!!! he's stealing my baby! burt!!}
<A>__{the star man holds the baby out to her. she grabs it out of his hands and he turns to leave.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{burt!! somebody stop him!! he was stealing my baby!!}
<A>__{two tough looking men in t shirts step in to block the star man's way to the escalator.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{where you think you're going?}
<A>__{not understanding, the star man tries to get by them. they push him back.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{a tall, skinny blond man with spectacles elbows his way to the mother.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{he was trying to steal gloria.}
<A>__{two steps and burt is on the star man. he spins him around.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{is that right? huh?}
<A>__{he throws him back against the crowd that has gathered.}
<C>__{star man}
<P>__{(stutters)}
<D>__{please.}
<A>__{burt pulls the star man up by his shirt front and shakes him.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{is that right? come on. answer me.}
<A>__{fear erases the star man's tenuous grasp of english and he begins to jabber in his own language. this makes burt even madder.}
<C>__{burt}
<D>__{were you trying to steal my baby? huh? answer me!}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{jennyhaydn!}
<B>__{second floor}
<A>__{jenny has just gotten on the escalator to the third floor when she hears her name. she knows she shouldn't but she gets off and joins the crowd at the railing. from there, she can see the star man trapped in a circle of people. he clubs burt away from him and tries to thrash his way out of the mob.}
<C>__{star man}
<D>__{jennyhaydn!}
<A>__{one of the t shirts throws him back and burt begins to punch him. we move in until we are close on jenny's face.}
<B>__{ground floor}
<A>__{some of the onlookers have joined burt in his attempt to bring the star man down. growling in his own language, the star man fights back as best he can. the sleeve of his windbreaker is torn. one of the t shirts lands a blow on his right shoulder that turns the star man around. he takes a blow on the chest. another in the kidneys. burt gets a grip on the star man's left wrist and holds on. the attackers close in. jenny's voice cuts through the din.}
<C>__{jenny }
<D>__{stop it!!! stop it!!!}
<A>__{she barges into the fray and starts peeling the men away from the star man.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{get away from him!! leave him alone!! you stupid jerks!! he's retarded!! can't you see that?!! get away from him!!}
<A>__{the men do. jenny pushes the sleeve of the torn wind breaker back up on the star man's shoulder.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{he was stealing my baby...}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{you're wrong!! he would never do anything like that!!}
<P>__{(takes star man's hand)}
<D>__{let's go...}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{he had gloria in his hands!}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{he's retarded! i shouldn't have left him alone!}
<A>__{she starts to push out of the circle. burt steps in to block her.}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(hisses)}
<D>__{get out of my way.}
<A>__{she stares at him until he does, then leads the star man down the path that opens for them in the crowd. they pass a mall guard who has just arrived.}
