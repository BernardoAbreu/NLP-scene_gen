<L>__{int: lab day}
<A>__{gru rides the elevator tube down to his lab, passing minions in various stages of jelly making. a sign reading, jelly testing area" has been hastily pasted over a nuclear warning sign. a supervisor minion checks his clipboard as the minion next to him steals a banana from his pocket. he turns, but the minion who stole the banana has hidden it in his mouth. we see the ends of the banana pushing out his cheeks.}
<C>__{supervisor minion}
<D>__{hey, oh! me banana!}
<A>__{the minion with the banana in his mouth shrugs. a single apple is passed down a line of minions in the least efficient way possible. a few minions mash fruits in large vats ala "i love lucy." one wears a bunch of fruit on his head like carmen miranda and sings the chiquita banana song. his supervisor comes over and tells him to get back to work. the minion tries to get out of the vat of fruit, but slips and falls down into a large test tube filled with mashed fruit. then all of the mashed fruit is flushed down a large hole where it is injected into jelly jars passing by on a conveyor belt. the trapped minion is injected into one of the jars. gru enters the lab and greets the minions.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{hey, tim, nice haircut!}
<A>__{he points at tim.}
<C>__{gru }
<D>__{donnie, hang in there, baby! it's almost friday.}
<A>__{gru high fives donnie as he approaches dr. nefario.}
<C>__{gru }
<D>__{so, how's today's batch, dr. nefario?}
<C>__{dr. nefario}
<D>__{i developed a new formula which allowed me to get every known kind of berry into one flavor of jelly.}
<A>__{gru sticks his finger in and tastes the purple goo in the jar. makes a disgusted face, then attempts a smile.}
<C>__{gru}
<P>__{(faking it)}
<D>__{that tastes good...}
<P>__{(gags)}
<D>__{love the flavor of that...}
<C>__{dr. nefario}
<D>__{it's horrible, isn't it?}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{no! no! oh, we're making great progress!}
<P>__{(to the minions)}
<D>__{here, try some of this.}
<A>__{he hands a jar to a minion, who tries it. he gags! another minion tastes some and scrapes it off his tongue. they smash the jar and all the minions run away, disgusted.}
<C>__{gru }
<D>__{whoa... okay, just because everybody hates it doesn't mean it's not good.}
<A>__{dr. nefario hangs his head.}
<C>__{dr. nefario}
<D>__{listen, gru. there's something i've been meaning to talk to you about for some time now.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{what? what's wrong?}
<C>__{dr. nefario}
<P>__{(clears his throat)}
<D>__{i miss being evil. sinister plots, large scale crimes...it's what i live for! i mean, don't you think there's more to our future than jelly?}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{well, i'm also considering a line of jams...}
<C>__{dr. nefario}
<D>__{um...the thing is, gru...}
<P>__{(deep breath)}
<D>__{i've had an offer of employment elsewhere.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{dr. nefario! come on, you're kidding, right?}
<C>__{dr. nefario}
<D>__{it's a great opportunity for me, bigger lab, more evil, full dental...}
<A>__{dr. nefario presses a button and his stuff folds itself up into a traveling suitcase. dr. nefario hangs his head. gru stares back at his old friend.}
<C>__{gru}
<D>__{very well. let us give you the proper send off.}
<P>__{(calls off screen)}
<D>__{minions!}
