<LOC>__{1985 EXT. CHICAGO - NIGHT TO DAWN}
<ACTION>__{Thundering north through the glass canyons of the Loop, the elevated train SCREECHES through the city awakening. As it races north across the river past ancient factories giving way to high rise splendor, lights glistening against the dawn, we see the complex business of bringing a city to life in the morning. On the Near North Side an assortment of revelers are winding up their night on the town. The pressmen loiter outside the Tribune loading docks, and fishing boats are outbound through the Chicago River locks. A streetsweeping crew moves through the Fulton Market, Chicago's central meat and produce distribution center. At the Merchandise Mart platform the elevated train picks up two old cleaning ladies wearing babushkas.}

<ACTION>__{The "Prowler" rolls around the corner, its brutal turret bristling with firepower. It is driving Luis and the other stupefied Comachos further back into the building. Eddie guides his deadly partner with the hand controller. The Comachos dive for cover and spray the miniature tank with AUTOMATIC FIRE. But they are no match. Two continuous streams of hot lead chew up the place, splintering the loading dock and the catwalk hiding places and disintegrating the structure, churning the Comachos to hamburger.}
<ACTION_ALT>__{COMACHO SHOT RINGS OUT}
<ACTION>__{Eddie goes down and the Prowler hand controller falls to the ground, shattered. The Prowler goes berserk, SPRAYING DEATH in a 360 degree circle until all the ammo is gone. Then SILENCE. Eddie touches the blood on the side of his leg. It's not serious. It appears everyone is out of ammunition. But a few Comachos are still hidden in the factory. Eddie is after them like a tiger. Victor, shoulder still bandaged, never has a chance. He goes down, battered and broken. But Luis has crept up behind Eddie. He jumps over a steel plate. He's going for Diana, a long knife in his hand. Eddie reaches for a reload. Puts it in his magnum. Aims, and blows Luis away just as he reaches for Diana.}

<ACTION>__{Across the littered battlefield, Eddie escorts Diana toward the light streaming through the factory entrance. He takes off his jacket and wraps it around Diana's shoulders.}

<ACTION>__{The pier is crawling with cops with more arriving every second. A fire boat is extinguishing the blaze set by the Prowler's incendiary ammunition. The bodies of the Comachos lying everywhere astound the arriving "Home Team." Officer Kosalas screeches to a halt and jumps from his car. Brennan and Music are running down the dock. Donato, a cast on his leg, hobbles after them.}

<ACTION>__{Emergency vehicles are arriving, and more squad cars, paddy wagons, and fire engines. Eddie walks by the cops toward an ambulance, now carrying Diana. Kates calls out after him.}

<DIAL>__{Hey, Cusack!}
<ACTION>__{Eddie stops, slowly turns around. There is a long pause.}

<DIAL>__{I'm glad you don't follow orders.}
<ACTION>__{Eddie hands Diana over to the waiting medics, who put her in the ambulance. We pull back further and further until we see the rest of the Home Team. The ambulance, carrying Diana, pulls away with it's lights flashing. Eddie walks down the pier alone.}
