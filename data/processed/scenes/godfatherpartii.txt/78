<P>__{(sicilian)}
<D>__{i never lie to people i've accepted as my friends. speak to fanucci yourself tomorrow. let him ask you for the money, but don't pay it, and don't in any way quarrel with him. tell him you have to get the money and will send me as your messenger. let him understand that you're willing to pay what he asks, don't bargain. i will go to his house, and quarrel with him. he likes me; enjoys explaining how things are here. he uses ten sentences when he only needs one, so while he talks, i will kill him.}
