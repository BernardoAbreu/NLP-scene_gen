<L>__{exterior freeway interior ronnie & rae's new car day}
<A>__{ronnie is at the wheel of the chevy caprice. rae sits silently next to him. rae looks out the window as a huge 18 wheeler rolls up on her side. she tries to ignore it and the tension it brings. she turns to see that ronnie is sweating. another truck is on his side sandwiching them in. an attack is coming over ronnie. his breath is short. his chest tightens. rae reaches over and gently strokes the back of his neck.}

<D>__{i gotta pull over.}
<A>__{he breaks. the two trucks zoom ahead as ronnie breaks to the side. dust flies as the chevy skids to a stop on the side of the road. trucks zip by shaking the car, as ronnie tries to get control of his breathing. rae tries to stay calm, stroking the back of his neck as he struggles for breath. he puts his forehead against the wheel to stave off the building nausea.}

<P>__{(through clenched teeth)}
<D>__{fuck!}
<A>__{fear comes to rae's face as she notices her middle finger scratching at the back of ronnie's neck. she pulls it away and shoves her hand between her thighs. her eyes close as the burning builds. she grips the gold chain around her waist.}
