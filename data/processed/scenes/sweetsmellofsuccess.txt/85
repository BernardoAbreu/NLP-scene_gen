<A>__{camera starts on d'angelo at the bar. he looks off after robard. there is little concern in his face, but as he watches, curiosity grows. he strolls out after the proprietor. camera tracks with him as d'angelo comes to join the little mob of two or three people on the sidewalk. panning, the camera now shoots towards 2nd avenue. beyond the bridge we can see the police car. kello and murphy are beside one of the open doors (into which steve has been carried). murphy turns back, walks a few paces across the sidewalk and picks up steve's music case, which he carries back to the squad car. he gets in and the car drives off.}
