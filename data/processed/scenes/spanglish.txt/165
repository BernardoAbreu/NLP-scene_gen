<A>__{john enters the room on the double...passes deborah without knowing it..(she is partially obscured by the drape or some such). as he passes....camera holds on deborah..she is a mess...goopy tear stains..seeing him and his concern brings her grief to a higher ground...a sinner humbled by goodness..a trembling lip of childlike vulnerability...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{deb..deb?..where are you?}
<A>__{he is about to leave the room...she is about to let him but an instinct leads her astray once more.}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{baby, what?}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{"baby?" stay there, john...sit down..i suddenly get what i have to do...i just have to get the guts.}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{is it absolutely necessary to make it this...this scary..can you just say it?}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{not so easy.}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(tender ready for the big healing)}
<D>__{yeah..come on..it's me. we can talk.}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{do i ever hope so...i've been seeing another man for the last eleven weeks and it was nothing and i ended it tonight..at first it was just keeping an eye on the real estate market..then it was...what? me being insecure and looking for some ridiculous vali...}
<B>__{on john...}
<A>__{a shock victim..he holds up a hand to stop her..}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{go hold on...hold on...i'm missing what you're saying..you can't just keep talking and expect me to follow it when you start the way you did.......}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{just what did you hear?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{well there was the crack in the planet. that was noisy...}
<A>__{she looks at him...a solid beat...}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{there's an actual noise in my head.....no kidding..}
<A>__{briefly he does the noise...}
<C>__{deborah}
<P>__{(slowly)}
<D>__{i met him about...}
<A>__{john holds up a hand to stop her...he needs to gather himself to hear this..she waits...and waits...as he waits he grows flushed and stunned with dread. finally a word..}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you..}
<A>__{she takes that as a cue to start..}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{i met him..}
<A>__{he puts up his hand..}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{if you talk that fast...i will never hear you..there's a lot going through my mind....have you said yet whether you slept with him?}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{so far i've just been talking about a flirtation because the really important thing for you to know...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{have you said yet whether you've had sex with someone else? because i really am missing most of your words. so help me out here..}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{i've been trying to explain that for the first ten weeks there was almost nothing to ...}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(sincerely checking but wild)}
<D>__{you still haven't said, right?}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{is this your way of...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{this is my way of...this is my way of asking you whether..}
<A>__{he stops... staggering on the threshold of a diminished future.}
<C>__{john }
<D>__{oh man, once i ask it...give me a second.}
<P>__{(several beats then some}
<D>__{conversational good manners for keeping her}
<P>__{waiting)}
<D>__{i'm just trying to figure out whether there's any way to avoid knowing..no, damn}
<P>__{(quickly closing this argument with himself)}
<D>__{there's not...}
<P>__{(to her)}
<D>__{okay, you're on..real short answer, huh? have you had sex with another..}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{i know you're very angry?}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(considering then repressed answer)}
<D>__{ahhhh...i'm getting there, yes.}
<C>__{deborah}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{john?}
<P>__{(on his look)}
<D>__{i think if you let me tell you the full everything of this we'd be in a position to deal with it better..because eleven weeks ago when...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{you don't believe that i miss your words..i get three or four tops...and then just see your mouth moving with nothing coming out and then i spin out and there's this noise...but there's no way to miss a "yes" or "no."}
<C>__{deborah}
<P>__{(blurts)}
<D>__{yes..}
<C>__{john}
<P>__{(core simple eight years old)}

<C>__{john}
<D>__{well, you don't set the bar real high.}
<A>__{he get up and starts to exit..}
<C>__{deborah}
<D>__{no. please, please, please..i think if you listen to exactly what happened and then do whatever you need to...we'll..just let me tell you everything..}
<A>__{the doorbell rings...it's quite late...deborah wondering what's up..she looks out the window.}
