<A>__{a forty foot, flat bed trailer truck loaded with cement conduit backs across the street and stops, blocking the path of the convoy. the lead suv honks. the truck doesn't move. the captain of the marshals gets out and walks up to the truck. the driver has slipped out the other side and disappeared. suddenly, a huge steel claw drops down from above and closes around the top of the armored truck, its sharp points crunching into the metal sides. then the truck starts rising off the pavement. a couple of determined marshals jump out of their vehicles, race over and grab onto the bumpers as the armored truck is lifted off the ground.}
