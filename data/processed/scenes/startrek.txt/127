<L>__{interior enterprise corridors continuous}
<A>__{we track fast with pike, kirk, spock and sulu as they hurry through the enterprise toward the shuttle bay:}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{without transporters, we can't beam off the ship, can't assist vulcan, can't do our job. i'm creating an opportunity: mr. kirk, mr. sulu and mr. olson will space jump from the shuttle. you'll have chutes you'll land on that machine they've lowered into the atmosphere that's scrambling our gear you'll get inside, disable that thing then beam back to the ship.}
<A>__{kirk and sulu share a holy fucking shit look }
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{... okay.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{mr. spock, i'm leaving you in command of the ship. once we have transport capability and communications back up, you'll contact starfleet and report what the hell's happening here.}
<C>__{pike }
<D>__{something you've got only precious few minutes to figure out. if all else fails, fall back and rendezvous with the fleet in the laurentian system.}
<P>__{(spock is freaked, then)}
<D>__{kirk. i'm promoting you to first officer.}
<C>__{kirk spock}
<A>__{what!?! captain?}
<C>__{pike }
<D>__{while i'm gone we need to keep the chain of command. and you two make a swell team.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{captain. please. i apologize, but the complexities of human pranks escape me.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{it's not a prank, spock. and i'm not the captain. you are.}
<A>__{and with that, he's done. strides off. kirk finally shakes off the shock of his promotion }
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{once we knock out that machine... sir, what happens to you?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{i guess you'll have to come get me.}
<P>__{(turns; to spock)}
<D>__{careful with the ship. she's brand new.}
<A>__{they appreciate the pure balls of that. bravery washes over them they'd fucking die for their captain, who now turns to kirk and sulu }
<C>__{pike }
<D>__{suit up, gentlemen.}
