<D>__{dr. furtwangler, the reichsminister.}
<A>__{the sound of heavy footsteps approaching. the attendant turns his torch to light the way for three men in nazi uniform, also with attendants and torches, marching down the corridor. the attendant bows deeply as the reichsminister and his aide go through the door. the other man remains in the corridor on guard.}

<D>__{dr. furtwangler, i want to apologise personally for this power failure. i was so enjoying the performance. in times like these we need spiritual nourishment.}
<A>__{a bomb explodes nearby.}
<C>__{reichsminister}
<D>__{but i welcome this unexpected opportunity of talking to you.}
<P>__{(with great care)}
<D>__{when you came on to the platform tonight, i thought you weren't well. you looked tired,}

<C>__{a man's voice}
<D>__{look at them. men, women, kids. boy, did they love him. you see, steve, adolf hitler touched something deep, real deep and savage and barbaric, and it won't just go away overnight. it's got to be rooted out. you know what i think? i think they were all nazis. and let's face it, their leaders, those bastards now on trial in nuremberg, couldn't have done it alone. it's these people, they gave all the help that was needed. willingly.}
<A>__{the film changes with a scratchy music soundtrack wagner. shots of high ranking nazis in an audience including josef goebbels, listening. and they're listening to and watching wilhelm furtwangler conducting. at the appropriate moment:}
<C>__{the man's voice}
<D>__{that's him. furtwangler. wilhelm furtwangler.}
<A>__{the nazis applaud. goebbels shakes hands with furtwangler. the film ends. sitting in the ruined cinema are two men: general wallace, with files on the table, and, beside him, major steve arnold. a projectionist is standing in the door of the projection room.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{so, you never heard of him.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{nope.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{do you know who arturo toscanini is?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{he's as big as toscanini, maybe even bigger. in this neck of the woods, he's probably bob hope and betty grable rolled into one.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{jeez, and i never heard of him.}
<A>__{wallace glances at the file.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{you were in insurance before the war.}

<D>__{right. claims assessor.}

<D>__{conscientious, determined, dogged.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(amused)}
<D>__{they said i was dogged?}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{well, they say here that when you went on a case, you stayed on it.}
<P>__{(looks up at steve.)}
<D>__{now we can't take every nazi in this country to trial, although i would like to; it's an impossibility. so we're going for the big boys in industry, education, law, culture.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{like this bandleader.}
<C>__{wallace}
<P>__{(a smile)}
<D>__{well, he's more than just a bandleader, steve. he's a great conductor, a gifted artist. but we believe that he sold himself to the devil. your number one priority from this moment on is to connect him to the nazi party. don't be impressed by him. i want the folks back home to understand why we fought this war. find wilhelm furtwangler guilty. he represents everything that was rotten in germany.}
<A>__{steve wants to rise, but wallace puts a hand on his shoulder to make him sit again.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{stay put, steve. there is some other stuff that i'd like for you to see here. background.}
<A>__{he nods to the projectionist, then starts to go, but stops.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{oh, one thing that may be a problem. our occupation authorities in wiesbaden have a duty to help these poor unfortunates with their defence. they keep repeating: 'we must be just, we must be seen to be just.' well, i've only one thing to say to the liberals in wiesbaden: fuck 'em.}
<P>__{(as he goes)}
<D>__{you answer to no one but me. is that understood?}
<P>__{(to the projectionist in the door)}
<D>__{show him the film.}
<C>__{projectionist}
<D>__{yes, sir. roll it.}
<A>__{wallace goes. the projectionist starts the next reel. on the screen: a berlin sequence. bombs falling. ruins, a city devastated, empty. flags of the four allied nations. posters of truman, stalin, churchill.}
<C>__{archive film voice}
<D>__{that is the hand that dropped the bombs on defenceless rotterdam, brussels, belgrade. that is the hand that destroyed the cities, villages and homes of russia. that is the hand that held the whip over the polish, yugoslav, french and norwegian slaves. that is the hand that took their food.}

<C>__{american radio voice}
<D>__{remember, men, no fraternisation. in a german town, if you bow to a pretty girl or pat a blond child, you bow to all that hitler stood for. you bow to his reign of blood. you caress the ideology that meant death and destruction. you never know who was a member of the nazi party. don't be fooled. don't fraternise.}

<A>__{she hands steve a typewritten sheet. he ignores it, finds a list which he hands to her. he waits for her to read, then:}

<P>__{(pleased)}

<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you tell him nothing, emmi. if he calls again, you say you know nothing. we're gonna keep him waiting while i get acquainted with his case and with the witnesses. and, god help me, with beethoven.}

<D>__{i want you to understand why you're here. this is an investigation into wilhelm furtwangler, former prussian privy councillor, banned from public life under control council directive no 24 and who's applied to come before the tribunal of artists of the denazification commission. i'm interested in what he was up to from 1933 to the end of the war, understood?}
<A>__{werner nods.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{rudolf otto werner. wind section since 1936. what instrument did you play?}
<C>__{werner}
<D>__{first oboe.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i have your questionnaire here. it says you were never a member of the nazi party.}
<C>__{werner}
<D>__{absolutely not.}

<D>__{no, i was never a nazi, i have no interest in politics, i'm a musician }

<D>__{hey, hey, slow up, fraulein straube has to take down what you say.}

<C>__{werner}
<D>__{dr. furtwangler is a great musician. he actively opposed the nazis and later on he helped many jews to escape.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{then how do you explain him being made a prussian privy councillor?}
<C>__{werner}
<D>__{it was hermann goering. i was told he just made the maestro his privy councillor, no questions asked. although dr. furtwangler stood up to him. and to dr. goebbels.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{he also conducted for hitler, didn't he?}
<C>__{werner}
<D>__{yes, that's true, but he refused to give the nazi salute. he kept his baton in his right hand. in hitler's presence. that was a brave act...}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{brave? to celebrate hitler's birthday with some heroic piece by wagner but without the nazi salute? bravo.}
<C>__{werner}
<D>__{it was beethoven's ninth.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{do you really think it was brave? didn't he bow to him and shake his hand?}

<D>__{no, no, no, i give you my word. i was never a member of the nazi party. never. i am in the percussion section. i play the timpani.}
<A>__{steve just stares at him.}
<C>__{schlee}
<D>__{anyway, they would never have allowed it. my brother was married to a jewess, may she rest in peace. and goebbels said...}
<P>__{(to emmi)}
<D>__{...please take this down carefully, because it's most important, fraulein?}
<C>__{emmi}
<D>__{straube.}

<D>__{he was... he was a great hero.}
<A>__{steve lights a cigarette.}
<C>__{schlee}
<D>__{goebbels, yes, josef goebbels said, 'there's not a single filthy jew left in germany on whose behalf dr. furtwangler has not intervened.' no, no one could have been less of a nazi than dr. furtwangler.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{but this was the same guy who conducted for adolf on his birthday.}
<C>__{schlee}
<D>__{he was forced to do that. but he refused to give the nazi salute in front of hitler. he kept his baton in his hand, you can't salute with a baton in your hand.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{and what about the nuremberg rally?}
<C>__{schlee}
<D>__{no, we...we played on the evening before the rally.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(straight faced)}
<D>__{oh! the evening before, i see...}
<C>__{schlee}
<D>__{yes, dr. furtwangler was absolutely clear about this: politics and art must be kept separate.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{politics and art must be kept separate. i will remember that. but let me see if you can help me with something i just don't understand. i'd really like to know why all you guys are so crazy about him. what's his secret?}
<A>__{schlee tries to find words.}
<C>__{schlee}
<D>__{well, it's hard to explain. i can only tell you from my own experience. soon after i joined the orchestra, we were rehearsing the third symphony of beethoven, the eroica. there are several rather difficult passages for the timpani. one particular crescendo. during the break, i asked how he wanted it played. he was studying his score. he didn't look up. he said, 'just watch me.' so, of course, i did. i never stopped watching him. the moment came. and suddenly, he turned to me and our eyes were locked. there was something in his look that... that simply demanded the crescendo. i shall never forget his look. it was a moment of... of magic.}
<A>__{steve nods, thinks for a moment. then:}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you ever seen adolf hitler's eyes when he was making a speech? i've seen 'em on films.}
<C>__{schlee}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{was looking at furtwangler like that?}
<C>__{schlee}
<D>__{i don't know what you mean, major.}

<A>__{she smiles just as steve bursts in. he's in a bright, cheerful, energetic mood. david draws back guiltily. emmi, embarrassed, hesitates then turns to the typewriter and types furiously. seeing this, steve stops, but just for a brief moment. then, as he goes to his desk:}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{david, need to ask you something. you heard this rumour the british found something called the hinkel archive?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{so what is it?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{the british occupy the building where this guy, hinkel, ran the nazi ministry of culture and it seems they've... they've discovered his secret archive.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{what's that mean?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i don't know, but the british are excited about it, i know that. the rumour is hinkel kept a file on every artist working in the third reich.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{jeez. and you think the british'll share it with their allies?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{major richards said he'd call to let us know.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{that's big of him.}
<A>__{he looks from david to emmi as if trying to work out something. then:}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{okay, better question the next witness. i bet you a bottle of french champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes.}
<C>__{david}

<C>__{steve}
<D>__{helmuth alfred rode. second violinist since 1935. what's it mean, second violinist?}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{it means i wasn't good enough to be a first violinist.}
<A>__{he chuckles, looks around for approval. steve grins encouragingly.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{good, and according to your questionnaire, helmuth, you never joined the nazi party.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{me? never. never.}
<A>__{long silence.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{i... i know everyone now says they were never nazis but in my case it is absolutely one hundred per cent true. i am a catholic, it would have been totally against my conscience.}
<A>__{silence. steve lights a cigarette; rode eyes it hungrily.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{is it true you're going to interview dr. furtwangler today?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i will ask the questions, helmuth.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{excuse me. did you know that he refused to give the nazi salute when hitler was present in the audience?}
<A>__{steve flicks david a glance, waggles his finger like a baton.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{the problem was how could he avoid giving the devil's salute when satan was actually sitting there.}
<P>__{(modestly taps his}
<D>__{chest with his}
<P>__{thumb.)}
<D>__{and, i said, 'dr. furtwangler, why not enter with the baton in your right hand? hitler will be sitting in the front row. if you give the salute with the baton in your right hand it'll look like you're going to poke his eyes out.'}
<A>__{chuckles. david mouths i win to steve.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{he was...he was really grateful to me for that. after the concert, i... i stole that baton as a memento of a great act of courage. i still have it. i should have brought it to show you. i hope i'm not going too fast for you, fraulein? }

<A>__{he crosses himself. silence. david raises a discreet finger.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you have a question for helmuth, david?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{yes. what was the orchestra's reaction when they asked you to play for hitler's birthday?}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{oh, we didn't play for his birthday, we played the evening before it was the 19th of april not the 20th.}

<D>__{gustav heinrich ernst martin wilhelm furtwangler, born berlin, january 1886. orchestral conductor. and you say here you were never a member of the nazi party.}

<D>__{that is correct.}
<A>__{a very long silence. when the silence is unbearable steve speaks.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{could you tell us about being made a prussian privy councillor. how did that happen to a non party member?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{i received a telegram from hermann goering informing me that he had made me a privy councillor. i was not given the opportunity either to accept or refuse. after the dreadful events of november 1938, the violent attacks on the jews, i stopped using the title.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{what about vice president of the chamber of music, you used that title didn't you? but then i suppose you had no choice there either, because i suppose dr. goebbels just sent you a telegram saying, dear mr. vice president.}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{i don't think dr. goebbels sent me a telegram. i was simply told. in a letter, i believe. i don't remember exactly.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{goebbels and goering were sure heaping honours on you. one makes you a privy councillor, the other makes you vice president of the chamber of music, and you weren't even a member of the party, how do you explain that?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{well, there was a constant battle between goering and goebbels as to which of them would control german culture. i was simply a pawn. anyway, i resigned from the musikkammer at the same time i resigned as musical director of the berlin philharmonic orchestra. in 1934.}
<A>__{david puts up a hand. steve nods.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{why was that? why did you resign, dr. furtwangler?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{i wrote an open letter to the newspapers condemning what they were doing to music, making these distinctions between jews and non jews. for my part, the only divide in art is between good and bad. eventually, goebbels summoned me and told me i could leave the country if i wanted to but under no condition would i ever be allowed to return. i always believe that you have to fight from the inside not from without. i asked myself, what's the duty of an artist, to stay or to leave? and then goebbels demanded that i acknowledge hitler as solely responsible for cultural policy. well, that was a fact and it seemed pointless to deny it. i simply acknowledged that hitler and the minister of culture appointed by him were solely responsible for the cultural policy of the reich. what i wanted to express was that i, personally, had no responsibility whatsoever for their cultural policy. i have always had the view that art and politics should... should have nothing to do with each other.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{then why did you conduct at one of their nuremberg rallies?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<P>__{(flaring)}
<D>__{i did not conduct at at the rally, i conducted on the evening before the rally.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{that sounds like the small print in one of our insurance policies, wilhelm. and what about april 19, 1942? the eve of hitler's fifty third birthday, the big celebration; you conducted for hitler, didn't you? was that in keeping with your view that art and politics have nothing to do with each other?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<P>__{(flustered)}
<D>__{that... that was a different matter, i... i was tricked.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{how come?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{could i have a glass of water, please? please, fraulein?}
<C>__{emmi}
<D>__{straube.}
<A>__{steve looks expectant but furtwangler remains silent. steve nods to emmi, who gets the water. furtwangler drinks. steve waits.}
<C>__{furtwaangler}
<D>__{thank you. i was in vienna, rehearsing the ninth symphony of beethoven, when goebbels called and said i had to conduct at hitler's birthday. i'd always managed to wriggle out of such invitations, pleading previous engagements, illness, having my doctors state i was not well and so on and so on. i was also fortunate that baldur von shirach, who controlled vienna, hated dr. goebbels and would do anything to thwart his wishes. but this time goebbels got to my doctors before me; they were frightened off, and von schirach was threatened, bullied and gave in. so, i had no alternative but to conduct for hitler. believe me, i knew i had compromised, and i deeply regret it.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(playing with him)}
<D>__{doesn't sound much of a trick to me. sounds like you made a deal.}
<C>__{furtwangler}

<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{i don't remember in detail, there were so many.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{did you call someone you knew?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{i may have, as... as i said, i simply don't remember.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{let me me help you, then. you picked up the phone and made a call }
<P>__{(mimes a telephone.)}

<A>__{emmi sticks her fingers in her ears and shuts her eyes tight.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{or maybe you called goebbels or goering? you were so close you were in the same shithouse as them.}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{may i ask a question?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{sure.}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{when will my case be heard by the tribunal?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{your guess is as good as mine.}

<C>__{steve}
<D>__{tough, tough!}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<P>__{(now more and more agitated)}
<D>__{then why is it, please, that another conductor who was actually a member of the party, who used to play the horst wessel before his concerts, has already been cleared and is working again while i have to wait and wait and wait?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i don't know, he wasn't my case. why did you escape to switzerland just before the war ended?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{it was because i learned that the gestapo was about to arrest me.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{why were they going to arrest you?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{i believe it was because of another letter i'd written to goebbels lamenting the decline of musical standards due to racial policies.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you didn't complain about the racial policies, just about the musical standards, is that right?}
<A>__{no response.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{so, how did you learn that the gestapo was out to get you?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{during an enforced hour long interval because of a power failure at a concert here in berlin, albert speer, the minister of armaments, said to me, 'you look very tired dr. furtwangler, you should go abroad for a while.' i knew exactly what he meant.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you sure knew a lot of people in high places.}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{it would be truer to say, i think, that a lot of people in high places knew me.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you were real close to all of them, to adolf, to hermann, to joseph, to baldur, and now albert,}
<P>__{(flaring)}
<D>__{so, let's hear the truth, let's come clean. what was your party number?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{if you are going to bully me like this, major, you had better do your homework. you obviously have no idea how impertinent and stupid your questions are.}
<A>__{steve is stung. his eyes narrow dangerously.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{david, you remember i said i had a question that he wouldn't be able to answer? well, i'm gonna ask it now. you ready for this, wilhelm? it's a tough one. why didn't you get out right at the start when hitler came to power in 1933? why didn't you leave germany?}
<A>__{no response.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i have a list of names here, people in your profession, who got out in '33. bruno walter, otto klemperer, arnold schoenberg, max reinhardt...}

<A>__{rode, trying to catch his breath, shakes his head.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{talk about power, i have the power to give you work, make your life easier. your past won't be mentioned. i could give you a job tomorrow but i have to get something in return. see, helmuth? that's plea bargaining.}

<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i can give you freedom of movement, freedom to work, freedom, helmuth. but i need something in return.}

<D>__{major, we're discussing a man of genius, i don't want...}

<D>__{fuck that, helmuth. you want to discuss symbols here? this guy was a front man. he was the piper, but he played their tune, you get my philosophical meaning? i'm not interested in small fish, i'm after moby dick. come on, helmuth. hard facts.}

<C>__{rode}
<D>__{yes. a corporal. us army. a jew. he said he'd seen the telegram in the chancellery.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{son of a gun. we'll find the corporal and we'll find the telegram.}
<A>__{he stops, takes out a cigarette, offers one to rode, lights them both, gives rode the packet. they smoke for a moment.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{but i need documentary proof. you know of anything like that?}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{no. but that's why we hated him. we admired him as a conductor but we all hated him too because he didn't have to join the party and yet he had a better life than any of us. he didn't have to go and deliver a report after every trip abroad. he got everything from them, everything. he was filthier than any of us party members.}
<A>__{the sun is setting. rode stops suddenly.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{there's a rumour... i don't know if it's true or not... but ask him about von der null.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{never heard of him, who is he?}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{edwin von der null. music critic. he gave furtwangler terrible reviews while he raved about herbert von karajan.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{who's he?}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{also a conductor. very brilliant. young. von der null called him 'the miracle von karajan'. furtwangler was outraged and they say he had von der null conscripted into the army. the same thing happened to another critic. true or not, it's not such a bad idea. critics give you bad reviews, you have them sent to the russian front.}
<P>__{(chuckks.)}
<D>__{but if you really want to get furtwangler, ask him about herbert von karajan.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{the miracle kid.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{yes, yes you may notice that he cannot even bring himself to utter his name, he... he refers to him as k.}
<A>__{rode tries to make up his mind about something, then decides. he reaches into an inside pocket and takes out a small black notebook.}
<C>__{rode}
<D>__{and ask him about his private life.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{his private life?}
<A>__{rode hesitates, then he hands steve the black book.}

<D>__{when i last saw you, i was unprepared. i did not know what to expect. in these past weeks, i have been thinking more carefully and making some notes.}
<P>__{(glances at the notes.)}
<D>__{you have to understand who i am and what i am. i am a musician and i believe in music. i am an artist and i believe in art. art in general, and music, in particular, has for me mystical powers which nurture man's spiritual needs. i must confess, however, to being extremely naive. i insisted for many years on the absolute separation of art and politics. my entire life was devoted to music because, and this is very important, because i thought that i could, through music, do something practical.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{and what was that?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{maintain liberty, humanity and justice.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{gee, that's a thing of beauty, honest to god, a real thing of beauty. i'm going to try to remember that. liberty, humanity and justice. beautiful. but you used the word 'naive'. are you now saying you think you were wrong? that art and politics can't be separated?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{i believe art and politics should be separate, but that they weren't kept separate i learned to my cost.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{and when did you first learn that when you sent the telegram? was that the surrender signal, the waving of the white flag?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{what telegram?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{'happy birthday, dear adolf, love wilhelm.' or words to that effect. that sounds to me like you were dropping on your knees and saying, 'okay, adolf, you win. you're the number one man. have a swell party.'}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{i have no idea what you're talking about.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{the birthday greetings you sent to your old pal, adolf hider.}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{i never sent him any birthday greetings or any other kind of greetings.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{think carefully, wilhelm... maybe not in your own name, but as privy councillor or vice president.}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{i don't have to think carefully. this is utterly ridiculous.}
<A>__{david and emmi exchange the briefest of looks. david raises his hand.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{yes, david?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{why not show dr. furtwangler the evidence. it may refresh his memory?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{you won't find it because no such telegram exists.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{well, i tried, you got to admit i tried. i thought i might just trap you there, wilhelm, but david here was too quick for me. smart move, david, smart move. no, i don't have the telegram, but i know it exists. and i want you to know, wilhelm, we're going to keep looking for it because i believe you sent it.}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{then you are wrong.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{art and politics, yeah, art and politics. let's look at that. you and the berlin philharmonic toured the third reich, played in countries the nazis had conquered. are you saying that conducting in occupied territories from 1939 on wasn't a commercial for adolf and all he stood for?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{we never, never officially represented the regime when we played abroad. we always performed as a private ensemble. as i think i already told you, i was a freelance conductor.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you know something? you should've written our insurance policies for us because you got more exclusion clauses than double indemnity. what do you imagine people thought? the berlin philharmonic's taken over by doctor goebbels and his propaganda ministry but wilhelm is a freelance, so art and politics are now entirely separate? is that what you believed ordinary people thought?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{have no idea what ordinary people thought.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{no!}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{no, because i had only one intention. my only intention whatever i did was to show that music means more than politics.}

<D>__{tell me about von der null.}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<P>__{(taken off guard)}
<D>__{von der null?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{yes, von der null.}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{von der null?}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{how long's this going to go on, wilhelm? i say von der null, you say von der null, i say von der null, you say von der null, we could go on all day. you know who von der null is, don't you? edwin von der nuell, music critic.}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{yes, i know who he is.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{isn't it true that because he gave you bad reviews and praised this young guy, von karajan, called him a goddamn miracle, said he was a better conductor than you, then you had von der null conscripted into the army and no one's heard from him since?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{that's an outrageous lie!}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you sure you didn't call one of your close buddies and say, god in heaven, did you see what that guy von der null wrote about me? the greatest conductor on earth. i want him out the way. he had the nerve to accuse me i am not playing enough modern music. send him to stalingrad. isn't that what you did? you don't like criticism, do you, wilhelm? you surely didn't like them saying there was another conductor who was better than you... are you saying the name von der null was never mentioned in your talks with goebbels?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<P>__{(uncomfortable)}
<D>__{well. once he said he'd read what this man wrote about me.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{and what did he say?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{he said, 'don't mind him. his job is to criticise, your job is to conduct.'}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{and what happened to von der nul?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{i have no idea.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{you've really no idea? i will tell you what happened. he died in stalingrad.}

<D>__{say it.}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i will say it, then. 'little k.' is that right? you couldn't even bear to say his name!}
<A>__{furtwangler rises angrily and starts to pace.}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{please stop playing these games with me. why you should bring up the name of another conductor is beyond my understanding.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i will tell you why. you remember we talked about you playing for hitler's birthday? and you told me that goebbels got to your doctors first, that you were tricked?}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{yes, that's what happened.}
<A>__{he sits heavily, wipes his brow. he is sweating now.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{i have a different story to tell. i don't think you were tricked. not in the way you describe. i believe something else happened. i've seen the hinkel archive, i've seen records of phone calls, and putting it all together, this is what i think happened. i think goebbels said, 'wilhelm, if you won't conduct for adolf's birthday, we'll get the miracle kid, the guy that critic, von der null, thinks is the greatest conductor in the world. he's not just willing to conduct for adolf, he's offered to sing "happy birthday" as a solo.'}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{come on, admit it. k worried you, didn't he? he always worried you. in 1942, he's thirty four years old, you're already fifty six. and goebbels and goering keep saying to you, 'if you don't do it, little k will.' never mind art and politics and symbols and airy fairy bullshit about liberty, humanity and justice because i don't care how great you are. it's the oldest story in the book,}
<P>__{(a wry look at david)}
<D>__{the ageing romeo jealous of the young buck. the real reason you didn't leave the country when you knew you should have was that you were frightened that, once you were out of the way, you'd be supplanted by the miracle kid, the party's boy twice over, flashy, talented little k.}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{this is absolute nonsense!}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{well, i'm just beginning to develop my theme. isn't that what you call it in classical music, developing your theme? okay, so they played on your insecurity. that's human, understandable. but, there is one guy who doesn't like little k as much as he likes you yeah, the number one man your old pal, adolf. he thinks you're the greatest, and when he says, i want wilhelm for my birthday, boy, they better go out get wilhelm. so, josef calls and threatens you with little k. and you said to hell with the ninth in vienna, i will give it to adolf as a birthday present in berlin. that's the trick they played, they got you by the balls and they squeezed. hard. why did you stay? why did you play for them? why were you the flag carrier for their regime? jealousy?}

<A>__{no response.}
<C>__{steve}

<P>__{(indicating emmi)}
<D>__{major, this is deeply offensive and repugnant!}

<D>__{you bet.}

<D>__{and totally irrelevant.}
<C>__{steve}
<P>__{(continuing to furtwangler)}
<D>__{not so, counsellor. that secretary of yours, she wasn't just your secretary, she procured women for you, didn't she? as many and as often as you wanted.}
<C>__{furtwangler}
<D>__{stop this, please, stop this now!}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{no, i'm not going to stop it. hitler himself offered you a beautiful house and a personal bomb shelter.}

<D>__{i absolutely refused the house and the bomb shelter.}
<C>__{steve}

<C>__{david}
<D>__{major, that's not a good argument. if dr. furtwangler did indeed enjoy all these... these privileges, he enjoyed them because of who he is and what he is. that's true of any leading artist in any country in the world.}
<C>__{steve}
<D>__{but it still doesn't make them saints. they still have to get up and piss in the middle of the night, don't they? they can still be vindictive and envious and mean just like you and me. well, just like me. can't they?}

<D>__{see, wilhelm, i think you're their boy, their creature. you were like an advertising slogan for them: this is what we produce, the greatest conductor in the world. and you went along with it. the truth of the matter is, wilhelm, you didn't need to be a member of the party. i made a mistake when i asked you for your party number. i should've asked you for your non party number. just like some other well known artists.}
