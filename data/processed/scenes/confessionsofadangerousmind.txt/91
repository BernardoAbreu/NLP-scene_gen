<D>__{my fucking neck hurts. okay?}
<C>__{byrd}
<D>__{poor baby. look, i've been put in charge of a fairly large wet operation and i could use your help.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{have you noticed, jim, i've got a tv show on the air? i don't need to kill people for hire anymore.}
<C>__{byrd}
<D>__{i know you don't need to. but you'd like to.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{that's insane.}
<A>__{byrd shrugs, unconvinced. he sips his drink.}
<C>__{byrd}
<D>__{think of it as a hobby. an avocation. something you do to relax. you can be an assassination enthusiast, a murder bug.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{i've got important things to think about here. i don't have time to fuck around with you.}
<C>__{byrd}
<D>__{okay, i will help you out with your little show. tit for tat. that's the kinda guy i am. i've seen this dating game of yours, chuck. and i have a thought.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{what, now you're a television producer?}
<C>__{byrd}
<D>__{hey, i'm cia operative john q. public when it comes to tv and that should make my opinion of interest to you.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{let's hear it then.}
<C>__{byrd}
<D>__{well, what do you have now? the couple gets sent to some stupid second rate hollywood shitcan restaurant, right? sets you back fifty bucks? that's not too exciting a prize to us vicarious living boobs out in tv land.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{yeah, what's your point?}
<C>__{byrd}
<D>__{up the stakes, chuckles. send 'em to some exotic locale. europe, southeast asia, for example.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{the network's not going to let me send two unmarried kids on vacation together.}
<C>__{byrd}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{send 'em with a chaperone. some respectable old lady with a sewn closed snatch.}
<C>__{barris}
<P>__{(considering)}
<D>__{y'know, that's not half bad.}
<C>__{byrd}
<D>__{i'm telling ya. and... and sometimes you can be the chaperone, chuckie. let's say we have a job for you in austria. you, a successful tv producer, above suspicion, chaperones the young couple, and while you're there, blam! you take care of some company business. it's the perfect cover. tv producer by day, cia operative by night.}
<C>__{barris}
<D>__{i told you, i don't have to kill people for money anymore.}
<C>__{byrd}
<D>__{chuck, when i said you fit our profile, very little of that had to do with you needing the money. some of it, but very little. you liked it with renda, chuck. i saw it in your eyes. you liked it but you botched it. don't you want to get really good at something, chuck?}
