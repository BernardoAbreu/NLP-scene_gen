<T>__{screen goes black: fade in:}
<L>__{interior bonsal court day}
<A>__{birds flying below ceiling. the room has a barred cage running all around its edge; the cage is filled to near overflowing. hasari stands before the judge, his face covered with blood, his body a mass of aches and welts. at the back of the room, max and aloka; elsewhere, ashoka, the goonda, and several of his thugs.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{the life of a rickshaw puller is not one a man would choose if he had a choice. our feet blister and burn up from the boiling asphalt, our noses burn from the fumes of countless motor cars and buses, our backs curve permanently from the loads we carry hour after hour, day after day. but i am proud to be one of the human horses who carry my countryman from place to place and i am thankful for the opportunity to make a living. but i will not keep silent anymore and i will not be cheated and threatened anymore. life is hard enough. no more.}
<A>__{ramatullah starts to applaud. rassoul follows suit. the judge bangs his gavel.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{silence!}
<P>__{(when it's silent)}
<D>__{this man will be permitted to use his rickshaw without let or hindrance. and i will make a restraining order against mr. ghatak.}
<A>__{cheers from the pullers. the judge bangs his gavel.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{i haven't finished these proceedings. for his part in this disturbance, i fine the defendant 50 rupees.}
<C>__{hasari}
<D>__{fifty rupees, your honor? that's }
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{pay at this time or spend seven days in jail!}
<A>__{seven days in jail will cost him far more than fifty rupees. as he reaches into his pocket for his screw of money, a hand suddenly protrudes into the cage through the bars.}
<C>__{ramatullah}
<D>__{hasari!}
<A>__{and now another hand with several rupees reaches through.}
<C>__{rassoul}
<D>__{hasari!}
<A>__{now a dozen voices call his name and a dozen hands reach through the bars with rupees clutched in their fists and press the money into hasari's hands. the judge, max and aloka, and certainly ashoka watch this in amazement. the judge bangs his gavel. max turns, shoots a little finger gun and winks at ashoka.}
<B>__{close on ashoka}
<A>__{on his face, we see pure hatred for these two men.}
