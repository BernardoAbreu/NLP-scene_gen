<L>__{interior exam room moments later}
<A>__{a disheveled squad enters to find diane on the exam table, crying. her sweater is pulled up, pregnant belly exposed. an ultrasound machine and monitor is on beside her.}
<C>__{cleo}
<D>__{di, we're sorry. we...}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{it's off... i can't take the fighting, the back stabbing, the open hostility. we're not acting like cheerleaders, we're acting like a bunch of sorority girls!}
<A>__{the squad rushes to a sobbing diane, embarrassed by their behavior and what it's done to diane.}
<C>__{diane }
<P>__{(through tears)}
<D>__{it's all my fault. i'm sorry i ever started this...}
<C>__{kansas}
<D>__{di, it's not your fault. we all wanted to do this for you... for ourselves.}
<A>__{squad ad libs agreement. cleo picks up the ultra sound hand piece beside diane and starts fiddling with it.}
<C>__{hannah}
<D>__{look, maybe i can watch a pg movie... i will just say i'm counting dirty words for sunday school.}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{that's okay, hannah. it was silly to think we could learn to rob a bank from watching movies. sex you can learn from movies. but robberies? there's no way.}
<A>__{cleo sets the hand piece on diane's belly. the squad stares in wide eyed wonder at the monitor for the first time they see diane's baby. diane doesn't notice.}
<C>__{diane }
<D>__{besides, tv land had a "little house on the prairie" marathon and the ingalls made baby carrie's bed in a dresser drawer. i guess i can just do that...}
<A>__{diane sees the squad staring and turns to the monitor.}
<C>__{diane }
<D>__{oh my g d...}
<A>__{she sees her baby moving and gently touches her belly with both hands. it's all very real. suddenly, the baby shirts forward and we see a second baby's head.}
<C>__{cleo}
<D>__{ahh! baby's got two heads!!!}
<C>__{lucy}
<D>__{it's twins!!}
<C>__{diane}
<D>__{oh, thank g d! i'm not just super fat!}
<C>__{kansas}
<P>__{(building)}
<D>__{oh okay, we ain't done with this... those babies are gonna get a good start in life with a real crib one that costs a shit load! we're gonna learn how to rob a bank from the only people who really know how to do it criminals! i'm gonna visit my mom!}
<A>__{squad can't believe what she just said.}
