<C>__{rogers}
<D>__{well, i think it's really all about the money. we're talking about a third rate cia agent who had a government salary, and she had sent her husband to niger, and he had come back and didn't give the report to the cia, but he turned it over in an op ed to the new york times. so she was already in the hot seat with the cia, and so now she's all about the money. plus it's come out that she was considered kind of a mediocre agent at best.}
