<D>__{you're gonna die now.}
<A>__{the boy moves toward audrey, stepping over kyle's body. audrey backs away. she looks toward the entrance to the diner. blocked by advancing creatures. they're everywhere. she's trapped. she notices the open door to the minivan. and so she bolts. audrey dives into the car as the throng of creatures rapidly closes in. she hammers the auto door lock. clunk! she moves to the center of the car as gruesome faces press against the windows. a nightmare come to life.}
