<A>__{lisa climbs the fire escape to the second floor and the outside of thorwald's apartment. she tries, unsuccessfully, to get through the window which opens into the kitchen from the fire escape. and then, with some difficulty, stretches and succeeds in getting in through the living room window, which is open. she goes directly to the bedroom and we see her bending over one of the suitcases.}
