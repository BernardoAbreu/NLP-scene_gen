<A>__{paul and branch listen intently as ted paces, the tv vcr plays shots of the dead body in the background.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{see? where's the birthmark? your brother's police report listed it...}
<P>__{(reading from the report)}
<D>__{"...large purple birthmark, upper left thigh..."}
<P>__{(leaning into the screen)}
<D>__{but i don't see it. not on this body. you can see it in the picture. see?}
<A>__{ted points to the photo; raymond, in the summer, wearing shorts with a blotchy purple spot clearly visible on his leg.}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{so what, mr. barnell? did it just disappear? did it just... get better.}
<A>__{ted grins. his moment. finally. seconds feel like minutes.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{it... did get better.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{did it now. well how in the world did that happen?}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{raymond was always... bothered by it. when he came back from... florida, he'd had it fixed. laser surgery... like removing a tattoo.}
<A>__{paul looks at branch. it's an excuse ted hadn't thought of before.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{he did not.}
<C>__{paul}
<D>__{you taped my brother's body, in the morgue?}
<A>__{paul stands and grabs the photo from off the desk.}
<C>__{paul }
<D>__{and this? you stole pictures of my family? and taped his naked body? what kind of sick company are you running here?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{oh for... he's lying. it's obvious he...}
<A>__{paul, feigning fear, shrinks back into the corner.}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{this is crazy. all we have to do is dig up the body... check the leg for scars...}
<P>__{(bingo)}
<D>__{dental records!}
<A>__{paul goes white. he hadn't thought about this.}
<C>__{branch}
<D>__{that will be just about enough of that. mr. barnell, i'm sorry it's all come to this. we'll have a check brought over to you tomorrow morning.}
<A>__{paul nods, stressed and strung out, he hugs the wall as he walks out. after a moment...}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{sir, with all due respect, he's }
<C>__{branch}
<D>__{jesus, we're lucky he's not suing. now tomorrow, you deliver the check to mr. barnell with a complete apology.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{fine, i understand how this looks }
<C>__{branch}
<D>__{it looks like you beat the hell out of one of our policy holders. now send cam in here.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{branch}
<D>__{well, while you were off on your little easter egg hunt, your junior found us an out on that warehouse robbery. head office is bumping him a level.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(fuck me naked)}
<D>__{i will go get him.}
<C>__{branch}
<D>__{they're very keen on him. they want me to feel him out on a transfer }
<A>__{ted has left the office, slamming the door behind him.}
