<L>__{interior jim's office early morning}
<A>__{the camera comes in on a package of cigarettes. a finger impatiently rips open what is left of the package, discloses that it is empty. the angle widens to reveal a tired, disheveled jim. disgusted, he fishes the most likely butt from a tray littered with them. with considerable difficulty he manages to light it, only to burn his nose. impatiently stamping out the butt he rises, stretches, walks to the window, pulls up the shade. early morning sunlight floods the room. he turns off a standing lamp, looks thoughtfully out the window, suddenly gets an idea. turning, he snaps his fingers. mary, who is asleep on the desk, her head resting on her elbows, raises her head, opens a sleepy eye.}

<D>__{"compare the price, compare the slice, take our advice buy wham!"}
<A>__{mary critically shakes her head "no", closes her eye. jim wearily throws himself down on the couch, absently toys with his already loosened tie. he pulls it up over his nose, throwing the balance over the top of his head. suddenly he reacts, snaps his fingers. mary opens a sleepy eye.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{"if you'd buy better ham. you'd better buy wham!"}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{it's boyle petroleum. "if you'd buy better oil, you'd better buy boyle."}
<A>__{her eye closes. jim sinks back with defeat, his hand dropping over the edge of the couch. it encounters a crumpled piece of paper, earlier work. he smoothes the paper, scans it, kind of likes it. he gets up, comes over, snaps fingers. mary looks up.}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{"this little pig went to market as meek and as mild as a lamb. he smiled in his tracks when they slipped him the axe he knew he'd turn out to be wham!"}
<A>__{a long silent look passes between them.}

<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{"...knew he'd turn out to be wham!"}

<P>__{(dejected)}
<D>__{i don't know... i don't know.}
<A>__{mary looks at him sympathetically, doesn't quite know what to say. as the camera moves to a close shot of the emotionally distraught jim, his eyes go to a large photograph on his desk of muriel and the children. he picks it up, looks at it with affection. suddenly he gets an idea. rising with determination he puts on his coat and starts for the door.}
<C>__{mary}
<P>__{(startled)}
<D>__{where are you going?}
<C>__{jim}
<D>__{home, to get some sleep and i'd advise you to do the same.}
