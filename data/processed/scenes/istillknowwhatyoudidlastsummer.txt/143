<L>__{exterior woods trail night}
<A>__{estes, will, tyrell, julie, and karla walk along a trail through the heart of the island. the storm has abated for a few minutes. it's windy, dark, and spooky. the kind of place you'd take people if you wanted to scare them with a classic ghost story. that is just what estes is doing.}
<C>__{estes}
<D>__{he worked here for many years. he had a nice family. a pretty wife and two little ones. a boy and a girl. they'd be about your age, now.}
<A>__{they continue along the path. estes looks at them in the dark, slowing for just a second.}
<C>__{estes }
<D>__{one day his wife went missing. maid found blood all over the honeymoon suite room 201.}
<A>__{there are strange noises out in the woods.}
<C>__{estes }
<D>__{eventually, they found her body. pieces. a leg in the swamp. an arm washed up on three mile beach.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and the head they found much later.}
<A>__{a huge branch is blown from a tree and comes crashing down through the underbrush, scaring them. estes calmly steps around it.}
<C>__{estes }
<D>__{careful }
<C>__{julie}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{did he do it?}
<C>__{estes}
<D>__{people say she was running around on him. people say he caught her in bed with other men. people say a lot of things.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he disappeared, taking the two small ones with him. at least they were never found.}
<A>__{the winding path leads to a small orchard. they hang on his every word.}
<C>__{estes }
<D>__{we're here.}
<A>__{in the center of the orchard is a cemetery. they move off the path into the safety of the woods. there seems to be activity around the place. it's silent and eerie. julie stares, fascinated. she is slowly drawn toward the house. karla grabs for her arm.}
<C>__{karla}
<D>__{be careful, julie.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i've got to see.}
<A>__{she leads, they follow, circling the house. julie rounds a corner of the shack and stops. she sees }
<B>__{two tombstones}
<A>__{the first stone reads: sarah willis (birth death) the second stone reads: susie willis (birth death) beyond them}
<B>__{a freshly dug grave}
<A>__{and the group moves slowly toward it. the headstone, partially obscured by the mound of dirt, comes into view. the third headstone reads:}
<C>__{julie james}
<D>__{born september 6, 1979 died july 4, 1998 "a lying whore"}
<A>__{"a lying whore" is scratched with a knife.}
<C>__{karla}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{...today's july fourth.}
<A>__{will goes to comfort julie }
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{i'm not dying on this island, will.}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{do you hear me?}
<A>__{julie shouts into the darkness.}
<C>__{julie }
<D>__{you want me, ben willis? come and get me. i'm right here.}
<A>__{she kicks over her headstone }
<C>__{julie }
<D>__{my grave stays empty!}
<A>__{she looks defiantly down the path.}
<C>__{karla}
<D>__{julie, the boats are gone, the phones are down. there's no way off this place.}
<C>__{julie}
<D>__{then, we fight }
<A>__{will looks around. estes is gone.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{where'd estes go?}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{what is up with that weirdo?}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{i will go find him.}
<C>__{karla}
<D>__{why? he can't help us.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{he's probably the only one who can help us.}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{i will come with you.}
<C>__{karla}
<D>__{are you crazy? we're not staying here on our own.}
<C>__{will}
<D>__{it's okay. he couldn't have gone far. i will catch up with you later.}
<A>__{will disappears into the darkness.}
<C>__{karla}
<D>__{maybe we should just wait here? hide in a tree?}
<C>__{tyrell}
<D>__{i'm not hiding up no tree.}
<P>__{(to julie)}
<D>__{i'm with her. let's arm ourselves to the teeth and kick this psycho's butt.}
