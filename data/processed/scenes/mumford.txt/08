<A>__{mumford climbs out on the big rock, settles himself on the edge and takes a long drink from a water bottle. what he sees: far below at the foot of these hills, lights just twinkling on, is the town of mumford. he stares at it for several long moments. then he takes a small headlamp from his pack and fits the straps over his head (it looks like a miner's light). he twists the light on to test it and turns his head to watch the beam move about.}
