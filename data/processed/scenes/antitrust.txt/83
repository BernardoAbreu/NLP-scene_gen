<A>__{milo's at the closet, rummaging among the clothes hanging there. alice comes up behind him. he finds his suit jacket. he digs in one pocket, then another. he finds the fiber optic strand (from teddy's floor). shows it to her.}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(almost silently)}
<D>__{it's a camera.}
<L>__{exterior back garden again}
<A>__{they've trooped back outside. she's worried she's indulging his paranoia.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{it isn't a broadcast studio. it's a surveillance post or something. that's why they have the dishes on top.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{you're scaring me. i think we should just go.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{go where? you can't get away from people like this.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{"like this?" it's gary you're talking about.}
<C>__{milo}
<P>__{(it really hurts)}
<D>__{you think i don't know that?}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{milo. why would he }
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{how should i know? "solving a problem," i guess. or needing to control everything. i don't know.}
<P>__{(can't think about it)}
<D>__{i've gotta get in there.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{even if all this were true. there're 20 other buildings. all of them filled with computers and }
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{it's the only one with dishes on the roof. the studio's a front. that's why they keep postponing its opening.}
<P>__{(muttered, obsessive)}
<D>__{...gotta get in there.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{milo, you told me those doj agents are all over the place. how could they hope to hide a surveillance post?}
<P>__{(as he mulls this)}
<D>__{and how can you get in there, anyway? with the cameras and the swipe cards }
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i can't just walk away!}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{you can't just walk in, either.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{they stop the construction work at six or seven. the parking lot's mostly clear by two or three in the morning. even the early geeks don't get there before five.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{is it two? or is it three? have you ever really noticed?}
<A>__{he knows what she's saying: he's unqualified for this, a space cadet. she tries to hold him. but he wriggles away.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{no! i can't just keep my head in the sand. that's how i got into this mess.}
<A>__{he paces, he thinks. she watches him, worried.}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{i know how to get in there. but you've gotta help me.}
<C>__{alice}
<P>__{(scared, reluctant)}
<D>__{...whaddo i do?}
<C>__{milo}
<D>__{so you believe me?}
<A>__{she can't lie. she shakes her head.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{just tell me what to do.}
