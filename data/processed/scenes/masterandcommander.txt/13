<L>__{13. quarterdeck night}
<A>__{pullings has joined the officer of the watch, 2nd lieutenant mowett, a short tubular man in his early 20s. jack climbs up a ladder and we see him properly for the first time: a heavy set man in his thirties, thick blonde hair clubbed at the back at the binnacle, by the ship's great wheel. the helmsman, bonden a london cockney with a boxer's face gives jack their current course. jack nods, then moves to the gunwale with pullings. jack sniffs the air and speaks in a low voice.}

<D>__{how i do hate a lee shore}
<C>__{pullings}
<D>__{you think we'll have long to wait?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{intelligence reports had her leaving boston on the 12th, that should put us at least a week ahead.}
<C>__{pullings}
<D>__{she'll be in for a surprise, sir.}
<A>__{the pun on the name of their ship was unintentional, but jack lets out a great hoot of laughter, shattering the tense, expectant silence.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{in for a "surprise". now that's wit. "in for a surprise". 'pon my word i shall have to tell the doctor.}
<A>__{he leaves, still laughing. those on the quarterdeck are more amused by jack's unique sense of humour than by the feeble joke itself.}
<C>__{jack }
<P>__{(calls back)}
<D>__{don't put her on the reef, tom.}
<C>__{pullings}
<D>__{i will try not to, sir.}
