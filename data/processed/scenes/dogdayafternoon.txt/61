<C>__{sal}
<D>__{have him walk in backwards.}

<L>__{exterior bank night}
<A>__{sonny crosses to sheldon, grins, grabs him and executes a very professional looking pat down search. he removes sheldon's .38 from a shoulder holster, producing it for the crowd with a flourish like a magician: some of the old playfulness returns for a moment. he carefully and with showbiz flourishes searches sheldon's thighs and groin. the crowd howls. sheldon bears it with stoic calm.}
<B>__{close two shot}
<A>__{as sonny stands up from the search and finds sheldon's eyes locked to his with flat calm.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{jesus, you'd like to kill me, too.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{i wouldn't like to, but i will, if i have to.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{nothin' personal, huh? the man that kills me, i want him to do it because he hates my guts. not because it's a job. okay, let's go... but you gotta walk in backwards.}
<A>__{the move toward the door of the bank, where sonny opens the door, preceding sheldon, both men entering backwards.}
