<L>__{exterior bastille market square day}
<A>__{bells toll. a motley crowd gathers around the execution scaffold, held back by men at arms. a hooded executioner mounts the steps of the scaffold in the company of a priest. the priest wears a black cassock and a broad black sombrero. the executioner, a large man, raises his axe and touches the end of the blade, cutting his finger. razor sharp. the executioner holds up his bloody thumb. the crowd roars approval. and turns to regard the day's victim as he is rolled into view. d'artagnan stands, half naked, his hands bound behind him, in a horse drawn cart. the driver turns the cart, begins a circuit of the square. the blood thirsty crowd cheers and jeers at d'artagnan. but d'artagnan keeps his head high. if he must die, he will die with dignity.}
<B>__{tower of bastille}
<A>__{rochefort watches from a tower overlooking the square. richelieu appears beside him.}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{milady left at midnight. by private coach.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{a remarkable woman. the most beautiful i've ever known. and the deadliest. which would explain my attraction.}
<P>__{(peering down at the scene)}
<D>__{how is our young daredevil holding up?}
<C>__{rochefort}
<D>__{he's wishing he'd never heard of the musketeers.}
<A>__{down below, the horse cart reaches the scaffold. a manat arms drops the tailgate, d'artagnan steps down. he is taken into the custody of a captain of the guards, and several men at arms carrying muskets.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{the cardinal's familiar carriage is parked a safe distance from the square. the guards who attend it have wandered off to watch the festivities. the coachman remains, seated on top, braiding his whip. suddenly, a gloved hand grabs the coachman, yanks him from his seat.}
<B>__{scaffold}
<A>__{d'artagnan is led by the captain of the guards up the stairs to the execution platform. the executioner and the priest wait patiently above. d'artagnan sees the bloodstained block where his neck will soon lie; pales. the priest mutters comfort:}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{fear not, my son...}
<A>__{d'artagnan regards the priest whose face is hidden beneath the brim of his broad black hat. he holds a large bible in his hands.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{for we are with you, always.}
<A>__{the priest raises his face, reveals it... and winks. it is aramis. he whispers:}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{all for one, and one for all...}
<A>__{d'artagnan's heart soars. he turns to face the executioner. porthos grins beneath the hood's overhang.}
<C>__{captain of the guards}
<D>__{prepare the prisoner.}
<A>__{porthos lays his axe aside, approaches d'artagnan in a threatening manner. he takes him by the scruff of the neck, and forces his head upon the chopping block. the crowd goes wild.}
<C>__{porthos}
<P>__{(whispers into his ear)}
<D>__{don't worry, boy. you won't feel a thing.}
<A>__{the captain of the guards gives aramis a suspicious look.}
<C>__{captain of the guards}
<D>__{where is father rostand today?}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{the good father is... all tied up.}
<C>__{captain of the guards}
<D>__{very well. proceed.}
<A>__{porthos nods.}
<B>__{another angle}
<A>__{meanwhile, on the perimeter of the square, two figures ride on horseback, they wear familiar cloaks. a closer look reveals queen anne and constance. they ride through the city, towards the countryside beyond. but their progress has led them here. anne frowns at the spectacle.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{barbarism.}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{men call it justice.}
<C>__{anne}
<D>__{are you surprised?}
<A>__{she replies with contempt, reins her horse away from the square, the crowd, the executioner's axe. but constance freezes in place, eyes wide. as d'artagnan, upon the cart, rolls into view.}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{it's him.}
<A>__{for just a moment, their eyes lock. inestimable space between. constance's eyes fill with tears, she watches d'artagnan. porthos steps back from d'artagnan, raises his axe. d'artagnan shuts his eyes, wonders, mutters a silent prayer. that's when screams of panic erupt from the crowd. d'artagnan raises his head to see the source of this mayhem.}
<B>__{market square}
<A>__{the cardinal's crimson carriage races toward the scaffold, scattering the crowd in all directions. men shout, women scream, all leaping to avoid the stallion's sharp hooves, the coach's thunderous spinning wheels. in the driver's seat, clutching the reins in one hand and cracking a whip in the other... is athos. porthos uses the heavy blunt end of the axe to topple the closest men at arms. aramis opens his bible, pulls out a pistol, and blasts the saber from the hand of the captain of the guards. a man at arms raises his musket to shoot the false priest, but d'artagnan leaps out of nowhere, lands on him with both feet, knocking the manat arms off the scaffold.}
<B>__{carriage}
<A>__{athos pulls up alongside the scaffold.}
<C>__{athos}
<P>__{(the usual dour}
<D>__{expression, but a}
<P>__{hint of levity)}
<D>__{gentlemen, your carriage. compliments of the cardinal.}
<A>__{d'artagnan rushes to the edge of the scaffold, springs into the air, landing on the seat beside him. aramis and porthos shed their disguises, jump after, light upon the carriage. the roof fabric tears, they drop into the plush interior below. athos cracks the whip... and the stallions race off through the crowd, towards freedom.}
<B>__{square}
<A>__{constance watches the escape, transfixed, delighted. as the carriage barrels from the scaffold, she thrusts a gloved fist into the air, triumphant.}
<C>__{constance}
<D>__{yes!}
<B>__{tower}
<A>__{but the cardinal looks on with horror.}
<C>__{richelieu}
<D>__{my carriage.}
<B>__{carriage}
<A>__{athos produces a dagger, cuts the leather ties that bind d'artagnan's wrists.}
<C>__{athos}
<D>__{hold on!}
<A>__{athos cracks the whip, driving the horses onward.}
