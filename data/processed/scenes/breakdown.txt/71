<L>__{interior police station day}
<A>__{a wall is covered with missing persons' notices. photographs of men, women and children stare back at us. names and dates are printed across the bottom of the notices. pull back to reveal jeff staring at the gallery of faces. it's a creepy feeling. several yards away, deputy len carver, a young puffy faced lawman, sits at a desk filling out a form. jeff looks shaken.}
<C>__{deputy carver}
<D>__{is this a recent picture?}
<A>__{jeff glances over. deputy carver is holding up a wallet sized photograph of amy.}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{two months old.}
<C>__{deputy carver}
<D>__{she still wear her hair like that?}
<C>__{jeff}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{the deputy resumes filling out the form. he clicks his tongue sympathetically.}
<C>__{deputy carver}
<D>__{we'll certainly do our best, mr. taylor. there's over a hundred thousand people go missing in this country every year. runaways, deadbeat dads, dropouts, folks hiding from the i.r.s. all vanishing without a trace.}
<A>__{jeff stares at the faces.}
<C>__{deputy carver}
<D>__{now i'm not saying she's one of them. i sure hope not. but unless there's a ransom demand or evidence of forced abduction, believe me, the f.b.i. won't even look at your case till it's been 24 hours.}
<A>__{deputy carver finishes the paperwork and staples the photograph to the form. he looks up at jeff.}
<C>__{deputy carver}
<D>__{nevertheless, we'll sure keep our eyes peeled. how's that sound?}
<A>__{jeff clenches his jaw.}
