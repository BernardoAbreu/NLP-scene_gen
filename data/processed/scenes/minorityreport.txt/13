<A>__{a tour of precrime is in progress, like the public relations tours run by present day fbi. the tour guide, a pretty, smartly uniformed woman in her twenties, leads a group of adults and children, all with glowing nametags, through the building.}
<C>__{tour guide}
<D>__{welcome to the main headquarters of precrime. smaller precrime branches are scattered throughout the united states.}
<A>__{the group follows the guide slowly through the lobby.}
<C>__{tour guide }
<D>__{precrime was established in 2030, with the harnessing of the remarkable talents of the precognitive mutants.}
<A>__{she points cheerfully to a stubby little man, mr. harris.}
<C>__{tour guide }
<D>__{mr. harris, can you tell me how many precogs there are?}
<C>__{mr. harris}
<D>__{three. uh, right?}
<C>__{tour guide}
<D>__{that's exactly right! a lot of people assume there are precogs in every branch office.}
<C>__{tour guide }
<D>__{but there are only three precogs, right here in this building. and the information they give us, we send out to all the other branches.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{and what is that information what do the precogs do?}
<A>__{an eager boy, timmy has the answer to that one.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{they protect us.}
<A>__{the guide tousles his hair.}
<C>__{tour guide}
<P>__{(chipper voice)}
<D>__{that's right, timmy. because of the precogs, you're going to grow up murderfree. isn't that something?}
<C>__{mr. harris}
<D>__{they ever wrong? the precogs ever screw up when they predict a murder?}
<A>__{the guide laughs tolerantly.}
<D>__{tour guide never, sir. it's an infallible system. the precogs predict a homicide, and our precrime police then apprehend that future murderer before the event occurs. and right next door is the judicial center, where we prosecute the future murderers.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{can we see the precogs?}
<C>__{tour guide}
<D>__{no, i'm sorry. that part of the building is not open to the public.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now, if you'll just step this way ...}
<A>__{she waves the group on toward an elevator.}
