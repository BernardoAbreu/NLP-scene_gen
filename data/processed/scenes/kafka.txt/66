<B>__{floor of clerks}
<A>__{uniformly, like a chorus line, the infinite row of clerks turn their heads from their single endless desk when they hear an awful noise: mr. pick is breaking through from the floor below. the inexorably rising chain has hauled him floor by floor through the castle, breaking open holes too small for his body, shredding him along the way, and still carrying him upwards}

<B>__{castle corridor}
<A>__{kafka walks along with murnau and ekman. the laughing man holds kafka's arm.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{and i suppose dr. murnau didn't die in a cave in. you killed him to free the position of orlac medical officer for your own ends.}
<C>__{murnau}
<D>__{yes, well we're looking for a new village now. if we stay too long at one source ... people become suspicious.}
<A>__{they pass another of those grinding chains carrying memos and inter office directives up and down.}
<C>__{murnau}
<D>__{but you're quite right that he didn't die in that cave in. in fact, he didn't die at all. he was simply recalled by himself. as well as being head of medical records here and a director of your firm i'm dr. murnau, of course.}
<A>__{the laughing man giggles crazily.}
<B>__{library}
<A>__{the laughing man, subdued for a moment, merely smiles a little, opening the door to let kafka in first, guarding him close. dr. murnau then leads the way across to his laboratory door.}
<C>__{murnau}
<D>__{may i ask where your two warders are?}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{lying in the gutter where they belong.}
<A>__{murnau laughs, but then has to stop as it encourages the laughing man, bringing forth a mad chuckle or two from him.}
<C>__{murnau}
<D>__{pity. they're an amusing pair, didn't you find? absolute innocents.}
<A>__{he pushes the tall door open into his lab.}
<B>__{laboratory}
<A>__{murnau spreads his hands proudly as they enter, displaying his amazing factory.}
<C>__{murnau}
<D>__{i so rarely get the chance of showing my work to anybody anybody capable of appreciating it, that is. you might say i'm a student of human reaction.}
<A>__{ekman, who's seen it all before, goes to lean somewhere, bored.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{the fact that it's live bodies you practice your trade on doesn't seem to matter to you.}
<C>__{murnau}
<D>__{on the contrary, it matters a great deal. we're engaged in immensely important research here. i'm a revolutionary too, you know but a much more pragmatic one.}
<A>__{as if in response to that the laughing man convulses anew. ekman immediately turns to a shelf for another vial and goes to give it to the laughing man.}
<C>__{murnau}
<D>__{ i can't very well administer experimental treatments to corpses and if they become corpses, why, they have their uses too that's why speed is essential. living tissue, even if its owner has passed on, is our most valuable acquisition.}
<A>__{the laughing man gulps down the potion and starts to calm down a little.}
<C>__{murnau}
<D>__{we've tried transfusions on our ... volunteers. unfortunately, far from infusing superior characteristics it's tended to make them insane murderous even a condition we've had occasion to make use of.}
<A>__{the hidden bomb case ticking lightly away. the clock inside the bomb case, becoming visible as if by x ray, is seen to be a matter of minutes away from blast off.}
<B>__{the lab}
<A>__{murnau walks to where the elaborate distillation processes are going on. the very section where kafka hid the bomb. kafka wipes his brow, quickly, conscious of ekman staring at him. murnau gazes obsessively at his contraptions, his piercing eyes following the routes of the flowing chemicals.}
<C>__{murnau}
<D>__{ and the new patients they bring me aren't usually as dexterous as you've been in evading us. not perfect specimens by any means, but not the type of person who'll be missed either.}
<C>__{kafka}
<D>__{what have you done with gabriela rossmann?}
<C>__{murnau}
<D>__{as a matter of fact you've caught us in a state of considerable excitement. our latest preparation we believe we pray is perfected. it should take years off her.}
<A>__{he's concocting another potion now, pouring an acidic looking liquid from one container to another. kafka is looking increasingly worried.}
<C>__{murnau}
<D>__{and if not well, there are always what i call my caprices of vivisection.}
<A>__{he glances at the dangling animal parts. and now, finished mixing his cocktail, he picks up some sort of suturing tool, pressing the trigger on it to start the end burning and}
<B>__{sizzling.}
<C>__{murnau}
<D>__{actually, if it weren't for the aberrant dilemma posed by someone like yourself continually asking for out of date files i'd probably give up my revisionist policies altogether. i'm sure what we have to do is start instead at the very inception with the embryo from a single cell even.}
<P>__{(leers at kafka)}
<D>__{the lure of the golem the man made man. you appreciate that, i know.}
<A>__{ekman takes kafka by the arm to lead him toward the operating table. the laughing man moves in closer too, emitting a psychotic chortle.}
<C>__{murnau}
<D>__{to corrupt the image of man and then offer redemption ... this is the dawn, kafka. a new man is being born here. a more resilient man ... a superman.}
<A>__{kafka attempts an escape around the operating table, but the laughing man blocks his way and corrals him back to where he was before. dr. murnau holds out the sinister aperitif for kafka to take and drink in toast.}
<C>__{murnau}
<D>__{to a new world of gods and monsters.}
<A>__{the glass comes closer and closer to kafka's lips if he leans away from it any further he'll be lying on the operating table but now a wrenching noise makes everybody turn. the body of mr. pick, bloody and ragged, is dragged up with a smash through a breaking floor panel by the great chain. kafka has his chance. the next time anyone looks at him he's holding the nozzle of the burning device under ekman's throat, finger on the trigger. and on the other side of the laboratory a wide elevator platform rises into view carrying the prisoners from the dungeons!}
<B>__{kafka}
<A>__{throws ekman aside and runs away.}
<B>__{ekman}
<A>__{falls to the floor, holding his hands up over his head with a scream as the ghastly creatures from the depths converge on him but they pass him by intent on getting murnau. the last out of the elevator is the most horrible beast man yet and we finally see the use to which various animal parts have been put.}
<B>__{murnau}
<A>__{just stands by the operating table, waiting for them. he knows there's no way out and he's far too practical a man to waste energy running or screaming.}
