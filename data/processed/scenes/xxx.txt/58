<L>__{interior czech police building basement training area day}
<A>__{down in the basement there is a shooting range along one wall. a squad of czech cops is blasting away. they become distracted by the noise in the middle of the room. one of the metal boxes has been dropped by a cop. the rest are spread out in front of xander, slovo and shavers.}
<C>__{shavers}
<D>__{back off, just go away you klutz. alright, here's the story. the items in these cases belong to me. i designed them, built them, and was going to use them in the field myself until you showed up.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i stole your beat, huh? guess you forgot to brown nose the right people.}
<C>__{shavers}
<D>__{is that supposed to be funny? i'm not laughing. i've worked for ten years to get my shot at being a field agent, funny boy. and ar the last minute i get bumped by you, some reject from the ozzfest.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{why don't you show me some gear before you get hurt.}
<C>__{shavers}
<D>__{listen to you. right away, sir, anything you say, sir.}
<A>__{shavers pops open the first metal case. inside are various gadgets laid into the molded carbon fiber lining.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{what is all this? i didn't even order some of this stuff.}
<A>__{shavers holds up a small metal ball.}
<C>__{shavers}
<D>__{you're gonna need it, rookie, trust me.}
<A>__{the metal ball unrolls into a six legged robot insect.}
<C>__{shavers}
<D>__{an all terrain mobile video monitoring system for surveillance. i call it the "roach cam". see the little camera it's got for a head?}
<A>__{xander picks it up.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{kinda looks like you.}
<A>__{shavers snatches it back. he puts on a metal glove, it's fingers are sharp talons.}
<C>__{shavers}
<D>__{"terminator" climbing claws.}
<A>__{he clamps the claw onto the metal case. it holds fast.}
<C>__{shavers}
<D>__{miniature power cams set in on contact, giving you a sure grip on any surface.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{they come in any other styles or colors?}
<A>__{he tosses the glove aside, pulls out a dart gun.}
<C>__{shavers}
<D>__{this is your standard dart gun.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{that one i'm real familiar with.}
<A>__{shavers displays a case of darts.}
<C>__{shavers}
<D>__{you've got your chromium knock out dart, microphone listening dart, explosive dart, even one with a splatter blood packet, whatever you need. they also come in a special 9mm casing for use with your service pistol.}
<A>__{xander pulls out some super binoculars.}
<C>__{shavers}
<D>__{multi view binoculars. nine different enhanced vision modes, plus a digital camera.}
<A>__{xander looks through them, starts cycling through the different modes. binocular p.o.v. we see the various modes as xander scans the grounds.}
<C>__{shavers}
<D>__{infrared, starlight... even a special "penetrator" mode to see through walls, curtains, almost anything...}
<A>__{xander aims at the shooting range. binocular p.o.v. we see through the clothes of the female cops on the shooting range. (pg 13 style, of course). we can even see the inner workings of their guns. one of the female cops turns and gives xander an approving look.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i think i will hang on to these.}
<C>__{shavers}
<D>__{think again, that's government property. you have to sign for everything. i've got one more that wasn't on your list.}
<A>__{shavers pulls out a jumpsuit.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{from the beastie boys collection?}
<C>__{shavers}
<D>__{it's a stakeout suit. it's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. it's all weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{you're joking, right?}
<A>__{shavers just gives him a deadpan look.}
<C>__{shavers}
<D>__{now that i've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.}
<C>__{xander}
<D>__{i thought that was in detail.}
<A>__{as shavers drones on, xander hangs his head.}
