<L>__{exterior the battle of falkirk day}
<A>__{the scottish army moves out onto the hilly plain, covered in the gray mists. they see glimpses of the enemy in the distance. wallace deploys the scots: campbell with the schiltrons (spear formations), stephen with the infantry, the noble mornay leading the cavalry, and with wallace and hamish on horseback, looking over the field. hamish sees gazing up at an empty hill above the field.}
<C>__{hamish}
<D>__{the bruce is not coming, william.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{mornay has come. so will the bruce.}
<A>__{he'd better, the odds look long. and it's nasty ground; one side of the field is ankle deep in water, and the english are covering it with a layer of burning oil, releasing thick smoke to hide their movements.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{stephen ready?}
<C>__{hamish}
<D>__{aye.}
<A>__{the priest from their home village is moving through the scottish ranks, dispensing absolution. he reaches the two friends, who accept the host, say their own last prayers, and give each other a look of goodbye. hamish rides off to join the schiltrons.}
<B>__{longshanks and his generals}
<A>__{on the opposite side of the field, send their army forward.}
<B>__{wallace and the scots}
<A>__{see them through the smoke; wallace spots what he's looking for: there they are, the ranks of crossbowmen! and as they draw nearer, wallace hears a haunting noise. he sees the bowmen more clearly, and the english infantry. some are wearing kilts and marching to bagpipes.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{irish troops!}
<A>__{stephen of ireland, with the scottish infantry he stares at the approach of his countrymen. wallace appears beside him. stephen sees him, and is ashamed.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{so that's where longshanks got his soldiers. irishmen, willing to kill scottish cousins for the english.}
<C>__{william}
<D>__{their families are starving, they'll feed them however they can. if you don't want to fight them }
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{no. i will stand with you.}
<A>__{loyal to the end. wallace signals to hamish and campbell, among the schiltrons. the formations, bristling with spears, move forward. hamish looks back at wallace; both men know the spearmen are the bait here. wallace and stephen see the english heavy cavalry advancing.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{they can't be that stupid to attack the schiltrons again.}
<A>__{wallace is scanning the battlefield. he sees the english cavalry charge, but before they reach the bristling spears, they pull up, and crossbowmen, moving up behind the knights.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{it's only a faint to shield the crossbows!}
<A>__{the crossbowmen fire a volley, too hurriedly. we see the hailstorm of bolts slash through the air in unison you can actually see them coming. the bows fall short of the front ranks of the schiltrons.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{now! give 'em the dogs!}
<A>__{stephen signals, and up the slope behind them come handlers with ten war dogs. huge mastiffs, they wear steel collars, with razor sharp protrusions. their handlers hold them at the end of long catch poles. the crossbowmen are distracted from their reloading by the appearance of the mastiffs; now, as the scottish handlers run toward the english ranks and unleash the dogs, fear races through the english line. the dogs tear into them. it is chaos; the bowmen can't flee, and as the dogs mix among them, the bowmen fire frantically, mostly hitting each other. the dogs' collars slash legs; their jaws crush bones; even when their back legs are hacked off, the frenzied dogs keep killing. wallace signals to mornay with the scottish cavalry. mornay does nothing. the crossbowmen, though taking great punishment, are beginning to overwhelm the dogs by sheer numbers, and are regrouping.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{now! charge! charge them!}
<A>__{mornay tugs his reins and leads his cavalry away.}
<B>__{at the english command}
<A>__{longshanks and his officers see mornay and his cavalry melt away. the english general looks knowingly at longshanks.}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{mornay?}
<C>__{longshanks}
<D>__{for double his lands in scotland, and matching estates in england.}
<A>__{wallace, with stephen they see the scottish army abandoned.}
<C>__{stephen}
<D>__{betrayed!}
<A>__{wallace glances to the other hilltop; still no sign of bruce. he looks on in agony as the crossbowmen unleash another volley. the scottish spearmen, bunched in a tight group, are helpless. the bolts fall, cutting through their helmets and breastplates like paper. wallace has no cavalry and his men are being slaughtered! he spurs his horse, and stephen and the infantrymen race behind him. the english heavy cavalry surge to meet them, but wallace weaves through them, dodging with his horse, slashing with the broadsword, cutting down on knight, another, another... the scottish infantry claws in, dragging down the horses, hacking the knights as they run by. the english bowmen are about to fire again, but they see the scottish charge bearing down on them and adjust their aim; the bolts cut into the infantrymen; one bolt tears off the armor of wallace's left shoulder. he wobbles on his horse, regains his balance, and keeps up the charge.}
<B>__{at the english command}
<A>__{longshanks and his generals are watching the action.}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{my god, and still they come!}
<C>__{longshanks}
<D>__{use the reinforcements! but take wallace alive!}
<A>__{the general signals and the english reinforcements surge into the battle.}
<B>__{in the thick of the battle}
<A>__{on horseback, wallace fights his way into the watery edge of the field, where english infantry is now overrunning the schiltron. he hacks men down left and right, reaches the scottish center, and finds hamish bending over another soldier. wallace dismounts.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{hamish! ham }
<A>__{and wallace sees that hamish is holding his father, fallen in battle. wallace has no time to react; he cuts down and english swordsman moving in to hack hamish's back. wallace lifts campbell across the saddle, and shouts at hamish...}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{get him away!}
<A>__{hamish obeys, jumping onto the horse and galloping back toward the rear. wallace fights with new vengeance, swinging the double edged broadsword with deadly accuracy. rallied by wallace's presence, the scots surge back. then wallace sees the english reinforcement cavalry coming.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{a charge! form up! form up!}
<A>__{the scots pull up spears and hastily form another schiltron. the spears bristle out, ready... the english horsemen thunder in. but before the spears impale the horses, another flight of crossbow bolts cuts down half the scots still fighting. hamish reaches the rear of the battle and lowers the limp body of his father to the scottish monks who are attending to the wounded and giving absolution to the dying... still wallace fights back, meeting the english charge. the scots hold their own. an english knight tries to ride over william; he knocks the lance aside, and tough the horse slams into him, william also unseats the rider. the rider rolls to his feet. william struggles up to meet him and comes face to face with robert the bruce. the shock and recognition stun wallace; in that moment, looking at robert the bruce's guilt ridden face, he understands everything: the betrayal, the hopelessness of scotland. as he stands there frozen, a bolt punches into the muscle of his neck, and wallace doesn't react to it. bruce is horrified at the sight of wallace this way. he batters at wallace's sword, as if its use would give him absolution.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{fight me! fight me!}
<A>__{but wallace can only stagger back. bruce's voice grows ragged as he screams.}
<C>__{robert}
<D>__{fight me!}
<A>__{all around, the battle has decayed; the scots are being slaughtered. another bolt glances off wallace's helmet; a third rips into his thigh plate, making his legs collapse. suddenly stephen comes through the melee, on robert's horse! he hits robert from behind, knocking him down, and jumps to the ground to try and lift william onto the horse! robert sees a knot of crossbowmen moving up, sighting out wallace, taking careful aim! bruce leaps up and helps stephen sling wallace onto the back of the horse, even covers him with his shield, deflecting another bolt fired at wallace, as stephen mounts too. as the horse plunges away into the smoke, robert falls to the water. his own troops reach him, realize who he is, see the horrible expression on his face, and race on after the scots. robert is left alone, on his knees in the water, the fire and noise of battle now dim to him, as if his senses have died along with his heart.}
<B>__{longshanks}
<A>__{looks over the battlefield, strewn with the bodies of the scottish dead. for now, he is satisfied.}
