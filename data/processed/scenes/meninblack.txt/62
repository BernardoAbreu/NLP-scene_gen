<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{exterior highway side of the road day}
<A>__{the ltd is now stopped by the side of the road, dust swirling around it. ahead of it, another car has pulled over. kay gets out, jay follows a moment later, shaky legged. kay walks up to the window of the car they've stopped. the driver, a guy in his mid thirties with a wife in her mid thirties, rolls the window down.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{license and registration, please.}
<A>__{the driver hands over some documents. kay flips through them.}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{other license and registration, please.}
<A>__{the guy digs out two other cards and hands those over. jay peers over kay's shoulder. the photographs on the "resident alien id"cards are of two friendly looking reptile types, husband and wife, smiling atthe camera, their long, skinny tongues dangling in a friendly sort of way. kay hands them back.}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{your resident card has you restricted to the five boroughs only. where do you think you're going?}
<C>__{redgick}
<D>__{it's my wife! she's she's well, look!}
<A>__{kay leans down and looks in the window. mrs. redgick is in front, moaning in pain, holding her swollen belly. kay straightens up, fast.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{oh god. how soon?}
<A>__{mrs. redgick screams in pain. real soon. for the first time since we've seen him, kay is nervous.}
<C>__{kay }
<D>__{okay. all right. no big deal.}
<P>__{(to jay)}
<D>__{you handle it.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{me?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{sure, it's easy, you just sorta catch.}
<A>__{mrs. redgick screams again. redgick gets out of the car, worried.}
<C>__{redgick}
<D>__{are you sure he knows what he's doing?}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{yeah, hell, sure, he does this all the time. c'mon, let him work, redgick, i wanna ask you something.}
<A>__{kay gives jay a supportive slap on the back and leads redgick away, to the rear of the car. jay stays in the background and opens the rear door, tentatively. he leans down, into the car.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{oh god! i see it i see it i see it!}
<A>__{a few yards from the car, kay turns redgick to face him.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{croagg the midwife's back on 64th and 8th. you were headed out of town.}
<C>__{redgick}
<D>__{well, we're, uh meeting someone.}
<A>__{suddenly a tentacle whips out from between mrs. redgick's legs, cracks the whip once, and wraps around the door post, grabbing hold.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{oh sweet jesus mother of god did you see that?!}
<C>__{kay}
<P>__{(still to redgick)}
<D>__{so? who you meeting?}
<C>__{redgick}
<D>__{well, it's a ship.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{really? i didn't see a departure clearance for today.}
<C>__{redgick}
<D>__{you didn't? uh, well it was an emergency.}
<A>__{now a second tentacle whips out, but this one wraps around jay's neck and pulls tight. he gasps, choking.}
<C>__{jay}
<D>__{guys guys }
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{doin' fine, ace.}
<P>__{(back to redgick)}
<D>__{what kind of emergency? what's the rush to get off the planet all of a sudden?}
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(choking to death)}
<D>__{help?! help! hello?!}
<A>__{he starts tugging for all he's worth, but the fight is sort of going against him, as the tentacles pull him in even harder than he tries to pull the baby out.}
<C>__{redgick}
<D>__{we just don't like the neighborhood anymore. some of the new arrivals.}
<A>__{redgick looks at kay, clearly concealing something, but darts his eyes away.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{what new arrivals? this have anything to do with the crasher from last night?}
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(screaming)}
<D>__{can you guys do this later?!}
<A>__{but in that moment, jay finally gets a foot up on the door frame, acquires leverage, and rips the baby free. he falls, flat on his back in the dirt, the multi tentacled lizardlike baby resting squarely on his chest.}
<C>__{jay }
<D>__{oh oh oh man.}
<A>__{kay turns and claps redgick on the back.}
<C>__{kay}
<D>__{congratulations! it's a lizard.}
<A>__{jay looks down at the creature cooing and nestling on his chest.}
<C>__{jay}
<P>__{(misty)}
<D>__{hey, you know, it is sorta }
<A>__{it vomits on him.}
