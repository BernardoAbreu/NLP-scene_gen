<L>__{interior ben's kitchen day}
<A>__{six cuts, like six knife gashes, revealed on the blood stained buttocks of gordon's son, who stands in painful, truculent embarrassment. ben is shocked by the severity of the canning.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{that's not why i'm complaining, mister ben, sir. if he did wrong, i'd beat him myself. but he didn't.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{he did nothing and they wouldn't listen. they wouldn't believe him.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i'm sorry, gordon. but there must be a reason.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{he says he wasn't doing anything wrong, mister ben, sir. and i believe him, i know my son! it's an injustice!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{what about the court? didn't he state his case?}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{what does he know about court? before he knew, it was all over.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i don't think there is anything we can do about it now.}
<A>__{outside, peering through the half opened door, is johan, shocked at what he sees. ben tapes jonathan on the head, he pulls up his shorts painfully, yet fiercely, anxious to cover himself up again.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{we can get a lawyer to appeal.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{a lawyer? that won't heal jonathan's buttocks.}
<A>__{susan appears at the door.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{ben!}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{i will be out in a minute.}
<A>__{she nods, ushering johan away from the door back outside.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{you don't understand, mister ben, sir. i don't want him to have a police record.}
<C>__{gordon }
<D>__{it will be there for the rest of his life and make it difficult for him to get a job in the future.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{don't worry, gordon. i'm sure there'll be no record, it's such a minor case. please don't worry.}
<A>__{ben calls johan from the outside.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{johan, get some iodine from the cupboard.}
<A>__{johan rushes in the house.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{i'm not worried about the wounds. they'll heal in time, mister ben, sir. it's the wounds here.}
<P>__{(slaps his chest)}
<D>__{i worry about. injustice... it festers.}
<A>__{johan comes back with a small bottle of medicine.}
<C>__{ben}
<P>__{(to gordon)}
