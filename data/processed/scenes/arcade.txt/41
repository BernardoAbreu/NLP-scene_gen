<L>__{exterior laurie's house, back porch day}
<A>__{the backyard is in a sorry state, with junk strewn everywhere. there's a cannibalized car, piles of scrap wood, and a swing set that's hopelessly rusted. alex winds her way to the back porch and a set of dusty glass doors. she steps up and clears a spot to look through.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(visibly relieved)}
<D>__{she's here!}
<A>__{nick joins her at the window, peering inside.}
<B>__{their p.o.v.}
<A>__{they are looking into a cluttered living room, dark except for the light that's issuing from the television. the television faces away from us, but we can see laurie, siting in front of it, mesmerized.}
<B>__{laurie}
<A>__{she looks like shit. wan, with sunken eyes and mussed up hair. mascara has run down her cheeks, and even now, tears are trickling from her eyes. yet despite this, there's a dazed smile on her face. we can't hear her, but she seems to be talking to the television.}
<B>__{alex}
<A>__{steps back a moment, concerned.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{it is the game.}
<A>__{she taps on the window.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{laurie!}
<A>__{inside, laurie continues to watch the screen, oblivious to the rest of the world. alex taps the harder, using her fist now.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(louder)}
<D>__{laurie!}
<A>__{nick joins alex now, and the two of them are banging on the glass. there's no way in hell laurie wouldn't be able to hear them. alex steps back from the window again, panicking.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{nick, what do we do?!}
<A>__{alex looks around, sees a two by four, and snags it.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{no, alex! alex, wait a minute...}
<A>__{alex swings the two by four like a club and smash!!! down comes the glass in a shower.}
