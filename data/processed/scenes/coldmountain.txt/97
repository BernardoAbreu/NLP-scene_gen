<A>__{junior, inman and veasey come around a bend and there's a big cabin looming. it's in such poor repair that one end has slipped from the stones which serve as it's foundation and stands badly tilted over. junior roots up another hidden jug of liquor, which he drinks from, then hands to veasey.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{there's my place. hope you can stomach a yard chock full of females. brought my woman home, she showed up with her three so called sisters and their brats. the noise in that place is something awful. it's why i go hunting.}
