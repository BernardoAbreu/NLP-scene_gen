<A>__{he turns to run, but knocks back into the feet of the hanged man behind him! in blind panic he darts in another direction, and runs into another corpse, and another; the hanged men begin to swing, making it harder for william's father and older brother to fight their way to him.}

<A>__{william has cooked stew in a pot, and now spoons up two steaming bowls full and sets them out on the table. but he is only hoping. he looks out the window again; he is still all alone. so he leaves a candle burning on the table beside the stew, and moves up the stairs.}

<A>__{william has been awake all night, afraid to sleep. he rises, and in quick cuts: he dresses; he moves down the hall, stops at the door of his father's bedroom and sees the undisturbed bed. he moves on, passing the door of his brother's room, also unrumpled.}

<A>__{william is in the barn loft, shoveling corn down to feed the hogs, while he glimpses something coming. the boy's pov an ox cart is coming down the curving lane. its driver is campbell, with macclannough walking behind it. the farmers glance up at william, their faces grim... from his perch in the loft, william sees that the neighbors have brought: the bodies of his father and brother. the cart stops; campbell, with a bandage around his left hand where more of his fingers are now missing, studies the back of the ox, as if it could tell him how to break such news. the butt of the ox seems to tell him to be matter of fact.}
<C>__{campbell}
<D>__{william... come down here, lad.}
<A>__{william looks away, he takes quick breaths, he looks back... but the bodies are still there.}

<L>__{interior the shed day}
<A>__{on a table the undertaker has laid out the bodies and is preparing them. cloths around the lower jaw and top of the head bind their mouths shut; pennies cover their eyes. softly, william enters the shed, drawn to his father and brother. campbell follows him in, wanting to stop him but what can he say now? the undertaker goes on with his work. william approaches the table; the bodies don't look real to him. he sees the wounds. the dried blood. the undertake pours water from a bowl and scrubs off the blood. but the wounds remain.}
<L>__{exterior graveside day}
<A>__{close on a grave, with a headstone marked anne wallace. we include the two new graves freshly dug beside it, and see the mourners gathered before them. the sight of the boy, standing alone in front of the graves of his dead mother, as the bodies of his father and brother are lowered with ropes into the ground beside her, has all of the neighbors shaken. the local parish priest drones mechanically in latin. the farmers who were secretly gathered in malcolm wallace's kitchen the previous night are now glancing at william; but no one is anxious to adopt a grieving, a rebellious boy. behind macclannough are his wife and two daughters; his youngest is barely four, not half william's age; she's a beautiful girl with long auburn hair, and she clings to her own mother's hand, as if the open graves are the mouths of death and might suck her parents in too.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{...restare in pacem eternis, amen.}
<A>__{with the final amen, the neighbors drift from the graveside, pulling their children along, to give william a last moment of private grief before the grave diggers cover the bodies. the boy stands alone over the open graves, his heart so shattered that he can scarcely cry; a single tear makes its way down his face. and the tiny girl feels for william in a way that the adults cannot. from the ground she pulls a scottish thistle, moves to the softly weeping william and places the beautiful wild blossom in his hand. william looks up and their young eyes meet; her sad blue eyes hold william's as the grave diggers cover the bodies. then a lone, mounted figure appears at the crest of the hill above them. tall, thin and angular, in black clerical garb, he looks like the grim reaper. the girl hurries back to her mother's side; everyone watches in silence as the figure rides down to them. he is argyle wallace. he looks like a human buzzard, his face craggy, permanently furious.}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{you must be the relative of the deceased... william, this is your uncle argyle.}
<A>__{argyle glowers at the man, dismounts, and glares at william. william stares up at this frightening figure. they are interrupted by the ominous sound of approaching horses; a dozen mounted english soldiers, armed with lances, are approaching. argyle rattles to the priest...}

<C>__{people}
<D>__{wallace! it's william wallace! god bless wallace and scotland!}
<A>__{at a crossroads, more of wallace's men join them, in clusters. one group carries something long, encased in wool covers. farmers in the field, blacksmiths at their forges, leave their work and uncover their inevitable weapons and run after the riders. they put on their forbidden tartans, kiss their wives and head off to fight.}
<L>__{exterior stirling field day}
<A>__{stirling castle perches on a hill high above a grassy field, cut in half by a river, spanned by an old wooden bridge. scottish nobles have gathered on a smaller hill overlooking the field; they wear gleaming armor, with plumes, sashes and banners, and are attended by squires and grooms. the mists of morning shroud most of the field. but from the opposite side of the bridge they hear the clattering of a huge army moving forward. lochlan, a noble, gallops to mornay.}
<C>__{lochlan}
<D>__{it sounds like twenty thousand!}
<C>__{mornay}
<D>__{the scouts say it is ten.}
<C>__{lochlan}
<D>__{and we have but two!}
<B>__{the common scottish soldiers}
<A>__{are wearing padded leather shirts, and carry pikes and daggers. as through the mists they see the numbers arrayed against them, a young soldier tugs at a grizzled veteran.}
<C>__{young soldier}
<D>__{so many!}
<C>__{scottish veteran}
<D>__{the nobles will negotiate. if they deal, they send us home. if not, we charge. when we are all dead and they can call themselves brave, they withdraw.}
<C>__{young soldier}
<D>__{i didn't come to fight so they could own more lands that i could work for them!}
<C>__{veteran}
<D>__{nor did i. not against these odds!}
<A>__{he lowers his pike and starts to desert. at first one by one and then in clumps, more highlanders follow. the nobles see the desertion.}
<C>__{lochlan}
<D>__{stop! men! do not flee! not now! wait until we have negotiated!}
<C>__{mornay}
<D>__{they won't stop and who could blame them?}
<A>__{then, riding into the mob of men, comes wallace, followed by his friends. he's striking, charismatic, his powerful arms bare, his chest covered not in armor but a commoner's leather shirt, and unlike the heavy knights on their armored horses, wallace rides a swift horse, like he was born on it. the entire scottish army watches in fascination as wallace and his men ride through them, toward the command hill. the soldiers whisper among themselves...}
<C>__{young soldier}
<D>__{william wallace?}
<C>__{veteran}
<D>__{couldn't be.}
<A>__{the common soldiers, already having broken ranks, cluster up the hill to see the confrontation. as wallace and his captains reach the nobles, stephen laughs.}

<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{i give homage to scotland. and if this is your army, why does it go?}
<A>__{wallace reins his horse around to face the mob of sullen men, now frightened, ready to desert. we play this picture, wallace sitting his horse, looking down in awe at this thing that has grown beyond anyone's imagination. he glances at his friends: campbell, hamish, stephen. they've got no suggestions, they're just as awed as he is.}

<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{i am william wallace. and my enemies do not go away. i saw our good nobles hanged. my wife... i am william wallace. and i see a whole army of my countrymen, here in defiance of tyranny. you have come to fight as free men. and free men you are! what will you do with freedom? will you fight?}
<C>__{veteran}
<D>__{two thousand, against ten? we will run and live!}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{yes. fight and you may die. run and you will live, at least awhile. and dying in your bed many years from now, would you be willing to trade all the days from this day to that, for one chance to come back here as young men, and tell our enemies that they make take our lives, but they will never take our freedom?}

<D>__{fine speech. now what do we do?}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{bring out our spearmen and set them in the field.}
<A>__{campbell, hamish and stephen ride off. mornay reins his horse over, lifts the reins of wallace's horse, and extends them to him: an invitation to join the pre battle talks. wallace mounts up and rides out with the scottish nobles to meet the english contingent. out on the field, the two groups of riders meet like the captains of football teams before the kickoff. cheltham, head of the english contingent, glares at wallace.}

<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{from his king? absolutely. here are scotland's terms. lower your flags and march straight to england, stopping at every scottish home you pass to beg forgiveness for a hundred years of theft, rape, and murder. do that, and your men shall live. do it not, and every one of you will die today.}
<A>__{cheltham barks at the scottish nobles...}
<C>__{cheltham}
<D>__{you are outmatched! you haven't even any cavalry! in two centuries no army has won without it!}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{i'm not finished. before we let you leave, your commander must cross that bridge, stand before this army, put his head between his legs, and kiss his own ass.}
<A>__{the outraged englishman gallops back to his lines.}
<C>__{mornay}
<D>__{i'd say that was rather less cordial that he was used to.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{be ready, and do exactly as i say.}
<A>__{they return to the scottish lines. wallace dismounts where his men are breaking out new 14 foot spears. hamish, eyebrows raised, looks expectantly at wallace; wallace nods.}
<C>__{hamish}
<D>__{wish i could see the noble lord's face when he tells him.}
<A>__{lord talmadge, at his command post the husky english commander's blood boils from cheltham's report. before he can respond, they see wallace's spearmen taking up a position on the far side of the bridge. suddenly the scots turn and lift their kilts and moon the english!}

<B>__{the cavalry on the other side of the bridge}
<A>__{the english knights see the signal banners, telling them to attack. they take the lances from their squires, and lower the visors of their helmets. proud, plumed, glimmering; they look invincible. their huge horses, themselves draped in scarlet and purple, look like tanks. the knights charge! their hooves thunder; the horses are so heavy the ground literally shakes with the charge. the scots stand and watch them come on. it's difficult to imagine the courage this takes; from the pov of the scottish lines we see the massive horses boring in... we feel the rising thunder of the charge, closer, closer... wallace moves to the front of the lead group of scots.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{steady! hold... hold... now!}
<A>__{the scots snap their 14 foot spears straight up in unison.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{form!}
<A>__{now the spearmen snap the spears forward in ranks, the first line of men bracing their spears at an angle three feet above the ground, the men behind them bracing theirs at a five foot level, the men behind that bracing at seven feet. the english knights have never seen such a formation. their lances are useless and it's too late to stop! the momentum that was to carry the horses smashing through the men on foot now becomes suicidal force; knights and horses impale themselves on the long spears like beef on skewers.}
<B>__{talmadge}
<A>__{can see it; but worse is the sound, the screams of dying men and horses, carried to him across the battlefield.}
<B>__{wallace and his men}
<A>__{are protected, behind a literal wall of fallen chargers and knights. wallace draws his broadsword and leads his swordsmen out onto the field, attacking the knights that are still alive. most are off their horses; a few have managed to pull up their mounts. wallace and his men are so much more mobile than the knights; the field runs with blood. wallace faces talmadge in the distance.}

<A>__{the english leaders try to herd more of their footsoldiers onto the bridge, which only hams them up. meanwhile, on the other side of the bridge, wallace and his charging men slam into the english infantry with wild fury. the english fall back on each other, further blocking the bridge.}

<C>__{mornay}
<D>__{he's taking the bloody bridge! the english can't get across! he's evened the odds at one stroke!}
<A>__{with rising desire to join the bandwagon, the nobles spur... down on the plain, wallace and the attacking men drive the english back, killing as they go. the scots reach the bridge itself. the waters below it run red with blood. talmadge has begun to panic.}

<C>__{general}
<D>__{they're too close, we'll shoot out own men!}
<B>__{on the bridge}
<A>__{the scots are carving their way through the english soldiers; nothing can stop them. wallace is relentless; each time he swings, a head flies, or an arm. hamish and stephen fight beside him, swinging the broadsword with both hands. old campbell loses his shield in the grappling; an english swordsman whacks at him and takes off his left hand, but campbell batters him to the ground with his right, and stabs him. reaching the english side of the bridge, the scots begin to build a barrier with the dead bodies. the english are not without courage. cheltham leads a desperate counterattack. the scots make an impenetrable barrier of slashing blades. still cheltham keeps coming; wallace hits him with a vertical slash that parts his helmet, his hair, and his brain. talmadge has seen enough; he gallops away. the remaining english general tries to save the army.}
<C>__{general}
<D>__{we are still five thousand! rally!}
<A>__{the english try to form up; but the scottish horsemen, fording the river high upstream, come crashing into the english flank and ride over the surprised english infantry. at the bridge, wallace sees the scottish nobles attacking. the english soldiers are in utter panic, running and being cut down on all sides. and the scottish soldiers taste something scots have not tasted for a hundred years: victory. even while finishing off the last of the english soldiers, they begin their highlow chant... even the noblemen take up the chant! wallace looks around at the aftermath of the battle: bodies on the field; soldiers lying impaled; stacks of bodies on the bridge; the bridge slick with blood. before it can all sink in, william is lifted on the shoulders of his men.}

<D>__{wal lace, wal lace!!}
<A>__{wallace lifts his eyes, taking it all in. at the rear of the hall is a balcony, backed by a magnificent sunlit stained glass window, and in the center of its rainbow corona he sees a familiar form: marion, so real to him in this moment of triumph that he can see her, glowing like an angel, in a gown worthy of the occasion. but the illusion won't last; in the blink of an eye she is gone, and wallace hears the chant, and fingers the cloth she gave him.}
<L>__{interior scottish council day}
<A>__{the nobles of scotland are gathered in the huge chamber; a massive table runs across the far end of the room, and aligned on either side are the two rival factions of nobles, glaring at each other. old craig is in the center, with young robert the bruce on his right. there is a general murmur along the nobles, and robert whispers to craig...}

<A>__{the nobles rise; court attendants hurry to wallace and drape a golden chain of office around his neck. wallace takes the three smaller chains they bring and drapes them around the necks of his friends, as once again the nobles applaud. almost before the applause dies, a member of the balliol clan, who has kept an open seat beside him, speaks up...}
<C>__{balliol}
<D>__{sir william!! inasmuch as you and your captains hail from a region long known to support the balliol clan, may we invite you to join us?}

<D>__{no. but from top to bottom this country has no sense of itself. its nobles share allegiance with england and its clans war with each other. if you make enemies on both sides of the border, you'll end up dead.}

<C>__{magistrate}
<D>__{wonderful, isn't it, that a man remains conscious through such pain. enough?}
<A>__{wallace shakes his head. the executioners cut off his clothes, take hot irons from a fire box. the crowd grows silent; we see them, not wallace, as the irons are touched to his body, but we hear the burning of flesh. then the magistrate signals; wallace wants to say something.}
<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{that... will... clear your sinuses.}
<A>__{everyone hears; hamish smiles, even through his tears. rebuffed, the magistrate nods to the executioners, who lift the terrible instruments of dissection. we are spared seeing the cutting: we are on wallace's face as the disembowelment begins. the magistrate leans in beside him.}
<C>__{magistrate}
<D>__{it can all end. right now! bliss. peace. just say it. cry out. "mercy!" yes?... yes?}

<C>__{wallace}
<D>__{freeeee dommmmmm!}
<A>__{the shout rings through the town. hamish hears it. the princess hears it, at her open window, and touches her tummy, just showing the first signs of her pregnancy. longshanks and his son seem to hear; the cry still echoes as if the wind could carry it through the ends of scotland; and robert the bruce, on the walls of his castle, looks up sharply, as if he has heard...}
<B>__{in the london square}
<A>__{the crowd has never seen courage like this; even english strangers begin to weep. the angry, defeated magistrate gives a signal. they cut the ropes, drag wallace over and put his head on the block. the executioner lifts his huge axe and wallace looks toward the crowd. the crowd, wallace's pov he sees hamish, eyes brimming, face glowing... slow motion the axe begins to drop. wallace's pov in the last half moment of his life, when he has already stepped into the world beyond this one, he glimpses someone standing at hamish's shoulder. she is beautiful, smiling, serene. she is marion.}

<B>__{robert the bruce}
<A>__{his face has changed. he is standing at the open grave where marion lay, the headstone carved with the thistle still there. he holds the handkerchief. as he tucks it into his own pocket, and we move in on his eyes, we realize the voice over belongs to him.}

<D>__{it did not have the effect that longshanks planned.}
<A>__{more young men put on tartans, take up their weapons, and gather into fighting units. among them is hamish, carrying a shield emblazoned with a cocked arm holding a broadsword, and the words "for freedom."}
<L>__{exterior scottish highlands day}
<A>__{robert the bruce, flanked by the noblemen and the banners of the scottish throne, and backed by a ragtag army of scots, sits on his horse and looks down at the english generals in their martial finery. the english are haughty, victorious, at the head of their colorful, polished army, awaiting the ceremony of submission from scotland's new king.}
<C>__{robert }
<D>__{and i, robert the bruce, backed by a body of scottish veterans, rode out to pay homage to the armies of the english king, and accept his endorsement of my crown.}

<D>__{i hope you washed your ass this mornin it's never been kissed by a king before.}
<A>__{up on the hill, robert the bruce sits on his horse, and waits. he looks down at the english generals, at their banners, their army. he looks down the ranks at his own. he sees hamish. stephen. old macclannough is there, his eyes watery, his weapon sharp. the scottish bride lord bottoms took is there, among the ragtag archers, her husband beside her. robert knows none of them yet he knows them all. old craig, among the other scottish nobles mounted beside the bruce, grows impatient.}
<C>__{craig}
<D>__{come, let's get it over with.}

<A>__{the chant builds to a frenzy; it shakes the earth. the scottish nobles can scarcely believe it; the english are shocked even more. robert the bruce, king of scotland, spurs his horse into full gallop toward the english, and the highlanders hurl their bodies down the hill, ready to run through hell itself. in slow motion we see their faces... and over this, we hear the voice of william wallace...}
<C>__{wallace's voice}
<D>__{in the year of our lord 1314, patriots of scotland, starving and outnumbered, charged the fields of bannockburn. they fought like warrior poets. they fought like scotsmen. and won their freedom. forever.}
