<A>__{the blue helmeted yuri is seated in a white u.n. armored personnel carrier, the background behind him morphs from one third world location to another: third world desert to third world rainforest to third world slum.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{the fastest way to find out you can't change the world is to actually go there.}
<L>__{exterior nrfl rebel headquarters northern liberia. day.}
<A>__{poolside at a recently captured southern style colonial mansion, a long way from georgia.}

<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{west africa's liberia, or "land of the free", was originally established in the 1800's as a homeland for freed american negroes. it's been enslaved by one dictator or another ever since. they even copied their masters' southern architecture.}
<A>__{a tatty pile of weapons some from world war ii sits in front of a long negotiating table. yuri, blue beret, observes the chief u.n. envoy at the table opposite warlord andre baptiste, leader of the national revolutionary front of liberia (nrfl). baptiste, 40's, is an imposing figure. in full uniform despite the heat, he wears a jacket one size too small as if he cannot admit his extra few pounds. his third wife stands next to him, wiping the sweat from his brow like an intermittent windscreen wiper.}
<C>__{yuri }
<D>__{it was my first meeting with the american educated andre roosevelt baptiste. while the warning signs were all there, no one had any idea what a monster he would eventually become. i certainly didn't think he would become my friend.}
<A>__{baptiste has a u.n. document in front of him, awaiting his signature, clearly enjoying his moment in the sun.}
<C>__{u.n. envoy}
<P>__{(referring to the meager pile of weapons)}
<D>__{ with all due respect, mr. baptiste, you don't seriously expect us to believe that this represents your entire arsenal.}
<A>__{baptiste shrugs.}
<C>__{u.n. envoy }
<D>__{this is making a nonsense of the embargo ratified by all five permanent members of the security council. the escalation in the build up of arms jeopardizes not only order in the region but ultimately world order.}
<A>__{baptiste smiles.}
<C>__{baptiste}
<P>__{(playing to the gallery)}
<D>__{ world order? you say we jeopardize world order?}
<A>__{baptiste's third wife wipes his brow.}
<C>__{baptiste }
<D>__{your idea of world order is when you're giving the orders to the world.}
<A>__{the envoy has no response. baptiste rises from the table, leaving the unsigned document sitting there.}
<C>__{baptiste }
<D>__{excuse me.}
<A>__{baptiste is accompanied by two armed bodyguards. yuri's commanding officer, captain vivian carlisle, motions for one of her detail to follow yuri.}
<C>__{baptiste}
<P>__{(irritated by yuri's presence)}
<D>__{i am only going to the restroom.}
<C>__{yuri}
<P>__{(shrug)}
<D>__{orders.}
<A>__{they reach the door marked, "men".}
<C>__{baptiste}
<P>__{(aside to his bodyguards as he enters)}
<D>__{this is what they mean by u.n. observer?}
<A>__{yuri winces at the remark.}
