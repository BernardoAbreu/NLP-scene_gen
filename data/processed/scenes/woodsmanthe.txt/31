<L>__{exterior walter's apartment day}
<A>__{walter crosses the street outside of his apartment and heads towards the bus stop. a white volvo is parked along the road. a man sits inside the car looking out towards the school. the engine is off. he's in his twenties, good build, nice clothes. walter looks at the man as he passes by. the man doesn't notice him, his attention fixed down the street. walter looks in the direction of his gaze. the schoolyard is quiet except for a couple of students running in. walter looks back at the man. the man doesn't notice him. walter hurries to his bus stop.}
