<B>__{aboard ship}
<A>__{indiana, scraggy, clare and betsy are gathered on the deck. seated in a circle. they are surrounded by the crew members. everyone eats their dinner from tin cans. the surrounding lanterns cast an eerie light on the area. the young crew member plays a soft, spooky tune on his guitar. betsy is restless. she glares at the guitar player.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{don't you know somethin' else? somethin' upbeat?...}
<A>__{the guitar player ignores betsy, continuing to play. betsy sighs.}
<B>__{upset. bored.}

<D>__{we have to keep moving.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{can we at least jump in the water?... go for a swim?...}
<C>__{clare}
<D>__{there's an old legend about the zambesi... in ancient times, criminals were given their choice of execution...or swimming across the zambesi. most chose execution.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{clare's right. we'll be safer on the boat.}
<P>__{(annoyed, to betsy)}
<D>__{now quit moanin' and eat your food.}
<A>__{an angry betsy tosses her tin can overboard. she stands. furious with indiana.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{you are so rude! i travel thousands of miles just to be with you...and everybody treats me like dirt!}
<P>__{(to clare)}
<D>__{nobody even talks to me without making some condescending remark they think i'm too stupid to understand!}
<P>__{(very upset)}
<D>__{so maybe i don't know a lot about weird tribal dances... i'm still pretty good with anthropology and archeology... maybe i could even help you out...if somebody gave me a chance...clued me in to what it is we're doin' here...}
<P>__{(to indy)}
<D>__{'cause whether you like it or not, indiana jones... i'm part of this expedition, too!}
<A>__{clare raises an eyebrow. impressed. indiana says nothing. he can't argue. scraggy interjects.}
<C>__{scraggy}
<P>__{(motions to crew members)}
<D>__{my friends also curious about where we journey to, indy.}
<A>__{the crew members nod. staring at indiana. indiana turns to clare. she}
<B>__{smiles.}
<C>__{clare}
<D>__{tell us all a bedtime story, doctor jones.}
<A>__{indiana sighs. the crew member's guitar playing combines with the sound track, backing up indiana's story with an eerie tune.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{long ago...a place known as the flower fruit mountain, in the chinese province of ao lai...was struck by lightning. a stone monkey, "sun wu kung", was born.}
<C>__{scraggy}
<D>__{this monkey?... he could walk?... talk?... like human?...}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{more than human. he was blessed with countless heavenly powers... but it wasn't enough. sun wu kung wanted to learn the secret of eternal life... of immortality...}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{equipped with his golden hooped rod to protect him, sun wu kung travelled the world for many years ...learning the secret philosophies and teachings of eternal youth. eventually, he was granted entrance to heaven...where the jade emperor gave sun wu kung the title of "great sage of the heavens"...and permitted him to oversee the garden of immortal peaches.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{after several years, the stone monkey returned to somewhere on earth. here, he ruled an empire...a civilization of monkeys and humans who had life spans of many hundred years...}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{the exact whereabouts of that lost city has been a mystery for hundreds of years...until doctor clarke discovered the pygmy.}
<A>__{the crew members, scraggy, betsy and clare, listen with fascination.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{it's uncertain just how much of this legend is based in reality... nevertheless, we're hoping to find some sign of the lost civilization.}
<C>__{betsy}
<D>__{what about sun wu kung?...}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{whatever he was...a stone idol...an actual monkey...a human being...is unknown. but he is one of the most influentual religious figures in history, and his remains are most likely somewhere in the lost city.}
<A>__{suddenly, they are interrupted by a distant sound. a low, rumbling sound. bizarre. unearthly. unlike anything we've heard before. indiana turns to scraggy.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{sound familiar?}
<C>__{scraggy}
<P>__{(shakes his head)}
<D>__{it is far, far away...many miles...}
<C>__{betsy}
<P>__{(frightened)}
<D>__{what is it?... some kinda' weird animal?...}
<C>__{clare}
<D>__{no animal sounds like that.}
<C>__{scraggy}
<D>__{could be "banseebaba".}
<C>__{clare}
<D>__{banseebaba?}
<C>__{scraggy}
<D>__{banseebaba is giant demon from hell. he is 50 feet tall. breathes fire. make sound like human never hear before. he is made up of all evil in the world!}
<C>__{clare}
<D>__{cheery thought.}
<A>__{the sound suddenly stops. everyone exchanges a frightened, terrified glance. indiana stands.}
<C>__{indiana}
<D>__{whatever the hell it is... it went to sleep for the night. which is what we should do.}
