<A>__{a group of carol singers sing "silent night".}
<C>__{carol singers}
<D>__{silent night. holy night. all is calm. all is bright.}
<A>__{della listens for a moment. their voices are clear and bright. behind them she can see the christmas tree vendor bag up the left over trees. della's hands start to pinch with the cold. she gathers her bags of wrapping paper and sets off across the emptying lot. the last of the shoppers rush across the car park to find their cars. it's pretty dark between the dim pole lamps and the car lights. she slows down at the second aisle for a car to pass, then another. marches on. a man and his little girl walk past. he nods. della's eyes linger on the little girl. she really wants to get home to the kids. the singers' voices echo faintly through the night.}
<D>__{carol singers (o.s.) (cont'd) holy infant so tender and mild.}
<A>__{she walks faster, almost at a dash. where is her car? even further out than she remembered, that's for sure. a car alarm goes off in the distance. the alarm stops at last as della approaches the outer section of the parking lot.}
<D>__{carol singers (o.s.) (cont'd) shepherds quake at the sight. glories beam from heaven afar.}
<A>__{she cuts between some of the cars in row eight. zigzags across aisle nine. notices the plymouth still parked ahead. she stops for a split second. then approaches. glances at the windshield. the note is gone. maybe it fell off. she checks the ground around the car. no sign of it. she shrugs, who cares anyway? she cuts across the next aisle. it's almost empty. and the one after that. her explorer is sandwiched between two cars in this otherwise empty row.}
<D>__{carol singers (o.s.) (cont'd) silent night. holy night}
<A>__{she chirps the remote twice and pops the trunk, places the bags inside. she slams the trunk closed and hurries to the drivers' side, climbs in, pulling the door closed behind her.}
