<L>__{interior hallway calvin's condo night}
<A>__{spooner. pounds on the door. it opens. calvin. standing there in her bathrobe. shocked at his appearance.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{detective! what happened to you?...}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{a couple of your beloved robots just tried to kill me...}
<A>__{he pushes past her. into...}
<L>__{interior calvin's condo continuous}
<A>__{...her condo. spartan. unadorned.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{what? that's impossible. you know...}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{what i know is a demolition crew started tearing down hogenmiller's house while i was still inside it.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{maybe they didn't realise...}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{i scanned my badge before i went in. they realised.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{then you must have done it wrong...}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{i don't think you're hearing what i'm saying they tried to kill me.}
<A>__{spooner moves deeper into the apartment. everything. automated. computerised. cold...}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{there's something going on, here. some kind of shift.}
<A>__{calvin laughs. can't believe what she's hearing.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{do you know how paranoid you sound?}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{great. now i'm being analysed by a robo psychologist.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{you just want to find the flaws in the system. you're obsessed with it. you'll twist anything to fit your agenda.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{like you did in court today? how'd that fit your agenda, doctor?}
<A>__{he pulls out the photo of calvin and hogenmiller. calvin. blanching at the sight of it. spooner tosses it down.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{you told me you hardly knew him. want to try the truth this time?}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{well, detective, when you see someone you know well put a bullet through their brain, it makes you wonder if you ever really knew them at all.}
<A>__{calvin. looking down at the photo. swallows.}
<C>__{calvin}
<P>__{(difficult for her)}
<D>__{he was my mentor. no, more than that. a genius with an insight far beyond anyone in his field.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{doesn't sound like the washed up old fool robertson described.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{but he was starting to withdraw from everyone. even me. maybe...if i'd tried harder to reach him...}
<P>__{(shakes her head)}
<D>__{the doctor was reckless when he created a robot potentially not bound by the three laws. he could have ruined everything we'd been working for.}
<A>__{spooner. locking eyes with her.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{sounds like a motive for murder to me. just not for the suspect we have in custody.}
<A>__{calvin. blinks. trying, to stick to her resolve. heads over to the door. spooner. looking around the condo.}
<C>__{spooner}
<D>__{you know there's not one thing in this apartment that looks like a human being lives here. no evidence of a life outside your work. almost seems like you're afraid of people.}
<A>__{calvin. opening the door.}
<C>__{calvin}
<D>__{i'm not afraid of people, detective. i just don't like them.}
<A>__{spooner. looks at her. then heads out the door. calvin slams it behind him... the sound...of the slam...reverberating...and we...}
