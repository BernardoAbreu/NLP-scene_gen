<A>__{jerry woolridge stands up from behind the desk as they enter. he's in his fifiles and looks like a school teacher, shop class or perhaps eighth grade science.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{these are the people from that newspaper deal.}
<C>__{woolridge}
<D>__{oh yeah, from the college?}
<C>__{marsha}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<A>__{woolridge shakes hands with them.}
<C>__{woolridge}
<D>__{my name's jerry woolridge.}
<C>__{marsha}
<D>__{nice to meet you. i'm marsha dwiggins and this is theresa evans. she's here to take the pictures.}
<C>__{woolridge}
<D>__{y'all have a seat. is this all of you?}
<C>__{marsha}
<D>__{yes sir.}
<C>__{woolridge}
<D>__{i think there must have been a little mix up. i told your sponsor or teacher or whatever he is, there couldn't be any pictures. it's s'posed to be just a little story or article or something, isn't that right?}
<C>__{marsha}
<D>__{well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper. but it has pictures. i mean it's a regular paper, you know.}
<C>__{woolridge}
<D>__{karl's real sensitive about having his picture made. he wouldn't even be on the bulletin board for the easter collage.}
<P>__{(to guard)}
<D>__{melvin, would you get me a good hot cup with two sugar substitutes? you girls want some coffee?}
<C>__{marsha}
<D>__{no thank you.}
<C>__{woolridge}
<D>__{the other thing is i told your boss on the phone to send a man. karl won't talk to women.}
