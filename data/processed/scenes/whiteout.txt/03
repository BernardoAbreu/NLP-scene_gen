<A>__{the sounds of lapping surf and distant seagulls serenades us like a rhythmic lullaby. cu on woman's toes digging up soft, white sand. the shadow of a palm tree cascading over top. widen slightly a pair of feminine hands, donning an antique silver ring on the left middle finger, are slowly applying coconut tanning lotion onto firm, athletic calves. deep. soothing. then o.c. knock knock on a door. the hands stop. another knock knock. the lapping surf and seagull sounds come to an abrupt halt.}

<A>__{widen to meet carrie stetko, late 20's. cargo pants rolled up, and an exercise top. she's kicking back, but she's not at the beach. in fact, she's in an office, sitting on a chair. a newly open bag of kitty litter sits next to a plastic tub she's got her feet in. two floor lamps stand like sentinels above her, blasting her with warm wattage. a fake palm tree casts the shadow across her body. she's pulled the earplugs out of her ipod back to the real world. the door opens. leaning into the room is jamie clark (20's), african american. she's dressed in a flannel shirt, jeans. carrie doesn't look entirely happy at the intrusion.}

<D>__{sorry, a professor sapperstein needs to see you in biology. said it's urgent.}
<C>__{carrie}
<D>__{alright }
<A>__{jamie leaves. as carrie gets to her feet, camera moves away from her, panning around the small office. half packed up boxes lay strewn about the floor. a calender hangs crookedly before a desk. each day has been marked off with a large x. three days remain unmarked. last space reads: winter over, and in the space next to it, there's a cut out picture of a tropical beach. a dart board is next to it with a photograph pulverized with dart holes over the bullseye. it's of a candy striped pole topped with a silver ball, surrounded by international flags the south pole. carrie is standing next to the pole, smiling at the camera, arm in arm with sam murphy (30's). looks like he's handsome, but his face is a little more obliterated than the rest of him.}
