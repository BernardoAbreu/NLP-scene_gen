<L>__{interior telyatinki. valentin's room. night.}
<A>__{valentin, in bed, writes in his diary. closing his eyes, he begins to drift off when there is a noise outside his door.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{hello... hello?}
<A>__{after a moment, it opens a crack.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{masha?}
<A>__{she is there. she puts two fingers to her lips and walks toward him. she carries a candle which reveals her short hair, her lovely eyes.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{masha.}
<A>__{she says nothing, simply crawls into bed, positions her knees on either side of him. she leans forward and kisses him.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{masha.}
<C>__{masha}
<D>__{ssshh.}
<A>__{she begins to move against him. their faces touch. she doesn't kiss him, but he can feel her breath. she sits up.}
<C>__{masha}
<D>__{move the book.}
<C>__{valenitn}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{masha}
<D>__{your book.}
<A>__{it's true. valentin still clutches the diary to his chest. he puts it aside. masha, then, pulls her nightdress over head, exposing her small breasts, her flat stomach. she reaches under the sheets, curls her fingers around him. he flinches at the pleasure of it.}
<C>__{masha}
<D>__{is it alright?}
<A>__{he can't speak. only nod. he bites his lip as she slips him into her and begins to rock. the pleasure is too much, and he comes too quickly. she falls forward on him, begins to laugh.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{what...what is it?}
<C>__{masha}
<D>__{you really are a virgin.}
<A>__{valentin tenses a little.}
<C>__{masha}
<D>__{i'm playing. it's fine. it's wonderful...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{hold me.}
<A>__{he does, as if he'll never release her.}
