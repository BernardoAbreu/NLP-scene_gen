<L>__{interior cat's apartment day}
<A>__{cat sits by the living room window. takes the last drop of the drink. as she looks out on the night sky, she lights a cigarette. feeling so alone. she takes one drag on the cigarette, stubs it out. she takes the picture of herself and her parents, looks at it, sighs deeply. a tear forms. her loneliness, her sense of isolation grows. for the first time, she seems a bit lost.}
