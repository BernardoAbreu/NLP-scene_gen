<L>__{interior farm day}
<A>__{ronald the priest still kneels by the inert knight in armor. the boy squire still sits by his father's head. ronald mumbles quietly to himself in prayer. the knight is deathly still, no sight or sound of breathing or moaning. the suit of armor seems to grow even more rigid as we look at it. there is no sense of it containing life. the officer re enters the room from outside.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{how is he?}
<C>__{priest}
<D>__{sleeping now... at peace, for the moment.}
<C>__{officer}
<D>__{leave him for a while. there are a few souls out here you can help on their way to heaven. ten sous a soul to you... come on.}
<A>__{the officer leaves. ronald quickly follows him outside.}
<C>__{ronald}
<D>__{twenty sous is normal. how many are there?}
<A>__{when they have gone the squire gives his father a nudge, but there is no response from the knight, just the impression of lifeless bulk.}
