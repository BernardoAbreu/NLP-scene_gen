<A>__{the radiomen move cautiously toward the flame, shielding their faces with one hand, holding their guns with the other. is it possible that indy and henry escaped through these flames? not a chance. they've hidden themselves up the chimney. and now they drop down, behind the radiomen. one of the radiomen grabs indy by the neck. as they struggle they fall against the rotating wall and disappear into the next room, leaving a frightened henry behind. henry presses against the wall, which rotates again. as he disappears into the next room, a dead nazi radioman swivels into the room. the other nazis rush forward to him.}
