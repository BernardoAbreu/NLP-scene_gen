<L>__{exterior jungle somewhere in vietnam day}
<A>__{the sun matches the intensity of the previous shot as we move down into thick green jungle. we hear the sound of men coming, a lot of men. the thwack of a machete. brush being bulled. we wait. they are getting close. the credits continue to run. subtitle reads: december 1967 bravo company, 25th infantry division somewhere near the cambodian border. a sweating white face comes into view. chris cutting pointerior machete in one hand, whacking out a path for the platoon, m 16 in the other, he looks like he's on the verge of heat exhaustion. breathing too hard, pacing himself all wrong, bumping into things, tripping, not quite falling, he looks pathetic here in the naturalness of the jungle. an urban transplant, slightly neurotic and getting more so. his rucksack is coming apart as well, about 70 badly packed pounds banging noisily. behind him barnes now comes, the platoon sergeant. then the rto, his radio man, humming lightly. others are behind, the column snaking back deep into the brush. we cut around some faces of the platoon all to be seen later. young faces, hard and dirty after weeks in the field, exhausted yet alert, fatigues filthy, slept in, torn, personalized, hair way past regulation length, medals, bandanas. a jungle army. boys. chris glancing down at his raw bleeding blisters. transfers the machete to his other, slightly less blistered, hand. the kid cuts on struggling but trying, on his last reserves of strength, smashing almost straight forward through brush, not even bothering to look ahead. he smells something, looks around, slows his pace, eyes working ... around to the base of a tree. he moves past it. and as he does so, the camera from his pov comes around on a dead decomposing 10 day old gook eyes starting from its sockets, worms and flies feasting. chris draws his breath in, terrified. barnes suddenly appears alongside, his hard humourless eyes looking annoyed from the gook to chris.}
