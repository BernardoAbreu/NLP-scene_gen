<L>__{interior apartment day}
<A>__{matt and the marshal in the foreground as beth talks to jeannie in the background. we see only glimpses of them. beth's face as she leans towards jeannie from one side of the doorway just jeannie's legs dangling on the other side.}
<C>__{beth's voice}
<D>__{okay, listen carefully, jeannie. be still. now, what's the most important thing in life to know?}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{no one will ever love me as much as you do.}
<A>__{matt and the marshal exchange a look of mutual horror.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{good. now, concentrate with all your muscles and remember everything i'm about to say to you...}
<A>__{the marshal and matt shift uncomfortably.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{don't talk to strangers. they may be killers. take your vitamins so the poison in the food can't hurt you. what else now?}
<C>__{jeannie's voice}
<D>__{teeth.}
<C>__{beth's voice}
<D>__{right. thank you. brush right after you eat or your gums will start to bleed in your sleep and choke you.}
<A>__{the marshal and matt can stand no more they each call to her... "beth... beth... mrs. hobbs... beth." she looks out and then walks to them.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{what? i'm giving jeannie her reminders.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{reminders?!? you can't say things like that to a little...}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{no. don't. no. don't dare. don't criticize the way i mother or i think i will start to scream and never st...}
<C>__{marshal}
<D>__{mrs. hobbs.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(suddenly cheery)}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{marshal}
<D>__{you know, i've been involved with this sort of thing for a long time.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{you're not going to criticize me, are you? not in front of him because all he's done is send jeannie these long, stupid letters. he doesn't even realize she can't read. he sends letters to someone who can't read.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{it's almost funny.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{i thought you'd read them to her.}
<C>__{beth}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{marshal}
<D>__{i'm not faulting you. you love your daughter and this is a very tough thing to go through. you feel guilty and caring and it all gets mixed up so that there's so much important stuff going down that there's no sure way of dealing with it, but the best thing you can do is just make sure you love her.}
<C>__{beth}
<D>__{typical cop talk.}
<P>__{(on his look)}
<D>__{but i understand what you're trying to say. thank you. can i have another minute with her?}
<A>__{she returns to the doorway which still only provides us with glimpses as she sings, "don't talk to strangers." the camera moves down the hallway to introduce jeannie, trying to puzzle things out as she sits amongst a ridiculous number of suitcases.}
