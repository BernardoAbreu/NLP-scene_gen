<L>__{exterior rock shelter night}
<A>__{hector spends a long, cold night alone, squatting in a narrow crevice in the rocks. he doesn't sleep, or even attempt to close his eyes. he stares into the darkness. there is nothing in the world to comfort him, no phi losophy or religion, no friend to run to. this night he is utterly alone.}
<L>__{exterior rocks morning}
<A>__{in the morning it is lightly raining. hector stands in the drizzle outside the shelter. it seems to revive him, refresh him, even comfort him. a sign, however meager, that life goes on. then hector trots off in the direc tion of the shore. there is not much else that he can do.}
