<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior amity beach day}
<A>__{the familiar striped cabanas flank the white sands; there's a crowd of midweek seasonal tourists and locals oblivious to the tall steel tower that dominates the beach. a classy van outfitted for passengers pulls into the parking area, followed by vaughn's cadillac; the parking attendant waves them into a preferential area, where they disembark: vaughn, peterson, ellen, and some more prospects, including a woman named bryant and her daughter, renee.}
<C>__{peterson}
<D>__{this is the town beach; the development naturally has its own private access, but i wanted you to see the concession area. look at that sand like sugar!}
<A>__{he scoops up a handful of the fine powder. ellen directs the attention of the photographers.}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{during the summer, the sun sets right there...}
<P>__{(she points)}
<D>__{over the water. beautiful.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<P>__{(to ellen)}
<D>__{i will say hello for you.}
<A>__{ellen nods, preoccupied. vaughn strolls away, headed in the direction of the cabanas. mary nichols, a local selectwoman, emerges from behind the counter of one of the concessions.}
<C>__{nichols}
<D>__{hello selling some more of the good life?}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{a piece here, a piece there, it all adds up.}
<C>__{nichols}
<D>__{your husband's been here all morning. what's he doing?}
<C>__{ellen}
<P>__{(good naturedly)}
<D>__{his job.}
<A>__{michael brody, dressed in township workman's coveralls, is repainting some flaking woodwork. sean is happily mixing painterior vaughn joins them.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{your dad got you working?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{he continues his chore, without enthusiasm.}
<C>__{sean}
<D>__{i'm helping.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{you know where your dad is?}
<C>__{mike}
<D>__{up there.}
<A>__{he points at the tower.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{oh, for christ's sake.}
<A>__{he crosses briskly to where peterson is finishing.}
<C>__{peterson}
<D>__{and if you have any questions about recreational possibilities, ellen brody here will be happy to answer them.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{len, can i see you a minute?}
<A>__{peterson excuses himself and joins the mayor.}
<C>__{peterson}
<D>__{i think we got a couple of live ones.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{brody's riding his tower.}
<C>__{peterson}
<P>__{(looking up)}
<D>__{oh, shit.}
<B>__{brody in the tower}
<A>__{sweeping the water with binoculars, restless eyes trying to scan everything, a grim watchman high over the heads of the unseeing crowd.}
<B>__{on the water}
<A>__{larry vaughn, jr. comes skimming in close to the surf. bob is handling the sheets, larry is giving young jackie sailing lessons at the moment he's showing her how the tiller works. he's on her like glue.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{this is fun! can we go faster?}
<C>__{larry}
<P>__{(to bob)}
<D>__{trim.}
<A>__{bob does, larry trims the main, and the hull lifts.}
<C>__{jackie}
<D>__{yay!}
<A>__{she snuggles in larry's arms. he waves to someone.}
<C>__{larry}
<D>__{that's my dad!}
<A>__{jackie waves without seeing.}
<B>__{on the beach}
<A>__{vaughn waves back, preoccupied. near him, mike brody looks up, his face grim, jealous, and now a little nuts. he splashes paint onto the wood with angry abandon.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<P>__{(to peterson)}
<D>__{wave to my son.}
<C>__{peterson}
<P>__{(waving)}
<D>__{how the hell do we get him down from there?}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{maybe nobody will notice. let's get them back in the bus.}
<A>__{mrs. bryant approaches them, tugging her daughter.}
<C>__{mrs. bryant}
<D>__{renee wants to know what that man is doing way up there?}
<C>__{peterson}
<D>__{he's, ah, watching. a lookout.}
<C>__{mrs. bryant}
<D>__{for what?}
<C>__{renee}
<P>__{(a precocious little girl)}
<D>__{it's a shark tower. i saw one in florida. he's looking for sharks.}
<C>__{vaughn}
<D>__{it's an observation platform. that's our chief of police. he's just checking it.}
<C>__{peterson}
<D>__{normally, it's used for, ah, bird watching. nature observation. weather measurements, that sort of thing.}
<P>__{(a little desperate)}
<D>__{ellen, we're running late!}
<C>__{ellen}
<D>__{okay. folks, if we could get back on, we'll show you the country club, and stop for lunch...}
<A>__{at the mention of lunch, the prospects, all hungry, begin flocking back into the van. peterson herds them along.}
<C>__{peterson}
<D>__{the country club has an 18 hole course, putting greens, and twelve tennis courts...}
