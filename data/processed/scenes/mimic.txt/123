<T>__{cut to:}
<A>__{subway car later leaning against the dirtied window, manny creates a streak for every mimic he sees. peter, leonard and susan are hard at work. leonard has created a small "model" of the station using pocket debris and the wall map.}
<C>__{leonard }
<D>__{okay. that's us.}
<A>__{manny's lighter represents the subway car.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{this track we're on? goes down into the repair area.}
<P>__{(makes an "x" further down)}
<D>__{the elevator's over here. leads up to the active tunnels.}
<A>__{thump! an oily, soft abdomen brushes lazily up against the glass. manny moves away.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{can we get this car there?}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{someone'd have to go to the switchroom, pull the coupling lever, that'll send us left and to the elevator.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{but the power...}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{hell, i might be able to juice the whole area, if i can get to the power box. it's just a couple of cables...}
<C>__{manny}
<D>__{oh, how you gonna get there, leonard? hop?}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(to leonard)}
<D>__{just talk me through it. i can go with manny.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{it would take a minute or so.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you won't last that long out there.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{peter, you couldn't even fix our tv!}
<A>__{tense silence. he points at the glands on the floor.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{we'll cover ourselves with this. they can mimic us we goddam mimic them!}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{peter }
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{it worked before...}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(an edge in her voice)}
<D>__{the scent won't last...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{that's why we should do it now.}
<A>__{susan knows they have no other choice.}
<B>__{later}
<A>__{susan is stuffing leonard's old bloody bandages into the thorax of the dead mimic. she ties a flare to its center.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{it's just a regular old pump switch, okay? right by the track signal board.}
<A>__{manny is spreading the mucus like liquid of the gland sac on himself and peter as leonard instructs them }
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{the lights come up, you pull the switch.}
<C>__{manny}
<D>__{i pull.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{you don't do that, we're on the wrong track.}
<P>__{(turns to peter)}
<D>__{you...}
<A>__{the two men look into each other's eyes.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{you gonna finally get to fuck around with the wires. think you can handle it?}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{depends. you got a memo?}
<A>__{leonard's hard feelings give way to an almost imperceptible smile. using a ballpoint pen, he draws a schematic on the back of peter's hand.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{all right then. you gonna find two wires. one's green. the other's blue...}
<B>__{susan}
<A>__{approaches manny, who looks distractedly out the window.}
<C>__{manny}
<D>__{he's out there. i heard him. how can he be? this things...}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{manny...}
<C>__{manny}
<D>__{i didn't protect him, lady. he trusted me. and i didn't protect him... his father...i lost his father to the streets and now, chuy...}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{we'll find him. we'll be back and find him.}
<A>__{manny doesn't respond.}
<B>__{ready to go}
<A>__{susan dabs at peter's face with the last touches of the scent gland substance. she doesn't meet his eyes as she speaks.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{you're going to have to keep it really slow. their eyes react to sudden movements.}
<A>__{peter barely nods, his nerves clearly on edge. he instinctively goes to wipe his forehead. susan stops him.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{don't touch it. and for godsakes, try not to sweat. they can sense chemical changes...}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{try not to sweat?}
<A>__{leonard turns to susan and peter.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{okay, people...}
<A>__{leonard's voice comes through like a clarion.}
<C>__{leonard }
<D>__{...are we ready for this?}
<A>__{susan has her hand on peter's chest; peter is taking deep breaths, trying to cool down his body to prevent sweat. it's an odd parody of lamaze exercise.}
<C>__{leonard}
<D>__{whatever you do, don't step on the third rail coming back. six hundred volts'll blow your leg right off.}
<A>__{a final breath. he's about as calm as he's going to get. he looks at susan a long moment. he takes her hand.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{i was just thinking how i could use a pair of pliers... and i remembered where they are...}
<C>__{susan}
<P>__{(overlapping)}
<D>__{that's it. that's it. breathe easy.}
<A>__{a sad, nervous smile appears on peter's face.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{in the tool box under the kitchen counter...}
<A>__{susan kisses him softly on the lips. manny approaches. show time. susan steps away from peter. she looks toward the control booth.}
<C>__{susan}
<D>__{open it.}
<B>__{leonard}
<A>__{begins turning the lever crank slowly.}
<B>__{subway doors}
<A>__{gradually begin to open, and stop half way. the darkness outside is alive with clicking.}
<B>__{peter and manny}
<A>__{slowly move between the opening of the door and make their way to}
