<L>__{interior paul's living room day}
<A>__{jacob's old army buddies are sitting together in paul's living room, talking. paul's wife can be seen in the bedroom. several women are comforting her. jezzie is talking to a small group of ladies in the dining room and nibbling off a tray of cold cuts. paul's sister is with her and they seem to be having a lively, almost intimate, conversation. jacob and his buddies are drinking beer. they all have a tired, defeated look about them.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{did anyone see the police report? it sounds like a detonation job to me.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{the paper said it was electrical; a freak accident.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{bullshit. someone's covering somethin'. that was no accident.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{why do you say that?}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{cars don't explode that way. any simpleton knows that.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{but the paper ...}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{that was set. i'm tellin' you.}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{by who? why? paul didn't have an enemy in the world.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{doug}
<D>__{hey, you're talkin' about paul. who'd want to hurt him?}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what did he talk about when you guys went out? did he say anything?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{he was upset. he thought people were following him.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{you're kidding. who?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{he didn't know ... demons.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(obviously struck by the word)}
<D>__{what do you mean, demons?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{he told me he was going to hell.}
<A>__{the statement has a surprising impact on the group. there is immediate silence and eyes averted from one another.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{what'd he say that for? what made him say that? strange, huh? strange.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what else did he say, jake?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{he was scared. he saw these creatures coming out of the woodwork. they were tryin' to get him, he said.}
<C>__{george}
<P>__{(his arm shaking)}
<D>__{how long had that been going on?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{a couple of weeks, i think.}
<A>__{he notices george's beer can rattling.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{he say what they looked like?}
<C>__{jacob}
<D>__{no. not really ...}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{excuse me a minute. i will be right back.}
<C>__{rod}
<D>__{in one end, out the other, huh george?}
<A>__{george tries to smile as he hurries to the bathroom. his arm is nearly out of control and beer is spilling on the carpet as he walks.}
<C>__{rod}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{still a spastic, huh? i hope you can hold your dick better than you hold that can.}
<A>__{no one laughs. there is an uncomfortable silence.}
