<C>__{tin cup}
<D>__{romeo... are you sweet on doreen?}

<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{actually if you open the club face a hair and play it off your back foot }

<D>__{i'm ready to charge forth in pursuit of my mythic destiny and i can't get time off work to do it.}
<C>__{romeo}
<D>__{i'm no expert, but it seems to me that the `pursuit of a person's mythic destiny' is not the sort of thing that a person needs to get off a five dollar an hour job in order to do...}
