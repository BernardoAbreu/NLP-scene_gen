<A>__{widen from a tv screen which shown the above moment. as the group session continues under, camera pans to reveal berrisford and alan watching the tape.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{gilda hasn't said three words in three weeks. and now, cynthia comes in with this love, peace and woodstock routine and... presto. am i missing something, or what?}
<C>__{berrisford}
<D>__{she's espousing a total belief system. a kind of holistic healing matrix not unlike the dynamic energy shift model. isn't that interesting? they're adopting it, embracing it.}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{too bad we can't follow through on this.}
<C>__{berrisford}
<D>__{why not?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{dr. berrisford, the people in this group... some of them are deeply disturbed. cynthia doesn't belong with them an experiment for one session, fine, but in the long run }
<C>__{berrisford}
<D>__{alan. we've opened primary channels of communication. you've opened them, alan. let's not rush to throw away our progress. neuroses are hardly contagious. a few weeks in the group won't hurt cynthia. with luck, she'll overcome her memory trauma. that would mean progress... not to mention getting lieutenant wasserman off my back. in the meantime...}
<A>__{he stands, puts his hand on the younger man's shoulder.}
<C>__{berrisford }
<D>__{she seems to like you. see if you can get her to open up, and let's press on.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{with a united front?}
<C>__{alan}
<D>__{a united front. sure.}
<A>__{satisfied, berrisford smiles, goes out the door. alan sighs, and looks at cynthia's image on the screen.}
