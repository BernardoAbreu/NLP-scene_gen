<L>__{exterior sky deep dusk to night}
<A>__{the rim of the planet overtakes both suns. the world goes dark.}
<L>__{interior cargo hold night}
<A>__{vault like doors boom closed. the survivors are locked inside the only secure part of the ship. somehow they've been reduced to neanderthals huddling in their cave, listening to the howls of the sabertooths.}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{what if...what if she's still out there... still alive....}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{well, i don't want to jump to conclusions here...but 'member that boneyard? these just might be the fuckers that killed every other living thing on this planet, okay? chances of shazza knockin' on that door anytime soon are just about zero squared.}
<C>__{fry}
<P>__{(agreeing)}
<D>__{i saw the cut marks on the bones. wasn't a natural die off.}
<C>__{imam}
<D>__{quiet, please. everyone.}
<A>__{imam is listening at the cargo door. the others pile up alongside, ears tuned like radar. clicking sweeps past outside.}
<C>__{audrey}
<P>__{(whispering)}
<D>__{why do they do that? make that sound?}
<C>__{imam}
<D>__{perhaps the way they see. with sound, reflecting back.}
<C>__{fry}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{echo location. that's what it is....}
<A>__{now more clicking behind them. lights whip around to find... nothing. only the door of an open container about halfway down the tunnel like hold. a volley of looks. "how the fuck could one get in here?"}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{breach in the hull. i dunno.}
<A>__{more clicking. johns realizes they expect him to check it out.}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{i'd rather piss glass.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{well, you got the big gauge.}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{wanna rag your fat mouth?}
<C>__{audrey}
<D>__{maybe it's just their beads again. imam, are you still }
<C>__{imam}
<D>__{no, no, no, i do not believe }
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{c'mon, man, you're drivin' everybody bugfuck with those things. why don't you just lose the goddamn....}
<A>__{more clicking along with the sound of toppling cargo.}
<C>__{riddick}
<D>__{big beads.}
<A>__{butching up, johns sucks on his breather and shimmies toward... the open container. leading with his shotgun, he fires blindly around the door. something squeals then silence. johns eases his head and a light around the door to spot... hatchlings on the ground, blasted into dog food.}
<C>__{johns}
<P>__{(to others)}
<D>__{okay. we're okay. just some small ones that musta something whooshes for his head , swinging like a scythe. it}
<A>__{catches his shotgun, discharging it, giving us... a flash image of an adult predator. up close. in one thin second, johns is back with the others.}
<C>__{johns}
<D>__{very big beads.}
<C>__{paris}
<D>__{not staying in here another....}
<A>__{he goes for the main door lever, ready to flee into the night. fry lunges for him.}
<C>__{fry}
<D>__{christ, you don't know what's out there!}
<C>__{paris}
<D>__{i know what's in here!}
<C>__{imam}
<D>__{everybody come, this way and we should be safe. hurry, please....}
