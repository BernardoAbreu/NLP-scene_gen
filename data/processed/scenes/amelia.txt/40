<L>__{interior auditorium, barnard college, new york night}
<A>__{a women's college. the hall is packed.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{the lecture and publicity schedule was fierce. i was with her pretty much all the time.}
<A>__{amelia and george alone in the wings.}
<D>__{george (v.o.) (cont’d) this was the moment of opportunity. could we launch her into lindbergh status as a permanent icon, before her name fell out of the news papers.}
<A>__{he re ties her scarf. checking out the effect.}
<D>__{george (v.o.) (cont’d) we had separate agendas. for her, it was the advancement of aviation and of women.}
<A>__{he very slightly rearranges her hair, as if every lock matters.}
<D>__{george (v.o.) (cont’d) as for me, i liked to tell myself it was about the money. though there was never much of that left over.}
<A>__{she stands for inspection, with her trace of a teasing smile. he holds out his hand and she gives him her note cards.}
<D>__{george (v.o.) (cont’d) really, it was about the chance to be around her.}
<A>__{he flips through the cards, frowning as he goes.}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{this will never do, a.e., simply unacceptable.}
<A>__{he looks up. she starts pacing around, gesturing as he would...}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{you need more ammunition in these cards, and where's the goddamned humor, for chrissake? by which i mean something actually funny!}
<A>__{he's trying to look annoyed. it isn't easy.}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{and please remember not to turn your pretty little backside to the crowd when you use your pointer, it's your face they're paying to see. well, most of them.}
<A>__{she whips around. he's deadpan.}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{and another thing. your hats. are a menace.}
<A>__{staring at each other.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{everything about you. is a menace.}
<A>__{the stare holds. because this is the moment.}
<C>__{amelia }
<D>__{i remember the first kiss.}
<A>__{it is only one step. her hand goes to his chest. her eyes close, as... she brings her mouth to his. tender and strong. and deep. it is an act of decision. a held look. no one smiles. we hear her name announced from the podium. but she keeps looking at him. and as the applause continues, she finally... ...turns. strides onto the stage, with one graceful wave, she brings the applause to a crescendo.}
<D>__{amelia (v.o.) (cont’d) of course, i knew all the stories that dorothy had been having a torrid affair with fred upton. everyone did.}
<A>__{she steps to the microphone. the crowd quiets.}
<D>__{amelia (v.o.) (cont’d) but i didn't kiss him because i felt sorry for him. or because it would mean the world to him.}
