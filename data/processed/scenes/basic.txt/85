<L>__{interior cabin last night}
<A>__{pike sighs, finished with his story.}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{i... i don't know...}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{what don't you know?}
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{this is a lot of information to be getting... i have to think }
<A>__{the hurricane outside growing louder as the cabin rocks again. the sound of wood snapping. pike stares up at the roof.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{there's no time to think, ray, we gotta get out of here! you untie me, we grab the guns, get kendall and nunez, and make a run for it }
<C>__{dunbar}
<D>__{no... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the m.p.'s }
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{we wait and i'm a dead man. i got a black face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much i hated west my court martial will take six minutes. it's either me or them, ray, and you gotta decide right now.}
<A>__{the cabin shifts again. dunbar stares at him.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{untie me.}
<A>__{dunbar doesn't move.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{untie me, ray.}
<A>__{a long beat. the two men stare at each other. and then dunbar pulls his knife from his boot and leans down to cut pike's bonds.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{thank god. . .}
<C>__{mueller }
<D>__{what the fuck are you doing?}
<A>__{dunbar freezes. caught. he looks to the open kitchen door where mueller stands.}
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{guys, get out here!}
<A>__{the others enter the room. dunbar, kneeling there, knife inches away from severing pike's ropes.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{this place is going, mueller. we gotta move }
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{shut the fuck up.}
<P>__{(to the others)}
<D>__{he was gonna cut him loose.}
<A>__{the others stare at dunbar.}
<C>__{nunez}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{cause i didn't do it.}
<A>__{childs motions to dunbar.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{get away from there.}
<A>__{he's serious. dunbar moves away from pike.}
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{we all know what you did, pike. i don't know what kind of nigger voodoo you been working in here, but }
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{where's your shirt, mueller?}
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{used it to start the fire }
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{still got mine on, not a speck of blood on it. not a bad trick for a murderer you said you burned yours?}
<A>__{the others begin to look at mueller with new eyes.}
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{was freezing from the hurricane }
<C>__{kendall}
<D>__{so you took off your shirt?}
<C>__{mueller}

<A>__{the hurricane, reaching fever pitch outside as water begins leaking in through the roof.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{goddammit, ray, we gotta get out of here }
<C>__{mueller}
<D>__{we're not going anywhere.}
