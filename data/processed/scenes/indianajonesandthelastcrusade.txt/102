<A>__{the car races toward a tunnel that cuts through a steep mountainside. the messerschmidt bears down on indy's car, machine guns chattering. the car enters the tunnel. the messerschmidt cannot pull up in time. it slams into the mouth of the tunnel, shearing off its wings.}
<L>__{interior the tunnel day}
<A>__{the flaming fuselage continues to rocket through the tunnel like a bullet down the muzzle of a gun. sparks fly as its belly scrapes against the pavement and the sides of the tunnel.}
