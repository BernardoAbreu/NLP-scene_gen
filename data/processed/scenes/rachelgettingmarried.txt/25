<L>__{into interior ukrainian museum dining hall. night.}
<A>__{the dinner the forty odd guests are now seated in an adjoining room at long tables laden with a gorgeous indian feast. yellow rice, red curry, vivid green and orange vegetable dishes, pink shrimp. huge plates of dosa and brinjal. candles flicker in lanterns shaped like lotuses. photogenically stylish young servers dressed elegantly in black and white hover around the family and friends as everybody makes total pigs of themselves. the indian feast contrasts agreeably with the ukrainian visuals. evocative bollywood music provides the soundtrack. kym, wandering on along the table like a nomad, wedges herself between sidney and rachel. emma grabs an empty wine glass before kym knocks it over.}
<C>__{kym}
<D>__{i don't know anybody at what's obviously the loser end of the table. can i have your chana masala?}

<A>__{the girls clamber up. kym brushes curry off rachel's shirt. abby, the girl's mom, and andrew, her husband, enter the dining room. abby is a beautiful, wise woman in her fifties. elegant, ladylike and graceful. andrew looks foxy in his abby selected armani, but he has the shoulders and knuckles of a heavyweight. as the girls approach, abby acknowledges paul across the room but makes no move to go beyond an exchange of long distance little waves and tight smiles.}
<C>__{abby}
<P>__{(to rachel, embracing)}
<D>__{hello, darling.}
<A>__{a big hug. she turns to kym.}
<C>__{abby}
