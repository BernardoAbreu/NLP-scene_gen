<L>__{interior matt's apt. night}
<A>__{jeannie, truly stung by the hang up. she takes this act of cathy's as an insult to herself and her father. matt doesn't feel too wonderful about it himself.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{you have to understand that sometimes people are too busy.}
<C>__{jeannie}
<D>__{so she's too busy for you?}
<L>__{interior restaurant night}
<A>__{burke and nan eating together on an elevated balcony overlooking the main eating area.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{we look like jerks eating here this early. everybody's going to think we couldn't get a reservation for the hot hours.}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{why do you do this to yourself? why do you insist on eating dinner in a restaurant where you're bound to see all the people you're afraid of?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{i'm not afraid of them.}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{what do you call it when you think that what a group of people think of you can confirm or destroy any decent idea you have of yourself?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{normal.}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{how did little jeannie do today?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{isn't it something that they have you testing the tv show?}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{what i asked was, how did jeannie do?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{somebody else. jeannie. how did she do?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{don't talk to me like this.}
<C>__{nan}
<P>__{(really pissed)}
<D>__{i want to be treated as if i'm really saying words to you which you engage and respond to. i like matt; i'd like to know how his daughter did. so before you take your dance of desperation across the restaurant and i end up feeling so sorry for you that i could die, i would like you to answer my question.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{she did okay... and don't worry about matt... if the pilot sells, his kid will be making five thousand a week. so what do you know about 'people get hurt?'}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{i'm told that they're not going to release it...}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{i knew. i knew. what the hell are you smiling for?}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{forgive me. but telling you about this latest failure of yours it pleases me. i have no idea why.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{i can't be with someone who's not rooting for me.}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{i think i am. it's just that rooting for you is a good deal more complicated than you realize.}
<P>__{(as he rises)}
<D>__{don't go.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{don't worry. i'm not that mad. i gotta do this.}
<A>__{music in as burke leaves the table. this "dance of desperation" is classical. burke himself lifting one of the women in greeting, then, as he puts her down.}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{sorry. i thought you were someone else.}
<A>__{as he continues to go from table to table.}
<B>__{tight on nan}
<A>__{as she looks down on him, dying for him, we hear her sing the song "poor bastards". finally, not only about burke but the other damaged souls he seeks to dance with. now, nan can take no more. she exits. full shot burke as he sees her go past in the background, he goes after her, finally grabbing her near the maitre d' station. this, just as two important couples arrive. burke frantically tries to cover.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{nan, you know victor and his wife...}
<P>__{(he mumbles, unable}
<D>__{to remember any wife's}
<P>__{name)}
<D>__{and jay and his wife...}
<P>__{(he mumbles)}
<C>__{nan}
<D>__{yes. i'm sorry i can't talk now. i'm very upset about what's happening to burke, so i just made up my mind i can't be witness to it anymore if i love him and i certainly shouldn't be here if i don't... so i was just in the process of leaving when he stopped me and you folks walked in... i'm sure you've had something like this happen to you some time... some horrible thing in your personal life happening in public.}
<A>__{they all nod and ad lib agreements with her premise to burke's amazement.}
<C>__{nan}
<P>__{(again)}
<D>__{thank you for understanding.}
<P>__{(to burke)}
<D>__{goodbye. i wish only good things for you even though i feel i've been really damaged by this relationship.}
<A>__{she exits, enormously upset. burke, torn between following her and repairing the social damage. but the couples are paying him no mind; rather they are impressed with nan. as they comment, i.e.}
<C>__{couples}
<D>__{wasn't that spectacular? i've never seen anybody that secure...}
<A>__{burke accepts the compliments as if meant for him.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{thank you. thank you. we're very close.}
