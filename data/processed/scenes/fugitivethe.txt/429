<B>__{kimble}
<A>__{moves instinctively back into the machinery and carts near the conveyor belts.}
<C>__{gerard }
<D>__{kimble... i know about nichols. i know about sykes. kimble stops.}
<B>__{on gerard}
<C>__{gerard}
<D>__{... nichols borrowed your car the night of the murder and called sykes from it.}
<B>__{renfro}
<A>__{separated from gerard. he hears a noise behind him a bag comes down the track at break neck speed, renfro spins, dodges it, gets his bearings and continues.}
<B>__{kimble}
<A>__{listening. he watches the movement of bags as he did with nichols.}
<B>__{gerard}
<A>__{moving through the forest of massive bags.}
<C>__{gerard}
<D>__{... that's why there was no forced entry at your house. he'd used your keys.}
<B>__{kimble}
<A>__{realizing what gerard knows. considering his next move.}
<B>__{nichols}
<A>__{also listening. he realizes gerard now knows he's the killer. he moves behind the water softener tanks and chemicals and spots renfro and something else the hanging control for the i beam.}
<B>__{gerard}
<A>__{moves carefully. another bag comes down the track. he dodges it and steps into an open track. from here he can see straight back toward the washers.}
<C>__{gerard}
<D>__{kimble... come meet me out here.}
<B>__{on renfro}
<A>__{he steps out and then back as a bag shoots by. he ducks under the bag into the next track and suddenly hears a whirring sound behind him. renfro turns as an i beam comes rushing down the open track and knocks him to the floor, opening a gash across the side of his head. he lays still.}
<B>__{nichols}
<A>__{steps out of the shadows, turns him over exposing his empty shoulder harness and takes the gun from renfro's hand. nichols moves toward gerard with the gun.}
<B>__{gerard}
<A>__{oblivious to this action, moves on, passes the conveyor belts. he makes one last appeal.}
<C>__{gerard}
<D>__{it's time to quit running... if you don't, you know i will stop you. he listens, there is no answer.}
<B>__{kimble}
<A>__{starts to move out to meet gerard, sees renfro down. his shoulder harness is empty. he knows nichols is armed.}
<B>__{gerard}
<A>__{moves into the alley between the two giant washers. he pauses, looks back, then continues, when he turns his back on us...}
<B>__{nichols}
<A>__{steps into frame behind him and slowly takes aim. just before he fires however he hears...}
<C>__{kimble }
<D>__{hey, chuckles...}
<A>__{nichols turns toward the voice as kimble swings the stick and clocks him sending the gun skittering on the floor behind gerard.}
<B>__{gerard}
<A>__{turns on the sound and finds his gun trained on kimble with nichols at his feet, unconscious. he realizes instantly that kimble saved his life and lowers his gun. kimble, exhausted, leans against the washer. they hold a look as deputies and police flood into the room surrounding kimble and handcuffing him.}
