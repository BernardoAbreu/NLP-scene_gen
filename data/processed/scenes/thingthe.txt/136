<A>__{the men have gathered to discuss plans. furtive and untrustworthy glances are passed around the room.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{...from what we know this thing likes to go one on one. so we stick together as much as possible. in two's and three's.}
<A>__{childs points to garry, dr. copper and clark.}
<C>__{childs}
<D>__{what do we do about those three?}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{we got morphine, don't we.}
<A>__{fuchs nods.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{well, we keep them loaded. stash them here in the rec room and watch 'em twenty four hours.}
<C>__{palmer}
<P>__{(ears perk up)}
<D>__{morphine? you know i was pretty close to that dog, too.}
<A>__{palmer is ignored.}
<C>__{norris}
<D>__{we should sleep in shifts.}

<D>__{you can eighty six that thought right now, man.}
<A>__{dr. copper eyes his accuser solemnly.}
<C>__{macready}
<D>__{also... when this thing turns... it turns slowly at first. i think we can handle it in that state. but if it ever got to full power... from what i saw of that norwegian camp... well, i just don't know... it would probably take it an hour or more to get like that. so no matter what anybody's doing, we all return to this room every twenty minutes. anybody gone longer than that... anybody trying to leave... we kill 'em.}
