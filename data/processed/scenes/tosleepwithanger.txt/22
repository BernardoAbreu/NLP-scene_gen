<L>__{interior babe brother's house day}
<A>__{babe brother, having showered but still wearing his pajamas, drags himself to the kitchen table where his wife linda has a huge coffee mug with the inscription, "i'm the boss", waiting for him. linda is about thirty years old and materially oriented like her husband. she is wearing a conservatively cut business dress. sunny stops playing with his car and gets himself an empty cup. babe brother is about to pour him some of his coffee when linda objects.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{sunny pleads with her in silence but linda refuses to yield.}
<C>__{babe brother}
<D>__{he wouldn't want any if you didn't try to keep it away from him.}
<A>__{linda leaves the table but stops for a moment and looks down at her husband.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{because you were spoiled, don't try to spoil sunny.}
<C>__{babe brother}
<D>__{my daddy never gave me anything without my having to sweat for it. every summer, the way they kept me and junior out of trouble was to send us to big daddy's farm. we would get up with the chickens. every summer the fence had to be repaired. the barn needed a coat of painterior we had to pip all of big mama's hundred laying hens and go to church all day on sunday. for big daddy, calluses and sweat were the mark of a man. sunny will never have to bust his knuckles like we did.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{i want sunny to have an advantage that you and i never had, but he needs discipline, and you are not helping when i tell him to do something and you allow him to get out of it.}
<C>__{babe brother}
<D>__{what is a sip of coffee going to do?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{coffee is bad for anybody, especially for a child.}
<C>__{babe brother}
<D>__{i don't see you crying about my drinking it.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{how old are you?}
