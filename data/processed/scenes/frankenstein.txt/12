<A>__{a massive bolt of lightning hammers from the sky, reducing a centuries old oak tree to smoldering ruin...}
<L>__{int downstairs parlor night}
<A>__{...while victor gazes at the storm, face pressed against a window, astonished at the sight. lightning throws seething shadows of the rain on his face.}
<C>__{mother}
<D>__{victor. elizabeth is frightened by the storm. go comfort her.}
<L>__{int upper landing night}
<A>__{we hear a child sobbing. victor comes racing up the grand staircase from below as lightning sends wild banister shadows skittering. he caroms down the hall toward:}
<L>__{int elizabeth's room night}
<A>__{victor enters. elizabeth is a tiny figure huddled in an adult size bed, gazing up with tear streaked face at the huge skylights in the vaulted ceiling, dreading the next scary boom and flash. victor approaches and whispers:}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{don't cry, elizabeth.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<P>__{(frightened)}
<D>__{aren't you?}
<A>__{ka boom! a lightning bolt rips overhead, rattling the panes of glass. victor does find it scary... but exhilarating.}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{we'll build a fort. so the lightning can't get us.}
<A>__{he races about the room, grabbing every pillow he can find and hurling them to her. big decorative pillows from the chaise, bed pillows from the armoire... they all come flying. she giggles as a big one knocks her flat. victor scampers onto the bed with her. they pile the pillows around and above, concealing themselves in a bulging heap of cushions. inside the pillow fort victor pokes his hand up, widening a space so they can still see. lightning glistens in their upturned eyes.}
<C>__{elizabeth}
<D>__{are you sure it can't hurt us?}
<C>__{victor}
<D>__{nothing can. not ever.}
<A>__{she seeks his hand. fingers clasp. comfort and strength. tilt up to the skylight. rain drumming the glass...}
