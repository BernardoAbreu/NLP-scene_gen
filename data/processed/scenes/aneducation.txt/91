<L>__{exterior school. day}
<A>__{jenny is half walking, half running, towards the school gates. she's scared, of course, but exhilarated, too. all that pressure, and all those years of education, suddenly over, unexpectedly, and certainly unceremoniously. she looks neither left nor right, but other girls, younger girls, watch her through the windows as she leaves. jenny doesn't even look round when she goes through the school gates.}
<L>__{interior kitchen. evening}
<A>__{later. jenny and marjorie are sitting at the kitchen table. jack is standing over them; he hasn't even taken his coat off, or put his briefcase down.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{how d'you mean, left?}
<A>__{jenny doesn't answer.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what about your exams?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i'm not sitting them.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what are we going to tell people?}
<C>__{jenny}
<P>__{(witheringly)}
<D>__{oh, telling people. i'd forgotten that what we tell people is more important than anything.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{all that...}
<A>__{marjorie knows what he's going to say, and doesn't want him to.}
<C>__{marjorie}
<D>__{jack!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no. no need for jack. she should hear it. all that money! do you know how much it's cost me for you to go through school and take no exams?}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{i'm sure david will pay you back. send him a bill. as you said, he wouldn't have wanted me if i was dim, so he should fork out. just tell me why there's a point in sitting my exams, and there's no point in me going to university.}
<A>__{jack gapes at her. he's floundering.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{you know what your trouble is, don't you? you're too clever by half.}
<C>__{jenny}
<D>__{in which case i should have left school years ago, shouldn't i? ask them for the money back. if i'm too clever by half, you overpaid by a third.}
