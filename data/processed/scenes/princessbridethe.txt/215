<T>__{cut to:}
<B>__{inigo}
<A>__{drunk as a skunk, sprawled in front of a hovel, a bottle of brandy in one hand, the six fingered sword in the other. he looks dreadful. unshaven, puffy eyed, gaunt. but the way he brandishes the great sword in front of him would give anyone cause for worry.}
<C>__{inigo}
<D>__{i am waiting for you, vizzini. you told me to go back to the beginning. so i have. this is where i am, and this is where i will stay. i will not be moved.}
<A>__{he takes a long pull from his brandy bottle. he stops as the assistant brute comes into view.}
<C>__{assistant brute}
<D>__{ho there.}
<C>__{inigo}
<D>__{i do not budge. keep your "ho there."}
<A>__{he waves his sword dangerously.}
<C>__{assistant brute}
<D>__{but the prince gave orders }
<C>__{inigo}
<D>__{ so did vizzini when a job went wrong, you went back to the beginning. and this is where we got the job. so it's the beginning, and i'm staying till vizzini comes.}
<C>__{assistant brute}
<P>__{(gesturing off screen)}
<D>__{you! brute! come here.}
<C>__{inigo}
<D>__{ i am waiting for vizzini }
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(off screen)}
<D>__{you surely are a meanie.}
<A>__{inigo feels a hand on his back. a huge hand. he compares it to his own smaller hand.}
<C>__{fezzik}
<D>__{hello.}
<C>__{inigo}
<D>__{it's you.}
<C>__{fezzik}
<D>__{true!}
<A>__{and as the assistant brute is just about to club inigo's brains out, fezzik lets fly with a stupendous punch. the assistant brute takes the full force of the blow right in the chops. it's like he was shot from a cannon as he careens backwards out of sight across the street. there is a pause. then a crunching sound, as he clearly has come in contact with something hard and immobile. fezzik puts inigo down.}
<C>__{fezzik}
<D>__{you don't look so good.}
<P>__{(after inigo blasts air in protest)}
<D>__{you don't smell so good either.}
<C>__{inigo}
<D>__{perhaps not. i feel fine.}
<C>__{fezzik}
<D>__{yeah?}
<A>__{and so fezzik puts inigo down. that's when inigo faints, and as he does,}
