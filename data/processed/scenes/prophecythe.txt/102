<T>__{dissolve to:}
<L>__{exterior village night}
<A>__{katherine stands there in the chilly darkness outside the kiva. mary's grandmother, passing with some other women, pauses and squeezes katherine's arm.}
<C>__{grandmother}
<D>__{now we sleep, katherine. tomorrow, after dark, we begin again.}
<B>__{inside the kiva}
<A>__{the fire has died to embers, casting its weak glow on a now empty room.}
<B>__{outside}
<A>__{katherine wanders along the edge of the village, turning up her collar under a blinding mass of stars. there's nothing beyond the village. not a light, not a sound. say the wind. it is the icy brush of wind on her body that now whispers.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{hello, katherine.}
<A>__{like the wind, it is low and thin and hoarse. like the wind it seems to come from everywhere. and, like the wind, it is utterly without pity or remorse. katherine turns. perched on the wall behind her in a low crouch is a figure clad entirely in layers of black. its head and hands are hairless and waxy white. there are eyes in this winged head, but blood chilling ones of putrid yellow. there are endless scars and shapes and wrinkles, but mostly, only, there are the eyes. katherine gulps down, with only partial success, the hysteria rising in her throat.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{oh lord, i can't do this. i can't do this anymore...}
<C>__{figure}
<D>__{we must talk, katherine.}
<A>__{it's takes all her strength to look upon him.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{you're... you're...}
<P>__{(tries to form the word)}
<D>__{...god?}
<C>__{figure}
<D>__{god is love, katherine.}
<A>__{the eyes narrow. rippling pools of unfathomable evil.}
<C>__{figure}
<D>__{ i don't love you.}
<A>__{there's a crouched silhouette beside the figure. dimmer. skinny. a wheezing sycophant. an afterthought. katherine backs away from both of them.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{i can't. i can't do this tonight. go away.}
<C>__{figure}
<D>__{i can kill you, katherine. i can lay you out and fill your mouth with your mother's feces. or i can talk with you.}
<A>__{katherine stops. faces him.}
<C>__{figure}
<D>__{i am here, before you, in a form to put you at ease.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{good job.}
<A>__{the sycophant shivers and ruffles something feathery under its cloak.}
<C>__{figure}
<D>__{i rarely do this in person. i am, perhaps, somewhat out of touch.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{are you one of them?}
<C>__{figure}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{you're not an angel?}
<C>__{figure}
<D>__{oh, i am an angel. a very special one. the first. the oldest. the naive eagle scout, he once loved me above all others, and i him. it was the only true love for either of us, but like all true love, it couldn't possibly last.}
<A>__{the figure cranes his neck around to the horizon beyond them. the movement makes a liquid, snapping sound.}
<C>__{figure}
<D>__{the winged party boys will come, katherine. they'll come to feed on the guts of your little mary.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{what do you care?}
<C>__{figure}
<D>__{i have my interests...}
<A>__{he turns back to her.}
<C>__{figure}
<D>__{the naive eagle scout, he has his interests too. he even has a place for them, as i do for mine. big, shiny place. you'd like it. only it's been empty for a long time. can't open till after the resurrection. the problem's with the hired help. always had problems with the hired help. they're arrogant, boastful little pricks. not like me. what i did i did for love. but they, the winged party boys, even before the park could open for its first customer, they started fighting over the popcorn stand.}
<A>__{the figure shifts his perch on the wall.}
<C>__{figure}
<D>__{you see, katherine, heaven can't start accepting guests till this fight is settled. and without people, there is no heaven. all those good and true souls left mouldering in the ground clutching their h tickets and waiting and waiting and waiting... some, lying down there with the worms century after century, they start to get doubts about the whole program. that's when, out of sheer boredom, some of them come to me. because i'm always open for business. 24 hours a day, seven days a week. even on christmas.}
<A>__{the figure's face darkens.}
<C>__{figure}
<D>__{some of the angels cheat. they sneak a few souls in to help with the fight. the really dark ones. and now one of them has found a special soul so wonderfully sick that it might just win it for them. and if one side wins, even the wrong one, then there's no fight. and if there's no fight, there can be a heaven.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{and if there's a heaven?}
<C>__{figure}
<D>__{i'd be very unhappy.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i am here to help you and the little bitch not because i love you, not because i care about you, but because i want this war to go on and on and on.}
<A>__{the figure straightens up, stretching its spine.}
<C>__{figure}
<D>__{i bring you the chance to save your mary, katherine. and along the way, stop the resurrection.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{figure}
<D>__{listen when i speak. now go to bed, katherine. tomorrow, i promise you, is a big day.}
