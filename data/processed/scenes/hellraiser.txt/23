<L>__{interior kirsty's room day}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{i said: i found a room.}
<A>__{we begin to draw back from kirsty now, as she continues to speak to her father. she's sitting on a battered chair by the door. the room she's in is cramped and dirty. from outside, the sound of trains going by.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{i thought you were going to stay with us for awhile?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<P>__{(pained)}
<D>__{no dad.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{you'd like the house.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{you'd like my room.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{do you want me to come over?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<P>__{(hastily)}
<D>__{no, no. not just yet. it needs ... er ... some work.}
<A>__{that it does. the place, now we've got a good view of it, is a total dump.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{well i want you to see the house.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{i'm not going to change my mind, dad.}
<A>__{as she speaks she reaches forward to pull a picture, tacked to the wall, of a ourangoutang, with breasts collaged onto it, down. she succeeds. beneath there's a large hole in the wall, which the picture was there to conceal. plaster falls from it.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<P>__{(mouths the word)}
<D>__{great.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{well come over, will you? see the place?}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{maybe tomorrow. i got to go look for a job.}
<C>__{larry }
<D>__{ok. honey. well you take care. i love you.}
<C>__{kirsty}
<D>__{i love you too.}
<A>__{she puts the receiver down. as she does so the small table on which the 'phone is sitting collapses. she covers her face with her hand.}
