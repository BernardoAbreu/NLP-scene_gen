<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{ so our first date, she told me about her favorite place in the world, the seven pools of hana on the island of maui...}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{gorgeous.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{a year and a half later, we were both in hawaii for the pro bowl. now i've always hit a wall at 18 months. every serious girlfriend lasts 18 months. it's like ka boom. the curse of 18 months.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{that's when you need to cement, and define define define.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{exactly. and the world does not need another 35 year old bachelor. i knew i wanted to propose, so i took her there.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{to the pools?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{to the pools. now she's miss rock climber, and i'm more the non rock climber, but we're hiking up through the pools and there's a fine mist in the air, and i have the ring in my pocket, and i'm a little nervous, i'm lagging behind, and she says to me, get this "hurry up, klutz."}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{oh no }
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{well, it bothered me somewhat. and i got quiet. and now she's quiet and we're both pouting a little, you know. and i decide i'm not going to propose. the mood is not right. why be impulsive? now at this point i know she knows that i was going to propose and didn't. and she knows i know. so the entire sixty mile ride back to the airport, we don't speak. and we're both good at that. we fly to honolulu in silence. we check into the pro bowl hotel }
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{how sad }
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{but wait...}
<B>__{back to dorothy}
<A>__{she is now craning out into the aisle to hear this story. the plane is now quieter. she listens to the easy sound of jerry discussing his charmed life.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(waking up)}
<D>__{mama }
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{shhh. mommy's eavesdropping.}
<A>__{he sneezes, three big ones in a row. she hands him more kleenex, riveted on the story. and listens.}
<C>__{jerry's voice}
<D>__{now little do i know that my assistant. has assumed that i've now proposed. so she has gotten the lounge band to actually play "here comes the bride" when we walk back in.}
<A>__{dorothy laughs to herself, somewhat derisively. she tries to share the laugh with her son, who stares at her. back to jerry later}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{which they do. and we're standing there. all the football guys are in the lobby, watching, there's even an espn crew. so i turn to her and sort of grandly say, "well, this is me, klutz, asking you, goddess of rock climbing, to marry me." and i took out the ring, and i don't much like big scenes, but she said "yes" right there in the lobby and some of the toughest men in football wept like babies. we're getting married in february.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{jerry. you two will be together forever.}
<B>__{back to dorothy}
<A>__{she takes one of her son's kleenex sheets, as an elegant flight attendant shuts the curtain to first class. dorothy blows her nose, moved against her will.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{what's wrong, mom?}
<C>__{dorothy}
<D>__{first class is what's wrong. it used to be a better meal. now it's a better life.}
<A>__{she pulls out the mission statement, aware that she's been listening to its author. she opens it and begins to read.}
