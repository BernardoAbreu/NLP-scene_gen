<A>__{a crisis atmosphere prevails. the big room is more crowded than we've ever seen it, with engineers and managers hurrying by, huddling in tense, conferring knots, or muttering feverishly into microphones. on the center screen, a giant image of mars. a frantic flow of green numbers crawls above and below this, and the site of the mars one base camp is marked in blinking red.}
<B>__{woody and his crew}
<A>__{are staring up at this screen, appalled. mcconnell and beck stand nearby, briefing them.}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{then, at 1417, the x band continuous data stream from mars went silent. all data med, environmental, everything suddenly stopped. while we were trying to figure out what the hell went wrong, we got a signal from the folks at the large array at soccoro.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{at the same moment we lost the data stream, they picked up an intense burst of energy from mars.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{what do you mean, "intense"?}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<P>__{(hesitates)}
<D>__{catastrophic.}
<A>__{looks are exchanged among the mars two crew.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{what about the crew?}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{the level of energy in the pulse... didn't seem survivable.}
<C>__{woody}
<D>__{what about the remo? it went into mars orbit last week. maybe that could give us some clue.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{good thinking, woody. that's just what we tried nexterior}
<A>__{he leans over, punches buttons on a keyboard.}
<B>__{on the center screen}
<A>__{an orange dot can be seen in its orbital ellipse around mars, leaving a glowing electronic trail. this dot gets isolated in a viewing box, then enlarged and rotated into the computer animated image of a small, ugly, industrial looking unmanned cargo craft, labelled "remo."}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{the resupply module checked out fine. no instrument failures, no change in status. orbit holding steady. but there was something else. the remo's computer contained an uplink message a very faint, highly distorted transmission from mars one base camp.}
<C>__{terri}
<D>__{someone's alive.}
<C>__{mcconnell}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{phil}
<D>__{how?}
<C>__{beck}
<D>__{the message is almost indecipherable. two teams are still working on it. you better see for yourselves.}
