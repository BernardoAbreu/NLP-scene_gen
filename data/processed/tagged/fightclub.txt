<D>__{yes. we're men. men is what we are.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{six months ago, bob's testicles were removed. then hormone therapy. he developed bitch tits because his testosterone was too high and his body upped the estrogen. that was where my head fit into his huge, sweating tits that hung enormous, the way we think of god's as big.}
