<L>__{interior jerry's house, jerry's bedroom morning}
<A>__{the room is dark and messy. jerry, a soft, unshaven boy of about eighteen years, sits on the end of his bed in boxers and an old t shirt. he has not quite woken up yet. jerry pulls a huge, well traveled suitcase from his closet and tosses it onto the bed. he begins grabbing articles of clothing from the closet and tossing them into the suitcase.}
<L>__{interior jerry's house, kitchen moments later}
<A>__{jerry is in his kitchen, which is no brighter than his bedroom, and not much cleaner. jerry takes another bite of his peanut butter and jelly sandwich. he chews mechanically, washing it down with a can of soda. his lazy mind is somewhere else.}
<L>__{interior jerry's house, bathroom moments later}
<A>__{jerry gargles with a generic brand of mouthwash and spits into the sink. he catches a glimpse of himself in the medicine cabinet mirror he is not very attractive. he grabs his toothbrush and razor, and exits the bathroom.}
<L>__{interior jerry's house, jerry's bedroom moments later}
<A>__{the room has been stripped except for the bed minus its bedsheets, a naked pillow, a beat up dresser with a small tv on top of it, an old pogo stick propped against the wall near the garbage can at the foot of the bed, and a few posters and scraps of trash. jerry tosses his toothbrush and razor into his suitcase next to a video game console and several video games, on top of which lies grand theft auto iii. he has pitifully few belongings. he shuts the suitcase.}
<L>__{interior jerry's house, living room moments later}
<A>__{the living room is also a mess the place is either a pig sty or a house full of bachelors. jerry, now in sweatpants and sneakers, but still wearing the same t shirt that he slept in, carries his suitcase through the foyer to the front door. he about faces to look at the interior of his home. he will not miss it. he turns to open the screen door it's stuck. he fiddles with handle until the screen door opens. he exits, letting the screen door slam shut behind him.}

<L>__{interior rescue squad, kitchen continuous}
<A>__{the kitchen is empty except for heather and allison, both about nineteen and dressed in ems uniforms with "ems" stitched conspicuously on the back, seated on opposite sides of a wooden table. heather is dark haired, about 5'9" and built like a lingerie model. allison has blond hair, is several inches shorter than heather, and although not overweight, she has a softer build than heather. heather has take out pancakes and sausages in front of her, and she is putting it away like she is preparing for famine. allison has a bagel and a peach, which remain hardly touched she has a lot on her mind.}
<C>__{heather}

<C>__{heather}
<D>__{carter said. he got some job at some company, giving his uncle hand jobs.}
<A>__{having put away the last of her food, heather lights a cigarette and stands near the open window, careful to blow the smoke out the window.}

<C>__{heather}
<D>__{i got us tickets to see adam tomorrow.}

<A>__{brad, in jeans with his t shirt thrown over his shoulder, is standing in front of the door, waiting. megan, in shorts, a t shirt and a baseball cap, and amy, in a sunskirt, look on. all in their late teens, they are unmade and worn out, as if they hadn't slept last night. brad rings the doorbell twice and waits some more. brad walks over to the window a few feet over from the door, trying to peer through the shades. megan passes the time by pulling jimmy's mail out of the mailbox that hangs next to the door.}
<C>__{brad}
<P>__{(banging on the window pane)}
<D>__{hey! jimmy!}
<A>__{the door opens and jimmy answers, in his very late teens, about 5'4" and thin, dressed in boxers, a t shirt and bedroom slippers. jimmy's tired, but brad's a friendly face.}

<P>__{(explaining to amy)}
<D>__{jimmy's got like, six jobs.}
<A>__{jimmy stands aside, allowing megan and amy into his apartment. megan and amy step inside, but brad holds back. he needs to talk to jimmy, and the girls do not need to hear.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{hey jimmy, hold up a sec. look, not for nothin', but you know buggerin' bobby bales is askin' about you?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{askin'? like how?}
<C>__{brad}

<C>__{brad}
<D>__{yesterday. i was puttin' a twenty timer on indiana for tonight, and he up and out of the blue asks about you. jimmy, man. goddam.}

<A>__{brad steps past jimmy into the apartment, and jimmy shuts the door after them.}
<L>__{exterior pool morning}
<A>__{the slender white board extends majestically over the glistening blue water. pedro, an unshowered, pot bellied hispanic, about twenty three years of age and wearing cut off jean shorts, is standing at the end of the board, looking down at the water below as if expecting an invitation. corey, a late teenager covered with tattoos, with twigs for arms and legs, lies against the hard concrete while inserting the pool vacuum hose into one of the many pool skimmer drains. pedro begins to bounce on the board up, down, up, down. pedro launches forth as if the water called out to him and, but for his want of grace, the entry would be poetic. instead, pedro's dive is as clumsy as it is painful.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{nice.}
<C>__{pedro}
<D>__{fuck you, conjo. this is my shower.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{maybe back in mexico that's a shower, in athens that's just dirty.}
<C>__{pedro}
<D>__{clean the pool, conjo, clean the pool.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{at least i'm paid to be here.}
<A>__{pedro smiles as he paddles away from corey, starting to enjoy his morning swim. a payphone hanging on the pool house starts ringing. corey drops the vacuum and runs toward the payphone. in the background a number of enormous sand filters groan loudly.}
<C>__{corey }
<D>__{wynwood pool house, corey speaking.}
<A>__{emily, the voice on the other end, is hushed and uncertain.}
<C>__{emily's voice}
<D>__{it's me.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{emily?}
<C>__{emily's voice}
<D>__{some other girl would be calling you?}

<D>__{at home.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{what for?}
<C>__{emily's voice}
<D>__{just because. i need to stay with you for a couple days.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{emily, our place is tiny, we got no water. our phone just got shut off, too. you'd be miserable like us. what for anyway?}
<C>__{emily's voice}
<D>__{it's no big deal. just come pick me up.}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{fine, forget it then.}

<D>__{fine. thanks, then.}
<L>__{interior jessica's apartment morning}
<A>__{jessica, about eighteen, wire thin and plain, yet attractive in an unkept sort of way, with dirty blond hair past her shoulders, lies on a couch sleeping. her chokingly small living room is in a devastating state of disarray, with clothes and empty food containers flung in every direction. an alarm on a table next to the couch begins blaring, and jessica stretches out her arm to silence it.}
<L>__{interior jessica's apartment, bathroom moments later}
<A>__{jessica is standing in front of the mirror staring at herself, still half asleep. the bathroom is tiny like the living room pathetic rather than endearing. she puts toothpaste on her toothbrush.}
<L>__{interior jessica's apartment, living room continuous}
<A>__{jina, jessica's mother, opens the front door and enters the living room wearing a grocery checkout clerk's uniform. jina drops her old, worn out purse onto the coffee table and enters the hallway. she opens the bathroom door and enters.}
<L>__{interior jessica's apartment, bathroom continuous}
<A>__{jessica is brushing her teeth when jina enters.}
<C>__{jina}
<D>__{aren't you supposed to be watching katie right now?}
<A>__{jina reaches around jessica and opens the medicine cabinet, grabs a bottle of aspirin, and shuts it. jessica continues brushing as if her mother were not there.}
<C>__{jina }
<D>__{did you get my message?}
<A>__{jessica shakes her head in the negative sense. jina exits the bathroom and jessica follows, still brushing her teeth.}
<L>__{interior jessica's apartment, living room continuous}
<A>__{jessica walks over to the answering machine and hits a button. the answering machine clicks on as jessica brushes unenthusiastically.}
<C>__{answering machine}
<P>__{(electronic voice)}
<D>__{you have one new message.}
<P>__{(jina's voice)}
<D>__{hi jess, it's your mother, calling to say happy birthday, since you'll be gone when i get home. i'm driving your sister to school and i'm leaving the car for her, so i will be taking the train back.}
<A>__{jessica starts up as if she'd been struck. she spins around to an open window near the couch, leans out, and spits out the toothpaste to the concrete sidewalk below. her mother's voice continues to pour forth from the answering machine.}
<C>__{answering machine }
<D>__{by the way, you should call your sister and stop this not talking nonsense.}
<A>__{jessica finishes spitting the suds from her mouth and spins back towards the answering machine.}
<C>__{answering machine }
<D>__{anyway, i know how you hate long messages, so i will see you tomorrow...}
<A>__{suddenly wide awake, jessica turns to her mother.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{that's fucking bullshit.}
<C>__{jina}
<D>__{here we go again.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{what about my car?!}
<C>__{jina}
<D>__{jessica, your sister got into beauty school, and she's going. now i've got about two hours sleep before i have to drive her all the way the hell up there.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{yeah, i heard that.}
<C>__{jina}
<D>__{jess, you're still living here for free.}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{on the couch!}
<C>__{jina}
<D>__{jessica, it's still my car, and she needs it. can't you be happy for your sister?}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{oh yeah, i'm real happy. she gets my car, and i get shit. thanks, jina. do me a favor and tell her how fucking happy i am for her.}
<C>__{jina}
<D>__{if you're going to be like this, i'm just going to bed.}
<A>__{jessica storms back into the bathroom and rinses her mouth out with water. jessica returns to the living room wearing a t shirt that reads "athens youth group" in large letters along the front. jina is gone. jessica runs her hand through her hair, tossing it haphazardly. she grabs a pair of large sunglasses off of the coffee table and places them over her eyes. she opens the door and exits the apartment.}
<L>__{exterior ron's gym morning}
<A>__{jimmy's piece of shit hatchback is parked in front of the small bare bones gym.}
<L>__{interior ron's gym, locker room continuous}
<A>__{jimmy now dressed in worn out heavily frayed khaki shorts and a short sleeve button down shirt with a "ron's gym" emblem on the pocket, stands before his locker twisting the combination lock with one hand while rotating steel chinese stress balls with his other hand. he opens the locker and pulls out a large brown lunch bag propped prominently at the base.}
<C>__{ron }
<D>__{hey jimmy. you fix the lat machine?}
<A>__{ron, the tall, well built, forty something owner of the gym, approaches. jimmy turns toward ron. the row of lockers serves as a backdrop.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{jimmy, i'm just gonna say this, alright? i gotta let you go. i can't afford two employees.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{so you're keeping melinda?}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{ron, that is totally fucked! i been here way longer than her!}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{yeah, but i'm running a business. there're guys who pay me dues just 'cause she works here.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{but she doesn't do anything! she just sits at the front desk all day.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{i know that.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{tell her to fix the fucking lat machine, she'll look at you cross eyed.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{i can't afford two employees, and she attracts business. that's it.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{fucking great. thanks.}
<C>__{ron}
<D>__{jimmy, don't take it personal. if you were built like her i'd keep you.}
<A>__{ron exits and jimmy sits on the bench in front of his locker, defeated. buggerin' bobby bales, a.k.a. bobby the bookie, an enormous juicehead built like an old school nfl linebacker, naked except for a towel around his neck, having just taken a shower, is leaning against the end of a row of lockers, waiting for his chance at jimmy. jimmy would rather that ron stay.}
<C>__{ron }
<D>__{bales.}
<A>__{bobby nods in response as ron passes by on his way out. with the locker room empty, bobby unconsciously changes demeanor. he's tender, frighteningly tender, it's so entirely genuine. jimmy would prefer a beating simple and final. jimmy pulls his backpack out of his locker and begins clearing his stuff.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{so where you been?}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{what are you talkin' about? nowhere. i been working.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{so you just don't return my phone calls.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{look, they lost, i owe you some more, so what? i will pay you. i want to put it on indy tonight.}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{i can't take any more of your bets. i look like a spineless fucking fag.}
<A>__{bobby shuts jimmy's locker and steps up to jimmy so that jimmy is now face to face with bobby's enormous organ a terrifying sight for mortal men and reputable women. jimmy is struck silent, savagely clenching his chinese stress balls as he struggles for thought.}
<C>__{bobby }
<D>__{what the hell am i supposed to do with you jimmy? people are talkin'.}
<C>__{jimmy}
<D>__{i know they're talkin'!}
<C>__{bobby}
<D>__{you don't know a fuckin' thing. come by my apartment tonight, we'll figure this out.}

<D>__{jimmy, i ain't about beggin'. i'm lookin' like a fool all on account 'a you. you owe me. you owe me. i'm gettin' sick of it.}
<A>__{bobby moves on to his own locker.}
<L>__{exterior pool continuous}
<A>__{wide across the width of the pool. corey, wet, with goggles on his head, holding a wrench and screw driver, and bystander #1, stand over a young twenty ish female victim who lies passed out on the cement. a young female lifeguard is kneeling beside the victim, checking her pulse and breathing. the two swimmers left in the pool are climbing out. pete, a no nonsense grounds keeper in his late thirties, wearing cut off shorts, a faded t shirt and a tool belt, approaches to have a word with corey.}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{is she alright?}
<C>__{corey}
<D>__{she fainted.}
<C>__{lifeguard}
<D>__{alright, i'm calling 911. everybody stay out of the pool.}

<D>__{aw, come on, pete! i need off tomorrow! i told you i got community service!}
<C>__{pete}
<D>__{so you're gonna have to get everything done today then. get going.}
<A>__{corey tears the goggles off his head, throws them into the pool, and about faces toward the pool house. as corey leaves, a red headed idiot does a sloppy can opener off the side of the pool.}

<L>__{exterior empty park morning}
<A>__{though the park is in a poor neighborhood, it is relatively clean. the park is quiet and unused this morning except for two young girls making their way across it. prominent in the background sits an old run down yellow car that jessica drove to the park. jessica is carrying katie, a plain, tiny seven year old girl, in piggy back fashion, with katie's legs dangling out in front of jessica. katie holds jessica tight around the collarbone.}
<C>__{katie}

<D>__{happy birthday!}
<C>__{jessica}
<D>__{thank you.}
<A>__{jessica begins walking faster, soon breaking into a crippled run, the weight of katie bearing down on her. they reach their destination a rickety old merry go round. jessica turns her back to the merry go round, allowing katie to step onto it.}
<C>__{jessica }
<D>__{hold on tight or you'll get hurt.}
<C>__{katie}
<D>__{i will.}

<L>__{interior ambulance morning}
<A>__{heather is driving the ambulance, sirens blaring, a cigarette hanging out of her mouth, with allison riding shotgun. harry, mild mannered, rotund, middle aged and slightly balding, is in the back sitting on a bench extending from the side of the ambulance, adjacent to a stretcher. harry sits expressionless, adjusting his spectacles as the ambulance shakes mildly from the driving.}

<P>__{(pointing)}

<A>__{wide on the ambulance tearing through town, lights flashing. heather is driving extremely fast in this emergency situation, recklessly passing both moving vehicles as well as stationary vehicles that have stopped to let the ambulance pass, on her way to running through a red light. in the rear of the ambulance, harry whips back and forth on the bench, yet remains calm, as if unaware of heather's reckless driving.}
<L>__{exterior pool, parking lot continuous}
<A>__{within the parking lot, the ambulance comes to a screeching halt in front of a large picket fence encircling the pool. at the gate stands the lifeguard. all three climb out of the ambulance. harry rushes toward the lifeguard. heather takes a final puff of her cigarette and flicks it aside before continuing in the same direction as harry. allison lags behind, pulling a backboard and a large first aid kit out of the ambulance.}

<D>__{she's in here.}
<A>__{they enter the gate.}
<L>__{exterior pool continuous}
<A>__{heather and harry follow the lifeguard into the pool area, where several bystanders have gathered around the victim, bystander #1 and pete among them. heather gets to the victim first, but stops short she recognizes the victim. harry brushes past heather.}

<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{she started dating steve right after we broke up. i mean right after. i asked him if there was another girl, and he never answered. he couldn't answer, because he was fucking that slut.}
<C>__{allison}
<D>__{that doesn't mean they fucked.}
<A>__{heather gives allison a disapproving look, as if to say "don't be stupid, stupid." as heather and allison approach the victim, harry looks up.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{alright, she ain't comin' around.}
<A>__{allison lays the backboard adjacent to the victim, and the three place her on the backboard. heather is a bit rough.}

<C>__{heather}
<P>__{(without looking up)}
<D>__{i know what i'm doing.}

<L>__{interior ambulance continuous}
<A>__{allison and harry are in the back with the victim, and heather is again behind the wheel, moving her head ever so slightly, as if to music playing in her head. heather's moderate driving speed is in sharp contrast to the speed with which she responded to the scene. at the same red light that heather recklessly ran earlier, heather stops and looks in all directions before proceeding, even though there are no cars at the intersection.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{uh, heather, you want to step on it?}
<C>__{heather}
<D>__{we'll get there.}
