<A>__{the room is filled with the survivors of the lakul. they are all members of the el auriaan race humanoid and dressed in distinctive clothing. the survivors are in various states of shock. many sit on the floor, staring into middle distance. some lie on tables, unconscious. others are mumbling incoherently to themselves. chekov and the journalists are moving from person to person trying to get control of the situation as the ship is rocked and flung about. chekov has a tricorder.}

<A>__{one journalist moves past a man sitting on a bio bed with a dazed look on his face. he has a nasty looking wound on one side of his face. (we will later learn that this man is named doctor soran.) the journalist is about to turn away when suddenly soran grabs him roughly clearly a man of great strength and pulls him close. soran's eyes are suddenly wild, crazed.}

<A>__{soran begins to attack the journalist, but before he can do any real damage, chekov injects soran with a hypospray and soran falls unconscious.}

<D>__{what was he talking about?}
<A>__{suddenly a woman with her back toward us stumbles nearby. chekov quickly grabs her arm and catches her before she falls.}
<C>__{chekov}
<D>__{easy there...}
<A>__{the woman turns around and we see her face for the first time it's guinan. she seems dazed and confused. chekov smiles at her warmly.}

<A>__{as he guides guinan onto a table...}
