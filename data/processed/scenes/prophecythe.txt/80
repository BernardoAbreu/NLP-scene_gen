<L>__{interior john's house night}
<A>__{early american bachelor. john collapses onto the couch as katherine heads for the kitchen.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{where do you keep the coffee in this joint?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{above the stove.}
<A>__{she messes with the grounds and filter. thomas paces the room, looks over the pictures and a few weavings.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{what happens if the hand trembler says a ghost has been...}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{ messing with mary? if you're smart you say thank you very much and forget about it. but if you're heavy traditional, and mary's people are serious traditional, you have an enemy ghost way.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{what's that?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{goddamn expensive. it's a sing to purify and drive off the corpse sickness. two days of dancing and ceremony and feeding the whole damn village. not even to mention hiring the yataallii, if you can even find one these days. and you can bet they don't come cheap. but every clan does it a bit different. especially mary's.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{you know them?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{the bitter sky clan. hard core reservation. no lights, no running water, no hbo. their village is out on the edge of old woman butte. million miles from anything. witch country. settled right there in the dead people land where no one else would, right on top of the old anasazi village. they're a dying clan. just the old ones now. all alone out there in the middle of nothing.}
<P>__{(drinks)}
<D>__{they can keep it.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{do people really still believe in it all? ghosts, sings, corpse sickness?}
<C>__{john}
<D>__{depends, i guess. sometimes you go along because it's a village thing, or you don't want to disappoint grandma. but sometimes, when you're alone out there, far from town, and the wind kicks up and sneaks into your hogan... i don't know.}
<A>__{john closes his eyes and drifts off. thomas wanders into the kitchen.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{i think john's out for the evening.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{saturday night in chimney rock.}
<A>__{she hands him a mug of coffee.}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{so how does a person like you end up teaching here?}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{when i was younger i used to believe that no matter how much you mucked around in your life, one day, if you listened hard enough, a voice would tell you what you were really cut out to do. and when it didn't show up on schedule i decided to go look for it. and i looked in a lot of places, believe me. i drove that road out there so far that the end became the beginning again. and it was when i got here that i realized there never was going to be a voice. so i stopped looking and took the first job they offered me. that make any sense to you?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{oh, i know all about voices. problem is not all of them are very nice.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{how did you end up a cop?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{it was the evil of two lessers.}
<C>__{katherine}
<D>__{are you always this cryptic?}
<C>__{daggett}
<D>__{no. when you get to know me i can be down right evasive.}
