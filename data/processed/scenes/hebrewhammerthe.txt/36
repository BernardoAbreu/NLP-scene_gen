<L>__{exterior city street afternoon}
<A>__{the hammer's caddy drives past a sneaky looking salvation navy guy. we do your standard blaxploitation zoom into him as he begins to speak into the lapel of his uniform.}
<L>__{interior santa's workshop continuous}
<A>__{santa holds a walkie talkie in hand and we the hear the voice of the salvation navy guy. although behind him hangs a banner reading, "santa's workshop," the interior is a run down sweatshop.}
<C>__{salvation navy guy }
<D>__{it's me. he's on his way.}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{excellent. everything is going as planned.}
<A>__{santa puts the walkie talkie down, and addresses somebody}
<B>__{o.s.}
<C>__{santa }
<D>__{with the hebrew hammer out of the picture, hanukkah will be nothing more than a confusing and hard to pronounce word. i want to thank you very much jamal for all of your help.}
<A>__{we cut to the other side to reveal whom he's speaking to. jamal, the same black 'elf' from the kwanzaa liberation front sits at the table across from santa.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{pfff. shit nigga, ain't no thang. hey, yo santy claus, so does this mean that you gonna make me an official elf now?}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{can you believe this guy tiny tim?}
<A>__{santa looks over to tiny tim. unshaven, not so tiny anymore, and still on crutches, tiny tim's grown up since 'a christmas carol.' a common street thug. c'mon, did you seriously think that scrooge would give free handouts to the cratchit family forever? tiny tim shrugs his shoulders.}
<C>__{santa }
<D>__{take a look around you jamal. do you see any colored midgets in my workshop?}
<A>__{a shot of a couple of the same elves from the conference room slaving away on the assembly line.}
<C>__{santa }
<D>__{your presence would be a disruption to the utopian model of efficiency i've created here.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{that's some cold shit.}
<A>__{the elves appear to be struggling with the speed at which the products move down the assembly line. the head elf steps out from the assembly line and addresses santa.}
<C>__{head elf}
<D>__{utopian model of efficiency my ass! ever since you took charge, this place has been more like a sweatshop.}
<A>__{the other elves stop working and vocalize their agreement with the head elf.}
<C>__{head elf }
<D>__{we know our rights santa! you're in violation of the union regulations! we're going on strike!}
<A>__{the other elves shout out their approval. santa takes it all in stride.}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{you know something, you're right.}
<A>__{the head elf is taken aback by what seems to be a glimpse of compassion on santa's part.}
<C>__{head elf}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{yeah. this is a sweatshop. and since you elves aren't willing to do the work, i made arrangements to have some taiwanese children shipped over. and i might add, they're more than willing to work for peanuts.}
<A>__{santa performs the two fingered whistle.}
<C>__{santa }
<D>__{come on in boys!}
<A>__{a group of five taiwanese boys file past santa towards the assembly line. as each child passes santa, he hands them each a bag of}
<B>__{peanuts.}
<A>__{at the assembly line, the taiwanese boys move like lightning as they gift wrap boxes clearly labeled "nikey," "kathy lee clothing company," and "starstrucks coffee." the elves, including jamal, watch in amazement at their agility and efficiency. defeated, they shuffle out of the workshop.}
<C>__{tiny tim}
<D>__{so, what's our first plan of attack santa?}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{while i was in taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, i came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. i bought the entire plant.}
<A>__{santa walks over to a fed y truck overflowing with large brown cardboard boxes marked 'product.'}
<C>__{santa }
<D>__{i want you and your men to target every young person in the jewish neighborhoods of every major city of this country. i want you to flood their streets with this product.}
<C>__{tiny tim}
<D>__{what should i charge?}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{oh, that's the beauty of it. these are free samples.}
<A>__{tiny tim's curiosity is peaked.}
<C>__{tiny tim}
<D>__{so what's in the boxes? heroin? cocaine?}
<C>__{santa}
<D>__{worse.}
<A>__{santa slits open one of the boxes with a large knife and pulls out a videocassette generically labeled, "it's a wonderful life."}
<C>__{santa }
<D>__{bootleg copies of the frank capra classic, 'it's a wonderful life.'}
<C>__{tiny tim}
<D>__{that's some cold shit.}
