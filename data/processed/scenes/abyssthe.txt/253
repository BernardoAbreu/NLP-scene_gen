<L>__{exterior the abyss}
<A>__{bud is no longer in pain. his expression is rapt. looking down, past his to a ghostly landscape. his last flare sputters out, but there is light. bioluminescent algae carpet the walls of the canyon below him. and he's right... it is beautiful. the water is so clear we can see down 500 feet past bud's tiny, silhouetted figure, to a vast landscape faintly revealed in spectral pastels. barren as the moon but exquisite, serene. changeless. a place unseen by human eyes. like a firefly below, the lights of big geek are visible. bud descends toward the rov, which has grounded on a narrow shelf. below the shelf, the wall slopes out, suggesting we are near the bottom of the canyon but can't see it. one big geek mirv, sitting there like a dumbshit. bud's feet thump into the sediment next to it, stirring it luminous particles. touchdown... three and half miles of water over his head. bud leans over the warhead in a swarm of fireflies.}
