<L>__{interior benthic explorer bridge day}
<A>__{the bridge is state of the art, with computers and sophisticated navigation and communications gear, looking like mission control with its bank of video monitors. the drilling operations supervisor, leland mcbride, and bendix, the crew chief, watch the invaders swarming the deck below.}
<C>__{mcbride}
<D>__{does not look good at all.}
<A>__{tight on video screen (minutes later) showing divers working in total blackness around some sort of installation on the bottom of the ocean. they move through the harsh floodlights in dreamlike slow motion, looking like space suited figures with their helmets and umbilical hoses.}
<C>__{demarco }
<D>__{no light from the surface. how deep are they?}
<C>__{mcbride }
<D>__{seventeen hundred feet.}
<A>__{wider, showing the navy contingent crowding the control room. demarco is hardcore military, brusque and efficient. kirkhill is a small man with pinched features, wearing a shirt and tie, which on a drill ship means company man and or dickhead.}
<C>__{demarco}
<D>__{i need them to go to over two thousand.}
<C>__{kirkhill}
<D>__{they can do it.}
<P>__{(to mcbride)}
<D>__{get brigman on the line.}
