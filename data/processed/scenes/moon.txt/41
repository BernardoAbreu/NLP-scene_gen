<A>__{sam sits at the comms unit watching a message from his superiors, overmeyers and thompson, a purposeful looking woman in charge and her earnest second. the two talk rapidly and trade off like a tag team. at times their tone can be almost bizarrely whimsical. overmeyers and thompson seem to have known sam for a while, but even so, there is a practised casualness to the repartee. it's a professional friendliness on overmeyers part, no more and for thompson it's merely an eagerness to be involved.}
