<A>__{the three carousers come out into the street. the door closes behind them. the night air is hot and muggy. they walk down the street toward the corner where only the light of the corner bar gives any indication of life. there is a newspaper on the sidewalk which eddie bends down to pick up, and the three men straggle to a halt. eddie opens the paper to the sports pages and starts to read by the light of the street lamp. arnold moves a step to the lamp and leans against it. charlie stands in the middle of the sidewalk, a melancholy, pondering young man. the evening seems to have come to a dead halt. after a moment, eddie starts walking again, reading the paper as he does. the others slowly gather themselves and follow him.}
