<A>__{linda is standing over the stove, sweating as she stirs a hot pot of boiling soup. babe brother and harry are seated at the table playing cards. sunny is on the floor near his mother. every time she move, he follows her. harry notices sunny has his shoes on the wrong foot and adds in a sarcastic way:}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{how old is that boy?}
<A>__{babe brother looks at sunny's shoe.}
<C>__{babe brother}
<D>__{linda, how come you don't see that sunny puts his shoes on right?}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{why in the h...}
<A>__{close to tears, she turns and with exaggerated care, puts the spoon down and gently puts sunny in a chair. she starts to untie his shoes. sunny stares at her while she keeps wiping her eyes.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{let's give dry bones a call to see if he is coming or not. okra likes to exaggerate, keep you waiting all night.}
<A>__{harry slowly gets to his feet and goes in the other room to use the phone. linda watches him go. she is deep in thought. babe brother, attempting to cut the roast before it is ready, is pushed aside by linda, who is almost out of control with rage.}
<C>__{linda}
<D>__{why don't you wait?}
<A>__{babe brother, attempting to forcibly cut a piece of roast, slings linda's arm away. his hand accidentally hits her in the eye. linda grabs the fork, poised to strike, but gains control of herself she looks like a person who is on the verge of having a breakdown. she goes back to putting the shoes on sunny. babe brother, feeling sorry, doesn't know what to do. he automatically picks up the fork and washes it off. linda picks up sunny.}
