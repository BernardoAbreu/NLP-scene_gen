<C>__{daria}
<D>__{why don't you keep my purse? i shouldn't be too long.}
<A>__{daria hands tommy her purse. palms the key card from him. then heads toward the elevator, as... tommy replaces the sick look on his face. does his best to look flirty as he walks over to the security station. leans over the desk with a yummy smile on his face.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{... aloha.}
<A>__{(note: the following scene is intercut : with scenes 20 thru 28.) douglas looks up from his magazine.}
<C>__{douglas}
<D>__{hi.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{i hope you don't take offense at this... but i just have such a weakness for a man in uniform.}
<C>__{douglas}
<D>__{if that's your thing...}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{uniform's definitely my thing. i mean, i see a sailor, i'm thinking, mmm, seafood. y'know?}
<C>__{douglas}
<D>__{i'm not actually supposed to be talking on duty.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{who's talking? honey, this is a flirting... but you're probably just another good looking man wasting it all on women. world's full of fools.}
<A>__{beat. douglas lets him see the genre magazine.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{yahtzee!... okay, mr. i always have a hard nightstick. put away the pictures of those underfed, white males and let's broaden your horizons.}
<C>__{tommy }
<D>__{i like sunsets and puppy dogs, and i'm big in the pants. just hope i'm not too cute for you. and don't tell me it's a color thing, hon, or i will come over there and slap a little discrimination right upside your yummy little cheeks.}
<C>__{douglas}
<D>__{i'm hooked up.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{another big, hot, cuddly, black love jesus got there first. that bitch. taking you. from me.}
<C>__{douglas}
<D>__{sorry.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{hey... this day and age, sweetie, i can appreciate the monogamy. saving it for your number one is keeping the world safe, and it's okay by me. even if you are just breaking my heart... guess i will just have to come in here someday, let you catch me shoplifting and resist arrest just to have you wrestle me down and cuff me.}
<C>__{douglas}
<D>__{i can be pretty rough.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{don't you get me all excited now. i was just learning to accept my disappointment.}
<A>__{tommy sticks out his hand.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{tommy. but you can call me rachel.}
<A>__{shaking hands }
<C>__{douglas}
<D>__{douglas. and, man, i really gotta get back to what i'm supposed to be doing, okay?}
<A>__{he looks away. scans the monitors. angle monitors everything looks normal.}
<B>__{angle back on tommy and douglas}
<A>__{seeing douglas is unaware of what's happening in the vault, tommy relaxes.}
<C>__{tommy}
<D>__{i will leave you alone. but is it okay if i just stand here and stare at the muscles i will be missing for the rest of my life?}
<A>__{off which...}
