<L>__{ext the county courthouse and county offices day}
<A>__{we are looking at the closed double white front doors of the building, through which we can hear a rolling boil of agitated conversation. after a beat, they open to reveal mrs. kintner, looking as though she has been visited by the wrath of god; in effect, she has. her eyes are puffy and swollen from weeping, her clothing is put on and fastened awkwardly, her gait is not normal. as she walks toward us, quint enters with his back to us, they pass without notice; mrs. kintner moving out of sight, quint leading us through the doors into the town hall.}
