<B>__{please note the crystal will be used in the left hand of all characters.}
<T>__{fade in:}
<B>__{before and during titles}
<L>__{exterior sky night}
<A>__{the moon and stars are visible, but as camera looks down, the screen fills with dark, billowing clouds. camera moves into the clouds and just as they blank out the screen, a distant shimmer of light becomes visible. moving toward it, the shimmer becomes}
<L>__{exterior dome of glass night}
<A>__{a glowing but not transparent structure stretching off into the clouds that press it. camera continues to move in until the detailed structural webbing of the dome fills the screen and then camera moves through it and we see}
<L>__{exterior the city day}
<A>__{shining below the dome (which we now see as a series of dome like structures standing off without end) a marvelous crystalline city of great openness, building clusters, green plazas, fountains... multi leveled but human scale, crisscrossed by the flickering clear tubes of the maze cars. closer angle rooftops as a maze car slides softly to a stop. rooftop the runner the hatch opens and a man in a hurry leaves the maze car and runs swiftly along the rooftop and disappears into an open elevator which instantly starts to descend.}
<L>__{int residence plaza the elevator}
<A>__{from a busy courtyard below we watch the elevator slide down from a great height. as it reaches the courtyard the runner darts out, pushes into the crowd.}
<B>__{out with the runner}
<A>__{as he reappears around a corner, skirts a brimming pool and makes for a kind of broad corridor which seems to lead out of the courtyard. he is moving even faster now, glancing back as if he fears pursuit. another angle corridor above, at the railing of an oval light well, dressed in black and silver, a figure holding an odd looking weapon lazily in one hand and watching. it is francis.}
<B>__{with the runner}
<A>__{moving rapidly down the corridor, he suddenly stops as if feeling the presence above. he looks up, sees the sandman and his face breaks in terror. he wheels, frantic, screaming, runs back into the hall. the sandman (francis) vaulting the rail, dropping lightly to ground level, weapon poised.}
<B>__{p.o.v.}
<A>__{the crowd melting, parting to reveal the runner backed against the pool. people are yelling, shaking their fists, terribly excited and fearful.}
<B>__{the sandman}
<A>__{emotionless. aims. fires. the runner close seeming to burst aflame in the lens, then slipping below frame to reveal francis sauntering forward, holstering his weapon. the crowd closing in behind him, applauding, congratulating him.}
<B>__{the sandman}
<A>__{arriving at the pool where the body lies, half immersed. he leans over, lifts the right hand from the water, revealing a palm with a black flowercrystal shape in it. he lets the hand fall back now as the crowd cheers and applauds him.}
<L>__{extreme close up hand in the water (insert)}
<A>__{closing in until the crystal fills the screen.}
<T>__{match dissolve to:}
<A>__{(titles end) close up crystal (insert) clear, sparkling, flower like. camera pulls back to reveal}
<L>__{interior nursery corridor}
<A>__{the crystal is in the hand of a sleeping infant who is behind glass in one of many cubicles. standing outside, looking in, logan, dimly lit in the soft glow of the cubicle where the sleeping infant lies, swaddled and coccooned in the rosy auto tender which caters to the baby's every need. faint music bubbles like distant laughter.}
<B>__{out logan}
<A>__{logan is twenty five, strong, virile (yet sensitive) with a kind of austere grace. he is somewhat manic...proud...as he peers through the nursery window into a kind of foam cocoon which cradles three sleeping infants. logan is knocking on the soundless glass.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{wake up...come on, logan 6.}
<B>__{francis}
<A>__{entering .}
<C>__{francis}
<P>__{(shaking}
<D>__{his head in mild, mocking}
<P>__{disbelief)}
<D>__{you are here. i couldn't believe it when they told me. what are you doing?}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(still knocking on the soundless glass)}
<D>__{turn this way.}
<P>__{(as one of the infants stirs, smiles, bubbles)}
<D>__{no, no...not you...you!}
<A>__{francis tries to pull logan away from the window, but logan is intent on waking one of the infants.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{you should've seen me take my last runner...perfect.}
<P>__{(logan continues to pound the soundless glass)}
<D>__{i backed him up against a residence pool and when he terminated...his hand...}
<P>__{(breaks off as logan is paying no attention)}
<D>__{so now you've seen him...what's the difference awake or asleep?}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(to infant)}
<D>__{open your eyes once, idiot.}
<P>__{(to francis)}
<D>__{it's not every day that a sandman son is born. i'm telling you, francis that's him!}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{maybe, maybe not. what's the difference? come on, logan, let's get out of here before everybody finds out.}
<A>__{but logan isn't moving. francis gets an idea.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{okay...you really want to wake him up?}
<A>__{francis starts to pry at the panel...knowing it will sound an}
<B>__{alarm.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{hey, cut that out !}
<A>__{too late: there is a sound of alarm chimes. the area in which they stand is bathed in a violet glow. logan grabs francis firmly and stops him from prying at the panel:}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{now you've done it...}
<A>__{the chimes stop...but the glow continues, a metallic voice is heard:}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{break in scanners report intrusion, identify.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{logan 5...francis 7, authorized duty quadrant. intrusion accidental.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{clear logan 5 and francis 7.}
<A>__{the violet light goes off.}
<C>__{francis}
<P>__{(with affection: to logan)}
<D>__{had enough?}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(looking at the infant)}
<D>__{even the alarm didn't wake him.}
<A>__{as francis starts out:}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(one last look; joining francis)}
<D>__{all right, francis...i'm with you.}
<A>__{they move off down the corridor...the lights behind them dimming as they pass cubicles suffused with soft pink light, children automatically tended. chimes...soft. a lullaby and a soothing impersonal voice.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{sleep time...go to sleep. sleeping time, little ones.}
<A>__{as they exit nursery...logan stops and takes one final look backward.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{you need a lift. let's go to arcade and celebrate...}
<P>__{(teasing tone)}
<D>__{your alert successor...logan 6.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{has anyone ever broken in to where the babies are?}
<C>__{francis}
<P>__{(putting a card key into a door which opens soundlessly)}
<D>__{not in my time...}
<A>__{they move through the door which closes.}
<L>__{exterior maze station night}
<A>__{they are now on a kind of enclosed platform with widely spaced doorways, each glowing faintly. they pause, waiting.}
<C>__{francis}
<P>__{(peering at logan curiously)}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{just wondered...what happens?}
<C>__{francis}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{dunno...flameout maybe. whatever happens, you can bet it's final. but who would want to find out?}
<A>__{one of the doorways brightens and the word arcade appears on it. the two men move to the spot as a maze car stops. they enter it through the doorway which dims behind them as the maze car whooshes softly off into a kind of twilight.}
<L>__{interior maze car logan and francis}
<A>__{the door slides shut. they sink into seat forms which yield to them. they move off.}
<L>__{exterior maze car}
<A>__{moving through the city at terrific speed. giving us glimpses of the city as it goes. slowing finally as we see: the city featuring arcade brightly lit, garish. we get only a glimpse as the maze car disappears into a tunnel. maze car station arcade as the maze car stops, opens and logan and francis exit into a gathering crowd. full shot arcade glittering, crowded. throngs of people moving on many levels, some walking, some on moving platforms. it's the great white way, luna park you name it. gaudy booths and entrances, featuring every delight too much to take in at a glance.}
<B>__{with logan and francis}
<A>__{as they thread their way through a crowd which admires them when it notices them, across halls and up moving platforms, the good natured argument continuing...}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{but you don't know, you just say what everyone says. one for one. one for one."}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{well, why no!? that's exactly how everything works. how else could the city stay in balance you have a better idea?}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<D>__{no, but at least i wonder sometimes instead of doing that "one for one" song of yours. you sound like a sleepteacher with a stuck tape.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{well the minute you get a better idea you can stop wondering.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you know, logan you wonder a lot. too much for a sandman}
<A>__{they are passing the facade of a relive shop the signs urging people to: relive your most precious memories. do it again and again! refresh and renew anytime!! as they cross the entrance, two men come out, grinning broadly, falling into step just ahead of logan and francis. then one of the men stops abruptly, almost colliding with them. he mumbles an apology and starts back to relive. as he disappears into the relive shop, his friend shrugs cheerfully to logan and francis and moves on. arcade another angle new you they are moving past a shop called new you #483 when a man comes cannonading out, thrilled and excited. he rushes over to a pretty young woman who has been eying logan and francis, plants himself in front of her with his hands framing his face.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{well? how do you like it?}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(critically)}
<D>__{i don't know. the cheeks maybe... look a little }
<C>__{man}
<D>__{cheeks? cheeks? right. too much, you think?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{too little.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{too little?}
<P>__{(gestures)}
<D>__{too little. okay, wait for me.}
<A>__{and he darts back into new you #483. the woman shrugs, glances around, smiles and goes off with a passer by. arcade another angle love shop signs promising love, fulfillment, rare delights. people streaming in and out. a woman comes out looking glazed, breathing "yes...yes..." as she passes camera logan and francis emerge from the crowd and camera moves with them.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{did you ever see francis 8?}
<C>__{francis}
<P>__{(shaking his head)}
<D>__{i never even visited nursery before tonight.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{when you wonder, it slows you up you know?}
<A>__{they are now passing the facade of hallucimill where the signs promise: lift off, crazy lift, super lift...here the people going in are simply excited but the ones coming out are clearly stoned out of their minds...}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{i don't know what makes you so curious. you have any idea who his seed mother was?}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{of course not! i m curious, not sick.}
<P>__{(laughs)}
<A>__{the crowd is growing denser, funneling into a kind of passageway. logan and francis are swallowed up in the group. full shot arcade great hall an immense room into which the streams of people coming from the entertainment area are mingling. there is a general air of anticipation stirring the crowd as camera singles out logan and francis entering, waving to friends. camera closes in on them just as they reach a beautiful woman who is obviously pleased to see francis. they embrace, and as they break:}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{and that's my friend, logan.}
<P>__{(as she acknowledges the introduction)}
<D>__{we're celebrating his next in line. carousel arcade who knows? want to come along?}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(smiles, shakes her head)}
<D>__{only if i make it to the top of carousel.}
<P>__{(she holds up her hand)}
<D>__{thirty and the big spin.}
<A>__{in her palm the crystal blinks, red, black. francis nods, gives her a half squeeze.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{you're thirty already? i always thought i was older than you }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{well, give it a good try.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(pleasantly)}
<D>__{you know i always have.}
<A>__{another beautiful woman joins them.}
<D>__{2nd woman}
<P>__{(to the first)}
<D>__{sorry i won't be at carousel tonight. it1s my love shop turn.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{that's all right. happy turn. 2nd woman you'll renew. i've got a feeling.}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{so do i...but if i don't at least i will have the ultimate thrill. i'd almost rather have that than renew. 2nd woman i feel the same way. sometimes i think i'm not even going to try and renew when my time comes. but that's three years away. so long.}
<A>__{the 2nd woman walks away.}
<C>__{francis}
<P>__{(after a beat; to first woman)}
<D>__{it's been nice.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{um huh.}
<A>__{they look briefly and then she turns away. francis takes logan's arm and they move off.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{i guess you never had her?}
<A>__{logan shakes his head.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{you missed something special.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{well...you can't have them all.}
<C>__{logan and francis}
<P>__{(together, it's an old joke)}
<D>__{but you can try.}
<A>__{they laugh, but the laughter is broken as a trio of youngsters, moving with erratic speed of lightning, smashes between them, almost knocking francis over. he reels, logan catches him and they recover in time to see the trio rip wildly through the crowd, knocking people down, screaming with shrill joy as they disappear.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{the damned yellows are getting out of hand. those three ought to be in cathedral. no business scrambling in arcade...}
<C>__{logan}
<P>__{(laughs cuffs francis' arm)}
<D>__{what an old, old man you're getting to be, francis. weren't you ever a yellow? i bet you were even wilder than }
<P>__{(he breaks off as the lights in the great hall dim)}
<D>__{ come on, sandman.}
<A>__{the two of them start to move to the far end of the great hall. full shot great hall as everyone begins to move to the far end, where great curtains have parted to reveal arcade great hall carousel entrance ac the far end of the hall, where the throng is a huge crystal design ornaments an entrance the crystal is red and pulsing rhythmically to the accompaniment of a deep and thrilling tone. as we move toward it with logan and francis, the tone deepens, the great pulse takes on a hypnotic quality...}
<B>__{with logan and francis}
<A>__{in the crowd they overtake a fellow sandman, daniel, and fall in step with him. when they speak now, their voices are hushed.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{you should have been with us in nursery, daniel. i'm positive i recognized him }
<C>__{francis}
<P>__{(hustling logan)}
<D>__{come on. i don't want to miss the filing in. there'll be some i know tonight, i think...}
<C>__{daniel}
<P>__{(glances at his own red crystal, nods)}
<D>__{yes. me, too. you know we're both on monitor tonight.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{damn! that's right. just when i feel like an all out blast in arcade .}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{want me to take your shift? i'm feeling restless anyway}
<A>__{francis glances at him, exchanges a look with daniel. they vanish into the throng passing under the great crystal, turn the corner and we see full shot carousel framed in a huge corridor we see a steep sided arena dropping down to a shadowy center, which even now pulsates and flickers in changing dimensions, but always maintaining the jewel flower shape. there is one entrance into the center a kind of ramp from below the seats, leading directly into the mysterious bowl just now the seat's are filling, and the sense of expectation builds people sit and immediately crane their necks, waiting...}
<L>__{34. another angle}
<A>__{featuring logan and francis as they find places in the arena. like the others, they crane upward. as they do, logan gestures at a number of pretty girls who are just being seated.}
<C>__{logan}
<D>__{now there's a few who could have been his seed mother.}
<C>__{francis}
<D>__{only a few? you're just not trying.}
<L>__{35 36 out}
<B>__{panning the crowd}
<A>__{as the seats fill, the excitement builds. suddenly the lights begin to dim and dim... sound: a kind of collective sigh, breathing in unison...}
<B>__{out angle the tier below the seats}
<A>__{suddenly visible, the lastday group. their arms are upraised and in each palm the crystal blinks red black, red black.}

<A>__{tense, beginning nervous applause here and there.}
<B>__{carousel}
<A>__{as the last one enters, beginning to glow and, as it does, the bowl slowly puts out leaves like some great plant, enfolding and hiding the people within a series of translucent petals. as the last one enfolds them the light intensifies, the exterior surfaces seeming to shift as if a kind of motion was beginning inside it...}
<B>__{crowd}
<A>__{visible in the growing light from carousel gripped with passion and excitement, applauding, gesturing as they see}
<B>__{carousel}
<A>__{moving, bands of light seeming to spiral upward like a contained aurora as the carousel picks up speed.}
<B>__{logan}
<A>__{caught up in it like the rest.}
<B>__{carousel}
<A>__{beginning to blur with its own speed. through the shifting, spiraling curtain of light we see bodies moving in a kind of weightlessness, always struggling to move higher. follow a shadowy form as it moves, twists through other writhing shadows upward, upward. suddenly the form is spread eagled, and in a moment it is sharply outlined against the swirling canopy and then a searing flash. and it is gone. sound: crowd in a frenzy screaming. full angle the bleacher crowd favoring logan standing. screaming their cheers as: full shot up at carousel high, reaching downward out of the shadows beneath the dome, fringing, intersecting rainbow bands appear, looping the swirling upper carousel like saturn's rings. now we see figures reaching outward toward them...reaching and missing and falling downward against the curtain and the flash of extinction. medium angle a man at the highest level...straining for the rainbow... sweeping pan shot the bleacher crowd hysterical...starting to chant...}

<B>__{logan}
<A>__{not with it. he turns and starts making his way downwards towards the exit. logan's apartment as he enters. idle, restless. he crosses to a sideboard makes himself a drink, sips, doesn't like it. gets rid of it, makes another. he fiddles with things, a game sits, gets up. now he is beginning to feel the drink. takes another belt, smiles. now he goes over to a tall wall recess flanked by a console with many dials.}
<B>__{at the wall recess}
<A>__{as logan dials, blurred and smoky images appear in the recess a slow protoplasmic eddying in many colors. he tunes it in and the figure of a smiling young man appears bejeweled, lustrous, willing.}

<B>__{jessica and logan}
<A>__{still in the recess, she makes no gesture of interest, no smile. around her neck, from a collar, a dangling ankh. it catches logan's eye. he smiles, clicks another dial and she becomes real. he reaches out a hand and leads her out into the room.}
