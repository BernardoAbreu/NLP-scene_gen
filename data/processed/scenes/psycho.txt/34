<A>__{mary nods, starts walking along the line of cars as if making a selection. her eye is caught by the iron newspaper stand on the corner, just outside the lot. she stares at the papers, turns away, as if what she is fearing would have to be impossible, then, having to satisfy herself, goes to the stand, drops a dime in the iron slot, picks up a los angeles newspaper, starts back into the car lot as she glances worried at the front page. as she goes, we see, coming up the street toward the lot, the same patrolman. he sees mary, slows, swerves over to the opposite side of the street, stops by the curb. mary, engrossed in the newspaper, and walking back ease the lot, does not see the patrolman. the car dealer is out on the lot now, standing and waiting for mary. as she approaches, lost in her newspaper, he smiles.}
