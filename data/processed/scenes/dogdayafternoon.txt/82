<L>__{interior limo night}
<A>__{they sit quiet, following the fbi car. the fbi car stops. they stop. silence.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{murphy, can you see what they're doing?}
<C>__{murphy}
<D>__{he's still got some arrangements to make.}
<A>__{sheldon is getting out of the car up ahead. sonny and sal and all of them come alert. as sheldon and the other fbi men get out of their car, a pair of aircraft landing lights become visible, taxiing towards the limo.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{there it is, sal. sal?}
<C>__{sal}
<D>__{i'm here.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{oh, jesus! hey. how about food? i forgot to ask to have food on board.}
<A>__{sheldon has been walking down to the limo. he stops beside mulvaney and knocks on the window. mulvaney rolls it down.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{that's the jet. you give us one more, now. that's the deal...}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{okay. which one goes?}
<A>__{there is silence inside the limo. mulvaney turns to sylvia.}
<C>__{mulvaney}
<D>__{sylvia?}
<A>__{from a handkerchief, sylvia draws a slip of paper.}
<C>__{sylvia}
<D>__{it's maria. go on, honey.}
<A>__{they open the door. they urge her out, and maria goes with a show of reluctance.}
<B>__{on maria}
<A>__{as she stands up outside she is revealed to have a rosary she's counting. improvise goodbyes, tearful and fearful all around. then:}
<C>__{maria}
<D>__{i pray for your safety...}
<P>__{(meaning sonny and sal)}
<D>__{...sal? because i know it's your first plane trip. don't be scared, you know?}
<P>__{(gives him her rosary)}
<A>__{and maria walks away. now the plane has taxied into position, where it can be seen in floodlights. it looks big and impressive. we know the fbi has snipers ringing it.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{i ain't eaten all day. i just realized it.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<D>__{we'll have hamburgers on the plane. you ready?}
<C>__{murphy}
<P>__{(turns to sal again)}
<D>__{sal, keep it up, huh? the gun please...}
<A>__{close sonny looking at the plane, grasping his money and his gun. the rifle stands straight up between his legs. sheldon leans down, peering in at him.}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{what do you think, sal? you ready to go?}
<A>__{angle sal in front of sonny, behind mulvaney. for the first time he smiles. he realizes that escape is within their grasp. the smile transforms him from a formidable mafia imitation into an utterly sweet and defenseless youth.}
<C>__{sal}
<P>__{(gun pointing high)}
<D>__{hey, sonny you did it!}
<A>__{close sonny}
<C>__{sonny}
<D>__{let's move it, goddamn it.}
<C>__{sheldon}
<P>__{(to driver)}
<D>__{you ready to get out first?}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{yes.}
<A>__{driver starts to turn in the driver's seat! sheldon brings up his hands to reach through the open window to grab sonny's rifle barrel, pushes it away, aiming out windshield. mulvaney sees them beginning their move and starts to duck. sal begins to see movement out of the corner of his eyes and is barely beginning to react. driver turning has a gun over the back of the seat! sonny sees it, and sheldon's hand grabbing the barrel of his gun at the same moment. sheldon drives hard into the side of the limo, reaching in. mulvaney grabs the girl next to him and pulls her by the hair down toward the floor. sal, open mouthed with amazement, is a split second late bringing his gun up. driver completes his turn and has his gun leveled at sal between miriam and margaret in middle row. sheldon grabs his rifle barrel and pulls hard. sonny lets it go. sal stares at the gun barrel, trying to get his gun up... driver fires. mulvaney hits the floor. sheldon holds sonny's gun. sonny, close, watches. sal, hit, slams back into the seat; the gun flies upward. another shot hits him, flinging his head back. driver holds his third shot, turns to sonny holds gun to his temple. sonny looks down so he can see fully as: sal's head snaps back for a split second and stares directly into sonny's eyes, upside down. he stares sadly, into sonny's eyes. as though he knew it all along betrayed. and dies. the shot is echoing. now screams, yells, slamming doors, panic... sonny's voice: "shoot me! for god's sake, shoot me!"}
<B>__{full shot}
<A>__{they come pouring out of the limo, scrambling frantically away from it. the limo the people fleeing it. agents pull people away from the car. driver and sheldon and cops peer into the back. sal's body lies slumped. driver, sheldon, other cops stand about, recovering. no one makes the slightest sort of congratulatory move, it was just another job. driver clears his weapon, hands it to sheldon to be filed in case of investigation. on sylvia, mulvaney, hostages they hug, cry, laugh, jump up and down: they're alive!}
<C>__{sylvia}
<P>__{(to mulvaney)}
<D>__{i been dying to do this for years!}
<A>__{and she kisses him hard in the mouth. he laughs and kisses back... close sonny tears are beginning to flood past his defenses:}
<C>__{sheldon }
<D>__{you are under arrest. you have the right to remain silent. you have the right to counsel to be present, during your interrogation.}
<P>__{(etc.)}
<A>__{his voice is dry, as though he were reciting from memory something he learned in a language he doesn't understand.}
