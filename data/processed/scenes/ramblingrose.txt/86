<A>__{a shot of rose and daddy. now rose is sitting penitent and crying in one of daddy's handkerchiefs. daddy's anger is gone, he has gotten control of himself and speaks to her now in a different tone. he sits beside her, an arm around her shoulders in a fatherly way.}
<C>__{daddy}
<D>__{rose, rose, rose, you poor miserable little child, don't you know i love you? do i have to put my hand on your body or kiss your pretty lips to prove it? you are beautiful to me, rose, i've loved you since you first came here, darlin'. and don't you know mrs. hillyer loves you, too, that she's already taken you into her heart, and that that woman's heart is as wide as the blue sky itself and as deep as the stars?}
