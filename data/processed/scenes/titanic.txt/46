<A>__{it is a darkened room lined with tv monitors. images of the wreck fill the screens, fed from mir one and two, and the two rovs, snoop dog and duncan.}

<A>__{live from 12,000 feet. rose stares raptly at the screens. she is enthraled by one in particular, an image of the bow railing. it obviously means something to her. brock is studying her reactions carefully.}
<C>__{bodine}
<A>__{the bow's struck in the bottom like an axe, from the impact. here... i can run a simulation we worked up on this monitor over here. lizzy turns the chair so rose can see the screen of bodine's computer. as he is calling up the file, he keeps talking.}

<A>__{we've put together the world's largest database on the titanic. okay, here...}
<C>__{lovett}
<A>__{rose might not want to see this, lewis.}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{no, no. it's fine. i'm curious. bodine starts a computer animated graphic on the screen, which parallels his rapid fire narration.}
<C>__{bodine}
<A>__{she hits the berg on the starboard side and it sort of bumps along... punching holes like a morse code... dit dit dit, down the side. now she's flooding in the}
<C>__{bodine }
<A>__{forward compartments... and the water spills over the tops of the bulkheads, going aft. as her bow is going down, her stern is coming up... slow at first... and then faster and faster until it's lifting all that weight, maybe 20 or 30 thousand tons... out of the water and the hull can't deal... so skrttt!!}
<P>__{(making a sound in time with the animation)}
<A>__{... it splits! right down to the keel, which acts like a big hinge. now the bow swings down and the stern falls back level... but the weight of the bow pulls the stern up vertical, and then the bow section detaches, heading for the bottom. the stern bobs like a cork, floods and goes under about 2:20 a.m. two hours and forty minutes after the collision. the animation then follows the bow section as it sinks. rose watches this clinical dissection of the disaster without emotion.}
<C>__{bodine}
<A>__{the bow pulls out of its dive and planes away, almost a half a mile, before it hits the bottom going maybe 12 miles an hour. kaboom! the bow impacts, digging deeply into the bottom, the animation now follows the stern.}
<C>__{bodine}
<A>__{the stern implodes as it sinks, from the pressure, and rips apart from the force of the current as it falls, landing like a big pile of junk.}
<P>__{(indicating the simulation)}
<A>__{cool huh?}
<C>__{rose}
<A>__{thank you for that fine forensic analysis, mr. bodine. of course the experience of it was somewhat less clinical.}
<C>__{lovett}
<A>__{will you share it with us? her eyes go back to the screens, showing the sad ruins far below them. a view from one of the subs tracking slowly over the boat deck. rose recognizes one of the wellin davits, still in place. she hears ghostly waltz music. the faint and echoing sound of an officer's voice, english accented, calling "women and children only".}
