<L>__{interior cages close shot taylor and nova day}
<A>__{the compound is dimly lit. taylor, the bandage now gone from his throat, is back in his old cage. the other cages, however, are empty their occupants presumably having been moved to the surgery or the zoo. he is seated on a pile of straw in the rear corner, nova's head cradled on his lap. idly he strokes her coarse hair. there is a dull glow of madness in his eyes, and his manner is one of abstract soliloquy, like a man talking to a dog.}

<A>__{faint footsteps are heard o.s. taylor and nova look in the direction of the sound. a sudden stream of water shoots through the bars and strikes taylor in the chest.}
