<A>__{rafkin rounds a pile of cars, and sees... kalina, on the ground, holding a dying damon in her arms. his throat has been slit, and kalina holds her hand over the gash, trying to keep him from dying. but it's no use... he dies. kalina sobs. rafkin's in awe, perhaps ashamed. rafkin turns nervously away. and there, he sees cyrus's assistant lying, dead, bloody and broken. and beyond him, lies cyrus himself. cyrus's neck has been pierced by a long, metal shard. his eyes stare, cold and dead. rafkin brings his hands to his head, distraught, almost weepy.}

<D>__{cyrus... oh, man... look at you... there goes my bonus.}
<A>__{suddenly, someone grabs his arm, and spins him around. it's kalina. she's sobbing and shaking cyrus's glasses in rafkin's face.}
<C>__{kalina}
<D>__{was it worth it? huh? playing god! was it...?}
<A>__{off rafkin's shell shocked look, we pan over to see the ghost of one of the techs, ripped apart and bloody, studying the scene.}
