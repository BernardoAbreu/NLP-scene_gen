<L>__{interior blade's room night}
<A>__{karen enters. it's dark, just a trace of moonlight.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{blade?}
<A>__{no answer. then karen sees him crouched in the corner of the room like some kind of nocturnal animal.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{it's dark in here.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{you get used to the darkness.}
<A>__{karen takes a step towards him.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{whistler told me about your mother.}
<A>__{blade clutches the silver locket in his hand. it swings back and forth, like a pendulum.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{i can't close my eyes without hearing her scream.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{those aren't real memories. no one has that kind of recall.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{i do. i remember from day one. people staring at me, sensing i was different. watching the fear grow in their eyes, knowing in their hearts i wasn't human.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{if you're not human, then why do you bleed like us? i've seen vampire blood, you don't have it running through your veins.}
<A>__{blade looks at karen, his lambent eyes glowing in the moonlight.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{just get out of here.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{blade }
<A>__{blade turns, his eyes glowing with preternatural fury.}
<C>__{blade}
<D>__{i said, get out!!!}
<A>__{karen backs away, startled by blade's vehemence. she exits, leaving him alone with his demons. he holds up one of his empty serum ampoules, crushing it in his fist.}
<C>__{frost's voice}
<D>__{rise and shine, little wing.}
