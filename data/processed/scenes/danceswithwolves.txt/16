<C>__{general tide}
<D>__{bring up my ambulance...}

<D>__{bring up my ambulance. and bring my surgeon with it. we've got an officer who's worth something lying here.}
<A>__{the aide dashes off to do what he's told, as general tide gently removes dunbar's foot from the stirrup and lays it carefully on the ground. the image fades out.}
