<D>__{perhaps you are home sick. you do sound rather blue.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{i'm not home sick, nick. in fact, i'm not very happy with you.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{me? what did i do?}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{you know damn well, nick. you've been spreading rumors about trent. and he doesn't deserve it.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{doesn't deserve it!?! i'd have to claim he has genital warts to sink to his level.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{well, whatever you said to ed solomon, it was enough to get him to give trent a black eye.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{sheeni, i just don't get it. this guy has cock blocked at every turn and you're taking his side?!?}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{cock blocked?}

<D>__{don't even think it, nick. you know my parents don't approve of you.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i'm confident they will learn to love me. after all, i'm practically family.}
<C>__{sheeni}
<D>__{nick, you must dismiss this thanksgiving notion from your mind. i remain firm on this issue. goodbye.}
<A>__{click. nick regards the phone defensively. he puts it down and takes a seat at the table. he glares at dwayne as they eat breakfast. there comes a knock at the front door.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{don't move, blubber boy, i will get it.}
