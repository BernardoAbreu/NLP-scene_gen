<L>__{interior study night}
<A>__{late at night in lucinnius's study, an oil lamp and a candle cast their shadowy light, adding to the tension in the room. hector stands beside lucinnius, who is counting out coins and other valuables on his table.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{eight hundred sesterces... cash ... that's all that's left... what a failure... my father left me three farms and forty thousand...}
<A>__{lucinnius places the money in a box on his table. he is quite drunk, resigned now to his fate. hector however is cold sober, grim faced. lucinnius looks up at him.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{nothing else to be done. don't you want some wine?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{no... but i want something...}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{what is it?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i want to die a free man... i don't want to die a slave...}
<A>__{lucinnius looks at him grimly and manages a smile. he clears his throat and attempts to put a note of ceremony into his voice.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{hector, by this proclamation, i make you a freed man... i don't know the exact words... i've never done it before... but you're free, hector.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{in writing... so that when they find me... they know i died a free man... please...}
<A>__{lucinnius looks at him for a moment, then reaches out for his paper and pen.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{very well...}
<A>__{he scratches out a few words on the paper, hector looking over his shoulder, keenly watching what he writes. lucinnius finishes writing and lays down the pen.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{they'll find it in the morning. it's a nice thought, hector... you were right to ask.}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{well... freed man, let's do it.}
<A>__{lucinnius picks up a large kitchen knife which lies on the table. he fingers its blade. a trickle of fear passes across hector's face. will the half drunk lucinnius want to kill him first?}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{what do you want me to do?}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{nothing... i mean, not to me... i have to do it first... you understand that... and then you... if i don't succeed... then you must help me...}
<C>__{hector}
<D>__{i understand.}
<C>__{lucinnius}
<D>__{no point in messing up the room. let's go downstairs.}
<A>__{lucinnius stands and leaves the room. hector follows with the oil lamp.}
