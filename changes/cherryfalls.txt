Stacy is stretched out between two trees, gagged, one hand nailed to each tree. She almost looks crucified. Rod, starts toward her, not sure what to do. He looks into Stacy's terrified eyes. She's looking behind him. Rod quickly turns around but he's too late. A knife comes plunging down toward Rod's chest. Stacy frantically tries to free herself but she only succeeds in ripping her palms on the nails. Rod falls to his knees, blood streaming from his chest and mouth. Stacy can't even react anymore, she's so horrified. The killer's hand rips open Stacy's shirt and feels her soft ripe stomach. Stacy looks down, terrified of what the killer has planned. A small but extremely sharp razor attached to the end of a pencil is placed up against Stacy's bare stomach. The killer's hand grips it like it's an ordinary pencil. Stacy's eyes grow abnormally wide as the carving starts. She's never experienced such pain. Blood drips to the ground. Dissolve to:}
