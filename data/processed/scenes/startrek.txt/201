<A>__{scotty pulls a tarp over much of the out of service shuttle.}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{she's a wee bit dodgy: shield emitters are totally banjaxed, along wi' a few other things.}
<A>__{spock finishes speed typing the field equations on the transporter control panel amazingly fast.}
<C>__{scotty }
<D>__{... rapid. that's impressive.}
<A>__{spock prime steps aside:}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{your equation for achieving trans warp beaming.}
<A>__{scotty looks at the equations we watch his expression run the gamut: from confused, to dumbfounded, to quiet awe and delight:}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{imagine that! never occurred to me to think of space as the part that's moving.}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{point of fact: it did occur to you.}
<P>__{(he works the console)}
<D>__{extrapolating enterprise's course }
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{ enterprise? had its maiden voyage already, has it? well, you must've done something right to be assigned to that ship, kiddo. she's a well endowed lady love to get my hands on her ample nacelles, if you'll pardon the engineering parlance.}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{now's your chance, mr. scott.}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{look, even if i believed you where you're from, what i've done which i don't we're still talkin' bout slingshotting aboard while she's going faster than light. without a proper receiving pad, that's like tryin'a hit a bullet with a smaller bullet, wearing a blindfold. on a horse.}
<C>__{spock}
<D>__{i calculate no more than a four meter margin of error.}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{that's all well and good unless you rematerialize four meters outside the ship.}
<A>__{as spock works the keyboard, an enterprise schematic rotates:}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{agreed: the aft engineering bay is your best option: a large space and no unpredictable airlocks }
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{ you're coming with us, right?}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{no, jim. my destiny lies along a different path.}
<C>__{kirk spock prime}
<A>__{your destiny can wait he (simply, strong) won't believe me, only you can under no circumstances can he explain w be made aware of my existence.}
<D>__{you must promise me this.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{you're telling me i can't tell you i'm following your own orders? why not? what happens?}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{trust me. above all. jim, this is the one rule you cannot break. to stop nero, you alone must take command of your ship.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{how, over your dead body?}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{preferably not. there is, however, starfleet regulation 619.}
<P>__{(off kirk's confusion)}
<D>__{yes. i forget what little regard you had for such things. 619 states that any commanding officer who is emotionally compromised by the mission at hand... must resign said command.}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{so i need to emotionally compromise you?}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{jim. i just lost my planet. i can tell you. i am emotionally compromised.}
<P>__{(then)}
<D>__{what you must do... is get me to show it.}
<A>__{pushing in on kirk as this lands for him }
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{hm.}
<C>__{scotty}
<D>__{aye, then. live or die, laddie, let's get this over with. he enterprise has a decent cafeteria i'm guessing.}
<A>__{scotty's on the pad. kirk follows, looks at spock:}
<C>__{kirk}
<D>__{you know... coming back in time... changing history... that's cheating.}
<C>__{spock prime}
<D>__{a trick i learned from an old friend.}
<A>__{something strikes kirk his eyes glint with revelation. spock responds enigmatically: a silent acknowledgment of what kirk must do to get the ship. he raises his hand in the legendary vulcan salute:}
<C>__{spock prime }
<D>__{live long, and prosper.}
<A>__{and spock activates the transporter and they dematerialize the light plays off his face as he watches them vanish }
