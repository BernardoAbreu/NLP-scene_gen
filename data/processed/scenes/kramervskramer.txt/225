<L>__{interior courtroom day}
<B>__{on ted kramer}
<A>__{sitting in the witness stand.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<D>__{mr. kramer, would you tell the court exactly why you want to retain custody of your child.}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(speaking quietly)}
<D>__{when joanna}
<P>__{(to the judge, correcting himself)}
<D>__{my ex wife when she was talking before about how unhappy she was during our marriage... well, i guess most of what she said was probably true. there were a lot of things i didn't understand a lot of things i would do different if i could. just like i guess there are a lot of things joanna wishes she could change... but we can't. some things, once they are done, can't be undone. joanna says she loves billy. i believe she does. so do i. but the way it was explained to me, that's not the issue. the only thing that's supposed to matter here is what's best for billy... when joanna said why shouldn't a woman have the same ambitions as a man, i suppose she's right. but by the same token what law is it that says a woman is a better parent simply by virtue of her sex? i guess i've had to think a lot about whatever it is that makes somebody a good parent: constancy, patience, understanding... love. where is it written that a man has any less of those qualities than a woman? billy has a home with me, i've tried to make it the best i could. it's not perfect. i'm not a perfect parent.}
<P>__{(unconsciously echoing}
<D>__{something joanna}
<P>__{said earlier)}
<D>__{i don't have enough patience. sometimes i forget he's just a little kid... but i love him... more than anything in this world i love him.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<D>__{thank you, mr. kramer. no further questions.}
<B>__{on gressen}
<A>__{as he gets up from the petitioner's table and crosses to the witness stand.}
<C>__{gressen}
<P>__{(hard lining it)}
<D>__{mr. kramer, by any chance have you ever had a woman in your bed while your child was asleep in the next room?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i suppose.}
<C>__{gressen}
<P>__{(pointedly)}
<D>__{so do i.}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<D>__{objection!}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{sustained.}
<C>__{gressen}
<P>__{(switching to another line of attack)}
<D>__{mr. kramer, isn't it true that you were fired from your last job not more than six weeks ago?}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(not losing his cool)}
<D>__{technically, the agency lost a big account and seventy four people were let go. i was one of them.}
<C>__{gressen}
<P>__{(snotty)}
<D>__{you were fired, correct?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{yes, but i'm with j. walter thompson now. i don't think that will happen again.}
<C>__{gressen}
<P>__{(snide)}
<D>__{give them time...}
<C>__{shaunessy}
<D>__{objection, your honor! counsel is harassing the witness.}
<C>__{gressen}
<P>__{(to the judge, pettish)}
<D>__{your honor, i'm only examining the man's employment record. he pretends to fitness when he cannot hold a job.}
<C>__{judge}
<D>__{sustained.}
<B>__{on gressen}
<A>__{he is thoughtful for a moment, like a man trying to decide whether or not to drop the bomb. then, turning back to ted:}
<C>__{gressen}
<P>__{(very tough)}
<D>__{mr. kramer, did your child nearly lose an eye when he was in your care?}
<B>__{reaction ted}
<A>__{stunned. he looks across at joanna.}
