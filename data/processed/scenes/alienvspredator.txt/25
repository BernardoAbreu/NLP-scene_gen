<L>__{interior whaling station mess hall}
<A>__{miller enters the frozen mess hall the same frozen mess hall that karl tried to flee from a hundred years ago. it's an eerie sight. like some kind of frozen doll house. the tables are covered with sheet ice. cups, plates, spoons and forks are frozen to the spot they were left since 1904. miller tries to pick up one of the cups but the handle breaks off into his hand.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{one for national geographic.}
<A>__{he takes out a camera, sets the timer. he rushes over to get in place but he's too slow and flash! the camera takes a picture of his back. the bold flash of light momentarily illuminates the mess hall. and this blast of light has disturbed something. there's movement.}
<C>__{miller }
<D>__{hello!}
<A>__{the movement stops. and now miller knows he's not alone.}
<C>__{miller }
<D>__{hello!}
<A>__{miller's voice echoes around the mess hall. there is no reply. miller turns, ready to go. then the sound stirs again. moving. scuttling across the floor. the sound of an alien face hugger getting closer? sheepish, miller recalls the toughest words he's ever heard.}
<C>__{miller }
<P>__{(a'la verheiden)}
<D>__{come out of there or... you'll be wearing your ass for a hat.}
<A>__{the movement stops. miller swallows hard. he's a chemical engineer after all easy prey. then the noise again. louder now. and it's getting closer. much closer. suddenly something grabs miller's shoulder.}
<C>__{miller }
<D>__{jesus!}
<C>__{lex }
<D>__{no one goes anywhere alone.}
<A>__{lex removes her hand. miller attempts calm. he fails.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{there's something in here.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{i doubt it.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{over there...}
<A>__{lex raises her flashlight, piercing the darkness.}
<C>__{miller }
<D>__{listen.}
<A>__{and now they both hear it. something is moving. now they both shine their flashlights into the darkness. and then it emerges from behind a table a terrifying, deadly...penguin.}
<C>__{miller }
<D>__{for god's sake ...}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{it's a penguin.}
<C>__{miller}
<D>__{i thought it might be...}
<A>__{no, he didn't. and lex knows it. miller stares at the penguin and the penguin stares back. inquisitive and unafraid.}
<C>__{lex}
<D>__{careful...}
<A>__{lex smiles at miller. he really is out of his depth.}
<C>__{lex }
<D>__{...they do bite.}
<A>__{there is shouting outside. and as lex walks away, miller takes the penguin's picture.}
