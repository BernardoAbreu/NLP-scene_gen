<A>__{as he reaches out to touch her...}
<B>__{boom. boom. boom. pounding on the door itself}
<A>__{peters screams. dj clutches her to him, backs away from the door. the pounding grows louder. louder. the door vibrates with each blow starck puts her hands over her ears. peters screams at the door.}
<C>__{peters}
<D>__{stop it! stop it!}
<A>__{but the pounding intensifies, metal groaning under incredible pressure.}
