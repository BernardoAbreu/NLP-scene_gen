<A>__{everything you've ever done's been leading up to this moment. put your ear to the door. hear that? it's the sound of possibilities. the din of greatness. walter turns the knob, brandon nearly tumbles through and }

<A>__{another world. a dozen salesmen work in a large room. phones ring. faxes churn. numbers are called out. a half dozen girls stroll the space, deliver betting and tip sheets.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{we use the 800 number and free tips to bait the hook. then the bettors are bounced to our sales staff. (stopping at the front desk, talking to a pretty brooklyn girl) you're looking lovely today, tammy. give it up baby, you know what i need. tammy smiles, hands walter a long list of names and numbers. walter studies the sheet as he walks brandon through the room.}
<C>__{walter}
<A>__{this is the day's phone sheet, it's a list of everyone who's called. only way to keep track of the action. all leads equal money. brandon's pov walking by salesmen doing their thing. the first is a chain smoker, battering ram tone. this is southie. southie did i not tell you that game was going over the total? now stop holding back and let's make some serious dough... what's our game plan this week? look, mr. mitch, collect from your bookie, wire our pitiful frigging share and then we'll discuss the goddamn game plan. the second man's herbie. slight. polite. soothing tone.}

<A>__{ it says here your minimum bet's five grand, so let's be honest now, can you move 50 large on this game or not?... i don't have time for this shit, jimmy. i know you're a loser, because if you were such a big winner you wouldn't have paid money to call me today. vegas is calling, i'm putting you on hold.
