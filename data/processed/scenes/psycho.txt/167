<A>__{there is quiet for a moment, then the door begins to open, and we see lila. she stands on the threshold, looking in at the room, instantly disturbed by it, almost chilled, her expression indicating an impulse to close the door and go away from this room forever. after a moment, she enters, leaving the door open behind her. camera pulls back and away and we now see the room as lila sees it. it is ornate, damask and mahogany, thick and warm and ripe, an olla podrida of mismated furnishings and bric a brac of the last century. the bed is four poster, but uncanoped; the dressing table is fancy and flounced with satin; there is a great chiffonier, a big doored wardrobe, a large, oval, full length pier glass (this against the wall directly opposite the door), a satin recamier, an upholstered armchair by the window, a white marble fireplace, its grate cold but piled with ashes. and there is in the room an unmistakably live quality, as if even though it is presently unoccupied, it has not been long vacated by some musty presence. lila glances at the bed. the damask coverlet is thrown over it, but it is not neat, there is the imprint of a body on it, a body which obviously has slept in a curled up, womb like position. lila stares at it for a moment, up, then goes to the dressing table. its top is scattered with boxes and jars of cosmetics and creams, traces of fresh powder, an opened bottle or perfume, a comb, and a brush with traces of hair in its bristles. lila moves on, catches a glimpse of herself in the pier glass, is startled, turns away, goes to the chiffonier, is about to open a drawer, sees the high wardrobe out of the corner of her eyes, goes to it, hesitantly. she opens one door. fresh, clean, well pressed dresses hang neatly. lila opens the other door. the sweaters and dresses and robes hang freely, none in moth proof, storage type bags. there is even a well brushed collar of foxes. along the floor of the wardrobe is a line of clean, polished shoes. lila stares, then closes the door, turns, looks once again over the whole room, starts out,}
