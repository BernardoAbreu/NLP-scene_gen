<A>__{kelly walks down the hall with his army issue backpack slung over one shoulder. besides a serious case of bedhead, he looks normal. no one says hi to him as he makes his way to his locker. as he twirls the combination and opens it, he notices lance short and wide, built like a tank, prematurely balding, and his girlfriend bridget embracing a few lockers down. they kiss raunchily, their tongues darting in and out of each other's mouths. lance sees kelly looking and stops kissing.}

<D>__{that's pretty funny. you got dental insurance?}
<A>__{kelly closes his locker and walks away. bridget wipes her mouth guiltily. lance shakes his head and pulls bridget to him, grinding his pelvis against hers.}
