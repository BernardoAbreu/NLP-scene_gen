<L>__{exterior school afternoon}
<A>__{christine waits outside the school as another bell rings, announcing the end of classes. kids run outside, walter among them. he folds in alongside as they start down the sidewalk.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{hey, sport.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{hey, mom.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{so how was school?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{okay. we learned about dinosaurs, and i got in a fight with billy mankowski.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{what happened?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{he hit me.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{did you hit him back?}
<P>__{(he nods)}
<D>__{good. rule number one: never start a fight, but always finish it. so why did he hit you?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{because i hit him.}
<A>__{she stops, looks at him.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{wait...you hit him first?}
<P>__{(he nods)}
<D>__{why?}
<A>__{changeling a true story}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{he said my dad ran off because he didn't like me.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{your dad never even had a chance to meet you...so how could he not like you?}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{then why did he leave?}
<A>__{christine takes his hand, and they continue down the sidewalk.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{well, the same day you were born, something else arrived. it came in the mail, in a box just slightly bigger than you. you know what was in that box?}
<P>__{(he shakes head)}
<D>__{something called responsibility. now, to some people, responsibility is fun, it's what you live your whole life for. other people think it's the scariest thing in the world.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{so he ran away because he was scared of what was in the box?}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{yup.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{that's dumb.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{that's what i thought.}
<A>__{she turns and crouches down in front of him.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{walter, i decided a long time ago that i would always tell you the truth, that i would treat you like a grown up. i can't expect you to respect me unless i respect you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i've never lied to you. your father leaving had nothing to do with you, and everything to do with what was in the responsibility box.}
<C>__{walter}
<D>__{pinky swear?}
<A>__{changeling a true story}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{pinky swear.}
<A>__{she takes his pinky in hers, gives a tug. he smiles.}
<C>__{christine}
<D>__{first one to the corner store gets ice cream!}
<A>__{he laughs and tears off. she runs after him, letting him stay ahead of her the whole way.}
