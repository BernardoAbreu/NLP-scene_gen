<A>__{as if intruding, asakawa walks slowly, cautiously into tomokos room. the window to the room is open, and a single piece of folded white paper on tomokos desk flutters in the breeze. asakawa walks towards it, picks it up. it is a receipt from a photo shop. the developed photos have yet to be claimed. asakawa senses something, spins to look over her shoulder. her sister has crept quietly up the stairs and down the hall, and stands now in the doorway to tomokos room. she appears not to notice what asakawa has in her hands, as her gaze has already shifted to the sliding closet door. she regards it almost druggedly.}

<A>__{ryomis hands fling aside the closet door. within, she finds the pale blue carcass of her daughter, curled up into an unnatural fetal position. tomokos mouth yawns gaping, her eyes glassy and rolled up into the back of her head. her hands are caught in her hair, as if trying to pull it out by the roots. it is a horrific scene, one that says tomoko died as if from some unspeakable fear.}
