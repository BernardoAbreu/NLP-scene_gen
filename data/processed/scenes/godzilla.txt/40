<A>__{nick sits on the floor surrounded by his sloppily unpacked equipment as he places the slide under his microscope, examining his specimen. quickly stepping over him a young soldier rushes over to major hicks, seated with the rest of the team on the plane's opposing benches. the solider interrupts their discussion.}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{major, we just got a report of a fishing trawler going down. exact position, forty seven degrees latitude, 67 longitude.}
<C>__{major hicks}
<D>__{what makes you think it's related?}
<C>__{soldier}
<D>__{the trawler was pulled under.}
<A>__{the team exchanges worried glances. hicks moves over to a map where the other incidents have been marked. he traces his finger up the 67th longitude until he hits the 47th parallel. just off the east coast.}
<C>__{major hicks}
<D>__{jesus christ! it's only two hundred miles off the american eastern seaboard and we don't even know what it is.}
<C>__{elsie}
<A>__{theropoda allosaurus . some type of}

<D>__{so where's been hiding the last}
<A>__{sixty million years ?}
<C>__{elsie}
<D>__{the depth and breath of the ocean floor has barely been explored. his kind could have survived there completely undetected.}
<C>__{nick }
<D>__{what about the traces of radiation?}
<A>__{everyone turns to discover nick has walked over holding his loosely scribbled notes in his hand.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{the radiation is not an anomaly, it's the}
<A>__{clue . this creature is far too}
<D>__{unique on every level to be some lost dinosaur.}
<C>__{major hicks}
<D>__{don't tell me why it's not, tell me what the hell it is.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{what do we know? it was first sighted off the french polynesian pacific. an area that has been exposed to dozens of nuclear tests over the last thirty years.}
<C>__{elsie}
<D>__{hence the radiation.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{more than that. i believe this is a mutated aberration, a hybrid from the fall out in that region.}
<C>__{clive}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{like your earthworms?}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{yes! we're looking at a completely incipient creature. the dawn of a new species. the first of its kind.}
