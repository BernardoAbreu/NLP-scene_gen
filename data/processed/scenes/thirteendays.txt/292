<L>__{interior west wing hallway day}
<A>__{kenny rounds a corner. mcnamara, bundy and mccone are talking, excited, hushed, standing to one side, down the hall. kenny eyes them as he draws closer, and then they notice he's approaching. bundy nods him over, confidential.}
<C>__{bundy}
<D>__{we've been talking. we can play this big in '64. it's the foreign policy trophy we've been waiting.}
<A>__{kenny sickens. he tries to listen, but it all begins to blur.}
<C>__{bundy }
<D>__{i think we can ride it all the way home next election. bet you're way ahead of us, eh?}
<A>__{bundy slaps kenny on the back. kenny is pale. is what they're saying possible? but bundy and mccone are too wrapped up in their schemes to notice kenny's distress.}
<C>__{mccone}
<D>__{we've ordered crash reassessment of our major geopolitical hotspots. we've got a lot of new clout, and we can run the table on the soviets. middle east, southeast asia...}
<A>__{and kenny, sad, moved beyond all pity and loathing, realizes it is possible. they haven't gotten it. he is speechless, helplessly shaking his head. bundy finally sees something isn't right with him.}
<C>__{mcnamara}
<D>__{what's wrong, o'donnell?}
<A>__{kenny can't speak. can't find the words. but tongue tied finally manages:}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{don't you understand?}
<A>__{mcnamara and bundy look at him funny.}
<C>__{bundy}
<D>__{understand what?}
<A>__{kenny just looks at them, eyes filled with sorrow. they begin to feel uncomfortable.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{the sun came up today.}
<C>__{bundy}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{it shouldn't have. but it did.}
<C>__{mccone}
<D>__{we were lucky we were able to keep it under control.}
<A>__{kenny looks away, unable to bear it.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{every day the sun comes up... says something about us.}
<C>__{bundy}
<D>__{says what, kenny?}
<A>__{kenny looks back at them.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{something... amazing.}
<A>__{they just stare at him. and with secret smiles, superior smiles, they nod.}
<C>__{mcnamara}
<D>__{sure, ken. i understand. feels good to win, doesn't it?}
<A>__{but they don't understand, and together turn away.}
<C>__{bundy}
<D>__{see you later, kenny.}
<A>__{kenny watches them, heads bowed in discussion, disappear into the labyrinth of the west wing. kenny turns his back on them.}
<D>__{interior president's bedroom day}
<A>__{the president stands at his mirror, tying a bow tie to a tux for some sunday special event. kenny gathers up his folder from nearby breakfast table. kenny meets the president's gaze in the mirror, and the two men know they have been to the same mountaintop.}
<C>__{the president}
<D>__{kenny...}
<A>__{a beat. kenny stands straight, ready for action, ready for some necessary thing. ready to go back into the game.}
<C>__{the president }
<D>__{...never mind. see you around, kenny.}
<A>__{kenny starts to leave, but at the door, turns back.}
<C>__{kenny}
<D>__{you know...}
<A>__{the president looks at him in the mirror.}
<C>__{kenny }
<D>__{...this was what we're here for.}
<A>__{the president smiles an ever so faint smile. kenny turns and leaves the room, vanishing, and as we hold on the empty doorway, the simple, whistled melody of o'donnell aboo drifts from the hallway beyond, becoming our end music.}
