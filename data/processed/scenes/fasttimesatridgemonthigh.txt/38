<L>__{exterior hamilton house later that night}
<A>__{we see the hamilton's cul de sac home. all the lights are off in the house at this hour. except for brad's room.}
<L>__{interior brad's room}
<A>__{brad is alone in his room. he's prone on his neatly made bed, reading a paperback book entitled power with class. on the wall of brad's room is a large framed photo of a carl's jr. hamburger. brad hears a muffled knock at his door.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{come on in.}
<A>__{stacy walks into brad's room.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{thanks for getting rid of those flowers.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{don't worry about it. who sent the flowers?}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{it's just some guy i met at swenson's. you don't know him.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{i don't care it you tell me or not. i got problems of my own.}
<A>__{he begins pacing.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{is everything okay at work?}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{are you kidding? work is great. i kill at work. i don't even mind mom and dad making me pay rent.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{you're going to break up with lisa, aren't you?}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{i've been doing some thinking. it's my last school year. i'm a single, successful guy. i think i want my freedom.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{why? because she won't sleep with you?}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{where did you hear that?}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{i'm just guessing.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{well... it's true.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{maybe you just need to give her some time. she's so nice, brad. everybody loves lisa.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{everybody loves lisa. everybody loves lisa. but everybody doesn't have to be her boyfriend.}
<A>__{suddenly, stacy pops the question.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{hey, brad. are you still a virgin?}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{i don't know. i was just curious.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{maybe yes. maybe no.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{you are a virgin!}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{i didn't say that.}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{but your face did!}
<A>__{they laugh. then brad turns serious.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{are you still a virgin?}
<C>__{stacy}
<D>__{maybe yes. maybe no.}
<C>__{brad}
<D>__{don't give me that shit! i know you're still a virgin!}
<A>__{stacy smiles and stands up. she playfully slaps her brother on the arm and walks down the hallway to her room. we can see there is less frill and lace in stacy's room. the junior high paperbacks are gone. there are no dolls in sight.}
