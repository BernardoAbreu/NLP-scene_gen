<A>__{snow drifts down from a leaden sky as the mourners stand together on a steep hillside of tilted, weather worn headstones. the mill looms behind them, breathing roiling clouds of steam and uttering a dull concordia of clanks and groans.}
<L>__{exterior cemetery grave site day}
<A>__{the priest completes his reading of the 23rd psalm. the mourners join in the lord's prayer. camera closes on nick, vince, albert, john and sal. they help sal to the side of the grave. it is awkward. the chair gets stuck and they have to carry it. they all pick up a handful of dirt and then, following nick's lead, they throw it in. nick steps back from the grave, nods to the vets. the vets come to attention. the vet with the bugle steps forward and tremblingly, but perfectly, plays taps.}
