<L>__{exterior near a ford. day}
<A>__{inman way ahead, full of purpose. veasey still has the saw, trots to catch up.}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{why you in such a hurry the whole time?}
<P>__{(no answer)}
<D>__{hurry or slow the destination is always the same. it's only the journey that is different. that's either in the good book or i made it up.}
<A>__{inman suddenly stops, scowling, puts up a hand, listens. inman carefully scouts the track then, with great caution, edges towards the river bank. a heavy set man labours in the water. he's contemplating the huge black carcass of a bull which has slipped into the ford and died. the man is wet and exasperated.}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{good day to you!}
<A>__{the man turns, his spirit evidently lifted by the prospect of help. his name is junior. he's working on roping the animal.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{my old bull, wandered off and died in this here creek. fouled up our water is how i found it.}
<A>__{veasey is immediately an authority on bull removal.}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{this is a tricky one.}
<A>__{the three men contemplate the carcass, swatting away the swarms of flies. junior offers a swig from a jug of liquor. inman refuses, veasey takes a long pull, shudders happily.}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{the name for the bull's member is a tassel. i learned that and never forgot it.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{reckon i need a train of mules.}
<C>__{veasey}
<P>__{(walking away)}
<D>__{i'm getting an idea. my saw is the remedy. let's saw up some wood and make levers.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{then what?}
<C>__{veasey}
<D>__{lever him out. this'll work!}
<A>__{he walks into the wood.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{where you two sports heading?}
<C>__{inman}
<P>__{(inscrutable)}
<D>__{i don't know where he's heading. i'm going down the road. and i got a good way to go before nightfall.}
<C>__{junior}
<P>__{(acknowledging his attitude)}
<D>__{charitable of you to make a stop. ain't for me to be curious.}
<C>__{veasey}
<P>__{(emerges from the woods)}
<D>__{how do you work this damn thing?}
<C>__{inman}
<P>__{(to veasey)}
<D>__{give me that saw.}
<P>__{(to junior)}
<D>__{come on.}
<A>__{he takes the saw, walks to the bull, gets on one side, indicates junior should go to the other.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{let's do this in chapters.}
<A>__{and they begin to saw off the bull's neck. later, and they're in a vile stew of blood and innards. the stomach opens and its contents gush into the creek. veasey is disgusted, draws back. the two other men haul up the rest of the animal onto the banks. they're exhausted.}
<C>__{inman}
<D>__{you might want to leave off that water for a day or two.}
<C>__{junior}
<D>__{there'll be a tang, i'd imagine.}
