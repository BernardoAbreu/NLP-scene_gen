<A>__{storm back in bed. a knot of doctors finishes returning him from their emergency resuscitation work. "we'll leave him here for tonight, where they've got the full support setup." the team wraps up and begins to move off. the team leader instructs andy in storm's immediate condition and care.}
<C>__{doctor }
<D>__{ clip him with 50 cc of thorazine if he gives you any trouble. i'm afraid he's very disoriented and quite paranoid. he thinks people are trying to kill him.}
<A>__{the team exits. andy is alone in the ward with the immobile patients and storm. storm groans and tries to lift himself onto an elbow.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{miss ... please ... they won't tell me ... think i'm too disorient }
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{this is u.c.i. medical center. you've been in a coma. your charts go back for seven years.}
<C>__{storm}
<P>__{(staggered)}
<D>__{seven... years?}
<A>__{he can't absorb this. it's too much. his mind reels.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{who ... who knows i'm awake?}
<C>__{andy}
<P>__{(innocent enthusiasm)}
<D>__{it's all over the hospital. you're the first one that's come out of a coma of this duration. you'll probably be on the news!}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you'll be famous!}
<C>__{storm}
<P>__{(struggles to sit up; fails)}
<D>__{listen to me carefully }
<P>__{(reads her name tag)}
<D>__{ andy. i don't have the strength to talk much. i'm a cop. my wife ... family ... murdered. that's how i got here. if you don't get me out ... you and i ... good chance ... both be dead.}
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{please you're in no danger here.}
<A>__{she touches him kindly but storm sees that she doesn't believe him, thinks he's paranoid.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{goddamit }
<P>__{(urgent but weak)}
<D>__{can't stay here. listen to me }
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{i will have one of the aides take you down the hall for hydrotherapy. it'll help you relax.}
<C>__{storm}
<D>__{no }
<C>__{andy}
<D>__{listen... i've got work to do. you're my cutest patient, but you're not my only one.}
<A>__{she leaves. storm blows a sigh of frustration. his body won't do what his brain tells it! in half paralyzed rage he struggles to move his limbs, open and close his hands }
