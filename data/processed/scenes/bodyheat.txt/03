<C>__{judge costanza }
<D>__{ever actually en route from indiana or not. i think we're wasting our time here. it's pretty clear your client has attempted to defraud the county in a not very ingenious manner.}
<P>__{(he nods at lowenstein)}

<C>__{racine}
<D>__{judge costanza, perhaps when i've presented all }
<C>__{judge costanza}

<C>__{racine}
<D>__{you would look favorably on that?}
<C>__{judge costanza}
<P>__{(nods)}

<C>__{judge costanza}
<D>__{mr. racine. next time you come into my courtroom i hope you've got either a better defense or a better class of client.}

<C>__{racine}
<D>__{thank you, your honor.}
<A>__{racine goes back to his client, a businessman of enormous confidence and extravagantly untrustworthy appearance.}
