<A>__{john relaxes, stops fighting the inevitable. satan takes his hand, starts to pull him home but suddenly finds himself pulling on what seems to be infinite mass. try as he might, he can't budge john an inch. and now john's other hand leaves his side, and as if weightless, begins to rise toward something above. no sense in beating around the bush here, john is in the embrace of god. satan sees this and recoils in absolute rage }

<D>__{the sacrifice!! no!!!! this one belongs to me!!}
<A>__{john's rising hand drifts back down in front of satan, the middle finger fully extended. final straw. satan goes rabid turns to pure energy for a split second. his hands remain on fire.}

<D>__{you will live, john constantine, you will live so you'll have the chance to prove that your soul truly belongs in hell. you will live!}
<A>__{satan eagerly plunges his blazing hands into john's body john screams in agony. satan tears through his tissue collecting the cancer, then ripping out a mass of diseased tissue with one vengeful pull. john's final blood curdling scream echoes over }
