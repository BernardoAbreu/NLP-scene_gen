<L>__{129 rue caton 4. fathia's house. inside. night. september 2.}
<A>__{rue caton number four. it is 11 p.m. a large, badly lit room is filled with paratroopers and one of them is now being carried away on a stretcher. another three or four wounded are seated on the opposite side of the room and are waiting their turn to be carried away. two paras are by the door. they look out from time to time, and are attentive, ready, with machine guns clutched by their sides. on the other side of the room opposite the door, the algerians who live in the house are standing against the wall. mathieu is in front of them, and he is asking a group of women:}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{which one of you is fathia?}
<A>__{a woman about forty years old raises her eyes toward him.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{is it you?}
<A>__{the woman nods yes.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{go up the stairs, and tell kader that if they don't surrender, we'll blow up everything ... do you understand?}
<A>__{the woman again nods yes, and without waiting for more words, she moves toward the door, taciturn, silent. mathieu follows her, he pushes past her.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{try to convince him, if you care about your house ... wait a minute ... do you want to get killed?}
<A>__{he leans out the door and says loudly:}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{kader, look. fathia is coming ... i wouldn't shoot ...}
<A>__{then he steps aside and lets the woman pass.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{go on ...}
<A>__{outside the door, there is a small landing, then a steep stairway, and at the top, a corridor. fathia climbs the stairs that are cluttered with empty magazines, with cartridge boxes. the walls are chipped from the shooting. the ceiling is parallel to the stairway at the same inclination, for part of its distance. but for the last few yards, it straightens out and lowers to become horizontal. the floor of the hiding place is open. inside are zohra and kader. fathia repeats to them in arabic what mathieu has said to her. kader listens to her then answers, he too in arabic. then he smiles.}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{okay ... you can tell the colonel to blow up whatever he likes. go on, now.}
<A>__{fathia goes down the stairs, and reenters the room.}
<C>__{fathia}
<P>__{(to mathieu)}
<D>__{he said that you can blow up whatever you like ...}
<A>__{she, then, rejoins the other women. mathieu seems to be tired, he has lost weight, he is nervous. he turns to his men, and slowly as he gives the orders, the paras begin to move.}
<C>__{mathieu}
<D>__{return to where the others are. prepare the plastic. it should be placed on the ceiling of the stairway under the hiding place ... a long fuse rolled up ... take cover ... keep shooting while you are working. quickly! clear the house ... bring them outside, then check the rooms again ... hurry up!}
<A>__{kader gives zohra a box of matches. she goes to the back of the hiding place where there is a bundle of papers. she lights them, then returns near to kader who is inspecting the magazine of his machine gun. there are only two shots left. the other empty magazines are scattered around. kader turns to zohra, and starts to speak, but suddenly his words are blurred by the sound of shots. kader and zohra have to step back a little, because the shells are flashing at the edge of the opening. the shooting stops. from the stairway, one end of a long fuse is thrown into the corridor. the other end is inserted into a plastic charge fastened to the ceiling of the stairway, under the hiding place. kader and zohra can see two or three yards in front of them, below, into the corridor, where the end of the fuse is glowing and burning. kader too has lost weight, his beard is long. he looks at the fuse, then at zohra. a second passes in silence. now zohra too looks at him, and kader says calmly in his usual voice:}
<C>__{kader}
<D>__{it doesn't do any good to die like this ... it doesn't help anybody ...}
<A>__{he leans out from the hiding place.}
<C>__{kader}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{mathieu! if you give your word that you won't touch any of the other people in the house, we'll come out.}
