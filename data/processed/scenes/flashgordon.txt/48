<L>__{interior ming's dome}
<A>__{(ming, zarkov) open at the top to space. but instead of our familiar pinpoint stars, here whole nebulae wheel in majesty against infinity, their innards popping with explosions as whole galaxies are born and die. zarkov stands before ming in chains, mesmerized by fantastic devices on every side. most prominent is a huge transparent cube, supported in the air above a control console. ming moves to that, plays in it like an organist. we hear a soft intense hum, glimpse great dish like radio antennae turning on the top side of the dome. an astonishing things happens. inside the cube a recognisable greenish globe appears like a three dimensional holograph, slowly turning as the continents and oceans come into view below a veil of clouds.}

<D>__{earth!}
<C>__{ming}
<D>__{yes, zarkov as it was. now as it will be, when my plasma reaches full force.....}
<A>__{a sudden tide of fire sweeps the globe, even the clouds burn. zarkov gasps as ming's fingers dance of the control keys again.}
<C>__{ming }
<D>__{and as it will be in yet another time, long after you have died. earth reborn! a pleasant image, no?}
<A>__{the fires recede. the hanging globe sparkles again with beauty just as it was except that the outlines of our continents have been subtly changed.}
<C>__{zarkov}

<C>__{ming}
<D>__{of course i can create life. there's nothing easier. it only requires myself and one woman.}

<C>__{ming}
<D>__{who else? as in that childish myth of yours adam and eve, wasn't it? i will breed with her and repopulate the earth in my own image. i've already done it on over a thousand planets.}
<A>__{ming touches a key. the image of earth disappears from the cube. zarkov glares hatred at ming for a beat, then his eye catches something else.}
<B>__{what he sees}
<A>__{a big block of crystal on the floor with two swords embedded in it, just their hilts sticking out. angle to include zarkov. chained as he is, he suddenly bounds over and seizes a sword hilt, tries to pull it out. it doesn't budge.}
<C>__{ming }
<D>__{the magic blades are not for your kind, zarkov. one is my own the other will only be withdrawn by my rightful heir. pull on them with all your}
