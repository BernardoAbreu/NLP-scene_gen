<L>__{exterior hitchcock house, pool day}
<A>__{as alma plunges into the water wearing her striking new swimsuit. she breaks into a front crawl. her strokes are vigorous, surprisingly so. she drives the length of the pool, her arms slashing through the water with increasing speed, her feet kicking out with rising intensity... harder and harder... faster and faster...}
<L>__{interior soundstage, universal revue day}
<A>__{hitch guides janet and tony across the sound stage to the set of norman's parlor.}
<C>__{anthony perkins}
<D>__{now, hitch, explain to me why i'm watching marion undress?}
<C>__{janet leigh}
<D>__{i feel like i should take offense at that.}
<A>__{she and tony laugh. hitch's eyes light up at this display of mischief from her.}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{i don't know...perhaps as a boy, norman secretly watched his mother preparing for her nightly bath.}
<C>__{janet leigh}
<D>__{maybe there was a transom over the bathroom door?}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{yes one he could access with a chair so long as he was stealthy.}
<C>__{janet leigh}
<D>__{well, a boy's first glimpse of a naked woman is usually his mother.}
<C>__{anthony perkins}
<D>__{so...i'm reliving the past, repeating a ritual with marion?}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{you're the actor. you figure it out.}
<A>__{tony flinches at hitch's brusque response. they arrive at the set wall, where hitch removes a painting to reveal the peephole.}
<C>__{janet leigh}
<D>__{hitch, i have a question. why is the hole much larger on this side?}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{all the better to see you at the greatest possible angle my dear...}
<A>__{janet simply steps up and presses her face to the hole. hitch studies her profile, quietly thrilled at her curiosity. tony hangs back, watching hitch watching her...}
<C>__{janet leigh}
<D>__{wow. you really do your research, don't you?}
<C>__{alfred hitchcock}
<D>__{it's just my jesuit work ethic.}
<A>__{he takes a quick peek through the hole now too...then puts the painting carefully back into place over it.}
<D>__{alfred hitchcock (pre lap) (cont'd) the truth is... i'm only happy when i'm working...}
