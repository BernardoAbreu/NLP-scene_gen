<L>__{interior george's garage night}
<A>__{sam is on the pull out bed, listening to music through head phones. we hear a flush, the armoire doors open and george walks out of the cabinet, washes his hands, turns off the light and drops into bed. a nightlight stuck in a socket above the bed casts a dull blue light over the room. sam takes the headphones off. after a long silence:}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i took some of your vicodin.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i know.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i like how it feels not to feel.}
<A>__{george turns onto his side to face his son.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i know the feeling.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{how do you become something you're not?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what would you like to be?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what i'm not.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what are you now?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{nothing.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{that's not true.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{see, that's the thing...i am what i say i am.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i know parts of who you are.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what do you know about me?}
<A>__{george drops back onto his back. he takes his time to answer.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{when you started first grade and your mom went to work, it was so she could save for an apartment. but then she met peter and skipped the idea of renting.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{he's got nothing to do with me.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i couldn't imagine how i could compete with him for any part of you. so, i didn't. he wanted you to have his last name...i let him even take that.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{he was a prick when i was six, and he's a prick today.}
<A>__{george turns onto his side to face sam again.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i wish you had told me then.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'm telling you now.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i gave up on you.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i'd be in tahoe having fun if you had given up.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{what would you be doing now?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{getting high, i guess.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{if i asked you to stop, would you?}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i haven't used anything for two days. i'm trying.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i'm proud of you, sam.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{don't be. and hide whatever that new drug is you have. i like it.}
<A>__{sam turns away from his father and puts his headphones on. the music bleeds through the headphones in a muffled rumble.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i put a gun to my father's head once.}
<A>__{george's voice is soft there's no chance sam can hear.}
<C>__{george }
<D>__{have you ever thought like that? i've been thinking...watching you work. how much do you hate me?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{he was passed out. just screaming at my mother before. about nothing. under cooked meat. i went back to my room... put the barrel close to his ear and chickened out again. not my dad. hid in my room. not even me.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{of course it was a bb gun. but it still would have hurt like hell.}
<A>__{sam notices his father's mouth moving and takes off the headphones.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{are you talking?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i was just thinking about my mom. she wouldn't leave him. i remember one time she made us dinner wearing sunglasses. i mean it was dark outside and in. but we never talked about it.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{sun glasses?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{to hide a black eye.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{why wouldn't she leave?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i think she was terrified of living with him...but maybe even more terrified of life without him.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{i would have killed him.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{everything would have been better if you had. you'd have liked your grandmother. and there'd be a girl out there that'd have her mother. i remember reading about her in the paper. they couldn't find her father and her mother was dead. i still feel guilty about that.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{do you ever wish you had done it?}
<A>__{george thinks about that for a second.}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{i loved him too much.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{after everything he did to you and your mom?}
<C>__{george}
<D>__{after everything.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{that's so weird...}
<A>__{sam slips his headphones back on. george nods...it is.}
