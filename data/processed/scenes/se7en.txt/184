<A>__{water roars. a square pool of water churns. a moment, then mills rises, gasping, choking. he's disoriented, furious, waving his gun, expecting doe to be right on top of him. no one around. mills looks. this is some sort of unmanned water switching station. the walls are covered in catwalks, drainage pipes and tunnels. some tunnels and pipes spew water down into the central pool, others are sealed shut. mills pulls himself from the central pool to a concrete spillway. he stands up, searching. doe could be anywhere.}
