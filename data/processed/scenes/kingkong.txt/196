<A>__{wide on: kong steps out of a large round cave onto a ledge that juts out high over skull island ... this is kong's lair ... over the ledge is a dizzying drop of at least 1000 feet down to the jungle. the "venture" can be seen moored off the tip of the island, some three miles away. ngle on: kong gently places ann on the ground ... ann watches as he moves away and sits to one side of the ledge. the sky is a fiery orange as the sun goes down ... silhouetting the figure of kong ... close on: ann looks around the cave taking in her strange surroundings ... her eyes fall upon a huge gorilla skull and skeleton which lie within the recesses of the cave ... ann turns and looks back at kong ... realizing these are the bones of his forebears ... that kong was not always alone. sudden flutter in the dark recesses of the lair, a sinister sound, sends ann scurrying towards kong ... ong won't look at her. ann breaks into a few tap steps ... no response. she leans down and picks up some stones ... juggling them, attempting to amuse him as she did before. kong's gaze remains averted ... he looks out over the jungle canopy. ann follows his gaze, taking in the rugged landscape which is bathed in the last evening rays of the sun. she stares out to sea, a rain cloud casts shadows over the ocean.}
