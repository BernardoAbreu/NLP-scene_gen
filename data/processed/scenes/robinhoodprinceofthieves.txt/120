<A>__{sweating, fearful, the bishop rushes through the service.}
<C>__{bishop}
<D>__{...your bodies to be bound in immortal wedlock. do you, marian dubois, take...}
<A>__{the chapel doors shatter inward. robin backs in, bloodied, fencing with four remaining soldiers. he smashes one by swinging the heavy door into him, hurtles a pew at another. he springs off another pew, taking down a third.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{marian, run! it's me, robin. run!}
<A>__{marian remains immobile. mortianna moves to her side. robin is struck in the thigh. like a vulture, the sheriff waits. tiring, blood pouring from his leg, robin prepares to fight him.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i warned you, i would find you no matter what.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{no companions? no army? you rush to your death for the sake of a woman. lust has turned you into a fool... recognize this, locksley?}
<A>__{he raises his sword to reveal its handle. a crucifix sculpted into the hilt... robin's father's sword.}
<C>__{nottingham}
<D>__{appropriate i should use it to kill you with, don't you think?}
<A>__{he lunges. a savage, accomplished swordsman, with fire in his eyes. exhausted, robin is driven back, parrying desperately.}
