<L>__{interior nicholas andre's study night}
<A>__{nicholas andre is pacing around the room with a cordless phone. he's in his late 30s, wears a ponytail, and dresses in aspen rodeo drive chic.}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{what in hell are those guys up to? is it possible that they're feds?}
<L>__{intercut conversation:}
<C>__{mental}
<D>__{unlikely from what i've seen.}
<A>__{the anxious man taps on the phone booth and motions for mental to hang up.}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{i don't like this one goddamn bit, mental. you and shay were supposed to grab that bag so we could end this shit. now i don't know what the hell's going on.}
<A>__{andre sighs and wipes some perspiration from his upper lip. the anxious man knocks on the booth again.}
<C>__{mental}
<D>__{hold on a second, mr. andre...}
<A>__{mental puts the phone down and motions the anxious man closer to the booth. the man moves forward a few inches. mental motions him even closer. when he's about a foot away, mental punches his hand through the glass of the booth and knocks the anxious man out cold. then mental picks up the phone again.}
<C>__{mental }
<D>__{sorry, boss. you were saying...?}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{look, mental, just find out what they're up to. i want to know who these guys are.}
<C>__{mental}
<D>__{don't worry. i'm on it.}
<A>__{mental hangs up the phone, looks around to make sure he's not being watched, then approaches the parked mutt cutt van. he's joined by j.p. shay. as they get within five feet of the vehicle, we hear a low growl. they stop in their tracks and turn, expecting to see a dog but there isn't one. they both take another step forward, and the growl gets louder and meaner. again, mental and shay stop. he peeks under the car. nothing.}
<C>__{shay}
<D>__{what the fuck...?}
<A>__{finally, shay reaches for the door handle. as soon as he touches it, though, the car alarm goes off but instead of a siren, it's the incredibly annoying sound of a poodle yapping. mental jumps back and pulls his gun.}
<C>__{mental}
<D>__{where's the goddamn dog?}
<A>__{shay shrugs, nervous. the yapping grows even louder now, forcing a flustered shay and mental to retreat from the scene.}
