<A>__{an electric bobcat like bulldozer maneuvers a very high tech looking clear container to the edge of the earthen hole. the container has monitors and gauges on it, oxygen tanks and what looks like a circulation refrigeration unit. a self contained life support system. the inside of the container is covered with a thin layer of frost. when the small bulldozer gets the container over near the hole, several technicians lift it down off the shovel, hand carrying it toward the hole opening. as dr. bronschweig appears, moving to a ladder that leads down into the hole. he's dressed in a haz mat suit, with the hood off.}
