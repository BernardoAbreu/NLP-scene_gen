<L>__{interior doctor spivey's office day}
<A>__{doctor spivey is seated behind his desk, on which are several glass framed photos of spivey's family, plus a nameplate: john m. spivey, m.d., and mcmurphy's papers. mcmurphy, freshly showered and wearing hospital issue clothes, sits facing him.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{hell, doc, i've been everything from a hoopla man with a two bit carny show to a top mechanic and bull goose catskinner for every gypo loggin' operation in the northwest till the army taught me what my natural bent was.}
<C>__{spivey}
<D>__{oh, what was that?}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{poker!}
<C>__{spivey}
<D>__{i see.}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{yeah, but you know how society persecutes a dedicated man.}
<C>__{spivey }
<D>__{in what way?}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{they say i'm a habitual hassler. like i fight some. sheeut. they didn't mind so much when i was a dumb logger and got into a hassle. that's a hardworkin' feller blowing off steam, they say. but if you're a gambler, all you have to do is spit slantwise and you're a goddamned criminal.}
<C>__{spivey}
<D>__{i see...}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{to tell the truth, ever since i found my natural callin' i done time in so many small time jails i could write a brochure...}
<C>__{spivey}
<D>__{yes... ah, do you know why you're here?}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{well, ya know, doc...}
<P>__{(indicating his papers)}
<D>__{doesn't it say so there?}
<C>__{spivey}
<P>__{(looking over papers)}
<D>__{well, according to the warden at pendleton, you were a disturbing influence on others. 'it appears that there is a potential in him for instigating a revolt among the other inmates.'}
<P>__{(looking up at mcmurphy)}
<D>__{what do you think of that report?}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{i don't, doc...}
<C>__{spivey}
<P>__{(goes back to papers)}
<D>__{arrested on an assault charge five times...}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{that's correct, doc ...}
<C>__{spivey}
<P>__{(reading from folder)}
<D>__{the doctor at the prison states: 'don't overlook the possibility that this man may be faking psychosis to escape the drudgery of the work farm...' what do you say to that?}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{doc, what can i tell ya?}
<C>__{spivey}
<D>__{ah, it seems you have no other psychiatric history, mister murphy?}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
<D>__{no, this is my first trip, doc.}
<C>__{spivey}
<P>__{(closes folder and sits back)}
<D>__{well, you're here for a ninety day observation period, mister mcmurphy. i'd like you to understand you are here on a court order and we are responsible to the state. so, i'd like your cooperation!}
<C>__{mcmurphy}
