<A>__{the speaker, cobb, is 35, handsome, tailored. a young japanese man, saito, eats as he listens.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{a bacteria? a virus?}
<A>__{cobb gestures at their feast with his wine glass }
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{an intestinal worm?}
<A>__{saito's fork pauses, mid air. cobb grins. a third man is at the table arthur. he jumps in to save the pitch }
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{what mr. cobb is trying to say }
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{an idea.}
<A>__{saito looks at cobb, curious.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{resilient, highly contagious. once an idea's taken hold in the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate. a person can cover it up, ignore it but it stays there.}
<C>__{saito}
<D>__{but surely to forget...?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{information, yes. but an idea? fully formed, understood? that sticks...}
<P>__{(taps forehead)}
<D>__{in there, somewhere.}
<C>__{saito}
<D>__{for someone like you to steal?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{yes. in the dream state, conscious defenses are lowered and your thoughts become vulnerable to theft. it's called extraction.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{but, mr. saito, we can train your subconscious to defend itself from even the most skilled extractor.}
<C>__{saito}
<D>__{how can you do that?}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{because i am the most skilled extractor. i know how to search your mind and find your secrets. i know the tricks, and i can teach them to your subconscious so that even when you're asleep, your guard is never down.}
<A>__{cobb leans forwards. holding saito's gaze.}
<C>__{cobb}
<D>__{but if i'm going to help you, you have to be completely open to me. i will need to know my way around your thoughts better than your wife, your analyst, anyone.}
<P>__{(gestures around)}
<D>__{if this is a dream and you've got a safe full of secrets, i need to know what's in that safe. for this to work, you have to let me in.}
<A>__{saito gives this a flicker of a smile. rises. a bodyguard opens double doors which give onto a lavish party.}
<C>__{saito}
<D>__{gentlemen. enjoy your evening as i consider your proposal.}
<A>__{they watch saito leave. arthur turns to cobb, worried }
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{he knows.}
<A>__{cobb motions silence. a tremor starts, they steady their glasses, cobb glances at his watch the second hand is}
<B>__{frozen.}
<C>__{arthur}
