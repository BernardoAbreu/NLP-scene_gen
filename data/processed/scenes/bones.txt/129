<L>__{exterior blackstone street night}
<A>__{that night we see a walking shadow. the long tall black clad bones. heading down his old block. alone. as he moves, his face changes, at times demonic and intent. but periodically that shifts as if a mask slipping off to reveal a similar but different face below. more human, lost, pained, confused, and we see why: from bones' fucked up undead pov: the dark and desolate street he walks down keeps flashing for brief instants into the street of twenty years ago. one moment, people nodding to him, waving, blowing kisses. and then suddenly, it's the empty burnt block it is now. bones' face shifts, cracking, one second the hungry ghost. the next, he's the old bones who once ruled this 'hood. he sees, down the block, the old palmistry sign. it's pearl's place. for a second, the face of the real jimmy bones triumphs and he smiles. then hears voices behind him. stank and weaze. they see a tall, thin figure in some very fine looking, long duster.}

<C>__{bones}
<D>__{sure. here it is.}
<A>__{suddenly, out from the depths of his shadow, flies the edge of bones' razor and the blade slashes stank in the face. cutting a sideways, smart aleck smile in his cheek. weaze pulls a gun and shoots bones. bones jolts a little as the bullet imbeds itself in his stomach. but he takes it like a punch and looks up.}
<C>__{bones }
<D>__{cut that shit out.}
<A>__{he grabs one of the boys in each long hand and hoists them up to his height and pins them against the wall.}
