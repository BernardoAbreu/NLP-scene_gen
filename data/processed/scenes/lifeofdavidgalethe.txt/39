<L>__{interior duplex living area night}
<A>__{the duplex is upscale, two story with a vaulted ceiling. scattered about are forty party goers, mostly grad students. some spill out onto the back patio and around the pool. everyone has a t shirt with a philosophic idea ("yawnic," "mad, bad and dangerous to know," "[philosophic t shirt]".)}
<B>__{leonard cohen music plays. from front door}
<A>__{greer (late 20s, persian, "host" t shirt) escorts david into the living room.}
<C>__{greer}
<D>__{the guy's the immanuel kant of the n.f.l. consistent, accurate, effective, and boring, boring, boring.}
<A>__{greer leaves him at the sofa where an older professor (60s, homemade t shirt "pre socratic" over his shirt and tie) stands speaking with ross (late 40s, "homosexualist" t shirt).}

<C>__{david}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{looks like sharon's affair is an open secret.}
<C>__{ross}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{hermeneutical bias: the only fun truths are the ones someone's trying to hide.}
<P>__{(normal tone)}
<D>__{have a seat.}
<A>__{they sit on the sofa.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{listen, berlin's here and livid. probations suspended her. she received the letter today, took the opportunity to throw a fit in my office. you should }

<A>__{she's tipsy, brings her face down between their heads.}
<C>__{berlin}
<P>__{(to david)}
<D>__{he tell you i said when you were circumcised they threw away the wrong part.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{he mentioned it.}
<A>__{an uncomfortable beat. she reaches over and takes ross's drink from his hand, drinks the rest, puts it back.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{it's called schmuck.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{the part of the foreskin that gets thrown away. i think it's called schmuck.}

<D>__{aren't we so fucking clever.}
<C>__{ross}
<P>__{(standing, escaping)}
<D>__{i suppose i should get us another. david?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{black bush.}
<A>__{ross walks to the bar. berlin comes around and sits in his seat. her mid drift t shirt reads "sex is power."}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{you were a jerk this afternoon.}
<A>__{a beat. she's turned facing him, he looks forward.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{for what it's worth, i didn't know about the suspension.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{is that supposed to be an apology?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{more like a conciliation.}
<B>__{on food and drinks table}
<A>__{ross has two gin and tonics and is finishing pouring david's black bush. he moves away. the table is neatly laid with snacks and bottles. the flower arrangement is perfect. same scene later the table is now in mid party chaos. food spilled, bottles empty, the flowers in disarray. "i'm too sexy" plays loudly in the background. berlin takes a bottle of red label from the table. camera tracks her through the living room, where a few people now dance, and out onto the patio. a crowd well on their way to being drunk gathers by the pool. they surround two patio chairs which face each other, one with david, the other with ross. the men are playing an irish drinking game the crowd has chosen favorites.}
<C>__{ross}
<P>__{(slurring a bit)}
<D>__{all right.}
<P>__{(clears his throat)}
<D>__{as the poets have mournfully sung, death takes the innocent young, the screamingly funny, the rolling in money, and those who are very well hung.}
<A>__{laughter, a few animated moans. david raises his glass to ross and downs a whiskey. someone starts to chant: "gale! gale! gale!"}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(feeling good but very much in control)}
<D>__{there once was a lesbian from canjuom, who took a young man to her room, and they argued all night, as to who had the right, to do what, how, and to whom.}
<A>__{laughter. two women holding each other boo. ross drinks.}
<C>__{berlin}
<D>__{one more. c'mon, one more.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{enough. that's enough.}
<A>__{the crowd wants more. someone makes chicken sounds.}
<C>__{ross}
<D>__{do you bow to the queen?}
<A>__{david looks at him, contemplates, then smiles. he holds his glass out for a refill. the crowd applauds.}
<B>__{full shot of patio}
<A>__{the crowd is chanting: "ross! ross! ross!" same scene later the crowd has dispersed. a couple of small groups converse. someone is being thrown into the pool. techno music plays. inside the duplex a few dancers are still going at it.}
