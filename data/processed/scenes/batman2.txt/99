<L>__{interior barrett's car that moment}
<A>__{the liveried driver drums his fingers as he waits for the light to change. barrett's in the back, speaking into his cellular phone.}
<C>__{barrett}
<D>__{it's time we called an emergency meeting of the raven society. get back to me...}
<A>__{looking troubled, he hangs up. a fat white glob of pigeon shit splatters across the windshield. seconds later another splat.}
<C>__{barrett }
<D>__{damn pigeons.}
<C>__{driver}
<D>__{just washed it, too.}
<A>__{the driver reaches for the wiper switch. they hear a tiny dink as a solid pellet bounces off the windshield. barrett and the driver exchange a mystified look. a small, blinking capsule has just lodged in the wiper blade assembly... overhead shot on barrett's car just as the light changes, the car explodes into a million fragments leaving a blackened crater in the middle of the intersection.}
