<L>__{exterior canyon continuous}
<A>__{sally and joe have lanterns. panes and skye are up ahead. we hear them calling for otis.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{otis!!!!}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(on her heels)}
<D>__{otis!!!!}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{otis, good boy, come here. oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{this is a nightmare. we should have kept him upstairs.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{it was done. when sophia put the kids to bed, america brought otis in the room and closed the door. it was done.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well someone clearly let him out before monica opened the gate.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{oh fuck you, and fuck monica while you're at it. but i guess that's what i interrupted.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{jesus, sally. you are a medical miracle. the only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{yeah, let's talk about that. you seem to be rather an expert. i don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{rave parties?! that's so typical you would think it was called rage. perfect!}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{what else don't i know about, joe? let's get really clear here.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{sally, so i took a few pills. i went out dancing. i tried to forget how upset i was about splitting up with you. i haven't lied to you. i told you about the people i've slept with. i just didn't mention the few occasions i took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental i knew i'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me. sally, we're back, i love you. trust that. please let's not do this.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{otis! come! good boy! come!}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{otis!}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i'm not sure we understand that word in the same way.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{love?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{you walked out on a five year marriage.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{that hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love. it's whether we can live together... like this! all the time.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{it's not like this all the time.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{do i want anyone else? no. do i want to be with you for the rest of my natural life? i'm trying.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{and how hard it hit?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{just stop right there, sally. we've been through this.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{you've been through it. that's how you love people. when it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit. and second...}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{you want to talk about bullshit? lucy called you three times this week. she's a fucking mess, joe. your sister is a fucking mess. she needs you. i talk to her more than you do.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{that is not true.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{it is true. you know how you love, joe? you dedicate a book to someone.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{every novel i've had published in every language i've dedicated to lucy.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{right. and when was the last time you spoke to her?}
<A>__{joe is silent.}
<C>__{sally }
<D>__{and how fucking dare you cast skye davidson in that part? have you any idea how humiliating that is for me? i'm an actress! it's about our marriage for fuck's sake. everybody knows that...}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{it's a novel.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{about me!}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{who the fuck do you think you are? the part of genna is not just about you. it's about every woman i've ever loved in my entire life. including my mother. the character is also clearly in her early twenties, sally.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{what are you saying?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{hello? last birthday was?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i don't look my age, joe.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{sally, i have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it. and you are out of touch with reality if you think differently.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{it's a shit novel anyway.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{well there you go. i let you off the hook. you're one goddamn lucky actress.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{not really. i mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch. that's what all our friends think, anyway.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{okay. if we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. because i don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore. and the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in. that you don't have... oh christ, sally.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{who? who? who thinks that?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{your director and your co star of your current movie. don't dish if you can't take it, sally.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{mac? mac says it? cal?}
<A>__{joe doesn't respond.}
<C>__{sally }
<D>__{cal, too?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{sally, for christ's sake.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{anyone else?}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{this is insanity.}
<P>__{(moves toward her)}
<D>__{sally...}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{don't.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{don't push me away.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i had an abortion two weeks ago.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{don't do this.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i found out i was pregnant and it scared the shit out of me.}
<C>__{joe}
<P>__{(threatens)}
<D>__{don't do this!}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i told you when we met i never wanted children. i don't want kids in my life. we talked about it. you weren't listening.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you changed your mind.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i wanted you back.}
<A>__{joe slaps her hard across the face.}
<C>__{sally }
<D>__{you think this was to hurt you?! my god, joe. it isn't about you.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{what?! you aborted our child?!}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i'm a monster. exactly.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{you're not ready.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{don't make allowances. i will never be ready. some people just shouldn't have children. i'd be a terrible fucking mother, joe. i did want it for us. but i couldn't do it. i don't really think i can do it.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i wasn't part of that picture at all, was i? i wasn't part of that decision. did i occur to you at all? it's a fucking farce. it's a fucking farce. how long did you think you could keep it going. you're amazing. do you have any idea what you've done to us?}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{yes.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i will never forgive you.}
<C>__{sally}
<D>__{i know.}
<C>__{joe}
<D>__{i have no idea who you are.}
<A>__{they stand their in silence. joe is devastated. we hear skye and panes up ahead calling for otis.}
