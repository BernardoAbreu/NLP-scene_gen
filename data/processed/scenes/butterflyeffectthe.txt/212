<L>__{interior dr. redfield's offcie day}
<A>__{evan runs into dr. redfield's office just as another patient is leaving.}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{hey, evan. what's the big rush? we don't meet for another hour.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{where are my goddamn books?}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{books?}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{my journals! where are they?}
<A>__{the doctor looks heartbroken, as if evan has had a relapse.}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{it kills me to have to go through this again. there are no journals. there never were. it's part of this fantasy world your mind created to cope with the guilt of killing...}
<A>__{evan looks stunned. refusing to believe it.}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{think evan. you've invented a disease that doesn't exist. alternate universes with colleges, prisons, paraplegia...}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{but i... i need those books.}
<C>__{dr. redfield}
<D>__{you remind me of your father. he always screamed for a photo album even though he never had one.}
<C>__{evan}
<D>__{photos?}
<A>__{evan's eyes roll back and he collapses lifelessly to the floor.}
