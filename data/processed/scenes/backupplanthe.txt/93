<A>__{a cab pulls up in front of zoe's brownstone. stan opens the door for zoe who is now wearing a long silver dress. while it's certainly hugging every curve and bump, it looks great.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{you look smokin'.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{thanks, honey.}
<A>__{zoe pauses in front of the open taxi door.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{let's go. we're super late.}
<A>__{she tries to bend at the waist, but the dress is too tight. then she tries to go in butt first and swing her legs around, but again, the dress is too tight.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{hmmmm...}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{why don't you sort of go in...head first and then turn around.}
<A>__{zoe leans her head in and then has no other choice but to lie down sideways on the seat. stan tries not to laugh.}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{shut up and push me.}
<C>__{stan}
<D>__{push you?}
<C>__{zoe}
<D>__{just do it.}
<A>__{stan pushes her legs, and zoe disappears inside the cab.}
