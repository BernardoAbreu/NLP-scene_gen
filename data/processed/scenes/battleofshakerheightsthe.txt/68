<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{of course it matters. doesn't the truth matter?}
<A>__{bart grins.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{i don't know. you tell me.}
<A>__{kelly avoids this by getting out of the car.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i want a drink. let me borrow a couple bucks.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{i told you not to play him for money.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i was trying to be nice. he's your friend.}
<A>__{bart returns the pump and screws in the gas cap.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{exactly. you should know better. what do you want.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{mountain dew }
<A>__{just then he glances towards the gas station and sees eve, set up in the adjacent abandoned lot. she's got the van parked there with the sliding door open and paintings propped around on display.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{ oh shit.}
<A>__{but eve has seen him. she shields her eyes with her hand and calls to him.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{kelly!}
<A>__{kelly backtracks towards the car.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{that woman's calling you.}
<A>__{eve walks over to them. kelly can't get out of it.}
<C>__{kelly}
<P>__{(low)}
<D>__{bart. meet my mom.}
<A>__{eve smiles brightly.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{what a nice surprise. it's so nice to finally meet you.}
<A>__{bart is surprised but recovers his manners quickly, just like he's been taught to.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{likewise. so, doing a little business?}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{a little is right. but i work it as much as i can.}
<A>__{eve laughs. kelly shifts his weight from foot to foot. eve looks at both of them.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{so, what have you boys been up to?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{bart took me to meet his friend charlie at the old soldiers' home.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{charlie at the old soldiers' home?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{you don't know him.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{you boys should swing by care house. there are some vets there.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{we can't.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{oh. well okay.}
<A>__{eve watches a car pull into the lot next to the van.}
<C>__{eve}
<D>__{i should go. but you boys should come over to our house some time.}
<P>__{(to bart)}
<D>__{i know your family must get tired of him.}
<A>__{kelly visibly bristles at the thought of his parents entertaining bart.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{not at all. but i'd love to, anyway.}
<A>__{eve looks at kelly. then she runs back over to the van.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{there you go. now you know everything.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{what's your problem? she's pretty cute.}
<A>__{kelly rolls his eyes and gets back in the car.}
<C>__{bart}
<D>__{don't you want your soda?}
