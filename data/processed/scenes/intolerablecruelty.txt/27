<L>__{interior massey house morning}
<A>__{miles and marylin asleep in bed. the alarm rings. miles wakes, turns to his beautiful wife kisses her good morning. she gives him a sleepy smile. miles dressing for work. marylin, in a sabia rosa bathrobe places a tray with coffee next to him. he holds up two ties for her approval. she selects one. he puts it on. miles and marylin reading newspapers while eating breakfast. she serves him a bowl of fruit and indicates wrigley's berry spoons. they laugh heartily. marylin waves good bye as miles backs drives to the office. she waves at the gardeners who blow palm fronds around the lawn.}
<B>__{miles office}
<A>__{he has managed to fill his credenza with pictures of married life. due to its brevity these pictures are uneventful, the massey's wear the same outfit in most of them. miles works. he is interrupted by the voice of his secretary.}
<C>__{secretary}
<D>__{i have mrs. massey on line one for you.}
<A>__{miles picks up.}
<C>__{miles}
<D>__{mom...?}
<A>__{he laughs and laughs. we hear marylin's laughter coming through the receiver. miles exits a flower store with a bouquet of tulips. marylin at the doorway, greets miles as he arrives home. as miles changes into his casual after work outfit, (khakis?) marylin sits at the edge of the bed. he's telling her about his day, and she is rapt with attention. the massey's have a candlelit dinner of fish and pasta. the tulips are in the middle of the table. miles and marylin snuggle on a couch and watch seinfeld. miles in bed on the new frette linen. a few too many pillows, but he's making it work. marylin enters the bedroom in a nightshirt that is the perfect combination of innocence and nastiness. he puts down his book as she gets into bed with him. they gaze at one another the picture of contentment and impending lust. click lights out}
