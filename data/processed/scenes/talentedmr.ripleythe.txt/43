<A>__{ripley and dickie sit outside at a cafe in the piazza navona. very smart, very sophisticated, very young crowd. there are already several empty coffee cups and a half empty bottle of frascati. ripley has his guide book out and is incredibly impatient. dickie, meanwhile, has stretched out for the duration.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{where do we find a carozza for the forum, or can we hire any of them ?}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{relax.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{it's just there's so much to do in a single day.}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{relax. the most important question is where to eat. i hope freddie made a reservation.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{freddie?}
<C>__{dickie}
<D>__{freddie miles. you know he's organizing the cortina skiing trip.}
<A>__{ripley hates the idea of having this special day invaded. a horn makes him look up as freddie miles illegally parks his open top sports car opposite the cafe, sees dickie and bustles over. he's a heavy set american with a reddish crewcut. ripley finds him disgusting to look at. dickie is delighted.}
