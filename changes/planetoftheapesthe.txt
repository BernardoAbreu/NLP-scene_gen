<ACTION>__{Stars glitter like diamonds on the black velvet backdrop of space. The Belt of Orion is center screen, but much nearer and larger than ever seen by an Earth-bound astronomer. A speck of light appears in the lower left corner of the screen. No spaceship can be seen, but only a glowworm, a solitary sperma- tosoan gliding through the womb of the universe. Over this we HEAR the voice of an astronaut. He is concluding a report.}

<LOC>__{INT. CABIN OF SPACESHIP - ESTABLISHING SHOT - NIGHT}
<ACTION>__{The cabin is neither cramped nor spacious, but about the size of the President's cabin in Air Force One. In the immediate f.g. is a console of dials and switches flanked by four chairs. Only one of the chairs is occupied. The astronaut's back is to CAMERA. There is a ladder amidships which leads to an escape hatch. The after Dart of the cabin is obscured in darkness. We hear the MUSIC of a Mozart sonata emanating from a phonograph of stereotape. The astronaut is speaking into a microphone.}

Over this we hear:}

<CHAR>__{TAYLOR} <CHAR_PAR>__{}
<DIAL>__{It may be so. This much is probable: the men who sent us on this journey have long since been moldering in forgotten graves; and those, if any, who read this message are a different breed. Hopefully, a better one.}

<DIAL>__{One final thought -- nothing scientific, purely personal. Seen from up here, everything looks different ... Time bends and space is boundless. It squashes a man's ego. He begins to feel like no more than a mote in the eye of eternity. And he is nagged by a question: ahat if any- thing, will greet us on the end of man's first journey to a star? Are we to believe that throughout these thousands of galaxies, these millions of stars, only one, that speck of solar dust we call Earth, has been graced -- or cursed -- by human life?}

<ACTION>__{Space scientists have presumably solved the problem of weightlessness, for Taylor walks the short distance from; the console to the after section without particular effort. CAMERA FOLLOWS him, and we can now see four glass capsules, or "caskets", in the rear of the cabin. Taylor looks down at them.}
<LOC>__{7-    SEVERAL SHOTS - THE FOUR CASKETS - FROM TAYLOR'S P.O.V. 10}

Dodge and Landon are thirtyish, clean-shaven, virile -- America's finest. Stewart is a handsome young woman, her hair bobbed short. Their eyes are closed and they do not appear to be breathing -- yet no undertaker could make them so alive.}

At first the globe occupies but a small area of the screen; but with each new VIEW it comes closer and looms larger, as if" observed from a spaceship in a spiraling orbit of descent. The topography of the planet bears little resemblance to our own. Much of it is obscured by cloud cover; even more of-it appears to be cratered desert of reddish hue. We can, however, make out a few narrow "green belts" and a patch of blue water. In the FINAL SHOTS of this SEQUENCE we see the strange planet as it would be observed from a spacecraft plummeting from twenty thousand feet to one thousand feet. It appears that the ship will fall into a vast lake surrounded by soaring sandstone pinnacles. The water is blue-black, the pinnacles vermillion. (This is the Lake Powell location, at Lone Rock.)}

The whole ship shudders on impact. Loose equipment falls to the cabin floor. CAMERA MOVES DOWN the cabin aisle as the ship begins to roll in the water and HOLDS on the four glass caskets.
