<L>__{exterior lila's camper day}
<A>__{ray gets in the horizon and pulls it in behind the acclaim then digs in the trunk, pulling out a rope. she ties one end to the acclaim's back fender and the other to the horizon's front fender. lila watches out the camper window. ray gets in the acclaim and starts it up slowly towing the horizon a few feet before the rope snaps. ray gets out and looks at the broken rope. she begins digging in the trunk for more rope. lila opens the camper door and looks at the bullet hole.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{this camper belongs to my brother in law. he won't like this.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(over her shoulder)}
<D>__{then you should quit stealing cars.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{i thought it was abandoned, the guy driving it got on a bus.}
<A>__{ray stops.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{did you see where the bus was headed?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{new york or buffalo, i'm not sure.}
<A>__{ray re ties the tow line with the remaining rope. this time the horizon goes an inch or two before the rope snaps. ray gets out.}
<C>__{ray}
<P>__{(under her breath)}
<D>__{shit!}
<A>__{ray rifles through the trunk for more rope. "home on the range" plays on the cell phone in ray's back pocket. lila touches the bullet hole in the camper and listens to ray's conversation from the doorway. ray puts the phone back in her pocket and takes an old belt of her husbands and tries to attach the fenders of the cars. ray gets back in the acclaim and tries towing the horizon once again. this time the right side of the front fender snaps off and droops to one side. ray gets out and looks at lila.}
<C>__{ray }
<D>__{i'm not leaving this here.}
<C>__{lila}
<P>__{(points at the acclaim)}
<D>__{i got a friend who might buy that.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{it's not for sale.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{he'll pay more than it's worth.}
<A>__{ray ignores her.}
<C>__{lila }
<D>__{maybe two thousand.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{why's that?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{he's always looking for cars with button release trunks.}
<A>__{ray thinks about it.}
<C>__{lila }
<D>__{he don't need papers or anything.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{does he use them to rob banks or something?}
<A>__{lila shrugs.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{all i know is he pays good for a car like this.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{where does he live?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{through the woods. not far.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{what's in it for you?}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{he'll give me something for finding it.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{if you try anything, i'm not afraid to use this.}
<C>__{lila}
<D>__{yeah.}
