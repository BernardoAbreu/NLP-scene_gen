<A>__{we move through a spooky shrouded parlor, as a storm rages outside. thunder roars, and lightning flashes in the giant windows. in the center of the room lies an oak coffin. suddenly the lid starts to creak open. a hand crawls past the edge... and then the lid slams up! famed psychic criswell pops out. criswell, 40, peers at us intently, his gleaming eyes framed under his striking pale blonde hair. he intones, with absolute conviction:}
<C>__{criswell}
<D>__{greetings, my friend. you are interested in the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable... that is why you are here. so now, for the first time, we are bringing you the full story of what happened...}
<P>__{(extremely serious)}
<D>__{we are giving you all the evidence, based only on the secret testimony of the miserable souls who survived this terrifying ordeal. the incidents, the places, my friend, we cannot keep this a secret any longer. can your hearts stand the shocking facts of the true story of edward d. wood, junior??}

<L>__{exterior hollywood night}
<A>__{we've landed in hollywood, 1952. we're outside a teeny, grungy playhouse. the cracked marquee proclaims "'the casual company,' written and directed by edward d. wood, jr." pacing nervously in the rain is ed wood, 30, our hero. larger than life charismatic, confident, errol flynn style handsome, ed is a human magnet. he's a classically flawed optimist: sweet and well intentioned, yet doomed by his demons within. the doors open, and ed's pal john "bunny" breckinridge, 45, hurries out. bunny is a wealthy, theatrical fop wearing a string of pearls.}

<C>__{ed}
<D>__{the ghost can be barefoot. give me your shoes !}
<A>__{she hands ed her white shoes. he snatches one, grabs a pair of scissors, and starts cutting up the shoe. everyone is baffled. he keeps cutting the shoe... and it slowly takes on the shape of a dove! ed then grabs some pipe cleaners, works them into a shape, and sprints into the dressing room. he takes some green eye shadow and excitedly smears it on the pipe cleaners. ed then hurries back out, jams the green pipe cleaners into the cut up shoe... and it looks like a dove with an olive branch in its mouth! the cast is flabbergasted.}
