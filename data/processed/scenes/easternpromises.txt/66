<D>__{anna drives her motorbike through north london streets. rain is falling.}
<L>__{exterior trans siberian restaurant night}
<D>__{anna is standing in the falling rain, staring over at the trans siberian restaurant. the restaurant is busy, with the noise of revelers swelling every time the door is opened. anna seems to be exiled from where she should really be inside a restaurant like this, with its danger and vibrancy. suddenly she is illuminated by headlights. she turns and sees that nikolai is pulling up in his mercedes. kirill is in the passenger seat. nikolai gets out of the car and stops when he sees anna. anna is like a fox caught in headlights.}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{what are you doing here? a pause.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(echoing nikolai's words)}
<D>__{i don't know. i was passing. kirill studies the gaze between nikolai and anna and senses the connection.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{if you're passing, you pass. you keep going, bitch. nikolai, come on... kirill grabs nikolai's arm, and after peering at anna for a moment, he turns to go with kirill. anna gathers her courage.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{family is important to you people isn't it?}
<C>__{kirill}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{'you people'?}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{what the hell is she talking about? music swells from the restaurant.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{tell semyon the baby i delivered on christmas eve is his daughter. kirill and nikolai stop. a swell of laughter from the restaurant. anna is about to continue but nikolai steps forward and places two fingers on anna's lips to stop her from saying anymore. anna tears his hands from her mouth. at the same time kirill yells in russian.}
<C>__{kirill}
<P>__{(in russian)}
<D>__{what did she say?! anna is terrified but angry too. she yells.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{when he raped her she was a virgin. then they gave her pills. semyon has to be the father! kirill suddenly goes for her over the bonnet of the car....}
<C>__{nikolai}
<P>__{(in russian))}
<D>__{she's a civilian! kirill pushes anna up against the car, but she fights him.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{she was fourteen! she was a child! kirill slaps anna hard. nikolai grabs kirill and pulls him away.}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{you don't use my father's name! you don't say that filth about him... he goes for anna again, and this time nikolai shoves kirill to the wet ground. he looks up at nikolai and slowly gets to his feet. he wipes his hands then stares into nikolai's eyes.}
<C>__{kirill }
<D>__{don't even look at her any more. headlights from a passing car sweep the scene....}
<C>__{kirill }
<D>__{that's an order. nikolai peers at anna for a moment. anna's voice is defiant but cracking with fear.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{tell him what i said. nikolai has taken what anna said on board. he speaks softly...}
<C>__{nikolai}
<D>__{there is nothing to tell. slaves give birth to slaves... kirill yells....}
<C>__{kirill}
<D>__{come on nikolai!! he turns to anna...}
<C>__{kirill }
<D>__{and if you open your mouth again, i will tell my driver to stick his cock inside it! understand? maybe that's what you want! he offers the lights of the restaurant to her as a vicious invitation.}
<C>__{kirill }
<D>__{you want to come in?! maybe we all get to fuck you.... anna stares back. nikolai peers at her for a moment before grabbing kirill and pulling him away towards the restaurant.}
