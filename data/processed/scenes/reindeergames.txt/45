<A>__{with a fiery look, she strides from the room. rudy stands, can't get far cuffed to the bed. checks the end table, finds a bible and a deck of cards. out his second floor window is a view of the rear parking lot. rudy watches as a chevy blazer parks and two drunk fishermen get out. the truck's bumper sticker reads "ice fishermen do it all year long." rudy watches the good ol' boys stumble toward the hotel. he turns back, surveys his new prison cell}
