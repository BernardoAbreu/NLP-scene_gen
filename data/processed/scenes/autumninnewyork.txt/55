<D>__{at work you should look perfect, but in everyday life you need to delight in disorder more. don't you know? "a sweet disorder in the dress kindles in clothes a wantonness."}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{i think that goes without saying.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{it was true when that poem was written three hundred years ago and it's true today. wouldn't it be fun to look wanton occasionally?}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{it's been a lifelong dream of mine. but will a scarf do it?}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{totally. accessories rule. but we have to be careful. i don't want you looking too young. nothing's worse than an old guy trying to look young.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{good advice. i will remember that for when i get old.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{you know what i meant.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{that i'm old.}
<C>__{charlotte}
<D>__{uh huh.}
