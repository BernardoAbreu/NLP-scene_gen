<A>__{...over the gotham river to the palisades on the far side...}
<C>__{mayor }
<D>__{harvey dent's uncompromising stand against organized crime and, yes, ultimately, his sacrifice, have made gotham a safer place than it was at the time of his death, eight years ago...}
<A>__{...finding a party in the grounds of wayne manor. the mayor addresses the wealthy and powerful of gotham.}
<C>__{mayor}
<D>__{this city has seen a historic turnaround. no city is without crime. but this city is without organized crime because the dent act gave law enforcement teeth in its fight against the mob. now people are talking about repealing the dent act. and to them i say...not on my watch.}

<D>__{congressman.}
<C>__{congressman}
<D>__{ever lay eyes on wayne at one of these things?}
<A>__{gordon shakes his head. gordon's deputy commissioner, foley, cuts in.}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{no one has. not in years.}
<C>__{mayor }
<D>__{he can tell you about the bad old days, when the criminals and corrupt ran this town with such a tight grasp that people put their faith in a murderous thug in a mask and a cape. a thug who showed his true nature when he betrayed the trust of this great man (turns to picture of dent.) and murdered him in cold blood.}
<A>__{the congressman watches a tray of canapes breeze past, then grabs the ass of the maid carrying them. she freezes.}
<C>__{congressman}
<D>__{sweetheart, not so fast with the chow.}

<C>__{mayor }
<D>__{jim gordon can tell you the truth about harvey dent...}
<C>__{congressman}
<D>__{jesus, gordon, is that your speech? we're gonna be here all night.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{maybe the truth about harvey isn't so simple, congressman.}
<C>__{mayor }
<D>__{but i will let him tell you himself commissioner gordon?}
<A>__{applause. gordon approaches the mike. looks down at his long speech. thinks.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{the truth...?}
<A>__{insert cut: harvey dent, face half destroyed, threatens gordon's son with a handgun. gordon surveys the audience. deciding.}
<D>__{i have written a speech telling the truth about harvey dent...}
<A>__{gordon folds up his speech.}
<D>__{maybe the time isn't right...}
<A>__{gordon stuffs the papers inside his jacket. the congressman mutters under his breath.}
<C>__{congressman}
<D>__{thank christ for that...}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{maybe right now all you need to know is that there are a thousand inmates in blackgate prison as a direct result of the dent act. these are violent criminals, essential cogs in the organized crime machine that terrorized gotham for so long. maybe, for now, all i should say about harvey dent's death is this...it has not been for nothing.}
<A>__{the figure on the balcony turns back into the mansion. people clap as gordon leaves the mike. gordon approaches foley.}
<C>__{gordon}
<D>__{the second shift reports in?}

<A>__{gordon heads for the line of town cars in the gravel drive.}
<C>__{congressman}
<D>__{anyone shown him the crime stats?}
<C>__{foley}
<D>__{he goes by his gut, and it continues to bother him, whatever the numbers.}
