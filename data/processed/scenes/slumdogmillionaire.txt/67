<L>__{exterior goods yard. night.}
<A>__{they run over the tracks, between the trains, but the shouts are getting louder, the torches closer. a diesel engine is moving out of the station. jamal, latika and salim sprint for the guard's van at the very back of the moving train. punnoose is closest to them. salim is fastest and first to jump the train. he holds out his hand. jamal grabs it and is hauled in. jamal holds his hand out to latika.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{come on! faster!}
<A>__{she reaches out to him. their hands almost touch.}
<C>__{jamal }
<D>__{take it! take it! i can't reach...}
<A>__{salim barges jamal out of the way. jamal stumbles back as salim reaches his hand out to latika, so he doesn't see latika's hand grasp salim's, nor see their eyes lock onto each other, nor see salim very deliberately let go of her hand. latika stumbles.}
<C>__{latika}
<D>__{jamal!}
<A>__{jamal scrambles to the rail. the train gains more speed. jamal climbs on to the top rung, makes to jump, but salim flings him backward. jamal tries to scramble to his feet again, but salim restrains him.}
<C>__{jamal}
<D>__{got to go back. we've got to go back.}
<C>__{salim}
<D>__{he'll kill us if we go back. jamal! he was going to take your eyes out with a bloody spoon!}
<A>__{the train is speeding along. jamal breaks free and stares back at latika.}
<C>__{salim }
<D>__{she'll be alright. she always is.}
<A>__{latika stumbles again and stops running. they watch as punnoose catches up with her and stops running. he smashes latika to the ground.}
