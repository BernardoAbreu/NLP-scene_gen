<L>__{interior coffee shop day}
<A>__{at the counter, max stirs cream into his coffee. then he takes three pills from the plastic bottle and drops them in his coffee. max flips past a full page ad in the paper that reads lancet percy 86% accuracy (only god is perfect). max flips the page before he or we can absorb it. he compares stock quotes in the wall street journal against his printout.}
<C>__{max }
<D>__{sixteen, twenty seven. results: euclid shows tomorrow's dow closing up by four points. anomalies include pronet at sixty fire and a quarter, a career high. possible explanations, either a, an error in the june fifth algorithm, or b, euclid's main processor is running a recursion...}
<A>__{max marks up the paper with lines and diagrams as he ponders his bits and misses. then a puff of cigarette smoke drifts by and succeeds in bothering max. he fans it away when}
<C>__{voice from offscreen}
<D>__{oh sorry, am i bothering you?}
<A>__{max shrugs and looks over. the voice belongs to lenny meyera bearded man in his late 20s sucking on a cigarette. on closer inspection, something is off. it seems that lenny is an orthodox jew. his yarmulke sticks out slightly from his wide brimmed hat and the fringes from his tsi tsis hang out from the bottom of his untucked shirt.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{i will put it out.}
<P>__{(which he does)}
<D>__{the name's lenny meyer}
<A>__{lenny sticks out his hand. max responds with a small nod.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{and you are?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{max.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{max?}

<P>__{(judging)}
<D>__{jewish?}
<A>__{max shrugs and turns back to his work.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{it's okay.}
<P>__{(joking)}
<D>__{i'm a jew, too.}
<P>__{(serious)}
<D>__{do you practice?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{no, i'm not interested in religion.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{have you ever heard of kabbalah?}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{jewish mysticism.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i'm sorry, i'm very busy.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{i understand...it's just that it's a very exciting time in our history. right now is a critical moment in time.}
<C>__{max}
<P>__{(sarcastic)}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{yes, it's very exciting. have you ever put on tefillin?}
<A>__{max has no idea what lenny's talking about. lenny pulls a leather box with black leather straps from his pocket.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{tefillin. you know tefillin. i know it looks strange. but it's an amazing tradition that has a tremendous amount of power. it's a mitzvah for all jewish men to do. mitzvahs, good deeds, are spiritual food for our hearts and our heads.}
<A>__{and then max notices that his thumb is twitching he grabs it self consciously.}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{they purify us and bring us closer to god. you want to try it?}
<A>__{just then, max pays his bill and prepares to leave.}
<C>__{max}
<D>__{i gotta go...}
<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{are you okay? max? max?}

<C>__{lenny meyer}
<D>__{well, maybe some other time.}
