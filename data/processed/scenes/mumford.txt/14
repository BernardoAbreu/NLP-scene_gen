<L>__{interior mumford's office day}
<A>__{mumford is listening to lionel, the arrogant lawyer who asked about him in the restaurant. lionel is lying on the couch, talking with enormous energy; he has a serious superiority complex. mumford can't stand him and the session seems to be lasting an eternity.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{...so i'm watching brokaw and they've got some astronomer, this little limey know it all, and he's telling how, with this himball telescope, they've discovered there are maybe 400 million more galaxies than they thought there were. and i guess that's supposed to make me feel small? i'm supposed to feel insignificant? is that the point? because i can tell you it didn't.}
<A>__{mumfords eyes dart to look at the clock on the bookshelf: 2:23}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{lionel, since this is our first session together, maybe }
<A>__{lionel is twisting his neck around painfully to look back at mumford.}
<C>__{mumford}
<D>__{ you can sit up and look at me if you'd like }
<P>__{(lionel waves that off and looks away)}
<D>__{ maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{kind of impatient for a big time headshrinker, aren't you? how 'bout you let me explain it my own way...}
<A>__{as lionel goes on, mumford's eyes again dart toward the clock: still 2:23! hold on it. finally, it moves. mumford's eyes dart toward his desk a deadly looking letter opener in the shape of excalibur stands glinting light in a marble rendition of arthur's stone.}
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{...and in the dream, it's always the same, i wake up in my room from when i was i kid in ohio, and i realize this is the day of the big exam at school...}
<A>__{mumford's head rocks slowly back for a moment as if he's going to drift off. he snaps back to life and stares hard at the top of lionel's head, where there is a bald spot starting to take hold. the sound of lionel's voice begins to echo }
<C>__{lionel}
<D>__{...which is no problem for me, because i remembered it was coming and i've attended every class, so i'm totally prepared. then i see myself running down the hall at school...}
<A>__{mumford's glance flashpans from lionel's bald spot to the gleaming letter opener. mumford closes his eyes. we cut to:}
