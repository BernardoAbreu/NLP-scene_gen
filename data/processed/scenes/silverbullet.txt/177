<D>__{the bible tells us not to fear the terror that creepeth by night or that which flieth by noonday, and yet we do... we do. because there is much we don't know, and we feel very small. but we must not be alone. we must not allow ourselves to be alone, for there is the wide gate to the hell of terror. turn to each other. join hands in your sorrow and try to remember that the face of the beast always becomes known. (pause) the time of the beast always passes. (pause) let us pray.}
