<A>__{elevator doors open on three thugs. one of them uses a key to lock the car in place on vicki's floor. the key is on the end of a ring which contains dozens of other keys. the key ring belongs to a doorman, who's riding in the elevator with the joker's trio of thugs. he's dead, alas. the thugs dump him unceremoniously on the floor of the hall and march toward vicki's apartment.}
