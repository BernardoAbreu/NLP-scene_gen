<L>__{exterior pier}
<A>__{they walk out on the pier and eventually stop, look out at the river, watching the working boats. they have their thoughts; the shooter smoking his cigar.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{you think i'm ready?}
<C>__{shooter}
<P>__{(after some time,}
<D>__{several seconds of}
<P>__{thoughtful puffing)}
<D>__{kid, i don't think you're ready.}
<C>__{kid}
<P>__{(quickly)}
<D>__{oh.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{but you're not going to take my word for it, are you? are you now?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{no, i ain't. i can't.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{i know, i know. you got to find out for yourself.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i don't figure to take him right away. but if i can hang in there long enough, i can outlast him. if i can outlast him, i got a chance. you admit that, don't you, that i got a chance?}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{i already said i didn't think you were ready.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{did you think you were ready when you sat down with whistling sam magee?}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{kid, i thought i was the best stud poker player in the world. i'm telling you now, i thought i was the best.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{well, i don't think i'm just a cocky square with a fair hand with cards. i got something.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{no, you ain't no cocky square. and you probably got something.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{okay. and i ain't saying that you was either when you sat down with whistling sam magee.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{if you got the stuff, being a little cocky don't hurt you none.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{well, would you say if i got any chance at all?}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{this much of a chance. if lancey is not right. if he's got a cold, or his stomach ulcer is acting up, or something like that.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{but then everybody'd see he wasn't right and it wouldn't prove nothing. listen, we got to have it understood. if he's not right, we call it off till he is.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{you're set on a real showdown, aren't you? your mind's all made up.}
<A>__{they start back off the pier.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i got to. you said yourself i got to. i'm overdue.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{yeah, you been around a long time i was a lot younger than you when i went up against whistling sam but you'd be kinda young too, to be the man.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i gotta find out.}
<C>__{shooter}
<P>__{(after a pause)}
<D>__{want me to set it up?}
<C>__{kid}
<P>__{(gratefully)}
<D>__{i wish you would, shooter man.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{all right.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{hey, what if he turns me down?}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{he won't, the way i will spread the word. he'll have to take you on, someone in your class. if he ducked it, that'd make you the man.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{you think he knows i'm around?}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{he can smell meat like you a mile and a half up the river. he knows you're around and he'll sit down with you. you want to butt heads with the man, i will set it up.}
<A>__{ahead, on the levee, christian is seen waiting for the kid. she has not yet seen them as they approach off the pier.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{there's your woman.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{i wouldn't want to wait around too long. i want to get in and get it over with.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{he must of come to st. louis for a big money game. i will probably get asked do i want to deal it for them. and however long that takes, he'll have to rest up for you.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{oh, well, if he's tooling a dollar, i can understand that. sure.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{you got much of a stake?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{close to three grand.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{work on it. but three grand will give you a ride and even if you don't win, why you'll come away with a good idea of what you're made of. but once you go in kid you can't quit. you get that straight right now. two of you go in and only one of you can come out.}
<A>__{christian sees them and moves toward them.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{well, school's out. i damn sure don't want no lessons. i want everything he's got.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{it's the only way to be, kid.}
<A>__{shooter turns away abruptly as christian arrives, giving her a brief nod.}
<C>__{shooter}
<D>__{see you.}
<A>__{the kid takes christian's arm automatically; he watches the shooter walk way down harold street. he and christian head in another direction. she is humming a mountain tune.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{when we leaving town, kid? this week?}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{no, i won't be ready. not for a while.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{i thought }
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{might even turn out we don't go.}
<A>__{she is surprised by this and, in her own hesitant way, curious.}
<C>__{christian}
<D>__{you must feel different about it than you did saturday.}
<A>__{he looks at her fondly and, for one fleeting moment of weakness, is actually tempted to tell her about lancey. but it is too sharp a break with tradition.}
<C>__{kid}
<D>__{yeah, i'm feeling a little different.}
<P>__{(time lapse)}
