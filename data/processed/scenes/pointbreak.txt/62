<L>__{exterior latigo beach day extreme long lens scans the beach from a height. a gray,}
<A>__{miserable day. beach crowd thin except for diehards. the image drifts across faces, bodies. surfers walking with boards. talking, sitting with pubescent girls. the image settles on johnny, astride his board, bobbing beyond the break. on pappas, scanning with powerful binoculars from his car. close on utah, out among the flock of hardcore surfers. ostensibly waiting for a wave, his eyes search the others around him, clicking methodically from face to face. finally he swings his board around and awkwardly catches a ride. the modest wave carries him toward the beach as he balances, tense and style less. he passes someone we've seen before. the razorhead from the first day. in concentration, johnny doesn't see the guy. but razorhead definitely sees him. johnny reaches the beach and jogs up the sand. he picks up a towel and talks into it as he dries his hair. a glimpse of the walkie talkie hidden beneath.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{big zippo so far. how about you?}
<C>__{pappas }
<D>__{patience hotshot. patience. it'll be subtle, if it's here at all.}
<A>__{pappas watches as johnny crosses toward the outside shower next to the public restroom. long lens view of utah passing out of sight behind the building. at the shower johnny sets down his gear and opens his wetsuit to the warm, salt free jet of water. tracking slowly in on him as he lets it pour over his face. a hand enters frame, shutting off the water suddenly. tight on utah, his eyes opening. reverse, revealing razorhead and three others. they are powerfully built surf nazis. scalps shaved on the sides. hair military short on top, lengthening into pigtails in the back. tattoos. wrist chains. tone, archbold and warchild. the one who socked utah before is bunker. they spread out flanking him.}
<C>__{warchild}
<D>__{this the guy?}
<C>__{bunker}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{utah}
<P>__{(good natured)}
<D>__{okay, so this is where you tell me all about how locals rule and yuppie insects like me shouldn't be surfing your break and all that, right?}
<C>__{bunker}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{tone}
<D>__{waste of time.}
<C>__{warchild}
<D>__{we're just going to fuck you up.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{oh.}
<A>__{as they lunge, utah grabs his board and swings it in a whistling roundhouse. its edge slams warchild in the gut and folds him double. the bad news is... warchild gets an arm around it and brings a pile driver hammer punch down. the board splits into two pieces. utah drops his end as the others close. a flurry of punches and kicks, most of which he blocks. but he's lost the offensive. bunker takes him to his knees with a vicious karate style side kick. tight on utah's towel, talking with pappas' voice.}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{johnny? you there?}
<A>__{angelo gets out of the car fast. he jogs twenty feet and raises the binoculars. catches a glimpse of the carnage around the edge of the building. breaks into a run, massive legs pistoning. johnny hits the ground hard. he rolls and comes up fast. the razorhead brothers are a little surprised.}
<C>__{archbold}
<D>__{the dude can fight!}
<A>__{warchild grabs utah from behind. gets him in a headlock. archbold and tone pin his arms. bunker starts working him like a practice bag. at this moment, johnny is getting the proverbial shit beat out of him. suddenly, a new figure blurs into frame. bodhi seizes bunker and flings him aside. he spins with remarkable agility and drives his heel into warchild's face. utah breaks free, staggering back on the sand. the fight is still there in his eyes. bodhi is at his side holding the others at bay with a raised hand and an evil look.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{back off! now!! just let it go!}
<C>__{bunker}
<D>__{stay outta this, bodhi!}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{he's with me. now back off. seriously.just do it!}
<P>__{(they relax slightly)}
<D>__{you alright warchild?}
<C>__{warchild}
<P>__{(holding his bleeding nose)}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<A>__{everybody has backed off a bit, panting. utah steps toward bunker. like he's maybe going to shake hands.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{what's your name?}
<C>__{bunker}
<D>__{bunker.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{well, listen, bunker... i'm actually kinda glad you found me.}
<C>__{bunker}
<D>__{yeah? why?}
<A>__{johnny answers with a lightning roundhouse that hits with a crack! they can hear it in pomona. bunker hits the ground. flat out. lights out. tone, archbold and warchild lunge like dogs. bodhi yanks utah out of the line of fire.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<D>__{whoa! whoa! hold it, ladies. give it a rest.}
<P>__{(to utah)}
<D>__{let's go.}
<A>__{he literally turns utah around. they begin to walk, stepping over the pieces of johnny's board.}
<C>__{bodhi}
<P>__{(under his breath)}
<D>__{do me a favor, johnny, just keep walking.}
<A>__{tone starts to go after them. archbold grabs his arm. they help bunker up. warchild holds he bleeding nose. utah and bodhi start up the stairs, turn a corner and run head on into a huffing pappas. the big man clocks a battered but intact utah. we see him shift gears in his head in 2 tenths of a second.}
<C>__{pappas}
<P>__{(out of breath)}
<D>__{uh, you guys seen a kid, maybe 10, 12, running with a car stereo? stole the fucking cd too, you believe it?}
<A>__{utah is grateful for the cover.}
<C>__{utah}
<D>__{no, but there are four guys back there you might check out.}
<C>__{pappas}
<D>__{thanks, buddy.}
<A>__{he shoves on.}
