<A>__{high stone walls topped with snaky concertina wire, set off at intervals by looming guard towers. over a hundred cons are in the yard. playing catch, shooting craps, jawing at each other, making deals. exercise period. red emerges into fading daylight, slouches low key through the activity, worn cap on his head, exchanging hellos and doing minor business. he's an important man here.}

<D>__{there's a con like me in every prison in america, i guess. i'm the guy who can get it for you. cigarettes, a bag of reefer if you're partial, a bottle of brandy to celebrate your kid's high school graduation. damn near anything, within reason.}

<A>__{red is joined by heywood, skeet, floyd, jigger, ernie, snooze. most cons crowd to the fence to gawk and jeer, but red and his group mount the bleachers and settle in comfortably.}
