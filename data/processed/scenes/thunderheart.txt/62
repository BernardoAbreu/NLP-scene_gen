<L>__{interior yellow bird shack}
<A>__{yellow bird, in a t shirt that reveals twenty different ink tattoos, rolls himself across the warped floorboards to a cheese crate where his eye glasses sit. he puts the thick bifocals on and focuses resentfully on ray in the ochre flicker of the dirty room.}
<C>__{yellow bird}
<D>__{what ya want?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{must be a bitch getting around in that wheelchair. how long you been in it?}

<P>__{(shows a scar)}
<D>__{was sioux falls. what ya want?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{leavenworth a tough joint?}
<A>__{ray walks across the room, his eyes on a covert mission.}
<C>__{yellow bird}
<D>__{you ever try solitary confinement?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{no. can't say that i have, richard. richard do you know why i'm here?}
<C>__{yellow bird}
<D>__{washington sent ya. i know that.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yes, washington sent me, richard. they sent me here because this whole thing has been fucked. do you know what i mean when i say this whole thing has been fucked, richard?}
<A>__{yellow bird stares at ray.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{an arrangement was made between you... and us. do you remember that arrangement?}
<A>__{yellow bird looks at ray, strangely, shaking his head. ray starts to look like maybe the game's not working. like maybe this doesn't add up. but }
<C>__{yellow bird}
<D>__{i'm here, ain't i?}
<A>__{ray lets a tense breath out.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{not for long, richard. you got early parole under the stipulation that you would help us in a situation, and you didn't deliver.}
<C>__{yellow bird}
<D>__{what the fuck you talkin' about?}
<A>__{ray sits in a busted chair, reaches down to his ankle holster and pulls out a .38. he holds it, resting it on the arm of the chair. he strains to look out through the boarded window. yellow bird fidgets in his chair.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{get up out of the chair, richard.}
<C>__{yellow bird}
<D>__{what's with you people? why do ya have to fuck with my head all the time? i came through, man.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{get up out of the chair, and walk toward the backdoor, richard.}
<C>__{yellow bird}
<P>__{(not moving)}
<D>__{i get thrown in solitary until i don't know my own fuckin' name, and then you people tell me i can beat nine years if i help you. i helped you!}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{get up!}
<A>__{yellow bird stands. he takes a step forward. limping. he's got leg problems but he can walk. heels first. and bowed. but he can walk. he is shaking.}
<C>__{yellow bird}
<D>__{they said i'd never see fbi again, and i'm livin' with you fuckers. i don't feed ya information on the warriors, it's back to the pen. i don't do this, back to the pen. your word against my word. against a con indian's word. i really got a chance, man, right?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{they sent me here, richard because they said you didn't hold up your end of the arrangement, and i have to transport you back to leavenworth.}
<C>__{yellow bird}
<P>__{(crying)}
<D>__{what the fuck, man? what do you people want? i did what you wasi'cu's told me to do.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{leo fast elk... is alive.}
<A>__{yellow bird wheels.}
<C>__{yellow bird}
<D>__{no way. no fuckin' way.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{how the hell do you know?}
<C>__{yellow bird}
<D>__{i blew his back out with a buffalo gun, that's how i know! now you're gonna say i didn't, so you can throw me back in solitary?}
<A>__{ray is trying hard not to reveal his horror at this confession, at this understanding of the machinery. he sits there with his gun, blinking away sweat that beads at his brow. yellow bird is weeping in a highpitched voice that doesn't match his great bulk.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{the men who came to see you at leavenworth. the one's who made the arrangement... who were they? maybe i can talk to them.}
<C>__{yellow bird}
<D>__{miles. three other suits. that's all i know 'em as suits. were you there?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you turned leo over on his face. but the coyotes must've turned him back over, man, cuz his spirit is out. it's out, and it knows.}
<C>__{yellow bird}
<D>__{what do you know about spirits? you ain't no in'dn.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{leo knew something heavy and was trying to tell jimmy. but you must not know how serious it was or you would have delivered. do you realize what leo could have told jimmy?! do you?!}
<C>__{yellow bird}
<D>__{i took him out before he got the chance. he didn't say nothin' about tashka sha. and now his spirit is in the dirt. forever.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{what's tashka sha, speak english, speak english!}
<C>__{yellow bird}
<D>__{red deer table! what's with you, man?}
<A>__{ray grabs onto these words, rolls them silently on his lips and now yellow bird is getting suspicious of the fed.}
<C>__{yellow bird}
<D>__{wait a minute. wait what are you doin'? you ain't a fbi. you ain't the law. let me see your }
<A>__{ray snaps out his gun, straight armed.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{i'm the fucking law!}
<A>__{yellow bird jumps back, raising his hands.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{keep talking, yellow bird...}
<C>__{yellow bird}
<D>__{all i know... is i did what i did... and i ain't in solitary, gettin' pumped up with downer, gettin' beat to shit. but i tell you what, suit. take me back. cuz i can't take this shit no more.}
<A>__{and then headlights pierce the gaps in the boarded windows. yellow bird collapses against the wall, bangs his head off it. he lets a long, pained, cry escape from under his breath and he begins a slow slide down the wall, to the floor. ray peers out the cracks in the boards.}
<C>__{yellow bird}
<D>__{man, i don't know who the fuck i am no more.}
<A>__{ray gets up, putting his gun away and heading to the door. he stops and looks back at the indian, sitting on the floor, clutching his knees, staring into the kerosene flicker.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{you and me both.}
<A>__{yellow bird looks at him, his glasses foggy, his face contorted and ray leaves.}
