<L>__{exterior greenville bus station day}
<A>__{claude pulls up in front of the station, steps out of the car and holds the door for wilkins, who checks his watch.}
<C>__{wilkins}
<D>__{you know i trust you, claude.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{yes, sir.}
<C>__{wilkins}
<D>__{i will be right back.}
<A>__{wilkins heads into the station, leaving claude alone with the continental. all around him are the sights, sounds and smells of the free world. a woman rushes into the arms of a man as he climbs off a bus. across the street is grandma dodi's pork rib joint where cookie never made it to the peach cobbler. a young brother with a boom box walks by. in the street, kids crowd around the back of an ice cream truck. then claude catches his reflection in the car window and frowns. when did he get this old? unnerved, he moves around to the back of the car and pops open the trunk.}

<P>__{(sitting up)}
<D>__{damn, it was getting hot in there.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{what the hell are you doing in that trunk?!}
<C>__{ray}

<C>__{ray}
<D>__{then you're lucky i came along. doesn't take a visionary to spot a golden opportunity like this. now help me out of this trunk.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{you ain't getting out of that trunk.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{come on, man, i'm starting to cramp up here.}
<P>__{(ray struggles out of the trunk)}
<D>__{we have the chance right here, right now, i say we go!}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{go where, ray?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{back to new york for starters.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{and what will we do when we get there? i'm sixty five years old, ray. so are you. what are we gonna do out here? get married, have kids, settle down? that boat sailed without us, man.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{this boat's gonna sail without you, too. i don't care if i last one day out here. at least it's one day of freedom. now gimme those keys.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{forget about that. you run if you want to, but you're not taking this car.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{claude, man, i'm serious. give me those keys.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{i ain't spending a month in the hole so you can take a joy ride.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{don't make me take them away from you.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{hey, there's wilkins!}
<A>__{ray looks, claude clocks him. ray slumps back into the trunk. claude stuffs ray's legs back into the trunk and slams the lid.}
<C>__{claude}
<D>__{who's driving now, bitch?}
<A>__{he looks up just as wilkins and the new superintendent exit the bus station. warren pike's hair has gone grey and he's}
