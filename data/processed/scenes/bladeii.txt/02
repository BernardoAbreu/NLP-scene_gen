<A>__{potential donors sit in a waiting area, filling out forms, leafing through informational material. a sign in the window reads: "se habla espanol". others read: "you are making a difference", "give life", and "become a platelet donor". we overhear a bored looking employee behind the information desk quizzing someone over the phone:}
<C>__{employee}
<D>__{have you recently visited a tropical country? uh huh? in the past twelve months have you gotten a tattoo, non sterile acupuncture, or undergone any ear, skin or body piercing?}
<A>__{we move past the employee to nomak, waiting.}
<C>__{nurse }
<D>__{jared nomak?}
<A>__{nomak looks up. we get a better look at his face now he has a thin scar running from his lower lip down his chin. a childhood accident, perhaps. a nurse smiles and motions for him to join her. she's carrying a clipboard.}
<C>__{nurse }
<D>__{hi. we're ready for you now.}
