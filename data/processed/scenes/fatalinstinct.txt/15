<L>__{interior courtroom day}
<A>__{ned turns dramatically to face the jury.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen... i ask you... does this look like the face of a crook?}
<A>__{angle milo crumley sitting next to laura at the defense table... still wearing the panty hose over his head.}
<B>__{back to scene}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{of course it does. but the question of my client's guilt or innocence is not the issue here today. i'm certain every member of the jury can clearly see that he's guilty!}
<C>__{blind juror}
<D>__{i can't.}
<A>__{angle on ned jury's pov ned ignores this, turning to look directly at the camera as he addresses the jury... holding up a pair of nylon pantyhose.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{put yourself in his shoes. look through his eyes. see the world the way he sees it!}
<A>__{he puts the pantyhose over the lens, obscuring our view.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{things just don't look the same. it's fuzzy... and frightening!}
<A>__{new angle to include ned and jury the nylon pantyhose are draped over the frightened face of a woman juror. all the other jurors are holding up their own socks and nylon stockings, trying to peer through them. ned steps over to milo, motioning toward him.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{ladies and gentlemen... milo crumley is not the perpetrator here. he is the victim!}
<A>__{milo unwraps a piece of bubble gum and pushes it into his panty hose covered mouth, chewing the nylon and gum together.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{like all of us... this man is the unfortunate victim of these tragically difficult economic times. and what does that mean? he can't support his family!}
<A>__{ned motions toward the gallery, where we see... ...milo's wife and two children, all wearing panty hose over their faces. ned motions toward milo.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{for god's sake!... he can't even support his own face!}
<A>__{judge allen notices that milo is chewing gum.}
<C>__{judge allen}
<D>__{mr. crumley... you cannot chew gum in my courtroom... unless you have enough for everyone.}
<A>__{milo holds up a big plastic bag filled with bubble gum. judge allen grabs it, takes a piece of gum and hands it to the bailiff.}
<C>__{judge allen}
<D>__{bailiff. pass these out.}
<A>__{the bailiff takes the bag, offers one to ned... who takes a piece, unwraps it and starts chewing. the bailiff then proceeds to pass out gum to everyone in the courtroom. the jury foreman raises his hand and clears his throat.}
<C>__{judge allen}
<D>__{and don't forget the jury.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{and so, desperate and broke, with no other options before him, mr. crumley went to eleven savings & loans and did what any of you would have done. he stole back the money that the s&ls had stolen from him!}
<A>__{the courtroom erupts in cheers! judge allen raps the gavel.}
<C>__{judge allen}
<P>__{(interrupting)}
<D>__{mr. ravine... please approach the bench.}
<A>__{he does. the judge leans toward him, reaching out to cover the microphone, covering the end of the gavel instead. the judge's voice is amplified over the courtroom speakers.}
<C>__{judge allen}
<D>__{you're not running for congress here, so knock off the speeches and quit inciting these brainless morons! now pick up the pace and wrap this son of a bitch up! call your first witness.}
<A>__{ned turns... looking out over the courtroom.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i call... detective ned ravine.}
<A>__{there is a surprised gasp from the crowd... and a loud murmur. the bailiff holds out a video box. it's titled holy bible the video. ned puts one hand on it, raises the other.}
<C>__{bailiff}
<D>__{do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you god?}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i do.}
<A>__{ned sits down... then gets up, his demeanor changing.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{detective ravine, at the time of the arrest, did you read the defendant his miranda rights?}
<A>__{he slips back into the witness box.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{of course. that's standard procedure.}
<A>__{ned steps over to arch, who is sitting in the first row of the gallery. arch hands him the miranda "cue cards."}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{are these the cards officer brooks used to prompt you while reading mr. crumley his rights?}
<A>__{he lays them on the corner of the stand... then slips into the chair. he picks the cards up and flips thru them. on the back we can see scribbled... "ned's idiot cards"}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{yeah. these are them.}
<A>__{ned jumps to his feet, pacing dramatically, grabbing the cards.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{reading from the cards now... quote "you have the right to remain silent, if you waive that right, anything you say... may be used against you in a court of law." is that right?}
<C>__{ned}
<P>__{(back in the chair)}
<D>__{that's right.}
<C>__{ned}
<P>__{(stands up, announces)}
<D>__{wrong! the official miranda warning is... "anything you say can be used against you in a court of law." not "may"... "can!"}
<P>__{(on the attack)}
<D>__{don't you know the difference between "can" and "may", detective? every school kid knows "can" is a verb that indicates ability to perform, while "may" is a verbal auxiliary indicating the permission to act.}
<A>__{ned pivots into the witness stand, changing his attitude from aggressive attorney to defensive, angry witness as he hits the chair.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i didn't have time to worry about past participles or interrogative pronouns! i was trying to protect society from a deranged madman!}
<P>__{(leaps up, pointing)}
<D>__{but this ivy league fop...!!!}
<A>__{the courtroom erupts! the judge bangs the gavel. ned strides proudly toward the defense table.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i have no more use for this witness.}
<C>__{judge allen}
<D>__{mr. ravine...}
<A>__{ned turns. the judge motions with a finger for ned to approach the bench. ned does, resting his hand on it.}
<C>__{judge allen}
<D>__{i'm dismissing this case on the grounds of improper grammar.}
<A>__{the judge smacks ned's hand with a ruler!}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{ow!}
<C>__{prosecutor}
<P>__{(jumps up)}
<D>__{but your honor...!}
<C>__{judge allen}
<D>__{i know, i know. it's a technicality. but it's the kind of technicality that makes the american legal system what it is today! court's adjourned!}
<A>__{the judge mistakenly picks up the microphone and whacks it on the bench like a gavel. bam! bam! bam! it is deafening! everyone covers their ears in pain. the thx sound system logo appears at the bottom of the screen... along with "the courtroom is listening"}
