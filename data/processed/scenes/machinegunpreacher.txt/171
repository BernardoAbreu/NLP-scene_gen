<L>__{interior sam's tukul children's orphanage night}
<A>__{... sam hearing the soft chorus drift across the compound... somehow finding comfort in it too... blowing out the lamp and laying here in the dark... listening to the children sing.}
<L>__{exterior children's orphanage early morning}
<A>__{a slow dissolve... life springing up in the camp... daylight breaking... a routine seen here... betty, rose and the other camp women arriving at the orphanage... cooking fires being lit... soldiers drinking cups of strong coffee, warming themselves after a long night... ... and sam coming out of his tukul carrying his duffle bag... discovering william curled up next to his door, sleeping on a mat in the dirt... been there all night. william stirring awake, seeing sam above him and scrambling to his feet.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{mornin, buddy.}
<A>__{william, no response. just staring up at him.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{ain't you gonna say nuthin?}
<A>__{william, nothing.}
<C>__{sam }
<D>__{ok then.}
<A>__{and sam walks across the compound followed by william a few paces behind... and he reaches deng, betty, nineteen, and a few of the other volunteers waiting by the truck...}
<C>__{deng}
<P>__{(meaning william)}
<D>__{looks like you've got yourself a bodyguard.}
