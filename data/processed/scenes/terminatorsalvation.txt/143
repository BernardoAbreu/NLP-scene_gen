<L>__{interior laboratory night}
<A>__{the engineer as we saw him before, consulting the monitors above the chambers.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{32581 looks good... 32582... hm, borderline. may not be emotionally compatible. pass.}
<A>__{the engineer picks up star's baseball cap and flings it into the trash... just then he hears shattering glass behind him. he spins marcus trains a ripped off robotic laser arm at him like a weapon. the arm trails heavy cables and circuits, linking it to the operating theater we saw earlier. (these also artfully conceal marcus' nakedness.)}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{let them go.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{what? who are you?}
<A>__{marcus takes a step closer.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{i said, let them go!}
<A>__{the engineer moves to a red alarm button on a communication panel mounted in the wall, extending a hand marcus connects two wires to fire up the laser and a red beam neatly severs the engineer's hand at his wrist. the engineer studies the metal stump of his severed hand with a blank expression.}
<C>__{engineer}
<D>__{you can't hurt me.}
<A>__{the engineer smirks and whacks the alarm button with his other hand. an electronic klaxon sounds.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{now you're pissing me off.}
<A>__{marcus fires off the laser again the engineer stares at him we see a flaming strip in the wall behind his head. he takes a step toward marcus and his head tumbles off, bounces on the ground, and rolls to marcus' feet. (there's no blood, just laser severed electronic connections). marcus picks up the engineer's head by the hair. the man's brain is unharmed.}
<C>__{marcus }
<D>__{how'd that feel?}
<A>__{the man's mouth twists and grimaces, making electronic static from the fried voicebox. marcus is taken by surprise when the decapitated body lunges at him, knocks the laser from his grasp. after a brief struggle, marcus spins the engineer's head to face his body. he grabs the interface at the base of his neck.}
<C>__{marcus }
<D>__{i pull this off and you'll be in a world of pain!}
<A>__{the engineer's face suddenly shows fear his body freezes.}
<C>__{marcus }
<D>__{last chance. let them out.}
<A>__{at a control terminal, the one handed, headless body taps keys and controls. marcus holds the engineer's head so that he can see over his own shoulder. moments later the machine hum winds down. the monitors flash the word "abort," the panels begin to open. marcus addresses the head in his hand.}
<C>__{marcus }
<D>__{i'm gonna need your clothes.}
<A>__{the headless body begins to unbutton its shirt. moments later close as kyle's tray slides out of his chamber. the restraints retract automatically. he sits up, looking toward star, on the next tray. she hasn't moved, her eyes closed.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{no!}
<A>__{he climbs off his tray, takes her in his arms. she starts awake.}
<C>__{star}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{around them, the dozen other prisoners are getting to their feet, surprised at their sudden freedom. marcus approaches kyle, buttoning his new shirt.}
<C>__{kyle}
<D>__{marcus!}
<A>__{the two kids hurry to him, marcus hands star her baseball cap, rescued from the trash. as she puts it on:}
<C>__{star}
<D>__{i knew you'd come.}
<A>__{the prisoners are already on the move, frantically dashing out of the lab ahead of our heros.}
<C>__{marcus}
<D>__{we've gotta get out of here.}
<A>__{he leads the kids out the way he came, passing... the engineer, in underwear, sitting in a corner, cradling his head in his lap. his remaining hand strokes his interface, his eyes closed in a blissful expression.}
