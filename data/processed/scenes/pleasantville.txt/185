<L>__{interior jail cell. night.}
<A>__{david sits on his bunk staring at the ceiling. the place has never been used so there is still plastic wrapping on all the sheets and pillow cases. he can't help smiling.}
<L>__{interior different jail cell. way off down the hall ...}
<A>__{mr. johnson crouches on his bunk, ignoring his food. he clutches a rusty nail and scratches at the plaster wall in true "inmate" fashion.}
<B>__{reverse angle. wall.}
<A>__{rather than scratching the days or even the hours, mr. johnson has carved a huge pastoral landscape into the wall complete with lush forest and a running brook. he looks at his work and smiles.}
<B>__{shot. police chief.}
<A>__{he approaches david's cell from the other direction and knocks gently on the bars. david turns around.}
<C>__{dan}
<D>__{there's someone to see you bud.}
<B>__{david.}
<A>__{david sits upright on his bunk trying to think who it could be. after a moment or two, a strange look of understanding crosses his face. he hears the sound of a key turning in the lock. david looks up at the doorway and smiles.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i thought it might be you.}
<B>__{reverse angle. dick van dyke.}
<A>__{he stands in the doorway, still dressed in his tv repairman's outfit. for the first time, he is completely in black and}
<B>__{white.}
<C>__{dick van dyke}
<D>__{hope you're proud of yourself.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i am actually ... glad to see you've finally shown your true colors.}
<A>__{dick van dyke gives a tight smile and shuts the door of the cell behind him.}
<C>__{dick van dyke}
<D>__{okay, let's cut the shit and get right to it. where's that remote control?}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{dick van dyke}
<D>__{because you're coming home.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{why don't you just take me back without it?}
<C>__{dick van dyke}
<D>__{oh. you're a smart little bastard aren't you?}
<P>__{(tightly)}
<D>__{it's kind of like a restricted ticket. you gotta leave the same way you came.}
<A>__{david just looks at him. he smiles, confidently. leans back on the bunk ...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{so ... i guess as long as i'm here, all sorts of things could happen to this place. we could have pink lawns and blue trees ...}
<C>__{dick van dyke}
<D>__{just gimme the damn remote!}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i'm sorry. i can't do that.}
<A>__{dick van dyke takes a deep breath. he glances toward the barred window.}
<C>__{dick van dyke}
<D>__{i don't know what went wrong. you answered every question. you knew every detail. the senior prom ... mcintire's department store. we had all the same warm memories: sock hops. the church social ...}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{they weren't my memories.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i borrowed them. it's no good when you borrow them.}
<A>__{dick van dyke's eyes go wide and he literally starts to tremble.}
<C>__{dick van dyke}
<P>__{(containing his rage)}
<D>__{how long do you think you've been here?}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(warily)}
<D>__{i don't know ... three, four weeks.}
<C>__{dick van dyke}
<D>__{much less than that.}
<P>__{(checks his watch)}
<D>__{an hour and a half.}
<A>__{david looks at him uneasily. dick van dyke flashes a broad nasty smile.}
<C>__{dick van dyke }
<D>__{see and this is really great the show was on for what half an hour a week? so that means for every week that goes by in pleasantville, only half an hour goes by in the real world.}
<A>__{the smile gets bigger. dick van dyke moves closer to him.}
<C>__{dick van dyke }
<D>__{now buddy, you're going on trial tomorrow. and if they find you guilty, you're gonna be stuck here forever. well, not forever lemme think ...}
<P>__{(calculates)}
<D>__{five year sentence ... carry the three ... that comes out to ... sixteen and a half centuries, and that's rounding down.}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{i'm going on trial tomorrow?}
<C>__{dick van dyke}
<D>__{this is tv pal. they don't fool around.}
<A>__{david is rocked but tries not to show it.}
<C>__{david}
<P>__{(stoicly)}
<D>__{there's worse places.}
<C>__{dick van dyke}
<D>__{oh sure. for the first hundred years. then it starts to get a little monotonous.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{sleep well.}
<A>__{he taps on the bars for dan who opens the lock and lets him out. the door clangs shut as the two of them disappear down the hall. the minute they are gone, the stoicism falls. david looks around his cell, truly afraid.}
<B>__{closer.}
<A>__{he stares at the tiny cot ... the plain light bulb in the ceiling ... the single pillow with the plastic covering it ... forever is starting to look like a long time. david crosses to the small window and looks out.}
<B>__{his pov. out the window.}
<A>__{across the town square he can see the side of the town hall complete with the newly painted mural. the "utopian" view of pleasantville is just as he left it with one notable exception: the edges of painting are starting to turn back to}
<B>__{black and white.}
