<A>__{two guardia troop carriers race past, sirens screaming, loaded with guardia soldiers. claire steps into the street unsurely, looking every direction. people begin coming out of their homes and what remains of their small homes. they come one at a time at first, then in small groups, carrying belongings, pets, chickens, etc. claire shows a picture of price and her to a woman who comes out of the house next to jazy's, but the woman shakes her head, not recognizing price. a push pull plane dives in low firing rockets at the homes. the crowd grows and chaotically flees the destruction, gradually finding a direction out of the city. claire is swept along in the crowds, at first without choice, then finally fleeing for her life with the rest of managua. as she moves with the crowd, she looks for price everywhere, without success.}
