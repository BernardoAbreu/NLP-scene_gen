<A>__{that's when the helicopter crashes. the pilot does everything but flap his arms forget it. it keels over. rotor touches pavement blows to pieces. they all go. snapped off. blown like rockets in every direction. timothy looks up as a rotor blade whistles right through the windshield of his car. shears off his head. blows out the back in a shower of glass and hurtles onward, spinning out of control... strikes the tanker. boom. imagine god in monte carlo. tossing dice the length of a craps table. now, imagine the dice are burning cars.}
