<A>__{jimmy is filming the both of them in the mirror. judy stands above him with noticeably different hair. she has obviously given herself a homemade dye job, complete with blonde, black and punk pink streaks. judy has an electric clipper and is about to shave jimmy's head, who is sitting in a chair below her. she's really getting off on this and chuckles as she starts to lower the shaver to his head.}
