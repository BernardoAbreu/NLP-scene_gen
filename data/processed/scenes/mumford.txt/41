<A>__{lily is walking ainge as the mercedes pulls up and mumford gets out. ainge runs happily around the car and puts his paws up on the driver's door to greet martin; we hear the clicking scratch of his nails on the surface. martin rubs the dog's head.}

<D>__{not that i care. i've had it with men. they're so fascinated by their own crap. took me four years to get the last one out. almost turned me into a dyke... these days my idea of a hot date is a long shower by myself before bed. now that feels good. and you don't have to do all that... listening.}
