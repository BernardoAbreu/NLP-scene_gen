<L>__{exterior bow night}
<A>__{they stroll out onto the moonlit bow of the ship.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{who is that man? you avoided him earlier on the deck.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{i don't know, but he's carrying a knife up his sleeve and wearing a cape. do me a favor and steer clear of him.}
<A>__{a waltz drifts through the air from a band unseen.}
<D>__{bloom (cont'd) (cont'd) i don't suppose in all your hobby acquiring you ever learned how to dance?}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{i went through a phase when i was mildly obsessed with the bolero.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{give me a minute.}
<A>__{he leaves her alone. clouds obscure the moon, shadows deepen. she shivers. a match strikes. she jumps. the moon re emerges, and she is no longer alone on the deck. the curator lights a dapper briar pipe, shakes out the match.}
<C>__{the curator}
<D>__{mademoiselle.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{monsieur.}
<C>__{the curator}
<P>__{(in french, subtitled)}
<D>__{i didn't mean to startle you.}
<C>__{penelope}
<P>__{(in french, subtitled)}
<D>__{yes you did.}
<C>__{the curator}
<P>__{(in french, subtitled)}
<D>__{apologies, but the deck was dark, and i had to approach.}
<P>__{(english)}
<D>__{it's been such a time since i've encountered the brothers bloom.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{you're in antiques?}
<C>__{the curator}
<P>__{(cheshire grin)}
<D>__{antiques. i wonder, my dear, if you know the true nature of the men you travel with?}
<A>__{the band strikes up a bolero. the curator flicks his wrist, and a long thin blade falls into his hand.}
<C>__{the curator }
<D>__{a little fear might suit you, i think.}
<A>__{he raises the blade... it is in fact a fine mustache brush, which he delicately employs.}
<C>__{the curator }
<D>__{bon soir, ma cherie.}
<A>__{with that the curator backs into the shadows, and is gone. moments later bloom trots up to her, oblivious.}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{it isn't a spanish band, but they'll do their best.}
<A>__{he hands her a single blood red rose. she puts it in her teeth, and they dance. if there is a tinge of tension in the air, the bolero suits it. the moon ducks behind a cloud once more, and they dance on in the dark.}
