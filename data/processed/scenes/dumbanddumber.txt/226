<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior presidential suite a few minutes later}
<A>__{harry is sitting beside lloyd and mary on the bed. nicholas andre keeps his gun trained on them while he speaks on the phone:}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{..i want a one way ticket to rio de janerio departing as soon as possible...}
<A>__{on the bed harry and lloyd can't look each other in the eye.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you mean you two know each other?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(cutting)}
<D>__{yeah, we used to be best friends.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{until he turned into a backstabber.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{me a backstabber? you got a lot of nerve. i saw her first.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{hey, i couldn't help it if she found me irresistable.}
<A>__{mary rolls her eyes at this.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{but you knew how crazy i was about her.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah, and you knew how crazy i was about fraida felcher, but that didn't stop you, did it?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(waning righteousness)}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{don't deny it, lloyd. fraida told me the whole sordid story.}
<A>__{lloyd can't muster a defense.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{look... i was gonna tell you about that. it was gonna be mentioned at the reading of my will. i swear, you can ask my lawyer.}
<A>__{harry glares at him.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{well i guess we both learned a little something about each other, didn't we?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{you said it, pal. maybe we're not as good friends as we thought we were.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{guess not.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{i mean, if one beautiful girl could rip us apart like this, then it seems our friendship isn't worth a damn.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{maybe we should call it quits right here.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{just tell me where to sign, bud.}
<A>__{suddenly they hear the metallic click clack of a gun being}
<B>__{cocked.}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{okay, which one of you losers wants to die first?}
<A>__{the guys exchange a look and swallow hard.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{i wouldn't pull that trigger if i were you.}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{why not? it'll look like just another aspen love triangle. you caught the two of them in bed, handcuffed them to the post, murdered them, and killed yourself.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(smug)}
<D>__{except you're forgetting one minor etail.}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{what's that?}
<A>__{lloyd and mary look at harry, hopeful.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{if you kill us, you'd be killing yourself.}
<C>__{andre}
<P>__{(puzzled)}
<D>__{huh?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you see, philosophers believe that we're all really just tiny pieces of one huge universal being. in other words, i am you and you are me, so if you were to kill us you'd be committing suicide, you unenlightened}
<A>__{idiot }
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{ shut up!}
<A>__{mary sees that they're in deep shit now.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{what about my husband? did you kill him, too?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{husband? what husband?}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{mary's married, harry.}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{no need to worry about melvin.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{now this is the last time i will ask: who wants to die first?}
<A>__{harry gestures with his head at mary.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{kill her. the bitch should've told him she was married back at the airport. it would've saved us a lot of trouble.}
<A>__{andre points the gun at mary.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{no, i will go first, harry. i was the one who got you into this mess.}
<A>__{andre points the gun at lloyd.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no, wait, do me first. i'm the one who stole your girl, lloyd. i eserve it.}
<A>__{andre sighs and points the gun at harry. then, as mary and lloyd look on in horror, he fires twice. harry grabs his stomach and falls off the bed to the floor.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{jesus christ! you killed my best friend, you bastard!}
<A>__{andre smiles.}
<C>__{andre}
<D>__{if it's any consolation, you're about to be reunited.}
<A>__{he aims the gun at lloyd, cocks the trigger. suddenly, a shot rings out and the gun is blown out of andre's hand. on the floor harry is very much alive and pointing a pistol at the stunned nicholas andre.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<D>__{harry! you're alive!}
<A>__{just them, the door bursts open and several police officers storm in with their weapons drawn.}
<D>__{cop #1 get your hands up, asshole!}
<A>__{lloyd and harry throw their hands into the air. a stunned andre turns to see six guns pointing at his head. he reluctantly raises his hands. mary and lloyd are flabbergasted by the turn of events. there's a sudden commotion in the room. pushing her way through the mass of cops comes the athletic beauty. she flashes an id.}
<C>__{athletic beauty}
<D>__{special officer kathryn frick. federal bureau of investigation.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(dumbstruck)}
<D>__{you gotta be kidding.}
<C>__{athletic beauty}
<D>__{good work, harry.}
<A>__{lloyd looks to his friend, confused. harry opens his shirt, revealing a bullet proof vest.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{she grabbed me down in the lobby and explained what was up. they slapped this on me and gave me a gun.}
<C>__{lloyd}
<P>__{(to athletic beauty)}
<D>__{but how did you...?}
<C>__{athletic beauty}
<D>__{we've been following you two all the way from providence. mr. and mrs. swanson had a homing device plated in the briefcase.}
<A>__{the guys glance guiltily at one another.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{yeah, about that dough...}
<C>__{athletic beauty}
<D>__{every bill was counterfeit and marked.}
<A>__{harry and lloyd exhale a sigh of relief.}
