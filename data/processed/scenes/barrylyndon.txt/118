<D>__{thus is will be seen that our life, for all its splendor was one of extreme difficulty and danger, requiring high talents and courage for success, and sudden and unexpected departures.}
<A>__{they meet a four wheel carriage, drawn by two horses, carrying a master and a servant. the driver of the four wheel carriage wants roderick's driver to make way for him. roderick's driver protests that if he does, he will upset his master in the ditch, but the other insists. roderick addresses the master, a handsome young man, and asks him to order his driver to make way for him.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{i am posting, monsieur, and furthermore i am a foreigner.}
<C>__{stranger}
<D>__{monsieur, here in saxony, the post has no special right, and if you are a foreigner, you must admit that you have no greater claim than mine, since i am in my own country.}
<A>__{at that, roderick gets out and holding his drawn sword tells the stranger to get out, or to make way for him. the stranger replies, with a smile, that he has no sword and that, in any case, he will not fight for such a silly reason. he tells roderick to get back in his chaise, and he makes way for him.}
