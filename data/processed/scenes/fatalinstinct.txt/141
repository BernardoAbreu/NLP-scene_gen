<A>__{ned enters, pausing. he hears voices. he goes to the living room. lana and lola turn to see him in the doorway. he is shocked. lana looks shaken. but lola is cool... in control.}

<D>__{oh... uh, ned... this is lola, um...}
<C>__{ned}
<P>__{(nervous, defensive)}
<D>__{um? she told you her name was um? and what other lies did she tell you? i've never seen this woman in my life! never followed her home! never had sex with her in the refrigerator! it's all a sick fantasy... and i deny everything!}
<A>__{he turns to lola.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{when will women like you learn, you can't tear apart a perfectly good marriage with your vicious lies... miss ummmm!}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{actually... it's smith. lola smith. i sell vacuum cleaners, mr. ravine. the big powerful kind that suck up everything in sight. i was just telling your wife, if she wants to get rid of all her dirt, she has to be willing to pay the price.}
<A>__{she turns to lana with a cold and contemptuous glare.}
<C>__{lola}
<D>__{let me know what you decide, mrs. ravine. i'm sure we can work out a convenient "payment" plan. a pleasure meeting you... ned.}
<A>__{lola exits. as soon as the door closes, lana whirls around in a fury!... smashing a lamp! she shrieks furiously!}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{i... hate... salesmen!}
<A>__{he puts his arms around her, comforting.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{i know it's been a tough ordeal... with the trial and everything. tell you what... let's take a trip.}
<C>__{lana}
<D>__{a trip?}

<D>__{yeah. just the two of us.}
<C>__{lana}
<P>__{(darkly inspired)}
<D>__{i like that. just you and me... all alone. i will start packing.}
<C>__{ned}
<D>__{great. listen... i got something to take care of. i will be back in awhile.}
<A>__{he kisses her and exits. lana turns to look up toward the landing, a vengefully insane smile clouding her face.}
