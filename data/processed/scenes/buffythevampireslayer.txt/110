<A>__{buffy sparring with merrick again. she holds a stake. this time she ends up pinning him, the stake at his solar plexus. he moves the point to where his heart would be.}

<L>__{interior pike's bedroom night}
<A>__{the room is a shambles. outside the first floor window, it is dark night. "help yourself" by the posies blasts from pike's stereo. pike lies on his bed. through the window we see benny approach, slowly fading up to the pane. he's floating, really. (he's a vampire.) he scrapes his fingers on the glass.}

<D>__{pike...}
<A>__{pike sits up, turns down the music. he goes to the window, begins to try to open it. it's stuck.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{benny, man, where you been? you bailed on me, i passed out, man, i almost did a jimi hendrix!}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{let me in.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{hey, i'm trying, but this window is burnt }
<A>__{pike gets a good look at benny for the first time.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{invite me in, pike.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{wait a minute. what's wrong with you, man?}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{i'm fine.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{you look like shit, benny.}
<A>__{benny grins, presses his slimy forehead against the glass.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{i... feel.... pretty.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{no offense, man, but i think you're on something nasty. why don't you just go and cool out and i will see you in the morning or something.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{the sun! it burns! it burns!}
<A>__{he laughs at his impression, brown spittle caking the window.}
<C>__{benny}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{let me in, pike! i'm hungry!}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{get away from here.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{i'm hungry.}
<C>__{pike}
<D>__{i mean it.}
<A>__{benny smiles, moves suddenly out of sight. pike looks at the window for a second, then bolts out of his room. he runs to the front door, frantically hooks the chain. benny appears at the door's little window, banging and scraping the glass.}
<C>__{benny}
<D>__{i'm hungry! i'm hungry! i'm hungry!}
<A>__{pike backs away.}
