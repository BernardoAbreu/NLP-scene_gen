<L>__{exterior union station ballroom day}
<A>__{bethune campaign fundraiser turned victory bash. big smiles beam above sunburned double chins. bethune the nucleus of a press circle jerk. i weave around, lack of sleep and a miserably wrinkled suit make me look like something dug up.}
<D>__{reporter #1 councilman bethune, was mr. diskant dropping out the only way you could have won this race?}
<C>__{tom bethune}
<D>__{not at all. my message of civic advancement manifested in that beautiful blue baseball team was starting to hit home.}
<A>__{bethune's beam twitches when he sees me weaving past. give him a quick nod, get nothing back: he can't be seen this close to the turd in the punch bowl. moving by:}
<D>__{reporter #3 anything you'd like to say to future constituents?}
<C>__{tom bethune}
<D>__{i like my dodger dogs with mustard and relish!}
<A>__{bradley at one of the front tables confabbing with da gas chamber bob gallaudet. as i aim their way, one of my favorite men aims at me, wearing this great white grin: fritz koenig.}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{fritz koenig. german born. former us spymaster, current head of the lapd's intelligence division. he and bradley in the middle of their own cold war each fighting to be the second most important member of the lapd behind chief parker.}
<C>__{koenig}
<D>__{these functions aren't normally open to jews.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{someone with your accent should never be allowed to say `jew' again.}
<C>__{koenig}
<D>__{that accent allowed me to execute many a nazi.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{then we're both traitors: ellis island said grandpa's `kleinsasser' was two syllables too long.}
<C>__{koenig}
<D>__{i wouldn't have expected so public a showing after sanderline johnson.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{he jumped fritz.}
<A>__{koenig flashes that grin again.}
<C>__{koenig}
<D>__{i'm sure he did. and where is your young partner this day?}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{working his first big job.}
<C>__{koenig}
<D>__{might the job involve the lapd's most important missing wetback, hector magdalena?}
<A>__{my eyes narrow but stay smiling:}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{it does.}
<A>__{koenig nods, casts his gaze out over the crowd.}
<C>__{koenig}
<D>__{i've known stemmons since the academy. he was a top pupil. a peculiar little pain in the ass, but very good with details.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{kid might have some climb in him.}
<P>__{(look back at bradley)}
<D>__{reminds me of another pain in the ass.}
<A>__{koenig roars this big frightening laugh of his.}
<C>__{koenig}
<D>__{i'm puzzled as to why the bradley would assign you to the magdalena case when you're neither homicide nor robbery...}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{there's no body, and nothing was taken except hector.}
<C>__{koenig}
<D>__{he does know how to delegate doesn't he...and also i'm sure that poor negro's nosedive has put you squarely in his debt.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{something like that.}
<C>__{koenig}
<D>__{keep me abreast will you? chief parker is understandably nervous. situations like these tend to yield grief...and we've the fbi poking around our garden patch.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{my ass first fritz, yours second.}
<A>__{koenig's big laugh again. moving toward bradley now. then flashbulbs pop blind. panic: snapping pix of me? relief: not me. hollywood types: this buff mcman meat type and her. i go slack inches from the press that yesterday wanted to roll in my guts...but now they're just as entranced with her as i am. she and mcman meat continue past as i stare, she answers his questions for him. i think her eyes see mine. then i realize where i'm standing. bradley waiting. focused on me and not her god damned eunuch. i step over, speak without preface:}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{tommy magdalena has gone to ground and he's got a war chest to keep him there. the only way we take him quickly is to issue a citywide apb }
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{ no. we can't risk that. do you make him for the murderer?}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{yeah. hector's disappearance is definitely an inside job. that whole family feels hinky. the daughter was all bruises and no tears and hector's hop head wife looks part punching bag.}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{do you suspect either of the women?}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{according to wilhite, they were in santa barbara at the time.}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{verify that. where is your partner?}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{vouching in evidence at wilshire station.}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{keep him on that. he had excellent ratings as an evidence teacher and i trust him more than you.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{find tommy magdalena. focus everything on that effort & i want him apprehended klein, not killed.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{what about hector? still missing.}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{and most likely dead. find the son. stakeout the residence. put tails on both the mother and daughter i want this investigation working quietly, and around the clock.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{and what do we do if hector turns up?}
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{if he's alive, bring him to me. if he's dead, have him john doe'd at the morgue until noonan can be drawn off and this fbi situation sorted out.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{wilhite. he was operating hector }
<C>__{bradley}
<D>__{ don't worry about dan wilhite. you deal directly with me. now go out the back. i don't want the press recognizing you.}
<A>__{swallow my sneer. push through the service doors. hard. headed back toward the kitchen, an exit sign. i pass an alcove: her. alone. smoke break. beauty you almost never get to examine up close. i stop, stammer, she gives me a once over, thinks i'm a reporter...}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{you got a light?}
<C>__{woman}
<P>__{(searches my empty hands)}
<D>__{you got a cigarette?}
<A>__{i fumble for a chesterfield. she pulls a zippo slow.}
<C>__{woman }
<D>__{if you snap a picture of me, i get to set you on fire. fair?}
<A>__{i smile too wide fuck. i kill it, try to gather up the bits of `cool' that shattered with the sophomore smile.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{it didn't look like you were all that upset with the attention.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{good thing you're not a cop.}
<C>__{me}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{how's that?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{your power of observation leaves lots to be desired.}
<A>__{lights my cigarette. i hold it in my mouth to hide shaking hands.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{thank you.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{don't thank me: these things are bad for you.}
<C>__{me}
<D>__{you believe everything you read?}
<A>__{stubs her cigarette.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{you believe anything you read?}
<A>__{she starts walking back the way i came.}
<C>__{me}
<P>__{(hail mary)}
<D>__{do you eat dinner?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{i can't stop watching her, even after she pushes back through the double doors, re entering the fray head first. i step after her. a reporter finally makes me. random catcalls of `klein! `hey, enforcer!' shutterbugs beeline my way, firing flashbulbs from the hip. close the door quick and bolt.}
<C>__{me }
<D>__{make a note: steal bethune's guest list, then go door to door until you find her again.}
