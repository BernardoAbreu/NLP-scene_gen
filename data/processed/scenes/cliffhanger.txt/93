<L>__{exterior treasury plane crash site day}
<A>__{davis has just filled in wright on the "unconfirmed" distress call. wright looks furious.}
<C>__{wright}
<D>__{he didn't think a distress call from a crashed plane was "important"?}
<P>__{(davis nods)}
<D>__{get me a fucking radio! now!}
<L>__{exterior helicopter}
<A>__{flying over the mountains.}
<L>__{interior helicopter}
<A>__{frank is practically there, heading toward the buttress and the facing tower.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(over radio)}
<D>__{come in, maggie, over }
<C>__{kristel }
<P>__{(over radio "weak")}
<D>__{alpha charlie niner please help }
<A>__{frank recognizes the pilot's voice from the "distress call".}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(over radio)}
<D>__{i copy, charlie niner what's your position over }
<A>__{an aerial flare fires up, leaving a clear marker.}
<C>__{frank}
<P>__{(over radio)}
<D>__{sit tight, charlie niner i'm right on top of you.}
<A>__{gabe and maggie at the crack's edge gabe is still unravelling the rope fiber it's three different segments wound together. the helicopter flies overhead and past.}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(shouting, waving)}
<D>__{frank! down here! frank!}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{forget about it. he can't hear you.}
<P>__{(hands maggie some rope)}
<D>__{tie these together. tight.}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(realizing)}
<D>__{ are you out of your mind }
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{this is rope from the gordon exhibit. the way guys climbed then, they'd tie on three at a time this rope'll take around nine hundred pounds.}
<C>__{maggie}
<D>__{gabe this rope is sixty years old }
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(misses the point)}
<D>__{yeah, they made it pretty good then. each of these strands ought to hold about 300 pounds before snapping.}
<A>__{gabe rapidly ties the rope to the piton maggie works on the third connecting knot as she does the mental calculation of what she and gabe weigh together.}
<C>__{maggie}
<P>__{(dazed)}
<D>__{ought to. about.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{will it hold?}
<A>__{gabe takes the line from her and lets it drop. ninety feet of what looks like twine.}
<C>__{gabe}
<D>__{depends on how big a breakfast you had. you want to go first?}
<A>__{maggie's stunned but there's no choice. she starts the rappel down, and gabe is close behind. insert the third bomb is ready to blow 0:12 0:11 maggie and gabe rappelling down to make this even trickier, they have to swing over to the side about fifteen feet to get to the cave meaning they have to move down in pendulum type swings that put even more pressure on}
<B>__{the rope}
<A>__{which looks sorely tested at one knot it's coming undone maggie and gabe rappelling they swing down lower twenty feet to the cave, four thousand to the ground insert the bomb 0:04 0:03 maggie and gabe rappelling they reach the end of the rope six feet above the cave and fifteen feet away laterally.}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{swing towards it and drop!}
<A>__{maggie nods they start the swing over as they get over the cave's lip }
<B>__{the rope}
<A>__{snaps }
<B>__{maggie and gabe}
<A>__{fall, landing roughly on the cave's narrow lip gabe starts to slip over, but maggie pulls him back as }
<B>__{above on the wall}
<A>__{the bomb detonates and starts raining debris an instant, massive rockslide }
<B>__{maggie and gabe}
<A>__{dive into the small cave as the rockslide tumbles past exhausted, they collapse on the cave floor. the helicopter over the tower frank, obviously, is surprised by the nearby explosion.}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{what the fuck }
<A>__{but he sees kristel in a clearing. face down in the snow. first things first.}
