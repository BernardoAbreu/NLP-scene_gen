<L>__{exterior andy's house front yard driveway day}
<A>__{joan, accompanied by duke, moves down the driveway to a mailbox in front of the broken gates. she pauses to lavish the dog with an exuberant display of affection and finds herself intimidated as he responds by leaping about and barking joyously:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{alright now, don't play too rough.}
<A>__{the excitement has unleashed duke's libido and as she tries to resume her mission, he makes a few attempts to rise against her flanks. just before she approaches the mailbox, he manages to grip his paws around one of her thighs and unmistakably begins to hump her:}
<C>__{joan}
<D>__{no, no, duke, don't do that, that's not nice. now sitz. and behave yourself.}
<A>__{he sits, panting, with a furtive expression on his face, watching as she steps over to the mailbox and opens it. she takes out a number of letters and sorts through them as she starts back to the house with duke following. they are in the main addressed to andy, but in amongst them she finds a bank statement addressed to her, as well as a letter with her name written in pencil on the envelope. she opens it, takes the contents out and stops suddenly: close on joan's hand holding a woodcut with a foxed edge revealing it was torn from the pages of a book. it is of a woman kneeling with her head on the block, while above her a hooded executioner stands with an ax in his hand.}
