<A>__{a big room lined with books. three french doors lead out to a balcony. she walks a few paces in... the door shuts behind her, she whirls... gabor, propped up behind the door, stares, wide eyed, before he falls to the floor. elektra gasps, she turns again... a dark figure looms, a shadow against the windows. he moves forward, his face becoming visible...it's bond.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{james!}
<A>__{she stares at him, shocked, hesitant.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{you look surprised.}
<A>__{she moves to gabor, gets down to help him. he stirs, he is alive, but unconscious. elektra looks up at bond.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{what's wrong with you? are you crazy?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{a little. does it matter? after all, what's the point of living if you can't feel alive? isn't that right, elektra? isn't that your motto?}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{or did you steal it from your old friend renard?}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{...what?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{we had a run in, he and i. he knew about us, he knew about my shoulder, he knew exactly where to hurt me...}
<A>__{elektra stands...she begins to tremble.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{are you saying...renard is the man who's trying to kill me?}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{you can drop the act, it's over.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{i don't know what you're talking about!}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{i think you do.}
<A>__{he walks toward her, threatening...}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{at mi 6 we call it stockholm syndrome. it's common in kidnappings. a young impressionable victim. sheltered, sexually inexperienced. a powerful kidnapper skilled in torture, in manipulation. something snaps in the victim's mind. the captive falls in love with her captor.}
<A>__{at the word "love," elektra explodes. she slaps an unsuspecting bond hard across the face.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{how dare you! how dare you! that animal!? that monster!? he disgusts me! you disgust me! so he knew where to hurt you, is that it? you had a sling on your arm at the funeral! i didn't have to sleep with you to find that out.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{he used your exact words.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{you knew. you knew all the time, that he was out there, that he was coming for me, and you lied. you used me, you used me as bait. you made love to me what, to pass the time as you waited for him to strike?}
<A>__{he has no answer. he can't deny what she says. the phone rings, cuts through the tension. bond and elektra staring at one another. she lets it ring... then picks up. listens, looks to bond.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{he's struck again.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{five men are dead at the pipeline.}
<A>__{he moves toward her.}
<C>__{bond}
<D>__{i'm coming with you.}
<C>__{elektra}
<D>__{you do what you have to do, but i've called in m. she's en route from london even now.}
