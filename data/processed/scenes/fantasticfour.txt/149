<A>__{sue sifts through a cabinet full of medications. the lights dim. power failure. she looks up...}
<L>__{exterior club night}
<A>__{johnny walks alone. a wave of light spreads through the sky. he looks up. his eyes adjust to the blast, as he realizes where it's coming from. he starts running toward the baxter.}
<L>__{interior baxter building reversion lab night}
<A>__{inside the machine, the red cloud swirls with debris, crackling with light. the chamber rattles dangerously, as the power seems to shake the very foundation of the building. and then it's over. the light dies down...somewhat. it still pulses along with the chamber. the chamber door slides}
<B>__{open.}
<A>__{beat. and...ben grimm steps out. not the thing. no more rocks. ben grimm. naked, tired, but finally a normal man. he slips on his trench coat now way too large. he collapses. he stares at his hands, his arms...it worked.}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{oh my god... th thank you. thank you...vic?!}
<A>__{ben sees a spark in shadows. that spark is... victor's arm. victor steps forward, and reveals himself to ben: electricity pumps through his body. his skin is part flesh, part metal. cheekbone exposed, steel tissue.}
<B>__{he is doom.}
<C>__{ben }
<D>__{vic... what the...?}
<C>__{doom}
<D>__{everyone thought i was safe behind those shields...}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{victor, the machine worked for me. it can work for you }

<D>__{it did, ben. it worked perfectly.}
<A>__{ben starts to realize...}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{you planned this...?}
<A>__{doom smiles, reaches out his hand electricity builds from his shoulders, coursing down his arms to his fingertips.}
<C>__{doom}
<D>__{i've always wanted power. now i've got an unlimited supply...}
<C>__{ben}
<D>__{and no thing to stand in your way.}
<A>__{doom smiles, nods, stronger than ben now.}
<C>__{doom}
<D>__{take a good look, ben. this is what a man looks like who embraces his destiny.}
<A>__{doom clenches his fist and blasts ben, sending him flying backwards across the room knocked unconscious.}
<C>__{doom }
<D>__{one down, three to go.}
<A>__{suddenly, whoosh! the lab door flies open. reed enters. doom steps back into the shadows.}
<C>__{doom }
<D>__{right on cue.}
<A>__{reed's eyes go wide. he sees ben crumpled in the corner.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{oh god ben. are you okay?}
<P>__{(amazed)}
<D>__{you did it, you really did it...}
<C>__{doom}
<D>__{no, reed. i did.}
<A>__{reed slowly turns to see...doom. his body, his face.}
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{victor...? what, what happened to you? what did you do to your }
<C>__{doom}
<D>__{exactly what i said i would: i built a better, stronger being. and outsmarted the great reed richards }
<C>__{reed}
<D>__{victor, this isn't the way to }
<C>__{doom}
<P>__{(a dark smile)}
<D>__{you always know best. so tell me. what happens when you superheat rubber?}
<A>__{doom blasts an electrical bolt at reed, knocking reed through the huge window! reed's body rubber bands from the blast.}
