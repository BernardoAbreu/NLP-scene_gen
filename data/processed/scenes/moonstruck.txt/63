<L>__{interior a church basement}
<A>__{it's been set up for a church bazaar. there are several wheels of fortune, many stuffed animals, coffee urns, cakes, a game of ring toss, etc. as the camera inventories the contents of the various stands a little nun sleeps in one of them we hear the old man's voice.}
<C>__{old man's voice}
<D>__{i've got a lot on my mind. things are getting bad in my house. my daughter in law is mad at my son because he will not pay for the wedding.}
<B>__{a tub of apples floating in water}
<A>__{an old, gnarled hand reaches in and pulls one out, dries it with a towel. the camera pulls back revealing that the hand belongs to lucy, who is standing behind a table with the old man and felix. she hands the apple to the old man, who drives a small wooden stake into it with a little wooden hammer. then the old man hands this staked apple to felix, who dips it into a deep metal pot. it emerges shining with red candy goo. then felix sets the candled apple onto a papered tray where a dozen already sit. they repeat this process. but the old man, because his thoughts are elsewhere, takes forever to drive the stake into the apple. this frustrates felix.}
