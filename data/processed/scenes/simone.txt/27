<L>__{exterior soundstage studio lot day}
<A>__{a large satellite dish sits atop a soundstage. "closed set" is the sign on the door a surveillance camera panning the entrance. a security guard, also keeping watch, nods a greeting to viktor as he pulls up in his studio golf cart, script in hand.}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{no one came in or went out just like you said, mr. taransky.}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{good.}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{is miss simone coming today?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{she's already here. she arrived before you and she'll leave long after you've gone.}
<P>__{(admonishing guard)}
<D>__{remember, under no circumstances are you or any other person to enter the set without my express permission.}
<C>__{security guard}
<D>__{what if it catches on fire?}
<C>__{viktor}
<D>__{let it burn. simone would rather go up in flames than give up her privacy.}
<A>__{viktor enters his secret code into the keypad lock and enters the soundstage.}
