<A>__{on 38th street, just off of broadway, the mayflower has withstood the passage of time and the huge fire that forced it to shut down the damage from the fire is still noticeable on the facade of the building the fire appears to have started on the ground floor and seems to have spread all the way up to the top. some of the windows are shattered, while others are boarded up. what was once an impressive ornate building, a fine example of 1920's architecture standing on one of manhattan's most dynamic streets, now gives off a feeling of devastation and desolation. what is left of it is a mere ruin, a sort of neglected ghost ship, abandoned in the heart of the city.}
