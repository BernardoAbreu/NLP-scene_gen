<L>__{exterior moors by the sea fog late day}
<A>__{arthur and perceval ride alone, the accompanying knights gone, the dying and the dead and the crazed horses all around them. squires are carrying kay upon his shield. he is dead. arthur leaps to the ground and reaches out to touch his face, and closes his eyes. he stifles his tears.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{has anyone seen lancelot?}
<C>__{squire}
<D>__{he lies over there, sir.}
<A>__{arthur rushes off, perceval following on horseback. lancelot is mortally wounded, blood flowing from his abdomen, his eyes open but his gaze dead. arthur falls to his side.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{squire! here!}
<A>__{but there is no one now except the dead and wounded, and perceval, who dismounts to watch over the king, sword drawn. desperate, arthur stops the wound with his hand. lancelot's eyes are sightless, but tears spill from them.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{arthur.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{lancelot, i will save you... don't die.}
<A>__{he tears off a piece of his tunic and staunches the wound with it.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{my salvation is to die a knight of the round table.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{you are that and much more. you are its greatest knight, you are what is best in men. now we will be together }
<C>__{lancelot}
<D>__{ it is the old wound, that has been opened. i have always known it would be the gateway to my death, for it has never healed. let my heart do its job, my king, and pump me empty...}
<A>__{arthur takes lancelot in his arms and rests his lips against the knight's brow.}
<C>__{lancelot}
<P>__{(a death whisper)}
<D>__{guenevere, has she come to you, is she queen again?}
<A>__{he lies, closing his eyes, unable to look at lancelot.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{she is, lancelot.}
<A>__{a boyish smile settles over the features of lancelot's face, and he dies. arthur holds him to his breast, his eyes shut tight. a strong wind rises. perceval kneels beside arthur.}
<C>__{perceval}
<D>__{the fog is lifting. only we remain alive.}
