<A>__{george, in his leather and denim, is walking down the sidewalk. as we widen, we see he's pushing a pink stroller. he stops at a crosswalk, waiting for the light to change. in the stroller, beth starts to whine. george reaches in his pocket, finds her pacifier. as he's leaning down to give it to her, he hears a rumble coming down the street behind him. the roar grows. he stands, looks. a group of about ten bikers has pulled up next to him. he looks at them. they look at him, then at the stroller. george feels ridiculous. when the light changes, the bikers rev loudly and pull out. george just stands there and watches them go.}
