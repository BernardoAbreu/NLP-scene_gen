<L>__{exterior train day}
<A>__{as it bursts out of a tunnel on it's way to tokyo.}
<L>__{interior train day}
<A>__{kobo is sitting by the window, his hands cuffed in front of him. another pair of cuffs chain him to the arm rest. nick pours a drink from an airline sized bottle of scotch. he holds it out to... ich. it's his first drink in a week.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{just one, compadre... kampai.}
<C>__{ich}
<D>__{kampai.}
<A>__{they clink glasses. ich drinks it down.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{it took 12 years to make it, you could take five minutes to drink it.}
<A>__{ich slows down.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{you did great, ichiro.}
<C>__{ich}
<D>__{i called ohashi, he'll be waiting.}
<P>__{(smiling)}
<D>__{i like him waiting.}
<A>__{ich gets up.}
<C>__{ich}
<D>__{needs ice.}
<A>__{he heads for the bar car, leaving kobo and nick alone. kobo looks out the window at the people working the rice paddies, then back down the aisle at the salarymen in their identical suits, then at the women separated from them.}
<C>__{kobo}
<D>__{ugly... a couple of thousand years they've been bound by these little rules. looking in. always afraid. ugly little lives...}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{save it, i already took the tour.}
<C>__{kobo}
<D>__{you are a lucky man. where you come from a man can stand out. it's expected. here a man is made to look a fool for standing out.}
<A>__{nick isn't paying much attention.}
<C>__{kobo}
<D>__{i like your friend, joyce. you're lucky.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{guess i'm on a roll.}
<C>__{kobo}
<D>__{she's such a long way home for you.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{time, i've got plenty of.}
<A>__{a raucous salaryman comes down the aisle, singing an enka, swaying with the train, bumping into seats. a common enough sight and ignored by the rest of the passengers. the salaryman stumbles and falls across nick's lap.}
<C>__{nick}
<P>__{(helping him up)}
<D>__{hey, hey, come on, blow...}
<A>__{the salaryman bows deep. nick ignores it. the man moves on. kobo looks out the window, the train begins to slow as it approaches the next station.}
<C>__{kobo}
<P>__{(matter of factly)}
<D>__{this is my stop.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{i'm amused.}
<C>__{kobo}
<D>__{don't be.}
<A>__{nick looks up to see kobo calmly fingering a lock of blond hair tied with black ribbon. joyce's ribbon. joyce's hair.}
<C>__{kobo}
<D>__{i have her.}
<A>__{nick looks down the car. the drunk salaryman who stumbled over nick is quite sober. he made the hand off to kobo. kobo holds out his wrists. nick hesitates.}
<C>__{kobo}
<P>__{(matter of factly)}
<D>__{i will kill her.}
<A>__{nick, reluctantly, unlocks both sets of cuffs. the train pulls into the station.}
<C>__{kobo}
<D>__{i want the plate from your pal, sugai. when you get it, you get her.}
<A>__{kobo gets up, starts down the aisle.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{sugai won't give it to me, you know that.}
<C>__{kobo}
<D>__{then take it from him.}
<A>__{kobo gets off the train.}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{follows him to the door.}
<B>__{the station}
<A>__{kobo get into a waiting jaguar. four guards nearby.}
<B>__{inside the train}
<A>__{nick runs down the length of the car trying to keep the jaguar in sight as the train pulls out... the car is gone.}
<B>__{nick}
<A>__{bursts into the packed bar car.}
<C>__{nick}
<D>__{ichiro?!}
<A>__{everyone turns around. no ich.}
