<L>__{interior cush's suite night}
<A>__{we glide into frank cushman's suite overlooking times square. it's filled with nfl swag free t shirts, athletic bags, sweatpants, and more. half finished room service food abounds. matt, keith and cush's stylish college girlfriend anne louise mill about the room, basking in the glow of the man of the moment. cush, who holds a guitar in his lap, wears the odd combination of a nirvana t shirt and a nfl jacket. he signs for more room service and continues strumming the only song he knows on guitar, cobain's "something in the way." jerry enters on a rush of adrenalin.}

<C>__{waiter}
<D>__{dude, you're like a god.}
<C>__{cush}
<P>__{(immediately)}
<D>__{god, you're like a dude.}
<A>__{it's a great line, and the room breaks up. this is charisma, the future of the nfl. waiter exits, as cush continues strumming. and now jerry speaks, importantly.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{cush, matt we have a decision to make.}
<C>__{cush}
<D>__{"it's okay to eat fish, 'cause they don't have any feelings...}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{okay. san diego just came in with a last minute scenario. it's big.}
<C>__{cush}
<D>__{"something in the way. yeah."}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{well, he's gotta go number one.}
<C>__{cush}
<D>__{"ooooooo."}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{he still goes number one, but san diego wants to trade up with new england they want him bad.}
<A>__{cush turns to his curiously ambivalent father, who walks to the window and looks out at the big jumbotron with keith.}
<C>__{matt}
<D>__{what happened to denver?}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{denver got very silent about a day ago. san diego's got a fever for cush. this stuff tends to happen the night before a draft. people get crazy. and san diego, you should know, is crazy to the tune of seven years for thirty. signing bonus of eight.}

<A>__{jerry holds up a finger watch me. jerry picks up the ringing phone. he offers a near perfect imitation.}
<C>__{jerry}
<D>__{"this is cush."}
<A>__{suddenly, everyone is, laughing. the room lightens.}
