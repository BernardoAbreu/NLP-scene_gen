<L>__{exterior day. a dry river bed.}
<A>__{jane lies curled up on a rock at the bottom of a dried up river bed. all of nature is suspended in stillness. far away, we hear the sound of a flood loosened in the remote mountains. we hear the sound of the torrent approach. jane doesn't move. she has no will to flee. the sound of rushing water pounds in her ears. she lies, waiting to be dashed away. we see the flood approach and hit. a dazzling whiteness of water and foam.}
