<L>__{exterior car}
<A>__{low three quarters on the car as it squeals to a halt. a car that has been following screeches to a halt just behind it. both cars sit. rain patters.}
<L>__{interior first car}
<A>__{close on the man, from behind. he looks at the woman.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{...abby?}
<A>__{she doesn't answer. he turns to look back and we see his face, for the first time, in the headlights of the car behind.}
<B>__{his pov}
<A>__{the car behind them waiting, patiently. rain drifts down past its headlights. finally it pulls out and passes them slowly, their headlights showing it to be a battered green volkswagon. first the car itself, then its red taillights, disappear into the rain.}
<B>__{back to the man}
<A>__{cutting between him and the woman, each from behind.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{...you know that car?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{no.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{what's the matter?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{i don't know... i just think maybe i'm making a mistake...}
<A>__{she looks at the man.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{...what was that back there?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{back where?}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{sign.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{i don't know. motel... abby }
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{ray. did you mean that, what you said before, or were you just being a gentleman?}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{abby, i like you, but it's no point starting anything now.}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{i mean, i ain't a marriage counselor }
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{yeah.}
<A>__{the man is uncomfortable.}
<C>__{man}
<D>__{...what do you want to do?}
<A>__{the woman is uncomfortable. after a long pause:}
<C>__{woman}
<D>__{...what do you want to do?}
<B>__{motel room}
<A>__{pulling back from ray and abby in bed, making love. the only light is from cars passing along the highway outside. each sweeping light by ends in black. the pullback ends in a wide shot of the motel room. the black following the last car lingers. a telephone rings.}
<B>__{same wide shot morning}
<A>__{ray and abby are asleep. on a nightstand next to the bed, the telephone is ringing. ray stirs, reaches for the phone.}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{...hello.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{having a good time?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{...what? who is this?}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{i don't know, who's this?}
<A>__{a silence at both ends.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{...you still there?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yeah, i'm still here.}
<A>__{ray listens to another silence. it ends with a disconnect. abby is stirring as ray gets out of bed.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{...ray?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{yeah.}
<C>__{abby}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{ray}
<D>__{your husband.}
<B>__{bar back office night}
<A>__{we are tracking past a man seated behind a wooden desk, towards an 8 x 10 black and white photograph that has just been slapped down on the desktop. the picture is of abby and ray in bed together in the motel room.}
<C>__{voice}
<D>__{i know a place you can get that framed.}
<A>__{the voice is familiar as that of the narrator whose musings on life in texas and the soviet union opened the movie. we cut to him. he is settling himself into a chair facing the desk. he is loren visser, a large unshaven man in a misshapen yellow leisure suit. he smiles at the man behind the desk.}
<B>__{julian marty}
<A>__{sits staring down at the photograph. behind him a window opens on the bar proper. country western music filters in from the bar. marty is not pleased.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{what did you take these for?}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{what do you mean...}
<A>__{he removes a pouch of tobacco from his breast pocket and nonchalantly starts rolling a cigarette.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{...just doin' my job.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{you called me, i knew they were there, so what do i need these for?}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{well, i don't know... call it a fringe benefit.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{how long did you watch her?}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{most of the night...}
<A>__{he lights his cigarette, then slaps his lighter onto the desktop. it is silver, engraved on the top with a lariat spelling out "loren" in script, and on the side with a declaration that he is "elks man of the year."}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{...they'd just rest a few minutes and then get started again. quite something.}
<A>__{marty stares down at the photograph.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{you know in greece they cut off the head of the messenger who brought bad news.}
<A>__{a smoke ring floats into frame from offscreen.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{now that don't make much sense.}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{no. it just made them feel better.}
<A>__{marty rises and goes to a safe behind his desk. visser laughs as he watches marty.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{well first off, julian, i don't know what the story is in greece but in this state we got very definite laws about that...}
<A>__{marty, hunched over the standing safe behind his desk, tosses in the photograph and takes out a pay envelope.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{...second place i ain't a messenger, i'm a private investigator. and third place and most important it ain't such bad news. i mean you thought he was a colored.}
<P>__{(he laughs)}
<D>__{...you're always assumin' the worst...}
<A>__{visser blows another smoke ring, pushes a fat finger through the middle of it, and beams at marty.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{...anything else?}
<C>__{marty}
<D>__{yeah, don't come by here any more. if i need you again i know which rock to turn over.}
<A>__{marty scales the pay envelope across the desk. it hits visser in the chest and bounces to the floor. visser looks stonily down at the envelope; no expression for a beat. then he roars with laughter.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{that's good... "which rock to turn over"... that's very good...}
<A>__{sighing, he leans forward to pick up the envelope. he rises, straightens his cowboy hat, and walks over to a screen door letting out on the bar's back parking lot.}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{well, gimme a call whenever you wanna cut off my head...}
<A>__{he pauses at the door, cocks his head, then turns back to the desk and picks up his cigarette lighter. returning to the door:}
<C>__{visser}
<D>__{...i can crawl around without it.}
<A>__{the door slams shut behind him. marty scowls at the back door. after a moment he rises and crosses the office to the window looking out on the bar. over marty's shoulder we see the long bar leading up to the window in perpendicular. the camera is tracking forward, past marty, to frame on the window. a black man is just now vaulting the near end of the bar, over onto the customer side.}
