<L>__{interior car day}
<A>__{renda's in the back between barris and benitez. brazioni drives. renda seems pale and nervous, as does barris in his gaudy tourist wear and sunglasses. the car drives slowly through the crowded mexico city streets. they arrive at a jammed intersection and are suddenly confronted with a big parade. it's day of the dead; the streets are filled with dancing skeletons. it's wild and frightening. brazioni glances at renda in the reaview mirror.}
