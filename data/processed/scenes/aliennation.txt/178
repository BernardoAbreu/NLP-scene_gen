<L>__{interior warehouse night}
<A>__{low angle, shooting across the underside of wiltey's stopped patrol car as sykes' and jetson's feet appear around the corner of the warehouse door. the car is still running the exhaust pipe still rumbling and expelling fumes. the feet slow... then cautiously start around the car. we pan with them as they move around the side of the car. a dark liquid begins dripping in extreme f.g. we move up, to a close up of the car bumper. the dark liquid is blood, dripping deep red on the shiny chrome. we move up farther, and there is wiltey's severed head. in close up, resting on the hood of the patrol car. sykes and jetson stop dead at the sight. wiltey's body lies in a heap on the floor near the car. they both stare, then sykes looks around the shadowy interior of the warehouse, his expression saying: what the hell could have done this so fast?}
<B>__{their pov}
<A>__{there are two paths to go. both dark and scary as hell. the sound of a distant fog horn blends with the creaks and drips of this waterfront building. angle sykes and jetson jetson reaches into the patrol car and pulls the shotgun from the dash mount. he checks the chamber as sykes checks the casull. they exchange a knowing look... then wordlessly, they split up. sykes takes the path to the left, jetson to the right.}
<B>__{with jetson}
<A>__{as he moves into a dark area. he slowly picks his way along a long wall, having to step over all sorts of piled debris, heading toward us. we pan slightly to the left to hold a door in close up. the door, already ajar, eases open slightly wider. jetson hears this. he reaches the door, sets himself, then spins and kicks the door open all the way. there's nothing inside... now. jetson looks up, sees movement in the distance. it is sykes, quite far away, in another section of the warehouse. sykes leaves jetson's field of view.}
