<L>__{interior trans siberian restaurant. kitchen day}
<D>__{inside the kitchen there is an inferno of activity, steam, smoke. family members, some dressed in their party outfits, others in chefs' uniforms, are standing over steaming pots, laughing, arguing. children play and yell. you can almost smell christmas. anna enters, dazzled by it all, overwhelmed by the contrast to her own lifeless christmas kitchen. semyon calls out to everyone.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{come, come, hurry, hurry. they will be here any moment.}
<P>__{(to anna)}
<D>__{ok, show me this card. anna reaches into her pocket and produces the `trans siberian' business card she found in tatiana's bag. semyon angles his head to look as he stirs.}
<C>__{semyon }
<D>__{it is the old card. from before the renovations. but even so, if she had worked here i would remember the name. perhaps she ate here once. try this. semyon offers anna a spoonful of his gravy. she sips it.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{god, that's amazing. my dad made gravy just like that. semyon shrugs and smiles, his eyes twinkling, then goes back to stirring. he speaks as if unconcerned.}
<C>__{semyon}
<D>__{so did you get a chance to talk to this girl before she died?}
