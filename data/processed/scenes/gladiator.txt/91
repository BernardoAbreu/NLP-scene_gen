<L>__{exterior street theater night}
<A>__{the crowd laughs riotously as roman actors perform a typically ribald comedy in a secluded street: an outrageously dressed version of maximus is parading around on an outrageously dressed version of commodus, riding him like a donkey and slapping his rear with a wooden sword. the "commodus" actor mews and brays and wails like an infant. captain marcellus of the city guard gallops past them, on his way out of rome.}
