<D>__{me, too.}
<A>__{the elevator stops at the lobby level. nine, well dressed men enter. their faces are not shown. the boys move to the back wall. one guy says something quickly to another in russian. the other gives a one word russian response. they boys look at each other. as the elevator climbs, their eyes focus. the door opens. as the men exit the elevator, each face is seen individually, all are victims from smecker's crime scene. the elevator goes up half a floor. they hit the stop button and rummage in their bags. they suit up; black gloves and black masks. they strap on four 9mm. pistols with silencers, in shoulder holsters, one under each arm. connor takes a large coil of black rope and drapes it around himself. he looks at murphy and at the rope in his bag. murphy is too excited to argue.}
