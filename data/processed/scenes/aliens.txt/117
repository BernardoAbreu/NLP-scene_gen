<A>__{on vasquez wired and intense.}
<C>__{vasquez}
<D>__{all right, we can't blow the fuck out of them...why not roll some canisters of cn 20 down there. nerve gas the whole nest?}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{look, man, let's just bug out and call it even, okay?}
<C>__{ripley}
<P>__{(to vasquez)}
<D>__{no good. how do we know it'll effect their biochemistry? i say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit. it's the only way to be sure.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{now hold on a second. i'm not authorizing that action.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{why not?}
<A>__{burke senses the challenge in her tone and backpedals flawlessly into conciliatory mode.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{well, i mean...i know this is an emotional moment, but let's not make snap judgments. let's move cautiously. first, this physical installation had a substantial dollar value attached to it }
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{they can bill me. i got a tab running. what's second?}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{this is clearly an important species we're dealing with here. we can't just arbitrarily exterminate them }
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{bullshit!}
<C>__{vasquez}
<D>__{yeah, bullshit. watch us.}
<C>__{hudson}
<D>__{maybe you haven't been keeping up on current events, but we just got out asses kicked, pal!}
<A>__{ripley faces burke squarely and she's not pleased.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{look, burke. we had an agreement.}
<A>__{burke moves in, lowering his voice. he takes her aside from the others.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{i know, i know, but we're dealing with changing scenarios here. this thing is major, ripley. i mean really major. you gotta go with its energy. since you are the representative of the company who discovered this species your percentage will naturally be some serious, serious money.}
<A>__{ripley stares at his like he's a particularly disagreeable fungus.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{you son of a bitch.}
<C>__{burke}
<P>__{(hardening)}
<D>__{don't make me pull rank, ripley.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{what rank? i believe corporal hicks has authority here.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{corporal hicks!?}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{this operation is under military jurisdiction and hicks is next in chain of command. right?}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{looks that way.}
<A>__{burke starts to lose it and it's not a pretty sight.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{look, this is a multimillion dollar operation. he can't make that kind of decision. he's just a grunt!}
<P>__{(glances at hicks)}
<D>__{no offense.}
<C>__{hicks}
<P>__{(coolly)}
<D>__{none taken.}
<P>__{(into mike)}
<D>__{ferro, you copying?}
<C>__{ferro}
<P>__{(voice over; static)}
<D>__{standing by.}
<C>__{hicks}
<D>__{prep for dust off. we're gonna need an immediate evac.}
<P>__{(to burke)}
<D>__{i think we'll take off and nuke the site from orbit. it's the only way to be sure.}
<A>__{he winks. burke looks like a kid whose toy has been snatched.}
<C>__{burke}
<D>__{this is absurd! you don't have the authority to }
<A>__{clack! the sound of a rifle bolt snapping home truncates his rant. vasquez has a pulse rifle cradled, not exactly aimed at burke but not exactly aimed away either. her expression is masklike. end of discussion. ripley sits behind newt, putting her arm around her.}
<C>__{ripley}
<D>__{we're going home, honey.}
