<L>__{interior guest wing just after}
<A>__{roger and lestat walk in. a young groupie giggles nervously.}
<D>__{groupie #3 oh my god, it's him! it's really him...}
<A>__{she turns in paroxysm of excitement to the girl next to her. lestat stares, taken aback. it is jesse. dressed in goth gear. jesse stares back at lestat brazenly. a long moment.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{perhaps you would like a tour of the place... first. groupie #3 oh yeah, wow, we'd love that.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{roger... would you be so kind?}
<C>__{roger}
<P>__{(surprised, relieved)}
<D>__{sure. right this way, girls.}
<A>__{as they start off, lestat puts up his hand, points to jesse.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{roger. not that one. leave her to me...}
<A>__{the other groupie pouts, disappointed. she goes out with roger. lestat turns to jesse... considers her...}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you must be very keen to die.}
<A>__{jesse's heart pounds with terror.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{the talamascans have become quite stealthy. i didn't know infiltration was quite their style.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{it's not. i... i came on my own.}
<A>__{he stares at her, taking her in.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{how did you find me?}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{i've been tracking your manager for days...}
<P>__{(gesturing to her goth outfit)}
<D>__{then i figured out you simply have to look the part.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{clever librarian... you should know, based on all your research, that groupies don't ever find their way out of here again.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{i'm not a groupie...}
<A>__{lestat gazes at jesse's pulsing jugular. he steps closer.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{then why are you following me? what do you want?}
<C>__{jesse}
<P>__{(terrified, in a whisper)}
<D>__{are you granting wishes?}
<C>__{lestat}
<P>__{(smiles, in a whisper playing with her)}
<D>__{last wishes. what's yours?}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{show me what it's like to be you. that's my last wish. grant it, lestat.}
<A>__{he stares at her, feeling some connection with this strange mortal girl. she stares at him with penetrating eyes. he again finds himself drawn to her. tries to fight it.}
<C>__{lestat}
<P>__{(turning away)}
<D>__{i don't have time for this.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{all a vampire has is time.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{maybe not.}
<C>__{jesse}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{right. the covens are coming for you.}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{i understand why you're doing it. you have to be who you are, no matter what happens.}
<A>__{he turns, gazes at her. she steps forward.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{but how are you spending what may be your last night on earth, lestat? as you always have... alone.}
<A>__{jesse takes a breath, crosses to him, stands very close, stares up into his eyes. he stares down at her, amazed, his heart pounding. he breathes in her hair, the scent of her skin.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{don't kill me yet. let's spend our last nights together. share it with me. show me what it's like to be you.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{you don't know what you're asking! i don't know what's in that librarian's head of yours, but it's not what you think.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{that's right. you don't know what's in my head, lestat. do you want to?}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{i will know when i kill you.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{gee, lestat, that's a great way to get to know someone. here. i will give you a preview. coming attractions. this is what you'll find.}
<A>__{she crosses to him, stands close.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{i have this recurring dream that i'm a child and i'm living in this big house filled with vampires. and every night when i go to sleep, i wish to god the same thing... you know what that is, lestat?}
<A>__{he gazes at her. she leans forward.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{that i will have the dream again... because in the dream i'm happy. and the dream is more real than my life... i don't know how, but i know you, lestat... my life is a big mystery and you, you have the answer...}
<A>__{he gazes at her, being taken in, tries to resist it. jesse moves even closer. he stares down at her, the softness of her skin, her penetrating gaze, the heat of her body.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{i can't go on pretending this life of mine is real. i can't live a lie... i'm just like you lestat. we're the same...}
<C>__{lestat}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{are we? i seek the light. you seek the shadows.}
<C>__{jesse}
<D>__{no. we're looking for exactly the same thing. you know it... please. show me.}
<A>__{he stares at her. her eyes gazing directly into his... suddenly...}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{alright!}
<A>__{jesse breaks into a smile.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{this may be painful for a mortal. you're still attached to your skin.}
<C>__{jesse}
<P>__{(an excited whisper)}
<D>__{i don't care.}
<C>__{lestat}
<D>__{close your eyes. don't breathe.}
<A>__{her heart pounding, fluttering her eyes closed, jesse holds one deep, hesitant breath and... flash with preternatural speed }
<B>__{lestat and jesse}
<A>__{whisk through the night, flashing past trees and houses. opening her eyes for a moment, jesse watches the world whiz past her at incredible speed and suddenly they stop on a dime. jesse gasps, catching her breath to find herself at hollywood's highest peak overlooking the city laying out before her like a glimmering blanket.}
