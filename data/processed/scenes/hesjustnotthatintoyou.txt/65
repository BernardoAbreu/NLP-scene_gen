<L>__{interior frazier's on the avenue night}
<A>__{gigi sits sipping a drink, alone, when alex comes in the door and goes directly to her table.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{sorry i'm late.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{that's ok. i like a little time before a blind date prepare myself mentally, remind myself not to tell the story about my molars }
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{he's not coming.}
<A>__{alex motions to the waitress to bring them another round.}
<C>__{alex }
<D>__{can't wait to hear that story about the molars, though.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{how can he already not like me?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i screwed up. i told bill it was thursday, but i meant tuesday.}
<A>__{gigi is disappointed. the waitress drops off their drinks. they toast then observe the scene at the bar.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{awesome. i'm stuck here with a guy who can't distinguish tuesday from thursday and meanwhile this girl }
<P>__{(motions to girl at the bar)}
<D>__{ she's probably meeting her soul mate as we speak.}
<A>__{the girl is standing between two guys.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{nope.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{how do you know?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{see the guy trying to work the tom cruise thing. she's interested. he's not.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{you cannot tell from a cursory glance that he's not interested.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{actually, i can. i manage a restaurant. i see this stuff go down every night. watch }
<A>__{as if on cue, tom cruise guy bangs his elbow into the girl, hard, causing her to spill her drink. tom cruise guy sees, but doesn't acknowledge. alex looks smug.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{man, you have a gift.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{and check out droopy dawg on her other side. he can buy her drinks all night, and she'll insist there's no "spark."}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{maybe there isn't. you need a spark.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{the "spark" thing is bullshit.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{really? enlighten me.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{guys invented the "spark" so they could not call and treat you kind of bad and keep you guessing, and then convince you that the anxiety and fear that it creates in you is actually a "spark." and you all buy it. you love it. you all thrive on it because you all love drama.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{i don't.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{really? so you don't wait until the last minute on deadlines, or on phone bills, because you love the drama of not knowing whether you'll make it?}
<A>__{she's busted.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{maybe.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{and let me guess when you were stalking conor that night were you obsessing about him calling for days, even though the date was just kind of mediocre?}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{ok. yeah.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{see, you thrive on drama. you gotta be more like me if a girl likes me great, if not, there are plenty more like her probably with smaller pores and bigger implants.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{that's beautiful.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{thanks.}
<A>__{they continue drinking and observing the scene.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{why are you sharing all this inside dating information with me again?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{i dunno. i like you.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{you do?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{don't start doodling my name on your binder. i just mean, i like you, like i like basset hounds. they're kinda pathetic so you want to cheer them up.}
<C>__{gigi}
<D>__{again with the sensitivity.}
<A>__{alex smiles at her. gigi can't help but smile back.}
