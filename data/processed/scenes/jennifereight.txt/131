<A>__{a picture of ross fills the frame. snapped the day they search ed the dump. blasted with rain. a waterproof cape and a finger raised in defiance. berlin shifts eyes from the bulletin board. pours a last inch of whisky and drinks. eyes back to the board for a last photographic panoramic record of his time in eureka. the photo of ross again before his eyes sweep quickly on. pict ure of amber stone. thumb tacks and maps and tape. information relating to specific areas in san diego. carlsbad ocean beach point loma. "jennifer seven" "jennifer eight." but who gives a fuck anymore? two dead dogs on a refuse dump. and now the dead face of a dummy. berlin stares till someone knocks on the door. st anne comes in smoking a cigarette and eating a ham sandwich.}
