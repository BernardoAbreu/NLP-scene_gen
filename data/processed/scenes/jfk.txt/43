<D>__{to prove their was a conspiracy involving clay shaw we must prove there was more than one man involved in the assassination. to do that, we must look at the zapruder film, which my office has subpoenaed. the american public has not seen that film because it has been kept locked in a vault in the time life building in new york city for the last five years. there is a reason for that. watch.}
<A>__{the zapruder film (8mm) now rolls. we have seen pieces of it before in the opening of the film, but now we see it whole. it is crucial that this piece of film be repeated several times during the trial to drive home a point that is easily lost on casual viewing. the first viewing is silent except for the sound of the clanky projector. it lasts about 25 seconds, and then the lights come on. the jury is shaken. the judge is shaken. the people in the courtroom murmur. even clay shaw is surprised at what he has seen. jim says nothing, letting the truth of it sink in. then:}

<D>__{a picture speaks a thousand words. yet sometimes the truth is too simple for some... the warren commission thought they had an open and shut case: three bullets, one assassin but two things happened that made it virtually impossible: 1)the zapruder film which you just saw, and 2)the third wounded man, jim tague, who was nicked by a fragment down by the triple underpass. the time frame of 5.6 seconds established by the zapruder film left no possibility of a fourth shot from oswald's rifle, but the shot or fragment that left a superficial wound on tague's cheek had to come from a bullet that missed the car entirely. now they had two bullets that hit, and we know one of them was the fatal head shot. so a single bullet remained to account for all seven wounds in kennedy and connally. but rather than admit to a conspiracy or investigate further, the commission chose to endorse the theory put forth by an ambitious junior counsellor, arlen specter. one of the grossest lies ever forced on the american people, we've come to know it as the "magic bullet" theory.}
