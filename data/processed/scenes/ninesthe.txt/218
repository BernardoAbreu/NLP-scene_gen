<A>__{gabriel lies awake, staring at the ceiling.}
<L>__{interior stairwell night}
<A>__{gabriel's bare feet walk down the carpeted stairs.}
<L>__{interior dining room night}
<A>__{gabriel stares at the three paintings on the wall.}
<L>__{interior kitchen exterior back yard dawn}
<A>__{gabriel stands in the doorway, looking out at the inky blue sky. his eyes are red, tired. he hasn't slept at all. it's very quiet, except for the occasional precocious bird}
<B>__{call.}
<A>__{mary enters from the living room, still in her pajamas. he knows she's there. neither wants to speak.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you need to go, don't you?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{no. i can stay.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{how long? forever? every day, you'd know what you were missing.}
<A>__{he smiles, a little.}
<C>__{mary }
<D>__{what happens? if you go.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{worst case scenario? spontaneous disintegration into a fiery void. oblivio accebit. the end of everything.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{that's all?}
<A>__{both smile.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{that probably wouldn't happen. the basic structure of the universe should hold. i guess i'm just worried about the human factor. you guys kill each other a lot.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{in fairness, that's usually in your name. plus we've gotten much more efficient at it.}
<A>__{a beat.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i like this world. i like my life, here, with you and noelle...}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{but it's not real. i'm not really your wife, you're not really my husband. on some level, it's all pretend.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{it's not pretend. there's a reason you were there, in every version. you were my sister, my wife, my best friend...}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{that's a little creepy.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i wanted you close. in one version, i even told you. i warned you that some day they might come for me, and...}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{...you'd have to leave. how many versions were there?}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{ninety. this is the last one.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{wow.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i've destroyed billions of people with a thought. obliterated them. and you'd like to think it's painless...}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{stop. you don't have to explain, or apologize. everything that is, is because of you. if that's all, that's enough.}
<A>__{with that, there's really nothing more to say.}
<C>__{mary }
<D>__{so.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{so.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{guess you don't really need to pack anything.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{i'm good.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{you're great. it's been a pleasure.}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{likewise. i love you.}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{love you, too. ya big lug.}
<A>__{he kisses her. it's not a big, passionate, movie ending kiss, but rather a fond kiss farewell. at the end of it, he whispers into her ear:}
<C>__{gabriel}
<D>__{you're my favorite.}
<A>__{she smiles. with two fingers, gabriel breaks the green string bracelet around his left wrist. and in that moment, a film passes over him, like the boundary between water and air. he's stepped out of this dimension. mary is frozen with the same smile on her face, but we notice that she and the kitchen around her have flattened out to two dimensional images. she and everything around her has become like wallpaper, slowly curling away, revealing emptiness beneath. gabriel collapses into a single, spiky sphere of light. the light moves through the kitchen, creating waves that ripple through the tissue thin walls. picking up speed, the sphere rushes through the window, heading west.}
