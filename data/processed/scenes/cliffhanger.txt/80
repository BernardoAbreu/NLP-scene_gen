<L>__{interior buttress crack chimney}
<A>__{gabe is just as we left him. face down, arms and legs pressing against the five foot gap of the tunnel walls. carefully, gabe takes one hand off the wall, gets out his lighter with the other, and ignites it for a look gabe's pov upward just as the crack has widened below him it's wider above him. more important, it slants at an easy enough angle to allow him to walk up. if only he can get up there.}
<B>__{gabe}
<A>__{snaps the lighter shut, pockets it, and readies himself. gabe steadily "walks" up the vertical passage by bracing himself with one leg and one arm then moving the other leg and arm up. gabe repeats this until he has his hands on the curved edge where the crack snakes into a sideways passage. but there are no handholds that will allow gabe to get a grip and simply swing over and climb up.}
<C>__{gabe}
<P>__{(winded)}
<D>__{so much for the easy part.}
<A>__{overhead angle the crack gabe takes a deep breath, readies himself, and shoves himself away from the wall with his arms, pushes himself into a squat against the opposite wall, hanging for a second with no support at all, and he springs from that all into}
<B>__{the diagonal passage}
<A>__{gabe lands hard but flat on the passage and immediately starts backsliding into the drop, but he digs in with his boots and his hands. safe at last. gabe carefully stands in a crouch and starts heading up.}
