<L>__{exterior airfield. hangar day}
<A>__{james proudly shows off his new car to catherine and karen at their offices at the airport. the car is identical to the one he crashed. james sits sideways in the driver's seat, door open, weirdly jaunty.}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{i can't believe you've done this.}
<C>__{karen}
<D>__{this is the exact same car as your old one, isn't it?}
<C>__{catherine}
<D>__{yes, it is.}
<P>__{(to james)}
<D>__{are you planning to have another car crash?}
<C>__{james}
<D>__{i'm not thinking about the crash at all.}
<A>__{james is telling the truth. what he is thinking about is the way that karen's hip casually brushes against catherine's hip, without either woman seeming to be conscious of it.}
