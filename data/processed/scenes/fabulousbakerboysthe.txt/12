<A>__{the front room is cluttered with his childhood. most noticeable are the pianos: two tiny uprights, perfectly matched, their simulated ivory keys yellowed with age. above them, pressed between glass and framed, are the music ribbons, faded by twenty years of sunlight. finally, there is the sheet music, dusty and dog eared, piled everywhere in drunken stacks. this and all else in the room jack confronts slowly, warily, but with a noticeable dispassion, until his eyes fall upon a photograph. in it, he and frank are standing alonside a tall man in baggy slacks, safe within the arc of his long arms. frank is staring straight into the camera, neat, clean, perfectly posed, but jack, a year younger, his shirt too big, is caught in profile, looking up at the tall man with an almost worshipful gaze.}

<A>__{all at once, jack and his mother realize they are alone.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{well, shall we cut that cake?}
<A>__{jack nods and follows her into the kitchen. he places the box on the table and stands off to the side while mrs. baker sets about preparing things.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{so. how are you?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{fine. you?}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{oh, fine.}

<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{big piece or little?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{huh? oh, no.}

<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{yes. right. eddie. how is he?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{he's losing his teeth.}
<A>__{mrs. baker stops and looks up into jack's eyes. suddenly, a noise is heard in the other room.}
<C>__{mrs. baker}
<D>__{sounds like your brothers back with us.}
