<L>__{interior main deck, air force one night}
<A>__{as the first lady's entourage enters.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{why don't you go say hi?}
<A>__{again, alice rolls her eyes.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{what is wrong with you tonight? come here.}
<A>__{rose pulls alice aside.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{you don't want to say hi to your father?}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{i'm sure he's busy.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{don't you even want to ask?}
<A>__{alice toes her foot into the carpet as she releases an exasperated sigh. she is, in this moment, the patron saint of know it all 13 year old girls. alice waves toward the presidential suite.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{if i go over there to say hi to daddy president, mike's going to tell me he's in a meeting and can't be disturbed. then when the plane starts to taxi, he'll come out and say "hey, are you guys back? did you enjoy the ballet?" but he'll be on his way to another meeting and won't wait for an answer. then you'll get pissed at him and he'll get pissed at you. it's like you guys rehearse or something.}
<A>__{with the weight of the entire world on her shoulders, alice collapses into one of the many leather chairs. it seems to swallow her. jory, a steward passes.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{hey joey, how `bout a cocoa, double whip cream.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{alice...}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{mom, just this once, give it a rest.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{you're jet lagged. we'll talk about this back...}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{back at the fishbowl?}
<A>__{alice eyes the swirl of aides who are pretending to work nearby. but it's obvious that they're eavesdropping. alice smiles and waves at them dramatically.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{we'll talk at home.}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{you know, most girls aren't as lucky as you. for most girls seeing the bolshoi ballet would be the experience of a lifetime.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{i know, mom.}
<P>__{(sees the hurt in her mom's eyes and softens)}
<D>__{it was great... really.}
<A>__{rose nods, smiling a half smile. after a thoughtful beat, alice gets up and crosses to the presidential suite. she exchanges words with the aide standing outside the door and comes back, covering her disappointment.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{he's in a meeting. he can't be disturbed.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{i'm sorry, honey.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{no, it's okay. after all, he is the president, right?}
<A>__{joey the steward hands her her cocoa with a wink and a smile. her eyes light up at the mound of whip cream on top.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{when i write my memoirs i think i will devote an entire chapter to the cocoa aboard air force one.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{your father never means to be so...}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{i know...}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{but lotsa times i feel like it's me versus the world. some kid at school teases me and the same day a plague breaks out in bangladesh. i mean it doesn't take a genius to figure which is more important.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{some kids were teasing you?}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{that's not really the pointerior}
<A>__{a quiet pause, then...}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{you're right and i will tell you a secret. i know exactly how you feel.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{big secret. you said the same thing to newsweek.}
<A>__{the plane jolts forward as it begins to taxi.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{we're taxiing. ready. and... five... four... three.. two... one... cue daddy.}
<A>__{alice points. and as if on cue, marshall exits from his office and checks his watch.}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{oooooh, i'm good.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{hey, you guys back already?}
<A>__{alice nods.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{how was...}
<P>__{(thinks, then remembers)}
<D>__{...the ballet?}
<C>__{alice}
<P>__{(theatrically)}
<D>__{it was the experience of a lifetime.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{how `bout a hug for the old man.}
<A>__{alice rises and hugs her father. a white house photographer snaps off a few shots for the papers. alice makes a face at them. a second later, shepherd comes up the corridor, breaking up the pair.}
<C>__{shepherd}
<D>__{mr. president... they're ready for you in the conference room.}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{okay. hey, pumpkin, you'll tell me all about it later, right?}
<C>__{alice}
<D>__{sure.}
<A>__{as marshall moves toward the conference room, he bends and gives rose a quick peck on the cheek. it all reeks of formality.}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{may i speak to you for a moment?}
<C>__{marshall}
<D>__{can't it wait?}
<C>__{rose}
<D>__{no, mr. president. it can't.}
