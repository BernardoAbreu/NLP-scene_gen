<L>__{exterior backyard day}
<A>__{bloom and penelope walk and talk, finally rounding the house and ending up at the driveway.}

<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{are you coming back?}
<C>__{bloom}
<D>__{well next time i'm in town. we're taking a steamer at noon tomorrow off the docks, to the continent for a few months.}
<A>__{during this, bloom very naturally moves his hand to the small of penelope's back. the edge of his thumb comes to rest on a small slit of exposed skin. penelope's expression does not change, but a noticeable blush crosses her still face. when bloom removes his hand, the blush falls.}
<C>__{bloom }
<D>__{paris and greece, i think. i've gotta get a hat. thanks for the pinhole camera demonstration. and for the good conversation. goodbye penelope.}
<C>__{penelope}
<D>__{goodbye bloom.}
<A>__{he drives off. she stands in the doorway, watching him go.}
