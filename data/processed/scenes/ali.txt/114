<A>__{ali, at the apex of his athletic skills, fires six or eight punch combinations and then changes direction. ali shoots jabs and hooks going backwards; every move and set of combinations is a dance. ali's never been as light on his feet, as fast, as complex as in this fight. like any moment of greatness, we want it to last forever... then, ali throws a 17 punch combination.}

<A>__{...that burns down terrell. terrell starts to fall. ali moves away. he doesn't want it to end. sportswriters don't like it. half the fans don't like it. ali defies both their sensibilities and their politics. terrell's face is battered. ali slams in shots.}
