<L>__{interior hospital room day}
<A>__{david is in a small, clean and very white hospital room. he lays on his back in bed, his shoulder bandaged and his arm plugged into a bottle of plasma. there are several cuts and abrasions on his arms and face, but he really doesn't look too bad. he opens his eyes slowly, blinks, and tries to sit up and look around, but is unable to because of the pain. he calls out....}
<C>__{david}
<D>__{jack?!}
<A>__{...and passes out. however his shout has fetched a nurse. she is alex price, very english, very beautiful. she goes to the bed.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{mr. kessler?}
<A>__{she looks into his eyes, lifting the lids with her thumb, and then checks his chart at the end of the bed.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{mr. kessler?}
<A>__{david remains unconscious. another young nurse, miss gallagher, comes in.}
<C>__{miss gallagher}
<D>__{he all right?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{yes, i should think. he called out just now.}
<C>__{miss gallagher}
<D>__{he's an american, you know. dr. hirsch is going to fetch round one of those embassy fellows to see him.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{chart says he's from new york.}
<C>__{miss gallagher}
<D>__{i think he's a jew.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{why on earth do you say that?}
<C>__{miss gallagher}
<D>__{i looked.}
<C>__{alex}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{really, susan, i don't think that was very proper, and besides, it's common practice now.}
<A>__{a voice startles the girls.}
<C>__{dr. hirsch}
<D>__{yes, miss gallagher, miss price is quite right.}
<A>__{dr. hirsch enters. he is an older man wearing the customary lab coat. a very commanding and reassuring presence. the girls are embarrassed.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{dr. hirsch, mr. kessler cried out a minute ago.}
<C>__{dr. hirsch}
<D>__{miss gallagher, surely you must perform some function here at the hospital.}
<C>__{miss gallagher}
<D>__{yes, doctor.}
<C>__{dr. hirsch}
<D>__{then get on with it.}
<C>__{miss gallagher}
<D>__{yes, doctor.}
<A>__{she exits. dr. hirsch begins to examine david. alex watches. dr. hirsch turns to alex.}
<C>__{dr. hirsch}
<D>__{can i be of service, miss price?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{dr. hirsch?}
<C>__{dr. hirsch}
<D>__{go about your duties.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{yes, doctor.}
<A>__{she starts to exit.}

<C>__{alex}
<D>__{yes, doctor?}
<C>__{dr. hirsch}
<D>__{what exactly did he call out?}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{he said `jack'.}
<C>__{dr. hirsch}
<D>__{that would be jack goodman, the boy who was killed.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{what happened to them?}
<C>__{dr. hirsch}
<D>__{the police report said an escaped lunatic attacked them. he must have been a very powerful man. although i really don't see that it is any of your concern, miss price.}
<C>__{alex}
<D>__{no, sir. of course, sir. good day, doctor.}
<A>__{she exits as dr. hirsch continues his examination, looking into david's eyes.}
