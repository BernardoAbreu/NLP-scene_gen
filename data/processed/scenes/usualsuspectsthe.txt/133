<L>__{exterior barge night one week prior 140'}
<A>__{verbal is hiding in the tangle of girders and cables on the barge. verbal's p.o.v. keaton's body is completely obscured. the man in a suit strides across the deck over to keaton, stopping to relieve himself on a small fire on the deck. he walks up and stands over keaton. the two men exchange words and the man in the suit pulls out a pistol. he points it at keaton.}
<B>__{red and blue lights flash behind verbal}
<A>__{verbal turns. he can just make out police cars coming in the distance.}
<B>__{bang}
<A>__{verbal hears a shot from the deck of the boat. he turns in time to see the man in the suit running across the deck toward the gangway. verbal can barely see the man from where he is now. the man in the suit is covered by shadows and the poor angle from the barge. verbal strains to see but he cannot. the man in the suit stops long enough to pull out a lighter. he turns and walks back across the deck and out of sight. a moment later flames leap up from on the deck. the mesh of steel and rubber leaves a dark and open cocoon at its base.}
<B>__{move into the darkness.}
<A>__{sirens are close now. almost here. the sound of fire raging out of control.}
<B>__{sirens blaring. tires squealing. car doors opening. feet pounding the pavement.}
<A>__{move further, slower, into the darkness. voices yelling. new light flickering in the surrounding darkness.}
