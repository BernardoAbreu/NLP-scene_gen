<A>__{they press up to the glass for a partial view. bud white sits on a footstool massaging a pair of women's feet. jack and exley exchange a long, curious look. this isn't the bud white they're used to. a pair of woman's hands take bud, the arms covered in glitter and satin. the woman, lynn bracken, leans forward to kiss her policeman. it may have been a long day, but she's every inch veronica lake. only the hair's not over her eye. they stand, kiss again. lynn's gown spills down around her ankles. bud scoops lynn into his arms and the two of them disappear into a bedroom. a long beat before...}
