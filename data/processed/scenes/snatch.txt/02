<A>__{on the back seat is franky four fingers, (new york street wise jew) who is clutching a fancy looking briefcase which is handcuffed to his wrist. he is flanked by two russian hoods. this next section will be subtitled.}
<C>__{franky four fingers}
<D>__{how much further do we have to go?}
<A>__{just then the car comes to a standstill. the window is wound down and a gun barrel is stuck through. the russian driver looks dramatically calm.}
<C>__{russian}
<D>__{pass him the money.}
<A>__{franky hesitates for a second.}
<C>__{russian }
<D>__{franky you know you have no choice. so please can we get on with it?}
<A>__{franky knows discussion is futile. he flips the case open and pulls out a transparent plastic bag full of american dollars. the package is pulled out of the window, the driver doesn't move, we dissolve for a passage of time, the anxiety is more than obvious, but four fingers can do nothing. all of a sudden a package comes through the window and the car speeds off without waiting for an inspection of the delivery. franky opens the package and he reveals a stone the size of a fist. he shines a torch onto it and puts a stone inspectin monocle to his eye. he's satisfied.}
