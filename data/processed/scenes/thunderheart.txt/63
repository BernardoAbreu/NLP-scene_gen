<A>__{ray steps out into the falling night. there is a car parked there. with a high aerial. ray raises a hand in a slight wave, walks on. at the fed car, a regional agent behind the wheel, waves a hand. watches ray get into the le baron. ray gets in the car and takes off. le baron traveling ray drives like a crazy man through the dark reservation. through miles of open land and strange rock formations. and he looks trapped. headlights flicker in his rearview. he sees this. slams the gas pedal.}
