<L>__{interior control room. night.}
<A>__{close up on the on air monitor in the temple of a control room. it displays a wide shot of truman's darkened bedroom filmed through the green hue of the night vision cameras. assistant producer, simeon, and his video operators slouch in their swivel chairs paying scant attention to the screen. simeon gives his instructions in a lethargic, metronomic manner.}
<C>__{simeon}
<D>__{...ready two. go to two.}
<A>__{operator, eating a doughnut, presses one of the illuminated buttons on the panel and the camera angle changes to a close shot of truman's covered head. the camera stays on the blanketed head for a long moment.}
<C>__{simeon}
<D>__{and back to the medium.}
<A>__{another button is pressed and the angle changes. a trace of frustration is evident in the control room. recording a sleeping subject is unrewarding enough without also having to contend with truman's recently aquired camera shyness.}
<C>__{simeon}
<D>__{...and wide...}
<C>__{operator}
<P>__{(aside to simeon)}
<D>__{could we have picked a bigger loser if we tried?}
<C>__{simeon}
<P>__{(shrugs)}
<D>__{that loser pays our salary.}
<C>__{operator}
<D>__{he's given up on himself again.}
<C>__{simeon}
<D>__{who cares? makes life easier for us. he is what he is.}
<A>__{at the far end of the great room, one of the large double doors opens and christof enters, as always accompanied by chloe, carrying a leather bound folder. simeon and the operators subtely straighten in their chairs. christof pretends not to notice. he is staring intently at the on air monitor.}
<C>__{christof}
<D>__{when did he start sleeping like that?}
<C>__{simeon}
<D>__{about the time meryl left.}
<C>__{christof}
<D>__{is that the best shot we can get?}
<C>__{simeon}
<D>__{what's to see?}
<A>__{christof watches truman, a trace of concern in his eyes.}
<C>__{christof}
<P>__{(referring to the debris in truman's bedroom)}
<D>__{what happened to the room?}
<C>__{simeon}
<D>__{he started to reorganize. i was going to call you. but half way through, he gave up and fell asleep.}
<A>__{apparently satisfied, christof turns to an operator.}
<C>__{christof}
<D>__{i want to check the set ups for tomorrow's insurance convention.}
<A>__{reading off the notes in chloe's folder, the operator punches up a batch of camera angles on smaller preview monitors. they show a generic looking marriott hotel, devoid of actors. a banner in reception reads, "welcome american life & accident". the operator looks to christof for approval and realizes his producer's attention has wandered. christof is staring at the sleeping figure of truman on the on air monitor.}
<C>__{christof}
<D>__{give me a shot from his wedding band.}
<C>__{simeon}
<P>__{(pointing out the ring on truman's bedside table)}
<D>__{he took it off.}
<C>__{christof}
<P>__{(a trace of concern)}
<D>__{why is he so still? he's too still.}
<A>__{christof picks up a spare headset from the panel and puts it to his ear.}
<C>__{christof}
<D>__{isolate the audio in the cans and amplify.}
<A>__{an operator pushes up an audio fader on the panel. christof and his colleagues listen to truman's steady breathing in their headphones. simeon and the operators nod, reassured that nothing is amiss. christof is not so easily convinced.}
<C>__{christof}
<D>__{give me a preview. an ecu on his torso.}
<A>__{a camera hidden in the room's bedside lamp zooms in to truman's prone outline...while the breathing remains steady, the body does not rise and fall.}
<C>__{christof}
<P>__{(anxious, barking a command to chloe)}
<D>__{phone him.}
<A>__{chloe picks up a phone connected to the desk and dials.}
<C>__{chri stof}
<P>__{(anticipating chloe's question)}
<D>__{wrong number.}
<A>__{the phone on the bedside table, inches from truman's head, begins to ring. truman doesn't flinch.}
