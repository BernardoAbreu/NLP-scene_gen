<A>__{murphy enters to find the engine room engulfed in flames and black smoke. he finds dodge spraying at it with an extinguisher of his own. the flames belch up from an oil fire in the turbine well, the heat searing paint on the metal covers. murphy sprays a cloud of halon and the fire dims, but only for a moment. dodge grabs another extinguisher, his leg burned, face and hands singed. an explosion rocks the boat and molten flames hurl through the air, catching murphy's pant leg. he's so engrossed in fighting the flames, he doesn't realize he's on fire.}

<A>__{murphy crosses in the smoke, coming as close as he dares to the most intense part of the flames. he turns the extinguisher into them, holding it there. the flames dim, as dodge joins him on the other side, turning his extinguisher on it too. the fire seems to dim yet again as clouds of halon rise up. fire belches from a duct, crawling across the ceiling. dodge fires his extinguisher at it, pushing it back across to the wall again. murphy extinguishes the last of the flames in the turbine well as dodge brings a snaking tendril of fire down to the deck, and finally out. they stand there in the sudden silence, the air heavy with smoke. a fine layer of halon powder lies over everything, but the fire is out.}
