<A>__{the two of them fall through the ceiling directly into the blood pool. amilyn's body surfaces first, now just a husk. buffy pops up from the waist deep blood, soaked and wounded. she stays a moment, breathing hard. suddenly her eyes go wide.}
<C>__{buffy}
<D>__{oh, god, no... not yet...}
<A>__{lothos rises from the pool, smiling. buffy is clearly paralyzed by fear.}
<C>__{lothos}
<D>__{i knew you'd come.}
<A>__{he moves toward her.}
<C>__{lothos}
<P>__{(continuing)}
<D>__{you knew it, too, didn't you? all your life, dreaming... waiting to feed me.}
<A>__{buffy is suddenly galvanized into action. she throws a few punches at lothos, but he takes them without flinching. she grabs at the stake in what remains of amilyn's chest. lightning quick, lothos closes his hand around her and squeezes till the stake splinters and she screams with pain. he knocks her back on her ass. she starts moving backward, away from him, but it is hard enough for her to make her way through the thick gore. lothos contemplates amilyn's corpse, and his face darkens.}

<D>__{ah, my fool is dead. he was careless, always. still, i will pull out your tongue for that.}
<P>__{(coming toward her)}
<D>__{don't you understand? i've killed you a dozen times. your life is not a blink of my eye, not a single breath. i have lived in the shadows, in the pulsing filth behind men's eyes. a thousand years, and more. i have conversed with the worms that fed on my corpse and i have bathed in the blood of emperors.}

<D>__{have you ever thrown up in the front row of a richard marx concert?}
<C>__{lothos}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{and she is up, turning to run. he is thrown momentarily by her insolence.}
