<L>__{interior cubic route, bullpen day}
<A>__{it is a maze of cubicles iced by harsh fluorescence. it is a mill of data research, where the tapping of fingers on computer keypads never ends...}
<L>__{interior trevor's cubicle day}
<A>__{... no thanks to trevor, who has already resumed his head in hands position at his desk. he rubs his eyes, seemingly blinded by the screen staring back at him. a man trevor's age rolls up on his office chair beside trevor, banging into the desk. bret. trevor's co worker and cubicle mate.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{hey bret. christ, my head feels like a split coconut.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{dude there is a track on the carpet between here and the bathroom. it was made by your ass. you've been dragging it all fucking week. what happened to you yesterday?}
<A>__{bret eyes trevor suspiciously. then smiling...}
<C>__{bret }
<D>__{you never came back after lunch. did you get a piece o'ass, you bastard?}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{give me a break. i checked back into the hospital amongst other things.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{hospital? you haven't been to the hospital since uh...}
<C>__{trevor}
<D>__{since what?}
<C>__{bret}
<P>__{(getting uncomfortable)}
<D>__{look never mind. just get some numbers going any numbers at all will due. the hills have eyes remember?}
<A>__{bret casually gestures to a surveillance camera overhead that sweeps across the room like a prison spotlight.}
<C>__{bret }
<D>__{i'm just looking out for ya.}
<A>__{bret slides back over to his work station. trevor puts his hands on the computer keys and starts to type. a jolt of pain rips through his cranium forcing him to stop. bret stops typing and breathes an exasperated sigh.}
<C>__{bret}
<D>__{sixty five point three percent of all headaches are due to low sugar levels in the bloodstream trevor.}
<A>__{a light bulb seems to go off over trevor's head.}
