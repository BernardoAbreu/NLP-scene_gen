<A>__{tom grandy, 35, long hair, small beard, loose limbed, wearing scrubs, saunters down the hall, wearing a vaguely goofy smile. wills watches him approach with some apprehension.}
<C>__{lisa }
<D>__{the surgeon that recommended him said, and these are his words not mine, "don't let his appearance fool you. he's brilliant and has balls the size of your head."}

<A>__{wills listens to dr. grandy who speaks casually, more like a benign hippie than a renowned surgeon. charlotte's x rays hang between them in an illuminated view box }
<C>__{grandy}
<D>__{listen, i'm not gonna bullshit you. if she were a baby, she'd have a decent chance, 'cause these sorts of tumors can regress like crazy, but she's twenty and... i don't know, man... i've never seen anything like it.}
<P>__{(pointing at the x ray)}
<D>__{i mean, look! it's wrapped around her vital structures like an octopus!}
<P>__{(sitting)}
<D>__{you know, just once i'd like to get sent something simple. a "cabbage," a valve replacement. even a good old fashioned transplant. but it doesn't happen anymore. it's the downside of being good at my job.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{good? they say there's no one better.}
<C>__{grandy}
<D>__{i don't know. i'm like most people. i do the best i can.}
<C>__{wills}
<D>__{can your best save her?}
<C>__{grandy}
<D>__{probably not.}
