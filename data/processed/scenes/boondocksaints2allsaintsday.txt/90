<A>__{silence. she removes her ear plugs and the sound returns. we are on a very different looking scene. csi, forensics, even dolly and duffy wait with baited breath. greenly is not present.}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{o'kay. here's how it all went down.}
<A>__{dolly and duffy open their notepads.}
<L>__{interior flashback, el cava never}
<A>__{northside stands facing off with the southside. all brugliones are frozen in place. eunice saunters down the middle. cool music...}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{a secret gathering of the brugliones. the topic of discussion? weak leadership and betrayal. n.s. bruglione #1 yakavetta's hiding from these jesus freaks and making us look like pussies. s.s. bruglione #1 and he's hanging all of us out to dry to boot.}
<A>__{a pause as they size each other up.}
<D>__{n.s. bruglione #2 all right. i will be the first to say it.}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{the enemy of my enemy is my friend. so, even with all their old vendettas... n.s. bruglione #2 ...i say fuck the yakavettas.}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{and there it is. guess what comes nexterior}
<A>__{eunice points to men as he moves down the line.}
<C>__{eunice }
<D>__{red rover. red rover. s.s. bruglione #2 we're taking over.}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{ah. easier uttered than accomplished. the north end and the south end may as well be the hetfields and the mccoys. these fellas...they just don't get on.}
<A>__{all the brugliones yell over one another.}
<D>__{n.s. bruglione #3 fuck you! the north end built that racket from the ground up! s.s. bruglione #3 south end's been carrying your fucking asses for years! n.s. bruglione #3 15 percent?! in your dreams, asshole! s.s. bruglione #3 whoa! just went up to twenty, fuck stick!}
<A>__{s.s. brulione #1 flashes a gun in his waist band.}
<D>__{s.s. bruglione #1 you want some of this, you mutt?!}
<A>__{n.s. bruglione #1 pulls his weapon.}
<D>__{n.s. bruglione #1 let's see what you got!}
<A>__{they all pull and level at one another. they freeze in place and all yelling ceases as eunice walks down the middle.}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{oh, the cliche. a mexican stand off in a mexican restaurant.}
<A>__{eunice looks deeply at all the men as she turns a slow circle.}
<C>__{eunice }
<D>__{they cut each other to pieces...and nobody walked away. who knows who fired first. could have been any one of them. but somebody let it loose.}
<P>__{(pointing to men)}
<D>__{and duck, duck, duck...}
<A>__{eunice stands before s.s. brulione #2.}
<C>__{eunice }
<D>__{goose.}
<A>__{boom! they all start shooting as eunice stands in the crossfire unaffected. men fall dead and we see the relevance of each thing eunice did to doctor the scene. whip pan...}
