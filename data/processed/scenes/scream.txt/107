<D>__{corn syrup. same stuff they used for pig's blood in carrie.}
<A>__{sidney is dumbfounded. slowly, she takes a step back, moving into the dark refines of the kitchen. billy, lurches forward in a fake out, baiting her. she takes another step back petrified. close on billy's face. it is no longer familiar to sidney. there is something inhuman now about his features. his expression is pure evil. she takes another step back, shrinking into the dark kitchen. the camera takes a moment to adjust to the darkness as the outline of a figure appears...}
<B>__{standing right behind sidney.}
<A>__{she continues to back up, moving right into the arms of...}
<B>__{stu}
<A>__{sidney spins around...her mouth open in speechless horror.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{stu...please...help me...}

<P>__{(whispering into phone)}
<D>__{surprise, sidney.}
<A>__{his voice sounds affected now...the voice of the killer. sidney looks back to billy, then to stu, then to billy again. it becomes all too clear. she stands between them, her mind racing, calculating...}
<B>__{she bolts into the living room}
<A>__{if for no other reason than to put space between her and them...they stand in the entryway, trapping her in.}

<A>__{sidney stands, trying hard to hold a calm resolve. a noise comes from the kitchen. a low dragging sound. stu reappears from the front hall...wrestling with something...someone... close on stu...he has a body in tow, he thrusts it forward and it rolls into the living room. sidney looks down to find...}
<B>__{her father}
<A>__{bound and gagged. his eyes wide in fear, very much alive.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{daddy!}
<A>__{she starts for him.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{close enough.}
<A>__{stu places the cellular phone in mr. prescott's shirt pocket.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{guess, i won't be needing this anymore.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{why are you doing this?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{it's all part of the game.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{it's called guess how i'm going to die!}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{fuck you.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{we already played that game. you lost, remember?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{you have to play, sid. don't want to disappoint your dad. he's been waiting around all night.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{it's an easy game. we ask you a question. if you get it wrong you die.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{and if you get it right you die.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{you're crazy both of you.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{the official term is "psychotic".}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{you'll never get away with this.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{tell that to cotton weary. you wouldn't believe how easy it was to frame him.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{yeah, we just watched a few movies. took a few notes. it was fun.}
<A>__{billy and stu relish their madness, proud of themselves. sidney looks to her dad, sees the tears in his eyes. she looks back to billy, unflinching..a determined look on her face.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{why did you kill my mother?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{why? why? did you hear that, stu? i think she wants a motive. hmmm...i don't really believe in motives, sid. i mean, did norman bates have a motive?}
<A>__{stu plays along, shaking his head.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{nope.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{and did they really ever explain why hannibal lecter liked to eat people? don't think so. you see, it's scarier when there's no motive, sid.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(fighting tears)}
<D>__{i don't understand...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{we did your mom a favor, sid. the woman was a slut bag whore who flashed her shit all over town like she was sharon stone or something.}
<C>__{stu}
<P>__{(laughing)}
<D>__{..so we put her out of her misery. i mean, let's face it, your mom was no sharon stone.}
<A>__{stu cracks up over this while billy turns very serious.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{is that motive enough for you? or how about this? did you know your slut mother was sleeping with my dad and she's the reason my mom moved out and deserted me.}
<A>__{a sudden silence. sidney is rigid with shock, his words resonant with truth.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{even stu is surprised with his seriousness.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{think about it. on the off chance i get caught a motive like that could divide a jury for years, don't you think?. you took my mother, so i took yours. big sympathy factor. maternal abandonment causes serious deviant behavior. it certainly fucked you up. it made you have sex with a psychopath.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{that's right and now that you're no longer a virgin. you gotta die those are the rules.}
<A>__{billy sits the gun down on the table near the foyer. and then moves to sidney with the butcher knife in hand.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{pretend this is all just a scary movie, sid. how do you think it's going to end?}
<A>__{sidney doesn't respond.}
<C>__{stu}
<P>__{(excited)}
<D>__{this is the best part, sid. billy's got it all figured out. why do you think we kept your father alive so long? why did we save you for last?}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{you know what time it is, sid? it's after midnight. it's your mother's anniversary. we killed her exactly one year ago today.}
<A>__{billy turns to stu with the knife. they eye each other.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{ready?}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{yeah...}
<A>__{billy pulls the knife back and brings it forward quickly, slicing into stu. he stumbles to ho his knees, wincing in pain.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{jesus...}
<A>__{sidney screams...as blood gushes..real blood, a dark, deep red. stu inspects the wound to his side...then he smiles...}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{good one. my turn.}
<A>__{he takes the knife from billy.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{don't forget stay to the side and don't go too deep.}
<A>__{stu stabs at billy's belly, puncturing him...billy doubles over...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{jesus...fuck, that hurt.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{stop it!}
<C>__{billy}
<P>__{(squelching the pain)}
<D>__{got the ending figured out yet? time's running out.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{come on, sid. think about it. your father is the chief suspect. we cloned his cellular. the evidence is there.}
<A>__{billy takes the knife and slashes at stu's arm, two quick cuts...he doubles over...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{what if your father snapped? your mom's anniversary set him off and he went on a murder spree, killing everyone...}
<C>__{stu}
<P>__{(in major pain)}
<D>__{except for me and billy...we were left for dead...}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{and then he killed you and then shoots himself in the head. it's a perfect ending.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{everyone dies but us. we get to carry on and plan the sequel. let's face it, these days you gotta have a sequel.}
<A>__{stu takes the knife and cuts at billy.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{you sick fucks you've seen one too many movies.}
<A>__{billy looks at her, bent over, crazed.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{oh sid, don't blame the movies...movies don't create psychos. movies just make psychos more creative.}
<A>__{stu staggers a bit.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{that's it, billy. i can't take any more. i'm feeling woozy.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{get the gun. i will untie pops.}
<A>__{billy moves to sidney's father.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{where'd you put it?}
<A>__{stu is searching the foyer for the gun.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{it's on the table.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{no, it's not.}
<A>__{billy hobbles over. the gun is gone.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{where the fuck is it?}
<C>__{voice}
<P>__{(off camera)}
<D>__{right here, asshole.}
<A>__{billy and stu look up in unison to see... gale weathers correspondent from inside story standing in the front door way, gun in hand. her body tattered and bloody. her hair a mess.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{i thought she was dead.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{she looked dead. still does.}
<A>__{gale holds the gun firm, in total control.}
<C>__{gale}
<D>__{i've got an ending for you. the reporter left for dead in the newsvan comes to, stumbles upon you two dipshits, finds the gun, fumbles your plan, and saves the day.}
<A>__{sidney steps forward.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i like that ending.}
<A>__{billy lunges at gale, but she holds steady. billy and stu eye each other.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{she can't get both of us.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{odds are she'll miss anyway.}
<A>__{in a mad rush, they storm gale, heading straight at her. she pulls the trigger, but nothing happens...the safety is on. billy charges forward, grabbing hold of the front door, slamming it shut. it catches gale in the face, knocking her backwards out the door. she goes down...out.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{cool move.}
<A>__{billy steps out the front door and retrieves the gun from where gale lays. then he turns back inside the house to find...}
<B>__{sidney gone.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{where'd she go?}
<A>__{stu looks around, staggering now, bleeding heavily...sidney has completely disappeared. only her father, bound and gagged remains in the living.}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i don't know billy but i'm hurtin'.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{where the fuck did she go?}
<A>__{suddenly, the phone rings. billy and stu look at each other. completely surprised. billy scrambles over to the phone.}

<A>__{billy looks around the living room.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{find her.}
<A>__{billy is fuming now...slightly staggering...and starting to lose it. he screams at stu who has fallen to his knees.}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{find her you dipshit!}
<C>__{stu}
<D>__{i can't...i'm bad off, billy. you cut to deep.}
<A>__{billy throws the phone at stu. he mouths to him, so sid can't hear. "talk to her..." then billy takes off for the kitchen. stu takes the phone.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(aware)}
<D>__{so stu, what's your motive? billy's got one. the police are on their way. what are you going to tell them?}
<C>__{stu}

<D>__{i'm gonna rip you up bitch. just like your slut whore mother.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{gotta find me first, you pansy assed mama's boy.}
<A>__{billy starts ripping the room up, overturning furniture in a mad fit of rage...when he notices the hall closet. touche! he smiles deliriously, heading for it, ripping it open as... a ghost masked figure strikes from within, with an umbrella, the sharp end hitting him in the chest as it fans out. billy stumbles back, stunned, as the ghost comes at him again...the umbrella lodges in his chest, and he goes down. sidney rips the ghost mask off her head. she looks at billy, disgusted, throwing the mask on billy's now still body. a movement behind her sends her reeling around to find... randy slowly sitting up. his body drenched in blood. he's alive...barely. he looks to sidney...through pain...}
<C>__{randy}
<D>__{you know what i hate most about horror movies? the final scene...it just goes on and on...and it gets so stupid...}
<A>__{randy manages to stand when a figure comes leaping at him, completely unexpected...it's stu...barreling into him...they fall back into the living room. sidney grabs the gun next to billy and turns to the living room to find... randy and stu rolling across the floor in a dead lock, fighting, both seriously injured...sid tries to find aim when a... hand grabs hold of sidney's ankle, toppling her to the floor...once again she finds billy on top of her...}
<B>__{in the living room}
<A>__{randy and stu pound at each other, beating and clawing... on sidney as she fights viciously, attacking with everything she's got... randy is desperately trying to pry away from stu...he grabs hold of the television set and tries to pull himself off the floor out of stu's clutch... his hands find the top of the tv...the vcr...he yanks on it, gripping it with his hands, bringing it around with force crashing the vcr into stu's head. stu drops. on sidney as she digs her hand into billy's open chest wound. he cries out bloody murder. her other hand brings the gun up to his face...but he head bunts it out the front door...suddenly a flash of silver appears above sidney. billy has grasped the butcher knife...he rises it high above sidney ready to strike...when a bullet rips through the foyer striking billy knocking him back into the living room. sidney looks up to see... gale weathers, holding the gun in a death grip as smoke rises above the gun's chamber. sidney sits up as gale moves to her, helping her. their eyes meet. a life truce.}
