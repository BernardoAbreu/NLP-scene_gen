<L>__{interior veronica's bedroom night}
<A>__{veronica lies on the floor next to a vodka bottle. she drinks out of a dixie cup as she talks on the phone.}
<C>__{veronica}
<D>__{no, it's okay j.d., i just kind of wanted to talk.....oh, a newsmagazine show on channel 16. really? on the suicides. no, sounds great. bye.}
<A>__{veronica hangs up and looks to her battered diary lying against the wall. she crawls to the diary and then reaches up to her night table to pull down her monocle and a pen. she sucks a cup of vodka and begins writing.}
<C>__{veronica }
<D>__{dear diary, my teen angst bullshit has a body count.}
<A>__{sitting up against her bed, veronica continues writing as j.f.k. laps up vodka from the dixie cup.}
<C>__{veronica }
<D>__{the most popular people in the school are dead. everybody's sad, but it's a good kind of sad. suicide gave heather depth, kurt a soul, ram a brain. i gave j.d. shit about the ich luge thing but what really frightens me is that i'm not frightened by what j.d.'ll do nexterior it's god versus my boyfriend and god's losing....}
<A>__{veronica drops her head back and closes her eyes, popping out her monocle. she swoons down against the bed onto the floor and curls into a fetal slumber.}
<B>__{the cafeteria}
<A>__{students eat and buzz together in typical cacophony. all are wearing black armbands. a jukebox roars. pauline fleming and an entourage of students such as peter dawson and the heathers invade the cafeteria, heads raised high.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{peter, kill the jukebox.}
<A>__{as the jukebox amusingly grinds to a halt, pauline hoists up a bullhorn to her lips and crackles...}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{could i have your attention?}
<A>__{a startled geek rodney splatters milk all over himself. students whip their heads around to the front of the cafeteria. martha dunnstock dumptruck warily looks up from her plate. pauline fleming chants with soaring self importance.}
<C>__{pauline}
<D>__{our school has been torn apart by tragedy. i'm here today to fuse it back together through love! i want everyone to clasp hands. we need to connect this cafeteria into one mighty circuit. let's begin a new happiness!}
<A>__{a tableau of dumbfounded students stare at the bullhorn woman.}
