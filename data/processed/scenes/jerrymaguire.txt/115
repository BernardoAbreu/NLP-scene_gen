<A>__{ray extends his arms, he wants a hug. jerry bends down awkwardly to give him one, and ray plants a kiss on jerry's cheek. all are surprised, especially jerry. dorothy is struck and moved. shot falls on ray who watches jerry exit with wonder. even at his age, he knows a prize when he sees one.}
