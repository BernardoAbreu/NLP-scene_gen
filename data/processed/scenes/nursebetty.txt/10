<L>__{interior sizemore motors trailer office day}
<A>__{del's very busy. he's on the rented sofa in the trailer's lounge, screwing his secretary, joyce. but as he rocks the couch, he's listening to betty's message.}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{i know you want the oldsmobile back tonight, so... i was wondering if i could take one of the new buicks.}
<A>__{del pulls out and lurches across the room. he reaches for the desk phone but misses, spilling down onto the carpet. he gathers himself and his pants up in disgust, pawing around the desktop until he finds the phone.}
<C>__{betty }
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{so, call me when you }
<C>__{del}
<D>__{whoa, whoa, whoa! hang on a second there, baby. why do you need one of the new buicks?}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{oh, you're there. you sound out of breath.}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{i ran back in to get the phone.}
<A>__{the answering machine is on, so their voices are booming. the phone cord is stretched across the trailer as he tries to get back to joyce. he motions for her to join him but she remains where she is, fuming.}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{i don't need one, but it's kind of a special night, and }
<C>__{del}
<D>__{what's so special about it?}
<A>__{long pause. joyce looks at del, incredulous. then pissed off. he signals to hold on.}
<C>__{betty }
<D>__{sue ann's taking me out and i thought it might be fun to go in a nice car...}
<A>__{joyce wriggles to a sitting position and begins to pull up her panties. del shoots her a look that says 'i'm not finished yet!' they pantomime frantically back and forth until joyce throws him the finger and slams out the door.}
<C>__{betty }
<P>__{(cont'd)}
<D>__{what was that?}
<C>__{del}
<D>__{nothing... it's, ahh, busy here. look, you don't need a lesabre to go out with sue ann. take the blue corsica. i will see you when i get home.}
<A>__{he throws the phone onto the cradle, then bangs on a window to get joyce's attention as she fires up a smoke.}
<C>__{del }
<P>__{(through the pane)}
<D>__{shit! joyce, open the damn gate, will you?!}
<A>__{as del zips up his pants joyce trudges across the lot to bring in the "closed for lunch" sign and open the gate. del silently studies the much nicer car lot next door for a moment. he takes in the banners, the signs, etc.}
<C>__{del }
<D>__{... that's what we need, some goddamn flags.}
