<D>__{what did i tell you?}
<A>__{jerome nods. however, to his eyes the rising yolk is nothing but an out of focus, abstract ink blot.}

<D>__{you'll be nexterior}
<C>__{irene}
<D>__{i don't think so. the only trip i will make in space is around the sun }

<P>__{(matter of fact)}
<D>__{but unless they come up with something between now and then, i won't live much past 67.}
<A>__{jerome's mouth drops a little, betraying his surprise at the statement from a woman plainly still in her twenties.}
