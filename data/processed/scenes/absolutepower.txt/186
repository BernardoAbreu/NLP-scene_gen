<L>__{interior luther's bedroom day}
<A>__{they enter. clothes tossed all over.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{he sure took off in a hurry. what scares a professional thief like that?}
<A>__{kate. no reply. she has seen something across the tiny room and is drawn to it luther's bed table and here it is! call it a montage, call it a collage, call it what you will, we are looking at dozens of photographs all of them featuring kate. many of them we saw in her apartment only here, as in the photo over the mantle, luther is there with kate and her mom. we are looking at a shrine! and there are newer photos too kate at her college graduation, kate at her law school graduation, kate and her mother coming out of an elegant restaurant, kate alone on the steps of middleton county courthouse these are not posed shots. she looks wonderful and alive in all of them kate. she looks dead now. all energy gone. she sits heavily down on the bed.}
<C>__{kate}
<P>__{(fighting tears)}
<D>__{... but he wasn't at those places...}
<P>__{(pointing to the grown up photos)}
<D>__{... college graduation; law school graduation; the night mom and i celebrated when i got a job; and me alone on the steps? i'd just won my first case, i was so proud...}
<P>__{(still fighting)}
<D>__{... i used to think... sometimes i'd come home and i'd sense he'd been in my apartment, checking the fridge, shaking his head because he never thought i ate right... it's crazy but i just knew daddy was watching over me...}
<A>__{and now she loses it, starts crying silently. seth kneels alongside her, gives her a handkerchief.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{you can do a good thing, kate }
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{ help me bring him in. just leave a message on his phone machine, you're worried about him.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{... no...}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{it's the truth you are worried about him this isn't your normal case his life may be in danger you can save him, make the call }
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{... he won't come...}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(indicating the pictures)}
<D>__{of course he'll come. you're all he has.}
<A>__{kate, staring at the photos, trying to get control.}
<C>__{seth}
<P>__{(moving in)}
<D>__{kate, he's on the run and he's scared and he's right to be scared because he's going to get caught you don't know the heat on this.}
<C>__{kate}
<D>__{he's not a murderer.}
<C>__{seth}
<D>__{maybe you're right. maybe he is innocent. if so i will have him home and dry in a few hours. but what happens if some hotshot who's trying to make a reputation tracks him down?}
<P>__{(beat)}
<D>__{i can guarantee his safety. you make the call, i make a promise: you'll have your father, home and dry...}
