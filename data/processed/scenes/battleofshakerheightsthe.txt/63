<L>__{interior bowland house, dining room night}
<A>__{kelly eats with the bowlands bart's mom, mathilda, his dad harrison, and tabby and bart. the bowlands dress up a bit for dinner, like any good wasp family.}
<C>__{bart}
<P>__{(to harrison)}
<D>__{ but i told you i want to take german }
<C>__{harrison}
<D>__{german's a cold war language. you can't get any kind of state department position without more diverse linguistic training than that. you'll take chinese.}
<A>__{bart frowns.}
<C>__{harrison}
<D>__{are we on the same page?}
<C>__{bart}
<P>__{(mutters)}
<D>__{same page.}
<A>__{everyone eats in silence.}
<C>__{mathilda}
<P>__{(to tabby)}
<D>__{so darling, when are you going to bite the bullet and do the seating arrangement?}
<A>__{tabby puts down her fork.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{i can't deal with that stuff, ma. i don't care who sits next to whom. i should have eloped.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{after all, mrs. bowland, sometimes when you bite the bullet, it explodes in your mouth.}
<A>__{mathilda looks surprised. this could go either way.}
<C>__{mathilda}
<P>__{(tentatively)}
<D>__{why, i've never thought about it before but that is a rather strange expression, isn't it? you wouldn't say, "sooner or later you've got to put the grenade in your pants," would you?}
<C>__{harrison}
<D>__{but have you ever noticed how in movies they always bite the grenade before they throw it?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{yeah, but they never take a bite out of their pants.}
<A>__{everyone but bart laughs. tabby throws kelly a grateful glance, for getting her out of a conversation she didn't want to have.}
<C>__{mathilda}
<D>__{what an unusual conversation! do you have similar discussions at the dinner table with your family, kelly?}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{basically. i ask why all the furniture is missing and my dad reminisces about dropping acid and watching neil armstrong walk on the moon.}
<A>__{all but bart laughs again.}
<C>__{tabby}
<D>__{he talks about art. bart mathilda you do?}
<A>__{kelly looks down at his plate.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{my mother's kind of an artist, so }
<C>__{harrison}
<D>__{you come from a creative family, do you?}
<A>__{mathilda salts her food.}
<C>__{mathilda}
<D>__{i wish my boys would talk to me about my passions. i can't get them anywhere near the subject of my garden.}
<C>__{kelly}
<D>__{i noticed your magnolias. very fine specimens.}
<C>__{mathilda}
<D>__{they are fine, aren't they?}
<A>__{mathilda beams.}
<C>__{bart}
<P>__{(ironic)}
<D>__{is there nothing you can't discuss?}
<A>__{if anyone notices the slight edge to bart's voice, they ignore it.}
<C>__{harrison}
<D>__{here, kelly, try a bit of these leeks. minnie has a way with the white sauce.}
