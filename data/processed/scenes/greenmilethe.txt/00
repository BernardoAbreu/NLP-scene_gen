<A>__{screenplay by frank darabont from the novel by stephen king first draft}
<A>__{"we each owe a death, there are no exceptions..." a song begins, distant as a faded memory on an old victrola: once i built a railroad, made it run... made it race against time...once i built a railroad, now it's done...brother, can you spare a dime... opening credit sequence plays against footage of the great depression, images haunting and sepia toned, defining an era. the bread lines...the soup kitchens...the dust bowl refugees heading west with their possessions on their backs and no hope in their eyes...the strutting gangster royalty flaunting their bootleg riches...an entire generation of lost youth riding the rials...the u.s. army troops raining truncheon blows on the half starved and forgotten veterans of world war one as "hooverville" is set afire in the very shadow of the nation's capitol... all these faces, all these lives, in a world not really so very long ago...}
