<A>__{epps spins. like a bolt of lightning he's on jaeger, grabbing him up and pulling him close.}
<C>__{epps}
<D>__{you listen to me. the whole reason we're here is because of you and that map of yours. i didn't do all this for nothing, and i'm not leaving with nothing. if you think for a second i'm giving up just 'cause you're too tired to turn over some dirt, then you don't know john epps too well, do you? so you dig, and you keep on digging 'til i say you don't have to dig anymore.}
<A>__{epps pushes jaeger back and he goes down to the ground hard. a fire burns inside him. a fire that burns out of control. before he even knows what he's doing jaeger springs to his feet, shovel in hand, bringing it down in a long arc for epps' head. epps bears him coming. he deftly side steps the blow, grabs hold of jaeger and forces him down. they roll around violently like wild dogs trading blows and trying to work the other into a choke hold.}
