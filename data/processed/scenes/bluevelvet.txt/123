<L>__{80. interior beaumonts' car lincoln street night}
<A>__{they turn in to the street where dorothy vallens lives and glide to a stop close to the building. jeffery cuts the engine. it is very quiet. both are looking around to see if anyone is out or watching. jeffrey tries to look up out the front windshield to the seventh floor. it is dark. sandy moves. every tiny sound is heard. sandy looks at jeffrey for some time, then back at the building.}

<D>__{okay, okay. bye.}
<A>__{jeffrey gets out of the car and shuts the door. he looks in one more time at sandy. they stare at each other silently. jeffrey can see her lips in the black darkness of the car. sandy watches him cross the lawn and go into the apartment building. she slides over and sits in the driver's seat.}
