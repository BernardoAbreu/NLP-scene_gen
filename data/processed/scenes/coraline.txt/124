<A>__{coraline scrambles through the door, key in hand, and grabs the door's handle. before she can shut it, the beldam's head thrusts inside.}
<C>__{beldam}
<D>__{... disobey your mother??!!}
<A>__{coraline kicks her in the face, knocking her back. the cat takes off down the tunnel. coraline nearly shuts the door, when needle fingers grab hold through the crack. the door starts to pull open!}
<C>__{coraline}
<D>__{please...shut!!}
<A>__{the ghost children's fluttery, dismembered hands fly out from her bag and grab hold of coraline's hands that grip the door's handle. and her strength is quadrupled. the door starts to shut. the beldam snatches desperately at coraline, reaching through the closing gap with one thin claw. there's a final moment of resistance the beldam's wire thin wrist caught in the door and then snap! the door shuts, and the beldam's hand drops to the ground! she screeches like a metal rake on pavement! coraline just manages to lock the door in the dark when it is pounded from the other side, green light coming through cracks! she takes off down the tunnel, stooped down, as fast as she can. the pounding grows more insistent, green light flashing.}
<C>__{beldam }
<D>__{don't leave me! don't leave me!!! i will die without you!!!!}
<A>__{and then the tunnel behind coraline starts to grow shorter, like a collapsing accordion and the pounding far door with the blind, one handed beldam on the other side starts to catch up to her! ahead, daylight appears, and then the little door to the real world!}
