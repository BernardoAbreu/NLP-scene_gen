<A>__{with a whoosh and the crack of mighty wings, jake returns. jake and neytiri alight from his legendary mount. around them hundreds of banshees are landing. a gathering of eagles. from above we can see hundreds of na'vi streaming down into the well of souls and many hundreds more camped in the forest above it. direhorse riders are arriving along many trails. banshee riders circle and swoop, darkening the sky above the grotto. jake, standing next to the leonopteryx, watches his army gathering.}
