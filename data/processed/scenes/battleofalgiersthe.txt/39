<L>__{39 blockade marengo. outside. day. august 10, 1956.}
<A>__{at each blockade, there are two ramps, an entrance and an exit to the casbah. the algerians and some europeans crowd around in both directions. the soldiers are wearing fatigues with helmets and machine guns. the europeans are not requested to show identity papers. the algerians are often frisked, and accept this fact silently, patiently, without any sign of intolerance. but if the soldiers attempt to search a woman, then, it is different. a woman begins to shout, while waving her arms wildly, and pushes away the soldier who had tried to search her. a stream of incoherent words. other algerians intervene; they push forward threateningly. the soldier is young; he is timid and frightened. he looks over his back for help. a police officer approaches. he has a different tone, and a very self assured manner. he shouts at the algerians to calm down.}
