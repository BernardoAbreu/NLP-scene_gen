<L>__{exterior elm street house}
<A>__{the dream police and karen bolt out the front door and run down the street as a rumble joins freddy's thunderous shriek and the entire town begins to shake. we stay with a shot of the house as the noise and vibrations continue. and the elm street house explodes. the black cloud punches out the roof and the walls, sending wood and debris flying everywhere. the rubble flies into the air, hangs there for a beat, then falls to the ground. all is silent. and the dark cloud turns white. the milky fog spreads out.}
