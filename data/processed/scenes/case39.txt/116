<L>__{exterior church park day}
<A>__{sitting on a bench in a park that occupies the shadow of the old stone church, emily and mike talk privately. his wife pushing his young son on a playground swing.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{`no such thing as a bad kid, only bad parents.' i always believed that. it's a lie. her parents aren't crazy.}
<C>__{barron}
<D>__{you wanna end up where they did keep talking like this.}
<P>__{(off her look)}
<D>__{i'm not judging you. you're grieving for doug and you're still confused about what diego did.}
<C>__{emily}

<C>__{emily}
<D>__{why did she lie about calling him?}
<C>__{barron}
<D>__{`cause she's a liar, that doesn't mean she made him do it. look, let me tell you what lucy is. lucy is a damaged child, a deceitful child, a manipulative child. but a damaged, deceitful, manipulative child is not a demon. ask my brother in law, he's got a couple of `em.}
