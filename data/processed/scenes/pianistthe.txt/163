<A>__{szpilman follows the german captain through a double door, hanging off its hinges, into a room with a broken table in the centre, what once was the dining room. and then through another set of doors. the german captain's boots echo. they come into a spacious room. faint moonlight filters through the large windows. fallen masonry and broken glass. a couple of chairs. and a grand piano in the corner. the german captain points at the piano.}

<D>__{play.}
<A>__{szpilman hesitates, then limps to the piano, puts down the tin, and opens the lid. he turns and drags one of the chairs over and sits. the german captain stands and watches. szpilman glances surreptitiously at his hands, and then he plays chopin. the german captain listens, expressionless. the pale moonlight shows him to be a handsome, elegant man. szpilman finishes playing. silence. somewhere, a cat mews. distant burst of rifle fire. the german captain stares at szpilman. after a moment:}

<D>__{are you hiding here?}
<A>__{szpilman nods.}
<C>__{the german captain}
<D>__{jew?}
<A>__{long pause. szpilman just stares at him.}
<C>__{the german captain}
<D>__{where are you hiding?}
<C>__{szpilman}
<P>__{(in german)}
<D>__{in the attic.}
<C>__{the german captain}
<D>__{show me.}
