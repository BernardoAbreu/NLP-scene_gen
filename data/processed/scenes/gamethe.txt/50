<A>__{same angle, quick shot of the body of mr. van orton, sprawled across the steps in much the same position as the wino, flat on his stomach, head twisted at a grotesque angle. his bathrobe is even similar in color to the wino's overcoac.}

<D>__{hello! what are you doing here?}
<A>__{the body doesn't stir. he approaches gingerly.}
<C>__{schuyler}
<D>__{wonderful. you ok? you dead?}
<A>__{he crouches by the wino, winces at a strong smell, covers his nose. he reaches out to touch the body, but hesitates, pulls back. alive or dead, he doesn't want to have anything to do with this person.}

<D>__{shit, shit, shit...}
<A>__{the "wino" suddenly springs up like a jack in the box, bending backwards impossibly at the hips. schuyler lets out a cry and scrambles back toward his car. the head swivels to face him it's a grotesque harlequin, its head made of colored glass, lit from within. the mouth drops open and a tongue in the shape of a corkscrew springs out. a small key on a hook dangles from the tip of the tongue. one of the harlequin's glass eyes winks. schuyler stares in amazement for a few moments. close on the dangling key as schuyler fingers it. the key catches the light and we see the letters "crs" embossed on it.}
