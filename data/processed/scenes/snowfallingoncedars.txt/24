<A>__{hatsue and ishmael, both 12, are sprawled on the ground, sheltered in the hollowed out base of a cedar tree. they watch the rain as it pummels the woods around them. she is speaking, carefully, thoughtfully. he listens with complete attention.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{she would tell me stories of this woman and her lessons. as if complaining, or at least ex plaining her world...}
<A>__{he shifts his position, his body brushing against hers, which makes him reflexively pull away. she seems not to notice.}
<C>__{ishmael }
<D>__{but i always fantasized. the lessons were for me.}
