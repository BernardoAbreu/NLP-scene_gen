<L>__{interior psych ward conference room minutes later (day)}
<A>__{cole is agitated, speaking forcefully.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{this is a place for crazy people! i'm not crazy!}
<A>__{railly, four other psychiatric residents, including railly's best friend, marilou martin, and their chief, dr. owen fletcher, sit around a beat up conference table, watching cole, who sits facing the doctors, with billings looming behind him. (some of the doctors bear a strong resemblance to the scientists of the future.)}
<D>__{resident #1 we don't use that term..."crazy", mr. cole.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{well, you've got some real nuts in here! listen to me, all of you i have to tell you something that's going to be difficult for you to understand, but...}
<C>__{dr. railly}
<D>__{james...please. these are all doctors here and we want to help you.}
<C>__{dr. fletcher}
<D>__{mr. cole last night you told dr. railly you thought it was...}
<P>__{(checking a file)}
<D>__{1995. ... how about right now? do you know what year it is right now?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{1989. look, i'm not confused. there's been a mistake, i've been sent to the wrong place.}
<A>__{suddenly, cole reaches out and billings lunges forward, but cole is just grabbing a pad and pencil.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{hey, i'm not going to hurt anybody.}
<A>__{fletcher restrains billings with a hand signal.}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(drawing)}
<D>__{do any of you know anything about the army of the twelve monkeys? they paint this, stencil it, on buildings, all over the place.}
<A>__{cole waves a sketch of the dancing monkey logo we saw earlier.}
<C>__{dr. casey}
<D>__{mr. cole...}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{right. i guess you wouldn't, this is 1989, they're probably not active yet. that makes sense! okay. listen to me, three billion people died in 1995. three billion, got that? almost the whole population. of the world! only about one percent survived.}
<A>__{doctors exchange knowing looks. this is an old story, apparently.}
<D>__{resident #2 are you going to save us, mr. cole?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{save you? how can i save you? it already happened! i can't save you. i'm simply trying to get some information for people in the present so that someday...}
<P>__{(sees their eyes)}
<D>__{you don't believe me. you think i'm crazy. but i'm not crazy. i'm a convict, sure, i have a quick temper, but i'm as sane as anyone in this room. i...}
<A>__{cole stops, sees dr. fletcher tapping his pencil. cole's seen that tapping before in the future! it disorients him.}
<C>__{dr. railly}
<D>__{can you tell us the name of the prison you've come from?}
<A>__{cole doesn't answer. he's staring at the tapping pencil.}
<C>__{dr. fletcher}
<D>__{does this bother you, mr. cole?}
<C>__{cole}
<P>__{(recovering, new tack)}
<D>__{no! look, i don't belong here! what i need to do is make a telephone call to straighten everything out.}
<C>__{dr. fletcher}
<D>__{who would you call, mr. cole, who would straighten everything out?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{scientists. i'm supposed to report in to them. they'll want to know they sent me to the wrong time.}
<C>__{dr. fletcher}
<D>__{so you could talk to these scientists and they do what? send you to the future?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{no, no. i can't talk to them. it's called, "voice mail". i'm supposed to leave messages. they monitor it from the present. resident #2 "from the present." we're not in the present now, mr. cole?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{no, no. this is the past. this has already happened. listen... resident #3 mr. cole, you belong in 1995 that's the present, is that it?}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{no, 1995 is the past, too. look...}
<C>__{dr. fletcher}
<D>__{these scientists, mr. cole? are they doctors like ourselves?}
<A>__{two of the residents exchange quick knowing looks.}
<C>__{cole}
<D>__{no! i mean yes, but... look, i've been given a lot of drugs but i'm still perfectly lucid. you have to let me use the phone. one call!}
<A>__{cole looks desperately toward railly, pleading eyes meeting hers.}
