<L>__{interior detective kincaid's office day}
<A>__{kincaid stands at his desk trying to put the pieces of this puzzle together. sidney's seated beside him, staring at a stack of books on 'script writing and selling your work in hollywood'.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{what do you know about trilogies?}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{you mean like, movie trilogies?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{you seem to like movies, detective.}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{call me mark, would you? cause i'm gonna keep calling you sidney.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i will call you mark when you catch the killer, detective.}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{all i know about movie trilogies is in the third one, all bets are off.}
<C>__{sidney}
<P>__{(noticing a huge file on her)}
<D>__{did you request this case?}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{no, they tend to put me on the ones that deal with the business. i grew up here, and i know my way around the studios.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{must be exciting, beautiful place, beautiful people.}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{to me hollywood is about death.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{i'm a homicide detective, remember? when you see what i see day in and day out, the violence that people do to each other, you get haunted. i think you know about that.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{i know what it's like to see ghosts that don't go away. to be watching a scary movie in your head, whether you want to or not, watching it alone.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{ghosts are tough, you can't shoot ghosts.}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{can't arrest ghosts. but the best way to stop being haunted is to be with people. you're here, you're not hiding, you've done the right thing, miss prescott.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{hmm.}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{what did you know about your mother?}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{i used to think i had the perfect mom, perfect family. till i found out i was wrong. she had a secret life, and i tried to understand that, and soon as i thought i had, more secrets. i don't' know who my mom was.}
<P>__{(a beat)}
<D>__{sometimes i feel like i'm just learning about my mother for the first time. you know, with tv and those movies and what not. god sometimes i feel like i'm just learning about myself for the first time. like i'm watching my life instead of living in it.}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<P>__{(a long beat)}
<D>__{here's the deal, i'm off to search the soundstage. that's good news.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{how is that good news?}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{because, that means that we're dealing with an ordinary, flesh and blood killer. and i know how to handle guys like that.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{oh yeah, how?}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<D>__{catch him, or kill him.}
<A>__{kincaid readies himself to leave. he snags up his holstered gun, his car keys, jacket, etc.}
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{hey detective? what's your favorite scary movie?}
<A>__{detective kincaid pauses, he leans over sidney's chair, his penetrating eyes glaring right into hers.}
<C>__{detective kincaid}
<P>__{(sotto)}
<D>__{my life.}
<A>__{kincaid exits, door slamming shut behind him. a beat, then }
<C>__{sidney}
<D>__{mine too.}
