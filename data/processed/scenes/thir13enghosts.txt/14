<L>__{exterior glass cube}
<A>__{a team member runs, looks over his shoulder at the pursuing breaker. he doesn't see where he's going and runs straight against a blood splashed glass wall. he's blundered into the glass cube. in an instant, the breaker's inside with him. his entry trips an unseen switch. the final glass wall slides down, sealing the cube. as it does, the howling, and the team member's screams, drop to silence. inside the cube, something awful happens, but we can't see through the smears of blood. rafkin regains his senses, scrambles towards the cube.}

<D>__{no! oh, christ, no }
<A>__{inside the cube, the breaker turns, realizes he's been trapped, launches himself at the bloody sheet of glass, presses his face to it, howls. rafkin recoils as the breaker pounds at the glass. with each ghostly blow, the symbol glows red, but the glass seems to have the power to contain the force: it holds.}

<D>__{oh, that piss you off, does it? you know what pisses me off? a dead guy throwing buicks at me!}
<A>__{rafkin eyes the horror, then tugs off his glasses. the breaker disappears. rafkin collapses in exhaustion.}
