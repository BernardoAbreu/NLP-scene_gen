<A>__{tyler is seated in jack's lap. tyler holds the gun in jack's mouth, his arm around him. this huge room is being remodeled. tyler and jack are seated near floor to ceiling windows affording a spectacular view of the city. tyler looks at his watch.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{one minute.}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{i think this is about where we came in.}
<C>__{tyler}
<P>__{(looking out window)}
<D>__{this is the beginning. we're at ground zero. maybe you should say a few words, to mark the occasion.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i... ann....iinn.. ff....nnyin...}
<A>__{jack tongues the barrel to the side of his mouth.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(still distorted)}
<D>__{i still can't think of anything.}
<A>__{tyler checks his watch.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{it's getting exciting now.}
<A>__{jack turns, so he can see down 31 stories.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{look what we've accomplished.}
<P>__{(checks watch)}
<D>__{thirty seconds.}
<P>__{(looks out windows)}
<D>__{out these windows, we will view the economic collapse. one step closer to global equilibrium. i'm glad you're here with me.}
<A>__{tyler watches the skyline, whistles at tune, waiting.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(distorted)}
<D>__{can't you call it off... ?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{it's out of our hands.}
<P>__{(looks at watch)}
<D>__{this is it.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{please...}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{fifteen seconds now. can you see alright? 10... 9... 8....}
<A>__{tyler looks out the windows, at surrounding buildings, excited. jack closes his eyes, despairing.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{5... 4... 3... 2...}
<A>__{out the window, the skyline remains unchanged. nothing. a long beat. a very dark scowl comes over tyler's face. jack opens his eyes. more waiting. tyler looks genuinely surprised, pissed off.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{what the fuck ?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{paraffin.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(relieved)}
<D>__{paraffin. your merry band mixed the nitro with paraffin. i saw it floating in the bomb.}
<P>__{(more)}
<C>__{jack }
<D>__{they must've run out of cotton and epsom salt. paraffin is iffy at best.}
<A>__{tyler rises, taking the gun from jack's mouth, starts pacing. jack rubs his sore jowls, allows himself a smile.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{damn it! god damn it...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{not exactly according to plan.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{do we have to do everything ourselves?!}
<A>__{tyler stops walking, lets out a sigh of disgust. he reaches into his pocket, taking out a walkie talkie.}
<C>__{tyler}
<P>__{(into walkie talkie)}
<D>__{... codename rooster. passcode first strike...}
<A>__{jack's eyes go wide.}
<C>__{jack}
<C>__{no...}
<C>__{tyler}
<P>__{(into walkie talkie)}
<D>__{proceed with remote detonation.}
<A>__{jack leaps tackles tyler. the gun is knocked away. jack strikes tyler's face repeatedly with his elbow, scrambles off... jack gets the gun, turns, pointing it. tyler's getting to his feet, sees the gun, annoyed. jack stands.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{haven't we already done this?}
<A>__{jack shoots twice. bullets pass right thorough tyler. tyler just rolls his eyes, drops the walkie talkie to the floor and stomps on it, crushing it.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(pointing)}
<D>__{how'd you do that?! you're a fucking figment of my imagination... you're psychogenic fugue state...}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{fuck that, maybe you're my hallucination.}
<A>__{jack falters, pointing at tyler's feet. there's no walkie talkie there. jack looks down, sees the walkie talkie crushed under his own foot.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{oh... christ...}
<A>__{jack holds his head, walks around, at his wit's end.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{why... why... why... ?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{why what?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{why can't i get rid of you? why can't i just wish you away?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{you need me.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{no, no, i don't.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i thank you, i really do. thank you, but i don't need you anymore.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{look, i can be selfish, i know that.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{i'm not blind to my own failings...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{noooo, please...}
<A>__{jack backs up against a window, numb and weary.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{from now on, we'll share marla. we've been spending too much time apart...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{... no, no, no...}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{no more running off without you. from here on out, we do it together.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{why are you doing this?!}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{i'm doing this for us.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{please understand... i've gotten all i can from this, tyler.}
<C>__{tyler}
<P>__{(sullen)}
<D>__{if i leave, you will be right back where i found you...}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{i swear on my life, i won't...}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{you will. you know you will.}
<A>__{jack stares at tyler, tears welling up, hangs his head. he looks at the gun in his hand...}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{can you live with that?}
<A>__{jack stares at the gun a long time... then... jack brings the gun up, puts the gun in his mouth. tyler cocks his head.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{what are you doing?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{what have you left for me?}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{why do you want to do that? why do you want to put that gun in your mouth?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{not my mouth. our mouth.}
<A>__{tyler is calm.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{this is interesting.}
<A>__{tyler smiles in appreciation, slowly walks forward, stands very close to jack.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{why are you going with this, ikea boy?}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{it's the only way to get rid of you...}
<A>__{jack cocks the hammer on the gun.}
<C>__{tyler}
<D>__{i can see you feel very strongly. i feel strongly too.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{hey, you and me.}
<P>__{(pause)}
<D>__{friends again?}
<A>__{their eyes are locked, unblinking. long silence.}
