<D>__{show them the courage of allah.}
<A>__{the prisoner's face braces for the pain. a red hot scimitar flashes down. the hand flips into a basket. twitching. robin is nexterior his composure fails. he flops to his knees, crying. the interrogator laughs. the jailers unlash the thongs on robin's hand. they stretch it out, forcing it down. robin goes limp, sobbing. peter catches his eye... robin winks. the scimitar. drawn from the coals. spitting flame. arcs down. robin is suddenly galvanized.}

<D>__{you will need to be yet faster.}
<A>__{a narrow opening to their left... they splash through. half running, half crawling in the dank water. fire arrows land around them. the orange smoke is choking.}
<C>__{saracen}
<D>__{poison air. hold your breath.}
<A>__{flames illuminate the walls, alive with a loathsome mass of crawling slime. peter falls. a pursuer descends on him, thrusting a blazing torch at his face. the saracen intercepts the blow. grabs the man's neck, snapping it with one mighty twist.}
<C>__{peter}
<P>__{(coughing)}
<D>__{thanks. i misjudged you.}
<C>__{saracen}
<D>__{save your breath.}
<A>__{gasping for air, they find the tunnel veers steeply down ward. a slippery, granite tube. losing purchase, they slide headlong. sharp, rusted spikes jut out from the walls ahead. robin grabs at the walls to break the fall. no use. they're picking up speed. he turns his sword crossways, bracing it against the sides of the tunnel, as a brake. sparks fly. the sword cuts into robin's chest... but it works.}
<C>__{saracen}
<D>__{allah be praised.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{amen, brother.}
<A>__{a bloodcurdling scream. a pursuing guard tumbles down the sewer chute. the three men press themselves against the wall. the man hurtles by... is impaled on the spikes. a draft of fresh air from the roof of the tunnel. using the spiked guard as a ladder, robin climbs. removes a grating.}
<L>__{exterior arab street night}
<A>__{robin's head appears... ducks back down, as a squad of mounted soldiers thunders right over him... he reappears. all clear. they're outside the prison wall. robin helps peter up.}

<A>__{swoosh. an arrow pierces through peter's chest fired from the prison wall. he reels... robin leads him under the wall for protection. shouts of alarm. soldiers approaching.}
<C>__{robin}

<A>__{robin looks despairingly to the saracen.}
<C>__{saracen}
<D>__{his wound is by the heart. we cannot save him.}
<A>__{robin knows it's true. peter pulls an insignia ring from a hidden pouch in his clothes. thrusts it into robin's hand.}
<C>__{peter}
<D>__{take this to my sister. swear you will protect her for me... swear it, robin!}
<C>__{robin}
<P>__{(reluctantly)}

<B>__{locksley.}
<A>__{seated at a table, wine goblet in hand, he pores over a wonderful illustrated bible. reading to himself for solace and strength. empty chairs surround the vast table. a deep sense of loneliness. he glances at a portrait over the fireplace... robin. the dog jumps. hackles rise. o.s. shouts. locksley unsheathes a dagger. obscures it in the folds of the bible. the door bursts open. a peasant, ragged, desperate, kenneth.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{my lord! help me.}
<A>__{he's bleeding from a face wound. another man grabs him from behind. locksley's craggy faced retainer, duncan. older than his master, but still strong, he holds kenneth back.}

<D>__{you must wait... i am sorry you were disturbed, master.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<P>__{(high anxiety)}

<C>__{locksley}
<D>__{onward then. what is this place?}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{nearby the gregor caves.}
<A>__{locksley reacts a hint of fear. they move on... ahead, the hillside glows, rimmed in eerie light. strange primitive chants, wafted on the wind. locksley ties his nervous horse to a tree. parting undergrowth, kenneth creeps forward. cries out. he's face to face with the maggot eaten skull of a goat. beyond it, a gruesome host of half skinned human skulls, all arranged on stakes. some male, others with rotting female tresses, staring eyelessly into the night. kenneth turns to run... a hand grabs him.}
<C>__{locksley}
<D>__{steady, man. they are to dissuade the faint of heart. think of gwen.}
<A>__{from the crest of the rise, they peer down into the craggy valley. a cave opening, ablaze with flames leers at them like the mouth of hell. before the cave, a circle of stones. a miniature stonehenge. a medieval orgy. men and women in masks and loose robes. dancing. drinking. reveling. pure carnality. lord locksley and kenneth watch in horror. faces ashen.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<D>__{druids.}
<C>__{locksley}
<D>__{i trusted we were rid of such evil a century ago.}
<A>__{an unearthly screech. a creature leaps into the circle of stones. grotesque gargoyle head, horns, fur covered arms and legs. a living hieronymous bosch demon. its clawed hands slash across a reveler's back, drawing blood in vicious streaks. the creature tastes the blood. the reveler is ecstatic.}
<C>__{kenneth}
<P>__{(petrified)}
<D>__{is it the devil?}
<C>__{locksley}
<D>__{if it is, i have some christian steel that will test his hide.}
<A>__{he draws his sword. a crucifix sculpted into the hilt. a girl is dragged from the cave. kenneth buries his head.}
<C>__{locksley}
<D>__{gwen?}
<A>__{kenneth nods. the demon shrieks, dervishing around gwen, who is carried onto the central plinth stone. a pagan altar, the shape of an elephant's head with its trunk raised. a masked figure stands at the head of the altar. the high priest of the dark rite. the girl's body shudders as blood red liquid is forced down her throat. the demon's voice is husky and hideous.}
<C>__{demon}
<D>__{come, my virgin flower.}
<A>__{hypnotized by the creature's voice and snake like move ments, gwen stretches herself out. a single beam of sunlight slices through the mist, like a laser. the first light of the rising sun, it strikes directly on the altar, tracking down towards the girl's heart. the demon's raised talons close in on the white flesh of her neck. gwen's eyes are open wide, in a trance. the crowd of revelers encircle the plinth. awed anticipation... a warrior's yell! sword raised, locksley thunders in on his charger. the terrified crowd parts. the demon screams like a banshee.}
<C>__{demon}
<D>__{kill him! kill him!}
<A>__{the followers throw themselves at locksley. he beats them off. the high priest issues orders to armed guards, who run to intercept. one aims a spear. locksley hacks the shaft in half. cuts men down left and right. reaches the altar stone.}
<C>__{locksley}
<D>__{gwen! up, girl, up!}
<A>__{gwen shakes off her trance. the demon launches itself at locksley. talons rip flesh from his face. with all his strength, locksley hurls the creature down.}
<C>__{locksley}
<D>__{in the name of god!}
<A>__{his broadsword swings in a mighty arc. slices across the gargoyle's skull. clean through half the face... impossibly, the demon rolls back to its feet. the head is an elaborate mask beneath are the yellow skin, white hair, and burning red eyes of an albino crone. screaming vitriol, the hag is unharmed. momentarily stunned, locksley regains his senses, hauls the girl onto his charger. the guards close in. locksley spurs his horse. rides for an opening. the masked high priest stands resolutely in his path. brandishing a burning branch. the horse is freaked. rears. locksley and the girl are thrown. unarmed, locksley charges the man. slams him into the cave wall. the mask falls. locksley gasps in recognition.}
<C>__{locksley}
<D>__{nottingham!}
<A>__{the sheriff of nottingham. powerful build, black beard, cruel intensity in every feature.}

<L>__{exterior english shore day}
<A>__{a twelfth century french sailboat at anchor. a cross on its sail. a longboat rows to shore. robin stands in the prow, in a pilgrim's hooded robe. he gazes at the approaching land. unable to wait, he leaps into the surf and wades to the beach. he kneels, pressing his hands and face into the soil.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{home. thank you, lord.}
<A>__{aslan steps from the boat, sniffing the air. the french sailors keep their distance from him. robin takes his hand.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{my friend, you have escorted me home. i beg you to free yourself of your vow. return with the boat. i know how heavy your heart must be, this far from your family and native land...}
<C>__{aslan }
<D>__{because i love them so dearly, i cannot dishonor them.}
<A>__{a sailor creeps up behind aslan, club in hand.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i thought you'd say that.}
<A>__{he nods to the sailor, who swings the club down. the saracen sidesteps, grabs the man's arm and flips him into the surf. he turns a cold stare on robin.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{no man controls my destiny. especially not one who attacks downwind and stinks of garlic.}
<A>__{robin laughs. the saracen remains intense.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{if our positions were reversed, i would have done the same. only i would have succeeded.}
<A>__{he smiles broadly. robin claps him on the shoulder.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{come, aslan. by nightfall we will celebrate your honor when we dine with my father.}
<L>__{exterior interior peasant's cottage day}
<A>__{crash! an armored foot splinters the door of a farmer's hovel. children scream and run. a soldier clubs at them, laughing. outside. more soldiers. some on horses, others on foot, with leashed hounds. pillaging. vandalizing. searching. guy gisborne: an impressive figure on horseback. strikingly handsome except that one of his ears is missing. we recognize his face from the druid ceremony. he coldly addresses a pregnant woman with a child in her arms, fanny.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{you owe the sheriff three bushels of flax.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{you starve us. first the drought, now you take what food we have left.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{for starving people, you look fat enough.}

<P>__{(emerging from the hut)}
<D>__{he's not here, sir. none but the woman and children.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<P>__{(to fanny)}
<D>__{where is your mate? the man they call little.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{he died last winter.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{is that so? we hear he is very much alive. hiding out in the forest. he probably ran away to escape your scolding tongue.}
<A>__{the soldiers join in his laughter. incensed, fanny pounds her fist on his legs. gisborne kicks her down.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{norman swine!}
<A>__{a boy of 12 springs from nowhere, thrusting a hay fork at gisborne's throat.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{no, wulf! don't! 'twill only make it worse.}
<A>__{wulf backs off. nostrils flaring with repressed hate.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{seize him!}
<A>__{while two soldiers grab the boy, others examine his hiding place. a secret thatched door, built into the side of a haystack... a bow and quiver... and a deer carcass. gisborne dismounts.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{this is lord nottingham's deer. is this how you repay the sheriff for his protection?}
<C>__{wulf }
<D>__{like a wolf protects sheep.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{i killed it. we needed the meat.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{poachers hang. either he dies or you die.}
<C>__{wulf}
<D>__{my mother lies to protect me.}
<C>__{fanny}
<D>__{no, wulf!}
<A>__{gisborne drags the boy to the carcass.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{you have deprived us of a hunt, boy.}
<A>__{he cups his hand in the deer's blood. smears it on wulf's face.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{the hounds know the scent well.}
<A>__{he tosses his bloody glove to the dogs. they tear at each other in their effort to rip at the glove.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{run, boy. like a deer. give us some pleasure before you die.}
<A>__{to the accompaniment of the hounds' savage howls and the horrified screams of his family, wulf runs.}

<L>__{exterior country road dusk}
<A>__{nearing home, robin is buoyant. the saracen, brooding, walks two paces behind him.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{why must you walk in back of me?}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{in your land am i not the infidel? the unbeliever, the instrument of evil?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{our races have fought for a hundred years to prove that pointerior}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{then i trust it is safer to appear as your slave than as your equal.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{for an 'infidel' you have uncommon clarity of thinking. yet you refuse to tell me about your home and family.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{those are my burdens.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{you speak my language. you have the diplomacy and honor code of a nobleman. i ask again, why were you to be executed?}
<A>__{the saracen maintains a moody silence.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{so, i must continue with my guesswork. you are highborn? probably... you fell from favor... clearly... why? you broke the law? you were a rival for power? ... a woman?}
<A>__{the saracen reacts, almost imperceptibly.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{by the lord, that's it!}
<A>__{aslan is silent, but robin knows he's right.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{they say there are arab women of such beauty that they can possess a man's mind, that he would be willing to die for them. is that not so?}
<A>__{ignoring him, the saracen stops. examines the darkening sky.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{it is close to sunset.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{your people must marry women chosen for them by others, right?}
<A>__{no reply. aslan unfolds a prayer rug.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{who is she? the mullah's daughter? ... another man's wife?... that's it!}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{endless clouds. is there no sun in your cursed country?}

<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{which way is east?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{that way.}
<A>__{aslan throws his rug on the ground. kneels.}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{are you sure?}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{i would know blindfolded. i'm five miles from home... was she worth it?}
<C>__{aslan}
<D>__{worth dying for.}
<A>__{robin stands smiling over him as aslan begins his prayers... baying of hunting dogs... in the distance, the boy wulf runs toward them, ducks behind a tree and clubs the leading dog with a branch. the other hounds close in... panting with exhaustion, wulf swings into the branches. a hound savages his leg. the soldiers surround the tree. the boy clambers precariously onto the highest branch... robin surrep titiously steals a crossbow from one of the soldiers' horses.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{you're not playing by the rules, boy. deer don't climb trees... perhaps he thinks he's a game bird. shall we teach him to fly? cut it down!}
<A>__{the soldiers hack at the trunk. the tree quivers.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{hold!... i am curious as to what manner of creature is so fearsome that it takes six men to attack it.}
<A>__{shrouded in his pilgrim's hooded cloak, he approaches them.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{stand back, stranger. this is no affair of yours.}
<C>__{robin}
<D>__{have we treed the devil himself? let me see... ah ha! a small boy. a truly dangerous animal.}
<C>__{gisborne}
<D>__{i advise you to move on, pilgrim. this is the sheriff's land.}
<C>__{robin}

<D>__{i hope there's enough of me to satisfy you all.}

<C>__{robin}
<D>__{aslan!!}
