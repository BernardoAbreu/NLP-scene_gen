<A>__{terry is watching tv on the sofa with his feet up on the coffee table. sammy comes down the stairs and into the living room. he keeps watching tv. she doesn't sit. she is trembling.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{could you turn that off for a minute please?}

<A>__{terry looks at her.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{what do you mean?}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{i mean i don't think you should live here anymore. i don't think you know how to behave around an eight year old and i don't know how to make you stop, so i think you shouldn't live here. i don't know what else to say.}
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i don't know how to behave around an eight year old?}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{that's right }
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{i think you don't know how to behave around an eight year old.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{are you out of your mind!?!}
<A>__{silence.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{now you just listen to me. i may not be the greatest mother in the world, but i'm doing the best i know how. and he doesn't need you to rub his face in shit because you think it's good for him. he's going to find out the world is a horrible place and that people suck soon enough, and without any help from you. believe me!}
<A>__{sammy tries to get ahold of herself. her voice is shaking.}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{i think you should get your own place. i thought, if you want, you could i will be glad to help you out financially }
<C>__{terry}
<D>__{what do you mean, get my own place?}
<C>__{sammy}
<D>__{i mean i }

<C>__{terry}
<D>__{why would i do that? why don't i just leave, period?}
<C>__{sammy}
<P>__{(quietly)}
<D>__{well... if that's what you want to do, that's fine. but that's not what i'm saying. you are a very important person to rudy, and you are the most important person to me. but i'm saying that i can't take any more of this }
<C>__{terry}
