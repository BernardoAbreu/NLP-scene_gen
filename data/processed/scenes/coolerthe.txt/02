<A>__{cruising the strip, taking in modern day las vegas. sin city gone theme park. gigantic behemoths of pulsating neon: the mgm grand... excalibur... luxor... treasure island... passing revamped faithfuls like caesars and the desert inn... ...then heading downtown to fremont street, where "old school" vegas makes its last stand. binion's horseshoe, the four queens, the las vegas club arid... the shangri la hotel and casino one thing's for sure. this place ain't no bastard child of epcott center. at least, not yet. sure there's some flash going on, but it's more class than overkill. this is where the pro's come to savor a time forgotten. a joint where every dealer knows your name. where part of the allure is the smell of moldy paneling and the tactile whisper of worn felt. where "funny business" doesn't just get you blacklisted... it gets you dead. lets us enter.}
