<L>__{interior cheerless room day}
<A>__{the room is bare, dusty. a ceiling fan turns. the wall clock ticks. craig, 30 years old and small, sits at a collapsible card table. the only item on the table is a book. craig picks it up, looks at the jacket. it's entitled "sit." craig opens the book. it reads: "sit sit sit sit sit..." over and over, page after page. craig closes the book. he begins to stand, but thinks better of it, sighs. he looks at the book again. it is now entitled "die." he opens it up. "die die die die die..." a rooster crows.}
