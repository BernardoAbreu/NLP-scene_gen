<T>__{cut to:}
<L>__{interior room}
<A>__{pan across the virgin mary and many lit candles to a beautiful damsel sharing a love seat with the third musketeer, the dashing aramis. aramis has a book open and is reading from it. the damsel suddenly grabs aramis and kisses him on the mouth. aramis politely extricates himself. he's not the least bit embarrassed, only slightly amused.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{madam, i'm flattered but i thought you wanted me to tutor you in theology.}
<C>__{damsel}
<D>__{excuse me, monsieur aramis. but when you started talking about original sin, i lost control and became impassioned. it won't happen again.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{there's nothing unholy about expressing one's emotions. on the contrary. religion should be experienced in a passionate, all embracing way. we should feel free to express our spirituality.}
<C>__{damsel}
<D>__{yes, darling!}
<A>__{the damsel attacks him again. suddenly, a pounding on the door.}
<C>__{man }
<D>__{open up!}
<C>__{damsel}
<P>__{(a gasp of fear)}
<D>__{my husband!}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{your husband!?}
<C>__{damsel}
<D>__{aramis run!}
<A>__{but aramis' heart is too noble. he gets down on his knees.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{first we must pray to god for forgiveness.}
<A>__{that's when the door bursts open and the lady's husband, an irate marquis enters with a pistol. his eyes blaze with madness. he aims the pistol at aramis' head.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{on second thought, god's often busy.}
<A>__{aramis leaps to his feet and sprints for the open window. as the marquis aims and fires, aramis puts one foot on the ledge and leaps into space. the shot misses him by inches.}
<B>__{street below}
<A>__{as d'artagnan runs past. aramis lands on top of him and they go crashing to the cobblestones. as they untangle themselves and get up...}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{thanks. you broke my fall perfectly. but i do apologize for the inconvenience...}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<P>__{(angry)}
<D>__{get off me!}
<A>__{d'artagnan pushes aramis aside. aramis grabs d'artagnan by the scruff of his neck and pulls him back.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{if there's one thing i can't abide, it's rudeness.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{you fell on me!}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{and i apologized for it.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{i suppose you'd like to teach me a lesson in manners, too.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{i'd be honored.}
<A>__{d'artagnan brightens. another duel!}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{how's two o'clock behind the luxembourg?}
<A>__{aramis bows politely.}
<C>__{aramis}
<D>__{if that's where you wish to die, i won't disappoint you. until then...}
<A>__{aramis takes off. d'artagnan swells with pride.}
<C>__{d'artagnan}
<D>__{three duels in one day. i love this town.}
