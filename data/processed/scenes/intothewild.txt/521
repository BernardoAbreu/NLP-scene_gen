<A>__{become trapped in the wild no game in sight. a subtle drum (heart)beat begins over: chris plops himself down into the middle of the bus. he shakes his head as if trying to say something, and then considers his rifle and abundant ammunition. but taking his own life to avoid the agony of starvation is not an option for him. "no, no, no, don't do this to me." the frustration builds enough adrenaline in him to scream out. he does, but with a low, gurgled animal sound. he shakes it off and looks to his copy of doctor zhivago for distraction. thumbing through the pages he focuses his eyes on the page angle: the page: what he reads:}
<D>__{chris (v.0)(o.c.) and that an unshared happiness is not happiness...}
<A>__{chris steals his pencil from within the pages of the book, scribbling across the page:}
<D>__{chris (v.o.)(o.c.) (cont'd) happiness only real when shared.}

<D>__{chris (v.o.)(o.c.) (cont'd) call everything by its right name.}
<A>__{he tears the back cover off the book and scratching the pencil across its blank side, writing these words quickly, as if in panic:}

<A>__{we move from the page back up to chris. we see that he has put on his eyeglasses to strengthen the vision of his weakening sight. he removes them, folds them, and lays them by his side. his body begins to tremble. his eyes dance wildly. the drumming intensifies. chris takes one last look out the window. the sun is covered by a well defined and puffy cloud. his arm nearing spasm reaches up to the bunk, grasping at the blue sleeping bag made by his mother. with great suffering and shattering trembles, he forces his body to defy its agony and pushes it into the sleeping bag. skyward, the cloud obscuring the sun. drumbeats escalate boom! boom! boom! boom! boom! boom! we tighten on chris' anguished face. (director's note: these cu's on chris' face, combine both static and hand held cus, upside down and right side up moving, zooms, and push ins. straight, side, and dutch angles. perhaps some intermittent distortion.)}
