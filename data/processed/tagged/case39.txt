<L>__{interior sheridan house day}
<A>__{it's dark, the curtains drawn. margaret twitches one open in begrudging courtesy. the house is tidy but sad, steeped in a kind of puritanical gloom. lucy peers down through the upstairs banister, anxious, unsure what's going on. emily sees her, smiles.}

<C>__{emily}
<D>__{when do you expect your husband back?}
<A>__{margaret shrugs.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{because we've found it's more beneficial if the whole family participates.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{well he's not home so...}
<A>__{shrugs again.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{do you have any way of contacting him?}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{not if i don't know where he is.}
<A>__{just then we hear a power tool go on in the basement. emily, sensing the lie, indicates the floor.}

<C>__{emily}
<D>__{would you ask him to join us?}

<D>__{he doesn't have anything to say.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{would you ask him?}

<C>__{emily}
<D>__{it'll be okay.}
<A>__{lucy not so sure. the footsteps are upon them. edward sheridan makes his entrance. a menacing man with a gaunt face and dark deep set eyes. emily holds out her hand.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{hi, i'm emily }
<A>__{edward forgoes the handshake, his contempt obvious. sits beside lucy on the sofa. margaret sits on the other side. lucy tenses, trapped between them. emily speaks with kindness and composure. hostile encounters part of the job.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{i'm here today because lucy's school is concerned about changes they're seeing in her academic performance. the kinds of changes they're seeing are often associated with family problems.}
<A>__{edward leans over and whispers something caustic in margaret's ear.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{eddie says we don't have family problems.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{that's just it, many times a family won't even know they're having problems until it's too late. that's where we come in. we help families communicate and learn healthier ways of resolving conflict.}

<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{eddie says we don't need your help.}
<C>__{emily}

<A>__{margaret nods, gives edward a look as though for permission.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{eddie doesn't like speakin' out of anger.}
<A>__{emily does well to hide her fear. refusing to be intimidated, she engages edward's stare. a battle of wills. but his gaze has a murderous intensity she can't match. she looks down, shuffling papers. battle lost.}

<D>__{wayne, this girl's in trouble. i can feel it.}
<A>__{beneath wayne's humor, a sober, hard learned practicality.}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{wanna know what i can feel? the lawsuit we're gonna get hit with if we violate her parents' rights without any evidence they've done something wrong.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{every time i talk to you you sound more like a lawyer, you know that?}
<C>__{wayne}
<D>__{yeah, well, maybe because every time i make an emotional decision i get called by one. i'm sorry, you're gonna have to let this one go.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{you put these files in front of me and you ask me to tell you what's going on. well, i'm telling you, there's something going on and it's not something good. i've done my job, i've told you, what you do with it is yours.}

<C>__{emily}
<P>__{(hostile)}
<D>__{tell me, mr sheridan, since you've suddenly acquired the power of speech, doesn't it concern you a little that lucy's grades have gone from a's to d's in three months?}

<D>__{course it does, she's our daughter.}
<A>__{with a glance wayne cautions emily about her tone of voice.}

<P>__{(hurt)}
<D>__{that's a little unfair, don't you think? i care about these kids as much as you do, but we can't go around yanking them out of their homes on a hunch. parents, even bad ones, have rights, that's how the laws of this great land are written.}

<A>__{battle scarred. vicious. the dogs from diego's house. they sit down right in front of barron's car. it's a surreal moment, a trio of attack dogs sitting at quiet attention, square jawwed, black eyed, the kinetic calm before a predator strikes. barron draws his gun. fires a warning shot over their heads. bang! deafeningly loud, it echoes through the garage like a thunderclap. but the dogs don't move, just sit there staring. barron lowers his gun. it's time to get the hell out of here. he backpedals, making no sudden movements, gun still trained on the dogs. they watch him, eyes livening with excitement, one of their back legs twitching in anticipation. barron quickens his step and that's their cue. all at once, with explosive speed, the dogs spring into motion, vicious and muscled and smelling blood. barron fires an errant shot and takes off running. but he can't match their pace, the deadly trio race along the row of police cruisers, closing the gap with ease. at the last second barron jumps the partition. the pit bulls crash skull first into the concrete, but continue their pursuit unfazed as barron takes off up the adjoining ramp. he jumps up onto the row of cars and runs across the hoods, denting the metal. the dogs jump up behind him, relentless in their pursuit. jaws snapping at his heels, barron takes to the car roofs, the pitbulls leaping from car to car behind him. he looks back just in time to see the dogs launch themselves. they hit him at chest height, sinking teeth in his flesh. stumbling forward, struggling to keep their jaws from his throat, barron doesn't see what's coming. the last car. the edge of the parking garage. he's over the edge before he even understands, flailing his arms for a handhold that doesn't exist. the ground, far below, flies up at him in a rush of acceleration. we hear a sickening thud and find barron lying face down on the pavement below, blood pooling around him. clinging to life, he opens his eyes and sees the trio of pit bulls sitting obediently beside him, unharmed, watching. but from a distance we see there is only barron. dying alone between the parked cars. no dogs anywhere in sight.}
