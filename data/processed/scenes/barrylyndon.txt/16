<L>__{exterior dugan manor house day}
<A>__{as roderick passes the courtyard, he sees the captain's saddle still hanging up at the stable door, and his odious red coated brute of a servant, swaggering with the scullion girls and kitchen people.}
<C>__{maid}
<D>__{the englishman's still there, master roderick. he's there in the parlor. go in, and don't let 'im browbeat you, master roderick.}
<L>__{interior dugan manor house dining room day}
<A>__{roderick enters and takes his place at the bottom of the big table; the butler speedily brings him a cover.}
<C>__{uncle}
<D>__{hello, roddy, my boy! up and well? that's right.}
<C>__{aunt}
<D>__{he'd better be home with his mother.}
<C>__{uncle}
<D>__{don't mind her. it's the cold goose she ate for breakfast didn't agree with her. take a glass of spirits, mrs. dugan, to roderick's health.}
<A>__{it is evident that his uncle doesn't know of what happened, but michael, who is at dinner too, and harry, and almost all the girls, look exceedingly black and the captain foolish; and miss dorothy, who is again by his side, ready to cry. captain grogan sits smiling, and roderick looks on as cold as stone. his uncle is in high good humor.}
<C>__{uncle}
<D>__{dorothy, divide that merry thought with the captain! see who'll be married first. jack best, my dear boy, never mind a clean glass for the claret, we're short of crystal at castle dugan; take dorothy's and the wine will taste none the worse. mrs. dugan and ladies, if you please; this is a sort of toast that is drunk a great deal too seldom in my family, and you'll please to receive it with all the honors. here's to captain and mrs. john best, and long life to them. kiss her, jack, you rogue; for faith, you've got a treasure.}
<C>__{roderick}
<P>__{(spring up)}
<D>__{his already?!}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{hold your tongue, you fool hold your tongue!}
<C>__{roderick}
<P>__{(shouting)}
<D>__{he has already been slapped in the face this morning, captain john best; he's already been called a coward, captain john best; and this is the way i will drink his health. here's your health, captain john best.}
<A>__{roderick flings a glass of claret into his face. the next moment, he is under the table, tripped up by harry, who hits him a violent cuff on the head; as he goes down, he hardly has time to hear the general screaming and scurrying that is taking place above him, being so fully occupied with kicks, and thumps and curses, with which harry is belaboring him.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you fool! you great blundering marplot you silly beggarly brat }
<P>__{(a thump at each)}
<D>__{hold your tongue!}
<A>__{when roderick gets up from under the table, the ladies are all gone; but he has the satisfaction of seeing the captain's nose is bleeding, as his is best is cut across the bridge, and his beauty spoiled forever.}
<C>__{uncle}
<D>__{in heaven's name, what does all the row mean? is the boy in fever again?}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(turning to his father)}
<D>__{the fact is, sir, that the young monkey has fallen in love with dorothy, and finding her and the captain mighty sweet in the garden today, he was for murdering jack best.}
<C>__{captain best}
<P>__{(bristling up)}
<D>__{and, i will tell you what, mr. dugan, i've been insulted grossly in this house. i ain't at all satisfied with these here ways of going on. i'm an englishman, i am, and a man of property; and i i }
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{if you're insulted, and not satisfied, remember there's two of us, best.}
<A>__{on which, the captain falls to washing his nose in water, and answering never a word.}
<C>__{roderick}
<P>__{(in dignified tone)}
<D>__{mr. best may also have satisfaction any time he pleases, by calling on roderick james, esquire, of jamesville.}
<A>__{his uncle bursts out laughing, and in this laugh, captain grogan joins.}
<C>__{roderick}
<D>__{captain grogan, i beg you to understand that, for my cousin harry, who has been my best friend through life, i could put up with rough treatment from him; yet, even that sort of treatment i will bear from him no longer; and any other person who ventures on the like will not like the cost. mr. best knows that fact very well; and, if he's man, he'll know where to find me.}
<C>__{uncle}
<D>__{it is getting late, and your mother will be anxious about you. one of you had better go home with him.}
<P>__{(turning to his sons)}
<D>__{or the lad may be playing more pranks.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{both of us ride home with best here.}
<C>__{captain best}
<D>__{i'm not afraid of highwaymen. my man is armed, and so am i.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{you know the use of arms very well, best, and no one can doubt your courage; but michael and i will see you home for all that.}
<C>__{uncle}
<D>__{why, you'll not be home till morning, boys. kilwangan's a good ten miles from here.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{we'll sleep in best's quarters. we're going to stop a week there. and, in another week, my boy.}
<A>__{and here, harry whispers something in the captain's ear.}
<C>__{captain grogan}
<D>__{i will go home with the boy.}
