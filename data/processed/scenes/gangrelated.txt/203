<L>__{interior county jail cell day}
<A>__{cynthia is alone in her cell. we hear footsteps. she looks up as the guard approaches.}
<C>__{guard}
<D>__{your attorney's here.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{what attorney?}
<L>__{interior room county jail day}
<A>__{cynthia enters the office. the guard shuts the door. cynthia finds herself facing arthur baylor. a tape recorder on the table in front of him.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{hi, cynthia. please sit down.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{i got nothin' to say.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{so i'm told.}
<A>__{arthur pushes the tape recorder and we hear }
<C>__{divinci's voice}
<D>__{...take off your shirt...}
<C>__{rodriguez's voice}
<D>__{fuck you, you don't trust me.}
<C>__{divinci's voice}
<D>__{i'm askin' you one more time.}
<C>__{rodriguez's voice}
<D>__{you wanna shoot me? shoot me.}
<C>__{divinci's voice}
<D>__{okay, i'm sorry. you're right. i'm fuckin' nervous. like you. forget it. this thing... shit. let's just get it over with. i will just feel a whole lot better when she's dead. then we're off the hook.}
<A>__{arthur watches cynthia's reaction to "when she's dead." but cynthia has seen enough not to be too shocked by anything. and her reaction is subtle. she knows better than to reveal what she's really feeling and thinking.}
<C>__{rodriguez's voice}
<D>__{right.}
<C>__{divinci's voice}
<D>__{you fuckin' rat!}
<C>__{rodriguez's voice}
<D>__{yeah... yeah... i am, i'm a fuckin' rat... i traded you, frank, i fuckin' traded you... simms knows everything. just fuckin' shoot me, get it the fuck over with! i deserve it! i fucking deserve to die!}
<C>__{divinci's voice}
<D>__{you're fuckin' right.}
<A>__{the recording ends. arthur shuts off the machine.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{i think you know my client is innocent. that's all i care about, my client. but i understand why you're scared. you're already facing perjury charges. my guess is, your involvement is deeper than that. but i don't really care, i'm not after you... i get nothing if you go to jail. but i think if i help you, i can help my client.}
<C>__{cynthia}
<D>__{...how?}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{william joe didn't do it, did he?}
<A>__{cynthia hesitates, then shakes her head.}
<C>__{arthur}
<D>__{why don't you sit down.}
<A>__{a beat, then cynthia pulls up a chair.}
