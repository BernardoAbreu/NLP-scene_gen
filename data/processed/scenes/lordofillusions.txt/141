<L>__{interior swann's mansion casket room night}
<A>__{the fire follows him across the ground and strikes his hand. harry drops the gun. looks up to see the stranger in the doorway, arm raised to will the fire serpent on. but then, he hesitates. harry glances round, and sees that the stranger whose face is still a dark smear is staring at the casket.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{somebody you know?}
<A>__{dorothea appears behind the stranger. sees harry, burned and sweating, cornered against the casket.}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{oh my god!}
<A>__{the stranger looks round. harry snatches up the gun, supporting his burned hand with his good hand. levels the gun at the stranger. the fire raises its head, like a cobra.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{which goes first? my face or your heart?}
<A>__{the stranger draws a deep breath. the fire serpent withers and dies.}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{who in god's name are you?}
<A>__{she reaches for the stranger, who simply folds up again; gone into darkness. the wind blows through the house, masking his exit.}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{are you all right?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{find valentin! find him! get him in here!}
<A>__{dorothea disappears. harry takes one of the candle holders and jams it under the casket lid. wood splinters. he starts to force off the lid. valentin and dorothea enter.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{what are you doing? this is sacrilege.}
<A>__{he starts towards harry. dorothea goes after him and catches hold of his arm. her expression is a mingling of fascination and dread, as harry gets his fingers under the casket lid and pulls. inside, swann's corpse.}
<C>__{valentin}
<D>__{are you satisfied now?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{no.}
<A>__{harry holds valentin back with one hand, and puts his finger into the corpse's mouth.}
<C>__{dorothea}
<D>__{harry?}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{it's all right. it's not hurting...}
<A>__{he now has four fingers in swann's mouth and seizes hold of his lower jaw. it cracks and comes away in a little rain of plaster and latex.}
<C>__{harry}
<D>__{...plaster doesn't bleed.}
<A>__{he tosses the jaw to valentin.}
<C>__{harry}
<P>__{(to dorothea)}
<D>__{it looks like you're not a widow after all.}
