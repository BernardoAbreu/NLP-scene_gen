<A>__{on the edge of the perimeter, king puts out his claymore, unraveling it back towards his foxhole, intersecting men form the third platoon, who file out on a night ambush, skirting the trip wires, demoralized, silent. eye exchanges, but no words. chris sits on the foxhole watching the ambush go out, smoking a joint by himself, depressed. king comes in with the claymore wires, attaching them to their detonators. their foxhole as are all of the platoon's is positioned just inside the treeline bordering the lz, so that they are quite isolated from the center of the perimeter where they first landed.}
