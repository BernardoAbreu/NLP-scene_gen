<D>__{the things you gotta remember are the details. it's the details that sell your story. now this story takes place in this men's room. so you gotta know the details about this men's room. you gotta know they got a blower instead of a towel to dry your hands. you gotta know the stalls ain't got no doors. you gotta know whether they got liquid or powdered soap, whether they got hot water or not, 'cause if you do your job when you tell your story, everybody should believe it. and if you tell your story to somebody who's actually taken a piss in this men's room, and you get one detail they remember right, they'll swear by you.}
