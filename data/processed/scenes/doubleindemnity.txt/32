<A>__{neff comes out at the top of the ramp and starts to walk down the street, not too fast. camera precedes him. he walks about ten or fifteen yards. at first his steps sound hard and distinct on the sidewalk and echo in the deserted street. but slowly, as he goes on, they fade into utter silence. he walks a few feet without sound, then becomes aware of the silence. he stops rigidly and looks back. camera stops with him. he stands like that for a moment, then turns toward the camera again. there is a look of horror on his face now. he walks on, camera ahead of him again. still his steps make no sound.}
