<L>__{interior palladium main lobby continuous}
<A>__{as eli sits at the bar, a shadow comes into view and looms large over him. hog is standing behind him, glaring, cutting a menacing figure in his armored cycle leathers. solara senses trouble brewing and moves off, taking eli's canteen away into the back room.}
<C>__{hog}
<D>__{that was my cat.}
<A>__{eli doesn't turn. just looks straight ahead. impossible to read him behind those mirrored goggles. utterly inscrutable.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{fine specimen.}
<C>__{hog}
<D>__{i saw you push him off the bar.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i didn't push him.}
<C>__{hog}
<D>__{you raised your hand at him.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{sorry. it won't happen again.}
<A>__{the bartender looks at hog nervously.}
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{hey, how about another drink, hog?}
<C>__{hog}
<D>__{that cat's been comin' in here for nigh on two years. it got more right to be here than you. who the fuck do you think you are?}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i don't want any trouble.}
<A>__{hog grabs him by the arm.}
<C>__{hog}
<D>__{well, that's too bad, `cause }
<A>__{blink. suddenly hog's head is pinned to the bar by nothing more than eli's thumb. pressed deep into a nerve cluster in his neck. eli leans in close as hog whimpers, paralyzed.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{i know you. murderer of innocent travelers on the road. you're going to spend eternity drowning in a lake of fire for the things that you've done. did you know that?}
<A>__{the other bikers stand and approach, the other customers following suit. eli senses the trouble gathering behind him.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{you go on back to your table and i will be on my way. all right?}
<A>__{it's all hog can do to just barely nod his head. eli releases his thumb. hog staggers backward, gasping for breath. eli stands and makes toward the door, but the bikers and other patrons have moved to block his exit.}
<C>__{burly patron}
<D>__{you push hog, you push all of us.}
<A>__{eli sighs, looks down at the floor. he's been pushed one time too many today. for the first time, we see anger in his face.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{cursed be the ground because of you. by toil shall you eat of it. thorns and thistles shall it sprout for you. from the ground were you taken. for dust you are.}
<A>__{the patrons look at eli strangely. who is this guy? eli reaches back and draws the samurai sword. carves a line in the dirt at his feet with the tip of the blade.}
<C>__{eli}
<D>__{and to dust you shall return.}
