<A>__{slide guitar plays. a tuft of raw cotton bobs on the stem and we begin to scroll opening credits we tilt and rack to look over a field of cotton, the bolls plumped out and ready for picking, blowing in the breeze. a harvest hand steps into the shot, looks toward the setting sun, wipes his face with a bandanna then stoops to pick the row in front of him. we pull back to see other pickers, men and women in denim coveralls, old gingham dresses and hard work shoes, wearing straw hats against the sun and trailing long white sacks between their legs and behind them. the boys walk down between them in the opposite direction }
