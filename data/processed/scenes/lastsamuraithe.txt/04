<D>__{"we are dead," they whisper, "and we are happy."}
<L>__{interior seedy hotel room night}
<A>__{algren is back in the hotel room. from his small suitcase, he takes the medal of honor, looks at it for a long moment.}
<C>__{algren }
<D>__{"do not be afraid," they whisper. "you have been dead, too."}
<A>__{a sudden flash: we are back on sutter's hill. algren's slaughtered cavalry litter the bloody ground, dead to the last man. a rebel army surgeon gives a cursory look at each body before it is loaded onto a wagon. algren's turn is no different than the others. he is declared dead and hoisted unceremoniously onto the pile of corpses. back in the. hotel room.: algren sits, staring into the middle distance.}
<C>__{algren }
<D>__{is this why they gave their lives? so that i might disgrace their memory?}
<A>__{he reaches into the suitcase and takes out a colt revol ver. stares at it, cracks the cylinder to make sure it's loaded. his finger wraps around the trigger, the barrel makes its wa y toward his head. and then, unaccountabl y, he is laughing.}
<C>__{algren }
<D>__{and why, after taking so many lives, do i find myself incapable of taking just one more?}
<A>__{a knock on the door. algren shuts his eyes, then calls out.}
<C>__{algren}
<D>__{go awa y.}
<C>__{gant }
