<A>__{the house is distant below. felix and his family are heading out across the fields now sparse with snow, herding the cow before them. only grandfather is missing. the gentle music of the recorder drifts up from the house. angle widens to reveal the creature hunkered on a hill. watching. waiting. the family dwindles in the distance.}
<L>__{int house day}
<A>__{for the first time, we actually see the inside of the house from a perspective other than through the chink in the wall. grandfather is by the fire, playing his recorder. the creature's face appears at a window. peering in. he ducks from view, appearing at another window. making sure the house is otherwise empty. he vanishes again. the door swings silently open. his figure fills the doorway. grandfather stops playing. silence.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{would you like to sit by the fire?}
<A>__{the creature enters. sits. holds his hands toward the embers, feeling the warmth.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{nice.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{the music? or the fire?}
<A>__{grandfather offers him the recorder. the creature hesitates, takes it, inept where such delicacy is required. he puts it to his misshapen lips and blows a few hollow tones. he gives it back, huffing air, delighted.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{i'm glad you finally came to the door. a man shouldn't have to scurry in the shadows.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{better that way... for me.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{why?}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{i'm... very, very ugly. people are afraid. except you.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<P>__{(smiles)}
<D>__{it can't be as bad as that.}
<C>__{creature}
<P>__{(soft)}
<D>__{worse.}
<A>__{the old man reaches for his face. the creature draws back.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{i can see you with my hands. if you'll trust me.}
<A>__{the creature decides to trust. he eases forward. grandfather runs his fingers over his features. gently:}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{you're an outcast.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{yes. i have been seeking my friends.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{friends? do they live around here?}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{yes. very close}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{why do you not go to them?}
<A>__{the creature pauses. emotions swirling. afraid to continue.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{i have been... afraid. afraid... they will hate me... because i am so very ugly... and they are so very beautiful}
<C>__{grandfather}
<P>__{(softly)}
<D>__{people can be kinder than you think.}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{i am afraid.}
<A>__{grandfather reaches out and takes the creature's hands.}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{perhaps i can help. tell me who.}
<A>__{the creature is huffing air, breath hitching in his chest like a panicking child. his monstrous eyes well up with tears. trying to get the words out:}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{i love them... so very much. i want... i want... them to be my ff family. i ii ilove them ss so very mm mm mmuch...}
<A>__{the creature pauses. trying to get the words out. and the door swings open. the creature whips his head. there stands maggie. eyes going wide. breath catching in her throat. she lets out an ear splitting shriek! the creature throws himself on the old man's lap, clutching him, pleading:}
<C>__{creature}
<D>__{don't let them hate me!}
<A>__{felix bursts in, shoving maggie aside, hell breaking loose in screaming, hollering chaos: marie trying to get the children out of the way, felix throwing himself on the creature to rip him off the old man, the creature sprawling to the floor, the old man shouting, the children shrieking, felix snatching, up the fireplace poker and swinging it down, again and again, trying to kill the thing...}
<C>__{grandfather}
<D>__{leave him alone!}
<A>__{...the creature screaming and taking the blows, writhing across the floor in agony, the children scattering from his pleading hands. the creature rolls from under the brutal beating and sails out the door.}
