<L>__{int ext cruiser continuing action}
<A>__{tim's cruiser is lying on its side, stuck in the higher branches of a tree on the hillside.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{oh shit!}
<A>__{timmy pulls his body up carefully, trying to get a better view. he grabs the steering wheel for support and it spins free in his hand. crack! the cruiser slips a few inches down the tree. timmy grabs the window frame and freezes. the car sways in the wind. crack! the car slips a quick and rocky two feet.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit!}
<A>__{timmy hears something. he raises his head very carefully. climbing up the tree, pulling himself on a nearby branch, is dr. grant.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{timmy. are you ok?}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{thank god you're here. where's lex?}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{below. she's fine. let's get you down.}
<A>__{timmy nods. grant peers throug h the broken roof of the cruiser, analyzing timmy's predicament. he cranes his head back to examine how the cruiser is supported in the tree. grant turns back to timmy.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{try the door you're leaning against. nice and slow.}
<A>__{timmy places his weight on the two sides of the door frame and reaches between his legs, trying to open the door handle. stuck. crack! the cruiser drops another foot. grant scrambles down a couple branches until he is even with the cruiser again. he motions for timmy to hold still. grant reaches across to the other car door and tries the outer door handle. this one opens and very slowly, he pushes open the door. grant gingerly holds it half open in mid air.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{crawl this way. slowly.}
<A>__{carefully testing his weight with each step, timmy lowers his body down. he pushes his legs out the door. they kick in the air and slowly come to rest on a lower branch. he lets himself down. now he si ts on a branch, a few feet below the cruiser. crack! the cruiser drops. grant still hangs onto the door but now his footing on the branch is gone. his legs hang in space. the cruiser hangs precariously above timmy. they're all twenty feet in the air.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{we're going to have to make a jump for it, timmy. okay?}
<A>__{timmy agrees.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{one, two, three, jump.}
<A>__{timmy lets go and drops. grant follows. so does the cruiser. it's hurtling right at them. timmy bangs against the wet tree trunk and slides down. branches whip against his face, his hands scrape against the trunk. grant bounces them. they scramble down as quick as they can. timmy pulls his hands along the sap sticky surface of the tree. crack! grant is stopped for a terrible instant doubled over a branch, he flips himself over, dropping further. the cruiser jolts along, just a half step behind them. timmy dives the last six feet and hits the wet earth with a thud! grant crashes next to him. before they can roll out of the way, the cruiser keeps coming. grant and timmy look up at it. grant's pov the cruiser dropping, dropping toward them. and finally stops, just inches away, its dented grill grinning at them, its cracked headlight glaring. oil drips down on grant. he grabs timmy, who grabs the night goggles. the two roll away. that second the cruiser smashes to the ground. grant brushes himself off painfully, extends a hand to timmy. timmy slowly reaches up and pulls himself standing.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{thanks, dr. grant.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{you owe me one.}
<A>__{grant turns around in a slow, fluid circle, checking out the forest.}
<C>__{grant}
<D>__{where'd lex go?}
<A>__{they hear a faint whimpering.}
<C>__{timmy}
<D>__{there's lex.}
<A>__{he runs. grant follows.}
