<D>__{well, wasn't bigfoot kiddo.}
<A>__{jamie scans the horizon for the culprit. his eyes land on a couple kids making snow barricades. monty (oddball with big glasses) with his back turned suddenly gets a snowball to the back of the head, knocking him face first into the ground.}
<C>__{monty}
<D>__{ow!}
<A>__{pippa (brainy, pigtails, pink hat) steps forward and boof! a magical snowball from jack hits her, knocking her back. pippa's face changes a mischievous sparkle.}

<C>__{jack}
<D>__{free for all!}

<D>__{alright, who needs ammo?}
<A>__{jack supplies the kids with more snowballs. the kids are loving this.}
<C>__{jack}
<P>__{(walla)}
<D>__{look at that.}
<A>__{the mayhem continues as jamie, using his sled as a shield, is knocked backward into a snowman, crushing it underneath him. a snowball flies overhead and hits cupcake, a tough third grader as wide as she is tall, in the back of the head. dread sets in amongst the other kids, cupcake squints gunslinger eyes.}

<D>__{did you throw that?}
<C>__{monty}
<D>__{no.}

<D>__{wasn't me.}
<A>__{a moment, and then cupcake starts laughing as jack's magic takes hold. cupcake chases the kids down the hill, holding the head of her snowman in her hands. jack, all the while, runs along side taking pleasure in the excitement.}

<D>__{ooh, little slippery!}

<D>__{jamie! turn, turn! that's the street! what are you doing? stop! there's traffic!}
<A>__{jamie suddenly shoots out between the trees and careens past a set of parked cars. jack's path of ice covers the street. as jamie turns, his speed only escalates, sending him directly into traffic. jamie barely misses a moving truck, spinning it out of control, sending furniture out the back, and causing a four car pile up.}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{whoa!}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{whoa, don't worry kid, i gotcha.}

<P>__{pedestrian #3 (o.s.)}
<D>__{look at that dude!}
<A>__{jamie flies off the sidewalk and back into the middle of the street, almost knocking over a postman. as jack flies by jamie's side he sees the look of excitement come into jamie's face. jack smiles, knowing he's responsible. jack sees an oncoming snowplow and quickly jumps ahead, carried by the wind, to divert the ice trail.}
<C>__{jack}
<D>__{whoa.}
<A>__{jamie's sled suddenly turns, narrowly missing the oncoming truck and barrels toward jack's newly formed ice ramp...}
<C>__{jamie}
<D>__{aaaahhhhhhhh!}
<A>__{jamie closes his eyes as the ramp launches jamie over the street, high into the air, and toward the statue of thaddeus burgess, colonial settler 1680. jamie's friends stand in awe, mouths wide open, as he sails through the air. jamie opens his eyes and the look of fear suddenly turns to joy. jack looks on smiling. jamie lands safely in a large mound of snow. jack jumps onto the statue of thaddeus burgess.}

<D>__{whoops.}
<C>__{kids}
<P>__{(cringing)}
<D>__{ooooh!}
<A>__{there's a moment of silence as the kids wait to see if jamie is okay. then, jamie rises up from behind the sofa grinning, a new gap in his smile. he holds up a tooth.}
