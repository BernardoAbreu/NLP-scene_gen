<L>__{interior library day}
<A>__{hans stands with the dignitaries and guards.}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{i'm going back out to look for princess anna.}
<C>__{french dignitary}
<D>__{you cannot risk going out there again.}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{if anything happens to her }
<C>__{spanish dignitary}
<D>__{if anything happens to the princess, you are all arendelle has left.}
<A>__{hans hesitates, realizing how much this kingdom has come to depend on him. is he really all they have left? just then the door opens and gerda and kai bring in anna.}
<C>__{kai}
<D>__{he's in here. prince hans.}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{anna.}
<A>__{hans rushes to anna. she falls into his arms.}
<C>__{hans }
<D>__{you're so cold.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(weak, but desperate)}
<D>__{hans, you have to kiss me.}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{now. here we go.}
<A>__{she tries to kiss him, but is too weak to pull herself up in his arms.}
<C>__{gerda}
<D>__{we'll give you two some privacy.}
<A>__{everyone shuffles out, leaving hans and anna alone.}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{what happened out there?}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{elsa struck me with her powers.}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{you said she'd never hurt you.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{i was wrong.}
<A>__{anna crumbles, weak.}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{anna.}
<A>__{hans carries her to a couch, sets her down.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(shivering more)}
<D>__{she froze my heart and only an act of true love can save me.}
<C>__{hans}
<P>__{(understanding)}
<D>__{a true love's kiss.}
<A>__{he takes her chin in his hand and gives her a tender smile. he leans in slowly...gently... then he stops.}
<C>__{hans }
<D>__{oh, anna. if only there was someone out there who loved you.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what?}
<A>__{hans gets up, leaving her there.}
<C>__{anna }
<D>__{...you said you did.}
<A>__{he goes to the window and shuts the curtains.}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{as thirteenth in line in my own kingdom, i didn't stand a chance. i knew i'd have to marry into the throne somewhere }
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{what are you talking about?}
<C>__{hans}
<P>__{(putting out the candles)}
<D>__{as heir, elsa was preferable, of course. but no one was getting anywhere with her. but you }
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{hans?}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{you were so desperate for love you were willing to marry me, just like that.}
<A>__{hans crosses the room, grabs a pitcher of water from a table and goes to the fireplace.}
<C>__{hans }
<D>__{i figured, after we married, i'd have to stage a little accident for elsa.}
<A>__{hans pours the water on the fireplace, putting out the fire. anna tries to stop him. she falls to the floor, weak.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{hans. no, stop.}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{but then she doomed herself, and you were dumb enough to go after her.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{please.}
<C>__{hans}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{all that's left now is to kill elsa and bring back summer.}
<A>__{hans approaches anna.}
<C>__{anna}
<D>__{...you're no match for elsa.}
<A>__{he bends down, takes her chin in his hand again, this time not so gently.}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{no, you're no match for elsa. i, on the other hand, am the hero who is going to save arendelle from destruction.}
<A>__{she wrenches her face out of his hands.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(anger)}
<D>__{you won't get away with this.}
<A>__{hans rises and crosses to the door.}
<C>__{hans}
<D>__{oh, i already have.}
<A>__{hans leaves and shuts her in, locking the door. anna struggles to the door, yanks on the locked handle.}
<C>__{anna}
<P>__{(hoarse and weak)}
<D>__{please, somebody help.}
<A>__{the rest of her hair turns white and she crumbles to the floor.}
