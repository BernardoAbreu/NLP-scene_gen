<A>__{margaret hears the shower stop running.}
<C>__{margaret}
<D>__{shit on toast.}
<A>__{she hangs up, places the gag back in her mouth and hustles back into place.}

<A>__{ted, pulls on his boots and his jacket. in his hand, an address scribbled down on a piece of note paper. tiffany watches, not happy.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{you're sure this is it?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{she specifically mentioned the cock sucking turnout up the highway where the snowmobilers hang out.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i will call later.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{i won't be here.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{excuse me?}
<A>__{the phone rings. tiffany lets it.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{i know relationships aren't all sunshine and roses, but i'm really not having fun anymore, and i don't think you are either.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{god, now's so not the time, tiff.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{maybe you have to be like this right now, and i'm just not in a good space to deal with it. but...}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{but what?}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{maybe we shouldn't be like this together.}
<A>__{tiffany gives him that look every man who's ever crossed the line for the last time is all too familiar with. ted stares. words fail him. finally, his only recourse is to hurry out the door which shuts with a bang. tiffany lets the phone continue to ring as she stares at the door. sadly, she hits the computer key that picks it up.}
<C>__{tiffany }
<D>__{psychic buddies. how are you mr. bennett? i think she'd be fine with you remarrying, but hang on, let me concentrate.}
<A>__{ted opens the door, steps back inside.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{ok. come on.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<P>__{(to ted)}
<D>__{really?}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i've been cutting you out of my life and as a result our normal communication channels have been blocked. i think you coming with me would... would...}
<A>__{he's reaching, but tiffany looks cautiously hopeful.}
<C>__{ted }
<D>__{...further the development of our relationship and allow us to both... realize the potential of our... interpersonalism.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{if you're going to be sarcastic.}
<C>__{ted}
<D>__{i'm not being anything. swear to god.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<D>__{okay. why do you want me to come?}
<C>__{ted}
<P>__{(total sincerity)}
<D>__{cause if you don't, then i will have to stay, and i will be mad at you and eventually we'll break up over it, and as bad as my life is right now, that would make it a million times worse.}
<A>__{tiffany smiles, genuinely touched.}
<C>__{tiffany}
<P>__{(into the phone)}
<D>__{mr. bennett, she's totally cool with it. but listen, you're gonna have to call back... i gotta go help my boyfriend.}
