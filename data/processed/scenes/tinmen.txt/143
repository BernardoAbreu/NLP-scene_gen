<A>__{his office is equally messy and thrown together as everything else in the gibraltar offices. as tilley closes the door, his coffee, which is filled to the top of his cup, spills over the top and starts to burn his hand.}
<C>__{tilley}
<D>__{ah! ah!}
<A>__{he jumps back, and puts his coffee down on a desk, and wipes his hand on the back of his jacket.}
