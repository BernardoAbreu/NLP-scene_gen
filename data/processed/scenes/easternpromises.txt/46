<L>__{interior suburban house. neglected sitting room day}
<D>__{we are in harlesden, north london. a large portable stereo is playing rock music. the curtains are drawn against daylight. the living room is decorated in seventies suburban style, but with the wall paper peeling and the paint work fading. kitsch paintings still decorate the walls. six young east european girls are sitting on a broken down sofa and on hard backed chairs, wearing short skirts. their eyes are sunken and their faces vacant of expression, but they are painted with so much make up they almost look like tiny, sad clowns. they sit in silence as the music blares out. after a few moments a young albanian man enters and claps his hands.}

<D>__{ok, boss is here. boss, boss. you make him happy... all the girls apart from one immediately get to their feet and begin to dance to the music, their bodies moving awkwardly and painfully. the albanian approaches the one girl who refused to stand and yanks her to her feet. he slaps her hard and hisses at her in albanian. she tries to sit down again but he pulls her up and slaps her again. finally he shoves her into the middle of the room and she begins to dance, sobbing as she does.}
