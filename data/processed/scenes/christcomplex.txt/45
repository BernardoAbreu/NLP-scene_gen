<D>__{excuse me? a battle cry?}
<C>__{ryan blood}
<D>__{yes a battle cry. every great warrior has one.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{and a battle cry is going to give me the advantage in battle?}
<C>__{ryan blood}
<D>__{of course it will. why don't you try one out?}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{what?}
<C>__{ryan blood}

<C>__{louis}
<D>__{so right now?}

<D>__{of course.}
<A>__{louis inhales deeply and then lets out a scream. it comes out more like frightened little girl.}
<C>__{ryan blood }
<D>__{oh come on! that sounds like you are scared of the battle. what? are you scared of quinn? you probably are }
<A>__{louis lets out another scream, this one is slightly better.}
<C>__{ryan blood }
<D>__{that's good! come on!}
<A>__{louis lets out another one that actually causes ryan to jump back.}
<C>__{ryan blood }
<D>__{yes that's what i'm talking about!}
<A>__{out of nowhere, quinn walks up to the two of them.}
<C>__{ryan blood }

<C>__{louis}
<P>__{(to ryan)}
<D>__{excuse me for a second.}
<A>__{louis walks with quinn to a spot that gives them some distance away from ryan.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{i know that guy and i don't trust him.}
<C>__{louis}
<D>__{i don't trust you anymore.}
<C>__{quinn}
<D>__{your new friend is dangerous.}
<C>__{louis}
