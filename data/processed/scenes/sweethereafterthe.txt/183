<A>__{mitchell meets nicole. sam and mary are also seated at the table. the meeting takes place in the kitchen diningroom.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{well, nicole, i've been wanting to meet you for a long time now. not just because i've heard so many good things about you, but because, as you know, i'm the guy representing you and your mom and dad and some other folks here in town. we're trying to generate some compensation, however meager, for what you have suffered, and at the same time see that an accident like this never happens again. you're central to the case i'm trying to build, nicole. but you'd probably just as soon let the whole thing lie. just get on with your life as quickly and smoothly as possible.}
<A>__{nicole nods. pause, as mitchell waits for her to go on.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{i don't like thinking about the accident. i don't even remember it happening. besides, it just makes people feel sorry for me, and...}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{you hate that.}
<A>__{nicole nods.}
<C>__{sam}
<D>__{what she means, mitch...}
<A>__{mitchell silences sam with a gesture of his hand.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{people can't help it, you know. they really can't. when they see you in this wheelchair, knowing what your life was life eight months ago, people are going to feel sorry for you. there's no way around it, nicole. you and i just met, and already i admire you. who wouldn't? you're a brave tough smart kid. that's obvious. and i didn't know you, know how exciting and promising your life was before the accident. but listen, even i feel sorry for you.}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{you can only feel lucky that you didn't die for so long. then you start to feel...unlucky.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{that you didn't die? like the other children?}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{yes. like bear and the ansel twins and sean and...}
<C>__{mary}
<D>__{nicole!}
<C>__{nicole}
<D>__{it's the truth.}
<A>__{mitchell regards mary with calm authority, as though he's telling her the time.}
<C>__{mitchell}
<D>__{it is the truth.}
<A>__{pause. mitchell looks back at nicole.}
<C>__{mitchell }
<D>__{it would be strange if you didn't feel that way.}
<C>__{nicole}
<P>__{(after a slight pause)}
<D>__{what do you want me to do for you, mr. stephens?}
