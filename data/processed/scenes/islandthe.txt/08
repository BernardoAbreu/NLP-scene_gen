<A>__{rainbow light and swirling electronic music. the clientele are all male residents. round the walls, poster sized etherscreens display various dancing women, beckoning, text supers flashing: new at the pleasure center!... or try a mystery date!... at the bar, lincoln and jones, freshly showered, each swipe their ethercuffs over a scanner. a uniformed bartender notes the readout }
<C>__{bartender}
<D>__{jones three bravo; you got five units. your friend, he's got an alcohol flag.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{so make it a beer and a vita cola.}
<A>__{the bartender serves the drinks and they settle at the end of the bar. scoping for onlookers, lincoln steals a gulp of jones' beer.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{you know, you're going to get yourself contaminated one of these days.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{shut up, jonesy.}
<C>__{jones}

<D>__{no law against friendship, jonesy.}
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{quick . . . give me that beer back.}
<A>__{two census officers ("censors") enter the bar; in wireless head sets and white uniforms, they seem at once clinical and military. censor 1 carries a tablet known as an "etherboard". censor 2, more imposing, carries a wide muzzle rifle known as a "stopgun". their foreboding appearance is greeted without alarm. as they move up the bar, the customers dutifully swipe their ethercuffs over the etherboard. now reaching jones, who swipes accordingly }
<C>__{jones}
<D>__{what's going on, officer?}
<C>__{censor 1}
<D>__{census check.}
<A>__{censor1 checks the etherboard; a headshot of jones spins in 3 d. he offers it to lincoln who swipes his ethercuff emphatically }
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{what happened? you lost count?}
<C>__{censor 1}
<D>__{i hope nobody's drinking off quota.}
<C>__{lincoln}
<D>__{vita cola all the way, officer.}
<A>__{lincoln sips his cola. as they move on, he grimaces at the taste.}
