<A>__{miller waits. bill waits. jim comes forward with his reply.}
<C>__{jim}

<D>__{now this is significant, because it is standard operating procedure, especially in a known hostile city like dallas, to supplement the secret service. even if we had not allowed the bubbletop to be removed from the limousine, we'd've put at least 100 to 200 agents on the sidewalks, without question! there'd already been several attempts on de gaulle's life in france. only a month before in dallas un ambassador adlai stevenson had been spit on and hit. we'd have arrived days ahead of time, studied the route, checked all the buildings... we never would've allowed all those wide open empty windows overlooking dealey... never... we would have had our own snipers covering the area. the moment a window went up they'd have been on the radio. we would've been watching the crowds packages, rolled up newspapers, a coat over an arm, never would have let a man open an umbrella along the way never would've allowed that limousine to slow down to 10 miles per hour, much less take that unusual curve at houston and elm. you would have felt an army presence in the streets that day, but none of this happened. it was a violation of the most basic protection codes we have. and it is the best indication of a massive plot in dallas. who could have best done that? people in my business, mr. garrison. people like my superior officer could've told col. reich, "look we have another unit coming from so and so providing security. you'll stand down." that day, in fact, there were some individual army intelligence people in dallas and i'm still trying to figure out who and why. but they weren't protecting the client. one of them, by the way, was caught in the book depository after police sealed it off.}

<D>__{army intell had a "harvey lee oswald" on file, but all those files have been destroyed. many strange things were happening that day, and lee harvey oswald had nothing to do with them. we had the entire cabinet on a trip to the far east. we had a third of a combat division returning from germany in the air above the united states at the time of the shooting, and at 12:34 p.m., the entire telephone system went dead in washington for a solid hour, and on the plane back to washington, word was radioed from the white house situation room to lyndon johnson that one individual performed the assassination. does that sound like a bunch of coincidences to you, mr. garrison? not for one moment. the cabinet was out of the country to get their perception out of the way. the troops were in the air for possible riot control. the phones didn't work to keep the wrong stories from spreading if anything went wrong with the plan. nothing was left to chance. i bet you there were even backup teams and cars on the other side of the underpass in the event that kennedy got through wounded. they would have moved in with vehicles like they did with de gaulle. he could not be allowed to escape alive.}
<A>__{the camera is on jim, listening. this information is much greater than he ever envisioned, and he is stunned. x pauses.}
<C>__{x}
<D>__{i never though things were the same after that. vietnam started for real. there was an air of, i don't know, make believe in the pentagon and the cia. those of us who'd been in secret ops since the beginning knew the warren commission was fiction, but there was something... deeper, uglier. and i knew allen dulles very well. i briefed him many a time in his house. he was also general y's benefactor. but for the life of me i still can't figure out why dulles was appointed to investigate kennedy's death. the man who had fired him. i got out in '64. i retired from the u.s. air force.}

<C>__{x}
<P>__{(chuckles)}
<D>__{that's the real question, isn't it "why?" the "how" is just "scenery" for the suckers... oswald, ruby, cuba, mafia, it keeps people guessing like a parlor game, but it prevents them from asking the most important question why? why was kennedy killed? who benefitted? who has the power to cover it up?... you know in '61 right after the bay of pigs very few people know about this i participated in drawing up national security action memos 55, 56, and 57. these are crucial documents, classified top secret, but basically in them kennedy instructs general lemnitzer, chairman of the joint chiefs, that from here on forward...}
<A>__{flashback to the pentagon offices on a day in 1961. a document is moved by hand into lemnitzer's office where we see a set of hands holding it while it's read. there's a look of surprise on lemnitzer's face.}
<C>__{x}
<D>__{... the joint chiefs of staff would be wholly responsible for all covert paramilitary action in peacetime. this basically ended the reign of the cia "splintered it", as j.f.k. promised he would, into a "thousand pieces", and now was ordering the military to help. this was unprecedented. i can't tell you the shock waves this sent along the corridors of power in washington. this and, of course, firing allen dulles, richard bissell, and general charles cabell, all of them sacred cows of intell since world war ii. you got some very upset people here.}

<C>__{x}
<D>__{kennedy's directives were never really implemented, because of bureaucratic resistance, but one of the results was that the cuban operation was turned over to my department as "operation mongoose", which meant that people like my superior officer, general y, took over the cuban personnel that were being trained to invade cuba and the bases like the training camp at pontchartrain in your home state that were closed down by kennedy... and that's how the "black ops" people, people like general y, ended up taking the rules of covert warfare they'd used abroad and brought'em into this country. now they had the people, the equipment, bases and the motivation... check out an old cia man, bill harvey ran something called "executive action", which carried out foreign assassinations. harvey was also involved with the fake defection program that got oswald into russia. check out the cabell brothers. interesting links to this case.}
