<L>__{interior warehouse moments later}
<A>__{haunting music. black and white film as connor and murphy take great care in ritualizing the bodies. they place pennies in eyes and cross hands over chests. whip pan...}
<L>__{exterior back to present, warehouse night}
<A>__{bodies are wheeled out in the b.g. as dolly and greenly talk privately with eunice.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{just got a call from my best snitch. never steered me wrong. he says its this guy.}
<P>__{(hands eunice mug)}
<D>__{"gorgeous" george tuffano. he's trusted bruglione to yakavetta but not blood. he's been left control of the streets. he's running all of it.}
<A>__{eunice looks over the mug shot.}
<C>__{greenly}
<D>__{they call him "gorgeous" cuz he likes his silk suits and jewelry. he's even got the 'out of season' fake bake going on, a real peacock, this guy.}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{yeah, i heard of this rodeo clown.}
<A>__{duffy approaches, hands eunice a tiny bullet in a baggy.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{ballistics just dug it out.}
<A>__{they all look perplexed.}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{a twenty two? you gotta be kidding me. that's like bringing a knife to a gunfight.}
<C>__{greenly}
<D>__{yeah, or like bringing a really small gun...to a gunfight.}
<A>__{they all blank stare greenly for a moment. moving on.}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{i don't know. ballistics is reading three shooters. this is one of them.}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{well, i'm having a hard time believing that one of the three most lethal individuals on the planet just switched over to bird shot.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{maybe we're reading it wrong. the priest was a frame job, right?}
<C>__{duffy}
<D>__{yeah, maybe somebody's trying to eliminate some competition here.}
<A>__{eunice considers this. the detectives seem hopeful.}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{no, sir. it's them. but we just might have ourselves a change in the line up, here.}
<A>__{the detectives all look at one another nervously.}
<C>__{greenly}
<D>__{fine, they're back. what's the plan?}
<C>__{eunice}
<D>__{hell, we've just been called up to the big show. we are tracking multiple perpetrators, gentlemen. the plan? we keep our ear to the ground and try to figure out where yakavetta's hiding. napoleon. we find him and flip him. and as for the saints...i'm gonna have me a face to face with these boys one way or the other.}
<A>__{she walks off. the cops look terrified.}
<C>__{dolly}
<D>__{holy...fucking...shit.}
