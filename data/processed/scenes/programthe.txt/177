<A>__{the team breaks out, comes to the line. joe looks over the defense, screams signals as the crowd noise is building. we go to slow motion as the ball is snapped. ray takes one step forward then turns right, leading the play. joe pitches to darnell who follows ray. georgia tech's outside linebacker comes up to stop the play. ray stumbles before he can make the block. he drops out of our picture.}

<A>__{darnell is forced to go wider toward the sideline. the linebacker and cornerback are closing, both have the angle on him. darnell starts to cut back. he lowers his shoulder to take the linebacker's blow. suddenly, out of nowhere, ray reappears and throws a devastating block on the linebacker, knocking him back into the cornerback, taking them both out. darnell cuts it up and blasts over the safety at the goal line. touchdown, e.s.u. the stands erupt. it's the first thing they've had to cheer about all day. winters just looks at the clock, goes over to talk to his defense. darnell foregoes his touchdown dance. he runs over to ray, grabs him by the helmet.}
