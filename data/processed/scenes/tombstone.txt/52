<L>__{ext lot behind o.k. corral day}
<A>__{behan dashes around the corner into the lot, facing the cowboys.}
<C>__{behan}
<D>__{they're on their way over here.}
<L>__{ext fremont street ok corral day}
<A>__{the earps and doc turn off 4th onto fremont st. creek johnson and texas jack vermillion watch as they pass the grocer's.}
<C>__{johnson}
<D>__{there they go. look kinda like preachers.}
<C>__{vermillion}
<D>__{yeah. or undertakers.}
<A>__{the vacant lot starts to come into view and the earps are fighting nerves now. fists clenched, gritting their teeth, eyes darting all over the street, they look all too human and nothing like their legend. it's only doc, bringing up the rear, who couldn't care less. wyatt narrows his eyes:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{virge, you're makin' the arrest. you make contact, i will back you up. morgan'll back me up, doc'll keep an eye out for trouble. and keep your hands on your guns. they even look like they're gonna start something, buffalo 'em. right over the head.}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{wyatt, i know what i'm doin'.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<P>__{(sees onlookers)}
<D>__{look at 'em all. they love it. how in the hell'd we get ourselves into this?}
<A>__{just then behan walks up holding up his hands, reassuring:}
<C>__{behan}
<D>__{you don't have to worry about a thing. i just went down there and disarmed them.}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{you did? great, thanks. come on, boys.}
<A>__{the earps quicken their step as behan enters fly's gallery. seeing the approaching earp party, the cowboys glance around at each other, setting themselves. now at the end of the sidealk, the earps can see that the cowboys are still armed and their relief evaporates. wyatt mutters under his breath:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{oh, great. disarmed my ass...}
<A>__{the earps slow their step, gathering themselves. this is it, no turning back now. the cowboys spread out. as the earps get closer and closer, it seems as if the very air is electric with tension. but as they step into the street and fan out for their final approach, they suddenly do look like their legend, 4 tall figures in long black coats advancing in a line, grim and unstoppable, a fleeting moment in time frozen forever in our minds. finally they stop. the 2 groups are facing each other, perhaps 20 feet apart. doc raises the shotgun, the cheshire cat smile spreading over his face. virgil steps forward, his face set, holding up doc's cane:}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{we've come to arrest you. throw up your arms!}
<A>__{a weird moment of confusion where nobody seems to know what to do. then billy clanton and frank mclaury slap their hands to their guns. the earps instantly tense up, hands on their pistols. virgil waves his hands frantically, afraid they've misunderstood:}
<C>__{virgil}
<D>__{hold! i don't want that!}
<A>__{suddenly realizing what's happening, fuller and claiborne bolt and dash into fly's gallery. everyone else stands frozen, breath short, pulses pounding, each staring into the other's wide open eyes. then something in billy clanton's eyes seems to go dead and wyatt groans under his breath as the awful realization hits him:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{oh, my god...}
<A>__{billy and frank jerk their pistols and the scene explodes, everything happening in split seconds as wyatt draws and fires, knocking frank down with a gutshot. morgan fires, blowing billy back against the wall of the harwood house. tom darts for the cover behind his horse as ike dives onto wyatt shrieking like a woman:}
<C>__{ike}
<D>__{no, no, please! i don't have a gun!}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{this fight's commenced. get to fightin' or get away!}
<A>__{wyatt hurls him aside. ike sprints for the gallery. tom fires over his saddle at doc who tries for a shot but is blocked by the horse. billly bounces back up, howling, and fires, the bullet piercing virgil's calf. he drops to one knee. tom fires again. doc fires one barrel into the air, the blast making the horse rear up, exposing tom for a split second. doc fires again. tom's side explodes into red mist, the full charge of red mist, the full charge of buckshot slamming him into the harwood house. tom drops his gun and teeters into the street, talking eerie little mincing steps, already dead but still moving, like a chicken with its head cut off. billy fires again, dropping morgan with a hole in his shoulder.}
<C>__{morgan}
<D>__{i'm hit.}
<A>__{doc pull his lightning and fires double action 1 2 3 times, hitting billy in the abdomen while frank bounds back into the fight, firing wildly. virgil gets up, firing back. the whole scene now bathed in thick smoke, the fight starts swirling into the street, each man jockeying for position. inside the gallery, behan and fuller watch at the window as ike dives in. he snatches fuller's pistol and fires through the window. ike's bullets whiz past wyatt's ear. he spins around, calling to doc:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{behind us!}
<A>__{in a flashing move taking less than a heartbeat, doc pivots, replacing the .38 in this right hand with his big .45, then with one pass of his left hand rapid fires quick as a machine gun burst 1 2 3 4 5 times, the bullets ripping through the gallery, showering ike and the rest with splinters and broken glass.}
<C>__{behan}
<D>__{come on!}
<A>__{behan hauls ike up and they dash out the back door, fuller and claiborne right behind, all frantically running for their lives. outside billy gets to his knees, seemingly indestructible, and fires at wyatt, wyatt returns fire. eyes wild and bulging, a bloody hand clutching his wounds, frank staggers across the lot, bearing down on doc through the smoke:}
<C>__{frank}
<D>__{i got you now, you son of a bitch!}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{you're a daisy if you do!}
<A>__{doc opens his arms, giving frank a clear shot at his chest. frank fires. the bullet grazes doc's holster. frank trudges closer, about to fire again but doc drills him through the heart while in the next millisecond morgan fires from his prone position on the ground, the big .45 blast carrying away the top of frank's head. as the last shot echoes through the hills, frank flops limply to the ground like a rag doll while out in the street his brother tom finally runs out of steam and pitches face first in the dirt, leaving only billy, leaning against the harwood house, legs splayed out in front of him, absolutely shot to pieces, clicking his empty gun and wailing piteously as the smoke clears:}
<C>__{billy}
<D>__{more cartridges! somebody load my gun...}
<A>__{he keeps repeating it with sinking volume as townspeople step timidly into the street. fly bends down and takes bill's gun from his hand and the fight is officially over, having lasted only some 20 seconds. wyatt helps morgan to his feet as behan strides briskly onto the scene, addressing wyatt:}
<C>__{behan}
<D>__{all right. you're all under arrest.}
<A>__{wyatt looks at him in utter disbelief. finally:}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{i don't think i will let you arrest us today, behan. maybe tomorrow.}
<A>__{more bystanders arrive, a crowd scene rapidly developing. the earp women run up from the west end of fremont. josephine fights her way through the crowd from the east. she and wyatt catch sight of each other. she grins, tears in her eyes. he nods, smiling. seeing the whole thing, behan fumes. and so does mattie who turns and walks away while allie and lou run to their men, hugging them. meanwhile doc stands over frank's body, fingering the graze over his thigh, jeering under his breath:}
<C>__{doc}
<D>__{you call that shooting?}
<C>__{fly}
<P>__{(comes up to wyatt)}
<D>__{the mclaurys are both dead. billy clanton's just about gone.}
<A>__{wyatt nods, pocketing his gun, sadly surveying the bloody scene.}
<C>__{wyatt}
<D>__{guess we did our good deed for today.}
