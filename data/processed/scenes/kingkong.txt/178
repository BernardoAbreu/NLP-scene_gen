<A>__{ack, denham, hayes, bruce, jimmy, lumpy, choy and preston clamber down a jagged rock face into lush sub tropical vegetation. they are followed by a few surviving sailors a bedraggled group ... cut, bruised, covered in dust, soaked in sweat. most of the guns are lost. ailors slump to the ground, exhausted. they are on a narrow clearing at the edge of a misty swamp. sheer cliffs rise out of the swamp on both sides of the shore.}

<D>__{jimmy, do a head count. i wanna know how many injured and how bad }
<C>__{lumpy}
<P>__{(interrupting)}

<A>__{close on: denham reaches with a trembling hand for his hip flask. he takes a big swig ... and stands staring out over the swamp. preston sits on a tree stump nearby.}
<C>__{preston}
<D>__{it's not your fault. what happened to herb it's no ones fault.}
<C>__{denham}
<P>__{(soft realization)}
<D>__{you're absolutely right, preston ... and i will tell you something else. herbert didn't die for nothing. he died for what he believed in and i'm gonna honour that.}
<A>__{close on: denham reaching for that moment of self justification.}
<C>__{denham }
<D>__{he died believing there is still some mystery left in this world and we can all have a piece of it for the price of an admission ticket!}
