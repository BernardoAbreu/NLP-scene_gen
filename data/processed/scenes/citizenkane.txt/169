<D>__{hello, brad }
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{emily }
<A>__{he pauses. leland comes in. emily closes the door.}
<C>__{emily}

<C>__{leland}
<D>__{chicago is pretty close to new york nowadays only twenty hours }
<A>__{she doesn't have anything to say.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{i'm glad to see you.}
<A>__{she smiles at him and we know that there isn't anybody else in the world for her to smile at. she's too grateful to talk.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{are all the returns in?}
<A>__{leland puts his hat unconsciously on his coat by the newspaper.}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{let me see it.}
<A>__{leland takes the newspaper out of his pocket and hands it to her. she takes it. we see the headline, not an insert, but it registers. it reads: "fraud at polls." emily is looking at the paper with unseeing eyes, and a little smile.}

<C>__{emily}
<D>__{i'm surprised he got the votes he did.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{emily!}
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{why should anyone vote for him? he's made it quite clear to the people what he thinks of them. children to be told one thing one day, something else the next, as the whim seizes him. and they're supposed to be grateful and love and adore him because he sees to it that they get cheap ice and only pay a nickel in the street cars.}
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{emily, you're being a little unfair you know what i think of charles' behavior about your personal lives }
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{there aren't any personal lives for people like us. he made that very clear to me nine years ago if i'd thought of my life with charles as a personal life, i'd have left him then }
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{know that, emily }
<C>__{emily}
<P>__{(on top of leland)}

<D>__{emily, you }
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{brad, i'm i'm not an old woman yet }
<C>__{leland}
<D>__{it's all over }
<A>__{he stops himself.}
<C>__{emily}
<P>__{(after a pause)}

<C>__{leland}
<D>__{he's paying for it, emily. those returns tonight he's finished. politically }
<P>__{(he thinks)}
<D>__{ socially, everywhere, i guess. don't know about the papers, but }
<C>__{emily}
<D>__{if you're asking me to sympathize with him, brad, you're wasting your time.}
<P>__{(pauses)}
<D>__{there's only one person i'm sorry for, as a matter of fact. that that shabby little girl. i'm really sorry for her, brad.}
